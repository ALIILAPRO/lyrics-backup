		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Heaven knows we're out of luck
Been on the point of giving up
If all is fair in war and love
Then why do we fight?
Something ain't right, yeah

'Cause we don't really talk about life no more 
I'm just here on my own tryna laugh it off
When the night comes crawling, I'm holding on
For something to change, tension to break
It's about time 

What are you hiding?
'Cause I got the right to know
There's something different in the way you look
What are you fighting?
If you're gonna let me go
It's gonna hurt so choose your words

Baby, let me down slow (let me down, let me down)
Baby, let me down slow (baby, let me down slow)
Baby, let me down slow (let me down, let me down)
Baby, let me down

Who's misguided? Who's to blame?
The first to have the final say?
If love is just a wicked game
Then why do we play? 
Why do we play? Yeah

And it hurts seeing you tryna put me off
Tryna make me be the one to break it off
When the night comes crawling, I'm holding on
For something to change, tension to break
It's about time

What are you hiding?
'Cause I got the right to know
There's something different in the way you look
What are you fighting?
If you're gonna let me go
It's gonna hurt so choose your words

Baby, let me down slow (let me down, let me down)
Baby, let me down slow (baby, let me down slow)
Baby, let me down slow (let me down, let me down)
Baby, let me down, oh

What are you hiding?
'Cause I got the right to know
There's something different in the way you look
What are you fighting?
If you're gonna let me go
It's gonna hurt so choose your words 

Baby, let me down slow (oh)
Baby, let me down slow (let me down, let me down, let me down slow)
