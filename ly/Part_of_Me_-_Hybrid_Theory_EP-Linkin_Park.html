		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Part of me won't go away
Every day, reminded how much I hate it
Weighted against the consequences
Can't live without it, so it's senseless
Wanna cut it out of my soul
And just live with a gaping hole
Take control of my life
And wash out all the burnt taste
I made the problems in the first place
Hang my head low 'cause it's part of me
You hardly see right next to the heart of me
Hurting me, the wounds soon scar
New cuts cover where the old ones are
And now I'm sick of this
I can't stand the sandpaper thoughts
That grate on my sanity
I'd rather not even be 
Than the man that's staring in the mirror through me

Cut myself free willingly
Stop just what's killing me
Cut myself free willingly
Stop just what's killing me
Cut myself free willingly
Stop just what's killing me
Cut myself free willingly
Stop just what's killing me

I feel it every day
I feel I'm in my way
I feel it swell up inside, swell up inside
Swallowing me

Freedom can be frightening if you've never felt it
Once it's been dealt with you feel like
You've been touched by something angelic
And then melted down into a pool of peace
Cease to be the animal you used to be
Remove the broken parts you know were wrong
And feel the calm when the problem's all gone
And then you start to see
Another piece of yourself that you can't let be
Memories of the last fight to free yourself
Taken to the depths of the bottom of the well
And now you know that you can choose to lose
The part in your heart where your insides bruised
You can live if you're willing to
Put a stop to just what's killing you

Cut myself free willingly
Stop just what's killing me
Cut myself free willingly
Stop just what's killing me
Cut myself free willingly
Stop just what's killing me
Cut myself free willingly
Stop just what's killing me

I feel it every day
I feel I'm in my way
I feel the swell up inside, swell up inside
Swallowing me

Alive in me, inside of me
A part of me screams as I wait silently
Alive in me, inside of me
A part of me screams as I wait silently

This part of me won't go away (alive in me, inside of me)
(A part of me screams as I wait silently)
Part of me won't go away (alive in me, inside of me)
(A part of me screams as I wait silently)

Mmm, mmm, yeah

Everywhere I look around
I see how everything ought to be
Every time I see myself
There's always something wrong with me

Everywhere I look around
I see how everything ought to be
Every time I see myself
There's always something wrong with me

I feel it every day
I feel I made my way
I feel it swell up inside, swell up inside
Swallowing me

I feel it every day
I feel I'm in my way
I feel it swell up inside, swell up inside
Swallowing me

I feel it swell up inside, swell up inside
Swallowing me
I feel it swell up inside, swell up inside
Swallowing me
