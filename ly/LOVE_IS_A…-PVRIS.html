		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I would drown in your holy water
Got a taste, now I'm going under
And let the world just fade away
Treat me bad like I'm no one's daughter
Body bag, baby, I'm a goner
Let it all just fade away

Just put your hands around my throat
Ain't been to Heaven but I'm close
Your love is a murder
Your love is a murder
I'll let you touch me sweet and slow
Just take my body and my soul
Your love is a murder
Your love is a murder

In your bed just the way that God made me
Cover me up, baby, just lay me
In the dirt 'til I'm pushing up daisies, oh
You got a dark side and it don't faze me
Cover me up, baby, just lay me
In the dirt 'til I'm pushing up daisies, oh
Your love is a murder

Like a virgin, a Madonna
On my knees praying for a hunter
You got a wild heart in your cage
Little death but I want another
And another, and another
I want it bad and I got no shame

Just put your hands around my throat
Ain't been to Heaven but I'm close
Your love is a murder
Your love is a murder
I'll let you touch me sweet and slow
Just take my body and my soul
Your love is a murder
Your love is a murder

In your bed just the way that God made me
Cover me up, baby, just lay me
In the dirt 'til I'm pushing up daisies, oh
You got a dark side and it don't faze me
Cover me up, baby, just lay me
In the dirt 'til I'm pushing up daisies, oh

Redrum in my bedroom
If you want some, come get some, whoa
Whoa
Redrum in my bedroom
If you want some, come get some, whoa
Whoa

In your bed just the way that God made me
Cover me up, baby, just lay me
In the dirt 'til I'm pushing up daisies, oh
You got a dark side and it don't faze me
Cover me up, baby, just lay me
In the dirt 'til I'm pushing up daisies, oh

Your love is a, love is a, love is a
Your love is a, love is a
Love is a, love is a
Murder
Your love is a, love is a
Your love is a, love is a
Murder
