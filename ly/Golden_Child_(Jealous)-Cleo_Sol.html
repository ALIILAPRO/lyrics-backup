		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They're just jealous of your mind, mind
They're just jealous cause you're kind, kind
Maybe it's cause you're alive
But you got to live your life
They're just jealous of your soul (soul)
They're just jealous cause you've known (known)
Maybe it's because you glow, glow, glow
I hope you know you're not alone
They're just jealous of your mind, mind
They're just jealous cause you're kind, kind
'Cause you are a golden child
'Cause you are a golden child
'Cause you are a golden child
'Cause you are a golden child
'Cause you are a golden child
'Cause you are a golden child
God loves it when you smile (smile)
'Cause you are a golden child
