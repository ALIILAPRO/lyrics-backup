Whoa-oh
Whoa-oh
Whoa-oh

Why don't we just run away? (Run)
Run away (run)
To the moonlight (light)
Be who we are
We can run away (run)
Run away (run)
Better be soon, I (I)
Want to be so high
High, high, high
To the moonlight
Better be soon, I (yeah, Toni)
Want to be so high (uh)

Broken English, homeroom teacher, corrected
Had to eat what I had to 'fore I heard of Doctor Sebi
Mama got a new boyfriend, I know it won't affect me
'Cause I been the man of this house, this nigga gon' respect me, uh
When I sold dope, it held depression (yeah)
When I buck her 'fore it held depression
I was broke during my adolescence (damn)
Need money counters for my blessings (blessings)
The essence of fluorescent light, I rock UV protection
I keep her legs separate like aromas on my dresser (dresser)
I fell in love and put her in the ring like a wrestler, yes, sir
Before I heard of Tesla, I was the plug
I used to hate when nobody showed me love, come on

Why don't we just run away? (Run)
Run away (run)
To the moonlight (yeah)
Be who we are
We can run away (run)
Run away (run away)
Better be soon, I (I)
Want to be so high
High, high, high
To the moonlight (yeah)
Better be soon, I (uh)
Want to be so high

Uh, young Tune in the booth like a cocoon
Shinin' like the moonlight, full clip for a full moon
Hotter than the sunlight, summer time, 12PM, noon
Tyson in the gun fight, Floyd Mayweather in June
All year round, homie, I hunt with my mouth foamin'
On the prowl, roamin', fuckin' the world without moanin'
On the hot corner like Josh Norman since Pop Warner
Moonlights, the cop lights, the spotlights, they spot on us
Amen, they better throw some prayers up, hope they land
I'll give 'em three to they hat before I give 'em a chance
Satan, sippin' lean like moonshine out a can
And they ran to the moonlight and ran into the Moon Man, bitch

Why don't we just run away? (Run)
Run away (run)
To the moonlight (light)
Be who we are (brrt)
We can run away (run)
Run away (run)
Better be soon, I (I)
Want to be so high
High, high, high
To the moonlight
Better be soon, I
Want to be so high
High, high, high
To the moonlight
Better be soon, I
Want to be so high

Whoa-oh
Whoa-oh
Whoa-oh
Whoa-oh
Whoa-oh
Whoa-oh
Whoa-oh
