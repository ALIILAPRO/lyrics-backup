		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No one wants to die alone
They don't wanna miss the show
It's funny, time missed us both
We all got time when we will go
(Don't) Seems to be over
(Never) Seems to be over
(Damn, yeah) Seems to be over
Seems to be over

They know she's mine 'cause I rule her
She says he does fine but I'm cooler
I got way more diamonds than your jeweler
All my girls dress like they work at Hooters
First I get my racks and then I backpack
No, I don't subtract, I might just add that
Did it on my own, no, you can't tax that
This that under the table, you can't track that
Put money ahead and I move with the brick
But I do not need a toaster
Diamond, water, I'm the boatster
Pull up right there in the Roadster
She ain't want me, I was so hurt
I was broke just like Joe Dirt
Where you from, throw it up, nigga
I'm from the lowest part of Earth (yeah)

No one wants to die alone
They don't wanna miss the show
It's funny, time missed us both
We all got time when we will go
(Don't) Seems to be over
(Never) Seems to be over
(Damn, yeah) Seems to be over
Seems to be over

Over you, yeah
I got two so you know that I can lose ya
Moving my savages, you know my boys 'gone shoot, yeah
Came to the club on my solo tryna groove, yeah
Just keep on walking, it is nothing just to prove, yeah
Oh, hell his diamonds fake and he can't fool us
You know it's Christian Dior all up on my shoes, yeah
White stripes on the arm of my tie, brown suit, ah
You know I pull up and I got my tootah
You know that I don't go nowhere without my ruler
You know everything that I said was for the mula
I swear that me and your love's dad called the movers

No one wants to die alone
They don't wanna miss the show
It's funny, time missed us both
We all got time when we will go
(Don't) Seems to be over
(Never) Seems to be over
(Damn, yeah) Seems to be over
Seems to be over

Put money ahead and I move with the brick
But I do not need a toaster
Diamond, water, I'm the boatster
Pull up right there in the Roadster
She ain't want me, I was so hurt
I was broke just like Joe Dirt
Where you from, throw it up, nigga
I'm from the lowest part of Earth
I told that girl pull up her skirt
I am so high that I don't wear no shirt
Talk about me, you fuck 'round go get murked
Reject your bitch with my dick when she jerk
I hit it first, Lil Uzi Vert
Know I stay on alert
Know I stay on alert
Know I stay on alert
