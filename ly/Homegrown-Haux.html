		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In the dark, found by me
We were so close, I couldn't back away
'Cause you were a shadow
And I left you in the shade
I was still running from all my mistakes

Cut to the fallen
Silenced all the world
I was still fighting
All that you deserve
Although it seems likely that I left before the storm
The truth is I couldn't be here wanting more

I traced my lies to cause
All I could was a ghost
All I could find was your ghost
I traced my lies to cause
All I could find was a ghost
All I could find was your ghost

I stay homegrown
Homegrown, homegrown
I stay homegrown
(I stay) homegrown, homegrown
(I stay) homegrown, homegrown
(I stay) homegrown, homegrown
(I stay) homegrown, homegrown
(I stay) homegrown, homegrown
(I stay) homegrown, homegrown
Homegrown

I traced my lies to cause
All I could was a ghost
All I could find was your ghost
All I could find was your ghost
I traced my lies to cause
All I could find was a ghost
All I could find was your ghost
All I could find

It was the winter, the shivers up my spine
It was the winter that left us both behind
Late in cover, only came to bear aside
Bruise left by lover
Bruise left by lover

I traced my lies to cause
All I could find was your ghost
