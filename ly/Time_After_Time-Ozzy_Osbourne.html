		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Time after time
I guess that love is blind
I couldn't read your mind
Line after line

Line after line
It was written in your eyes
I guess it's no surprise
Time after time

I can hear them whispering
Shadows in the rain
Thinking how it might have been
Time after time
Line after line, you broke me

Day after day
I watched love fade away
I wanted love to stay
Day after day

The games we play
The foolish things we say
The pain won't go away
Day after day

Candlelight is shimmering
Shadows on the wall
Thinking how it might have been
Day after day
The games we play, you broke me

Candlelights are shimmering
Shadows on the wall
Thinking how it might have been
Time after time
Line after line, you broke me
Time after time
Line after line, you broke me
