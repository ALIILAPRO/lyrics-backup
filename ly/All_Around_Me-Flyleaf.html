		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My hands are searching for You
My arms are outstretched towards You
I feel you on my fingertips
My tongue dances behind my lips for You

This fire runs in through my being
Burning, I'm not used to seeing You

I'm alive, I'm alive
I can feel You all around me
Thickening the air I'm breathing
Holding on to what I'm feeling
Savoring this heart that's healing

My hands float up above me
And You whisper you love me
And I begin to fade
Into our secret place

The music makes me sway
The angels singing say, "We are alone with you"
I am alone and they are too with You

I'm alive, I'm alive
I can feel You all around me
Thickening the air I'm breathing
Holding on to what I'm feeling
Savoring this heart that's healing

And so I cry (holy)
The light is white (holy)
And I see You

I'm alive (I'm alive), I'm alive (I'm alive), I'm alive
I can feel you all around me
Thickening the air I'm breathing
Holding on to what I'm feeling
Savoring this heart that's healing

Take my hand, I give it to you
Now You own me, all I am
You said You would never leave me
I believe You, I believe

I can feel You all around me
Thickening the air I'm breathing
Holding on to what I'm feeling
Savoring this heart that's healed
