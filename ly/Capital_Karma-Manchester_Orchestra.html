		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When the message was over
By the house, near the grave

So you wander in, aimless
For a while and went away
It was calm and departing
Was it wrong? In a way
I defended your drama
I'm a heart, you're a brain

All I wanna do is wait for you
All I wanna do is wait for you
There's nothing left to say

This capital carnage
On a float, a parade
Now you're craving your karma
Where'd it go? And what'd it say?

All I wanna do is wait for you
All I wanna do is wait for you
There's nothing left to say

Am I losing my patience? I feel it
I'm afraid that you know, you can see it
Let me stand by the door, let me breathe in
I forgave myself, so forgive yourself

I'm not trying to stand in the way
I'm in love with whoever you are
Nothing here is gonna take that away
It is you and it's been from the start
