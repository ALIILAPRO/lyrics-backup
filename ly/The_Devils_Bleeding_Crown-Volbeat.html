		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Falling from the sky, they're cast out from the heaven's light
Drenching the soil with blood, baptized in the fire hole

The devil's spawn no longer breathes
Descending angels and fallen kings
Raise your hands, what do you hold?
The devil's bleeding crown

Call upon it's father, bless the goat, the womanizer
Take him to Astaroth, Inanna's temple of Uruk

The devil's spawn no longer breathes
Descending angels and fallen kings
Raise your hands, what do you hold?
The devil's bleeding crown

They gathered all the children outside the church
And never would they know what went on in there
Close the door and hear all the angels scream
"Oh mercy, mercy, mercy, oh mercy, please"
Down, down, down
Down below you can hear his hoof digging through the ground
Oh lord, lord, lord
The horned one is back and he wants his crown

The devil's spawn no longer breathes
Descending angels and fallen kings
Raise your hands, what do you hold?
The devil's bleeding crown
