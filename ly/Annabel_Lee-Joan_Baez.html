		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It was many and many a year ago,
In a kingdom by the sea,
That a maiden there lived whom you may know
By the name of Annabel Lee,
And this maiden she lived with no other thought
Than to love and be loved by me.

I was a child and she was a child,
In this kingdom by the sea,
But we loved with a love that was more than love,
I and my Annabel Lee,
With a love that the winged seraphs of heaven
Coveted her and me.

And this was the reason that,long ago,
In this kingdom by the sea,
A wind blew out of a cloud,chilling
My Annabel lee,
So that her high,born kinsmen came
And bore her away from me,
To shut her up in a sepulcher
In this kingdom by the sea.

And the angels,not half so happy in heaven,
Went envying her and me,
Yes!,that was the reason(as all men know,
In this kingdom by the sea)
That the wind came out of the cloud by night,
Chilling my Annabel lee,
That the wind came out of the cloud by night
Killing my Annabelle.

But our love it was stronger by far than the love
Of those who were older than we,
Of many far wiser than we,
And neither the angels in heaven above
Nor the the demons down under the sea,
Can ever dissever my soul from the soul
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee, and the moon never beams,
Without bringing me dreams
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee,
And the stars never rise, but I feel the bright eyes
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee,
And so,all the night, tide, I lie down by the side
Of my darling my life and my bride,
In the sepulcher there by the sea,
In her tomb by the sounding sea.
