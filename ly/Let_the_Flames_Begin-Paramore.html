		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What a shame we all became such fragile, broken things
A memory remains, just a tiny spark
I give it all my oxygen, to let the flames begin
To let the flames begin

Oh glory
Oh glory

This is how we'll dance when
When they try to take us down
This is what we'll be, oh glory

Somewhere weakness is our strength, and I'll die searching for it
I can't let myself regret, such selfishness
My pain and all the trouble caused, no matter how long
I believe that there's hope

Buried beneath it all and
Hiding beneath it all and
Growing beneath it all and

This is how we'll dance when
When they try to take us down
This is how we'll sing oh
This is how we'll stand when
When they burn our houses down
This is what we'll be, oh glory

Reaching as I sink down into light (To light)
Reaching as I sink down into light (To light)

This is how we dance when
When they try to take us down
This is how we'll sing oh
This is how we'll stand when
When they burn our houses down
This is what we'll be, oh glory
