		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I HAD FOUND YOU 
I HAD LEFT YOU 
I FORGAVE YOU 
I FORGOT YOU 

YOU POSSESSED ME 
YOU CONTROLLED ME 
SAID YOU LOVED ME 
SAID YOU'D KILL ME 

HE IS SPEAKING 
SPEAKING FOR ME 
I'M A WORTHLESS HUMAN BEING 

HE'S STILL SPEAKING 
SPEAKING FOR ME 
KEEP YOUR VOICE DOWN 
OR HE'LL HURT ME 

Exorcists can't save me now 
I swear to you that I'm fine 
Please let me die; to be found 
He speaks for me; nerves that I grind 

Speaking louder in my own voice 
Blocked by the voice of a demon inside 
I act coy and I play nice 
Only to die on the inside 

I NEED AN EXORCISM 
I NEED AN EXORCISM 
I NEED AN EXORCISM 
I NEED AN EXORCISM 
I NEED AN EXORCISM 
I NEED AN EXORCISM 
I NEED AN EXORCISM 
I NEED AN EXORCISM 

IT HAPPENED ONCE 
IT HAPPENED TWICE 
IT WON'T HAPPEN NOW 
NOW I WON'T PLAY NICE 

YOU SPOKE FOR ME 
YOU SPOKE FOR THEM 
THIS IS NUMBER THREE 
GO BACK TO THE DAMNED 

BULLSHIT LIAR 
BULLSHIT LIAR 
BULLSHIT LIAR 
BULLSHIT LIAR 

EVERYTHING YOU TOLD ME WERE LIES 
YOU LEFT ME HERE TO FUCKING DIE 

BULLSHIT LIAR 
BULLSHIT LIAR 
BULLSHIT LIAR 
BULLSHIT LIAR 
EXORCISE ME 
GET THE DEMONS OUT OF ME
