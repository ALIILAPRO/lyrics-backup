		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Like his dad you know that he's had 
Animal nitrate in mind 
Oh in your council home he jumped on your bones 
Now you're taking it time after time 

Oh, what turns you on, oh?
Now he has gone 
Oh, what turns you on, oh?
Now your animal's gone

Well he said he'd show you his bed 
And the delights of the chemical smile 
So in your broken home he broke all your bones 
Now you're taking it time after time 

Oh, what turns you on, oh?
Now he has gone 
Oh, what turns you on, oh?
Now your animal's gone

What does it take to turn you on, oh?
Now he has gone
Now you're over twenty-one, oh
Now your animal's gone

Animal, he was animal, an animal, oh
Animal, he was animal, an animal, oh
Animal, animal, oh
He's just an animal, an animal oh
Animal, he was animal
He's just an animal, an animal oh
Animal, he was animal
He's just an animal, an animal oh
