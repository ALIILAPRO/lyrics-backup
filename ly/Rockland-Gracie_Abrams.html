		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey, I feel like I might say the wrong thing
I hung up when I started calling
You probably would've laughed then
If you had seen it happen
Hey, who took my place in bed when I left?
Who laughs at everything that you've said?
I'm sure that I would like her
If I were slightly nicer

Bet you wish you
Never even met me
I don't blame you
Broke your every heartbeat

Hey, I parked across the street from your house
The lights were on, the music got loud
I doubt you would've seen me
I hid from everybody
Hey, I feel like if we gave it one night
You'd hate me less and make it alright
Just wish that we could fight now
I'd hold you on the comedown

Bet you wish you
Never even met me
I don't blame you
Broke your every heartbeat
Bet you wish you
Never even met me
I can't blame you
Broke your every heartbeat

I see you every night in my sleep
Anticipatin' every bad dream
Like fallin' with a knife you cut deep, you cut deep
You cut deep
I see you every night in my sleep
Anticipatin' every bad dream
Like fallin' with a knife you cut deep, you cut deep

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Bet you wish you
Never even met me
I don't blame you
Broke your every heartbeat
Bet you wish you (I see you every night in my sleep)
Never even met me (anticipatin' every bad dream)
I can't blame you (like fallin' with a knife you cut deep)
Broke your every heartbeat (you cut deep, you cut deep)

I see you every night in my sleep
Anticipatin' every bad dream
Like fallin' with a knife you cut deep, you cut deep
(Oh)
