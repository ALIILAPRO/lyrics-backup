		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mix with me, unfold solutions
Bare witness to my evolution 
Violent moans, untamed contusions 
Were not really here it's all illusion 


Tonight we relish in design 
You say that I'm a state of mind
I say you're space, you say I'm time
What if the two could intertwine 
You grab me there your fingers sink
We breathe, we tense, no time to think
I take you til you're on the brink 
Then we dive off the edge in sync


Make love, fuck 
Lick me up
Petals, pluck
Drive me, clutch


Breathe me deeper baby, inhale
Intoxicate yourself then exhale 
Pay attention to my detail 
Like a wind that flows, that's how we feel


You give me you, I give you me
We take our time because were free
You say that I'm a sight to see
I say that you're a masterpiece 
There's no reason to refrain
What's your pleasure, what's my name 
Blend and merge until were same 
Nothing much of us remains 


Make love, fuck 
Lick me up
Petals, pluck 
Drive me, clutch
