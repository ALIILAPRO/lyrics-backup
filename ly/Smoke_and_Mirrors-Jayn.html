		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I never meant to call you out
I've always seen behind your smoke and mirrors
Oh sweetheart, please don't yell at me
It really isn't hard to see
The truth that's rotting underneath
Why weren't you honest from the start?
You know, I've always thought she must have liked you
She's just a temptress, don't you know
She'll say she loves you, even though
She only wants to steal your soul
I'll save you
You said you'd always be my friend
That we'd get married when we both got older
I'd never heard those words before
You made me long for something more
But then she tried to steal your love
What's with that look?
Do you really think I'm out of mind tonight?
Stop calling her name
If you play my game
She may just make it out alive
I love you
I'm not asking much, just give me your heart
And put no one else above me
Go on, just say you love me
Take my hand in yours and tell me that I'll always be the one
Without you, my life means nothing
So just say you love me tonight
And if you lie
This poor girl will have to die
I'm sorry that I lost my cool
As you can see here, I've been very busy
I found her number in your phone
Asked her to meet me here alone
So we could talk, just one on one
What's with that look?
Do you really think I'm taking this too far?
All you have to do
Is swear that you'll be true
And I will let her go right now
Just don't lie
No, I won't fall for this again
I'll always see behind your smoke and mirrors
I know you love me deep inside
You're simply caught up in her lie
So I will cut you free myself
I'm not asking much, just give me your heart
And put no one else above me
Please, just say you love me
Take my hands in yours and tell me that I'll always be the one
Without you, my life means nothing
So just say you love me
C'mon, what's the problem, quit your crying, be a man
Surely, she couldn't mean that much
Let me give you my love
Take my soul, my heart, and body, yes, I give it all to you
And if you still won't accept it
You're gonna regret it
I hate to play these games
But you're driving me insane
Won't you tell me that you'll stay
Now that she's not in the way?
