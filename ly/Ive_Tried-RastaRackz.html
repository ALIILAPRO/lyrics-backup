		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yea
You know I-
Don
You know I tried
You know I tried
At least I tried
I tried
Tell you how I feel inside
How I feel inside
Cause I tried I tried I tried
I tried I tried I tried
Tell you how I feel inside
(How I feel inside)
Tell you how I feel inside
(How I feel inside)
Ah
I tried gave you my heart and got another one
Tears from my eyes I bit the dust guess I'm another one
Where did I go wrong
You said I'm not the one you thought I was
Catching these feelings I got immersed and tried to fall in love
Our charts are compatible thought we could have a relationship
But you too grammatical calling us a situationship
I'm like oh my god
Fell to world and lost our spiritual ties
Left a message after the tone to let you know that I tried
At least I tried
I tried
Tell you how I feel inside
How I feel inside
Cause I tried I tried I tried
I tried
I TRIED
Tell you how I feel inside
TELL YOU HOW I FEEL INSIDE
Tell you how I feel inside
(I was up in the clouds and I-)
I was up in the clouds I was head over the hills
We smoking, fucking and chilling you sayin that you feeling me
Karma busting open the ceiling
It snatched me up you fade away and it's killing me
Cause I tried
Can you tell me why
I'm not the type to cry
We never said goodbye
And if we keeping it real you like my sexual abilities
Could've gave you more so many tenured possibilities
But I realized
We both were wrong so we couldn't make it right
You say you know but if you know you know you know that I tried
At least I tried
I tried
Tell you how I feel inside
TELL YOU HOW I FEEL INSIDE
How I feel inside
TELL YOU HOW I FEEL
Cause I tried I tried I tried
I tried I tried I tried
Tell you how I feel inside
Tell you how I feel inside
