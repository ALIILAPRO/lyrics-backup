		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Shocked Orwellian races 
Gather united in grief 
Nothing is left from the world they have known 
Grotesque indifferent belief 
Systems have failed 
Rules can't control 
Corrupt dictators, forever dethroned 
Lies of the Priest 
Trust of the Blind 
Failure of structures manipulate deviant crimes 

All nations hail the end of peace 
New dawn inception of disease 
Age of revenge has now been born 
By the mother of all wars 

Enemy of God 
Purity and innocence is killed 
Enemy of God 
Peace died long ago when life stood still 

Clash of demonic religions 
Hatred the human divine 
Despotic aggressors in triumph they reign 
Fanatics bring mayhem to life 
War of all wars 
Foreseen before 
Freedoms foundations exist no more 
A genocide nightmare the darkest of days 
Chaos devourers as all hope and pride fades 

Enemy of god 
Purity and innocence is killed 
Peace died long ago when life stood still 

Now the fury is unleashed 
The hunter has become prey for the beast 
Breathing savage disdain 
Malevolence ingrained 
No emotion for humanity 
Tragically the palace falls 
Burned are the imperators halls 
For their decadent facades 
All their elitaire 
Exhibition of filth to watch for all 

For those who die along the way 
timeless glory awaits 

Nothing can divide 
Terror is thy name 
Last legion alive 
Set the World aflame 
Enemy of god 
Cast deliverance 
Fanatical divide 
Slaying innocence 
Enemy of god 
Answer to no one 
Bringing war from heaven 
A thousand fires burn
