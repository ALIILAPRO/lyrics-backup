		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Are you a lucid dream?
That's what it seems
I'm not really sure if it's real
But I just got to say
I found my way
The forest got some magical feel, yeah

You've got to color my life
You've got to fill in my thoughts
You've got to color my life (when the city's gone)
You've got to fill in my thoughts (with the feels I'm on)

Are you a lucid dream
Or just a beam of light
Shining on me?
Or better yet the camera
You press record
Living in the playback we see

You've got to color my life
You've got to fill in my thoughts
You've got to color my life (when the city's gone)
You've got to fill in my thoughts (with the feels I'm on)

With the feels I'm on
With the feels I'm on
Yeah, yeah

You've got to color my life
You've got to fill in my thoughts
You've got to color my life (color my life)
You've got to fill in my thoughts (fill in my thoughts)
You've got to color my life (my life)
You've got to fill in my thoughts (fill in my thoughts)
You've got to color my life
You've got to fill in my thoughts

(You've got to color my life)
(You've got to fill in my thoughts)
(You've got to color my life)
(You've got to fill in my thoughts)
(You've got to color my life)
