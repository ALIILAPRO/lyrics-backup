		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She tried to pull on my strings (strings)
Shawty got cut from the team (oh)
Get litty, causin' a scene (scene)
Shawty a fool on the bean (bean)
I tried to make you my queen (queen)
Birkins and diamonds are cheap (oh)
Girl, that ain't nothing to me (oh)
You were the one on the street (oh)

I thought you'd never let me go
You switched on me, I lost control
I hope I see you on the road
So you can see how far I dove

So deep in the water (drip)
My bitch call me Poppa (yeah)
Count the money up like Carti (no, no)
If we die young, we ain't modest (whoa)
You was a ratchet ho (mm-hm)
Put you in designer clothes (all day)
See me in the streets, don't bother (no way)
Cut the bitch off like barbers

I dove in the water, yeah, in the water
I'm a rock star, bitch, throwin' water
In the water, yeah, in the water
I don't bother, bitch

She tried to pull on my strings (strings)
Shawty got cut from the team (oh)
Get litty, causin' a scene (scene)
Shawty a fool on the bean (bean)
(I tried to) I tried to make you my queen (queen)
Birkins and diamonds are cheap (oh)
Girl, that ain't nothing to me (oh)
You were the one on the street (oh)

I thought you'd never let me go
You switched on me, I lost control
I hope I see you on the road
So you can see how far I dove

See how a rich nigga move (rich nigga move)
Hoppin' out the Bentley coupe (Bentley coupe)
Oh, and it got a missing roof (yeah)
She freaky when she sip Grey Goose (sip Grey Goose)
I'm diggin' in the pussy, feel loose
I'm in the tour bus fuckin' bitches by twos (uh-huh-huh)
Slap the first day, tell me, what's the move (what the move?)
Popped a Perc', now gettin' in the groove (pop a Perc')
Dead fresh like the first day of school (yeah)
Wanna drop out, I'ma take you on a cruise
Steal a purse like I'm whippin' that loose
I'ma get the money, I ain't never gon' lose
Homie get that money, I got hundreds, all blues
When you keep it comin', all these bitches gon' choose (oh)
She want me fuckin' smack her on her ass 'til it bruise
She want me fuckin' smack her on her ass 'til it bruise

She tried to pull on my strings (strings)
Shawty got cut from the team (oh)
Get litty, causin' a scene (scene)
Shawty a fool on the bean (bean)
(I tried to) I tried to make you my queen (queen)
Birkins and diamonds are cheap (oh)
Girl, that ain't nothing to me (oh)
You were the one on the street (oh)

I thought you'd never let me go
You switched on me, I lost control
I hope I see you on the road
So you can see how far I dove
