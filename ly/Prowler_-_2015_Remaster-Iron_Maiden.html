		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Walking through the city, looking oh so pretty
I've just got to find my way
See the ladies flashing, all their legs and lashes
I've just got to find my way

Well you see me crawling through the bushes with it open wide
What you seeing girl?
Can't you believe that feeling, can't you believe it
Can't you believe your eyes?
It's the real thing girl

Got me feeling myself and reeling around
Got me talking but feel like walking around
Got me feeling myself and reeling a
Got me talking but nothing's with me
Got me feeling myself and reeling around

Walking through the city, looking oh so pretty
I've just got to find my way
See the ladies flashing, all their legs and lashes
I've just got to find my way

Well you see me crawling through the bushes with it open wide
What you seeing girl?
Can't you believe that feeling, can't you believe it
Can't you believe your eyes?
It's the real thing girl

Got me feeling myself and reeling around
Got me talking but feel like walking around
Oh yeah
