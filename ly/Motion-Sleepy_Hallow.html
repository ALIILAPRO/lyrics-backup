		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh, she don't love me, she just, uh
Yeah (Great John on the beat by the way)

She don't love me, she just love the motion (motion, motion, motion)
I shouldn't show emotion
But I still got some feelings that I'm tryna cope with (cope with, cope with, cope with)
I roll up my feelings and I fuckin' smoke it, ayy
I done lost a lot but winnin' was the focus
I been hidin' all my pain, hopin' they don't notice, oh, shit (oh, shit)

Baby, I like bad girls, but I love 'em good
She said, she a sad girl, she misunderstood, uh
Pulled up to my hood, in my hoodie that she took
Let's play one on one for your heart and once we start just watch me cook, uh
Probably got you shook
Why? 'Cause I can read you like a book
I got you singin' all my hooks
I pop a P like what you push, uh
Was off that shit for like two years but now I'm back, feel like I'm hooked
I got these Carti's just to look
Girl, I can see right through your looks
Her heart inside my pocket but don't treat me like no crook
Girl, I want peace, I don't wanna beef, unless you fuck with opps
Look at you duckin' shots, I love you, you should love me a lot, uh
Her friend, she fuck a lot, wouldn't cuff it even if I was a cop, uh
I just can't trust a lot, gotta watch yourself, better clutch a lot (a lot)
Red dot like chicken pox, can't play with it, niggas gettin' got
Look, bro, that's my main bop, she want Nobu, not chicken spot

She don't love me, she just love the motion (motion, motion, motion)
I shouldn't show emotion
But I still got some feelings that I'm tryna cope with (cope with, cope with, cope with)
I roll up my feelings and I fuckin' smoke it, ayy
I done lost a lot but winnin' was the focus
I been hidin' all my pain, hopin' they don't notice, oh, shit (Oh, shit)

She said she the one not the two
I put on my threes, I got some shit, it's all for you
I couldn't find my fives, I left my sixes in the stu
I met seven different women and they all nothin' like you
Don't ask me if I ate 'cause I ain't worry 'bout no food
She said I ain't seen you since nine, so once it's ten I'm callin' you
Like give me all of you, I just hope I ain't fallin' through
Like it's so hard to win, they made it easy just to lose

She don't love me, she just love the motion (motion, motion, motion)
I shouldn't show emotion
But I still got some feelings that I'm tryna cope with (cope with, cope with, cope with)
I roll up my feelings and I fuckin' smoke it, ayy
I done lost a lot but winnin' was the focus
I been hidin' all my pain, hopin' they don't notice, oh, shit h, shit)
