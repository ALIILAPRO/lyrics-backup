		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Caught you coming alive 
Hair messed up, rose tinted eyes
That's a hell of a lie 
Or maybe I'm too close to

See what's really going on upstairs 
Behind it all it's not so scary, so scare me 
I was wrong can't calm me down
It's all my fault I thought my friends grew busy or weary

So why do I think everybody hates me
Stuck on these lowlights make me feel lazy 
Hold my hand I know you want to 
Sorry if somebody hurt you
Where's my mind gone lately
It's running on crazy

Caught you trying to cry 
Long walk my headphones for life 
Now you're wondering why
The clouds on your shoulders just want to come for a ride too 

See what's really going on upstairs 
Behind it all it's not so scary, so scare me 
I was wrong can't calm me down
It's all my fault I thought my friends grew weary or busy
