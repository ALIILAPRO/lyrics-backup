		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I check the window
I gathered all the shapes left in my mind
Can never win you (hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo)
Escape your decorations and your skin
You left me disgusted, still I fall in
Tried to find some purpose in your conflict
So rotten, I was just a child
Exhausted, I reach for your eyes

No apologizing
No apologizing here
No apologizing
Oh no, oh no
Who apologizes?
No apologizing here (you looking at me, you looking at me?)
I don't need to say sorry
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh

I can't forget you
Give anything to flip the switches off (off, off, off)
I'm past a breakthrough (ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Still trying to find good spirits in the cup
To kill a believer, you killed a believer
Shocked me into everything I know
I kill it, I need it
I kill it, I need it
Taste my inhibitions, burning cold

No apologizing
No apologizing here
No apologizing
Oh no, oh no
Who apologizes?
No apologizing here (if you're looking for me, are you looking for me?)
I don't need to say sorry
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh

Downstairs (I fought the cold)
Basement (breaking my bones)
Downstairs, all the letters that you wrote, oh
All the lies that you told
Downstairs (me and my enemies)
Downstairs (feel no different to me)
Downstairs, down there
I piece it together

No apologizing
No apologizing here
No apologizing
Oh no, oh no
Who apologizes?
No apologizing here (you looking at me, are you looking at me?)
I don't need to say sorry
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh (that's enough, pack it up)
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
