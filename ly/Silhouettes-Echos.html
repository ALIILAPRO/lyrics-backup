		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, my blood is thick with regret
The sounds of this house
Beatin' through my chest
And when the storms arrive
The flood beneath will rise
You'll look into my eyes
And sing nothing left in my lungs for you

In my in my in my

Oh, my thoughts they seem to reflect
Like mirrors in my head i see my silhouette
And when the storms arrive
The flood beneath will rise
You'll look into my eyes
And sing i was never enough for you

In my in my in my

In my in my

Paint silhouettes with my fingertips
Trace out my regrets like they don't exist
In my in my in my

In my
