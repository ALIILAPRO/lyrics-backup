		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A million lonely people
And, darling, here we are
There must've been a reason
We've come this far
But nothing lasts forever
You blink and then it's gone
If we should be together
What you waiting for?

Don't leave it 'til the last dance
Don't leave it 'til the lights come up and the music stops
To kill the romance
Don't leave it 'til the last chance
You know it takes just one second to light that spark
But you miss it and you're in the dark
Don't leave it 'til the last chance
Don't leave it 'til the last dance

So many souls are leaving
We're almost at the end
We've had a lifetime being
Just good friends
But nothing lasts forever
We're here and then we're gone
If we should be together
What you waiting for?

Don't leave it 'til the last dance
Don't leave it 'til the lights come up and the music stops
To kill the romance
Don't leave it 'til the last chance
You know it takes just one second to light that spark
But you miss it and you're in the dark
Don't leave it 'til the last chance
Don't leave it 'til the last dance (last dance)

Oh, why does it have to be so hard?
Hard for both of us
Oh, why? 'Cause you're better than anyone
That I have ever known

Don't leave it 'til the last dance
Don't leave it 'til the lights come up and the music stops
To kill the romance
Don't leave it 'til the last chance
You know it takes just one second to light that spark
But you miss it and you're in the dark
Don't leave it 'til the last chance
Don't leave it 'til the last dance
