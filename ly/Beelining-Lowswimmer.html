		<p>
		  Hey, literally,
would you run a long, long way out?
Like, really beeline?
Lean into me,
you said it in a cold, cold way, I
see what you mean now.
It’s gonna be the best that I can do.
Is that really the best that I can do?
Say, I, where had I come from?
Co
-
sign the weight of my conscience...
I can be unmanned if I want, or I can be the best that I can be.
I left it on the dashboard,
and I was wrong to leave it that long.
I can honestly say I am a better man,
and if time won’t let you have it, I’ll remembe
r that.
