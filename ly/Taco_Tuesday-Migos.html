		  (Durel made the beat, I'ma rock with it)

Pretty down night right now
Sike, 'cause it's Taco Tuesday
(What is it?) Taco Tuesday

Yeah (woo) Taco Tuesday 
I got the cheese, she tasting the Kool-Aid (taco)
Migos the plug, Guadalupe
She gonn' do what the group say, comprende (comprende)
Caliente (uh), she get the bag but she gotta get it ten ways (woo)
Okay, now ándale, ándale (ándale)
What the money make? (money make)
We can elevate (elevate)

Shanaynay, like she on the runway (Shanaynay)
It's a pay day when she gets the cum face (woo)
Mamacita want Tequila and a Bombay (Tequila)
Trap beating in the cul-de-sac a one way

She want Perc before she take off her skirt (Perc, Perc)
Put in work, put your name on it (skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
These diamonds get to winking, like to flirt, flirt, flirt
They can't put your face on a shirt (shirt)
Been having flavor, givin' waves since birth (birth)

My name José (hola)
It's a long line at the doorway (trap)
We servin' tacos, get 'em with the nachos
Fuckin' with a bad vibe and should go both ways (bad)
Count up the racks off a show date ('niros)
I never ever see a broke day (oh no)
Look into the eyes of the G.O.A.T face (G.O.A.T)
The gang and Durel, it's a four way (four), Takeoff

Taco Tuesday 
I got the cheese, she tasting the Kool-Aid (taco)
Migos the plug, Guadalupe
She gonn' do what the group say, comprende (comprende)
Caliente (uh), she get the bag but she gotta get it ten ways (woo)
Okay, now ándale, ándale (ándale)
What the money make? (money make)
We can elevate (elevate, woo, go)
