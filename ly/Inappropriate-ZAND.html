		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've seen many faces
And I've made many jobs
And this might sound complacent
But my income never drops
And you've got something 'bout you
I see stars inside your name
I've been many places darling so let me pick ya brain

Why you so loud? Might wanna shut up
Just tone it down, no need to make fuss
What's with the frown? Why you so serious?
If you want it this bad then shush

You're inappropriate
You're inappropriate
We can't associate
If you're inappropriate
So what you got to show for it, uh

I've seen many faces
And I've met many boys like you
And you're not any different if you protest that I make noise
Are you?
Cos you don't fucking know me do you?
Don't act like we're the same (not the same)
I've been many places, darling
So let me just explain

Oh no I'm not about to shut up
I bet you thought I would be quiet
Think you forgot who you can interrupt
Ain't gonna suck nobody's dick so buddy giddy up 'cos

I'm inappropriate
I'm inappropriate 
I'm fuckin' known for it 
I'm inappropriate and I got lots to show for it, uh
I'm inappropriate (I'm inappropriate)
I'm inappropriate (I'm inappropriate)
I'm fuckin' known for it (I'm fuckin' known for it)
If you're inappropriate 
Then what you got to show for it? (aaaahhhh!)

(hahahaha, yah)
Tennis ball head
And it's pretty bloody prominent
I'm making these Kens act shitty cos I'm dominant
He musta misread
Cos he thought he bought a barbie doll
But this one's possessed, silly twat
I'll fucking haunt you all
Have you heard from your mummy lately?
Does she know that her son is sucking my feet?
Metaphorically, duh, cos Zand avoids meat
But the gammon in here needs tenderizing 

I'm inappropriate (I'm inappropriate)
I'm inappropriate (I'm inappropriate)
I'm fuckin' known for it (I'm fuckin' know for it)
I'm inappropriate and I got lots to show for it, aaaahhhh!
I'm inappropriate (I'm inappropriate)
I'm inappropriate (I'm inappropriate)
I'm fuckin' known for it (I'm fuckin' known for it)
You're inappropriate 
Then what you got to show for it, uh (aaaahhhh!)
Uh

Ha ha ha ha ha ha, hot 
(Woof)
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha, hot, hot
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha, hot 
(Huh?)
