		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wake up
Good morning, ma'am
Your early morning call

You must wake up
Wake up
Wake up, man
Wake up, child 
Pay attention
Come on, wake up
Wake up, love
We should make the night
But see your little lights alive
Stop that lying (ma needs a shower, get out of bed)
And sleeping in bed, get up

Little light
Can you not see that little light up there?
Where?
There
Where?
Over here
You still in bed?
Wake up, sleepy head
We are of the going water and the gone
We are of water in the Holy Land of water
Don't you know you've kept him waiting
Look who's here to see you

You won't burn (red, red roses)
You won't bleed (pinks and posies)
Confess to me, girl (red, red roses, go down)

Spiritus Sanctus in nomine
Spiritus Sanctus in nomine
Spiritus Sanctus in nomine
Spiritus Sanctus in nomine

Poor little thing (red, red roses)
The blackbird (pinks and posies)
Wings in the water (red, red roses)
Go down (go down, pinks and posies)

Deus et dei domino inferno
Deus et dei domino inferno
Deus et dei domino inferno
Deus et dei domino inferno

What is it, child?

Bless me, father, bless me father, for I have sinned

Help me, listen to me, listen to me, tell me (red, red roses)
Help me, baby, don't go (red, red ro-)

I question your innocence
She's a witch (help this blackbird, there's a stone around my leg)
Ha, damn you, woman 
(Help this blackbird, there's a stone around my leg)
What say you, good people (guilty, guilty, guilty)
Well, are you responsible for your actions? (This blackbird)
Not guilty (help this blackbird)
Wake up the witch

Get out of the waves
Get out of the water
