		  (Classic)

I seen your type before
What do you take me for?
Mama no born me yesterday
I know you just wanna play

It's okay if you wanna get freaky
With me (freaky, freaky, freaky)
Freaky with me (freaky, freaky, freaky)
Ooh, freaky with me (freaky, freaky, freaky)
Freaky, yeah, yeah (yeah)

Knew it when I met her she was far from the meta
God was deep in his bag, shawty's carved to the letter (uh)
Skin looking like a whole jar of Nutella
You just gotta make it spread to harness the pleasure
Time to feast, I don't need a cookbook (uh-huh)
She's the type that makes being bad look good (yeah)
They say sticks and stones and all the great bones
But, uh, whips and chains, that's the game of thrones
Give it all to me
Make it worth the wait, baby, crawl to me
The way you put it on me is like sorcery (uh)
What's a good time without debauchery (freaky, freaky, freaky)
You know I'm all for the extras, yes sir
So dive in it head first 
And I can ride the whole wave, baby, let's surf (freaky, freaky, freaky)
I'm tryna make your toes curl in
So just tell me what the safe word is, if you wanna get

Yeah, if you wanna get
Freaky with me (freaky, freaky, freaky)
Freaky with me (freaky, freaky, freaky)
Ooh, freaky with me (freaky, freaky, freaky)
Freaky
It's okay, you just wanna get

Let yourself go, girl, that's really the flex
No holding back, swear that's really the best
Down for the night, said she came to collect
Down for your type and the way you finesse
She told me forget, she grab on my neck
She asked me who owned it, I told her, "It's Tec"
Ac on blast but we started to sweat
Here to make magic we'll never forget (freaky, freaky, freaky)
See the thing bouncing, drank from her fountain
Back for the fifth time but tell me, who's counting?
Everything peaks when we try to move mountains
Everything sweet when I yarn her this time
"Baby look in my eyes when you 'bout to take off", hmm
That shit dey make my brain soft, hmm
The inner freak dey wake up, hmm
Let's see how long it takes us, if you wanna get (it's okay if you wanna get)

Freaky with me (freaky, freaky, freaky)
Freaky with me (freaky, freaky, freaky)
Ooh, freaky with me (freaky, freaky, freaky)
Freaky
Freaky, freaky, freaky, freaky, freaky, yeah, freaky
Freaky, freaky, freaky
Freaky, freaky (freaky, freaky, freaky)
Freaky, freaky (freaky, freaky, freaky)
Freaky, I just want to get, ahh

(Freaky, freaky, freaky)
(Freaky, freaky, freaky)
(Freaky, freaky, freaky)
