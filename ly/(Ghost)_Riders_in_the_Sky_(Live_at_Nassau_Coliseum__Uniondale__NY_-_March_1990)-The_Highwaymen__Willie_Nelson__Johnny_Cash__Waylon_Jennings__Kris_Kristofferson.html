		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  An old cowpoke went riding out one dark and windy day
Along a ridge he rested as he went along his way
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw
Ploughin' through the ragged brush
And up the cloudy draw

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel
Their horns were black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the skies
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry

Yippee-yi-ay (yippee-yi-ay), oh yippee-yi-o (yippee-yi-o)
Ghost riders in the sky
Reggie Young

Their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred
Their shirts all soaked with sweat
They're riding hard to catch that herd
But they ain't caught 'em yet
'Cause they've have to ride forever on that range up in the sky
On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear them cry

As the riders loped on by him, he heard one call his name
"If you want to save your soul from hell, riding on our range
Then cowboy change your ways today, or with us you will ride
Trying to catch the devil's herd across these endless skies"

Yippee-yi-ay (yippee-yi-ay), oh yippee-yi-o (yippee-yi-o)
Ghost riders in the sky
Ghost riders in the sky
Ghost riders in the sky
