		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bitch, I move with the lefts, huh
Can't ride with y'all, move with the set
Better show some respect, huh
With the gang and we carryin' TECs
So you wanna go drillin'? Don't talk about it
Goin' through so much pain 'til I walk without it, huh
Walk without it, goin' through so much pain 'til I walk without it, huh

Drillin', spinnin', huh, .40 gon' hit him
Kill him, huh, don't look too sus', might drill him
Can't trust no bitch, no, never
Black hoodie only type to fuck with her
Gotta watch who you trust, don't let 'em 
Get 'em, get too close, might hit 'em
Back to the box, they drillin'
Off like three Percs, can't feel 'em
Tell 'em I look mean but I'm chillin'
Pain run too deep, no healin', yeah
(Pain run too deep, no healin', yeah)
(Pain run too deep, no healin', yeah)

Bitch, I move with the lefts, huh
Can't ride with y'all, move with the set
Better show some respect, huh
With the gang and we carryin' TECs
So you wanna go drillin'? Don't talk about it
Goin' through so much pain 'til I walk without it, huh
Walk without it, goin' through so much pain 'til I walk without it, huh

Look, goin' through too much pain then I walk without it
It don't matter who right or who wrong, I'ma ride for the set
Huh, call you my brother, don't speak on no missus
You know how we get 
Really bang, we can flex out
Put in pain, he a stain, he get stretched out
Look, M8V3N gang bring the TECs out
Look, M8V3N gang bring the TECs out
Oh, you with the drillin'? Word to who?
My nigga, some villains scare you, boo
Look, he a menace, he so cruel
Let's talk and more drillin', make the news
Look, really cause problems, huh
.40 make a nigga spin for real
No, they don't want problems, look
I'll sent 'em more hell for real

Bitch, I move with the lefts, huh
Can't ride with y'all, move with the set
Better show some respect, huh
With the gang and we carryin' TECs
So you wanna go drillin'? Don't talk about it
Goin' through so much pain 'til I walk without it, huh
Walk without it, goin' through so much pain 'til I walk without it, huh
