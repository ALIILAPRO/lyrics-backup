		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Money, diamonds, house in different cities
I'm livin' my wildest dreams
Crooked smile, I'm in with all the power
Can do what I want
But I'm empty
Baddies got 'em
Model movie options
To makin' a movie scene
You know all the game
But what's it really mean?

Lord knows I (try)
Try to give up
(I try)
Tried what I thought could be love
Tried takin' chances and chance brought me down to my knees

Girl, I've been
So dumb
Don't wanna be a fool out of love all alone
Girl, I been
So wrong
Buyin' up the world just to make it feel like home
I been numb, so numb
Spendin' every dime to get everything I want
There's only one thing missing in life
That's you (you)
Oh-oh

Cocoa butter
Baccarat on covers
I smell it on my sheets
I heard you say that you might love another
It filled up my world with envy
And I can't stop reminiscing
When we relivin' the moment when you were meant for me
But all this fame and fortune
Can't afford me what I need

Lord knows I (try)
Try to give up
(I try)
But all I can see is forwards
I tried takin' chances and chance brought me down to my knees

I've been
So dumb
Don't wanna be a fool out of love all alone
Girl, I've been
So wrong
Buyin' up the world just to make it feel like home
I've been numb, so numb
Spendin' every dime to get everything I want
There's only one thing missing in life
That's you
That's you
That's you
That's you

Girl, I've been
So dumb
Don't wanna be a fool out of love all alone
I've been
So wrong
Buyin' up the world just to make it feel like home
I been numb, so numb
Spendin' every dime to get everything I want
There's only one thing missing in life
That's you
That's you
You know it's true (that's you)
I can't help myself, you know it's you, oh (that's you)
Girl, it's you (that's you)
Girl, it's you (that's you)
Girl, it's you (that's you)
Oh-oh
You know it, you know it, you know it, you know it (that's you)
You know it, you know it, you know it's true (that's you)
It's always, it's always been you (that's you)
Forever, forever with you (that's you)
Ooh (that's you)
