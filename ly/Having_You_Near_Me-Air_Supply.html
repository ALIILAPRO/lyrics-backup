		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I came to you and never asked too much
Wondering what you would say
Hoping you'd understand
It's not a role I usually play
Don't speak too much of what's been going on
The past is over and gone
Give me your troubled mind
You know it's used
I can do so much for you

I want you
Having you near me, holding you near me
I want you to stay and never go away
It's so right
Having you near me, holding you near me
I'll love you tonight, it feels so right
Feels so right

You're brave to say that you get lost in love
But you opened your heart to me
Underneath all you feel you know
How deep our love could be
Tonight we'll touch until it's time to go
Then I'm leaving it up to you
Even a fool would know that I'm not through
I can do so much for you

I want you
Having you near me, holding you near me
I want you to stay and never go away
It's so right
Having you near me, holding you near me
I'll love you tonight, it feels so right
Feels so right
