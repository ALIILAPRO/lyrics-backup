		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can get used to the treatment
Designer got bought every stop on the tour, uh
Jumbo my flex, iced out my neck
Love to get bitches that curved (ice on my neck)
Always a flex, purple baguettes, baby you know I'm from Mars (flex)
Flex on my ex, never regret, S on my chest, yeah

I can get used to the treatment
Designer got bought every stop on the tour, uh
Jumbo my flex, iced out my neck
Love to get bitches that curved (ice on my neck)
Always a flex, purple baguettes, baby you know I'm from Mars (flex)
Flex on my ex, never regret, S on my chest, yeah

Young nigga splurge the pot, uh (pot)
Young nigga work the block, uh (block)
I got some commas, I'll take care of mama
Ain't promised tomorrow, no (take care of mine)
I keep them choppers on deck, yeah (ooh)
Chanel on my shirt is the best, yeah (ooh)
Broke boy, you makin' a mess
Sticky approach and you niggas get wet (drip)
Glam Boy, my nigga, you slept on
They love you but disappear
Skydweller my wrist 'cause I'm never here
The Ghost is the whip 'cause I never steer
Two bitches addicted to eatin' flesh
A lot goin' on but we sayin' less
They buy the Plan B at the CVS
I'm shootin', but fuck it, don't need a vest

I can get used to the treatment
Designer got bought every stop on the tour, uh
Jumbo my flex, iced out my neck
Love to get bitches that curved (ice on my neck)
Always a flex, purple baguettes, baby you know I'm from Mars (flex)
Flex on my ex, never regret, S on my chest, yeah

I can get used to the drippin' in Barneys
I rope her like Hardy, my guy
Packin' it just like the maids
When we leave for tour out my loft
Always a flex, purple baguettes, baby you know I'm from Mars (flex)
Flex on my ex, never regret, S on my chest, yeah
She playin' chess, Teflon that vest, and I smoke gas when I'm stressed
Make his own fees, call the police, all because my set's a threat
Damage alert, hand up her skirt, we 'bout to "F" as in Frank
My friends are deceased, that's why I'm so blue when I count up my Franks, yeah

I can get used to the treatment
Designer got bought every stop on the tour, uh
Jumbo my flex, iced out my neck
Love to get bitches that curved (ice on my neck)
Always a flex, purple baguettes, baby you know I'm from Mars (flex)
Flex on my ex, never regret, S on my chest, yeah

I can get used to the treatment
Designer got bought every stop on the tour, uh
Jumbo my flex, iced out my neck
Love to get bitches that curved (ice on my neck)
Always a flex, purple baguettes, baby you know I'm from Mars (flex)
Flex on my ex, never regret, S on my chest, yeah
