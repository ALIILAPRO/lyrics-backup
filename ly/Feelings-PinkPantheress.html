		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Breath comes out of me, it's my philosophy
It only slows you down, you can't look at me now
Wires on the floor, it plays twenty-four of the hours a day
Hearin' it keeps me sane
This feelin' I pay you while you're on the stage
No, I can't take a pill, and yet I can't stay still
Now I'm wonderin' what made me feel this way
Because I can't stay sure, I'll carry on, ignore

My worries
'Cause no one ever told me to worry
I realize that I'm peakin' too early
But I don't want that makin' you worry
'Cause no one ever told me to wo-

Breath comes out of me, it's my philosophy
I won't get out of here, it's the one thing I fear
Wires on the floor, it plays twenty-four
He can't beg me to stay, you won't seem unafraid
This feelin' I pay you while you're on the stage
No, I can't take a pill, and yet I can't stay still
Now I'm wonderin' what made me feel this way
Because I can't stay sure, I'll carry on, ignore

My worries
'Cause no one ever told me to worry
I realize that I'm peakin' too early
But I don't want that makin' you worry
'Cause no one ever told me to wo-

I'll never give it up
This is everything I wanted
This feelin' of love
If you weren't singin' your chorus (worry)
I'll never give it up
This is everything we wanted (worry)
This whole thing went up
While you're here comin' for us (told me to worry)
