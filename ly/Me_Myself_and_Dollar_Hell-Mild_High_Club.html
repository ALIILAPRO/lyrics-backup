		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  America, what the fuck?
Ain't it hilarious? Runaway chariot
Shy of a half a billion guns
(Who you with?)
Me? I'm with Jesus

Is it something in the water?
'Cause it's a me, myself, and dollar hell
(Ain't freedom sweet?)
Sounds pretty freaky to me

What do you mean, buddy?
Freedom rings

Is it something in the water?
'Cause it's a me, myself, and dollar hell

With everything we know
What did we suppose was gonna happen to us?
Got the plastic blues
And all the green's skimmed off the top

(Who you with?)
Me? I'm with reason
Is it something in the water?
'Cause it's a me, myself, and dollar hell
Ain't freedom sweet?
