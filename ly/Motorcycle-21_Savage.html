		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She gon' ride it like a motorcycle
She gon' ride it like a motorcycle
She gon' ride it like a motorcycle
She gon' ride it like a motorcycle
She gon' ride it like a motorcycle
She gon' ride it like a motorcycle

She gon' ride it like a motorcycle, throw it back baby recycle
Bitch I'm bleeding like I'm on a cycle, I be leaning baby no NyQuil
And I can't stop it, keep going baby don't stop it
All my garments come from France, French kissing in France
Hundred thousand stuffed in my pants, money piling up like ants
And I can't stop it, keep going baby don't stop it

I can't stop it, hundred thousand stuffed in my pocket
Pull up on a nigga with a rocket, if I pull it out then I'ma pop it
I call her bike life 'cause she ridin', non-stop it, eat the pussy up and then a nigga get it popping
Finger licking good like shrimp and teriyaki
VVS diamonds got my watch playing hockey
21 Savage I get money like a Jew, hundreds on me blue, hundreds on me blue
You know I'm a slut, I'll fuck your crew
Yeah I'm a dog like that, pull up in a rarri with the top dropped back
Pull up on your block with the chop cocked back
Pew pew pew, make a nigga walk back
1017 they need to bring the wop back, when I get inside that pussy baby I can't stop
I love it when I see them nipples through the crop top
Butt crack showing in them G-Star jeans
Make a nigga wanna go and buy her a ring
She gon' turn a nigga to a fiend, she gon' make a nigga kill the scene
She gon' hold my dope when I'm in need, she gon' bail me out when I'm in need

She gon' ride it like a motorcycle, throw it back baby recycle
Bitch I'm bleeding like I'm on a cycle, I be leaning baby no NyQuil
And I can't stop it, keep going baby don't stop it
All my garments come from France, French kissing in France
Hundred thousand stuffed in my pants, money piling up like ants
And I can't stop it, keep going baby don't stop it

Put the money in the safe, you could beat it like a case
I've been waiting all day, so I could put it in your face
Been real with him from the start know a lot of niggas sell out
Get up in the jam you know who to call to bail out
Got a bad bitch, know these niggas gon' hate
Can't stop getting money bitch I don't got brakes
If a nigga bout his bread, it be getting to his head
He be running from the feds, left a lot of niggas dead
Ain't enough kush, he be rolling like dice
Show him who the business now he wanna throw the rights
He'll pay for it if I gave him a price, fuck around with my type boy you know you ain't right
I'm knowing your bitch ain't had shit
Its Dreezy and 21 Savage
Yeah million dollar nigga blow the money like a whistle
Take me where I wanna order steak up off the menu
Hard head nigga, know he gripping on a pistol, if you buy me a ring we can make this shit official
Fucking with me harder than your niggas, power couple yeah we all up on a mission
I know when you gotta handle business, you know imma be here waiting for you when you finish
Let's get it

She gon' ride it like a motorcycle, throw it back baby recycle
Bitch I'm bleeding like I'm on a cycle, I be leaning baby no NyQuil
And I can't stop it, keep going baby don't stop it
All my garments come from France, French kissing in France
Hundred thousand stuffed in my pants, money piling up like ants
And I can't stop it, keep going baby don't stop it
