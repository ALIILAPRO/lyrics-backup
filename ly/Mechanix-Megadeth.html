		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Imagine you were at my station
And you brought your motor to me
Your a burner yeah a real motor car
Said you wanna get your order filled
Made me shiver when I put it in
Pumping just won't do ya know luckily for you

Whoever thought you'd be better
At turning a screw than me
I do it for my life
Made my drive shaft crank
Made my pistons bulge
Made my ball bearing melt from the heat
Oh yeah yeah

We were shifting hard when we took off
Put tonight all four on the floor
When we hit top end you know it feels to slow
Said you wanna get your order filled
Made me shiver when I put it in
Pumping just won't do ya know luckily for you

Whoever thought you'd be better
At turning a screw than me
I do it for my life
Made my drive shaft crank
Made my pistons bulge
Made my ball bearing melt from the heat
Oh yeah yeah
Oh!

I'm giving you my room service
And ya know it's more than enough
Oh one more time ya know I'm in love

Whoever thought you'd be better
At turning a screw than me
I do it for my life
Made my drive shaft crank
Made my pistons bulge
Made my ball bearing melt from the heat
Oh yeah yeah!

Imagine you were at my station
And you brought your motor to me
With all four on the floor I feel what's in store

Whoever thought you'd be better
At turning a screw than me
I do it for my life
Made my drive shaft crank
Made my pistons bulge
Made my ball bearing melt from the heat
Oh yeah yeah!
