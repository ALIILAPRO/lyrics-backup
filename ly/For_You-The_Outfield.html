		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm so sad, feeling blue.
Since you left,
I've been missing you.
Need your love, Oh so bad,
Realize everything we had.

[Chorus]
All day, all night
You can have it anyway you want it.
One love, so right.
Don't you know that I live my life for you?

I was wrong, my mistake.
I regret, look at the price I paid.
Take these words, understand.
Try forgive me,
I'm a broken man.

[Chorus]

I'm so sad, feeling blue.
Since you left, I've been missing you.
Take these words, understand.
Try forgive me,
I'm a broken man.

[Chorus: x2]

For you,
You can have it anyway you want it.
For you
For you
