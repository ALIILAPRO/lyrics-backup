		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Flower's bloomin', mornin' dew
And the beauty seems to say
It's a pleasure when you treasure
All that's new and true and gay

Easy livin' and we're givin'
What we know we're dreamin' of
We are one havin' fun
Walkin' in the glow of love

Walking, ooh, whoa, ho oh whoa

Smilin' faces, goin' places
It's a wonder, it's so clear
By a fountain, climbin' mountains
As we'll hold each other near

Sippin' wine, we try to find
That special magic from above
As we share our affair
Talkin' in the glow of love

Oh, oh, ooh
In the glow of love
Ooh ooh ooh

(Here in glow of love) you're a shinin' star
(Here in glow of love) no matter who you are
(Here in glow of love) so I want to let you know you move me (here in glow of love), yeah, yeah

(There is no better way to be) hold me, caress me
(I'm yours forever and a day) we are a sweet bouquet, ey, hey
(Seasons for happiness are here) can you feel it all around you
(Reason we're filled with cheer is we're in rapture it in the glow) of love

Finding meaning while we're dreaming
Of the splendor of it all
We're surrounded and abound
It's summer, winter, spring and fall

All the people meeting people
Laughing, dancin' till the dawn
And we'll always be like this
Glowing in the glow of love

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
In the glow of love
Ooh ooh ooh

(Here in glow of love) gotta let you know you move me, yeah
(Here in glow of love) you really, really do, yeah
(Here in glow of love) I gotta let you know you move me, yeah
(Here in glow of love) oh, whoa, whoa

(There is no better way to be) hold you, love you
(I'm yours forever and a day) we are a sweet bouquet
(Seasons for happiness are here) happy we're so happy, yeah
(Reason we're filled with cheer is we'll imagine it in the glow) of love

Never lonely with you only
Time will always be our friend
Reaching far to find a star
Our destiny is heaven sent

Making known this lovin' tone
We'll never part, the two of us
We'll always reminisce
Kissin' in the glow of love

In the glow of love

Flower's bloomin', mornin' dew
And the beauty seems to say
It's a pleasure when you treasure
All that's new and true and gay

Easy livin' and we're givin'
What we know we're dreamin' of
We are one havin' fun
Walkin' in the glow of love

Yeah hey
