		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The room is filled with sin, would you let me in
tonight might be the night
As troubles disappear, the moon seems so near
beneath electric starlight

Don’t you miss your shadow?
Don’t you miss the ground?
You’re hiding from tomorrow
as the wheel spins, round and round

When your wings are burning
who keeps you from falling?

You fly higher
than your guardian angel
into the fire
dancing with danger

You place your bet with no regret
in this game of Russian Roulette

With nothing left to steal, nothing left to borrow
you’re playing on devil’s playground
looking for the end of the rainbow
there’s nothing to be found

Don’t you miss your shadow?
Don’t you miss the ground?
You’re hiding from tomorrow
as the wheel spins, round and round

When your wings are burning
who keeps you from falling?

You fly higher
than your guardian angel
into the fire
dancing with danger

You place your bet with no regret
in this game of Russian Roulette

It’s time to win and time to lose
time to kill the truth and change the rules
so keep the dice rolling
until I wake up or die

Come and play with me tonight
we are gamblers, you and I
so keep the dice rolling
until I wake up or die

It’s not an angel on your shoulder
whispering in your ear
You hear the things you wanna hear

The wheel of darkness spins in the game
where no one ever wins
Could this be how the end begins?

You fly higher
than your guardian angel
into the fire
dancing with danger

You place your bet with no regret
in this game of Russian Roulette
