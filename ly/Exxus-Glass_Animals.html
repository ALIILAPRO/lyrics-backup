		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When you see him
Look him in the eye, look him in the eye
And he won't dare to follow
If you need to
Hook him with your eye, hook him with your eye
'Til he wiggles and wallows

Sleeps atop a bag of raven's legs
Curled up rats napping by his head
Takes his eye out with a ball-point pen
Makes nunchaku with his torn off legs

Wake up with a hatchet over your head
You wake up with a hatchet over your head

I can see you running
I can see you running
Gone in the blink of my eye
Gone, gone, gone in the blink of my eye
I can see you running
I can see you running
Gone in the blink of my eye
Gone, gone, gone in the blink of my, blink of my eye

Open your eyes, choking on his breath
Choking on his breath, then grimace and smile
Take a toke of his wet cigarette
He picks your brains, you stub it on his chest

Slit his tongue with one fast hand
And stuff his mouth with salty sand
Tie his arms with hair from his head
Roll him 'round like a rusty can

Wake up with a hatchet over your head
You wake up with a hatchet over your head

I can see you running
I can see you running
Gone in the blink of my eye
Gone, gone, gone in the blink of my eye
I can see you running
I can see you running
Gone in the blink of my eye
Gone, gone, gone in the blink of my, blink of my, blink of my eye
