		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I cross my heart every night
I pray to god, every time
I think bad thoughts 
and i feel insecure with it all

I played my part in the lies
fate read my palm, every line
Heroine or villian
i push all my thoughts to the

to the back to the back of my mind
i keep it there, keep it out of sight
to the back to the back of my mind
until i feel my head spinning

The Dark Below
The pressure from the undertow
the words are written on the wall
but i take my time

I found my dark, in the light
I gave my last shred of time
counting my lost lover
drowning in lost troubles

I said goodbye to it all
i made you cry doubled down
heroine all villain 
i push all my thoughts to the

to the back to the back of my mind
i keep it there, keep it out of sight
to the back to the back of my mind
until i feel my head spinning
