		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I found myself laying down in the back of your car
I thought my world would feel newer, I guess I was wrong

So I ran home, the floor was lava
Cried in my dorm, I broke my promise
To my sister, said I'd wait for the one (one)

Then I hear my favorite song
I feel everything at once
It's so good, I forget that I'm drivin'
I don't know what I'm capable of
I just don't want ya
Know I said I did
I just don't need ya
I know I said I did

Maybe there's somethin' wrong with me
I've never been good at communicatin'
But the music makes me feel things you never did 
You don't understand, so we never had a chance

Then I ran home, the floor was lava
Cried in my dorm, I broke my promise
To my sister, said I'd wait for the one

Then I hear my favorite song
I feel everything at once
It's so good, I forget that I'm drivin'
I don't know what I'm capable of
I just don't want ya
Know I said I did
I just don't need ya
I know I said I did
