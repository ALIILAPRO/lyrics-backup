		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Boy I've been taking things that I don't want to take
Some in other doors and feel it's breaking me down
The feeling of a loss, I need to see she ain't
The feeling that I had before you took me right down
I ping you when I start to get a short high
Short amount of time before the birds fly by
The lighting in your room was always too low
We said our goodbyes before we said hello

In a small place, you changed me
In a crowded place, you isolated me

Just tell me the truth, it'll hurt less, I guess
Just tell me the truth, it'll hurt less, I guess

Boy you've been throwing shadows on a long flight
Just pulling my feet under, move my face from your side
The feeling always lingers past the comfortable state
Make stories up in my head, you can question them now
I touch you in the dark for satisfaction
There's life in my sentimental attraction
The lighting in your room was always star lit
Just tell me something right, babe, and I'll believe it

In a small place, you changed me
In a crowded place, you isolated me

Just tell me the truth, it'll hurt less, I guess
Just tell me the truth, it'll hurt less, I guess
Just tell me the truth, it'll hurt less, I guess
Just tell me the truth, it'll hurt less, I guess
Just tell me the truth, it'll hurt less, I guess
Just tell me the truth, it'll hurt less, I guess
Just tell me the truth, it'll hurt less, I guess
Just tell me the truth, it'll hurt less, I guess

I'm numb to the pain, there's no fire, there's no burn
The house down playing the [?]
Feed the ego
And will these eyes let me go? [x2]

Just tell me the truth, it'll hurt less, I guess
Just tell me the truth, it'll hurt less, I guess
Just tell me the truth, it'll hurt less, I guess
Just tell me the truth, it'll hurt less, I guess
Just tell me the truth, it'll hurt less, I guess
Just tell me the truth, it'll hurt less, I guess
Just tell me the truth, it'll hurt less, I guess
Just tell me the truth, it'll hurt less, I guess
