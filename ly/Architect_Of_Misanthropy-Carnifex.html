		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Locked away in the prison of your mind
To believe is to be
Our reality defined
Fighting for another day to waste
Value comes from purpose
Write your own fate
Fighting for another day to waste
In the end all we have is skeletal remains
This is the silent execution
You can’t save anything
If you can’t save yourself
It’s goodbye to everything
And we’ll watch heaven turn into hell
Bleed just to know you’re alive
I’ve watched death dance in silence
We are the walking dead
You can’t escape the violence
The hour of your death, is upon you
The hour of death, is upon us all
I’ve seen the void
I’ve writing it’s songs
Fate is all we’ve got
Let the demons of time, chase me
Let them rage within, me
To taste death
To the touch the void
I’ve seen true meaning
Man’s ego destroyed
Let demons of time chase me
I’ve watched death dance in silence
We are the walking dead
You can’t escape the violence
You can’t escape the violence
