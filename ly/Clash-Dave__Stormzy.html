		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Jordan 4s or Jordan 1s, Rolexes, got more than one
My AP cost thirty-one, millimeters, forty-one
Stick him up with a stick-stick, he drew the shorter one
You can't short me one, in the club with the shortest one
Lighty, the shortest one, on my mind, Jorja one
Crocodile bag, I bought her one, vegan ting, I slaughter one
Freaks, I got more than one, fuck, daddy and daughter one (One)
Tory puttin' in labor, this that Jeremy Corbin one

Awkward one, race me there, wait, hare, tortoise one
I need a ting, thirty plus, Blackberry and Walkman 1s
Look, I left my phone and my babies, silent mode
My guys on ridin' mode, zombies, survival mode
He's got a new vest? Man, pop that shield, no microphone
I'll ride for bro, he's next to I like typin' O
The score, 5 an 0, 6-to-1
For the kicks I love, twelve-fifty-four like 6-to-1
Babe, can't look at my mentions, that's Area 51
I'm so close to my pension, my left wrist is sixty-one
My left wrist retired, mm
My apprentice tryna give Alan Sugar, there's no way I can-

Jordan 4s or Jordan 1s, Rolexes, got more than one
My AP cost thirty-one, millimeters, forty-one
Stick him up with a stick-stick, he drew the shorter one
You can't short me one, in the club with the shortest one
Lighty, the shortest one, on my mind, Jorja one
Crocodile bag, I bought her one, vegan ting, I slaughter one
Freaks, I got more than one, fuck, daddy and daughter one (One)
Tory puttin' in labor, this that Jeremy Corbin one

Overrated one, most hated one
Slid 'round after his birthday, gave him a happy belated one
Burned that bridge, cremated one, boom-boom, bailiff one
Got away with murder, this that Viola Davis one
They stop and stare, watch rare, clear, stainless one
Debate this one, hatin' niggas gonna hate this one, ah
I live life on the high
Might fly to Dubai with the guys 'cause the weather's been shit
I can wear a different kettle every day of the month from a different-
Rollies, got twenty-one, I been lit since twenty-one
Girl, I need that gently one, that Savage and Fenty one, hmm
Dave's got the new Aston Martin plug, could you send me one?
He said "No need to be rentin' one"
Big Flex is inventin' one, cold, cold
My bros don't chat, we just wear all-black on a blend in one
Man are talkin' war, don't know 'bout war 'til you end in one
The machine got sweets, not the vending one
Needed a hit, could have penned him one, cah you're pendin' one
Aight, she wanna go to the cinema, so we just walk downstairs (walk downstairs)
The mortgage cleared, we've overtaken all our peers (all our peers)
After all these years, disrespect is all I hear
I'm Pep, I ball with flair
Off the set, they storm like, off the set, they storm like Piers
That's what I call mornin' tears
Them man are talkin' bare, but it's cool 'cause-

I got my ting so I'm more than good, anytime that I walk my hood
I got the Jordan 4s and 6s, all I need now is Jordyn Woods
Don't get caught for pus, don't die for nyash
We slide and crash, sixteen, don't write and clash
Sixteen, don't battlerap
She got the WAP and a wap, what are you thinkin'?
Mans on simpin', I'll buy her a car like a pair of-

Jordan 4s or Jordan 1s, Rolexes, got more than one
My AP cost thirty-one, millimeters, forty-one
Stick him up with a stick-stick, he drew the shorter one
You can't short me one, in the club with the shortest one
Lighty, the shortest one, on my mind, Jorja one
Crocodile bag, I bought her one, vegan ting, I slaughter one
Freaks, I got more than one, fuck, daddy and daughter one (One)
Tory puttin' in labor, this that Jeremy Corbin one
