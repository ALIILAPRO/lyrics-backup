		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bang bang

Could a body close the mind down
Stitch a seam across the eye
If you can be good you'll live forever 
If you're bad, you'll die when you die 

Hearing only one true note 
I'm the one and only sound 
Unzip my body, take my heart out 
'Cause I need a beat to give this tune

(Taking a picture of)
(Taking a picture of)
(Taking a picture of)
Bang Bang

Oh the body swayed to music 
Oh the lightning glance 
I would give it all, and all 
Maybe you would give me less for half a chance 

Hearing only one root note 
Planted firmly in the ground 
Undo my heart unzip my body and 
Lend to my ear a clear and a deafening sound 

(Unzip my heart) 

And if I need a rhythm 
It'll be to my heart I listen 
If it don't put me too far wrong
(And if I and if I)
And if I need a rhythm 
It will be to my heart I listen 
If it don't put me too far wrong

Everybody smile, please
Nobody pay no mind to me 
Finger in position on the switch 
A little flash photography 

Taking a picture of you
(To my heart) taking a picture of
Taking a picture of me 
Taking a picture

Ramalama, bang bang 
Flash bang
Big bang 
Bing bong 
Ding dong 
Dom dom do dom dom

With a hammer bang bang
Flash bang
Press gang 
Bing bong 
Ding dong
Hum hum ho Hum Hum

With a system of a bang bang 
Crash bang 
Big bang 
Boing boing 
Boing boing 
Dumb dumb do dumb dumb

With a system of a bang bang
Crash bang
Big bang
Boing boing 
Boing boing 
Dumb dumb do dumb dumb

Keep on, keep on
Keep on, keep on

And if I and if I need a rhythm (and if I need a rhythm)
Gonna be to my heart I listen
And if I and if I need a rhythm (and if I and if I need a rhythm)
It's gonna be to my heart I listen
And if I and if I need a rhythm (and if I and if I need a rhythm)
It's gonna be to my heart I listen
(Need a rhythm, in my heart a rhythm)(and if I) 
(Need a rhythm) 
(Need a rhythm)
(Need a rhythm)
(Need a rhythm)
 
And if I and if I need a rhythm (keep on, keep on)

Keep on, keep on
Keep on, keep on
