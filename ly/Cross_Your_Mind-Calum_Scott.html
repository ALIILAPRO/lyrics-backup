		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We haven't talked for a year or so
I can tell from your voice that it's not the call you wanted
If you were honest
And I heard from a friend that you're doing well
And you gave what you owe me to someone else
Well, you got it
I hope it's what you wanted

I've gotta live with the damage done
But I can't let you go 'cause you're in my blood

Tell me, do I ever cross your mind?
Do I ever keep you up at night?
Thinking 'bout what coulda been if we did it all again
I've been trying to keep an open door
Even though you've got the locks on yours
Tell me even after all of this time

Do I ever cross your mind like you cross mine?
Do I?
Oh, do I?

They say hurt people pass it 'round
I know that now, but I still don't understand you
God knows I tried to
Years ago, I used to blame myself
Hung all of my hopes on you then fell
And if you ever cared, I couldn't tell
Keeps me wondering

Tell me do I ever cross your mind?
Do I ever keep you up at night?
Thinking 'bout what coulda been if we did it all again
I've been trying to keep an open door
Even though you've got the locks on yours
Tell me even after all of this time

Do I ever cross your mind like you cross mine?
Do I?
Oh, do I?

Do I haunt your dreams
And your memories?
Do you hurt like me?
Oh, do I? Do I?
Do you wonder how
I've been doing now
Or are you good without?

Tell me do I ever cross your mind?
Do I ever keep you up at night?
Thinking 'bout what coulda been
If you'd been a better man
I've been trying to keep an open door
Even though you've got the locks on yours (locks on yours)
Tell me even after all of this time
Do I ever cross your mind (cross your mind) like you cross mind (you cross mind)
Do I?
Oh, do I?

Do I ever cross your mind (cross your mind) like you cross mind (you cross mind)
Do I? (Do I, do I)
Oh, do I?
