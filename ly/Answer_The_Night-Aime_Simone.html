		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Feels so right
When you look in my eyes
Shock my heart back to life
Yeah you answer the night
Break into light
Spark into fire
Make the stars align
I was losing
My mind
Chasing the truth
And I
I was dying to meet you
You found me in the deep end
You caught me on my last breath
I was in need of someone
Told me to kiss you right now
You found me there
And since that time
I've begun seeing the divine
Feeling your skin on mine
Feels so right
When you look in my eyes
Shock my heart back to life
Yeah you answer the night
Break into light
Spark into fire
Make the stars align
I've been so far gone
I've seen the silence inside
I've been down and out
I've stretched my hand to the sky
Baby
I
Can't be sad
You're by my side
You are the other
Half
My desire
You found me in the deep end
You caught me on my last breath
I was in need of someone
Told me to kiss you right now
You found me there
And since that time
I've begun seeing the divine
Feeling your skin on mine
Feels so right
When you look in my eyes
Shock my heart back to life
Yeah you answer the night
Break into light
Spark into fire
Make the stars align
I don't need to play it
I just wanna show ya
Wanna live to know ya
Falling into you I'm
Falling into you I'm
Falling into you I'm
Finding all the lights I
Never saw 'til
You
You
You
