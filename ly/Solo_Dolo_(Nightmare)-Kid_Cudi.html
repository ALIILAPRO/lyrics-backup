		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Listen good
I don't have nobody
But what I might feel are the sounds of sanity
Hoping what I hear, loops itself continuously
Then I wont be afraid
No no

Oh whoa whoa whoa
Why must it feel so wrong when I try and do right, do right
Oh whoa whoa whoa
Soaring through paradise when I'm closing my eyes
I'm, Mr. Solo Dolo
Oh oh oh
Oh oh

Look at me
You tell me
Just what you see
Am I, someone whom, you may love, or enemy
Am I speakin' for, you and yours, or someone else
I need some answers
Yeah yeah

Oh whoa whoa whoa
Why must it feel so wrong when I try and do right, do right
Oh whoa whoa whoa
Soaring through paradise when I'm closing my eyes
I'm, Mr. Solo Dolo
Oh oh oh
Oh oh

My world turns
Flippin' the bird
To the ones who figure, me
Outcast no not the duo
Back in Shaker heights
When they knew who
Though little brother was a strange one
Boo hoo
Cry me a river hater
Look who traveled out an igloo
Cold cold world wasn't fit for me at, all
Look at where I stand at
Tall, Cutcha' my Kid Cudi bisohs
Mute muthafucka' back home
Quick pause
Gargle on my mayo
Look at me I bet I'm the one you think to fail
Floatin' in my mind
No sail
Ahoy
Ahoy

Listen Good
I don't need nobody
This is what you feel are the sounds of insanity
Hopin' what I hear loops itself to finish me
No I wont be afraid
Hey hey

Oh whoa whoa whoa
Why must it feel so wrong when I try and do right, do right
Oh whoa whoa whoa
Soaring through paradise when I'm closing my eyes
I'm, Mr. Solo Dolo

Why must it feel so right when I know that it's wrong,
It's wrong
When will I ever learn from the words in my songs
I'm, Mr. Solo Dolo.
