		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been living here a billon years or more
You're ready to burn me up, so get set for war
My world's been set on fire, like a knife in the back
This is your final warning, prepare for attack

Can't you hear me crying
Get ready for the no zone
Get ready!

To bite the hand that feeds you, it's like a time bomb ready to blow
You scorch and rape the land, look at Borneo
Too much, too little, too late, chemicals take to the air
They're gonna burn another hole in the sky, you'd better say your
prayers

Can't you hear me crying
I'm trying to send a message out to you
It's time to put out the fire
Get ready for the no zone

Dream and pray, the ozone mustn't burn away
Try to run but you'll never hide, it's global suicide
Why aren't you listening to me
You'd better listen
I've been living here a billion years or more
You're ready to burn me up, so get set for war
My world's been set on fire, like a knife in the back
This is your final warning, prepare for attack

Can't you hear me crying
I'm trying to send a message out to you
It's time to put out the fire
Get ready for the no zone
