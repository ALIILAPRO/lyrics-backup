		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (It's a Wayne beat)
(Ah)
Oh yeah
Ayy

We get that load in and make the streets happy (happy)
Yellow coupe, brown guts, Jamaican beef patty (ooh)
I'm a hybrid, I'm business and street savy
Like she baby Tee sister, bitch callin' me daddy (slow down)
Twenty on his head got him put on a ten dollar shirt (he gone)
We get it in on our side, got it out the dirt (for real)
Out of town, where the drug man? Brodie need a Perc' (ASAP)
In your city, ridin' with them fifties, overly alert
I'm outside in the motherfuckin' AMG (yeah)
Got enough clips to shoot a movie, nigga, AMC (movie)
Call Baby Grizz' JAY-Z 'cause he bang B
Call HorseTheOne Russell Wilson 'cause he bang C (that's cuz)

We them niggas in the city that be floatin' (real floaters)
We them niggas 'round this bitch with all the motion (got motion)
Rich on the net, real life, niggas ain't on shit (catfish)
Tough on the net, real life, that boy a whole bitch (catfish)
We them niggas that ain't goin' back and forth (no back and forth)
Know how to get money, know how to go to war (we can do both)
Every time I get money, I want some more (we can do both)
Every time the opps let they guard down, they get torched (brrt)

First of all, I done seen it all, heard it all (heard it all, nigga)
Crackheads, heroin heads, I done served 'em all (served 'em all, nigga)
These niggas ain't tough, they're off Perkies, dawg (niggas bitches)
Please don't try that shit with us, you gon' get murdered, dawg (boom)
I'm the one that hold the bros when they do that time (facts)
I'm the one that's gon' go through the struggle and don't do no cryin', nigga (facts)
I'm the one gon' be your eyes, when you actin' blind (facts)
I'm the one that ain't supposed to, but still try to slide, nigga (let's go)
Booka said less than ten, that's a light year (that ain't shit)
All this dirt I had to do, it got the ice clear (VVs)
All the haters from my hood still right there (still right there)
Niggas said they did what? Yeah, right, where? (where?)

We them niggas in the city that be floatin' (real floaters)
We them niggas 'round this bitch with all the motion (got motion)
Rich on the net, real life, niggas ain't on shit (catfish)
Tough on the net, real life, that boy a whole bitch (catfish)
We them niggas that ain't goin' back and forth (no back and forth)
Know how to get money, know how to go to war (we can do both)
Every time I get money, I want some more (we can do both)
Every time the opps let they guard down, they get torched, nigga (brrt)
