		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What do you feel?
Too many emotions

Yeah
Hey, hey, yeah

I feel too many emotions (emotions)
I feel too many emotions (emotions)
Wish I could make the pain vanish (vanish)
They always misunderstand me (misunderstand me)
Sometimes I wanna leave this planet (planet)
Sometimes I wanna leave this planet (this planet)

Energy shift
Said you wouldn't change, but you changed so quick (quick)
This shit insane, I'm just raisin' awareness (yup)
I'm a different kind of creature, you better beware of him
Ain't no bringin' back that boy, because he gone, gone
Not for the weak hearted, 'cause this right here that strong, strong
It's startin' to feel like I'm surrounded by a bunch of clones
Told that, told that bitch just leave me 'lone ('lone, 'lone)
Aviator Cartiers, I can't see nobody in the party, yeah (party, yeah)
Shawty been on my body like a cardigan (cardigan)
Conversations in my head, no, not again, no, not again
It's one big misunderstandin' ('standin')
But why the fuck you tryna slander? (Slander)
I lost some motherfucking family (family)
It's more crazy then I ever could've planned it (imagine, yeah)

I feel too many emotions (emotions)
I feel a million emotions (emotions)
Wish I could make the pain vanish (vanish, yeah)
They always misunderstand me (misunderstand me)
Sometimes I wanna leave this planet (this planet)
Them voices in my head, they keep on on sayin' that (I'm sayin' that)

And I feel my stars alignin'
But I'm still havin' trouble decidin'
It's like nobody understands me
Late nights when the liquor comes in handy
Hey, you wouldn't believe what I been plannin'
My demons talkin', they just wanna see me crashin'
I can't feel my heart beatin' in my chest
Call the cardiologist
I wanna tell you how I feel, but I know it won't make sense
Turnin' to the drugs like a therapist
'Cause I feel so lonely, sometimes I mute my emotions

I feel too many emotions (emotions)
I feel too many emotions (emotions)
Wish I could make the pain vanish (vanish)
They always misunderstand me (misunderstand me)
Sometimes I wanna leave this planet (planet)
Sometimes I wanna leave this planet (this planet)

I feel too many emotions (emotions)
I feel a million emotions (emotions)
Wish I could make the pain vanish (vanish, yeah)
They always misunderstand me (misunderstand me)
Sometimes I wanna leave this planet (this planet)
Them voices in my head, they keep on on sayin' that (I'm sayin' that)

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah
