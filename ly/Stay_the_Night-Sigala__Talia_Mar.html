		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Stay the night
Baby, we can bring the music back to life
Just you and I
Stay the night
Even if we both get lost inside the lights
We'll be alright

Stay the n-night, night, night
The n-night, night, night
The n-night, night

Yeah, I've been missing you

Feels like we're back in July and
We're touching down on the island
Still got that look in your eye, mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm

I, I, I, I, I
I feel like you just left the room
You're right here and I'm missing you
I, I, I, I, I
I'm missing you
I'm missing you

So stay the night
Baby, we can bring the music back to life
Just you and I
Stay the night
Even if we both get lost inside the lights
We'll be alright

So stay the night
Baby, we can bring the music back to life
Just you and I
So stay the night
Even if we both get lost inside the lights
We'll be alright

Stay the n-night, night, night
The n-night, night, night
The n-night, night

'Cause I've been missing you

Stay the n-night, night, night
The n-night, night, night
The n-night, night

Yeah, I've been missing you

Bring back the fire, can we just
Still stay those kids in Ibiza?
Late nights and too much tequila, mmm-hmm

I, I, I, I, I
I feel like you just left the room
You're right here and I'm missing you
I, I, I, I, I
I'm missing you
I'm missing you

So stay the night
Baby, we can bring the music back to life
Just you and I
So stay the night (the night)
Even if we both get lost inside the lights (inside the lights)
We'll be alright (be alright)

Stay the n-night, night, night
The n-night, night, night
The n-night, night (oh)

Stay the n-night, night, night
The n-night, night, night
The n-night, night

Yeah, I've been missing you

Stay the n-night, night, night
The n-night, night, night
The n-night, night, night
