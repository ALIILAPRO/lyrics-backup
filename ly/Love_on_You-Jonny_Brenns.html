		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Grab my hand
Kiss my neck
Hold me close
Hold my breath
Touch my lips
And call me yours
Love me loud, love me loud as a lion's roar
Woah, feel my soul reaching in
Don't you see what we've become
And I just want to love on you
Take me to the top, I'm ready for it
I just want to love on you
Feel the heat in the sheets, I'm ready for it
Take me to the top, I'm ready for it
I just want to love on you
So take your heart
And make it mine
Stare at you
And run my fingers down your spine
I look at you
And hold on tight
And I see that everything is alright
Feel my soul reaching in
Don't you see what we've become
And I just want to love on you
Take me to the top, I'm ready for it
I just want to love on you
Feel the heat in the sheets, I'm ready for it
Take me to the top, I'm ready for it
I just want to love
To touch
The way you make feel
Oh baby
It's such a rush
The way your body
Is moving with me
I just want to love on you
I just want to love on you
