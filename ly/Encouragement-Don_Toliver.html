		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I guess I never, ever felt like

Who the hell encouraged them?
I guess you heard him
He got too many cars, oh, he went and worried them
Step back and let it pop, I'm on my Curry now
Why you over there, watchin' and recordin' him?
Niggas real weirdos, hangin' with them other type of bitches, yeah, I fear those
Only time she cry is on her pill and on her pillow
Yeah, it makes sense
I ain't never, ever seen a bitch pay rent
Probably when some other type of nigga ain't shit
Yeah, you been swingin' for the fence (ooh)

I never, ever felt like this
I never, ever felt like
I never, ever felt like this
I guess I never, ever felt like (never ever felt like)
Guess I never, ever felt like this, this
Felt like this (woo)
I guess I never, ever felt like
I guess I never, ever felt like this, this, this, this, oh-oh (wow)
Felt like this

Who the hell encouraged them?
I guess you heard him
He got too many cars, oh, he went and worried them
Step back and let it pop, I'm on my Curry now
Why you over there, watchin' and recordin' him?
Niggas real weirdos, hangin' with them other type of bitches, yeah, I fear those
Only time she cry is on her pill and on her pillow
Yeah, it makes sense
I ain't never, ever seen a bitch pay rent
Probably when some other type of nigga ain't shit
Yeah, you been swingin' for the fence (ooh)

Niggas drive McLaren truck, where the engine is?
Tote a Goyard brief for all my businesses
I been the same nigga, where my witnesses?
I moved to L.A. and been a sinner since
I flew here Jetport, shout out to Powerlay (shout out to Powerlay)
Remember when Ye said I was timeless (said I was timeless)
Same time, me and Travis out for our tier
I think back like "Damn, I really had a good year"
A lot of blood, sweat, and hard motherfuckin' tears (fuckin' tears)
Me and Kali finna double back, a great years (great years)
