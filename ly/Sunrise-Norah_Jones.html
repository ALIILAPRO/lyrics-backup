		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sunrise, sunrise
Looks like mornin' in your eyes
But the clock's held 9:15 for hours
Sunrise, sunrise
Couldn't tempt us if it tried
'Cause the afternoon's already come and gone

And I said
Hoo, ooh, ooh, ooh
Hoo, ooh, ooh, ooh
Hoo, ooh, ooh, ooh
To you

Surprise, surprise
Couldn't find it in your eyes
But I'm sure it's written all over my face
Surprise, surprise
Never something I could hide
When I see we made it through another day

Then I say
Hoo, ooh, ooh, ooh
Hoo, ooh, ooh, ooh
Hoo, ooh, ooh, ooh
To you

Now the night
Will throw its cover down
On me again
Ooh, and if I'm right
It's the only way
To bring me back

Hoo, ooh, ooh, ooh
Hoo, ooh, ooh, ooh
Hoo, ooh, ooh, ooh
To you
Hoo, ooh, yeah
Hoo, ooh, ooh, ooh
Hoo, ooh, ooh, ooh
To you
