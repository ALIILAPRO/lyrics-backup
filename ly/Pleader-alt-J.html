		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How green, how green was my valley?
To be told of such hills
To be held in such spots
To behold such warmth
Call to arms these harmonies!
And in happy agony we sing
How green, how green was my valley?

How green, how green was my valley?
Oh, your deeps and your shades
Where the wild roses pray
Such heat from pride
Glorious, the voice of man!
Like the nightingales, we sing
How green, how green was my valley?

How green, how green was my valley?
Clear softness in our hymn
Soft, like coming rain
Soft, like Bronwen
Victoria! Victoria!
Voices our queen might envy
How green, how green was my valley?
How green, how green was my valley?
