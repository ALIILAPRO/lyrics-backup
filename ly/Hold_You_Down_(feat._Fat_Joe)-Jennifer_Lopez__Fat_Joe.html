		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now you been holding me down
Hmm, for such a long time now
From back then 'till now in my story
Straight from the hood you've always been there for me

And you had my back when they
Back when everybody said I wasn't anything
It was you that kept me holding on, no matter what was going on
So whatever you need I got you yeah

Reminiscing that 6 train from way back
Now it's sky blue Phantoms and stretch Maybachs
For sweepin' them floors in them Bronx apartments
Mira esta que on the red carpet
When Pun died you was the first to call me
I never told you, but you was there for me
Whatever you need, I be there for you
Crack, I got ya back, for real, true story

Now my loyalty will always be
With you if you just promise me
That you'll stay real just like you are
'Cause baby you don't have to change no

You don't know how much you mean to me
Whenever your down you know that you can lean on me
No matter the situation, boy I'm gon' hold you down

You don't know how much you mean to me
Whenever your down you know that you can lean on me
No matter the situation, girl I'm gon' hold you down

Yo, 2005, Rakim and Jody Watley
Watch me paint a picture so perfect quite possibly
The realest freshest from BX to South beach
I'ma always hold you down, girl you can count on me

So remember this whenever I call
We go back too far, we been through it all
Even though, we haven't spoken so long
Ain't nothing change, not a damn thing baby

Now my loyalty will always be
With you if you just promise me
That you'll stay real just like you are
'Cause baby you don't have to change no ('cause you don't know)

You don't know how much you mean to me
Whenever your down you know that you can lean on me
No matter the situation, boy I'm gon' hold you down

You don't know how much you mean to me
Whenever your down you know that you can lean on me
No matter the situation, girl I'm gon' hold you down

Like green is the autumn, some things must stay
This industry yeah I'm far to make me this way
Get between me and J-Lo, I simply stay
You better off sweepin' leaves on a windy day

So I don't care about the situation
I'ma ride for you if there's a complication
'Cause every time you had my back and all
When we were young, now you're Joey crack and all
Now my loyalty will always be
With you if you just promise me
That you'll stay real just like you are
'Cause baby you don't have to change because

You don't know how much you mean to me
Whenever you're down you know that you can lean on me
No matter the situation, boy I'm gon' hold you down

You don't know how much you mean to me
Whenever you're down you know that you can lean on me
No matter the situation, girl I'm gon' hold you down

You don't know how much you mean to me
Whenever you're down you know that you can lean on me
No matter the situation, I'm gon' hold you down

You don't know how much you mean to me
Whenever you're down you know that you can lean on me
No matter the situation, I'm gon' hold you down

Hold you down
Down, down
I'm gon' hold you down
Oh
You down
