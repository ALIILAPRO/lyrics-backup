		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Where did you go?
My love
Where did you go?
My love
My love
Where did you go my love?
Where did you go?
I can’t see you no more
I don’t know what I did wrong
I don’t know what I did wrong
But I can’t see you no more
Where did you go?
My love
My love
I can’t see you no
No more
Where did you go my love?
Where did you go?
I can’t see you no more
Where did you go my love?
Where did you go?
I can’t see you no more
Where are you love?
I can’t find your love
Tell me what to do
Tell me what to do
Because I can’t find your love
Where did you go my love?
Where did you go?
I can’t see you no more
Where did you go my love?
Where did you go?
I can’t see you no more
