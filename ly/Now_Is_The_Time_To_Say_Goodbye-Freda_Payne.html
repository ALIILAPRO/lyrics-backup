		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now the time has come for us to say goodbye
When you walk away, keep on going
Don't look ba-a-ack
Don't want you to see me crying
'Cause then you wouldn't wanna leave
And you wanna feel sorry for me
And that would hurt even more

So hurry, be on your way
Don't worry about me, I'll be alright
In this cold world, I'll survive
Least I try-y-y
To pick up the pieces of my shattered life
But when you told me you loved another,
I think I need all the time

Oooh--------------------
The clock ticks on, the hour is drawing near
But for me, the time would stop 
When you walk out of here

Ohhhhhhhh, oh, what will I do then?
Oh my darlin', oh my darlin', how will I begin?
How do I start my life over when I've given everything I had
To that special someone, build my world around him
Then he tells me he doesn't want me, oh
How much more can one woman take?
Walk on, baby
Leave me but I still let ya, uh
Go on, get out of my life
