		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Remind me I'm golden 
The fortress above the sun 
Why don't you spend nowhere with me? 
Follow the river and the path of the ones trying the names 

Of the shore 

Forever I can't find 
Struggling in a world of this fine 
Or this life 
I don't want it to be 
I'm not in to live  

Fly into the distance 
Disappear for a while 
I don't know the sence of this 
But it is too late feeling alive 

Destruction for the power 
Let me take control (Eliminance) 

This is nothing more 
Something now you'll find again (Deliver us) 
Can't live the worse, you say? 

Does it really matter? 
I'd give the world to you if you just 

Fly into the distance 
Disappear for a while 
I can't make sense of this 
Are we there to take a ride? 

Fly into the distance 
Disappear for a while 
I can't make sense of this 
But we're in to take a ride
