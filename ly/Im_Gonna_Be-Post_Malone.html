		  Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?

Pop the top, fill my cup up, yeah
Keep 'em pourin' 'til I'm fucked up, oh yeah
Diamond Simon with my shirt tucked, yeah
Mink was 80K that's fucked up, oh yeah (wow)
Hey, I'll rock the shit but not for long (not for, not for long)
Then I'll go cop another one ('nother one)
Some people think I'm livin' wrong (livin' wrong, hey, hey)
We live this life but not for long, so

I'm gonna be what I want, what I want, what I want, yeah (yeah)
I'm gonna do what I want, when I want, when I want, yeah (yeah)
I'm goin' hard 'til I'm gone, 'til I'm gone
'Til I'm gone, yeah (gone, yeah)
Can you feel it? 
Can you feel it?
I'm gonna be what I want, what I want
What I want, yeah (I wanna be)
I'm gonna do what I want, when I want
When I want, yeah (I wanna be)
I'm goin' hard 'til I'm gone, 'til I'm gone 
'Til I'm gone, yeah ('til I'm gone, 'til I'm gone)
Can you feel it? (uh huh)
Can you feel it? (uh huh)

Hey, why you so mad? (why you so mad?)
Never look back (never look back)
Can't let up the gas, we movin' so fast, yeah, let's make it last
Yeah, I'm on to you, mm-mm (damn)
You're too comfortable, aye aye
Who you talkin' to, mm-mm
Ain't no time for you, aye (ooh)
I do what I want, Tom Ford on the yacht, ooh (wow)
Richard Mille my watch, thousand dollar Crocs, ooh (ooh)
They tryna tell me that it's luck
You probably think I made it up
I got it all, it ain't enough
But I'm still gonna run it up, so (ooh)

I'm gonna be what I want, what I want 
What I want, yeah (what I want)
I'm gonna do what I want, when I want 
When I want, yeah (what I want, what I want, yeah)
I'm goin' hard 'til I'm gone, 'til I'm gone
'Til I'm gone, yeah ('til I'm gone, 'til I'm gone, 'til I'm gone)
Can you feel it? (ooh) 
Can you feel it? (hey)
I'm gonna be what I want, what I want 
What I want, yeah (what I want, what I want)
I'm gonna do what I want, when I want 
When I want, yeah (what I want, what I want)
I'm goin' hard 'til I'm gone, 'til I'm gone
'Til I'm gone, yeah ('til I'm gone, 'til I'm gone, 'til I'm gone)
Can you feel it? (ooh) 
Can you feel it?

Ever since I got a taste I've been goin' (goin')
Every chip out on the table bitch I'm all in (aye)
I'm gonna be (aye)
I'm gonna be (bitch, I'm gonna be)

I'm gonna be what I want, what I want
What I want, yeah (God damn, God damn)
I'm gonna do what I want, when I want 
When I want, yeah (what I want, what I want)
I'm goin' hard 'til I'm gone, 'til I'm gone,
'Til I'm gone, yeah ('til I'm gone, 'til I'm gone, 'til I'm gone)
Can you feel it? (Can you feel it?)
Can you feel it? (Feel it)
Can you feel it?

Can you feel it?
Can you feel it? (I wanna be)
Can you feel it?
