		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Dating Courtesy: A girl is right to
Assume her date will perform little
Acts of courtesy which are his
Privilege if you are smart
You will allow him to open doors and
Hold chairs don't barge on ahead like
A baby elephant you'll get
Attention all right
But it won't be favorable it is
Correct to pause and let
Him know you expect him to
Act like a gentleman
He'll love it and think you're a lady
And in return it will
Flatter his masculine ego)

(For you, I wonder if)

Excuse me for a second
While I bang my head against this wall
And I'm starting to suspect
You don't intend to do what you say at all
Forgive your loyal sycophant
For leaving lipstick stains upon your shoes

And I wasted all my favorite melodies
(for you)
And watched best friends turn to enemies
(for you)
You heard I like the bad girls baby
Maybe that's true
For everybody else except (for you)

Excuse me miss, but isn't this
Your naked body in my bed?
And how come it always felt like
You were taking something away
When you were giving head?
And it's a promise and a threat
To say the "F" word
So be careful who you screw
And I used up all this latent energy
(for you) tell me was everything you ever
Said to me just (for you)
Still thinking there was something
In a girl's underwear that could change me
Like I was still in middle school
Like a fool (for you)

Lonesome poets throwing glitter in their hair
Doing somersaults and exploding in mid-air
But you don't ever notice or you don't care
Or both
And when they take off all their clothes
Were they still not close enough? (for you)
