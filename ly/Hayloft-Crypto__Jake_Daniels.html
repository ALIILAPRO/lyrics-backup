		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  Intro -

My daddy's got a gun 
My daddy's got a gun 
My daddy's got a gun

Verse -

It started with the hayloft a-creakin'
Well it just started in the hay - LOFT
With his long johns on, Pop went a-creeping 
Out to the barn, up to the hay
Young lovers and they are not sleeping 
Young lovers in the hay - LOFT
With his gun turned on, Pop went a-creeping 
Out to the barn, up to the hay - LOFT

Hook -

My daddy's got a gun 
My daddy's got a gun 
My daddy's got a gun 
You better run
My daddy's got a gun 
My daddy's got a gun 
My daddy's got a gun 
Ga - ga - ga - ga - ga

Verse 2-

It started with the hayloft a-creakin'
Well it just started in the hay
With his long johns on, Pop went a-creeping 
Out to the barn, up to the hay
Young lovers with their legs tied up in knots 
Young lovers with their legs tied up in knots 
With his long, tall gun, Pop went a-creeping 
To blow their hay-loft dead heads straight off

Hook 2 -

My daddy's got a gun 
My daddy's got a gun 
My daddy's got a gun
You better run
My daddy's got a gun 
My daddy's got a gun 
My daddy's got a gun 
Ga - ga - ga - ga - ga 
My daddy's got a gun 
My daddy's got a gun 
My daddy's got a gun 
You better run
My daddy's got a gun 
My daddy's got a gun 
My daddy's got a gun 
Ga - ga - ga - ga - ga

Bridge -

Ahh. yaa.ah. ya 
Ahh. yaa. Ah. ya

Verse 3-

Whatever happened to the young, young lovers?
One got shot and the other got lost in
Drugs and punks and blood on the street
Blood, blood on her knees
Bloody history (yeah)Whatever happened to the hayloft? 
Burnt to the ground, and what about Pop?
He took his ass back to the crack shack
With his long johns on, singing that old song

Hook 3 -

My daddy's got a gun 
My daddy's got a gun 
My daddy's got a gun 
You better run
My daddy's got a gun 
My daddy's got a gun 
My daddy's got a gun 
Ga - ga - ga - ga - ga 
My daddy's got a gun 
My daddy's got a gun 
My daddy's got a gun 
You better run
My daddy's got a gun
My daddy's got a gun 
My daddy's got a gun 
Ga - ga - ga - ga - ga
