		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Are you recording?
Yeah

I watched a movie scene, got déjà vu
'Cause the antagonist looked just like you
It's such a pretty thing, but I see right through
You got a dark side, well, I got a dark side too

Ayy, I don't trust a soul, not even dead ones (dead ones)
All it took was leavin' me on read once (read once)
You still try to call me when you get drunk (get drunk)
'Cause out of all your exes, I'm the best one

(I'm like mm-mm-mm, I don't care)

I want you to know that you can't come back
I want you to know that fake love don't last
So go ahead and pose like that and post like that
I, I wanna, I-I
I want you to know that you can't come back
I want you to know that fake love don't last
So go ahead and pose like that and post like that
I, I wanna, I-I

She said she didn't wanna go too fast
Guess the money made her push that gas
Found someone to trade her love for cash
Oh, oh
She been throwing shots, I had to catch one (catch one)
Gamble with my life, I'm here to bet some (bet some)
Made some bad decisions, don't regret one
Never learn my lesson, yeah, I don't respect none

I'm like uh-uh-uh, I don't care

I want you to know that you can't come back
I want you to know that fake love don't last
So go ahead and pose like that and post like that (okay)
I, I wanna, I-I
I want you to know that you can't come back
I want you to know that fake love don't last
So go ahead and pose like that (yeah) and post like that (ayy)
I, I wanna, I-I, I wanna

Ooh, you're so fake now (you're so fake now)
Ooh, it won't last, no (it won't last, no)
Yeah, you're so fake now (you're so fake now)
It won't, it won't last

Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
