		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You took me to school
On the bar of your bike
Every morning

We climbed Pen-y-ghent
Heard the rain on our tent
And birds singing 

And every time I’m joking 
I throw my head back 
And laugh like you did 
A playful big kid 
Who I’ve loved all my

You sat by my bed
When I was too scared 
Read the paper 

You knew what to say
When life went astray
Made it better 

And every time I’m laughing 
I throw my head back
Just like my old man
My darling sweet dad
Who I’ve loved all my

Don’t worry about us
We’ll look after to mum
Your little darling 

And every time we’re hurting
We’ll take ourselves back
To the way that you laughed
Our kind gentle dad
Who we’ll love for the rest of our lives
