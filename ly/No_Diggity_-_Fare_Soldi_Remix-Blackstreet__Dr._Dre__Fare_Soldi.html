		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
You know what
I like the playettes
No diggity, no doubt
Play on playette
Play on playette
Yo Street, drop the verse

Shorty get down, good lord
Baby got 'em up open all over town
Strictly biz, she don't play around
Cover much ground, got game by the pound
Getting paid is her forte
Each and every day, true player way
I can't get her out of my mind
I think about the girl all the time
East side to the west side
Pushin' phat rides, it's no surprise
She got tricks in the stash
Stacking up the cash
Fast when it comes to the gas
By no means average
She's on when she's got to have it
Baby, you're a perfect ten, I wanna get in
Can I get down, so I can win

I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, bag it up
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, bag it up
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, bag it up
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, bag it up

She's got class and style
Street knowledge by the pound
Baby never act wild, very low key on the profile
Catchin' feelings is a no
Let me tell you how it goes
Curve's the words, spins the verbs
Lovers it curves so freak what you heard
Rollin' with the phatness
You don't even know what the half is
You gotta pay to play
Just for shorty, bang-bang, to look your way
I like the way you work it
Trumped tight all day, every day
You're blowing my mind, maybe in time
Baby, I can get you in my ride

I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, bag it up
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, bag it up
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, bag it up

Hey oh, hey oh, hey oh, hey oh (hey yo that girl looks good)
Hey oh, hey oh, hey oh, hey oh (play on, play on, play on)
Hey oh, hey oh, hey oh, hey oh (you're my kind of girl)
Hey oh, hey oh, hey oh, hey oh (hey yay oh)

'Cause that's my peeps and we row g
Flyin' first class from New York City to Blackstreet
What you know about me, not a motherfuckin' thing
Cartier wooded frames sported by my shorty
As for me, icy gleaming pinky diamond ring
We be's the baddest clique up on the scene
Ain't you getting bored with these fake ass broads
I shows and proves, no doubt, I be taking you, so
Please excuse, if I come across rude
That's just me and that's how the playettes got to be
Stay kickin' game with a capital G
Axe the peoples on my block, I'm as real as can be
Word is bond, faking jacks never been me
So, Teddy, pass the word to your nigga Chauncey
I be sitting in car, let's say around three thirty
Queen Pen and Blackstreet, it's no diggity (no diggity, no doubt, babe)

I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, bag it up (girl, you got it going on)
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, bag it up (play on, play on,play on)
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, bag it up (hey, ooh)
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (hey, yeah, babe)

Yeah, ya don't stop
Yeah
Right
Blackstreet, 9-6, son, what
All-Star remix
Play on, play on, 'cause I like it
No diggity, no doubt
We out, we out
We out, we out
