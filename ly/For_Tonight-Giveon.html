		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We've been done
Long before it all began
Still can't give it up
Lead me on
But leave before the morning comes
Even though it's what we want
Can't keep this up for long

But I just, I just don't wanna leave you
Might just, might just throw away the reasons why
We both can't lay here
And secret, secret, both gotta keep it
Honest, honest, that's just a game we know
We both can't play

For tonight, I'm yours
So deny the truth
We'll stay behind closed doors
'Cause all I wanna do is lie with you
Even though it's wrong to lie with you

We've become numb to what we know is wrong
But no one knows but us
The feelings rush every single time we touch
Even though it's what we want 
Can't keep this up for long

But I just, I just don't wanna leave you
Might just, might just throw away the reasons why
We both can't lay here
And secret, secret, both gotta keep it
Honest, honest, that's just a game we know (know)
We both can't play

For tonight, I'm yours (I'm yours)
So deny the truth (deny the truth)
We'll stay behind closed doors
'Cause all I wanna do is lie (lie) with you

For tonight, I'm yours
So deny the truth
We'll stay behind closed doors
'Cause all I wanna do is lie with you
Even though it's wrong, I'll lie with you
