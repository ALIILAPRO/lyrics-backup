		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't ever wanna fall in love
Do you still want me though
I swear that I'll change for you
But for now all you do is make me blue
Baby we can go anywhere
You can trust me if you want to I promise not to share
And I got a show to go to, can you wait there
I don't want to, said I don't want to want to
Can you wait for me, just wait for me
Baby we can go anywhere
You can trust me if you want to I promise not to share
And I got a show to
