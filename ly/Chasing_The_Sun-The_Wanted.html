		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm better, so much better now
I see the lights touch the light
We're together now

I'm better, so much better now
Look to the skies
Give me life
We're together now

We've only just begun
Hypnotized by drums
Until forever comes
You'll find us chasing the sun

They said this day wouldn't come
We refused to run
We've only just begun
You'll find us chasing the sun

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
You'll find us chasing the sun 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
You'll find us chasing the sun 

And when they say light's fading
We're gonna play in the dark
'Til it's golden again
And now it feels so amazing
Can't see you coming
And we'll never grow old again
You'll find us chasing the sun

I'm never, I'm never down
Lying here, staring up
And you're looking down
I'm never, I'm never down
Live forever, forever
With you around

We've only just begun
Hypnotized by drums
Until forever comes
You'll find us chasing the sun

They said this day wouldn't come
We refused to run
We've only just begun
You'll find us chasing the sun
The sun, the sun, the sun, the sun, the sun, the sun
You'll find us chasing the sun

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
You'll find us chasing the sun
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
You'll find us chasing the sun

And when they say light's fading
We're gonna play in the dark
'Til it's golden again

And now it feels so amazing
Can't see you coming
And we'll never grow old again
You'll find us chasing the sun

Oh oh oh oh (Chasing the sun)
Oh oh oh oh oh (Chasing the sun)
Oh oh oh oh oh (You'll find us chasing the sun)
Oh oh oh oh oh

You'll find us chasing the sun

And when they say light's fading 
We're gonna play in the dark 
'Til it's golden again 

And now it feels so amazing 
Can't see you coming 
And we'll never grow old again 
You'll find us chasing the sun

Oh oh oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh 
You'll find us chasing the sun
Oh oh oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh 
You'll find us chasing the sun
