		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I want your lips, lips on my lips
But nobody has to see this
So listen to me

I want your lips, lips on my lips
But nobody has to see this
So listen to me

I want your lips, lips on my lips
But nobody has to see this
So listen to me

I want your lips, lips on my lips
But nobody has to see this
So listen to me

I can imagine
Your love around me
It took my breath away

Wish I could tell you
If I could see you
Whats going on with me

I want your lips, lips on my lips
But nobody has to see this
So listen to me

I want your lips, lips on my lips
But nobody has to see this
So listen to me

So come and find me
I’ll let you have it
I know you like this way

No hesitation
Just stick around me
Won’t let you go away

I want your lips, lips on my lips
But nobody has to see this
So listen to me

I want your lips, lips on my lips
But nobody has to see this
So listen to me

So tell me what you want
I got no time for games

I could stay away
From your touch, no longer

I want your lips, lips on my lips
But nobody has to see this
So listen to me

I want your lips, lips on my lips
But nobody has to see this
So listen to me
