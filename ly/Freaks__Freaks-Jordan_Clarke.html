		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been locked in the locker
I was picked last in soccer
And they say that it's all fun
But their fun, it ain't fun, man, I'm done
And I know we're all different
Our beliefs and religions
But I don't see the difference
In me, you
Yo, tú
Or moi, vous

So if you've had enough, then

Come to the land of the lost and lonely
Don't be afraid, we'll be one big family
Of freaks like you and me
I know a place where the bruised and broken
Live like the kings and the queens of tragedy
Just freaks like you and me
We are the freaks

I've been kicked down in the dirt
I pretend that it don't hurt
And I know that they're just words
But sticks, stones, they break bones
But just know
We could all be disciples
And we'll write our own Bible
We'll put freaks in the title
It's me, you 
Yo, tú
And moi, vous

So if you've had enough, then

Come to the land of the lost and lonely
Don't be afraid, we'll be one big family
Of freaks like you and me
I know a place where the bruised and broken
Live like the kings and the queens of tragedy
Just freaks like you and me
We are the freaks

F-R-E-A-K-S, we are the freaks (na-na-na, na-na-na)
(Na-na-na, na-na-na)
(We are the freaks)

Come to the land of the lost and lonely
Don't be afraid, we'll be one big family
Of freaks like you and me
I know a place where the bruised and broken
Live like the kings and the queens of tragedy
Just freaks like you and me

Come home
Where you can be you, I can be me
We'll never leave, 'cause we are the freaks
Come home
Where you can be you, I can be me
We'll never leave, 'cause we are the freaks
We are the freaks
