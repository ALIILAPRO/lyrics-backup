		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I hit 'em with the boots in July
Bitch, I don't need snow
I gotta go bigger, I gotta go bigger
Five thousand on a coat cause it's fly
No, I don't speak broke
Still, I gotta go bigger, fuckin' go figure

There's an aching, there's a hole in my chest
It's amazing that the crown of a king doesn't change me
It's amazing

Baby, that we all want, we all need fashion
Baby, that we all want, we all need fashion
Have I lost control? A voice says I might need my soul
But that's when I remember
That we all want, we all need fashion

Lost in it, livin' life through a phone
Now it's all I know
I gotta go bigger, I gotta go bigger
Yeah, five million dollar mans
It's a cure, stuck in high school mode
Still, I gotta go bigger, fuckin' go figure

There's an aching, there's a hole in my chest
It's amazing that the crown of a king doesn't change me
It's amazing

Baby, that we all want, we all need fashion
Baby, that we all want, we all need fashion
Have I lost control? A voice says I might need my soul
But that's when I remember
That we all want, we all need fashion

Might be gold, but that shit's still a chain
Might be gold, but that shit's still a chain
Might be gold, that shit's still a chain
Might be gold, but that shit's still a...

Baby, that we all want, we all need fashion
Baby, that we all want, we all need fashion
Have I lost control? A voice says I might need my soul
But that's when I remember
That we all want, we all need fashion

Might be gold, that shit's still a chain
Might be gold, that shit's still a chain
Might be gold, that shit's still a chain
Might be gold, might be gold
