		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I am watching you
Watching the way you watch people do
The things that they do
As you grow older - learning
Child understanding
About the way that a soul on a soul on a soul can be born
Can be beautiful

Child, understanding
I see the smile that lights your face
When you understand and realise,
Oh child, in this world
Strange how we forget the things that made us first smile

Ho hey, never stop learning
Ho hey, never stop wandering
Baby's growing older
Oh my child never stop learning


And I'm learning too
About the way that people do
The things that they do
Never meaning to hurt anyone
But we all do things we regret
And wish we'd never done
Oh child, and there you are
Wandering through the garden of life
Picking up flowers and eating them
And the world will smile when you smile
And we all have smiles inside of us

Ho hey, never stop learning
Ho hey, never stop wandering
Baby's growing older
Oh my child never stop learning
Now baby, baby, yeah- don't you ever stop learning
Baby, baby, yeah - don't you ever stop learning
