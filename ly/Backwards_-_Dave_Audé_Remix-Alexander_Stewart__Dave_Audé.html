		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't wanna hit reverse
You've already got me in so deep
It's only gonna make it worse
We break up, make up, on repeat

Wait a minute
Am I losing my mind?
Tell me are you with it
'Cause you keep tryna rewind
Say you're coming over
Is that just another line
(Is that just another line)

Yeah we would talk all the way through the night
Pick you up and we drive
No I never thought we'd be stopping
You keep saying we're fine
But the look in your eyes
Oh, it just can't lie

I don't wanna hit reverse
You've already got me in so deep
It's only gonna make it worse
We break up, make up, on repeat

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
We're going backwards
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
We're going backwards
We're going backwards

I get the feeling
That we're living in the past
And I'm kinda stressin'
Are we slipping through the cracks?
When we find a present
Is it ever gonna last?

Yeah we would talk all the way through the night
Pick you up and we drive
No I never thought we'd be stopping
You keep saying we're fine
But the look in your eyes
Oh it just can't lie

I don't wanna hit reverse
You've already got me in so deep
It's only gonna make it worse
We break up, make up, on repeat

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
We're going backwards
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
We're going backwards

We break up, make up
We break up, make up

Talk all the way through the night
Pick you up and we drive
No I never thought we'd be stopping
You keep saying we're fine
But the look in your eyes
Oh it just can't lie

I don't wanna hit reverse
You've already got me in so deep
It's only gonna make it worse
We break up, make up, on repeat

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
We're going backwards
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
We're going backwards
We're going backwards
We're going backwards
