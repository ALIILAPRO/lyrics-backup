		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yes, my baby left me, never said a word
Was it something I done? Something that he heard?
My baby left me, yeah, he left me 
My baby even left me, never said a word

Lord, I'm standin' at my window, wring my hands and cry
I hate to lose that man hate to say goodbye
You know he left me, yeah, he left me 
My baby even left me never said a word

Maybe one of these mornings, lord, it won't be long
You'll look for me honey, but your baby will done gone
You know you left, yeah, you left me
Oh, my baby even left me never said a word

Lord, I'm standin' at my window, wring my hands and moan
All I know is that all my love is gone
My baby left me, yeah, he left me 
My baby even left me never said a word
Yeah, my baby left me never said a word
Lord, my baby left me
