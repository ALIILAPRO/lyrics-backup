		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All day, all night
I've been thinkin' 'bout ya (can't get you off my mind, I've been thinking)
(Can't get you off my mind, I've been thinking)
Can't hide, can't lie
I've been thinkin' 'bout ya (can't get you off my mind, I've been thinking)
(Can't get you off my mind, I've been thinking)

'Cause I don't see no red flags
Baby, I'm just seeing that you wear it like we're playing tag
You the best that I never had
Somebody call up Usher 'cause I got it bad
I'm on your top like a du-rag
I'm at your crib where you live
With a duffel and my Louis bag
You got my heart, I don't want it back
I ain't with ya, but I promise if I did I would be attached

Thinkin' out loud, watching you in that crowd
Like I'm gon' take your clothes off
Thinkin' right now, are you single right now?
If you're not, you gon' have to share 'cause-

All day, all night
I've been thinkin' 'bout ya (can't get you off my mind, I've been thinking)
'Bout ya (can't get you off my mind, I've been thinking)
Can't hide, can't lie
I've been thinking about ya (can't get you off my mind, I've been thinking)
'Bout ya, yeah (can't get you off my mind, I've been thinking)

Oh, every time you come around I've been trying not to lose control (lose control)
But I lose control (lose control)
Baby, oh
If I ever make you mine, I'ma have to leave your fine ass home (fine ass home)
You can't come out at all (not at all)

Thinkin' out loud, watching you in that crowd
Like I'm gon' take your clothes off
Thinkin' right now, are you single right now?
If you're not, you gon' have to share 'cause-

All day, all night
I've been thinkin', thinkin' (can't get you off my mind, I've been thinking)
Thinkin' about ya (can't get you off my mind, I've been thinking)
Can't hide, can't lie
I've been thinking about you (can't get you off my mind, I've been thinking)
Thinking about you (can't get you off my mind, I've been thinking)

Thinkin' out loud, watching you in that crowd
Like I'm gon' take your clothes off
Thinkin' right now, are you single right now
If you're not, you gon' have to share 'cause-

All day, all night (all night)
I've been thinkin', thinkin' (can't get you off my mind, I've been thinking)
Thinkin' about ya (can't get you off my mind, I've been thinking)
Can't lie, can't hide
I've been thinking about you (can't get you off my mind, I've been thinking)
Thinking about you (can't get you off my mind, I've been thinking)
