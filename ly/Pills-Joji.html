		  Please don't run away
Please don't run away
Please don't run away
Please don't run away

Where'd you go?
I thought we'd last forever
Where'd I go?
I was sinking through the leather
I need you back
I need you back (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I need you back (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I need you back

So I'll fly away
Zoloft, Xanax
Zoloft, Xanax

Please don't run away
Please don't run away
(Fly, I'll fly away, away, away)
Please don't run away
Please don't run away
(Oh please, please don't run away)

I don't know why
I don't know why I feel this way
I feel the same
I don't know why
I don't know why I feel the same

I need you back (fly away, away, away)
I need you back
I need you back (oh please, please don't run away)
I need you back (yeah, yeah, yeah)

Where'd you go?
I thought we'd last forever (last forever)
Where'd I go?
I was sinking through the leather
