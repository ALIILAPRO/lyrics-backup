		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Catch a falling star and put it in your pocket
Never let it fade away
Catch a falling star and put it in your pocket
Save it for a rainy day

For love may come and tap you on the shoulder
Some starless night
Just in case you feel you wanna hold her
You'll have a pocketful of starlight

Catch a falling star and put it in your pocket
Never let it fade away (never let it fade away)
Catch a falling star and put it in your pocket
Save it for a rainy day (save it for a rainy day)

For love may come and tap you on the shoulder
Some starless night
And just in case you feel you wanna hold her
You'll have a pocketful of starlight
(Pocketful of starlight)

Catch a falling star and put it in your pocket
Never let it fade away (never let it fade away)
Catch a falling star and put it in your pocket
Save it for a rainy day (save it for a rainy day)
(Save it for a rainy, rainy, rainy day)

For when your troubles start multiplyin'
And they just might
It's easy to forget them without tryin'
With just a pocketful of starlight

Catch a falling star and put it in your pocket
Never let it fade away (never let it fade away)
Catch a falling star and put it in your pocket
Save it for a rainy day

(Save it for a rainy day)
Save it for a rainy day
