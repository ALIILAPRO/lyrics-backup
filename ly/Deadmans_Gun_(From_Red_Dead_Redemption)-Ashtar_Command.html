		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Your hands upon
A deadman's gun, and you're
Lookin' down the sights

Your heart is warm
And the seams are torn, and they've
Given you a reason to fight

And you're not gonna take
What they've got to give 
And you're not gonna let 'em take your will to live
Because they've taken enough
And you've given them all you can give
And luck won't save them tonight
They've given you a reason to fight

And all the storms you've been chasin'
About to rain down tonight
And all that pain you've been facin'
About to come into the light

Your hands upon
A deadman's gun, and you're
Lookin' down the sights

Your heart is warm
And the seams are torn, and they've
Given you a reason to fight

And you're not gonna take
What they've got to give 
And you're not gonna let 'em take your will to live
Because they've taken enough
And you've given them all you can give
And luck won't save them tonight
They've given you a reason to fight

And all the storms you've been chasin'
About to rain down tonight
And all that pain you've been facin'
About to come into the light
