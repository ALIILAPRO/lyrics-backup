		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  i remember youÂ 
drag me into the woods
hands out taste the soil fill up my mouth
keep you alive in me under the ground
the crow in my heart
i remember

you are
the hands that cover up the tracks we left
you are
catching the orbs we met glowing
i remember you
drag me into the woods
hands held taste the soil fill up my mouth
keep you alive in me under the ground
crow in my heart

all of the darkness looks alive here
burning me up when you aren't near
i'll close my eyes and fall into the fire
all of the darkness was alive

wading like dust in the blades of light
i am the flame that licks at the air
like it won the fight
i remember you
dragging me into the woods
hands held taste the soil fill up my mouth
keep you alive in me under the ground
glowing
