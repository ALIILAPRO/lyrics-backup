Look, uh, look

Heart been broke so many times I
Don't know what to believe
Mama say it's my fault, it's my fault I wear my heart on my sleeve
Think it's best I put my heart on ice, heart on ice
'Cause I can't breathe
I'ma put my heart on ice, heart on ice
It's gettin' the best of me

While in the cell with Lil' Hakeem, after I slapped him I had told him
"I don't know how you get down with them clowns, but I'm a soldier"
No one could understand, I had way too much aggression (brrt)
That built over the years from my abandoned adolescence
See I done been lied to, backstabbed, and heartbroken
I wanted to cry but I was too afraid to open
Prayin' one day I'd find a peace of mind by the ocean
I spent all my time committing crimes to get closer
While at my nana house I play the couch, starin' at the ceiling
Tryin' not to get in my feelings
Thinkin' of a way I can make these millions
Maybe that'll take this pain away and clear up all these rainy days, yeah

Heart been broke so many times I
Don't know what to believe (know what to believe, yeah)
Mama say it's my fault, it's my fault, I wear my heart on my sleeve (my fault, it's my fault)
Think it's best I put my heart on ice, heart on ice
'Cause I can't breathe (I can't breathe, I can't breathe)
I'ma put my heart on ice, heart on ice
It's gettin' the best of me (the best of me)

Stabbed in my back so much, got residency at the trauma unit (yeah)
Growin' up, ain't had no guidance, so I had to let my mama do it (yeah, yeah)
If something happen to me, just know my brothers ain't do it, just know the opps'll do it (facts)
But them chances right now so slim 'cause the opps into it
Lost my granny, ain't understand
I reminisce 'bout a hundred grand
Came from nothing, they don't understand
Put ketchup on Wonder Bread (yeah)
Summertime in Miami, had the top down
Can't do that shit in Chi-Town
'Cause shots gon' be fired around (bah, bah, bah)
That Chance song was cool, but I can't slide around
This shit so fake and so snake that they'll kill you for a half a pound (yeah, yeah)
That's why I'm always around my bitch 'cause she turned me out
I was in that water with them sharks and I damn near drowned

Heart been broke so many times I
Don't know what to believe
Mama say it's my fault, it's my fault
I wear my heart on my sleeve
Think it's best I put my heart on ice, heart on ice
'Cause I can't breathe
I'ma put my heart on ice, heart on ice
It's gettin' the best of me
