		  911
Emergency

My biggest enemy is me
Pop a 911
My biggest enemy is me
Pop a 911
My biggest enemy is me
Ever since day one
Pop a 911
Then pop another one

Turning up emotional faders
Keep repeating self-hating phrases
I have heard enough of these voices
Almost like I have no choice

This is biological stasis
My mood's shifting to manic places
Wish I laughed and kept the good friendships
Watch life, here I go again

I can't see me cry
Can't see me cry, ever again (911, ooh)
I can't see me cry
Can't see me cry this is the end (911, emergency, ooh)

(Can't, can't, see me cry)
(Can't, can't, see me cry)
(Can't, can't, see me cry)
(Can't, can't, see me cry)
(Can't, can't, see me cry)
911, emergency

(Can't, can't, see me cry)
(Can't, can't, see me cry)
(Can't, can't, see me cry)
(Can't, can't, see me cry)
(Can't, can't, see me cry)
(Can't, can't, see me cry)
(Can't, can't, see me cry)
(Can't, can't, see me cry) Emergency

Keep my dolls inside diamond boxes
Save 'em 'til I know I'm gon' drop this
Front I've built around me, oasis
Paradise is in my hand
Holding on so tight to this status
It's not real but I'll try to grab it
Keep myself in beautiful places
Paradise is in my hands

I can't see me cry
Can't see me cry ever again (ooh)
I can't see me cry
Can't see me cry this is the end (ooh)

My biggest enemy is me
Pop a 911
My biggest enemy is me
Pop a 911
My biggest enemy is me
Ever since day one
Pop a 911
Pop a-, pop another one

(Can't, can't, see me cry)
(Can't, can't, see me cry) 911, emergency
(Can't, can't, see me cry) 
(Can't, can't, see me cry) 911, emergency
(Can't, can't, see me cry)
(Can't, can't, see me cry) 911, emergency
(Can't, can't, see me cry)
(Can't, can't, see me cry) 911, emergency
(Can't, can't, see me cry)
(Can't, can't, see me cry) 911, emergency
(Can't, can't, see me cry)
(Can't, can't, see me cry) 911, emergency
(Can't, can't, see me cry) 
(Can't, can't, see me cry) 911, emergency
(Can't, can't, see me cry) 
(Can't, can't, see me cry) 911, emergency

My biggest enemy is me
Pop a 911
My biggest enemy is me
Pop a 911
My biggest enemy is me
Ever since day one
Pop a 911
Then pop another one

My biggest enemy is me
Pop a 911
My biggest enemy is me 911, emergency
Pop a 911
My biggest enemy is me
Ever since day one
Pop a 911
Then pop another one 911, emergency

911, emergency
