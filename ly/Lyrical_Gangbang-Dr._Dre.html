		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This should be played at high volume
Preferably in a residential area

Now I'ma kick up dust
As I begin to bust
On the wick-wack, fucked up suckers you can't trust
When I pick up, I lick up, your face gets smacked up
When I rack up, so all you motherfuckers just pack up
Or get slapped with the swiftness
If you think you're swift with the gift, Merry Christmas
Now stuff that in your stocking
I'm knocking 'em out the box an'
Knocking 'em out their socks an'
'Cause Robin is rocking
Breaking 'em down to the slab
Taking 'em down on their ass
Now what ya wanna do? Ya wanna battle? Uh
Send you up shit creek without a motherfucking paddle
Rattle that brain, I'm not that same ol' plain Jane
Roll on you like a boulder, you're nothing more than a grain
Or a pebble, take it from the real rap rebel
Not Bushwick Bill but I can take it to that other level
You think you got pull? Then pull it, uh
I got the trigger, so I figure you'll bite the bullet
Then bite the dust, oh, what the fuck?
Do what I must and what I must is bust
A bubble or two, some trouble for you
So skip to my Luger, Lady of Rage is coming through

Some cool shit
Some cool shit
Boo-ya (boo-ya), spittin' out buckshots

I fears no one, I makes 'em cool off like the polar cap
Flinchin' as the hits misses the baller's back
Pushing packs to make a profit
Diggy dope duck on the topic, so stop and gimme my props, kid
I'm living large like a fat bitch
So get back, bitch, I'm hard to bogart, so the fact is
This young black kid a mercenary, merciless
Murdering millions of niggas, so who's first to diss?
They say I'm bad, so you'll find none worst than this
Chewing motherfuckers up like a Hershey's Kiss
Put to sleep, lovin' the lyrics I leave in the minds of each
Rough when flex, too complex, wrecks your mental peace
So feel the wrath, nigga, I rip in half niggas
You're quick to talk shit I'll whoop your ass, nigga
Then watch me blast, nigga, 'cause I'm the last nigga
You wanna fuck with, so up your cash, nigga
I make 'em stagger, I'm scandalous as Jimmy Swaggart
I'm a good tracker, scopin' your girl then watch me tag her
Pullin' steel like a stunt
Shown like an ID card, nigga, no needs to front, so
Here to torment, I put track on crack
And I'm strapped with a semi-tone milli-ten Mac
Yo, I breaks 'em off, I breaks 'em off, chief
Deadly as Jason on Friday The 13th

A to the motherfuckin' K

Back in the days, niggas they use to scrap
But now in '92, niggas they pull they strap
'Cause, um, police them come wicked and dem shoot
Niggas, so niggas retaliate and start to loot
Execute, boot stompin' black soldier
Here to teach and mold ya
The innovator, dominator, narrator RB to the motherfucking X
Flex wicked stylee, bump and be found into greed by a
Maniac with a gat
See nowadays, niggas is like that
I pull my trigger back, the bullets go
Pump, pump, pump, now I'm on Death Row
Fuck it, niggas going wild, every night they shoot
It's like Beirut
Maybe you should get a Kevlar vest for your chest
Anytime steppin' through my hood
But that'll do you no good
One slug to your face, no hate, you're gettin' smoked like wood
Nasty nigga, bloody pumps, lays flat on the concrete
Here comes the white sheet
Mr. Coroner caught with some yellow tape
But the murderers escape
Audi like five G's
Lyrical gangbang but it's just a G thang
