		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Started before I could even remember
Praying to God that I don't feel the hurt
But every time I end up broken or worse
Falling for everyone that I shouldn't
Burning my life down for it to work
Maybe I'm realizing love's not really worth it

Saying that I didn't know that I was putting out fires
Just to have them turn around coming back again
One of the best things I've ever had is the worst of it all

Wasting my life chasing the bittersweet
Feeling of love that ruins me
I'm hurting more than I can breathe
Making me someone I don't wanna be
Breaking the better parts of me
I guess love isn't meant for me

Drinking alone in this empty apartment
Trying my best just to get through the night
Where do I go, what do I do, don't know what's right
Saying that I didn't know that I was putting out fires
Just to have them turn around coming back again
One of the best things I've ever had is the worst of it all

Wasting my life chasing the bittersweet
Feeling of love that ruins me
I'm hurting more than I can breathe
Making me someone I don't wanna be
Breaking the better parts of me
I guess love isn't meant for me
