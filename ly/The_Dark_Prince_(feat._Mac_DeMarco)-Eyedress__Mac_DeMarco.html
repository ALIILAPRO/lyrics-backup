		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (The lord of lo-fi)
(The dark prince of Highland Park)

She was right next to me
In my ride, so fine
I need you close to me
Can't let you out of my sight
There's no one else like you
She's a one of one
They don't make 'em like you do
She's got the sauce I want

She is the best
Thing to happen in my life
She is the best thing to happen in my life
She is the best thing to happen in my life

She is the best
Thing to happen in my life
She is the best thing to happen in my life
She is the best thing to happen in my life

She is the best
Thing to happen in my life
She is the best thing to happen in my life
She is the best thing to happen in my life

She's irreplaceable
She's got a heart of gold
Can't no one dress like you
She's got an eye for it all (ah)

Don't you get mad at me
When I let you down
I try my best
To make you proud
I hate when I
See you down
Give you my all (ouch)

She is the best
Thing to happen in my life
She is the best thing to happen in my life
She is the best thing to happen in my life

She is the best
Thing to happen in my life
She is the best thing to happen in my life
She is the best thing to happen in my life
