		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Have you ever lost, lost the light in your life?
Have you ever left, left yourself behind?
Have you ever lied and just replied, "I'm fine"?
'Cause I can see you've lost, lost the light in your life

Wanna run like your mascara
Wine-stained lips talkin' to the mirror
If the sun comes up, don't even care at all

Just keep on dancin' with those teary eyes
Just keep on dancin' with those teary eyes
Promise one day, baby, they're gonna dry
Just keep on dancin' with those teary eyes

If love has left you with, with a question mark
If trust has left you fallin' in nobody's arms

If you wanna hide like your emotions
Heart can't break, it's already broken
If the sun comes up, don't even care at all

Just keep on dancin' with those teary eyes
Just keep on dancin' with those teary eyes
Promise one day, baby, they're gonna dry
Just keep on dancin' with those teary eyes

Just keep on dancin' with those teary eyes

Wanna run like your mascara
Wine-stained lips talkin' to the mirror
If the sun comes up, don't even care at all

Just keep on dancin' with those teary eyes
Just keep on dancin' with those teary eyes
Promise one day, baby, they're gonna dry
Just keep on dancin' with those teary eyes

Keep on dancin'
Keep on dancin'
Keep on dancin'
Just keep on dancin' with those teary eyes
