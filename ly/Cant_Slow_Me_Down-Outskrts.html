		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Somedays it feels like
I'm stuck in my head
Somedays it feels like
I can't get outta bed oh oh oh
I hate that feeling
Can't take no pill
So I lace my boots up
And go in for the kill

You can tear me down
You can curse my name
You can run me round
With all your messed up games
But when the moment comes
You know I'm here to play
I'm here to play

Can't slow me down
I'm like a hurricane
Can't stop me now
Coming at you like a bullet train
Cause I'm never gonna let up off the gas
Keep the pedal to the metal til I burn the track
Don't ever count me out
Can't slow me down
Can't stop me now
Can't slow me down

I hear the voices
They tell me to quit But i
Quiet the noises When I
Start moving like this
No I I'll never let up
I'll never fade out
The one thing i know for sure is that
I'll never back down

Can't slow me down
I'm like a hurricane
Can't stop me now
Coming at you like a bullet train
Cause I'm never gonna let up off the gas
Keep the pedal to the metal til I burn the track
Don't ever count me out
Can't slow me down
Can't stop me now
Can't slow me down
Can't stop me now

Yeah, Like Terminator hasta la vista baby
Yeah, Like a rocket in the sky taking off I'm outer spacing
Like Speedy Gonzalez I'm running I'm gunning leaving nothin behind me but smoke
Faster than that Usain Bolt
YEAH

You can tear me down
Can't slow me down
You can curse my name
Can't stop me now
You can run me round
Can't slow me down
With all your messed up games
Can't stop me now

Can't slow me down
I'm like a hurricane
Can't stop me now
Coming at you like a bullet train
Cause I'm never gonna let up off the gas
Keep the pedal to the metal til I burn the track
Don't ever count me out
Can't slow me down
Can't stop me now
Can't slow me down
Can't stop me now
Can't slow me down
