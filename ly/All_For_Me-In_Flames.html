		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Until the world ceases to move!
A burning feeling, let me call

I wish one more thing! I flinch my hands, and bang my head!

Take whatever comes to you,
All the while, I don't need another friend.

I better not do the things I do for you.
Forever the night that is long for me now.

I'm sure that I may, I can get you, all that you lost.

I'm never told, bad I stay, so sick in me, I'm dying alone.

We stand to fight for nothing! without a thought of reason!
We will never be okay!

I better not do the things I do for you.

Forever the night that is long for me now.

I'm sure that I may, I can get you, all lost.

A growing pain, it is hard to say what brought the darkest burden.
For some of us, there is no answer.

Chains are breaking, I regret this built up inside of me.
There's a storm coming.

I will serve no more, 'til my heavy last breath!

I better not do the things I do for you.
Forever the night that is long for me now.

I'm sure that I may, I can get you, all that you lost.
