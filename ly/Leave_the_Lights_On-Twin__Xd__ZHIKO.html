		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We're in the dark it's getting late
I really should go, he's waiting for me
We both know, it's not what it seems
We both know what's between the sheets

I know that it's a secret 
And that i've got to keep it
But I want the lights on
Yeah, I want the lights on
And I don't want to run nowhere anymore 
Leave the lights on, Leave the lights on, Leave the lights on

We're in the dark it's getting late
I really should go, he's waiting for me
We both know, it's not what it seems
We both know what's between the sheets

I know that it's a secret 
And that i've got to keep it
But I want the lights on
Yeah, I want the lights on
And I don't want to run nowhere anymore 
Leave the lights on, Leave the lights on, Leave the lights on

I know that it's a secret 
And that i've got to keep it
But I want the lights on
Yeah, I want the lights on
And I don't want to run nowhere anymore 
Leave the lights on, Leave the lights on, Leave the lights on

We're in the dark it's getting late
I really should go, he's waiting for me

I know that it's a secret 
And that i've got to keep it
But I want the lights on
Yeah, I want the lights on
And I don't want to run nowhere anymore 
Leave the lights on, Leave the lights on, Leave the lights on
