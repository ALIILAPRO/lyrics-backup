		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Got a lil baddie in a drop top coupe out front
Swear that she ‘gon ruin my life but we’ll have some fun

I don’t think I can escape your clutch
Gripping me tight but I love your touch
Maybe I can take you the penthouse right now
Are you down?

Henny and ice got me faded but
We can go round til the sun comes
I just wanna get you out that lil blouse right now
Are you down?

Tie me up and let me down again
I know all the games you play
You swear you won’t come round again
But baby

I can taste the perfume on your neck
Dig your nails all in my back
Cause I’m just another broken heart 
That you’ve come to collect
When the morning comes
I know that I’ll be alone in this bed
Just know that
Just know that
It was worth it

She got the YSL boots 
And the Louis V belt
Say she only drinking 
If I’m pouring top shelf
She a lil boujee
But she badder than hell
She - she a lil boujee
But she badder than hell


Swear that she don’t need a man
But she’s coming home with me tonight
Lock the door and dim the lights
Fuck three times, yeah

I don’t think I can escape your clutch
All of these feelings just feel too much
Maybe we can work out all the lil doubts right now
Are you down?


Tie me up and let me down again
I know all the games you play
You swear you won’t come round again
But baby

I can taste the perfume on your neck
Dig your nails all in my back
Cause I’m just another broken heart 
That you’ve come to collect
When the morning comes 
I know that I’ll be alone in this bed
Just know that
Just know that
It was worth it
