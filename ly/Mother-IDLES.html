		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My mother worked fifteen hours five days a week
My mother worked sixteen hours six days a week
My mother worked seventeen hours seven days a week

The best way to scare a Tory is to read and get rich
The best way to scare a Tory is to read and get rich
The best way to scare a Tory is to read and get rich

I know nothing
I'm just sitting here looking at pretty colors
I know nothing
I'm just sitting here looking at pretty colors
I know nothing
I'm just sitting here looking at pretty colors

Mother
Fucker
Mother
Fucker

My mother worked fifteen hours five days a week
My mother worked sixteen hours six days a week
My mother worked seventeen hours seven days a week

The best way to scare a Tory is to read and get rich
The best way to scare a Tory is to read and get rich
The best way to scare a Tory is to read and get rich

I know nothing
I'm just sitting here looking at pretty colors
I know nothing
I'm just sitting here looking at pretty colors
I know nothing
I'm just sitting here looking at pretty colors

Mother
Fucker
Mother
Fucker

Sexual violence doesn't start and end with rape
It starts in our books and behind our school gates
Men are scared women will laugh in their face
Whereas women are scared it's their lives men will take

Mother
Fucker
Mother
Fucker
