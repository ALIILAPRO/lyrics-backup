		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The one that got away is the one i can’t ignore
No matter what i gave, it still a things i can’t repay…
Still the same, it’s a shame, i could never run from this latent feel..
At the end of the day, going round and round in circles i hate.

I’m just deluded by the people around
Being submissive somehow.
But i chose the wounded to make it all mine
I can’t forget it by now.

You’re mastermind, I’ll try my best, you did the rest
I put the prayers, i surrender, your believer.
Make me surprise, you’ve got a lot, forget me not…
Cause our times are different.

And i doubt for a minute 
‘Bout life and i hate it.
And i doubt for a minute
Fuck the structure ya bitch, i’m no fool

“Bust out, leave it away!”
I live it in the box, a traditional way
And preaching like a fox, original me
It’s about reaching “the one” in the game
Baby, you think you know me?

I’m just deluded by the people around
Being submissive somehow.
But i chose the wounded to make it all mine
I can’t forget it by now.

I’m just deluded by the people around
Being submissive somehow.
But i chose the wounded to make it all mine
I can’t forget it by now.

And i doubt for a minute 
‘Bout life and i hate it.
And i doubt for a minute
Fuck the structure ya bitch, i’m no fool
