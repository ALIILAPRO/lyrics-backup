		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Life goes on day after day, after day, after day
Who-ha who-ha
Who-ha who-ha

Ha
The animals are winding me up
The jungle call
The jungle call
Who-ha who-ha who-ha who-ha
In Xanadu did Kublai Khan
A pleasure dome erect
Moving on keep moving on, yeah
Moving at one million miles an hour
Using my power
I sell it by the hour
I have it so I market it
You really can't afford it, yeah
Really can't afford it

Shooting stars never stop
Even when they reach the top
Shooting stars never stop
Even when they reach the top

There goes a supernova
What a pushover, yeah
There goes a supernova
What a pushover

We're a long way from home
Welcome to the Pleasure dome
On our way home
Going home where lovers roam
Long way from home
Welcome to the Pleasure dome

Moving on, keep moving on
I will give you diamonds by the shower
Love your body even when it's old
Do it just as only I can do it

And never, ever doing what I'm told
Shooting stars never stop
Even when they reach the top, yeah
Shooting stars never stop
Even when they reach the top

There goes a supernova
What a pushover, yeah
There goes a supernova
What a pushover

We're a long way from home
Welcome to the pleasure dome
On our way home
Going home where lovers roam
Long way from home
Welcome to the pleasure dome

Keep moving on
Gotta reach the top
Don't stop
Lay lovin' light, all mine
Keep moving on
Yeah

Shooting stars never stop
Shooting stars never stop

Shooting stars never stop
Even when they reach the top
There goes a supernova
What a pushover

Shooting stars never stop
Even when they reach the top
There goes a supernova
What a pushover

There goes a supernova
Who-ha who-ha
Welcome to the pleasure dome
Who-ha who-ha
Going home where lovers roam
Who-ha who-ha
Welcome to the pleasure dome

(erect)

Who-ha who-ha

War is won
Who-ha who-ha
War is won
Uh, uh, uh

Boy, boy, boy
Uh, uh, uh
Keep moving on
Gotta reach the top
Don't stop
Layin' love in lines, all mine
Keep moving on, oh yeah

Shooting stars never stop
Shooting stars never stop
Shooting stars never stop
Who-ha who-ha

There goes a supernova
Who-ha who-ha
What a pushover

Shooting stars never stop
Even when they reach the top
Shooting stars never stop
Even when they reach the top

Shooting stars never stop
Even when they reach the top
Shooting stars never stop
Even when they reach the top

There goes a supernova
What a pushover
There goes a supernova
What a pushover, yeah

Ha, we're a long way from home
Welcome to the Pleasuredome
On your way home
Going home where lovers roam
Long way from home
Welcome to the pleasure dome (who-ha who-ha)
(Who-ha who-ha)
We're a long way from home
Welcome to the Pleasuredome

Welcome
The world is my oyster
Ha ha ha ha ha
The world is my oyster
Ha ha ha ha ha
The world is my oyster
Ha ha ha ha ha
Ha ha ha ha ha
Welcome
