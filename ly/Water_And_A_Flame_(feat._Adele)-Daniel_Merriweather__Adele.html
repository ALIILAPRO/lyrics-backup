		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Seven days has gone so fast,
I really thought the pain would pass.
It's been nearly an hour,
Since I thought of you.

But your not answering the phone,
I'd settle for a busy tone,
At least that I'd know that you're okay.
A girl like you ain't meant to go away.
Oh

Now you're gone,
There's nothing else I want.
Now that it's over,
There's nothing else I want.
What have I done,
Looks like I was wrong.
Is everything really meant to change,
I guess we're like water and a flame.
Water and a flame

I'm tired of this empty house,
I need a drink to get me out.
A couple more til I forget your name.

I saw a boy that looked like you,
I didn't know quite what to do,
It took a power of will to break my stare.
I realized what I wanted wasn't there.

Now you're gone,
There's nothing else I want.
Now that it's over,
There's nothing else I want.

Is everything really meant to change,
I guess we're like water and a flame.
Water and a flame

If you see me coming
I look away, I look away
And if your mind is made up
I look away, I will look away

If your worry bound
I'm okay, I'm okay, yes I am
All this sorrow and this pain,
Is going to go away

Now you're gone,
There's nothing else I want.
Now that it's over,
There's nothing else I want.
What have I done,
Looks like I was wrong.
Is everything really meant to change,
I guess we're like water and a flame.
Water and a flame
