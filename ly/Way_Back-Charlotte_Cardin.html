		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby, here we go again
It's been weighing on me like an elephant
No need to play pretend
Like any of this was an accident

I heard you're in town for the weekend
And I'm around tonight
And I might need a ride

You and I, we go way back
Before the world went wild
Don't you worry, I know why you're feeling down like that
But I bet I can cheer you up, oh
But I bet I can cheer you up, oh

Baby, you got me goin'
We're up all night, nocturnal animals
Everything 'bout this is beautiful
And it's about time we finally lost control

Yeah, you and I, we go way back
Before the world went wild
Don't you worry, I know why you're feeling down like that
But I bet I can cheer you up, oh
But I bet I can cheer you up, oh

I heard you're in town for the weekend, mm
And I'm around tonight

You and I, we go way back (way back)
Before the world went wild
Don't you worry, I know why you're feeling
You and I, we go way back (way back)
Before the world went wild
Don't you worry, I know why you're feeling down like that
But I bet I can cheer you up, oh
But I bet I can cheer you up, oh
