		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How dark is it in your mind?
I won't stop until I can find the dead in all of you
And I know you're far from home
How dark is it in your mind?
I can't feel anything inside
Believe me when I say I'm alive and you're my home
See the trouble that I cause, I feed the thoughts you never saw
But you just won't let me go
Won't let me go
Explain away the panic but veins were made for addicts
So promises of change are put in boxes in the attic
Won't let you know
Won't let you know
Don't get close, they've got eyes of stone
You've been fallin' to pieces, they give them new life, new meaning
Oh they tend to hold, when you push they pull
But the fallin' is easy when you're numb
How dark is it in your mind?
I won't stop until I can find the dead in all of you
And I know you're far from home
How dark is it in your mind?
I can't feel anything inside
Believe me when I say I'm alive and you're my home
When did the lines all blur to gray?
You may never see them
How can I sleep when you're awake?
What's the point in dreamin'?
I close my eyes and feel the weight
Fallin' from the ceilin'
On the floor
Screamin' no
Woah-oh-ooh-oh
No tellin' what I might do, somethings in my head that I'm not sure that I can fight through
And it haunts me, coming back to say that it wants me
Now
I've always been afraid of the shadow in my closet that somebody said I made up
It's inside now, tryna take over my mind now
But down this road, I don't see a ghost
It's more like a feelin' that almost keeps me from breathin'
I cannot hide from those silent eyes
They're pullin' me back in, controlling every facet, they're askin'
How dark is it in your mind?
I won't stop until I can find the dead in all of you
And I know you're far from home
How dark is it in your mind?
I can't feel anything inside
Believe me when I say I'm alive and you're my home
When did the lines all blur to gray?
You may never see them
How can I sleep when you're awake?
What's the point in dreamin'?
I close my eyes and feel the weight
Fallin' from the ceilin'
On the floor
Screamin' no
Woah-oh-ooh-oh
I love it, stole them, take the parts and mold 'em
Makin' sure the mood will go unnoticed
So you gotta hide it, it's a suicidal mindset
Growin' 'til the roots are deep inside it
You vent so I write it
Tell me when you sit alone, tell me when you're numb at home, tell me all your hopes are gone
Steppin' on throats like a nihilist
Devil works loud so I'm workin' in the silence
You're prayin' that you'll change me
And it hurts to think you made me
And it's easiest to blame me
When you track the steps you'll find the power that you gave me
And now that we're alone friend
And all the good is broken
I'll pull down the shades and close all the doors 'til I'm the only one controllin'
Close all the doors 'til I'm the only one controllin' now
I'll close all the doors
