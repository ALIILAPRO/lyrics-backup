		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ghosts in the photograph
Never lie'd to me

I'd be all of that
I'd be all of that

A false memory
Would be everything
A denial my eliminent

What was that for? 
What was that for? 

What would you do
If you saw spaceships
Over glasgow? 
Would you fear them? 

Every aircraft
Every camera
Is a wish that
Wasn't granted

What was that for? 
What was that for? 

Try to be bad
Try to be bad
