		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I was small, and Christmas trees were tall
We used to love while others used to play
Don't ask me why, but time has passed us by
Some one else moved in from far away

Now we are tall, and Christmas trees are small
And you don't ask the time of day
But you and I, our love will never die
But guess we'll cry come first of May

The apple tree that grew for you and me
I watched the apples falling one by one
And I recall the moment of them all
The day I kissed your cheek and you were mine

Now we are tall, and Christmas trees are small
And you don't ask the time of day
But you and I, our love will never die
But guess we'll cry come first of May

When I was small, and Christmas trees were tall
Do do do do do do do do do
Don't ask me why, but time has passed us by
Some one else moved in from far away
