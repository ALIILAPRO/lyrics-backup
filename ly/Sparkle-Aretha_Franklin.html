		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I sparkle
Loving the way that I do
(It is true) I feel so good
Just having you
Breathlessly and eager
Submission isn't easy for me 
(We were so loving wasn't we)
I'd always known it could be

Don't want to do nothing
Tied against your will
This ain't no cheap thrill
You got to know just how I feel
And if you think your going to fall
All you have to do is call
I have nothing in my self
And I give my self to you

Say child tingle sparkle
I hope the love never breaks away
Leave a little fire burning everyday (fire burning everyday)
Save all the warmth for you

Just want you to know 
When your jealousy shows
(Understand) understand there will be no other man
But you, baby
You can believe
This love in me
As I believe in you

And when times are low
And I am really on your mind
Everybody needs some time
Something funky good and kind
And you always seem to please me
And you wear me down so easy
Good work is never done
Until the morning comes

Just want you to know 
When your jealousy shows
Understand there will be no other man
But you, baby
And you can believe
This love in me
As I believe in you

Don't want to do nothing
Tied against your will
This ain't no cheap thrill
You got to know just how I feel
And if you think your going to fall
All you have to do is call
I have nothing in myself
And I give my self to you

When times are low
And I am really on your mind
Everybody needs some time
Something funky good and kind
Breathlessly and eager (breathlessly and eager)
You got me 'round your finger (you got me 'round your finger)
A sparkle with a fire
You always take me higher
You always seem to please me (you always seem to please me)
You wear me down so easy (you wear me down so easy)
Good work is never done (good work is never done)
Until the morning, the morning comes
