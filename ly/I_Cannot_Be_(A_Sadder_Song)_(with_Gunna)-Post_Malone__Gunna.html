		  Oh, oh, mmm

How am I free when you hold me so tight?
How can I beam when you blockin' my light?
I cannot be what you want me
What you want me, what you want me to be

How can I see when you cover my eyes?
And can I just sleep when I'm so fuckin' tired?
So tell me right now what you want me
What you want me, what you want me to be
(What you want me to be)

Yeah, ooh
What you wanna do is tell me off, no
What you wanna do is fuck me up, ooh
What you're not gon' do is top me off
So excuse me for an hour while I love myself
You told me 
You'd protect my heart, you'd be my goalie
Thinkin' 'bout that bullshit that you sold me
And I know that I ain't perfect
But you so mean, we were homies
You trip me up just to watch me fall
Smoke another a cigarette, wash the last one down
So down, down, 'til I'm flat on my face
You're the reason why I get so high

How am I free when you hold me so tight?
How can I beam when you blockin' my light?
I cannot be what you want me
What you want me, what you want me to be

How can I see when you cover my eyes?
And can I just sleep when I'm so fuckin' tired?
So tell me right now what you want me
What you want me, what you want me to be 

Got a custom diamond ring and, no, he don't got a wife
Got a large amount of things, I can't total the price
I told her I don't need her, she can leave out my life
You only get one try, but if it's lit, we go twice
I pull up in a hard top, it's a drop-top
Told you we'd be multimillionaires, why lie? 
She know I do not care for no pressin' my mind
The factory Skeleton on my wrist say prime-time
How couldn't you just let me be me?
You startin' to be measly 
I couldn't even find out 'cause you leavin' me
You can tell I'm pure, you can feel my energy
Really rich, we ain't livin' free
Gotta keep it solid and we all agree

How am I free when you hold me so tight?
How can I beam when you blockin' my light?
I cannot be what you want me
What you want me, what you want me to be

How can I see when you cover my eyes?
And can I just sleep when I'm so fuckin' tired?
So tell me right now what you want me
What you want me, what you want me to be

Oh, ah-ah-ah
