		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Feel like it’s over 
Feel like it’s over for us
Reach out you’re touchin’ me but 
You coulda been anybody
For years I loved ya but I
Feel like I’m lyin to myself
To myself

I know we’ve fallen out of love
But would you have this one last dance with me 
We can’t go back to what it was
But would you have this one last dance with me

I think it might be what we need to let us go rest in peace
I know we’ve fallen out of love
But would you have this one last dance with me 
Before I set you free

Don’t let me down, don’t let me down 
one last dance with me?
Before I set you free

We lost that feeling
We lost that feeling it’s gone
Hate being sober 
It’s such a sobering thought
No point in going on we
Both know we want
Somebody else, somebody else

I know we’ve fallen out of love
But would you have this one last dance with me 
We can’t go back to what it was
But would you have this one last dance with me

I think it might be what we need to let us go rest in peace
I know we’ve fallen out of love
But would you have this one last dance with me 
Before I set you free

Don’t let me down, don’t let me down 
one last dance with me?
Before I set you free
