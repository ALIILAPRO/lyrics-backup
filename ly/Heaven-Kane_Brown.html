		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is perfect
Come kiss me one more time
I couldn't dream this up
Even if I tried
You and me in this moment
Feels like magic, don't it?
I'm right where I wanna be

Everybody's talkin' 'bout heaven like they just can't wait to go
They're sayin' how it's gonna be so good, so beautiful
Lyin' next to you, in this bed with you, I ain't convinced
'Cause, I don't know how, I don't know how heaven, heaven
Could be better than this, mm

I swear you're an angel
Sent to this world
What did I do right
To deserve you, girl?
I could stay here forever
I'd be fine if we never
Had to even leave this room

Everybody's talkin' 'bout heaven like they just can't wait to go
They're sayin' how it's gonna be so good, so beautiful
Lyin' next to you, in this bed with you, I ain't convinced
'Cause, I don't know how, I don't know how heaven, heaven
Could be better than this, mm
Could be better than this (mm)

Everybody's talkin' 'bout heaven like they just can't wait to go
Sayin' how it's gonna be so good, so beautiful
Lyin' next to you, in this bed with you, I ain't convinced (so beautiful)
'Cause, I don't know how, I don't know how heaven, heaven
Could be better than this (heaven), oh
Could be better than this (heaven, heaven)

I swear this is perfect
Come kiss me one more time
