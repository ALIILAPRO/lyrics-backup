Here we go, right
Hey Five, what do you got now?

Why do you put up a fight with your feelings?
Girl we've been friends now for far too long
I know some part of you thinks that I'm schemin'
But there's no way I could do you wrong

I said love, you said it ain't that
Then you turn around and come back
I can tell the way that you act
That you want this

Don't you fight it girl it's only natural
Can't disguise what's in your eyes they say too much
Don't deny that when we touch it's physical
Let it be, you and me, don't fight it, baby

Don't need to tell me we're riskin' this friendship
But there's no stoppin' this vibe we're on
And when we play I can feel we're not jokin'
In every stare that we share too long

I said love, you said it ain't that
Then you turn around and come back
I can tell the way that you act
That you want this

Don't you fight it girl it's only natural
Can't disguise what's in your eyes they say too much
Don't deny that when we touch it's physical
Let it be, you and me, don't fight it, baby

What everybody knows, don't fight it baby
Just let you're feelings show, don't fight it baby
Don't wanna let it go, why fight it baby?
Look to your heart and you'll know that you want it

Baby you know you make me feel real hot
Keep you body shakin' show me what you got, yeah

Don't you fight it girl it's only natural
Can't disguise what's in your eyes they say too much
Don't deny that when we touch it's physical
Let it be, you and me

Don't you fight it girl it's only natural
Can't disguise what's in your eyes they say too much
Don't deny that when we touch it's physical
Let it be, you and me, don't fight it, baby
