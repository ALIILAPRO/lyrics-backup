		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're just a soft thing
I think you cannot age at all
In the claws of some pearly wound
How did you grow so hard and small
Now everyone's memory repeats like a drum
A sundown song playing at noon
But when you sing like you do
Takes the air from the room
If all things are love
And all love is pain
Then all pain is all that is true
You're just a soft thing
I think you cannot age at all
In the claws of some pearly wound
How did you grow so hard and small
Now Rey memory repeats like a drum
A sundown song playing at noon
To float like a feather you gotta shoot like a gun
And it's too fast, it's too much, too soon
But when you sing like you do, take the air from the room
If all things are love, and all love is pain, then all pain is all that is true
