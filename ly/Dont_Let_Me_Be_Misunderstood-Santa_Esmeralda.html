		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby, do you understand me now
 Sometimes I feel a little mad
 Well don't you know that no-one alive
 Can always be an angel
 When things go wrong I seem to be bad

 I'm just a soul who's intentions are good
 Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

 Baby, sometimes I'm so carefree
 With a joy that's hard to hide
 And sometimes it seems that
 All I have to do is worry
 And then you're bound to see my other side

 I'm just a soul who's intentions are good
 Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

 If I seem edgy, I want you to know
 That I never mean to take it out on you
 Life has it's problems and I get my share
 And that's one thing I never mean to do

 Cause I love you
 Oh, oh, oh, baby, don't you know I'm human
 Have thoughts like any other one
 Sometimes I find myself alone and regretting
 Some foolish thing, some little simple thing I've done

 I'm just a soul who's intentions are good
 Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

 Yes, I'm just a soul who's intentions are good
 Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

 Yes, I'm just a soul who's intentions are good
 Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

 Yes, I'm just a soul who's intentions are good
 Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
