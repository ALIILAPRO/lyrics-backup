		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She said she wanna be my girl, that's unlikely
Said it's all or nothing, told her girl don't try me
She only fuck with me cause she knows I'm icy
Had a conversation told her she's gon' be my side piece
And that's okay cause these days that's just how my life be
Livin' how I want give a fuck who don't like it

(Aiyiyiyi) We do this every night
(Aiyiyiyi) Got money on my mind
(Aiyiyiyi) Baby please don't waste your time
I know you wanna be my wifey but girl that's unlikely
