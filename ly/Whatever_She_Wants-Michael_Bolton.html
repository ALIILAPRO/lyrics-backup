		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There was a time
Thought I had everything
When the world was mine
And I was blind and I was king
I never saw it comin'
How hard that I would fall
But the one thing I was missing
Was the meaning of it all

Whatever she wants
Whatever she needs
All she's gotta do is call my name
And that's where I'll be
Whatever she wants
Whatever she needs
From me
From me

She's been the light
That showed me the truth
Taught me love's the only real thing
We can hold on to
She opened her arms
I laid down my heart
She knows I'd give her anything
Beneath the moon and stars

Whatever she wants
Whatever she needs
All she's gotta do is call my name
And that's where I'll be
Whatever she wants
Whatever she needs
From me

She came in like an angel
To wake me just in time
Yeah, she came in like an angel
To save this life of mine

Whatever she wants
Whatever she needs
All she's gotta do is call my name
And that's where I'll be
Whatever she wants
Whatever she needs
From me, mm
