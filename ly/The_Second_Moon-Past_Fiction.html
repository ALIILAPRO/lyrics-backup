		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Scarlet skies severely collapsing 
Those wounded eyes barely seeing
The second moon adorned the commotion
Intertwined in immutable contradiction

Eminent tombs upon the ground
Ignite the flame, portray it as a crown
Eclipses encircle
As two lights fade for a mortal

Will the heaven be eternity
Making firm way toward the mountain
Let the pain falls into the vain
And the hell will be an endless sea
There is no more point of crying an ocean
As the horn's wail marking the end

There's no habitual setting sun

Three eclipses encircle
As two lights fade for a mortal
Annihilation, unconditional

Chaotic devotion on narrowed dusk and dawn

Will the heaven be eternity
Making firm way toward the mountain
Let the pain falls into the vain
And the hell will be an endless sea
There is no more point of crying an ocean
As the horn's wail marking the end 

Mark an end as the second moon ascend

Will the heaven be eternity
And the hell will be an endless sea
Mark an end
As the second moon ascend

Three eclipses encircle
As two lights fade for a mortal

Mark an end
As the second moon ascend
Mark an end
As the second moon ascend
