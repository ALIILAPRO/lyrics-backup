		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We had our first date three weeks ago on Monday
He took me out for dinner, then he asked me back to his place
Mate
He was like 6'8 with huge arms and a fit face
Then he opened up his mouth and I was like
No, fuck's sake

What you so boring for? It's like talking to a door
Swear I cannot be arsed to do this anymore
But you look nice in this light
Don't tempt me 'cause I just might
Stay for another glass of wine
Oh, no, I fucked it

Oh, not another one
Here we go again
How can someone look so pretty
But have nothing in their head?
Oh, no, not another one
I won't do it again
I really should've slept on it, 'cause I woke up in his bed

Pretty boys, they got nothing else to give
Pretty boys, they're too simple to think
Pretty boys, just do your thing
You look so pretty
So shut up and kiss me

There is no deeper meaning, don't want to meet your mother
Don't care about your feelings, just get under the covers
Called my friends when we were having dinner
Just to tell them that I've met nobody dimmer
You're so bleak like a rainy day in February
And luckily, talking to you isn't necessary
Because

What you so boring for? It's like talking to a door
Swear I cannot be arsed to do this anymore (no way)
But you look nice in this light
Don't tempt me 'cause I just might
Stay for another glass of wine
Oh, no, shit, fuck

Oh, not another one
Here we go again
How can someone look so pretty
But have nothing in their head?
Oh, no, not another one
I won't do it again
I really should've slept on it, 'cause I woke up in his bed

And you had so much potential
Oh, I could've been your very best friend
And driven you so fucking mental
But time is money and you're not worth the spend (no)

Oh, not another one
She's doing it again (say what?)
She likes the pretty boys that have got nothing in their heads
Oh, no, not another one, she won't do it again
I really wish she'd slept on it
'Cause she woke up in his bed
Oh, not another one
I'm doing it again
I like the pretty boys that have got nothing in the heads
Oh, no, not another one
I won't do it again
I really should've slept on it 'cause I woke in his bed again

Pretty boys, they got nothing else to give
Pretty boys, they're too simple to think
Pretty boys, just do your thing
You look so pretty
So shut up and kiss me
