		  Strawberries for two on a Friday afternoon
What would we do if the sky wasn't blue?
It's nice just to lay in the sun by your side
I wonder if something more had ever crossed your mind
 
In the future one day 
If we found ourselves in the same place
Maybe I would think twice
Maybe in my perception
We'd have more connection
In a new time and place
 
But it's not my place to say
 
Cold lemonade
Heart shaped ice cubes in trays
Brain freeze again
I know nothing makes sense
I liked it when you told me that I looked nice
When you call me at midnight you need some advice
 
In the future one day 
If we found ourselves in the same place
Maybe I would think twice
Maybe in my perception
We'd have more connection
In a new time and place
