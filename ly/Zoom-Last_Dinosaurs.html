		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Instead of chorus (x2) I did 
I don't want to be just another
Fighter without fire, nothing to inspire
In a million years when we're older,
Finally we can be part of history 
You know you're not the only one
To see the boy that you
Hold very close to you
He's not your kind of guy
I hope you realize
I have no care for answers
'Cos now you're standing only next to me, Oh Oh
So take me on a tangent
'Cos tangible is something we perceive, Oh Oh

[Chorus]
I don't want to be just another
Fighter without fire, nothing to inspire
In a million years when we're older,
Finally we can be part of history

From retrospective points of view,
It's time to reinvent
Don't care to what extent
Subconscious disarray
I want to look away
I'll live for shadow play
I can't tell the difference when everyone's pretending to play ball, 
Oh oh
Now I'm all for resistance,
But I can't take it anymore, Oh Oh

I don't want to be just another
Fighter without fire, nothing to inspire
In a million years when we're older,
Finally we can be part of history

I don't want to be just another
Fighter without fire, nothing to inspire
In a million years when we're older,
Finally we can be part of history

I told you, I tell myself
It's alright, alright, alright

I don't want to be just another
Fighter without fire, nothing to inspire
In a million years when we're older,
Finally we can be part of history

I don't want to be just another
Fighter without fire, nothing to inspire
In a million years when we're older,
Finally we can be part of history
