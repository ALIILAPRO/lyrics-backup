		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If your mind's as cluttered as your kitchen sink
If your heart's as empty as your diesel tank
If all your white t-shirts have stains
If you've got some guts and got some ink, well then
We should be friends

If you borrow dresses like you borrow time
If you dream all day and drink all night
If you're looking for love but willing to fight
Over men and momma's and Miller Lite, well then
We should be friends

I don't know you well but I know that look
And I can judge the cover 'cause I read the book
On losing sleep and gaining weight
On pain and shame and crazy trains

If you paint your nails while you cut your loss
If you like acting like you're the boss
If everything your daddy says
Is something you can put stock in, well then
We should be friends (come on!)

I don't know you well but I know that look
And I can judge the cover 'cause I wrote the book
On losing sleep and gaining weight
On pain and shame and crazy trains

One, two, three

If you use alcohol as a sedative
And bless your heart as a negative
If you ride your white horse like the wind
If what you see is what you get, well then
Oh, we should be friends
Alright

Wohoo
Wohoo
Wohoo

Well then
Oh, we should be friends

Wohoo
Wohoo
Wohoo
Wohoo

Well then
Oh, we can be friends
