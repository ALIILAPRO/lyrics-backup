		  What, what, what, whatcha say, Mr. Clean?
I'm flagging you down for a misdemeanor
It must look different from your mezzanine
You got me, got me feeling out of touch, Hall & Oates
Push it out, wish me luck

You got a way, you're messing with my faith
You're tryna paint a picture but you're running out of paint
You had your say 'til I took it away
Out of yours in my controlla

I'm pushing 20, got no time for others (Pushing, pushing)
I'm pushing 20, got no time for others (Pushing, pushing)
Who ain't on the same wave, yeah, on the same page
Tryna tell me what to be, yeah, tell me what to think
I'm pushing 20, got no time for others (Pushing, pushing, pushing)
I'm pushing 20, got no time for others (Pushing, pushing, pushing)
Who ain't on the same wave, yeah, on the same page
Tryna tell me what to be, yeah, tell me what to think

I'm pushing 20, I ain't talking 'bout a Beamer
And while you're wasting time, the money's in the meter
So I can start from scratch, make you a believer
Or I can just, da da da
Act like I don't give a, uh

You got a way, you're messing with my faith
You're tryna paint a picture but you're running out of paint
You had your say 'til I took it away
Out of yours in my controlla

I'm pushing 20, got no time for others (Pushing, pushing)
I'm pushing 20, got no time for others (Pushing, pushing)
Who ain't on the same wave, yeah, on the same page
Tryna tell me what to be, yeah, tell me what to think
I'm pushing 20, got no time for others (Pushing, pushing, pushing)
I'm pushing 20, got no time for others (Pushing, pushing, pushing)
Who ain't on the same wave, yeah, on the same page
Tryna tell me what to be, yeah, tell me what to think

I got no time, I got no time
No, no, no, no rewind
No, no rewind, yeah
I got no time, I got no time (I got no time, no)
No, no, no, no rewind (No, no, no, no, no rewind, no)
No, no rewind

I'm pushing 20, got no time for others (I'm pushing 20, babe)
I'm pushing 20, got no time for others (I'm pushing 20, babe)
Who ain't on the same wave, yeah, on the same page
Tryna tell me what to be, yeah, tell me what to think (Tell me what to be)
I'm pushing 20, got no time for others (I'm pushing, pushing, babe)
I'm pushing 20, got no time for others (You know it, know it, babe)
Who ain't on the same wave, yeah, on the same page
Tryna tell me what to be, yeah, tell me what to think

I got no time, I got no time
No, no, no, no rewind
No, no rewind, yeah (I got no)
I got no time, I got no time (I got no time, no)
No, no, no, no rewind (No, no, no, no rewind, no)
No, no rewind
