		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I found it six feet deep and the coffin was closed 
Another never ending story here I suppose 
You’ll never find god if you close your eyes 
Taking off my mask to the one I despise 

Suffocate while I’m counting down my final days 
Wishing on every star that you would leave me be 
How much do you curse my name? 
Tuck your tail between your legs and hang your head in shame 

I’ve got you in heels while you’re trying to find a reason to breathe 
As I’m silenced by my consciousness refusing to speak 
And now I’m counting down the days I can remember 
I can’t escape the memories 

Oblivion, is this the cost of day?
My choices have held me back
Only as the cost of a martyr 
Cause I’m no stranger to pain 

Cutting out my eyes at the cost of my own cornea 
Please don’t take it from me 
It happens over and over and I can’t stop my self from spinning so I 

Suffocate while I’m counting down my final days 
Wishing on every star that you would leave me be 
How much do you curse my name?
I can’t wait for the day you are 

Six feet deep and the coffin was closed 
Another never ending story here I suppose 
You’ll never find god if you close your eyes 
Taking off my mask to the one I despise

Waiting for the day that I can recover 
Watching the world as they kill one another 
I’m venting my pain, not a psycho analysis
I fear the day I cease to exist x2 

Overwhelming power 
Will destroy us all 

You’ll be begging to take your own life 
Overwhelming power.
