		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Did ya think I don’t mind that you never hit reply
‘Til you’re lying all alone at midnight
Funny how you’re so down now that Chelsea ain’t around
Lookin’ for another simp to hold tight
Your shirtless selfies make me nauseous
It’s sad you thought that I would want this, oh
I don’t know what pills you’re trippin’ on
Off and on
You should put ‘em back on the shelf
All these other girls you’re hittin’ on
Been kissin’ on
Gotta be bad for your health
You’ve been on a high
It’s time to tear you down
Bite your tongue, it tastes like someone else’s mouth
Thought that you could leave me hangin’ on
Waitin’ on
If I were you I’d hate myself when I tell you I’m gone
(I’m gone, I’m gone, I’m gone, I’m gone)
Did ya think I don’t see how your eyes are wandering
Everytime a blonde passes us by
Been playin’ too long
The feelin’s almost gone
Better make up your mind before I lose mine
If you just want a good time
I’ma be the bad guy
Promise you I’m not afraid to tell you goodbye
Why you lookin’ sideways
Should be lookin’ my way
Should be thinkin’ twice before you feed me those lies
(Those lies)
I don’t know what pills you’re trippin’ on
Off and on
You should put ‘em back on the shelf
All these other girls you’re hittin’ on
Been kissin’ on
Gotta be bad for your health
You’ve been on a high
It’s time to tear you down
Bite your tongue, it tastes like someone else’s mouth
Thought that you could leave me hangin’ on
Waitin’ on
If I were you I’d hate myself when I tell you I’m gone
(I’m gone, I’m gone, I’m gone, I’m gone)
When I tell you I’m gone
(I’m gone, I’m gone, I’m gone, I’m gone)
If you’d have had me
I’d have given you everything
I hope you’re happy
Now that you don’t have anything
I don’t know what pills you’re trippin’ on
Off and on
You should put ‘em back on the shelf
All these other girls you’re hittin’ on
Been kissin’ on
Gotta be bad for your health
You’ve been on a high
It’s time to tear you down
Bite your tongue, it tastes like someone else’s mouth
Thought that you could leave me hangin’ on
Waitin’ on
If I were you I’d hate myself when I tell you I’m gone
(I’m gone, I’m gone, I’m gone, I’m gone)
When I tell you I’m gone
(I’m gone, I’m gone, I’m gone, I’m gone)
