		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Where have you been
Why did you go back so soon
You say we had more time
When I looked in those eyes
 
Where have you gone
When you tell me you're so far
You say we had more time
When I looked in those eyes
 
So tell me so tell me
Will we both lose our minds

So tell me so tell me
Will we both lose our minds
 
Take me with your body right now
I would to love see you rolling
Take me with your body right now
I would to love see you rolling

Take me with your body right now
I would to love see you rolling, rolling
Take me with your body right now
I would to love see you rolling, rolling
 
Where have we been
Why did we come back so soon
I thought we had more time
When I looked in those eyes
 
Where did we go
When we were so far from home
I thought we had more time
When I looked in those eyes
 
So tell me so tell me
Will we both lose our minds

So tell me so tell me
Will we both lose our minds
 
Take me with your body right now
I would to love see you rolling
Take me with your body right now
I would to love see you rolling

Take me with your body right now
I would to love see you rolling, rolling
Take me with your body right now
I would to love see you rolling, rolling

Where have you been
Why did you go back so soon
You say we had more time
When I looked in those eyes
 
Where have you gone
When you tell me you're so far
You say we had more time
When I looked in those eyes

So tell me so tell me
Will we both lose our minds

So tell me so tell me
Will we both lose our minds

Take me with your body right now
I would to love see you rolling
Take me with your body right now
I would to love see you rolling

Take me with your body right now
I would to love see you rolling, rolling
Take me with your body right now
I would to love see you rolling, rolling
