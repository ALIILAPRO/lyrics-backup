		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Trace your way back fifty years
To the glow of Dresden, blood and tears
In the black above by the cruel searchlight
Men will die and men will fight, yeah

Who shot who and who fired first?
Dripping death to wet the blood thirst
No radar lock on skin and bone
The bomber boys are going home

Climb into the sky 
Never wonder why 
Tailgunner
You're a Tailgunner
Climb into the sky 
Never wonder why 
Tailgunner
You're a Tailgunner
Climb into the sky 
Never wonder why 
Tailgunner
You're a Tailgunner
Climb into the sky 
Never wonder why 
Tailgunner
You're a Tailgunner

Nail that Fokker, kill that son
Gonna blow your guts out with my gun
The weather forecasts' good for war
Cologne and Frankfurt? Have some more, hahaha

Tail end Charlie in the boiling sky
The Enola Gay was my last try
Now that this Tailgunner's gone
No more bombers, just one big bomb, yeah, ooh

Climb into the sky 
Never wonder why 
Tailgunner
You're a Tailgunner
Climb into the sky 
Never wonder why 
Tailgunner
You're a Tailgunner
Climb into the sky 
Never wonder why 
Tailgunner
You're a Tailgunner
Climb into the sky 
Never wonder why 
Tailgunner
You're a Tailgunner
