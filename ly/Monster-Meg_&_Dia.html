		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  His little whispers
"Love me, love me"
That's all I ask for
"Love me, love me"
He battered his tiny fists to feel something
Wondered what it's like to touch and feel something

Monster
How should I feel?
Creatures lie here
Looking through the window

That night he caged her
Bruised and broke her
He struggled closer
Then he stole her
Violet wrists and then her ankles
Silent pain
Then he slowly saw their nightmares were his dreams

Monster
How should I feel?
Creatures lie here
Looking through the windows
I will
Hear their voices
I'm a glass child
I am Hannah's regrets

Monster
How should I feel?
Turn the sheets down
Murder ears with pillow lace
There's bath tubs
Full of glow flies
Bathe in kerosene
Their words tattooed in his veins, yeah
