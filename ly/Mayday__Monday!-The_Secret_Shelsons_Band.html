		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Cannot Handle with that pain anymore
All the suffering I don't know what's worth for
I am surrounded by a mental bane
Waiting for the time to meet you once again
Little by little, all my happiness is drained
Precisely when I thought my luck just have changed
I stood with your pictures in my favorite site
While you discarded my soul and my heart
I promised you the world and you gave me all your lies
I'm trying to move on, but it's something really hard
I learned a lot from the things you've done to me
If you can't live alone, you will never be set free
I'm working hard trying to vanish from the world
Some things you do are more valuable than gold
I promised you the world and you gave me all your lies
I'm trying to move on, but it's something really hard
