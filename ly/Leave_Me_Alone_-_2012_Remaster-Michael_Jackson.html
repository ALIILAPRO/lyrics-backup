		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't care what you talkin' 'bout baby
I don't care what you say
Don't you come walkin' beggin' back mama
I don't care anyway
Dime after dime, I gave you all of my money
No excuses to make
Ain't no mountain that I can't climb baby
All is going my way

'Cause there's a time when you're right
And you know you must fight
Who's laughing baby, don't you know
And there's the choice that we make
And this choice you will take
Who's laughin' baby?

So just leave me alone
Leave me alone (leave me alone)
Leave me alone
Leave me alone (leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me alone)
Leave me alone (leave me alone) stop it!
Just stop doggin' me around

There was a time I used to say, "Girl I need you"
But who is sorry now?
You really hurt, you used to take and deceive me
Now who is sorry now?
You got a way of making me feel so sorry
I found out right away
Don't you come walkin', beggin', I ain't lovin' you
Don't you get in my way

'Cause there's a time when you're right
And you know you must fight
Who's laughing baby, don't you know
And there's the choice that we make
And this choice you will take
Who's laughin' baby?

So just leave me alone
Leave me alone (leave me alone)
Leave me alone
Leave me alone (leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me alone)
Leave me alone (leave me alone) stop it!
Just stop doggin' me around

'Cause there's a time when you're right
And you know you must fight
Who's laughing baby, don't you know, girl
And there's the choice that we make (that we make, and, that we make, and)
And this choice you will take
Who's laughin' baby?

So just leave me alone, girl
Leave me alone (leave me alone)
Leave me alone
Leave me alone (leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me alone)
Leave me alone (leave me alone) stop it!
Just stop doggin' me

Leave me alone (leave me alone, leave me alone)
Leave me alone
Leave me alone (leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me alone)
Leave me alone (leave me alone) stop it!
Just stop doggin' me around

Don't come beggin' me
Don't come beggin'
Don't come lovin' me
Don't come beggin'
I love you
I don't want it
I don't, I don't, I don't, I
Don't
Don't come beggin' me
Don't come beggin'
Don't come lovin' me
Don't come beggin'
