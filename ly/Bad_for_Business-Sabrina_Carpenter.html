		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  He's good for my heart but he's bad for business
Tears me apart when he grants my wishes
All of my friends think I've gone crazy
But they don't know me like my baby

We look good in photographs
I like the way you like to laugh at dirty jokes
I know they'll always land
Used to get work on time
But now you're taking up my nights
Never been so glad to be so tired

Ooh, I'm mad for you
It's sad but true and I know it
Ahh, you're on my mind
You stole my life and it's showin'

He's good for my heart but he's bad for business
Tears me apart when he grants my wishes
All of my friends think I've gone crazy
But they don't know me like my baby

If I'm just writing happy songs
Will anybody sing along?
You had to go and break into my head
And I would try to fight these feelings
I can't find a single reason
I'd make all the same mistakes again, ohh

Ooh, I'm mad for you
It's sad but true and I know it
Ahh, you're on my mind
You stole my life and it's showin'

He's good for my heart but he's bad for business
Tears me apart when he grants my wishes
All of my friends think I've gone crazy
But they don't know me like my baby

He's good (good), it's bad (bad)
The best I've ever had (best I've ever had)
And he's so nice, it's sad (it's sad)
He ruined all my plans
And he just makes me so crazy
I know everyone sees
That he'll be the death of me

He's good for my heart but he's bad for business (he's very bad for business)
Tears me apart when he grants my wishes
All of my friends think I've gone crazy
But they don't know me like my baby

He's good for my heart but he's bad for business (so bad)
Tears me apart when he grants my wishes
All of my friends think I've gone crazy
But they don't know me like my baby
