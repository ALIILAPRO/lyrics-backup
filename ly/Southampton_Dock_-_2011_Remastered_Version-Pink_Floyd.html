		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They disembarked in 45 
And no-one spoke and no-one smiled 
There were to many spaces in the line. 
Gathered at the cenotaph 
All agreed with the hand on heart 
To sheath the sacrificial Knifes. 
But now 
She stands upon Southampton dock 
With her handkerchief 
And her summer frock clings 
To her wet body in the rain. 
In quiet desperation knuckles 
White upon the slippery reins 
She bravely waves the boys Goodbye again. 

And still the dark stain spreads between 
His shoulder blades. 
A mute reminder of the poppy fields and graves. 
And when the fight was over 
We spent what they had made. 
But in the bottom of our hearts 
We felt the final cut.
