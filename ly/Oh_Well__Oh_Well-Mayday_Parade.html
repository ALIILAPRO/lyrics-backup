		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When you're alone, do you think of me?
And my diamond rings thrown out to sea
And when you love, do you love for me?
Like harmony, a never ending dream

Oh well, oh well
I still hope for the best
Say goodbye and send me off with a kiss farewell
And I promise I'll be just as strong as I can be
Maybe you could get some sleep tonight

So here's your song, it's twisting me
I'd give anything to make you scream
And I'll just smile and make believe I don't feel a thing
That doesn't work for me

Oh well, oh well
Guess I'll see you in hell
There's a pretty little picture that's in my head
And I'm starting to dream
Changing colors while I sleep
Maybe I'm just wasting time

Sit still and listen to the soundtrack
I'll tell you how I took one straight through the heart
And it's not easy to talk about
So we all scream loud

And that was it
I had made it clean just across the street with my new wings
So I'll just fly and hope that I remember the good times when it's done

Oh well, oh well
I can't live with myself
As I'm climbing in your window to get to your bed
And I'll be what you need
You can call me anything
Just as long as we're still friends

Sit still and listen to the soundtrack
I'll tell you how I took one straight through the heart
And it's not easy to talk about
So we all sing

When she smiles, it's got nothing to do with me
I'm not the one who sings her to sleep
And I've been talking to God
Asking for just a little help with you
But it's hopeless

It's not the first time, but this one really carved it in
Tell your new friends that they don't know you like I do
It's over
I wanna see you again
I wanna feel it again

It's not the first time, but this one really carved it in
Tell your new friends that no one knows you like I do
It's over
I wanna see you again
I wanna feel it again

I'll keep you warm, safe in my arms
Till heaven calls, keep holding on
