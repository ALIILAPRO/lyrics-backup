		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't know if I'm okay
You're not asking either way
Because of you I'm always testin' the brakes
So if you leave 'least I was playin' it safe

If I fall and you don't catch me
I still take the blame
Out of all the reasons to leave me
I thought you would stay

I'm so sick of gettin' so blinded
From always tryin' to look where the light is
I'm so sick of your silver linings
And always tryin' to justify why you leave me this way

Maybe I should move away
Think that somethings gotta change
Sometimes I wonder if it's me or this place
Who would I be if I got out of LA?

If I fall and you don't catch me
I still take the blame
Out of all the reasons to leave me
I thought you would stay

I'm so sick of gettin' so blinded
From always tryin' to look where the light is
I'm so sick of your silver linings
And always tryin' to justify why you leave me this way

Change my mind, I give up
This time I'm letting you go
Close the blinds, call it off
This time I want you to know
Change my mind, I give up
This time I'm letting you go
Close the blinds, call it off
This time I want you to know

Change my mind, I give up
This time I'm letting you go
Close the blinds, call it off
This time I want you to know
Change my mind, I give up
This time I'm letting you go
Close the blinds, call it off
This time I want you to know

I'm so sick of gettin' so blinded
From always tryin' to look where the light is
I'm so sick of your silver linings
And always tryin' to justify why you leave me this way
