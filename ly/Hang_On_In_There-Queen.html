		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't let go
Don't lose your mystique
Wait a little longer
Tomorrow brings another feast

Don't let go
Don't lose your reputation
Thank God you're still alive, ha
You're still in one piece

Hang on in there, don't lose your appetite
Hang on in there, forget the danger signs
Pray for that magical moment (just stay there) and it will appear
(Don't fight for lost emotions)
Wait for the sunrise,
And everything will seem so clear
(Look straight ahead, look straight ahead)

Hang on in there (hang on in there)
Hang on in there (hang on in there)
Your wish will be granted
All your problems will disappear

Don't be a fool
You haven't reached your peak
You've got a fast car racing up inside you
Your life is incomplete

Hang on in there, hang on in there
Pray for that magical moment and it will appear
(Wait for the moment)
Wait for the sunrise - oh
Just wait and see and it will seem so clear
Ba dap bap ee bap bap ba ba bap bap de de de da
Hey
And let's go, let's go - o.k. now do the change now
Hang on
Yeah
Hang on in there, hang on in there
Yeah hang on in there, yeah
