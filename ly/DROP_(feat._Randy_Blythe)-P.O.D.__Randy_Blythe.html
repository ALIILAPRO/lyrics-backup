		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Spit fire, dripping from my lips
Take me higher in the mix
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock
'Til you drop
Let it rock 'til you drop
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock
Let it rock, let it rock 'til you

Move, move the crowd
Now everybody get down
We're going straight to the top
Now let the whole world (drop)

Don't ever play with fire 'cause you might get burned
And if you play with fire you're gonna get 
(Burned)

Spit fire, dripping from my lips
Take me higher in the mix
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock
'Til you drop
Let it rock 'til you drop
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock
Let it rock, let it rock 'til you 
Drop, drop, drop
(Rock 'til) drop, drop, drop
Rock 'til- drop, drop, drop
(Rock 'til) drop, drop, drop
(Rock until you)

Set fire to the system
Set fire 'til they listen
Set fire to the system
(Now watch the whole world drop)

Don't ever play with fire 'cause you might get burned
If you play with fire you're gonna get
(Burned)

Spit fire, dripping from my lips
Take me higher in the mix
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock
'Til you drop
Let it rock 'til you drop
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock
Let it rock, let it rock 'til you 
Drop, drop, drop
(Rock 'til) drop, drop, drop
Rock 'til- drop, drop, drop
(Rock 'til) drop, drop, drop
(Rock until you)

(Burn) go
(Burn) rock 'til you
(Burn, fire burn)
Drop that
Drop that
(Now watch the whole world drop)

Spit fire, dripping from my lips
Take me higher in the mix
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock
'Til you drop
Let it rock 'til you drop
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock
Let it rock, let it rock 'til you 
Drop, drop, drop
(Rock 'til) drop, drop, drop
Rock 'til- drop, drop, drop
(Rock 'til) drop, drop, drop
(Rock until you)
