		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Before she even falls asleep
I got one foot out the door, one foot out the door
I think she said her name but I was wasted
I don't care anymore, one foot out the door

Night after night, day after day
Jack and coke smokin' on the fire escape
Is it to soon or is it to late

Am I crazy to think that I could be in love when it all ends up
it all ends up wasted
I'd give you my heart, but I'd just fuck it up
we'd end up, we'd end up wasted
La la la la la la la

So I numb the pain away, I know I'd leave but not stay
I wonder if I will ever find someone to fill me up inside
someone to kiss my fears away
If I believed in god I'd pray, to god I'd pray

Am I crazy to think that I could be in love when it all ends up
it all ends up wasted
I'd give you my heart, but I'd just fuck it up
we'd end up, we'd end up wasted
La la la la la la la

Night after night, day after day
Jack and coke smokin' on the fire escape
Is it to soon or is it to late

Am I crazy to think that I could be in love when it all ends up
it all ends up wasted
I'd give you my heart, but I'd just fuck it up
we'd end up, we'd end up wasted
I say we'd end up wasted, ooh

La la la la la la la

We'd end up wasted
