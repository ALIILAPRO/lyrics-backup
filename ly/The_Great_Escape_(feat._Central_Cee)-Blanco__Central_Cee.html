		  (WhyJay)

(Stuck in) stuck in a trap, gotta get outta that so I'm planning the great escape
I'm in two minds, should I handle this flake or should I go H.A.M on this tape
See Jakes, set pace, stay calm, I'll handle the chase don't slam on the brakes
These hoes that I fucked way back in the day keep baiting my government name

Bro love splash, he ain't bathing but he's with Chelsea and that's so Raven
Hate Blancs, everybody loves Raymond, Naghz might run out the car, he ain't aiming
Ghost but I'm back like Kanan, govs in my room and they're all Caucasian
Tension with one man, strain it, she tryna cuff but I'm here restraining
Open a window, need ventilation, bando need renovating
They had their time but they got relegated, clear that they ain't educated
I probs got a chance with the rap, I feel like they're feeling my cadence
She give me that head, she decapitate, OT, I ain't jeeted in ages
Free Jojo, he ain't Mojo but he love bread and a buttercup
Thameside, got the brothers stuck, Jakes with the judge gotta cover up
5 A.M. and I'm banking a mash, Mizmac gotta watch for the govs
Move cah they watching at us, broski's gone but he watching above

Stuck in a trap, gotta get outta that so I'm planning the great escape
I'm in two minds, should I handle this flake or should I go H.A.M on this tape
See Jakes, set pace, stay calm, I'll handle the chase don't slam on the brakes
These hoes that I fucked way back in the day keep baiting my government name

Sing to police like Backstreet boys and Jodeci
Head down with a mask on still and they noticed me
18k for the pendant piece was the total fee
Toxic relationship with my queen, she got a hold of me
Lizzy, my main concern, everything else can wait
It was family first, it's sad, my bad, I had to get paid
Convos long, sometimes I ain't bothered, I'm moving like Catherine Tate
Tryna bring in a pack into tape like "Yo, anyone want yay?"
They sing to police tryna beat their case, singing like B2K
I wanna play, she want chanay, I'm banging out wewantwraiths
She got a man, I don't care about that, what's he gon' say?
She can get this D when it elongates, she ain't getting no T-bone steak
Love them Brazilian beats, Cah I grew in favelas, I'm still in the streets
Stank proof under the fleece and Jakes find a hand ting under the seat
Hundred racks that's tax VAT, we don't do no B&E
They don't ball like they fractured their knee, CID tryna capture the free
Taking a bad one away for a one time date, man I'm so astonished
TG like 007, that's quantum of solace
Bro got caught with the bug but the virus ain't torrents
Sitting down with a brown one but Goldilocks hates porridge

Stuck in a trap, gotta get outta that so I'm planning the great escape
I'm in two minds, should I handle this flake or should I go H.A.M on this tape
See Jakes, set pace, stay calm, I'll handle the chase don't slam on the brakes
These hoes that I fucked way back in the day keep baiting my government name

Sing to police like Backstreet boys and Jodeci
Head down with a mask on still and they noticed me
18k for the pendant piece was the total fee
Toxic relationship with my queen, she got a hold of me
