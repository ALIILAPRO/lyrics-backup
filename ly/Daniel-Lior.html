		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Steppin' into a doorway in my mind,
This is where you live,
It's where you live,
I forgot the things that I could find,
I have not been in here for years.

Hi-igh, hi-igh igh igh ya high-igh 

I climbed the stairs that hide beneath the vines,
I walked through the over-growth of time,
Up to where we sat in clouds of smoke,
Up to when we swam in pools of hope.

Hi-igh, hi-igh igh igh ya High-igh
Hi-igh igh igh ohh ooo high-igh hi-igh igh igh ya high igh igh 

And all the while I'm looking for your half smile,
Something that will show me that you are still around,
And all the while I'm looking for you half smile,
Something that will show me ooooh that you still know me,
Yeah you still know me.

Further on the pavement starts to crack,
This is where we fell, it's where we fell,
Where smoke turns to haze,
I hesitate, and I choose to lead the way I came.

Hi-igh, hi-igh igh igh ya High-igh 

Outside it's overcast and visions hard to find,
But the memories will be my guide,
Cause even though I know our skins have changed,
The colours that we share, they still remain.

Hi-igh, hi-igh igh igh ya High-igh 

And all the while I'm looking for your half smile,
Something that will show me that you are still around,
And all the while I'm looking for you half smile,
Something that will show me ooooh that you still know me,
yeah you still know me.

Step into a doorway in my mind,
This is where you live Daniel.
