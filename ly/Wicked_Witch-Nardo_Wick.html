Uh, uh, I'm a wicked nigga, she my wicked witch
Uh, uh, glick in her Chanel, she a wicked bitch
Uh, when we fuck we cum in sync, we have wicked sex
Uh, uh, keep it up and we gon' make a mini Wick

Uh, uh, bitch, I get that dope like a gentleman
Uh, don't be scared 'cause I got guns, babe, I'm a gentleman
Uh, bitches knockin' out my heart, bro, I won't let 'em in
Uh, can't get mad, baby, you know I'm a ladies' man
Uh, don't be insecure, your spot's secured, I promise you
Uh, know she safe with me, when evil comes, she know I shoot
Uh, trained her very well, the police come, I know she mute
Uh, call her pretty every hour though she know she cute
Uh, uh, she know I'm a gangster (she know I'm a gangster)
Shawty keep me outta trouble so I thank her (so I thank her)
You take away my anger (take away my anger)
I need you to hold me down, be my anchor (my anchor)
She take pictures with my banger (take pictures with my banger)
And I hope them niggas know that pussy come with danger
My mama said, "Don't talk to strangers" (don't talk to no strangers)
And 'fore you ever act up, bitch, I see you're stranger
Uh, uh, she said, "Fix your shirt, bae, your gun showin'"
Uh, uh, I said, "Fix your shorts, bae, your butt showin'"
She know if I up this torch then this gun blowin'
I say, "Them hoes can't fuck with you," she say, "Bae, I'm knowin'"

She want Gucci (Gucci), Louis (Louis), Dior (Dior)
Prada (Prada), Fendi (Fendi), Chanel (Chanel), Balenci' (Balenci')
