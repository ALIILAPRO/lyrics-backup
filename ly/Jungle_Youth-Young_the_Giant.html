		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't stop listening to this voice in my head
Got me tearing through the covers on this rusty spring bed
Bust through the doors
Flames kissing my back
That's all I remember and then everything's black
You know, it sounds so familiar
Some place hot in my soul
Hello transmission, now you're in control

I look up
I look down
Everybody's bathing in Holy Water
Ain't enough going around
Raise their cups
Wear their crowns
You're sitting on a gold-stained altar
Feel the jungle youth sound, ooh ooh

I woke in a fever taste the blood in my mouth
My eyes bruised shiny purple and I'm riddled with doubt
It feels so peculiar, boiling hot in my soul
Farewell transmission: not meant for this world

I look up
I look down
Everybody's bathing in Holy Water
Ain't enough going around
Raise their cups
Wear their crowns
You're sitting on a gold-stained altar
Feel the jungle youth sound, ooh ooh

Tonight, drifted off to sleep
Tonight must be having a bad dream when

I look up
I look down
Everybody's bathing in Holy Water
Ain't enough going around
Raise their cups
Wear their crowns
You're sitting on a gold-stained altar
Feel the jungle youth sound, ooh ooh
