		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey, how long have you been crawling
With the sick and the appalling
It's like a cancer
Hey, you gotta rise up out of darkness
Gotta leave behind the heartless
You'll find the answer

If you're the last on Earth
Feel like you're damned or cursed
You have come to the right place
And if you have lost yourself
You can escape the hell
You have come to the right place

Sometimes you feel like giving up
Sometimes you've bled out enough
Sometimes you've got to believe in something
'Cause you're not the only one
Standing there losing blood
You have come to the right place this time

Hey, how long have you been rotting
Your veins are slowly clotting
You're growing weaker
Hey, you gotta wake up from the nightmare
There's nothing you will find there
Except the reaper

If you're the last on Earth
Feel like you're damned or cursed
You have come to the right place
And if you have lost yourself
You can escape the hell
You have come to the right place

Sometimes you feel like giving up
Sometimes you've bled out enough
Sometimes you've got to believe in something
'Cause you're not the only one
Standing there losing blood
You have come to the right place

Sometimes you feel like giving up
Sometimes you've bled out enough
Sometimes you've got to believe in something
'Cause you're not the only one
Standing there losing blood
You have come to the right place

If you're the last on Earth
Feel like you're damned or cursed
You have come to the right place
And if you have lost yourself
You can escape the hell
You have come to the right place

Sometimes you feel like giving up
Sometimes you've bled out enough
Sometimes you've gotta believe in something
'Cause you're not the only one
Standing there losing blood
You have come to the right place this time
