		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (I don't like to be back)

You see things in life
And you're bit surprise what you see
Life, your whole life, is changes
You go through changes in your life
One second you've got it made
Next second you're down in the dumps
And it goes back and forth
Throughout your whole life
One second you've got the most beautiful girl in the world
Next second you don't even have a girlfriend no more
And it goes back and forth
And back and forth, you known
And this is life man, it's changes
This is what you gotta go through throughout your whole lifetime

I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes

And it goes back and forth
And back and forth, you known

Never
Never
Land
