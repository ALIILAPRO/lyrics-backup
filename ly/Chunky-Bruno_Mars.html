		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She got to shake her little something (shake her little something), ooh
Throwing that thing from left, right, side-to-side
She got to have her own money (she got her own money), oh yeah
Shout out to the girls that pay they rent on time

If you ain't here to party take your ass back home
If you getting naughty, baby here's my phone
Slide with your boy to the bar
Slide with your boy to the car
I've been searching everywhere and now here you are

Ooh, chunky
Looking for them girls with the big old hoops
That drop it down in Daisy Dukes (I wanna get down)
Yeah, them the ones I'm trying to recruit
I'm looking at you
Yeah, you, baby (baby, baby)

Now let me hear you say you ready (I'm ready), oh yeah
Girl, you better have you hair weave strapped on tight
'Cause once we get going, we rolling, we'll cha-cha 'til the morning
So just say alright (alright)

If you ain't here to party take your ass back home
If you getting naughty, baby here's my phone
Slide with your boy to the bar
Slide with your boy to the car
I've been searching everywhere and now here you are

Ooh, chunky
Looking for them girls with the big old hoops
That drop it down in Daisy Dukes (I wanna get down)
Yeah, them the ones I'm trying to recruit
I'm looking at you
Yeah, you, baby (baby, baby)

Ow, you got what I want (I got what you want)
Girl, you got what I need (I got what you need)
Thirty-seven, twenty-seven, forty-two, ooh
Squeeze all of that into my coupe
Girl, I, I choo-oose you

Chunky
Looking for them girls with the big old hoops
That drop it down in Daisy Dukes (I wanna get down)
Yeah, them the ones I'm trying to recruit
I'm looking at you
Yeah, you, baby

Chunky
Looking for them girls with the big old hoops
That drop it down in Daisy Dukes (I wanna get down)
Yeah, them the ones I'm trying to recruit
Hey, I'm looking at you
Yeah, you, baby (baby, baby)
