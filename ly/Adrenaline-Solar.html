		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  adrenaline rushing through my vain
I forgot all the pain
I drink , lit , drip for life to lose my sight of emptiness
try everything to forget cause I might lose my control
​
questions you ask too much
Sheeze cause you might be getting hurt
no one to trust
​
I don't know what i should want, I don't know where to go
​

fire
rising up to higher
I'm buring up it's dire
I don't wanna burn you so leave
I don't wanna keep you to be a lier

don't wanna hurt you
you should leave me
I'm no good for you
so leave me now

please leave me now
I can't keep you sane
​

another world
if there's a chance
I'll take
​

mo money more love I got everything I don't need more
I won't tell you who i am
it's you to figure out from the inside my heart
​
I don't know what I should want, I don't know where to go
​
fire
rising up to higher
I'm buring up it's dire
I don't wanna burn you so leave
I don't wanna keep you to be a lier

don't wanna hurt you
you should leave me
I'm no good for you

so leave me now
please leave me now
I can't keep you sane

another world
if there's a chance
I'll take


adrenaline rushing through my vain
I forgot all the pain
I drink , lit , drip for life to lose my sight of emptiness
