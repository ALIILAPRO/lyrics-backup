		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well I'm just a post, of which you lean
Never your love, just a go between
Change of a heart, that can't be free
The image of a man I thought I'd be

Alone so low with misery
Nothing but blues for company
Well if things get worse, I can't shake this curse
Then start draggin' the river for me

Well the flame of love, once won my soul
Now it's a spot, so dark and cold
Tears that I've cried, won't flow no more
'Cause my heart just died at heaven's door

Alone so low with misery
Nothing but blues for company
Well if things get worse, I can't shake this curse
Then start draggin' the river for me
Then start draggin' the river for me (oh, oh, oh)
