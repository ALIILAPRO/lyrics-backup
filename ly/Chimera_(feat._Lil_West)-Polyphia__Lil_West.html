		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Good girl in a costume
It's your world when I'm with you
Forever with you like a tattoo
I paint a picture in a bad mood
Shoot through the breeze like a parachute
I got cheese, get a pair of shoes
Big body, need a lot of room
She keep callin' when I'm never home

I'll be what you need, lowkey
On the east, I can see everything that you went through
I'll be your tool, I can fix you
Even if I lose, it'd be nothing new
She old news and I'm old school
It's my rules when I make moves
I make it rain like a monsoon
My new bae, can you come soon?

The best high was the best ride
She said that she really wanna come out to the west side
If she comin' with me she can hit me with her best side
She can be my missus, give me kisses on our bedside

Lowkey when we in the night
You want me, bet it's movin' right
Hold me, I'm a lil' vibe
You know me, 'cause I'm on the rise
