		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One can have a dream, baby
Two can make that dream so real
One can talk about being in love
Two can see how it really feels

One can wish upon a star
Two can make a wish come true, yeah
One can stand alone in the dark
Two can make a light shine through

It takes two, baby
It takes two, baby
Me and you
It just - takes two

It takes two, baby
It takes two, baby
Make a dream come true
It just takes two

One can have a broken heart
Living in misery
Two can really ease the pain
Like a perfect remedy
One can be alone in a bar
Like an island he's all alone
Two can make just any place
Seem just like bein' at home

It takes two, baby
It takes two, baby
Me and you
It just takes two
It takes two, baby
It takes two, baby
To make a dream come true
It just take two

Ooh-ooh
Hoo, hoo-ooh
Hoo, hoo-ooh
Hoo, hoo

Just takes two
Just takes two

Ooh
One can go out to a movie
Looking for a special treat
Two can make that single movie
Something really kind of sweet
Yeah, one can take a walk in the moonlight
Thinking that's it's really nice
But two - walking hand in hand
Is like adding just a pinch of spice (yeah)

It takes two, baby
It takes two, baby
Me and you
Just takes two
It takes two, baby
It takes two, baby
To make a dream come true
Just takes two
