		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Little Lamb, who made thee?
Dost thou know who made thee?
Gave thee life, and bid thee feed
By the stream and o'er the mead
Gave thee clothing of delight
Softest clothing, woolly, bright
Gave thee such a tender voice
Making all the vales rejoice?
Little Lamb, who made thee?
Dost thou know who made thee?

Little Lamb, I'll tell thee
Little Lamb, I'll tell thee
He is called by thy name
For He calls Himself a Lamb
He is meek, and He is mild
He became a little child
I a child, and thou a lamb
We are called by His name
Little Lamb, God bless thee
Little Lamb, God bless thee!
