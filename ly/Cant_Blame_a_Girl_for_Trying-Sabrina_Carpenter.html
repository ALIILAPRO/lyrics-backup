		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here I am again, the same old situation
Why does the guy thing have to be so complicated
I should've played it cool, instead I made a fool
Oh, the things I do

'Cause I'm young and I'm dumb
I do stupid things when it comes to love
And even if I always end up crying
Well, you can't blame a girl for trying, oh oh

No, you can't blame a girl for trying, oh

I should've shut my mouth, I could've kept it quiet
I might have freaked him out 'cause I was so excited
But I just couldn't wait, I took a leap of faith
Oh, the things I say

'Cause I'm young and I'm dumb
I do stupid things when it comes to love
And even if I always end up crying
Well, you can't blame a girl for trying, oh oh

No, you can't blame a girl for trying, oh no no

And I think sometimes I tend to be my own worst enemy
And maybe someday
I'm gonna catch a shooting star falling out of the blue
Do what I do

And just as I'm giving up, my heart is palpitating
Here comes another one and it's so intoxicating
Being where I've been I know that in the end
I'll do it all again

'Cause I'm young and I'm dumb
I do stupid things when it comes to love
And even if I always end up crying
Well, love will find me, there ain't no denying
That you can't blame a girl for trying, oh oh

No, you can't blame a girl for trying, hm oh
