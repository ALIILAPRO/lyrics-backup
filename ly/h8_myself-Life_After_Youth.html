		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wish I may, I wish I might
With all my heart I hate my life
You can change your clothes or change your mind
Still you're always gonna be just a parasite
I wish I could, I wish cared
But the truth is no one's really there
I want her nose, I want your hair
I wish that I could be somebody and someone cared
Oh I wanna be someone else
Who it doesn’t matter, just hate myself
Yeah I wanna be someone else
Throw a rock out a window, I’ll be who it kills
Throw a rock out a window, I’ll be who it kills
Throw a rock out a window, I’ll be who it kills
I look good, yeah I look great
I’m fat, I’m fit, I’m underweight
But it don’t matter who I am
All I’m worth is my reflection
Cause you see a man be strong, a man stands tall
But men don’t feel nothing at all
You’re weak in life, you die so small
Doing bench press at a funeral
Oh I wanna be someone else
Who it doesn’t matter, just hate myself
Yeah I wanna be someone else
Throw a rock out a window, I’ll be who it kills
Throw a rock out a window, I’ll be who it kills
Throw a rock out a window, I’ll be who it kills
Oh I wanna be someone else
Who it doesn’t matter, just hate myself
Yeah I wanna be someone else
Throw a rock out a window, I’ll be who it kills
Shoot a gun out a window, I’ll be who it kills
Throw myself out a window, I’ll be who I kill
