		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She was the kind of girl
Beauty
You think you know
You know that you want her
Take time don't be afraid
You can always refrain
You can always pay later

Ooh the things you do now
Ooh the way you play now
Ooh

Could've made her
You could've made her
Could've made her
You know you could've made her

She was the kind of girl
Beauty
You think you know
You know that you want her
Fake lights burning bright
Fake fur she wears tonight
You know you can pay later

Ooh the things you do now
Ooh the way you play now
Ooh

Could've made her
You could've made her
Could've made her
You know you could've made her

Could've made her
I know you could've made her
Could've made her
You know you could've made her

Could've made her
You could've made her
Could've made her
I know you could've made her
