		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Coming from an endless place
Heaven hits me when I see your face
I go blind, every time

Hate to have to watch you go
Thought I'd been through this
Lord knows, I've been trying and I'm still trying

You'll never be mine
You'll never be mine
You'll never be mine
You'll never be mine
You'll never be mine
You'll never be mine

But I would watch you, I would watch you
Turn and walk away
I would watch you, look right through me
Right through every word that I say

He wants to know why
He wants to know why
I only want to know you
I want to tell him
I know the feeling
This time I swear that I do

But I would watch you, I would watch you
Turn and walk away
Yes, I would watch you, learn to love you
And her, too, if you'd only stay, but

But, you'll never be mine
You'll never be mine
You'll never be mine
You'll never be mine
You'll never be mine
You'll never be mine

He wants to know why
He wants to know why
I only want to know you
I want to tell him
I know the feeling
This time I swear that I do
This time I swear that I do
This time I swear that I do

But I will turn and walk away
I will watch you turn and walk away
