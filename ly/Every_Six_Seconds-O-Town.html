		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Every six seconds 
Baby I can't stop 
My mind from slipping 
Every six seconds or less 
Preoccupation of the opposite sex 
And you're the one I blame 
For making me go missing

I think of you and drift away 
Fourteen thousand times a day 
Victoria's Secret I've been keepin' 
And its getting harder all the time 
I can't keep it undercover 
I need your soft lips kissing mine 

Every six seconds 
My body starts beggin'
Your sweet thing is wreckin' me
Until you give me some 
Ten times a minute 
Six hundred times an hour 
Another cold shower 
Until you give me some 

I picture you in red matte lipstick 
Sponging all over me 
Leaving a mark on my fantasy 
Or swimming in water wearing nothing but moonlight 
Both of us soaking wet
Half way to the towel is as far as we get 
Victoria's Secret I've been keepin' 
And its getting harder all the time 
I can't keep it undercover 
I need your soft lips kissing mine 

Every six seconds 
My body starts beggin'
Your sweet thing is wreckin' me
Until you give me some 
Ten times a minute 
Six hundred times an hour 
Another cold shower 
Until you give me some 

Every six seconds 
My body starts beggin'
Your sweet thing is messin' me
Until you give me some 
Ten times a minute 
Six hundred times an hour 
Another cold shower 
Girl you got the power
Until you give me some 

Thoughts of you keep swimming through my veins
Night and day 
And I cannot concentrate on anything 
But this urge I have inside 

Every six seconds 
Every six seconds 
Until you give me some 
Every six seconds 
Every six seconds 
Until you give me some 
Every six seconds 
My body starts beggin'
Your sweet thing is wreckin me
Until you give me some 

Ten times a minute 
Six hundred times an hour 
Another cold shower 
Until you give me some 
Every six seconds 
My body starts begging 
Your sweet thing is wreckin' me 
Until you give me some 
Ten times a minute 
Six hundred times an hour 
Girl you got the power 
Until you give me some 
Every six seconds
