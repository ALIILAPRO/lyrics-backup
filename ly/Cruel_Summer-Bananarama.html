		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hot summer streets and the pavements are burning, I sit around 
Trying to smile but the air is so heavy and dry

Strange voices are saying
(What did they say)
Things I can't understand
It's too close for comfort
This heat has got right out of hand

It's a cruel, (cruel), cruel summer
Leaving me here on my own
It's a cruel, (it's a cruel), cruel summer
Now you're gone

The city is crowded my friends are away and I'm on my own
It's too hot to handle so I got to get up and go

It's a cruel, (cruel), cruel summer
Leaving me here on my own
It's a cruel, (it's a cruel), cruel summer
Now you're gone
You're not the only one

It's a cruel, (cruel), cruel summer
(Leaving me), leaving me here on my own
It's a cruel, (it's a cruel), cruel summer
Now you're gone

It's a cruel, cruel summer
Leaving me here on my own
It's a cruel, cruel summer
Now you're gone
You're not the only one

It's a cruel, (cruel), cruel summer
(Leaving me) leaving me here on my own
It's a cruel, (it's a cruel), cruel summer
Now you're gone
You're not the only one

It's a cruel, (cruel), cruel summer
(Leaving me), leaving me here on my own
It's a cruel, (it's a cruel), cruel summer
Now you're gone
