		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm afraid I love someone
Who's in love with someone else
For years I've kept it to myself
Pretending we are picture perfect

But I've barely got my shit together
Cracking under little pressure
I'm afraid I'm not the one
The one you want is someone else

They say hope is a dangerous, dangerous little thing
To keep finding out the hard way
What tomorrow never brings
They say hope is a dangerous, dangerous little thing
To keep finding out the hard way
What tomorrow never brings, never brings

I passed a restaurant burned to the ground
And a dollar store with a burned out "A"
Laughed thinking that I relate
I'm the junk you buy then you throw away

Hide the bloodshot, close my eyes
So our cover won't be compromised
I'm afraid I'm not the one
The one you want is someone else

They say hope is a dangerous, dangerous little thing
To keep finding out the hard way
What tomorrow never brings
They say hope is a dangerous, dangerous little thing
To keep finding out the hard way
What tomorrow never brings, never brings

Sometimes I wanna blow up my life
And become someone else, yeah yeah
Sometimes I wanna blow up my life
And become someone else, yeah yeah
Sometimes I wanna blow up my life
And become someone else, yeah yeah
Sometimes I wanna blow up my life
And become someone else, yeah yeah

They say hope is a dangerous, dangerous little thing
To keep finding out the hard way
What tomorrow never brings
They say hope is a dangerous, dangerous little thing
To keep finding out the hard way
What tomorrow never brings

They say hope is a dangerous, dangerous little thing
To keep finding out the hard way
What tomorrow never brings
