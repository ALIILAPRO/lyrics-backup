		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Walkin' 'round this house
Wondering where you are
And drowning in tequila so I don't have to feel a thing
And why am I so good at walkin' away?
And how many times in my life was I supposed to stay?

Where do we go from here?
I don't wanna say goodbye yet
But I've been holdin' on to this for years
Where do we go from here?
It's too far to see the ending
But I know that you'll be waiting for me there
Waiting for me there

Stay here, stay close, stay real
Stay far enough away to not get hurt
'Cause I don't wanna feel like I did when I left
And I've been dreading this but I think I want it
I never thought that I'd say it
Maybe it's just the time to call it
As much as it hurts to

Where do we go from here?
I don't wanna say goodbye yet
But I've been holdin' on to this for years
Where do we go from here?
It's too far to see the ending
But I know that you'll be waiting for me there
Waiting for me there

Where do we go from here?
Where do we go from here?

All of these memories
And all that we could have been
I will hold them all with me
I will hold you with me

Where do we go from here?
I don't wanna say goodbye yet
But I've been holdin' on to this for years
Where do we go from here?
It's too far to see the ending
But I know that you'll be waiting for me there
Waiting for me there

Where do we go from here?
Where do we go from here?

Where do we go, where do we go?
Where do we-

Where do we go, where do we go?
Where do we-

Where do we go, where do we go?
Where do we-

Where do we go, where do we go?
Where do we-
