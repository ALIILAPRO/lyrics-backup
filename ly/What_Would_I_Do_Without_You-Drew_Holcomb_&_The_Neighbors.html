		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sometimes I wake up with the sadness
Other days it feels like madness
Oh, what would I do without you?

When colors turn to shades of grey
With the weight of the world at the end of the day
Oh, what would I do without you?

A decade goes by without a warning
And there's still a kindness in your eyes
Amidst the questions and the worries
A peace of mind, always takes me by surprise

I feel like I'm walking with eyes as blind
As a man without a lantern in a coal mine
What would I do without you?

My imagination gets the best of me
And I'm trying to hide lost at sea
What would I do without you?

The difference between what I've said and done
And you're still standing by my side
A guilty soul and a worried mind
I will never make it, if I'm on my own

So you got the morning, I got midnight
You are patient, I'm always on time
Oh, what would I do without you?

You got your sunshine, I got rain clouds
You got hope, I got my doubts

Oh, what would I do without you?
Oh, what would I do without you?
Oh, what would I do without you?
