		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You are just like me
 And I am just like you
 Ain't no doubting
I, I knew it there and then 
When I laid eyes on you

Ain't no reason 
Why we should stop 
When the fevers so hot
 You know we got nothing to loose
And This love needs no taming 
Let's start misbehaving
 Tonight we're breaking the rules

We are gonna dance, dance, dance 
Till the sun goes up 
So let's live our lives
 And just fill our cups
We don't care bout them 
cause it's only us 
So Let's live our life's 
And just fill our cups

Look into your soul 
Never let me go 
Hypnotized oh my
My heart is like a drum 
Going ram pam pam

 All night long 
We ain't gonna stop 
Cause the fevers so hot
 You know we got nothing to loose
And This love needs no taming 
Let's start misbehaving
 Tonight we're breaking the rules  

We are gonna dance, dance, dance 
Till the sun goes up 
So let's live our lives
 And just fill our cups
We don't care bout them 
cause it's only us
 So Let's live our life's 
And just fill our cups
