		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  At the end of a rainbow, you'll find a pot of gold
At the end of a story, you'll find it's all been told
But our love has a treasure our hearts can always spend
And it has a story without any end

At the end of a river, the water stops its flow
At the end of a highway, there's no place you can go
But just tell me you love me and you are only mine
And our love will go on 'til the end of time

At the end of a river, the water stops its flow
At the end of a highway, there's no place you can go
But just tell me you love me and you are only mine
And our love will go on 'til the end of time

'Til the end of time
