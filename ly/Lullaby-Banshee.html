		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Banshee hang you on the cross
You played games you fucking lost
Liar liar in the trunk
Ay this is where I died
Listen close at night
You can hear me screaming for my life
It wasn't my time
I was fine
Hang you on a cross
Martyr with two broken arms
No one hears your final words
Fucked with a witch and you learned
Banshee hang you on the cross
You played games you fucking lost
Liar liar in the trunk
Just a stroke of bad luck
Banshee shove you in the earth
Played with fire you got burnt
Liar liar in the dirt
Now you know your fucking worth
