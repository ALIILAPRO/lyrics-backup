		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby, we can talk all night
But that ain't gettin us nowhere
I told you everything I possibly can
There's nothing left inside of here

And maybe you can cry all night
But that'll never change the way that I feel
The snow is really piling up outside
I wish you wouldn't make me leave here

I poured it on and I poured it out
I tried to show you just how much I care
I'm tired of words and I'm too hoarse to shout
But you've been cold to me so long
I'm crying icicles instead of tears

And all I can do is keep on telling you
I want you (I want you)
I need you (I need you)
There ain't no way I'm ever gonna love you
Now don't be sad (don't be sad 'cause)
'Cause two out of three ain't bad
Now don't be sad ('cause)
'Cause two out of three ain't bad

You'll never find your gold on a sandy beach
You'll never drill for oil on a city street
I know you're looking for a ruby in a mountain of rocks
But there ain't no Coup de Ville 
Hiding at the bottom of a Cracker Jack box

I can't lie (I can't lie)
I can't tell you that I'm something I'm not
No matter how I try
I'll never be able to give you something
Something that I just haven't got

There's only one girl I'll ever love
And that was so many years ago
And though I know I'll never get her out of my heart
She never loved me back
Ooh I know

Well I remember how she left me on a stormy night
Oh she kissed me and got out of our bed
And though I pleaded and I begged her not to walk out that door
She packed her bags and turned right away

And she kept on telling me
She kept on telling me
She kept on telling me

I want you (I want you)
I need you (I need you)
There ain't no way I'm ever gonna love you
Now don't be sad (don't be sad 'cause)
'Cause two out of three ain't bad

I want you (I want you)
I need you (I need you)
There ain't no way I'm ever gonna love you
Now don't be sad (don't be sad 'cause)
'Cause two out of three ain't bad
Now don't be sad
'Cause two out of three ain't bad

Baby, we can talk all night
But that ain't getting us nowhere
