		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm careless 
That's why I'm here with you
You are modest
Unlike the others do
Oh, unless If you don't mind
Can I stay by your side
If it's alright 
Your these days
Do they make you feel hurt
Will you dare believe if I feel the same
So before end of our world
You gotta feel this love
Love that's right
We will be alright
Not afraid of anything we're by
Come on baby
what if I
I hold you, what will you do?
'Cause I know you and I will be alright
When we just get along, It seems so fine
Come on baby
Let us try
I'll hold you, what will you do

Now people
Can't stop their hate and rate
I'm scared of
What if we become like them
So before we lose our light
We gotta start this love
Love what's right
We will be alright
Not afraid of anything we're by
Come on baby
What if I
We will be alright
Not afraid of anything we're by
Come on baby
What if I
I hold you, what will you do?
'Cause I know you and I will be alright
When we just get along, It seems so fine
Come on baby
Let us try
I'll hold you, what will you do
