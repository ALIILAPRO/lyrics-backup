		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Scattered words and empty thoughts
Seem to pour from my heart
I've never felt so torn before
Seems I don't know where to start
But it's now that I feel Your grace fall like rain
From every fingertip, washing away my pain

'Cause I still believe in Your faithfulness
'Cause I still believe in Your truth
'Cause I still believe in Your holy word
Even when I don't see, I still believe

Though the questions still fog up my mind
With promises, I still seem to bear
For even when answers slowly unwind
It's my heart I see You prepare
But it's now that I feel Your grace fall like rain
From every fingertip
Washing away my pain

'Cause I still believe in Your faithfulness
'Cause I still believe in Your truth
'Cause I still believe in Your holy word
Even when I don't see, I still believe

Well, the only place I can go is into Your arms
Where I throw to You my feeble prayers
Well, in brokenness, I can see that this was Your will for me
Help me to know that You are near, yeah

'Cause I still believe in Your faithfulness
'Cause I still believe in Your truth
'Cause I still believe in Your holy word
Even when I don't see, I still believe

'Cause I still believe
'Cause I still believe
'Cause I still believe
'Cause I still believe
'Cause I still believe

I still believe
I still believe
I still believe
Oh
I still believe
I still believe
