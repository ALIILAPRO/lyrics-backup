		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And I never drank alcohol and I never got high
It was the end of a hundred years that took me by surprise
What I thought to be dangerous, on the verge of a smile
Turning out to be nothing more than hiss and overdrive

And there is nothing or noone more powerful
And the light that shines upon you says the same
When I wake up I'm doing a somersault
For the ones who never dared to speak my name

I am shy and mysterious when I say my goodbyes
When I part with the ones I've come to love throughout my life
When the times are miracelous, when I stop to think twice
When I sleep in the bushes next to where the treasure lies

With a devil in the words that you speak to me
When there's nothing left and we are at the end
In the heavens you laugh at me secretly
Where it echoes over and over again

And there is nothing or noone more powerful
And the light that shines upon you says the same
When I wake up I'm doing a somersault
For the ones who never dared to speak my name
