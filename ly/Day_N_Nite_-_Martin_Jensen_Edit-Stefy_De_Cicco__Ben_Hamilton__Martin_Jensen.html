		  (Day and night)
(What, what?)
(What, what?)

Day and night (what, what?)
I toss and turn, I keep stressing my mind, mind (what, what?)
I look for peace but see I don't attain (what, what?)
What I need for keeps this silly game we play, play (play)
Now look at this (what, what?) 
Madness, the magnet keeps attracting me, me (what, what?)
I try to run but see I'm not that fast (what, what?)
I think I'm first but surely finish last, last

'Cause day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone through the day and night
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night
At, at, at night

'Cause day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone through the day and night
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night
At, at, at night

Day and night
Free his mind at night
Things will never change 
Free his mind at night
At, at, at night

Hold the phone (what, what?)
The lonely stoner, Mr Solo Dolo (what, what?)
He's on the move can't seem to shake the shade (what, what?)
Within his dreams he sees the life he made, made
The pain is deep (what, what?)
A silent sleeper you won't hear a peep, peep (what, what?)
The girl he wants don't seem to want him too (what, what?)
It seems the feelings that she had are through, through

'Cause day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone through the day and night
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night
At, at, at night

'Cause day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone through the day and night
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night
At, at, at night

Day and night
Free his mind at night
Things will never change 
Free his mind at night
At, at, at night
