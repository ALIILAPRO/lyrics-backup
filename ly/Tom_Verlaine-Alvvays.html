		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Looking back I should have known
All the nights that I spent in outer space
If in fact I had said no, what becomes of this? It's hard to say 
I'll feel better with the breeze on my back
And I'll sleep better, knowing it's in the past

Looking back I should have known
All the nights that I spent in outer space
Cigarettes and old regrets piled in a stack out in the back of my brain

When you walk away it better be for good
I put my money on a horse who won't be steered on any course or lane
And if I ever see a dime, you'd take that money to divide and separate

When you walk away, it better be for good
I know you'll be there in the rain
Glowing like the first night, telling me you've changed
I know you'll be there in the rain
Glowing like the first night trying to explain that

That when you walk away
It's gonna be for good
You were my Tom Verlaine
Just sitting on the hood
