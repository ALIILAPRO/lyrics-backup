		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't take it back once I've said it
If I let this pass, I know I'll regret it
I'm supposed to wait, but I can't wait

'Cause I'm talking myself out of talking
And I don't wanna lie to you

I wanna tell you, tell you I love you
If you wanna go there
Well, darling, I'd love to
And tell you that "God, I adore you
It's four in the morning
But it's not the drink that's talking"
I wanna tell you, tell you I love you
Tell you I love you

I'm not saying this to make you say it back
'Cause I'd wait for years, I really mean that
And you might laugh, but it's all that I have

And at least if you're laughing, we're talking
So, now I've got nothing to lose

I wanna tell you, tell you I love you
If you wanna go there
Well, darling, I'd love to
And tell you that "God, I adore you
It's four in the morning
But it's not the drink that's talking"
I wanna tell you, tell you I love you

Oh, you say you like the shoes I'm wearing
So, maybe I could walk you home
You tell me you should say what you're thinking
'Cause if you don't say, you'll never know
If you don't say then you'll never know

I wanna tell you, tell you I love you
If you wanna go there
Darling, I'd love to
Oh, tell you that "God, I adore you
It's four in the morning
But it's not the drink that's talking"
I gonna tell you, and tell you I love you
And tell you I love you
