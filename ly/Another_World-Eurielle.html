		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been waiting patiently
For our time to come
Knowing we are meant to be
Side by side as one
Take me to another world
Where I can be the only girl
And there is no-one standing in our way
Stolen hours in each other's arms
Is all we've had till now
It still hurts every time we part
Memories all around
Take me to another world
Where I can be the only girl
And there is no-one standing in our way
Come with me, let's run away
We can leave everything behind
Take me to another world
Where I can be the only girl
And there is no-one standing in our way
Why can't we show everyone
The love we've shared now for so long
Some place there's no-one standing in our way
