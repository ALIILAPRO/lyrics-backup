		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wish that you could build a time machine
So you could see
The things no one can see
Feels like you're standing on the edge
Looking at the stars
And wishing you were them

‪What do you do when a chapter ends?‬
‪Do you close the book and never read it again?‬
‪Where do you go when your story's done?‬
‪You can be who you were or who you'll become 
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh oh, if it all goes wrong 
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh oh, darling just hold on 

‪The sun goes down and it comes back up 
‪The world it turns no matter what 
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh oh, if it all goes wrong
Darling, just hold on

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh oh, darling, just hold on
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh oh

It's not over 'til it's all been said 
‪It's not over 'til your dying breath 
‪So what do you want them to say when you're gone?‬
‪That you gave up or that you kept going on?‬

‪What do you do when a chapter ends?‬
‪Do you close the book and never read it again?‬
‪Where do you go when your story's done?‬
‪You can be who you were or who you'll become 
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh oh, ‪if it all goes wrong 
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh oh, darling just hold on

‪The sun goes down and it comes back up 
‪The world it turns no matter what 
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh oh, if it all goes wrong
Darling, just hold on

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh oh
Darling, just hold on
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh oh
If it all goes wrong
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh oh
Darling just hold on

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh oh
If it all goes wrong, darling just hold on
