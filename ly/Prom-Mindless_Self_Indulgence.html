		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everyone in highschool will worship
The fucking ground I walk on
If it was up to me

I'll never be a target
I'll never be a fucking virgin
But it's not up to me

You make me hard
You make me hard
You make me hard
You make me hard

So now I'm (woooo)
We got the limo (woooo)
I'm running (woooo)

'Cause I'll be fucking at the
Best prom ever

So now I'm (woooo)
We got the limo (woooo)
I'm running (woooo)

'Cause I'll be fucking at the
Best prom ever

Everyone in highschool will worship
The fucking ground I walk on
If it was up to me

I'll never be a target
I'll never be a fucking virgin
But it's not up to me

You make me hard
You make me hard
You make me hard
You make me hard

So now I'm (woooo)
We got the limo (woooo)
I'm running (woooo)

'Cause I'll be fucking at the
Best prom ever
Best prom ever

Guess what, girlfriend
You have got nothing on me, whore
You won't be missed
So get the whole fucking thing over with

Best prom ever
