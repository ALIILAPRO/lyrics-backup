		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh, hey
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh

(Come Dasher, come Dancer, come Prancer, come Vixen)
(On Comet, on Cupid, on Donner, on Blitzen)
(Put on your bells, your Christmas bells)

Come on, we're going for a sleigh ride
Christmas time is here again
Come on, we're going for a sleigh ride
To spread the cheer again
From the top of the chimney to the top of the wall
Dash away, dash away, dash away all

Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh, hey
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh

Old Saint Nicholas, he took a flight
The moon was shining bright
Bring out the bells
Ol' Saint Nick was riding through the sky
You should have seen those reindeer fly
(Bring out the bells)
Bring out the bells, it's a holiday season
(Bring out the bells)
Bring out the bells, it's a happy time
(Bring out the bells)
Bring out the bells, we've got a good reason
To ring the bells and hear the pretty bells chime
(Ring the bells and hear the pretty bells chime)

Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh, hey
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
What fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh

(Christmas jingle bells)
(Jingle bells)
(Christmas jingle bells)
(Jingle bells)
(Christmas jingle bells)
