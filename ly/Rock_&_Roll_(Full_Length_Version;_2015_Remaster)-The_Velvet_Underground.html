		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Jenny said when she was just five years old
There was nothing happening at all
Every time she puts on a radio
There was a nothin' goin' down at all, not at all
Then one fine mornin' she puts on a New York station
You know, she couldn't believe what she heard at all
She started shakin' to that fine fine music
You know her life was saved by rock 'n' roll

Despite all the amputations
You know you could just go out
And dance to a rock 'n' roll station

It was alright (it was alright)
Hey baby, you know it was alright (it was alright)

Jenny said
When she was just about five years old
You know why parents gonna be the death of us all
Two TV sets and two Cadillac cars
Well you know, it ain't gonna help me at all, not just a tiny bit
Then one fine mornin' she turns on a New York station
She doesn't believe what she hears at all
Ooh, she started dancin' to that fine fine music
You know her life is saved by rock 'n' roll, yeah rock 'n' roll 

Despite all the computations
You could just dance
To that rock 'n' roll station

And baby it was alright (it was alright)
Hey it was alright (it was alright)
Hey here she comes now!
Jump! jump!

Jenny said when she was just about five years old
Hey, you know, there was nothing happening at all, not at all
Every time I put on the radio
You know there's nothin' goin' down at all, not at all
Then one fine mornin' she hears a New York station
She just didn't believe what she heard at all, hey, not at all
She started dancin' to that fine fine music
You know her life was saved by rock 'n' roll, yes rock 'n' roll

Despite all the computation
You know you could just dance
To a rock 'n' roll station

All right
All right
And it was alright
Well, listen to me now
And it was alright
Come on, man, listen 
It was alright
It was alright
And it was alright
Alright!
It's alright
Alright!
Yeah, it's alright now
Alright!
Yeah, it's alright now
Alright!
It is all alright
Alright!
Yeah, alright now
Alright!
And it's alright right now
Alright!
And it's alright now
Alright!
Oh baby
Alright!
Oh baby
Alright!
Oh baby
Alright!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Alright!
Now it's alright now
Alright!
Ooh, it's alright now
Alright!
Oh, alright
Alright!
Alright now
Alright!
