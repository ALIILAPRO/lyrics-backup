		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Since you like telling secrets, I'll tell mine
I hope we find each other in all lifetimes
You make me feel just fine
Stay on the phone line
You pause the movie every single time
I laugh so hard I think that I might die
You make me feel just fine
Stay on the phone line

Take me on a joyride
I'll make you some coffee, don't you cry
I like the smell of your car
If you were anything, you'd be stars

You never fail to stare up at the sky
You'll never know if you never try
What would I do without you in my life?
Stay on the phone line

Take me on a joyride
I'll make you some coffee, don't you cry
I like the smell of your car
If you were anything, you'd be stars
Take me to your bedroom
Show me your physical state of mind
I like the smell of your car
If you were anything, you'd be stars

You call no matter the time
When nothing's real and nothing's right
You call no matter the time
You call no matter the time
When nothing's real and nothing's right
You call no matter the time

Take me on a joyride
I'll make you some coffee, don't you cry
I like the smell of your car
If you were anything, you'd be stars
Take me to your bedroom
Show me your physical state of mind
I like the smell of your car
If you were anything, you'd be stars
