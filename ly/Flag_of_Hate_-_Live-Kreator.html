		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dark shadows lie over the city
Tonight someone will die, you can hear
Some painful scream the air is full of files
The mayhemic legions are ready to steal the human souls
Come into my vault and do what you have been told
I'll eat your intestines no matter if you pray or please
I'll bring you down to your knees
Tonight you're gonna meet your fate you'll try to run but it's too
Late I am here to liquidate

[Chorus]
Time to raise your flag of hate, destroy the world is our only aim
To strike them down is the only way to make 'em dead
and make 'em pay

The gallow of the underground shippers on the sea of blood
All what we want is to crucify your "God"
The posers on this earth have no right to live
We gonna split their brains torture is what we give
