		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Blue Spanish eyes teardrops are falling from your Spanish eyes
Please please don't cry, this is just adios and not good-bye
Soon I'll return, bringing you all the love your heart can hold
Please say "Si Si" say you and your Spanish eyes will wait for me

Blue Spanish eyes, prettiest eyes in all of Mexico
Blue Spanish eyes, please smile for me once more before I go
Soon I'll return, bringing you all the love your heart can hold
Please say "Si Si" say you and your Spanish eyes will wait for me

Uh, uh, uh, 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
Soon I'll return, bringing you all the love your heart can hold
Please say "Si Si" say you and your Spanish eyes will wait for me
Say you and your Spanish eyes will wait for me
Say you and your Spanish eyes will wait for me
