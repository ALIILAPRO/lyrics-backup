		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Up on a hill, here's where we begin
This little story, a long time ago
Stop to pretend, stop pretendin'
It seems this game is simply never-endin'

Oh, in the sun, sun, havin' fun, it's in my blood
I just can't help it, don't want you here right now, let me go
Oh, let me a-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-go

Leaving just in time, stay there for a while
Rolling in the ocean, tryna catch her eye
Work hard and say it's easy, do it just to please me
Tomorrow will be different, so I'll pretend I'm leaving

I feel so different now, we trained at A-V-A
I wish you hadn't stayed, my vision's clearer now but I'm unafraid
Flying overseas, no time to feel the breeze
I took too many varieties

Oh, in the sun, sun, havin' fun, it's in my blood
I just can't help it, don't want you here right now, let me go
Woo, darlin' let me a-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-go

Leaving just in time, stay there for a while
Rolling in the ocean, tryna catch her eye
Work hard and say it's easy, do it just to please me
Tomorrow will be different, so this is why I'm leaving
