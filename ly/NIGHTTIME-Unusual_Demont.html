		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm close downtown if you hit me
Ride through parks on my 6-speed
And time spent lone 'til you miss me, love
Yeah, ayy
And moved on still we got history
And homes too far from the city
And far too long since you kissed me, love
Yeah, said

In the night time, I'm right where you need me, baby
In the night time, I'm right where you need me, baby
In the night time, I'm right where you need me, baby
In the night time, I'm right where you need me, baby

Come alive, ooh ooh
We spend too much time
Sittin' nice, ooh ooh
Could you say you want me
By your side?
Me too
I see you look her
I'm just fine boo-hoo
(If you leave me I'll be)
Dead
But by you still
Color changin'
Red
I'm all you feel
Could you stay right here?
(Might not)
Just be real
I got time to kill
(Right)
Over here

Before you, darling, I could barely breathe
You been with me but I know its not unique
Used to feel like when together had to creep
And now it's different when you here we go to sleep

In the night time I'm right where you need me, baby
In the night time I'm right where you need me, baby
