		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know you're smart
You spin me 'round like a knot
You know the pieces, pieces of my heart
Sometimes it's fun, you pull my strings one by one
Until you get me, get me onto one

Lately I've been thinking if you wanna get tough
Then let's play rough
Lately I've been thinking if you wanna get tough
Then let's play rough
I don't need you 
Givin' it straight to me, givin' it straight to me
You're just gonna get knocked back
I don't need you
Telling me how to be, telling me how to be

You're just gonna get knocked back
Just gonna get knocked back
Just gonna get knocked back
Just gonna get knocked back
Just gonna get knocked back
Back, back, back, back
Back, back, back, back

Just noise, white noise
Just noise, white noise
I'm hearing static, you're like an automatic
You just wanna keep me on repeat and hear me crying
Just noise, white noise
Just noise, white noise
I'm hearing static, you're like an automatic
You just wanna keep me on repeat and hear me crying

Only you can look at me the way you do
You always tint me, tint me black and blue
Such a shame, you frame me with such disdain
You got me washed out, washed out, color drained

Lately I've been thinking if you wanna get tough
Then let's play rough
Lately I've been thinking if you wanna get tough
Then let's play rough
I don't need you
Givin' it straight to me, givin' it straight to me
You're just gonna get knocked back
I don't need you
Telling me how to be, telling me how to be

You're just gonna get knocked back
Just gonna get knocked back
Just gonna get knocked back
Just gonna get knocked back
Just gonna get knocked back
Back, back, back, back
Back, back, back, back

Just noise, white noise
Just noise, white noise
I'm hearing static, you're like an automatic
You just wanna keep me on repeat and hear me crying

(Hear me crying)
(Hear me crying)
