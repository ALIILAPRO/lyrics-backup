		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can not hear the music through all the moodswings

(Flatline)

Jump!
Like we're jumping on a landmine
My life is a joke without a punchline
You don't need a parachute to skydive
You need a parachute to skydive, twice

(I can not hear the music through all the mood swings)

Can you hear the silence getting loud?
Tickets to my nightmares selling out
I'm so sick and tired of ups and downs
I think I wanna flatline, flatline, flatline

Bounce!
Like you're bouncing for the last time
Exit emotions, see you on the other side
You don't need a parachute to skydive
Just make sure you land inside the chalk outlines

I can not hear the music through all the mood swings
I can not hear the music through all the mood swings

Can you hear the silence getting loud?
Tickets to my nightmares selling out
I'm so sick and tired of ups and downs
I think I wanna flatline, flatline, flatline

(Flatline)

Flatline, flatline, flatline

I can not hear the music through all the mood swings
I can not hear the music through all the mood swings, mood swings
Mood swings, mood swings, mood swings
Mood swings, mood swings, mood swings
Mood swings, mood swings, mood swings

(Flatline)

Flatline

Can you hear the silence getting loud?
Tickets to my nightmares selling out
I'm so sick and tired of ups and downs
I think I wanna flatline, flatline, flatline

I, I think I wanna
(Flatline)
We think I wanna flatline, flatline
