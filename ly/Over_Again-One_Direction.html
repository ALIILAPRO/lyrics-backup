		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Said I'd never leave her 'cause her hands fit like my T-shirt
Tongue tied over three words, cursed
Running over thoughts that make my feet hurt
Bodies intertwined with her lips

Now she's feeling so low since she went solo
Hole in the middle of my heart like a polo
And it's no joke to me
So can we do it all over again?

If you're pretending from the start like this
With a tight grip, then my kiss can mend your broken heart
I might miss everything you said to me

And I can lend your broken parts
That might fit like this
And I will give you all my heart
So we can start it all over again

Again can we take the same road two days in the same clothes?
And I know just what she'll say if I can make all this pain go
Can we stop this for a minute?
You know, I can tell that your heart isn't in it or with it

Tell me with your mind, body and spirit
I can make your tears fall down like the showers that are British
Whether we're together or apart
We can both remove the masks and admit we regret it from the start

If you're pretending from the start like this
With a tight grip, then my kiss can mend your broken heart
I might miss everything you said to me

And I can lend your broken parts
That might fit like this
And I will give you all my heart
So we can start it all over again

You'll never know how to make it on your own
And you'll never show weakness for letting go
I guess you're still hurt if they say so
But do you really want to be alone?

If you're pretending from the start like this
With a tight grip, then my kiss can mend your broken heart
I might miss everything you said to me

And I can lend your broken parts
That might fit like this
And I will give you all my heart
So we can start it all over again

If you're pretending from the start like this
With a tight grip, then my kiss can mend your broken heart
I might miss everything you said to me

And I can lend your broken parts
That might fit like this
And I will give you all my heart
So we can start it all over again
