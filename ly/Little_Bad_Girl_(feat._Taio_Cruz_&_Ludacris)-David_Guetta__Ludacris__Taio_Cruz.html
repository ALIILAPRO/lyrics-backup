		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh yeah, they tell me I'm a bad boy
All the ladies look at me and act coy
I just like to put my hands up in the air
I want that girl dancing over there

Look at her go on the dance floor
She's amazing on the dance floor
When she moves, girl, I want more
Keep it going, girl, like I got an encore
You got me saying

Go little bad girl, little bad girl
Go little bad girl, little bad girl
Go little bad girl, little bad girl
Go little bad girl, go little bad girl

Oh, yeah, they tell me I'm a bad boy
All the ladies look at me and act coy
I just like to put my hands up in the air
I want that girl dancing over there

Shaking her ass from the left to the right
Moving it round just the way that I like
I wanna see you move like a movie on flight
You got it how I want and I want it all night

Look at her go on the dance floor
She's amazing on the dance floor
When she moves, girl, I want more
Keep it going, girl, like I got an encore
You got me saying

Go little bad girl, little bad girl
Go little bad girl, little bad girl
Go little bad girl, little bad girl
Go little bad girl, go little bad girl (let's go)

She done got my heart jumping
And my adrenaline pumpin' and gunnin'
Like ain't nobody ever seen (Seen, seen, seen, seen, seen, seen)
As a matter of fact I've seen this woman all up in my dreams
Whippin' and flippin' and stackin' and slappin'
I'm attacking after she back it up and make it drop
After I meet her I tell her David Guetta's on the track, baby girl, don't stop
Keep it goin' you never know when somebody's gonna throw a couple dollars
Got a pocket full of hundred dollar bill's
Ludacris, Mr. Make-a-Woman-Holla (Sing, sing, sing, sing, sing)
And every night on the floor putting on a show (show, show, show, show, show)
Everybody in the club there's a little something you should know

Look at her go on the dance floor
She's amazing on the dance floor
When she moves, girl, I want more
Keep it going, girl, like I got an encore
You got me saying

Go little bad girl, little bad girl
Go little bad girl, little bad girl
Go little bad girl, little bad girl
Go little bad girl, go little bad girl
Go little bad girl, little bad girl
Go little bad girl, little bad girl
Go little bad girl, little bad girl
Go little bad girl, go little bad girl
