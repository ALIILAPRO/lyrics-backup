		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hi, I think that I might
Might L-O-V-E-Y-O-U
I L-O, L-O, L-O, L-O-V-E

Why are my fingers dialing all the numbers they shouldn't?
Why are my lips saying all the words they said they wouldn't?
It's taking all of me not to give into my emotions
Calling your phone at 4 AM, like what am I doing?

Right now I need you more than a friend
I don't understand, it happened so fast
I put it on replay in my head
Don't know what we said
I think that it went like

Hi
Hey, what you doing with my heart?
I never said that you could take it
Give it back before you break it
Bébé, I
Don't wanna make this difficult
Don't wanna make it complicated
Let's hang up before I say it
Bébé, I
I think that I might
Might L-O-V-E-Y-O-U
I L-O, L-O, L-O, L-O
Bébé, I
I think that I might
Might L-O-V-E-Y-O-U
I L-O, L-O, L-O, L-O
Bébé

Why am I staying up every night, tossing and turning?
Staring at your photo like I never learn and
Drawing you up in my mind right next to Cupid
Don't know why L-O-V-E makes me foolish

Right now I need you more than a friend
I don't understand, it happened so fast
I put it on replay in my head
Don't know what we said
I think that it went like

Hi
Hey, what you doing with my heart?
I never said that you could take it
Give it back before you break it
Bébé, I
Don't wanna make this difficult
Don't wanna make it complicated
Let's hang up before I say it
Bébé, I
I think that I might
Might L-O-V-E-Y-O-U
I L-O, L-O, L-O, L-O
Bébé, I
I think that I might
Might L-O-V-E-Y-O-U
I L-O, L-O, L-O, L-O
Bébé, I
I think that I might
Might L-O-V-E-Y-O-U
I L-O, L-O, L-O, L-O
Bébé, I
I think that I might
Might L-O-V-E-Y-O-U
I L-O, L-O, L-O, L-O
Bébé, I
I think that I might
Might L-O-V-E-Y-O-U
I L-O, L-O, L-O, L-O
Bébé, I
I think that I might
Might L-O-V-E-Y-O-U

I L-O, L-O, L-O, L-O-V-E
