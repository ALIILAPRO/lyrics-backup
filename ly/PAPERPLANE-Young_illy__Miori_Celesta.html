		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  hey,
look at the shining stars, where we belong (we belong)
days,
passing by and i don't feel so strong (feel so strong)
came
to my senses that i'll be alone (all alone)
wait,
i'm the only one not getting old (everything is fading)

(Let me) fly,
what should i reach for
believing in hope, touch the
sky
start a path anew 
dreaming in bright blue

don't need more time, just lead the way
tell me that i'm ready for takeoff
take the long way 'round, it's okay 
tell me that i can, and start a new beginning

(soaring high)

reaching after paperplanes I sent with childlike eyes
soaring in the wind, through the darkness and shining lights
stepping out, explore a world that's full of Diamond Heights
when i look back, i can tell you, it's all going fine

i, haven't found my way so far
was this just fate?
i've been thinking to myself
i still need more days
precious things are all around
no need to wait
right, we can only just move on
and open these gates

fly,
what should i reach for
believing in hope, touch the
sky
start a path anew 
dreaming in bright blue

it's all going fine

(forever)

reaching after paperplanes i sent with childlike eyes
soaring in the wind, through the darkness and shining lights
stepping out, explore a world that's full of Diamond Heights
when i look back, i can tell you, it's all going fine

tell me, everything will be fine
