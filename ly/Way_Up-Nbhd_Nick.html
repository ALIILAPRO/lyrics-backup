		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  On-on-on-on a track now we going way up
W's as easy as a lay up
Working late stay up counting all the way up
Counting blessings yeah you know we pray up
On a track now we going way up
Now we going way up, now we going
On a track now we going way up
Now we going way up, now we going

Keep that same energy
Work on being better when I'm seventy
Your drip is just a water spring
You know I drip different this the seven seas
I deal with life different
Make that lemon squeeze
Ran off with my style and identity
Bet I bounce back and get the cheddar cheese
I guess that's why they envy me

On a track now we going way up
W's as easy as a lay up
Working late stay up counting all the way up
Counting blessings yeah you know we pray up
On a track now we going way up
Now we going way up, now we going
On a track now we going way up
Now we going way up, now we going

I got hit's hit's
Batting like I'm Barry Bonds
Running through the money but
The money's long
I don't love it but I need
It keep it coming on
Only family me and friends
We don't get along
I put that on my name that I put them on
I put myself on stages they sing along
I might book a session do a hundred songs
I might let you hear em'
Just to prove you wrong

On a track now we going way up
W's as easy as a lay up
Working late stay up counting all the way up
Counting blessings yeah you know we pray up
On a track now we going way up
Now we going way up, now we going
On a track now we going way up
Now we going way up, now we going
