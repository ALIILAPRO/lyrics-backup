		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So this is Christmas
And what have you done
Another year over
And a new one just begun
And so this is Christmas
I hope you have fun
The near and the dear one
The old and the young

A very Merry Christmas
And a happy New Year
Let's hope it's a good one
Without any fear

So this is Christmas
For weak and for strong 
For rich and the poor ones 
The road is so long 
And so happy Christmas
For black and for white 
For yellow and red ones
Let's stop all the fight 

A very Merry Christmas
And a happy New Year
Let's hope it's a good one
Without any fear

And so this is Christmas 
And what have we done 
Another year over
And a new one just begun 
And so happy Christmas
We hope you have fun 
The near and the dear one 
The old and the young 
A very Merry Christmas
And a happy New Year
Let's hope it's a good one
Without any fear

War is over, if you want it
War is over now
War is over, if you want it
War is over now
