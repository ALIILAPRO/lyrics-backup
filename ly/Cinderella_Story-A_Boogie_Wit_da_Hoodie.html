		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's a hood nigga story (It's a hood nigga story)
But you like Cinderella stories, too (but you like Cinderella stories too)
And, girl, you know I fuck with you (girl, you know I fuck with you)
Text you in the morning like, "What's up, ugly?"
But to us that means you're beautiful (to us that means you're beautiful)
Probably should've kept that shit between us two (keep that shit between us two)
Girl, I want you, mm (girl, I want you)

I'm on your body (your body, ah)
My vibe is your body (my vibe is your body)
There's something we should talk about, mm (let's talk about it), yeah
'Cause I might need you around me ('cause I might need you around me)
They hate on me like I was born rich (I wasn't born rich), yeah
But I'm just now gettin' used to ballin' (I'm just now gettin' used to ballin'), yeah
She just want Cinderella stories (stories), yeah
Glass slippers by Balmain (glass slippers by Balmain), yeah

She's nasty (oh)
And she's nasty just like me, yeah (like me, yeah)
And she's icy (she's icy, oh)
Spanish mami, call me papi, yeah
But she know my lingo, what's up? (She hit me up like, "Okay")
She said, "¿Qué e' lo que?" like, what's up? Yeah
I said, "¿Qué tú hace', girl?" what you doing? Yeah
No juegas conmigo, yeah
Girl, don't you play with me like I'm stupid
I been missing your deep throat, yeah
Couldn't find a bitch that can do it how you do it, yeah
Could you set up the threesome? Yeah
My lil' caramel light skin

I'm on your body (your body, ah)
My vibe is your body (my vibe is your body)
There's something we should talk about, mm (let's talk about it), yeah
'Cause I might need you around me ('cause I might need you around me)
They hate on me like I was born rich (I wasn't born rich), yeah
But I'm just now gettin' used to ballin' (I'm just now gettin' used to ballin'), yeah
She just want Cinderella stories (stories), yeah
Glass slippers by Balmain (glass slippers by Balmain), yeah

Your body is my vibe (is my vibe)
When you come around, I get shy when I see you (see you, yeah)
When I see you (see you)
Got all my pictures in her mirrors
Start to blush when somebody says my name
Won't let nobody even try to spit no game
Nah, they look in her direction, she look the other way
And she like sex on the beach
She gave me head and my knees so weak, yeah
And I'm still in the streets, yeah
Still in it and I'm still not with it
If I do it, don't you say I did it
'Round here, you get a headshot for telling, yeah
Baby, is you gon' be down forever, yeah, uh

I'm on your body (your body, ah)
My vibe is your body (my vibe is your body)
There's something we should talk about, mm (let's talk about it), yeah
'Cause I might need you around me ('cause I might need you around me)
They hate on my like I was born rich (I wasn't born rich), yeah
But I'm just now gettin' used to ballin' (I'm just now gettin' used to ballin'), yeah
She just want Cinderella stories (stories), yeah
Glass slippers by Balmain (glass slippers by Balmain), yeah

She said, "¿Qué e' lo que?" like, what's up? Yeah
I said, "¿Qué tú hace, girl?" what you doing? Yeah
No juegas conmigo, yeah
Girl, don't you play with me like I'm stupid
