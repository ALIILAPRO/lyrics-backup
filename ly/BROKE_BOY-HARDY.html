		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I filled up, maxed that Discover
Bought a can of snuff, dropped ten for the cover
Had fifteen bucks to drink down my supper
I was broke, boy
Then she walked in the door, lookin' like a million
Never seen her before, but man, I had a feelin'
She's the kind if you swing and miss
It'll leave your heart broke, boy
Funny what you do when you got nothin' to lose
So I counted to three, eased on up and said

"My truck is parked in the parking lot
In the back seat's a half-full rack of beer
I got a spot to stop and watch a star drop
Whatcha say we get there and the hell outta here?"
Then a "Yes" turned into an all-night kiss
On the top of a dropped tailgate
And man, I couldn't help but think to myself (damn)
Damn, son, you got some pretty good game for a broke boy
(Broke boy, broke boy, whiskey in your Coke, boy)
(Broke boy, broke boy)
You got some pretty good game for a broke boy
(Broke boy, broke boy, funny like a joke, boy)
(Broke boy, broke boy)

We woke up to the heat of that summer
And that one night turned into two hundred
Now she tells me that she loves me right before she goes to bed
And she wouldn't be saying that if I never said

"My truck is parked in the parking lot
In the back seat's a half-full rack of beer
I got a spot to stop and watch a star drop
Whatcha say we get there and the hell outta here?"
Then a "Yes" turned into an all-night kiss
On the top of a dropped tailgate
And man, I couldn't help but think to myself (damn)
Damn, son, you got some pretty good game for a broke boy
Broke boy, whiskey in your Coke, boy
Shootin' your shot like a .45 Colt
For a Mississippi queen that deserves it all
Who'd've thought a right-on-the-money honey'd ever fall for a broke boy

My truck was parked in that parking lot
Every one of them back seat beers got drank
I didn't have a dime to my last name
Aw, but she took mine and I got the Lord to thank
That "Yes" turned into an all-night kiss
On the top of a dropped tailgate
And man, I couldn't help but think to myself (damn)
Damn, son, you got some pretty good game for a broke boy
Broke boy, whiskey in your Coke, boy
Lookin' back now, kinda funny like a joke, boy
Mississippi queen that deserves it all
Who'd've thought a right-on-the-money honey'd ever fall for a broke boy
A right-on-the-money honey'd ever fall for a broke boy
