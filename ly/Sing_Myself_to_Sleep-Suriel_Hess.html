		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't wanna walk away
But I don't wanna see your face
It's all too much for me
Sometimes I wanna be alone
The comfort I feel on my own is all I ever need
I know it's hard for you to take
I'll make you leave before you stay
Cause one's enough for me
You treat me like I'm all there is
Tender touch and gentle kiss
And still I want to leave
Wish I could sing myself to sleep
Sing myself to sleep
Maybe I'm the one to blame
Maybe I think love's a game and you're my favorite piece
Lately it all moves so fast
I hardly have a chance to act on what I really need
I know it's hard for you to take
I'll make you leave before you stay
Cause one's enough for me
You treat me like I'm all there is
Tender touch and gentle kiss
And still I want to leave
Wish I could sing myself to sleep
Sing myself to sleep
Wish I could sing myself to sleep
So I could love you blissfully
Sing myself to sleep
I know it's hard for you to take
I'll make you leave before you stay
Cause one's enough for me
