		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  People come and go
But I will always stay
All the pain that was
Belongs in yesterday

Do you live and die for love 
I will risk it all for love 
I could wait it out for love
Bottle it up and get you drunk 
Get you drunk, (drunk in love)
Bottle it up, get you drunk 
Don't let it slip away

I'm gonna get you off the dolo
Can you tell me why you ride so low?
I'll tell you what you don't know

People come and go
But I will always stay
All the pain that was
Belongs in yesterday
People come and go
But I will always stay
All the pain that was
Belongs in yesterday

Bad link-ups has you haunted 
But nothing was for granted
Lost someone but found yourself it 
May feel overcrowded 
Bottle it up and get you drunk 
Get you drunk, drunk in love 
Bottle it up and get you drunk 
Don't let it slip away

I wanna get you off the dolo
Can you tell me why you're riding so low?
I'll tell you what you don't know

People come and go
But I will always stay
All the pain that was
Belongs in yesterday
People come and go
But I will always stay
All the pain that was
Belongs in yesterday
