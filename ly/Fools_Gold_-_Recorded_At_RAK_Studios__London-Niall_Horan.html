		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm like a crow on a wire
You're the shining distraction that
Makes me fly home
I'm like a boat on the water
You're the rays on the waves
That calm my mind, oh, every time

But I know in my heart
You're not a constant star

And yeah, i let you use me from the
Day that we first met but I'm not done yet
Falling for your fool's gold
And I knew that
You turned it on for everyone you met
But I don't regret falling
For your fool's gold

I'm the first to admit that I'm reckless
I get lost in your beauty and I can't see
Two feet in front of me

And I know in my heart
You're just a moving part

And yeah, i let you use me from the
Day that we first met but I'm not done yet
Falling for your fool's gold
And I knew that
You turned it on for everyone you met
But I don't regret falling
For your fool's gold

But I know your love's not real
That's not the way it feels
That's not the way you feel

And yeah, i let you use me from the
Day that we first met but I'm not done yet
Falling for your fool's gold
And I knew that
You turned it on for everyone you met
But I don't regret falling
For your fool's gold
