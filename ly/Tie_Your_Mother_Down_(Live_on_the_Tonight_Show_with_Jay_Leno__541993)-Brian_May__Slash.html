		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Get your party gown get your pigtail down
Get your heart beating baby
Got my timing right got my act all tight
It's got to be tonight my little school babe

Your momma says you don't
And your Daddy says you won't
And I'm boiling up inside
There is no way I'm going
To lose out this time

Tie your Mother down tie your Mother down
Lock your Daddy out of doors
I don't need him nosing around
Tie your Mother down tie your Mother down
Give me all your love tonight

You're such a dirty louse
Go get out of my house
That's all I ever get from your family ties
In fact I don't think I ever heard
A single little civil word from those guys
But you know I don't give a light
I'm going to make out all right
I've got a sweetheart hand
To put a stop to all that
Grousing and sniping

Tie your Mother down tie your Mother down
Send your brother swimming with a brick
That's alright tie your Mother down
Tie your Mother down
Or you ain't no friend of mine!

Your momma and your Daddy going to
Plague me until I die
Why can't they understand I'm just a
Peace loving guy

Tie your Mother down tie your Mother down
Get that big big big big big big
Daddy out the door tie your mother down yeah
Tie your mother down
Give me all your love tonight
All your love tonight
