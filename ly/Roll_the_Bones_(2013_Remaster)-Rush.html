		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, you can stake that claim
Good work is the key to good fortune
Winners take that praise
Losers seldom take that blame

If they don't take that game
And sometimes the winner takes nothing
We draw our own designs
But fortune has to make that frame 

We go out in the world and take our chances
Fate is just the weight of circumstances
That's the way that Lady Luck dances
Roll the bones 
Roll the bones 

Why are we here?
Because we're here
Roll the bones
Roll the bones

Why does it happen?
Because it happens
Roll the bones 
Roll the bones

Faith is cold as ice
Why are little ones born only to suffer
For the want of immunity 
Or a bowl of rice?

Well, who would hold a price
On the heads of the innocent children
If there's some immortal power
To control the dice? 

We come into the world and take our chances
Fate is just the weight of circumstances
That's the way that lady luck dances
Roll the bones 
Roll the bones 

Why are we here?
Because we're here
Roll the bones
Roll the bones

Why does it happen?
Because it happens
Roll the bones 
Roll the bones

Why are we here?
Because we're here
Roll the bones
Roll the bones
Why does it happen?

Jack, relax
Get busy with the facts
No zodiacs or almanacs
No maniacs in polyester slacks
Just the facts
Gonna kick some gluteus max
It's a parallax, you dig?
You move around
The small gets big, it's a rig
It's action, reaction
Random interaction
So who's afraid 
Of a little abstraction?
Can't get no satisfaction
From the facts?
You better run, homeboy
A fact's a fact
From Nome to Rome, boy

What's the deal? Spin the wheel
If the dice are hot, take a shot
Play your cards, show us what you got
What you're holding
If the cards are cold
Don't go folding
Lady Luck is golden
She favors the bold, that's cold
Stop throwing stones
The night has a thousand saxophones
So get out there and rock
And roll the bones
Get busy

Roll the bones

Why are we here?
Because we're here
Roll the bones
Roll the bones

Why does it happen?
Because it happens
Roll the bones 
Roll the bones

Why are we here?
Because we're here
Roll the bones
Roll the bones

Why does it happen?
Because it happens
Roll the bones 
Roll the bones

Why does it happen?
Because it happens
Roll the bones 
Roll the bones

Why are we here?
Because we're here
Roll the bones
Roll the bones

Why does it happen?
Because it happens
Roll the bones 
Roll the bones

Why are we here?
Because we're here
Roll the bones
Roll the bones
