		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been so afraid of love baby doll but you make it easy
Like I was living in the dark for so long then you shined your light
I never thought I'd find the one so alone but you finally see me
Oh I couldn't do you wrong no even if I tried
And every day I fall in love with you just a little bit harder
Ain't it obvious to you
That I don't care where we're going
Cause it don't matter what's down the road
Cause you're right here and I won't let go
I don't care where we're going
When I'm with you the world is so far away
As long as I've got you next to me
I've been tryna find the words but I always seems to write the wrong ones
Like it all adds up but it doesn't show the way I feel
Like I never really lived 'til I loved you now I could die young
Got my heart in overdrive and baby you're behind the wheel
And every day I fall in love with you just a little bit harder
Ain't it obvious to you
That I don't care where we're going
Cause it don't matter what's down the road
Cause you're right here and I won't let go
I don't care where we're going
When I'm with you the world is so far away
As long as I've got you next to me
Call it fate you came my way
I love you more than a little bit babe
Love you more than my heart can take
Call it fate you came my way
I love you more than a little bit babe
Love you more than my heart can take
Cause I don't care where we're going
