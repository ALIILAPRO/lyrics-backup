		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Am I wrong?
For thinking that we are moving backwards
We used to be close
Now I'm done
With trying to fix all your tiny fractures
Maybe this is not what we want

Oh
Used to be close with you
Doesn't matter what i do
Now I just can't get through
To you

Ive been chasing a dream
It was something bout you and the sky turning blue but
It was hard to believe
Waking up all alone in the dust

Now I'm wondering what happened
Did we lose all of the passion
Thought we had it but we left it
Guess its something i imagined

Am I wrong?
For thinking that we are moving backwards
We used to be close
Now I'm done
With trying to fix all your tiny fractures
Maybe this is not what we want

Oh
Used to be close with you
Doesn't matter what i do
Now I just can't get through
To you

Guess we waited too long
Yeah we finished the song too soon
Think your chords sound wrong
How did we get so off key

Now I'm wondering what happened
Did we lose all of the passion
Thought we had it but we left it
Guess its something i imagined

Am I wrong?
For thinking that we are moving backwards
We used to be close
Now I'm done
With trying to fix all your tiny fractures
Maybe this is not what we want

Oh
Used to be close with you
Doesn't matter what i do
Now I just can't get through
To you
