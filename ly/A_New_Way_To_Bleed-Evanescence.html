		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Save your twisted enemy
So you might earn forgiveness
You know your whole world is waiting
So why can't you speak?

I feel it coming over me
I'm still a slave to these dreams
Is this the end of everything?
Or just a new way to bleed?

So go and tell all your friends
That I'm a failure underneath
If it makes you feel like a bigger man
But it's my, my heart, my life
That you're calling a lie
I've played this game before
And I can't take anymore

I feel it coming over me
I'm still a slave to these dreams
Is this the end of everything?
Or just a new way to bleed?

By drifting far beyond the edge
Freedom, freedom,
Can't you feel the ground caving in?
Freedom,
Give us a reason to believe again

I feel it coming over me
I'm still a slave to these dreams
Is this the end of everything?
Or just a new way to bleed?
