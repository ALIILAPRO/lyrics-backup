		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh oh my why am I surprised
I've been counting days go by
Thoughts feel loud without you
I Know I should be sleeping soon

Oh oh my what a guy I like
The man I found was just my type
Hope that I'm not falling
Think I've started Overthinking things
Gone

I'm so lucky
Someone like me
Couldn't ever ask for more
Showed I'm enough
'Cause I know that I'm loved
Sometimes I want to live a quiet life with you
'Cause you're my favorite person
That I could never lose

You're more than a friend
I can tell you whatever
Change myself around you
'Cause I know that I'm home

You're more than a trend
Feels like I've known you forever
Never feel alone
'Cause you know me the most

I'm so lucky
Someone like me
Couldn't ever ask for more
Showed I'm enough
'Cause I know that I'm loved
Sometimes I want to live a quiet life with you
'Cause you're my favorite person
That I could never lose

Never imagined me this way
Never imagined me this way

Oh oh my why am I surprised
I've been counting days go by
Thoughts feel loud without you
I Know I should be sleeping soon

Oh oh my what a guy I like
The man I found was just my type
Hope that I'm not falling
Think I've started Overthinking things
Gone

I'm so lucky
Someone like me
Couldn't ever ask for more
Showed I'm enough
'Cause I know that I'm loved
Sometimes I want to live a quiet life with you
'Cause you're my favorite person
That I could never lose
