		  Hail (hail), what the matter with your head, yeah
Hail (hail), what the matter with your mind and your sign and a oh-oh-oh
Hail (hail), nothin' the matter with your head, baby find it, come on and find it
Hail, with it baby, 'cause you're fine and you're mine and you look so divine

Come and get your love
Come and get your love
Come and get your love
Come and get your love

Hail (hail) what's the matter with your feel right, don't you feel right, baby?
Hail (hail) alright, get it from the main vine, alright
I said, find it, find it, go on and love it if you like it, yeah
Hail (hail) it's your business
If you want some, take some
Get it together, baby

Come and get your love
Come and get your love
Come and get your love
Come and get your love

Come and get your love
Come and get your love
Come and get your love now
Come and get your love
Come and get your love
Come and get your love now

Come and get your love
Come and get your love
Come and get your love now
Come and get your love
Come and get your love
Come and get your love now

Come and get your love
Come and get your love
Come and get your love
Come and get your love

Hail (hail) what the matter with your feel right don't you feel right baby
Hail (hail) alright, get it from the main vine, alright
