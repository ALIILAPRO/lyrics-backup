		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And I will hold you tight
Like the moon in the arms of the sky
And I will keep you warm
I will build a fire in this house

And I'll build a fire, you fetch the water and I'll lay the table
And in our hearts, we still pray for sons and daughters
And all those evenings out in the garden, the red, red wine
These quiet hours turning to years

And I, I'll wrap myself around your heart
I'll be the walls of his heart
And I, I'll keep a light on
To call you back home

And I'll build a fire, you fetch the water and I'll lay the table
And in our hearts, we still pray for sons and daughters
And all those evenings out in the garden, the red, red wine
These quiet hours turning to years

And it's all to come, for now we're still young
We're just building our kingdom, but it's all to come

And I'll build a fire, you fetch the water and I'll lay the table
And in our hearts, we still pray for sons and daughters
And all those evenings out in the garden, the red, red wine
These quiet hours turning to years

And it's all to come, for now we're still young
