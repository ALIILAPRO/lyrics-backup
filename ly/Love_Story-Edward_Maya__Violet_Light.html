		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm ready for love
I'm ready for you
I'm standing right here
I'm waiting for you
I'm waiting for you

You're running away, far from my life
I need you to save me n be by my side
I'm ready to love
I tried to let go,
I feel this straight from my heart
I'm ready to be, the woman for you
You standing right near me, made this moment so true
I'm still chasing my dreams, releasing my tears
Forever to hold you, forever to love you
You'll be crying for me
You'll be crying for me
You'll be crying for me
You'll be crying for me
You'll be crying for me
You'll be crying for me
You'll be crying for me
You'll be crying for me
You'll be crying for me

In the end you'll find your own way home
Break my heart, take your love with you
Just let me quit and end this
Esti iubirea mea
Esti iubirea mea
Esti iubirea mea
Esti iubirea mea

I'm ready for love
I'm ready for you
I'm standing right here
I'm waiting for you
I'm waiting for you

You're running away, far from my life
I need you to save me and be by my side
I'm ready to love
I tried to let go
I feel this straight from my heart
I'm ready to be the woman for you
You standing right near me, made this moment so true
I'm still chasing dreams, releasing my tears
Forever to hold you, forever to love you
You'll be crying for me

In the end you'll find your own way home
Break my heart, take your love with you
Just let me hold
Esti iubirea mea
Esti iubirea mea
Esti iubirea mea
Esti iubirea mea
Esti iubirea mea
Esti iubirea mea
