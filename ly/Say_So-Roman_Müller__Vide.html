		  Say So
Say So
Say So

Let me take the pressure off of you 
You don't have to act the same way as they do

I can see the stress is sipping through
I will show you that you got nothing to loose
 Let's just
Get away ﻿Get away ﻿Get away
From here

Go as
Far away ﻿Far away ﻿Far away
As we need

Let's just
Get away ﻿Get away ﻿Get away
From here

Go as
Far away ﻿Far away ﻿Far away
As we need

Just say so
And I will show you different places
Where the stress is laying low
 And you'll discover different phases
Where you take it nice and slow 
Just say so

And I will show you different places
Where the stress is laying low
 And you'll discover different phases
Where you take it nice and slow 
Just say so
