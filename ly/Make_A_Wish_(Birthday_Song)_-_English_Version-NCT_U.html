		<p>
		  Oh, eh, oh, ah

See you looking right here
Don't hesitate
Fully booked up for you
I squeeze in a date
Girl you got me excited
I wanna play
It's like I been at sea the way
I been on a wave

I want you to come join me
Swimming in the money like royalty
She said baby, you don't have to spoil me
She just want me to spoil her with loyalty

Sweet tooth I eat all of the skittles
I like my donuts with jam in the middle
You're a great example of what I'm into
I was thinking we could jam for a little
You're all that I want
Let me show what I'm on

I can do this all night
Back it up, back it up
Girl, you just my type
We should match it up match it up (you should)
Girl, you're lit, there ain't no one finer
One in a milly, yeah, you light the fire
Ah before I change my mind
It's your birthday make a wish

Hoo you should make a wish
I, I'll give you anything
Make a wish
(Let me do it for you)

Never take a break
You always working overtime

Let's just run away memories to make
You a diamond, see you glowing in the (dark)
That's why it's funny
When you're calling me a (star)
You're my sugar rush
You really got me (charged)
(Really got me charged star)

Sweet tooth I know how to nibble
Ice cream, no flake, lemon drizzle
Chocolate milkshake just a little
Oreo marshmallow with the sprinkles
You're all that I want
Let me show what I'm on

I can do this all night
Back it up, back it up
Girl, you just my type
We should match it up, match it up (you should)
Girl you're lit, there ain't no one finer
One in a milly, yeah, you light the fire
Ah before I change my mind
It's your birthday make a wish

Girl your energy
It lifts me high (lifts me high)
Put my heart and pride
On the line (I'll do it for you)
I don't know why it took so long to realize
(I should've seen it from before)
Been tryna tell you you're

It's your birthday
It's your birthday
It's your birthday
It's your birthday, now make a wish

I can do this all night
(I can do it got the cash)
(You know I like to splash so throw in a bag)
Oh oh oh that I want
It's your birthday
It's your birthday
It's your birthday
It's your birthday now make a wish

Girl, you're lit, there ain't no one finer
One in a milly yeah, you light the fire
Ah before I change my mind
It's your birthday, make a wish

I can do this all night
Back it up, back it up, yeah
Girl, you just my type
We should match it up, match it up (you should)
Girl, you're lit, there ain't no one finer
One in a milly, yeah, you light the fire
Ah before I change my mind
