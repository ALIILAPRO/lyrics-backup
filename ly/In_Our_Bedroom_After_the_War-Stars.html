		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wake up, say good morning to
That sleepy person lying next to you
If there's no one there then there's no one there
But at least the war is over

It's us, yes, we're back again
Here to see you through 'til the day's end
And if the night comes and the night will come
Well at least the war is over

Lift your head and look out the window
Stay that way for the rest of the day and watch the time go
Listen, the birds sing, listen, the bells ring
All the living are dead and the dead are all living
The war is over and we are beginning

Gridlock on the parkway now
The television man is here to show you how
The channel fades to snow, it's off to work you go
But at least the war is over

She's gone, she left before you woke
As you ate last night, neither of you spoke
Dishes, TV, bed, the dark was filled with dread
But at least the war is over

Lift your head and look out the window
Stay that way for the rest of the day and watch the time go
Listen, the birds sing
Listen, the bells ring
All the living are dead and the dead are all living
The war is over and we are beginning

We won or we think we did
When you went away you were just a kid
And if you lost it all and you lost it
Well, we'll still be there when your war is over

Lift your head and look out the window
Stay that way for the rest of the day and watch the time go
Listen, the birds sing 
Listen, the bells ring
All the living are dead and the dead are all living
The war is over, we are beginning

Here it comes, here comes the first step
Here it comes, here comes the first step
It starts up in our bedroom after the war
It starts up in our bedroom after the war, after the war

After the war 
After the war
After the war
After the war 
After the war 
After the war
