		  Second Life

(intro)
You make me this quiet thing I'm not used to being, in lucid dreams
You got me lost in my lucid dreams

(verse 1)
You make me this quiet thing I'm not used to being
Inside of this second life I live in lucid dreams
I'm exhausted, I'm losing sleep, but you got me lost in my lucid dreams
I'm suspended above a comfortable level of silent
And I forget how to form the simplest sentence, I tried
But now I don't think I need to- I'm at ease, you're why I'm suddenly peaceful

(prechorus)
I wouldn't call it lust, 'Cause I feel no rush
And no touch, 'cause you hush, you hush me up
You hush me up (x6)

(verse 2)
I'm afraid of the monster inside my brain, and the monster under my bed
It gets stronger until I faint, and I struggled until we met
And I'm honestly not ashamed
'Cause you hush all the fuss and yell every muttering of my name
And I'm accustomed to the static that echoes in my subconscious
You got an aura about you and now I don't feel as haunted
Leaving without you, it really it doesn't bother me
I'll encounter you, even if its unconsciously

(chorus)
The lights are blinking for me, The night is for exploring
The lights are blinking for me, The night is for exploring
The lights are blinking for me, The night is for exploring
And I choose, I choose to be with you
I choose to be with you in all my lucid dreams
The lights are blinking for me
(And I'll still memorize everything so I can return to you in my second life)
The night is for exploring
(And I'll still memorize everything so I can return to you in my second life)
And I choose, I choose to be with you
(I hope you memorize everything so I can return to you in my second life)
I choose to be with you in all my lucid dreams
(I hope you memorize everything so I can return to you in my second life)
I'm suspended above a comfortable level of silence
And I forgot how to form the simplest sentence
(The lights are blinking for me) I tried
(The lights are blinking for me) But now I don't think I need to
You're why I'm suddenly peaceful
(The lights are blinking for me) I hope you memorize everything
So I can return to you in my second life
(The lights are blinking for me)
I hope you memorize everything so I can return to you in my second life

(outro)
I used to scream, you got me lost in my lucid dreams
I used to scream, you got me lost in my lucid dreams
