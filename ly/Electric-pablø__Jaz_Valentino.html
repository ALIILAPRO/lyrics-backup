		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I need you to answer babe
I need you to be there for me
I wanted to follow your lead
And never trade your side Yeah
I want you to cancel baby
Cancel the things you believe
I know you belong here with me
Said she know she mine

Yeah
You know I come alive in the night
She wanna go left than go right
Let me put some in your life
Shock make you drop how I like

I said electrify me
Love the way you push then wind me
Love the way you look behind me yeah
Love the way you look beside me
Stood
I said Electrify me
Love the way you push then wind me
Love the way look behind me
Love the way you took what I need

And I say Mmmm I Mmmm I Ay
She want round 2 won't ya come my way
And I say Mmmm I Mmmm I Ay
She press one time got it on replay
Back up then light it
Bust up the silence
Show me how you bend
You know how I like it
You know that you
Give it up on the regular baby
Do whatever ima let you Ah

You know I come alive in the night
She wanna go left than go right
Let me put some in your life
Shock make you drop how I like

I said electrify me
Love the way you push then wind me
Love the way you look behind me
Love the way you look beside me
Stood
I said Electrify me

And I say m.i.a
Luxurious Likkle ting need crème brûlée
Aye
Give a jolly jolt like Zeus
All the stress mi nuh reach for no jolly rancher purple juice
Mi want red heart no white heart texts yea
Girl I wanna feel them grooves
I had lovers say it's love then you Holt me out
But can you just Hug me through the tings dem blue
Keep loving sound
Gorgeous gyal and her bumpa cd round
Lucky local tryna take her city round
On these pecan seats can you rub me down say some nice just like Alexa now

You know I come alive in the night
She wanna go left than go right
Let me put some in your life
Shock make you drop how I like
