		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You've got this golden way 
Of making my body sway
Of making my mind fly away
Of making it fly

It's a world I love to be in
Come on let's go high above the ceiling 
Oh, what we could be feeling 
Oh, what we could be feeling 

I'm one of those witches babe
I'm one of those witches babe
Just don't try to save me, please
I don't wanna be saved

I'm one of those witches babe
I'm one of those witches babe
Just don't try to save me, please
I don't wanna be saved

Me I've got my own little magic
And I'm not tryna wreak havoc 
It's just that sometimes I see something
And I just need to have it

Let's share a few dirty habits
Let's share a few dirty habits

Last night when you pulled through
I put a spell on the moon
It was three times the size 
In your moonlit eyes

And I sang you an old tune
Mom sang me when I was half the size 
And I looked at you
And your moon-lit eyes
And your moon-lit eyes
And your moon-lit eyes
And your moon-lit eyes
And your moon-lit eyes
And your moon-lit eyes

I'm one of those witches babe
I'm one of those witches babe
Just don't try to save me, please
I don't wanna be saved

I'm one of those witches babe
I'm one of those witches babe
Just don't try to save me, please
I don't wanna be saved
