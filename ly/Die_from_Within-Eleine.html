		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Silence came down			
When movement collapsed
I uttered words
You could not understand

Ice filled my veins
As I touched you again
Though warm embrace
The cold still remained

No, I can't breathe 
Please, come back to me

How can no one understand
Though I smile
I feel dead inside

Black clouds are closing in
For you I play on broken strings
As I die from within

Death comes to all
Often the weak
But why take my friend
I was there at the end

With small tired eyes
He watched me cry
With my final kiss
I whispered goodbye

Go to sleep my sweet
Will we meet again

You can never understand
Though I smile
I am dead inside
My heart is caving in
For him I play on broken strings
As I die from within
