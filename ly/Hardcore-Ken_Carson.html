		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hardcore, I'm goin' gore
Hardcore, I'm goin' gore
Hardcore, I'm goin' gore
Hardcore, I'm goin' gore
Hardcore, I'm goin' gore
Hardcore, I'm goin' gore (star made the beat, I just took it out the oven)
Hardcore, hardcore 

I'm mad deep, in this bitch, I feel her heart
They put 'em in the casket 'cause he was sellin' fake narcs
MexikoDro, my boy gon' let it go, leave you at the park
He was talkin' that shit, then he got hit quick, we put him on the charts
Bullseye, I just hit my target, just like darts
He clout chasin', huh, he want fame, we gon' turn him to a star
5.56, filled with .223, these bullets go far
Fuck a rat, if you snitch on me, I'ma swiss cheese your car

Hardcore, I'm goin' gore
Hardcore, I'm goin' gore
Hardcore, I'm goin' gore
Hardcore, I'm goin' gore
Hardcore, I'm goin' gore
Hardcore, I'm goin' gore
Hardcore, hardcore
Hardcore, hardcore
Hardcore, hardcore
Hardcore, hardcore
Hardcore, hardcore
Hardcore, hardcore
Hardcore, hardcore
Hardcore, hardcore (star made the beat, I just took it out the oven)
Hardcore 

He think he hard but it ain't hard to step on a nail
She think I'm green, huh, this bitch think I'm kale
I flew a bitch overseas 'cause she need a tan, yeah, she gettin' pale
As soon as she land, yeah, she gettin' railed, as soon as she land
I'm catchin' a body, I'm catchin' her body, I'm catchin' that shit (catchin' that shit)
I'm in the bank, lil' bitch, she fishin', catchin' this dick
I nutted on her face, now she rockin' an eyepatch like Slick Rick
I'm cold hearted, I rolled a blunt, popped a G6, lil' bitch, I'm just gettin' started
This bitch a groupie, yeah, she keep askin', "Where Playboi Carti?"
I'm goin' stupid, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm goin re-, yeah
I'on pop no Xans, man
He was poppin' on IG Live, but in real life, that shit ain't transcend
If the push wanna come outside, then we gon' catch his lil' mans then

Hardcore, I'm goin' gore
Hardcore, I'm goin' gore
Hardcore, I'm goin' gore
Hardcore, I'm goin' gore
Hardcore, I'm goin' gore
Hardcore, I'm goin' gore
Hardcore, hardcore
Hardcore, hardcore
Hardcore, hardcore
Hardcore, hardcore
Hardcore, hardcore
Hardcore, hardcore
Hardcore, hardcore
Hardcore, hardcore
Hardcore, yeah
