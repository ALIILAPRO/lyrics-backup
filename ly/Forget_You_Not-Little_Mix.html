		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey baby, three months since I walked away
I've been out here lookin' for space
Now I need you, babe, I need you, babe
Oh baby, uh huh, I'm a little hotter, I know
But it's no fun being hot on your own
That's why I need you, babe, I need you, babe, uh

How come they don't make 'em like you, babe?
Oh, I never respected
I shouldn't have left it, for real
We can make this hard or this easy
So, before you move on, I got something to tell you for real

In the club, boy, I'll forget you not
Bada-bang-bang
With my friends, boy, I'll forget you not
Bada-bang-bang
Brand new man, boy, I'll forget you not
Bada-bang-bang
Baby, baby, I'll forget you not

Oh, my body get hot like that (hot, hot, hot)
Gimme that love, I'ma throw it right back
When it's late at night, I know it gets so high (so high)
So if you need somebody, I'ma give you that love

How come they don't make 'em like you, babe?
Oh, I never respected
I shouldn't have left it, for real (for real)
We can make this hard or this easy
So, before you move one I got something to tell you for real

In the club, boy, I'll forget you not
Bada-bang-bang
With my friends, boy, I'll forget you not
Bada-bang-bang
Brand new man, boy, I'll forget you not
Bada-bang-bang
Baby, baby, I'll forget you not
In the club, boy, I'll forget you not
Bada-bang-bang
With my friends, boy, I'll forget you not
Bada-bang-bang
Brand new man, boy, I'll forget you not
Bada-bang-bang
Baby, baby, I'll forget you not

Oh, I wish that we could chill like we used to do
Felt like there was no one in the room, except me and you
Now I'm passing people in the street, wishing they were you
Oh, baby, baby, I'll forget you not

In the club, boy, I'll forget you not
Bada-bang-bang
With my friends, boy, I'll forget you not
Bada-bang-bang
Brand new man, boy, I'll forget you not
Bada-bang-bang
Baby, baby, I'll forget you not

Oh, no, no, no (baby, baby, baby)
Sorry that I had to let you go
Oh, no, no, no
Maybe my friends, they were right all along (ooh, woah)
Oh, baby, uh, uh, yeah-yeah
Wish I know then, baby
What I know now
Oh, na, na, na, na, na
