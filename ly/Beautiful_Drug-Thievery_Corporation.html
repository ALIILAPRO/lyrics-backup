		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh my love, it's not time for us to say our farewell
Not to deny ourselves from ourselves

And with the time the season passes once again
Memories that hang in autumn's wind
Memories that hang once again

You are the drug in my veins
And I'm waiting to feel it again
And I'm waiting to feel it again, again

Through the years love radiates throughout life's charade
Shines through everything that remains unsaid
Shines through everything that remains unsaid

You are the drug in my veins
And I'm waiting to feel it again
You are the drug in my veins
And I'm waiting to feel it again, again

You are the drug in my veins
And I'm waiting to feel it again
