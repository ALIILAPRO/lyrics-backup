		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Flash goes a little hummingbird a dart and worried thread
At the screen door by his lemon tree out here with the quick and the dead
Designer blinds above LA frame the perfect view
It's gonna be another day of sun and shameless blue

By his cutting block the time has come for the fruit there by the juicer
He grinds fresh coffee for himself he's beaten our producer
La Times lies on the stone warming there like bread
Hey what's not to like out here with the quick and the dead

Good on you son, good on you
The Camden shuffle and the old one-two
Good on you son, good on you a-ha, oh yeah
Good on you son, good on you
The Camden shuffle and the old one-two yeah

You wanna know what happiness is? In his eye lives a hunter's gleam
Something to look forward to, this cat's gonna get the cream
Skin of a mango is so smooth , smoother than the devil
Cut it, slice it, chop it up to the rhythm of a cockney rebel

Back in Blighty there's a flat on a grimy sink estate
That's why he walked out of that and went to the Golden State
Left the backie and the beer where he was born and bred
Now he's cutting it out here with the quick and the dead

Good on you son, good on you
The Camden shuffle and the old one-two
Good on you son, good on you a-ha, oh yeah
What would you have had him do
The Camden shuffle and the old one-two yeah

Yeah, good on you son, good on you
The Camden shuffle and the old one-two
Good on you son, good on you a-ha, oh yeah
Good on you son, good on you
The Camden shuffle and the old one-two yeah yeah
