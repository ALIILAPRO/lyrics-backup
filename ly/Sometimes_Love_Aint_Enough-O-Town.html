		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Look at us
Why are we so far apart?
Both all alone in the dark
Lonely with no one to hold

Oh, I know you're seven hours behind
We're living in separate times
How did my heart get so cold?

It's hard to live with you but I can't live without you, my love
We argue too much and somehow we lost touch
And now it's all gone

Baby, you know sometimes love just ain't enough
And it's hard to admit when it's over
When you hit a wall in your heart
And you're watching it all fall apart
Sometimes love just ain't enough
If you've got the world on your shoulders
The road that you're walking's too rough
Sometimes love just ain't enough

Wide awake, thinking of moments we shared
Can't get you out of my head
No one can love me like you

I try to be strong but I know you're long gone and it hurts
I talk about calling but I know all I've got are these empty words

Baby, I know sometimes love just ain't enough
And it's hard to admit when it's over
When you hit a wall in your heart
And you're watching it all fall apart
Sometimes love just ain't enough
If you've got the world on your shoulders
And the road that you're walking's too rough
Sometimes love just ain't enough

Sometimes I wonder if it's worth all the pain
If our love still remains
Can we try one more time?

Baby, you know sometimes love just ain't enough
And it's hard to admit when it's over, it's over
When you hit a wall in your heart, in your heart baby
You're watching it all fall apart
Sometimes love just ain't enough, enough for you
If you've got the world on your shoulders
And the road that you're walking's too rough
Sometimes love just ain't enough

Watch it all fall down, watch it all fall down
I'm never letting go now, never letting go now
Oh never never no, will never let you go now
Oh, sometimes love just ain't enough
