		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  Farewell, I didn't mean to let you

After all these wasted nights
I can't pretend that I'm doing fine
I've played it back a thousand times
But now I see it and I realize

That the damage is done and it's obvious
We can never go back to the way it was
We're drifting apart and it's killing us
It's killing us

Farewell,
I didn't mean to let you

Let you down, mess it up
We both knew it couldn't last forever
It's coming down, I've had enough
I guess we crumbled under all the pressure
I did my best for what it's worth
And I gave you all this heart could give so
Farewell
I didn't mean to let you
Down
Down

There was a time you'd scream my name
It used to be my getaway
Now all we do is just complain
Well maybe I'm the one to blame

But the damage is done and it's obvious
We can never go back to the way it was
We're drifting apart and it's killing us
It's killing us

Farewell,
I didn't mean to let you

Let you down, mess it up
We both knew it couldn't last forever
It's coming down, I've had enough
I guess we crumbled under all the pressure
I did my best for what it's worth
And I gave you all this heart could give so
Farewell
I didn't mean to let you
Down
Down

It's such a shame
How did we end up this way?
We can't go back
And things will never be the same
All hopes faded
Is this what you wanted?
Is this what you wanted?

Farewell,
I didn't mean to let you

Let you down, mess it up
We both knew it couldn't last forever
It's coming down, and I've had enough
I guess we crumbled under all the pressure
I did my best for what it's worth
And I gave you all this heart could give so
Farewell
I didn't mean to let you
Farewell
I didn't mean to let you
Down
Down
Farewell
