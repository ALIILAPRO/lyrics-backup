		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've got my own idea of fun
Don't need to get drunk at the club
And start kissing strangers
Don't like the danger
I like to stay at home at night
You think it's lame but I'm alright
Don't need your two cents
On my life events

And maybe we'd be friends
But it's too hard
When I can't blend into your world
Not that kind of girl

'Cause according to you I'm too precious
You're wishin' that I was more reckless
You're wishin' that I would smoke 'til I'm high
And play with the guys, regret this
You're wishin' that I was more trouble
Sorry for being a struggle
I do what I want and may not be your type
Sorry, I can't be a person you like
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm

I never wanted to offend
Do what you want, I can't pretend
That I'm a rebel, not on your level
I need control inside my head
'Cause if it's gone, I'm dead
And I could try to forget it but you just don't get it yourself

And maybe we'd be friends
But it's too hard
When I can't blend into your world
Not that kind of girl

'Cause according to you I'm too precious
You're wishin' that I was more reckless
You're wishin' that I would smoke 'til I'm high
And play with the guys, regret this
You're wishin' that I was more trouble
Sorry for being a struggle
I do what I want and may not be your type
Sorry, I can't be a person you like

I guess that you need your escape
But I'll stay here
I don't need to disappear
Between what's real and what is fake
You stress me out

'Cause according to you I'm too precious (precious)
You're wishin' that I was more reckless (reckless)
But you're following the crowd now
Sorry to let you down

'Cause according to you I'm too precious
You're wishin' that I was more reckless
You're wishin' that I would smoke 'til I'm high
And play with the guys, regret this
You're wishin' that I was more trouble
Sorry for being a struggle
I do what I want and may not be your type
Sorry, I can't be a person you like

Ba-da, ba-da, ba-da, da-ba (mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm)
Ba-da, ba-da, ba-da, da-ba (mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm)
