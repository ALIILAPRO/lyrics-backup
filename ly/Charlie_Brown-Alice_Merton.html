		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Small kid in a small town, lived with his head down
Good luck never came his way (came his way)
Tragic in the making, a heart full of aching
Those thoughts never went away (went away)

And when all you've known is your own four walls
And they get so close and it hurts 'cause you're so afraid, so afraid
So he kept running a-, running a-, running a-, running away

(Charlie Brown)
Hold tight, we're moving on
Keep that dream just a little bit longer (Charlie Brown)
Hold tight, we're moving on
Keep that dream just a little bit longer (Charlie Brown)
Hold tight, we're moving on
Keep that dream just a little bit longer (Charlie Brown)
Hold tight, we're moving on
Keep that dream just a little bit longer

Clean shave and a tie on, he's taking a ride
On a bus through town in a far-off land
Still stuck in the dirt, there was nothing but hurt
Too bad that clothes don't make a man

And you hold out hope that you might belong, Charlie Brown

(Charlie Brown)
Hold tight, we're moving on
Keep that dream just a little bit longer (Charlie Brown)
Hold tight, we're moving on
Keep that dream just a little bit longer (Charlie Brown)
Hold tight, we're moving on
Keep that dream just a little bit longer (Charlie Brown)
Hold tight, we're moving on
Keep that dream just a little bit longer

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Hold tight, we're moving on
Keep that dream just a little bit longer
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Hold tight, we're moving on
Keep that dream just a little bit longer

Running away, running away (oh)
Running away, running away (oh)
Running away, running away (oh)
Running away, running away (oh)
(He kept) running away, running away (oh)
Running away, running away (oh)
Running away, running away (oh)
Running away

(Charlie Brown)
Hold tight, we're moving on
Keep that dream just a little bit longer (Charlie Brown)
Hold tight, we're moving on
Keep that dream just a little bit longer (Charlie Brown)
Hold tight, we're moving on (oh-oh-oh)
Keep that dream just a little bit longer (oh-oh-oh) (Charlie Brown)
Hold tight, we're moving on
Keep that dream just a little bit longer

Hold tight, we're moving on (oh-oh-oh)
Keep that dream just a little bit longer (oh-oh-oh) (Charlie Brown)
Hold tight, we're moving on
Keep that dream just a little bit longer
