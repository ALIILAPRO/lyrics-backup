		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A dream of life
Yeah, it's my destiny

Bookbag full of white and they all in the supersize
ThaiBoy fucking goon, got it all like a superstar
30th floor, in BK, that's a crazy town
Really had it coming, ain't no way around
GTB when they around, time goes super slow
Hundred cities, hundred towns, I'm doing shows (I'm on the road)
30th floor, in the 30th floor
30th floor, in the 30th floor

Sour cherry (cherry)
Taste like candy (taste like candy)
You as my destiny (you as my destiny)
They can't stand me (can't stand me)
I'm not standing (I'm not standing)
I keep that energy (keep that energy)
Silver camo (camo)
Guilt and pleasure (pleasure)
It got the best of me (best of me)
Kiss the candle (kiss the candle)
Blow the cover (blow the cover), but do it casually

Bookbag full of white and they all in the supersize
ThaiBoy fucking goon, got it all like a superstar
30th floor, in BK, that's a crazy town
Really had it coming (yeah, it's my destiny), ain't no waiting around
GTB when they around, time goes super slow
Hundred cities, hundred towns, I'm doing shows (I'm on the road)
30th floor, in the 30th floor
30th floor, in the 30th floor

Bookbag full of white
(Taste like candy)
(You as my destiny)
When they around
(I keep that energy)
A dream of life
30th floor, in the 30th floor
Kiss the candle, blow the cover
