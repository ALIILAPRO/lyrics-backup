		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Never really over it
At night it keeps me up a bit
Afraid of this reality
So I run away, run
It’s hard to do the right thing
You wouldn’t know how much it’s hurtin'
Anxiety finds its way in me
But I run away, run

The minute I see your body
My skins starts tingling
It’s when you come too close to me

(That) I feel like latching onto you
Closer than I ever knew
Oh once I'm tangled, it is true
That I can’t undo, it’s hard to do (My heart from you)
Want to be high on you
Need to be wrapped around you
Once we are tangled, it is true
That I can't undo, it’s hard to do

Still not really over it
Don't know why it is so hard to split
I'm not ready yet, to face my fears
So I run away, run
Have I past the point of no return
Did I not get a chance to learn
All that I was ever taught
Was to run away, run

The minute I see your body
My skins starts tingling
It’s when you come too close to me

(That) I feel like latching onto you
Closer than I ever knew
Oh once I'm tangled, it is true
That I can’t undo, it’s hard to do (My heart from you)
Want to be high on you
Need to be wrapped around you
Once we are tangled, it is true
That I can't undo, it’s hard to do

All I do is run away, run away
Are you really here to stay, here to stay
I'm really tangled can’t you see, can’t you see
It’s when come too close to me, close to me
