		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You jump in front of the bullet
The family put you to it
You might survive the first thousand shots
Back to the end of the line

You hold the will to survive them
Answer to those you have failed
Time to clean your room 
And show you are able to stop

Beating yourself down
You've arrived
A wealth of respect, a world of a regard
You've always belonged

You have to go on
I just want you to feel the gun in your hand
You used to hold aspiration
You couldn't see the limitations

Even in your youth you were unsurpassed
But driven by grief and it couldn't last
Sometimes promise,
Sometimes goodbye

Confessed to all through bloodshot eyes
I just want you to feel the gun in your hand
It only breakds you until you get off
I'm not gonna watch you kill yourself to live

It's all so average until you get off
I'm not gonna wait here until the body's cold
I just want you to feel the gun in your hand
