		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Forget the jar of Vaseline
Hey rich bitch-boy, I'm not gonna be your queen
And you can drool, beg me and hope
There's no damn way I'm playing drop the soap
Okay, I know I'm strange, but I ain't no queer
So take your rage and disappear
But I'm proud not to be PC
'Cause

I like goils
I like goils
I like goils
Bad goils all over this world

Now I don't know whose ass you've licked
No shit-tongued boy will ever taste my dick
He says, "How 'bout no sex? We'll just be friends"
Hey no thanks, pal, I'll stick to lesbians
You're right! A sexist pig, I guess it's true
(I hate all men including you)
I don't care what you think of me
'Cause

I like goils
I like goils
I like goils
Bad goils all over this world

I'm quite flattered that you think I'm cute
But I don't deal well with compacted poop
So look, if my views make you annoyed
You're just jealous I don't have haemorrhoids
So now, to make it clear that you can't bone me
My tattooed ass reads "EXIT ONLY"
I don't care much for sodomy
'Cause

I like goils
I like goils
I like goils
Bad goils all over this world

I like goils
I like goils
I like goils
Bad goils all over this world
