		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Life is degrading and silently making me
Spun out inside my own head
Spewing and craving, this darkness is baiting me
Down the road to my own death

I can't take this, I might break it
Watch it all fall down

So come give me the truth you hide
Take the pain inside

Humiliating, I fall to it's craving
It feeds on the doubt in my heart
Sinking and fading, our feelings I'm saving
To fix what I tore all apart

I can't take this, I might break it
Watch it all fall down

So come give me the truth you hide
Take the pain inside

I'm lost, you'll never find me
I'm lost, you'll never find me
I'm lost, you'll never find me
I'm lost, you'll never find me

I'm lost, you'll never find me
I'm lost, you'll never find me
I'm lost, you'll never find me
I'm lost

So come give me the truth you hide
Take the pain inside

I'm lost, you'll never find me
I'm lost, you'll never find me (I watched you die, now watch me die)
I'm lost, you'll never find me (I watched you die, now watch me die)
I'm lost, come for me (I watched you die, now watch me die)

I'm not doing fine
I'm not doing fine
I'm not doing fine
I'm not doing fine

I'm not doing fine
I'm not doing fine
I'm not doing fine
