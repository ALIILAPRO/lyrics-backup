		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Get down, it's saturday night. 
Saturday night, saturday night.
Get down, it's saturday night
Saturday night, saturday night.

Saturday morning, 
Friday's enemy
Housework is calling, 
But where to begin
Kids are out of school, 
Trying to find a friend
Everybody's busy, 
Can't wait for the night to begin

You work all week long, 
You work your fingers to the bone
Fridays' enemy, 
I can't wait for saturday to begin!

Gonna have myself some fun fun fun fun
(Get down it's saturday night, gonna be alright)
Make love until the morning come (x2)

I love to party, everybody does.
You can't wait for the weekend no no
See what you get into
But you've got to get down down down down
Even if you stay at home
Make love and listen to the music
You've got to let yourself go go go go go, girl

You work all week long, 
You work your fingers to the bone
Fridays' enemy, yeah.
I can't wait for saturday to begin!

Gonna have myself some fun fun fun fun
(Get down it's saturday night, gonna be alright)
Make love until the morning come (x2)

In New York, in Detroit 
Yeah Yeah.
In New York, in Detroit
Even in L.A.

I can't wait for saturday to begin (x4)

You work all week long, 
You work your fingers to the bone
Fridays' enemy, 
I can't wait for saturday to begin!

Gonna have myself some fun fun fun fun
(Get down it's saturday night, gonna be alright)
Make love until the morning come (x2)

Some like the party, some like the dance
Some like to make romance
Some like to smoke, some like to joke
Some like to drink, some like to think
Some is on the blink
Me, my baby and me, yeah.

You work all week long, 
You work the fingers to the bone
Fridays' enemy, 
I can't wait for saturday to begin!

Get down, get down, get down and spend the night.
