		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  For every dream I was chasing,
Trying to find something I could put my faith in,
Lover, it wasn't wasted
When, at the end of the road, you were waiting.

All I know,


Is that I never needed proof
The way most people do,
It's enough to just be here,
It's enough to just have you,
And that's always been the truth,
That whatever we walk through,
It's enough to just be here,
It's enough to just have you.

It's enough, it's enough,
It's enough to just have you.

And when that doubt spins in my mind,
That when I hold you it might be the last time,
I'm starting to understand, 
These moments don't fade anymore
You turn this life into an open door,

And all I know,

Is that I never needed proof
The way most people do,
It's enough to just be here,
It's enough to just have you,
And that's always been the truth,
That whatever we walk through,
It's enough to just be here,
It's enough to just have you.

Lover, I feel the universe around us here
Like nothing's ever been so clear,
Still all our time can come and go
And I'll always know,

Is that I never needed proof
The way most people do,
It's enough to just be here,
It's enough to just have you,
And that's always been the truth,
That whatever we walk through,
It's enough to just be here,
It's enough to just have you.

It's enough, it's enough,
It's enough, it's enough,
No, I never needed proof.
It's enough, it's enough,
It's enough, it's enough,

No, I never needed proof.

It's enough, it's enough,
It's enough, it's enough.
