		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What I have in me
In the mind is you
(I would die if this was wrong)
What I'm feeling now
What I'm heading into!
(I am lost in pain without you)
(So cold, so alone)

All I have is you
It is all that I'm waiting for
All I need is you
(Now I can't make it through)

All the nights I've prayed
Must this all be untrue?
(I am not prepared to be strong)
I just can't believe I am losing you
(Unprepared to carry on)
(I can't see you walk away)
(So cold, so alone)

All I have is you
It is all that I'm waiting for
All I need is you
(Now I can't make it through)
I am losing you forever
(I am lost in pain without you)
I am leaving ground forever
(Forever, forever)

Distant, so far, destiny is selecting me
I can't be strong, life is disconnecting me
Now loneliness infecting me
Gone are the days, you were there protecting me

So cold (so alone)

All I have is you
It is all that I'm waiting for
All I need is you
(Now I can't make it through)
I am losing you forever
(I am lost in pain without you)
I am leaving ground forever (forever)
All I have is you (It is all that I'm breathing for)
All I need is you (Now I can't make it through)

It is all that I'm waiting for
(Waiting for, waiting for)
(Waiting for, waiting for, waiting for)
