		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Red pills, said she love it when she can't feel
Dry eyes, now her demons looking so real
Mix it with the molly now she high up In the clouds
Such a pretty girl and she stands out in the crowd
Got a white dress on with the loui bag
And she's hiding in designer to cover up her sadness
Searching for a feeling that she's never had
Getting high cause she's lost inside the madness
Yeah, yeah
Don't know why but I wanna get to know ya
Yeah, yeah
I feel like I could be the one to save her
Bring her out, bring her out of the darkness
Show her I, show her I'll be there regardless
Shut me out, you can try if you want to
Put no one above you
Show you how to love you
She don't wanna let her guard down
Took a few more just to calm down
Anxious all the time but it never shows
I can see the damage you don't know which fucking way to go, yeah
Red pills, said she love it when she can't feel
Dry eyes, now her demons looking so real
Mix it with the molly now she high up In the clouds
Such a pretty girl and she stands out in the crowd
Got a white dress on with the loui bag
And she's hiding in designer to cover up her sadness
Searching for a feeling that she's never had
Getting high cause she's lost inside the madness
You can't stop cause you're addicted to this life
Baby I know that you hate the darkness so you're always high
Don't be scared baby you won't know if you don't try
But don't cry, don't cry
She don't wanna let her guard down
Took a few more just to calm down
Anxious all the time but it never shows
I can see the damage you don't know which fucking way to go, yeah
Red pills, said she love it when she can't feel
Dry eyes, now her demons looking so real
Mix it with the molly now she high up In the clouds
Such a pretty girl and she stands out in the crowd
Got a white dress on with the loui bag
And she's hiding in designer to cover up her sadness
Searching for a feeling that she's never had
Getting high cause she's lost inside the madness
