		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's so easy, but I can't do it
So risky, but I gotta chance it
So funny, there's nothing to laugh about
My money, that's all you want to talk about
I can see what you want me to be
But I'm no fool
It's in the lap of the Gods

Whoa, whoa, la la la, whoa
I can see what you want me to be
But I'm no fool
No beginning, there's no ending
There's no meaning in my pretending
Believe me, life goes on and on and
Forgive me when I ask you where do I belong
You say I (you can do it)
Can't (you can do it)
(You can go and set it free) set you free from me
But that's not true
It's in the lap of the Gods

Whoa, whoa, la la la, whoa
I can see what you want me to be
But I'm no fool
It's in the lap of the Gods
Whoa, whoa, la la la, whoa
Whoa, whoa, la la
Whoa, whoa, ooh

But that's not true
It's in the lap of the Gods
Whoa, whoa, la la la, whoa
Whoa, whoa, la la
Whoa, whoa, ooh

But I'm no fool
It's in the lap of the Gods
Whoa, whoa, la la la, whoa
Whoa, whoa, la la
Whoa, whoa, oooh
It's in the lap of the Gods
Whoa, whoa, la la la, whoa
Whoa, whoa, la la
Whoa, whoa, oooh

But I'm no fool
It's in the lap of the Gods
Whoa, whoa, la la la, whoa
Whoa, whoa, la la
Whoa, whoa, oooh
