		  Battering down sentence, Fighting Against Convictions (2X)
I find myself growing in an environment 
Where finding food is just as hard as paying the rent
In trodding these roads of trials and tribulations
I've seen where some have died in desperation
To keep battering down sentence, fighting against convictions (2X)

In a family of ten and raised in the ghetto
Hustling is the only education I know
Can't grow no crops in this concrete jungle
A situation like this is getting too hard to handle
To keep battering down sentence, fighting against convictions (2X)

With a pregnant woman, yes
and five kids to care for
Can't cool my heels, I've got to do the town
As skillful as I am, the jailer-man is bound to find me
I pray the day will come when I shall be free from 
Battering down sentence, fighting against convictions (2X)

To be trapped and caught and taken before judge and angry jury
Pleading before men, who seem to have no mercy
Can't afford to find myself down in the dungeons
I've got to stay free so that my kids won't be
Battering down sentence, fighting against convictions (2X)

Now a fugitive at large
Could this be my destiny
With no one to care for the welfare of my family
But in solitude I've found new faith and hope in this I'll be secure
For mind and soul would soon be weary
Just couldn't take no more
Battering down sentence, fighting against convictions
