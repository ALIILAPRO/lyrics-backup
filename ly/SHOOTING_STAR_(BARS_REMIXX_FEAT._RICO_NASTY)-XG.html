		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
Uh-uh
Yeah
XG 

Uh, everything I do, I do it A1, flawless
Make 'em go insane, pandemonium riot
Always looking fresh
Got that green in my diet
Head to my toe
Shinin' like canary diamonds (bling, bling)
Yeah, we dem cool kids (yeah), nothing to it (uh-uh)
Going stupid, saucin' (drip, drippin')
We a movement, never losin'
Making moves, stay poppin' 

Baby, if I give it my all, will it pay off?
Working overtime, no days off
All these shooting stars in the dark
All these shooting stars in the dark
Make a wish (yeah-yeah-yeah)

Taking off from the ground, it's amazing
So outta this world, I'm in space, now I'm going up
Headin' to the stars
Wouldn't trade it out for another life, no

Yeah, we ridin', 'n ridin', 'n ridin' on up
So shinin', 'n shinin', 'n shinin' for sure
Ooh-ah, yeah, I'm lookin' so lavish
Ooh-ah, put in work like it's a habit
It's a big move, every day's like a dream
Makin' big moves, yeah, we do it for our team
Ooh-ah, I'm lookin' so lavish
Ooh-ah, yeah, I bet you can't imagine

I be the one, huh
Don't need to stunt, huh
'Cause we coolin', suit and boot it just for fun, huh
You couldn't run up on me, I'm too outta this world (this world)
I got that spaceship jumpin' ready for my launch (three, two, one)

I don't care if I'm a brat
I'm just goin' dumb (goin' dumb)
I ain't tryin' to fire shots
But they doin' nothin' (doin' nothin')

I know they watching me, I'm what I wanna be (nuh)
Nobody touching me, I've got this energy (huh, woo)

Baby, if I give it my all, will it pay off?
Working overtime, no days off
All these shooting stars in the dark
All these shooting stars in the dark
Make a wish (yeah-yeah-yeah)

Taking off from the ground, it's amazing
So outta this world, I'm in space, now I'm going up
Headin' to the stars
Wouldn't trade it out for another life, no

Yeah, we ridin', 'n ridin', 'n ridin' on up
So shinin', 'n shinin', 'n shinin' for sure
Ooh-ah, yeah, I'm lookin' so lavish
Ooh-ah, put in work like it's a habit
It's a big move, every day is like a dream
Makin' big moves, yeah, we do it for our team
Ooh-ah, I'm lookin' so lavish
Ooh-ah, yeah, I bet you can't imagine

Oh, you rockin' with a dream team
Comets droppin' when we hit the scene
Oh, you rockin' with a dream team (ooh-ooh)
We shootin' from another galaxy (ooh-ooh)
And you know we take it all the way
Lights and camera action, it's just how we live
Don't get it twisted, this ain't child play
Just know that XG's going all the way

Yeah, we ridin', 'n ridin', 'n ridin' on up (ooh-ooh)
So shinin', 'n shinin', 'n shinin' for sure
Ooh-ah, (shinin', shinin', yeah) I'm lookin' so lavish
Ooh-ah, put in work like it's a habit (I'm lookin' so lavish) 
It's a big move, every day's like a dream
Makin' big moves (ooh), as I should 'cause I'm a queen
Ooh-ah, yeah, I'm lookin' so lavish
Ooh-ah, yeah, I bet you can't imagine
