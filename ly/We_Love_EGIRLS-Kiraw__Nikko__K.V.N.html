		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fuck a Egirl in her face
Cut that bitch off
I do not want to play no chase
You watch how I move
And you copy all my ways
Finna steal your bitch
And I fuck that bitch for days
Do not worry I dont bite
If you come to close
You get stripes
This ain't no Nike
I don't want to talk
I just want to take your life
Welcome to the party
I will fuck him up on sight
Bitch Im geeked up
Grind my teeth up
Off the white
Need a backwood
Slide the visa
Smoking christ
Feel like jesus
I walk on water
You walking on on ice
Switch like the seasons
You can not see me
Im not in sight
Make it blood rain
I make it blood rain
I hold my breath
When that gun swing
Im taking life
And now I pray for death
Take out the buck knife
And gut that motherfucker
On the steps
I got skulls on the walls
Catacombs where I rest
Fuck a Egirl in her face
Cut that bitch off
I do not want to play no chase
You watch how I move
And you copy all my ways
Finna steal your bitch
And I fuck that bitch for days
Do not worry I dont bite
If you come to close
You get stripes
This ain't no Nike
I don't want to talk
I just want to take your life
Welcome to the party
I will fuck him up on sight
If I have step your block
Then I'm walking off
With your life
Like my god
They love to talk
But boy
They do not wanna fight
Let me pull this beam
Have you fucking round
Seeing lights
Like UFO
My goddamn team
How we going up
Taking flight
I got these motherfuckers dancing
Shoot discos out the pipe
Welcome the bottom of the pit
Baby won't you come
Stay the night?
My heart hollow
Just like the tips in my stick
I know it is not right
To leave them hanging
But leave them hanging
They swanging in the light
Of the moon
Who wanna fight?
Im in the mood
Who wanna fight
Wanna fight
Who wanna fight
I'm in the mood
Like run up
Cut up
