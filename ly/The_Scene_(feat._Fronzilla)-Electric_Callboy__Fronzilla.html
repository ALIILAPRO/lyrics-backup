		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  T-H-E S-C-E-N-E
T-H-E S-C-E-N-E
Everybody get the fuck up!

Everything you spit and everything you sing
Every fucking line, it doesn't mean a thing
What
I know you're just a bragging bitch
So go to hell if you won't admit
Twenty thousand likes, I don't give a shit
So put the middle fingers up
'Cause you are making me sick
Fuck the money, fuck the fame
Everything that you pretend
I will never be a part of what you represent

Hey, I don't give a shit
So fuck that
You make me sick
I don't give a shit

Living on the fast lane
It doesn't mean a damn thing at all
Hey, let's fuck the scene
Ready or not, let me hear you scream
Hate us, fake us, rate us
We always stay the same
Hey, let's fuck the scene
Ready or not, let me hear you scream

T-H-E S-C-E-N-E
T-H-E S-C-E-N-E
Everybody get the fuck up!

Go fuck yourself and fuck the scene
Don't give a fuck about your feature in that magazine
What, I know you gotta talk it big
But you should better care about your fan base prick
Fuck expectations from people I don't know
I'm not a motherfucking rockstar, it's never been a goal
And everybody's acting politically correct
But when you drop all pretense
You stab each other in the back

Hey, I don't give a shit
So fuck that
You make me sick
I don't give a shit

Living on the fast lane
It doesn't mean a damn thing at all
Hey, let's fuck the scene
Ready or not, let me hear you scream
Hate us, fake us, rate us
We always stay the same
Hey, let's fuck the scene
Ready or not, let me hear you scream

T-H-E- S-C-E-N-E (yeah, tell 'em girls)
T-H-E- S-C-E-N-E (uh huh, that's right)

Yeah, aw shit, Fronzilla in the building baby
Get the fuck up!
Fuck your scene I'm a metalcore OG
Fuck the trends and the bullshit magazines
I speak my mind and it turns into a headline
Using my name so they can turn into a goldmine
Livin' in the fast lane, nothin' means a damn thing
Call it how I see it, I believe it when I see it, what
That's the way the world works today
A bunch of trendy motherfuckers to control the scene

Living on the fast lane
It doesn't mean a damn thing at all
Hey, let's fuck the scene
Ready or not, let me hear you scream
Hate us, fake us, rate us
We always stay the same
Hey, let's fuck the scene
Ready or not, let me hear you scream

I wanna kick in your front teeth
And I'm gonna fuck your face
Choke on this!
Hate us or rate us, you'll never commiserate us
Because you'll never be a man enough to
Say it to my fucking face!
