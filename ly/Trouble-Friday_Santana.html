		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There was nothing you could of done to make me stay
There was nobody else, I left for myself
It's just that, how do i say this? Hey
Girl we're finally acquainted
I been waiting too long
I'm at the hotel lobby
It's your favourite song
Put that shit in your nose babe
And come and and show me how you roll babe
And if you're down, we can roleplay
I'm fucked up at the spot with my old thing
And I took her to the room of the devil
Come and show me what you do with your mouth
If her mama find out, we in trouble
Shit, we'll probably have to leave this town
Cause we'll both be dead by tomorrow
Go ahead, make the most of it now
Cause I won't be here again
Girl I won't be here again
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Baby what we got in store?
Meet me in the room full of blow
Baby we got lines, we got blow
Come and show you how you wanna roll
Ooh, yeah, baby
We'll be together forever
I'll keep that pussy wetter
And I'ma fuck you like a pornstar
Let me fuck you like a pornstar
Baby show love like a pornstar
Like a pornstar, baby pop that pussy
We don't have time to waste
Time to waste yeah
It wasn't you
It was all me
I still care for you
I want the very best for you
But i can no longer be there for you
I just wanted to clear the air for you
And I got two lines for the white girls
And I got two pills for my black girls
And I got two bitches for the right girls
But i'll probably get high with the shy girl
She the one in the back, on the east side
But she still show love to the northside
And I love my baby
I think she loves me too
I think she loves me too, oh babe
But anyway
