		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ayy, ayy

Like a little theatre show
That we used to make as kids of cardboard when we were home
Looking down from in the gods as people go on below
Trapped inside the nightclub, tiny little minds are alone
Lighting passing overhead which misses some and then finds them
Like their prison-breaking from Alcatraz into their minds
Heaven say they sin just for fun
Of the seven deadly sins, envy's the only not fun

Wayo
Too much yayo
Wayo
Too much yayo

Living in the present is like
Trying to sit on the very, very head of a pin
Which is why we try to lose our heads whatever the thing
But you can't run away from this, there's no place that far
Pinballing around to the rhythm
Hitting points and bouncing straight back between flippers and in
People are so pleased at their plight
They are not the first to feel this, not even tonight

Ayy, why do I never learn?
Monday, Tuesday, my head feeling hurt
Wednesday, done doing death
Thursday, Friday, come do it again

Leave the ash on your cigarette and wait for it to fall
'Til the alleyway is full, you wait for nothing at all
Smiling like he's loving a text
But he's watching his own Snapchat 'cause he's loving himself
He don't like pain, but he must quite like hell
He don't like cocaine, he just quite likes the smell
Crying's the weapon of the weak
Slander is the angle if you're after getting nowhere

Wayo
Too much yayo
Wayo

Ayy, why do I never learn?
Monday, Tuesday, my head feeling hurt
Wednesday, done doing death
Thursday, Friday, come do it again

Wayo
Too much yayo
Wayo
Too much yayo

Like a little theatre show
That we used to make as kids of cardboard when we were home
Looking down from in the gods as people go on below
Trapped inside the nightclub, tiny little minds are alone
Lighting passing overhead which misses some and then finds them
Like their prison-breaking from Alcatraz into their minds
Heaven say they sin just for fun
Of the seven deadly sins, envy's the only not fun

Wayo
Too much yayo
Wayo
Too much yayo

Like a little theatre show
That we used to make
