		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Listen to the wind blow
Watch the sun rise
Run in the shadows
Damn your love, damn your lies

Listen to the wind blow
Watch the sun rise
Run in the shadows
Damn your love, damn your lies

And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying
You will never break the chain

And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying
You will never break the chain

Never break the chain
Never break the chain
Never break the chain
Never break the chain
Never break the chain
Never break the chain
Never break the chain
Never break the chain

Listen to the wind blow
Down comes the night
Run in the shadows
Damn your love, damn your lies
(Never break the chain)
Break the silence
Damn the dark, damn the light (never break the chain)
(Never break the chain)
Run in the shadows
Damn your love, damn your lies

And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying
You will never break the chain

And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying
You will never break the chain
Never break the chain

Never break the chain
Never break the chain
Never break the chain
Never break the chain
Never break the chain
Never break the chain
Never break the chain
Never break the chain
Never break the chain
Never break the chain
Never break the chain
Never break the chain
Never break the chain
Never break the chain
Never break the chain
Never break the chain
Never break the chain
Never break the chain
Never break the chain
Never break the chain
Never break the chain

And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying
You will never break the chain

And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying
You will never break the chain

Never break the chain
Never break the chain
You will never break the chain
Never break the chain
You will never break the chain
You will never break the chain
You will never break the chain
You will never break the chain
You will never break the chain
