Don't know my niggas strapped, they came in with the strap (blatt)
She see designer on my kick, I blow her back (brrah)
Mama hit my phone that day like, "Where you at?" (Where you at?)
Had to tell my mama, "Yeah, I got them racks"
Had to tell my twin, "Yeah, we got that bag"

She give head, she give head, she gon' choke (grrt-grrah)
And she like when I grab on her throat
Not your speed, lil' bitch too slow (skrrt-skrrt)
Got my grip, lil' nigga, can't go (bah-bah)
Pop my shit 'cause my mama ain't raised no ho

Twenty, fifty, hundred, yeah (yeah, yeah)
It ain't nothing to get his scalp pushed back, yeah, back (ayy)
I was broke and now I can't go back, yeah, back, yeah
Just know somebody got that tool, we never lack (yeah, yeah)
Know all my niggas shoot, they take you off the map
