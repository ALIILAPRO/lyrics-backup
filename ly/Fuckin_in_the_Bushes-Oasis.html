		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We put this festival on you bastards, with a lotta love
We worked for one year for you pigs
And you want to break our walls down?
And you want to destroy us?
Well you go to hell

Kids are running around naked, fuckin' in the bushes
Kids are running around naked, fuckin' in the bushes
Kids are running around naked, fuckin' in the bushes
Kids are running around naked, fuckin' in the bushes

I love it

Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah

Kids are running around naked, fuckin' in the bushes
Kids are running around naked, fuckin' in the bushes
Kids are running around naked, fuckin' in the bushes
Kids are running around naked, fuckin' in the bushes

I love it! Room for everybody here
Yes, all are welcome
Yes indeed, I love them
Fun! Nice! Life! Youths! Beautiful!
I'm all for it

I love it! Room for everybody here
Yes, all are welcome
Yes indeed, I love them
Fun! Nice! Life! Youths! Beautiful!
I'm all for it
