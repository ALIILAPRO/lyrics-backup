		  Look, huh
I just wanna (Great John on the beat by the way)
Like it's 2055, huh
Huh, huh, huh

I just wanna slide, huh
Parties in the sky like it's 2055, huh
She said, "Boy you nice, boy you nice", huh
Heart cold like some water and some ice (huh)

Why would you sacrifice (huh)
Knowing you could die? Ain't nobody by your side, huh
I know niggas cap (cap) and bitches lie
Came from dirt, can't go back, you could see it in my eyes, huh
Real niggas cry blood (blood), hope my kid never try drugs (huh)
All I wanted was some love, would that trade for a gun (huh)
Big pack on me now, 'member back then I was fucked up, huh
I don't really want friends, everybody fake, I don't got trust, but

I just wanna slide, huh
Parties in the sky like it's 2055, huh
She said, "Boy you nice, boy you nice", huh
Heart cold like some water and some ice (water and some ice)
I just wanna slide, huh
Parties in the sky like it's 2055, huh
She said, "Boy you nice, boy you nice", huh
Heart cold like some water and some ice

I ain't need no one to like me (yeah)
Tryna fuck these demons in my head (in my head)
Tired of bein' in my bag for niggas
Talk 'bout you, then laugh with you
Fuck everybody, I said what I said (yeah)
Tell the haters get off me, come get your nigga, he on me
Eat it up like ravioli
Ridin' the dick like it's stolen, heart so cold it's frozen
I ain't givin' my heart to no one
But I know my niggas, they got me
See my cousin in the casket, yeah, they shot him
Watch how them bitches mad 'cause they not me
But I know my niggas, they got me

I just wanna slide, huh
Parties in the sky like it's 2055, huh
She said, "Boy you nice, boy you nice", huh
Heart cold like some water and some ice (water and some ice)
