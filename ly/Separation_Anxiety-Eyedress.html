		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't know what I'd do
If I didn't have you
I don't know what I want
Sometimes I'm so destructive
I don't know how I'd feel
I probably wouldn't feel shit
I don't know how I'd love
Because you're the only one I want (want)
You're the only one I want (want)
You're the only one I want (want)
Yeah, you're the only one I want
Only one I want

You never lost my trust
You've always been so faithful
I'll never give this up
As long as you're still trying
Even when things aren't good
I'll do my best I'll show you
You always think I could
Without you I'd be no good
Despite the things I've said
It doesn't get to my head
Don't even tell my friends
Because I know we'll fix this
Know we'll fix this
Before we sleep at night
Before we sleep at night
Before we sleep at night, night, night

Ow, uh
Oh yeah
Pow, huh, doot-doot
Yeah, huh
Oh shit, oh shit
Woo, woo, woo
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Woo, woo, woo
What, what, what, what, what, what
