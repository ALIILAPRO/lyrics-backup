		  Man
Too broke to pay attention
Man man, yeah

Man listen, man listen (shh)
All I got is this ambition (that's it)
A couple million make you stand different (hey)
They dropped the ball and so I ran with it
I'm like
Man listen, man listen
All I got is this ambition (yah digg?)
A couple million make you stand different (I am)
They dropped the ball and so I ran with it (look)

The game is friendless
The pain is endless
The game changed I blame these lane pretenders
My friends in Benz's
Parked at the entrance
Inside you still hear the engine like, "wren wren"
This is your ending
If you're offended
I dare you fuckin' bitches defend it
These M's is rushing through my blood like the Kremlin
I'm back with a vengeance and this is what the sound of revenge is
Win, win

Man listen, man listen (shh)
All I got is this ambition (that's it)
A couple million make you stand different (hey)
They dropped the ball and so I ran with it
I'm like
Man listen, man listen
All I got is this ambition (yah digg?)
A couple million make you stand different (I am)
They dropped the ball and so I ran with it (whoo)

Where I come from, you can't visit
I talk money
I guess you understand different
Hand gestures
Countin' this shit 'til my hands blister
You can't miss us
Smoke weed louder than Fran Drescher
Pinky rings, hand kisses, Soprano bitches
I feel like Paulie Castellano in designer stitches (ugh!)
I heard 'em say, I made Rihanna's hit listâ€”bitch, mind ya business
What kind of honor is this?
I'm tryna to see Madonna digits, all kind of riches
In Miami whine and dining wit' the finest bitches, huh!
Everyone actin' kind of vicious
These politicians won't let my brother, Mohammed visit
I'm like

Man listen, man listen (shh)
All I got is this ambition (that's it)
A couple million make you stand different (hey)
They dropped the ball and so I ran with it
I'm like
Man listen, man listen
All I got is this ambition (yah digg?)
A couple million make you stand different (I am)
They dropped the ball and so I ran with it (whoo)

He's a fake balla', globetrotter
Bank account four dollar, no comma
I know you wanna pop collars, pop collars
I know you wanna pop pussy for a shot calla'

Ugh, smokin' (top dolla')
Pull up in that (top dolla')
She got that (top dolla')
Pussy' cost (top dolla')
(Hey!)

Man listen, man listen (shh)
All I got is this ambition (that's it)
A couple million make you stand different (hey)
They dropped the ball and so I ran with it
I'm like
Man listen, man listen
All I got is this ambition (yah digg?)
A couple million make you stand different (I am)
They dropped the ball and so I ran with it (whoo)
