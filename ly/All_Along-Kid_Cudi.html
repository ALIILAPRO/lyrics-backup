		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey
Ma, ma, ma moo.

Hey
Ma, ma, ma moo.

When the days change
So does my attitude
I'm messy at home
I eat a lotta junk food.

When the nights change
So do my nightmares too
I dream reality
Is my dream.

All along
All along
I guess I'm meant to be alone

All along
All along
I guess I'm meant to be alone
Out there on my own.

When the weeks change
The rumors change too, I'm addicted to highs
Would you like to know why?

When the months change
So do my love point of views
I don't want what I need
What I need hates me.
What I need hates me.

I know all along
All along.
I know I'm meant to be alone

It's crazy
But all along,
All along.
I knew I was meant to be alone
Out there on my own, yeah.

Suppose him out the lying order, fell to end
Who would be the villain?
All the strangers, voting for him.

Suppose him out the lying order, fell to smile
Who will be the villain?
All the strangers, voting for him.

All along
All along.
I guess I'm meant to be alone.

All along
All along.
I guess I'm meant to be alone
Out there on my own, yeah.
