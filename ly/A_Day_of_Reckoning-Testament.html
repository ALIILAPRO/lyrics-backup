		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  First there came a mass
Brilliant lights of flash
All across the president's skies
As he sits and laughs

He preaches non-conformity
I don't think they see
They live for him and what he believes
A wrath of misery

Left to die alone
In their living past
As he takes their lives away
To never get it back

No more need for society
All the lives he took
The fault of law and majority
Rules in an open book

Leave me alone
Don't take it away
A place where I know
They're destined to take away

Now the lives they lead
Are left to broken dreams
Just when they thought
They had it all

Life's not what it seems
He preaches non-conformity
I don't think they see
They live for him and what he believes
A life of misery

Leave me alone
Don't take it away
A place where I know
They're destined to take away

Don't take away
Society
Day by day - There'll come a day
Day by day - You're gonna pay

Day by day a day of reckoning
Day by day a day of reckoning

You're all gonna pay

You can't get away
