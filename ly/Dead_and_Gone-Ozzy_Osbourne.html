		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A circus of madmen running the show
Where are we heading, nobody knows
Too much confusion, with no end in sight
A prison of promise polluting our minds, oh no

My heart's beating, buried alive
Open my eyes, my soul won't survive
Dead and gone
My heart's beating, everyone cried
Said their goodbyes, covered in lies
Dead and gone

The future is bankrupt, with no change to spare
The city's on fire, a family affair
You call it destruction, but you hold the knife
The people's induction, the people's demise, oh no

My heart's beating, buried alive
Open my eyes, my soul won't survive
Dead and gone
My heart's beating, everyone cried
Said their goodbyes, covered in lies
Dead and gone, so gone

Hungry as vultures craving the thrown
Posing for pictures, then eating your own
Raising our voices, feed the machine
They're coming to save us, but watching us bleed, oh no

My heart's beating, buried alive
Open my eyes, my soul won't survive
Dead and gone
My heart's beating, everyone cried
Said their goodbyes, covered in lies
Dead and gone
Dead and gone forever, baby
Dead and gone forever
Dead and gone
Dead and gone forever, baby
Dead and gone forever
Dead and gone, so gone
