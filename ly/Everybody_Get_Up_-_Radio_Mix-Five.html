		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everybody get up singing 
1, 2, 3, 4, Five will make you get down now 
1, 2, 3, 4, Five will make you get down now 

You gots to keep it real 
You gots to keep it raw 
I'm lyrically blessed 
So don't try to ignore 
Time for some action 
Creeping up your back and 
Keep the beat nasty 
Like Janet my reaction 
Hard I'm addictive 
Better lock your kids in 
Coming to you area 
Ya don't know what you're missing 
Go tell your family 
Here comes the enemy 
Blowing up the spot tech remedy

Everybody get up singing 
1, 2, 3, 4, Five will make you get down now 
1, 2, 3, 4, Five will make you get down now 

Keep it moving on 
Keep it moving on 
Keep it moving on 
Keep it moving on 
Keep it moving on 
Keep it moving on 
Keep it moving on 

I'll be the resident, president 
I'm the 5th element 
Jimmy fly snooka stone 
Cold is how I'm 
Hittin' em' better get together 
Put your hands in the sky 
Stick em up punk 
Hit em low, hit em high 
Now I'm the bad boy 
That you invite for dinners 
Ain't got no manners 
'cause I eat with my fingers 
Lost boys terrorize the neighbourhood 
And hounds of the Baskerville will be up to no good 
So come on, come on 
Everybody keep checking us 
Coming with the funk 
Bring it on wickedness

Everybody get up singing 
1, 2, 3, 4, Five will make you get down now 
1, 2, 3, 4, Five will make you get down now 

Everybody better recognize 
We got the funky rhymes 
Keep it together, baby 
Don't even try to organize 
We be the roughnecks 
No concept, no business 
We here to get down 
And make em grab your biscuits 
So everybody, anybody, somebody 
Put your hands together 
Represent like John Gotti
Paragraph after grammar for gas 
The party's Armageddon
Hit em with the heavy class
I'm bugging 
Hitting with the hooligan bamn 
I know I wanna stand-up 
So baby jump!

Everybody get up singing 
Five will make you get down now 
Everybody get up singing 
1, 2, 3, 4, Five will make you get down now 
1, 2, 3, 4, Five will make you get down now 

Everybody get up singing 
1, 2, 3, 4, Five will make you get down now 
1, 2, 3, 4, Five will make you get down now 

Five will make you get down
