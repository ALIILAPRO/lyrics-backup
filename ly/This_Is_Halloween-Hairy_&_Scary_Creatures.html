		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Boys and girls of every age
Wouldn't you like to see something strange
Come with us and you will see,
This our town of Halloween
This is Halloween, this is Halloween,
Pumpkins scream in the dead of night
This is Halloween, everybody make a scene,
Trick or treat till the neighbours come and die of fright
It's our town, everybody scream,
In this town of Halloween
I am the one hiding under your bed,
Teeth ground sharp and eyes glowing red
I am the one hiding under your stairs,
Fingers like snakes and spiders in my hair
This is Halloween, this is Halloween, Halloween, Halloween, Halloween, Halloween
In this town we call home,
Everyone hail to the pumpkin song
In this town, don't we love it now,
Everybody's waiting for the next surprise
Round that corner, then,
Hiding in the trash cans,
Something's waiting now to pounce and how you'll..
Scream, this is Halloween,
Red and black and slimy green,
Aren't you scared?
Well, that's just fine,
Say it once, say it twice,
Take a chance and roll the dice,
Ride with the moon in the dead of night
Everybody scream, everybody scream,
In our town or Halloween
I am the clown with the tear-away face,
Here in a flash and gone without a trace
I am the who when you call "Who's there?",
I am the wind blowing through your hair
I am the shadow on the moon at night,
Filling your dreams to the brim with fright
This is Halloween, this is Halloween, Halloween, Halloween, Halloween, Halloween
Tender lumplings everywhere,
Life's no fun without a good scare,
That's our job but we're not mean
In our town of Halloween
In this town, don't we love it now,
Everyone's waiting for the next surprise
Skeleton Jack might catch you in the back
And scream like a banshee,
Make you jump out of your skin!
This is Halloween, everybody scream,
Won't you please make way for a very special guy
Our man Jack is king of the pumpkin patch,
Everyone hail to the pumpkin king
Now, this is Halloween, this is Halloween, Halloween, Halloween, Halloween, Halloween
In this town we call home everyone hail to the pumpkin song
La la la la la, etc, etc...
