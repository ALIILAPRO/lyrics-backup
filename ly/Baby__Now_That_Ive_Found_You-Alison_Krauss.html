		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby, now that I've found you
I won't let you go
I build my world around you
I need you so, baby even though
You don't need me now

Baby, now that I've found you
I won't let you go
I build my world around you
I need you so, baby even though
You don't need me
You don't need me no no (mm)

Baby, baby, when first we met
I knew in this heart of mine
That you were someone I couldn't forget
I said right and abide my time

Spent my life looking for that somebody
To make me feel like you
Now you tell me that you want to leave me
But darling, I just can't let you

Baby, baby, when first we met
I knew in this heart of mine
That you were someone I couldn't forget
I said right and abide my time

Spent my life looking for that somebody
To make me feel like you
Now you tell me that you want to leave me
But darling, I just can't let you

Now that I found you
I build my world around you
I need you so, baby even though
You don't need me now

Baby, now that I've found you
I won't let you go
I build my world around you
I need you so, baby even though
You don't need me, you don't need me no no
(mm mm mm)
