		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A humming choir
Full of longing lost cries
You know they call for you
Call for you

Never seen somebody run so fast
Touched down in the base of ya
Never seen somebody aim this high
gonna fly right through the goddamn sky
And They follow you follow you around
Til' you swallow them swallow them down

Blue devils hang around a warm gun
Can't slow down til' you lost it all
Blue devils hang around the empty ones

Sweet lies Keep you up at night
Who's gonna comfort you Come for you
When you swallow them swallow them down
When They follow you follow you around

No such thing as home for the ones who run
Blue devils hang around a warm gun
Can't slow down til' you lost it all
Blue devils hang around the empty ones

Never seen somebody run so fast
Touched down in the base of ya
Never seen somebody aim this high
gonna fly right through the goddamn sky

No such thing as home for the ones who run
Blue devils hang around a warm gun
Can't slow down til' you lost it all
Blue devils hang around the empty ones
