		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sometimes I feel like nobody cares
When I'm sitting alone on the hallway stairs
I need a friend, a love, a life to fit in
But I am too weak to get out of my skin

I was down on my knees and I never felt release 
From the pain that is hiding so deep inside
I have fought my heart, so full of delusion
But now I see it clearly right in front of my eyes

Woah oh oh, you're not alone
Kill your idols, together we are standing strong
Woah oh oh, we're not alone
Kill your idols, together we are strong

Tonight we're breaking down these walls
Though you never believed us
Tonight we learn to live again 
And we never let you down

I will never back down, now it's my time to sin
I'll make you eat the dirt that you put me in
I was a coward to not stand up for myself. 
I got a beaten in the face first when I was twelve

And now I have more than I ever had before 
'Cause I Just stand up and I make it mine
The fear of always being rejected 
It turned out to be just a ghost in my head

Woah oh oh, you're not alone
Kill your idols, together we are standing strong
Woah oh oh, we're not alone
Kill your idols, together we are strong

Tonight we're breaking down these walls
Though you never believed us
Tonight we learn to live again 
And we never let you down

I'm not a fucking misfit in your perfect world
I just wanna break out as long as I can
I wanna break out, you never let me in
I'll never back down on the way to myself
Never back down

Just let met go
I wanna be part of the fun
I got 99 talents but you ain't see one
I need a chance to show you what I've got
I just wanna be me 'cause I'll die if I'm not

Woah oh oh, you're not alone
Kill your idols, together we are standing strong
Woah oh oh, we're not alone
Kill your idols, together we are strong

Tonight we're breaking down these walls
Though you never believed us
Tonight we learn to live again 
And we never let you down
