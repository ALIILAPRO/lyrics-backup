		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hi, this is Maneskin y'all, are you ready?
Skibily bon, bon, bon, yeah

I am walking down my road
I'm sleeping without a bed
I am not changing my clothes
For my friends I'm a stranger
I won't slow down, down, down
I won't slow down, down, down, yeah
I'm naif but I'll grow up
I will change my mind and then
I think in nine years or ten
I'll become a wiser man
I won't slow down, down, down
I won't slow down, down, down, yeah

So you can follow me
Until they catch me and kill me out
It's my recovery
And we will forget of the clouds
'Cause there's no hitch
No baby, there's no fence
No baby, there's no set-back that will stop me
So you can follow me
Until they catch me, they catch me and kill me out, out, out, out

'Cause I am a poor man
And I cannot read your mind
Baby, I can't see what you think
'Cause my eyes are blind
And I feel the wind
Is coming from the sea
But the birds still fly, I've got a secret to keep
Yes, I feel the wind
Is coming from the sea
Yeah, but the birds still fly, I've got a secret to shot

So you can follow me
Until they catch me and kill me out
It's my recovery
And we will forget of the clouds
'Cause there's no hitch
No baby, there's no fence
No baby, there's no set-back that will stop me
So you can follow me
Until they catch me, they catch me and kill me out, out, out, out, yeah

'Cause baby you're the ache
That comes right into my vein
You're like a super crystal drug
That takes away all my pain
You're a soldier but you'll never wear you armor again
Now you found freedom but now
Tell me who knows your name
Because I know how does it feels
To feel like you're reflected
From the mirror of the shame
And you feel like you're the last man
And you feel like you're suspected of a murder that you've never done
Now you found freedom but your freedom is just like a
Bomb bi de bomb bomb, bi de bomb bomb
Bomb bi de bomb bomb, bi de bomb bomb, yeah
Bomb bi de bomb bomb, bi de bomb bomb
Bomb bi de bomb bomb, ish-drr
Bomb bi de bomb bomb, bi de bomb bomb
Bi de bomb, bi de bomb bomb, bi de bomb bomb
Bomb bi de bomb bomb, bi de bomb bomb
Bi de bomb, bi de bomb bomb bomb

So you can follow me
Until they catch me and kill me out
It's my recovery
And we will forget of the clouds
'Cause there's no hitch
No baby, there's no fence
No baby, there's no set-back that will stop me
So you can follow me
Until they catch me, they catch me and kill me out, out, out, out
