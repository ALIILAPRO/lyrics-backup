		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't take anymore
I have no more wings
I can't take anymore
The gates of heaven sealed

Don't you hear me
Don't you hear me
Don't you fear me
Of never coming back
Do you know what it's like
When heaven's hung in black

I can't take anymore
Our walls are black and bleed
I can't take anymore
No rooms here for your screams

Don't you hear me
Don't you hear me
Don't you fear me
Of never coming back
Oh, no more tears please
Hanging heaven black

No don't you leave me to die
Don't you leave me to die
Don't you leave me to die
No don't you leave me to die

And you'll know what it's like
The wailing wall of sighs
Hanging heaven black
And you'll know what it's like
When paradise is blind
When heaven's hung in black

Time - How can you say
That I've no time
Am I blind - now you say that
Heaven's blind, yeah
Across the bridge of sighs, blind, time, time

Oh lord, don't you leave me to die
No, don't you leave me to die
Don't you leave me to die
No lord, don't you leave me to die

And you'll know what it's like
The wailing wall of sighs
Hanging heaven black
And you'll know what it's like
When paradise is blind
Painting heaven black
Across the bridge of sighs
Your losing heaven's light
Heavens hung in black
