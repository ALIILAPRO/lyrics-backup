		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Come on baby put your lips on mine
You and I got nothin' but time
I know a spot just down the road
Where the sweet red wine and the love and the river flows
Put your pretty little feet up on my dash
Baby just like that
And don't look back

I can't stop wondering why you're with me
And why you looked my way
Tell me what I did just to turn your head
To get to wake up with you every day
You know a good love is hard to find
Guess you get lucky sometimes

Girl you light it up when you walk in a room
Ain't no doubt all eyes are on you
No I can't blame them when they stare
Cause you look so good when you let down your hair
Knowing I'm the one that's gonna take you home
Really turns me on
And we've got all night long

I can't stop wondering why you're with me
And why you looked my way
Tell me what I did just to turn your head
To get to wake up with you every day
You know a good love is hard to find
Guess you get lucky sometimes

Well I can't stop wondering why you're with me
And why you looked my way
Tell me what I did just to turn your head
To get to wake up with you every day
You know a good love is hard to find

One like yours and mine
Guess you get lucky sometimes
Guess you get lucky sometimes
Get lucky sometimes
Get lucky sometimes
