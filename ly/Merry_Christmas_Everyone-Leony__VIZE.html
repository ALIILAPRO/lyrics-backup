		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Ooh)
Snow is fallin'
All around me
Children playin'
Having fun
It's the season of love and understanding
Merry Christmas everyone

Time for parties
And celebrations
People dancin'
All night long
Time for presents
And exchanging kisses
Time for singing Christmas songs

We're gonna have a party tonight
I'm gonna find a girl
Underneath the mistletoe
We'll kiss by candle light

Room is swaying
Records playing
All the songs we love to hear
Oh, I wish that
Everyday was Christmas
What a nice way
To spend the year

(Snow is fallin')
(All around me)
(Children playin')
(Having fun)
(It's the season of love and understanding)
(Merry Christmas everyone)

Room is swaying
Records playing
All the songs we love to hear
Oh, I wish that
Everyday was Christmas
What a nice way
To spend the year

Snow is fallin'
All around me
Children playin'
Having fun
It's the season of love and understanding
Merry Christmas everyone
