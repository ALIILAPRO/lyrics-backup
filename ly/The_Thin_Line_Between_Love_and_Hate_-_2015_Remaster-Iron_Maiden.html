		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When a person turns to wrong
Is it a want to be, belong?
Part of things at any cost
At what price a life is lost?
At what point do we begin?
Fighter spirit a will to win
But what makes a man decide 
Take the wrong or righteous road

There's a thin line between love and hate
Wider divide that you can see between good and bad
There's a grey place between black and white
But everyone does have the right 
To choose the path that he takes

We all like to put the blame on society these days
But what kind of good or bad a new generation brings
Sometimes take just more than that 
To survive, be good at heart
There is evil in some of us 
No matter what will never change

I will hope, my soul will fly 
So I will live forever
Heart will die, my soul will fly 
And I will live forever

Just a few small tears between someone happy and one sad
Just a thin line drawn between being a genius or insane
At what age begin to learn of which way out we will turn?
There's a long and winding road and the trail is there to burn

There's a thin line between love and hate
Wider divide that you can see between good and bad
There's a grey place between black and white
But everyone does have the right 
To choose the path that he takes

I will hope, my soul will fly 
So I will live forever
Heart will die, my soul will fly 
And I will live forever

I will hope, my soul will fly 
So I will live forever
Heart will die, my soul will fly 
And I will live forever

The thin line between love and hate

The thin line between love and hate
