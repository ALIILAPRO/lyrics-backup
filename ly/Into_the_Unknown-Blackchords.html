		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I see this life
Through the eyes of others
And on, on this night
I will bide my time

And move
With these eyes
Live a life untouched by time
And I'll be waiting in the wings
I'll be here when you arrive

On your final days, they will come
Like a child you'll walk into the unknown
On your final days, when they come
Like a child you'll walk into the unknown

And when you cross
The line
Live a life untouched by time
On this rock
It's only just a glitch
And this state is only just a blink

And I see this life
Through the eyes of others
