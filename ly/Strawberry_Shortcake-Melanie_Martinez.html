		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Feeling unsure of my naked body
Stand back, watch it taking shape
Wondering why I don't look like Barbie
They say boys like girls with a tiny waist
Now, my mama's preaching to make sure I'm pure
But, I never really cared about that shit before
Look around the room to whoever wants me

Got boys acting like they ain't seen skin before
Got sent home to change 'cause my skirt is too short

It's my fault, it's my fault 'cause I put icing on top
Now, the boys want a taste of the strawberry shortcake
That's my bad, that's my bad, no one taught them not to grab
Now, the boys want a taste of the strawberry shortcake

Gotta make sure that my legs are shiny
Hot wax melting, burn my skin
People all around me watching closely
'Cause it's how I look and not what I think

Mikey's eyes seem to be glued to her chest
So, I'm stuffing my bra so that mine look the best

It's my fault, it's my fault 'cause I put icing on top
Now, the boys want a taste of the strawberry shortcake
That's my bad, that's my bad, no one taught them not to grab
Now, the boys want a taste of the strawberry shortcake

Instead of making me feel bad for the body I got
Just teach him to keep it in his pants and tell him to stop

Sayin' it's my fault, it's my fault 'cause I put icing on top
Now, the boys want a taste of the strawberry shortcake
That's my bad, that's my bad, no one taught them not to grab
Now, the boys want a taste of the strawberry shortcake
