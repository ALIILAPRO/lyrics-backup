		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, 'cause I'm living right now nigga (I don't shit)
Yeah, yeah, I don't trust nobody, nigga (feel me?)
Yeah, almighty don't like nobody, copy? Yeah (yeah)
Got so much ice in the face when I look at my watch, man, it's war time
Got so much pimp in my blood I ain't never gon' be on a ho time
Cookin' dope with the AP wrist rocky, it's blow time
(Artz, what's poppin' my G?)
(B-B-Bugy)

Got that shit in my system, don't know if I'm ever gon' shake it
I got a lust for this murder shit, pop out and burn that bitch
Put on front page of the paper (woo)
Stackin' that shit since a youngin', I chop up a onion
I made my first pay on a pager (woo)
You could send one or get done
If I cut it to fuck up a beat with that funk in the bass (funk in the bass)
Dull nigga flyin' bitches to Mexico
Ho was bougie, knock a bitch off her pedestal (yeah, yeah)
Fuck her friend and let her know you ain't special ho (yeah, yeah)
When I take a trip then I take an extra ho (yeah, yeah)
They was fuckin', I was gone off an edible
You can keep your nigga, I never question you (woo)
Buy my whole collection, you a collectible (woo)
Bust it open, let me see you get naked ho (woo)
Body bangin', new Pilates and stretches ho
Pescatarian, all the fish and the vegetables
Be his pussy while you pushin' the Jetta, ho (yeah, yeah)
Forty-two more nights I'd like to refresh a ho (yeah)
She ain't fuckin', suckin' it, ain't no pressure ho (yeah, yeah)
With the number when I send you the check (yeah)
So pimps get the most and you get the lesser ho (you get the lesser ho, yeah)

Got so much ice in the face when I look at my watch, man, it's war time (war time)
Got so much pimp in my blood I ain't never gon' be on a ho time (nah)
Cookin' dope with the AP wrist rocky, it's blow time (skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
Jackers got 'em for the package, he fumbled that brick at the goal line (yeah)
Got so much ice in the face when I look at my watch, man, it's war time (war time)
Got so much pimp in my blood I ain't never gon' be on a ho time (nah)
Cookin' dope with the AP wrist rocky, it's blow time (blow time)
Jackers got 'em for the package, he fumbled that brick at the goal line

Got that shit in my system, don't think that I'm ever gon' shake it
Demons inside of me stressing me
Think I need therapy
Save me I'm 'bout to go crazy (yeah)
I used to do twenty-six for the two and a split
Makin' niggas go half on a baby
Three baby mamas, these bitches can't keep me
I told 'em that coca forever my lady (forever my lady, yeah)
Every day I fuck a new bitch
Got the loyal rap, R&B hoes
I just fucked the Channel 7 news bitch
Got a white bitch selling white shit
Getting cougar pussy on a cruise ship (yeah)
Holdin' hands, nah, we ain't cool, bitch
TMZ'll put me on the news clip
Whippin' hard and spalshin' with the water
I'ma transporter, took a few trips
Nigga I don't pillow talk around the ho
She got loose pussy, she got loose lips
I've been whippin' hard and spalshin' with the water
I'ma transporter, took a few trips
Nigga I don't pillow talk around the ho
Will put you on the Channel 7 news, bitch
Yeah, yeah, bang

Got so much ice in the face when I look at my watch, man, it's war time (war time)
Got so much pimp in my blood I ain't never gon' be on a ho time (nah)
Cookin' dope with the AP wrist rocky, it's blow time (skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
Jackers got 'em for the package, he fumbled that brick at the goal line (yeah)
Got so much ice in the face when I look at my watch, man, it's war time (war time)
Got so much pimp in my blood I ain't never gon' be on a ho time (nah)
Cookin' dope with the AP wrist rocky, it's blow time (blow time)
Jackers got 'em for the package, he fumbled that brick at the goal line

Bitch, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Shut the fuck up, bitch
