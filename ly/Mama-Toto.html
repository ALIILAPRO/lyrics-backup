		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't love you anymore
Money's
Got me crawlin' on the floor

Lover
I'm so ashamed that I must go
Funny
Somehow I thought by now you'd know

[Chorus]
Girl you'd better take my hand
And say what you mean to say
(And she said)
"Stay as long as you can
But don't wait till you're thrown away."

Mama
Please throw me out in the cold
Woman
The love you bought was never sold

[Chorus]

Mama
I don't love you anymore
Sorry
I'm not the boy you're looking for

(See the girl with they eyes on fire
Now he know she's the one he desires)
