		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All these fuckin' demons
In my head
Are they only gonna leave me
When I'm dead
All these fuckin' demons
In my head
Are they only gonna leave me
When I'm dead
Scared of every step I take
Scared of all the things I make
All I - All I need is a break
Every emotion I have is fake
I build them up in my head
Like four hours before
I leave to fucking store
I can't keep it up anymore
Wanna be free of my thoughts
Free of my faults
Free of the salt in my wounds
Wanna be free of the shit that hurt me 10 years ago
Shit I just wanna be free
Free of the Demons
In My head
Are they only gonna leave me when I'm dead
All these fuckin' demons
In my head
Are they only gonna leave me
When I'm dead
All these fuckin' demons
In my head
Are they only gonna leave me
When I'm dead
Dead
When I'm dead
All these demons leave me when I'm dead
When I'm dead
Only gonna leave me when I'm dead
