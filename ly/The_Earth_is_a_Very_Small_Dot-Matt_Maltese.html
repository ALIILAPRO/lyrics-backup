		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sometimes, I catch you crying
Enough to water all the flowers in England
But take a look at the filthy sky
Remember, we're practically nothing

Yesterday, the sea looked too big
Today it's very nice to look at it
And you said you wished the old world didn't end
Forget so quick, that it was also shit then

And sometimes I remember
The Earth's a very small dot
And if you look from far away enough
You can barely make it out

The rain clouds shaped like smiles
Are the same clouds that back up my files
And I will not be trying acid
'Cause I'm much, much, much too scared of it

And sometimes I remember
The Earth's a very small dot
And if you look from far away enough
You can barely make it out

Oh, sometimes I remember
We're not that big after all
And if you look from far away enough
The Earth's a very small dot
It's a very small dot
