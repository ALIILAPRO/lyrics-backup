		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Look, ayo
Trust no one, the soul of a battle-scarred shogun
Plotting new stick ups with an old gun
Inhale the weed smoke, deep in both lungs
My destiny's to hold funds, the dough comes and goes, make sure you hold sumn'
Step into the darkside, it's far from wholesome
I made a large pie out of whole crumb, then multiplied it (flipped it)
Took advantage of everything that they don't acknowledge (word)
Some niggas got all the game but they won't apply it (stupid)
Didn't go to college, I chose the road in the cold asylums
Saw the coldest violence, sold plenty dope cut with a broken promise (uh huh)
Smoking potent scum, young and wilding, on the low for momma
Po-po behind us, next stop is the island
I'm solid

Fire in my eye, yeah, pistol in my side, yeah
Money on my mind, yeah, tryna front? I'll slide, yeah
Love, lust, envy and the hate, it's the vibes to survive
Do or die, yeah, in NY, I'm solid
Fire in my eye, yeah, pistol in my side, yeah
Money on my mind, yeah, tryna front? I'll slide, yeah
Love, lust, envy and the hate, it's the vibes to survive
Do or die, yeah, in NY

Deadass, I been riding iron horses dreaming of buying Porsches
Daily eyeing shit that'd prolly make you nauseous
Portions 'cause I did 'em, been through a lot, rise and falls
Seen a baller start using rock and sell his Gucci watch
From the suburbs to the slum kerb, done dirt
I lock and change from one gun burst, need all of my funds first
Pocket full of filthy cash, see dirt all over my palm
Heard I got a couple offsprings but I don't know they mom
Neck blown from golden charms or bombs or whatever dope
Hip-Hop is dead, you hear my music through the stethoscope
I run the town, these other niggas is clowns and spectacle
The bar high beyond they reach, will they grab it? I'm skeptical
My energy is charged, I split anything electrical
All those who oppose I execute

Fire in my eye, yeah, pistol in my side, yeah
Money on my mind, yeah, tryna front? I'll slide, yeah
Love, lust, envy and the hate, it's the vibes, to survive
Do or die, yeah, in NY, I'm solid
Fire in my eye, yeah, pistol on my side, yeah
Money on my mind, yeah, tryna front? I'll slide, yeah
Love, lust, envy and the hate, it's the vibes to survive
Do or die, yeah, in NY
