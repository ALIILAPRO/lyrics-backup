		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't fight back, don't look at me like that
Don't forget I'll never quite forgive you
But I'll pretend to
Don't fight fair, and don't you cut your hair
Don't you make the same mistakes your father did
You are not him

Well, it's always back to you again
Always back to you, my friend
You keep me on the run
I never learned to lose a fight
I never learned to grow up right
Well this is who we are
And how will I release you now?
How can I forgive myself when I'm still in love with you?
And it's always back to you again
Always back to you, my friend
You keep me on the run

Oh, baby, you're so famous but you sold out your soul
You went and let it all go on a melody
Some kind of tragedy
So quit your job, come sleep in my bed
We'll get by on our roses and our elegies
Things we could never see

Well, it's always back to you again
Always back to you, my friend
You keep me on the run
I never learned to lose a fight
I never learned to grow up right
Well this is who we are
And how will I release you now?
How can I forgive myself when I'm still in love with you?
And it's always back to you again
Always back to you, my friend
You keep me on the run
Well it's always back to you again
Always back to you, my friend
Now look at what we've done
