		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're not alone
Together we stand
I'll be by your side
You know I'll take your hand
When it gets cold

And it feels like the end
There's no place to go
You know I won't give in (ah)
No, I won't give in (ah)

Keep holding on
'Cause you know we'll make it through
We'll make it through
Just stay strong
'Cause you know I'm here for you
I'm here for you
There's nothing you could say (nothing you could say)
Nothing you could do (nothing you could do)
There's no other way when it comes to the truth
So keep holding on
'Cause you know we'll make it through
We'll make it through

So far away
I wish you were here
Before it's too late
This could all disappear

Before the doors close
And it comes to an end
With you by my side, I will fight and defend (ah)
I'll fight and defend (ah)
Yeah, yeah

Keep holding on
'Cause you know we'll make it through
We'll make it through
Just stay strong
'Cause you know I'm here for you
I'm here for you
There's nothing you could say (nothing you could say)
Nothing you could do (nothing you could do)
There's no other way when it comes to the truth
So keep holding on
'Cause you know we'll make it through
We'll make it through

Hear me when I say, when I say I believe
That nothing's gonna change
Nothing's gonna change destiny
Whatever's meant to be will work out perfectly
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

La da da da
La da da da
La da da da da da da da da

Keep holding on
'Cause you know we'll make it through
We'll make it through
Just stay strong
'Cause you know I'm here for you
I'm here for you
There's nothing you could say (nothing you could say)
Nothing you could do (nothing you could do)
There's no other way when it comes to the truth
So keep holding on
'Cause you know we'll make it through
We'll make it through (ah, ah)

Keep holding on (ah, ah)

Keep holding on 

There's nothing you could say (nothing you could say)
Nothing you could do (nothing you could do)
There's no other way when it comes to the truth
So keep holding on
'Cause you know we'll make it through
We'll make it through
