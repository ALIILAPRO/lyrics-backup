		  Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah

I'ma make you feel like it's your special day
I'm about to decorate, let's celebrate
I won't hesitate, do anything you say
Mmm (anything you say)
It's okay, it's your day, it's your way
Happy pink birthday
Happy pink birthday
Happy pink birthday

Uh 
It's your party, you can do what you want to
Got the champagne, got your favorite blunts too
Do the six-nine 'fore we do the one-two
On call and fuck me like you want to
Vanilla ice cream comin' down my ass cheeks
Decent, throw it back, make it clap cheeks
He like the way I smell, PF2
He bend me up, pre-etzel
I let him have his cake and I let him eat it too
He might jack and yell, let him beat it too
Pink birthday card, this from me to you
(Hey)
Lowkey 'cause we just that ill now
Ain't never had a ill bitch 'til now
Post a pic, got him jackin' like Jill now
Break the internet at will now

I'ma make you feel like it's your special day (like it's your special day)
I'm about to decorate, let's celebrate (celebrate)
I won't hesitate, do anything you say (say)
Mmm (anything you say)
It's okay, it's your day, it's your way
Happy pink birthday
Happy pink birthday
Happy pink birthday
