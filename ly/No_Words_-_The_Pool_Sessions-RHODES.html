		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh, ooh, ooh

I tried to call you because I had a vivid dream
About the way that all of our love used to be
You know that moment between wake and between sleep
When it all still feels so real, but then you see

You see the light come crashing through the curtains
Where we used to sleep
On all the empty space you leave
To show me what this could have been

No words, no words
No words could ever bring you back to me

I dream of a place that we still meet
In the corner of some bar on a quiet street
There's a stranger with flowers for someone sweet
That I saw and I thought of you and me
And the crowded sound doesn't bother me
As the bell rings out, you hold onto me
But the birds sing loud, and it's waking me
As I reach for you

I see the light come crashing through the curtains
Where we used to sleep
On all the empty space you leave
To show me what this could have been

No words, no words
No words could ever bring you back to me

No words
We're so hurt
No words could ever bring you back to me

If I was honest I would say (ooh)
That I don't want it this way
And if I could only see your face

No words, no words
No words could ever bring you back to me

No words
We're so hurt
No words could ever bring you back to me

No words, no words
No words could ever bring you back to me
