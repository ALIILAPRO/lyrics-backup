		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let's give it a shot (shot)
You and I on the court (court)
Time ticking on the clock (clock)
Baby, I'mma try to score (score)
'Cause you the hottest on the block (block)
Nothin' dimmin' your light (light)
But all the options that you got (got) 
Wouldn't ever treat you right, no
I don't need a telescope to see that you're the one
But I do need your time, and if ain't yours, I'd rather have none
I don't need a fortune teller to tell me my fortune
I have a million signs that my fortune just begun

You got me jumping like
Boom shakalaka, boom shakalaka, boom
Boom shakalaka, boom shakalaka, boom
Boom shaka, boom shake, ooh
Wanna hold you down (yeah)
Boom shakalaka, boom shakalaka, boom
Boom shakalaka, boom shakalaka, boom
Boom shakala, boom shakala, ooh
Wanna hold you down

I said, back at it again with the jumpshot
I'm aiming for you and I won't stop
Back at it again with the jumpshot
We could lock it down, never unlock
I said, back at it again with the jumpshot
I'm aiming for you and I won't stop
Back at it again with the jumpshot

We could lock it down only if we give it a shot (shot)
You and I on the court (court)
Time ticking on the clock (clock)
Baby, I'mma try to score (score)
'Cause you the hottest on the block 
Nothin' dimmin' your light
But all the options that you got 
Wouldn't ever treat you right, oh oh
I don't need a telescope to see that you're the one
But I do need your time, and if ain't yours, I'd rather have none (ooh yeah)
I don't need a fortune teller to tell me my fortune
I have a million signs that my fortune just begun

You got me jumping like
Boom shakalaka, boom shakalaka, boom
Boom shakalaka, boom shakalaka, boom
Boom shaka, boom shake, ooh
Wanna hold you down (oh no!)
Boom shakalaka, boom shakalaka, boom
Boom shakalaka, boom shakalaka, boom
Boom shakala, boom shakala, ooh
Wanna hold you down

I said, back at it again with the jumpshot
I'm aiming for you and I won't stop
Back at it again with the jumpshot
We could lock it down, never unlock
I said, back at it again with the jumpshot
I'm aiming for you and I won't stop
Back at it again with the jumpshot
We could lock down, never unlock

Jumping into something, I don't really know what to expect
But outta your team, you're the MVP and you'll never be less
And baby, the past was nothing but practice, now I'm set
When you give me access, I'll just sew my heart into your chest

You got me jumping like
Boom shakalaka, boom shakalaka, boom
Boom shakalaka, boom shakalaka, boom
Boom shaka, boom shake, ooh
Wanna hold you down
Boom shakalaka, boom shakalaka, boom
Boom shakalaka, boom shakalaka, boom
Boom shakala, boom shakala, ooh
Wanna hold you down
