		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  On a cobweb afternoon in a room full of emptiness
By a freeway, I confess I was lost in the pages
Of a book full of death, reading how we'll die alone
And if we're good, we'll lay to rest anywhere we want to go

In your house, I long to be
Room by room, patiently
I'll wait for you there like a stone
I'll wait for you there alone

And on my deathbed, I will pray to the gods and the angels
To the pagans or anyone who will take me to heaven
To a place I recall, I was th–µre so long ago
The sky was bruised, the wine was bled, and there you led me on

In your house, I long to be
Room by room, patiently
I'll wait for you there, like a stone
I'll wait for you there, alone, alone

And on I read, until the day was gone
And I sat in regret of all the things I've done
For all that I've blessed, and all that I've wronged
In dreams until my death, I will wander on

In your house, I long to be
Room by room, patiently
I'll wait for you there, like a stone
I'll wait for you there, alone, alone
