		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I spent like a year and a half on the Greyhound bus
On the way to see this girl
Take a flight back just to keep my job
Used to fly standby, late to the airport
Where the buddy pass? Stuck in the traffic
Whole lotta hours, real long distance
But I've grown since then
Learned to be on my own since then
Marble floor in my brand new crib
This the life that I wanted still
Got a hole and it burn my chest
Mash the chip that's still in my shoulder
Ain't a day that I still been sober
These the things that I'm tripping over (Y'all motherfuckers made 3 albums)

Still talking about the same shit
The one gay, the one selling drugs
The one that's tryna act like Lil Wayne
What the fuck is this shit man?
Y'all better turn this shit off when y'all get in the whip
When y'all enter my whip y'all better not play this shit
'Cause this can go right the fuck off

Now them boys hooked on heroin
Parents always asking like, "Where y'all get it from?"
Rehab poppin' like when Amy had the single out
Single out the reasons how I quit before I fell down
I used to pick Ameer up, talk about what's got us fucked up
We vent 'til the sun up (ay), hopefully get our funds up (ay)
And if I didn't know y'all maybe y'all would have a desk job
Ticking 'till I off myself
Used to drive around for some hours (oh, ohhh)
Used to get paid by the hour (oh, ohhh)
Now I'm just pickin up a check (oh, ohhh)
Now I'm just pickin up a sweat (yeah)
Used to drive around for some hours (oh, ohhh)
Circle round the block for some hours (oh, ohhh)
Now I'm just pickin up a check (oh, ohhh)
Now I'm just pickin up a sweat (yeah)

Be there any minute, I'll be on it in it baby
Be there any minute, I'll be on it in it baby
Be there any minute, I'll be on it in it baby
Be there any minute, I'll be on it in it baby

I spent like a year and a half feeling sorry for myself
'Cause I thought love ain't make sense anymore
If I drank, you would probably see a fifth on the floor
And a hole in the door, rest a few more
Scared of the past I've been tryna avoid from before I was born 
Running from the shoes that my grandfathers wore
Tryna pick a better battle, but I saw I'd win the war
Feel the sun in my pores but I still got clouds in my head, now
Rain for a little bit, stay for a little bit
Moved along with my head, down
That's what momma taught me and I never let them fuck me
When they handed me a dead king's crown
Told 'em think of what you doing before I'm the one you're choosing
I just wanna be a human when I share myself
Hear the things I'm saying and I scare myself, goddamn

Be there any minute, I'll be on it in it baby
Be there any minute, I'll be on it in it baby
Be there any minute, I'll be on it in it baby
Be there any minute, I'll be on it in it baby
Be there any minute, I'll be on it in it baby
Be there any minute, I'll be on it in it baby
Be there any minute, I'll be on it in it baby
Be there any minute, I'll be on it in it baby
