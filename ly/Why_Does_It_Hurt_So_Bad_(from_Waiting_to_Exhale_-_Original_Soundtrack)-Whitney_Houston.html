		  Why does it hurt so bad
Why do I feel so sad
Thought I was over you
But I keep crying
When I don't love you
So why does it hurt so bad
I thought I had let you go
So why does it hurt me so
I gotta get you outta my head
It hurts so bad
Oh it hurts so bad baby

My life's been better
Since the day I left you boy
I must admit life's been kind to me
I went and did the things I said I would boy
I found someone who loves me for me
Haven't had much drama since the day that we split boy
My heart's never been more at ease
And when I think of all the things you put me through
Leaving you has been the best thing for me

So why does it hurt so bad
Why do I feel so sad
I thought I was over you
But I keep crying
When I don't love you
So why does it hurt so bad
Baby I thought I had let you go
So why does it hurt me so
I gotta get you outta my head
Hurts me so bad
Hurts so (yeah you do)
Hurts so (hurts me so)
Hurts so bad (did you know)
Hurts so (that it hurts me so)
Hurts so (so bad, hey hoh)

Never again, that's what I said to myself
I never want to feel kind of pain again boy
Just when I think it's over
Just when I think it's through
I find myself right back in love with you

So why does it hurt so bad oh baby
Why do I feel so sad
(Thought I thought I) Thought I was over you
I keep crying
When I don't love you (when I really don't love you boy)
(Oh no oh no oh no oh no it hurts so bad, oh tell me)
So why does it hurt so bad
I thought I had let you go (thought I could let you go)
You could
Gotta get you outta my head
Boy you hurt me so bad
Hurts so (yeah you do)
Hurts so (hurt me so)
Hurts so bad (hurts so)
Hurts so (sure you did)
Hurts so (make me want to make me want to shoop shoop)
Hurts so bad (hurt me so, gotta shoop now)
Hurts so bad (Hurts me so)
Oh why, you hurt me so bad
Bad (how 'bout that?)
