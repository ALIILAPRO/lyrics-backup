		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm not ready to get over you
Over you
Over you
'Cuz pain's the only thing that's left from you
Left from you
Left from you

And even though I'm 'bout to lose myself
I'm just not ready yet to lose you too (ready yet to lose you too)
'Cuz I will rather keep on going through hell
If hell is where I can be close to you

I keep on holding on to all the pieces
Reminding me of you and me
It's been countless hours, a hundred weeks and
I'm stuck in quicksand, you're all that I see (all that I see)
No-, no-, no- nobody knows me better than you
But since you left, I kinda feel like my life's stuck in a loop
(A, a, a) A hundred weeks and I'm stuck in quicksand
You're all that I see
I keep on holding on

People ask me if I'm better now
Better now
Better now
But I'll be honest I just don't know how
Don't know how
Don't know how

And even though I'm 'bout to lose myself
I'm just not ready yet to lose you too (ready yet to lose you too)
'Cuz I will rather keep on going through hell
If hell is where I can be close to you

I keep on holding on to all the pieces
Reminding me of you and me
It's been countless hours, a hundred weeks and
I'm stuck in quicksand, you're all that I see

I keep on holding on to all the pieces
Reminding me of you and me
It's been countless hours, a hundred weeks and
I'm stuck in quicksand, you're all that I see (all that I see)
No-, no-, no- nobody knows me better than you
But since you left, I kinda feel like my life's stuck in a loop
(A, a, a) A hundred weeks and I'm stuck in quicksand
You're all that I see (You're all that I see, yeah)
