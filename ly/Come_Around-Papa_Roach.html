		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In between a rock and a hard place
Tryna find your way through the dark days
But you don't know how
You flip the world upside down
And right now, you don't wanna show it
'Cause you don't think that anyone will notice
Until you tell someone
You'll feel like you're the only one

And everybody says they're fine
But I know we're not alright
Everybody says they're fine
But I know we're not alright

I know we're not alright
It's always darkest just before the light
I know your silence is a deadly sound
It's never easy when you're breaking down
But I'll be there when you come around
(When you come around)

Face down in the days that we wasted
Tryna find our way through the mazes
We can wait this out
Or walk through that fire somehow
You tryna put together all the pieces
When you should turn around now and leave 'em
'Cause you can lose your mind
Trying to live back in time

And everybody says they're fine
But I know we're not alright
Everybody says they're fine
But I know we're not alright

I know we're not alright
It's always darkest just before the light
I know your silence is a deadly sound
It's never easy when you're breaking down
But I'll be there when you come around
When you come around, yeah

I know we're not alright
It's always darkest just before the light
I know your silence is a deadly sound
It's never easy when you're breaking down
But I'll be there when you come around
When you come around

When you come around (when you come around)
