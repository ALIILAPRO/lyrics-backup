		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Watched you, leave me, here without a sound,
Left my life here laying on the ground,
The nights we lost to firefights,
My white flag, 
Waving,
Just say it's a mistake
Praying I don't waste away
Cause without you
I'm empty

Yeah I deserve a 21 gun salute
For giving my life for you
For suffering fatal wounds 
on your orders
Waiting for my 21 gun salute
For giving my heart to you
For following through and through
Like a soldier
Yeah I deserve a 21 gun salute

Put me in your crosshairs shot me down
Smiled as you watched me bleeding out
The times I tried to make it right
Wasted
You hate me
Just take the pain away
You promised me our love was safe,
You broke me
You broke me

Yeah I deserve a 21 gun salute
For giving my life for you
For suffering fatal wounds 
on your orders
Waiting for my 21 gun salute
For giving my heart to you
For following through and through
Like a soldier
Yeah I deserve a 21 gun salute

Holding hope
Wont let go
broken soul left to roam
Seeing ghosts
Breathing smoke
These ashes once were a home 

Holding hope
Wont let go
broken soul left to roam
Seeing ghosts
Breathing smoke
These ashes once were a home 

Holding hope
Wont let go
broken soul left to roam
Seeing ghosts
Breathing smoke
These ashes once were a home 

Holding hope
Wont let go
broken soul left to roam
Seeing ghosts
Breathing smoke

I deserve a 21 gun salute
For giving my life for you
For suffering fatal wounds 
on your orders
Waiting for my 21 gun salute
For giving my heart to you
For following through and through
Like a soldier
Yeah I deserve a 21 gun salute
