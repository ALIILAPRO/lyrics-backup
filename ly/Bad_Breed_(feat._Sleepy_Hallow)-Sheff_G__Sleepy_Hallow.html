		  (Great John on the beat by the way)
Hmm, hmm, hmm, huh

I can't fall in love, please don't ask me, huh (please don't ask me)
Run it up and never change, don't feel bad for me, huh
I can turn a good day into a bad week, huh
Girl you ain't innocent, you was a bad breed, huh
You was a bad breed

I stay flexin' (I stay flexin') 
Look, she think I'm her sugar daddy, huh
I stay flexin'
She like none of these hoes can have me 
Brin' them checks in
I get money, don't need compassion
You don't listen you learn you're lesson
Off a Perc' I don't feel the pressure
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, look
Demons callin' my name
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, look
Music sootherin' the pain
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, look
Movin' like God changed or some'
You improvin' what you sayin', huh, huh
Man I'on't really think I changed at all
Started seein' people colors for true
Do me wrong ain't do no wrongin' to you
I was down, you was up like a roof, huh, look
Never hated just had somethin' to prove
Got her loose, she give me neck like a noose
Tied you down and now I'm cuttin' you loose, yeah
Act like love is a bad thing
Feelin' moody, am I trippin' or should I just let out the bad pain?
They act like love is a bad thing, look (mmm)
Feelin' moody, am I trippin' or should I just-

I can't fall in love, please don't ask me, huh (please don't ask me)
Run it up and never change, don't feel bad for me, huh
I can turn a good day into a bad week, huh
Girl you ain't innocent, you was a bad breed, huh
You was a bad breed

It ain't even that deep
Heart cold, shit freezin'
Like Narco we eatin'
I'm bad so she a demon
No cap, huh
You ain't even want to talk to me
I was out here with no jack, huh
Niggas ain't want to start with us
We was pullin' up in all black
Say it ain't facts, huh
We fuckin' she lay on her back
Say that she love me she's gettin' attached
But I can't love her, that's a wrap, look
I can't love her that's a, no, no, huh
I can't love her, no, ain't doin' that no mo'
I can't fall in love no mo'
Fuck it up and get a bag
I think she want me 'cause of the shit I have, huh
I've been dwellin' on the past
Countin' cash, I might give you a bag
If you was to slip I was there for your catch
But you let me fall on my back
But I ain't bitch, I just ran up some racks (I just ran up some racks)

I can't fall in love, please don't ask me, huh (please don't ask me)
Run it up and never change, don't feel bad for me, huh
I can turn a good day into a bad week, huh
Girl you ain't innocent, you was a bad breed, huh
You was a bad breed
