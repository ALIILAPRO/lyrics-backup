		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everything and nothing matters now, with you
Hold your hair back if you feel unwell, do you?
Every night's the mark of a new day
and every day's the mark of something new
Promise that you'll follow me
This wasn't meant for me and you

So hold on tight to everything you love
Honestly it's all I care about
Hold on tight to everything you love
Honestly it's all I'm thinking of
Hold on tight to everything you care about
Hopelessly it's all I dream about
Hold on tight cause this might be the last time we dance

Didn't say you couldn't do it well
Only said perhaps to try again
I could never stop from listening in
And someone's left the car engine running
Every night's the mark of a new day
And everyday's the mark of something new
Promise that you'll follow me
I couldn't stand to be alone

And it could wait
Wait for the after show
I've got four more so why you bawling for?
I've got to hold back to then
And I couldn't have never swam better
But you could've turned the blind eye
But I've gone over the road
And I'm gonna go this time

So hold on tight to everything you love
Honestly its all I care about
Hold on tight to everything you love
Honestly its all I'm thinking of
Hold on tight to everything you care about
Hopelessly it's all I dream about
Hold on tight cause this might be the last time we dance here
