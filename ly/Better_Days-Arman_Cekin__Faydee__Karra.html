		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Run away, run away, yeah
Take your time to say a prayer
Recognize pain when you see it
Don't be cruel, open up your heart and say

Ho-ho-ho-hold on, there will be better days
It'll be a better day

God, oh god, please help me
I need someone that can guide me
The right way, the right way
I don't need you to judge me
I just need someone to love me
The right way
We dream, we hope, we pray for better days
We dream, we hope, we pray for better days

Let it rain, let it rain
Every storm followed by a brighter day
Recognize love when you see it
Only you can open up your heart and say

Ho-ho-ho-hold on, there will be better days
There will be better days

God, oh god, please help me
I need someone that can guide me
The right way, the right way
I don't need you to judge me
I just need someone to love me
The right way
We dream, we hope, we pray for better days
We dream, we hope, we pray for better days
We dream, we hope, we pray for better days
Better days (Better days)
Better days (Oh, better days)
Better days (Oh, better days)
We dream, we hope, we pray for better days
Oh, better days (Oh, better days)
Oh, better days (Oh, better days)
We dream, we hope, we pray for better days
We dream, we hope, we pray for better days
We dream, we hope, we pray for better days

Better days
Oh, better days
