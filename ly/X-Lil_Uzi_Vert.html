		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yo, yo Pi'erre you wanna come out here?
Metro!
I love you
I don't want you

I don't know what's next, yeah
I don't want my ex, no
Break up with a text
I'm not tryna flex
Girl, you know the rest (bye, bye hoe)
Bitch, I write a check
Watch me with a chick
Take off in a jet
So I just never stress

I could never stress
Yeah, my life's a mess
But I'm also blessed
My heart's in the junkyard 'cause it's wrecked
And today's not feeling like it used to
You got stuck up in that life that you was used to
If you got hurt, yeah, I got hurt, yeah, I got bruised, too
That's the main reason why I had to choose you
If you got options, I got options, baby, who you?
I got one that's on my line that look like new new
She got ass just like a zebra on a zoo, too
So basically what I'm saying, I'm not scared to lose you

I don't want my ex (aye)
Break up with a text
I'm not tryna flex (what, what)
Girl, you know the rest (bye, bye hoe)
Bitch, I write a check
Watch me with a chick
Take off in a jet
So I just never stress

Leonardo DiCaprio
Watch out, boys, I might bag your hoe
Love so strong that shit had me gone
Getting cash, too, I was all alone
Swag on them by mistake
I cannot believe that I made this shit from a mixtape
Bitch, you know I'm flooded
You know my mama wrist straight
Grandma don't like diamonds
She say, "Make sure that my rent's paid," yeah
And I make sure that your rent's paid
Make you live your own life when you hung out with Lindsay
I don't want you never ever running in a frenzy
But that's just some shit that everybody's friends say

I don't know what's next, yeah
I don't want my ex, no
Break up with a text
I'm not tryna flex (what, what)
Girl, you know the rest (bye bye, hoe)
Bitch, I write a check
Watch me with a chick
Take off in a jet
So I just never stress

Watch out boys, I might bag your hoe
