		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The devil came back
He's dancing in your path
So you're acting like you need me now, hey
So tell me if I'm mad
There's something in your laugh
That makes me fear the way you smile, hey

It's hard to believe sometimes
We can pretend we're normal people
And I can repeat those times
We can pretend we're boring people
And it's hard to believe sometimes
We can pretend we're normal people
And I can repeat those times
And I can repeat those times, yeah

New planet, yeah, we planted
Everything we wanted
Your fragrance, covalence
I'm bound to, I'm bound to you
The longer that we hide
Everything starts to hit me harder, hit me harder
But we're safe on the inside
Yeah, I know we're fine

The devil came back
He's dancing in your path
So you're acting like you need me now, hey
So tell me if I'm mad
There's something in your laugh
That makes me fear the way you smile, hey

It's hard to believe sometimes
We can pretend we're normal people
And I can repeat those times
We can pretend we're boring people
And it's hard to believe sometimes
We can pretend we're normal people
And I can repeat those times (those times)
And I can repeat those times, yeah (those times)
