		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let me tell you 'bout my life
Let me tell you 'bout my dreams
Let me tell you 'bout the things that happened
Always real to me

Let me tell you of my hope
Of my need to reach the sky
Let me take you on an awkward journey
Let me tell you why

Let me tell you why

Why should these curses be laid upon me?
I won't be forgiven 'til I can break free
What did I do to deserve all this guilt?
To pay for my sins for the sale of my soul
Demons are trapped, all inside of my head
My hopes have gone, reach for Heaven from Hell

My sins are many 
My guilt is too heavy
The pressure of knowing 
Of having what I know
I'm able to see things 
Things I don't want to see
The lives of a thousand souls 
Weighing down on me

I know they're crying for help, reaching out
The burden of them will take me down as well
The sin of a thousand souls, not died in vain
Reincarnates to let me live again

Someone to save me
Something to save me from myself
To bring salvation
To exorcise this hell

Someone to save me
Something to save me from myself
To bring salvation
To exorcise this hell

Someone to save me
Something to save me from my hell
I taste damnation
Awake from this nightmare
Someone to save me
Something to save me from myself
To bring salvation
To exorcise this hell
