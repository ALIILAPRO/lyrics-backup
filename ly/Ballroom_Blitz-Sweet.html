		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Are you ready Steve? Uh-huh
Andy? Yeah
Mick? Okay
Alright fellas, let's go

Oh it's been getting so hard
Living with the things you do to me, uh huh
My dreams are getting so strange
I'd like to tell you everything I see

Oh, I see a man at the back as a matter of fact
His eyes are as red as the sun
And the girl in the corner let no one ignore her
'Cause she thinks she's the passionate one

Oh yeah, it was like lightning
Everybody was frightening
And the music was soothing
And they all started grooving

Yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
And the man in the back said everyone attack
And it turned into a ballroom blitz
And the girl in the corner said boy I want to warn you
It'll turn into a ballroom blitz
Ballroom blitz, ballroom blitz
Ballroom blitz, ballroom blitz

I'm reaching out for something
Touching nothing's all I ever do
Oh I softly call you over
When you appear there's nothing left of you, uh huh

And the man in the back is ready to crack
As he raises his hands to the sky
And the girl in the corner is everyone's mourner
She could kill you with a wink of her eye

Oh yeah it was electric
So perfectly hectic
And the band started leaving
'Cause they all stopped breathing

Yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah
And the man in the back said everyone attack
And it turned into a ballroom blitz
And the girl in the corner said boy I want to warn you
It'll turn into a ballroom blitz
Ballroom blitz

Oh yeah, it was like lightning
Everybody was frightening
And the music was soothing
And they all started grooving

Yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
And the man in the back said everyone attack
And it turned into a ballroom blitz
And the girl in the corner said boy I want to warn you
It'll turn into a ballroom blitz
Ballroom blitz, ballroom blitz
Ballroom blitz, ballroom blitz

It's it's a ballroom blitz
It's it's a ballroom blitz
It's it's a ballroom blitz
Yeah, it's a ballroom blitz
