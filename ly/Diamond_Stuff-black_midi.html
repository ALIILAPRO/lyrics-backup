		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And only when
The sun is ours
Didn't take long to find out 
I'm a, I'm a husk
Made up of diamonds and stuff

I don't seem to bleed this time
This time

Hair slicked back to a black slick
The red river pulls me up to scratch an itch
On an anthracite field I am laid out
And a diamond drill takes my feet off

Hair slicked back to a black slick
The red river pulls me up to scratch an itch
On an anthracite field I am laid out
And a diamond drill takes my feet off

(Hair slicked back to a black slick)
(The red river pulls me up to scratch an itch)
(On an anthracite field I am laid out)
(And a diamond drill takes my feet off)
