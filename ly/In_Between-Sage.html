		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I remember when we used to stay up all night long?We would never've thought weâ€™d be in the wrong?Spending hours never really doing anything?We could hear each other without a word

Is there no other feeling in between??Is there no other feeling in between?

I've always been wondering how we could change so fast?Did it really happen in the past??Once you told me there was nothing better than a friend?I would easily believe in a friend

Is there no other feeling in between??Is there no other feeling in between?

Now I have to clear myself in front of everyone?But I'm not really sure about what I've done?It seems like you're trying to choose between love & hate?While I keep asking to myself

Is there no other feeling in between??Is there no other feeling in between?
