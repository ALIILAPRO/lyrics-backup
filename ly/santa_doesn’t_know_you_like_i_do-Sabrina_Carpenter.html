		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Santa doesn't know you like I do
I've been there through the good and bad
Know how to make you laugh
Kiss all your tears away, babe
Ooh, only I can do that (oh)

Why don't you just come over? (Oh)
You've been actin' so cold (so cold)
No, I don't want nothin' crazy
Just wanna get you alone (alone)
And all of this snow is fallin' (ooh)
I can make you fall too (fall too)
So, tell me what's on your wish list
I wanna make it come true (uh-uh)

Santa doesn't know you like I do
I've been there through the good and bad
Know how to make you laugh
Kiss all your tears away, babe
Oh, only I can do that (oh)
Santa doesn't know you like I do
I know all of your favorite songs
Pick up each time you call
So why can't I be the one
To give you everything you want?

I just want you to tell me that you feel the same
I don't think I'm gonna make it through the winter, babe
Well, don't you wanna wrap me up?
In mistletoe, under the tree?
He won't bring you somebody that loves you more than me, yeah

Santa (mm) doesn't know you like I do (doesn't know you like I do)
I've been there through the good and bad
Know how to make you laugh
Kiss all your tears away, babe
Oh, only I can do that (ah-ah)
Santa (Santa) doesn't know you like I do (doesn't know you like I do)
I know all of your favorite songs
Pick up each time you call
So why can't I be the one
To give you everything you want?

You gonna leave me all alone? On Christmas?
Baby, what'd I ever do to deserve all that?
Can't we just, like, snuggle underneath the tree? By the fireplace?
You know I make those cookies you like

Santa doesn't know you like I do
Well, maybe this Christmas time
You'll finally realize that I could be the one
To give you everything you want
