		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, I've heard things
Goin' 'round and 'round running through this town
Like a two lane
Yeah, I heard 'em say
I never loved you
Found someone new, gave up too soon
But that's half the truth
One point of view

You can be the hero, I can take the fall
If that's how your story goes, say it's all my fault
Whatever helps you sleep at night
Yeah, you can make me the bad guy
Make 'em all believe it
If that's how you're feeling
I can be the villain
Whoa, whoa, whoa

It didn't have to be
The way you made me play the part, the enemy
But they'll start to see
That that ain't me

You can be the hero, I can take the fall
If that's how your story goes, say it's all my fault
Whatever helps you sleep at night
Yeah, you can make me the bad guy
Make 'em all believe it
If that's how you're feeling
I can be the villain
Whoa, whoa, whoa
I can be the villain
Whoa, whoa, whoa

What they don't know is I tried to make
Us work it out, but I couldn't save us
I couldn't save us

You can be the hero, I can take the fall
If that's how your story goes, say it's all my fault
Whatever helps you sleep at night
Yeah, you can make me the bad guy
Make 'em all believe it
If that's how you're feeling
You can be the hero, I can take the fall
If that's how your story goes, say it's all my fault
Whatever helps you sleep at night
Yeah, you can make me the bad guy
Make 'em all believe it
If that's how you're feeling
I can be the villain
Whoa, whoa, whoa
I can be the villain
Whoa, whoa, whoa

I can be the villain
