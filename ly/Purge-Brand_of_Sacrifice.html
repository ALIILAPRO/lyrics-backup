		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My demons take shape, like a symphony from the eternal bound
Through a kaleidoscope of shadows, an escape is found
Liquid illusions upon my jaded mind
There is a spiritual refuge where the truth is hard to find

Amidst the shattered fragments of my restless soul
Drowning in the sorrows where melodies console
Come on

The poison drips like ink, staining my veins, and I chase its melody
Longing to break the chains
A stroke of disarray colours my fragile state

Concealing the torment within
Bleeding hymns echo my inner strife
An agonizing harmony that's tearing at my life
(At my life)
At my life

Beneath the breath of chaos, serenity unfolds
I'm purging out the toxins, trying to break the mould
Is this where it ends? Or where it all begins?
I seek redemption's gaze, but the road seems endless

In the corridor of dreams, I will find my inner peace
Resonating echoes of hope, my demons release
With every note that resonates, I reclaim my control
This is a song of survival, to mend my fractured soul

Now my demons take shape, like a symphony from the eternal bound
Through a kaleidoscope of shadows, an escape is found
Liquid illusions upon my jaded mind
There is a spiritual refuge where the truth is hard to find

Beneath the breath of chaos, serenity unfolds
I'm purging out the toxins, trying to break the mould
Is this where it ends? Or where it all begins?
I seek redemption's gaze, but the road seems endless

Is this where it ends? Or where it all begins?
Seeking redemption, a renewed perception
Is this where it ends? Or where it all begins?
I'm trusting in myself, but the road seems endless

Fuck

Whispers of potential echoes through my veins
(The echo)
(The echo)
Yet, fear's grip, it tightens
(Tightening)
Binding me with its chains
(Its chains)
(Its chains)
Its chains

Is this where it ends, or where it all begins?
I'm purging out the fucking toxins, so I can break the mold

Between the breath of chaos, serenity unfolds
I'm purging out the toxins, trying to break the mold

Purging out the toxins
Trying to break the mold
Is this where it ends?
(Where it ends?)
Or where it all begins?
