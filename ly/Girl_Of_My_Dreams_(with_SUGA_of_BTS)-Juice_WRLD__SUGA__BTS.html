		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You gotta stay here for this
I love you

The girl of my dreams, but I ain't fallin' asleep
Think both of your legs gone, the way you fallin' for me
The same way that the rain falls
I ain't gon' lie, you got it all, all, all, all, all of me

Uh, loves all of you
Like I'm John Legend or somethin', better save some room
For my heart, it's a big one, I'ma give it to you
Ain't no better mood than you, really helped me find my groove
Fake hoes come in by the pool, real ones, there's barely a few
But, somehow I found you, harmony when I'm around you
Paradise when I'm around you (I'm around you)
These feelings brand new (feelings brand new)
Lean, don't fall, need your, need your all
A million miles, you would walk for me
All four oceans, you would cross for me
Stop sippin' purple potion (for you, babe)
For you (babe), keep it true, babe
If I ever try to leave, you'll be stalkin' me
Won't let any other woman come and talk to me
I'd do the same thing if you leave, honestly
Or I would take your life away

Ah, ah
Ah, ah
Ah, ah

The girl of my dreams, but I ain't fallin' asleep
Think both of your legs gone, the way you fallin' for me
The same way that the rain falls
I ain't gon' lie, you got it all, all, all, all, all of me
The girl of my dreams, but I ain't fallin' asleep
Think both of your legs gone, the way you fallin' for me
The same way that the rain falls
I ain't gon' lie, you got it all, all, all, all, all of me

(All of me)
Yeah, all of me (all of me)
Yeah, all of me (all of me)
Yeah, all of me (all of me)
Yeah, yeah (슈가)

사랑의 다른 이름은 파란색
그저 싱그럽다가도 어쩔 땐 차갑네
항상 사랑은 외로움을 동반해
함께 있음에도 외롭게 마찬가지
Ooh-whoa
I don't need it anymore
어쩔 땐 미친놈처럼 많이 웃기도, yeah
또 많이 울기도, yeah
그 또한 나였음에 너에게 감사해 나 이렇게
많이 싸우기도 했지?
당근이 아닌 채찍
너무 극단적인 케미
다 지나가버린 햇빛
사랑을 끝맺음에 
그게 사랑이었음을 깨닫고 끝이나네

The girl of my dreams, but I ain't fallin' asleep
Think both of your legs gone, the way you fallin' for me
The same way that the rain falls
I ain't gon' lie, you got it all, all, all, all, all of me
The girl of my dreams, but I ain't fallin' asleep
Think both of your legs gone, the way you fallin' for me
The same way that the rain falls
I ain't gon' lie, you got it all, all, all, all, all of me

The girl of my dreams, but I ain't fallin' asleep
Think both of your legs gone, the way you fallin' for me
The same way that the rain falls
I ain't gon' lie, you got it all, all, all, all, all of me
