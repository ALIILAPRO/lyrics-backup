		  Biggie Smalls is the illest (uh)
What? Uh
Biggie-Biggie-Biggie Smalls is the illest
Uh
Biggie Smalls, Biggie-Biggie-Biggie Smalls
Biggie-Biggie-Biggie Smalls is the illest
Uh, yeah
Biggie-Biggie-Biggie Smalls is the illest

Live from Bedford-Stuyvesant, the livest one
Representin' BK to the fullest
Gats I pull it, bastards duckin' when B.I.G. be buckin'
Chickenheads be cluckin' in my bathroom fuckin'
It ain't nothin', they know B.I.G. be handlin'
With the MAC in the Ac' door panelin'
Bandagin' MC's, oxygen they can't breathe
Mad tricks up the sleeve, wear boxers so my dick can breathe
Breeze through in the Q, .45 by my side, lyrical high
And those that rushes my clutches get put on crutches
Get smoked like Dutches from the master
Hate to blast you, but I have to, you see I smoke a lot
Your life is played out like Kwame, and them fuckin' polka dots
Who rock the spot? Biggie
You know how the weed go, unbelievable

It's unbelievable
Biggie Smalls is the illest
It's unbelievable (uh)
Biggie-Biggie-Biggie Smalls is the illest (uh, yeah)
It's unbelievable
Biggie-Biggie-Biggie Smalls is the illest (what? What? Uh)
It's unbelievable
Biggie-Biggie-Biggie Smalls is the illest

B-I-G, G-I-E, AKA, B.I.G.
Get it? Biggie
Also known as the bon appétit
Rappers can't sleep need sleepin' 
B.I.G. keep creepin'
Bullets heat-seekin', casualties need treatin'
Dumb rappers need teachin'
Lesson A, don't fuck with B-I 
That's that, "Oh I, thought he was wack" 
Oh come, come now, why y'all so dumb now? 
Hunt me or be hunted
I got three hundred and fifty-seven ways
To simmer sauté, I'm the winner all day
Lights get dimmer down Biggie's hallway
My forte causes Caucasians to say, "He sounds demented" 
Car weed scented
If I said it, I meant it
Bite my tongue for no one
Call me evil, or unbelievable

It's unbelievable
Biggie Smalls is the illest
It's unbelievable 
Biggie-Biggie-Biggie Smalls is the illest (uh)
It's unbelievable (what? Uh)
Biggie Smalls is the illest (uh)
It's unbelievable
Biggie-Biggie-Biggie Smalls is the illest

Buckshots out the sun roof of Lexus coupes
Leave no witnesses, what you think this is?
Ain't no amateurs here, I damage and tear
Mc's fear me, they too near not to hear me
Clearly, I'm the triple beam dream
One thousand grams of uncut to the gut
It seems fucked up, the way I touched up the grill
Tryin' to play gorilla, when you ain't no killer
The gat's by your liver, your upper lip quiver
Get ready to die, tell God I said hi
And throw down some ice, for the nicest MC
Niggas know the steelo, unbelievable

It's unbelievable
Biggie Smalls is the illest
It's unbelievable 
Biggie-Biggie-Biggie Smalls is the illest 
It's unbelievable
Biggie-Biggie-Biggie Smalls is the illest 
It's unbelievable
Biggie-Biggie-Biggie Smalls is the illest

It's unbelievable
Biggie-Biggie-Biggie Smalls is the illest
'Believable 
Biggie-Biggie-Biggie Smalls is the illest 
'Believable
Biggie-Biggie-Biggie Smalls is the illest
'Believable
Biggie Smalls-Biggie-Biggie-Biggie Smalls
Biggie-Biggie-Biggie Smalls is the illest
