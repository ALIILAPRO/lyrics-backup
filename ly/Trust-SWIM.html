		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Caught up in my ways
Through the motions, got me running late
Know I needed change in my life
But I still want you all the same (Needed change in my life)
Caught up in my ways, and I know that
I'd been getting used to being alone
Never thought of you in my zone
But you're the only real one I know (Only real one I know)
Thinking about the time that I wasted
Said that I was fine, I was waiting
For someone to come along that could save me
(For someone to come along)
But it's you (You)
Yeah, it's you who's still got love for me, yeah, it's you
Yeah, it's you who's still got trust in me, yeah
Yeah, it's you who's still got love for me, yeah, it's you
Yeah, it's you who's still got trust in me
Show me love, show me patience
You know our light is never fading
Give me the high that I've been chasing
(Give me the high that I've been chasing)
Every single time that we're together
Yeah, you know it only gets better (Woah)
Yeah, you know, yeah, you know, yeah, you know
(Oh yeah, you know)
Thinking about the time that I wasted
Said that I was fine, I was waiting (Waiting)
I was on my own, feeling vacant
But it's you
Yeah, it's you who's still got love for me, yeah, it's you
Yeah, it's you who's still got trust in me
But it's you (Yeah, you trust)
Yeah, it's you who's still got love for me, yeah, it's you
(Yeah, you trust in me)
Yeah, it's you who's still got trust in me
(You)
Yeah, it's you who's still got love for me, yeah, it's you
Yeah, it's you who's still got trust in me (Yeah, you trust in me)
Yeah, it's you who's still got love for me, yeah, it's you
Yeah, it's you who's still got trust in me
(Oh yeah, you know)
(Time that I wasted)
(Oh yeah, you know)
(Yeah, it's you who's still got love for me)
(Time that I wasted)
(You who's still got love for me)
