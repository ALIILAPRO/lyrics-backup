		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Always wanted to be like you 
Pretty perfect never confused 
I’ll crack the jokes 
I’ll make you smile 
But underneath it 
I’m the problem child 

The oldest ones 
they make the rules 
Set me up just to play the fool 
They look at me like 
Danger in a cage 
Picture in a frame 
I’m never gonna change 

We know you’re the favorite 
That ego gets inflated 
I feel so damn wasted 
Try hard but I’m so jaded 
We know you’re the favorite 
That ego gets inflated 
I feel so damn wasted 
Try hard but I’m so jaded 

Jaded 
I’m so jaded 

You get jealous 
And I get confused 
Clean cut, happy, 
and never abused 
Live for other people 
You try so hard 
Is that why you get so 
Angry at the bar? 

The youngest one 
She hated school 
Couldn’t leave the house 
Cause the world got cruel 
They look at me like 
everything has changed 
Paper to a plane 
I’ll always be the same 

Always be the same 

We know you’re the favorite 
That ego gets inflated 
I feel so damn wasted 
Try hard but I’m so jaded 
We know you’re the favorite 
That ego gets inflated 
I feel so damn wasted 
Try hard but I’m so jaded 

And I’m forever just
the problem child 
And I’m forever just 
the problem child 

You don’t think that regret 
Taking the attention 
Needing all the help 

You don’t think that regret 
Taking the attention 
Needing all the help 

You don’t think that regret 
Taking the attention 
Needing all the help 

You don’t think that regret 
Taking the attention 
Needing all the help
