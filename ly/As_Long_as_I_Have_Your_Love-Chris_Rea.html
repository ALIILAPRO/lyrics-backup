		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The word you send today 
From somewhere far away
Cut in deep to the bone
Though I am not with you now
I feel you close somehow 
Too many days, so far from home
And I send my dream to you 
And I will go on
As long as I have your love

I see your candle burn,
You wait for my return 
I feel your shadow in the night 
The question still remains, oh love its still the same 
Oh I'll get by,
Don't you know I'll be alright
As long as I have your love
