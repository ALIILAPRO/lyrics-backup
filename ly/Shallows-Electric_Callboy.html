		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All the feelings lock me out
Don't want to feel it again and again
I can hear the voices loud
Cannot forget the scars remain

Lie
I never saw myself so clear

So why do you
Chasten me
Test me
Again?
So many words
But nothing left to say

Feels like I'm lost in the shallows
All my life I was doomed to fail
Since I have escaped from the gallows
I carry my cross through the valley of faith
Why am I attracted to failure
I don't wanna carry the weight
Why does it hurt so bad
To forgive myself
To never forget

I want it all, I want it all
I want it all to disappear
With every single step you take
The past will guide the way
I want it all, I want it all
I want the pages to be clear
And when I wrote my chapters new
There's nothing left to say
Nothing left to say
Nothing left to say

And I keep moving on and on
To forget, just to bury my past
Never paused, never thought that I was wrong
No remorse till the bitter end
Why am I attracted to failure?
I don't wanna carry the weight
Why does it hurt so bad
To forgive myself
To never forget?

I want it all, I want it all
I want it all to disappear
With every single step you take
The past will guide the way
I want it all, I want it all
I want the pages to be clear
And when I wrote my chapters new
There's nothing left to say
Nothing left to say

I want it all to disappear
I want it all to disappear
I want it all to disappear
I want it all to disappear
I want it all to disappear

I won't ever take it
I can feel the change
Deep inside of myself
No

I want it all, I want it all
I want it all to disappear
With every single step you take
The past will guide the way
I want it all, I want it all
I want the pages to be clear
And when I wrote my chapters new
There's nothing left to say
