		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Maybe it's the way that
You make me wanna lay back
If I can put the blame on the state of my mind
Wasn't supposed to stay I can't say that I tried
There's something in the water
That makes me wanna want ya
If I can put the blame on the weight of my mind
Open up a case and I'm already blind

Oh I'm way too unpredictable
I can't be held responsible for nothin'
And all my crimes have been committed
Already got me so addicted say I'm bluffin'
There's somethin' in the way you make me

Move oh
There's something in the way you make me move oh
Baby when you love me like you do do
There's somethin' in the way you make me
Somethin' in the way you make me oh

Want you when I'm talkin'
In every conversation
'Cause I can't get the sound of your name off my lips
Said a little more than I'd like to admit
There's something in the water
That makes me love you harder
'Cause you know the longer I play innocent
The less that I wanna resist

Oh I'm way too unpredictable
I can't be held responsible for nothin'
And all my crimes have been committed
Already got me so addicted say I'm bluffin'
There's somethin' in the way you make me

Move oh
There's something in the way you make me move oh
Baby when you love me like you do do
There's somethin' in the way you make me
Somethin' in the way you make me oh
