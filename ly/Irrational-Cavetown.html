		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I put a box in my closet
Full of things that I've loved
Sometimes I can't bear to look at
It 'cause I won't deserve what I find
I tell myself this every single time
'Cause I'm not strong enough
Not strong enough for this yeah

I'll sing until my skin
Starts to feel something
I'll breathe again and again until the
Beat starts to mean something

It's not a lot of fun to think about
Everyone you're lettin' down
A sickness so incredible
You know it's all irrational
You know it's so irrational
You know it's all irrational
You know it's so irrational
You know it's all irrational
You know it's so irrational
You know it's all irrational
You know it's so irrational

Oh, you know it's all irrational
You know it's so irrational
You know you're so irrational
You know it's so irrational
You know it's all irrational
You know it's so irrational
You know it's so irrational
You know it's so irrational
