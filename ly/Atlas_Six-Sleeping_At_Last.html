		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I had the most vivid dream
My feet had left the ground
I was floating to heaven
But I could only look down
My mind was heavy
Running ragged with worst case scenarios
Emergency exit's and the distance below
I woke up so worried that the angels let go

Oh God, I'm so tired of being afraid


What would it feel like
To put this baggage down?
If I'm being honest
I'm not sure I'd know how
I wanna take shelter but I'm ready
Ready to fight and somewhere in the middle I
Feel a little paralyzed
But maybe I'm stronger than I realize

I wanna believe no, I choose to believe
That I was made to become a sanctuary
Fear won't go away but I can keep it at bay
And these invisible walls
Just might keep us safe
With a vigilant heart
I'll push into the dark
And I'll learn to breathe deep
And make peace with the stars
Is it courage or faith to show up every day?
To trust that there will be light
Always waiting behind
Even the darkest of nights
And no matter what?

Somehow we'll be okay don't be afraid
