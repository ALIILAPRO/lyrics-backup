		  Rollin' in my pimpin', ain't no tellin' what I'm finna do (uh)
My beeper just a-beepin', so I'm takin' a risk to drop off two
(Ayy Manny, this joint crank fool)
Keys in my lap, just in case these niggas stangin' (uh)
I'm strapped, bitch don't trip, 'cause I'm equipped with that pistol grip (what)
Rollin' in my pimpin', ain't no tellin' what I'm finna do
My beeper just a-beepin', so I'm takin' a risk to drop off two (huh)
Keys in my lap, just in case these niggas stangin' (yeah)
I'm scrapped, bitch don't trip, 'cause I'm equipped with that pistol grip (cash out)

Used to sip red, now I'm sippin' on Wock' (uh)

I'm on the beach, I got sand on my feet (yeah)
Gun by my arm, shoot when I reach (arm)

Count up my deal and I feel like Bruce Lee (swag)

Run up my bands and I'm off 'til September (cash out)
When you do favors they never remember (what?)

BG hot boy, this that Turk (this that Turk)
Homeboy kilt, look like skirt
Don't get murked, heh (don't get murked)

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Dressed like a Aquemini, gentle guy, no, I ain't femini (what)
Long as I keep my hands sanitized (yeah)
I'ma come clean I just realized with no analyze
Money can't fit in my pocket no more 'cause I'm sample size (sample size)
Shoutouts to Matt, shoutout my guys
Slide off to back, slide off to side (side)
Bought a new drop just to shoot out the top
Just to shoot out the top (uh)

Rollin' in my pimpin', ain't no tellin' what I'm finna do
My beeper just a-beepin' so I'm takin' a risk to drop off two
Keys in my lap, just in case these niggas stangin'
I'm scrapped, bitch don't trip, 'cause I'm equipped with that pistol grip (what?)

Taking the mushrooms, I'm out of my body (mushrooms)

BG hot boy, this that Turk (this that Turk)
Point boy kilt, look like skirt

'Cause I'm equipped with that pistol grip
Pistol grip, pistol grip, pistol grip
