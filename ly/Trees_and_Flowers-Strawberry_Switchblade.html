		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dawn cracks the dark
And it breaks the silence
Of my waking hours
And my heartbeat's licence

For I hate the trees
And I hate the flowers
And I hate the buildings
And the way they tower over me
Can't you see
I get so frightened
No-one else seems frightened
Only me, only me

I can't but see
That the sun has risen
To my window, my world
Of my home sweet prison

For I hate the trees
And I hate the flowers
And I hate the buildings
And the way they tower over me
Can't you see
I get so frightened
No-one else seems frightened
Only me, only me
