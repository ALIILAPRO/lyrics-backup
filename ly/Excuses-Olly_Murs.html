		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been thinking 'bout, thinking 'bout you too much
Lately it's been like you ain't there when we touch
I've tried everything but we keep losing us
Oh I, oh I, guess everything ain't enough
Why can't you just be open and talk to me?
Asking how you feel, then you get up and leave
Talking you and me used to come easily
Oh I, oh I, but right now we hardly speak

So tell me now do you, do you even know what you did to me?
I'm going out of my mind every secret that you're keeping
Oh, why won't you let me in? Oh darling, oh darling, and I
But it's useless every time you pull me back with one kiss
And I'm telling everyone you didn't mean to do this
And we can make it through this, oh darling, oh darling
But I'm just making up excuses

You and I, you and I, been like this way too long
All I know it shouldn't be this hard to hold on
It's hard to be 'round you but I hate it when you're gone
Oh, tell me what's going wrong, yeah

So tell me now do you, do you even know what you did to me?
I'm going out of my mind every secret that you're keeping
Oh why won't you let me in? Oh darling, oh darling, and I
But it's useless every time you pull me back with one kiss
And I'm telling everyone you didn't mean to do it
And we can make it through this, oh darling, oh darling
But I'm just making up excuses

And I could blame myself
But it's your fault as well
We're crying out for help, oh
And I could blame myself
But it's your fault as well
We're crying out, crying out

Saying do you, do you even know what you did to me?
I'm going out of my mind every secret that you're keeping
Oh, why won't you let me in? Oh why won't you let me in, ah?
But it's useless every time you pull me back with one kiss
And I'm telling everyone you didn't mean to do it
And we can make it through this, oh darling, oh darling
I'm just making up excuses

Woah oh oh, woah oh oh
Woah oh oh
And I'm telling everyone you didn't mean to do it
And we can make it through this, oh darling, oh darling
But I'm just making up excuses
