		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All these feelin's in my mind, I can't get it right
Got me talkin' to myself almost every night
I just want to feel a high, not too satisfied
You be stressin' me, you be stressin' me
Wanna fall in, let it go
Let it all out, let you know
All these black clouds, they too close
I just can't hold this in anymore

Every step I take, I tend to take, I take it slowly
Suck at bein' open, these emotions make me OD
Fear of losin' you if I speak up, don't wanna know me
Don't even know me, yeah

I can't even lie, I can't even lie
I don't want to think, all these feelings so dumb
Somethin' on your mind, get it off your mind
Take me to euphoria, euphoria
I can't even lie, I can't even lie
I don't want to think, overthinking's so dumb
Somethin' on your mind, get it off your mind
Take me to euphoria, euphoria
Ooh, oh, ooh, oh
Ooh, oh-oh
Ooh, oh, ooh, oh
Take me to euphoria, euphoria

I don't like pressure like this
Been so long since I felt like this, yeah
If I don't do this now, I might quit
I'm just hella, hella scared of it, yeah
'Cause witch you, baby, I'm an addict to your magic
Ooh, baby, gotta have it, it's a habit
Ooh, take me to your planet, take me into your world

Every step I take, I tend to take, I take it slowly
Suck at bein' open, these emotions make me OD
Fear of losin' you if I speak up, don't wanna know me
Don't even know me, yeah

I can't even lie, I can't even lie (yeah)
I don't want to think, all these feelings so dumb (oh)
Somethin' on your mind, get it off your mind
Take me to euphoria, euphoria (yeah, yeah)
I can't even lie, I can't even lie (I can't)
I don't want to think, overthinking's so dumb
Somethin' on your mind, get it off your mind
Take me to euphoria, euphoria (euphoria)
Ooh, ooh-ooh (take me to your world) (oh, oh-oh, oh)
Ooh, oh, ooh, oh (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Euphoria

(I can't even lie) 
I can't even lie, I can't even lie
I don't want to think, all these feelings so dumb (so dumb)
Somethin' on your mind, get it off your mind (get it off your mind)
Take me to euphoria, euphoria (take me there, baby)
I can't even lie, I can't even lie (I can't even)
I don't want to think, overthinking's so dumb (overthinking's so dumb)
Somethin' on your mind, get it off your mind (get it off your mind)
Take me to euphoria, euphoria (oh-oh)

Ooh, oh, ooh, oh (ooh, won't you take me with you, babe)
Ooh, oh-oh, oh
Ooh, oh, ooh, oh (take me with you)
Ooh, oh-oh, oh
