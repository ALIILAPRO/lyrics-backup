		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It was chapter one
Mother's favorite son
Calling home, let her know that I'm good, I can handle this
But I was just a kid
Drove a piece of shit
When I moved in with two other guys I was working with
When we get off today
We're gonna celebrate
Go to sleep and repeat cause we all got bills to pay
I was 20
I just believed
Big things gonna happen for me
Kind of funny
I'd rather dream
Out there in the middle of the street
Quite an optimist
When I thought of this
I was telling myself it'll all fall into place
When I get out of here
I'll grab a big career
Get a house, a garage, and a yard where the kids can play
But like a tidal wave
On a crystal lake
Couldn't watch, couldn't run so I learned how the heart can break
No feeling bad for me
This ain't a tragedy
Cause it is what it is what it was wasn't meant to be
I was 20
I just believed
Big things gonna happen for me
Kind of funny
I'd rather dream
Out there in the middle of the street
I was 20
I was 20
I was 20
20, 20, 20, 20
I was 20
I was something else
I was someone else
I was 20
I was 20
I was something else
I was someone else
I was something else
I was 20
I just believed
Big things gonna happen for me
Kind of funny
I'd rather dream
Out there in the middle of the street
I was 20
I was something else
I was someone else
I was 20
I was 20
