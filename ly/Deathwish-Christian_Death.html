		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I see the end, and I see the end well it was open so I crawled inside
And someone up ahead was crying, well someone up ahead was dying
Lost in the darkness, lost in today

Well you can only lose it to your mind, you got to lose it to your mind
Waves and waves of tranquility is hard on your innocence
Discarding all that was before, let's crawl inside

La virginal souls devour without shame, we lick our lips clean, so clean
No one outside knows, no one outside knows what it means
To me, to be, set free	

Well you can only lose it to your mind, you got to lose it to your mind
Waves and waves of tranquility is hard on your innocence
Discarding all that was before, let's crawl inside
