		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A vision of you there
Standing tall
By the gate

Everything is new
Stare in-to
What is not
Yet

As your bones grow
And you feel the pain
In exchange

Experiences hang
Run round your mind
And collide

Hang your toes
Over the edge
Cause you can

You can switch your place
Hide in-side
If you try

You'll open up your eyes
And realize
How you fit
In the wild

A lion is a lion
No apologies
And a leash
Is a leech

In a corral
You're safe and warm
Pass it on to
A roo she/ every sheet

Time and time again
You stick your self
To accept
Someone else

Give up the wish
Let go of the dream
Barricade
Fantasy

Burn the dogma
Let the fire
Overtake
The desire
To define

I will find a way
To keep this moment
For myself I will find a way

What's raging
Out of control
Like a wheel
Like a storm
Like a virus
Like an ocean
Like a silence
An emotion
Like a darkness
Like a chance
An idea
Like a verb
Like an outrage
Like a sunrise
Like a monster (Like a mantra)
Like a monster (Like a mantra)
Like a mantra (Like a monster)
Like a mantra (Like a monster)

nothing the same
nothing the same
nothing the same
nothing the same

And all of this
Will never be the same
Again

And all of this
Will never be the same
Again

And all of this
Will never be the same
Again

And all of this
Will never be the same
Again

And all of this
Will never be the same
Again

And all of this
Will never be the same
Again

And all of this
Will never be the same
Again

And all of this
Will never be the same
Again

And all of this
Will never be the same
Again

And all of this
Will never be the same
Again

And all of this
Will never be the same
Again

And all of this
Will never be the same
Again
