		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let your heart see the colors all around you
Let your heart see the colors all around you

And the darkness that you fear will disappear
And the darkness that you fear will disappear
And the darkness that you fear will disappear (I'll be loving you, yes I will)
(I'll be loving you)
And the darkness that you fear will disappear (I'll be loving you, yes I will)
(I'll be loving you)
And the darkness that you fear will disappear (I'll be loving you, yes I will)
(I'll be loving you)
And the darkness that you fear will disappear (I'll be loving you, yes I will)
(I'll be loving you)

Let your heart see the colors
Let your heart see the colors

I'll be loving you, yes I will
I'll be loving you
I'll be loving you, yes I will
I'll be loving you

Let your heart see the colors

And the darkness that you fear will disappear
And the darkness that you fear will disappear

I'll be loving you, yes I will
I'll be loving you
I'll be loving you, yes I will
I'll be loving you

Let your heart see the colors

Let your heart see the colors
