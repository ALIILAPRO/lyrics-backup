		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do you feel it, When you kiss me, That its burning on my lips 
Do you notice, All the moments, When I nearly let it slip
 
Every time I hold you, I get even closer, To letting down my guard again 
I hate that its a secret, I’m tired of trying to keep it but
 
If i say I love you, would you say it back?
I’m too scared of falling, If you’re not where I land
 
I’m a coward, kinda cautious, you can call me insecure
I got reasons, I was shot down, When I said it first before
 
Feeling like I’m lying, wish i wasn’t hiding, I just wanna tell the truth 
I hate that its a secret, tired of trying to keep it BUT
 
If i say I love you, would you say it back?
Cos I’m too scared of falling, If you’re not where I land
and i’m dying to tell you, cus I need you to know,
so if I say I love you, would you say it back
 
maybe I should start speaking my mind
cus my heart won’t stop screaming inside
maybe I should start speaking my mind
cus my heart won’t stop screaming inside
 
So if I say I love you, would you say it back
I’m too scared of falling, If you’re not where I land
and i’m dying to tell you, cus I need you to know,
So If i say I love you, would you say it back
