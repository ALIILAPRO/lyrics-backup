		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't escape this
Feeling inside burns me up
I can't erase it
Have I gone mad on my own
Why can't I face this
Hurry up, I'm lost without
Some kind of placement
Something real in my life

So change it
And make me forget

Save me, I'm buried alive this time
Bending, and breaking all I have left inside
Blaming everyone for nothing
I'm hating me for what I've done with my life

It's time to wake up
This time it's all in my head
It's what I'm made of
It's not what you say I am
I have this anxious feeling
Running through these veins inside of me
I can't explain it
I'm running out of patience

So change it
And make me forget

Save me, I'm buried alive this time
Bending, and breaking all I have left inside
Blaming everyone for nothing
I'm hating me for what I've done with my life  (x2)
