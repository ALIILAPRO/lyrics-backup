		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Aviva)

Always feel the world's upside down
When I call you I see clearly
When I'm with you I always frown
But when I'm not I miss you really
You'll never understand that
That isn't so bad
Things are better because of you
I guess you just have to believe me

I'm a contradiction, I'm alright with that
Sorry it's confusing, hope you'll understand

I hate you
But I love you
I want you to leave me alone
I need you to come over here
But you are always in my face
You got me feeling, got me feeling

I hate you
But I love you
I want you to leave me alone
I need you to come over here
But why you always in my face?
You know I hate to love you

Wondering if we can pretend
There is no devil on my shoulder
Every day feels longer again
Both of us are getting older

I'm a contradiction, I'm alright with that
Sorry it's confusing, hope you'll understand

I hate you
But I love you
I want you to leave me alone
I need you to come over here
But you are always in my face
You got me feeling, got me feeling

I hate you
But I love you
I want you to leave me alone
I need you to come over here
But why you always in my face?
You know I hate to love you

Whoa
Hate to love you
Oh
Hate to love you

I'm a contradiction, I'm alright with that
Sorry it's confusing, hope you'll understand

I hate you
But I love you
I want you to leave me alone
I need you to come over here
But you are always in my face
You got me feeling, got me feeling

I hate you
But I love you
I want you to leave me alone
I need you to come over here
But why you always in my face?
You know I hate to love you

Whoa
Hate to love you
Oh
Hate to love you
