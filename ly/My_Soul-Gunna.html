		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I ain't sellin' my soul
I just need to slow down
We got London On Da Track
I ain't sellin' my soul
I just need to slow down
Metro Boomin want some more, nigga

Gunna, he the real dripper (he the real dripper)
Tight Balmain denim (Balmain)
Rockstar style killer (rockstar style)
Got choppers like a wild villain (wild)
Bitch, let me dig in her (I dig)
I done left my kids in her (damn)
I been trappin' since a jit (that's a child)
And you lookin' at a mid dealer (mid)
Diamonds shinin' like a lighthouse (like a lighthouse)
Ten thousand on me right now (racks)
Seven grams of the dark stuff (the dark stuff)
Baby boy need to pipe down (pipe down)
Gettin' slices of the bread now (of the bread)
Keepin' track like a head count (like a head)
I been countin' cash in every route (yeah)
It's been hard to book a show south

I been on the road (I been on the road)
I'm about to roll out (roll)
Do you wanna roll? (Do you wanna roll?)
Need to let me know now (need to let me know now)
I been movin' slow (I been movin' slow)
I just need to slow down (slow down)
'Bout to cop a Rolls ('bout to cop a Rolls)
Ain't sellin' my soul (soul)

I just use her just for sex (use her just for sex)
I'm a send the bitch a text later (text)
I'm that boy that coppin' all flavors (all flavors)
New Gucci's, they was all gators (they was all)
Black diamond like Darth Vader (like Darth)
In the booth, still countin' paper (paper)
Gotta chance it, I'm a risk taker (I'm a risk taker)
Now the chopper got round like Haiti (Haiti)
Hangin' with some Slimes, you ain't my kind
Nigga, stop lyin', you a faker (you a faker)
I'm readin' your sign (yeah), pick up your vibe (yeah)
Fuck around and meet your maker (meet your maker)
Nigga, might pop your tater
Glock in the sock gon' rock your cranium (rock your cranium)
Ain't got nothing else to say to you (nah)
I'm stompin' you out with the latest shoe (yeah)

I been on the road (I been on the road)
I'm about to roll out (roll)
Do you wanna roll? (Do you wanna roll?)
Need to let me know now (need to let me know now)
I been movin' slow (I been movin' slow)
I just need to slow down (slow down)
'Bout to cop a Rolls ('bout to cop a Rolls)
Ain't sellin' my soul (soul)

Ain't sellin' my soul
I just need to slow down
We got London on da Track
(We got London on da Track) ain't sellin' my soul
We got Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you more, nigga
I just need to slow down
