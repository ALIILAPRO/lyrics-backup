		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The clock keeps ticking
As the time pass by
So many times I've forgiven you
In my mind
My dreams keep haunting me
I get no sleep
I keep thinking
I'm in too deep

The clock keeps ticking
As the time pass by
So many times I've forgiven you
In my mind
My dreams keep haunting me
I get no sleep
I keep thinking
I'm in too deep

The clock keeps ticking
And the time pass by
I keep thinking that I won't stop by
Why do you want to let me drown
Still my mind is falling down

The clock keeps ticking
As the time pass by
So many times I've forgiven you
In my mind
My dreams keep haunting me
I get no sleep
I keep thinking
I'm in too deep

The clock keeps ticking
And the time pass by
I keep thinking that I won't stop by
Why do you want to let me drown
Still my mind is falling down
