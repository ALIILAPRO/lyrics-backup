		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We were on our high, now we on our low
I need to pull myself together
Going back to sleep, wake me up when you leave
Last night was just a mistake

Broken dreams, slamming doors
Is all we have ever known
Say goodbye, there's no return
I can't look back this time

'Cause I don't even hate you anymore
You call it heartache, I call it my way
I don't even know what you adore
I can't feel heartache, just going my way
I don't know you anymore (my way)
I don't know you anymore (my way)
I don't know you anymore (hey, my way)
I don't know you anymore (my)
I don't know you anymore

(I don't know you anymore)
(I don't know you anymore)
(I don't know you anymore)
(I don't know you anymore)
(Hey)

We were stoned in love right from the start
So don't ever say you're sorry
We need to find a way, I hope you feel the same
This love was never for us

Broken dreams, slamming doors
Is all we have ever known
Say goodbye, there's no return
I can't look back this time

'Cause I don't even hate you anymore
You call it heartache, I call it my way
I don't even know what you adore
I can't feel heartache, just going my way
I don't know you anymore (my way)
I don't know you anymore (my way)
I don't know you anymore (hey, my way)
I don't know you anymore (my)
I don't know you anymore

I know, I know that it's my way (my way, my way)
I know, I know that it's my way (my way, my way)
Our brightest days were my darkest place
That's when I knew we don't belong

I don't know you anymore (my way)
I don't know you anymore (my way) 
I don't know you anymore (hey, my way)
I don't know you anymore (my)
I don't know you anymore
