		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We moved in Diego
When we go they say so
We do what we gotta do we play ya'll
I got hundred people on my payroll
On me a panda and we got bitches in Belarus
Six is a panda and they know that we glamorous 
So many barriers
Got many we carrying
Saw you hilarious
My money will carry me

What you wanna do to me
I know what you'd do to me
What you wanna do to me
Fuck her when it's suiting me
Would you entertain me
All I want is enter
Entertainment
Could you ever blame me

When I'm nearby OMG
Got Versace on my jeans
Boy we like another breed
I got AB on the beat
On me a panda and we got bitches in Belarus
Six is a panda and they know that we glamorous 
So many barriers
Got many we carrying
Saw you hilarious
My money will carry me

What you wanna do to me
I know what you'd do to me
What you wanna do to me
Fuck her when it's suiting me
Would you entertain me
All I want is enter
Entertainment
Could you ever blame me
