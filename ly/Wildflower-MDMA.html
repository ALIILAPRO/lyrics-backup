		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She might bring me to-, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
She might bring me to the fire, she might 
Messiah, tell me I look
Attire, watch me burn, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Fire (yeah)
She might bring me to the f- (yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah)

She might bring me to the fire, telling me everything I desire
You know the devil roll in good attire
Take in my attire, now I fell in love with a wildflower
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, bitch I fell in love with a wildflower (wildflower)
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, guess I fell in love with a wildflower

(Come out with me, yeah, and stay)

Death don't follow me, death don't follow me, I don't want it (yeah)
Got to love cautiously, got to love cautiously, I'm a goner (oh)
If it is all for me, if it is all for me, give me torture (yeah)
Your love like lsd, your love like lsd, out of order (yeah)
I let my feelings free, I let my feelings free 'til the morning
up the hill, landslide, seen the open field, walked on the landmine
Say I always trip but you became mine
say I always trip but you demand time
How the fuck I'm 'posed to feel if my hands tied? 
Cry me a river (cry), cry me a river (cry), guess I'm deep sea diving
I can deliver (I), I can deliver, that's a rumor and the risk of your highness

She might bring me to the fire, telling me everything I desire
You know the devil roll in good attire
Take in my attire, now I fell in love with a wildflower (wildflower)
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, bitch I fell in love with a wildflower 
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, guess I fell in love with a wildflower

She might bring me to the fire, telling me everything I desire
You know the devil roll in good attire
Take in my attire, now I fell in love with a wildflower 

She might bring me to the fire
Messiah, tell me I look
Attire, watch me burn, burn
She been feeling, give me fire
she might bring me to the f-
