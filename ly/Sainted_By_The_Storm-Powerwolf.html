		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All aboard kissed by the iron fist
We are sainted by the storm

Strive across the seven seas
Under banners of the cross
Brave the walls of deadly waves
Born to pay the price for loss

Went ahead by force of will
And the sails up to the sky
Sainted by the sacrament
And blessed to testify

The belief that a land will rise
And of glory be our dome
And hand of God will lead us home

All aboard kissed by the iron fist
We are sainted by the storm
Facing the wind for we all have sinned
We are tainted and forlorn
For the wild (for the wild), for the night (for the night)
For the land and the fight
Seventy feet for the iron greed
We are sainted by the night

Ride the planks and beat the sea
On our quest to lands unknown
Gone for praise and sanctity
All to give our flesh and bone
Onward into foreign seas
With no fear and no regret
Heavy and with thorns equipped
The crown upon our heads

The belief that the Lord will rise
And in Heaven, we all roam
By the grace of God, we die alone

All aboard kissed by the iron fist
We are sainted by the storm
Facing the wind for we all have sinned
We are tainted and forlorn
For the wild (for the wild), for the night (for the night)
For the land and the fight
Seventy feet for the iron greed
We are sainted by the night

All aboard kissed by the iron fist
We are sainted by the storm
Facing the wind for we all have sinned
We are tainted and forlorn
For the wild (for the wild), for the night (for the night)
For the land and the fight

All aboard kissed by the iron fist
We are sainted by the storm
Facing the wind for we all have sinned
We are tainted and forlorn
For the wild (for the wild), for the night (for the night)
For the land and the fight
Seventy feet for the iron greed
We are sainted by the night
