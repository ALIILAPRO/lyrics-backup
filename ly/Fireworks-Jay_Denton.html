		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'd known you just about my whole life
But always thought you were so far out of my league
That I didn't really think anything of it
When you came down with my friends
For that weekend at the beach
We spent the whole day in the water and the sun
You got a tan, and I got burned
And as the celebrations started that evening
You came up next to me
I was barely breathing
On the fourth of July without a cloud in the sky
With the waves crashing on the coast
And through the summer heat I felt a chill over me
When you grabbed my arm and leaned in close
A thousand colors and lights were exploding
And I wanted you so bad that it hurt
You looked me straight in the eyes
Took my world by surprise
And kissed me underneath the fireworks
That year turned into the best one I'd ever known
We both fell in love and it kept on growing
I thought for sure you were the one
So to make you proud
I started looking for a ring and started planning how
Then something happened
I felt you pulling away
I never understood and you never really explained
So I thought I'd take you back to where it all started
And never guessed that's where I'd end up broken hearted
On the fourth of July without a cloud in the sky
With the waves crashing on the coast
And through the summer heat I felt a chill over me
When you grabbed my arm and leaned in close
A thousand colors and lights were exploding
And I wanted you so bad that it hurt
You looked me straight in the eyes
Took my world by surprise
And left me underneath the fireworks
As the season past I never really moved on
I'd be with different people, but that part of me was gone
So years later just to wallow in the past
I took a trip to that same pier with a whiskey flask
Standing there sipping fire and memories
Bottle rockets lit the sky, but what made me blink
Was from the distance like a ghost or a dream
I saw you walking up the beach
And walk right up to me
On the fourth of July without a cloud in the sky
With the waves crashing on the coast
And through the summer heat I felt a chill over me
When you grabbed my arm and leaned in close
A thousand colors and lights were exploding
And I wanted you so bad that it hurt
You looked me straight in the eyes
Took my world by surprise
And found me underneath the fireworks
I fell in love then I lost it
Then I found it
Underneath the fireworks
