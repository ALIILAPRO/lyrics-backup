		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Had a feeling that you'd call me to say you're sorry
Instead you just said it's my mistake
Are you waging up a war for the sake of something to say?
When am I not to blame?
And what you got to say about me?
I don't know you very well if you're acting like someone else
And what you got to say about us
Don't you see this all leads to games, you should start trusting me

Slow down, won't you come around?
Slow down, won't you come around to my ways?
(I've been tryin' not to let you go)
Slow down, won't you come around?
(Tryin' not to let you go)
Slow down, won't you come around to my place?

Well, I wish I could say sorry but I don't have much to say
You won't believe me anyway (Anyway)
I got a thing for causin' arguments
But in my defense, I'm scared you'll walk away
And what I'm tryna say about me
I don't know me very well if I'm actin' like someone else
And what you got to say about us
Don't you see that I'm here to stay, you should start trustin' me (Trustin' me)

Slow down, won't you come around?
Slow down, won't you come around to my ways?
(I've been tryin' not to let you go)
Slow down, won't you come around?
(I've been tryin' not to let you go)
Slow down, won't you come around to my place?
(I've been tryin' not to let you go)

Slow down, won't you come around?
Slow down, won't you come around to my ways?

You don't know me, like I wish you would
You don't know me, like I know you could
I don't want to be misunderstood, oh
'Cause I don't think you know

(I've been tryin' not to let you go)
Slow down, won't you come around?
(I've been tryin' not to let you go)
Slow down, won't you come around to my ways?
(I've been tryin' not to let you go)
Slow down, won't you come around?
(I've been tryin' not to let you go)
Slow down, won't you come around to my place?
(I've been tryin' not to let you go)
Slow down, won't you come around?
Slow down, won't you come around to my ways?
(I've been tryin' not to let you go)
Slow down, won't you come around?
Slow down, won't you come around to my place?

I've been tryin' not to let you go (Slow down)
But I'm fighting on my own (Slow down)
Ain't no one else like you, I know
That's like this
I've been tryin' not to let you go (Won't you come around?)
But I'm fighting on my own (Slow down, slow down)
Ain't no one else like you, I know
(Slow don't, won't you come around to my ways?)
