		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Nothing changes
But the weather
You just think that you got better
Time doesn't heal
It scabs the wound
I won't cover
Cover my scars for you
I won't cover my scars for you

Victim of deceit
Weighed down by your heavy hand
A constant battle
Between who you want
And who I am
I'll see you at the fucking cross roads
I'll make you bite through your tongue
When you see who I am today
I'll make you hate what you've done

Cover your tracks
Let revenge flood
You've made your mark
Blood will have blood

Idiot
