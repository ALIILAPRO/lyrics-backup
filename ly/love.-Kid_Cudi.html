		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I am happy to be alive
'Cause I know I could not be
In a place that's filled with lies
Can't stand no quiet nights
While I fill up my glass with pride
Hopeful is all I know
How to keep me from silent cries
Nothing I can say
Facing all this pain in my way

I fight it every day
Why am I this way?
A nigga tryna maintain
I sit and tell myself, "Okay"
We gotta find another way
You gotta find another way
You gotta find another way, yeah, whoa

Don't be so down, come on, young homie (yo)
You'll be okay, you'll find real love (find real love)
All of the stories, the hero gets lonely (yo)
Now is the time to show what you're made of (made of)

Don't be so down, come on, young homie (yo)
You'll be okay, you'll find real love (yeah, yeah, yeah)
All of the stories, the hero gets lonely (yeah, yeah)
Now is the time to show what you're made of (made of)

Now is the time to show what you're made of (made of)

I am happy to be alive
'Cause I know I could not be
In a place so filled with lies
Can't stand no quiet nights
While I fill up my glass with pride
Hopeful is all I know
How to keep me from silent cries
Nothing I can say
Done running from this pain in my way

I fight it every day
Why am I this way?
A nigga tryna maintain
I sit and tell myself, "Okay"
We gotta find another way
You gotta find another way
You gotta find another way, yeah, whoa

Don't be so down, come on, young homie (yo)
You'll be okay, you'll find real love (you'll find real love)
All of the stories, the hero gets lonely (yo)
Now is the time to show what you're made of

Don't be so down, come on, young homie (oh, yo)
You'll be okay, you'll find real love
All of the stories, the hero gets lonely
Now is the time to show what you're made of

Don't be so down, come on, young homie
You'll be okay, you'll find real love
All of the stories, the hero gets lonely
Now is the time to show what you're made of

Don't be so down, come on, young homie
You'll be okay, you'll find real love
All of the stories, the hero gets lonely
Now is the time to show what you're made of (made of)

Now is the time to show what you're made of (made of)

Don't be so down, come on, young homie
You'll be okay, you'll find real love
All of the stories, the hero gets lonely
Now is the time to show what you're made of

Don't be so down, come on, young homie
You'll be okay, you'll find real love
All of the stories, the hero gets lonely
Now is the time to show what you're made of (made of)
