		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Man of madness who lives in my head
Keeping me awake at night he sits on my bed
He drives me crazy, he won't go away
Playing his game every night and everyday, yeah-ah

My mind feels heavy, my body feels weak
Suicidal thoughts crying out for some sleep
Impending doom is what I'm about
Think I'm going mad without a shadow of doubt

I sense a serenity yeah
Is it really out there?
I don't read the holy books 'cause they take me nowhere
I can't hold on yes I'm losing control
I'm paying the price now for... Selling My Soul
Selling My Soul

I sense a serenity yeah
Is it really out there?
I don't read the holy books 'cause they take me nowhere
I can't hold on yes I'm losing control
I'm paying the price now for... Selling My Soul
Selling My Soul

Yeah-ah
For Selling My Soul
Yeah-ah
Selling My Soul
Yeah-ah
For Selling My Soul
