		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Where can I go it seems 
I've lost my way I'm barely hangin' on 
Trapped inside 
Trying to find a way out I wanna feel no more 
The walls are closing in and I can feel the pressure start to rise 
I try to hold on for dear life 
One by one, bit by piece I start to come undone and things begin to unravel 
This is not my kind of world 
This is not where I belong 
How can I escape these feelings? 
Oh my mind 
Just this once I'd like to find 
Some clarity 
I'm just so tired I'm running out of reasons why 
I should even try to stay alive 
One by one, bit by piece I start to come undone and things begin to unravel 
This is not my kind of world 
This is not where I belong 
How can I escape? 
One by one, bit by piece I start to come undone 
It all begins to unravel 
This is not my kind of world 
This is not where I belong 
How can I escape these feelings? 
I start to come undone
