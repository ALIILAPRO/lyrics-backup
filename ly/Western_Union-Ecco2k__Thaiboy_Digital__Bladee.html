		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One shot, click, click, click, reload, reload, reload
Twenty thousand THB, make a call to Nino
Western union, six, zero, zero, zero
I go easy mode, cheat code, cheat code, cheat code

Three stars, one that is you
(Loss and gain)
Reload, reload, reload

One shot, click, click, click, reload, reload, reload
Twenty thousand THB, make a call to Nino
Western union, six, zero, zero, zero
I go easy mode, cheat code, cheat code, cheat code
Drain Gang, GTB, you know we go psycho
At the Texaco gas station, talkin' on the phone
Can't stay here, I've got to go, this feeling won't leave me alone
I stay off the road, incoming, watching through the scope

Ice cream truck (yeah), cherry on top (yeah)
Gate on lock (on lock), I can't stop (can't stop)
Mansion in the hills (hills), blue pills (pills)
Time stands still, open seven seals

This the VIP life (the VIP life)
I mix that dirty with the sprite
Black bottle with the ice (with the ice)
Yeah, all the stars align
How am I still alive? (GTB until I die)

One shot, click, click, click, reload, reload, reload
Twenty thousand THB, make a call to Nino
Western union, six, zero, zero, zero
I go easy mode, cheat code, cheat code, cheat code
Drain Gang, GTB, you know we go psycho
At the Texaco gas station, talking on the phone
Can't stay here, I've got to go, this feeling won't leave me alone
I stay off the road, incoming, watching through the scope
