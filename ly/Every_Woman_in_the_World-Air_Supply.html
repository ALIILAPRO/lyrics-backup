		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Overnight scenes, dinner and wine
Saturdays girls
I was never in love, never had the time
In my hustle and hurry world
Laughing my self to sleep
Waking up lonely
I needed someone to hold me, oh

It's such a crazy old town
It can drag you down
'Til you run out of dreams
So you party all night to the music and lights
But you don't what happiness means
I was dancing in the dark with strangers
No love around me
When suddenly you found me, oh

Girl, you're every woman in the world to me
You're my fantasy, you're my reality
Girl, you're every woman in the world to me
You're everything I need, you're everything to me
Oh girl

Everything good, everything fine
That's what you are
So put your hand in mine
And together we'll climb
As high as the highest star
I'm living a lifetime in every minute
That we're together
And I'm staying right here forever, oh

Girl, you're every woman in the world to me
You're my fantasy, you're my reality
Girl, you're every woman in the world to me
You're everything I need, you're everything to me
Oh girl

Girl, you're every woman in the world to me
You're my fantasy, you're my reality
Girl, you're every woman in the world to me
You're everything I need, you're everything to me

Girl, you're every woman in the world to me
You're my fantasy, you're my reality
Girl, you're every woman in the world to me
You're everything I need, you're everything to me
