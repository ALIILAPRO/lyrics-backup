		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  Verse 1
When did I start to forget
All of the great things you did? When did I throw away faith for the impossible?
How did I start to believe
You weren't sufficient for me?
Why do I talk myself out of seeing miracles?

Chorus
You are more than able
You are more than able
You are more than able
You are more than able
Who am I to deny what the Lord can do?

Verse 2
Now I see all that I have
Oh, I've got my confidence back
I put my trust in the One who still does miracles
You do miracles

Chorus

Bridge
Can you imagine
With all of the faith in the room What the Lord can do?
What the Lord can do?
And it's gonna happen
Just let the way maker through He's gonna move
He's gonna move

Bridge 2
Anything is possible
Anything is possible
Anything is possible
Who am I to deny what the Lord can do?
I've come a long way
I've seen how You work

There's so much goodness and grace Much more than I deserve
'Cause I know who l am And I can't stay where I'm at We've come this far by faith And I just can't turn back

'Cause He's not done with me yet He's not done with me yet
There's so much more to the story You're not done with me yet
You're not done with me yet You're not done with me yet There's so much more to the story You're not done with me yet
