		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Congratulations
Guess you the first nigga got
Close enough to play me contemplating
Ooh, I'm thinking 'bout doing something crazy
My mind racing
So I'ma exhale, sit back, and just get faded
We both know, baby you gon' hate you met me

You gon' regret it when
I find somebody different
I know you'll be back, but boy
This time it ain't no fixing
I'll hurt more than your feelings so
It's best you keep your distance
Boy, I'ma find someone to give
Me everything I'm missing
Karma's a bitch, and her name Ann Marie
You ain't on shit, shorty
I ain't even gon' make a scene
'Cause you ain't even that fine
To be wasting my time
That dick too small to be acting so big
Can you picture in your mind
Shorty breaking my spine?
Show you why you shouldn't play with me
Baby, karma's a bitch

So I hear you wanna fix us
Should've act right back when I gave a fuck
Know you wishing you were here
When you next to her know I'm all up in your
Head while you sexing her
Thought about beating up them hoes
Even thought about burning up your clothes
But the best karma was me letting you go
Now sit back, shorty, watch this glow

You gon' regret it when
I find somebody different
I know you'll be back, but boy
This time it ain't no fixing
I'll hurt more than your feelings so
It's best you keep your distance
Boy, I'ma find someone to give
Me everything I'm missing
Karma's a bitch, and her name Ann Marie
You ain't on shit, shorty
I ain't even gon' make a scene
'Cause you ain't even that fine
To be wasting my time
That dick too small to be acting so big
Can you picture in your mind
Shorty breaking my spine?
Show you why you shouldn't play with me
Baby, karma's a bitch
