(Lukovic got beats)

(Yeah)
Yeah, I just got the Tonka (yeah)
This is a big body, this a Rolls-Royce
And you best pick up the phone when I'm calling you
And you best leave me alone if I don't talk to you

Tonka, this a big truck, this a Lamb' truck
Tonka, this a Rolls-Royce, this a Royce truck
Tonka, this a Maybach, this a Maybach truck
Tonka, in a big body, in a Trackhawk

I called up my vibe, told her to slide (yeah)
I don't think I could quit it, I'm on the X my whole life (yeah)
I run up a bag on a bitch, slide, doubled it twice (doubled it twice)
Up in the sky (woo), talk to the gods (woo)

X every night for my whole life
Tonka, big body, yeah, two
Ran up all my money, so I put Rick on my shoes
It's a lion on the Kenzo shirt, I feel like a zoo
Why you lyin', bitch? You ain't for sure, just tell me the truth
Yeah, yeah, I got money now, what I got to prove?
Yeah, rock Chane'-ne' all the time, I see it through
Whole lot of blue bills, I be thumbin' through 'em
All on this new wave, I make 'em look stupid
I had to go buy the big body just 'cause I said that I did it
And if you not rich, don't even think 'bout it, at least he admit it (least he admit it)
All I do is boot up on the X and count my bread
Bitch, it's all I do (yeah)
I be high as God, so what would Allah do?
Yeah, I had to go and do this shit first, yeah, for all of you (for all of y'all)
Bitch, oh, you see it just how you get it
Talking 'bout bread, damn, lil' Yeat, what do you do? How do you get it?
I need to know, I just touched a hundred fifty
Money got me goin' COVID, sickly
She just shaved her pussy, but it's a lil' prickly
No, I don't care about this bitch, I'ma bust on her quickly
How tall is that money? That bitch do a fifty
And I walk around with that lint 'cause that money been sitting in my pocket, I'm driftin'

(Yeah)
Yeah, I just got the Tonka (yeah)
This is a big body, this a Rolls-Royce
And you best pick up the phone when I'm calling you
And you best leave me alone if I don't talk to you

Tonka, this a big truck, this a Lamb' truck
Tonka, this a Rolls-Royce, this a Royce truck
Tonka, this a Maybach, this a Maybach truck
Tonka, in a big body, in a Trackhawk

I called up my vibe, told her to slide (yeah)
I don't think I could quit it, I'm on the X my whole life (yeah)
I run up a bag on a bitch, slide, doubled it twice (doubled it twice)
Up in the sky (woo), talk to the gods (woo)
