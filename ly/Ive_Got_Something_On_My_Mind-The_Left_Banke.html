		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've got something on my mind
It's no lie, I'm telling you why

I've got something on my mind
It's no lie, I'm telling you why 

Up to now I've been afraid to say that
You're the cause of all my pain
If you keep this up, my friend,
I think I'll go insane

I've got something on my mind
It's no lie, I'm telling you why

You've been treating me so bad
Since the day that we met
But now I am oh so glad
And my girl you can bet

I will say what's on my mind
And this time there'll be no lie

I've got something on my mind
It's no lie, I'm telling you why 

You've been treating me so bad
Since the day that we met
But now I am oh so glad
And my girl you can bet

I will say what's on my mind
And this time there'll be no lie

I've got something on my mind
It's no lie, I'm telling you why
