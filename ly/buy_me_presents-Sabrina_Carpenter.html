		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you were a wise man, baby, you would drop
Every other ho, ho, ho and put me on top
Up there on your tree, better treat me like a star
Spend your cookie dough, dough, dough, spend it on my heart

Fuck the jet, send the sleigh
It's a packed holiday and I got options, babe

If you don't wanna buy me presents, drink me like a warm glass of milk
If you're not gonna race here from the North Pole to Beverly Hills
Just to keep my stocking filled
Well, I know somebody who will
(Somebody who will, uh-huh, somebody who will, somebody who will)
(Buy me presents, baby)

He's a little bit older (like super old)
Got a bit of a dad bod
From a city that's colder (brr)
But damn it, he's so hot
He knows when I'm sleepin' (sleepin')
And he knows when I'm not
Haven't like seen him in a while, he's probably just busy at his workshop

Fuck the jet (fuck the jet), send the sleigh (send the sleigh)
It's a packed holiday and I got options, babe

If you don't wanna buy me presents, drink me like a warm glass of milk
If you're not gonna race here from the North Pole to Beverly Hills
Just to keep my stocking filled (so filled)
Well, I know somebody who will
(Somebody who will, somebody who will, somebody who will)
(Buy me presents, baby)

If you don't wanna buy me presents
Drink me like a warm glass of milk (drink me like a warm glass of milk)
If you're not gonna race here from the North Pole to Beverly Hills
Just to keep my stocking filled (so filled)
Oh, I know somebody who will
