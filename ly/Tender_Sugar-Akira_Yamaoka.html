		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I run, I fall, I drift away
Check my body now, was it body or soul?
The darkness fades, fades to the light
Disappearing now, disappears from the night
And all these nightmares I once had as a child
The morning always came, it came too late
What did my mind forget, forget to hide?
Could the nightmare be awake?
I don't know

In or out, up or down
Never know its an illusion
Round and round, on and on
Every day spins my confusion

Chorus
Not again not again not again
From this dream I can't awake
What is real what is real what is real?
It's getting hard for me to take
What I need what I need what I need
A little something I rely
And the white sugar gently hides me
Oh the sweet sugar saves me
It's the room that confines me, confines me

Yesterday, back and forth
Broken door no longer opens
Breakin down, need it now
Mother's sugar always loves me
