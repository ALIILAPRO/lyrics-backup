		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Big diamonds, big dog, big shinin'
Hit him all in the stomach, fucked up his linin'
Could've caught him at that Wendy's, it was bad timin' (21)
Do a nigga mob style, hit him while he dinin'

Uh, told your fuckin' ass I'll be back
Now them niggas goin' crazy tryna sign me back
Like some play, say Young Money nigga for sure
Camped out in front your house, we just lit up some smores
Now these niggas want bars, Butterfingers, Snickers, and Mars
Seven days a week, bet a nigga armed
Yeah, Fresh, we done done it, did it without stuntin'
Countin' money, need a calculator
The crib got a elevator, you not a skater
We got you on the floor, paint your ass red
Turn his bitch into a art show
Now on the left side, we got the brand-new Benz
And on the inside, got brand-new MAC-10s
And in the middle of the night, niggas'll find you
Me and 2 Chainz, bitch, we the new Big Tymers
Mannie Fresh on the beat, he a true Big Tymer, yeah

Foreign cars (cars)
Foreign broads (broads)
Hoes with no bras (yeah)
Neighborhood like big drawers
I'm a GOAT (GOAT)
What you know? (Know)
What's the score?
You hurtin', I front you ten kilos
I like women (women)
That like women (women)
That like grinnin' (grinnin')
That like swimmin' (swimmin')
That's lightskinnin' (skinnin')
Or darkskinnin' (skinnin')
They skinny dippin' (dippin')
You penny pinchin' (pinchin')
You pussy pimpin' (pimpin')
Or pussy poppin' (poppin')
I'm on it, nigga (ayy)
I'm on a mission (ayy)
I gotta get it (get it)
I'm in tune (yeah)
Like fuckin' siblings (ooh)
You fuckin' gimmick (yeah)
You fuckin' with us (yeah)
You get whacked (whacked)
Your wig cracked (crack)
A big sacks (yeah)
I shot ball (ayy)
I pitch crack (ayy)
I dig that (ayy)
I'm raw, nigga (yeah)
No Zig-Zags (yeah)
My bitch bad (bad)
Her bitch bad (bad)
You funny, nigga (funny)
A Sinbad (yeah)
I sit back (yeah)
I get bags (bags)
I baow-baow, I click-clack

Big diamonds, big dog, big shinin'
Hit him all in the stomach, fucked up his linin'
Could've caught him at that Wendy's, it was bad timin' (21)
Do a nigga mob style, hit him while he dinin' (21)

Marble floors, I got bulletproof doors (21)
Rappin' off the head like I'm Wayne, like I'm Hov (facts)
Grew up 'round them cutthroats, I be on my toes
Old killer from my hood, snot that clean 'cause he throwed (21)
She wanna fuck a young gangsta, I know, facts
Real deal player, I ain't never kiss and told (21)
You know I'm in a rush, baby, come up out that robe
I told her she wet already, she been playin' with her robe (Goddamn, oh shit)
Damn, she done squirted on my clothes (21)
If we in the party, then we came for the hoes (21)
Open a dispensary, I got free smoke (21)
Fuck a top spot, nigga, I came for the GOAT (pussy)
I'm a dog, German Shepard, Great Dane (yeah)
He got money, but his ass still a lame (yeah)
On the pole, shake that ass, do your thing
She from the Southside, down the street from Flocka Flame (on God)
Stick left him So So Def, but I don't know Jermaine (21)
How you watch a million dollars and it look plain? (21)
I'm worth eight figures, so I really can't complain (on God)
I tried to play your album, every song sound the same

Big diamonds, big dog, big shinin'
Hit him all in the stomach, fucked up his linin'
Could've caught him at that Wendy's, it was bad timin' (21)
Do a nigga mob style, hit him while he dinin' (21)
