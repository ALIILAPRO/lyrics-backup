		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What if I follow you down
Down your way
What if I follow you down
Into the clay
And carry your weight?
It feels like I'm in a dream now
But I'm wide awake
I can see the eyes of a child somehow
They seem to have something to say
But maybe it's nothing
 
I'm terrified when I wake
 
What if I'm bound to your world now
Bound to stay
What if you were swallowed down deep underground
And hidden away
I wish I could bring you back now all for you
And mold you from clay all for you
See through the eyes of a child somehow
I wish there was something to say
But still there is nothing to say
 
I'm terrified when I wake
