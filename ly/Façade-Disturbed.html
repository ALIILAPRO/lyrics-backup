		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No one knows just what has become of her 
Shattered doll, desperate 
Oh so innocent and delicate 
But too damn obdurate 
And obstinate to let go 

Broken down, hurt again, it never ends 
Frightened and trembling 
Did she fall again? An accident? 
Her eyes encircled in black again 
I can't believe that she's still with him 

For how long will you try? 
How long until you walk away? 
Your facade can't disguise 
The fact that you're in misery 

Look inside see what has become of her 
Hiding within again 
Can she pick herself up again? 
It's just too difficult and arduous to let go 

Homicide flashes through her mind again 
No more pain, take control 
If he raises his hand again 
She'll find her freedom in killing him 
The world will see that she's had enough 

For how long will you try? 
How long until you walk away? 
Your facade can't disguise 
The fact that you're in misery 

For how long will you try? 
How long until you walk away? 
From the look in your eyes 
I know you bleed internally 

For how long will you deny? 
How long until you walk away? 
Your facade can't disguise 
The fact that you're in misery 

For how long will you try? 
How long until you walk away? 
From the look in your eyes 
I know you bleed internally 

Broken down, hurt again 
It never ends
