		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You knew it right from the start 

You said you wanted this, well this is the end 
The end of days and i don't want to be with you 
Well this, this is the end, the end of love 
I know it cuz i've seen this before 

You don't know what you're doing 
Get it right 
Your place in time is folding 
And so is mine 

This is the end of days i know 
I've seen it in my dreams 
I know what it means 
Well this is the end of days my friend 
I know it to be true 
When i look at you
