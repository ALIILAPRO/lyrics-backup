		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's a party goin' on 
People everywhere 
Yes the crowd is jumpin' 
Hands up in the air 
It's the weekend 
It's time to party 
So throw your hands up 
Come on everybody 

Come on get up everybody, come on get up everybody 
Come on get up everybody, come on get up everybody 
Come on get up everybody, come on get up everybody 
Come on get up everybody, come on get up everybody 

Everybody's feelin' happy 
When they hear the sound 
Dance to the music 
In the underground 
It's the weekend 
It's time to party 
So get up 
Come on everybody 

Come on get up let me see them come on get up let me see them 
Come on get up let me see them come on get up let me see them 
Come on get up let me see them come on get up let me see them 
Come on get up let me see them come on get up let me see them 

Movin' movin' slidin' slidin', rockin' feelin' 
Come on get up everybody, come on get up everybody
