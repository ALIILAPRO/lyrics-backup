		<p>
		  Let's go! 

Hey you, so you hit another brick wall
Your beat down but your not behind the 8-ball
Hey you, when you break it's not a reason to bleed
Let's go, let's go
It's not the end of the world
Just because you're in pieces
It's not the end of the world
Were all so young
Into love and violence
Live and let die
And let's go
All good people
Sin in silence
Forgive us our evils
Let's go
Let's go to the edge
Let's go to the end
Let's go, let's go, let's go
Let's go through the darkness
Nothing can stop us
Come on everybody let's go

Hey you, well your looking like a car crash
How long will the madness in your head last?
Hey, you when you break it's not a reason to bleed
Let's go, let's go
It's not the end of the world
Just because you're in pieces
It's not the end of the world
Were all so young
Into love and violence
Live and let die
And let's go
All good people
Sin in silence
Forgive us our evils
Let's go
Let's go to the edge
Let's go to the end
Let's go, let's go, let's go
Let's go through the darkness
Nothing can stop us
Come on everybody let's go
