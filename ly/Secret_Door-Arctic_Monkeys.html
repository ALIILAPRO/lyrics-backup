		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fools on parade cavort and carry on for waiting eyes 
That you would rather be beside than in front of 
But she's never been the kind to be hollowed by the stares 

She swam out of tonight's phantasm 
Grabbed my hand and made it very clear 
There's absolutely nothing for us here 
It's a magnolia celebration to be attempted on a Wednesday night 
It's better than to get a reputation as a miserable little tyke 
At least that's the conclusion she came to in this overture 

And the secret door swings behind us 
She's saying nothing, she's just giggling along 

Her arms were folded most indignant 
Not looking like she was soon to leave 
I had to squint in order to believe 
And then like a butler pushing on a bookshelf 
I'm unveiling the unexpected 
I, who was earlier reluctant
Was suddenly embarrassed and corrected 
How could such a creature survive in such a habitat?

And the secret door swings behind us 
She's saying nothing, she's just giggling along 
Even if they were to find us 
I wouldn't notice, I'm completely occupied 

As all the fools on parade cavort and carry on for waiting eyes 
Ones you would rather be beside than in front of 
But she's never been the kind to be hollowed by the stares 
Fools on parade frolic and fuck about to make her gaze 
Turn to a scribble on a page by a picture that holds her absence 
But you're daft to think she'd care 

Fools on parade
Fools on parade
Fools on parade
Conduct a sing-along
