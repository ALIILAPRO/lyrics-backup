		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wrapped myself up in all the tattered pages; A forlorn fable.

Faded lines; my message in a bottle is shattering now and sinking down.

I’m growing to know time as it goes.

Everything’s changing.

Break me with that truth take all my fractions.

Shaping something new out of the fragments.

Light up this old soul.

I was broken now I’m golden.

Now I’m golden.

Grasping out.

Tell me that you hope to hear

the words resound

that growing to know

time as it goes is life...

Open my eyes. This is life.

Change comes with time.
