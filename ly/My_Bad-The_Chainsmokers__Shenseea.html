		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know we set rules
But what can I do?
I think of your body when I'm back in my room
Maybe I'm confused
You're giving me clues
Alone with my thoughts and now they're all about you

Don't go thinking like that
Don't go thinking like that
Don't go thinking like that
You know I want you so bad-bad
Don't go thinking like that
Don't go thinking like that

My bad
I didn't mean to fall in love like that
And you don't even have to say it back
I didn't mean to fall in love like that
My bad

Don't go thinking like that
Don't go thinking like that
Don't go thinking like that
You know I want you so bad-bad
Don't go thinking like that (my bad)
Don't go thinking like that

I know what we said
Sometimes I forget
When I'm around you, you just have that effect on me
It's hard to be friends only
I just want your hands on me
Tired of talking, want your lips on my neck

Don't go thinking like that
Don't go thinking like that
Don't go thinking like that
You know I want you so bad-bad
Don't go thinking like that
Don't go thinking like that

My bad
I didn't mean to fall in love like that
And you don't even have to say it back
I didn't mean to fall in love like that
My bad

My bad
I didn't mean to fall in love like that
And you don't even have to say it back
I didn't mean to fall in love like that
My bad

Don't go thinking like that
I didn't mean to fall in love
Don't go thinking like that
You know I want you so bad-bad
Don't go thinking like that
I didn't mean to fall in love
Like that
My bad
