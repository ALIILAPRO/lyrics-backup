		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I want to cuddle up and cozy down with you
Wrap myself around you
Do what lovers do

Ah, the snow is fallin', passion's callin'
A glass of wine or two
I want a cuddle up, cozy down Christmas with you

Oh, we're not goin' anywhere (no we better not)
The storm is just too bad (oh, it's terrible)
There's no gettin' out of here
Old man Winter's seen to that
So here we sit
The candle's lit
And now that we're snowbound
Aw, what's to do but love on you
Cuddle up and cozy down

I want to cuddle up and cozy down with you (oh my)
Nestle up against your skin, do anything that we want to (mm)
Makin' love, hug and touch
And steal some kisses, too
I want a cuddle up and cozy down Christmas with you

We could both pretend we're sorry, act so disappointed
But to tell you the truth snugglin'
With you is all I ever really wanted
Now the fire is blazin', my thoughts are racin' 
What we're gonna do (oh, baby)
When I cuddle up and cozy down with you
What do ya say, wanna cuddle?
Yeah, I'd love to

Do, do, do, do 
Mm-hmm (do, do, do, do, do, do) 

Cuddlin' with you, aw
The snow is fallin', passion's callin'
A glass of wine or two
I want a cuddle up and cozy down Christmas with you

Cuddle up and cozy down in a wonderland for two
Why don't we cuddle up and cozy down Christmas with you?
Merry Christmas, Dolly
Merry Christmas, baby
