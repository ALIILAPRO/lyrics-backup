		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Listen up cubs, please don't be afraid
This is the worst news I swear I'll have to say to you

Mom's not here

God took her elsewhere, she's playing with deer
Where the snow is glistening year after year
I swear she's not dead
But she's never coming back again

Antarctica look what you did to us
Antarctica look what you did to us
Antarctica look what you did to us
Antarctica look what you did to us
You fucked it up
And for the sake of brevity, I'll sum this up
I'll sum this up

You opened my eyes, and closed them at the same time
You opened my eyes, and closed them at the same time
You opened my eyes, and closed them at the same time
You opened my eyes, and closed them at the same time
You opened up my eyes and closed them at the same time
