		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You know what Pac-Man stands for?
Program and control
He's program and control man, the whole thing is a metaphor
All he can do is consume
He's pursued by demons, that are probably just in his own head
And even if he does manage to escape by slipping out one side of the maze, what happens?
He comes right back in the other side
People think it's a happy game, well, it's not a happy game
But luckily, Pac-Man didn't affect us as kids
Otherwise we'd be running around in dark rooms
Munching pills, and listening to repetitive electronic music

Repetitive electronic music

Pac-Man didn't affect us as kids
Otherwise we'd be running around in dark rooms
Munching pills and listening to repetitive electronic music

Repetitive electronic music
Repetitive electronic music
Repetitive electronic music
Repetitive electronic music
Repetitive electronic music
Repetitive electronic music
Repetitive electronic music
Repetitive electronic music

Repetitive electronic music
