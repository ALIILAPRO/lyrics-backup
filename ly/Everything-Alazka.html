		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hiding from the one I need the most
A secret I've kept locked away
That might have saved us both

All the lies, we're turning for the worse
The truth might not be what you want
But what you deserve

If you just let me in
I'll tell you everything

The heart of mine you thought you owned alone
I've lost it on the way so long ago

And now all I ask of you
Opening the wounds

If you just let me in
For the last time, my love, I swear
I'll tell you everything
One more time, just one more time

But all the things I said before
They only made you close that door
So just let me in
Just let me in

I know, I know
You're better off alone

If you just let me in
I'll tell you everything

But all the things I said before
They only made you close that door
So just let me in
Just let me in
