		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Its eating me up I saw all the signs
Pushed them away and I walked with you blind

But ive heard enough sweet little lies
I swear I love you meant ride or die

Now I know what you did last summer
Oh I know what you did last summer

You stood on that stage my blood on your heart - dug it a grave with a dog in dark 
cnd I said ok don't jump to that part but baby its ringing out sounding alarms

Now I know what you did last summer
Oh I know what you did last summer

I know what you did I can taste it on your kiss
In a supercut replaying all those empty promises
Were you thinking with your head when you played me like you did
I know what you did I can taste it on your kiss

cnd baby baby it hurts
Baby yeah baby yeah baby baby it hurts 

Now I know what you did last summer
I know what you did last summer
Oh I know what you did last summer

cnd baby yeah 
Baby baby it hurt 
Baby baby it hurt
