		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You got your options, ay
Don't need a promise, it's the moment for me
I like the process, yeah
I'm asking put aside that good time for me

It ain't always gotta be that
Downtown dinner all that
Nice guy ain't tryna be bad
But if you want it I can be that
Voicemails I don't leave that
A week later you can text back
Choices you know I got that
But you and I, I think I like that

We can ebb and flow
Night until the morning
I won't tell a soul
If that's what you want
Just wanna be close
With no strings involved
Keep it on the low 'cause

You got your options, ay
Don't need a promise, it's the moment for me
I like the process, yeah
I'm asking put aside that good time for me

Look
We could play house for a couple days, ay
Order take out, have a couple dates
We could run it for a couple rounds, hit a couple shows
We ain't gotta be a couple though, look
Single with couple incentives
That could make sense, it's a juxtaposition
You want a friendship, you love when I hit it
I love to hit it, I don't want commitment
We both love to kick it, so there, ha

I can tell you all the things 
To make your day amazing
Write my name in pencil on your heart
I won't engrave it
You can erase it
So many options, you can replace it
We can leave our baggage there
Don't need to claim it 'cause

You got your options, ay (you got, you got, you got your options)
Don't need a promise, it's the moment for me (oh, yeah, eh, eh)
I like the process, yeah (I like the process)
I'm asking put aside that good time for me (I just need some time)

You got your options, ay (you got your option, baby, baby, baby)
Don't need a promise, it's the moment for me (yeah, all I wanted is a moment)
I like the process, yeah (I like the process, baby)
I'm asking put aside that good time for me (I just need some good time)

All I wanted is a moment
