		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In a new world
Fake world, safe world, she resigned
Take it back, baby
You don't know where I been in my mind
I thought we were fine
Take it back, baby
You don't know where I been in my mind
But you been in my mind 
You don't know where I been in my mind
In my mind, mind, mind, mind, mind)

Whoa, whoa
This a mean world, cold world
Baby, who's to blame?
I took a long night drive
105 down to PCH
Won't let your garden die
Girl, tonight I'ma make it rain
My natural habitat
I like to live inside your brain

My natural habitat is you
Always lived inside it
You said, "Stick around for once"
But it made me feel stuck
We went fast first night
They said, "Step into the light"
But I'm married to the night
Leave that bitch then bring it back
Don't know if I'm comin'

We was in love
We was on drugs
I was havin' fun
It was everything
Turn you on, huh
I was on her
She was on me
That's on everything

Yeah
That's on everything, yeah
That's on everything
She want my last name, but I can't give her no wedding ring
I'm way too raged out, I walk around wit' that Hennessy
Kerosene, kerosene, kerosene
Bitch, I'm flammable, whoa, just like gasoline
I'm international, I'm doin' shows overseas
Just be cautious 'cause I walk around with a Glock 40
These niggas copy the swag, huh, yeah, they forging me
Ain't doin' that shit if I don't wanna do it, it ain't no forcin' me
If me and my bitch get into it, I tell that ho to leave
I love that bitch to death but not more than I love my X
It's lil' X and I pop X, bitch, I'on sleep
I'm creepin' up the street, we four deep and I'm in the Trackhawk Jeep
I got her location but she ain't got mine 'cause ain't no trackin' me
Yeah, yeah

My natural habitat is you
Always lived inside it, yeah
You said, "Stick around for once"
But it made me feel stuck
We went fast first night
They said, "Step into the light"
But I'm married to the night
Leave that bitch then bring it back
Don't know if I'm comin'

Don't know if I'm comin'
Don't know if I'm comin'
Don't-don't-don't-don't-don't-don't
Don't-don't-don't-don't-don't-don't
Don't know if I'm comin'
Don't know if I'm comin'
Don't-don't-don't-don't-don't-don't
Don't-don't-don't-don't-don't-don't
