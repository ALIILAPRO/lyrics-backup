		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Leave me dreaming on the bed
See you right back here tomorrow
For the next round.

Keep this scene inside your head
As the bruises turn to yellow
The swelling goes down.

And if you're ever around
In the city or the suburbs
Of this town
Be sure to come around
I'll be wallowing in sorrow
Wearing a frown
Like Pierrot the clown.

Saw you crashing around the bay
Never seen you act so shallow
Or look so brown.

Remember all the thing's you'd say
How your promises rang hollow
As you threw me into the ground.

And if you're ever around
In the city or the suburbs
Of this town
Be sure to come around
I'll be wallowing in sorrow
Wearing a frown
Like Pierrot the clown.

When I dream , I dream your lips
When I dream , I dream your kiss
When I dream , I dream your fists
Your fists, your fists.

Leave me bleeding on the bed
See you right back here tomorrow
For the next round.

Keep this scene inside your head
As the bruises turn to yellow
The swelling goes down.

And if you're ever around
In the city or the suburbs
Of this town
Be sure to come around
I'll be wallowing in sorrow
Wearing a frown
Like Pierrot the clown.
