		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here we go, we're back, put the bass up
It's a pain that I can't stand anymore
I remember the fear but I want to live my life the way that I've chosen to
GET UP!

I think I was afraid then, but didn't want to face it
My brain isn't fucked up yet
I CAN'T even believe how long it fucking takes to shatter
It fucking takes to break
Oh god you made me feel so worthless
I've started to become heartless
We're both falling to the ground and there will be no escape
STAY AWAY

You're faking all these tears
DON'T FUCK WITH ME
You've started to bring out the worst in me

I don't want it and I don't need
This is the worst of you and me
Hold me tighter, I still breathe
No i can't believe everything you've done to me

Struggling with some fears and second thoughts
It reminds me how fuckin' hard it is to find some relief
I wish I had forgotten every piece of you every reason
But you're kind of a ghost crawling deep inside my soul
And it's a whole new night for you and I
But the same nightmare that goes around
And I'm going to break every chain that binds us
All the things that keeps us down

You're faking all these tears
DON'T FUCK WITH ME
You've started to bring out the worst in me

I don't want it and I don't need
This is the worst of you and me
Hold me tighter, I still breathe
No i can't believe everything you've done to me

Don't watch me you have done enough
Feel the shake in my own voice
So lonely... I know...
We are so lonely I know... We are...

You were looking for failures
You dug on the surface but you didn't go deeper
I remember the fears but your face is a ghost
Don't say anything if you're afraid of what it costs

Now i'm feeling is so tired
Have we gone too far?
Tell me there is something that will never return
Places become empty and so lonely again
Cause this is the worst of you and me

You better wake me up but you're afraid of what it costs

Tell me there is something that will never return
Places becomes empty and so lonely again
Don't say anything if you're afraid of what it costs
Cause this is the worst of you and me
