		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ain't no mountain high
Ain't no valley low,
Ain't no river wide enough, baby

If you need me, call me,
No matter where you are
No matter how far,
Don't worry, baby
Just call my name, I'll be there in a hurry
You don't have to worry
...
Remember the day I set you free
I told you, you could always count on me, darling
And from that day on I made a vow
I'll be there when you want me some way, some how

'Cause baby, there ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough,
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from getting to you, baby
