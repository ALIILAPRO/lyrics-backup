		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My father told me
It's a beautiful life
So make sure you
always open up your eyes

To all the adventures
Go against the tide 
Before you know it 
you'll be running out of time

You should fight for who you wanna be 
Don't look back on what it could've been 
You'll find it 
You'll find it 

You could make your way across the sea 
Find new places you ain't never been 
Now I believe 
Now I believe 

I'll live a life that's filled with stories to be told
I'll make it through the darkness and make sure I'm coming home

Even if I'm walking all alone
I'm always coming home 
I'm always coming home

My father told me
It's a beautiful life
So make sure you
always open up your eyes

To all the adventures
Go against the tide 
Before you know it 
you'll be running out of time

You should fight for who you wanna be 
Don't look back on what it could've been 
You'll find it 
You'll find it 

You could make your way across the sea 
Find new places you ain't never been 
Now I believe 
Now I believe 

I'll live a life that's filled with stories to be told
I'll make it through the darkness and make sure I'm coming home

Even if I'm walking all alone
I'm always coming home 
I'm always coming home

I'm always coming home 
I'm always coming home

I'm always coming home 
I'm always coming home
