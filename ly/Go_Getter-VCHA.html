		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Excuse me
Am I crazy or is this a movie?
Been waiting for this moment 'cause I'm choosy
But if I feel this way, it must be meant to be (uh-huh)
I switch it up, it's not Romeo and Juliet
Who says it can't be Juliet and Romeo?
I'll sing underneath his balcony
Boombox, throwing rocks up at his window

Trust me, I don't do this often
But when I do, I'm all in
Just in case you're wondering why I'm here

I'm a go-getter (go, go, go, go)
I just go get it (go, go, go, go)
I get what I want, no sweating (go, go, go, go)
On me, I'm betting (go, go, go, go)
I get what I want, go-getter

Go, go, go, go, I go and get it
Go, go, go, go, I go and get it
Go, go, go, go, I go and get it
Go, go, go, go, I go and get it

Tell me, baby
Should I bite my tongue or should I keep it going?
I could talk forever, like a mile a minute
Something deep inside of me won't let me quit it
All you gotta do is just

Trust me, I know what you're feeling
Don't be scared to lean in
Just follow my lead and let me in

I'm a go-getter (go, go, go, go)
I just go get it (go, go, go, go)
I get what I want, no sweating (go, go, go, go)
On me, I'm betting (go, go, go, go)
I get what I want, go-getter

Anything I want, I'm gonna put in my bag
If I let it go, I'm gonna get it right back
Everybody know that I do it like that
Do it like that, do it like that
Throw you like a boomerang, coming right back
Know I look good and you want it real bad
Everybody know that I do it like that
Do it like that, do it like that

I'm a go-getter (go, go, go, go)
I just go get it (go, go, go, go)
I get what I want, no sweating (go, go, go, go)
On me, I'm betting (go, go, go, go)
I get what I want, go-getter

Go, go, go, go, I go and get it
Go, go, go, go, I go and get it
Go, go, go, go, I go and get it
Go, go, go, go, go, I go and get it
