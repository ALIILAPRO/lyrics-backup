		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You are overly sensitive, so I won't say much
But my heart gets pulled into pieces
Whenever you're poured up

You are malevolent and benevolent
You are the devil that I revel in

I barely recognize you when you wake up in the morning
Must be someone else's eyes that I look into every night
You're only kind when you're all fucked up
You're only mine till your high is gone
But I wish you'd still love me
When your drugs wear off in the morning

I come second to every Percocet that you take, and I know
You want someone who worship the worst of your mistakes

You are malevolent and benevolent
You owe me nothing and everything

I barely recognize you when you wake up in the morning
Must be someone else's eyes that I look into every night
You're only kind when you're all fucked up
You're only mine till your high is gone
But I wish you'd still love me
When your drugs wear off in the morning

You, you, you, you
You, you (you are, you are, you are)
You, you (you are, you are, you are)

I barely recognize you when you wake up in the morning
Must be someone else's eyes that I look into every night
You're only kind when you're all fucked up
You're only mine till your high is gone
So maybe I should leave before
Your drugs wear off in the morning
