		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's the middle of the night
What the fuck I'm gonna do
I don't wanna get high
I don't wanna get used

Turning inside out when I'm here with you
You question everything
Making me feel like I'm no good

'Cause baby all you know
You know I drink the water
I should have seen the signs
'Cause you never called your mother
Backed up in a world
Couldn't see any other
Maybe love is blind
But I think I had enough

So I, I, I don't need you
I don't need your lies
Better of a loner
Than fighting all the time
Breaking down the silence
Before you start to cry
I was just a lover
Lovers say goodbye
Lovers say goodbye
Ah, ah, ah
Lovers say goodbye

Got a little uptight
Got a little confused
I can lose my mind when I'm close to you
It's the middle of the night
What the fuck I'm gonna do (oh)
I don't wanna waste time
I don't wanna be rude

'Cause baby all you know
You know I drink the water
I should have seen the signs
'Cause you never called your mother
Backed up in a world
Couldn't see any other
Maybe love is blind
But I think I had enough

So I, I, I don't need you
I don't need your lies
Better of a loner
Than fighting all the time
Breaking down the silence
Before you start to cry

I was just a lover
Lovers say goodbye
Lovers say goodbye
Ah, ah, ah
Lovers say goodbye
Ah, ah, ah
Lovers say goodbye
Ah, ah, ah
Lovers say goodbye
Lovers say goodbye
