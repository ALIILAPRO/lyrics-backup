		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Jahlil Beats) uh

When I made it rich, I went and bought a Bentley, bitch (bitch)
Walk into Saks Fifth like, "Give me that and give me this" (gimme that)
That's your Wednesday crush, you know Lil' Fish done hit that shit, uh (shit)
You ain't gotta tell me, I know niggas envious, uh (hey)
Count the cash while my lil' bitch bounce her ass (bounce that ass)
Richard Mille cost one-fifty, that's your stash (that's your stash)
Poppin' shit on Instagram, that's your past (that's your what?)
When we catch you out in traffic, just don't crash (brr, brr, brr)
I got a bag, I'm doin' the most, you niggas is lame, I am the GOAT
They want the gas, I'm givin' 'em smoke, jump off the jet, get on the boat
I'm in a yacht, I'm with a thot, she givin' me throat, aw, shit
Cut off the top, Rolls Royce drop, I get Ghost, skrt
Pull up in a, "What the fuck was that?", Ho (that, ho)
We still throwin' supermodels off the back, bro (back, bro)
Alley-oop my bitch to Harden, I give her back, bro (back, bro)
And you better not send my bitch back with her back broke, gang (back broke)

First thing on my mind when I wake up is a check
In the trenches with my slimes, they be trippin' off the X
When I'm gone off these drugs, I don't think about my ex
And I ain't know that ho for long, she asked for Audemar Piguet

(Oh) you want some diamonds, you don't want no bag, you think you're bougie, huh?
And you don't want no Fashion Nova, you want some Gucci, huh?
And when we out, I can't be seen 'cause I don't know who you fucked
And why she think she playin' me? This shit be groupie love
(Oh) I think I'm bougie
Mike Amiri jeans cost me two Gs
I can't take her to the crib, go get some room keys
(Oh) I think I'm bougie

Came a long way from the trenches, ridin' CTA
From the chopper to the jet, it look like GTA
And they say I won't be shit, ain't make my GPA
And I heard his ass a rat, I'm sippin' T-E-A (oh)
I thought you was my B-O-Y, but your ass D-E-A
I used to walk with a .22 inside my Kenzo
Paperwork came back too dirty, gotta keep your head low
If he too loud and he too wild, then he get paid for (oh)
I know some niggas that take your head off for that bankroll
Lawyer money up to my dogs, then this case closed
Boy, you just start sippin', we sold him Karo
I popped some X, I was geekin', I DM'd J. Lo (oh)
Jimmy Kimmel in Chicago, pull up, late shows
They put Lil' Vernie in that chair, you know he ate those
Niggas jumpin' dick to dick, man, I hate those
I remember I put a dime inside a Faygo

First thing on my mind when I wake up is a check
In the trenches with my slimes, they be trippin' off the X
When I'm gone off these drugs, I don't think about my ex
And I ain't know that ho for long, she asked for Audemar Piguet

(Oh) you want some diamonds, you don't want no bag, you think you're bougie, huh?
And you don't want no Fashion Nova, you want some Gucci, huh?
And when we out, I can't be seen 'cause I don't know who you fucked
And why she think she playin' me? This shit be groupie love
(Oh) I think I'm bougie
Mike Amiri jeans cost me two Gs
I can't take her to the crib, go get some room keys
(Oh) I think I'm bougie
