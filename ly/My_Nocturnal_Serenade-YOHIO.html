		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everything I know is the melodies and symphonies
Everything I know is a life without light
(I will always be alone)
There's a longing inside my soul
And in the deepest void where time is but a scenery
I'll be waiting for you

Darling look into my eyes and tell me what's inside
Truth be told my dear, you don't know what it's like to leave it all behind
Take a step into the night, 
hear the voices singing la la la la la""
Dancing gracefully to the beat of your heart
Until the morning comes to steal you away

All I ever knew was that you and me were meant to be
All I ever knew was the taste of your lips against mine
(You are mine forevermore)
We were bound for eternity
Now I am lost inside this everlasting reverie 
And I'm losing my mind

Darling look into my eyes and tell me what's inside
Truth be told my dear, you don't know what it's like to leave it all behind
Take a step into the night, 
hear the voices singing la la la la la
Come away with me through the echoes of time
Until the morning comes to steal you away

Darling look into my eyes and tell me what's inside
Truth be told my dear, you don't know what it's like...

Take a step into the night, 
hear the voices singing la la la la la
Come away with me through the echoes of time
Until the morning comes to steal you away
So you looked into my eyes and brought me back to life
I still think of you in the dark of the night 
A silent lullaby
I'll be waiting here 'til the end of all days
My nocturnal serenade
