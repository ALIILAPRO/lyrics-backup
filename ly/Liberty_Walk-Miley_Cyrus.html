		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't live a lie
This is your one life
Don't live a lie
You won't get lost
Just walk, just walk

Here's for the ones tryna hold you back
Tryna make you feel like your less than that
Give you nothin' more better than to make you crack
But really tryna put your dreams off track
And you'll know in the end it'll be okay
Cause all that really matters are the steps you take
And everything else falls into place
There's no price to pay, I say

We're alright, alright, yea, yea.
We're gonna get it, when we live it, live it
We're alright, alright, yea, yea.
We're gonna get it, when we live it.

It's a liberty walk, walk.
Say goodbye to the people who tied you up
It's a liberty walk, walk.
Feeling your heart again
Breathing new oxygen
It's a liberty walk, walk
Free yourself and don't let the breathing stop anymore
Liberty, liberty li-li liberty liberty li-li
It's a liberty walk, walk.

Don't stop, keep on walking
Don't stop, keep on talking
Don't stop, keep on walking

Don't be afraid to make a move
It won't hurt you
Just do what you were born to do
And everything works that way
Don't listen to all the people who hate
Cause all they do is help make your mistakes for yeah
But they don't own ya
I just told ya

Don't stop, keep on walking
Don't stop, keep on talking
Don't stop, keep on walking

We're alright, alright. Yea, yea.
We're gonna get it, when we live it, live it
We're alright, alright. Yea, yea
We're gonna get it, when we live it.

It's a liberty walk, walk.
Say goodbye to the people who tied you up
It's a liberty walk, walk.
Feeling your heart again
Breathing new oxygen
It's a liberty walk, walk
Free yourself and don't let the breathing stop anymore
Liberty, liberty li-li liberty liberty li-li
It's a liberty walk, walk.

Just walk this way!
Don't like, don't like, don't like, don't like
Don't like what you do
Don't take the abuse
Move to the truth
People come on make some

It's a liberty walk, walk.
Say goodbye to the people who tied you up
It's a liberty walk, walk.
Feeling your heart again
Breathing new oxygen
It's a liberty walk, walk
Free yourself and don't let the breathing stop anymore
Liberty, liberty li-li liberty liberty li-li
It's a liberty walk, walk.

Don't stop, keep on walking
Don't stop, keep on talking
Don't stop, keep on walking
Walk walk walk
Don't stop, keep on walking
Don't stop, keep on talking
Don't stop, keep on walking
Walk walk walk
