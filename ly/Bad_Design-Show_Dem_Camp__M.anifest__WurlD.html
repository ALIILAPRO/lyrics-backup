		  Design
(Oh, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Tola, guy you care na
If you didn't care, you wouldn't be spending twelve bars 
(Oh, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Talking about how much you don't care

So bad
Whoa, you do me so bad
Oh, babe, you do me so bad
Whoa, you do me so bad
Thought you were designed for me (designed, designed)
Thought you were designed for me (designed, designed)
Thought you'll stick around for me (stick around, around)
Thought you'll stick around for me (yeah)

You're so bad, that's no cap
I found love with no catch
I go deep, you hold back
The good times, they go fast
We fall in, you go back
We slow down, we gon' crash
You sef know, it's so sad
We can't face the blow back
And each time we go back I feel scared it won't last (design)
I feel scared I no match for this task, I relapse
Is this jazz? (Design)
Did she cast some kind spell? Will it pass?
My boys laugh like C-Track, just sit back and relax
Guy, hmm (design)
In this moment I just can't refrain (can't refrain)
Control, alt, delete but nothing's changed (but nothing's changed)
I feel shackled, tryna break the chains (tryna break the chains)
Tryna reason how you can't into my life and did me

So bad (so bad)
Whoa, you do me so bad (so bad)
Oh, babe, you do me so bad (so bad)
Whoa, you do me so bad
Thought you were designed for me (designed, designed)
Thought you were designed for me (designed, designed)
Thought you'll stick around for me (stick around, around)
Thought you'll stick around for me

So bad (so bad)
Whoa, you do me so bad (so bad)
Oh, babe, you do me so bad (so bad)
Whoa, you do me so bad
Thought you were designed for me (designed, designed)
Thought you were designed for me (designed, designed)
Thought you'll stick around for me (stick around, around)
Thought you'll stick around for me

Was blinded by blind faith
I gave trust, you gave rage
I'm in bed for four days
The cold tears, my poor face
You didn't text, I'm upset
I forget, this old age
The old doors got new locks
In this icebox my heart based , uh
Just be careful how you moving careless (moving careless)
Texting me these nudies that's just rude endeavors (rude endeavors)
Everything was everything or at least so I thought (so I thought)
If you needed something, e go be me at sort (e go be me)
All of these buried memories still alive to me
Now there's nothing on this timeline that I wish to see
She don dey post, she don dey tweet, ig hawking me
Even Elon's billions couldn't mask this pain you do me

So bad (so bad)
Whoa, you do me so bad (so bad)
Oh, babe, you do me so bad (so bad)
Whoa, you do me so bad
Thought you were designed for me (designed, designed)
Thought you were designed for me (designed, designed)
Thought you'll stick around for me (stick around, around)
Thought you'll stick around for me

Everything you want I pay for it
Everything you ask I work for it
Say if I love you I'd kill your you
Say if I love you I'd die for you
When I ain't got it, you cheat on me
When I ain't got it, you lied to me
Say many men go die for you
Now I just dey pray for you
Why you tryna shoot me down? 
You put me, put me under pressure
Why you tryna kill my vibe?
You tryna push me to depression
Tryna make me jealous but I no dey for your level
Make you dey your side, make I dey my side, yeah

(Oh, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Oh, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
