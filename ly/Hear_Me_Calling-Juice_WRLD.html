		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ring, do you hear me calling?
(Purps On The Beat)
Me no want no drama

Do you hear me calling?
Do you hear me calling?
Me no want no drama
Not a fighter, a lover
Do you hear me calling?
Do you hear me calling?
Me no want no drama
I just want you, my darling

Breakaway, and make a way to make it
Love the way you lookin' when you naked
Treat your heart just like a blunt, of OG
Roll it up, I kissed it and I smoke you
Gots to be joking
Where in the fuck did you think you were going?
Foldin' and packin' your clothes like you ain't know I was gon' unfold it
Wine glass full of your emotions
Oh, Pinot Grigio, sippin', beautiful, heaven-soul woman
He don't know, let me know, let me
In your heart, don't you dare forget me
I'm your fan, yo' posters on my walls inside my head, yeah, yeah
I'm your fan, yo' posters on my walls inside my head, yeah

Do you hear me calling?
Do you hear me calling?
Me no want no drama
Not a fighter, a lover
Do you hear me calling?
Do you hear me calling?
Me no want no drama
I just want you, my darling

You drive me insane, no girl make me feel this way
Wait girl, you got your ways, girl you are my getaway
Wait, let me keep you safe
In exchange, give me brain brain
You my main thing, turn around, bang bang
Hit the beach in LA like you a beach ball
Me and you in the Lambo truck, you start it up and skrrt off
We park after dark at the park by the mansion, take your skirt off
Oh, me can't wait to get all up inside of it
My heart is racing, every time I'm tastin' it
Wait until the drugs fade out
Hate making love when I'm faded
That's because I wanna feel it
Girl, you give me the best feelin'
Yes, girl you're the best, take away stress, love me to death
Even when I'm a mess

Ring, do you hear me calling?
Me no want no drama
Do you hear me calling?
Do you hear me calling?
Me no want no drama
Not a fighter, a lover
Do you hear me calling?
Do you hear me calling?
Me no want no drama
I just want you, my darling

Ring, do you hear me calling?
Me no want no drama
Ring, do you hear me calling?
Me no want no drama
