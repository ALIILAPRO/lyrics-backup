		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They call me an American horror

Ohh
Ohh
Ohh
Ohh

What I gotta do to find a sub who down to choke me?
Tie me up and hold me down and get a little dirty
Haven't tasted boujee spit since homie hit on Thursday
I'll be there in 30 'cause a bitch is getting thirsty

Got you in a chokehold 'til your turning blue
Down to blow a bag and my back out too
Like an older man cause he know just what to do
I'm a plan B regular bitch

Monster
I'm a stone cold monster
I could be your little monster
I'm a stone cold monster
I could be your little

I kiss freaks that treat me like an animal
Fuck on me and eat me like a cannibal
I'm miss fish, that Rocky Horror Picture hoe
They call me an American Horror Show (ohh)
Ohh (ohh)
Show (ohh)
They call me an American Horror Show

Hey baby
I like when you piss me off
Hey baby
Usually means the sex is rough
Hey baby
Take a picture when we fuck
Hey baby
I think we should blow it up

It's a freak show, baby, I'm a ring leader
Like an acrobat in a dark arena
I could dance both ways like a ballerina
Caught an emo bitch, she my man-eater

Monster
I'm a stone cold monster
I could be your little monster
I'm a stone cold monster
I could be your little

I kiss freaks that treat me like an animal
Fuck on me and eat me like a cannibal
I'm miss fish, that Rocky Horror Picture hoe
They call me an American Horror Show (ohh)
Ohh (ohh)
Show (ohh)
They call me an American Horror Show

(Ohh)
(Ohh)
(Ohh)
They call me an American Horror Show
