		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Call out in the middle of the night
For when else would I hear you?
Fall out in the cold starlight
I can save you if you do

You will never walk alone
You can always reach me
You will never ever walk alone

Call me Little Sunshine
Call me, call me Mephistopheles
Call me when you feel all alone
Just call me Little Sunshine

Light up in the middle of the day
For how else could you see me?
Ease up to the hunter from the prey
And transform indefinitely

You will never walk alone
You can always reach me
You will never ever walk alone

Call me Little Sunshine
Call me, call me Mephistopheles
Call me when you feel all alone
Just call me Little Sunshine

You will never walk alone
You can always reach me
You will never ever walk alone
You will never walk alone
You can always reach me
You will never ever walk alone
You will never walk alone
You can always reach me
You will never ever walk alone
Even when you're dead and gone
You can always reach me
All you gotta do is call me, call me

Call me Little Sunshine
Call me, call me Mephistopheles
Call me when you feel all alone
Just call me Little Sunshine

Call me Little Sunshine
Call me, call me Mephistopheles
Call me when you feel all alone
Just call me Little Sunshine
