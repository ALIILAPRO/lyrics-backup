		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You look through
There on your face, the way that you say the things that you do
I've been through
All of the games, all of the ways that you been fooled

I know I seen your face
In different time and places

Come get a little closer
I wanna get to know ya
We ain't keeping no secrets
Start with our sheets between us tonight
Talk to me let's go deeper
You already know I need ya
We ain't keeping no secrets
I wanna see you leave on the lights
Talk to me, talk to me
Talk to me, talk to me
Talk to me, talk to me
Talk to me, talk to me
Talk to me

Say your peace
The words that come out, out of your mouth, I wanna hear
We can't be
Something divine, planets align
Where we should be

I know I seen your face
In different time and places
Come get a little closer
I wanna get to know ya
We ain't keeping no secrets
Start with our sheets between us tonight
Talk to me let's go deeper
You already know I need ya
We ain't keeping no secrets
I wanna see you leave on the lights
Talk to me, talk to me

Baby in my head
We can love forever
Here in my bed
Where we lay together

Come get a little closer
I wanna get to know ya
We ain't keeping no secrets
Start with our sheets between us tonight
Talk to me let's go deeper
You already know I need ya
We ain't keeping no secrets
I wanna see you leave on the lights
Talk to me, talk to me
Talk to me, talk to me
Talk to me, talk to me
Talk to me, talk to me
Talk to me
