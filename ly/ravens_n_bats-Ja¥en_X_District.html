		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Close my eyes and i'll stop existing 
A drift of leaves and the trees are listening
I see your shade never shall dismiss it
Cause you're my blade heart for recondition
Starless i see from above
Below lays my own carcass
Light can be easy to love
So darling show me your darkness

Oh the day is ivory black
Blood is in the cadillac
Silver blade inside my back
Tell me baby where you at
You're my ravens n my bats
You make every second last
Lend me all the spells u casts
You're the reason that i'll last oh

You're my ravens n my bats ohh
You're the reason that i'll last oh
You're my ravens n my bats ohh
And the reason that i'll last oh

You are no longer here nah uh 
You chose to disappear yeah ah
Faintly i still i feel ur presence 
You're someone that can't be forgotten 
Had you in my grip but then i lost it 
Wandering around got me exhausted 
With my dark entities
I'm after everything that i know that is bad for me
That's  you

Oh the day is ivory black
Blood is in the cadillac
Silver blade inside my back
Tell me baby where you at
You're my ravens n my bats
You make every second last
Lend me all the spells u casts
You're the reason that i'll last oh

You're my ravens n my bats ohh
You're the reason that i'll last oh
You're my ravens n my bats ohh
And the reason that i'll last oh
