		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I told you on the phone 
I told you I was trouble, man
When we were both alone
I told you I was trouble, man
You got into my car
I don't care what you are is what you said to me back then
I told you in my car
I told you I was trouble, man

The summer of the crash 
The winter of survival mode
You saw it in a flash 
We're entering survival mode
I said you never learn
You signaled as you turned onto the wrong and binding road
That summer of the crash 
That winter of survival mode

Do you remember when we thought the world was ending?
Seems funny now
The future is a text message sending 
Out, out, out
I live forever in sunset 
An ending not quite done yet
Some people don't understand that

You thought you understood 
When you said you believed in me
I'm lost out here for good 
But you said you believed in me
I didn't think to ask, the tank was full of gas 
Pulled onto highway 93
The sun was in your eyes 
You thought you could believe in me

A burning cigarette, an animal that digs for warmth
Assessing all that's left 
A burning urge to dig for warmth
There is no news to get 
The certain sense of threat is all that keeps us driving North
You've got me in your arms
Maybe that's all we need for warmth

Do you remember when we thought the world was ending?
Seems funny now
The future is a text message sending 
Out, out, out
I live forever in sunset 
An ending not quite done yet
Some people don't understand that
