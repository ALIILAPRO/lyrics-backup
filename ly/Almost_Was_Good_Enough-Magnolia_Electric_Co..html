		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Almost was good enough (once).


It's been hard doing anything
Winter's stuck around so long
I kept trying anyhow and I'm still trying now
Just to keep working, just to keep working.

I remember when it didn't use to be so hard
This used to be impossible
A new season has to begin
I can feel it leaning in whispering
"Nothing's lonely now"
Nothing anymore in pain.

A tall shadow dressed how secrets always dress
When they want everyone to know that they're around.
Leaning in whispering 
"My friend over there don't know what he's talking about."

Did you really believe, come one, did you really believe
That everyone makes it out?
Almost no one makes it out.
Almost no one makes it out.
Almost no one makes it out.
I'm going to us that street to hide
From that human doubt 
To hide from what was shining and has finally burned us out.
Almost no one makes it out.
Almost no one makes it out.

No one makes it out
You're talking to one right now
For once almost was good enough
