		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This story's missing a wishing well
No mirror to show and tell
No kiss that can break the spell
I'm falling asleep

Every prince is a fantasy
The witch is inside of me
Her poison will wash away
The memory

We kill the lights and put on a show
It's all a lie but you'd never know
Your star will shine and then it will fall
And you will forget it all

And after midnight we're all the same
No glass shoe to bring us fame
Nobody to take the blame
We're falling apart

Every story's a waiting game
A flower for every name
Their colors are paling
In the falling rain

We kill the lights and put on a show
It's all a lie but you'd never know
Your star will shine and then it will fall
And you will forget it all

Now you know it's so much better to pretend
There's something waiting for you here
Every letter that you wrote
Has found its way to me, my dear

You can make believe that
What you say is what I want to hear
I'll keep dancing through this beautiful
Delusional career

Faking every tear
Looking like a compromised suicide
Keeping all my dreams alive
