		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dirty little secret
Dirty little lies
Say your prayers and comb your hair
Save your soul tonight

Drift among the faithful
Bury your desires
Aberrations fill your head
You need a place to hide
And I am

Do you remember me?
The kid I used to be?
Do you remember me?

When your world comes crashing down
I want to be there
If God is looking down on me
I'm not Jesus
Jesus wasn't there

You confess it all away
But it's only shit to me
If God is looking down on me
I'm not Jesus
I will not forgive

No I won't
No I won't

I've thought you were a good man
I've thought you talked to God
You Hippocratic, messianic, child abusing, turned satanic

Do you remember me?
Do you remember me?
The kid I used to be?
Do you remember?
Do you remember?

When your own world comes undone
Let me be the one to say
(If God is looking down on me)
I'm not Jesus
You can't run away

And the innocence you spoil
Found a way to live
If God is looking down on me
I'm not Jesus
I will not forgive

I will not forgive
I won't be whatever you want to
I will not forgive
I won't be whatever you want to

Do you remember me?
The kid I used to be?
Not the same as I used to be
Oh, do you remember me?

No

When your world comes crashing down
I want to be there
If God is looking down on me
I'm not Jesus
Jesus wasn't there

You confess it all away
But it only shit to me
If God is looking down on me
I'm not Jesus
I will not
I'm not Jesus
I will not forgive

Oh, I will not forgive, yeah yeah
No, I will not forgive
