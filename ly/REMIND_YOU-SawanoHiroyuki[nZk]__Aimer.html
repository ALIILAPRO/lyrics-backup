		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Who passed away each one
in the fight
There was no doubt we started
for pride
And your grief stays too long
Then the war brings it worst
Tell me why? we're stuck
in this deep black hole
Count it from me
No one knows our day'll be
Don't be afraid everyone will
reach for last
Nothing but without you
I can not go on
Now I'm touching to the core
of the light
Sharing with you for a while
tiny moment
All I can give you
for some help
Just reminds you

Who passed away each one
for the fight
There was no doubt we dreamt
of the ride
And your grief stays too long
Then the war brings it worst
Now we searching for under
the hope with you
Count it from me
My heart beat get slower
Don't be surprise everyone
will die at last
Nothing but without you
I can not go on
Now I'm looking for the place
to belong

Past to the present
Slave to the power
Into my brain
From top to the bottom
all over my skin
All of me is lashed
with high fever
Don't say just yes, Oh no
matter what they have made up
All the things must fix them
by your self
Past to the present
Slave to the power
But is our
Bravely from desire
Quest for the future
