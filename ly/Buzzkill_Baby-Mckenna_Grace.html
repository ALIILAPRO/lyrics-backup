		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Are you happy now that I'm so miserable?
Isn't that what you wanted from me?
Sadly, your love was conditional
You like to pick me apart like daisies

Left me crying in the bathroom on my birthday
Wish I never even met you in the first place
Now you only keep my number just to hurt me
You're leaving me all alone

You're such a buzzkill
Now I'm second guessing those three words I said out loud
Ohh, you're such a buzzkill baby
It's almost impressive how much you still stress me out
Ohh, you're such a buzzkill baby
You suck the air out of the room
And you cut the deepest kind of wounds
Honestly depressing how much you can bring me down
Ohh, you're such a buzzkill baby

Now you text me, 2AM on Saturday
You say you're liking my music lately
Almost had me with your shallow flattery
You've really pulled off a full one-eighty

Left me crying in the bathroom on my birthday
Wish I never even met you in the first place
Now you only keep my number just to hurt me
You're leaving me all alone

You're such a buzzkill
Now I'm second guessing those three words I said out loud
Ohh, you're such a buzzkill baby
It's almost impressive how much you still stress me out
Ohh, you're such a buzzkill baby
You suck the air out of the room
And you cut the deepest kind of wounds
Honestly depressing how much you can bring me down
Ohh, you're such a buzzkill baby

You're, you're, you're, you're, you're
Ohh, you're such a buzzkill baby
You're, you're, you're, you're, you're
Ohh, you're such a buzzkill baby

I am happy, does that make you miserable?
I wonder whose buzz you're killing lately
Almost had me, I cried like a funeral
I watched you pick me apart like daisies

You're such a buzzkill
Now I'm second guessing those three words I said out loud
Ohh, you're such a buzzkill baby
It's almost impressive how much you still stress me out
Ohh, you're such a buzzkill baby
You suck the air out of the room
And you cut the deepest kind of wounds
Honestly depressing how much you can bring me down
Ohh, you're such a buzzkill baby
