		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I call to mind a love that fades
Your pink cashmere summer nights (summer nights, summer nights)
Your mama's house, a place to hide
I kissed you there, you open wide

You must know that I miss your stare (I do)
You mesmerised me daily, ah
You must know that I miss you here
Hypnotise me

You sang to me, an eye to eye
A melody so undefined
I met you in the velvet light
Who knew we'd ever say goodnight

You must know that I miss your stare
You mesmerised me daily, ah
Do you recall when I kissed you there?
Hypnotize me
