		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There are so many things I could say, my love 
Make you trip so your lips would be mine
There are so many things I could do, my love
To convince you my love is divine

There are so many words I could tell you
There are so many moments in time

But I say 'fore we go to the land down below
If I tell you I love you -- I'm lying

There are so many places to go, my love
There are so many places to find
There are so many worlds to explore, my love
There are so many stars yet to shine

There are so many secrets to tell you
There are so many men on the line

But I say 'fore we go to the land down below
If I tell you "I love you" -- I'm lying

I may be show to reason 
To call you up next time
So if you like your women sweet 
Consider me your wine

?
To call you when you're flyin'
But if I ever utter "I love you"
Honey, I am mine

And if I look into your eyes and tell you
"Honey, I am blind"

If I ever whisper words unheard, so sensuous
"Je t'aime, ah oui, je t'aime"
