		  Bones
Bones
Broken
I've been so broken
You just don't see from my side
Open
Try to be open
You just don't know what it's like
Feels like I'm falling
I can't seem to catch myself
Help me out
Had my back
Then you let go
I'm fighting without you
I'm standing alone
Just like that
You left me cold
I guess at the end of the day
It's just me and my bones
Closer
Try to get closure
Still haven't figured it out
(Figured it out)
Oceans
Taking me under
Feelings are keeping me down
Had my back
Then you let go
I'm fighting without you
I'm standing alone
Just like that
You left me cold
I guess at the end of the day
It's just me and my
Bones
Bones
(My bones)
I guess at the end of the day
It's just me and my
Bones
Bones
(My bones)
I guess at the end of the day
It's just me and my
Bones
Bones
Bones
Bones
Bones
Bones
Bones
Bones
Bones
