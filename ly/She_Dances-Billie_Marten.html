		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh my lonely heart, she could hang around for days
Will never leave the house, something more than just a phase
She'd eat occasionally, just like she would when she's alone
She'll play the game for free until she dies, until she dies

She howls she dances
She howls as she does
She howls as she dances
She howls as she does
Just like a wolf

And as she reads aloud, ankles hanging off the bed
She'll read to nobody, or was it something that she said?
She is like the trees, the sun that creeps through my window
She knows her body, the kind that turns you into gold

She howls as she dances
She howls as she does
She howls as she dances
She howls as she does
Just like a wolf

And I'm jealous of her feet
The way she runs from nobody
The way she walks right through the sea
And how she'll make you weep

Oh my lonely heart, she could hang around for days
Will never leave the house, something more than just a phase
She'd eat occasionally, just as she likes
She'll play the game for free until she dies, until she dies

Mmm mmm mmm
Mmm mmm mmm
Mmm mmm mmm
Mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm
