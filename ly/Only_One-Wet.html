		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And I never knew a feeling so good
Then gone all at once to someone else
And the feelings of God, come down all at once
I've lost you to the warmth of another sun

Nights so long, feel so strong
I'm holding on, even though you're not alone
Drive so far, I'm in your car
There's something wrong
I feel it coming on

Can you tell me I'm the only one
Only one, only one?
Can you tell me I'm the only one
Only one, only one?
Can you tell me I'm the only one
Only one, only one? (Only one)
Can you tell me I'm the only one
Only one, only one? (Only one)

And I don't have the energy that I once had
And I don't have it in me to start again
Hands on my body, feel so exotic
I can feel the leather
With the drop-top down and you're tryna pull over

Can you tell me I'm the only one
Only one, only one?
Can you tell me I'm the only one
Only one, only one?
Can you tell me I'm the only one
Only one, only one? (Only one)
Can you tell me I'm the only one
Only one, only one? (Only one)

And I don't have the energy that I once had
And I don't have it in me to start again

Can you tell me I'm the only one
Only one, only one?
Can you tell me I'm the only one
Only one, only one?
Can you tell me I'm the only one
Only one, only one?
Can you tell me I'm the only one
Only one, only one?
