		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  While I was standing in the room
I felt some pleasure and a pain
I want to share

A taxi pulls up to the curb
Some shifting thoughts lay
Undisturbed
I get in thinking what I might do

[Chorus]
Uncertainty twisting your desire
I come to you in black taxis
And wish you inside
I wish you inside

As moving slowly to your home
To give you all that is your own
It will be soon and you will know

Just for a moment I'm displaced
But when I look into your face
I would see all that I would too

[Chorus]

Dark thoughts are closer than before
As I get out closing the door
Bringing gifts of fear to you

It won't be long before I show
That fear is all that's left to go
For here the tale will come to a close

[Chorus:Repeat x2]
