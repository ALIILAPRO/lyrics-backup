		  (Got got got)
Got sugar in my bloodstream
I'm drippy with the icing
They say I'm sweet like ice cream
But I'll rip your heart out smiling

Bang bang bang
You know your lips taste like champagne
Yeah, your kiss is bittersweet
I be addicted to your taste
Boom, boom, boom, my flower only bloom for you
It be us against the world
Ride or die straight to my tomb
One, two, three, do you got me?
Your love is like a drug
You fill me up with things I need
A, B, C, do you trust me?
Found comfort in the dark
But it's your heart that scares me

Got sugar in my bloodstream
I'm drippy with the icing
They say I'm sweet like ice cream
But I'll rip your heart out smiling

I need a ride or die chick
You need a real man
Lately I been on some shit
And you been down real bad
Anytime you hit my phone I usually answer
Used to make you happy, now I don't know what you mad for
You used to be my one and only
Now you act like you don't know me
Say you got some things to show me
Baby, tell me where we're going
Telling me what I should've did
Now I'm gone, can't handle it
And no I ain't wrong for that
Now I let all this paper stack up
I'm sorry I played you to the left
But all of this money's on my mind
Girl, you know how the game go
You let 'em, they'll do it every time
I want you to take care of yourself
And doing your best, when you shine
I want you to live your life
So don't even wait on me girl

Sugar in my bloodstream
I'm drippy with the icing
They say I'm sweet like ice cream
But I'll rip your heart out smiling

We cruising in the pink G-Waggy
This is my house like you can call me daddy
We out here loud, we only smoking fatties
You got the green, the lean, you got the addy
One, two, three, so chilly
Come with me, we light up the tree
A, B, C, do you trust me?
Found comfort in the dark
But it's your heart that scares me

Got sugar in my bloodstream
I'm drippy with the icing
They say I'm sweet like ice cream
But I'll rip your heart out smiling
Got sugar in my bloodstream
I'm drippy with the icing
They say I'm sweet like ice cream
But I'll rip your heart out smiling

Sugar in my bloodstream
I'll rip your heart out smiling
