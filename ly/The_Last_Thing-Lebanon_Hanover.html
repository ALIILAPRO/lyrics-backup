		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm collapsing, breaking down
Silently onto the ground
Above me the azure sky
The last thing I see in my life
A swallow makes a little cry
As I look up for the last time
There won't be a miracle
There's really nothing more to come

And all metaphysical unmasks it'self now
Did we have each other enough?
Did we connect deep enough?

I'm collapsing, just now
Falling without a sound
An orange sunbeam on the rye
The last thing I see in my life
And no one's even bothered
Whether I even worked
Or felt something like happiness
As I lose out on this heart attack

And all metaphysical unmasks it'self now
Did we have each other enough?
Did we connect deep enough?
