		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  But the look in your eyes
Kill it makes a Scars!
I'm a scars
Who doesn't bleed or broken
Falling from a height
Where humans reluctant
Come to me!
Aim me right on my head
Don't take your eyes off
The sight of those eyes leads me to hatred
This hatred pours in me
Like the tip of the arrow, I'm barely holding on
This hatred pours in me
Emptiness
Your words don't speak the truth
I'm just silent
There will no single breath about your name
I'm a mess
Do you still want to make it worst?
I'd rather die than fix this path with you
Which until now I holding on
Until the time is getting dark
And finally, hate and revenge
Beat love and the trust
Till the end of your life
Are you scared?
Cause no one on my side
You keep that biggest wrath
I smelled your early death
Come to me!
Aim me right on my head
Don't take your eyes off
The sight of those eyes leads me to hatred
This hatred pours in me
Like the tip of the arrow, I'm barely holding on
This hatred pours in me
Like the tip of the arrow, I'm barely holding on
Which until now I holding on
Until the time is getting dark
And finally, hate and revenge
Beat love and the trust
Till the end of your life
The pulses of regret
Guiding my pounding veins
It's hidden in my chest
Deep bury in my pain
The pulses of regret
Guiding my pounding veins
It's hidden in my chest
This resentment remains
Earghh
This resentment remains
Where you can escape?
Which until now I holding on
Until the time is getting dark
And finally, hate and revenge
Beat love and the trust
Till the end of your life
Which until now I holding on
Until the time is getting dark
And finally, hate and revenge
Beat love and the trust
Till the end of your life
