		  Ohhoo , Ah yeahh

I got a new found confidence 
I want to get it right and get the most in life
They love me on the down low but are they really down though 
And I want to feel alright , got me staying up all night
Why you tryna dim my light
Feel like I wanna give up 
They love me on the down low but are they really down though 

I told myself that I can rise
Like a phoenix looking for his way
They can't stop me even if they tried
I think I found myself again 

Ooo hoo , ahh yeah 

Can I be the one to blame
For caring what they say 
You want to change their mind 
Their just a waste of time 
They love me on the down low but are they really down though 
And I want to feel alright , got me staying up all night
Why you tryna dim my light
Feel like I wanna give up 
They love me on the down low but are they really down though 

I told myself that I can rise
Like a phoenix looking for his way
They can't stop me even if they tried
I think I found myself again 

Ooo hoo , ahh yeah 

They love me on the down low but are they really down though
