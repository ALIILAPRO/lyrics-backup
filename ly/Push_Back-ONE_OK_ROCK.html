		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Gun to our heads
They're tryin' to tell us what to think
We're stuck on the edge
So go ahead and push us
We'll get up and push back
Push back

They call it revolution, but nothing's changed
They call it medication, we're still in pain

Now we're back in the fight and never losing our strength
We tried too many times just waiting patiently, patiently

It's like they're holding their gun to our heads
They're tryin' to tell us what to think
We're stuck on the edge
So go ahead and push us
We'll get up and push back
Push back

Your precious reputation goes up in flames
Your empty information, we know it's so fake

Now we're back in the fight and never losing our strength
We tried too many times just waiting patiently, patiently

It's like they're holding their gun to our heads
They're tryin' to tell us what to think
We're stuck on the edge
So go ahead and push us
We'll get up and push back
Push back

(Push back)

Gun to our heads
They're tryin' to tell us what to think
We're stuck on the edge
So go ahead and push us
We'll get up and push back
Push back
