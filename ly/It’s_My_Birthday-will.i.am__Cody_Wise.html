		  It's my birthday
It's my birthday
I'mma spend my money
It's my birthday
It's my birthday
I'mma spend my money
It's my birthday
It's my birthday
I'mma live my fantasy
It's my birthday
It's my birthday
I'mma live my fantasy
I'mma turnt up
We can turnt up
We can take it higher
We can burn up
We can burn up
Set this place on fire
Ooh it's hot, ooh it's hot
Damn it's hot ooh baby
I won't stop, we won't stop
We gon' get real crazy

I'mma spend a dollar, dollar, dollar
We gon' put it down, like we don't care
I'mma throw my hands up in the air,
I'mma call you mama
Mami call me papa
We gon' get down like you know what's up
The world don't matter, your problem don't matter
'Cause we gon' get dumb

It's my birthday
It's my birthday
I'mma spend my money
Pretty lady, pretty lady
You should be my honey
Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy
Pretty baby, come with me
It's my birthday
It's my birthday
I'mma live my fantasy

It's my birthday
It's my birthday
I'mma spend a dollar
Pretty lady, pretty lady
Won't you let me holler
Holler at you, holler at you
Won't you be my fantasy
Girl I got you, girl it got you
You look like my destiny
Mamacita, mamacita
Senorita vena qui
Que bonita, que bonita
I can speak in Japanese
Kawari, kawari, kawari I want your body
Come with me, come with me
Come with me girl let's go party

I'mma give a dollar, dollar, dollar
Get it over there, and get it over there
I'mma throw my hands up in the air,
I'mma call you baby,
Baby be my baby
We gon' burn the town, get down, and crazy
Time for drinks, no time to think
Let's do our thing

I'mma go spend some dollars
Go on and scream and holler
Put my hands in the air, party like we don't care
Where the ladies? Where the girls?
It's a party, come with me
Pretty ladies around the world
It's a party, come with me

It's my birthday
It's my birthday
I'mma spend my money
Pretty lady, pretty lady
You should be my honey
Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy
Pretty baby, come with me
It's my birthday
It's my birthday
I'mma live my fantasy

Uh oh, here we go, here we go
Tell the people, in the disco
Burn it down to the floor
'Cause we don't care
We got our hands up in the air
Everybody in the party, we party like its everybody's birthday
