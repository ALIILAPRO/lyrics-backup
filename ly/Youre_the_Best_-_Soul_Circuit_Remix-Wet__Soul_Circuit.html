		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All I know is
When you hold me
I still feel lonely
Lonely when you hold me

All I know is
I can't focus
On these arms around me
Think of how you found me
Found me in those arms
So large and dark and holding on

All I know is
When you hold me
Are you thinking Rosalie
Or is she in me?
And all the rest

Well, baby, you're the best
We'll figure out the rest
And maybe it's a test
I think we'd better quit while we're ahead

All I know is
When we're sleeping
Our friends, they creep in
And all the rest

All I know is
You hardly know me
But you still owe me
And all the rest

Well, baby, you're the best
We'll figure out the rest
And maybe it's a test
I think we'd better quit while we're ahead
