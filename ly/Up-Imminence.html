		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Blood overflooding my bones
Drowning my heartbeat the temperature's rising
And I catch a fever
And I fire up, up, up
My heart is in overdrive
And I can't stop

We can go, go, go 'til the lights go out
We won't stop, we won't stop
Going up, up, up not a shred of doubt
Time is running and you're not keeping up
Up!
Time is running and you're not keeping up
Up!

I need to cure the syndrome
It's getting worse
Someone call cease-fire, cease-fire

Blood overflooding my bones
Drowning my heartbeat the temperature's rising
And I catch a fever
And I fire up, up, up
We can go, go, go 'til the lights go out
We won't stop, we won't stop
Going up, up, up not a shred of doubt
Time is running and you're not keeping up

Oh, my heart is in overdrive
And I can't stop
It makes me feel alive
Yeah, it makes me feel alive

I need you like a gun to the head
But I'll be dead before I ask for your help
I need you like a knife in the back
Time to take back everything you said

I need you like a gun to the head
But I'll be dead before I ask for your help
I need you like a knife in the back
Time to go back
'Cause time is running and you're not keeping up

My heart is in overdrive
And I can't stop
We can go, go, go 'til the lights go out
We won't stop, we won't stop
Going up, up, up not a shred of doubt
Time is running and you're not keeping up
Up!
I need you like a gun to the head
Up!
I need you like a knife in the back
