		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She's on my mind
Every hour of every day
The things we could do
Oh, it takes my breath away
And I lose control
Think I'd follow her onto the edge
But she says she's only a friend
Only a friend

My mind just can't explain it
No, I can't find the words
But I don't care anymore
Think I'm in love with her

She's on my mind
But I wish she was under me
There's a space in between us
And I don't know how to reach
And she looked away
But I swear I saw her looking in
When we play games
I just want her to win
Only want her to win

And I don't want to hide it
Even if it hurts
I don't care anymore
Think I'm in love with her

She's walking over
She's got that look in her eyes
She, she
She's leaning in
I guess she's saying goodnight
She, she, she said
"I'm so tired of fighting
I'm so scared to lose
But I don't care anymore
Think I'm in love
With you"

I don't care anymore
Don't care anymore
I don't care anymore
Don't care anymore
I don't care anymore
Don't care anymore
