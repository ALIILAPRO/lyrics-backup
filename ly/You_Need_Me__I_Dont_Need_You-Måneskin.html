		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now I'm in town, break it down, thinking of making a new sound 
Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd 
That's you now, ciao, seems that life is great now 
See me lose focus, as I sing to you loud 

And I can't, no, I won't hush 
I'll say the words that make you blush 
I'm gonna sing this now, na na now, na na now 

See, I'm true, my songs are where my heart is 
I'm like glue, I stick to other artists 
I'm not you, now that would be disastrous 
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures 

See, I'm real, I do it all, it's all me 
I'm not fake, don't ever call me lazy 
I won't stay put, give me the chance to be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me, man I won't 

'Cause you need me, man, I don't 
You need me man, I don't don't don't 
You need me man, I don't, man I don't 
Man I don't need you 
You need me, man, I don't 
You need me man, I don't don't don't 
You need me man, I don't, man I don't 

Yeah, I sing and write my own tune and I write my own verses
Now don't need another word-smith to make my tune sell 
Call yourself a singer-writer, you're just bluffing
Name's on the credits and you didn't write nothing 

I sing fast, I know that all my shit's cool 
I will blast and I didn't go to Brit School 
I came fast with the way I act, right 
I can't last if I'm smoking on a crack pipe 

And I won't be a product of my genre 
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are 
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya 
Always read the stories that you hear on Wikipedia, yeah 

And musically I'm demonstrating 
When I perform live, feels like I am meditating 
Times at the Enterprise when some fella filmed me 
'A young singer-writer like Gabriella Cilmi

'Cause you need me, man, I don't 
You need me man, I don't don't don't 
You need me man, I don't, man I don't 
Man I don't need you 
You need me, man, I don't 
You need me man, I don't don't don't 
You need me man, I don't, man I don't 

'Cause with the lyrics I'll be aiming it right 
I won't stop till my name's in light 
At Stadium Heights with Damien Rice 
On red carpets, now I'm on Arabian Nights 
Because I'm young and all my brothers gonna give me advice 
Long nighter, short height and I'm gone hyper 
Never be anything but a singer-songwriter, yeah
The games over but now I'm on a new level 
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal 

People think that I'm bound to blow up 
I've done around about a thousand shows 
But I haven't got a house plus I live on the couch 
So you can be the lyrics when I'm singing them out (wow) 

From day one, I've been prepared 
With V05 wax for my ginger hair 
So now I'm back to the sofa giving a dose of what the future holds 
'Cause it's another day plus I'll keep my last name 
Forever keep the genre pretty basic 
Gonna be breaking into other people's tunes when I chase it 
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift 
Into another rappers shoes using new laces 
Selling cds from my rucksack aiming for the papers 
Selling cds from my rucksack aiming for majors 
Nationwide til' we're just jack, soon as I get the bus back 
Clean cut kid without a razor for the mustache 

I hit back when the pen hurts me 
I'm still a choir boy in a French church tee 
I'm still the same as a year ago but more people hear me though 
According to the Myspace and Youtube videos

I'm always doing shows, if I'm not I'm in the studio 
Truly broke, never growing up call me Ruffio 
Melody music maker, reading all the papers 
They say I'm up and coming like I'm fucking in an elevator 

'Cause you need me, man, I don't 
You need me man, I don't don't don't 
You need me man, I don't, man I don't 
Man I don't need you 
'Cause you need me, man, I don't 
You need me man, I don't don't don't 
You need me man, I don't, man I don't 
Man I don't 

'Cause you need me, man, I don't 
'Cause you need me, man, I don't 
'Cause you need me, you need me, you need me, man I don't 
'Cause you need me, man, I don't 
You need me, man, I don't 
You need me, you need me, you need me
Man I don't need you
