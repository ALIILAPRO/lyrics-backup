		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Y'all know what's goin' on
21 Gang 'til I'm gone
4L Gang 'til I'm gone
If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon'â€”

Roll the window down, stick the Glock out (Stick the Glock out)
This chopper got a AMP, I'ma rock out (I'ma rock out)
When it's time for smoke, they gon' cop out (They gon' cop out)
This AK47 made in Moscow (Made in Moscow)
All these dead bodies got me seein' strange things (Straight up)
Both sides of the gun, I done dealt and felt the pain (On God)
Drive by? Nah, we the walk-up gang (21)
I come from the 6 where they chalk up lames (On God)
Slide in and out (Out)
Spend the night? I doubt (Doubt)
Gold grill mouth (Mouth)
I come from the South (South)
We was stealin' cars
You was inside the house (Pussy)
I know he gon' be a rat one day
Right now we call him a mouse (21)

I got lots of stripes, all my niggas shyst
You can roll the dice, you might lose your life
Keep my Desert Eagle on me, he not nothin' nice
I just need one Glock, Nas need one mic (Lil' bitch)

I done did a lot in the streets and them facts (21)
PTSD like I came from Iraq (On God)
You made it from the gutter, then I'm tippin' my hat (I am)
Don't go big on me, you might get hit with this MAC (Brrah)
I don't need no holster, you get burned like toaster (21)
I don't drink no liquor, but I'm smokin' on mimosa (Yeah)
We been gettin' that Jewish money, everything is Kosher (On God)
Bought myself a 'Ventador and bought my bitch a Roadster (Straight up)
Drive my Lambo' to the store, I'ma wave with my doors
I'm on Glenwood, not the Ave., nigga, the road (21)
Talkin' on the pillow, nigga, that shit for the hoes (Straight up)
I'd never snitch on my enemies or my bros (Never)
I'm so 21, dawg, I'm so SG (Yeah)
I'm so 4L Gang, I keep a Glock 19xb (21)
Head so good, she not even white, I still call her Becky (Yeah, yeah)
Richard Mille cost so much I could push a button and see next week (Straight up)
.30 on the glizzy, got my pants dizzy (Pants dizzy)
Playin' 'round with Savage, you get shot in the kidney (Shot in the kidney)
So many drums, he gon' think a band hit him (Ha)
Chopper clapped his ass, he thought a hand hit him (Ha)
I do the BlocBoy JB on the brick (Skrrt, skrrt)
Make your crew do the Electric Slide with this stick (Straight up)
She don't get no new Chanel, she gon' throw a fit (Straight up)
I wanna buy that girl the world, the way she suck this dick (Yeah)
Fronted me some bags, I ran out the same night (Damn)
When I was in jail, on my momma, I ain't kite (Damn)
Niggas know I'm solid, I shoot and I fight (Straight up)
You just wear Adidas, but in real life, I got stripes (21)

I got lots of stripes, all my niggas shyst
You can roll the dice, you might lose your life
Keep my Desert Eagle on me, he not nothin' nice
I just need one Glock, Nas need one mic

My brother down the road, they tried to give him life
He swear he so creative, turned a toothbrush to a knife
Savage got your wifey playin' with herself on Skype
She thought the AC was on, it was just my ice
We pull up ready to shoot (Brrrah)
Y'all ready to fight (Stupid)
Pull up, ready to kill (Yeah)
Y'all ready to die (Straight up)
Broke-ass nigga get killed ridin' a bike (Pussy)
Savage left his gun at home, nigga, yeah, right (Ha)
