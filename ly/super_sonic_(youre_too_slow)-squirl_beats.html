		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got the coins, I got the money, you can call me Sonic
That girl she calling me dumb and broke, well isn't that ironic?
That bitch she only see you as a friend, yea it's platonic
My music spreading like the plague, something like bubonic
Why you cuffin' up that bitch, you know that's not your bitch
I walked up inside Prada, looked and I bought all they shit
You know I'm poppin', put me on websites, get them all they clicks
No I'm not beefing with you 'cause I know all your tricks
Walked up inside that boy home, yea I brought about 30 sticks
Laughing at this boy 'cause he got on them Playboy Ricks
The devil straight up by my side, my favorite number 6
Don't think I forgot, yea I still want my fucking licks
Spraying, spraying, spraying, spraying, yea we give that boy hell
Killing all these young boys, just like my name is Kentrell
Feeling like I'm Yeat the way that I'm ringing up all these bells
Call me Dr. Strange the way I curse that boy up with a spell
Yea, told her my name Stendo
Pulled up with the gang, the bando
Got the range just like I'm Rango
Yea, yellow diamonds, they mangos
Told that boy it take two to tango
Fucked that boy up in my sandals
Yea, that boy a bitch, he can't outrap me, yea I kept my mantle
Bitch!
