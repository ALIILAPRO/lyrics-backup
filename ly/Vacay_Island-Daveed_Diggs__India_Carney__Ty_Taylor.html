		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey, hey
Hey, hey

When you're on a holiday
You can't find the words to say
All the things that come to you
And I wanna feel it too

On an island in the sun
We'll be playin' and havin' fun (ooh-whoa)
And it makes me feel so fine (ooh-whoa-whoa-whoa)
I can't control my brain (ooh-whoa)

Ah (yeah)
She call me Mr. Boombastic
Tell me fantastic
Touch me on my back, she says I'm mister ro-ro-romantic
Call me fantastic
Touch me on my back, she says I'm mister ro-ro-ro

Smooth (smooth)
Just like a silk
Soft and cuddly, hug me up like a quilt
I'm a lyrical lover
No take me for no filth
With my vacation physique
Jah know me well-built (jah know me well-built)

(Ah)
Sailin'
Takes me away
To where I've always heard it could be
Just a dream and the wind to carry me
And soon I will be free (soon I will be free)
