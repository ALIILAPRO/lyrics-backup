		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sweetie Little Jean, where did you go?
Everyone's been searching high and low
And your mother's worried sick
Dearest daddy's lost his grip
While the whole world's watching
Candlelight vigils being held in silence
On the channel four
And they've knocked on every door
Every place you've been before

How long will we let it go?
I think we should just let go

I, I want you back
Let's get back
Lay my weary head against your bones
Where all my troubles will be dead and gone

How long will we let it go?
I think we should just let go

Has melancholy taken you for good?
You know that I would save you if I could
Watched your laughter turn to tears
Then you vanished in thin air
Well we pinned your missing persons picture up
On every mother-loving post
How's it feel to be a ghost?
You're the one I love the most

I, I want you back
Let's get back
Lay my weary head against your breast
Where all my troubles will be laid to rest

I pushed and I pulled 'til I pushed you aside
Now all that is left are the tears that you cried
I'm sorry love for all of the damage done
I only hope that someday to be back beside you

I, I want you back
Let's get back
Lay my weary head against your bones
Where all our troubles will be dead and gone

How long will we let it go?
I think we should just let go
