		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So clever, whatever
I'm done with these endeavors
Alone, I walk the winding way (here I stay)
It's over, no longer
I feel it growing stronger
I live to die another day
Until I fade away

Why give up, why give in?
It's not enough, it never is
So I will go on until the end
We've become desolate
It's not enough, it never is
But I will go on until the end

Surround me
It's easy to fall apart completely
I feel you creeping up again (in my head)
It's over, no longer
I feel it growing colder
I knew this day would come to end
So let this life begin

Why give up, why give in?
It's not enough, it never is
So I will go on until the end
We've become desolate
It's not enough, it never is
But I will go on until the end

I've lost my way
I've lost my way, but I will go on until the end

Living is hard enough
Without you fucking up

Why give up, why give in?
It's not enough, it never is
So I will go on until the end
We've become desolate
It's not enough, it never is
But I will go on until the end

I've lost my way
I've lost my way, but I will go on until the end, ooh, ooh

The final fight I'll win
The final fight I'll win
The final fight I'll win
But I will go on until the end
