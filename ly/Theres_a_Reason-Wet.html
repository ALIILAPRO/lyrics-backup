		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Through unrest and stillness
Wasn't I your witness?
Now there's a difference
A distance between us

I call your name
But you can't hear me
Now something's changed
Your back is to me
Up against the wall
How did I fall so hard again?

Like a wall falls in the night
But the rhythm's just out of time
There's a reason you're by my side again

It's nobody's business
Who cares if anyone listens?
Now there's a madness to this
And it's getting to us

I call your name
But you can't hear me
Now something's changed
Your back is to me
Up against the wall
How did I fall so hard again?

And the wall falls in the night
But the answer's just out of sight
There's a reason you're holding me tight again

And I'll wait for the rest of our lives
With the answer just out of sight
There's a reason you're by my side
Yeah, oh yeah

Like a wall falls in the night
But the rhythm's just out of time
There's a reason you're by my side again
And the wall falls in the night
But the answer's just out sight
There's a reason you're holding me tight again
