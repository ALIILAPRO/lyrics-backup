		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can't match the stare within these eyes 
Do you have the strength for all your lies 
Can't stand the pain with which i see 
This integrity is what i breathe 

I inhale this life i gave to you 
And exhale the vile 

Time will tell Because my friend and 
Never will I concede the end 
'Cause catarac resin fills my eyes 
Never gonna see the man Through your fake lies 

Tell me the things that'll take time 
To help see the things That'll take this 
Burn inside of me 

Can't feel the sting from words gone by 
Can't keep the papers filled with lies 
Ten fold, this confidence I breed 
Created back the words I see 

I'll inhale this gift I gave to you 
And exhale the vile 
Kill this fire with gasoline 
Convictions I spit, my faith obscene 

Heretic Jackals worship liars 
Forever I'll be the god that you desire 

Tell me the things that'll take time 
To help see the things that'll take this 
And hold onto things that'll make my 
To make me the thing that breaks this 
Burn inside of me 

Time will tell because my friend and 
Never will I concede the end 
Heretic Jackals worship liars 
Forever I'll be the god that you desire 

Tell me the things that'll take time 
To help see the things that'll take this 
And hold onto things that'll make my 
To make me the thing that breaks this Burn inside of me 
Burn inside of me, Burn inside of me, Burn inside of me
