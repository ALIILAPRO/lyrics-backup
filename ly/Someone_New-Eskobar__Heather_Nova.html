		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So is it goodbye?
Is it time to set you free?
Is it time to let it fly?
Is it time to let it bleed
We used to take turns
To cover up the pain
Deep below it burns
And the fellin' still remains
You're gonna find someone new
I really hope you do
'Cause I love you
And the sun will come on through,
It's gonna shine for you
'Cause I adore you
Yes we gave it a try
But maybe for too long
Out of every sorrow
Another day will dawn
You're gonna find someone new
I really hope you do
'Cause I love you
And the sun will come on through,
It's gonna shine for you
'Cause I adore you
And the road travels on
But I'm still near you
In my life, like a song
I will still hear you
Still
Sun will shine for you
'Cause I adore you...
