		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ayy, woah, ayy, woah

Don't you love me? You too cute to trust me
Ayy brag and fuck me
What's too high for Lucki? Ayy
Nigga's ducking, action, I got front seat

(Are you ready, kids?) ayy, woah, ayy, woah
Don't you love me? Ayy don't you love me?
Baby, don't you love me? Ayy
Ayy, woah, ayy, ayy, woah, ayy, uh
Ayy, woah, ayy, woah, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy

Don't you love me? You too cute to trust me
Ayy brag and fuck me
What's too high for Lucki? Ayy
Nigga's ducking, action, I got front seat
Ayy

I sip Hi Tech, my juice sweet like bubbly
Ayy just for right now, don't
Know you in public, ayy
I miss my town, niggas on that fuck shit, ayy
In a nightgown, Satan and her sister, ayy
In a nightgown, Satan and her sister, ayy
Nigga, pipe down, I don't want your Mrs, ayy
She's a Sprite gal, I'm
Stuck on purple kisses, ayy
Bitch, get off the past, mad
'bout what we didn't, ayy
I know 'bout her frown, mad
'bout what he isn't, ayy
My ho love Xans' like them Broward bitches
Ayy
You got no chance followin' your wishes, ayy

Don't you love me?
You too cute to trust me, ayy
Don't you love me? Xan' didn't
Make you fuck me
Ha, ayy, woah, don't you love me? Ayy
Ayy, woah, don't you love me?
