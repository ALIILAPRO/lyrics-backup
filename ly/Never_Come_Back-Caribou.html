		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And you never come back
And you never come back to
And you never come back
And you never come back to
And you never come back
And you never come back to
And you never come back
And you never come back to

And you never come back
And you never come back to
And you never come back
And you never come back to
And you never come back
And you never come back to
And you never come back
And you never come back to
And you never come back
And you never come back to
And you never come back
And you never come back to

And you never come back
And you never come back to
And you never come back
And you never come back to
And you never come back
And you never come back to
And you never come back
And you never come back to

I can never forget it
Promise me that you don't regret it
You and I were together
Even though we both knew better

And you never come back
And you never come back to
And you never come back
And you never come back to
And you never come back
And you never come back to
And you never come back
And you never come back to
And you never come back
And you never come back to
And you never come back
And you never come back to
And you never come back
And you never come back to
And you never come back
And you never come back to

And you never come back
And you never come back to
And you never come back
And you never come back to

I can never forget it
Promise me that you don't regret it
You and I were together
Even though we both knew better

And you never come back
And you never come back to
And you never come back
And you never come back to
And you never come back
And you never come back to
And you never come back
And you never come back to

I guess I'll need you
Never fail
To help believe you
I'll lead you
I guess I'll need you
Never fail
To help believe you
I'll lead you
