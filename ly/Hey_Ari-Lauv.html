		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I see through the pills you take
I see through the face you make
Hey Ari, are you happy?
Your lovesick attitude
It doesn't make you cool
Hey Ari, are you happy?

It's been days since you've been sober
And you're not getting any younger
I'm not saying that you're old
But you're way too old for this
And you fall in love on Fridays
Then you fall apart on Sundays
And you wake up drunk on Mondays
And you call your therapist

But I see through the pills you take
I see through the face you make
Hey Ari, are you happy? Mmm
You built up an atmosphere
But then came the clouds of fear
Hey Ari, are you happy?
I say, "Yeah, for sure"

There's not a cloud in the sky, but I'll dream one up
Molly inside me, it helps me to feel alive
5-Htp on an empty stomach, I threw it up
Yeah, that shit makes me sick
Yeah, I think it's time to quit 'cause

I see through the pills I take
I see through the face I make
Hey Ari, are you happy? No
Your lovesick attitude
It doesn't make you cool
Hey Ari, are you really happy?
I say, "Yeah, for sure"

Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah, for sure
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah, for sure
Oh, oh, oh, oh, for sure
Yeah, for sure, yeah, for sure
Yeah, for sure
Yeah, for sure, yeah, for sure
Yeah, for sure
Yeah, for sure, yeah, for sure
Yeah, for sure, mmm
Are you happy?
I say, "Yeah, for sure"
