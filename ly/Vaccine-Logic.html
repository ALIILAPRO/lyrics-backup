		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ah yeah, just me and my dogs, yeah
Give a fuck 'bout what y'all doing, yeah, we going hard all year

Ah yeah, just me and my dogs, yeah
Give a fuck 'bout what y'all doing, yeah, we going hard all year
Ah yeah, just me and my dogs, yeah
Give a fuck 'bout what y'all doing, yeah (yeah), we going hard (yeah) all year

Came back to the scene, came back with a team
Like rap anything, I'ma do anything
I'ma rap, I'ma sing, yeah I'm back, and the king
Came back from the trap to supply all the fiends like

Ah yeah, just me and my dogs, yeah
Give a fuck 'bout what y'all doing, yeah, we going hard all year
Like, ah yeah, just me and my dogs, yeah
Give a fuck 'bout what y'all doing, yeah, we going hard all year

I'll be right back in the bih, sipping on something, I'm lit
Internet throwing a fit
Could give a shit, bitch, get the fuck off my dick
Just say that shit, and gon' head back
Bobby don't claim no set, but it's just me and my gang
Ready to fuck up the game, BT3, now we at it again, man

Ah yeah, just me and my dogs, yeah
Give a fuck 'bout what y'all doing, yeah, we going hard all year
Ah yeah, just me and my dogs, yeah
Give a fuck 'bout what y'all doing, yeah (yeah), we going hard (yeah) all year

Just me and this beat, got you feeling defeat
I came up on the street, now I'm bringing the heat
Yeah, you know I got heat, ain't no need to repeat
I got happiness, ain't no need to repeat, I got number ones
Ain't got time for these rappers, I only got time for my son
Him and his momma the one
I got no time to attack all these people 'cause money is time
And you spend yours in all these places
While I'm on tour with all these faces
In these arenas you wish you was in
Maybe stop talking about me and you'll win
I'm going in, yeah, I'm going off
When they talking that shit, I just blow it off
When they talking that shit, I just show 'em love
'Cause when I speak, they gotta look above

Ah yeah, just me and my dogs, yeah
Give a fuck 'bout what y'all doing, yeah, we going hard all year
Ah yeah, just me and my dogs, yeah
Give a fuck 'bout what y'all doing, yeah, we going hard all year
