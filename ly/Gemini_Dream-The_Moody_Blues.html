		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Long time no see
Short time for you and me
So fine, so good
We're on the road
Like you knew we would

First night, so long
A state of mind
What can go wrong
We're here, the time is right
To rock 'n' roll
Right through the night

Make it work out
Make it work
Make it work out
Make it work out
For each other tonight

Stage fright, candle light
You can't let go
Tonight's the night
Came back for you
Glad to see
That you came too

There's a place a Gemini dream
There's no escaping from the love we have seen
So come with me, turn night today
You gonna wake up
You know you gonna wake up in a Gemini dream

Turned round to see
Where we've been
And what we believe
In life, love
Take a chance
See it through
You'll be glad
That you came too

There's a place a Gemini dream
There's no escaping from the love we have seen
So come with me, turn night to day
You gonna wake up
You know you gonna wake up in a Gemini dream

Long time no see
The lights go up
For you and me
We're here
The time is right
To rock 'n' roll
Right through the night

Living it
Believing it
Wanting it
Make it work out
Make it work
Make it work out
Make it work out
For each other tonight

Long time no see
Short time for you and me
So fine so far so good
We're on the road
Like you knew we would
