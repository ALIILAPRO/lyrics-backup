		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The darker the berry, forbidden the fruit
They still want a bit of the juice
If they do not hear, then they gotta feel
And my people gotta recoup
They say, "Where you been?", I been on a mountain
Growin' my hair and findin' my powers
Know how I'm feelin'? I doubt it
I feel like my dreams are crowded
And I don't like bad energy 'round me
Still, I wish all the best to an enemy
To my suh-suh-suh-suh with the jealousy
And the mix up look better without me
All I need is a piece or a portion
Day-to-day, I don't do too much talkin'
Hate when they take my words and distort 'em
Muddy waters, I'm steppin' with caution
Day-to-day, I just step and finesse
Paying dues with my daily due diligence
Mama told me keep all my receipts
Bring it back and divide up the dividends
Bring it back on my back like an Avirex
I can't run, end up creasin' my Forces
I remember when nobody call me
Now they gotta call me important

Maybe my hair too nappy, my lips too big
My nose too wide, my dick too big
My fist too high, the gang came with
Nobody goin' home until we all get rich (whoa)

Came back with a vengeance
Entered through the exit
Why they still watchin' my entrance?
Should've been watchin' intentions
Should've been watchin' me close
Respect, why my name get mentioned?
No need for the flex and boast
Me and them got no resemblance
Why you wanna chat about pen
When you couldn't even finish that sentence?
Why you wanna talk about skengs
When you couldn't even carry that weapon?
When these bruddas gonna learn their lesson?
With the pen, I'm way too seasoned
Better mind that you don't get peppered
Flambéed, sautéed, oh, wait
Wanna know why a brudda flex so much?
But whips and chains in my history
Check my stats of open doors
One or two seats ain't enough for me
Dealin' shit where the codeword Troy
That's one big horse for the cavalry
Sticks and stones, flesh and bones
Forty was tough, but I might still bleed

Maybe my hair too nappy, my lips too big
My nose too wide, my dick too big
My fist too high, the gang came with
Nobody goin' home until we all get rich
