		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  ""Wait in silence Until the stars go dark My companion With your cracked withered heart  That day is coming I know that you're calling on me That day is coming I know that you're calling on me I don't want you to make me wait too long It's time to get on the road  Half dead colours Residues of my soul Caught by the wind Hunting Thirsty for love  That day is coming I know that you're calling on me That day is coming I know that you're calling on me I don't want you to make me wait too long It's time to get on the road""
