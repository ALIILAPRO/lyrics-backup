		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do it like you're trying to kiss and make up
Oh, you treat it like old graffiti
Oh, oh yeah
You feel it when you fail to call her lately
Oh, to call her baby
You're looking like you lie to
Try to fight it
Oh, you treat it like old graffiti
Oh, ooh yeah
She needed you to think about her lately
Every part of baby

Acting like you're trying to kiss and make up
Too busy like old graffiti oh, oh
You feel it when she failed
To call you lately oh, to call you baby
Looking like you lie to try to hide it
Oh, you treat it like old graffiti oh, oh
She wanted you to think about her, lady
As her kind of baby
