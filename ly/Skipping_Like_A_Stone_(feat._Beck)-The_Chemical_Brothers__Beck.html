		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm dancing, I'm dancing
In the shadows of love

When you feel like nothing really matters
When you feel alone
When you feel like all your life is shattered
And you can't go home

I'll come skipping like a stone
I'll come skipping like a stone
I'll come skipping like a stone
I'll come skipping like a stone

I wanna go where no one goes
I wanna go where no one goes

I don't want to let you go
I don't want to lose your love
I don't want to let you go
I don't want to lose your love

When you feel like nothing really matters
When you feel alone
When you feel like all your life is shattered
And you can't go home

I'll come skipping like a stone
I'll come skipping like a stone
I'll come skipping like a stone
I'll come skipping like a stone

Ooh, she changes people now
She changes people now
Ooh, she changes people now
She changes people now

I-I'm dancing in the shadow of love
I-I'm dancing in the shadow of love
I-I'm dancing in the shadow of love
I-I'm dancing in the shadow of love

Ooh, she changes people now
She changes people now
Ooh, she changes people now
She changes people now

I-I-I see the sun now
I-I-I see the sun now
I-I-I see the sun now
I-I-I see the sun now
