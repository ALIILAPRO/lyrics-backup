		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Okay, so you've never done this before and that's cool
And all but I want you to try this with me,
Let's go, don't worry

Get ready, pop it, let's go
Enter galactic you and me
Enter galactic you and me

Get ready, pop it, let's go
Enter galactic you and me
Enter galactic you and me

I once used to dream of peace until I found you,
Once upon a time baby,
I once used to dream so sweet until I had a taste of you,
Once upon a time baby,
Reaching out to outer space dancing to awesome sounds,
This all new to you?
Reaching out to hold your close so I don't slip away,
Explore a new approach,
A whole new free I say

Get ready, pop it, let's go
Enter galactic you and me
Enter galactic you and me

Get ready, pop it, let's go
Enter galactic you and me
Enter galactic you and me

Get ready, pop it, let's go
Enter galactic you and me
Enter galactic you and me

Get ready, pop it, let's go
Enter galactic you and me
Enter galactic you and me

I know it's easy to imagine,
But it's easier to just do,
See, if you can't do what you imagine,
Then what is imagination to you?
Just a waste of space in your brain,
To take the place of hate,
Or things all the same,
Tell me your secrets
The things that make you tick,
I like it when you talk
Because your voice is angelesque (aye),
I want to kiss you on your space below your navalette
The taste that you keep neat, so moist like a towelette,
This will mark the day our minds and souls will connect,
Let's not forget the sex,
My heart you can collect (now now)
Yeah my heart you can collect (now now)
My heart you can collect (yeah yeah)
Have just one more cap babe babe babe 
Have just one more stem babe.

Get ready, pop it, let's go
Enter galactic you and me
Enter galactic you and me

Get ready, pop it, let's go
Enter galactic you and me
Enter galactic you and me

Pop it, ready, go, let it, take take take take over,
Get ready, pop it, let's go, get ready, le-le-let take it over,
Get ready, pop it, let's go, take it, just let it, take take you over,
Get ready, let's go, let's go, hey

Get ready, pop it, let's go
Enter galactic you and me
Enter galactic you and me

Get ready, pop it, let's go
Enter galactic you and me
Enter galactic you and me

Get ready, pop it, let's go
Enter galactic you and me
Enter galactic you and me

Get ready, pop it, let's go
Enter galactic you and me
Enter galactic you and me

Soon after falling into a deep but psychedelic state
To escape the prison of our reality
A hero becomes trapped in his own peaceful place
Which immediately becomes his sanctuary,
A place filled with his wildest dreams,
This is his new home.
