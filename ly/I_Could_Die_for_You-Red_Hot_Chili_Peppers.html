		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Something inside the cards I know is right
Don't want to live somebody else's life
This is what I want to be and this is what I give to you
Because I get it free
She smiles while I do my time

I could die for you
Oh, this life I choose

I'm here to be your only go-between
To tell you of the sights these eyes have seen
What I really want to do is turn it into motion
Beauty that I can't abuse
You know that I use my senses, too
You can see that it's only everywhere
I'd take it all in, then I'd find a way to share

Come along and go along with me
Wander with me, yo, it's all for free

I could die for you, what you wanna do?
Oh, this life I choose
I could die for you, what you wanna do?
Oh, this life I choose

Come again and tell me where you want to go
What it means to me to be with you alone
Close the door and no one has to know
How we are

Come along and go along with me
Wander with me, yo, it's all for free

I could die for you, what you wanna do?
Oh, this life I choose
I could die for you, what you wanna do?
Oh, this life I choose, make me wanna say
I could die for you, what you wanna do?
Oh, this life I choose
I could die for you, what you wanna do?
Oh, this life I choose
