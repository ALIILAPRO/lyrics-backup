		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here we are, the two of us together
Taking this crazy chance to be all alone
We both know that we should not be together
'Cause if they found out, it could mess up
Both our happy homes

I hate to think about us all meeting up together
'Cause soon as I looked at you, it would show on my face, yeah
Then they'll know that we've been loving each other
We can never no, no, no, no, we can't leave a trace

Sittin' at home I do nothing all day
But think about you and hope that you're okay
Hoping you'll call before anyone gets home
I'll wait anxiously alone by the phone

How could something so wrong be so right?
I wish we didn't have to keep our love out of sight, yeah
Living two lives, just ain't easy at all
But we gotta hang on and after fall

Secret lovers, yeah that's what we are
Trying so hard to hide the way we feel
'Cause we both belong to someone else
But we can't let it go 'cause what we feel
Is, oh so real, so real, so real

You and me, are we fair?
Is this cruel or do we care?
Can they tell that's in our minds?
Maybe they've had secret love all of the time

In the middle of makin' love, we notice the time
We both get nervous 'cause it's way after nine
Even though we hate it, we know it's time that we go
We gotta be careful so that no one will know

Secret lovers, yeah, that's what we are
We shouldn't be together but we can't let it go
'Cause what we feel is, oh so real
So real, so real, so real, so real
