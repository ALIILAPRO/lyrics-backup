		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  First to the bass into the jam 
Then let the music take command 
Back to back to another dimension 
Stop the force and pay some attention 
Music to party, music to dance 
The new follow-up of public demand 
Slick as five da la megaphone 
Take you down to the Twilight Zone 

Enter the clock and turn the body upside down 
Grab the microphone it's upon the sound 
You want more more you get 
We're 2 Unlimited in effect! 
Check up the sound and stop this distortion 
When we get the fitness, here's another portion 
Just lay back as we take control 
Take you down into the Twilight Zone

This is the Twilight Zone 
And you're not on your own 
We take you to the Twilight Zone 
It is the Twilight Zone 
You better shake your bones 
And come on Twilight Zone 

Come on baby! 
I'm gonna take you to the Twilight Zone
 
Have a good time, take a break 

Hang with another first of the chapter 
Straight to the heavyweight, for worst or better 
Fishes in the way, found in the vicinity 
Slamming DJ's with the rhyme capability 
Listen to the jam as we go wild 
Check your MC's versatile 
Me and the lady Howl Mega tone 
Fuck you up in the Twilight Zone 

Wow

This is the Twilight Zone 
And you're not on your own 
We take you to the Twilight Zone 
It is the Twilight Zone 
You better shake your bones 
And come on Twilight Zone
