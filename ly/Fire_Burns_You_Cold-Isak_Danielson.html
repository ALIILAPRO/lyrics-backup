		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can I live without it?
Be on my own
Will I ever doubt the love that you in me have grown?
Will I walk out stronger?
Will I break in two?
But I guess regret is just a part of loving you

You want the fire when the fire burns everything down to the ground
Am I a liar?
I'm not lying here alone when you're not around
I don't want love like this
I'll miss your kiss
But that's the way it goes
Who wants the fire when the fire, the fire burns you cold?

The fire burns you cold

I don't understand you
The way you speak
Maybe it's Danish that makes our conversations weak
So tired of fighting
And of all the lies
Is passion the only thing that keeps our love alive?

You want the fire when the fire burns everything down to the ground
Am I a liar?
I'm not lying here alone when you're not around
I don't want love like this
I'll miss your kiss
But that's the way it goes
Who wants the fire when the fire, the fire burns you cold?

Can you say I love you
And everything is okay?
Or is it just game over
In this game that we play

You want the fire when the fire burns everything down to the ground
Am I a liar?
I'm not lying here alone when you're not around
I don't want love like this
I'll miss your kiss
But that's the way it goes
Who wants the fire when the fire, the fire burns you cold?
