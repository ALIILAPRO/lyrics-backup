		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (And we spoke in past tense, reminisce 'bout back when)
(Our spirits used to dance with each other)

And we spoke in past tense, reminisce 'bout back when
Our spirits used to dance with each other
We been smokin gas, yeah, this is so romantic
I never wanna press fast forward
You treat me like I'm more than a pair of skin and bones
And that really made a difference in my story
Life will take its toll, but whichever way we go
Know I'm right here by your side, shawty

Skin and bones under the covers
Kept our love undercover
Nonchalant, very subtle
Tryin' not to step on the puddle

Write on your flesh with permanent ink
Light the incense, remember this scent
High as a bitch, but you won't catch me slip
I know nothing, I know I don't

And we spoke in past tense, reminisce 'bout back when
Our spirits used to dance with each other
We been smokin' gas, yeah, this is so romantic
I never wanna press fast forward
You treat me like I'm more than a pair of skin and bones
And that really made a difference in my story
Life will take its toll, but whichever way we go
Know I'm right here by your side, shawty

Skin and bones under the covers
Kept our love undercover
Nonchalant, very subtle
Tryin' not to step on the puddle

Treat me like I'm more than a pair of skin and bones
And that really made a difference in my story
Life will take its toll, but whichever way we go
Know I'm right here by your side, shawty

Yeah, what a contrast
My skin and bones against the color of your aura
On a Sunday
Walkin' slow while time was still runnin'
The moon's favorite daughter
Light in the dark and the waves in the water

If I can't be brave
And let you walk away
Maybe next life, you'll be mine again
Maybe next life, you'll be mine again
