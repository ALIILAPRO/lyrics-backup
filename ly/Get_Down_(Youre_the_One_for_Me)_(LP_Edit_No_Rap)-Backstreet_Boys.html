		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're the one for me
You're my ecstasy
You're the one I need
Hey yeah
Oh-oh-oh, oh yeah

Get down
Get down
And move it all around
Get down
Get down
And move it all around

Hey, baby love, I need a girl like you
But tell me if you feel it too
I'm in delusion every minute, every hour
My heart is crying out for you

I feel in heaven when I look in your eyes
I know that you are the one for me (one for me)
You drive me crazy 'cause you're one of a kind
I want your lovin' and I want it right now

Get down
Get down
And move it all around
Get down
Get down
And move it all around

Get down
Get down
And move it all around
Get down
Get down
And move it all around

Ooh baby, you're so fine
I'm gonna make you mine
Your lips, they taste so sweet
You're the one for me
You're my ecstasy
You're the one I need

Bang, bang, bang, here we come, here we slam
It's the Fun Factory with the BSB's
All the girls get on your knees
And they scream or touch me please
Backstreet Boys, are you with it? (Yeah)
AJ, hit it

Come on, girl, and get down
Smack it up, flip it and move it all around
Here it is, if you wanna get with this
Put you at the top of my list, uh

I feel in heaven when I look in your eyes
I know that you are the one for me, yes (one for me)
You drive me crazy 'cause you're one of a kind
I want your lovin' and I want it right now

Get down
Get down
And move it all around (you better get down)
Get down
Get down
And move it all around (you better move 'round)

Get down
Get down
And move it all around (hey yeah)
Get down
Get down
And move it all around

Ooh baby, you're so fine
I'm gonna make you mine
Your lips, they taste so sweet
You're the one for me
You're my ecstasy
You're the one I need

I feel in heaven when I look in your eyes
I know that you are the one for me, yeah (one for me)
You drive me crazy 'cause you're one of a kind
I want your lovin', baby, and I want it right now

Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh

You're the one for me
You're my ecstasy
You're the one I need

Get down (get down)
Get down (get down)
And move it all around
Get down (get down)
Get down (get down)
And move it all around

Get down (get down)
Get down (get down)
And move it all around
Get down (get down)
Get down (get down)
And move it all around

Get down (get down)
Get down (get down)
And move it all around
Get down (get down)
Get down (get down)
Get down, get down, yeah
