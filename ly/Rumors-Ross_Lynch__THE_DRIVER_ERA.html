		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  ('Cause I'm on your tongue)
(And it's just what I want)

Doesn't matter what you say
I'm gonna do it anyway
And I ain't gotta plead my case to you
Tomorrow comes another day
The sun is shinin' on my face
And all these things just fade away from you
It's true

I see you talkin', keep it comin'
Know you want it, 'cause you love it, it
See, I be dancin', and you watchin'
Caught you starin' and I love it, it
Now she's in my room

These rumors, these rumors
You're caught up in rumors
I bet you wish you knew the truth about the things I do
These rumors, these rumors
It's all good news, 'cause I'm on your tongue
And it's just what I want

Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah

I know you think it's complicated
But that's just how some people make it
I got better things that I could do for you

I see you talkin', keep it comin'
Know you want it, 'cause you love it, it
See, I be dancin', and you watchin'
Caught you starin' and I love it, it
Now she's in my room

These rumors, these rumors
You're caught up in rumors
I bet you wish you knew the truth about the things I do
These rumors, these rumors
It's all good news, 'cause I'm on your tongue
And it's just what I want

Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah

'Cause I'm on your tongue (rumors, these rumors)
And it's just what I want (it's all good news)
You're so caught up
Are you havin' fun?

Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah
