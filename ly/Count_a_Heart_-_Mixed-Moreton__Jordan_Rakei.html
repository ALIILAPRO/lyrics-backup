		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I said it like a friend to you
But that ain't how I wanted to
Those three lonely little words
Can fly away like little birds
You can count a heart in hurts

I'm picking at my nails again
Yeah you know how I feel
And you know why I'm hesitating then
I have loved and I have learned
From pretty boys and pretty girls
How to count a heart in hurts

Oh you went quiet, so I just went quiet too
I should've said something, but you could've said something too.

Let me be that one for you darling
Let me be that one that you hold on to
You've got to hold tight to what's good
Let me be that one for you darling

Seems I'm back to my old ways again
Trying to hide this loving gaze again
We're just dancing out of turn
And when we kiss goodbye it burns

Oh you went quiet, so I just went quiet too
I should've said something, but you could've said something too.

Let me be that one for you darling
Let me be that one that you hold on to
You've got to hold tight to what's good

Let me be that one for you darling
Let me be that one that you hold on to
Let me be that one for you darling
Let me be that one that you hold on to
Let me be that one for you darling
Let me be that one for you darling
