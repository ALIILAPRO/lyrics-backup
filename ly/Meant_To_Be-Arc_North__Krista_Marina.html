		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I want you to show me
How to get to know
Someone like you, someone like you
I want you to know me
'Cause I know then you'll see
We can be true, we can be true

I want you to see what I see in us
Something so real, something so real
I want you to see that this is a love
That we both feel, that we both feel

And how will we ever know
If the love will ever grow
Without trying, without trying
And how will we ever see
If we are meant to be
It's terrifying, it's terrifying

That we're meant to be
We are, we are
We're meant to be

That we're meant to be
We are, we are
We're meant to be

We've both been there before
When a love shuts the door
It's a losing game, it's a losing game
But this time it's more
Than another love war
This ain't the same, this ain't the same

They say love heals all
It makes it all alright
In time, in time
My heart still feels the breaking
But you make my world so bright
It feels so right, it feels so right

And how will we ever feel
That what we've got is real
There's no denying, there's no denying
And how will we ever see
If we are meant to be
It's terrifying, it's terrifying
And how will we ever know
If the love will ever grow
Without trying, without trying
And how will we ever see
If we are meant to be
It's terrifying, it's terrifying

That we're meant to be
We are, we are
We're meant to be

That we're meant to be
We are, we are
We're meant to be
