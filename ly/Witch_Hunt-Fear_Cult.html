		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Burn witch, burn witch, burn burn burn

It's in the Puritan's pride
With the innocent who died
It's in the Nazi youth
With their ignorant truth
It's in the Catholic church
With their false self worth
It's the blind leading the blind
Time after time after time
And it's always the same
Everybody needs somebody to blame

It's the burn the witch mentality
That's hunting down and killing me
"Think for yourself" is heresy
An utter sin of blasphemy

It's the burn the witch mentality
With flames of hate and jealousy
A crusade against identity
Where innocent are found guilty

It's in the Christian extreme
Who have tainted the dream
It's in the militant mind
With their battles to find
It's in the quick to judge
Who always carry a grudge
It's the blind leading the blind
Time after time after time
And it's always the same
Everybody needs somebody to blame

It's the burn the witch mentality
That's hunting down and killing me
"Think for yourself" is heresy
An utter sin of blasphemy

It's the burn the witch mentality
With flames of hate and jealousy
A crusade against identity
Where innocent are found guilty
