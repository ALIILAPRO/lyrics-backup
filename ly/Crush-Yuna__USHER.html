		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You call me on a lazy afternoon
Asking me what I'm up to
Let's find something to do
Baby I'd be down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down, down
You know I'd be down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down, down

I see you arriving in your car, yeah
Jet black Mercedes, built in the seventies
Classic like you and me
I'll be coming down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down, down
I'll be coming down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down, down

I feel a little rush
I think I've got a little crush on you
I hope it's not too much
But babe when I'm with you, I hear it
My heart singing
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la-la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la-la

Honestly I shouldn't waste time no more, eh yeah
'Cause all these little boys you're chasing, did they break your heart?
I know you've been down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down, down
I won't let you down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down, down

I feel a little rush
I think I've got a little crush on you
I hope it's not too much
But girl when I'm with you, I hear it
My heart singing
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la-la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la-la, hey

I see you the same
I see it in the way that you behave around me
And I can't tell
What we have is different from anyone else
'Cause you stop doing what you're doing
When I call you come to me running
And I would do the same for you
So tell me that you feel it too, woah

I feel a little rush
I think I've got a little crush on you (little crush on you)
I hope it's not too much, oh ho
But babe when I'm with you, I hear it
My heart singing
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la-la (ooh yeah baby, my heart singing)
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la-la, oh

I think I've got a crush, babe
Crush on you too
Feel a little rush, baby
And I feel it too
I think I've got a crush, babe
Crush on you too
Feel a little rush, baby
