		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My words don't know the truth
They flutter as I speak
The sickness I feel under my belt
Is the disdain I have for me
I've asked you to stand tall
But it's me who's fallen down
A better man I'd like to be
But I can't find my way home now

So what kind of man am I?
Who never looked up to see the sky
And every word I say
Has come back to haunt me every day
So here I stand alone
Crippled on my cane
The coward I've become
The loser in the game

These eyes you see are masked
By a thin veneer of tears
And who would have known that such a small task
Would have compromised all these years
'Cause a liar's guilt is a liar's fate
And man, that's just the facts
For those too weak to tell the truth
Into darkness you'll be cast

So what kind of man am I?
Who never looked up to see the sky
And every word I say
Has come back to haunt me every day
And here I stand alone
Crippled on my cane
The coward I've become
The loser in the game

So dig deep, you little bastard
Let the truth be known

Angels are flying with you tonight
You'd better not let them go
'Cause if you do I'd hate to think
Of what your fate could be
Speak your mind, tell what you know
And set your soul free

So what kind of man am I?
Who never looked up to see the sky
And every word I say
Has come back to haunt me everyday
(Speak your heart)
So here I stand alone
Crippled on my cane
The coward I've become
(Set us free)
The loser in the game
