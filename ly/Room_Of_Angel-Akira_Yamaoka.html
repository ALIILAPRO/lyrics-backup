		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You lie silent there before me
Your tears they mean nothing to me
The wind howling at the window
The love you never gave I give to you
Really don't deserve it
But now there's nothing you can do
So, sleep in your only memory
Of me, my dearest mother

Chorus:
Here's a lullaby to close your eyes (good-bye)
It was always you that I despised
I don't feel enough for you to cry (oh well)
Here's a lullaby to close your eyes
Good-bye, good-bye, good-bye, good-bye

So insignificant sleeping dormant deep inside of me
Are you hiding away, lost under the sewers?
Maybe flying high in the clouds?
Perhaps you're happy without me
So many seeds have been sown in the field
And who could sprout up so blessedly, If I had died
I would have never felt sad at all
You will not hear me say "I'm sorry"
Where is the light? Wonder if it's weeping somewhere...

chorus x4
