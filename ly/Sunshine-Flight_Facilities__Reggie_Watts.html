		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Sunshine)
I can see
By the dawn
Words of thoughts that meaning but we carry alone
And I feel
You so strong
Any time we do is like I'm doing all wrong

And we are moving
Like we need it
Waves are crashing in and we can barely perceive it
Baby
When you move
You make me feel like I got something to prove

Take your time
I wanna change your mind
I wanna make you mine
I wanna figure it out
Take you now
I want to show you how
I wanna know what it means, what your all about

Take your time
I wanna change your mind
I wanna make you mine
I wanna figure it out
Take you now
I want to show you how
I wanna know what it means to be on your side

Sunshines on my baby out on the floor
Sometimes love shines like never before

(Sunshine)
There's a word
For your kiss
Any definition is a failed attempt
And the way
Of your words
Haunt me in my dreams to the point of absurd

And were moving
Like we need it
Waves are crashing in and we can barely perceive it
Baby
When you move
You make me feel like I got something to prove

Sunshines on my baby out on the floor
Sometimes love shines like never before (never before)
Sunshines on my baby out on the floor (yea)
Sometimes love shines like never before (never before yea never be-never before)

Sometimes I think there's never enough (never enough)
Every moment counts when you looking for love (looking for love)
The meaning of it all seems to fade away
When I see you in that perfect place

(Sunshine)
Sunshines on my baby out on the floor
Sometimes love shines like never before
Sunshines on my baby out on the floor
Sometimes love shines like never before
