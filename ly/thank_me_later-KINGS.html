		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Verse 1:
You’re so welcome
That I pushed him your way
when I pushed him away
Hope you helped him
Cause you got every feeling
That he had for me

Pre:
I watched it all ricochet
From him to me then me to him to you
a game that you can only ever lose
think that he’s your property
But you’ll never see my point of view, cause

Chorus:
I’m the only reason you’re together
I’m the reason that you have it better
Really all I’m saying is
you can thank me, you can thank me later
You’re the reason that I got no closure
I’m the reason that he had you over
Really all I’m saying is
you can thank me, you can thank me later

Verse 2:
You’re so welcome
for the hoodie you’re in
The one I bought for him
So enjoy them
Go ask where he got it
Cause it’s his favorite

Pre 2:
think that he’s your property
But you’ll never see my point of view, cause

Bridge:
You walked in on all of his emotions
Now now he projects on you
So you can thank me later for the warning
When you finally see it’s true
