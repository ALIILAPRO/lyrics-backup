		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I see you watching me
Eyes on your target
Mix drinks and smoke rings
It's already started
It won't be too long before me and you
Are doing what lovers do

Clothes on the floor
We're exploring our bodies
Getting you off is my new favorite hobby
Lipstick on your neck brands like a tattoo
Cause that just how lovers do

Oh, love is just another four letter word
But that never stopped nobody
Oh, either way we lose
Just like lovers, just like lovers do

His and hers closets are perfect for skeletons
Hiding resentment and shared infedelities
Cheers to regret, wash it down with some booze
Drinking like lovers do

Oh, love is just another four letter word
But that never stopped nobody
Oh, either way we lose
Just like lovers, just like lovers do

That's how it goes
So take care like a grown-up
Life's not a fairytale, it's hard to own up
Hire a hitman to take care of you
And end it like lovers do

Oh, love is just another four letter word
But that never stopped nobody
Oh, either way we lose
Just like lovers, just like lovers do

I see you watching me
Eyes on your target
Mix drinks and smoke rings, 
It's already started
Let's roll the dice and we'll both make our moves
Playing like lovers do
