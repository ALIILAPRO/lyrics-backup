		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Worms

I will close your eyes
Send you off with a lullaby
The moon has never seen a darker side
Howling at the sun
I won't hide from anyone
My fingerprints are tattooed on your mind

Mother tried
But everything I do makes her wanna cry
Father, why?
Why are you haunting me every night like a parasite?

A troubled little boy
Murder scene made of broken toys
Never had no love, never had no choice, yeah
Found comfort in my sin
I can't wait for the lights to dim
Impossible to stop when I begin

Mother tried
But everything I do makes her wanna cry, yeah
Father, why?
Why are you haunting me every night like a parasite?

Haunting me at night
Like a parasite, like a parasite

Mother tried
But everything I do just makes her cry, yeah
Father, why?
Why are you haunting me every night like a parasite?
Like a parasite, like a parasite
Why are you haunting me every night like a parasite?
Like a parasite, like a parasite
Why are you haunting me every night like a parasite?

I like worms
