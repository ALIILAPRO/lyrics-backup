		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sleigh bells ring are ya' listenin
In the lane snow is glistenin'
A beautiful sight we're happy tonight
Walkin' in a winter wonderland

Gone away is the blue bird
Here to stay is a new bird
To sing a love song while we stroll along
Walkin' in a Winter Wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
We'll pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say "Are you married?", We'll say "No, man
But you can do the job when you're in town"

Later on we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid the plans that we've made
Walkin' in a Winter Wonderland

(Play it for 'em boys)
Winter Wonderland
(Ah yeah)

In the meadow we can build a snowman
We'll pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say "Are you ready?", We'll say "No, man
But you can do the job when you're in town!"

Later on we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid the plans that we've made
Walkin' in a Winter Wonderland
Just walkin' in a Winter Wonderland
Mm-mm-mm, walkin' in a Winter Wonderland
Just you and me, baby
