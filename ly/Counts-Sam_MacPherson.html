		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  VERSE 
How much do you wanna know
About the places that my hearts been

Introduce you to the skeletons
And show you who i was before 
And who i am with you 

PRE
Back then, i wanted what i have now
So when, you tell me that you got doubts
I’ll say nothing before you counts 

CHORUS
I don’t listen to sad songs
And think about my exes 
Those feelings are long gone 
Deleted all those texts and 
I don’t reminisce on history
So you don’t have to question you and me
Nothing before you
Nothing before you counts

VERSE 2
So i’ll tell you what you wanna know 
There’s no part of me i’m hiding 
And regardless nobody comes close you 
so confident in us, i hardly recognize my past self

PRE
Cause back then, i wanted what i have now
So when, you tell me that you got doubts
I’ll say nothing before you counts 

CHORUS
I don’t listen to sad songs
And think about my exes 
Those feelings are long gone 
Deleted all those texts and 
I don’t reminisce on history
So you don’t have to question you and me
Nothing before you
Nothing before you counts

BRIDGE
I don’t care who was in my bed before
All i care about is that i’m in yours now
I don’t care who was in my bed before
All i care about is that i’m in yours now

CHORUS 
I don’t listen to sad songs
And think about my exes 
Those feelings are long gone 
Deleted all those texts and 
I don’t reminisce on history
So you don’t have to question you and me
Nothing before you
Nothing before you counts
