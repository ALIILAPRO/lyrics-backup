		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We were just kids and we didn't know nothing
It didn't make sense but
It felt like something
Remember when I said that I
Loved you for life baby it wasn't a lie
Right one at the wrong time
How'd we get here never saw it coming

You make me feel like I can feel again
You make me realize the story didn't end
Didn't know my heart could hurt like that
Everything was numb and just like that
You make me feel like I can feel again

Caught me off guard you still know my number
When it all fell apart did you ever wonder
Maybe we're meant to be but we run on empty
We're crashing cars again
Still there's a hole in my heart
That you'll always cover

You make me feel like I can feel again
You make me realize the story didn't end
I didn't know my heart could hurt like that
Everything was numb and just like that
You make me feel like I can feel again

You make me feel like I can feel again
You make me realize the story didn't end
I didn't know my heart could hurt like that
Everything was numb and just like that
You make me feel like I can feel again
