		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You say I only hear what I want to
You say I talk so all the time, so

And I thought what I felt was simple
And I thought that I don't belong
And now that I am leaving
Now I know that I did something wrong
'Cause I missed you
Yeah, yeah, I missed you

And you say I only hear what I want to
I don't listen hard
Don't pay attention to the distance that you're running
To anyone, anywhere
I don't understand if you really care
I'm only hearing negative, no no no (bad)

And so I, I turned the radio on I turned the radio up
And this woman was singing my song
Lover's in love and the other's run away
Lover is crying 'cause the other won't stay
Some of us hover when we weep for the other
Who was dying since the day they were born
Well, well this is not that
I think that I'm throwing but I'm thrown

And I thought I'd live forever but now I'm not so sure
You try to tell me that I'm clever
But that won't take me anyhow or anywhere with you

You said that I was naive
And I thought that I was strong
I thought, "Hey I can leave, I can leave"
Oh, but now I know that I was wrong
'Cause I missed you
Yeah, I missed you

You said you caught me 'cause you want me
And one day you'd let me go
You try to give away a keeper
But keep me 'cause you know
You're just so scared to lose
And you say, stay

And you say I only hear what I want to
