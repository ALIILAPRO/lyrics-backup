		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeasterday has been and gone
Tomorrow will I find the sun or will it rain
Everybody's having fun except me I'm the lonely one
I live in shame

I said hey goodbye to romance yeah
Goodbye to friends and to you
Goodbye to all the past
I guess we'll meet, we'll meet in the end

I've been the king, I've been the clown
Now broken wings can't hold me down
I'm free again
The jester with a broken crown
It won't be me this time around to love in vain

I said hey goodbye to romance yeah
Goodbye to friends and to you
Goodbye to all the past
I guess we'll meet, we'll meet in the end

And I feel the time is right 
Although I know That you just might say to me
What ya gonna do
What ya gonna do
But I have to take this chance
Goodbye to friends and true romance
And to all of you and to all of you

Come on now
I said goodbye to romance yeah
Goodbye to friends and to you
Goodbye to all the past
I guess we'll meet, we'll meet in the end

And the weather's lookin' fine and I think the sun will shine again
And I feel I've cleared my mind all the past is left behind again

I said goodbye to romance
Goodbye to friends and to you
Goodbye to all the past
I guess we'll meet, we'll meet in the end
