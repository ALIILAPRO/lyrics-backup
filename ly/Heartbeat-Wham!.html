		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wham!
Another summer
Another vacation is over
A September morning,
With the sun and the smell of the clover

Down by the gate
We sit and we watch all our friends go by
And pretend we don't hear the bell,
That rings through the summer sky.

I was happy with the kiss that she gave me,
It's just that happy was all she made me
Happy that was
Until I saw you

Heart beat, heart beat,
Why do you fail me now?
You hurt me, desert me,
In my darkest hour
Heartbeat, heartbeat,
Why do you keep me here?
How could I help but admire her beauty?
Standing on the line between desire and duty
Heartbeat, heartbeat
It will end in tears

I need a lover,
But love's such a dangerous place to be
Oh, if we were meant for each other,
Then why won't you answer me?

Don't keep me waiting,
You know that I long to be by your side
We could even be together,
Tonight

I was happy with the kiss that she gave me
But now there's nothing on Earth to save me
Why should I care?
I can't have you

Heart beat, heart beat,
Why do you fail me now?
You hurt me, desert me,
In my darkest hour
Heartbeat, heartbeat,
Why do you keep me here?
How could I help but admire her beauty?
Standing on the line between desire and duty
Heartbeat, heartbeat
It will end in tears
