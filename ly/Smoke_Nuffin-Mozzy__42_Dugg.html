		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Battles, battles
Don't care if I'm performin' for kids, pass me that torch

Niggas'll break your wrist behind that watch that you went broke on
Niggas'll sit outside your mama house, now you can't go home
Lackin' evidence, irrelevant when you get told on
Hold on, y'all payin' to fuck these hoes? Blood, that's a no go
Pull up on you bolo, you ain't from my hood? Then don't go
'Fore I do a skit with you, I'll take Michelle and Coco
And that's on Bloods, we ain't gon' sub you we gon' pluck you
Use to call your mama TT, now it's fuck her like it's fuck you
I do what I want too, we the ones you gotta go through
Inner circle smoke, it's funk with niggas that I'm close to
I been off the porch and bangin' fourth since '01, '02
Said you need him torched, I gotta source that we can go to

Keep it a whole hunnid
You ain't contribute to this table, niggas can't hold nothin' (you can't hold shit)
They speakin' down while you ain't 'round, I tried to told youngin' (fuck 'em)
He bought a Drac' with all this pap', ain't gon' smoke nothin'
Keep it a whole hunnid
We out here road runnin' (yeah)
You ain't contribute to this table, niggas can't hold nothin' (none)
They speakin' down while you ain't 'round I tried to told youngin'
He hit the pen and bought a shank but ain't gon' poke nothin'
Keep it a whole hunnid

I ain't never told nothin' at all, road runner
I'm still spendin' dope money, them old hunnids
Mister get your ho goin' on store runs
I done bought less cars and more guns
I'm the type to cop arms with show funds
Niggas fake teasin' lo's, post one
Mister I'll still blow somethin' on both of 'em
Got the bag it was four somethin', who want one? (Ayy)
Y'all ain't out here steppin', nigga, keep it a hunnid
I was takin' hits and I ain't even need the money
Playin', you won't make the summer, niggas pray I never get bored
We already quarantined, we tryna catch ten more
True story

Keep it a whole hunnid
You ain't contribute to this table, niggas can't hold nothin'
They speakin' down while you ain't 'round, I tried to told youngin'
He bought a Drac' with all this pap', ain't gon' smoke nothin'
Keep it a whole hunnid
We out here road runnin'
You ain't contribute to this table, niggas can't hold nothin'
They speakin' down while you ain't 'round, I tried to told youngin'
He hit the pen and bought a shank but ain't gon' poke nothin'
Keep it a whole hunnid
