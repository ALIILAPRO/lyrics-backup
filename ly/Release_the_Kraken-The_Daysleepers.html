		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What's the matter brother, does the drought got you down?
(Open up the bomb shelter, sweep it on out)
Sing to the ocean in the afternoon haze
Up the iron pillars, rise in the waves

Andromeda is weeping. Inside one teardrop swims
Brave Useless in training less a millimeter thin

Release the Kraken
Get the sacrifice on!RELEASE THE KRAKEN
Good God ya'll

Useless the Younger we pray for you
You know we got your back in whatever you do
Bathysphere bobbing in Eyeball Bay
Black lash crashes, forty foot waves

Cepheus is holding Cassiopeia's free hand
As the Kraken breaks the surface making bee-line to the land

In Greek legend the son of Zeus and Danae
He and his mother was set adrift in a chest, but rescued by the intervention of Zeus
He was brought up by King Polydectes
Who, wishing to secure Danae, got rid of him by encouraging him
In the almost hopeless task of obtaining the head of the medusa
With the help of the gods he was successful, and with the head
Which turned all that looked on it into stone, he rescued Andromeda
And later metamorphosed Polydectes and his guests to stone
