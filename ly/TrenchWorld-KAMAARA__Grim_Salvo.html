		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Inexplicable the lost boy knows
How to snuff out his soul just like the pros
Sleep fever apparitions while we doze
Indivisible from misery
Takin' all these liberties
Inexplicable the lost boy knows
How to snuff out his soul just like the pros
Sleep fever apparitions while we doze
Indivisible from misery
Takin' all these liberties

What's the matter pitter patter like
The maggots on your skull
After splatter on a platter someone
Had to pay the toll for the truth
Break me loose stop comparing me to you
I'm the one who dug the
Roots while you simply overlooked
You silly hoe
You give and go until you cannot give nomore
You're in a room with sloppy joes
Who only wanna steal your goals
Inexplicable the lost boy knows
The last to knows the first to go
So what the fuck you in here for?
My demeanor, temper teater
Spike the meter I don't need a heater
Disembody with a cleaver baby I'm a keeper
You're a shitter, that's a
Pisser, under pressure, get the shivers
Overdosage get the jitters all
Because you miss her

Inexplicable the lost boy knows
How to snuff out his soul just like the pros
Sleep fever apparitions while we doze
Indivisible from misery
Takin' all these liberties

Face to face with in this race
You been mislead by ones ahead
I think it's time we cut the chase
And break a path to separate ways
That can't be trace by leeching fucks
Who only seem to suck
Till there is no more inside the core
And seep into the ruts
You can brag about your placement but your
Simply overrated by the simple vacant minded
Who are swindled by your greatness
Get addicted to the fragrance start adapting
To their cadence I won't lie
Down with the fallen
Think it's time to make some changes

You muh fucka you a blood sucka
Collecting septic in the trenches till
You're one of us you muh fucka
You a blood sucka
Collecting septic in the trenches till
You're one of us

Can't run from it
I use you to comfort momentary divides
Numb from it... roll it over so it stays alive

I beat up, I beat up i beat up your demeanor
Yes indeed
I mean I breathe the cold evergreens
Do I even need a reason? I beat up
I beat up your demeanor yes indeed
I mean I need the cold kerosine
Bleed the heathen

Can't run from it
I use you to comfort momentary divides
Numb from it... roll it over so it stays alive

You muh fucka you a blood sucka
Collecting septic in the trenches till
You're one of us you muh fucka
You a blood sucka
Collecting septic in the trenches till
You're one of us

Ahhh... Ahhh
Centipede step, hundred checks on the ceiling
Ahhh... Ahhh
Visceral ends, meet my friend new beginnings
Ahhh... Ahhh
Centipede step, hundred checks on the ceiling
Ahhh... Ahhh
Visceral ends, meet my friend new beginnings
