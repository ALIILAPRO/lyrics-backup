		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There was a time some time ago
When every sunrise meant a sunny day, oh a sunny day
But now when the morning light shines in
It only disturbs the dreamland where I lay, oh where I lay
I used to thank the lord when I'd wake
For life and love and the golden sky above me
But now I pray the stars will go on shinin'
You see in my dreams you love me

Daybreak is a joyful time
Just listen to the songbird harmonies, oh the harmonies
But, I wish the dawn would never come
I wish there was silence in the trees, oh the trees
If only I could stay asleep
At least I could pretend you're thinkin' of me
'Cause nighttime is the one time I am happy
You see in my dreams

We climb and climb and at the top we fly
Let the world go on below us
We are lost in time
And I don't know really what it means
All I know is that you love me
In my dreams

I keep hopin' one day I'll awaken
And somehow she'll be lying by my side
And as I wonder if the dawn is really breakin'
She touches me and suddenly I'm alive

And, we climb and climb and at the top we fly
Let the world go on below us
We are lost in time
And I don't know really what it means
All I know is that you love me
In my dreams

And we climb and climb and at the top we fly
Let the world go on below us
We are lost in time
And I don't know really what it means
All I know is that you love me
In my dreams, oh oh oh oh 
In my dreams
