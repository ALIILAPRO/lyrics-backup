		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Somethin' 'bout the way that you talk to me
Even when you're not around, I feel you boy, I feel you boy, yeah
Tangled in your love and your energy
Perhaps it was the way that you smiled
I see you boy, oh I need you boy, yeah, yeah, yeah

I've been waitin' my whole life, to find someone like you
Find someone like you, yeah, yeah, yeah
I've been waitin' my whole life, to find someone like you
Find someone like you
Baby I, I want this, I want this to last forever
Baby I, I want this, can we make this last forever?

Nothing's ever perfect but you're perfect to me (uh huh)
And fuck bein' asleep, you're a dream, I need you
Though we got a past, I want you, yeah
And even when it's bad, I love you

I've been waitin' my whole life, to find someone like you
Find someone like you, yeah, yeah, yeah
I've been waitin' my whole life, to find someone like you
Find someone like you (oh, baby, can we make it last, yeah?)
So baby I, I want this (oh I)
I want this to last forever (we can make it last)
Oh yeah
Baby I, I want this
Can we make this last forever? 
(Baby can we, can we make it last, yeah?), Oh yeah, yeah

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

I've been waitin' my whole life, to find someone like you (like you)
Find someone like you (like you, you, yeah)
I've been waitin' my whole life, to find someone like you
Find someone like you (tell me can we make it last, yeah?)
I want this (yeah), I want this to last forever (oh, I), ooh, ooh
I want this (I want this, oh)
Can we make this last forever? (Yeah, yeah), ooh, ooh

Ooh, ooh
