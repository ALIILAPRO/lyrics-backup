		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I stand in front the mirror
But I don't like who's looking back at me 
Wish I could see things clearer, oh
Like who I'm supposed to be 
In every trial, lift me higher 
Through the fire, hold me tighter 
Remind me again, I was made for more 

Who I am in the eyes of the Father
Who I am His love set free
Who I was I left at the alter
I am Yours Lord, I believe 

It's who I am
I'm a child of the most-high God and the most-high God's for me
It's who I am
I'm a child of the most-high God and the most-high God's for me

Everything has been changing
You haven't left a stone unturned 
Anything I've been facing, oh
I'll keep standing on Your word
In the water, take me under 
Fill my lungs to, to speak Your wonder 
You brought me of the darkness, I was made for more 

Who I am in the eyes of the Father
Who I am His love set free 
Who I was I left at the alter
I am Yours, Lord, I believe 

It's who I am
I'm a child of the most-high God and the most-high God's for me
It's who I am
I'm a child of the most-high God and the most-high God's for me

You gave up everything
For me to have everything 
For all of eternity
A song in my lungs to sing

You gave up everything
For me to have everything 
For all of eternity
A song in my lungs to sing

I'm a child of the most-high God and the most-high God's for me
I'm a child of the most-high God and the most-high God's for me

It's who I am in the eyes of the Father
Who I am His love set free
Who I was I left at the alter
I am Yours Lord, I believe 

It's who I am
I'm a child of the most-high God and the most-high God's for me
It's who I am
I'm a child of the most-high God and the most-high God's for me

I'm a child of the most-high God and the most-high God's for me
I'm a child of the most-high God and the most-high God's for me
