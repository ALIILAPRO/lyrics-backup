		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We don't need no education
We don't need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teacher leave them kids alone
Hey, teacher, leave them kids alone!
All in all it's just another brick in the wall.

We don't need no education
We don't need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teacher leave them kids alone
Hey, teacher, leave them kids alone!
All in all it's just another brick in the wall.
(All in all you're just) another brick in the wall.

(Brick in the wall)

We don't need no education
We don't need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teacher leave them kids alone

We don't need no education
