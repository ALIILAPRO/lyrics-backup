		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We're only humans floating on a rock
But I think that you are made of stardust
Unconditional, you put up with so much
I can never repay the way you love
Back to the sky, we all have to fly back home, back home
The sweetest goodbyes are never with smiles at all

But when our lives are running out
And your heartbeat has taken the draw
Could you try to look around?
I'll be there to pull you back up
I'll be around you
I'm nothing without you
I won't leave you alone
'Cause when the stars are falling down
There's love in the dark
(I'll be there)
(I'll be there)
There's love in the dark
(I'll be there)
(I'll be there)

I'd do anything to relive our memories
And listen to your songs play in my head
'Cause I hate the silence, it's the only thing I get
I wish I could hear your voice once again
And your heartbeat, all of the small things, oh, oh
The sweetest goodbyes are never with smiles at all

But when our lives are running out
And your heartbeat has taken the draw
Could you try to look around?
I'll be there to pull you back up
I'll be around you
I'm nothing without you
And I can't leave you alone
And when the stars are falling down
There's love in the dark
(I'll be there)
(I'll be there)

I thank God for everything
That you showed me, that you showed me, yeah
And I thank God for everything
That you showed me, that you showed me

But when our lives are running out
And your heartbeat has taken the draw
Could you try to look around?
I'll be there to pull you back up
I'll be around you
I'm nothing without you
And I can't leave you alone
And when the stars are falling down
There's love in the dark
