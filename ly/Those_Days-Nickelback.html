		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Remember when the streetlights came on
And we had to be home?
Remember when Elm Street came on?
Couldn't watch it alone
Remember every prank call we made?
And star sixty-nine
Remember trying to hit eighty-eight
To go back in time?
Remember when they played Purple Rain
To our first slow dance?
Remember when we thought that first base
Was just holding hands?

Those days come back in the dead of night
Those days that felt like another life
What would you be doin' back in those days?

We'd be turnin' up the stereo
And play it everywhere we'd go
And so did everyone we'd know in those days
And everybody got to fall in love
With every movie made for us
God, I couldn't get enough of those days

Remember every poster we had
Hanging on the wall?
Remember every t-shirt we stole
From the local mall? (Ace of Spades by Mot√∂rhead)
Remember Guns n' Roses came out?
We were standin' in line
Remember front row at that show?
Camped out all night (got so high, Sweet Child O' Mine)

Those days come back in the dead of night
Those days that felt like another life
What would you be doin' back in those days?

We'd be turnin' up the stereo
And play it everywhere we'd go
And so did everyone we'd know in those days
And everybody got to fall in love
With every movie made for us
God, I couldn't get enough of those days

The time we'd waste, 'cause life could wait
What we'd give to relive just a single day
The time we'd waste, 'cause life could wait
What we'd give to relive just a single day
Instead of turnin' the page

We'd be turnin' up the stereo
And play it everywhere we'd go
And so did everyone we'd know in those days
And everybody got to fall in love
With every movie made for us
God, I couldn't get enough of those days

Those days that felt like another life
Those days come back in the dead of night
Those days that felt like another life
What would you be doin' back in those days?
