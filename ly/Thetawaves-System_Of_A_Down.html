		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The unsettled mind is at times an ally
Leaving the senses to fend for themselves
The senses collect undeniable data
Of beta-carotene and thetawaves

The unsettled mind is at times an ally
Leaving the senses to fend for themselves
Then the senses wanted the sky

All rise
Eyes bow

Time feels like a midnight ride
Finality waits outside
Weeping in perplexity's arms
Caressing our smiles inside

The national debt is at times an ally
Leaving the people to fend for themselves
The people collect undeniable data
'Bout high pulse weapons and microwaves

The national debt is at times an ally
Leaving the people to fend for themselves
Then the people found out the lie

All rise
Eyes bow
Now our eyes
Have been found

Time feels like a midnight ride
Finality waits outside
Weeping in perplexity's arms
Caressing our smiles inside

Wanting to get you high
Wanting to touch the sky

All rise
Eyes bow
Now our eyes
Have been found

Time feels like a midnight ride
Finality waits outside
Weeping in perplexity's arms
Caressing our smiles in-
