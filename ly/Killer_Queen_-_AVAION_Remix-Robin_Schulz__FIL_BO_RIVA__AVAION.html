		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mm
Mm

She's a good girl, she's a killer queen
Beneath her, I will never shine
I never hold her, hold her hands again
I'll never seen you live like this

It's alright, if you're my lady, you're a killer queen
And I don't mind, you make me crazy
And it's alright, if you're my lady, you're a killer queen
And I don't mind, you make me crazy

Killer queen
(Killer, killer, killer queen)
Killer queen
Killer, killer, killer queen

You never real-, you never realized, you never said goodbye, yeah
I called you up sometimes, I told you that I miss you, babe
And you were stuck inside my head
Oh, and then you told me, "Baby, you can say
Everything you have to say, okay"
Let it be and start to pray (hallelujah, hallelujah)
And you will never see me again
You'll never hold my hand
Another love, another man

And it's alright, if you're my lady, you're a killer queen
And I don't mind, you make me crazy
And it's alright, if you're my lady, you're a killer queen
And I don't mind, I don't mind, I don't mind

Killer queen
(Killer, killer, killer queen)
Killer queen, oh

It's alright, it's okay, I don't mind if you're gone
You're away
It's alright, it's okay, I don't mind if you're gone
You're away
It's alright, it's okay, I don't mind if you're gone
You're away
It's alright, it's okay, I don't mind if you're gone

It's alright, if you're my lady, you're a killer queen
And I don't mind, you make me crazy
And it's alright, if you're my lady, you're a killer queen
And I don't mind, I don't mind, I don't mind

Killer queen
(Killer, killer, killer queen)
Killer queen
(Killer, killer, killer queen)
