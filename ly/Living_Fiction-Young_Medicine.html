		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I, I, I need a machine to breathe
I need a crutch to stand on my own two feet
What If I don't see the end
I, I, I  need you to make believe 
That this time won't be the last you'll see me
What if I don't see the end

Take my heart
Show me you mean it
Break my heart
The only thing that's left
Count these scars
I've come this far for you to 
Tell me that it's not enough

Take my heart
Show me you mean it
Break my heart
The only thing that's left
Count these scars
I've come this far for you to 
Tell me that it's not enough

Not enough

Look at it this way, I've traveled my whole life
On roads that have no endings, driving blind
When every hope and every dream is falling through
Who will save me
You're not a lost cause, I have to tell myself
I'm shedding skin and bones on pedestals
But don't you say that I'm afraid of rejection
I fear obscurity

What if I don't see the end

Take my heart
Show me you mean it
Break my heart
The only thing that's left
Count these scars
I've come this far for you to 
Tell me that it's not enough

Take my heart
Show me you mean it
Break my heart
The only thing that's left
Count these scars
I've come this far for you to 
Tell me that it's not enough

Not enough

Take my heart
Show me you mean it
Break my heart
The only thing that's left
Count these scars
I've come this far for you to 
Tell me that it's not enough
	
Take my heart
Show me you mean it
Break my heart
The only thing that's left
Count these scars
I've come this far for you to 
Tell me that it's not enough
