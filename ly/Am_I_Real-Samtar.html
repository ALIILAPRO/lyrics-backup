		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What's happening to me
What's happening to me
What's happening to me
What's happening to me

I feel too hard, too late
She can't, she can't wait
The pain that you embrace
It's more than I can take

Everything you said
Comes to me in a dream
I can't make sense of it
I wanted to tell you
Everything that I think
But all I can do
Is just keep running
Broken all the days
That slowly pass me by
What do you know
Are you really there
Can you prove it to me
Who you really are
