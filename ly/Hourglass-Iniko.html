		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Truth is that I Thought I had time
Thought I had time to fix it
Truth is that I Left you high and dry
And made you feel neglected

One day I looked over at the hour glass
And all the sand was at the bottom
Tried to turn it over, tried to start again
But it just shattered in my hand

Into tiny broken pieces Into splinters in my hands they really mean it when they tell you you can't get back the time once it's gone

It's gone

Truth is that
Really did try But still took you for granted
Truth is that we Weren't good for me
But I didn't know the answers

One day I looked over at the hour glass
And all the sand was at the bottom
Tried to turn it over, tried to start again
But it just shattered in my hand
Into tiny broken pieces
Into splinters in my hands they really mean it when they tell you can't get back the time once it's gone
It's gone
