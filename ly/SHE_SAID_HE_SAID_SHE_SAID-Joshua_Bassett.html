		  (She said, he said, she said)
(She said, he said, she said)

I saw you in the back of the room
Takin' shots with your friends again
You talk shit, like you always do
I guess high school never ends
You sure got a lot to say
When you're talkin' on my name
You sure got a lot to say
But did you tell them everything?

Oh, and when you dance with the Devil
The Devil gon' dance with you
Oh, and when you play with fire
The flame's gon' burn you too

you're starting rumors
It's nothing new, yeah
We're on this shit again
She said, he said, she said
Just can't get over
I let you go, yeah
Let's put this shit to bed
She said, he said, she said

She said, he said, she said (ohh)
She said, he said, she said
She said, he said, she said
She said, he said, she said

Night ends and you call me again
Say you didn't mean what you said
But drunk talks are sober thoughts
So don't act so innocent
I can't keep playing games
When your rules are always changing, so
If you're saying sorry you can save it

Oh, and when you dance with the Devil
The Devil gon' dance with you
Oh, and when you play with fire
The flame's gon' burn you too

you're starting rumors
It's nothing new, yeah
We're on this shit again
She said, he said, she said
Just can't get over (just can't get over)
I let you go, yeah (let you go, yeah)
Let's put this shit to bed
She said, he said, she said

She said, he said, she said
She said, he said, she said
She said, he said, she said (she said)
She said, he said, she said (she said)

(Ohh)
(She said, he said, she said)

Burn your bridge, talk your shit
I've been growin' thicker skin
Forgiveness? Ask again
Patience only runs so thin

you're starting rumors
It's nothing new, yeah
We're on this shit again
She said, he said, she said
Just can't get over
I let you go, yeah (ohh)
Let's put this shit to bed
She said, he said, she said
