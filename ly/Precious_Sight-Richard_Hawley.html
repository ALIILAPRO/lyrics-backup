		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Smallwood, a joiner, takes carpenter out for a meal 
As soon as we dock see the captain to get a better deal 
My darkness in mind is concealed 
I'm in here alone and unreal 
But not anymore 
Not anymore 

Up above and outside we looked towards the stern of the ship
Weighed up the anchor and then I decided to slip 
Land well in middle and row 
I'm tired of deceiving my soul 
But not anymore 
Not anymore

Won't be at this station too long 
Took too many journeys alone 
But not anymore 
Not anymore

I leap the boat clear without paying my bills, I just left here
Precious sight in my eyes as I take the last dive, I shed no tears
I'm taking a guess 
This life is a mess 
But not anymore 
Not anymore
