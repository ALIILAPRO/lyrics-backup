		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Caught off guard
All worked up
the air is as dark and cold as night
let me go
I'm not done
I swear I'll take just one lifetime, and I
I won't lie I won't sin maybe I don't wana go
can't you wait?, Maybe I don't wana go (chorus)
I should have asked, I could of helped
at least a fucking thousand times before will this offer get me in or does this prove that they gave more (chorus)x2
