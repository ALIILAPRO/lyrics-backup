		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  Are you kidding me?
I'm getting sick of the industry
I've had enough of the make believe 
Oh please, oh please

Am I lost or found?
I'm getting sick of the ups and downs
No need to give me the run around
I'm out, I'm out

This shit's gonna kill me but I won't let it
And I try to give 'em hell but they don't get it
So I tell myself when I sleep at night
Don't lose sight, baby, don't lose sight

And they try to give me up but I won't give in
And this life will get ya down but I keep livin' 
So I tell myself when I sleep at night
Don't lose sight, baby, don't lose sight

Don't lose sight, baby, don't lose sight

Are you kidding me?
I'm getting sick of the in-between
Running in place isn't interesting
To me, to me

Am I good enough?
Does that even matter or is it luck?
I'm checking the prices on giving up
Now what? Now what?

This shit's gonna kill me but I won't let it
And I try to give 'em hell but they don't get it
So I tell myself when I sleep at night
Don't lose sight, baby, don't lose sight

And they try to give me up but I won't give in
And this life will get ya down but I keep livin' 
So I tell myself when I sleep at night
Don't lose sight, baby, don't lose sight

Don't lose sight, baby, don't lose sight
Don't lose sight, baby, don't lose sight

And this shit ain't ever gonna change
It ain't ever gonna change
It ain't ever gonna change

And this shit ain't ever gonna change
It ain't ever gonna change
It ain't ever gonna change

(This shit's gonna kill me but I won't let it)
And this shit ain't ever gonna change
(This shit's gonna kill me but I won't let it)
It ain't ever gonna change
So I tell myself when I sleep at night

This shit's gonna kill me but I won't let it
And I try to give 'em hell but they don't get it
So I tell myself when I sleep at night
Don't lose sight, baby, don't lose sight

And they try to give me up but I won't give in (and this shit ain't ever gonna change)
And this life will get ya down but I keep livin' (but I'm never gonna change)
So I tell myself when I sleep at night (it ain't ever gonna)
Don't lose sight, baby, don't lose sight
