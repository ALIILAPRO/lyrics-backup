		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They tried to put me in the dirt (Yung Lan on the track)
I had to take her to pound town, after I put a nigga on a shirt
I told her that I got two phones, my nigga, I'm movin' with purpose
Stickin' to the codes goin' on, these niggas be fightin' them Percs
I bought this shit off drug money, nigga better not step on my turf
I hang around with some real killers, if you scared then go to church
I ain't wanna get on no gangsta shit, but fuck-nigga tried me first
I look at me like I'm blessed, but the opps might look at me like I'm cursed

Look at all this pain I bring, slide through and paint the scene
Bitch I'm like a famous king, I should do famous things
I put shit on gangsta lean, don't put my name in things
'Cause when you say my name it rings, and that starts changin' things (yeah, oh)
I'm addicted to money
I'm addicted to bitches that got good pussy, but can't do nothin' for me
I laugh to keep from cryin', but really it ain't shit funny
Every decision I make be for my kids, they can't go hungry
Nah, they can't go hungry
Bitch, I'm pressure, that's why I ain't text you
Look at me, don't it look like I need extra?
Bitch, I'm not regular, drivin' some shit that don't come out 'til next year
Shit came with Alexa
I don't want shit that's gon' come with electric
I call it collectors, I'm just like Hugh Hefner, uh
Diamond charm, protected with the glizzy, yeah
From the slums, you ain't really with me, yeah
You a pawn, you ain't really did it, yeah
Bubble gum, pull up with the sticky, yeah

They tried to put me in the dirt
I had to take her to pound town, after I put a nigga on a shirt
I told her that I got two phones, my nigga, I'm movin' with purpose
Stickin' to the codes goin' on, these niggas be fightin' them Percs
I bought this shit off drug money, nigga better not step on my turf
I hang around with some real killers, if you scared then go to church
I ain't wanna get on no gangsta shit, but fuck-nigga tried me first
I look at me like I'm blessed, but the opps might look at me like I'm cursed
(The opps might look at me like I'm cursed)
