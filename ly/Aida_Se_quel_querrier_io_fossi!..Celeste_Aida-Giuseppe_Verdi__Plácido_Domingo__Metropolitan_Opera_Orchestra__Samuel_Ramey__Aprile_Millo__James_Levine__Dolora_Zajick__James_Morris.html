		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When you were mine
I gave you all of my money
Time after time
You done me wrong
Just like a train
Let all my friends come over and eat
You were so strange
You didn't have the decency to change the sheets
Oh when you were mine
I use to let you wear all my clothes
You were so fine
Maybe that's the reason that it hurt me so

I know, that you're goin' with another guy
I don't care, 'cause I love you baby that's no lie
I love you more mine than I did when you were mine

When you were mine
You were kindasorta my best friend
So I was blind
I let you fool around
I never cared
I never was the kind to make a fuss
When he was there
Sleepin' in between the two of us

I know, that you're goin with another guy
I don't care, 'cause I love you baby that's no lie
I love you more than I did when you were mine

When you were mine
You were all I ever wanted to do
Now I spend my time
Following him whenever he's with you
I know that you're goin' with another guy
I don't care because I love you baby that's no lie, ah
I love you more than I did when you were mine

Ah I love you more than I did when you were mine
Ah oh oh whoa I love you more than I did when you were mine
Ah oh oh whoa I love you more, I love you more when you were mine
Ah ah oh oh oh I love you more, I love your more, I love you more, I love you more

I love you more than when you were mine

Ah oh oh
