		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've got a situation, this girl been stressing me
Saying she better be the only one
My life is complicated, she's only 23
I'm not the guy that she's supposed to love

Oh the more that I tell her I'm not staying over
The harder she makes it to go
Oh the more that I try to convince her this won't work
The faster she takes off her clothes

Girl you've gotta slow it down
I'm not tryna fall for you
Girl you've gotta slow it down
I can't give it all to you
Even though I want to

She knows just what she doing
She fucking with my head
Wrapping her legs so tight around my waist
Two in the afternoon
But we still ain't out of bed
No matter what she always gets her way

Oh the more that I tell her I'm not staying over
The harder she makes it to go (you make is so hard)
Oh the more that I try to convince her this won't work
The faster she takes off her clothes

Girl you've gotta slow it down
I'm not tryna fall for you
Girl you've gotta slow it down
I can't give it all to you
Even though I want to, hey
Even though I want to, oh oh oh

You've got to slow it, slow it down baby
You've got to slow it down
You don't know what you doing to me now
You've got to slow it, slow it down baby
You've got to slow it down

Girl you've gotta slow it down
I'm not tryna fall for you
Girl you've gotta slow it down
I can't give it all to you
Even though I want to

Ooh you've gotta slow it down, yeah, yeah
