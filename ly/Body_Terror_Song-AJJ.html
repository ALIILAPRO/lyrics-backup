		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I’m so sorry that you have to have a body
I’m so sorry that you have to have a body, oh yeah
I’m very sorry that you have to have a body
One that will hurt you, and be the subject of so much of your fear
It will betray you, be used against you, then it’ll fail on you my dear
But before that, you’ll be a doormat, for every vicious narcissist in the world
Oh how they’ll screw you, all up and over, then feed you silence for dessert
I’m so sorry that you have to have a body
So very sorry that you have to have a body, oh yeah
I'm sorry that you have to have a body
Filled with infection
One hundred scabs singing in unison
Eyes and hands, sometimes bullets,
Uninvited, passing through us
Uninvited, passing through us
I’m sorry that you have to have a body
I’m sorry that you have to have a body
