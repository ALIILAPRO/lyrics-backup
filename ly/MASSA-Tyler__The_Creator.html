		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Whatever your shit is, man, do it
Whatever bring you that immense joy, do that, that's your luxury
The greatest thing that ever happened to me was
Bein' damn near twenty and leavin' Los Angeles for the first time
I got out my bubble, my eyes, just wide
My passport is the most valuable

Master couldn't catch me, my legs long than a bitch
Got too much self respect, I wash my hands 'fore I piss
They try to talk, mmm, I'ma just go

Yeah, when I turned twenty-three that's when puberty finally hit me
My facial hair started growin', my clothes they ain't really fit me
That caterpillar went to cocoon, do you get messy?
I was shiftin', that's really why Cherry Bomb sounded so shifty
My taste started changin' from what it was when they met me
But first impression is everything, ain't wanna let me go
Always curious as a child and askin' questions, so
I ain't give no fucks, if, and, buts if they accept me
Yo, my boy Skateboard P gave me that speech in Italy session, um
Thankfully, but I would do you detour perspective, um
Thoughts change so rapid, turn to butterfly, Flower Boy happened
All the bees buzz, be they buzz, scream, they love me
First time I private airline, accolade, song got airtime
Went to my style, body, and feelings and fixed my hairline
Calmed down in front of cameras, been there since tens of millions
I'm not that little boy I was introduced to at 1-9
Mom was in the shelter when Yonkers dropped, I don't say it (I don't say it)
When I got her out, that's the moment I knew I made it (Yeah)
I don't come from money, they deny it
Since I don't mirror the stereotypical products of my environment
Eight figures in taxes, takin' that shit is stupid
A flower gets his petal, they pluck it, but never use it
It's still potholes in the schools, where does it go?
It's still loopholes that I use, nobody knows

Master couldn't catch me, my legs long than a bitch
Got too much self respect, I wash my hands 'fore I piss
They try to talk me up but I keep short like Caesar
Eyes open if I pray 'cause I can't trust God either, uh

See, right there, you got one life to live
How far you really wanna take it?
Don't let 'em ever tell you nothin' you can't do

Yeah, I purchase more wheels when I feel like I'm third-wheelin'
My favorite part of the double R is the bird ceilin'
The panoramic view of the sky and the Sun beamin'
That ray of light show that nobody is front-seatin'
I'm on the hunt for perfect but decent is what I been on
I know she fell in love but commitment is not my end goal
And all my friends that did got too comfy, a little chubby
And that drive to make that money dried up when that nose is runny
We ain't gotta pay attention to the stuff that he battles
Everyone I ever loved had to be loved in the shadows
Tug-o-war with X and Y, felt like a custody battle
Felt like the boat goin' down, it felt like I'm missin' a paddle
Might buy that crib in Seattle, covered in grass, light, and gravel (yeah)
It come with two boats and cattle, I'm livin' sweet, ain't you heard?
This perspective from the beak of a bird
Just hope I peek and take my peace
You gon' see me and run, like thieves in the night
I'm paranoid, I sleep with a gun
The heat on my dungarees because they beefin' for fun
I'm vegan for now, I'm conscious, know my hands meet when I bow
I'm grateful, you niggas hateful, you eat at me, you got a plateful
You can't relate to these things I say to instrumentals
Whether it's wealth talk or shit that's painful
I paint full pictures of my perspective on these drum breaks
Just for you to tell me, "It's not good," from your lunch break

Holiday season
A vision you have to understand from perspective
Check your resources, nigga
