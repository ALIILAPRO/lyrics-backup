		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A couple more tequilas
And I'll tell you how I'm feeling
Don't wanna kill your evening
Don't wanna be a buzz kill
If I'm coming on strong
I'm spending all my money, yeah, yeah
Going up and down the country
Just to leave you on a Monday morning, same old story
Here we go again

Maybe this time I'll
Say something
Something a little wild, out loud
Maybe this time I'll
Say something
I've been feeling for a while, out loud

We're running out of moonlight
Just tryna use the time right
Does it have to be a big deal?
Babe, however you feel
No, I won't
Make a fuss
No, I won't
Cause a scene
And my heart keeps racing, racing
Still I'm over being overkill, and
You don't have to say it back
I just wanna know where your head's at

Maybe this time I'll
Say something
Something a little wild, out loud
Maybe this time I'll
Say something
I've been feeling for a while, out loud

And I'll wait for my moment
Hope you say what I'm hoping
Get it out in the open
Hope you say what I'm hoping

Maybe this time I'll
Say something
Something a little wild, out loud
Maybe this time I'll
Say something
I've been feeling for a while, out loud

And I'll wait for my moment (say something)
Hope you say what I'm hoping
Get it out in the open (say something)
Hope you say what I'm hoping

And my heart keeps racing, racing still
And I'm over being overkill
And my heart keeps racing, racing still
Guess I'm over being overkill
