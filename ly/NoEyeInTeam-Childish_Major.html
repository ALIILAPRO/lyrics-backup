		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
Ayo, I'm backstage, 4 Your Eyez Only in my city
This a God thing
Shout out J.I.D, he's a motherfucking madman
Me, I'm a Superman, I'm an Ironman or Batman
One time for the Batman
Remember I'm that little nigga runnin' around that J
Every time I turn my back around a nigga hate
Sorry I left out the city made a move out to the A
They ask him is he straight hell nah that nigga great
Girl you can't control shit, round here, please get the fuck back
Pretty penny ain't worth shit
Had to did that
P-d-s-y, up next, workaholics
And me I need a Rolex, Deshawn he need a Rolex
I gets whatever I get make sure my bro get
Believe me if I'm eating, we got the itis
No touch we talking new mils I got the Midas
Do this, just like two clips I'm out here grinding

This is not a I thing, it's a we thing
It's a team thing
This is not a I thing, it's the green mane
Get the green mane
This is not a I thing, it's a we thing
It's a team thing
This is not a I thing, it's the green mane
Get the green mane

If every nigga in your clique is with your clique is rugged
No one would fall because everyone would be each other's crutches
I heard the word, I had to see for myself
I was struggling on my on, I had to go get some help
And ain't nothing wrong with that
This is the real, I cannot chill
I got a song for that (I got two)
When I got the ball, relax
I pass the ball, it's action
I know these hoes distractions
I know these hoes is cancer
I know these hoes is fetish
Get off my dick like Cole said
All I'm trying to do is count bread
Working on my portfolio til it's a full four deal
Back to the city, we can go there
All my little niggas gon' bro there
All my little niggas gon' shine there 'cause all my little niggas grind there

This is not a I thing, it's a we thing
It's a team thing
This is not a I thing, it's the green mane
Get the green mane
This is not a I thing, it's a we thing
It's a team thing
This is not a I thing, it's the green mane
Get the green mane
