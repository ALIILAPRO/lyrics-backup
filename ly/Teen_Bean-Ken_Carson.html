		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She like
"Ain't you Ken Carson? Ain’t you Teen X?"
"Can you call your partner up for me
And ask where them beans at?"
I told that bitch I love her
But I really did not mean that my jeans
They Undercover and I'm rockin'
A Blackmeans jacket
And my shoes, they undiscovered
Bet you cannot find where these at
He wanna swag like me, yeah
He wanna be like Teen X
He wanna be like Teen Bean
Now he pourin’ up lean
And he rollin' up weed
Bought a Teen X hoodiе and a Teen X tee
Give a fuck 'bout that shit
You will never bе me
I go get some money and fuck on a freak
Her boyfriend coming home, so I gotta retreat
But I still got the top
So it's mission complete
I just fuck on that bitch
Then I block and delete her
Might want her for the night
But I do not need her
I'm countin' up Franklins
Ain't talkin' Aretha i’m pourin’ up drank
And I'm rollin’ some weed up
I feel like a boss, I'm kickin' my feet up
If you don't wanna shoot
Then you can get beat up
Got my gun and my shooter, my hands work too
I’m in the moshpit, punching out your crew
It ain't nowhere to go
He don't know what to do
I'm tweetin' on Twitter, I'm going up, ooh
I'm all on Instagram, I'm going up too
She love my aesthetic, she say that I'm cool
I don't give a fuck, bitch
I'm breaking the rules

I don't give a fuck, bitch
I'm breaking the rules
I don't give a fuck, bitch
I'm breaking the rules
I don't give a fuck, bitch
I'm breaking the rules
I don't give a fuck, bitch
I'm breaking the rules

I don't move how you want me to move
I don't do what you want me to do
I do what I want, I do what I please
I don't do this for you, bitch
I do it for me
What I do for you, you wouldn't do it for me
I look out for you, like an owl in a tree
I float like a butterfly, sting like a bee
I feel like the greatest, Muhammad Ali
I'm first and you last, like A and Z
Anything that I do, they pay me a fee
I'm countin' up blue, I'm countin' up green
Everywhere I go, they like
"Ain't this Teen Bean?"
Bitch, I'm Ken Carson, Ecstasy Teen
Your bitch a fan, yeah, she a fiend
We at my hotel, I'm breakin' her spleen
I'm breaking the rules
Give a fuck what you think

I don't give a fuck, bitch
I'm breaking the rules
I don't give a fuck, bitch
I'm breaking the rules
I don't give a fuck, bitch
I'm breaking the rules
I don't give a fuck, bitch
I'm breaking the rules
