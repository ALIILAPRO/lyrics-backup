		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm heavy
I'm by your side
Forget me 'cause I know what I need, like a loser like me could be fine
I'm heavy
Alone inside
Don't tell me what I want, what I need, like a loser like me will be fine
Maybe I'm living in my head
Maybe I'm living to pretend
Maybe I wanna stay in bed
Far from the weight of the world in my hands 'cause they don't understand

Is someone telling me don't get in the water?
What have I done?
I don't wanna get lost inside the color under my tongue
'Cause I don't wanna be in love with another
Even in another life
Can someone tell me it's alright to be covered
Underneath the covers, but I
No, I don't need to sleep anymore

Is someone banging at my door?
When I just wanna be alone?
Is someone banging at my door?
Je ne sais pas qui est ici
Is someone banging at my door
When I just wanna be alone
Is someone banging at my door, door, door, door?
Door, door, door, door, at my door

Is someone banging at my door?
'Cause I just wanna be alone
Yeah, I just wanna be alone
I just wanna be alone
Yeah, I just wanna be alone
