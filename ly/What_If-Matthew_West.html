		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've heard 'em say before to live just like you're dying, yeah
Wish I could say that's how I am but I'd be lying, yeah
Lying in my bed at night, one too many times I'm thinking
What if, what if

My biggest fear is waking up to find what matters
Is miles away from what I spent my life chasing after
Is my story gonna have the same two words in every chapter?
What if, what if

But last I checked, this heart inside my chest
Is still beating
Well, I guess it's not too late

What if today's the only day I got?
I don't wanna waste it if it's my last shot, oh
No regrets, in the end
I wanna know I got no what ifs
I'm running 'til the road runs out
I'm lighting it up, right here, right now, oh
No regrets, in the end
I wanna know I got no what ifs, yeah

See, I refuse to be a shoulda, woulda, coulda been
I can't go back in time, I don't have a DeLorean
What I'm trying to say is I don't wanna hear these words again
What if, what if

But last I checked, this heart inside my chest
Is still beating
Well, I guess it's not too late
Nah, nah

What if today's the only day I got?
I don't wanna waste it if it's my last shot, oh
No regrets, in the end
I wanna know I got no what ifs
I'm running 'til the road runs out
I'm lighting it up, right here, right now, oh
No regrets, in the end
I wanna know I got no what ifs

I'm gonna dream a little bigger
Burn a little brighter
Stand a little taller, closer to Your fire
Dig a little deeper
Reach a little further
Love a little harder
I'm gonna dream a little bigger
Burn a little brighter
Stand a little taller, closer to Your fire
Dig a little deeper
Reach a little further
Love a little harder

'Cause what if today's the only day I got?
I don't wanna waste it if it's my last shot, oh
No regrets, in the end
I wanna know I got no what ifs
I'm running 'til the road runs out
I'm lighting it up, right here, right now, oh
No regrets (nah), in the end
I wanna know I got no what ifs, yeah

Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na (yeah)

I wanna know I got no what ifs

Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na 

I wanna know I got no what ifs
