		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh I don't know why people lie
And I don't know why people die
Every time I see you, you shout at me
'Cause of all the things in the world that I can't see
But what I think goes on in this world
For a mother and a father and a boy and a girl
Is that the more you earn, the less you learn
There's a fire in life where we will burn
 
And I never could believe it
And I never could be true
For the things that mean so much to me
Don't mean that much to you
And I never could believe
The way you told me I was wrong
If I'm right and you are sinful
Then for God's sake I was wrong
 
Oh, I don't know how I think this way,
And yet you sit there looking at me all day
There's more to you than I can see
There's a shadow of another hanging over me
But what I think goes on in this world
For a mother and a father and a boy and a girl
Is that the more you earn, the less you learn
There's a fire in life where we will burn
 
And I never could believe it
And I never could be true
For the things that mean so much to me
Don't mean that much to you
And I never could believe
The way you told me I was wrong
If I'm right and if you're sinful
Then for God's sake I was wrong
 
Oh, I'd tear you out of heaven
And I'd tear you out of hell
And I'd see your life in ruins
Because mine lies there as well
And I'd cry out in my loneliness
While you sleep in your peace
But you'll never see my face again
While I need words like these
