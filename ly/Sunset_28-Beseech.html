		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  ["This song is dedicated to Jennifer Berg that lost her world 00-05-28. Carry on even if it's hard, with love Klas"]

Give her love and protection
Give her all, all the things she need
Give her faith and a reason
Make her feel brighter than the sun

Tell her that she's special
Tell her that she's valuable
Carry on for tomorrow
Carry on even if it's hard

[Chorus]
Leave him in the sunset 28
To remember the moments in the sun
And the diamond that lost her world today
Will keep on shining brighter than the sun

Ease her pain and her guilts
Tell her that no one really knows
Help her find new solutions
Help her while she is still a child
Without no farewell
We will never forget the moments in the sun

[Chorus]
