		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're my oxygen, my very breath
And source of life, the source of rest
Oh I need You
You're the wind that fills, these fragile sails
You carry me, through crashing waves
Oh I need You
Oh

I'm breathing, You in
Yahweh, Yahweh
Breathing You in
Yahweh, Yahweh
Breathing, You in
Yahweh, Yahweh
Breathing You in
Yeah

Stars would have no shine, without Your word
So be the spark, Lord let me burn
Oh I need You
Oh I need You

Burning, within
Yahweh, Yahweh
Burning, within
Yahweh, Yahweh
Burning, within
Yahweh, Yahweh
Burning, within
Oh yeah

You are the great I Am, seated upon the throne
Nothing can take Your place in my heart
I'm bringing all I am, standing with lifted hands
Nothing can take Your place in my heart
In my heart oh

Singing, Your name
Yahweh, Yahweh
Singing, Your name
Yahweh, Yahweh
Singing, Your name
Yahweh, Yahweh
Singing, Your name

Singing, Your name
Yahweh, Yahweh
Singing out Your name
Yahweh, Yahweh
Singing, Your name
Yahweh, Yahweh
Singing out Your name

Singing, Your name
Yahweh, Yahweh
Singing, Your name
Yahweh, Yahweh
Singing, Your name
Yahweh, Yahweh
Singing, Your name

Singing out forever more

Singing, Your name
Yahweh, Yahweh
Singing, Your name
Yahweh, Yahweh
Singing, Your name
Yahweh, Yahweh
Singing, Your name

Sing forever

Singing, Your name
Yahweh
