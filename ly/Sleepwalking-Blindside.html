		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Words so secure screaming like an alarm
Are you trying to wake me up
Now what was that you were trying to pull
Is it my arm
I do believe you're trying to wake me up

But could it be maybe
It's not me sleeping
Could it be maybe you awakening

Sleep this time tonight
Sleepwalk in the light
Sleep this time tonight (one day we'll)
Sleepwalk out of sight

Now here I am, but I'm just sleepwalking
Yes here I stand
But I guess I'm just sleep talking for myself

But could it be maybe
It's not me sleeping
Could it be maybe you awakening

Sleep this time tonight
Sleepwalk in the light
Sleep this time tonight (one day we'll)
Sleepwalk out of sight

One day this world will see me at the horizon
One day from a distant light
And just before I stand to face my love
I'll turn around
And with a smile I'll say my goodbyes
Just one last goodbye
Goodbye
