		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't want your knock on my door
I hear your footsteps on my porch
The least I need is gone away
Stay inside the hurricane

I'm afraid to close my eyes for dreams
I belong to you
In this world, you're for me

I don't need your rock in my world
I don't feel like spinning around
The butterflies are frighten by your words
Terrified by silent sounds

I'm afraid to fall asleep for dreams
You belong to me
In this world, I'm for you

I'm afraid to close my eyes for dreams
I belong to you
In this world, you're for me

I'm afraid to fall asleep for dreams
You belong to me
In this world, I'm for you

I don't need you trembling all around
You're waking up my neighborhood
I don't need you here to hang around
You're poisoning my flower food

I'm afraid to fall asleep for dreams
You belong to me
In this world, I'm for you

I'm afraid to fall asleep for dreams
You belong to me
In this world, I'm for you

I'm afraid to fall asleep for dreams
I belong to you
In this world, you're for me
