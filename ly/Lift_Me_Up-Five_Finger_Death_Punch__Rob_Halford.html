		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It ain't no mystery
I'm all I have left
I'm pushing back running you over

I've been thrown down,
Run around
Beaten 'til I hit the ground
I'm telling you right now that it's over

There's no room for mistakes
All the parts are in place
Say what you will but say it to my face

Better back the fuck up
Better shut the fuck up
I'll do what I want
And I'll never give up

I won't be broken
I won't be tortured
I won't be beaten down

I have the answer
I can take the pressure
I will turn it all around

Lift me up above this
The flames and the ashes
Lift me up and help me to fly away

Lift me up above this
The broken, the empty
Lift me up and help me to fly away

I'm gonna change history
Enlighten the world
Teach 'em how to see through my eyes
I'm gonna lash back check that fate as a heart attack
Stomp out all the ugliest lies

You can't convince me to change
We ain't on the same page
I've had my fill
There's nothing but rage

Best get out of my way 'cause there's nothing to say
Is that all you got because I ain't got all day

I won't be broken
I won't be tortured
I won't be beaten down

I have the answer
I can take the pressure
I will turn it all around

Lift me up above this
The flames and the ashes
Lift me up and help me to fly away

Lift me up above this
The broken, the empty
Lift me up and help me to fly away

I won't be broken
I won't be tortured
I won't be beaten down

I have the answer
I can take the pressure
I will turn it all around

Lift me up above this
The flames and the ashes
Lift me up and help me to fly away

Lift me up above this
The broken, the empty
Lift me up and help me to fly away

Lift me up to fly away
Lift me up to fly away
Lift me up
