		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Keep on dancing in the streets
Keep on dancing in the streets
Keep on dancing in the streets
Keep on dancing in the streets

Dancing in the streets
With any one you got to meet
Moving to the rhythm
Let your body feel the beat
Dancing in the streets
Let your feelings hanging out
Give it all you've got
Keep on dancing, sing and shout!

Keep on dancing in the streets
Keep on dancing in the streets
Keep on dancing in the streets
Keep on dancing in the streets

Dancing in the streets
With any one you got to meet
Moving to the rhythm
Let your body feel the beat
Dancing in the streets
Let your feelings hanging out
Give it all you've got
Keep on dancing, sing and shout!

Keep on dancing in the streets
Keep on dancing in the streets
Keep on dancing in the streets
Keep on dancing in the streets

Keep on, keep on, keep on dancing
Keep on, keep on, keep on dancing
Keep on, keep on, keep on dancing
Keep on, keep on, keep on dancing

Keep on, keep on, keep on dancing
Keep on, keep on, keep on dancing

Keep on dancing in the streets
Keep on dancing in the streets
Keep on dancing in the streets
Keep on dancing in the streets
Keep on dancing in the streets
Keep on dancing in the streets
Keep on dancing in the streets
Keep on dancing in the streets
Keep on dancing in the streets
Keep on dancing in the streets
Keep on...
