		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So here we are
Like we were
To feed apart
In different worlds
No need to say
Another word
No, I should leave
But I don't wanna go just yet
'Cause I'm not really over it

You remind my heart
Of a lie I wish you never told
But it's all I've got
Just five more minutes and I'm gone
Same old song like an echo, ooh
'Cause I know I'm better off alone
It is my pride and I really know I shouldn't stay but I don't wanna go

Now that I know the way it ends
The words we chose, irrelevant
Let's just pretend a little bit
I know I should leave but
I don't wanna go just yet
'Cause I'm not really over it

You remind my heart (you remind my heart)
Of a lie I wish you never told
But it's all I've got (all I've got)
Just five more minutes and I'll go
(Five more minutes and I'll go)
Same old song like an echo, ooh
'Cause I know I'm better off alone (better off alone)
It is my pride and I really know I shouldn't stay but I don't wanna go
(Ooh, ooh)

Just five more minutes and I'll go
(Five more minutes and I'll go) 
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Shouldn't stay but I don't wanna go
Same old song like an echo (ooh, ooh, ooh)
(I'm better off alone)
It is my pride and I really know I shouldn't stay but I don't wanna go
