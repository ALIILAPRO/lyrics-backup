		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I stand in the distance
I view from a far 
Should I offer some assistance 
Should it matter who you are 

We all get hurt by love 
And we all have our cross to bear 
But in the name of understanding now 
Our problems should be shared 

Confide in me, Confide in me 
Confide in me, Confide in me

I can keep a secret 
And throw away the key
But sometimes to release it 
Is to set our children free 

We all get hurt by love 
And we all have our cross to bear 

Confide in me, Confide in me 
Confide in me, Confide in me
