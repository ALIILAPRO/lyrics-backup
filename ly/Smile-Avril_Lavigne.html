		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You know that I'm a crazy bitch
I do what I want when I feel like it
All I wanna do is lose control (oh, oh)
But you don't really give a shit
You go with it, go with it, go with it
'Cause you're fucking crazy rock n' roll

You said hey
What's your name
It took one look
And now I'm not the same
Yeah you said hey
And since that day
You stole my heart
And you're the one to blame

Yeah, and that's why I smile
It's been a while
Since every day and everything has
Felt this right
And now you turn it all around
And suddenly you're all I need

The reason why
I, I, I, I smile, oh oh oh

Last night I blacked out I think
What did you, what did you put in my drink
I remember making out and then (oh, oh)
I woke up with a new tattoo
Your name was on me and my name was on you
I would do it all over again

You said hey (hey)
What's your name (what's your name)
It took one look
And now I'm not the same
Yeah you said hey (hey)
Since that day (since that day)
You stole my heart
And you're the one to blame

Yeah, and that's why I smile
It's been a while
Since every day and everything has
Felt this right
And now you turn it all around
And suddenly you're all I need

The reason why
I, I, I, I smile, oh oh oh
The reason why
I, I, I, I smile, oh oh oh

You know that I'm a crazy bitch
I do what I want when I feel like it
All I wanna do is lose control
You know that I'm a crazy bitch
I do what I want when I feel like it
All I wanna do is lose control

Yeah, and that's why I smile
It's been a while
Since every day and everything has
Felt this right
And now you turn it all around
And suddenly you're all I need

The reason why
I, I, I, I smile, oh oh oh
The reason, the reason why
I, I, I, I smile, oh oh oh

The reason why
I, I, I, I smile, oh oh oh
