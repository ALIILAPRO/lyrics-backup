		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  when I ask you to look at me
you look away.
I ask you to tell me something nice once.
you come at me with all your hot lights on display.
I know you're changing.
damn you.
I know you're changing.
god damn you for that.

when the snow stacked up outside,
you looked around.
I could see you from the window.
I could see the snow coming down.
I know you're changing.
damn you.
I know you're changing.
god damn you.
