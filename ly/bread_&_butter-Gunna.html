		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Goin' all out when it's 'bout that bread and butter
They'll kill for clout, I put that on my dead brother, yeah
He talk so much, I showed him I'm a real hunter
Won't say it, but he know I still got real cutters, yeah
Yeah, I'm right back and I lost mad commas
I had been down bad inside a dark tunnel, yeah
Fuck them boys, I found out who my real partners
And who was only with me 'cause I had dollars

Never fucked a nigga, always stayed solid
Kept it real with niggas, never lied and always stay honest
Love my bro so much, I never change on 'em
Hunna Wunna go and do the work, bring you the damn profits
Hustled on my own, I always did know how to sell product
They ain't gave me shit, I grind so long, came from the damn bottom
Every nigga speakin' on my name could have some real problems
We are not the same, ain't in my lane, I got my own column, yeah
Peepin' shit, I'm seein' niggas fall back
You bitch-ass niggas got me as the topic of the chat
You switched on me when you know you in business with a rat
And the boy that's like your brother, ain't nobody speak on that
The city see it clearly if I had to state a fact
You still fuck with a nigga that done got yo' partner 
Had these niggas talkin', only knew 'em 'cause of Slatt
These rap boys need more streams, heard he put my name on wax
You wouldn't even believe, I ain't had to watch my back
It's niggas really talkin', how you think we done got snatched?
Nobody sent the kite, I sent it wrong way, didn't get it back
This shit done got off track, let's get it back on track

Goin' all out when it's 'bout that bread and butter
They'll kill for clout, I put that on my dead brother, yeah
He talk so much, I showed him I'm a real hunter
Won't say it, but he know I still got real cutters, yeah
Yeah, I'm right back and I lost mad commas
I had been down bad inside a dark tunnel, yeah
Fuck them boys, I found out who my real partners
And who was only with me 'cause I had dollars, yeah

Fuck I pay the lawyers all them mills for?
Just so I won't have to say a word to dodge a railroad
Niggas find it hard to understand, though
Dog can't put me down, I been locked down, I don't know which way to go
Never gave no statement or agreed to take no stand on 'em
On whatever you niggas on, then trust me, I'ma stand on it
Lawyers and the DA did some sneaky shit, I fell for it
On my Ps and Qs because, this time, I be prepared for it, yeah
'Posed to shine, these niggas throwin' shade, though
I can get him hit, but I'ma just chill and just see how it go
What he say? He want some smoke with me, ain't in my time zone
Any given day, I could just pop out one of them side doors
Gunna, he too slick, you ain't gon' know which way I pled
Shit too hot, I can't even put no money in-
Pullin' up, pop out, like, "What the fuck you niggas said?"
Ain't with all that talkin', this the last time I'ma say it
Prolly think I'm sick, the way I keep poppin' these meds
I finally found out that's just the way the devil dance
Had too many niggas 'round I fed that bit my hand
I got too many folks to feed, you just don't understand, yeah

Goin' all out when it's 'bout that bread and butter
They'll kill for clout, I put that on my dead brother, yeah
He talk so much, I showed him I'm a real hunter
Won't say it, but he know I still got real cutters, yeah
Yeah, I'm right back and I lost mad commas
I had been down bad inside a dark tunnel, yeah
Fuck them boys, I found out who my real partners
And who was only with me 'cause I had dollars, yeah
