		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Look alive and come with me
You're to die for every day
Drag you out at midnight to dance in headlights
And making out in the rain
Look alive and come with me
You're to die for every day
When I think about you, the world got less blue
Let's do it over again

Look alive and come with me
You're to die for every day
Drag you out at midnight to dance in headlights
And making out in the rain
Look alive and come with me
You're to die for every day
When I think about you, the world got less blue
Let's do it over again

Look alive and come with me
Look alive and come with me

Look alive and come with me
You're to die for every day
Drag you out at midnight to dance in headlights
And making out in the rain
Look alive and come with me
You're to die for every day
When I think about you, the world got less blue
Let's do it over again

Look alive and come with me
You're to die for every day
Drag you out at midnight to dance in headlights
And making out in the rain
Look alive and come with me
You're to die for every day
When I think about you, the world got less blue
Let's do it over again

Look alive and come with me
Look alive and come with me
Look alive and come with me
Look alive and come with me
Look alive and come with me
