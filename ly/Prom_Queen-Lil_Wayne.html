		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah

I loved her fancy underwear, I sit behind her every year
Waiting for the chance to get
To tell her I'm the one she should be with
Oh, she's popular with all the guys
So innocent in my eyes
I can see her in my life
She woulda had the world if she were mine

But see, she had other plans I couldn't understand
Her and her stupid friends, Varsity's biggest fans
Never forget the day she laughed and walked away
And I couldn't stop her, I guess she had it all

She had it all figured out when she left me with a broken heart
Fucked around and turned me down
'Cause she didn't think I could play the part
But now the prom queen, the prom queen
Is crying sitting outside of my door
See you never know how
How everything could turn around

Yeah
They loved her fancy underwear, every boyfriend, every year
She tried to keep them entertained
When they can hardly remember her name, ah
She did everything she could
Just to make them laugh and treat her good
She finds herself alone
Asking herself where did she go wrong

She didn't realize she chased the type of guys
That don't believe in ties, trying to apologize
Never forget the day she left and walked away
And I couldn't stop her, I guess she had it all

She had it all figured out when she left me with a broken heart
Fucked around and turned me down
'Cause she didn't think I could play the part
But now the prom queen, the prom queen
Is crying sitting outside of my door
See you never know how
How everything could turn around

Yeah
Yeah (hey)
Uh, uh

Woo
She had it all figured out when she left me with a broken heart
Fucked around and turned me down
'Cause she didn't think I could play the part
But now the prom queen, the prom queen
Is crying sitting outside of my door
See you never know how
How everything can turn around
Woo
