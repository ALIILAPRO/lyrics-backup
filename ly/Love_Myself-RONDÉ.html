		  Whatever
I couldn't keep it together
Didn't know what I could be
Never thought that life could get much better
Thought I'd be here forever
Everything was breaking me
My life turned into therapy

Took a little while to see that I was lost, so lost
No I found myself, I'm never gonna stop

I'm ready to love myself
I'm ready to love myself
I'm ready to go
No, I don't, I don't need nobody else
I'm ready to love myself
I'm ready to love myself
I'm ready to go
No, I don't, I don't need nobody else

So lately
I've been keeping my head up
No one's gonna get me down
'Cause I just turned my life around
Go crazy, I don't need your love
So save it, 'cause I have enough
I'm ready, I'm ready

I'm ready to love myself
I'm ready to love myself
I'm ready to go
No, I don't, I don't need nobody else
I'm ready to love myself
I'm ready to love myself
I'm ready to go
No, I don't, I don't need nobody else

Pa-da-pa-pa-pa-da-da-pa
Pa-da-pa-pa-pa-da-da-pa
Pa-da-pa-pa-pa-da-da-pa
Pa-da-pa-pa-pa-da-da-pa

Took a little while to see that I was lost, so lost
Now I found myself, I'm never gonna stop

I'm ready to love myself
I'm ready to love myself
I'm ready to go
No, I don't, I don't need nobody else
I'm ready to love myself
I'm ready to love myself
I'm ready to go
No, I don't, I don't need nobody
No, I don't, I don't need nobody

Pa-da-pa-pa-pa-da-da-pa
Pa-da-pa-pa-pa-da-da-pa
Pa-da-pa-pa-pa-da-da-pa
Pa-da-pa-pa-pa-da-da-pa (I don't need nobody else)
Pa-da-pa-pa-pa-da-da-pa
Pa-da-pa-pa-pa-da-da-pa
Pa-da-pa-pa-pa-da-da-pa
Pa-da-pa-pa-pa-da-da-pa
