		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The grass stains my knees
An ugly green
A shade of envy just like she does
For i might never be your chrysanthemum
I'll hide in corners of your head
Like a dust bunny
That she'll sweep aside
Cause she doesn't know that
I'm important sometimes
I might not be a golden princess
But i'm alright
Just not for you and not tonight
You hide in the grass that stains you
Makes you wait
You take the bait he set
Wanting for something more
His lips on yours
I'm such a whorrible daydreamer
You hide in the grass that stains you
Makes you wait
You take the bait he set
Aching for something more
His lips on yours
I'm such a whorrible daydreamer
Your eyebrows flick and i feel sick
But you don't feel a thing
