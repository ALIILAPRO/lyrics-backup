		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One more chance to fall asleep
Inside this nightmare that's taking every part of me

If you scratch under the surface
Try to find a purpose
I wonder what the dead would find
Trapped inside the prison of my mind and I'm
Sick of messing up, up but forget it now
Every time I try to stop, stop I fall apart
Lost deep down, I'm searching for a glimpse of hope
I'm sick of messing up, up but forget it now

Believe in me
And set me free
I'll drag these memories through the dark void
Just let me be
My savior, please
Help me crawl out the darkness

If you're digging through the dirt 
To see what you can find inside
Trapped inside the prison of my mind and I'll
Try to live in the moment
Lost my mind, now I'm broken
Can't escape the darkness that's been dragging me down
Lost deep down, I'm searching for a glimpse of hope

Believe in me
And set me free
I'll drag these memories through the dark void
Just let me be
My savior, please
Give me hope for the hopeless
Through the dark void

One more chance to fall asleep
Inside this nightmare that's taking every part of me
One more chance to fall asleep
Inside this nightmare that's taking every part of me

One more chance
One more chance

One more chance to fall asleep
Inside this nightmare that's taking every part of me

One more chance to fall asleep
Inside this nightmare that's taking every part of me
One more chance to fall asleep
Inside this nightmare that's taking every part of me

Believe in me
And set me free
I'll drag these memories through the dark void

One more chance to fall asleep (just let me be)
Inside this nightmare that's taking every part of me (my savior, please)
One more chance to fall asleep
Inside this nightmare that's taking every part of me

Believe in me
And set me free
I'll drag these memories through the dark void
