		  (Madeline, Madeline?)
Madeline, let's go

All the girls and the gals and the boys and the lads
All the shots and the pints and the pills and the tabs
Take a walk, have a cig, give a kiss, get a cab
Big bill on my card now my dad's real mad

Let's roll
Madeline let's roll
Let's roll
Madeline let's roll

Now it's 9PM and Maddie's had too much to drink
And it smells in here, I think there's throw-up in the sink
And the boy in the corner thinks he'll pull me with a wink
But he looks like sixteen and I just really wanna dip
Girl, this house party sucks, can we call and Uber Lux
Let's not leave anyone behind (wait where's Maddie?)
"Aye, good evening" "Yeah what's up?"
"Can we hop on the AUX?"
I know the owner, we can skip the line (let's go)

All the girls and the gals and the boys and the lads
All the shots and the pints and the pills and the tabs
Take a walk, have a cig, give a kiss, get a cab
Big bill on my card now my dad's real mad

Let's roll
Madeline let's roll (Madeline)
Let's roll
Madeline let's roll

Uhm, let me tell you this story
Okay, so

Now it's 10PM, I'm really glad we left the pre
I pull my fake ID, "Yeah, I was born in '93"
And there's lines around the corner 'round the corner of the street
"Do you think we'd get in?"
I say, "Don't worry, you're with me"
But this bouncer's a bitch, thinks I look like a kid
Said he won't let me in tonight
Slipped a ten, he was pissed "Would you do it for a kiss?"
My friend says, "Girl, you're out of your mind"

All the girls and the gals and the boys and the lads
All the shots and the pints and the pills and the tabs
Take a walk, have a cig, give a kiss, get a cab
Big bill on my card now my dad's real mad

Let's roll (Madeline)
Madeline let's roll (Madeline, let's go)
Let's roll
Madeline let's roll

Now I'm at the bar and I'm feeling myself
I'm like finally this is a vibe and I have
Got like three margaritas I'm ready to go
Turn around I'm like, ugh where the heck is my friend?

Madeline gets lost anytime we toast
She's always a big liability
Madeline's talking to a guy
Dude, is that her ex? Are you kidding me?

He's a short, cheap, ugly creep
Maddie, it's just not that deep
Let's go
Madeline, let's roll

You're a hot, smart, gorgeous blonde
Such a waste of time, he's dumb
Let's go (Madeline)
Can we please go find

All the girls and the gals and the boys and the lads
All the shots and the pints and the pills and the tabs
Take a walk, have a cig, give a kiss, get a cab
Big bill on my card now my dad's real mad

All the girls and the gals and the boys and the lads
All the shots and the pints and the pills and the tabs
Take a walk, have a cig, give a kiss, get a cab
Big bill on my card now my dad's real mad

Let's roll
Madeline let's roll
Let's roll
Madeline let's roll

All the girls and the gals and the boys and the lads
All the shots and the pints and the pills and the tabs
Take a walk, have a cig, give a kiss, get a cab
Big bill on my card now my dad's real mad

Let's roll
Madeline let's roll (Madeline)
Let's roll
Madeline let's roll

All the girls and the gals and the boys and the lads
All the shots and the pints and the pills and the tabs
Take a walk, have a cig, give a kiss, get a cab
Big bill on my card now my dad's real mad

Let's roll (Madeline)
Madeline let's roll (Madeline, let's go)
Let's roll
Madeline let's roll
