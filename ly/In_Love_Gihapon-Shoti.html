		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's been like years
And I'm still waiting for you to text me
And I'm falling tears
Cause I know that I'll never be yours
Baby
If you think that this song's for you
Then we'll never know if you don't text me
You better do it now
Cause I'm thinking about you lately
Sige kog huna-huna
Pwede ba kitang duha
Diba in love kaayo
In love gihapon ko
Grabe kay ko ka suya
Na kay bag-ong ka sturya
I have one fear
That's the fear of getting rejected
And let's make it clear
Our friendship will probably get affected
And if you only feel the way I feel for you
You better tell me now
Cause baby
Loved you once
Yet, I love you still
Always have
And I always will
Always will
You've been running on my mind
And I just wanna spend my time
With you
Sige kog huna-huna
Pwede ba kitang duha
Diba in love kaayo
In love gihapon ko
Grabe kay ko ka suya
Na kay bag-ong ka sturya
It's been like years
And I'm still waiting for you to text me
And I'm falling tears
Cause I know that I'll never be yours
Baby
If you think that this song's for you
Then we'll never know if you don't text me
You better do it now
Cause I'm thinking about you lately
Sige kog huna-huna
Pwede ba kitang duha
Diba in love kaayo
In love gihapon ko
Grabe kay ko ka suya
Na kay bag-ong ka sturya
Sige kog huna-huna
Pwede ba kitang duha
Diba in love kaayo
In love gihapon ko
Grabe kay ko ka suya
Na kay bag-ong ka sturya
I'm
I'm in love
I'm in love
