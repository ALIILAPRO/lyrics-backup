		  Sittin' Throwin' Rocks
Sittin' Throwin' Rocks
Sittin' Throwin' Rocks
Im doing my best not to run away
Sittin' Throwin' Rocks
Sittin' Throwin'

Sittin' Throwing Rocks against the pavement hoping it will cave in and swallow me whole
Wondering why my mind keeps on spinning this isn't how living to me was told
Why am I like this, something's always a miss
Can't put my finger on it but its there
Wait for it to subside but my mind wont abide
Waiting for the clear

Is it bad sometimes I like it when I lose control
Its something in it that's so beautiful

Sittin' Throwin' Rocks
Sittin' Throwin' Rocks
Sittin' Throwin' Rocks
Sittin' Throwin' Rocks
Sittin' Throwin' Rocks
Sittin' Throwin' Rocks
Sittin' Throwin'
Listen I can see the light of day
Sittin' Throwin' Rocks
Sittin' Throwin' Rocks
But I can also see the bones decay
Sittin' Throwin' Rocks
Sittin' Throwin'
I don't know what else there is to say
Sittin' Throwin' Rocks
Sittin' Throwin' Rocks
Im doing my best not to run away
Sittin' Throwin' Rocks
Sittin' Throwin'

Sittin' Throwing Rocks against the pavement hoping it will cave in and swallow me whole
Wondering how the world keeps on spinning kinda scared of living when it unfolds
Hard to see the light when everything is silent, waiting for the clear
Thankful im alive but terrified of dying but hey im still here

Is it bad sometimes I like it when I lose control
Its something in it that's so beautiful

Listen I can see the light of day
Sittin' Throwin' Rocks
Sittin' Throwin' Rocks
But I can also see the bones decay
Sittin' Throwin' Rocks
Sittin' Throwin'
I don't know what else there is to say
Sittin' Throwin' Rocks
Sittin' Throwin' Rocks
Im doing my best not to run away
Sittin' Throwin' Rocks
Sittin' Throwin'

(Sittin' Throwin' Rocks
Sittin' Throwin'
Sittin' Throwin' Rocks
Sittin' Throwin'
Im doing my best not to run away
Sittin' Throwin' Rocks
Sittin' Throwin')
