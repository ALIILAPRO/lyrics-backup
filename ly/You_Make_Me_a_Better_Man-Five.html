		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's something bout your eyes 
That makes me search my soul 
They make me try to realize 
I'm trying to be a better man 

You got to know what's on my mind 
I will give you all my time 
Oh I feel for you baby, Yes I do 
All I want is you 

And when I search my soul I find 
A better place 
To be around 
I'm trying to tell you what's on my mind 
But will I make it through in time 

And when I search my soul I find 
You make me want to be yeah 
A better man 

I've never felt so in love 
The way I feel 
When you touch 
Although it doesn't sound that much 
All I have to do is look in your eyes 

You gotta know what's on my mind 
I will give you all my time 
I feel for you baby, yes I do 
All I want is you 

And when I search my soul I find 
A better place 
To be around 
I'm trying to tell you what's on my mind 
But will I make it through in time 

And when I search my soul I find 
A better place 
To be around 
I'm trying to tell you what's on my mind 
You make me want to be, yeah 
A better man 
Alright 

I want to take you higher 
I want to reach for the sky 
I want to show you fire 
I'll never tell you goodbye 
I'll never tell you goodbye 
You're on my mind 

And when I search my soul I find 
A better place 
To be around 
I'm trying to tell you what's on my mind 
But will I make it through in time 

And when I search my soul I find 
A better place 
To be around 
I'm trying to tell you what's on my mind 
You make me want to be, yeah 
A better man
