		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How far away is far enough for me to stay somewhere with you
Should we run away or stay right here in a place that we both hate

Girl you know I wanna give you the world but I just don't know how to do it
I wanna buy you all of the nice things but I just don't have money to do it

All I have is my love, my love, oh my love
All I have is my love, my love, oh my love, my love

I'm stupid sometimes I blow money fast I don't think when I make decisions
I like going fast 55 on that dash hopefully I'll make it back home someday

I'm tired of seeing you walk away into your house
Get our own place not here but far away

All I have is my love, my love, oh my love
All I have is my love, my love, oh my love, my love

I can't stand this feeling inside it's draining my life please come help me
You know you're my safe place when I'm locked away in a world that's full of darkness

I'm not cold in winter my sun is brightening through the hard snow
Like the waves keep crashing, my love for you will keep on going on

All I have is my love, my love, oh my love
All I have is my love, my love, oh my love, my love

And if you're ever alone just know that I'm home and I'm here when you need it
Who cares if I'm broke I know that we'll work in the end we won't be defeated
So love me right as I hold you tight as we dance underneath the full moon light
Don't let me go, I'm scared to know, please know that I love you so

All I have is my love, my love, oh my love
All I have is my love, my love, oh my love, my love

All my love
It's all I've ever have, my love, my love, my love
It's all I have
