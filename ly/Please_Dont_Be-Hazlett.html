		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Move like a typhoon 
I'm just a flame 
Smokey by nature 
Charmingly sane 
 
See golden empires 
Queens burning sage
Boys with their desires 
And hearts in a cage 

Please don't be
In love with someone else
Please don't be
In love with someone else

Bury the answers 
Burn all the proof
Fly by my feelings 
Land on your moon 
 
I'm going back home
To tell them the news
If all is so damn fair why does
Somebody always lose
 
Yes was the answer 
Love's not a game 
If you're a contestant 
He was the fame 
 
I found a new tone 
You left your sage
To hell with my desires
They were the cage
