		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, Its 50 cent, Young Buck
G-g-g-g-g-g-unit!
We get the club jumpin' from beginning to the end
Go shawty, we back up in this bitch again
We party, harder than you can imagine
You can run wit losers, or run wit winners and win

I feel attention when I walk in the club
G-unit to the socks, bitches all on a thug
Gimme a Henny on the rocks, and a bottle of bub
I don't need security, this Gorilla enough
I came to ball wit ya'll, pop the bar and all
So bitches call ya hoes, and niggas call ya dogs
If you love ya wife keep her at home tonight
She might never come home again nigga, aight!
Teeth, neck, wrists all lights my lifes like
Ridin' in Ca$hville runnin' all stop lights
Homie is that real, I pray I keep livin
My momma just had a dream of seein me in prison
My daddy's a dope fiend,and I don't really miss him
Ain't seen him in 10 years and a nigga still livin'
The same old 2 step we move to a rhythm
50 holla get em' Buck, you know I'm gonna get em'

I know you gonna let me shine and get mine
I know you gonna let me in with this nine
I know you gonna let me smoke on my weed
I know you gonna let me drink with no I.D
I know you gonna let me shine and get mine
I know you gonna let me in with this nine
I know you gonna let me smoke on my weed
I know you gonna let me drink with no I.D

I know I'm sinnin' but I'm winnin' at the same time
Took a couple shots from a nigga tryin' ta take mine
I'm back on the block, wit a choppa and a tech nine
Niggas shootin' cops and the hood runnin' stop signs
G-unit, The Game! Bitches doin' what the thugs do
G's, D's, Vice, Lords, Crips and the Bloods too
Move lemme come through 
It ain't a pair of handcuffs, can hold me
I'm ridin' in the ol' school listenin' to some oldies
My goals keep shinin', them hoes keep cryin'
The handle of my 45 outlined in diamonds
Just left Ca$hville, bout to fly to Miami
Hopin' Yayo watchin' Eminem, perform at the Grammys
Niggas like Eric Benet, prolly can't stand me, 'cause
I know money will make Halle Berry come out them panties
Bitch!

Ya'll niggas in trouble they should have never let me in (in)

I know you gonna let me shine and get mine
I know you gonna let me in with this nine
I know you gonna let me smoke on my weed
I know you gonna let me drink with no I.D
I know you gonna let me shine and get mine
I know you gonna let me in with this nine
I know you gonna let me smoke on my weed
I know you gonna let me drink with no I.D

Bet ya I can make them bounce back
Teach em' how to stunt, teach em' how to count stacks (yeah)
Now where ya hood at? Buck
If you want to, we 50 deep up in here what you gonna do
Who want beef, I ain't come for no name callin'
Don't be mad 'cause we is and you ain't ballin'
Gettin' money is my motto for you broke folks
Can't spend ya whole life payin' on ya car notes
It's alright if you still on the block boy
See I'mma cold young thug, not a hot boy
You know I do this for the streets, and my peeps that's behind bars
As soon as they come home, I'll go and buy them all cars
Young Buck!

I know you gonna let me shine and get mine
I know you gonna let me in with this nine
I know you gonna let me smoke on my weed
I know you gonna let me drink with no I.D
I know you gonna let me shine and get mine
I know you gonna let me in with this nine
I know you gonna let me smoke on my weed
I know you gonna let me drink with no I.D

We get the club jumpin' from beginning to the end
Go shawty, we back up in this bitch again
We party, harder than you can imagine
You can run wit losers, or run wit winners and win
Ah!
