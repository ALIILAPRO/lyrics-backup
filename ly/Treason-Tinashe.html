		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Drivin' with no headlights on
Runnin' every red light, yeah
Headed down a one-way the wrong way
Ain't nobody scared out here
I already know how it ends
I already feel those regrets
I don't even know when you snuck in
I just heard you come up the steps

If I'm bein' honest, I'm lyin'
If they see the truth, I'll deny it
I don't need no help on my end
Voices in my head goin' silent
Must be tragedy I desire
As I'm headed straight towards the fire
If I still got an angel on my side
I ain't tryna take no advice, I

Know it's dark, I seen it in the light
Know I couldn't fight it, but I tried
Hate myself for treason
I don't need a reason
I just wanna be with you tonight
Fuck it all, I'll put it on the line
Knew I couldn't fight it, but I tried
Hate myself for treason
I don't need a reason
I just wanna be with you tonight

It's detrimental to me, but I'd rather you here by my side
I'd rather you spend the night
Don't even got a key, but you would still find your way back inside
Still find your way

Lovin' you is suicidal
So unhealthy, where my mind go?
Guess I needed the reminder
Saw you clearly, but I'm blinded (oh)
Scary movie, I rewind it
Runnin' back a hundred times
Delete the footage 'fore they find it
Wouldn't wanna leak it online, I

Know it's dark, I seen it in the light
Know I couldn't fight it, but I tried
Hate myself for treason
I don't need a reason
I just wanna be with you tonight, oh

Yeah-yeah-yeah
I don't need a reason, oh
Yeah-yeah-yeah
