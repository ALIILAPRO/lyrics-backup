		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it now
Say it, say it, say it, say it, say it, say it, say it now

Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it now
Say it, say it, say it, say it, say it, say it, say it now

Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it now

Instead of carving up the wall
Why don't you open up me tall
I am ready, I am ready for a fall

Instead of carving up the wall
Why don't you open up me tall
We are ready, we are ready for the floor

I can't hear your voice, do I have a choice?
I'm hoping with chance, you might take this dance
I can't hear your voice, do I have a choice?
(You're sinking below, I'm using my force)
I'm hoping with chance, you might take this dance
You're my number one guy

Instead of carving up the wall
Why don't you open up me tall
I am ready, I am ready for a fall

Instead of carving up the wall
Why don't you open up me tall
We are ready, we are ready for the floor

I can't hear your voice, do I have a choice?
(You're sinking below, I'm using my force)
I'm hoping with chance, you might take this dance
You're my number one guy
Number one guy
Number, number, number, number, number,
One, one, one, one, one guy

(Number one guy) Stand carving up the wall
(One, one guy) Why don't you open up at all?
(Number, number, number one)I am ready, I am ready for a fall

(Number one, number one) Stand carving up the wall
(Number one, one, one) Why don't you open up at all?
(Guy, guy) We are ready, we are ready for the floor

(Number one guy) Stand carving up the wall
(Number, number, one, one) Why don't you open up at all?
(Guy) I am ready, I am ready for a fall

(You're my number one guy, number one) Stand carving up the wall
(Number, number, one, one) Why don't you open up at all?
(Number, number, one, one) We are ready for the floor
