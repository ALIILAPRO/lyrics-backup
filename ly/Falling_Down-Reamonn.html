		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Two times today I had to call you up to let you down
Don't want to let you down
Two times today I ran out of luck and I let you down
Don't want to let you down

'Cause I fall down when you're not around
Yeah I fall down when you're not around
Two times today I messed up and let you down
Don't want to let you down

Thought I heard you say I nearly lost your love
'Cause I let you down
Don't want to let you down
'Cause I fall down when you're not around

Yeah I fall down when you're not around
I fell down two times today
I fell down two times today
Yeah I fall down when you're not around

Yeah I fall down when you're not around
I feel I'm falling down, take a look at me can you see me fall
I'm falling down, can't you see me falling down
Can't you see me fall,

Can't you see me falling down
Can't you see me falling down
I feel I'm falling down
I feel I'm falling down

Take a look at me I'm falling down please don't let me fall.
