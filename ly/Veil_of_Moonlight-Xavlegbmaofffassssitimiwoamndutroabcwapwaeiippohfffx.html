		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  On a frosty winter’s night, a man screams out in agony
Mortally wounded he bleeds out upon the forest floor
As he takes his final breath the trees begin to sway and whisper
A figure looms over him and brings his corpse to life
What have you done unto me? My conscience is here but my hearts not beating?
The figure removes its cloak to reveal a woman of immense beauty

Risen from the dead to serve me
Risen from the dead as a sacrifice
Where are you taking me?
To my lair at the edge of the swamp
What are your plans with me?
Oh my love, you'll soon find out
I will not allow this
I'm afraid you have no choice
Witch I'll have your head
I'd like to see you try
The figure then to him back to her lair where she lay him down upon the muddy floor
And drew a circle round him whilst she chanted in Latin
Corpus meam ad praefinitum tempus I am habiti et mortuus est

The wind begins to howl
The trees speak of death and evil
Sulphur engulfs the air
As a swamp boils over
Smoke and toxic fumes fill the lungs
This once dead soldier a hollow corpse

Risen from the dead to serve me
Risen from the dead as a sacrifice
This Hollow Corpse
Will harbour his soul
No
Come forth my love
I long for your touch

Can you hear me, my love?
Please open your eyes I've done this all for you

Do my eyes play tricks upon me or is that you my love that I see?
Say it ain't so
I thought I'd never speak to you again but here you are my love
Nothing can tear us apart
Love eternal
My heart forever yours
Take my hand let us dance again beneath the pale stars
My love for you is eternal and I won't let you go until it’s done
A Waltz with the wicked
They danced hand in hand
And disappeared into the forest
