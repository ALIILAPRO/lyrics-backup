		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do we build all our walls up just to burn them down?
Are we trapped in a fire that we built ourselves?
When all the pain is pushed away
We hide behind our eyes
No wonder that we're barely getting by

Caught in a wildfire
We keep running away
No one's saving the day
Wildfire
We keep waiting for rain
We've got only ourselves to blame
(Only ourselves to blame)
(Only ourselves to blame)

Does it all seem to follow
Like a beautiful sound
We're surrounded with sirens
So lost and not found

So
We'll never be enough, no, no
We'll never be enough

Wildfire
We keep running away
No one's saving the day
Wildfire
We keep waiting for rain
We've got only ourselves to blame

We keep hoping and praying
But there's nothing to save
There is no going back
If we don't change our ways

We keep hoping and praying
But there's nothing to save
There is no going back
If we don't change our ways

Wildfire
We keep running away
But no one's saving the day

Wildfire
We keep waiting for rain
We've got only ourselves to blame

We keep hoping and praying
But there's nothing to save
There is no going back
If we don't change our ways

Wildfire
We keep running away
We've got only ourselves to blame
