		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Touch, touch
I remember touch
Touch, touch
I remember touch
Where do I belong?
Touch, I need something more
I remember touch
I need something more in my mind

Touch, I remember touch
Pictures came with touch
A painter in my mind
Tell me what you see
A tourist in a dream
A visitor, it seems
A half-forgotten song
Where do I belong?
Tell me what you see
I need something more

Kiss, suddenly alive
Happiness arrive
Hunger like a storm
How do I begin?
A room within a room
A door behind a door
Touch, where do you lead?
I need something more
Tell me what you see
I need something more

Home, hold on
If love is the answer
You're home, hold on
If love is the answer
You're home, hold on
If love is the answer
You're home, hold on
If love is the answer
You're home, hold on
If love is the answer
You're home, hold on
If love is the answer
You're home, hold on
If love is the answer
You're home, hold on
If love is the answer, you're

You're home, hold on
If love is the answer
You're home, hold on
If love is the answer
You're home, hold on
If love is the answer
You're home, hold on
If love is the answer
You're home, hold on
If love is the answer
You're home, hold on
If love is the answer
You're home, hold on
If love is the answer
You're home, hold on
If love is the answer, you're

Touch, sweet touch
You've given me too much to feel
Sweet touch
You've almost convinced me I'm real
I need something more
I need something more
