		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
South Memphis' finest, nigga
Yeah
Uh, uh

South Memphis nigga, ballin', I get every penny (yeah)
Twenty pointers in my mouth, ayy, shoutout to my dentist (yeah)
I just did a meet-and-greet and signed a couple titties (titties)
If a nigga play with Key, yeah, it's gon' be a killin' (bah)
Hit that lil' bitch from the back, yeah, I drilled it (drill it)
I just bought a plain watch, but it cost a Bentley (Bentley)
I'm just gettin' money, tell 'em get up out they feelings (feelings)
Just turned a deal down, what the fuck is ten milli'? (The fuck?)

Huh, nigga? Tryna get a billi' (yeah)
Prada overalls on, look like a hillbilly (yeah)
Prada overalls on, yeah, baby, this shit different
Snub-nose revolver, shoot that bitch like Scottie Pippen
Ten toes down, it ain't no switchin', nigga play, get hit with switches
Voices in my head keep on sayin', "Boy, let's get it"
So you know I'ma go get it, I got that 4-0 in my britches (yeah)
Niggas playin', niggas scared, they ain't tryna get it (the fuck?)
These niggas cuffin' hoes
These niggas fucked up, these niggas breakin' codes
I'm from Memphis, I can show you how to break a ho (yeah)
I'm from Memphis, I can show you how to break a ho (yeah)
Bitch, I'm that nigga, I bought a chain so they can hate some more

Ballin', I get every penny (yeah)
Twenty pointers in my mouth, ayy, shoutout to my dentist (yeah)
I just did a meet-and-greet and signed a couple titties (titties)
If a nigga play with Key, yeah, it's gon' be a killin' (bah)
Hit that lil' bitch from the back, yeah, I drilled it (drill it)
I just bought a plain watch, but it cost a Bentley (Bentley)
I'm just gettin' money, tell 'em get up out they feelings (feelings)
Just turned a deal down, what the fuck is ten milli'? (The fuck?)

Yeah, nigga, I'm tryna get a billi' (yeah, yeah)
Nigga, tryna get a billi' (yeah, yeah, what you tryna get?)
Tryna get a billi' (yeah, yeah)
I just turned a deal down, what the fuck is ten milli'? (The fuck?)
