		  Brenda's (Brenda's)
Got a (got a)
Baby
Say that one more time Brenda
Brenda's
Got a (baby)
Baby

I hear Brenda's got a baby
But Brenda's barely got a brain
A damn shame, the girl can hardly spell her name
(That's not our problem, that's up to Brenda's family)
Well, let me show ya how it affects our whole community
Now Brenda really never knew her moms and her dad was a
Junky, puttin' death to his arms, it's sad 'cause I bet
Brenda doesn't even know
Just 'cause you're in the ghetto doesn't mean you can't grow (you can't grow)
But oh, that's a thought, my own revelation
Do whatever it takes to resist the temptation
Brenda got herself a boyfriend
Her boyfriend was her cousin, now let's watch the joy end
She tried to hide her pregnancy, from her family
Who didn't really care to see, or give a damn if she
Went out and had a church of kids
As long as when the check came they got first dibs
Now Brenda's belly is gettin' bigger
But no one seems to notice any change in her figure
She's 12 years old and she's having a baby
In love with the molester, who's sexing her crazy
And yet and also she thinks that he'll be with her forever
And dreams of a world with the two of them are together
Whatever, he left her and she had the baby solo
She had it on the bathroom floor and didn't know so
She didn't know, what to throw away and what to keep
She wrapped the baby up and threw him in the trash heep
I guess she thought she'd get away, wouldn't hear the cries
She didn't realize
How much the the little baby had her eyes
Now the baby's in the trash heep balling
Momma can't help her, but it hurts to hear her calling
Brenda wants to run away
Momma say, "you makin' me lose pay
And social workers here everyday"
Now Brenda's gotta make her own way
Can't go to her family, they won't let her stay
No money, no babysitter, she couldn't keep a job
She tried to sell crack, but end up getting robbed
So now what's next, there ain't nothing left to sell
So she sees sex as a way of leaving hell
It's paying the rent, so she really can't complain
Prostitute, found slain, and Brenda's her name, she's got a baby

Baby

(Don't you know she's got a) (ooh)
(Don't you know she's got a) (hoo)
(Don't you know she's got a baby) (ohh ahh)

She's had a baby
(Don't you know she's got a) (yes, she had)
(Don't you know she's got a) (yes, she)
(Don't you know she's got a baby) (she's had a baby)

(Don't you know she's got a) (I know, I know)
(Don't you know she's got a) (I, I, I know)
(Don't you know she's got a baby) (I, I, I, know) 

I know, know know, know, know, know, know, know
(Don't you know she's got a) (know, know, know, know)
(Don't you know she's got a) (I know, I know)
(Don't you know she's got a baby) (so all alone with a baby)

(Don't you know she's got a) (she's got no food to eat)
(Don't you know she's got a) (no bed to sleep)
(Don't you know she's got a baby) (no money to put shoes on her baby's feet, yeah)

(Don't you know she's got a) (ooh)
(Don't you know she's got a) (ooh)
(Don't you know she's got a baby) (ooh)
