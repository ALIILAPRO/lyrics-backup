		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A buh-buh buh buh-buh
A buh-buh buh buh-buh

You went to school to learn, girl
Things you never, never knew before
Like I before E except after C
And why two plus two makes four
Now, now, now, I'm gonna teach you
Teach you, teach you
All about love, dear
All about love
Sit yourself down, take a seat
All you gotta do is repeat after me

ABC
Easy as
One, two, three
Or simple as
Do re mi
ABC, one, two, three, baby, you and me girl
ABC
Easy as
One, two, three
Or simple as
Do re mi
ABC, one, two, three, baby, you and me

Come on, let me love you just a little bit
Come on, let me love you just a little bit
I'm a going to teach how to sing it out
Come on, come on, come on
Let me show you what it's all about

Reading, writing and arithmetic
Are the branches of the learning tree
But without the roots of love every day, girl
Your education ain't complete
T-T-T-Teacher's gonna show you
Show you, show you
How to get an A
Nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah
Spell "me" "you"
Add the two
Listen to me baby, that's all you gotta do

Oh, ABC
As easy as
One, two, three
Or simple as
Do re mi
ABC, one, two, three, baby, you and me girl
ABC
It's easy
It's like counting up to three (One, two, three)
Sing a simple melody (Do re mi, ABC)
That's how easy love can be

Sit down, girl
I think I love you
No
Get up, girl
Show me what you can do

Shake it, shake it, baby, come on now
Shake it, shake it, baby, ooh ooh
Shake it shake it, baby, huh
One, two, three, baby, ooh ooh
ABC, baby, nah nah
Do re mi, baby, huh
That's how easy love can be

ABC, it's easy
It's like counting up to three (One, two, three)
Sing a simple melody (Do re mi, ABC)
That's how easy love can be
(I'm not gonna teach you how to sing it out)
Come on come on come on let me show you what it's all about
ABC, it's easy
It's like counting up to three (One, two, three)
Sing a simple melody (Do re mi, ABC)
That's how easy love can be
(I'm not gonna teach you how to sing it out)
Sing it out, sing it, sing it, sing it
Oh baby, ABC, it's easy
It's like counting up to three (One, two, three)
Sing a simple melody (Do re mi, ABC)
That's how easy love can be
