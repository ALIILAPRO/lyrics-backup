		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Gun Fingers if you're a real raver
Gun Fingers if you're a real raver

I've got the flavor
Go to the bar, get a rum no chaser
'Cause me and my dumt make paper
If I see your wifey I might take her
If I see your wifey I might date her
You're not big rude boy, you're a lamer
Middle finger to a hater
Gun Fingers if you're a real raver

Gun Fingers if you're a real raver
Gun Fingers if you're a real raver
Gun Fingers if you're a real raver

I've got the flavor
Go to the bar, get a rum no chaser
'Cause me and my dumt make paper
If I see your wifey I might take her
If I see your wifey I might date her
You're not big rude boy, you're a lamer
Middle finger to a hater
Gun Fingers if you're a real raver

Gun Fingers if you're a real raver
Gun Fingers if you're a real raver

Gun Fingers if you're a real raver
Gun Fingers if you're a real raver
Gun Fingers if you're a real raver

I've got the flavor
Go to the bar, get a rum no chaser
'Cause me and my dumt make paper
If I see your wifey I might take her
If I see your wifey I might date her
You're not big rude boy, you're a lamer
Middle finger to a hater
Gun Fingers if you're a real raver

Gun Fingers if you're a real raver
Gun Fingers if you're a real raver
Gun Fingers if you're a real raver
Gun Fingers if you're a real raver
Gun Fingers if you're a real raver
