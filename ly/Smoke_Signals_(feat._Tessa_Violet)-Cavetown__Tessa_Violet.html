		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know I'm a freak
Ripped the Band-Aid, broke the peace
Took the lock but lost the key
Guess I set you free
I hope you found a place to sleep
I know you're bound to think of me

You can come home to me when you're ready
I left the gate unlocked for you
'Til then I'm sending out smoke signals
Hoping I'll see yours too (Ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh)

When the dust has set
Settled up and done our debts
Nothing left to go collect
If you're feeling spent
When it's heavy on your chest
When you think there's nothing left

You can come home to me when you're ready
I left the gate unlocked for you
'Til then I'm sending out smoke signals
Hoping I'll see yours too
(I miss you, I miss you)
(I miss you, I miss you)
(I miss you, I miss you)
(I miss you, I miss you)
(I miss you, I miss you)
(I miss you, I miss you)
(I miss you, I miss you)
