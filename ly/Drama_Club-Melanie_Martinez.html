		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everyone's so soft, everyone's so sensitive
Do I offend you? You're hanging on my sentences
You can keep your costume and you can keep your mask
I'ma take a bow so you can kiss my ass

I never signed up for your drama
Up for your drama, up for your drama club
I never signed up for your drama
Up for your drama club

They try to feed you lines that you have to memorize
You always hide behind your Wizard of Oz disguise
Do you even have a brain? You're sticking to a page
You're faking all your pain, yeah, you're bleeding on a stage

I never signed up for your drama
Up for your drama, up for your drama club
I never signed up for your drama
Up for your drama club (ooh)

I never signed up for your drama club (ooh)
For your drama club
I never signed up for your drama (ooh)
Up for your drama, up for your drama club
Never signed up for your drama (ooh)
Up for your drama, up for your drama club

I don't wanna be an actress, living by a script
Who cares about practicing? I don't give a shit
You're over-analyzing every word I say
There's a whole world out there, you're living a play
Fuck your auditorium, I think it's pretty boring and

I never signed up for your drama
Up for your drama, up for your drama club
I never signed up for your drama
Up for your drama club (ooh)

I never signed up for your drama club (ooh)
For your drama club
I never signed up for your drama (ooh)
Up for your drama, up for your drama club
Never signed up for your drama (ooh)
Up for your drama, up for your drama club

For your drama club
Mmh, mmh
Mmh, mmh

I never signed up (ooh), mmh, mmh
I never signed up (ooh), never signed up
Never signed up for your drama club
I never signed up for your drama (ooh), for your drama
For your drama club
I never signed up for your drama (ooh)
Up for you drama, for your drama club

I never signed up for your drama (ooh)
Up for your drama, up for your drama club
I never signed up for your drama (ooh)
Up for your drama, up for your drama club
I never signed up for your drama (ooh)
Up for your drama, up for your drama club
I never signed up for your drama (ooh)
Up for your drama, up for your drama club
