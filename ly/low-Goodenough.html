		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I ain’t really know
But I don’t wanna be here
I ain’t wanna feel
But everything seems so real

Ever since you’re gone
Everything’s blurry
I’m a bit obsessed
Kinda feel so stressed
Caught me in depressed
I’m a bit mess

I don’t know what we are,
But i miss what we were
I’d give my soul
Just to bring me back to you.

But, All I want is upside down
All I ever want is upside down
No more pills, no overdose
Cause everybody gets high, everybody gets low.

I’ve wasted so much chances
I’m loner-like in places
I’d face all the consequences
All night along, I’m restless.

I don’t know what we are,
But I miss what we were
I’d give my soul
Just to bring me back to you.

But, All I want is upside down
All I ever want is upside down
No more pills, no overdose
Cause everybody gets high, everybody gets low.

Everybody gets high
Everybody gets low

But, All I want is upside down
All I ever want is upside down
No more pills, no overdose
Cause everybody gets high, everybody gets low.

But, All I want is upside down
All I ever want is upside down
No more pills, no overdose
Cause everybody gets high, everybody gets low.

I don’t know what we are,
But I miss what we were..
