		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Were we larks in the garden
Were we all just open mouths
Were coyotes on the front porch
Did they smile with Paper Teeth
And who are we
Barn loft
Burning
Old stars
Falling
Ashes light
Cold nights
Lark flys
From lost sights
Have lilacs frozen over
Have all the trees outgrown her
Were we clean when the morning came
Cause darling the sunrise has gone slower
Barn loft
Burning
Old stars
Falling
Ashes light
Cold nights
Lark flys
From lost sights
Barn loft
Burning
Old stars
Falling
Darker lines
To face of white
Go stand up right
No lies to hide
