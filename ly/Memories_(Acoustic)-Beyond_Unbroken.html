		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In this moment
I wait forever
The memory of us is in the dark
The world feels empty
I need you with me
This memory has never felt so cold
(Never felt so cold)

Can you feel me waiting alone in the dark
Won't forget the memories, keep you in my heart
I am lost without you, I'm feeling torn apart
Hold on to the memories, So I won't be there
Waiting in the dark
(Waiting in the dark)

The shadows mislead, the dreams are haunting
I'm rushing toward the memory of us
My eyes are red and the nights are endless
This memory of us never felt so cold

Can you feel me waiting alone in the dark
Won't forget the memories, keep you in my heart
I am lost without you, I'm feeling torn apart
Hold on to the memories, So I won't be there
Waiting in the dark

If I had one wish
You'd be here with me
To forget all the pain that's haunting me
It's haunting me
Haunting me
