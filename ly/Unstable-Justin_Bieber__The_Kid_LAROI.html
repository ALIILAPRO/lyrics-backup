		  Oh-oh-oh-oh
Unstable

Sometimes I think I overthink (think I)
And I start to feel anxiety (anxi')
There were times I couldn't even breathe (mmm)
But you never once abandoned me (no, you never, oh)

I tried to scare you
Scare you away
Showed you the door
You adored me anyway
When I was broken in pieces
You were my peace of mind
You were my peace of mind

Yeah, you loved, yeah, you loved, yeah, you loved me
When I was unstable
Never judged, never judged, never judged me
When I was unable
To love myself, to trust myself
Yeah, you loved, yeah, you loved, yeah, you loved me
When I was unstable

White knuckles, tryna hold my sanity (hold my)
Not every wound is the kind that bleeds, uh, uh
Never know when my mind's gonna turn on me (never know)
But you're the one I call for security (oh, baby)
These memories have been toxic (oh)
I tried to wean and get off it (oh)
Through everything, you been my rock
I think you're the only thing I didn't get wrong
How I know God was listening
Every night when I would pray
You're an angel watching over me (oh)
All I need

I tried to scare you
Scare you away
Showed you the door
You adored me anyway
When I was broken in pieces
You were my peace of mind
You were my peace of mind

Yeah, you loved, yeah, you loved, yeah, you loved me
When I was unstable
Never judged, never judged, never judged me
When I was unable
To love myself, to trust myself
Yeah, you loved, yeah, you loved, yeah, you loved me
When I was unstable
