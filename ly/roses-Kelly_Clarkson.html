		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Your hand, I held it and I felt it slippin' over time
But some things, you just can't hide
Your eyes still point in my direction, but they lost the light
I don't know, I don't mind (I don't mind)

But last week, I would've caved
Felt like the rain for all the stops she pullin'
Time is funny that way, kills me to say

It's too late for roses, they'll die in a day
You can't put a band-aid on the way that we're breakin'
It's too late for diamonds, they all come with chains
So don't waste your money on it, we can't be saved
There ain't enough roses, no

I might regret it once I let it sink in overnight
But right now, it's black and white (black and white)
I was so patient, chances wasted, had to draw a line
And you crossed it every time (every time)

And last week, I would've caved
But even the rain can't wash away our problems
Time is funny that way, kills me to say

It's too late for roses, they'll die in a day
You can't put a band-aid on the way that we're breakin'
It's too late for diamonds, they all come with chains
So don't waste your money on it, we can't be saved
There ain't enough roses (ain't enough, ain't enough, ain't enough)
No 
No, there ain't enough roses (ain't enough, ain't enough, ain't enough)
No 

And every day, I miss you less
How does love feel 'til there's nothing even left
Like your flowers, we dried up
I don't like your kind of love
There's nothing left to say
Keep your words, you never mean them anyway
Every day, I miss you less
'Til one day there's nothing left

It's too late for roses, they'll die in a day
You can't put a band-aid on the way that we're breakin'
It's too late for diamonds, they all come with chains
So don't waste your money on it, we can't be saved (we can't be saved)
There ain't enough roses
Ain't enough, ain't enough, ain't enough, ain't enough
No, there ain't enough roses, no
Ain't enough, ain't enough, ain't enough, ain't enough
There ain't enough roses
No, there ain't enough, ain't enough, ain't enough, ain't enough, no
There ain't enough roses
Ain't enough, ain't enough, ain't enough, ain't enough, no (there ain't enough)

There ain't enough roses
Ain't enough (no), ain't enough
Ain't enough
