		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Nemesis, my dearly neurotic
Enemies, though our face is the same
Your greedy hands held my happiness hostage
I will carry you to the grave

Nemesis, this time I'll finish it
Break me down, over and over
Blood for blood, I'll cut you out with
The knife you cowardly left in my back

Never again
I'd rather die than keep you alive

Do you believe in me now?
Laugh as I lower you down
No funeral, no condolences
You shot our plot full of holes
And nailed our twin casket closed
I found my life in your cause of death

I know that you hate me but need my protection
An awful reflection of what's taken place
Born out of trauma, and lost in the drama
I've been here the whole time to keep you safe

You can try, you know that you need me
Enemies, though we're one in the same
Killed you off in the name of survival
But I am not to blame

Do you believe in me now?
Laugh as you lower me down
No funeral, no condolences
(So say goodbye)
I shot our plot full of holes
And nailed our twin casket closed
You found your life in my cause of death
Enmeshed in our design
Judgements collide

A cruel invention, despite good intentions
The damage has been done
Liar
Two-faced
A cruel invention, despite good intentions, can we be forgiven?

Is it too late for us now?
Could history be rewound?
Is there no chance to make amends?
And as this story unfolds
My book began where yours closed
A sign of life in your cause of death
I was your cause of death

No hope, no time
Can't go back, can't rewind
I still belong to you
I still belong to you
No hope, no time
Can't go back, can't rewind
You still belong to me
You were my sign of life and I was your cause of death
I was your cause of death
I was your cause of death
