		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We can make this dream
a reality
Together we can make
a brand new day
If we just believe that
we can fly
Someday (Someday)
we can touch the sky
I'm always with you

I've been looking for someone
to be there
When life is so unfair
and hard to breathe
You always stand by my side
and hold my hand
Your smile is the only light
until we see the sun
Starting over like
we've just begun
There are so many ways to do
it right
Turn around and see what
we've left behind
It's never ever too late
We can make a better tomorrow
We can paint it with any color
we want
If we keep holding on we'll
work it out
Someday (Someday)
we can touch the sky
I'm always with you

I've been searching for
something special
I spent too much time
traveling around
Now I know all I need is
someone like you
Everyday you make me happy
with every word you say
Sit down and let me draw
your smile
You look beautiful in colors
so bright
Your brown eyes
make my heart beats fast
I've never felt this way before
We can make this dream
a reality
Together we can make
a brand new day
If we just believe that
we can fly
Someday (Someday)
we can touch the sky
I'm always with you
Forget your tears of past
Do not regret, do not chase
Raise your head up high
Cause stars are shining bright
There is nothing like you
and I together
We can make a better tomorrow
We can paint it with any color
we want
If we keep holding on we'll
work it out
Someday (Someday)
we can touch the sky
I'm always with you
We can make this dream
a reality
Together we can make
a brand new day
If we just believe that
we can fly
Someday (Someday)
we can touch the sky
I'm always with you
I belong to you,
you belong to me
Together there is nothing
we can't do
If we keep holding on we'll
work it out
Someday (Someday)
we can touch the sky
I'm always with you
