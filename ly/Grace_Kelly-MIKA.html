		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wanna talk to you

The last time we talked, Mr. Smith
You reduced me to tears
I promise you, it won't happen again

Do I attract you?
Do I repulse you with my queasy smile?
Am I too dirty?
Am I too flirty?
Do I like what you like?

I could be wholesome
I could be loathsome
I guess I'm a little bit shy
Why don't you like me?
Why don't you like me without making me try?

I try to be like Grace Kelly (mmh)
But all her looks were too sad (ahh)
So I tried a little Freddie (mmh)
I've gone identity mad

I could be brown
I could be blue
I could be violet sky
I could be hurtful
I could be purple
I could be anything you like
Gotta be green
Gotta be mean
Gotta be everything more
Why don't you like me?
Why don't you like me?
Why don't you walk out the door

(Getting angry doesn't solve anything)

How can I help it?
How can I help it?
How can I help what you think?
Hello, my baby
Hello, my baby
Putting my life on my brink
Why don't you like me?
Why don't you like me?
Why don't you like yourself?
Should I bend over?
Should I look older just to be put on your shelf?

I try to be like Grace Kelly (mmh)
But all her looks were too sad (ahh)
So I tried a little Freddie (mmh)
I've gone identity mad

I could be brown
I could be blue
I could be violet sky
I could be hurtful
I could be purple
I could be anything you like
Gotta be green
Gotta be mean
Gotta be everything more
Why don't you like me?
Why don't you like me?
Walk out the door

Say what you want to satisfy yourself, hey
But you only want what everybody else says you should want
You want

I could be brown
I could be blue
I could be violet sky
I could be hurtful
I could be purple
I could be anything you like
Gotta be green
Gotta be mean
Gotta be everything more
Why don't you like me?
Why don't you like me?
Walk out the door

I could be brown
I could be blue
I could be violet sky
I could be hurtful
I could be purple
I could be anything you like
Gotta be green
Gotta be mean
Gotta be everything more
Why don't you like me?
Why don't you like me?
Walk out the door, ooh

Humphrey, we're leaving

Ka-ching
