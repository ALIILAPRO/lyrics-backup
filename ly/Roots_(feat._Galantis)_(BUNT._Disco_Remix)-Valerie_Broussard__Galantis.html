		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I been known for one thing
I come and then I go
I got used to wandering
Living on the road

All the times I'd love and leave
But you got a hold on me
How'd the days turn into weeks?
You and this town are growing on me

We could put some roots down
All I want is you now
You know I'm done, you know I'm done running
I'm just thinking out loud
Trying out a new sound
You and I got, you and I got something
Oh, I'm finally home
Built from this rolling stone
We could put some roots down
All I want is you now
You and I got, you and I got something

We could put some roots down
Put some roots down
We could put some roots down
Roots down, roots down (roots down)
You and I got, you and I got something
We could put some roots down

I know you for one thing
You'd never let me go
You shine like a beacon
Guiding me back home, home, ho- ho-home

All the times I'd love and leave
But you got a hold on me (hold on me, hold on me)
How'd the days turn into weeks?
You and this town are growing on me

We could put some roots down
All I want is you now
You know I'm done, you know I'm done running
I'm just thinking out loud
Trying out a new sound
You and I got, you and I got something
Oh, I'm finally home
Built from this rolling stone
We could put some roots down
All I want is you now
You and I got, you and I got something

We could put some roots down
Put some roots down
We could put some roots down
You and I got, you and I got something
We could put some roots down
Put some roots down
We could put some roots down
Roots down, roots down (roots down)
You and I got, you and I got something
We could put some roots down
