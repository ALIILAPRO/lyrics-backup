		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't even know myself at all
I thought I would be happy by now
The more I try to push it I realize gonna let go of control

Gotta let it happen, gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen, just let it happen

It's just a spark but it's enough to keep me going
And when it's dark out and no one's around it keeps glowing

Every night I try my best to dream tomorrow makes it better
And wake up to the cold reality and not a thing is changed
But it would be happen, gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen, gotta let it happen

It's just a spark but it's enough to keep me going
And when it's dark out and no one's around it keeps glowing
It's just a spark but it's enough to keep me going
And when it's dark out and no one's around it keeps glowing

And the salt in my wounds isn't burning anymore than it used to
It's not that I don't feel the pain it's just I'm not afraid of hurting anymore
And the blood of these veins isn't pumping any less than it ever has
And that's the hope I have the only thing I know that's keeping me alive
Alive

Gotta let it happen, gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen, gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen, gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen, gotta let it happen

It's just a spark but it's enough to keep me going
And when it's dark out and no one's around it keeps glowing
It's just a spark but it's enough to keep me going
And when it's dark out and no one's around it keeps glowing
