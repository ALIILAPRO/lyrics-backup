		<p>
		  So what are you doing back?
Well, I sat back and thought about the things we used to do
It really meant a lot to me, you mean a lot to me
I really mean that much to you?
Girl, you know it's true

I'm in love with you girl 'cause you're on my mind
You're the one I think about most every time
And when you pack a smile in everything you do
Don't you understand, girl, this love is true

You're soft, succulent so sweet and thin
That's kind of like a vision upon your skin
It lightens up my day, and that's oh so true
Together we're one separated we're two

To make you all mine, all mine is my desire
'Cause you contain a quality, you that I admire
You're pretty plain and simple, you rule my world so try to understand

I'm in love girl 
I'm in so love girl 
I'm just in love girl
And this is true

Girl, you know it's true 
Ooh, ooh, ooh I love you
Yes, you know it's true ooh 
Ooh, ooh I love you

Girl, you know it's true my love is for you
Girl, you know it's true my love is for you

This is some sort of thing, girl, I can't explain
My emotions starts up when I hear your name
Maybe your sweet sweet voice which ring in my ear
And stimulate my senses when you are near

Come with your positive emotion, love, making enjoyin'
That's for me to bust it's like a girl and a boy
These feelings I get I often wonder why
So I thought I might discuss this, girl, just you and I

Now what you wear, I don't care, how you dressed before
The reason that I like you, girl, just for what you are
If I sit and think about it, you rule my world so try to understand

I'm in love girl
I'm in so love girl
I'm just in love girl
And this is true

Girl, you know it's true 
Ooh, ooh, ooh I love you
Yes, you know it's true 
Ooh, ooh, ooh I love you

Girl, you know it's true, my love is for you

I'm in love with you girl
I'm in love with you girl (girl, girl, girl, girl)
I'm in love with you 
I'm in love with you
I'm in love with you

Girl, you know it's true my love is for you
Girl, you know it's true
Ooh, ooh, ooh I love you
Yes, you know it's true
Ooh, ooh, ooh I love you
