		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do you hear me?
I'm talking to you
Across the water, across the deep blue ocean
Under the open sky, oh my
Baby, I'm trying
Boy, I hear you in my dreams
I feel your whisper across the sea
I keep you with me in my heart
You make it easier when life gets hard

Lucky I'm in love with my best friend
Lucky to have been where I have been
Lucky to be coming home again

Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

They don't know how long it takes
(They don't know how long it takes)
Waiting for a love like this
Every time we say goodbye
(Every time we say goodbye)
I wish we had one more kiss
I'll wait for you, I promise you, I will, I'm

Lucky I'm in love with my best friend
Lucky to have been where I have been
Lucky to be coming home again

Lucky we're in love in every way
Lucky to have stayed where we have stayed
Lucky to be coming home someday

And so I'm sailing through the sea
To an island where we'll meet
You'll hear the music fill the air
I'll put a flower in your hair
Though the breezes, through the trees
You move so pretty, you're all I see
As the world keeps spinning 'round
You hold me right here, right now

Lucky I'm in love with my best friend
Lucky to have been where I have been
Lucky to be coming home again

Lucky we're in love in every way
Lucky to have stayed where we have stayed
Lucky to be coming home someday

Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
