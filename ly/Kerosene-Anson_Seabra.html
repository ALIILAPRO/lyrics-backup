		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Empty bottles on a dusty wooden floor
A remedy I've tried too many times
Echoes in my mind of
Shouts and slamming doors
I've done better with goodbyes
Now the sun is heading back into it's grave
It's a cold october night
Taste the autumn air and hope to find a way
To keep the dark out of my mind

Kerosene, kerosene she lit me up
She left me numb i call her kerosene
Kerosene, kerosene she lit me up
She left me numb i call her kerosene

Light a candle as I lay me down to sleep
Watch the room begins to glow
Listen quietly to wind and rustling leaves
In the silence I'm at home
In my dreams I see her standing by the fire
Granite eyes reflect the flames
Humming softly 'til the embers start to tire
A faded memory that I saved

Kerosene, kerosene she lit me up
She left me numb i call her kerosene
Kerosene, kerosene she lit me up
She left me numb i call her kerosene

Mmm, mmm mmm, mmm

Kerosene, kerosene she lit me up
She left me numb i call her kerosene
Kerosene, kerosene she lit me up
She left me numb i call her kerosene
