		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Close your eyes, make a wish
When life ain't easy remember this
Just close your eyes and make a wish
All the troubles can be fixed
Close your eyes, make a wish
When life ain't easy, remember this
Just close your eyes and make a wish
All the troubles can be fixed

I wanna be, wanna be with you
Just pick up the phone and I'm with you
'Cause I know that lately life has played you rough
I wanna be, wanna be with you
Just pick up the phone and I'm with you
I just got to make sure you're not giving up

Close your eyes (close your eyes), make a wish (make a wish)
When life ain't easy (life ain't easy), remember this (remember this)
Just close your eyes (close your eyes) and make a wish (make a wish)
All the troubles (all the troubles) can be fixed (can be fixed)

I wanna be, I wanna be with you
Just pick up the phone and I'm with you
'Cause I know that lately life has played you rough
I wanna be, wanna be with you
Just pick up the phone and I'm with you
I just got to make sure you're not giving up (giving up)

Just close your eyes, make a wish
When life ain't easy, remember this
Just close your eyes and make a wish
All the troubles can be fixed

(Close your eyes)
(Close your eyes)

I wanna be, wanna be with you (hold on)
Just pick up the phone and I'm with you
'Cause I know that lately life has played you rough
I wanna be, wanna be with you
Just pick up the phone and I'm with you
I just got to make sure you're not giving up

Close your eyes (close your eyes), make a wish (make a wish)
When life ain't easy (life ain't easy), remember this (remember this)
Just close your eyes (close your eyes) and make a wish (make a wish)
All the troubles (all the troubles) can be fixed (can be fixed)

I wanna be, wanna be with you
Just pick up the phone and I'm with you
'Cause I know that lately life has played you rough
I wanna be, wanna be with you
Just pick up the phone and I'm with you
I just got to make sure you're not giving up

Close your eyes (hey, what's up?)
(How you doing?) remember this
Close your eyes (I hope you're well)
All the troubles can be fixed
