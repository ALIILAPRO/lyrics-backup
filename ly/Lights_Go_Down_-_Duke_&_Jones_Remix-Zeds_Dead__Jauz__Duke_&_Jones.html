		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When the lights go down, down
When the lights go down (down)
When the lights go down, down
When the lights (go down, down)

When the lights go down in the city
Are you coming my way? (Are you coming my way?)
When the lights go down in the city 
(When the lights go down in the city)
When the lights go down in the city
Are you coming my way?
When the lights go down in the city 
(When the lights go down in the city)

Are you coming my way?
Are you coming my way?
Are you coming my way?

Are you coming my way?
Are you coming my way?
Are you coming my way? (When the lights go down in the city)

Are you coming my way?
Are you coming my way?
Are you coming my way?
Are you coming my way?
Are you coming my way?

When the lights go
(When the lights go)

Are you coming my way?
Are you coming my way?
Are you coming my way?
Are you coming my way?
Are you coming my way?

When the lights go
(When the lights go)

When the lights go down in the city
Are you coming my way? (Are you coming my way?)
When the lights go down in the city 
(When the lights go down in the city)
When the lights go down in the city
Are you coming my way?
When the lights go down in the city 
(When the lights go down in the city)

Are you coming my way?
Are you coming my way?
Are you coming my way?

Are you coming my way?
Are you coming my way?
Are you coming my way? (When the lights go down in the city)
Are you coming my way?

Are you coming my way?

When the lights go

Are you coming my way?
Are you coming my way?
Are you coming my way?
Are you coming my way?
Are you coming my way?

When the lights go
