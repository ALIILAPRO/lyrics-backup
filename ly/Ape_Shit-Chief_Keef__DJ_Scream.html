		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Yung Lan on the track)
Yeah, me and my nigga, the Almighty S-O
See y'all fuck niggas out there perpetratin' ballin'
Actin' like y'all gettin' some money or somethin' (DJ Scream)
Damn, damn, damn, damn (my name hold weight for real nigga)
Damn, damn, damn (we gettin' that real money)
Damn, damn (you talkin' trash base around, you feel me?) 
Damn
Damn (Hoodrich, nigga) 
Damn (it's the Almighty S-O)
Damn (it's the DJ Scream, nigga) 
Damn, damn, damn, damn
(Ayo Sosa, go ape shit on these niggas) 
Damn, damn

'Member sellin' blows out my grandma house
Now I got enough money, get grandma a house
Try to rob me, I'ma pull that Nina out
It's extended so the clip stickin' out
You lil' Mickey Mouse, don't be snitchin' now
'Cause I'll send my hittas to come chase you down
Nina tote a dildo and she'll dick it down
He say he with the clout, put him in the clouds
I'm thirsty, trigger finger itchin' now

Let me catch a nigga then it's nigga down
I was totin' 50, now I'm pimpin' out
I need to buy some missiles now (Hoodrich)
Go ape shit, go ape shit
Don't make us put them guns in rotation
Nina let me down, then, oh baby
We pullin' out them choppers like the Haitians
Like the 80s, I'm goin' crazy
All this guap, all these foreigns, baby
Lotta shots in all these guns, baby
I know you wanna have my son, baby
