		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, I'm a big boy, baby
Got an apartment with a big TV
Yeah, I'm a big boy, babe
I pay my rent so I got somewhere to sleep

I got my big boots on
So tell your mans to keep his distance from me
Yeah, I'm a big boy, babe
I need a big ol' bag to satisfy me

I'm a big boy, babe
I don't start crying if you make fun of me
Yeah, I'm a big boy, honey
Ain't got problems with my insecurities

'Cause I'm a grown-ass man
And I don't need your compliments to make me feel good
I've been rockin' and a-rollin' since I was a stupid little kid

Yeah, I'm a big, big boy (big, big boy)
Big, big boy (he's a big, big boy)
I need a big, big girl (big, big girl)
To keep it real

(Keep it real)
(Keep it real)

Yeah, I'm a big, big boy
And I need something makes a dude feel real
I got a big hat on that makes me look like a cowboy from a film

Well, that's exactly what I want, man
I don't need your compliments to make me feel good
Yeah, I'm a big ol' boy
And I need class and security

Yeah, I'm a big, big boy (big, big boy)
I need a big, big love (he's a big, big boy)
Need a big, big girl (big, big girl)
To satisfy me

(Keep it real)
Is this thing even on, man?
Is this microphone on?
Uhmm
(Keep it real)
I'm about to pass the mic

Yeah, that's right
He's a big boy
Yes, captain daddy
In a world full of privileged minions
Let's have a real baddie
Check out his cant
He's gonna make y'all go boom, son
And he's got a belly
In total contrast with your six-pack beach bods on telly
Well, he's a big, big boy

And all the people in the club go
"Don't you want it?"
And all the people in the club go
"Don't you want it?"
And all the people in the club go
"Don't you want it?"

Don't you want it?
Don't you want it?
Don't you want it?
Don't you want it?

Don't you want it?
Don't you want it?

And all the people in the club go
Don't you want it?
Don't you want it?
