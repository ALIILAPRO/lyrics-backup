		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  VERSE
I can see the Christmas tree all lit up, 
but it's not done until we put the star upon it
Mama's baking in the kitchen, little houses
made of candy canes and ginger bread 
I'll wrap the presents, tie the ribbons 
I've packed my suitcase, bought my ticket

CHORUS
I can hear Christmas calling,  
Calling me everywhere I go
Whispering come on back now
It's been too long I know
I can hear the church bells ringing 
choir singing songs of hope
so clear I can't miss it
It's Christmas call
Come home for Christmas
Home for Christmas
Home
It's Christmas Calling me 
Come home for Christmas
Home for Christmas
Home


VERSE
Kids leave carrots for the reindeer
they've waited all year
For a chance to catch them landing on the roof
I still feel it, the childhood magic
Tis the season
I got to have it

BRIDGE
It's everywhere it's all of us
Singing silent night full of peace and love
