		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You walk through the subway, his eyes burn a hole in your back
A footstep behind you, he lunges prepared for attack
Scream for mercy, he laughs as he's watching you bleed
Killer behind you, his blood-lust defies all his needs

My innocent victims are slaughtered with wrath and despise
The mocking religion of hatred that burns in the night
I have no one, I'm bound to destroy all this greed
A voice inside me compelling to satisfy me

I can see what a knife's meant to be
And you'll never know how I came to foresee, see, see

My faith in believing is stronger than lifelines and ties
With the glimmer of metal my moment is ready to strike

Death call arises, a scream breaks the still of the night
Another tomorrow, remember to walk in the light
I have found you, and now there is no place to run
Excitement shakes me, oh God help me what have I done?
Ooh yeah, I've done it
Yeah

You walk through the subway, my eyes burn a hole in your back
A footstep behind you, he lunges prepared for attack
Scream for mercy, he laughs as he's watching you bleed
Killer behind you, my blood-lust defies all my needs
Ooh look out, I'm coming for you
