		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's so cold around you
But you don't seem to mind
Your heart seems indifferent
I'm trying to break the ice
I'm waiting now to bring the
Heat back to life you used to ignite me

Without the sun i don't know where you are
I don't know how we get through the dark
Without the sun all the love's running out
I don't wanna let go of your heart
Without the sun without the sun

It's so cold around you
But you don't seem to mind
Your heart seems indifferent
I'm trying to break the ice
I'm waiting now to bring the heat
Back to life you used to ignite me

Without the sun i don't know where you are
I Don't know how we get through the dark
Without the sun all the love's running out
I don't wanna let go of your heart

Without the sun without the sun
Without the sun

I don't know where you are
I don't know how we get through the dark
Without the sun all the love's running out
I don't wanna let go of your heart
Without the sun sun sun

Without the sun

I don't know where you are
I don't know how we get through the dark
Without the sun all the love's running out
I don't wanna let go of your heart
