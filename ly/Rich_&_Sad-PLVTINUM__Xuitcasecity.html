		  Rich & Sad Lyrics



Intro



Chorus



She a diva just like whitney

Toxic like she 06 Britney

Lines of coke to keep her body skinny

Re-up

With her daddy’s cash

Who’s to blame?

Insta-fame?

Or her family name

It’s a shame, she

Turned out this way

Yeah

Her

Closet full but she feel empty

It’s difficult being Rich & Sad



Verse

 

Beachfront mansion

Born in the Hamptons

She gets her way or

She throws a tantrum 

Moved to LA

But she talk Atlanta

She self proclaims

I’m such a Samantha

Tell me love

Tell me do you feel ok?

Do the drugs

Take all of the pain away?

21 

Dripping in some Cartier

It’s not enough

She’s slowly gonna waste away



Chorus



She a diva just like Whitney

Toxic like she 06 Britney

Lines of coke to keep her body skinny

Re-up

With her daddy’s cash

Who’s to blame?

Insta-fame?

Or her family name

It’s a shame, she

Turned out this way

Yeah

Her

Closet full but she feel empty

It’s difficult being rich & sad



Post-Chorus



Being rich & sad



Verse 2



Whose to blame but me

Got myself gassed up

Place the flame on me

I’ve been on medication 

Keep my pain at ease

Got my tank on E

I was in too deep

Feeling low

Starting living out my Hollywood dream

When we met you instantly became my source of dopamine

Now I regret ever thinking you would or were meant for me

Papa don’t preach

I aint been losing sleep

Cuz



Chorus



She a diva just like whitney

Toxic like she 06 Britney

Lines of coke to keep her body skinny

Re-up

With her daddy’s cash

Who’re to blame?

Insta-fame?

Or her family name

It’s a shame, she

Turned out this way

Yeah

Her

Closet full but she feel empty

It’s difficult being Rich & Sad



Post-Chorus



Being Rich & Sad

Being Rich & Sad

It’s difficult being Rich & Sad
