		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Reaching for cold hands
And I still don’t know where things stand
Been to cities, changed the sheets 
Where time explodes just to burn out in the streets
Comrades have a certain holiness 
That leads to bitter loneliness
Why is it that at any place
I get a feeling which I can’t escape

I stick to the tried and true 
I won’t be good enough for you
But what is good enough for you
Wake me up and yell at me
Then maybe you don’t fall asleep
And maybe we won’t fall asleep
And maybe we’ll unlearn ourselves someday
And love each other in an unselfish way
Maybe we’ll unlearn ourselves someday
And love each other in an unselfish way

You be the judge
Do I expect too much
Before you talk to me I should mention
I’m just attentive ‘cause I seek attention
You be the judge

Let me rephrase 
I’m not human but who is these days
But then again why is it that I see in any face
A feeling which I can’t escape
No no no no no no

I stick to the tried and true 
I won’t be good enough for you
But what is good enough for you
Wake me up and yell at me
Then maybe you don’t fall asleep
And maybe we won’t fall asleep
And maybe we’ll unlearn ourselves someday
And love each other in an unselfish way
Maybe we’ll unlearn ourselves someday, someday
And love each other in an unselfish way
