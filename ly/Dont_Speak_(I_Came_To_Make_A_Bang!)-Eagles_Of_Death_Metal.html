		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't move, don't speak, even whisper
There's something happenin' but don't be scared
I'm too smooth, you never see me coming
I'm never in a hurry, I'm just movin' fast

I said haow!
Oh yes you know I said haow!
I came to make a bang!
I said haow!
Yeah.
Yes I said haow!
I came to make a bang!

Pull me, I'm your fabulous weapon
I'll hit your target, girl, so you see
Well I'm in too tight, gonna feel it tonight, yeah
Baby here I stand, I'm your impossible man

I said haow!
Yes I said haow!
I came to make a bang!
I said haow!
Yeah!
I said haow!
I came to make a bang, yeah!

Don't move, don't speak, even whisper
You have my weapon, girl, but don't be scared
I'm in too tight, gonna feel it tonight, yeah
Baby girl, gonna take your whole world
Haow!
Yes I said haow!
I came to make a bang yeah!
Haow!
Yes I said haow!
I came to make a bang yeah!
Haow!
I came to make a bang yeah!
Haow!
