		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm on a wave
I'm on a wave, yeah-eh-eh
I'm on a wave
I'm on a wave, yeah-eh

Me, myself and I don't need you
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah
There's something 'bout them looks, deceitful
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah
What goes around comes around, karma
I don't fuss, I don't want drama
You know me and you know, we know, saga
We can go distance, lasting forever, yeah yeah yo
Manners don't deserve manners
Bad vibes don't deserve badders
And she will run out and vanish
'Cause when you step in, gyal, you have finishing moves
Now you leave a brother really confused
Dem other gyal dem mimicking you
It must be the m.O in you 'cause you're holding all this love
Spending money quite fast
Baby girl, you're quite bad
How you do it like that, like that?

Go away, go away, go away, go away
If you're only gonna bring bad vibe, bad vibe, bad vibe, bad vibes
Ay-ya-ya
You can stay, you can stay, you can come over here
If you know how to have good time, good time, good time, good time
Ay-ya-ya

Don't want none of that, no, none of that
Don't want none of that, no, none of that, no
Don't want none of your bad vibe, bad vibe, bad vibes
Don't want none of that, no, none of that
Don't want none of that, no, none of that, no
Don't want none of your bad vibe, bad vibe, bad vibes

I want the best for you
I want to give you all my love
Promise today with you
As long as you give me all your love
I won't be the kind of guy that could leave you hanging, leave you ah-ha
Give you from night to morning
I make you happy
Positive vibes, I can give
Give me chance, my gyal, you will see
I know your body believe
Said shawty you gotta go receive
(Zaga dat)

Go away, go away, go away, go away
If you're only gonna bring bad vibe, bad vibe, bad vibe, bad vibes
Ay-ya-ya
You can stay, you can stay, you can come over here
If you know how to have good time, good time, good time, good time
Ay-ya-ya

Don't want none of that, no, none of that
Don't want none of that, no, none of that, no
Don't want none of your bad vibe, bad vibe, bad vibes
Don't want none of that, no, none of that
Don't want none of that, no, none of that, no
Don't want none of your bad vibe, bad vibe, bad vibes

I'm on a wave
I'm on a wave, yeah-eh-eh
I'm on a wave
I'm on a wave, yeah-eh
I'm on a wave
I'm on a wave, yeah-eh-eh
I'm on a wave
I'm on a wave
(So go ahead, go away)

Go away, go away, go away, go away
If you're only gonna bring bad vibe, bad vibe, bad vibe, bad vibes
Ay-ya-ya
You can stay, you can stay, you can come over here
If you know how to have good time, good time, good time, good time
Ay-ya-ya

Don't want none of that, no, none of that
Don't want none of that, no, none of that, no
Don't want none of your bad vibe, bad vibe, bad vibes
Don't want none of that, no, none of that
Don't want none of that, no, none of that, no
Don't want none of your bad vibe, bad vibe, bad vibes (Zaga dat)

I'm on a wave
I'm on a wave, yeah-eh-eh
I'm on a wave
I'm on a wave, yeah-eh
