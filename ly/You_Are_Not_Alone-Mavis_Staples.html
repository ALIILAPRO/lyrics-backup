		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're not alone
I'm with you
I'm lonely too

What's that song
Can't be sung
By two?

A broken home
A broken heart
Isolated and afraid
Open up this is a raid
I wanna get it through to you
You're not alone

You're not alone
Every night
I stand in your place

Every tear
On every face
Tastes the same

A broken dream
A broken heart
Isolated and afraid
Open up this is a raid
I wanna get it through to you
You're not alone

An open hand
An open heart
There's no need to be afraid
Open up this is a raid
I wanna get it through to you
You're not alone
I wanna get it through to you
You're not alone
I'm gonna get it through to you
You're not alone
