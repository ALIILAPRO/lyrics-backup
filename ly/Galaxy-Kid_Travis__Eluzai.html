		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah

I went from loving you
To looking for love in the wrong place
In every corner of the galaxy, yeah
I will see your face (yeah)
There's no telling
Who is winning in this race
Wish destiny would just wait for us

We’ve been chasing moments just like us
With all of these pretty faces we don’t trust
I need to let you know I want you closer
I've been moving on
Keep trying to keep moving on
Do me right, even though it’s for the night
Do me right, make it sound right
Yeah (Make it sound right)

I went from loving you
To looking for love in the wrong place
In every corner of the galaxy, yeah
I will see your face (yeah)
There's no telling
Who is winning in this race
I Wish destiny would just wait

We’ve been chasing moments just like us
With all of these pretty faces we don’t trust
I need to let you know I want you closer
I've been moving on
Keep trying to keep moving on do me right
Even though it’s for the night
Do me right, make it sound right
Yeah (Make it sound right)


I went from loving you-to you-to
You-to you-to
