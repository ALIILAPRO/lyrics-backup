		  Uh 
Yeah bitch

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm in the hood, I'm with winners
Basketball seat in a Beamer
Pull up with sticks, pull up with clips, all on the hip
I turn a two to a six
Servin' these stripper hoes dick
You suckin' me, yeah, and I know it
All of this money I blow it
All of these hoes, yeah they goin'
All of my shooters they blowin' (Boom)
Anyway
Why you come over here if you ain't going
You a hoe thot and I know this
Beatin' the pot with the elbow
Skrt out the lane with the new whip
Diamonds in the ear like a Q-tip
Bitch give me top with them duck lips
Your boyfriend, he scared of me
I'm geeked up on diamonds outta me
Hairy pussy give me allergies
Bitch I don't shop at no Malleries
I get my diamonds from Icebox
Big Gucci link with the white rocks
Just like Chicago like White Sox
Tryna get a bitch with some dreadlocks
I got a bitch sippin' redrum
I don't even know where she came from
I walk around with an AK
Damn, that shit sound like a snare drum, yeah

This is the modern day pass out, ey
Diamonds on lighthouse

Double my cup till I pass out
Sippin' Act now, uh
Treat the Maybach like a Honda
Speed it up, swervin', might fall out
Lil' baby know I'm not average
I get the top, and I kick her out
My diamonds on igloo
