		  Mhm, mhm
Mhm, mhm

Here I am, stuck on this couch
Scrolling through my notes
Heart was broken, still no growing, nah

Waking up to headlines
Filled with devastation again
My heart is broken
But I keep going

Pain, but I won't let it turn into hate
No, I won't let it change me
Never losing sight of the one I keep inside
Now, I know it
Yeah, I know it

You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away

You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away
You can't take my youth away

It's hard to sleep at night
Oh, and what's outside?
Feeling hopeless
I need focus

You hit me with words 
I never heard come out your mouth
To be honest
I don't want it, no

Pain, but I won't let it turn into hate
No, I won't let it change me

You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away

You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away
You can't take my youth away (can't take my youth)
You can't take my youth away (oh, oh, yeah)

Pain, but I won't let it turn into hate
No, I won't let it change me
Pain, but I won't let it turn into hate
No, I won't let it change me

You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today (oh)
You can't take my youth away (youth away)

You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away (oh, yeah)

You can't take my youth away (can't take)
This soul of mine will never break (my youth)
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away (oh, oh, yeah)

You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away
You can't take my youth away
