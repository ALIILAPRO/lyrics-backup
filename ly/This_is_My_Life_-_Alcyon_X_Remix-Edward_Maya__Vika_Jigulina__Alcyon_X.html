		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming out loud
I'm searching the missing part of my heart
Uuuuu uuuu uuuu,you catch me every time I fall
When I look into your eyes
I just know you tell me lies

This, this is my life I'm looking for you searching love in your eyes
This, this my life I'm chasing a dream that fade away in the night

Can you get to my soul,
I'll make you lose the control,
I'll be your sun in the night

Just come here inside
I'm playing with you
I'm falling for you
When I look into your eyes
I just know you tell me lies

Ref: This,this is my life I'm looking for you searching love in your eyes
This, this my life I'm chasing a dream that fade away in the night

I can't follow dreams forever
Just to see them fall apart
We can change the world if we are together
'Cause I know I won't let it go
When I look into your eyes
I just know you tell me lies

This, this is my life I'm looking for you searching love in your eyes
This, this my life I'm chasing a dream that fade away in the night
I start to miss your smile,your voice is all I hear
I'm chasing hollow eyes,show me I'm wrong tonight
This,this is my life I'm looking for you searching love in your eyes
This, this my life I'm chasing a dream that fade away in the night
