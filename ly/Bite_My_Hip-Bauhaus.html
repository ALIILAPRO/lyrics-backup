		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Move my way, yeah, nice and slow
Find my foot, well it's over kinda low
It's easy to mistake for my bright red lip
Just move up a meter and
Bite my hip

Come on bite my hip

Bite my hip
Oh, hip
Hip
Who hip?

Mine lives here, this is so hard, you know
I enjoy feeling pain, I enjoy feeling low
You just nibble from my calf right down to my toe
Just as long as you get up and
Bite my hip

Ah, come on bite

Relax and enjoy, you can even talk to Roy
Why don't you make your way, don't so damn fake
Just do your best and I'll do the rest
Just as long as you get up and
Bite my hip

Come on, bite

Come on, bite my hip
Oh, hip
Who hip?
Hip

Bite my hip, hip
Bite my hip, well I think I'm goin' mad
You gotta bite my hip
Bite my hip, hip

Bite, bite, bite, bite
Bite, bite, bite, bite
Hip, hip, hip, hip
Hip, hip, hip, hip
Bite, bite, bite, bite
Bite, bite, bite, bite
Hip, hip, hip, hip
Hip, hip, hip, ah!
