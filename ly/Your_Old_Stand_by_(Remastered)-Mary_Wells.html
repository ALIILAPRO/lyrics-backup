		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She left you last night 
And today you called me on the phone 
Asked me if you could come over 
'Cause you didn't want to be alone 
So you want me to stand in for her 
And be the love of your next act 
But this time I play the part so well 
There'll be no need for her coming back, 'cause... 

CHORUS: 
You know that I'm your old stand-by 
You know that you can call on me 
I know the part so well that you can hardly tell 
That she's left you in misery 

I know you only called me 'cause you needed company 
'Cause once again she's left you and your heart's in misery, but... 
(chorus) 

(instrumental) 

(repeat and fade): 
I don't wanna be your old stand-by 
I wanna be with you permanently 
I'm gonna play the part from the depths of my heart 
And you won't need nobody but me
