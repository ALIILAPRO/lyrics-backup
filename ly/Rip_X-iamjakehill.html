		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'll be the stitches to your scars babe
Just hold me, just hold me
I'll be the stitches to your scars babe
Just hold me, just hold me

Part of me just wishes I could
Be a different kind of sinner
When bullets meet the opposition
Man no one's a winner
Fucking up but swear to god
That I'll change it give me a chance to win
Your love and I'll take it
Part of me just wishes I could
Be a different kind of sinner
When bullets meet the opposition
Man no one's a winner
Fucking up but swear to god
That I'll change it give me a chance to win
Your love and I'll take it

I'm better now riding round top down
Made some mistakes but I'm back up now
Back up now shut me down
That's okay, it's old news now
Just watch me drown
You love to see that shit finger out
While I'm sinking in digging deeper
Secret keeper evil speaker
'Til I meet the reaper draw my frown with
A permanent pen search for peace
I'll find it again i'm blinded again
By violent words oh god it hurts
But still I stand i'm still one man
With my own chains can't seem to break
What I've made everybody loves you when
You pass away now ask away
If you think I'm okay no

Yeah I know how it feels to be alone i
Know how it feels to be around people
And feel alone like
I'll be around other people
And like still feel alone even sometimes
I'll go out with my old
Friends- my previous friends
And I'll just feel alone and y'know I'm in
A position now where I was friends
With a lot of people and then I kinda felt
Abandoned, I've seen people choose
Material items over me
I've seen people choose

Part of me just wishes I could
Be a different kind of sinner
When bullets meet the opposition
Man no one's a winner
Fucking up but swear to god
That I'll change it give me a chance to win
Your love and I'll take it
Part of me just wishes I could
Be a different kind of sinner
When bullets meet the opposition
Man no one's a winner
Fucking up but swear to god
That I'll change it give me a chance to win
Your love and I'll take it
