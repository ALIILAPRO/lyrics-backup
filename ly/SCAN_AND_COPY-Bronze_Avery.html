		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby snake in the grass
Stabbing me in the back
Scan and copy me, yeah
I'm ready to attack
In the palm of my hands
He heard you out but he let you go
Begging him for a chance
It's personal

You can't put out a flame if I ignite it
He's addicted to me, that's why you like it
You don't run from boys like that, you invite them
You don't taste the things you jack, but you bite them

Take advice from me
What you get is what you see
Don't keep holding on to what, what it was
I can guarantee
For you, it's just a fantasy
Don't keep holding on to what it was (what it was)

NPC, can't play me
Constantly try to claim what's mine
How'd you end up like that?
You on the grid but you still alone
Begging him for a chance
'Cause you know it's personal

You can't put out a flame if I ignite it
He's addicted to me, that's why you like it
You don't run from boys like that, you invite them
You don't taste the things you jack, but you bite them

Take advice from me (ooh, yeah)
What you get is what you see
Don't keep holding on to what, what it was (what it was)
I can guarantee
For you, it's just a fantasy
Don't keep holding on to what it was (what it was)

NPC, can't play me
Constantly try to claim what's mine
How'd you end up like that?
You on the grid but you still alone
Begging him for a chance
'Cause you know it's personal

Take advice from me (yeah)
What you get is what you see
Don't keep holding on to what, what it was (what it was)
I can guarantee (oh, yeah)
For you, it's just a fantasy
Don't keep holding on to what it was (what it was)
