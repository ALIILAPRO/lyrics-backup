		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can remember when I used to see you passin' by
And it seemed in vain when it never changed
'Cause the only thing we said was 'Hi'
Then out of nowhere
We got together
'Cause we didn't try
But then just as fast as it came to pass
I was alone again starin' at the sky

I've come to discover you've got to think it out on your own
And it takes some time for the words to rhyme
To really feel what you've always knows
And when you break through
You might even feel
As though you can fly
But when it all comes down I hope I'm around
And not alone again starin' at the sky

Wonderin' why
I can't let go cause I,
I think you really know your mind
If you could show me a sign
And keep me from goin' blind.
