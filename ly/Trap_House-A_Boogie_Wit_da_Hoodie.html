		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ah nigga this is my trap house

I work hard for this bando, nigga this is my trap house
Big gun like I'm Rambo, keep on talking I'ma back out
Look who got the last laugh now
Nigga this is my trap house, nigga this is my trap house, nigga this is my trap house

I work hard for this bando, nigga this is my trap house
Big gun like I'm Rambo, keep on talking I'ma back out
Look who got the last laugh now
Nigga this is my trap house, nigga this is my trap house, nigga this is my trap house

When you step into my bando, you gonna have to light a candle
Window open for the damn smoke
Nigga listen to the damn flow
I don't think they understand tho, they want me dead but I can't go
That was all they ever planned for, Louie V with a Kenzo
If you come to my trap house talking crazy I'ma back out
Nike gloves with a mask out, I couldn't wait to try this Mac out
I'ma be up in this trap house, till' I count up then I pass out
I don't know what's in my stash now, check me out I'm in my bag now

I work hard for this bando, nigga this is my trap house
Big gun like I'm Rambo, keep on talking I'ma back out
Look who got the last laugh now
Nigga this is my trap house, nigga this is my trap house, nigga this is my trap house

I work hard for this bando, nigga this is my trap house
Big gun like I'm Rambo, keep on talking I'ma back out
Look who got the last laugh now
Nigga this is my trap house, nigga this is my trap house, nigga this is my trap house

In the trap house cooking, couple birds all took it
Hunnit grand need rubber bands, nigga understand I'm juggin'
Keep on thinking I'm pussy, ain't a killer don't push me
Got to make enough to bail out, just in case the police book me
50k up in the trap house, 100k up in the stash house
China man for the cash out, run it up 'till I max out
What I say up in this trap house, better stay up in this trap house
Ate the cheddar he a rat now, had to put him in a bag now

Ah had to put him in a bag now

Ah had to put him in a bag now

Ah

I work hard for this bando, nigga this is my trap house
Big gun like I'm Rambo, keep on talking I'ma back out
Look who got the last laugh now
Nigga this is my trap house, nigga this is my trap house, nigga this is my trap house
