		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fighting through the pain in my heart as I panic
Can't even look at myself 'cause all I feel is hate
Are my demons real or am I just dramatic
So many voices in my head that I can't concentrate
Stay away from me
Dying just to have some clarity to see
I can't let this be
Or I'll end up as a casualty
So I'll hang on
Til my hands are numb
It's either turn and face the pain
Or slip away
So read the signs in my scars
I didn't make it this far
Just to walk away
When everything's tell me to leave
I will never run
Never run
Finding my way through the dark and the struggle
To take me out you'll have to hit me with more than pain
I used to lie to myself that I'm invincible
But I'm still here and you're in my way
I won't break so take a swing or step away
I hate that you wanna see me suffocate
So I'll hang on
Til my hands are numb
It's either turn and face the pain
Or slip away
So read the signs in my scars
I didn't make it this far
Just to walk away
When everything's tell me to leave
I will never run
The way I am I don't think that you could understand
It's clear to me that my fate is resting in my hands
You want to see me fall but this is where I take a stand
You're not a threat anymore
This is not the end
I won't run
Face me you'll find out I'm here to stay
Too late you'll never be the death of me
So I'll hang on
Til my hands are numb
It's either turn and face the pain
Or slip away
So read the signs in my scars
I didn't make it this far
Just to walk away
When everything's tell me to leave
I won't die that easily
Though the past is my enemy
When everything is telling me to leave
I will never run
No I will never back down
You can not silence me now
I will survive your hell
When everything is telling me to leave
Never run
Never run
