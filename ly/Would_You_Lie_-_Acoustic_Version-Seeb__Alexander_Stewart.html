		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Not sure there's anything, but painful
For watching the love of your life move on
There's nothing I can do to change it
I know you're already too far gone

I don't do it for you anymore
I don't excite you, not like I used to
And I guess you're just runnin' out of love
Oh, I can't blame you, but I gotta ask you

Would you lie, lie to me tonight?
Bring me back to summer when your heart was mine
Oh, would you lie, lie just for the night?
Make it feel like where I'm running out of time

Would you lie?
Would you lie?
Would you lie?
Would you lie?

(Would you lie?)
(Would you lie?)

The hardest part is I still love you
And God knows there's no way to change your mind, oh-oh
I've played a million times over
I still don't know how could I be so blind

I don't do it for you anymore
I don't excite you, not like I used to
And I guess you're just runnin' out of love
Oh, I can't blame you, but I gotta ask you

Would you lie, lie to me tonight?
Bring me back to summer when your heart was mine
Oh, would you lie, lie just for the night?
Make it feel like we're not running out of time

Would you lie?
Would you lie?
Would you lie?
Would you lie?

(Would you lie?)
(Would you lie?)

Lie, lie to me tonight?
Bring me back to summer when your heart was mine
Oh, would you lie, lie just for the night?
Make it feel like where I'm running out of time
