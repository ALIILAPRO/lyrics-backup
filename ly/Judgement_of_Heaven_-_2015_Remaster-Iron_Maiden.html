		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A lonely cry for help reaching out for help to anyone 
A silent prayer to God to help you on your way 
I've been depressed so long 
It's hard to remember when I was happy 
I've felt like suicide a dozen times or more 
But that's the easy way, that's the selfish way 
The hardest part is to get on with your life 

You're searching in the dark 
Clutching at straws to find a way 
You take the Tarot cards and throw them to the wind 

You questions your beliefs
Your inner thoughts, your whole existence 
And if there is a God then answer if you will 
And tell me of my fate, tell me of my place 
Tell me if I'll ever rest in peace 

If you could live your life again 
Would you change a thing or leave it all the same 
If you had the chance again 
Would you change a thing at all 
When you look back at your past 
Can you say that you are proud of what we've done 
Are there times when you believe 
That the right you thought was wrong 

All of my life I have believed 
Judgment of Heaven is waiting for me

All of my life I have believed 
Judgment of Heaven is waiting for me
Waiting for me
Waiting for me
Waiting for me
Yeah, yeah

All of my life now, I have believed 
Judgment of Heaven awaits for me

All of my life now, I have believed 
Judgment of Heaven awaits for me, yeah

All of my life I have believed 
Judgment of Heaven is waiting for me

All of my life I have believed 
Judgment of Heaven is waiting for me
Waiting for me
Waiting for me
Waiting for me
Yeah, yeah
Yeah

Yeah
