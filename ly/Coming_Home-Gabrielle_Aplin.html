		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wonder where my friend has gone 
I wonder where it all went wrong 
Was there something that I should have known?
I looked for him in Amsterdam 
I cried for him in Birmingham
Wondered if he's ever coming home 

Coming home, coming home 
Standing underneath the sky
With nothing of my own 
I'm here picking flowers
But all my seeds are left unsown 
Better off if he was coming home 
Better off if he was coming home

Had a man, tall and fine 
I left him by an old road sign 
Told him I was off to Mexico 
With my feet on the track 
And your shadow on my back 
Wandered if I'm ever coming home 

Coming home, coming home 
Standing underneath the sky
With nothing of my own 
I'm here picking flowers
But all my seeds are left unsown 
Better off if he was coming home 
Better off if he was coming home

Coming home, coming home 
Standing underneath the sky
With nothing of my own 
I'm here picking flowers
But all my seeds are left unsown 
Better off if he was coming home 
Better off if he was coming home
Better off if he was coming home
Better off if he was coming home
