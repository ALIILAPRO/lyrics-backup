		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Within the walls of Eden Prison
There is a mark upon a stone
And in this place a life was written
And there a stain was laid where I was born
Now, moving through the roots of trees
Deep may their fingers reach
The substance of a mind that feeds
The bodies of the living stones that lead

Up to become the walls of Eden Prison

The supine wild beast upon the slab
Would gladly rip the throat from God
If only he could reach up to his white ass
And I am free and will never breathe again
Within the greasy ochre walls of Eden Prison
I am free, I will begin again
I am free, I will begin again

I am free of the choking hold
That began in Eden Prison

We are free, we are free
We are free, we are free
But the ships, they sail a sea
Of glistening turning crimson

They are carrying a cargo to unload
At Eden Prison
