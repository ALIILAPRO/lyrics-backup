		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You have the power
You wear the crown
From the pinnacle
To the pit

It is a long way down

You wield the scepter
You wear the gown
From the pinnacle
To the pit

It is a long way down

In your empire
They stare and frown
From the pinnacle
To the pit

It is a long way down

You are cast out from the heavens to the ground
Blackened feathers falling down
You are cast out from the heavens to the ground
Blackened feathers falling down
You will wear your independence like a crown

Cruciger globus
You stand your ground
The orbus figure
What's flat looks round
From the pinnacle
To the pit

It is a long way down

You are cast out from the heavens to the ground
Blackened feathers falling down
You are cast out from the heavens to the ground
Blackened feathers falling down
You will wear your independence like a crown
