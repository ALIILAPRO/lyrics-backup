		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Your lipstick, his collar
Don't bother, angel
I know exactly what goes on

When everything you'll get is everything that you've wanted, princess
(Well, which would you prefer?)
My finger on the trigger, or
(Me face down, down across your floor?)
Me face down, dead across your floor
(Me face down, down across your floor)
Well, just so long as this thing's loaded

And will you tell all your friends
You've got your gun to my head?
This all was only wishful thinking
This all was only wishful thinking
And will you tell all your friends
You've got your gun to my head?
This all was only wishful thinking
This all was only wishful thinking
Let's go

Don't bother trying to explain, angel
I know exactly what goes on when you're on, and
How 'bout I'm outside of your window?
(Well, how 'bout I'm outside of your window)
Watching him keep the details covered
You're such a sucker for a sweet talker, yeah
(You're such a sucker)

And will you tell all your friends
You've got your gun to my head?
This all was only wishful thinking
This all was only wishful thinking
And will you tell all your friends (the only thing)
You've got your gun to my head? (I regret)
This all was only wishful thinking (is that I)
This all was only wishful thinking (I never let you hold me back)

Hoping for the best just hoping nothing happens
A thousand clever lines unread on clever napkins
I will never ask if you don't ever tell me
I know you well enough to know you'll never love me
Hoping for the best just hoping nothing happens (why can't I feel anything)
A thousand clever lines unread on clever napkins 
I will never ask if you don't ever tell me (from anyone other than you?)
I know you well enough to know you'll never love me
Hoping for the best just hoping nothing happens (why can't I feel anything)
A thousand clever lines unread on clever napkins 
I will never ask if you don't ever tell me (from anyone other than you?)
I know you well enough to know
And all of this was all your fault
And all of this
(It makes things worse)

I stay wrecked and jealous for this
For this simple reason I
Just need to keep you in mind
As something larger than life
I stay wrecked and jealous for this (she'll destroy us all before she's through)
For this simple reason I
Just need to keep you in mind (and find a way to blame somebody else)
As something larger than life
I stay wrecked and jealous for this (she'll destroy us all before she's through)
For this simple reason I
Just need to keep you in mind (and find a way to blame somebody else)
As something larger than life
