		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm wearing thin wearing out becoming weak
Holding hands with this rope she's my self-destructive
Bleeding disease the things that makes it hard to breathe
But if I shoved you far away
This addict just starved again asphyxiated

(Chorus)
And now I see it's you that's tearing me ensnaring me
This is me dying in your arms I cut you out now set me free

Lynched high above what used to be
In her gallows built for me
So I escaped cut this noose around my
Neck I break free to see the things you blinded me
And I shoved you far away
Now I live the life I dreamed of
You're dead to me

(Chorus x2)

You poisoned my life
So I take this knife
And I cut you out
Cut you out

(Chorus x2)
