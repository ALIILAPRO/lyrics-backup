		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Who can I love 
When they tell me I can't love myself?
How in the Hell could I possibly love someone else?
Who can I love 
When they tell me I can't love myself? 
(Let me know) This for them niggas like me
How in the Hell could I possibly love someone else?

Who can I love 
When they tell me I can't love myself? 
(Let me know) It don't matter what they say 'bout you
How in the Hell could I possibly love someone else?
(Let me know)
Who can I love 
When they tell me I can't love myself? 
(Let me know) This for them niggas like me
How in the Hell, could I possibly love someone else?

Some things we can't explain
Why do we act this way?
Why don't we make it easier 
For the world to change someday?
Sometimes I contemplate
Some things my heart can't take
Why do we hurt one another? 
Fight our brother, kill and rape?
Love can trump it all
I know you seen it all (yeah)
I know you a star
You just have to believe in who you are
Who can you love?

Who can I love 
When they tell me I can't love myself? 
(Let me know) This for them niggas like me
How in the Hell could I possibly love someone else?
Who can I love 
When they tell me I can't love myself? 
(Let me know) It don't matter what they say 'bout you
How in the Hell could I possibly love someone else?
(Let me know)
Who can I love 
When they tell me I can't love myself? 
(Let me know) This for them niggas like me
How in the Hell, could I possibly love someone else?

And with livin' comes with ills
Don't let 'em make you feel like the world can't heal
It's hard out here
Despite your fears, keep holdin' on
With all those tears, you can't hold 'em on
And how?
'Cause somebody else know you
If you don't know you, you're searchin'
But what's missin' is your heart
Who can I love?

Who can I love 
When they tell me I can't love myself? 
(Let me know) This for them niggas like me
How in the Hell could I possibly love someone else?
(Let me know)
Who can I love 
When they tell me I can't love myself? 
(Let me know) It don't matter what they say 'bout you
How in the Hell could I possibly love someone else?
Who can I love 
When they tell me I can't love myself? 
(Let me know) This for them niggas like me
How in the Hell, could I possibly love someone else?
