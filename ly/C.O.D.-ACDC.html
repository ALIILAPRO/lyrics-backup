		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Call of a dog, cry of a bitch
The cream of a dream is the cause of the itch
Call on the doctor, cash on demand
If I get enough rope, might even hang

C.O.D., care of the devil
C.O.D., the devil in me
C.O.D., care of the devil
Care of the devil in me

The curse of love is the cause of the pain
The crime of the day is when you do it again
Call on the doctor, cash on demand
If you give them a finger, they'll take off your hand

C.O.D., care of the devil
C.O.D., the devil in me
C.O.D., care of the devil
Care of the devil in me
Down to the devil with me

That call of a dog, cry of a bitch
The sign of a sinner's the size of his itch

C.O.D., care of the devil
C.O.D., the devil in me
C.O.D., care of the devil
C.O.D., oh
C.O.D., care of the devil
C.O.D., the devil in me
C.O.D., care of the devil
C.O.D., oh, care of the devil in me

I'm paying, paying
I'm paying C.O.D
Care of the devil
Care of the devil in me
It's the curse of love
