		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Time has come to listen to the crying of their puppet souls

君がそんなにもっと楽をして
行き詰まった未来と合図
Words are strong, heart is dropped, scatter around and falls

偽りの contact-everything
誘い込んだ傷が混ざる
誰も忘れた悲しみが fall out

偽名はただ凍る 希望のジレンマ
息削ぎ落とす行動も抑える
そう解っている答えなど捨ててしまえ

Yeah, get started breaking the row
See how it spreads out, it's beyond full real-ization
Yeah, get started re-creating the world
Take my hands till the end, feel this raw emotion

Bring it on down rock, rock, rock
Shake it up, up, tap, top, top
'Cause I know how to shout out my soul
Bring it on down rock, rock, rock
Shake it up, up, tap, top, top
'Cause you know how to shout out your soul

I've got a feeling, you must let me go
I wanna keep my faith forever
Words are alive, supporting us, connecting with the souls

I'm gonna fight them all to let you go
I wanna seek my way to answer
Words are alive, supporting us, connecting with the souls

You know what? We look up to the sky, count on it
And halos in the clouds light me up, then I awake
In the heat, get fired up, you'll call my name

Yeah, get started breaking the row
See how it spreads out, it's beyond full real-ization
Yeah, get started re-creating the world
Take my hands till the end, feel this raw emotion

Bring it on down rock, rock, rock
Shake it up, up, tap, top, top
'Cause I know how to shout out my soul
Bring it on down rock, rock, rock
Shake it up, up, tap, top, top
'Cause you know how to shout out your soul

偽名はただ凍る 希望のジレンマ
息削ぎ落とす行動も抑える
そう解っている答えなど捨ててしまえ

Oh yeah, get started breaking the row
See how it spreads out, it's beyond full real-ization
Yeah, get started re-creating the world
Take my hands till the end, feel this raw emotion

Bring it on down rock, rock, rock
Shake it up, up, tap, top, top
'Cause I know how to shout out my soul
Bring it on down rock, rock, rock
Shake it up, up, tap, top, top
'Cause you know how to shout out your soul

Time has come to listen to the crying of their puppet souls
