		  Every day I wake up
Every day I wake up alone
Every day I wake up
Every day I wake up alone

Let me open up the discussion with 
I'm not impressed 
With any mother fucking word I say
See I lied that I cried
When he came inside
And now I'm burning a highway Hades

Shut the fuck up
When I'm trying to think
I gotta keep my concentration 
Give me one more drink
And then I'll try to remember all the advice 
That my good book told me

And all the lost souls say
Every day I wake up
Every day I wake up alone
(Kill me just kill me)
Or get me out of the sun
Every day I wake up
Every day I wake up alone
(Kill me just kill me)
Someone get me out of the sun

Drugs, bars, backseats of cars blowing boys
What a boring life I've led so far
Just a prime thirteen 
When I rode his machine
Tried to keep my body dirty 
And my eyes closed and clean

So with a wink 
And a smile and a vial of meth
I took his hand 
And then we walked through the shadow of death
And then I tried to remember all the advice that my teacher told me

And all the lost souls say
Every day I wake up
Every day I wake up alone
(Kill me just kill me)
Or get me out of the sun
Every day I wake up
Every day I wake up alone
(Kill me just kill me)
And get me out of the sun
Someone get me out of the sun
Someone get me out of the sun

Deep, deeper, deeper inside
Pull the wool nice and tight
So that it covers your eyes
Can't find a god, love, Jesus, father
I don't even care that much
So why do I even bother?

So let me just end how I was gonna begin
Don't waste your time waiting 'cause I'm going back in
Now if I could just remember all the advice that my mother told me

And all the
And all the lost souls say
Every day I wake up
Every day I wake up alone
(Kill me just kill me)
Or get me out of the sun
Every day I wake up
Every day I wake up alone
(Kill me just kill me)
Just get me out of the sun
(Kill me just kill me)
Someone get me out of the sun
(Kill me just kill me)
Someone get me out of the sun
