		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hush, don't speak a word about the dreams that I live for.
It hurts to reach you when I'm down,
Don't speak again; I'm still waiting for my turn
It hurts to reach you when I'm down

My dreams are growing into
Frustrations when I hear your voice
(Feeding me till I'm choking)
(Feeding me till I'm choking)
My ears are ringing louder
Repeating words that bring me down
(Ringing, my ears are bleeding)
(Ringing, my ears are bleeding)

So hold your breath and spare me
The pointless conversation, I'm running out of patience
Don't blame me for trying to (reach)

Hush don't speak a word about the dreams that I live for
It hurts to reach you when I'm down
Don't speak again; I'm still waiting for my turn
It hurts to reach you when I'm down

As you are moving forward
I feel as if I can't catch up
(Trying so hard to reach you)
(Trying so hard to reach you)
I'm stuck here at the bottom
You're too high up to come back down
(Trying so hard to reach you)
(Trying so hard to reach you)

So hold your breath and spare me
(The pointless conversation, I'm running out of patience)
Don't blame me for trying to (reach)

Hush don't speak a word about the dreams that I live for
It hurts to reach you when I'm down
Don't speak again; I'm still waiting for my turn
It hurts to reach you when I'm down

Silence your harsh words my dear
My ears are ringing of this
I can't stop thinking of it
(I try to reach you but I fall)

Silence your harsh words my dear
My ears are ringing of this
I can't stop thinking of it

Silence your harsh words my dear
My ears are ringing of this
I can't stop thinking of it

Hush don't speak a word about the dreams that I live for
It hurts to reach you when I'm (down)
Don't speak again; I'm still waiting for my turn
It hurts to reach you when I'm (down)
