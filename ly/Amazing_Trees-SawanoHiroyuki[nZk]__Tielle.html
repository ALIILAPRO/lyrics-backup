		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  僕はホコリだけの答えを
見つけた顔しながら
外で本当の言葉を
置き忘れていたんだ
裏返しの過去に
明かりを照らしてても
誤魔化したこれまでの声が
横で目を覚ます
走り出すのが 当たり前だったと
うろ覚えなふりを
時に濡れた道の砂が靴の底に詰まる
振り落とせば出れる路地
Getting me all upset.
I just wanna be free.
I couldn't!
Truth that I have been hiding,
it's so hard to see.
You've been
getting me all upset.
I have fallen too far!
I couldn't grow the way
I've been wanting.
You know who you are!
We're all amazing trees
reaching up to the stars.
Though we're no longer children
they sing in our hearts.
We know the time
that's passing
is not everlasting.
Stop telling yourself the lies.
I wanna change
それはずれた祈りをかわし
また後ろに近づく
あの日出逢った喜びを
無邪気に掲げながら
迷路に似たような怖さと期待の影
これが最後みたいな風通るのは
街のせいじゃない
泣き出した日が 立つ未来選んだ
スローペースと向き合う
焦る月が惑わす空で
通り雨に打たれる
幼い日々が 直線を歌う
Getting me all upset.
I just wanna be free.
I couldn't!
Truth that I have been hiding,
it's so hard to see.
You've been
getting me all upset.
I have fallen too far!
I couldn't grow the way
I've been wanting.
You know who you are!
We're all amazing trees
reaching up to the stars.
Though we're no longer children
they sing in our hearts.
We know the time
that's passing
is not everlasting.
Stop telling yourself the lies.
I wanna change
Amazing Trees
Amazing Trees
空側に眺めた色は
影さえ消えた雑じり気ないold＆new
Getting me all upset.
I just wanna be free.
I couldn't!
Truth that I have been hiding,
it's so hard to see.
You've been
getting me all upset.
I have fallen too far!
I couldn't grow the way
I've been wanting.
You know who you are!
We're all amazing trees
reaching up to the stars.
Though we're no longer children
they sing in our hearts.
We know the time
that's passing
is not everlasting.
Stop telling yourself the lies.
I wanna change
