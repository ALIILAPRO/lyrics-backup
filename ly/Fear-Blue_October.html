		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All my life
Been running from a pain in me
A feeling I don't understand
Holding me down

So rain on me
Underwater
All I am, getting harder
A heavy weight
I carry around

Today
I don't have to fall apart
I don't have to be afraid
I don't have to let the damage
Consume me,
My shadow see through me

'Cause fear in itself
Will reel you in and spit you out
Over and over again
Believe in yourself
And you will walk
Now, fear in itself
Will use you up and break you down
Like you were never enough
Yeah, I used to fall, now I get back up

I'm up here
I'm looking at the way down there
I'm staring through the I don't care
It's staring back at me

The beauty is
I'm learning how to face my beast
Starting now to find some peace
Set myself free, yeah

Today
I don't have to fall apart
I don't have to be afraid
I don't have to let the damage consume me
My shadow see through me

'Cause fear in itself
Will reel you in and spit you out
Over and over again
Believe in yourself
And you will walk
And now, fear in itself
Will use you up and break you down
Like you were never enough
I used to fall but now I get back up

I'm moving on
Oh God just move on

Today
I don't have to fall apart
I don't have to be afraid
Get back up
Get up

Feel it, fear, wow
And now fear, fear in itself can use you up
And then breaks you down
You're never enough
And I used to fall

Breathe
Ask for more
If you're bitter still
Ask him to help you carry on
