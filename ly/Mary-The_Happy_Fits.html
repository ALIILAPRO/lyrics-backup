		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mary's an animal, as sick as they come.
Taste of a cannibal, on top of her tounge.
She'll fill you with loving and drink out your blood.
She's trying to kill me but I just want you.

What's a matter with the company jet?
What's a matter with those rolled cigarettes?
You still feel like a loner, you feel like a loner little lamb.
What's a matter with those ivory keys?
What's a matter with the life that you lead?
You still feel like a loner, you feel like a loner little lamb.

Can you feel anything? cre you more than a sensitive man?
There she is plain as day. She would love, oh, to take you away.
I just want you.

Cold-blooded, as cruel as can be;
cbuse her or you'll always need
Oh, to feel mary's loving, to feel mary's loving little lamb.
Stop running and fuel the disease.
Don't use her or you'll always need
To feel mary's loving, feel mary's loving, little lamb.

What's a matter with your silicone dress?
Can't you see you've made a terrible mess?
You still feel like a loner, you feel like a loner little lamb.

Can you feel anything? cre you more than a sensitive man?
There she is plain as day. She would love, oh, to take you away.
I just want you.

Cold-blooded, as cruel as can be;
cbuse her or you'll always need
Oh, to feel mary's loving, to feel mary's loving little lamb.
Stop running and fuel the disease.
Don't use her or you'll always need
To feel mary's loving, feel mary's loving, little lamb.

Mary's an animal, as sick as they come.
Taste of a cannibal, on top of her tounge.
She'll fill you with loving and drink out your blood.
She's trying to kill me but I just want you.
