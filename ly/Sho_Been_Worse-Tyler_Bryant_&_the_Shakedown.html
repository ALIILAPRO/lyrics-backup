		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Waiting on a train
Suitcase by my side
Ticket in my hand
That's all I need to ride, watch me ride

Life has knocked me down
I've been knocked down before
You won't catch me cryin' or lying on the floor
No no no

I've been better
But I sho been worse
I've been better
But I sho been worse
I ain't last
I ain't first
I ain't blessed
I ain't cursed
I've been better
But I sho been worse

If you've got a light
Don't let em put it out
If you're on a high
Don't let em pull you down
Don't let em pull you down

I've been better
But I sho been worse
I've been better
But I sho been worse
I ain't last
I ain't first
I ain't blessed
I ain't cursed
I've been better
But I sho been worse
