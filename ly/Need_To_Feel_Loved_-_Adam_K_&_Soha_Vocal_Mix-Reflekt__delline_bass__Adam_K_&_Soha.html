		  Reflekt - Need To Feel Loved Lyrics
Come and catch me baby, I'm falling
Come and save me baby, I'm calling
Come and be with me baby, come as you are.
Come and catch a fire baby, don't let me fade away, don't let me fade away 
Come and catch a feeling, it's a electrifying me
With eyes wide open, I'm dreaming
Breathe for me baby, a wake before I'm down
Come and free me baby, a wake before I'm down, 
a wake before I'm down

Come and touch me baby
I need to be loved
Come and hold me baby
I need to feel loved, I need to feel loved
Come and catch a fire, don't let me fade away
Come and catch a fire baby, don't let me fade away 
Come and catch a feeling, it's a electrifying me
Eyes wide open, I'm dreaming
Pray for me baby, awake before I'm down
Pray for me baby, awake before I'm down
Come and touch me baby
I need to belong
Come and hold me baby
I need to feel loved
I'm in love, in love, in love
I'm in love, in love, in love
I'm in love
I'm in love

I'm in love, in love, in love
I'm in love, in love, in love
I'm in love
I'm in love

Come and touch & me baby
I need to be loved
Come & hold me baby
I need to feel loved
I need to feel loved
I need to feel loved
I need to feel loved
I need to feel loved
