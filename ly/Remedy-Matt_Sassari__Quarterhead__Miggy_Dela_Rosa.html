		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We could be anywhere
Take your hand
And I will follow you through the dark

Even If nothings clear
I Don't care
Cause I'd rather be where you are

I can't deny this feeling you and I
It's like the world is slowing down in time
And every breath of yours is one of mine
You bring out the best in me
You're my only remedy

I can't deny this feeling you and I
It's like the world is slowing down in time
And every breath of yours is one of mine
You bring out the best in me
You're my only remedy

You're my only remedy
Uh my remedy

Loves just a game we play
Chances that we take
I’m ready to take the fall
Like pictures without a frame
Never hesitate
I’m ready to risk it all

I can't deny this feeling you and I
It's like the world is slowing down in time
And every breath of yours is one of mine
You bring out the best in me
You're my only remedy

I can't deny this feeling you and I
It's like the world is slowing down in time
And every breath of yours is one of mine
You bring out the best in me
You're my only remedy

You're my only remedy
Uh my remedy
