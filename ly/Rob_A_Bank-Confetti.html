		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh, would I be crazy if I thought the world was fake?
A game of simulation aliens play from outer space
The players pick their religion
That's what starts the competition
Could be stupid 'cause I watch too many movies
Maybe work is weighing heavy on my mind
Maybe I'm just sick and tired of doing the same shit every time
Wanna try a new position maybe flip a 69
Don't want a doctor tellin' me that I'm insane man

I wanna rob a bank (rob a bank, rob a bank)
Spread the money through the streets (through the streets, through the streets)
Walk up to a stranger screaming stick 'em up freeze (up freeze)
But I'm too worried 'bout what other people think
I wanna rob a bank (rob a bank, rob a bank)
Fuck around and make a scene (make a scene, make a scene)
Make the most wanted on TV, yeah that's me (that's me)
But I'm too worried 'bout what other people think

Awesome

Who's to say that I can't break into your house
While you're working
I'm just lurking through your bedroom like a mouse
Gettin' naked on your sofa wearing just
Your penny loafers
Take some pictures leave 'em by your dirty dishes
Back your Rover down the driveway
Drive it down the highway
Fly that mother fucker off a bridge
Buy some drugs, sell some drugs
Buy a gun just because
I don't want anyone to think that I'm a bitch

I wanna rob a bank (rob a bank, rob a bank)
Spread the money through the streets (through the streets, through the streets)
Walk up to a stranger screaming stick 'em up freeze (up freeze)
But I'm too worried 'bout what other people think
I wanna rob a bank (rob a bank, rob a bank)
Fuck around and make a scene (make a scene, make a scene)
Make the most wanted on TV, yeah that's me (that's me)
But I'm too worried 'bout what other people think

Ooh would I need to dream
If I had self esteem
'Cause when you life's like a movie
You can do anything
I wanna rob a bank (I wanna rob a bank baby)
Spread the money through the streets (spread the money to the streets baby)
Walk up to a stranger screaming stick 'em up freeze

I wanna rob a bank (rob a bank, rob a bank)
Spread the money through the streets (through the streets, through the streets)
Walk up to a stranger screaming stick 'em up freeze (up freeze)
But I'm too worried 'bout what other people think
I wanna rob a bank (rob a bank, rob a bank)
Fuck around and make a scene (make a scene, make a scene)
Make the most wanted on TV, yeah that's me (that's me)
But I'm too worried 'bout what other people think
