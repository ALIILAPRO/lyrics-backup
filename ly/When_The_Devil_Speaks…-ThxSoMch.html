		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know it ain't punk
If we're not fucking until we fed up
I know it ain't love
If we're not blowing each other's head off
I know we don't stop
'Til we start hurting ourselves a lil
And we go ayo, ayo, ayo, ay-

I know it ain't punk
If we're not fucking until we fed up
I know it ain't love
If we're not blowing each other's head off
I know we don't stop
'Til we start hurting ourselves a lil
And we go ayo, ayo, ayo, ayo
I know it ain't punk
If we're not fucking until we fed up
I know it ain't love
If we're not blowing each other's head off
I know we don't stop
'Til we start hurting ourselves a lil
And we go ayo, ayo, ayo, ayo

Yeah, huh
Have you ever felt like you're a dummy on a hunt?
Have you ever been addicted to the taste of your own blood?
Feel like my whole like I just been tryna find the love
But now I'm staring down the barrel of a semi-auto gun
And I wanna quit, I take some shit that make me feel, ooh
'Cause everyday I wake up it's just ch-ch-boom
I just hope my family doesn't see this and go ayo, ayo, ay-

Guarantee
It's c'est la vie out here
Trippin' off shit that I don't know
'Cause I don't care
Hittin' off the light
If I can't sleep then I can't bear
Hate on me or leave me be
I don't care
'Cause no one hating me more than myself that I'm aware
I don't need no counsellor
Bitch, I need your fucking prayer
When the devil speaks, he says to me
"Aw, man, I think there's something wrong inside of your head"
Ayo, ayo, ay

I know it ain't punk
If we're not fucking until we fed up
I know it ain't love
If we're not blowing each other's head off
I know we don't stop
'Til we start hurting ourselves a lil
And we go ayo, ayo, ayo, ayo
I know it ain't punk
If we're not fucking until we fed up
I know it ain't love
If we're not blowing each other's head off
I know we don't stop
'Til we start hurting ourselves a lil
And we go ayo, ayo, ayo, ayo

Yeah, huh
I know you been chewing on the same old piece of gun
I know you been moving out your mind, it's to and from
Hoping that the leaves would change our colors
But now I'm standing on the ledge and acting like I'm 'bout to jump
'Til I shoot that shit it bubble up and make me, ooh
'Til my mama tell me, "Stop, not cool"
Took that shit and now I need another to go ayo, ayo, ay

Oh, they want me dead
So put a gun to my head
Aw, yeah, now we talkin' shit I like
Next step I need the chair
I don't need no counsellor
Bitch, I need your fucking prayer
When the devil speaks, he says to me
"Aw, man, I think there's something wrong inside of your head"
Ayo, ayo, ay

I know it ain't punk
If we're not fucking until we fed up
I know it ain't love
If we're not blowing each other's head off
I know we don't stop
'Til we start hurting ourselves a lil
And we go ayo, ayo, ayo, ayo
I know it ain't punk
If we're not fucking until we fed up
I know it ain't love
If we're not blowing each other's head off
I know we don't stop
'Til we start hurting ourselves a lil
And we go ayo, ayo, ayo, ayo

Ayo, huh
