		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Let me speak to your manager)
Oh, you mean Benji? He's fucking busy
'Cause I just drove through AP 
On my brand-new jet ski
So leave some tears after the 

If you're feeling silly
I'll call you, beep you later
If Otto doesn't serial kill me 
(Otto, I'm sorry, stop)

I'm out of my cage, and I'm on the stage
I'm dying to give you a show
I'm alienated, way overrated
Here are a few of the notes

My fans are the best
They'd love me more dead
But man, I can't die 'til I finish the album
'Cause if I could time it right, shit could go Platinum
But baby, it's getting too loud

(Da-da-da, da-da-da-da)
(Da-da-da-da, da-da-da)

And everyone's freaking me out
I wake up and I'm up and I'm down
Yo, shut the fuck out of your mouth
Bite tongue 'til there's blood in my mouth
It freaks me out

(All of the ghosts of the earth became very unhinged)
(Otto get in the car, get back in the car)

I'm Miss Congeniality
Everybody's proud of me
But when they try and tell me
Volume's muted like they're sound asleep

Therapy's not working
I don't understand, so
I kill time playing tennis
With your favorite bands, we're singing

(Da-da-da, da-da-da-da)
(One more fucking time)

And everyone's freaking me out (woo)
I wake up and I'm up and I'm down
Yo, shut the fuck out of your mouth
Bite tongue 'til there's blood in my mouth (blah)
It freaks me out, it freaks me out

It gets real super dark around the edge of my heart
Around the edge of my heart
It gets real fucking dark around the edge of my heart
Around the edge of my heart
(Go) gets real super dark around the edge of my heart
Around the edge of my heart
It gets real fucking dark around the edge of my heart
Around the edge of my heart

(Otto don't be mad with us)
(I don't know, I don't know)
(Oh man, you don't look so good)
