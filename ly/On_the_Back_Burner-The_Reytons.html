		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All right, have you seen those lads?
There's a brand new band in town
Alright but they're not that good
Don't know what the hype's about

See me, I coulda made it big
I mean I really coulda been someone
I got a mate named Dave who moved to Spain
He could've had me on radio one
I'm tellin' ya

See me, I could've made it big
But you live with the choice you choose
The signal's shit but I'll show you later
Nearly got me a million views

He had to call it quit's
'cause he had two kids
So the dream went on the back burner
An everybody round here's got a
Cousin or a mate
Who's best friends with Alex Turner
I'm tellin' ya

Don't believe the hype

I'm a local hero at the open mic
I got songs that I writ, me sent
But there ain't many here
And I need more beer
Come and watch me at half past ten

'Cause they all go mad for the songs I sing
They all know that I shoulda took off
But when he gets on stage
And he starts to play
He's guaranteed that they'll all fuck off
I'm tellin' ya

Don't believe the hype
Don't believe the hype
