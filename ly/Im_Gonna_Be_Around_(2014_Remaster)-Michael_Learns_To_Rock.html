		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's been so long since we took the time 
To share the words 
From deep inside us 
We're in our own world spinning our wheels 
But you know how I feel 
Well since the first time I took your hand 
My love for you 
Has just been growing 
You always seem to understand 
You know how I am 

[Chorus :]
I'm gonna love you `till the end 
I'm gonna be 
Your very true friend 
I want to share your ups and downs 
I'm gonna be around 

When you're alone`coz I'm away 
Don't be sad 
Don't be afraid 
I'm gonna turn my thoughts to you 
Like I always do 

[Chorus:]

Catch you when you fall 
Hold you when you're down 
Sharing every moment 
I want to show you all I do 
I believe I found a miracle 
In you 

[Chorus:]
