		  Verse 1

I am bound to you
you hold me close without your touch
n I can never get enough
and every night
every night
I think of you / I’m missing you

I won’t lie to you
cuz I’ll do everything I can
to erase the hurt and pain
n every night
every night
I’ll be loving you


Chorus :

How many times do I have to tell you
I’ll hold the pieces of your broken heart
With my heart / With my own heart
I won’t leave
so Stay with me 

girl, close to mine
close to mine


Verse 2 :

I will vow to you
I know you’ve been there before 
Seen them all walk through the door
but if you’re mine
if you’re mine
I walk/ill stay/ill be next to you / you’ll find me next to you

In your eyes 
I see it too
you wanna try and love again
wanna kiss and dance through the rain
so let me try
I will try 
to love you back to life


Chorus :

How many times do I have to tell you
I’ll hold the pieces of your broken heart
With my heart / With my own heart
I won’t leave
so Stay with me 

girl, close to mine
close to mine
