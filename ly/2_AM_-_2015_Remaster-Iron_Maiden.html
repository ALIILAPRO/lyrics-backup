		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I get in from work at 2 AM
And sit down with a beer
Turn on the late night TV
And then I wonder why I'm here
It's meaningless and trivial
And it washes over me
And once again I wonder
Is this all there is for me

Here I am again
Look at me again
Here I am again
On my own
Trying hard to see
What there is for me
Here I am again
On my own

Life seems so pathetic
I wish I could leave it all behind
This canvas chair, this bed
These walls that fall in on my mind
Hold on for something better
That just drags you through the dirt
Do you just let go or carry on
And try to take the hurt

Here I am again
Look at me again
Here I am again
On my own
Trying hard to see
What there is for me
Here I am again
On my own

Oh
Here I am again
Look at me again
Here I am again
On my own
Trying hard to see
What there is for me
Here I am again
On my own

Here I am again
Look at me again
Here I am again
On my own
Trying hard to see
What there is for me
Here I am again
On my own

Alone again
Alone again
I'm here on my own
