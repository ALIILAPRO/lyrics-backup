		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ok, it's like, it's bitchin', fussin', cussin'

I used to love her but I had to kill her
I used to love her, oh yeah, but I had to kill her
I had to put her six feet under
And I can still hear her complain

I used to love her, oh yeah, but I had to kill her
I used to love her, ooh yeah, but I had to kill her
I knew I'd miss her so I had to keep her
She's buried right in my backyard
Oh yeah

Ooh yeah
Whoa-oh, yeah

I used to love her, but I had to kill her
I used to love her, ooh yeah, but I had to kill her
She bitched so much, she drove me nuts
And now I'm happier this way

Whoa-oh, yeah
Take it for what it is

(Sir)

I used to love her, but I had to kill her
I used to love her, ooh yeah, but I had to kill her
I had to put her six, ooh, feet under
And I can still hear her complain
