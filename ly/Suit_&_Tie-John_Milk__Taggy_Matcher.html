		  Oh
I be on my suit and tie, suit tied, suit tied
I be on my suit and tie, suit tied, suit
Can I show you a few things?
A few things, a few things, little baby, 'cause

I be on my suit and tie, suit tied, suit, check it
I be on my suit and tie, suit tied, suit
Let me show you a few things
Let me show you a few things

Wait a minute, you ready, KB?

I can't wait till I get you on the floor, good looking
My dance floor's so hot just like an oven
And oww, burned myself I just had to move it
It's so fire and it's all mine

Hey you know, we don't mind all the watchin' high
'Cause if they study close, real close, they might learn somethin'
She ain't nothin' but a little doozie when she dances
We're so fly tonight

And as long as I've got my suit and tie
I'mma leave it all on the floor tonight
And you got fixed up to the nines
Let me show you a few things (show you a few things)

All pressed up in black and white
And you dressed in that dress I like
Love is swinging in the air tonight
Let me show you a few things (show you a few things)

Let me show you a few things
Show you a few things about love (love)
Now we're in the swing of love
Let me show you a few things
Show you a few things about love, hey

Stop, let me get a good look at ya
Ooh, so cool, now I know why they call you a platinum
Oh, moves so sick got a hit and got a gold record
That's all right 'cause you're all mine

Oh, go on and show 'em why you're a big star
I guess they're just mad 'cause girl they wish they had it
Ooh, a good enough thriller, yeah you're a classic
And you're all mine, that's right

And as long as I've got my suit and tie
I'mma leave it all on the floor tonight
And you got fixed up to the nines
Let me show you a few things (show you a few things)

All pressed up in black and white
And you dressed in that dress I like
Love is swinging in the air tonight
Let me show you a few things (show you a few things)

Let me show you a few things
Show you a few things about love (love)
Now we're in the swing of love
Let me show you a few things
Show you a few things about love, hey

And as long as I've got my suit and tie
I'mma leave it all on the floor tonight
And you got fixed up to the nines
Let me show you a few things (show you a few things)

All pressed up in black and white
And you dressed in that dress I like
Love is swinging in the air tonight
Let me show you a few things (show you a few things)

Let me show you a few things,
Show you a few things about love, love
Let me show you a few things
Show you a few things about love, hey

Oh!
Oh!

Ba da da aah!
Ah, ooh ooh oh
Yeah yeah yeah
La la la
I said swing that thing, oh yeah
