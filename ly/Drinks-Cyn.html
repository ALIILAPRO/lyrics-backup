		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  He got mad, so I got drinks (drinks)
No, I'm not walking around in circles worried about what he thinks
Out with my friend, drinking a drink (drink)
Alexa knows the bartender so all the drinks are free (yeah)
He got mad, so I got drinks (drinks)
Yeah, some shit went down, so now I'm up for anything
Out with my friend, drinking a drink (drink)
I don't know what the problem is, I don't think it's me

First things first, yeah, I know it's a bummer
That's right, it started with one that turned into another
You know I won't fake it or keep it under cover
And with it all out in the open, I can be me again

Taking the band-aid and ripping it off
Wish that I could but I can't care at all
House made of cards and it's starting to fall
Does it feel like I'm sprinkling salt?

He got mad, so I got drinks (drinks)
No, I'm not walking around in circles worried about what he thinks
Out with my friend, drinking a drink (drink)
Alexa knows the bartender so all the drinks are free (yeah)
He got mad (so mad), so I got drinks (drinks) (some drinks)
Yeah, some shit went down, so now I'm up for anything
Out with my friend (my friend), drinking a drink (drink) (drink, drink)
I don't know what the problem is, I don't think it's me

Feeling like it's automatic
Everything is so dramatic
Silver screens and movie scenes
Don't make it so cinematic
Nothings ever picture perfect
Happy endings can be tragic
As soon as it's over I can be me again

Taking the band-aid and ripping it off (ripping it off)
Wish that I could but I can't care at all (care at all)
House made of cards and it's starting to fall
Does it feel like I'm sprinkling salt?

He got mad, so I got drinks (drinks) (some drinks)
No, I'm not walking around in circles worried about what he thinks
Out with my friend, drinking a drink (drink) (na-na-na-na)
Alexa knows the bartender so all the drinks are free (yeah)
He got mad (so mad), so I got drinks (drinks) (some drinks)
Yeah, some shit went down, so now I'm up for anything
Out with my friend, drinking a drink (drink)
I don't know what the problem is, I don't think it's me
