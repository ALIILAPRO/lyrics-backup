		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Climb on up into mama's bed, it's just us tonight
Don't need a book, just snuggle in
I'll tell you a story I wish I didn't have to say
About a girl who fought with all her heart
But still had to walk away

Once upon a time he loved me
Once upon a time I loved him too
It all fell apart in a moment
Lord, I wish it wasn't true
'Cause you deserve the perfect family
The fairytales you know so well
'Stead of sitting here listening to the story 
I wish I didn't have to tell (ooh)

Ooh ooh, ooh ooh

I know it's hard to see mama cry
But I promise you that we're all gonna be alright
I need you to know that you'll always be loved
You're the very best chapters in the story of us
And it goes

Once upon a time he loved me
Once upon a time I loved him too
It all fell apart in a moment
Lord, I wish it wasn't true
'Cause you deserve the perfect family
The fairytales you know so well
'Stead of sitting here listening to the story 
I wish I didn't have to tell

Now, it's time to pick up all these broken pieces
So that we can be the story we believe in

Once upon a time it was us three
Starting over, all brand new
Dreaming of the happy ending I always wanted for you
'Cause you deserve the perfect family
The fairytales you know so well
'Stead of sitting here listening to the story 
I wish I didn't have to tell

Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
The story, wish I didn't have to tell
