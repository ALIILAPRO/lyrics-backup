		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I cannot spend another night in this home
I close my eyes and take a breath real slow
The consequences if I leave 'em alone
But what's the difference when you beg for love?

'Cause I learned the blood's in the stream
Cannot see, oh
With the name that my father gave me
And take the face of the one

This is a wasteland, my only retreat
With heaven above you, there's hell over me

I met a girl who never looked so alone
Like sugar water in your mouth luke warm
She tied her cherry stem for me with her tongue
We fell in love and now we're both alone

'Cause I don't need any more friends
And another kiss like a fire on pavement
We'll burn it down to the end

Oh, oh
This is a wasteland, my only retreat
With heaven above you there's hell over me
The water is rising, the air is so clean.
And then for a second I feel fine
This is a wasteland, my only retreat

I waited all this night to what you say
I know it's hard, but who you are you to fall apart on me, on me

This is a waste land my only retreat
With heaven above you there's hell over me

'Cause this is a waste land my only retreat
With heaven above you there's hell over me
(Said) What about us well, what about me?
Came from the girl that's asleep in the rain
This is a waste land, my only retreat
