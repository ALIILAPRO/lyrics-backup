		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Send me the pillow that you dream on 
Don't you know that I still care for you? 
Send me the pillow that you dream on 
So darling, I can dream on it, too 

Each night while I'm sleeping oh, so lonely 
I'll share your love in dreams that once were true 
Send me the pillow that you dream on 
So darling, I can dream on it, too 

Send me the pillow that you dream on 
Maybe time will let our dreams come true 
Send me the pillow that you dream on 
So darling, I can dream on it, too 

I've waited so long for you to write me 
But just a memory's all that's left of you 
Send me the pillow that you dream on 
So darling, I can dream on it, too 

So I can dream on it, too
