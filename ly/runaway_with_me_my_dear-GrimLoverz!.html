		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take my hand and run
I can't give you up
Your love is enough
Your love is a drug
I done fell in love
Feening for your touch
Cause' baby you're my drug
And I can't live without
Your love is a diamond
Love the way you dancing in the dark
Grab my hand and let's runaway
Jump aboard yeah we're stowaways
Light a blunt now I float away
Do a line bitch I'm not okay
Don't go
Don't runaway
Don't go
Don't runaway
If you leave I won't survive
I don't wanna see you die
Love and drugs it will suffice
Baby yeah I love your eyes
Baby yeah I love your eyes
Don't go leaving me behind
I just need you by my side
I just need you here tonight
Take my hand and run
I can't give you up
Your love is enough
Your love is a drug
I done fell in love
Feening for your touch
Cause' baby you're my drug
And I can't live without
Your love is a diamond
Love the way you dancing in the dark
Grab my hand and let's runaway
Jump aboard yeah we're stowaways
Light a blunt now I float away
Do a line bitch I'm not okay
I'm not okay
