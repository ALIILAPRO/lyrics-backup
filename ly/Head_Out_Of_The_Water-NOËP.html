		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You kept my head out of the water 
I see your hand on a table
I lay down my armor
Feel safe now

You kept my head out of the water 
I feel my heart getting stronger 
Never felt any warmer
Is it too late now

I can't hold back, you make me smile 
Lend me your heart, I'll make it shine 
Everything 'bout you is so fine
I can't believe that you are mine
I can't hold back, you make me smile 
Lend me your heart, I'll make it shine 
Everything 'bout you is so fine
You kept my head out of the water

You kept my head out of the water 
I see your eyes, they're playful 
Made me feel so much calmer 
I cannot wait for tomorrow
Feel safe now

You kept my head out of the water 
I'm full of life I'm overflown
Never thought 'bout building a home 
I hope it's not too late now
I hope it's not too late, late now

I can't hold back, you make me smile
Lend me your heart, I'll make it shine 
Everything 'bout you is so fine
I can't believe that you are mine
I can't hold back, you make me smile (you kept my head out of the water)
Lend me your heart, I'll make it shine (I see your hand on a table) 
Everything 'bout you is so fine (I lay down my armor)
You kept my head out of the water
