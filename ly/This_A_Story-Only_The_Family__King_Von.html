		  Let me tell y'all a story
About
Two shawties
Two .40's

Late night he was creeping
Just a young hot shawty tryna kill for no reason
Heart colder than a freezer
He was raised in the jungle earned more stripes than a zebra

Auntie used to beat him
She was high off the C she ain't even used to feed him
And the teachers couldn't teach him
He said the words looked funny it was too hard to read em

Watch out he reaching, Boom!
One shot from the Glock nigga whole shit leaking
My fault he tweaking
Drug deal gone wrong big homie tried to cheat him

Don't touch him just leave him
Had his best friend with him lil' bro couldn't believe it
See he heard about the killings
But this first time seeing and he ain't even wanna see it
(Damn)

No more school
Shawty got a new Glock and he acting a fool
And he don't shoot pool
But he keep the stick on him he like what we finna do

Best friend be blue
But he down for whatever he just tryna look cool
And they was just on the news
Shawty head fucked up he got something to prove

Now shit getting real
Lil' folks getting high he just popped him a pill
Ooh, let's do a drill
That's what he told his best friend but his friend tryna chill

He said nah I'm cool
I'ma fall back today I got a bitch coming through
But you could do you
Pass little bro the keys, said the car by the school

You know shawty don't play
He hopped out right his seat put the Glock to his face
Aye bitch you acting gay
I just need you to drive I know where he stay

So now they en route
They pulled to the crib in the back of the house
He say shawty get out
After you catch this one you gon' have all the clout

Shawty don't trust him
Shawty say fuck him
Whole time shawty don't even know
This the same nigga killed his brother

See shawty is a sucker
He hopped out he say fuck it
He ran up and got to bustin'
He ain't even know he was shooting at his cousin
(Damn, damn)

Late night he was creeping
Just a young hot shawty tryna kill for no reason
Heart colder than a freezer
He was raised in the jungle earned more stripes than a zebra

Auntie used to beat him
She was high off the C she ain't even used to feed him
And the teachers couldn't teach him
He said the words looked funny it was too hard to read em

Watch out he reaching, boom!
One shot from the Glock nigga whole shit leaking
My fault he tweaking
Drug deal gone wrong big homie tried to cheat him

Don't touch him just leave him
Had his best friend with him lil' bro couldn't believe it
See he heard about the killings
But this first time seeing and he ain't even wanna see it
