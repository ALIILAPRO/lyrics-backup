		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Cry to sleep
Wait a week, 
Again. 
Ohhhh
Amen 
Counting sheep
Crossing streets
Everyone's dead ends 
Ohhh
Amen 
And I'm bored
I could me so much more than I am
Than I am
I need to go
I heard there's a place for me 
One that nobody knows 
One that goes away with me
So I drove
Mountains away
To place that ain't real
To a place that ain't real
And I drove
Mountains away
To a place that ain't real
That's where I wanna stay

that place over the hill,
where you dream about crossing
It's not a cry for help
To rethink your options 
It's your mom's bakery in Maine 
it's that cabin in Sweden 
It's the going offline
It's next year I'll go vegan 
It's not a woe is me
It's a hold the door open 
that's a fantasy world
that's the one that I've chosen

somewhere over the hill
Where you cry without speaking
Leave your door slightly creaking
It's all leaking away
When there's nothing to say
There's no point anymore
The words touch ur mouth
And they fall to the floor
So why try to move a hair
When you barely exist 
That's a fantasy world
That's where I wanna live

And I float
mountains away
where no one can stay
And I go,
not in a rush
