		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She got that look up in her eyes
Like a demon waits inside
She looks pretty in the light 
But a heathen when it's night
Yeah she gon' make you feel obsessed
Suck your soul right out your chest
Yeah I'm down to be possessed
Yeah I'm down to be possessed

Cuz she's a...heartbreaker, dream taker, love faker
Yeah you better watch out, cuz boy you're headed straight for danger
Cuz she's the player, you're the game
She's the slayer, you're the slayed

She likes to get freaky with it
But she ain't no easy ticket
She gon make you work to get it
She gon pack her purse to hit it
But once she lets you in
You'll be coming back again
Cuz she the type of girl that turns a mate into a jealous friend, uh 

She said break me
Like you hate me
I said slow down
She said make me...
Yeah she's a different breed
Her energy is all I need
Cuz she know just how to please 

She said choke me
Touch me like you know me
Leave the sheets soaking
Boy just grab me like you own me...
I'll fall in love for a night
cnd again in the light
Yeah she's something out a naughty book I'll be reading twice...  
Cuz I'm addicted
Body got me twisted
God this girl is gifted
Like a high vision vivid
When inside, I can't quit it 
Push it right to our limits 
Feel alive when we sinning... 

She got that look up in her eyes
Like a demon waits inside
She looks pretty in the light 
But a heathen when it's night
Yeah she gon' make you feel obsessed
Suck your soul right out your chest
Yeah I'm down to be possessed
Yeah I'm down to be possessed

Cuz she's a...heartbreaker, dream taker, love faker
Yeah you better watch out, cuz boy you're headed straight for danger
Cuz she's the player, you're the game
She's the slayer, you're the slayed

clways wanted something like this (x4)

She got those eyes
She got those lips
She got those legs 
She got those hips
She got a kink
Fetish itch
Treat her right
cnd she'll give...you everything you want
Everything you need
She was built to please 
On her knees 
What a perfect view
Baby pray to me 
Uhhh
She contagious in the dark
She was made, a piece of art
Got a shell that's thick and hard
It surrounds a blackened heart
Guess that's where she got her start
She could tear your soul apart
:
She got the fire inside her, uh
Devil on shoulder beside her, uh
Whispering telling her naughty things cuz he know just how to go and excite her, uh 
She wanna fill her desires, uh
Who would I be to deny her, uh
I'll take her anywhere she wanna go, yeah I'm ready to be her lone driver, uh 
She's bit by the craving
She wants a little tasting
Sinning hearts both racing, but synced up when we're laying
c slayer just slaying
She's a slayer just slaying
