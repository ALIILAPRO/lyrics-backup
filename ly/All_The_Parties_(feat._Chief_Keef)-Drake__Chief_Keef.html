		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ayy
Ayy, ayy
Grr

Yeah, Jason got money that glow in the dark
Hit up the dawg like I'm OVO Mark
Walk-in closet, got more Chrome than a Stark
Forty K a night to sleep at the Mark
Guess it's time for me to cover the shark
Me and KD 'bout to turn up the art
Fuck you hoes, I swear I'm breakin' your heart
It's broken
I bought the house just to knock that shit down
I bought the Rolls just to take it apart
She bought an ass, now she makin' it arch
Doctor's office was the last time that you niggas even had your name on a chart
Shawty graduated, playin' it smart (ayy, yeah)

Used to be a smarty
Used to wanna study, now she poppin' Addies
She at all the parties, T'd up with 3Hunna
She just did her body, she in love with Sosa
Girl, you such a thottie
Ayy, Sosa, baby

Used to be a smarty
Used to wanna study, now I drop the addy
And she at all the parties, T'd up with 3Hunna
Showin' off her body, she in love with Sosa
Girl, you such a thottie, ayy

Money on my mind, I'm rackin' my brain
Shout to Lil' Palestine, she with the gang
Shout to lil' A1 from Foxwell and Jane
Shout to lil' Izzy, she work as a stewardess
I should probably go and get her the Plain Jane
Free Baby M out the shackle and chain
Me, my evil twin, we one in the same
Shout to Machine from the Wood, free 17 from the Lane
R.I.P. Smoke, it's a shame, I'm bumpin' 'em all in the Range
I love all y'all niggas the same, I wish this was back in the day, for real
Forty deep in the East End
We call it swimmin' in the deep end
My bitches playin' PND and them
Them shorties don't listen to Weeknd
They archin' back and makin' knees bend
And they ain't graduate but they geekin'
And they live in a crib with a cheap rent, yeah
And I wish I could dead all the beefin'
And I wish I could dead all the dissin' deceased friends
I wish we could be friends
Probably sound like I'm preachin'
The city might sleep in some peace then
But it's not realistic
What's realistic is money that we spend
We coppin' cars like policemen
We heavy guys like obese men
I keep showin' love to the streets and
It's still three the guys 'til they free men, yeah, yeah
And it's 6ix side town, a dead end world
East End boys and West End girls, yeah
East End boys and West End girls, ayy

Used to be a smarty
Used to wanna study, now I send the addy
And she at all the parties, T'd up with 3Hunna
Showin' off her body, she in love with Sosa
Girl, you need a hobby

This is the starchild, a.k.a. DJ Pooper Scooper
What's on top of the house? Roof
What's in the top of your mouth? Roof
What's Babe name? Roof
What do a dog say? Roof
We comin' to tear the what off? Roof
They raise your tax, we raise the roof
