		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Would you mind
If I took the time to get to know you
'Cause it's been a while since all we've been through
And even though I said my feelings wouldn't change
Nothin' stays the same, ooh

I could see
When I look in your eyes you mean no harm
It's just the way you manipulate me with your charm
And I can tell the love I have for you's still strong
And there ain't nothing wrong with me still lovin' you

After all that we've been through (ooh)
I find myself still lovin' you (yeah)
But I think we need to take the time to get back
'Cause I never get up on a good thing
I never give up on the love we had (Ooh ooh)
We just need to take it slow

In the past
You would act as if you don't really care
You would fight and argue almost anywhere
Lookin' back sometimes I feel like such a fool
For puttin' up with you, boo

Baby, please
Understand me if it seems I'm confused
It's just it might take me some time to get used to you
When I things of all the things we used to do, baby
I just find myself still lovin' you

After all that we've been through (yeah)
I find myself still lovin' you (oh)
But I think we need to take the time to get back (no, no)
'Cause I never get up on a good thing
I never give up on the love we had (baby)
We just need to take it slow

I believe you and me have a chance to make this right
Oh, baby, if your heart is in it, I'm still with it
Even after all this time has passed
Oh, I'm still lovin' you

After all that we've been through (yeah)
I find myself still lovin' you (oh, yeah)
But I think we need to take the time to get back
'Cause I never get up on a good thing
I never give up on the love we had (baby)
We just need to take it slow

After all that we've been through (oh)
I find myself still lovin' you
But I think we need to take the time to get back
'Cause I never get up on a good thing (never give up)
I never give up on the love we had (yeah)
We just need to take it slow
