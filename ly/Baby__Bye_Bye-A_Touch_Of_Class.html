		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You say, you can't resist me
You say, you want me
Don't come around me
Don't try to tease me

You think, your love can drive me crazy
You think, I be your baby, don't fool me
I know what you're thinking

I swear, I love you honey
It's true, it's not just lying
Cause when I look in to your eyes,
I feel hypnotized

Ahiaia...

You can call me baby, baby bye bye
(bye bye)
I won't be by your side
You can call me honey, honey bye bye
(bye bye)
It's time to say goodbye
I just wanna have fun, take it deep in the sun
Ahiaia - Ahiaia

You dream, of you and me together
I think, you wait forever just leave me
You try to convince me

I swear, I love you honey
It's true, it's not just lying
Cause when I look in to your eyes,
I feel hypnotized

Ahiaia...

You can call me baby, baby bye bye
(bye bye)
I won't be by your side
You can call me honey, honey bye bye
(bye bye)
It's time to say goodbye
I just wanna have fun, take it deep in the sun
Ahiaia - Ahiaia

Baby, bye bye
Now it's time to leave you
Baby, bye bye
Now it's time to say goodbye
Baby, bye bye
Now it's time to leave you
Baby, bye bye
Now it's time to say goodbye

You can call me baby, baby bye bye
(bye bye)
I won't be by your side
You can call me honey, honey bye bye
(bye bye)
It's time to say goodbye
I just wanna have fun, take it deep in the sun
Ahiaia - Ahiaia

You can call me baby, baby bye bye
(bye bye)
I won't be by your side
You can call me honey, honey bye bye
(bye bye)
It's time to say goodbye
I just wanna have fun, take it deep in the sun
Ahiaia - Ahiaia

bye bye
