		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can tell
by the look in your eyes
somethin's missin'
(I can tell somethin's missin')
I know it's hard to say
what's really on your mind
(What's really on your mind-
girl what's really on your mind)
No matter what you say baby know
that I can listen
(You know that I am here - ah)
What can I do to get you through
and make you change your mind?
Console you control you
How can I decide?
Just to see you smile
do I let you go?
'Cause when I'm with you
you're not with me
I don't ever really want
to let you go
You could give your heart to
someone else
'Cause when you're with me
I am with you
Wishing you could find a way
to give me all
Instead of giving someone else
Given some time I really thought
I would forget you
(I thought I would forget you)
It's a mistake to think
that you are ever comin' back
(Comin' back to me,
never comin' back to me)
All of my empty
feelings turn to regret
(Turn into regret)
I just wanna call your name
and hear you say it back
Console me control me
What will you decide?
Going back to him
to get your love?
'Cause when I'm with you
you're not with me
I don't ever really want
to let you go
You could give your heart to
someone else
'Cause when you're with me
I am with you
Wishing you could find a way
to give me all
Instead of giving someone else
Every time that I was with you,
you didn't see me
I couldn't find
the Key to unlock your heart
I was lost
and I couldn't find my way
If the only way to you
is to say goodbye
To my love

'Cause when I'm with you
you're not with me
I don't ever really want
to let you go
You could give your heart to
someone else
'Cause when you're with me
I am with you
Wishing you could find a way
to give me all
Instead of giving someone else
Cause when I'm with you
You're not with me woo woo
Give your heart to someone else
