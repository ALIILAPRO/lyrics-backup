		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, one, one, two, three, four

Oh, I've got a sheet for my bed and a pillow for my head
I've got a pencil full of lead and some water for my throat
I've got buttons for my coat and sails on my boat
So much more than I needed before

I got money in the meter and a two bar heater
Oh, now it's getting hotter, oh, it's only getting sweeter
I got legs on my chairs and a head full of hair
Pot and a pan and some shoes on my feet

I got a shelf full of books and most of my teeth
A few pairs of socks and a door with a lock
I got food in my belly and a license for my telly
And nothing's gonna bring me down

Oh, no, oh
Oh nothin', oh nothin', nothin's gonna bring me down

I got a nice guitar and tires on my car
I got most of the means and scripts for the scenes
I'm out and about so I'm in with a shout
I got a fair bit of chat but better than that

Food in my belly and a license for my telly
And nothing's going to bring me down (how 'bout a brew and that hug, man?)

Nothin', oh, nothin'
Nothing's going to bring me down, oh

But best of all (best of all) I've got my baby
Oh, best of all (best of all) I've got my baby
She's mighty fine and says she's all mine
And nothing's going to bring me down, oh, no

Oh, best of all (best of all) I've got my baby
Oh, best of all (best of all) I've got my baby
She's mighty fine and says she's all mine
And nothing's going to bring me down, oh

She's mighty fine and says she's all mine
And nothing's going to bring me down
She's mighty fine and says she's all mine
And nothing's going to bring me down, not today, no, no
