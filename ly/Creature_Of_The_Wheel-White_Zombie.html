		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Alone against the world
Twist a reckless life, straight
Into the heart of the ripper,
Trick of treat my mind to
A rebel ride, Heldorado
Move like a monster 
Creature of the wheel 
Trigger wicked way,
Tangle like a web 
Beneath me

Ankle-deep in hell 
Through another way crucify 
The sky above me
New God kill machine 
And man say Lord of the 
Engines, yeah 
Pocket full of dirt, frozen 
In my hands, hold on to 
The nameless 
God yeah
Breathe 

Into the deep 
And dying light 
Of day, Overdose 
On bloody wings 
Splinter in the 
Skin turn your 
Eyes away, sick and 
Swaggering, beneath me
Revolution mind ye of 
Little faith
Rusty and dull
Cut me

New God kill machine 
And man say Lord 
Of the engines 
And O' brothers and sisters
I ask you to look at him. Does 
He have the marks? Do you see 
Them? NO. 

Demon-paper clowns
Stitched across my back
Easygoing dead black eyes
Microscopic giants on a chicken
Run, Everybody dies laughing 
Thrust into the drag on the 
Edge and wait Motivate the one 
Inside you Bastard kicker burn 
Blow the ash away, Heldorado 
Gonna get you, get you
Get you, get you
