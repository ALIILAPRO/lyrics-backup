		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let me tell you your fortune
It could be sinister or maybe not
Like a leopard, can't change its own spots

Ride a moon beam
Sail the starlight
A blaze in the night sky
See the witch's flight

Caught in a witch's spell
Got a tale to tell
Caught in a witch's spell
Got a tale to tell
Caught in a witch's spell

Good time maker who likes it hot
Like a card playin' shark, who takes the whole lot
And that's a lot

Ride a moonbeam
Sail the starlight
A blaze in the night sky
See the witch's flight

Caught in a witch's spell
Got a tale to tell
Caught in a witch's spell
Got a tale to tell
Caught in a witch's spell

It's all coming to ya
It's all coming through ya
I get bathed in a light
The spell's just right

Caught in a witch's spell
Got a tale to tell
Caught in a witch's spell
Got a tale to tell
Caught in a witch's spell

Crystal balls and an almanac
She gonna take you to hell and back
I've got potions, snake oil style
Good luck charms and a witch's spell
