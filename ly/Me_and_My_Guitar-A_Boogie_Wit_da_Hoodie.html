		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, I loved her too hard, she left me here with this guitar
You can try stealing my heart, it's already gone
You can tell something is wrong, just leave me alone
I don't even know where to start, I'm just done
Used to being in my room with you
Now you're gone, I only see you through a phone now, where did you go?
I should've never told you leave me alone, I guess you took it to the heart
Yeah, let's go

It's just me and this guitar, playing this song
You can try stealing my heart, it's already gone
You can tell something is wrong, just leave me alone
I don't even know where to start, I'm just done
Used to being in my room with you, now you're gone
I only see you through a phone now, where did you go?
I should've never told you, "Leave me alone"
I guess you took it to the heart when I said, "Leave me a"

Sweat going down to my balls, I'm having withdrawals
It's crazy baby, all of my scars shaped in hearts
Lamborghini Urus, Ferraris, extra cars
If you start bringing up love, I'm bringing my gun
I never knew I'd make it this far, it feels bizarre
But you know my energy large, like a Quran
And you know I work too hard, I came too far
I'm happy I'm still alive
'Cause half of my niggas they either died or in the system
Then if I ain't start rapping I swear to God I'd have been with them
I baguetteed out my watches, I'm a timeless ass nigga
I was creepin' on the low, yeah, I'm a doggy ass nigga
But I'm an honest nigga, I can only lie when it comes to snitchin'
I hold grudges with my bitches, if you lie I won't forgive you
Just don't go tell nobody about those times that I was with you
You got my shoulder to lean on if you wanna cry, fuck a tissue
In and out of love so many fucking times, I don't get it
I could get on some gangsta shit, then turn the vibe sentimental
You say you front on my nigga and he ain't ride, wrong nigga
Swear it's way too many hoes to be dying over bitches 
Yeah, let's go

It's just me and this guitar, playing this song
You can try stealing my heart, it's already gone
You can tell something is wrong, just leave me alone
I don't even know where to start, I'm just done
Used to being in my room with you, now you're gone
I only see you through a phone now, where did you go?
I should've never told you, "Leave me alone"
I guess you took it to the heart when I said, "Leave me a"

I lost her heart, she left me here with this guitar
So if you plan on stealing my heart, it's already gone
You can tell something is wrong, just leave me alone
'Cause I don't even know where to start, I'm just done
Used to being in my room with you, now you're gone
I only see you through a phone now, where did you go?
