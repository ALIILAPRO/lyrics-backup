		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Today was a pretty day
No disappointments
No expectations on your whereabouts
And oh, did I let you go?
Did it finally show
That strange things will happen if you let them?

Today I didn't even try to hide
I'll stay here and never push things to the side
You can't reach me 'cause I'm way beyond you today

Today was a pretty day
Autumn comes with
These slight surprises where your life might twist and turn
Hope to unlearn
Strange things will happen
If you let them come around and stick around

Today I didn't even try to hide
I'll stay here and never push things to the side
You can't reach me 'cause I'm way beyond you today

Today I didn't even try to hide
I'll stay here and never push things to the side
Today I didn't even look to find
Something to put me in that peace of mind
You can't touch me 'cause I'm way beyond you today
