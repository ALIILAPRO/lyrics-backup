		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I ain't one to hide my stupid and my stubborn
I won't lie about the ally's where I've been
I won't ever try to cover all the lies that pulled me under
Nearly buried in a box of my own sin
And this freedom that I've found is not a platform
For me to boast in anything that I have done
It's just a messy canvas, of God's mercy in my madness
And a fiery love that I could not outrun
I find no glory in my story
All the times I ran away
And I'm not proud of where I've been
All the choices that I've made
But if my past is now your present
I'm prayin' you see how
There's an unrelenting, comin' for you Savior
Who loves chasing rebels down
When it comes to failure, you're no different
When it comes to shame, you're not alone
From prodigals on barstools to pretenders in the church pews
Nobody's ever really too far gone
I find no glory in my story
All the times I ran away
And I'm not proud of where I've been
All the choices that I've made
But if my past is now your present
I'm prayin' you see how
There's an unrelenting, comin' for you Savior
Who loves chasing rebels down
(He's coming for you) He's coming for you
(He's coming for you) He's coming for you
(He's coming for you) He's coming for you
(He's coming for you) He's coming for you
(He's coming for you) He's coming for you
(He's coming for you) oh (He's coming for you, He's coming for you)
Hell couldn't stop Him (He's coming for you)
Darkness couldn't hide Him (He's coming for you)
He's coming for you (He's coming for you)
He is for you
I find no glory in my story
All the times I ran away
And I'm not proud of where I've been
All the choices that I've made
But if my past is now your present
I'm prayin' you see how
There's an unrelenting, comin' for you Savior
There's an unrelenting, comin' for you Savior
Who loves chasing rebels down
