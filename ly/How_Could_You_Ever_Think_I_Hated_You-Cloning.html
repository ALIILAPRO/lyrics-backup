		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The night bus drove behind my old school
Shone lights on broken tiles and cracked paint
Tell me have I changed?

Well memories blur like rumours these days
So I stayed up late to comb through my brain
Wallow in my ways

How could you ever think I hated you?
Slipped and fell was feeling shades of blue
Darker than the deepest swimming pool
Beneath the surface watched as you withdrew

How could you ever think I hated you?
Nervous kid not much has changed since school
Gin half mixed I never had a clue
When I held back I wasn't there for you

Goodbyes we never said on your porch
Like apologies that always fell short
Living in remorse

And when your eyes flickered and closed
I wish I had known
That the blame this whole time was under my nose
Wasn't helping
I Wasn't helping

How could you ever think I hated you?
Slipped and fell was feeling shades of blue
Darker than the deepest swimming pool
Beneath the surface watched as you withdrew

How could you ever think I hated you?
Nervous kid not much has changed since school
Gin half mixed I never had a clue
When I held back I wasn't there for you

How could you ever think I hated you?
Slipped and fell was feeling shades of blue
Darker than the deepest swimming pool
When I held back I wasn't there for you
