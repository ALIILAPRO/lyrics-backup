		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My heart is burning,
I used to trust somebody
Who was a social climber
Keep your fake friendship
Money was all you wanted
Pretending to my homie
I'm done pretending
Someone i'm not
You'd better run from me
You'd better run from me
I'm done pretending
Someone i'm not
You'd better run from me
You'd better run from me
How many people wants to be a star
They will do anything just to social climb
But i'm not like one of them
They play pretend and keep on saying
Wish i had friends with money and fame
All i wanna do is stop being so lame
I don't wanna be lonely
I don't wanna be lonely
We don't need friends with money and fame
'Cause all they wanna do is get high and pretend
If you wanna be lonely
Welcome to the outcast clique
The town is burning
I'm not faking up my smile
Don't try to call me
I'm not returning your calls
I'm done pretending
Someone i'm not
You'd better run from me
You'd better run from me
I'm done pretending
Someone i'm not
You'd better run from me
You'd better run from me
How many people wants to be a star
They will do anything just to social climb
But i'm not like one of them
They play pretend and keep on saying
Wish i had friends with money and fame
All i wanna do is stop being so lame
I don't wanna be lonely
I don't wanna be lonely
We don't need friends with money and fame
'Cause all they wanna do is get high and pretend
If you wanna be lonely
Welcome to the outcast clique
Outcast
Well i'm an outcast
Well i'm an outcast
I'm an outcast
'Cause i'm an outcast
Don't mess with me
I'm an outcast
Don't mess with me
I'm an outcast
Don't mess with me
Don't mess with me
Don't mess with me
Don't mess with me
Don't mess with me
No, don't mess with me
Don't mess with me
I'm an fucking outcast
Wish i had friends with money and fame
All i wanna do is stop being so lame
I don't wanna be lonely
I don't wanna be lonely
We don't need friends with money and fame
'Cause all they wanna do is get high and pretend
If you wanna be lonely
Welcome to the outcast clique
