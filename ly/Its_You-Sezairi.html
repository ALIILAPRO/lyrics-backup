		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here we are under the moonlight
I'm the one without a dry eye
'Cause you look amazing
I'm sorry for whatever I've caused
Before today I knew I felt lost
But now you're my lady

So take my hand now, see me
'Cause you've made me into this man
I promise I'll treasure you, girl
You're all that I've needed
Completing my world

You
You're my love, my life, my beginning
And I'm just so stoked I got you
Girl, you are the piece I've been missing
Remembering now

All the times I've been alone, showed me the way
Led me here, led me home
Right through that door straight to you
You're my love, my life, my beginning
It's you

Someone needs to come and pinch me now
I just can't believe what I have found
Standing here by me
Giving me the greatest gift you can
Saying yes and now our life begin
Choosing you daily

So take my hand now, see me
'Cause you've made me into this man
I promise I'll treasure you, girl
You're all that I've needed (all that I need)
Completing my world

You
You're my love, my life, my beginning
And I'm just so stoked I got you
Girl, you are the piece I've been missing
Remembering now

All the times I've been alone, showed me the way
Led me here, led me home
Right through that door straight to you
You're my love, my life, my beginning
It's you

I will never give up on you, girl
Treat you right every night
Make my move, just for you
Wanna do, do this right

You
You're my love, my life, my beginning
And I'm just so stoked I got you
Girl, you are the piece I've been missing
Remembering now

All the times I've been alone, showed me the way (you showed me)
Led me here, led me home
Right through that door straight to you
You're my love, my life, my beginning
It's you
