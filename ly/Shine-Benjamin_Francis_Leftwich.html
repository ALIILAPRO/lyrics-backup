		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (E/Parthenon Huxley)
Tarot cards
Said I'm already dead
Crystal ball
Fell down onto my head
Tenderness
If I want it I pay
My true love
Well she threw it away
CHORUS
But I can shine it all on
I can shine it all on
I can shine it all on
And still be amazed
Had some money
And a hole in my pocket
Had a house
But I forgot to lock it
Took a drag
>From a smoke that may kill me
What a drag
How the winter wind chills me
CHORUS
I'll shine it on just like MacBeth
In the face of certain death
Of a salesman or a king
And when the palm trees are on fire
I'll take my boat out on the sea
Had a face
But I never could save it
Hada kid
But I never would name it
Have a life
Well, that's what they call it
It's a road
But I guess I could crawl it
CHORUS
