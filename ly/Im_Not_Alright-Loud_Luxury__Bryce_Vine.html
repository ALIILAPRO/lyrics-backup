		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You like to drink and to smoke to take away the pain
And I don't remember all of my mistakes
And every high got low with no one to blame
You're not alright, I'm not alright

XO
When I'm high in the shade and I'm feelin' a way
Baby, hello
I just wanted to see if your plans ever change
You're my XO
Gotta fight for the love, what a rush and I don't want to let go
So don't let me go

Got no patience, conversation drivin' you up the wall
I'm imperfect, you're a goddess, no sarcasm at all
You say you're sorry, but don't know what you're sorry for, no
No point in keeping the score

You like to drink and to smoke to take away the pain
And I don't remember all of my mistakes
And every high got low with no one to blame
You're not alright, I'm not alright

You're not alright, I'm not alright
I like to drink and to smoke to take away the pain
And you don't remember all of your mistakes
And when our hearts aren't broke, they're out of place
You're not alright, I'm not alright

Let's roll
You and I don't belong in a place like this
Baby, let's roll
We don't need to believe everything they think
When it's all so, uh
Headed down that road and you don't gotta go down solo
No, don't let me go

Got no patience, conversation drivin' you up the wall
I've been perfect, you're a goddess, no sarcasm at all
You say you're sorry, but don't know what you're sorry for, no
No point in keeping the score

You like to drink and to smoke to take away the pain
And I don't remember all of my mistakes
And every high got low with no one to blame
You're not alright, I'm not alright

You're not alright, I'm not alright
I like to drink and to smoke to take away the pain
And you don't remember all of your mistakes
And when our hearts aren't broken, they're out of place
You're not alright, I'm not alright
