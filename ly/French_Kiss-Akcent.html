		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She comes to class at half past seven
Me and the boys think she's heaven
Mademoiselle Angelina French will teach
And we know it very well she's a little bitch
But I know
From the class I'm the one that will pass

'Cause every time she's teaching we go "C'est la vie!"
Her lesson is french kissing and she's kissing me
"Voulez-vous" she's singing I said let it be
If anybody's asking "C'est la vie!" [Repeat: x 2]

I turn eighteen and she is thirty
But she is hot and I am naughty,
Mademoiselle Angelina french will teach
And we know it very well she's a little bitch
But I know
From the class I'm the one that will pass.

'Cause everytime she's teaching we go "C'est la vie!"
Her lesson is french kissing and she's kissing me
"Voulez-vous" she's singing I said let it be
If anybody's asking "C'est la vie!" [Repeat: x 8]
