		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm the invisible man
I'm the invisible man
Incredible how you can
See right through me

(Freddie Mercury)
When you hear a sound
That you just can't place
Feel somethin' move
That you just can't trace
When something sits
On the end of your bed
Don't turn around
When you hear me tread

I'm the invisible man
I'm the invisible man
Incredible how you can
See right through me
I'm the invisible man
I'm the invisible man
It's criminal how I can
See right through you

I'm in your room
And I'm in your bed
And I'm in your life
And I'm in your head
Like the CIA
Or the FBI
You'll never get close
Never take me alive

I'm the invisible man
I'm the invisible man
Incredible how you can
See right through me
I'm the invisible man
I'm the invisible man
It's criminal how I can
See right through you

Hah, hah, hah, hello
Hah, hah, hah, okay
Hah, hah, hah, hello hello hello hello
Never had a real good friend, not a boy or a girl
No one knows what I've been through, let my flag unfurl
So make my mark from the edge of the world
From the edge of the world
From the edge of the world

Now I'm on your track
And I'm in your mind
And I'm on your back
But don't look behind
I'm your meanest thought
I'm your darkest fear
Put I'll never get caught
You can't shake me, shake me dear

I'm the invisible man
I'm the invisible man
Incredible how you can
See right through me (watch me)
I'm the invisible man
I'm the invisible man
It's criminal how I can
See right through you
Look at me, look at me

Shake me, shake me, shake me dear
