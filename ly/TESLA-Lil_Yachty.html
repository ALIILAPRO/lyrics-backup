		  Us

I ain't goin' back and forth with that nigga
He ain't even made no millions
We keep on droppin' the block, it's a real reason
Back and forth, back and forth 'til it ain't even
'Til it ain't easy, seek help immediately
Go, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Gas him up and get him killed
My bitch spoiled like the milk
He get tough, on four pill, he get killed
Send the bitch home, actin' goofy, my cup spilled
Bitch, you for real?
'Kay, go
Bitch, we the new Beatles, shoot a film, Regal
In the air, eagle, I don't want it if it's legal

Throw back this Tesla, throw back that mm-mm (grr)
Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm (grr)
Mm-mm, mm-mm

Yeah, I just wanna taste it
This lil' bitch my ace
Dawg, he servin' anywhere, even army bases
Ain't gotta like me, they just gotta face it
You came in all jaded, flashy bitch, I hate it (geek)
Step, huh, geeked up, geeked, move
Keep the top, made the opps frown
Switch sound like, "Frr-frr", in the background (hey)

Throw back this Tesla, throw back that mm-mm (grr)
Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm (grr)
Mm-mm, mm-mm

I can't lie, girl, I'm high (mm)
Fuckin' up a set, and my wrist in the sky
Gangster on the 'net, in real life that won't fly
I can show you how to get them M's DIY (yeah)
Put her on the spot, no time to be shy
There he go, there he is, beat that boy (mm)
Beat that boy (mm), beat that boy, beat that boy
Chill, chill

Hey, throw back this Tesla, throw back that mm-mm (grr)
Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm (grr)
Mm-mm, mm-mm
