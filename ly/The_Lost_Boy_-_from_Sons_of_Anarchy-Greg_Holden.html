		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I left my home still as a child
I walked a thousand sorry miles
To wait for my father, to gather up his tools

He said my boy you've got to run
Don't wait for me, don't wait for mum
We'll come get you, when it's safe for us to move

So I waited many years,
Held back the pain behind my tears
For my father, to come find me like he said

And in that time I was alone,
So many years without my home
I made brothers of a different kind instead

And at the time I didn't know,
Just how hard the wind could blow
Towards disaster, and the things that I would see

I never found my father,
I never found my mother
Even would I know in my lifetime I will be

A hero into the masses,
To those born without chances
There's a freedom that everyone deserves

I know there's greed and there's corruption
I've seen death and mass destruction
But I'm telling you, and I hope that I'm heard

I will not be commanded,
I will not be controlled
And I will not let my future go on,
Without the help of my soul

And I will not be commanded,
And I will not be controlled
And I will not let my future go on,
Without the help of my soul

And I will not be commanded,
And I will not be controlled
And I will not let my future go on,
Without the help of my soul

I will not be commanded,
I will not be controlled
And I will not let my future go on,
Without the help of my soul
