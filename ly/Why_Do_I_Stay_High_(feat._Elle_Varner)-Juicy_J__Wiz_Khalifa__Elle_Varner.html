		  Kamai, what's papa's rapper name?
Juicy J
Thank you, baby
(Why do I stay high?)
Ayy, mane, we just in the studio, you know what I'm saying? (Why do I stay high?)
Finished mixing the album (wy do I stay high?)
Finna pour up (why do I stay high?)
It's the last song we're recording (why do I stay high?)
Dedicated to the stoners, yeah (why do I stay high?)
(Why do I stay high?) Light up
(Why do I stay high?) Yeah, yeah, yeah

Roll another one, I be smoking like I'm Jamaican
Enough to go around but this one, I just gotta face it
Me and Mary Jane be together like we're related
Might not wanna try to keep up with me, you should pace it
Smoking Moon Rock in the back of my spaceship
Mix it with the Sherbet and Birthday Cake, you should taste it
Like a candle, I stay lit
Got the whole party faded
I woke up at the party and don't even know how I made it
It's just me and Jane, she help me ease the pain
I'm just like a torch, 'cause I keep the flame
If I don't do nothin', I'ma get high
You lookin' for me? Check the sky

Why do I stay high?
Why do I stay high?
Why do I stay high?
Why do I stay high?
Why do I stay high?
Why do I stay high?
Why do I stay high?
Why do I stay high?

In the Bay smoking KK with Berner
If it ain't in a joint, I don't burn it
You ain't gang or the Planes, I don't serve you
You talkin' like the feds, make me nervous
Don't even talk to me 'bout Cookies 'cause we grow that
Got a pound the other day, smoked the whole pack
I TS'd on your bitch soon as I came in
I'ma keep it 100, I just can't bend
Rollin' up dope
She hit it once, she gon' choke
Ain't never been on a boat
I got the game from my folks
Smokin' on all of this KK and the Morning Mimosas
I fuck your bitch then I'm ghost
Snapchat, I'm deletin' the post, gang, gang, gang

Why do I stay high?
Why do I stay high?
Why do I stay high?
Why do I stay high?
Why do I stay high?
Why do I stay high?
Why do I stay high?
Why do I stay high?
