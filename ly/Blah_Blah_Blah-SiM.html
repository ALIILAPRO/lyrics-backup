		  Oh na na na, oh na na na na
Oh na na na, oh na na na na
Oh na na na, oh na na na na
Blah blah fucking blah blah
Here comes the pain!

Try to bring me down
With your wild imagination
You can't even be one of my enemies
Ignorant hothead, it's a misspelling
WTF is "FUCK YOU"?

Oh na na na, it's just virtual conversation
Oh na na na
But it's the healing of our nation
Oh na na na, imitation of imitation
Oh, blah blah blah blah blah!

Oh na na na, oh na na na
Graphics and keys are all in my head
Oh na na na, oh na na na
Let every word out of your head
Don't be a dead in your life time
Our life ain't lighter than a dime!
Ah, hit the keys with a empty mind
Nothing comes from nothing

Leave a flood of information
And trust your intuition
Internet space of four dimensions
Creates an illusion

Oh na na na, it's just virtual conversation
Oh na na na
But it's the healing of our nation
Oh na na na, imitation of imitation
Oh, blah blah blah blah blah!

Oh na na na, oh na na na
Graphics and keys are all in my head
Oh na na na, oh na na na
Let every word out of your head
Don't be a dead in your life time
Our life ain't lighter than a dime
Ah, hit the keys with a empty mind
Nothing comes from nothing

Get down! they never see us
It's not the same as being under pressure
Some of them call it doom
Some of them call it bloom yeah'

I gotta go where no one knows
Graphics are all in my head
You gotta go where no one knows
Let the words out of your head

Oh na na na, it's just virtual conversation
Oh na na na
But it's the healing of our nation
Oh na na na, imitation of imitation
Oh, blah blah blah blah blah!

Oh na na na, oh na na na
Graphics and keys are all in my head
Oh na na na, oh na na na
Let every word out of your head
Don't be a dead in your life time
Our life ain't lighter than a dime
Ah, hit the keys with a empty mind
Nothing comes from nothing

Do something to free yourself
Stop wasting your time!

TICK TICK TACK
