		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In the world there are so many
Baby girl, you are that one
I deserve that I deserve you

I'll do anything that you say, anything
Cause you the boss
You the boss
You, you, you the boss, yeah
You the boss (uh)
You, you, you the boss, yeah
You the boss
You, you, you the boss, yeah (uh)
You the boss
You, you, you the boss (boss)
You the boss (boss)
You, you, you the boss, yeah
You the boss
You, you, you the boss, yeah
You the boss
You, you, you the boss, yeah

Rozay a born stunner, I could blow money
Fifty when I'm shopping, that ain't no money
I got my jeans sagging, money stuffed in em
I got 40 whips, way too much in em
I need me a queen, I need me a dime
Living this fast life just show me a sign
I'm a G, I'm-I'm-I'ma a G
Took her from the lame, put her on that condo on the beach
All she needs, all-all-all she needs
Is a boss on my level who provides every need
All I fiend is a queen in my presence
I can hold her til I die
Couple G's in my bezel
I'm a boss

I'll do anything that you say, anything
Cause you the boss
You the boss
You, you, you the boss, yeah
You the boss (uh)
You, you, you the boss, yeah
You the boss
You, you, you the boss, yeah (uh)
You the boss
You, you, you the boss (boss)
You the boss (boss)
You, you, you the boss, yeah
You the boss
You, you, you the boss, yeah
You the boss
You, you, you the boss, yeah

Still running the streets cause every day I'm hustling
Double MG winnin and the streets is loving it
All this paper coming and my baby touching it
I pin her to the wall, you know this, boy we busting it
Fur coats in the winter, look like a polar bear
Stunning in the snow, these haters they can go somewhere
Indoor pool, outdoor pool, indoor court
Talkin' Ray J moves
Seven Rolls Royces, pink slips like a boss
Champagne on her body, time to lick it off
Me and baby girl a winning combination
Ownership is my conversation
I'm a boss

I'll do anything that you say, anything
Cause you the boss
You the boss
You, you, you the boss, yeah
You the boss (uh)
You, you, you the boss, yeah
You the boss
You, you, you the boss, yeah (uh)

I watch
You play (what you sayin' baby)
And I'll do whatever you say (boss)
Oh I I I I I watch
You play
And I'll do
Whatever you say

I'd do anything that you say (uh), anything
Cause you the boss
You the boss (boss)
You, you, you the boss, yeah
You the boss
You, you, you the boss, yeah
You the boss
You, you, you the boss, yeah (boss)

You could take it any way you want to
Baby I promise that I'll never disappoint you
Just make sure I make it my motherfucking point to
Get a raise, get a raise
