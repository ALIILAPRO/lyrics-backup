		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh, I put bitches on and they turned on me
They throw that pussy at me, then throw dirt on me
But, I know bitches change, so, I'm used to it
And, I'm stuck up in my ways, so, I get like this
When I hit it from the back, you turn your back on me
You turn your back on me
Why you turn your back on me?
You turn your back on me, think that's why I act like this
That's why I act like this
Think that's why I act like this
That's why I act like this

That's why I act up
Stunt hard, act a ass, bitch, don't test me
You know I'ma cut class, bitch, I go hard
Leave the past in the past, huh
She say I'ma end up by myself, but I ain't mad 'bout it
I brought hoes in here
I brought drugs and hoes in here
I see my five in here, he told me my slime in here
R.I.P., 'cause the Percocet got nigga restin' in pieces
Ooh, I bust on the shit and her breasts, she gon' wear it and eat it
Ooh, I put the dope dick on her bestie, they sharin' a needle
Ooh, I play with her clit like a tech 'til my fingers are bleedin'
Uh, I smell all of the lies on her breath when she tell me she need me

Uh, I put bitches on and they turned on me
They throw that pussy at me, then throw dirt on me
But, I know bitches change, so, I'm used to it
I'm stuck up in my ways, so, I get like this
Hit it from the back, she turn your back on me
She turned her back on me
Why you turn your back on me?
You turn your back on me, think that's why I act like this
That's why I act like this
Think that's why I act like this
That's why I act like this (uh)

I'm so careful, but, today, I can care less
Beat my chest
She so bashful, but she made me squeeze her neck
Held her breath
She's so carin', but, tonight she just don't care for her
So unwell, when and where? We might go there, we need air
I won't hurt you, I won't hurt you, it's a virtue, and I'm too weak to wait
If I hurt you, I reimburse you

Uh, I put bitches on and they turned on me
They throw that pussy at me then throw dirt on me
But, I know bitches change, so, I'm used to it
You got me stuck up in my ways like glue, lil' bitch
I hit it from the back, she turned her back on me
She turned her back on me
Why you turn your back on me?
You turn your back on me, think that's why I act like this
That's why I act like this
Think that's why I act like this
That's why I act like this
Think that's why I act up
