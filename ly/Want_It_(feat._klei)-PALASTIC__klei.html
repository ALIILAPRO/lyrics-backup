		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You always wear the same old jeans
You always lay in your routine
You always have the same daydream
Seeing how you light up
But then you wake up

You've got to believe me
Let's not take it slow
We can make it feel so easy
I can show you how
It's safe to stick to what you know
We can make it feel so easy
I can show you how

Uncontrolled
Can't pick up, you know you want it
Don't say no
Can't pick up, you know you want it
Uh uh uh, uh uh uh 
Can't pick up, you know you want it
You want it, you want it, you want it
Uh uh uh 
Uh uh uh 
Uh uh uh 
Uh uh uh 
You want it (uh uh uh , uh uh uh )
You want it, you want it (uh uh uh , uh uh uh )
Uh uh uh 
Uh uh uh 

You always meet the same old friends
You always dance the same old dance
You always dream of being free
Seeing how you light up
But then you wake up

You've got to believe me
Let's not take it slow
We can make it feel so easy
I can show you how
It's safe to stick to what you know
We can make it feel so easy
I can show you how

Uncontrolled
Can't pick up, you know you want it
Don't say no
Can't pick up, you know you want it
Uh uh uh, uh uh uh 
Can't pick up, you know you want it
You want it, you want it, you want it
Uh uh uh 
Uh uh uh 
Uh uh uh 
Uh uh uh 
Uh uh uh 
You want it (uh uh uh, uh uh uh )
Uh uh uh 
Uh uh uh 

Uncontrolled
Can't pick up, you know you want it
Don't say no
Can't pick up, you know you want it

Uncontrolled
Can't pick up, you know you want it
Don't say no
Can't pick up, you know you want it
