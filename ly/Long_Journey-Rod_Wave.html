		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mhm
Look, look

Rollin' up back to back, got the smoke in my lungs
Young nigga on the block with his hand on his gun (grrah)
One up top, 'cause they prepared where I'm from
Let your nuts drop, you can't be scared where I'm from
Fast forward, grandma, pray for your baby (pray for your baby)
Mama, look at your son, I finally made it
That rap shit you hated takin' me places
My life been so crazy, just a lil' teenager
I never thought that I could take it from out of my hood
I know they thought I was crazy, just misunderstood (misunderstood)
I swear I love goin' on tour, the feelin' is good
If I could wrap my arms around this memory, man, I would
'Cause when I'm fresh off the road, my heart start breakin'
I don't know where to go, young, rich, lost, and famous
I'm in love with miss lady, but I just can't take it
Every day, I been prayin' I become more patient
And I know the sayin', more money, more problems, nah
More money, more people with they money problems lookin' for you to solve 'em
But I thank God for the dough, tell 'em fifty for a show
And I see niggas hatin', but God watchin'
Gotta stay prayed up, my God got me
Life ain't easy, but every day, it's a blessing
This life that I'm living, sometimes it's wild and hectic (yes, it is)
It's hectic, but-

Dear God, I thank You for (I thank You)
Everything You gave to us, uh
You kept them devils away from us, uh
And You finally made a way for us, so I say
Dear God, I thank You for (I thank You)
Everything You gave to us, uh
You kept them devils away from us, uh
And You finally made a way for us, I say

You finally made a way (yeah, yeah)
Finally made a way, yeah, finally made a way
Finally made a way, You finally made a way
Finally made a way, You finally made a way, yeah
(Finally made a way, made a way, made a way)
Uh, yeah, yeah
(Dear God, I thank you for)
And I finally made a way
I come from nothin', you heard me?
So much come with this shit, but (thank You, God, for makin' a way for us)
I take everything that come with this shit, man, young nigga, man (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And I'ma still get this paper, you know?
You hate me, then fuck you (finally made a way for me)
Grrah (finally made a way)
(F-Finally made a way)

Dear God, I thank You for (finally made a way)
Everything You gave to us (finally made a way)
You kept them devils away from us (finally made a way)
And You finally made a way for us, so I say (finally made a way)
Dear God, I thank You for
Everything You gave to us
You kept them devils away from us (kept them devils away)
And You finally made a way for us (kept them devils away)
Dear God, I thank you for (oh, thank you, Lord)
Everything you gave to us (thank You, God, for giving us everything)
You kept them devils away from us (everything we need)
And You finally made a way for us, so I say
Dear God, I thank you for
Everything You gave to us, uh
You kept them devils away from us, uh
And You finally made a way for us (oh)
