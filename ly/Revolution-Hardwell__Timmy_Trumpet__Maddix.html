		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A revolution
A revolution

For the new generation
There's been no ultimate seduction
We needed to stay underground
Millions hidden from the energy of the sun
Youngsters that would finally venture into the abyss
In the sea of people creating a giant wave with their hands

To feel that techno is the true meaning of trance
But the entire earth being has been surviving instead of thriving
All those souls without their connection and flirtation with sin
Now the time has come to feel the spirit of house music

The gates of life are opening again
And the summer of love is upon us
We are in this together
Freedom, diversity, unity, love and revolution
A revolution
