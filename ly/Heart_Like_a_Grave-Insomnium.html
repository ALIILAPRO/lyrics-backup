		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sound of the waves song of the woeful wind
Beauty of yearning the tune of my heart
For once there was a time
When I sat by your side
And right before our eyes
The world was open wide

Days of youth are long since gone
Never return to return again
But a long slow descent left any more
The waning years of heartache and regret

And yet the winds sing
They sing the fairest tune
I hear the waves sigh
They sigh out from pain
And since you set out
To reach for your hopes and dreams
I'll stay here helpless and in sight
For these wounded wings
I never left this barren soil
Where all my wishes slowly fade away

Days of youth are long since gone
Never return to return again
But a long slow descent left any more
The waning years of heartache and regret

Do you still remember (Do you still remember)
Would you still believe
(Would you still believe)
That this blackened soul of mine
(Soul of mine) was once untarnished?

Years of disappointment and disillusion
All I see in the mirror now
Is an old man with a heart like a grave
Do you still remember (Do you still remember)
Would you still believe
(Would you still believe)
That this blackened soul of mine
Was once untarnished?
