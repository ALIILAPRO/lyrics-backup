		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got opps
And I know that they still watchin' me
To this day
Can't believe that you lied to me
And my enemies, they became a fan of me
I remember the days when you would talk to me
I think a lot
And afraid that you 'gon waste my time
I have a feeling that you hate me
Can you give me a sign?
This shit getting to my head
But I'll be fine
Wanna go back to how it used to be

And I'm glad we don't talk no more
I been on my own shit, hope the best for you
Chillin' with a white bitch
And her hair blue
I don't care if my words finna hurt you
I don't need you
I think my life would be better
If I didn't meet you
Don't wanna see you, wish I never met you
From now on, imma act like I don't know you

Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah (Delta)

I got opps
And I know that they still watchin' me
To this day
Can't believe that you lied to me
And my enemies, they became a fan of me
I remember the days when you would talk to me
I think a lot
And afraid that you 'gon waste my time
I have a feeling that you hate me
Can you give me a sign?
This shit getting to my head
But i'll be fine
Wanna go back to how it used to be
