		<p>
		  Alright look
Can't believe this the place that I'd be
After years of no catching no sleep
Only seen ice when I opened the fridge
Now it's ice on my neck and it's ice on my wrist
In the basement I'm making a list
Got me wishing there's more to the tears
I've been grinding blood, sweat, and the tears
Now can you imagine it'd come out to this
Working hard, pushing work thru the kitchen
Tried to show em, they didn't see the vision
Tom cruise when I stepped on the mission
I Jump in the coupe then I hit the transmissions
Money big we don't do division
Move so fast you blink you gon miss it
Came from rags I ended with riches
Now I'm in my bag rock papers, no scissors
Little do you know I
Been scheming
Been waiting for this time
Little do you know I
Been plotting for the stars to come align
Little do you know how hard it took to come this far
Oh do I
Little do you know I
Little do you know I
Tell myself these the times that I prayed for
Through the trials tribulations hard times in the trenches
Thank god we found shine through the rainfall
I was kicked to the curb
Now I'm on the pitch serving tricks up and down like Neymar
Used to skips out on Zs with dreams of the house on the hills
50 yards and no neighbors
No service no static just status
I ran up the Gs now I'm on the radar
Little do you know I
Little do you know I
Can't believe this the place that I'd be
After years of not catching no sleep
Only seen ice when I opened the fridge
Now it's ice on my neck and it's ice on my wrist
In the basement I'm making a list
Got me wishing there's more to the tears
I've been grinding blood sweat and the tears
Now can you imagine it'd come out to this
Little do you know how hard it took to come this far
Oh do I
Little do you know I
Little do you know I
Little do you know I been scheming
I been plotting for this time
Little do you know I
Little do you know I
