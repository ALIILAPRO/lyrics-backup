		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It seems so hard to carry on
When you hear a voice
From long ago, so bittersweet

Even though I try, I can not
Read between the lines
You know I tried,
Oh, yes, I tried, whatÂ´s wrong

Too late to turn back time
To look over my shoulder
Maybe one day IÂ´ll return again

Remember Yesterday
And think about tomorrow
But you have to live today
Oh, lonely yesterday

DonÂ´t leave me with the sorrow
'Cause I have to live today

Every morning I awake
To see the newborn day
To carry on the flame
Until the end of time

Too late to turn back time
To look over my shoulder
Maybe one day IÂ´ll return again

Remember Yesterday
And think about tomorrow
But you have to live today
Oh, lonely yesterday
DonÂ´t leave me with the sorrow
'Cause I have to live today

Oh, oh, oh, donÂ´t you step aside
And pretend about the future
Oh, oh, oh, never live a lie
DonÂ´t you know tomorrow never comes

Remember Yesterday
And think about tomorrow
But you have to live today
Oh, lonely yesterday
DonÂ´t leave me with the sorrow
'Cause I have to live today

Oh, oh, oh, donÂ´t you step aside
And pretend about the future
Oh, oh, oh, never live a lie
DonÂ´t you know tomorrow never comes
