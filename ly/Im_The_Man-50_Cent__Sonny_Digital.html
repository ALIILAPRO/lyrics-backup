		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I came in the world cryin' and fussin'
Nigga, we ain't have nothin'
Every ghetto I know the same
We tryna make a little change
Preacher man come around talkin'
I don't wanna hear it, keep walkin'
I'ma put the powder in the pot
Whip it 'til I'm pullin' off a lot
Imagine when I pull it off the lot (Sonny Digital)
New shit come without a top
Once I'm on I ain't never gon' stop
Bitch, I'm on, I ain't never gon' stop

I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man
I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man

Ayy, came in the game gettin' money
Flippin' chickens, whip it, gettin' money
Niggas get to playin' with the money
Click-bang for the money
Shit changed over money
They love to see a nigga on the bottom
Catch a come-up, gotta keep it on the low
A nigga plug bless a nigga with a whole
Wanna break the bitch down into 36 O's
Looky here, bitch, I'm A-okay
Shorty wanna fuck with me
Strippin', yeah, the jiggin' and
Later she gon' hit my line
We ain't gon' waste no time
She suckin' and we fuckin' like she need me
While she make a bankroll easy
All the light in the room from the TV
We gettin' it on, then I'm gone
It's the type of shit that a nigga be on

Too much on my mind right now
I'm on the grind right now
Looking for me, sucker, then I need to be found right now
I got my nine right now
Bitch, I'll blow your mind right now
I ain't fuckin' 'round right now
Better get in line right now
Or fuck around and die right now
Hope you understand that

Bitch, I'm the man, ho, I'm the man, you know I'm the man
Bitch, I'm the man, ho, I'm the man, you know I'm the man
Bitch, I'm the man, ho, I'm the man, you know I'm the man
Bitch, I'm the man, ho, I'm the man, you know I'm the man

I'm a bonafide grade A hustler
A1, day 1, they can't touch a
Nigga like me, I be with the shit
Try and stick me, I'ma get you hit
Yeah, you know just how I get down
Bad bitches around, they smokin' and they drinkin'
And I'm thinkin' it can all work out
Send your bitch back blown out
It's never nothin' personal, believe me
Fuck around, your bitch don't wanna leave me
She talkin' 'bout takin' flights tonight when I'm out of town
Not around, she want me to fly in to put it down
It's nothin' to a real nigga, had that ass flyin' in first class
'Cause you seem to be regular, she don't want nothin' regular
Turn me on when she talk Spanish, that fat ass
You know I wanna get with it, so lady let's get it

Too much on my mind right now
I'm on the grind right now
Looking for me, sucker, then I need to be found right now
I got my nine right now
Bitch, I'll blow your mind right now
I ain't fuckin' 'round right now
Better get in line right now
Or fuck around and die right now
Hope you understand that

Bitch, I'm the man, ho, I'm the man, you know I'm the man
Bitch, I'm the man, ho, I'm the man, you know I'm the man
Bitch, I'm the man, ho, I'm the man, you know I'm the man
Bitch, I'm the man, ho, I'm the man, you know I'm the man
