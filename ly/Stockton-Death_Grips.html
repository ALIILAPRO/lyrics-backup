		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm bouncin' whoop-whoop
Loud and lit, Allan Poe-po shit
I'm bout ta loose that blue

I can't feel hype I man kill hype
Slapped to still life
Actors posin' plastic like token
Can't fit my low end splits your ocean
Obey the chosen the latent quotient raised to drogen
Heavy is the head you're blowin'
I'm fuckin' flippin'
Minute ago wasn't schiz but now I'm itchin'
Critical condition
Thought I told you not to listen
This road don't stop shiftin'
I'm floatin' I'm driftin'

I'm bouncin' whoop-whoop
Loud and lit, Allan Poe-po shit
I'm bout ta loose that blue

You ain't heard not my problem
Past ain't poppin' calli curbed beyond forgotten
Pervin' while them clutch the bottom
Feeders suck like stuck in Stockton
Cut 'em off like drunks been clockin'
Least three a month prestalkin'
Noted symptoms hid like like Laden
Bin through shit like Sodom
Instinct man no question looped me into no direction
No footprints in this bleach I tread them don't know yet but that's expected

I'm bouncin' whoop-whoop
Loud and lit, Allan Poe-po shit
I'm bout ta loose that blue

Caved in my ribs drug out fucked out Samhain skid off Bay Bridge
Come with me and I'll unhurt you
Keep all I do locked kept your move
Keep all I do locked kept your move
Should we be worried what I'm not?
Heard bleeders knock all types a shit
Is of no consequence
I'm out there I'm out there
I'm pushin' mojo yo-yo crack back and blow yo whole set lack
The cojones ta make it clap
Bouncin' get up wit it

I'm bouncin' whoop-whoop
Loud and lit, Allan Poe-po shit
I'm bout ta loose that blue
