		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I tell myself you don't mean a thing
But what we got, got no hold on me
But when you're not there, I just crumble
I tell myself I don't care that much
But I feel like I die 'til I feel your touch

Only love, only love can hurt like this
Only love can hurt like this
Must've been a deadly kiss
Only love can hurt like this

Say I wouldn't care if you walked away
But every time you're there, I'm begging you to stay
And when you come close, I just tremble
And every time, every time you go
It's like a knife that cuts right through my soul

Only love, only love can hurt like this
Only love can hurt like this
Must've been a deadly kiss
Only love can hurt like this
Only love can hurt like this
Your kisses burn into my skin
Only love can hurt like this

And it's the sweetest pain
Burning hot through my veins
Love is torture, makes me more sure

Only love can hurt like this
Only love can hurt like this
Must've been a deadly kiss
Only love can hurt like this
Only love can hurt like this
Your kisses burn into my skin
Only love can hurt like this
Oh, only love can hurt like this
And it must've been a deadly kiss
