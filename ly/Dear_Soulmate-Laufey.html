		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do you live in New York City?
Or a couple towns away?
Wherever you are
I'd jump in my car just to see you today

Will I meet you at a party?
Sit next to you on a plane?
Maybe I already know you and loathe you
But we'll fall in love someday

Dear soulmate
Do you think of me?
'Cause I do
Do you have green eyes?
Are they brown like mine?
Do you have a sister too?
Dear soulmate
One day I'll give this song to you

Will we drive up to the mountains?
Camp in a little tent?
When the bears come at night
Will you put up a fight?
Or will you hide with me and my flashlight?

Do you sleep on the right side?
'Cause I prefer the left
Will you make me buttered toast?
Perhaps a morning roast
When I wake up and I'm sad

Dear soulmate
Do you think of me?
'Cause I do
Do you have blue eyes?
Are they brown like mine?
Do you have a sister too?
Dear soulmate
One day I'll give this song to you

Mmm
Dear soulmate
I can't wait to fall in love with you
