		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh (what the fuck just happened?)
Oh, oh

I don't wanna cry no more (yeah)
Tired of hangin', I don't wanna try no more
Too much weight up on my back, oh
And I feel like I might snap, ah
I don't wanna cry no more
Tired of hangin', I don't wanna try no more
Too much weight up on my back, oh
And I feel like I might snap, ah

Think I've had enough of this game
Put a little too much trust in this game
I ain't havin' fun no more
I don't even think I'm in love no more
Never thought I'd say goodbye
White flag in my hand, I'ma wave it high
But I'm bruised up and I'm beat down
Cryin' and depressed every day of the week now
I'm done
Enough

I don't wanna cry no more
Tired of hangin', I don't wanna try no more
Too much weight up on my back, oh
And I feel like I might snap, ah
I don't wanna cry no more
Tired of hangin', I don't wanna try no more
Too much weight up on my back, oh
And I feel like I might snap, ah

Everything was going all right, then the shit went left (left, left, left, damn)
I wish at the end of the night I got nothin' left (left, left, left, damn, damn)
Watch the whole switch
Family fell apart even though I got rich
Tryna fight back, dad ain't raise no bitch
Gave this shit my life and they tryna take it
Back in one night well y'all can have it
I don't even want this shit no more (no more, no more, no more, no more)

I don't wanna cry no more
Tired of hangin', I don't wanna try no more
Too much weight up on my back, oh
And I feel like I might snap, ah
I don't wanna cry no more
Tired of hangin', I don't wanna try no more
Too much weight up on my back, oh
And I feel like I might snap, ah
