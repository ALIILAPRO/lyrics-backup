		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't want to be broken and quiet
Shut off and tired at times, but I am
I don't wanna be distant and cold
'Til nobody knows the person I am

Well, maybe a drop into my lemonade
A bitter taste, the pain away
Just something to thin the blood
I don't want to be woken up

I am a broken mirror, shut my eyes
And I'm a different person every night
I am a broken mirror, shut my eyes
And I'm a different person every night

I am a broken mirror, shut my eyes
And I'm a different person every night
I wanna burn it, rip off my disguise
And I'm a different person every night
In my head
In my head
In my head
In my head

I wanna be the life and the soul
Of every cold room that I touch
I wanna be acting the fool
Subtle and cool, it's all that I want

So slip a drop into my lemonade
But nothing takes the pain away
And I know that you understand
I don't wanna be who I am

I am a broken mirror, shut my eyes
And I'm a different person every night
I am a broken mirror, shut my eyes
And I'm a different person every night

I am a broken mirror, shut my eyes
And I'm a different person every night
I wanna burn it, rip off my disguise
And I'm a different person every night
In my head
In my head
In my head
In my head

In my head
In my head
In my head
In my head

In my head
In my head
