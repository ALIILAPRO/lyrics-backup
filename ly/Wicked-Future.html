		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wicked, wicked, wicked, wicked
Wicked tunes, you know?
(Southside)
Wizard
(Metro Boomin want some more, nigga)

Huh, wicked, wicked, wicked, wicked, wicked
Hold up, wicked, wicked, wicked, wicked, wicked
Woo, wicked, wicked, wicked, wicked, wicked
Hold up, wicked, wicked, wicked, wicked
Stand up in the motor, bust the dashboard
Stand up in the motor, bust the dashboard
Hold up, wicked, wicked, wicked, wicked, wicked
Wicked, wicked, wicked, wicked, wicked

Candles burnin', money burnin', graveyard these niggas
Phantom parkin', big dawg barkin' hey
Blood ties on me, woah, woah, woah, woah
Shawty want that wig, woah, woah, woah, woah
I'm drippin' Cartier, oh, oh, oh, oh
Put a gold bird on you, that's what's happenin'
I put that lingo on her, she was Spanish
I fill the one liter up with Xannies
This continental and it's panoramic
It's complimentary to the savages
You fuck around with me, it be a tragedy
I want green, green, green, no asparagus
I drink lean, lean, lean it ain't embarrassin'

Huh, wicked, wicked, wicked, wicked, wicked
Hold up, wicked, wicked, wicked, wicked, wicked
Woo, wicked, wicked, wicked, wicked, wicked

Now she goin', know that bitch goin'
I purchase Avianne, now she lit, huh?
Wedding band rings on me lit, huh?
Married to the game, I'm the shit, huh?
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
Bitch, we made men
We ain't pullin' up at cribs that we can't get
You can't pull a bitch on Instagram I ain't hit, huh
And if she tellin' lies about me 'cause she ain't shit, uh
She want that big-big dog status
I was in the alley with them nickel bags tallied
Now I'm Taliban Gang status, that's what's happenin'
And you niggas can't get close 'cause you don't know me
It ain't no more dip and dabbin', hangin' low key
These bitches see me and they panic
I can't believe it, I was on the corner gamblin'

Huh, wicked, wicked, wicked, wicked, wicked
Hold up, wicked, wicked, wicked, wicked, wicked
Woo, wicked, wicked, wicked, wicked, wicked
Wicked, wicked, wicked, wicked
Stand up in the motor, bust the dashboard
Stand up in the motor, bust the dashboard
Huh, wicked, wicked, wicked, wicked, wicked
Hold up, wicked, wicked, wicked, wicked, wicked
