		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You lead me on the path
Keep showing me the way
I feel a little lost
A little strange today
I think I'll take a hold
Of whatever comes my way
Then we'll see what happens
Take it day by day

I thought I had it all
I had it all worked out
Just what the future held
That there would be no doubt
But then the card came up
And I took another turn
But I don't know if it's
Fulfillment that I yearn

Tell me what you can hear
And then tell me what you see
Everybody has a different way
To view the world
I would like you to know
When you see the simple things
To appreciate this life
It's not too late to learn

Don't want to be here
Somewhere I'd rather be
But when I get there
I might find it's not for me

Tell me what you can hear
And then tell me what you see
Everybody has a different way
To view the world
I would like you to know
When you see the simple things
To appreciate this life
It's not too late to learn

Tell me what you can hear
And then tell me what you see
Everybody has a different way
To view the world
I would like you to know
When you see the simple things
To appreciate this life
It's not too late to learn

Don't wanna be here
Somewhere I'd rather be
But when I get there
I might find it's not for me

Don't know what I want
Or where I want to be
Feeling more confused
The more the days go by
