		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It couldn't go this way
She called me
She told me not to fall it isn't safe
Appalling
No one to keep me warm this holiday
Disheartening
You knew what this was it got away from me
3rd place for me

My sun is falling
No remedy for those the broken hearted
Live in bottles
Inside this seedy part of town
I'll swallow
My grief
You'll see
Suspended disbelief
Cozy
Lonely

It couldn't go this way
She called me
She told me not to fall it isn't safe
Appalling
No one to keep me warm this holiday
Disheartening
You knew what this was it got away from me
3rd place for me

You said you said no way we're going away it's so damn lovely
You said you said while sipping d'usee and grabbing my hand you love me
You said you said while laying in bed and kissing my neck so cozy
You leave you leave me laying all day and letting the birds eat
My soul
My soul
My soul
My soul
My soul
My soul
My soul
Ah

It couldn't go this way
She called me
She told me not to fall it isn't safe
Appalling
No one to keep me warm this holiday
Disheartening
You knew what this was it got away from me
3rd place for me
