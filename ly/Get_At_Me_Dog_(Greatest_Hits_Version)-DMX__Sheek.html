		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Yeah, I'm right here, dog) where my dogs at?
(We right here, dog) where my dogs at?
(I'm right here, dog)

What must I go through to show you shit is real? (Uh)
And I ain't really never gave a fuck how niggas feel (what?)
Rob and I steal, not 'cause I want to, 'cause I have to
And don't make me show you what the MAC do (come on)
If you don't know by now, then you slippin'
I'm on some bullshit that's got me jackin', niggas flippin'
Let my man and them stay pretty but I'ma stay shitty
Cruddy, it's all for the money, is you wit' me?
Get the bitches, and I'll commit the crime (uh-huh)
And when it's on, we transform like Optimus Prime
I'll form the head, roll out, let's make it happen (let's go)
If we ain't gonna get it wit' them, we'll take your cap
Bustin' off, dusting off the softest niggas
Money with the biggest mouth, yo, let's off this nigga
Up North this nigga never made a sound
Breathe too fucking hard and you getting bust down

Yo, yo, y'all niggas wanna be killers? (Get at me, dog)
Y'all niggas wanna feel us? (Get at me, dog)
Y'all niggas want the real (get at me, dog)
(Rrr, arf, arf, what the deal?)
Y'all niggas wanna be killers? (Get at me, dog)
Y'all niggas wanna feel us? (Get at me, dog)
Y'all niggas want the real (get at me, dog)
(Rrr, arf, arf, what the deal?)

Nowadays, it ain't looking too good
For certain niggas, I'm hurting niggas
(What you doing?) Robbing niggas, jerking niggas, sticking niggas
Cause they deserve it, when money got murdered
They know he died slow 'cause they heard it
The nigga ain't blew up the spot in a while
And the motherfucker ain't got shot in a while (you know?)
Just takes a light up to fuck the night up
Blow everything in sight up, fuck around and I'll have your ass right up
When you mention some shit you wasn't able to stand
I got shit that'll disable a man with the wave of a hand
The days are longer and it seems like I'm facing time
I've got a lot of dreams, but I'm not really chasing mine
I soak it all up like a sitting fly
'Cause nowadays getting by, nothing more than an occasional meal and getting high
I live to die, that's where I'm headed
Let your man hold something, now it's all about you can get it

Y'all niggas wanna be killers? (Get at me, dog)
Y'all niggas wanna feel us? (Get at me, dog)
Y'all niggas want the real (get at me, dog)
(What? Rrr, arf, arf, what the deal?)

One in the back left your faggot ass face down
Lucky that you breathing, but you dead from the waist down
The fuck is on your mind? Talking that shit that you be talking
And I bet you wish you never got hit 'cause you'd be walking
But shit happens and fuck it, you done did your dirt
Niggas is wondering how the fuck you hid your skirt
Right under their eyes, that's a surprise to the guys
That one of their mans was a bitch in disguise
Fucking with cats that order more hits and slaughter more kids
Let me holla at you, yo, that Baltimore shit (ayo)
Yeah mean? I'm just robbing to eat
And there's at least a thousand of us like me mobbing the street
When we're starving, we eat whatever's there
Come on, you know the code in the streets, whatever's fair
Blood stains and chalk, means your man couldn't walk
After the talk about him not being on the 11-33 to New York
Transforming-ass niggas'll get it quick
And yo, for real, that nigga K can suck my dick
And it's gon' take all these niggas in the rap game to barely move me
'Cause when I blow shit up, I have niggas falling
Like white bitches in a scary movie
Ah, you know I don't know how to act
Get too close to niggas it's like, "protected by Viper, stand back"
What's this? I thought you niggas was killers, demented
The fuck you want me to do with this coward? Finish him, it's ended
