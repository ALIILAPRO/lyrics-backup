		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Why, you want to tell me how to live my life?
And who, are you to tell me if it's black or white?
Mama, can you hear me? Try to understand
Is innocence the difference between a boy and a man
My daddy lived the lie, it's just the price that he paid
Sacrificed his life, just slavin' away

Oh, if there's one thing I hang onto
That gets me through the night
I ain't gonna do what I don't want to
I'm gonna live my life
Shining like a diamond, rolling with the dice
Standing on the ledge, I show the wind how to fly
When the world gets in my face
I say, have a nice day
Have a nice day

Take a look around you, look nothing's what it seems
We're living in the broken home of hopes and dreams
Let me be the first to shake a helping hand
With anybody, pray enough to take a stand
I've knocked on every door, on every dead end street
Looking for forgiveness
What's left to believe?

Oh, if there's one thing I hang onto
That gets me through the night
I ain't gonna do what I don't want to
I'm gonna live my life
Shining like a diamond, rolling with the dice
Standing on the ledge, I show the wind how to fly
When the world gets in my face
I say, have a nice day
Have a nice day

(Oh) oh, if there's one thing I hang onto
That gets me through the night
I ain't gonna do what I don't want to
I'm gonna live my life
Shining like a diamond, rolling with the dice
Standing on the ledge, I show the wind how to fly
When the world gets in my face
I say, have a nice day
Have a nice day
Have a nice day

When the world keeps trying, to drag me down
I've gotta raise my hands, gonna stand my ground
I say, hey, have a nice day
Have a nice day
Have a nice day
