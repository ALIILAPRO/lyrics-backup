		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm just gonna stay till you tell me to go
I only wanna hear what I already know
But I just wanna hear it said out loud
"Leave me alone god damn you, get out"

I'm just gonna stay till you tell me to leave
I'll climb onto your bed and
I'll get under the sheets
Just until you look me straight in the eye
Point to the door
Say "good luck and goodbye"

And I'm just gonna stay till
You give me a reason
I'm not gonna let you let me down easy
Not until I hear it straight from your mouth
"He's coming over i don't want you around"

So I'm just gonna sit here
And stare at your lips
I won't read it in your face
I won't take any hints
You only used me till someone real came along
Tell me the truth or tell me I'm wrong

"What good are words? What good are words?"
"Your heart is breaking"
"What good are words? What good are words?"
"I tried to tell you you
Said you already knew"
"What good are words? What good are words?"
"Your time is up your time is up"
"What good are words? What good are words?"
"I was as honest as I knew how to be"
"What good are words? What good are words?"
"Your heart is breaking"
"What good are words? What good are words?"
"I could've betrayed you"
"What good are words? What good are words?"
"Your time is up your time is up"
"What good are words? What good are words?"
"You tricked me into loving you"

"I'm telling you that very
Frankly and honestly if
I did fall in love with you
It would still have to end in the same way"
