		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This silence you've left me has me terrified
As simple as a complicated mind
I'm not what I used to be
But then again, I'd love to be
Cold hard floors, another warm soft hand
Screaming in my ears, the words I never said
I might get over it
But then again, here I sit

Sorry me, I do believe I've failed you
Time again to show you what I know
Suddenly I feel the need to save you
So stay right here until it's time to go

Things all stack up, waiting out my end
Seems the inner cancer's coming out again
I'll get to all of that eventually
But then again
I honestly forgot what I was going to say
I guess we all just think we're better off that way
We all deserve some time
But then again, so do I

Sorry me, I do believe I've failed you
Time again to show you what I know
Suddenly I feel the need to save you
So stay right here until it's time to go
