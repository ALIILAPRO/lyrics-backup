		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Cleveland status) yeah
Yeah, yeah (Plain Pat, what up?)

Whoa, Nellie, I don't even think they ready
They flow is too shitty, not me I can't get with it
Gon' with it, Kid Cudi the illy, rep my city
In the navy blue Cutlass, no roof above him
Hoes, they love 'em, model girls I cut and fuck 'em
Hey, I rep that double-O, you ain't on the ho
I got my man Chip the Rip with a Spanish bitch takin' flicks
And she gon' take a lick, yeah, mami
Later on we gettin' sushi, mami eatin' edamame
West Coast so I'm ghost, holla at my nigga Travie
We really become the heroes of the gym class, topping
The charts with the art that exhibits couldn't exhibit
The grizzle, I live it, run passed the timid livin'
In the bubble, keep the number when I mumble all the riffs
With skill, red-rum them trynna figure out him
Baptize myself in the river of Hennessy

Open up your heart and
You will understand me
Fall into the music
And let yourself go
Open up your heart and
You will understand me (that's right)
Fall into the music (get it right)
And let yourself

Go, go, Mach 5 flow
Do you want more? You shall receive, what I see
Deep in the realm if you felt like you were alone, no fear
Salute the underdog, I am here in the clear
Over there, niggas ain't diff', what if
I was them, I would be a simp, no dopeness
Will ever, ever be my aura
Steve Urkel nigga lookin' for a Laura
Proceed, I am the one, to clich√©, you call me Neo
If anything dope has arrived rap wise as far as overall killin'
Body, embody him
Not other morals to accommodate the carcasses
My heart is titanium alloy
So if you come up with ploys to destroy my passion
I'ma tell you now you are better off passin'
Stop writin' checks that your ass can't cash in, bro

Open up your heart and
You will understand me
Fall into the music
And let yourself go
Open up your heart and
You will understand me
Fall into the music
And let yourself
Open up your heart and
You will understand me
Fall into the music (yeah)
And let yourself go (yeah, yo, yo)
