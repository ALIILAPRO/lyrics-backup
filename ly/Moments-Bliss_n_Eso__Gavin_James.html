		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, I just wanna feel this way forever
How we did when we were young
Yeah, I know I've been changing
Yeah, life's been rearranging
Those times were golden, but I
I couldn't hold 'em all at once
I lost that moment
But now I got it back, yeah, I ain't gonna give it up

Yeah
You know, growing up happened so fast
And you only get your first times once
Those moments were special, like

The first breath, first step, first chick, first kiss
First time in love, first time on drugs
The first time I heard Pac, the first time it's all new
The first time the earth stopped, the first time I saw you
Yeah, those moments I'll always hold onto
Forever stained in my brain in a golden hue
Like when I was a kid just dreaming of the things I've built
Those autumn leaves would cover my hood in a crimson quilt
The world was mine and the memory of my home
Still triggered by the smell of fresh snow and pinecones
Those early days of the six-packs and stimulants
Before the demons came and kidnapped my innocence
Before life swept me up and I was hurled in
And I lost pieces of myself up in this whirlwind
But I had to find them again, 'cause they're the miracle
That took me from feeling invisible to invincible, yeah

Yeah, I just wanna feel this way forever
How we did when we were young
Yeah, I know I've been changing
Yeah, life's been rearranging
Those times were golden, but I
I couldn't hold 'em all at once
I lost that moment
But now I got it back, yeah, I ain't gonna give it up

Oh-ho-oh, oh, get up
Yeah, I ain't gonna give it up
Oh-ho-oh
But now I got it back, yeah, I ain't gonna give it up

Yo, see I remember how it felt making paper planes
Pretending I was Superman so I could save the day
I swear that I would see Santa if I could stay awake
And finding ways to fly away was like my great escape
An only child, a single mother, a small apartment
Didn't have that silver spoon, but we were always laughing
Staring at the clouds, chatting for hours
Where a simple smell lets me time travel through flowers
And I'm happy I believed, and everything happens for a reason
'Cause if your angel dies and your worlds crashing through your ceiling
Hopefully you know you own a map to your own freedom
Realize tears dry and it's a natural way of healing, yo

Yeah, I just wanna feel this way forever
How we did when we were young
Yeah, I know I've been changing
Yeah, life's been rearranging
Those times were golden, but I
I couldn't hold 'em all at once
I lost that moment
But now I got it back, yeah, I ain't gonna give it up

Oh-ho-oh, oh, get up
Yeah, I ain't gonna give it up
Oh-ho-oh
But now I got it back, yeah, I ain't gonna give it up

It up, it up
I ain't gonna give it up
It up, it up
Well, I ain't gonna give it up

They say time is precious and there's no going back
Shit, if I could only unfreeze this photograph
And dive in the windows of my eyes to feel how I felt
Inside right in that moment in time, I'd bring it all back to life
So fuck the money, cars, and accessories
'Cause the only thing we take to our grave is our memories
I said fuck the money, clothes, and accessories
'Cause the only thing we really own is our memories
Yeah
