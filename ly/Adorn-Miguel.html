		  She's art dealer chic
Would you be my friend, my freak?
She's (yeah) art dealer chic
Would you be my friend, my freak?

These lips can't wait to taste your skin, baby, no, no
And these eyes, yeah, can't wait to see your grin, ooh, ooh, baby
Just let my love
Just let my love adorn you
Please baby, yeah

You gotta know
You gotta know
You know that I adore you
Yeah, baby

Baby, these fists will always protect ya, lady
And this mind, ooh, will never neglect you, yeah, baby, ooh
And they stay trying to break us down
But don't let that affect us, no, baby
You just gotta let my love
Let my love
Let my love adorn you
Ah, le-le-le-let it dress you down

You gotta know
You gotta know
Know that I adore you
Just that, baby

Ah, ah, oh
Let my love adorn you, baby
Don't you ever
Don't you let nobody tell you different, baby
I'll always adore you
You gotta know now
You got to know, know, know
Now (could you be my friend, my freak?)

Oh, yeah
The same way that the stars adorn the skies, yeah (every night, baby)
Oh, and look up, sugar (every night, baby)
Now, hey, hey, hey
The same way that my
Whole world's in your eyes (when I look in your eyes, baby)
Ooh, and it's time now (you know that it's time, baby)

To let
Let my love adorn you baby, hey
Le-le-le-let it dress you down
You gotta know, baby
Oh, you gotta know
Know that I adorn you, yeah
Oh, love ain't never looked so good on ya
Oh, put it on, baby
Let my love adorn you
