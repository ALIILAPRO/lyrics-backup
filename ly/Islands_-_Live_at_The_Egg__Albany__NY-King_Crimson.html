		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Earth, stream, and tree encircled by sea
Waves sweep the sand from my island
My sunsets fade
Field and glade wait only for rain
Grain after grain, love erodes my
High weathered walls which fend off the tide
Cradle the wind
To my island

Gaunt granite climbs where gulls wheel and glide
Mournfully cry o'er my island
My dawn bride's veil, damp and pale
Dissolves in the sun
Love's web is spun, cats prowl, mice run
Wreathe snatch-hand briers where owls know my eyes
Violet skies
Touch my island
Touch me

Beneath the wind turned wave
Infinite peace
Islands join hands 'neath heaven's sea

Beneath the wind turned wave
Infinite peace
Islands join hands 'neath heaven's sea

Dark harbor quays like fingers of stone
Hungrily reach from my island
Clutch sailor's words, pearls and gourds
Are strewn on my shore
Equal in love, bound in circles
Earth, stream, and tree return to the sea
Waves sweep the sand from my island
From me

Beneath the wind turned wave
Infinite peace
Islands join hands 'neathe heaven's sea

It-it has a number of high spots, that i enjoy each this time
What are we going to do, um, do it twice more
Once with the oboe, once without it
And then, we've finished for the evening
Right

(It'll be nine o'clock soon, John)

(Okay, we're rolling, whenever you're ready, on three)

Three
One, two, three, two, two, three
