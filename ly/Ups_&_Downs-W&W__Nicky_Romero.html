		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We bottle up our ups and downs
It's only when the lights go down
That we come out

We bottle up our ups and downs
It's only when the lights go down
That we come out

Come out
Come out

We bottle up our ups and downs
It's only when the lights go down
That we come out

We bottle up our ups and downs
It's only when the lights go down
That we come out

We bottle up our ups and downs
It's only when the lights go down
That we come out

We bottle up our ups and downs
It's only when the lights go down
That we come out

Come out
Come out
Come out
Come out
Come out
Come out
It's only when the lights go down
That we come out
