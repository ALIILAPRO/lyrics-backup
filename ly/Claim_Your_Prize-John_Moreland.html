		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All the low down summer, there was nothing there to lift you
You couldn't see just how much pain there was to sift through
And I stopped asking how bad the world is broken
Cause no one's circumstances are ever really chosen

I guess it's a comfort, living your delusion
It makes me sad to see the kind of drugs you're using
The fear and anger, waves and waves of grief
I don't know how you missed it, your hero is a thief

So come on down and claim your prize
It's nothing like they advertise
No one makes it out alive

Waking up again when i can't find a reason
I told you the truth, and you told me it was treason
I'm thinking back on all your pretty petals
Before you felt there was this score you had to settle

I wasn't sleeping, the moon was high this morning
When your certain kind of sorrow came and touched me without warning
And the lies you tell yourself to try and feel ok
Well they all come at a price that somebody has to pay
