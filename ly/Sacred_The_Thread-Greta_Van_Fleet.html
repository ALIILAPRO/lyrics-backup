		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The sequins, ooh
Tripping on the light, whoa
I feel it, ah
Hugging me so tight
Whoa-whoa, whoa-whoa
Whoa-whoa, whoa-whoa

I've seen it in the stars
To dress up a wound, heal a scar

I've caught the wind in a kite of dreams
In a flight of seams
Like freedom sewn
And the people roar and the people soar
Sacred the thread, sacred the thread
I've caught the wind in a kite of dreams
In a flight of seams

I see me
Through colors, gems and trim, whoa
Unraveled, ah
The glow that was once dim
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah

I've seen it in the stars
To dress up the wound, heal a scar

I've caught the wind in a kite of dreams
In a flight of seams
Like freedom sewn
And the people roar and the people soar
Sacred the thread, sacred the thread
I've caught the wind in a kite of dreams
In a flight of seams

I've caught the wind in a kite of dreams
In a flight of seams
Like freedom sewn
And the people roar and the people soar
Sacred the thread, sacred the thread
I've caught the wind in a kite of dreams
In a flight of seams

Sacred the thread, sacred the thread
I've caught the wind in a kite of dreams
In a flight of seams
