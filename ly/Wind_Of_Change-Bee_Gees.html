		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In the streets of New York City
Every man can feel the cold
And I don't want no pity
But I want my story told

When the lights shine down on me
They shine on the little boy
Is this way to make him pay
Being born in a world of joy

But like me
He don't know where he'll go wrong
He won't cry so many tears
'Til he finds out why he don't belong like me

There's no room for us out there
You can lose your hope and pride
When it comes to broken dreams
You'll get your share
Sometime a man breaks down
And the good thing he is looking for
Are crushed into the ground

Get on up, look around
Can't you feel the wind of change?
Get on up, taste the air
Can't you see the wind of change

Don't you understand what I'm sayin'
We need a god down there
A man to lead us children,
Take us from the valley of fear

Make the lights shine down on us
Show us the road to go
Help us survive, make us arrive
Teach us what we need to know

But like me
He don't know where he'll go wrong
He won't cry so many tears
Till he finds out why he don't belong like me

There's no room for us out there
You can lose your hope and pride
When it comes to broken dreams
You'll get your share
Sometime a man breaks down
And the good thing he is looking for
Are crushed into the ground

Get on up, look around
Can't you feel the wind of change?
Get on up, taste the air
Can't you see the wind of change

Get on up
