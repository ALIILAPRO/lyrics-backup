		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I woke up, it was four in the morning
Clear as all hell that you'd already gone
(Gone, gone, gone)
Your note said, "Dear, you know I hate to disappear
But the days are short and the nights are getting long"
(Long, long, long)

And I just meant to tell you
That I don't want to let you down
(Down, down, down)
And I just meant to tell you
That I don't want to get you wrong
(Wrong)

Think about now with my legs wrapped around you
How many times before have you seen me run?
(Run, run, run)
It's a cruel kinda twist that you'd leave like this
Just drop my wrist and say, "Well, that's us done"
(Done, done)

I was just gonna tell you
That I don't want to let you down
Get lost in the crowd
Seen or unseen
Say what you mean

Simply a book, but you gave up a look
But I just don't care for and I cannot get through
(Through, through, through)
That you're writing again, and I'm glad old friend
I'll make sure you write me out of where you get to
(To, to, to)

I was just gonna tell you
That I don't want to let you down
Get lost in the crowd
Seen or unseen
Say what you mean

'Cause we all want to be here now
And we all want to be held down
And we all want to here now
And we all want to be held down

I woke up, it was four in the morning
Clear as all hell that you'd already gone
Your note said, "Dear, you know I hate to disappear
But the days are short and the nights are getting long"

And I just mean to tell you
That I don't want to be let down
Get lost in the crowd
Seen or unseen
Say what you mean
