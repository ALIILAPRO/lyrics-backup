		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She asks for a light
As our secrets spill on the window sill
We're buying more time
While we kill ourselves as we both inhale

Making believe there's a future
Is it naive to think we could work?
The second it's out then I lose her
We're already here, so one more won't hurt
It won't hurt

But all that we are is all that we'll ever be
'Cause he's the one waiting at home
She holds my guitar as I pluck out a melody
There's only so far we can go
Next to you, but I'll never be close
So take your time while you're mine and smoke slow

Breaking away for the hell of it, started innocent
I'm telling you things that I've never said
Hope I don't regret this

Making believe that we're clueless
One little spark that we won't put out
Making a million excuses
'Cause isn't it fun just for now?

But all that we are is all that we'll ever be
'Cause he's the one waiting at home
She holds my guitar as I pluck out a melody
There's only so far we can go
Next to you, but I'll never be close
So take your time while you're mine and smoke slow

Addicted to illusions of a love that never was
And never will be anyway, ooh
And nicotine don't taste the same
If I'm not with you savoring every breath we take

Play with fire
Take me higher

All that we are is all that we'll ever be
'Cause he's the one waiting at home
She holds my guitar as I pluck out a melody
There's only so far we can go
Next to you, but I'll never be close
So take your time while you're mine and smoke slow
