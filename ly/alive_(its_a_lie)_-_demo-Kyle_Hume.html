		<p>
		  Pictures on the wall
Swear they're all getting grayer
Don't feel a thing at all
But no one's even aware cuz
I just try to smile
Through all the pain
"How you been?"
"Oh I'm doing great"
But please don't
Ask me to promise
Cuz If I were honest
A lie it's a lie
I may look happy
But I swear that I'm
Dying on the inside
Survive survive
I don't know the last time I felt truly alive
I spend way too much time
Laying in my bed
Cuz I don't wanna deal with my life
Ohhh
A lie its a lie
I just wanna feel alright
Sleep in
'Till afternoon
But I still wake up tired
Don't know
What else to do
I feel so uninspired and
Finding motivation never works
Every day feels a little worse
So I just pretend I'm okay
When all I want to say is
A lie it's a lie
I may look happy
But I swear that I'm
Dying on the inside
Survive survive
I don't know the last time I felt truly alive
I spend way too much time
Laying in my bed
Cuz I don't wanna deal with my life
Ohhh
A lie it's a lie
I just wanna feel alright
