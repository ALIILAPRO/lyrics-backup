		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I see you harvesting
I see you wrapped in my way
But you won't get away with it honey
No, you'll never come close to me

You will forgive me if I'm lean
Or comatose on codeine
We were baptized, grey stones and azure river
To wake me from this twilight sleep

As we draw near the waiting room
With the nod of two white owls
One to sedate her, one shot to stop her heart
Dear Ethel, all the lights in the city went out

Birth of violence
Sister of the road
I see your defenses
I take ten paces

I've come to know what I need
I visualize while I bleed
Towns in a mudslide
An early morning shiver
Won't let them take you from me

Birth of violence
Sister of the road
I see your defenses
I take ten paces

Baby you are
Baby you are
Baby you are
Baby you are
Baby you are
Baby you are
The only one
The only one
The only one
The only one
