		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, pour my whole cup with feelings
Roll my whole blunt with healing
Goin' up, we ain't got a ceiling
I can't change you, I'm not willing

But I don't know why I'm trippin' on you
She said, "I'm distant on you"
No, I ain't switchin' on you
Yeah, this my mission, not you
Don't know why I'm trippin' on you
She said, "I'm distant on you"
No, I ain't switchin' on you
Yeah, this my mission, not you (yeah)

Rollin' gas, how I took this path
How I change my life, how shit goin' fast
I might check my balance, nigga, I won't check the dash
Get my money online, nigga, get my bread like Taz
Yeah, that shit too easy, yeah, that shit so simple
If this shit was easy, nigga, everyone would do it, yeah
They just want another slice off your plate, Kimbo
If I got it on me, just know they Akimbos

We not all the same, that might work for you
You say that's your gang, they might turn on you
We not all the same, my niggas'll burn you
You not in this lane, we might turn on you

Pour my whole cup with feelings
Roll my whole blunt with healing
Goin' up, we ain't got the ceiling
I can't change you, I'm not willing

But I don't know why I'm trippin' on you
She said, "I'm distant on you"
No, I ain't switchin' on you
Yeah, this my mission, not you
Don't know why I'm trippin' on you
She said, "I'm distant on you"
No, I ain't switchin' on you
Yeah, this my mission, not you (yeah)
