		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, no more following this endless maze
Separation will define the new way
What's broken is what leads us all astray
The chosen are renewed in amnesty
Broken, hopeless, the state of all our fates
Revolted, woken, lead us from this place

Nowhere to hide, strength realigned
The signal fire's alight
Given to fight, there's hope just in sight
The signal fire's alight

Can we walk a mile in another's shoes
To determine what we have to lose? (To lose)
Disconnection of a common reality
Becomes so lost in this world of hypocrisy

Nowhere to hide, strength realigned
The signal fire's alight
Given to fight, there's hope just in sight
The signal fire's alight
Alight

This is our beacon to deliver us all
To guide us away from this decay of humanity
Yeah

Nowhere to hide, strength realigned
The signal fire's alight
Given to fight, there's hope just in sight
The signal fire's alight
Alight (alight)
I won't give up this fight
Alight
The signal fire is alight
