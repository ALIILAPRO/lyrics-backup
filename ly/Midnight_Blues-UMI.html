		  Midnight Blues
Summer hues
Late at night I think 'bout you

Gloomy skies
Sweet goodbyes
Late at night I think 'bout you

And I wonder
Do you think about me too?
And I wonder
Do you feel the things I do?

Or is it just me now?
Or is it just me now?
'Cause I can't see clear now
No, I can't see clear now
And I need you here now
I don't need to know how
You fill the emptiness I feel inside

Oh
You make me feel like I can
I can fly again
You make me feel like I can
Can be loved again

Midnight blues
Sunset views
Late at night I sing to you

You make me feel like I can
I can fly again
(Welcome to the next level, makin' beats to my pain)
You make me feel like I can
(Welcome to the next level, makin' beats to my pain)

Can be loved again
(Welcome to the next level, makin' beats to my pain)
Can be loved again
(Welcome to the next level, makin' beats to my pain)
Can be loved again
