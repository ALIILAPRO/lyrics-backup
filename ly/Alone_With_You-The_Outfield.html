		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I see your face across a crowded room
I hear you say that you'll be leaving soon
I know it's late but all that I can do
Is close my eyes and dream that I'm alone with you

I'd like to talk to you so much but I don't know your name
I bet there's not a man in here that doesn't feel the same
As you're walking out the door there's nothing I can do
I close my eyes and dream that I'm alone with you

Yeah it's once in my life
Wish that I wasn't alone with myself
I feel like a child
Seems that I can't think of anyone else

The night is over an' I guess you're gone
I try and tell myself forget it and just carry on
But as I walk these lonely streets with nothing else to do
I close my eyes and dream that I'm alone with you
I close my eyes and dream that I'm alone with you
I close my eyes and dream that I'm alone with you
