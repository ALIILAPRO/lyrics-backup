		  Kaliii
Mmm-mmm, good

You ain't gotta say too much
From the look in your eyes, I can tell you wanna fuck (uh-huh)
Let me talk to you nasty (ooh)
I ain't really into cuffin', I just wanna act badly (ooh, fuck)
What's your zodiac? I just need someone to match me (Leo)
I got options, so you better act fastly (yeah)
He like, "Mmm-mmm, good" (ooh)
He wanna take me out my body, I don't think he could (nah, nah)
Said he cut everybody off, he don't want nobody else
Got my bitches screaming, "As he should" (as he should)
(What they say?)
Got my bitches screaming, "As he should"

I tend to make niggas crazy (ha), got that pull-up kinda pussy (purr)
I'm a vet, what I look like fuckin' with a rookie? (Huh?)
Niggas say I'm unapproachable, don't ever get emotional
Should've kept that last bitch if you need a ho that's coachable (ha)
I don't gotta love you to get nasty (nah)
But what I got on me, I promise you'll harass me (yeah)
Still tryna get rid of that nigga from last week (fuck)
I mean last year
Who gon' tell him? Ain't no love here (nah)
'Cause I ain't finna say too much
Broke his pockets, now he mad that he still ain't cuffed (damn)
Ain't no love, this lust
What's a me and you? Ain't no us
I'm for the toxic girls, in Kaliii, they trust (Kaliii)
Playin' niggas a must

You ain't gotta say too much
From the look in your eyes, I can tell you wanna fuck (uh-huh)
Let me talk to you nasty (ooh)
I ain't really into cuffin', I just wanna act badly (ooh, fuck)
What's your zodiac? L just need someone to match me (Leo)
I got options, so you better act fastly (yeah)
He like, "Mmm-mmm, good" (ooh)
He wanna take me out my body, I don't think he could (nah, nah)
Said he cut everybody off, he don't want nobody else
Got my bitches screaming, "As he should" (as he should)
(What they say?) 
Got my bitches screaming, "As he should"

Bitch say I smell good, I know I smell like money (yeah)
Ain't shit green but my motherfuckin' money (my motherfuckin' money)
I'ii break her down and I'll fold her like a pretzel (fold her like a pretzel)
Every time I fuck her, I'm on drugs, ain't no pressure (it ain't no pressure)
Know I like it when a bitch get slutty (get slutty)
Fuck together, baby, you my nutty buddy (nutty buddy)
You ain't gotta lie to me, I know you love me (I know you love me)
Met you like I met them hoes, you don't trust me (you don't trust me)
And I can't even lie (can't even lie)
I fucked you and your friend together, was a good time (it was a good time)
You know I tore that shit up like I was a bad child (a bad child)
She do it with no hands when she spaz out (she just spaz out)

You ain't gotta say too much
From the look in your eyes, I can tell you wanna fuck (uh-huh)
Let me talk to you nasty (ooh)
