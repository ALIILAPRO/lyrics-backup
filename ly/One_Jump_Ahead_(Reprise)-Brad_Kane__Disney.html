		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Gotta keep
One jump ahead of the breadline
One swing ahead of the sword
I steal only what I can't afford
(That's everything!)

One jump ahead of the lawmen
That's all, and that's no joke
These guys don't appreciate I'm broke

Riffraff! Street rat! Soundrel! Take that!

Just a little snack, guys
Rip him open, take it back, guys
I can take a hint, gotta face the facts
You're my only friend, Abu!
Who?
Oh it's that Aladdin's hit the bottom
He's become a one-man rise in crime
I'd blame parents except he hasn't got 'em
Gotta eat to live, gotta steal to eat
Tell you all about it when I got the time!

One jump ahead of the slowpokes
One skip ahead of my doom
Next time gonna use a nom de plume
One jump ahead of the hitmen
One hit ahead of the flock
I think I'll take a stroll around the block

Stop, thief! Vandal! Outrage! Scandal!

Let's not be too hasty
Still I think he's rather tasty
Gotta eat to live, gotta steal to eat
Otherwise we'd get along
Wrong!

One jump ahead of the hoofbeats
(Vandal!)
One hop ahead of the hump
(Street rat!)
One trick ahead of disaster
(Scoundrel!)
They're quick, but I'm much faster
(Take that!)
Here goes, better throw my hand in
Wish me happy landin'
All I gotta do is jump
