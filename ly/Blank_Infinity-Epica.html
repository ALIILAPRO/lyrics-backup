		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Trying to keep myself afloat upon this stream
But a thought is pulling me down
Pulling me all the way down

We are wandering towards a blank infinity
And extinguishing will now be the only way to diminish your sins
This vortex can't be filled up again
A hole in space and time

Do you cry to the heaven's high when you're confined in here?
Do you not ever wonder why these leaden tears will never dry?
They'll leave behind so many shadows in my mind

High in the sky, all of the clouds are passing by
Wait for this storm, wait for the rain,
And wait for the tears to fall down on me

We are wandering towards a blank infinity
And extinguishing will now be the only way to diminish your sins
This vortex can't be filled up again
A hole in space and time

Do you cry to the heaven's high when you're confined in here?
Do you not ever wonder why these leaden tears will never dry?
They'll leave behind so many shadows
Living in me, living in all the memories in my life

Do you wonder why
These tears never dry
Time forced into life
Living in my mind

Can we ever find a way in this labyrinth without end?
Labyrinth has no end
Which turn should I take?
Left or right?
Should I stay?
Should I be the one?

Do you cry to the heaven's high when you're confined in here?
Do you not ever wonder why these leaden tears will never dry?
They'll leave behind so many shadows
The substance in time forced into life
Still exists because it's here
Living in me, living in all the memories in my life

Lost inside blank infinity
