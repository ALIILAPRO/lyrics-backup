		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Verse 01:
On my own again, 
Finally have you to myself, 
Down that road again, 
Now you finally need some help, 
And I know this, 
The feel, the night, my karma says I've earned this 

Pre-Chorus 01:
But I know, 
I know, 
I know, 
I do it all to cope, 
I'm here but always gone, 
This feelings all my fault 
Oh god I gotta get away now, 
Head to shoulders,
And waist down, 
Everything but my heart pounds, 
I'm frozen, 
I can't let go 

Chorus 01:
All I feel is hard to mention, 
Caught between this hell and heaven, 
The life I live is not the one I want,
All I feel is hard to mention, 
Caught between this hell and heaven, 
The life I live is not the one I want 

Verse 02:
Turn up with your lies, 
Only here a night, 
I just hit the spot,
Tell em we're outside,
Do this every time but it,
Doesn't mean thing, 
Said she wanna link, 
But I, 
Need some time to think, 
No one's innocent, 
And I'm gone,
At the same time, feel a little lost, 
In the meantime, give into this lust,
It's the same always in and out of love,
And my heart

Chorus 02:
All I feel is hard to mention, 
Caught between this hell and heaven, 
The life I live is not the one I want,
All I feel is hard to mention, 
Caught between this hell and heaven, 
The life I live is not the one I want 

Interlude:
On my own it's getting late,
Oh my love I turned to hate,
But I know it's not your fault,
It's me who broke your heart,
It's been years since we just talked,
Still you burden every thought,
The night helped but now it makes me lost 

Verse 03:
Mezzanine touched the ceiling, 
This city state view has got me in my feelings, 
The travel down south is never not appealing, 
And suddenly I'm back I can never leave it,
How could I leave it, 
When you're on my mind, 
Always settling for less so I can ease my time, 
I'll meet someone new to fill this empty feeling, 
And I'll send her back smiling with an empty reason 

Pre-Chorus 02:
Pour up, 
Frozen,
One more drowns emotion, 
I'm broken, I've chosen that,
It is my breath and,
When night calls,
I've been lost,
Look downwards it controls us, 
I can't trust, show no love but 

Chorus 03:
It is my breath and air,
The feel of the night it haunts me, 
The feel of the night it wants me, 
It is my breath and air,
Remember the love you taught me, 
This gradient life evolves me

Hook Reprise:
All I feel is hard to mention, 
Caught between this hell and heaven, 
The life I live is not the one I want,
All I feel is hard to mention, 
Caught between this hell and heaven, 
The life I live is not the one I want 

All I feel is hard to mention, 
Caught between this hell and heaven, 
The life I live is not the one I want,
All I feel is hard to mention, 
Caught between this hell and heaven, 
The life I live is not the one I want
