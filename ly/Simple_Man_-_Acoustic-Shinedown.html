		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mama told me, when I was young
"Said sit beside me, my only son
And listen closely, to what I say
And if you do this, it will help you some sunny day" oh yeah

Oh take your time, don't live too fast
Troubles will come and they will pass
You'll find a woman, and you'll find love
And don't forget that, there is someone up above

And be a simple kind of man
Hmm, be something you love and understand
Baby be a simple kind of man
Oh, won't you do this for me son, if you can, if you can

And get your lust from the rich man's gold
All that you need now is in your soul
And you can do this, oh baby, if you try
All that I want for you, my son, is to be satisfied

And be a simple kind of man
Be something you love and understand
Baby be a simple kind of man
Won't you do this for me son, if you can, if you can

Boy don't you worry, you'll find yourself
Follow your heart and nothing else
And you can do this, oh baby, if you try
All that I want from you my son, is to be satisfied

And be a simple kind of man
Be something you'll love and understand
Baby be a simple, kind of man
Oh, won't you do this for me son, if you can

So baby, be a simple, be a simple man
Oh won't you do this for me son if you can
