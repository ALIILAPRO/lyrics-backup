		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  For the night everybody getting boomed
Everybody clear the room
I got something for you too look
Look

Let it slide once
 shouldn't let it slide twice
Disrespect, you set a price
Emotions spilling for the night
Everybody getting boomed
Everybody clear the room
I got something for you too
Ain't no telling what it do
Ain't no telling what it is


I gotta stay off the grid
Now they watching and telling
I gotta stay off the streets
Shit wanna make me
You ain't even wanna be around
Niggas talk about last year
You ain't even wanna be around
But you stay around
'Cause you hating on me always
Really don't care about it
Talking tough, we gon' hear 'bout it
Look, water dripping on my chain
Stab me, you gon' care 'bout it
Look, water dripping on my necklace
You can get wiped off the checklist
We don't play that disrespect shit
Notice we always express shit

Let it slide once
Shouldn't let it slide twice
Disrespect, you set a price
Emotions spilling for the night
Everybody getting boomed
Everybody clear the room
I got something for you too
Ain't no telling what it do
Ain't no telling what it is
Let it slide once
Shouldn't let it slide twice
Disrespect, you set a price
Emotions spilling for the night
Everybody getting boomed
Everybody clear the room
I got something for you too
Ain't no telling what it do
Ain't no telling what it is

I'm still on the block with the pull up
And it's pull up, I gotta keep a foot up
Still sending westies
Free all my dawgs who doing
Time in the sit up
Every trip to you, yes, we pull up
Moving gang slapping shit niggas shut up
No, you ain't getting lucky
You can get lefty
Everytime that we see you, pull up
Niggas pull up everytime that you pull up
Niggas pull up
