		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Get up and shake it up
It's time that you listen up and hear the call

They love the waterbed and not your own fire packed against the wall

Don't stop
Try to make your mark and make your mind up
Don't stop
Work it out and try to make it

Randy
Get yourself together
Got to get it up to make it better
Randy
You don't have to suffer
Step outside and find yourself a lover

You'll know you are loved
When it's time
Don't you know
Play with fire
When you know you've arrived
When it's time
Keep it slow
Shoot it high

Hold on to what you've got and strike while the iron's hot
Put up a fight
Those days are good and gone
Keep up, keep on going strong through the night

Don't stop
Try to make your mark and make your mind up
Don't stop
Work it out and try to make it

Randy
Get yourself together
Got to get it up to make it better
Randy
You don't have to suffer
Step outside and find yourself a lover

You'll know you are loved
When it's time
Don't you know
Play with fire
When you know you've arrived
When it's time
Keep it slow
Shoot it high

Oh

Feels like the latest version
Now that the wind is turning soft and cool
Next up a new dimension
Find something fresh and someone just for you

Don't stop
Try to make your mark and make your mind up
Don't stop
Work it out and try to make it

Randy
Get yourself together
Got to get it up to make it better
Randy
You don't have to suffer
Step outside and find yourself a lover

You'll know you are loved
When it's time
Don't you know
Play with fire
When you know you've arrived
When it's time
Keep it slow
Shoot it high
