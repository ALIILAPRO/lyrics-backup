		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Calm, calm, down
Let me call you
When I calm, calm, down
Let me call you
Calm, calm, down (let me, let me)
Let me calm down (let me)

Pull off and I almost hit him
He actin' like I ain't always with him
My heart sayin' I love him while I'm screamin' that I hate him
And it ain't no more debatin', this time it's an ultimatum
I never forgot where I was at the first day I met him
Yeah, it was love at first sight, but I ain't never sweat him
I knew if that if it was meant to be that one day I would let him
Twenty years later them decisions, I don't regret 'em
Just wish you would give me space when I really need it
To be alone in my zone when I'm really heated
Just 'cause I am quiet, don't mean you defeated
Wish you ain't need me to feel like you're completed
Don't wanna say somethin' mean when I don't mean it
Million missed calls, I don't wanna talk (wanna talk)
Just did a detox, now I wanna spark

I wrote a line for you and it was beautiful (calm, calm down)
I made a song for you that said you're beautiful (let call you)
You're so, so irresistible (when I calm, calm, down)
Take me to somewhere mystical (let me call you)
Your soul (calm, calm down)
Do you know? For you I promise I'll try (let me calm down)
For you, I promise I'll try
For you, I promise I'll try

Uh, havin' her ain't for the faint of heart
She bad as fuck, but hard to deal with,and it ain't her fault
She got ambition like them niggas and a vision for herself
So she can't rest until she feel like she done made her mark
So if you love her then you gotta learn to play your part
Sometimes you gotta play the back
But when you do, make sure you play it smart
All these niggas want her, so they hatin' hard
They talkin' slick and make you wanna pull a Rated-R
You like her, love her like a brother, like her manager, an A&R
Plus her therapist when it start rainin' hard
Her life was trauma filled, it left her with a tainted heart
Yet, you the nigga that she wanna tatt her name across
But you need patience and a lot of extra faith from God
To keep the family together, at a time when it's so regular to break apart
So God forbid y'all got a kid, therefore, I hate the thought
It's you and her against the world until there ain't no more breath from your lungs
I'm just a messenger, but God is who this message is from
I wanna send you my respect because I rep for the ones
That hold they wifey down despite all of the extras that come
Word to Willy Smith, these silly niggas heckle and shun
As if they life was somehow perfect and they never been plunged
Into a dark place, so I can't respect when it's done
It's family first through the worst, comin' second to none, for real

I wrote a line for you and it was beautiful (calm, calm down)
I made a song for you that said you're beautiful (let call you)
You're so, so irresistible (when I calm, calm, down)
Take me to somewhere mystical (let me call you)
Your soul (calm, calm down)
Do you know? (Let me calm down)

For you, I promise I'll try
