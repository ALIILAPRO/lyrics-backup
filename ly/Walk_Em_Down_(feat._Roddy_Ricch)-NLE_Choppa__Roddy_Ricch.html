Ooh, ooh, no
NLE the Top Shotta

Uh, posted (posted), in front of the trap (front the trap)
Sellin' dope 'til the sun come down (come down)
Take a fuck nigga right off the map (off the map)
When I hit him with this whole hundred rounds (a hundred rounds)
Yung Joc, in the club with my Glock (with my Glock)
You wanna play, and then this bitch goin' down (it's goin' down)
We ain't hesitatin', bullets get to blazin' (get to blazin')
I'ma lay him down like he in the lounge
Walk 'em down (down), walk 'em down (down)
Walk 'em down (down), walk 'em down
Walk 'em down, walk 'em down (down)
Walk 'em down (down), walk 'em down (down)

Walk down on 'em in Balenciaga runners
My blood slime a nigga out just like an anaconda
You go against me, then you fucked just like a used condom (yeah, yeah)
I roll 'em up and then I smoke 'em like some good ganja (I smoke 'em up, yeah)
Still doin' drive-bys, but I wanna walk 'em (I wanna)
If I can't find 'em, you know I'm gonna stalk 'em (I gotta stalk 'em)
Caution tape up on the scene, I had to white chalk 'em (brrt, brrt)
Runnin' from my gun, but my bullets had to hawk 'em (brrt, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Uh, posted (posted), in front of the trap (front the trap)
Sellin' dope 'til the sun come down (come down)
Take a fuck nigga right off the map (off the map)
When I hit him with this whole hundred rounds (a hundred rounds)
Yung Joc, in the club with my Glock (with my Glock)
You wanna play, and then this bitch goin' down (it's goin' down)
We ain't hesitatin', bullets get to blazin' (get to blazin')
I'ma lay him down like he in the lounge
Walk 'em down (down), walk 'em down (down)
Walk 'em down (down), walk 'em down
Walk 'em down, walk 'em down (down)
Walk 'em down (down), walk 'em down (down)

Nigga, I was posted on the corner where the J's at
Roll up in a four by four, pull up at the corner store
Look man, I got red in my drink when I pour up soda
I remember prayin' that the feds never take the Motorola
Choppa got the chopper, make 'em do a backflip
Pay my dawg a dime to walk him down, he need the racks, bitch
I been drinkin', I been takin' all this codeine to the face
Got a lot of M's in the safe
Caught a murder, then I beat the case
I was just about to do the race

Uh, posted (posted), in front of the trap (front the trap)
Sellin' dope 'til the sun come down (come down)
Take a fuck nigga right off the map (off the map)
When I hit him with this whole hundred rounds (a hundred rounds)
Yung Joc, in the club with my Glock (with my Glock)
You wanna play, and then this bitch goin' down (it's goin' down)
We ain't hesitatin', bullets get to blazin' (get to blazin')
I'ma lay him down like he in the lounge
Walk 'em down (down), walk 'em down (down)
Walk 'em down (down), walk 'em down
Walk 'em down, walk 'em down (down)
Walk 'em down (down), walk 'em down (down)
