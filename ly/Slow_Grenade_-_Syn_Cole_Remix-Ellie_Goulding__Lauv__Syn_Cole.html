		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Help me, my God, this got messy
Least I got the best seat
'Cause we put on one hell of a show
Waiting, I just keep on waiting
For the final curtain
'Cause I just can't let go of your love

Ooh
You say name like you know my dark side, ooh
Can't beat the taste of the tears that I'll cry, ooh

Slow grenade is blowing up my mistakes
So why don't I, why don't I stop it?
Still got time for me to stop it
It's like a part of me must want it
That's why I'm not running from it
Can't escape this blowing up
In my face so why can't I
Why can't I stop it?
Still got time for me to stop it
It's like a part of me must love it
That's why I'm not running from it

Crazy, late nights in the city
Drink until you hate me
Then say that I should just let you go
But hold on, why do we still hold on?
Think that we should move on
But we're too scared of being alone

Ooh
You say name like you know my dark side, ooh
Can't beat the taste of the tears that I'll cry, ooh

Slow grenade is blowing up my mistakes
So why don't I, why don't I stop it?
Still got time for me to stop it
It's like a part of me must want it
That's why I'm not running from it
Can't escape this blowing up
In my face so why can't I
Why can't I stop it?
Still got time for me to stop it
It's like a part of me must love it
That's why I'm not running from it
(Ah-ooh, ah-ooh)
Why can't I stop it?
Still got time for me to stop it
It's like a part of me must love it
That's why I'm not running from it

Help me, my God, this got messy
Least I got the best seat
'Cause we put on one hell of a show, whoa, yeah

Oh, slow grenade is blowing up my mistakes
So why don't I, why don't I stop it?
Still got time for me to stop it
It's like a part of me must want it
That's why I'm not running from it
Can't escape this blowing up
In my face, so why can't I
Why can't I stop it?
Still got time for me to stop it
It's like a part of me must love it
That's why I'm not running from it
(Ah-ooh, ah-ooh) Oh
Why can't I stop it?
Still got time for me to stop it
It's like a part of me must love it
That's why I'm not running from it
