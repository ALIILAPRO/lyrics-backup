		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mhm
Am I, am I, am I?
Working on my rules, yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah-yeah-yeah
Am I, am I
Am I, am I

Am I asking for too much
Like all my vouchers are all used up
Like do you really want a new love?
Feel like you're out here tryna choose up
Look I've been out here doing backflips
Like I was training for Olympics
To all the niggas tryna pocket watch
Just know that bag got a little big

Rules, working my rules
Working on my rules
Rule number one
Rule number two
Working on my rules, working on my rules
Rule number one
Rule number two

Rule number one no explaining
Rule number two no complaining
10,000 hours like it's nothing
I take my hardest times and turn 'em into something
Don't you lie, don't tell me lies, no I don't fuck with that
I tell truth and nothing but it, I'm in love with that
Running through my rules telling you what not to do
Like don't you kick no fake shit and lose your attitude
Know I'm on the hiNigh (high)
Quick to pull a ciNard (card)
Realest on the bliNock (block)
We don't do pretenders
So you should never triNy (try)
Or we gon' make 'em dinner

Working on my rules, yeah, my rules
Follow or you lose
Working on my rules, yeah, my rules
You don't get to choose
I've been feeling new
You should let me teach you how to move
I've been working on my rules
I've been working on my rules

Rules, working my rules
Working on my rules
Rule number one
Rule number two
Working on my rules, working on my rules
Rule number one
Rule number two

Tell you where I'm at
I was setting these rules, they was running off track
I'm on a high, we on the way
I'm on a high, we on the way
Disobey my rules and we got problems
And I just came off of six years of them shits
From exes to labels and being homeless
I didn't have it, wasn't able
Now I could own it, that's if I want it
I'm way too young for your shit
Way too young to be this lit
Working on my rules
Lot of rules that I learned growing up in Zone 6
