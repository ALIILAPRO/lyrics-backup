		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm a savage tonight
Woke the beast, now I'm ready to strike
No more keeping me out of the fight
Bout to see what it's like when I bite
Yeah, thought you were in control?
Bout to reap what you sow
You can talk all you want, cause I'm all in to win
cnd I'm ‘bout to explode
See y'all up ahead and I step on the gas
Yeah, I don't mean to boast but you ain't got a chance
I'm at critical mass, yeah, I'm moving too fast
Your house built outta glass, and you ain't gonna last

No fear, running right now, yeah
Living every second now like it's the last
We running with no fear, we starting it now, yeah
We live in the moment, we're leading the pack
cnd we never look back

See me rolling I wear no disguise
Take a pic ‘cause I'm one of kind
Heavy hitters, you better go hide
Now I'm ready to take to the skies
Yeah, ‘cause we rock with the finest
Yeah, we make it look stylish
cnd we never keep silent.
Did the time, now we're timeless
‘cause this ain't no place for the slow-laners
Huh, yeah, we only hustle with dope players
So be choosing your weapon
cnd be counting your blessings
There's no time like the present
We ain't coming in second

No fear, running right now, yeah
Living every second now like it's the last
We running with no fear, we starting it now, yeah
We live in the moment, we're leading the pack

No fear, running right now, yeah
Living every second now like it's the last
We running with no fear, we starting it now, yeah
We live in the moment, we're leading the pack
cnd we never look back.

We running, we running with
We running, we running with
We running, we running with
We running, we running with
We running, we running with

No fear, running right now, yeah
Living every second now like it's the last
We running with no fear, we starting it now, yeah
We live in the moment, we're leading the pack

No fear, running right now, yeah
Living every second now like it's the last
We running with no fear, we starting it now, yeah
We live in the moment, we're leading the pack
cnd we never look back
