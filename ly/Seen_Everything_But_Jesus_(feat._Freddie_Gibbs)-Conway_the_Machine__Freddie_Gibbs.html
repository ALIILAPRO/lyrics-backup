		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh, yeah, uh
Yeah, yeah, whoa, oh
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I felt like singin', nigga (uh)

I did a lot of shit that I regret, yeah (I did a lot of shit I regret)
I've done a lot of things I can't take back (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, take back)
But I was tryna just get my respect, uh (tryna just get my respect)
I catch the body when I ring this MAC (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Lord knows that I'm tryin' (Lord knows), but we come up from the bottom
Growin' up, most of my homies was dyin'
You know that I'm slidin' on a nigga if my babies is cryin' (you know I'm slidin', for my babies)
I'ma forever stay solid (yeah, yeah)

Look, Lil Lotto got shot, Mikey B got shot (pssh)
Lil Jojo got shot, ChineGun got shot (rest in peace, niggas)
I start my verse sayin' they names to show we haven't forgot (uh huh)
I'm reminiscin' about my niggas, I miss them a lot (We ain't forgot you niggas)
Bismillah, city I'm from get risky a lot
Gotta get you a Glock, in case you gotta lick a few shots (boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom)
Flip your pack a few times, stack it, and get you a block
Keep your grip on you for niggas tryna get what you got
My nigga Sos up in the feds, he been down for like seven
We fell out before he left and we never got to address it
I still answer every call, when he come home, I plan to bless him (real shit)
'Cause we spoke about it like two men and I was corrected (uh huh)
That's lil' shit I'm ain't stressin' (Nah), we still got a connection
He was in the feds with West and I'm solid without a question
Back then, two of the woes hit a lick for that lil' bread
Ain't get them bricks out of that nigga, they still shot him and fled (brr)
Police caught 'em both two days later and caught the bitch
She ain't know not to take your cell phone when you hit a lick (fuck is you doin'?)
Look, I'm from a sturdy block, duckin' them dirty cops
Made a fortune with a fork and a dirty pot, I swear I did a lot

I did a lot of shit that I regret, yeah (I did a lot of shit I regret)
I've done a lot of things I can't take back (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, take back)
But I was tryna just get my respect, uh (tryna just get my respect)
I catch the body when I ring this MAC (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Lord knows that I'm tryin' (Lord knows), but we come up from the bottom
Growin' up, most of my homies was dyin'
You know that I'm slidin' on a nigga if my babies is cryin' (you know I'm slidin', for my babies)
I'ma forever stay solid (yeah, yeah)

Yeah, I done a lot of shit that I regret (I regret)
Yeah, I bust the strap until it ain't nothin' left
I done seen everything but Jesus, I ain't scared of death (scared of death)
Yeah, I scraped that Pyrex 'til it ain't nothin' left, yeah, yeah (skrrt, skrrt)
It ain't no competition on this mic, oppositions want my life
Mama said I can't be hurt 'cause I'm drippin' in the blood of Christ
Set up by my family members, man, sometimes your blood ain't right
Couldn't afford new Js, I wiped my cousin blood up off my Nikes
And kept it steppin', my Ls ain't losses, bitch, I get my lessons
'Fore a nigga get up off this shit, Randy Moss this shit, gotta catch my blessings
Fuck the police, bitch, every time they caught me, caught me with my weapon (yeah)
Young Kane spit the coldest shit, that COVID shit, it ain't no testin'
Now I lay me down to sleep, pray the Lord this dope I keep
Fifteenth in Virginia, get your issue when you over east
Pulled up in my twist-start, do a show, it's like I stole the key (skrrt)
Seen Snow on Tik Tok and I said, "it's over for the streets" 

I did a lot of shit that I regret, yeah (I did a lot of shit I regret)
I've done a lot of things I can't take back (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, take back)
But I was tryna just get my respect, uh (tryna just get my respect)
I catch the body when I ring this MAC (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Lord knows that I'm tryin' (Lord knows), but we come up from the bottom
Growin' up, most of my homies was dyin'
You know that I'm slidin' on a nigga if my babies is cryin' (you know I'm slidin', for my babies)
I'ma forever stay solid (yeah, yeah)
