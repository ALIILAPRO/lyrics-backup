		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You ever looked at a nigga like who was just poppin', 
Poppin' shit and you just knew, knew that nigga was broke?
Broke ass nigga

Das Cap, talkin' online you get Cap
My young nigga keep a scrap
Drive with a scrap on his lap
Fuck posting up in the trap
I'm finna cop me an island, yeah
I put myself on the map
Rich and it ain't 'cos of rap
Yeah, bitch I ain't renting and I hop in a Bentley and it ain't got no ceiling
You mad? Fuck ya feelings
Bitch, I ain't renting and I hop in a Bentley and it ain't got no ceiling
You mad? Fuck ya feelings

All my niggas be wildin'
Stay with the cannon, the gang wildin' out
Nigga don't talk about stylin'
I stay with the drip, put it all on my mouth
New coupe it came with twin turbo
Sendin' on bullets like Tony Romo
Put that bitch on the syrup, it's slow-mo
Pullin' off with the gang in a photo
Check, check, check, check, check, check, check it out
I'm with the static like radio
Why do your pistol shoot vertical?

Man you niggas ain't shootin' at nobody man
You niggas shootin' in air man
All these niggas do is flodge, flake, and beef through text
Man these niggas is hoes
Niggas ain't gettin' no goddamn money man
Das cap, this niggas ain't, this niggas ain't gettin' no fuckin' money

Das Cap, talkin' online you get Cap
My young nigga keep a scrap
Drive with a scrap on his lap
Fuck posting up in the trap
I'm finna cop me an island, yeah
I put myself on the map
Rich and it ain't 'cos of rap
Yeah, bitch I ain't renting and I hop in a Bentley and it ain't got no ceiling
You mad? Fuck ya feelings
Bitch, I ain't renting and I hop in a Bentley and it ain't got no ceiling
You mad? Fuck ya feelings

Okay, I'm tryna fuck a new bitch
I'm tryna make a new flip
Hittin' home runs like Chip
Yeah, fuck with the nigga
Fuck with my money, we may had to cut us a nigga
Ain't no debate with none of y'all niggas
22 diamonds they shine in the picture
Menthol, shorty blow dick like Newport
Hundred thousand dollars in a Jansport
Stackin' money tall make it camp fort
Fuck it

Man
Man you know the world would be a lot more truthful if you had to pay a lie man
You niggas be lyin' all day man 
Just talkin' for no reason
Cappin' this, cappin' that
I don't understand that, you never capped on nothin'
I'm the youngest nigga, I mean everything I say, I do what I say, you feel me?

Das Cap, talkin' online you get Cap
My young nigga keep a scrap
Drive with a scrap on his lap
Fuck posting up in the trap
I'm finna cop me an island, yeah
I put myself on the map
Rich and it ain't 'cos of rap
Yeah, bitch I ain't renting and I hop in a Bentley and it ain't got no ceiling
You mad? Fuck ya feelings
Bitch I ain't renting and I hop in a Bentley and it ain't got no ceiling
You mad? Fuck ya feelings

Hop in the Maybach
Hop in the, hop in the Maybach, yeah yeah
Hop in the Maybach, yeah
Hop in the, hop in the Maybach, yeah skrt
