		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't
Be...
Silent

Fight

(Violence, mêlées, & disturbances of the peace)

Here's your introduction to destruction
& the hate sustaining me
Are we safer or in danger?
Drowning in atrocities?
Riot gear, the slaves are here
Piling corpses high
Its the rich man's war
But its the poor that fight
More capitalist crimes,
More enemies than allies
No WMD's, who gives a fuck
If they die
Just kill em all, watch em fall
Skin the world with their lies
Its a rich man's war
But its the poor that fight

[Chorus]
Stand up
Speak out
Strike back
Stand up
Speak out
Strike back
They don't know
What they started
Confrontation

[Verse 2]
My religion of resistance
Challenging everything
Radicals & dissidents
Of creativity
We are the children
Of the siege you hide
In this rich man's war
Where the poor just die
More deception & greed
More wars & disease
More lies from the hive mind
That seek to deceive
A weak nation of need
Like silent thieves in the night
Its a rich man's war
But it's the poor that die

[Chorus]

Stand, fight
Speak, fight
Strike back!

Stand, fight
Speak, fight
Strike back!

They don't know
What they started

Confrontation

[Bridge]

This is my
Battle cry!

Defy the lies
Of the tyrant race
With a fist in the air
& a finger in their face!

Defy the tyrants!
Don't be silent!

Defy the tyrants!
Don't be silent!

Defy the tyrants!
Don't be silent!

Defy the tyrants!
Don't be silent!

[Chorus]

Stand, fight
Speak, fight
Strike back!

Stand, fight
Speak, fight
Strike back!

They don't know
What they started

Confrontation

[Outro]

There's no
Way they
Can stop us
Now

So let them try
We fight or we die
