		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do
Do-mi-so-do
Isn't it pretty?
That's exceedingly simple
Do-mi-so-ti
We're making music
What is the point?
You're not making anything
Well, if it isn't anything, then why does it sound so good?

I suppose it's just interest
Do-mi-so-do
Devoid of substance or purpose, a hypothetical pattern
Do-mi-so-ti
For the satisfaction of bringing it to completion
(Sure)

Do-mi-so-ti
Interest without meaning
Solutions without problems
And then you just add words
Here's what I have been working on

Life and death and love and birth
And peace and war on the planet Earth
Is there anything that's worth more
Than peace and love on the planet Earth?
Ooh-woah, come on and sing it with me
(Sing?)
The words relate to the key
(Key?)
If it's a pattern
If it's a pattern
Then just repeat after me

Life and death and love and birth
Life and death and love and birth
Now you sing mi-fa-mi-mi-fa-mi-ti-la
And peace and war on the planet Earth
Yes, yes, that's it!
That's so easy

Yeah, but that's what's fun about it
You should write something, you should write a song!
About what?
Whatever you're thinking!

I guess we're already here
I guess we already know
We've all got something to fear
We've all got nowhere to go
I think you're all insane!
But I guess I am too
Anybody would be if they were stuck on Earth with you
(Hahaha, yes!)

Life and death and love and birth and
Life and death and love and birth and
Life and death and love and birth and
Peace and war on the planet Earth

Is there anything that's worth more?
Is there anything that's worth more?
Is there anything that's worth more
Than peace and love on the planet Earth?
