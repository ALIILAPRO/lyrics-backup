		  Shut up and sleep with me
Come on, why don't you sleep with me?
Shut up and sleep with me
Come on, aha and sleep with me

Shut up and sleep with me
Come on, why don't you sleep with me?
Shut up and sleep with me
Come on, aha and sleep with me

Shut up and sleep with me
Come on, why don't you sleep with me?
Shut up and sleep with me
Come on, aha and sleep with me

Shut up and sleep with me
Come on, why don't you sleep with me?
Shut up and sleep with me
Come on, aha and sleep with me

Shut up and sleep with me
Come on, why don't you sleep with me?
Shut up and sleep with me
Come on, aha and sleep with me

Shut up and sleep with me
Come on, why don't you sleep with me?
Shut up and sleep with me
Come on, aha and sleep with me

I love your body
Not so much, I like your mind
In fact you're boring
Pretend not being of my kind
You keep on talking
Of some girl that I don't know
When will you shut up
And when will we go

You are young, you're free
Why don't you sleep with me?
You are young, you're free
Why don't you sleep with me?

Shut up and sleep with me
Come on, why don't you sleep with me?
Shut up and sleep with me
Come on, aha and sleep with me

Shut up and sleep with me
Come on, why don't you sleep with me?
Shut up and sleep with me
Come on, aha and sleep with me

Shut up and sleep with me
Come on, why don't you sleep with me?
Shut up and sleep with me
Come on, aha and sleep with me

Shut up and sleep with me
Come on, why don't you sleep with me?
Shut up and sleep with me
Come on, aha and sleep with me

Don't you listen to those old conventions
No hide the surprise
Your real intentions
You're open minded
At least that what you keep on sayin'
Don't be afraid of doing
What you are best in
Shut up, shut up
Shut up, shut up 
Shut up, shut up 
Shut up, shut up 

You are young, you're free
Why don't you sleep with me?
You are young, you're free
Why don't you sleep with me?

Shut up and sleep with me
Come on, why don't you sleep with me?
Shut up and sleep with me
Come on, aha and sleep with me

Shut up and sleep with me
Come on, why don't you sleep with me?
Shut up and sleep with me
Come on, aha and sleep with me

Shut up and sleep with me
Come on, why don't you sleep with me?
Shut up and sleep with me
Come on, aha and sleep with me

Shut up and sleep with me
Come on, why don't you sleep with me?
Shut up and sleep with me
Come on, aha and sleep with me

Shut up and sleep with me
Come on, why don't you sleep with me?
Shut up and sleep with me
Come on, aha and sleep with me

Shut up and sleep with me
Come on, why don't you sleep with me?
Shut up and sleep with me
Come on, aha and sleep with me
