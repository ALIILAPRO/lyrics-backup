		  (What's that she just said Shaan?)
Bad bitch when I'm up in the function
Johnny Dang on the chain, it's custom
Walk through when I'm lookin' like a hottie
Lil' baby wanna menage wit' the body, it's bussin'
This dress look good 'cause I'm in it
Big body, Range Rover not rented
I'm in my bag, I'm in my Telfy
Dripped down in Prada, shoes is Giuseppe

Big Don, big money, big pressure
I stunt out on hoes, no effort
Your man in my DM, you should leave him
When I ask about his girl he don't remember
What bitch you know this fly though?
Yeah, bitch, I'm bad, no Michael
Fuck all my opps, ain't shit friendly
Bitches is broke, no, you can't check me
Rich bitch shit, tell a ho to get her money up
Brand new whip in a race, you the runner up
Codeine cray wit' the drank in this double cup
Out my way, ego bigger than a Hummer truck
Diamonds on me dance, they gon' dance, no TikTok
Spent a couple bands, couple bands on my watch
Bitches want beef, what is they thinkin'?
Stay out my phone, boy, we is not linkin'

Put my page on public, and I know that they watchin'
Yeah, opps what up?
Postin' my location 'cause I know that they plottin'
Yeah, you got the drop or what?
Bubblegum baby, we can get it poppin'
Uh, we gon' box or what?
Bitches is pussy, bitches be bluffin'
Talk all that talk, ain't doin' nothin'

Bad bitch when I'm up in the function
Johnny Dang on the chain, it's custom
Walk through when I'm lookin' like a hottie
Lil' baby wanna menage wit' the body, it's bussin'
This dress look good 'cause I'm in it
Big body, Range Rover not rented
I'm in my bag, I'm in my Telfy
Dripped down in Prada, shoes is Giuseppe

I'm too hot, so these bitches ain't cool wit' me
I'm too tough, ain't shit a bitch could do to me
Pull up on the opp, got the drop, who's next?
I might drop the top on the block to flex
Can't call me ugly, 'cause you know I look good ho
Bitches won't try me, but I wish a bitch would though
I'm not top five, I am the one
I dare you to slide, bitch, you ain't dumb
You know I got the sauce, I drip, no stylist
You know I'm fly as hell, bad bitch, no mileage
Hair done, my face beat, that's Fenty
Thirty-inch wig, 'cause I like my shit lengthy
You do what you can, and I do what I want
Don't check the tags, I don't care what it cost
Bitch, you is broke, get you some money
You want ya man? Come take him from me

Put my page on public, and I know that they watchin'
Yeah, opps what up?
Postin' my location 'cause I know that they plottin'
Yeah, you got the drop or what?
Bubblegum baby, we can get it poppin'
Uh, we gon' box or what?
Bitches is pussy, bitches be bluffin'
Talk all that talk, ain't doin' nothin'
