		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here in my dreams
Dying just to feel you near
[No fear, no tears]
Dying just to feel your fire
And show I'm mad for you
It is time to come close to our dearness
Why won't you hear me ?

You are my passion, I'm waiting for your love
Fantasy, emotions - our destiny is set
Will you share tonight with me ?
I need to feel your lust !
I need you, my love

Here in my heart
Nothing's left for any others
[You are the only]
Your absence is like a nightmare
And I won't let you go
It is time to come close to our dearness

You are my passion, I'm waiting for your love
Fantasy, emotions... our destiny is set
Will you share your life with me ?
I need nothing but love !

You are my passion, I'm waiting for your love
Fantasy, emotions - our destiny is set
Will you be with me tonight ?
Will you be with me for life ?

I need your love forevermore
The only place for me...
I wish I could be with you !
