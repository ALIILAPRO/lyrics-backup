		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dem dey think say I gentle for face
But I no gather
Nothing you do go tension me
You're messing with the wrong person

(It's Kel P Vibes)
What do they say about me
Too much gossiping but they saying nothing
Why-why
I don't take it lightly
I just keep the focus on the mouth that I feed
Olopa kuro ki nkoja
Me I no wan fight but don't cross my line
Anything you see see don't be surprised
Me I be animal I don't want to bite

Dem dey think say I gentle for face
But I no gather
Nothing you do go tension me
You're messing with the wrong person
Dem dey think say I gentle for face
But I no gather
Nothing you do go tension me
You're messing with the wrong person

Why should I talk
Why should I talk
My money manranma full stop
They taking shots they taking shots
I take one shot of dongoyaro
E no concern me somebody talk no time for that
E no concern me somebody talk no time for that

Dem dey think say I gentle for face
But I no gather
Nothing you do go tension me
You're messing with the wrong person
Dem dey think say I gentle for face
But I no gather
Nothing you do go tension me
You're messing with the wrong person

I no dey look Uche face when I dey spray kalanut
Ag Baby pass me the weapon no be Catapult
My Kala too dey hot my finger too dey (?)
Gun them down, blackout omo the jigg is up
Odumodu na you we trust
Put them in a body bag Abacha stuff
Ken Saro Wiwa I fought with everything I got
Obalola, I'm the ruler of the Zanga
Make I Buga show my Kala

Dem dey think say I gentle for face
But I no gather
Nothing you do go tension me
You're messing with the wrong person
Dem dey think say I gentle for face
But I no gather (Ag Baby, how far nau?)
Nothing you do go tension me
You're messing with the wrong person

Wangere wangere wa
Looking brand new
I be cha cha
No put your mouth for my matter
I make the Benjamin scatter
Wangere wangere wa
Looking brand new
I be cha cha
No put your mouth for my matter
I make the Benjamin scatter
