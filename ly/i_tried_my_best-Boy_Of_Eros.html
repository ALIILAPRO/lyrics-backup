		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Gettin' sick of fuckin' everything
And I'm so young, I've had enough and that's a scary thing
My parents hope that I get rich and get me everything
I'm hopin' I can see the coming days, it just the little things

Now I'm stuck inside my head, the worst of all things
Cause I was thinkin' I was dead, but it was all dreams
And I was hopin' you could save me from this fuckin' hell
But you broke my heart, that's just a start, the pain I fuckin' felt

Had my heart in shambles, had to look inside my fuckin' self
Broken into pieces, had to pick it all up by myself
You don't do that shit until you find the time to love yourself
I step into the mirror, I ain't lookin' at a damn thing

Thinkin' I'm invisible, but I don't live with no shame
Been like this for years, I never cared, it's just the same thing
Hopin' when I'm gone, the people that I love believe in me
I doubt myself a lot, I never seem to find a fuckin' peace

Hopin' it was worth it, all the things that I had fuckin' done
I had so many problems, but you never see me fuckin' run
Thought that I was good, but that was just a lie i told myself
I'd put myself through hell with all this thinkin' that I fuckin' do

Never gained a lot, so what's the point that I was tryin' to prove
Never gave a fuckin', and that's the point that I was tryin' to prove
Hopin' when I die, I get the proper well-deserving rest
And if I never make it, tell the Lord that I had tried my best

And if I never make it, tell the Lord that I had tried my best
And if I never make it, tell the Lord that I had tried my best
And if I never make it, tell the Lord that I had tried my best
And if I never make it, tell the Lord that I had tried my best

And if I never make it, tell the Lord that I had tried my best
And if I never make it, tell the Lord that I had tried my best
And if I never make it, tell the Lord that I had tried my best
And if I never make it, tell the Lord that I had tried my best

And if I never make it, tell the Lord that I had tried my best
And if I never make it, tell the Lord that I had tried my best
And if I never make it, tell the Lord that I had tried my best
