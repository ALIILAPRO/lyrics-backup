		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How I live for the moments
Where I'm still in Your presence
All the noise dies down
Lord speak to me now

You have all my attention
I will linger and listen
I can't miss a thing

Lord I know my heart wants more of You
My heart wants something new
So I surrender all

All I want is to live within Your love
Be undone by who You are
My desire is to know You deeper
Lord I will open up again
Throw my fears into the wind
I am desperate for a touch of heaven

Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh

You're the fire in the morning
You're the cool in the evening
The breath in my soul
All the life in my bones

There is no hesitation
In Your love and affection
It's the sweetest of all

Lord I know my heart wants more of You
My heart wants something new
So I surrender all

All I want is to live within Your love
Be undone by who You are
My desire is to know You deeper
Lord I will open up again
Throw my fears into the wind
I am desperate for a touch of heaven

Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh

Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh

I open up my heart to You
I open up my heart to You now
So do what only You can
Jesus have Your way in me now (come on)

I open up my heart to You, yeah
I open up my heart to You now
So do what only You can
Jesus have Your way in me now

I open up my heart to You, yeah
I open up my heart to You now
So do what only You can
Jesus have Your way in me now

Oh oh oh oh 
Na na na
Na na na 
For every voice is saying

All I want is to live within Your love
Be undone by who You are
My desire is to know You deeper
Lord I will open up again
Throw my fears into the wind
I am desperate for a touch of heaven

Na na na
Na na na 
Na na na

Da da da 
Da da da 
Da da da 

'Cause all I want is to live within Your love
Be undone by who You are
My desire is to know You deeper
Lord I will open up again
Throw my fears into the wind
I am desperate for a touch of heaven
