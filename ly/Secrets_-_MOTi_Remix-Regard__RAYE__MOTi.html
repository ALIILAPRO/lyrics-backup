		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't know 'bout you, 'bout you
'Bout you, you, you, you, you
There's somethin' in his eyes
He's keepin' secrets
I don't know 'bout you, 'bout you
'Bout you, you, you, you, you
There's somethin' in his eyes
He's keepin' secrets

What a way to drop a bombshell, baby
Guess you really didn't think I'd find out
Hear the silence, cryin'
In the room, on the side with the lights out
Know that you're feelin', mmh-hm
Know what you're feelin', uh-uh

Fuckin' with my heart and head
(And again, and again, and again, and again)
Fallen outta love again, yeah
(And again, and again, and again, and again)
Rollin' up my blunt in bed
(In my bed, in my bed, in my bed, in my bed)
Fallen outta love again, yeah
It's been a very, very long night
Sittin' with my girls, sippin' wine like

I don't know 'bout you, 'bout you
'Bout you, you, you, you, you
There's somethin' in his eyes
He's keepin' secrets
I don't know 'bout you, 'bout you
'Bout you, you, you, you, you
There's somethin' in his eyes
He's keepin' secrets
Oh

I'ma have to take a mugshot, baby
What you doin' to me's criminal out here
On my knees, I'm prayin'
In the room, on the floor, with the lights down
Clothes in the kitchen, uh-uh
I'ma light it and leave it for you

Fuckin' with my heart and head
(And again, and again, and again, and again)
Fallen outta love again, yeah
(And again, and again, and again, and again)
Rollin' up my blunt in bed
(In my bed, in my bed, in my bed, in my bed)
Fallen outta love again, yeah
It's been a very, very long night
Sittin' with my girls, sippin' wine like

I don't know 'bout you, 'bout you
'Bout you, you, you, you, you
There's somethin' in his eyes
He's keepin' secrets
I don't know 'bout you, 'bout you
'Bout you, you, you, you, you
There's somethin' in his eyes
He's keepin' secrets
Oh

I don't know 'bout you, 'bout you
'Bout you, you, you, you, you
There's somethin' in his eyes
He's keepin' secrets
I don't know 'bout you, 'bout you
'Bout you, you, you, you, you
There's somethin' in his eyes
He's keepin' secrets
