		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All I need is a place to be and a way to feel
A space to figure out where I belong
A chance to know my thoughts and find a way to show
What I feel
And if this is real
Yeah

Don't wanna disappoint you
Don't wanna let you down
'Cause that's the last thing I would do
I'm asking for your patience
I realize I could lose you
But lately I've been so confused

I've been thinkin, you've been on my mind
So I've been praying, to find a way that I
Can be sure, the way that you've been showing me
Don't you, want that for me

Wondering endlessly if this is right or wrong
Or if it's just about me all along
All I need is time to search within my soul
So I can share a deeper part of me yeah

Don't want to disappoint you
Don't want to let you down
'Cause that's the last thing I would do
I'm asking for your patience
I realize I could lose you
But lately I've been so confused

I've been thinkin, you've been on my mind
So I've been praying, to find a way that I
Can be sure, the way that you've been showing me
Don't you, want that for me

Baby, what's meant to be
Will surely be
If you loved me baby you would understand
But I can't give you anything
I don't have myself to give
And it's killing me inside

I've been thinkin, you've been on my mind
So I've been praying, to find a way that I
Can be sure, the way that you've been showing me
Don't you, want that for me

I've been thinkin, you've been on my mind
So I've been praying, to find a way that I
Can be sure, the way that you've been showing me
Don't you, want that for me
