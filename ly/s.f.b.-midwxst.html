		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Met this girl down in Memphis
Shawty, she kinda pretentious
I was tryna make her my apprentice
Swore she wasn't average

Not used to dippin' in the mornin'
Swear you're so important
Some shit got to get sorted
'Fore we fuck, this just a warnin'

I won't be there in the mornin', no, I will not spend the night
I won't be there in the mornin', your best friend up on my line
Know I told you once before, catch that flight, I'll be on tour
So I won't be there in the mornin'
This bitch so fuckin' borin'

Early flight in, yeah, yeah
Lay the pipe in, yeah, yeah
'Till you find the love within, yeah, yeah
Let me touch up on your skin, yeah, yeah

Not used to dippin' in the mornin'
Swear you're so important
Some shit got to get sorted
'Fore we fuck, this just a warnin'

I won't be there in the mornin', no, I will not spend the night
I won't be there in the mornin', your best friend up on my line
Know I told you once before, catch that flight, I'll be on tour
So I won't be there in the mornin', this bitch so fuckin' borin'

Bend it over, touch your toes, then do it again
Say, bend it over, touch your toes, do it again
Say, bend it over, touch your toes, do it again
Say, bend it over, touch your toes, yeah, do it again

I won't be there in the mornin', no, I will not spend the night
I won't be there in the mornin', your best friend up on my line
Know I told you once before, catch that flight, I'll be on tour
So I won't be there in the mornin', this bitch so fuckin' borin'

And now front, back, side to side
Front, back, side to side
Front, back, side to side
Okay, front, back, and side to side
Yeah, drop that ass to the floor
Drop that ass to the floor
Drop that ass to the floor
Drop that ass to the floor and let me see you get

Man, everybody always in my business talkin' 'bout
Oh, she talkin' 'bout I'm the problem, I'm the problem
You the problem, there's nothin' I can do

Man, you tuned into 105.1, fellas, text your girl, say you died
It's up, catch you on the next one
