		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Twisted criminal underground
Subjugation of the victim
For complete control
Reaping vital body parts
Surgical precision taking
All that will be sold

Sliced wide open, right down the chest
Removal of the organs
Cut the arteries and veins
Everything must go
Before the victim dies
Burn the body to dispose
Callous acts of the nefarious
Leaving no tracks, no evidence
They vanish never to be seen again
Banished from existence

Sliced wide open, right down the chest
Removal of the organs
Cut the arteries and veins
Everything must go
Before the victim dies
Burn the body to dispose
Callous acts of the nefarious
Leaving no tracks, no evidence
They vanish never to be seen again
Banished from existence

Inhumane harvest
Subjugation of the victims
For complete control
Inhumane harvest
Surgical precision taking
All that will be sold

Numbers of the missing rise
While their profit multiplies
So many lives erased
Covert genocide
Numbers of the missing rise
While their profit multiplies
So many lives erased
Covert genocide

Callous acts of the nefarious
Leaving no tracks, no evidence
They vanish never to be seen again
Banished from existence

Inhumane harvest
Subjugation of the victims
For complete control
Inhumane harvest
Surgical precision taking
All that will be sold
