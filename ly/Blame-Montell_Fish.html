		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't even love you, girl
Only want you for your touch
And sometimes I'm so ashamed
Baby, who am I to blame?
I don't even love you, girl
Only want you for your touch
And sometimes I'm so ashamed
Baby, who am I to blame?

Won't you stop messing 'round
Why'd you lie yourself, girl?
Girl, you look like a clown
Is your dignity left, girl?
Don't act like you didn't know
What I wasn't noticed for
Girl, don't act like you don't know
That I didn't love her so

I don't even love you, girl
Only want you for your touch
And sometimes I'm so ashamed
Baby, who am I to blame?
I don't even love you, girl
Only want you for your touch
And sometimes I'm so ashamed
Baby, who am I to blame?
I don't even love you, girl
Only want you for your touch
And sometimes I'm so ashamed
Baby, who am I to blame?
I don't even love you, girl
Only want you for your touch
And sometimes I'm so ashamed
Baby, who am I to blame?

Save me from this feeling
Save me from this feeling
