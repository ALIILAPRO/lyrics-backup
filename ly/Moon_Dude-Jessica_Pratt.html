		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Moon dude, you can try the weight of your pulley now
In outer space and time
You can cast a gaze on our planet lines, ta-da
You're on the outside, you're looking in
To the escalators humming
They are pulling you from nothing but your loneliness

I know you're searching all the time
In the corners of your mind
But you can't turn this planets 'round
But, boy, don't you want me now?

Moon dude, you can try the weight of your pulley now
In outer space and time
You can cast a gaze on our planet lines, ta-da
You're on the outside, you're looking in
To the escalators humming
They are pulling you from nothing but your loneliness

I know you're searching all the time
Through the corners of your mind
But you can't turn this planet 'round
Oh don't let me down
Boy, don't you want me now

[?] geranium blue
They are looking for you there
With rotations in the air
They can't see you
Lest you be shining
Lest you be shining
