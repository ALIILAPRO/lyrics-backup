		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You talk your talk like your something else You walking down the
street all by yourself You spending money
Don't know where it comes from
I'm not a fan of you
I'm not a fan of you at all
Oh no so syndicated
God Damn so medicated
Oh no I'm misbehaving
Oh no
I don't feel quite right
There's something in the air tonight
Must be the way she's looking at me
Is there something wrong
Is there something wrong with me
I don't feel quite right
There's something in the air now tonight
Must be the words that she speaks
Is there something wrong
Is there something wrong with me
Cause something is wrong
Oh na na na na oh
You walk your walk but your falling down falling down 
High heels on a cat walk up or down
You spending money
Don't know where it comes from
Now wake up
Now fall down
Going yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah Uh
I don't feel quite right
There's something in the air tonight 
Must be the way she's looking at me
Is there something wrong
Is there something wrong with me?
I don't feel quite right
There's something in the air now tonight
Must be the words that she speaks
Is there something wrong
Is there something wrong with me?
Well something is wrong
Oh no no no no
You change your hair
You change your lips
But you'll never find your fix
Oh no so syndicated
God damn so medicated
Oh yeah I'm misbehaving
Oh yeah
I don't feel quite right
There's something in the air tonight 
Must be the way she's looking at me
Is there something wrong
Is there something wrong with me
I don't feel quite right
There's something in the air now tonight 
Must be the words that she speaks
Is there something wrong
Is there something wrong with me 
'Cause something is wrong
Oh no no no no
Something is wrong
Hit me now
Get up
Get down
Stand up
Lie down
Get down
Stand up
Sit down
Something is wrong
