		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm not afraid of the black man running
He's got it right, he's got a better life coming
I don't care what the captain said
I fold it right at the top of my head
I lost my sight and the state packs in
I follow my heart and it leads me right to Jackson

Oh, Keller, oh, oh, oh
She gave us a medal, she gave us a map
Oh, Canner Row, oh, oh, oh
If seeing is right, then look where you're at

I'm not afraid of Nichol's Park
I ride the train and I ride it after dark
I'm not afraid to get it right
I turn around and I give it one more try
I said things that I meant to say
The bandstand chairs and the Dewey Day parade
I go out to the golden age
The spirit is right and the spirit doesn't change

Oh, Keller, oh, oh, oh
She gave us mirror, she gave us a map
Oh, Canner Row, oh, oh, oh
If seeing is right then look where you're at

Andrew Jackson, all I'm asking
Show us the wheel and give us the wine
Woohoo, woohoo
Raise the banner, jackson hammer
Everyone goes to the capitol line
Woohoo, woohoo
Colored preacher, nice to meet you
The spirit is here and the spirit is fine
Woohoo, woohoo
Education, ask the nation
You gave us our sight and the hearing is fine
Woohoo, woohoo
Andrew Jackson, all I'm asking
Give us the wheel and give us the wine
