		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Something in the air
Is telling me to go there
So I'll follow my nose
Go wherever it goes

It's calling from around the corner
Waiting just outside of town
Trailing vapors sweet and tangy
Daring me to track it down

It's blanketing the high-rise towers
Blasting through the sands of time
It's useless to resist its power
It's now or never

So fresh
I'll search until I find it
So fresh
I'm closing in behind it
So fresh
Nothing could be better
So fresh
Like I died and went to heaven

So fresh it almost makes me want to cry
So fresh it's givin' me a second life

I see a fork in the road
Where it goes I don't know
I won't even think twice
I really don't have a choice

It's calling from around the corner
Waiting just outside of town
Trailing vapors sweet and tangy
Daring me to track it down

It's blanketing the high-rise towers
Blasting through the sands of time
It's useless to resist its power
It's now or never

So fresh
I'll search until I find it
So fresh
I'm closing in behind it
So fresh
Nothing could be better
So fresh
Like I died and went to heaven

So fresh
So fresh
So fresh
So fresh

So fresh it almost makes me want to cry
So fresh it's givin' me a second life

So fresh it almost makes me want to cry
So fresh it's givin' me a second life

So fresh!
