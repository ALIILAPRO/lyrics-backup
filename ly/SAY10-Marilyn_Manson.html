		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Devil's got a cut, like a slit in a cattles calf
Dollar sign snakes, I'm all in the damned
Godless, fearless of the flood
Or the blood of the coming spring

Something is shedding its scales
Crying from the heat of the light
Or the empty shell on the stage
And cash is a poor man's money
And cash is a poor man's money

You say "God" and I say "Say 10"
You say "God" and I say "Say 10"
Say, say, say 10

Open your mouth, love
Like a gutted church
My goat horns are napalm trees
And a crown of thorns is hard to swallow

You should pray now
Is it above or is it below?
You should pray now
Is it above or is it below?

You say "God" and I say "Say 10"
You say "God" and I say "Say 10"
Say, say, say 10

You say "God", I say "Say 10"
You say "God" and I say "Say 10"
Say, say, say 10

Cocaine and Abel, I don't baptize whores
I'm a legend, I'm not a fable
Cocaine and Abel, I don't baptize whores
I'm a legend, I'm not a fable
Cocaine and Abel, I don't baptize whores
I'm a legend, I'm not a fable

You should pray now
Is it above or is it below?
You should pray now
Is it above or is it below?

You say "God" and I say "Say 10"
You say "God" and I say "Say 10"
Say, say, say 10

You say "God" and I say "Say 10"
You say "God" and I say "Say 10"
Say, say, say 10

Say, say, say 10
Say, say, say 10
