		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dark nights, I can't sleep, so I cry 'til I close my eyes (Cheeze)
I never ask God why, I just where the road designed (go Grizz)
Take a look in the sky (sky), my eyes open wide (ayy, bro, is that Jambo?)
All eyes on me, but I'm no 2Pac

I'm a Goat, I'm a boss, I'm a leader (woo)
Won't settle for nothing, not even it's cheaper
To fill up my tank, I need drank by the liter
I bought her a car and that bitch was a creeper (skrrt)
Got the keys to the streets but you might got amnesia
Got Cheeze on the beat so you know this a heater
Put cheese on me last just like I'm a pizza
Hold on, I just caught a fever (go)
You forgot how I put it together
The Rocket and 'Cho, we gon' last forever (Take')
5:30, Huncho and 'Set get up early and go out 
And go get that bag together ('Set)
Who the fuck gonna put us together? 
Can't nobody put this shit back together
So stay the fuck out of the middle
Lil' fella, we always gon' be that, we fam' forever (Migo)
How I look tryna dance with the devil
Got ice in my cross and my dad was a reverend (huh?)
I watched my brother Takeoff go to Heaven
An angel, we celebrate 11/11 (angel)
Greatest group, I can count on some blessings
Stay connected like charging a Tessie
Fuck a nigga, I'm down with my bestie (fuck)
That's my 'phew, I can never forget him
No weapons formed against me shall prosper (nah)
Fuck a closet, cleaning out my locker (woo)
Talk to me nice, not proper
I'm looking for the smoke like a rasta
I'll call on him if I need a partner (grr)
Even though what he did was kinda
It's bigger than us and let's not remind her (big)
We together, nigga, get the chopper (rraow)

Dark nights, I can't sleep, so I cry 'til I close my eyes
I never ask God why (God), I just where the road designed (no)
Take a look in the sky (sky), my eyes open wide (wide)
All eyes on me, but I'm no 2Pac

Open wide, speed it up (speed it up, speed it up)
On the moon, mama's only son (mama, mama)
Good drank what my nephew loved (purple, purple)
Don't break the seal, you can't open one (nope)
Dark nights, I can't sleep for none
Close my eyes, I can't see none
Don't ask God why for none
We on this road, it's designed to run
