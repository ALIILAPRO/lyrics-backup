		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Did you wake up and feel
Like we've been here before?
'Cause the rush that I felt when you held me
I can't ignore
And the way that your hands
Found their way to mine
It feels like a journey they've taken
A thousand times

I keep thinkin' back to last night
We danced together 'til the daylight
So familiar how it felt like
I swear we fell in love in a past life
I keep thinkin' back to last night
We found each other in the spotlight
And there's no way it was the first time
I swear we fell in love in a past life

In a past life
In a past life
In a past life
In a past life

Was it a trick of the light
Or was it déjà vu?
Was it a memory I saw in a flashback
When I looked at you? (When I looked at you)
Was it a higher power?
Some kind of energy (oh-oh)
Oh-oh, that always knew one day
You would come back to me?

I keep thinkin' back to last night
We danced together 'til the daylight
So familiar how it felt like
I swear we fell in love in a past life
Oh, I keep thinkin' back to last night
We found each other in the spotlight
And there's no way it was the first time
I swear we fell in love in a past life (swear we fell in love)
I swear we fell in love in a past life (swear we fell in love)

In a past life
In a past life
Oh, I keep thinkin' back to last night
We found each other in the spotlight
And there's no way it was the first time
I swear we fell in love in a past life
In a past life
