		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby, hop in the drop of my new car
Can't stop, won't stop, you a new star
Shine so bright but you stunt so hard
Got 'em like oh my Lord

Baby, hop in the drop of my new car
Can't stop, won't stop, you a new star
Shine so bright but you stunt so hard
Got 'em like oh my Lord

Should we whip the Benz or the Beamer, yeah?
VVS chains on freezer, yeah
Shorty live in Beverly like Weezer, yeah
And if she take me home Imma please her, yea
Let's go take a ride in the Wraith
They be talking crazy, but we fine either way
I don't give a damn, I'm just tryna get the cake
24/7 with my brothers and we all gettin' paid
Keep it 1k and that's never gon' change
Take you on a date, have you mine in a day
You just say the words and you know I'm on the way
On the way

Baby, hop in the drop of my new car
Can't stop, won't stop, you a new star
Shine so bright but you stunt so hard
Got 'em like oh my Lord

Baby, hop in the drop of my new car
Can't stop, won't stop, you a new star
Shine so bright but you stunt so hard
Got 'em like oh my Lord (ayy, yeah)

Beep beep in the back of the Jeep
I gotta shorty that I'm tryna take home, ayy
She peeped, I'm a dog off the leash
Don't be surprised you find me lookin' for a bone
Saint Laurent, it's a Don in your presence
Bust it down, yeah the crown kinda heavy (kinda heavy)
In the town gettin' wild actin' reckless
If you call I'll be there in a second (damn)
'Cause the wheels on the whip come in stainless (stainless)
And the life that we live kinda dangerous (dangerous)
Plus that ass that you got hella famous
So let me take you home

Baby, hop in the drop of my new car
Can't stop, won't stop, you a new star
Shine so bright but you stunt so hard
Got 'em like oh my Lord

Baby, hop in the drop of my new car
Can't stop, won't stop, you a new star
Shine so bright but you stunt so hard
Got 'em like oh my Lord (my Lord)
(Oh my Lord)
