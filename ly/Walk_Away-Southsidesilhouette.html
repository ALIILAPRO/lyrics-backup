		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hopping onna airplane
Tell her that I love her
Working on the daily
I ain't trynna struggle
Meeting different people
Hopping out my bubble
Rocking different layers
All my shit be doubled
Don't got to hit plays no more
But still got a couple
Imma keep it subtle
Step on they rebuttals
Been playing my cards right
I don't gotta shuffle
She treating my heart right
But I cannot buckle
Trynna be my friend right
Sorry I can't trust you
They like where you been I been too deep up in this duffle
G-Southside finna ball out
Baby imma baller
Never had to borrow
I got that shit tomorrow
Breaking down that pain
Put that right in a cigar
Niggas they be fake
Flip the script like a kendama
If I been away
Just know I'm touching the comas
I don't want no drama
Baby I want the dollars
Feel like the Dondotta
Grab my dogs by the collar
Walk away from love
I will do it if I gotta
She said forget you nigga
Bitch I already forgotcha
Take my heart right off my sleeve
and put it in my pocket
I know that they watching me
Gotta put my guard up
Damn I been the shit
Since I been walking in DC's
Behind ten percent
In this whip they cannot see me
Can't even pretend
I ain't haunted I done seen things
Tried to make amends
Now she like why is you leaving?
It's not that I don't love you baby
Had to drop you off
cause you hate when I'm elevating
And that shit had me so queasy
I'm just trynna be me
I'm just trynna ouu
Im just trynna ouu
Ouu
Hopping onna airplane
Tell her that I love her
Working on the daily
I ain't trynna struggle
Meeting different people
Hopping out my bubble
Rocking different layers
All my shit be doubled
Don't got to hit plays no more
But still got a couple
Imma keep it subtle
Step on they rebuttals
Been playing my cards right
I don't gotta shuffle
She treating my heart right
But I cannot buckle
Trynna be my friend right
Sorry I can't trust you
They like where you been I been too deep up in this duffle
