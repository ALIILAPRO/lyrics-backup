		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hot town summer in the city
Back of my neck gettin` dirty and gritty
I been down isn`t it a pity
Doesn`t seem to be a shadow in the city

All around people lookin` half dead
Walkin` down the sidewalk out of their match head
But at night it`s a different world
Go out and find the girl
Come on and dance all night
Despite the heat it will be alright

[Chorus:]
And baby don`t you know that you forget it
The day can be like the night
In the summer in the city
In the summer in the city

Cool town evening in the city
Dressed so fine and look so pretty
Cool cat lookin` for a kitty
Gonna look in every corner of the city
Till I reason like a bus stop

Running up the stairs, gonna meet you on the roof top
But night is a different world
Go out and find the girl
Come on come on let`s dance all the night
Despite the heat it will be all right

[Chorus]

But at night it`s a different world
Go out and find the girl
Come on and dance all night
Despite the heat it will be alright

[Chorus]

Hot town summer in the city then again a cool town
Evening in the city
Than the back of my neck gettin` dirty and gritty
Livin` in the city

In the summer town day
A cool town
A cool girl
Have fun
Evening in the city
