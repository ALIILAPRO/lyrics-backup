		<p>
		  파도가 치듯 밀려왔지
서로가 빠져 정신 못 차릴 만큼
불같이 다투기도 했지
우리 사랑도 재가 돼버릴만큼

I love you in a messed up way
It makes it difficult to find the words to say
There's not a better time or place

I think I need, think I need a little space
Between your name and my lips I need a space
I send your calls and your kisses outer space
I know I wanted a taste but my senses came back
Now I know I'ma need a little space
You put too much and too little on my plate
Don't wanna bе somebody you're gonna hate
I need your kеy to my place, we were movin' too fast
Now I know I'ma need a little space

I'ma need a little
I'ma need a little
We were moving too fast
Now I know I'ma need a little

I know you're heavy on my conscience
And there's nobody sleeping on your pillow side
If you're gonna be my constant
You've got a lot to figure out and so do I

I love you in a messed up way
It makes it difficult to find the words to say
There's not a better time or place

I think I need, think I need a little space
Between your name and my lips I need a space
I send your calls and your kisses outer space
I know I wanted a taste but my senses came back
Now I know I'ma need a little space
You put too much and too little on my plate
Don't wanna be somebody you're gonna hate
I need your key to my place, we were movin' too fast
Now I know I'ma need a little space

I'ma need a little (space)
I need your key to my place
We were moving too fast
Now I know I'ma need a little (space)
I'ma need a little (space)
I'ma need a little (space)
I'ma need a little (space, space)

I love you in a messed up way
It makes it difficult to find the words to say
There's not a better time or place

I think I need, think I need a little space
Between your name and my lips I need a space
I send your calls and your kisses outer space
I know I wanted a taste but my senses came back
Now I know I'ma need a little space
You put too much and too little on my plate
Don't wanna be somebody you're gonna hate (gon' hate, gon' hate)
I need your key to my place, we were movin' too fast
Now I know I'ma need a little space

I need a little space
Ooh, oh
