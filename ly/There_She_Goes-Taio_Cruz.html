		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There she goes looking like a star
With her body shaped like a rock guitar
There she goes like a shooting star
Make you wanna play
Makes all the boys them say

Redone, Taio Cruz, Mr. worldwide

Yeah, the way her body moving like a hurricane
Thought I knew what sexy was but uhuh that just changed
She's a pop star, rock star
Fighter, lover
She knows exactly what she's doing, I think she's a pro
When she's walking to the room she make sure that she know
She's a thriller, killer
Dance floor filler

There she goes looking like a star
With her body shaped like a rock guitar
There she goes like a shooting star
Make you wanna play
Makes all the boys them say

There she goes

Yeah she'll grab you by the hair and make you scream and shout
She'd like to chew you up and then she'll spit you out
She's a pop star, rock star
Fighter, lover
Oh no don't think that girl a lighter, she don't give a what
Yeah she likes to play with fire and she burns it up
She's a thriller, killer
Dance floor filler

There she goes looking like a star
With her body shaped like a rock guitar
There she goes like a shooting star
Make you wanna play
Makes all the boys them say

There she goes

There she goes looking like a star
With her body shaped like a rock guitar
There she goes like a shooting star
Make you wanna play
Makes all the boys them say

There she goes
