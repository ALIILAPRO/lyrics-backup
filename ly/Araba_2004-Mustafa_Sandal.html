		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All I know 
Is everything is not as it seems
But the more I grow the less I know
And I have lived so many lives
Though I'm not old
And the more I see, the less I grow
The fewer the seeds the more I sow

Then I see you standing there
Wanting more from me
And all I can do is try
Then I see you standing there
Wanting more from me
And all I can do is try
Try

I wish I hadn't seen all of the realness
And all the real people, are really not real at all
The more I learn, the more I learned
The more I cry the more I cried
As I say goodbye to the way of life
I thought I had designed for me

Then I see you standing there
Wanting more from me
And all I can do is try
Then I see you standing there
I'm all I'll ever be
And all I can do is try,
Try
 
All of the moments that already passed already passed
We'll try to go back and make them last
All of the things we want each other to be

We never will be, we never will be
And that's wonderful, that's life
That's you baby
This is me baby 
We are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are
Free
In our love 
We are free in our love

Try
