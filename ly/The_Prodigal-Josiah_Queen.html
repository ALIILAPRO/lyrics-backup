		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been sick and tired
Of being sick and tired
Searching far and wide
For something that feels real
I need something real
I don't want to lose my soul
Chasing after things that don't lead
Me straight to you
I'm lost in the feeling
That I ain't from this world
Going Back to Eden
Ain't gonna be easy
But it leads me straight to you
Now I'm running home
Like the Prodigal
I don't need the money
I don't want the fame
I don't want what I can't take
With me in the grave
I don't want to lose my soul
Chasing after things that don't lead
Me straight to you
I'm lost in the feeling
That I ain't from this world
Going Back to Eden
Ain't gonna be easy
But it leads me straight to you
Now I'm running home
Like the Prodigal
I don't want to lose my soul
Chasing after things that don't lead
Me straight to you
I don't want to lose my gaze
When I meet you face to face
Well done, welcome home
Now I'm running home,
Like the prodigal
I'm lost in the feeling
that I ain't from this world
The Going Back to Eden
Ain't gonna be easy
But it leads me straight to you
Now I'm running home
Like the Prodigal
Lost in the feeling
That I ain't from this world
The Going Back to Eden
Ain't gonna be easy
But it leads me straight to you
Now I'm running home
Like the Prodigal
