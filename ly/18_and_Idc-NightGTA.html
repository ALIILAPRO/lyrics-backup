		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Pump, pump, pump it up
Pump, pump, pump it up
Pump, pump, pump it up
Pump, pump it up, pump, pump it up

So boy, I′ll be your woman now
cnd in just about half a hour
I'll be kissing you a thousand times
But I want more from you

You know what it could be
Yes, I wish we spend the night together
This has been my greatest dream forever
If I only knew what′s waiting for me
That's why I, I want to tell you

Well, tonight I turn eighteen
Now I know just what you mean
You can kiss me everywhere
I'm eighteen and I don′t care


Well, tonight I turn eighteen
I′m no longer seventeen
In the car or on the stairs
You can have me anywhere

ct the party we will dance for hours
Luckily my friends now left the power
Say goodbye and leave for good
Now it's down to us, just you and me

We are alone looking at each other
My friends are gone
I don′t know why are such a bother
Mom and Dad no longer rule my world
Now I want to have it all

Well, tonight I turn eighteen
Now I know just what you mean
You can kiss me everywhere
I'm eighteen and I don′t care

Well, tonight I turn eighteen
I'm no longer seventeen
In the car or on the stairs
You can have me anywhere


Well, tonight I turn eighteen
Now I know just what you mean
You can kiss me everywhere
I′m eighteen and I don't care

Well, tonight I turn eighteen
I'm no longer seventeen
In the car or on the stairs
You can have me anywhere

Yes, I wish I spend a night together
This has been my greatest dream forever
If I only knew what′s waiting for me
That′s why I, I want to tell you

Well, tonight I turn eighteen
Now I know just what you mean
You can kiss me everywhere
I'm eighteen and I don′t care

Well, tonight I turn eighteen
I'm no longer seventeen
In the car or on the stairs
You can have me anywhere

Pump it up, pump, pump it up

Well, tonight I turn eighteen
Now I know just what you mean
You can kiss me everywhere
I′m eighteen and I don't care

Well, tonight I turn eighteen
I′m no longer seventeen
In the car or on the stairs
You can have me anywhere
