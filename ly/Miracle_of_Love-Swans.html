		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She holds a key to the room down there
And I, I will follow, but I'll never fall in
Yeah, we'll suffer for nothing, and we'll never forgive
God said to no one to do what he did

One second in your presence is a miracle of love
One second denied is a miracle of love

The young man is weakness in a lover's disguise
The woman is strong in her warm-bitter lies
How will they hope what they can never percieve
And how do they love what they fail to decieve

One second in your memory is a miracle of lies
One heartbeat in your body is a miracle of love
White light on a black sky is a miracle from above
One lonely moment in your arms is a miracle of love
