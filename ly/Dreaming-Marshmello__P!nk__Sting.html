		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Will you stay with me? Will you be my love
As the days get longer?
Will you follow me, never let me go?

Let's keep dreamin'
Dreamin' as the sun goes down
Stars are dancin'
Dancin' as the world turns 'round

When it's said and done, I'll keep holdin' on
Even in the silence
I can hear your voice through all of the noise
Yeah, yeah

We'll keep dreamin'
Dreamin' 'til the sun goes down, hey
We'll keep dancin'
Dancin' as our world turns 'round and 'round and 'round and 'round

Dreamin' 'til the sun goes down

I will stay with you, I will be your love
As the nights get longer
I will follow you, never let you go

Yeah, I keep dreamin'
Dreamin' 'til the sun comes out, hey
Stars are dancin'
Dancin' as the world turns 'round and 'round and 'round and 'round

Hey, oh
We'll keep dreamin' (keep on dreamin')
Keep on dreamin' (dreamin' 'til the sun goes down)
Keep on dreamin'

Oh
Keep on dreamin' on, keep on dreamin' on, oh
Stars are dancin'
Dancin' as the world turns 'round and 'round and 'round and 'round

Hey, oh
We'll keep dreamin' (keep on dreamin')
Keep on dreamin' on, oh
Let's keep dreamin' (keep on dreamin')
Dreamin' as the sun goes down
Keep on dreamin'
