		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I pay no mind khelit koulchi wraya gotta focus on my ride
Blurry vision west tri9i looking for some light
I pay no mind, I'll be alright

I don't know, yeah
Holding up my beer and my tears
I don't know, yeah
Oh my God, I fear what I feel
I'm caught below, yeah
Wish it wasn't real
Gotta heal my paranoia
I'll be alright

Digging my grave, sucker for pain
Njoum li fou9i, too many friends
I feel the blessings on me
I put my glasses on, wesh ri 7na li 7assin
Hna koulchi plastic ri kichoufo s3ib yefehmou ach tari
Nefs li matet kat9eleb ela zahri
Kola merra kanjri hareb Lwe9t kizid kis3ab
Ri m3a rassi kandareb F'kola merra kanzid taff
If I want it I got it 7yati rasemha f dehri
Kankteb la do tfa Brosky hadshi iconic

I can wait wakha ysali ga3 l3mer
Ghanb9a ndir dakchi li baghi no, I pay no mind
Khelit koulchi wraya gotta focus on my ride
Blurry vision west tri9i looking for some light
I pay no mind, I'll be alright

I don't know, yeah
Holding up my beer and my tears
I don't know, yeah
Oh my God, I fear what I feel
I'm caught below, yeah
Wish it wasn't real
Gotta heal my paranoia
I'll be alright

Love songs got me cooked up
Yeah, rooftops, endless spots
I'm so high, I've been lying, I'm not fine
I'm locked up in my room now
I'm fucked up, I've been told
Yeah, that love could be rough
But I still dived
Baby, I know you left 'cause this is no place to be
Could use a hand I'm drowning in my mind
It's getting deep
Baby, I know you left 'cause this is no place to be
Could use a hand I'm drowning in my mind
It's getting deep

Drinking all these shots, think I lost my way
Been breaking all these hearts, I'm bored, yeah, okay
Grinding like non stop
It's gonna payback one day
With an arrow on my back, yeah
You shot then ran way
They say we always fall off
To stay down on our knees
I know you always doubted me
Now I just want peace
Let's just not start war
No need to be enemies
We got so much memories
We got so much memories

I pay no mind khelit koulchi wraya gotta focus on my ride
Blurry vision west tri9i looking for some light
I pay no mind, I'll be alright

I don't know, yeah
Holding up my beer and my tears
I don't know, yeah
Oh my god, I fear what I feel
I'm caught below, yeah
Wish it wasn't real
Gotta heal my paranoia
I'll be alright

I pay no mind khelit koulchi wraya gotta focus on my ride
Blurry vision west tri9i looking for some light
I pay no mind, I'll be alright
