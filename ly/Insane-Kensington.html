		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (ooh) a seat on the stand
As you're causing a row
There to proof again that I am
Just there in both the wrong time and the wrong place

(ooh) I plead innocent
But you're dragging me down
Down a road where I know I can't
Get time to raise up my guard for you, can't wait

'Til I cave

It's not the words
Not the fear or the doubt
Not the lack of heart that takes me out
It's the knowing that you can't relate
When you're insane

Scenes of distress
They follow me around
'Til I lose again and by then
(You might be calm but my head will explode)
I'm out of moves here
I swallow it down
Like a poison undefined that
Enters my veins like a thread that I can't shake

'Til I cave

It's not the words
Not the fear or the doubt
Not the lack of heart that takes me out
It's the knowing that you can't relate
When you're insane

It's not the pain
Not the bruise or the scar
Not the lack of love that breaks me down
It's the knowing that you can't refrain
'Cause you're insane

I know I wait too long
Before I will break a bond
I know my body froze
My greatest loss

It's not the words (not the words)
Not the fear or the doubt
Not the lack of heart that takes me out
It's the knowing that you can't relate
When you're insane

It's not the pain (not the pain)
Not the bruise or the scar
Not the lack of love that breaks me down
It's the knowing that you can't refrain
'Cause you're insane
