		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  - We've gone too far. We need... we haven't really got anywhere.
- Anyway, we've gotta go much further out.
- We have to go much further... much further back, and faster.
- Wait a minute.
From the film Performance:
- You've got it! You've got the gift!
- ??? energy ???

From Charles Laughton's narration of Night of the Hunter:
See his hands
Look at the fingers
See his hands

See his hands
Look at the fingers
See his hands
See his hands
See his hands
Tattooed fingers
Tattooed fingers, hate

See his hands
Look at the fingers
Fingers of the left hand spell love
See his hands
Look at the fingers
Those of the right hand spell hate
The fingers of the left hand, love
The fingers of the left hand, love hate
Those of the right hand, hate
Those of the right hand, hate love
