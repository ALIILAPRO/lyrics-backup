		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm trying to fall honey
But I always end up running away from you
It's the only thing I know how to do
Your song's in my head honey
I like that you think I'm funny
When I'm not really trying to be

So what can I tell you
It's nothing about you
One second I need you
And then I'm running away again

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

I like that you wish you were older
You like leaving marks on my shoulders
But I don't mind
I know that you just want to be mine

But what can I tell you
It nothing about you
One second I need you
And then I'm running away again
Then I'm running away again 

And it's not your fault, honey
It's not you, it's me, really
But I'm gonna try for you
Yeah, I'm gonna try for you

And it's not your fault, honey
It's not you, it's me, really
But I'm gonna try for you
Yeah, I'm gonna try for you
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
