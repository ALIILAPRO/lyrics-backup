		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If things were different, we were young
Skinny dipping, having fun, I remember
Back in 1991, when the story first begun, I remember (I remember)
All of these shells, holding the things I've done
I knew myself before I knew anyone

And cause we all chew gum, we all have fun with water guns
La da da da da da, da da dum dum dum
And we all grew up, shit got tough
Shit just wasn't simple enough

And whenever the sun came out, we played
(We didn't want to get older, we didn't want to get older)
We would run on the block all night and day
(We didn't want to get older)

What a mistake, saying the way I felt
I say my name influences myself
And cause I started young, I learned it done, I didn't run
La da da da da da
I was scared as fuck and out of touch, and I was still testing my luck, oh

And whenever the sun came out, we played
(We didn't want to get older, we didn't want to get older)
We would run on the block all night and day
(We didn't want to get older, we didn't want to get older)
And whenever the sun came out, we played
(We didn't want to get older, we didn't want to get older)
I left myself in the alleyway

If things were different, we were young
Skinny dipping, having fun, I remember
(I left myself in the alleyway)
All I wanted would become everything I ever loved, I remember
(I left myself in the alleyway)
