		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm vibin' out right on the West
Just like a server get shot in your chest
Sippin' on syzzurp, y'all nigga's pests
Fly like a bizzird but I'm a snake
(vibin' out right on the West)
You born from pain
Oh, she out snitchin'
Don't care 'bout you're stain
So give and you gain (player)

Shut the door, yeah, recording in progress
Sippin' syrup but I ain't even cough yet
Box of money and we tap in like faucet
We ain't gon' talk 'bout that shit I ain't bought yet
Heard 'em haulin' but I'm steady ballin'
And my brother trap beatin' like it boxing (blrrrd)
Steady fightin' these demons, get off me
If I let down that window get on (blrrrd-blrrrd)

Jackboy the jack save Ps
I'm tryna get in my bag y'all
Never said this shit was easy
Choppa soundin' off break ya speakers (Hood Baby)
Been tag her round with no beamer (tag)
Everything I cop gotta beam (woo)
Big 5 turn to a scene (Big 5)
Turn a nigga to Alicia Keys

Clean out the spot like some Draino
Henny Trackhawk, nigga asking, "Where the brake go?"
Livin' life ruthless, pourin' fours in a Faygo
Niggas steady rappin' 'bout the shit they ain't on
Weigh it up 12 o'clock, how we get paint on 'em (12 o'clock)
Youngin' catchin' bodies only thang make the pain gone
Baked out, nigga, tweaked out like Fabo (woo)
They on a nigga trail gotta lay low (Gotit)

Shut the door, yeah, recording in progress (player)
Sippin' syrup but I ain't even cough yet (syzzurp)
Box of money and we tap in like faucet (faucet)
We ain't gon' talk 'bout that shit I ain't bought yet (I ain't bought yet)
Heard 'em haulin' but I'm steady ballin'
And my brother trap beatin' like it boxing (my brother trap beatin')
Steady fightin' these demons, get off me
If I let down that window get on (blrrrd)

Never been a ho gotta show me (totally)
Yeah, you don't know me (pussy)
Pop sippin' light, he my OG (pops)
31M cop a Rollie (Rollie)
Pussy-ass niggas be police
Slippin' through they hands and they know they can't hold me
Top shelf weed we ain't smokin' on no OG (top shelf)
Got it on 'cause the drip payin' my cozy (Gotit)

Woo
Fuck it let's shoot off the roof
She fuckin' forever, boy, that ain't ya boo (fuckin' forever)
Cut off a duck then she turned to a goose (yeah)
Mike Amiri jeans, some Rick Owens boots (Mike Amiri jeans)
Spittin' out bullets like I lost a tooth
You get pooped in the hoodie don't play with lil' dude
They want my dogs and they need some food
Told 'em I got 'em, just don't lose ya cool

Shut the door, yeah, recording in progress
Sippin' syrup but I ain't even cough yet
Box of money and we tap in like faucet (yeah)
We ain't gon' talk 'bout that shit I ain't bought yet (nah)
Heard 'em haulin' but I'm steady ballin' (nah, nah, nah)
And my brother trap beatin' like it boxing 
Steady fightin' these demons, get off me (yeah)
If I let down that window get on
