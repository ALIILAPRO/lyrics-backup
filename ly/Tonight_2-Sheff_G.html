		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Them tryna fuckin' touch me
Them don't really know how this fuckin' sound, dawg
You get what I'm sayin', dawg?
Now listen, ha-ha-ha
Yo, man do the ting
Yo, run the ting, G

Hey, bang, bang, bang
With the gang, gang, gang
Fuck with the gang, gang, gang, gang
Hey, hey-hey, ayy, ayy
Hey-uh, hey-uh, hey-uh, hey-uh
M8V3N, M8V3N gang
That's shoota, shoota, that's shoota gang
Shoota gang-gang-gang-gang
M8V3N, M8V3N gang
That's shoota, shoota, that's shoota gang (look, look)
Shoota gang-gang-gang-gang

Look, tonight, huh, we makin' movies (mm)
Look, tonight, huh, we feelin' moody (mm)
Look, tonight, huh, I'm tryna turn up, can't feel no fear
Tonight, huh, we gettin' lit tonight, we lit tonight (yeah)
Tonight, huh, won't be smoke but I need that bread
Tonight, huh, I got a big Glock, please don't move scary
Tonight, huh, I'm tryna turn up, can't feel no fear
Tonight, huh, we gettin' lit tonight, we lit tonight (yeah)

Look, Sumo (Sumo)
My pockets fat like a Sumo, yeah
You know, she could get one like a UNO, yeah
Henny keep changin' my mood though, yeah
These bitties watchin' me, I call up gang
Tell 'em, "Bring the body, no two-door" (gang, gang, gang, gang)
I step in the spot but they clear out the room
I feel disrespect then brrt the boom, huh, huh
Know how we move, we can't get in with it, then we don't perform, huh, look
Stick it and move, the gang really with it, they spray like perfume, huh, huh
Inhale the fumes, 'cause we stink up the room, shittin' on you, uh

Look, tonight, huh, we makin' movies (mm)
Look, tonight, huh, we feelin' moody (mm)
Look, tonight, huh, I'm tryna turn up, can't feel no fear
Tonight, huh, we gettin' lit tonight, we lit tonight (yeah)
Tonight, huh, won't be smoke but I need that bread
Tonight, huh, I got a big Glock, please don't move scary
Tonight, huh, I'm tryna turn up, can't feel no fear
Tonight, huh, we gettin' lit tonight, we lit tonight (yeah)
