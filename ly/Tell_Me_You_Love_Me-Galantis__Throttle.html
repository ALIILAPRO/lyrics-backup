		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I, I've been up all week
Not getting any sleep, trying to read the signs
I don't know how much more I can take
How much longer I can wait before I lose my mind
You, for heavens sake, you take my breath away
When you're not even trying
You got me wondering why, oh
What if you were mine?

Oh, baby, come on and say it now
Just let the words come out
(Tell me you love me)
It's easy, to say what's on your mind
Say it a million times
(Tell me you love me)

Tell me, tell me, uh
Tell me you love me
Tell me, tell me, uh
Tell me, tell me, tell me

Come on, I know it's way too soon
But I waited for you, I think that's long enough
So long to all those lonely nights, battles and picking fights
It's already evening night, I can't believe my eyes
How on earth did I find myself so full in love
We could be the perfect match
And what's so wrong with that? Mm

Oh, baby, come on and say it now
Just let the words come out
(Tell me you love me)
It's easy, to say what's on your mind
Say it a million times
(Tell me you love me)

Oh, baby, come on and say it now
Just let the words come out
(Tell me you love me)
It's easy, to say what's on your mind
Say it a million times
(Tell me you love me)

Tell me, tell me, uh
Tell me you love me
Tell me, tell me, uh
Tell me, tell me, tell me
