		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let go, it's over
Chances ran out along the line
Let go forever
The love that we shared had faded in time
Let's pipe it up, let's go, yeah
Come on, come on, come on, come all
Let's go (let go)
Tru
Pretty pussy havin' ass, ha
Toni

I'm like "Who you gettin' mad at?" Gon' and send the address
You know you deserve the Pretty Pussy Award
I'm cold like the climate, once I get behind it
You know you deserve the Pretty Pussy Award (uh)

I like it when it's waxed now, Toni with the facts now (facts)
Late night, waffle house, we got matchin' hash browns
You got that stage presence, you say you schoolin' these hoes
Gon' and teach a lesson (teach 'em)
My plane land at six, you got the landin' strip (strip)
You like to take a bubble bath with the candle lit (lit)
You can tell I'm the man by the manuscript (yeah)
You know I play with the clit like a instrument (let go)
I like that splash sound (splash)
That squeaky shit, you can hear it in the background
Sound like I'm stirrin' mac and cheese in your lap now (lap)
I hit is missionary, then I turn it back 'round (facts now)

I'm like "Who you gettin' mad at?" Gon' and send the address
You know you deserve the Pretty Pussy Award (yeah)
I'm cold like the climate, once I get behind it
You know you deserve the Pretty Pussy Award (yeah)

Who you gettin' mad at? We ain't finna have that
Your pretty pussy perfect, pristine, pure, pecan that
Diggin' and I'm searchin' like fiends lookin' in trash bags
Pump it 'til I squirt gasoline all on her gas mask
You deserve some hand claps, see through dress, Saran wrap
No pantyhose, my hair wet, camel toe, giraffe neck
Play that ho like Grand Theft, it's not a game, she pop my chain
I pop the painkillers, she pop that pussy until papa came
Pretty Pussy Award, juicy, gushy couture
Booty softer than Velor, I fuck her until she snore
Aw sooki, lookin' into her eyes
As they sparkle, I arrive
Treat the clit just like the red carpet

I'm like "Who you gettin' mad at?" Gon' and send the address
You know you deserve the Pretty Pussy Award (yeah, you got it)
I'm cold like the climate (yeah), once I get behind it (hey)
You know you deserve the Pretty Pussy Award

Look, only thing better than pussy is new pussy
And the only thing beat new pussy is two pussies
Heard that thing squirtin' and shit, Fruit Gushers
And I had to make sure it went down, two flushes
Yeah, that ass look soft as a couch, two cushions
And that mouth like a Slurpee machine, blue slushie
Red slushie, that brain, have 'em payin' tuition
Every nigga want some of that P that you pushin' (let go)
I don't wanna give you, I just wanna award you
I don't wanna buy you, I just wanna reward you
So you can let them hoes know who the winner is
I said, let them hoes know who the winner is

I'm like "Who you gettin' mad at?" Gon' and send the address
You know you deserve the Pretty Pussy Award (yeah, yeah)
I'm cold like the climate (yeah), once I get behind it (yeah)
You know you deserve the Pretty Pussy Award (yeah)

Let go
