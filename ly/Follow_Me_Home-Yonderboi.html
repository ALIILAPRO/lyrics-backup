		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh well the sun go down 
 Celebration in the town tonight 
 All day long 
 They been slaughtering upon the stone 
 Share out the meat 
 Yeah, you really like to eat 
 Now come on man come follow me home. 
  
 Follow me home... 
  
 Well, the priest he cries 
 Virgins ascending to the skies tonight 
 All day long 
 I have passed my time alone 
 And when the church bell rung 
 I stayed out on the tower 
 In a dying sun 
 Now come on man come follow me home. 
  
 Follow me home... 
  
  
 Well I don't need no priest 
 But I love all of the people 
 Yes I share the feast 
 So drink up my wine 
 Yes and the song in my bones 
 I know the way 
 I can see by the moonlight 
 Clear as the day 
 Now come on man, come follow me home. 
  
 Follow me home...
