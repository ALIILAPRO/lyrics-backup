		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's hard not to when I'm around you
How could I even say thank you?
How could I even describe it?
There is truly nothing like it
Anything, want you to have it
Anything that I can manage
Everything is really pointless
Without you, I can't be content
You stayed down when I lost my confidence
You be with me in my ambulance
Life is life and things will happen
Things that we couldn't imagine

You're too good to me
You're too good for me
Kiss, kiss, kiss, a fantasy
Lay down with me, Valerie
Steady, my hand is shaking
Uh, uh, uh, uh, no temptation
Steady, my hand is shaking (oh)
You made it this far, amazing
You're too good to me
Kiss, kiss, kiss, a fantasy

When you wish upon a star
You're too good to me
You're too good for me
Kiss, kiss, kiss, a fantasy
Lay down with me, Valerie

It's hard not to when I'm around you
How could I even say thank you?
How could I even describe it?
There is truly nothing like it
Anything, want you to have it
Anything that I can manage
Everything is really pointless
Without you, I can't be content
You stayed down when I lost my confidence
You be with me in my ambulance
Life is life and things will happen
Things that we couldn't imagine

You're too good to me
You're too good for me
Kiss, kiss, kiss, a fantasy
Lay down with me, Valerie
