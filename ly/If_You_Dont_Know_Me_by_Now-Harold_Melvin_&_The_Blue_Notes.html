		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you don't know me by now
You will never never never know me (oh)

All the things that we've been through
You should understand me like I understand you
Now baby I know the difference between right and wrong
I ain't gonna do nothing to upset our happy home
Oh don't get so excited when I come home a little late at night
'Cause we only act like children when we argue fuss and fight

If you don't know me by now (if you don't know me)
You will never never never know me (you'll never, never know me)
If you don't know me by now(if you don't, if you don't know me baby)
You will never never never know me(No you won't)

We've all got our own funny moods
I've got mine, woman you've got yours too
Just trust in me like I trust in you
As long as we've been together it should be so easy to do
Just get yourself together or we might as well say goodbye
What good is a love affair when you can't see eye to eye, oh

If you don't know me by now (if you don't, if you don't know me baby)
You will never never never know me (hey hey, hey hey, hey hey)
If you don't know me by now (you will never never never know me)
You will never never never know me (oh)
