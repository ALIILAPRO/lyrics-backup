		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  They say ona ona,
ima ima be a star uh huh
uh huh, 
I stack my comma
mix my nike & ferragamo
They say ona ona,
ima ima be a star uh huh
uh huh, 
I stack my comma
mix my nike & ferragamo

Oh my oh my god i'mma star i'mma star,
Oh my god whipping hummer cars comin' hella hard,
(uh) I get the applause got the bars and broads,
(ah huh ah huh) We don't need no keys we push that shit to start

It's Mr Martyr
Bitches call me Father
Pulled up eatin pasta
and pasata
She Want Enchiladda
Bitch just Call up Carter

Like lil bitch,
you can't get an inch
whats the fucking biz,
Hold up wait yeah sophiya tell these pussies how it is

Who do it better? 
I want the cheese and the cream and the cheddar, vegemite spread her,
I am a star I took ur bitch for some business and pleasure all at my leisure,
She wanna come to my yard (uh) but I won't let her, I don't fuck bitches, I just get money for ever and ever, I'm onto bigger endeavours (they say, they say)

They say ona ona,
ima ima be a star uh huh
uh huh, 
I stack my comma
mix my nike & ferragamo
They say ona ona,
ima ima be a star uh huh
uh huh, 
I stack my comma
mix my nike & ferragamo

Mix my Nike and Ferrigamo, I'm on the come up,
Lil mama wanna wanna lick lick lick like me then go smoke some marijuanna,
Cook it up, whip it up, drip too hard she lick it up
We straight to bank and cleanin' up, I got the sauce she eat it up,
Sophiya and Martyr, there's nobody harder,
We cook it like pasta, (yeh) this one's a charter,
We big with the step and big on the web but no Peter Parker, who movin' faster? (uh)
Bitch like what the fuck? Oh my god I get the applause, Gotta know who you are if you wanna fuck a star (they say)

They say ona ona,
ima ima be a star uh huh
uh huh, 

uh huh uh huh
bitch I been the don

make you pussys mad
did it on my own
LIKE LIL BITCH
STOMPIN ON A PUSSY BRIDGE
BREAKIN NECKS
I GOT RICH OFF A NIKE SONG THATS WHAT YOU CALL A CHECK CHEQUE

They say ona ona,
ima ima be a star uh huh
uh huh, 
I stack my comma
mix my nike & ferragamo
They say ona ona,
ima ima be a star uh huh
uh huh, 
I stack my comma
mix my nike & ferragamo
