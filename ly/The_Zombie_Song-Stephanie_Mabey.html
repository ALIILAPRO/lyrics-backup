		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Our love story
Could be kinda gory
Far from boring
We'd meet at a post-apocalypse
Yeah, I'd be slowly walking
In a group stalking
You, you'd be the only man alive
That I could not resist

Then all of your friends
They'd try to kill us
But only because
They'd be jealous
That our love is deeper than
Edward and Bella's

If I were a zombie
I'd never eat your brain
I'd just want your heart
Yeah, I'd want your heart
I'd just want your heart
Yeah, oh
If I were a zombie
I'd never eat your brain
I'd just want your heart
Yeah, I'd want your heart
I'd just want your heart
'Cause I want ya

You'd be hiding in
A second floor apartment
Knocking all the stairs down to save your life
From the undead
Double-barrel shotgun
Taking out the slow ones
Then you'd see the passion burning in my eye
And I'd keep my head

Then all of your friends
They'd try to kill us
But only because
They'd be jealous
That our love is deeper than
Edward and Bella's

If I were a zombie
I'd never eat your brain
I'd just want your heart
Yeah, I'd want your heart
I'd just want your heart
Yeah, oh
If I were a zombie
I'd never eat your brain
I'd just want your heart
Yeah, I'd want your heart
I'd just want your heart
'Cause I want ya

And I'd try not to bite and infect you
Because I'd respect you too much
Yeah, that's why I'd wait until we got married
Oh, and our happiest days would be spent
Picking off all your friends
And they'd see a love this deep won't stay buried

If I were a zombie
I'd never eat your brain
I'd just want your heart
Yeah, I'd want your heart
I'd just want your heart
Yeah, oh
If I were a zombie
I'd never eat your brain
I'd just want your heart
Yeah, I'd want your heart
I'd just want your heart
'Cause I want ya
