		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ay, Royce you did it right here
Ay, we takin' over 2k18 on my momma nigga

In the back wit' my niggas, off the Xan we might act up
Kamikaze, 'cause you know we all strapped up
Your bitch she want me, 'cause she seen a nigga stacked up
But I can't keep her, I just want to be the back up
Wit' my niggas, off the Xan we might act up
Kamikaze, 'cause you know we all strapped up
Your bitch she want me, 'cause she seen a nigga stacked up
But I can't keep her, I just want to be the back up

Now I'm in the 'Rari switching lanes
Pull up to the street and they all know my name
Now I got this bread and my VV chain swang
I was just broke, steady looking for some stains
And my little brother Midget, free my nigga out the cage
Sellin' drugs and I get it ask your bitch, I'm getting paid
And I'm in a Mazi 'cause I crashed the fucking Range
And I see your bitch 'cause I'm better than your main

In the back wit' my niggas, off the Xan we might act up
Kamikaze, 'cause you know we all strapped up
Your bitch she want me, 'cause she seen a nigga stacked up
But I can't keep her, I just want to be the back up
Wit' my niggas, off the Xan we might act up
Kamikaze, 'cause you know we all strapped up
Your bitch she want me, 'cause she seen a nigga stacked up
But I can't keep her, I just want to be the back up

Yeah, you know I'm in that brand new space coupe
Hop up out a van like, "nigga, what it do"
I just fucked yo' bitch then I kick her out my room
And I'm in a fast car nigga Vroom, Vroom
I be wearing Louis V down 'cause I flex hard
Posted wit' my niggas sippin' Wockhardt
And we don't give a fuck we got a cold heart
Running through the money nigga, that part

In the back wit' my niggas, off the Xan we might act up
Kamikaze, 'cause you know we all strapped up
Your bitch she want me, 'cause she seen a nigga stacked up
But I can't keep her, I just want to be the back up
Wit' my niggas, off the Xan we might act up
Kamikaze, 'cause you know we all strapped up
Your bitch she want me, 'cause she seen a nigga stacked up
But I can't keep her, I just want to be the back up
