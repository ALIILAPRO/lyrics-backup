		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Make me feel something, anything
I've been on for a while now please
And I don't know if it's killing me 
But all these vices make me feel nothing
I'm tired of suffering, I take what you're offering
You're sweeter than wine, must be design, you make me feel something
So, put your hands all over me, yeah
Start to kiss me tenderly, yeah
Can you keep this energy while we exploit this chemistry?
I can't take my eyes off you, baby
Oju n'ro mi o
Must be the time, must be design
You make me feel something (yeah)

I'm searching for energy, searching for feelings inside
Searching for moments when you need something to inspire
Searching for love, that was a search that made me tired
Searching for self but that's the hardest one to find
I was on road, on street, unleashed
Front seat, bad girl, run street
I was so cold outside, pulse weak
When the situation got too intense, I just free omo
I'm searching for bread
I'm tryna make the millions that will push me ahead
I know I should be searching for my passion instead
But that's a road less-travelled and I wasn't prepared
But somehow I found it
Maybe 'cause the vibes are outstanding 
Or the grace pours out like a fountain
I'm moving these mountains
Had so many blessings on the way
At some point, man, I had to stop counting

Make me feel something, anything
I've been on for a while now please
And I don't know if it's killing me 
But all these vices make me feel nothing
I'm tired of suffering, I take what you're offering
You're sweeter than wine, must be design, you make me feel something
So, put your hands all over me, yeah
Start to kiss me tenderly, yeah
Can you keep this energy while we exploit this chemistry?
I can't take my eyes off you, baby
Oju n'ro mi o
Must be the time, must be design
You make me feel something

Tycoons in the flesh, calm, cool and collect
Whole crew's on the set, Azul on the deck
Take two to the chest then move to the girldem
Dark skin chocolate, smoother than velvet
Ex bug-a-boos, got the juice to repel them
It's flights over feelings, don't use the tail-end, huh
See the truth's what I sell them
If you're buying come roll with the flyest
Girl, you a riot, so I put the shield on
Still got scars from the past I ain't healed from
Heart turn cold but my soul yearns to feel more
For tonight I'm all yours though, real talk (real talk)
So can you match my energy?
The sweet nothings you whisper to ginger me
With true lies from my past life memories
Spark up my mind and

Make me feel something
So, put your hands all over me, yeah
Start to kiss me tenderly, yeah
Can you keep this energy while we exploit this chemistry?
I can't take my eyes off you, baby
Oju n'ro mi o
Must be the time, must be design
You make me feel something, yeah

That track was, "Feel Something"
And it feels real, real good to listen to good music, doesn't it?
It's Palm Wine Radio right here
1billion.1 FM
We're gonna keep the vibes rolling just like that 
(1billion.1 FM, Palm Wine Radio)
