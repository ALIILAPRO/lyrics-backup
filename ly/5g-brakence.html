		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby, don't be my crutch when this shit get gory
Got that radioactive touch, suffer purgatory
She heard the story, I been wearin' a demon
I've barely been eatin', I'm scrollin' all night
That's why I can't get to grieving
Baby, don't be my crutch when this shit get gory
Got that radioactive touch, suffer purgatory
She heard the story, I been wearin' a demon
I've barely been eatin', I'm scrollin' all night

Break it all down, like what does it mean to me? (Exclusive)
I got in this position so damn easily
Thank God I got good intentions, I got decency
But am I really a good person when I need to be?
I need to be, he put me on a pedestal and liked my tweets
I'm getting this tightness in my chest, it make me grind my teeth
So I'ma just take another edible and go 5G
Old friends, they hate me now, I'm never gonna find my feet

Always puttin' myself above you to feel important
No, I'm never gonna take that tab, I can't be rewarded
Go re-record it
I've been wearin' a demon, I've barely been eatin'
I'm scrollin' all night, that's why I can't get to grieving

Baby, don't be my crutch when this shit get gory
Got that radioactive touch, suffer purgatory
She heard the story, I been wearin' a demon
I've barely been eatin', I'm scrollin' all night (oh)
Don't be my crutch when this shit get gory
Got that radioactive touch, suffer purgatory
Nah, I'm never gon' need your love, I can feel supported
Got this feelin' in my gut, dread it every morning
Hate distortion

Eyes on a phone, brazen to get out my head all the shit I regret
Eyes on a phone, bring me in overtime and it's nothing but net
Eyes on a phone, face on an open mind, I can't budge at the feet
Eyes on a phone, they farmin' our retention like are you people?
(Eye, eye, eye), they're using us like a resource
That's when I start to think we're fucked, there ain't no recourse
I profit on keystrokes, playin' into it, feelin' my fate
Philosophical heat source, burnin' off anything that I'm taking
And when I die, I hope I'm buried in a forest
That is if any of us left, this shit is torrid
For now, I'm usin' up my gift to write a chorus

Always puttin' myself above you to feel important
No, I'm never gonna take that tab, I can't be rewarded
Go re-record it
I've been wearin' a demon, I've barely been eatin'
I'm scrollin' all night (ah)

Baby, don't be my crutch when you're sick and gory
Got that radioactive touch, suffer purgatory
She heard the story, I've been wearin' a demon
I've barely been eatin', I'm scrollin' all night
That's why I can't get to grieving

Break it all down, like what does it mean to me?
They layin' waste to a new biome
To make a case for the new iPhone
The waters laced and they know I know
Wearin' a demon, why I can't get to grieving, I-

Can't get to grieving, I (Hollywood)
Gotta repeat it, I (hollow)
Too busy dreaming, part of my, that's why I can't, that's why
A hypochondriac, I think of you blood pressure spikes
I'll have a heart attack, the things I do
