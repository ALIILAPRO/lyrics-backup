		  (Have you ever been to London?)
(Go Grizz')

Bounce back (bounce back)
Take a loss, nigga, get it right back (right back)
Look, she get tossed 'round movin' like that (like that)
Look, outside with the demons
Eliantte almost made me drown, but I'm breathin'
Huh? I had to lose to win
Then I told myself I'd never lose again
Huh? Never lose again
Made it out the bottom, nigga
Eliantte almost made me drown in this bitch, look

My whole team (huh?)
Sittin' courtside, not the nosebleeds (not the nosebleeds)
She right on my wood like Ginobli
All up on my wood like Ginobli
Your girl out in Hollywood where they know me (yeah)
Off a Adderall, I just hope I don't O.D. (O.D.)
If a nigga in your circle tell, that's a slow leak
Hard-headed wearin' ass nigga with the Chromies
Had to take the stairs to the top, where the light at?
Lookin' at the man in the mirror like I'm Mike Jack
I put Cartiers on her neck, and her ears, and her wrist
Got her lookin' like this

Shawty had to bounce back (bounce back)
Look, take a loss, nigga, get it right back (right back)
Look, she get tossed 'round movin' like that (like that)
Look, turned your girl into a demon
Eliantte almost made me drown, but I'm breathin'
Huh? I had to lose to win
Then I told myself I'd never lose again
Huh? Never lose again
Made it out the bottom, nigga
Eliantte almost made me drown in this bitch, look (ayy)

AP on my wrist, my jacket by CELINE
Water chokin', wanna stash, swear to God, I couldn't breathe
No plain Janes, water on me, puddles full of pain
Ain't the same, only bought 'em after drivin' this Wraith
Sayin' that I'll fall in love, they still say my name
Rockstar lifestyle, bitch, say my name (woo)
Oh, boy, only bought 'em drivin' this Rolls-Royce
Niggas tryna copy us but still don't sound the same
Look, damn, baby (damn, baby)
They gon' take my swag and I can't blame 'em (can't blame 'em)
Up for two days and then crash, baby (crash, baby)
Four platinum albums, do the math, baby
When you gettin' money, life is fast, baby
Count it up until I can't feel my fingers
Count it up again like I don't know my times tables
How I'm not gon' feel you? I ain't got no feelings
We go back to back in different Lambs, like, no
I don't talk behind the back of friends, like, no
Gotta keep it humble, but I don't wear Kenzo
All the girls I know, we know, and girls, I know
I don't wanna make no more mistakes no more
But I came here to take your bitch like I'm Tyrone
'Cause she changed up on me ever since she did lipo'
She changed up on me ever since she, look
Damn, baby, how you do me like that?

Bounce back
Take a loss, nigga, get it right back (right back)
Look, she get tossed 'round movin' like that (like that)
Look, turn your girl into a demon
Eliantte almost made me drown, but I'm breathin' (woo)
Huh? I had to lose to win
Then I told myself I'd never lose again
Huh? Never lose again
Made it out the bottom, nigga
Eliantte almost made me drown in this bitch, look
