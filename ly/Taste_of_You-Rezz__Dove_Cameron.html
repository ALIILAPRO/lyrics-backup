		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh, yeah

We started buzzing, blood was rushing, but it wasn't only to my head (head)
To my head (head, to my head)
You make me weaker, you're my keeper, pull me deeper, take me to the edge (edge)
And I jump in (in, I jump in)
All wrongs do me right, I dig my nails in dynamite
I might go off in the night and fend the fire

What am I supposed to do, but sink my teeth in you?
I starve without you on my lips, I die without the taste of it
What am I supposed to be when you sink your teeth in me?
'Cause I live for the way you move, I'd die without the taste of you

(Taste of you)
Ooh, yeah
(Taste of you)
Ooh, yeah

When you're away from me, I'm cravingly impatient, chained up to the bed (bed)
Inside my head (head, inside my head)
And I don't care, I'm a bitch if I'm not getting my addiction fed
I'll end up dead (end up dead)
All wrongs do me right, I dig my nails in dynamite
I might go off in the night and fend the fire

What am I supposed to do, but sink my teeth in you?
I starve without you on my lips, I die without the taste of it
What am I supposed to be when you sink your teeth in me?
'Cause I live for the way you move, I'd die without the taste of you

What am I supposed to do, but sink my teeth in you?
I starve without you on my lips, I die without the taste of it
What am I supposed to be when you sink your teeth in me?
'Cause I live for the way you move, I'd die without the taste of you

(Taste of you)
Ooh, yeah
(Taste of you)
Ooh, yeah
(Taste of you)
