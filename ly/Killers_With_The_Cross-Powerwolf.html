		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Credo in deum patrem omnipotentem
Creatorem caeli et terrae
Et in Iesum Christum, filium eius unicum
Dominum nostrum
Qui conceptus est de Spiritu Sancto

In the night came the killers with the cross

From the land of war and plague
Came the prophecies of fate
And the word of God was long forsaken
On the stone upon the grave
Told the glory of the brave
And their legacy was all forgotten
In the hands of heaven sent
Come to fight and to defend
By the word we praise the holy name

Ereum Dominae

In the night came the killers with the cross
In the light of the moon when our lives are lost
In the dark when your blood is calling
In the dusk when the fever's crawling
In the night came the killers with the cross

From their destiny they wake
Bring hypocrisy and hate
And the land of God had long been parted
Stand our ground for heaven's name
Out for mercy and for pain
By the dawn, we raise the glory flame

Ereum Dominae

In the night came the killers with the cross
In the light of the moon when our lives are lost
In the dark when your blood is calling
In the dusk when the fever's crawling
In the night came the killers with the cross

In the night came the killers with the cross
In the light of the moon when our lives are lost
In the dark when your blood is calling
In the dusk when the fever's crawling
In the night came the killers with the cross

In the night came the killers with the cross
(In the night came the killers with the cross)
In the light of the moon when our lives are lost
(In the light of the moon when our lives are lost)
In the dark when your blood is calling
In the dusk when the fever's crawling
Lost a life to the killers with the cross
(Lost a life to the killers with the cross)
In the light of the moon when our lives are lost
(In the light of the moon when our lives are lost)
In the dark when your blood is calling
In the dusk when the fever's crawling
In the night came the killers with the cross
