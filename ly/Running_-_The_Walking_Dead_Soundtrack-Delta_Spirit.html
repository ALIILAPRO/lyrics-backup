		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hold the light my love
Hold the light my love
Could you take enough
Hold the light my love
You know
I'm done
And I'm doomed
With a gun against my head
Gun against my head
Alone myself I stand
With a gun against my head
You know
I'm done
And I'm doomed
When I come running
When I come running
To you
When I kissed her she fell dead
Kissed her she fell dead
Did you hear a word I said
When I kissed her she was dead
You know
I'm done
And I'm doomed
When I come running
When I come running
When I come running
To you
When I come running
When I come running
When I come running
To you
