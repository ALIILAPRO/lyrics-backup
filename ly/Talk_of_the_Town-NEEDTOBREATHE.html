		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Blood red lipstick painted on
Lightin' up another sundown cigarette
The cameras ready, curtains drawn
Lights are on, the stage is set

Blindin' diamonds can't keep shinin' on your stolen crown
Sooner or later, we all know that plastic castles all fall down

I saw you fakin' a smile, take a lap in your gown
Lovin' yourself when there's no one around
Are you the talk of the town now?
Are you the talk of the town now?
And when you're sittin' alone, take a look at you now
You see your reflection, is it makin' you proud?
Are you the talk of the town now?
Are you the talk of the town now?
Are you the talk of the town?

Oh la, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la, la
Oh la, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la, la

Mornin' after, headache hits
Still no sign of last night's ghost at home
Is this what livin' really is?
Can't give away yourself if you want to be known

I saw you fakin' a smile, take a lap in your gown
Lovin' yourself when there's no one around
Are you the talk of the town now? (Are you the talk of the town?)
Are you the talk of the town now? (Are you the talk of the town?)
And when you're sittin' alone, take a look at you now
You see your reflection, is it makin' you proud?
Are you the talk of the town now? (Tell me, are you the talk of the town now?)
Are you the talk of the town now? (Ayy)
Are you the talk of the town? (Are you the talk of the town?)

Oh la, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la, la
Oh la, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la, la

Blindin' diamonds can't keep shinin' on your stolen crown
Sooner or later, we all know that plastic castles all fall down

I saw you fakin'
I saw you fakin' a smile, take a lap in your gown
Lovin' yourself when there's no one around
Are you the talk of the town now? (Are you the talk of the town?)
Are you the talk of the town now? (Are you the talk of the town?)
When you're sittin' alone, take a look at you now
You see your reflection, is it makin' you proud?
Are you the talk of the town now?
Are you the talk of the town now? (Tell somebody)
Are you the talk of the town? (Are you the talk of the town?)

Oh la, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la, la
(Are you the talk of the town?)
Oh la, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la, la
(Tell me, are you the talk?)
Oh la, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la, la 
(Woo, I can't see it, I can't see it)
Oh la, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la, la
(Are you the talk of the town?)
