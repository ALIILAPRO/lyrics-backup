		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's The Dreams,
That last,
A Thousand years...
Takes your soul,
and Leads you to your goal...

It's The Dreams,
That makes your life a Miracle...
Don't You know,
I'm never lettin' go...

Love and Hate...
(Love and Hate...)
Will Seize the day...
(Will Seize the day...)

Lonely Moment...
(Lonely Moment...)
Where thoughts, can pray...
(Where thoughts, can pray...)

I believe,
There comin' from the skies...
I believe,
Our love will never die...

'Cause It's The Dreams,
That last,
A Thousand years...
Takes your soul,
and Leads you to your goal...

It's The Dreams,
That makes your life a Miracle...
Don't You know,
I'm never lettin' go...

I'm full of greed...
(I'm full of greed...)
It's just grief...
(It's just a grief...)

Sacred places...
(Sacred places...)
Enslave the darkness...
(Enslave the darkness...)

I believe,
There comin' from the skies...
I believe,
Our love will never die...

'Cause It's The Dreams,
That last,
A Thousand years...
Takes your soul,
and Leads you to your goal...

It's The Dreams,
That makes your life a Miracle...
Don't you know,
I'm never lettin' go...

Oh------oh...

(In your Dreams...)
(In your Dreams...)
(In your Dreams...)

(You can fly..)
(You can fly..)

(Just Dream Away...)
(Just Dream Away...)
(Just Dream Away...)

(And kiss The Sky...)
(And kiss The Sky...)

'Cause It's The Dreams,
That last, A Thousand years...
Takes your soul,
and Leads you to your goal...

It's The Dreams,
That makes your life/ a Miracle...
(A Miracle...)
/So You know...
(So you know...)
/I'll never let it go...
(I'll Never let it go...)

Dont you know...
I'll never let it go...

Dont you know...(Know...)(Know...)(Know...)(Know...)
I'll never lettin' go...
(I'll never lettin' go...)
