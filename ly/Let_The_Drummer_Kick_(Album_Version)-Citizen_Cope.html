Relations (Apollo had to break 'em)
Creation (A gift, a blessing)
Incarceration (What keeps you down)
Determination (What gets you out)
Equation (When they said you could make it)
Humiliation (What you feel when they say it)
Reincarnation (N-A-V)
Situation (Why we've got to sing)
Elation (Let the drummer kick, so many in need)
Identification (Gives you the right to shoot)
Retaliation (What would it do)
Education (Gives you the right to choose)
Inspiration (Is what pulls you through)
No substitution (No subsitute)
Non-inclusion (You've got to bust through)
Drug infusion (For the chosen few)
Mass confusion (When they say that they died for you)
Solution (It can take a hold of you)
Conclusion
Inspiration (Is what pulls you through)

Let the drummer kick (Inspiration)
Let the drummer kick that (Inspiration)

Let the drummer kick
Let the drummer kick that

You don't even have to wait
You don't even have to wait

Let the drummer kick
Let the drummer kick that
