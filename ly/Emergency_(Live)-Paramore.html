		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I think we have an emergency
I think we have an emergency

If you thought I'd leave then you were wrong
'Cause I won't stop holding on

So are you listening?
So are you watching me?

If you thought I'd leave then you were wrong
'Cause I won't stop holding on

This is an emergency
So are you listening?

And I can't pretend that I don't see this

It's really not your fault
That no one cares to talk about it
To talk about it

'Cause I've seen love die
Way too many times
When it deserved to be alive 
When it deserved to be alive
I've seen you cry
Way too many times
When you deserved to be alive

Alive

So you give up every chance you get
Just to feel new again

I think we have an emergency
I think we have an emergency

And you do your best to show me love
But you don't know what love is

So are you listening?
So are you watching me?

Well, I can't pretend that I don't see this

It's really not your fault
That no one cares to talk about it
To talk about it?

'Cause I've seen love die
Way too many times
When it deserved to be alive 
When it deserved to be alive
I've seen you cry
Way too many times
When you deserved to be alive 

Alive

These scars, they will not fade away

No one cares to talk about it
To talk about it

'Cause I've seen love die
Way too many times
When it deserved to be alive 
When it deserved to be alive

I've seen you cry
Way too many times
When you deserved to be alive 

Alive
