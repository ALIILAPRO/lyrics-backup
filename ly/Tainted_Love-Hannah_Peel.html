		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sometimes I feel I've got to
Run away I've got to
Get away

From the pain that you drive
Into the heart of me
The love we share
Seems to go nowhere
And I've lost my light
For I toss and turn I can't sleep at night

Once I ran to you
Now I run from you
This tainted love you've given
I give you all a girl could give you
Take my tears and that's not nearly all

Tainted love
Tainted love

Now I know I've got to
Run away I've got to
Get away
You don't really want any more from me
To make things right
You need someone to hold you tight
And you think love is to pray
But I'm sorry I don't pray that way

Once I ran to you
Now I run from you
This tainted love you've given
I give you all a girl could give you
Take my tears and that's not nearly all

Tainted love, oh
Tainted love

Don't touch me please
I cannot stand the way you tease

Tainted love, oh
Tainted love
