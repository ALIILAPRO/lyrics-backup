		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can tell you've been crying (yeah)
I can tell when you're lying, I can see it on your face
I can hear it in the silence
That you don't know if we really have what it takes

All you ever needed was a meaning to the words that I said
But you didn't believe me when I told you that I loved you to death

Oh, I never meant to leave you crying in the rain
I tried
Said forever, now forever feels so far away
I tried
I had my own demons I was fighting, so I pushed you away
(Fighting, so I pushed you away, yeah)
Just know I never meant to leave you crying in the rain

Are you still undecided?
Are you still tryna find what you'll never replace?
No matter what, you won't find it (find it)
What if I told you I'm ready to change? (To change)

All you ever needed was a meaning to the words that I said (oh)
I wish you'd just believe me when I tell you that I love you to death

Oh, I never meant to leave you crying in the rain
I tried
Said forever, now forever feels so far away
I tried
I had my own demons I was fighting, so I pushed you away
(Fighting, so I pushed you away, yeah)
Just know I never meant to leave you crying in the rain
