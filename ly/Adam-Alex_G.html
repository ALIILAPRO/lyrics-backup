		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'll make a twenty dollar bet
Adam won't get his lunchbox back
I took it an hour ago
He's cryin' in the snow, I'll never let it go
I hope when Adam goes home
He hides it from his mom, he thinks of me alone
And when we're swimmin' at the Y
I'll splash him in the eye, I'll dunk him 'til he cries

I'll make a twenty dollar bet
Adam won't get his lunchbox back
I took it an hour ago
He's cryin' in the snow, I want him so
