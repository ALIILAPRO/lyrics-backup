		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Waves will catch you (oh)
Light will catch you (ooh)
Love will catch you
Spirit gon' catch you, yeah

Lying in reflections
Moonlight hits your skin
Safe in conversation
You question where I've been
Two bodies on this mattress (woo, yeah)
Save me as it sinks (woo, yeah)
Automatic self-protection (woo, yeah)
Like airbags in my limbs

Next thing I'm drifting into open sky
And I don't feel so scared
Dreaming with these open eyes
(Grabbing at the air)

Waves will catch you (oh)
Light will catch you (ooh)
Love will catch you (ooh)
Spirit gon' catch you, yeah
Faith will catch you
Friends will catch you
Time will catch you
Flash will capture us
Waves will catch you (oh)
Light will catch you (ooh)
Love will catch you (ooh)
Spirit gon' catch you, yeah
Faith will catch you
Friends will catch you
Time will catch you
Flash will capture us

Travelling for healing
(I been speaking, had to-, speak to myself)
How far will I go?
(Spirit, spirit, yeah)
Still wear that chain you gave me
That eagle made of gold

And now I'm drifting into open skies (yeah)
And I ain't scared as before
Ain't as scared as before

Waves will catch you
Light will catch you (ooh)
Love will catch you (ooh)
Spirit gon' catch you, yeah (spirit'll catch you)
Faith will catch you (faith will catch you)
Friends will catch you (friends with catch you)
Time will catch you
Flash will catch us
Waves will catch you (waves will)
Light will catch you
Love will catch you
Spirit gon' catch you, yeah
Faith will catch you
Friends will catch you
Time will catch you
Flash will capture us

(Like, is anybody out there?)
(Signals, messages)
(Spirit gon' catch you)

Just like Jonathan Livingston Seagull
Try catch the clouds and I free fall
I was caught by the wings of my people
Then you pick me up in your two-door (yeah)
Hit the country roads, peaceful
And you fill me in with the info (yeah)
Stock was rising like tenfold
But you're more concerned with my mental (yeah)
Shutting down is your default
Circling for a cheat code (yeah)
Sun is out and it feels cold
Camera zoom on the eagle (yeah)
Find a bench and we recall
Memories through a peep hole (yeah)
Reconnect with the real goal
Camera zoom on my people

(Woo, yeah)
(Woo, yeah)
(Woo, yeah)
(Woo, yeah)
(Woo, yeah)
(Woo, yeah)
(Woo, yeah)
(Woo, yeah)

하고 싶었던 말들은 어디에 갔나
말들은 어디에 갔나
