		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Somewhere a clock strikes midnight
And there's a full moon in the sky
You hear a dog bark in the distance
You hear someone's baby cry
A rat runs down the alley
And a chill runs down your spine
And someone walks across your grave
And you wish the sun would shine
'Cause no one's gonna warn you
And no one's gonna yell attack
And you don't feel the steel
'Til it's hangin' out your back
I'm your night prowler, asleep in the day
Night prowler, get outta my way
Yeah I'm the prowler, watch out tonight
Yes I'm the night prowler, when you turn out the light

Too scared to turn your light out
'Cause there's somethin' on your mind
Was that a noise outside the window
What's that shadow on the blind
As you lie there naked
Like a body in a tomb
Suspended animation as I slip into your room
I'm your night prowler, asleep in the day
Yeah I'm the night prowler, get outta my way
Look out for the night prowler, watch out tonight
Yes I'm the night prowler, when you turn out the light

I'm your night prowler, asleep in the day
Yes I'm the night prowler, get outta my way
Look out for the night prowler, watch out tonight
Yes I'm the night prowler, when you turn out the light
I'm your night prowler, break down your door
I'm your night prowler, crawling across your floor
I'm the night prowler, make a mess of you, yes I will
Night prowler
And I'm telling this to you
There ain't nothing
There ain't nothing
Nothing you can do
