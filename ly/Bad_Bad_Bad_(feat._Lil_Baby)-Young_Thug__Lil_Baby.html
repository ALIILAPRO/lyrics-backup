		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wheezy outta here

Rose gold seat on a fucking helicopter
Double C, no Chanel, 'cause she bad, bad, bad
Ridin' Kawasaki, and I could cop you a new 'Rari
Let you ride it in your Rafs and you're bad, bad, bad
No playin', no Atari, I won't play with you for nothing
I can eat you like Hibachi 'cause you bad, bad, bad
I just took the doors off the 'Ghini, now I'm riding
And I'm sliding in her sideways, now she call me her Zaddy

Rich nigga shit, I bought my thottie a new Patek
Got a model, got a thickie, got a BM, got a stallion
Got a billion dollar corporation, fuck a Xanny
I got millions to go get and a couple bitches to- uh, yeah
You my dawg 'til we dead, not a question
But I can't fuck with you like I want 'cause you ratted
Got a million dollars in the wall, in the band'
Got it stepped on, got it hard, got it cracking on her
Half a million, I just did a warm up for
Half a million, uh, uh, mm
I could buy the building
I could rent this shit out and save it for the children
I could dead this shit out and give it to the villains
Somewhere they can hide when they do some killing
All of the rides got grenade ceilings
Loaded with a ride cost a cool million

Rose gold seat on a fucking helicopter
Double C, no Chanel, 'cause she bad, bad, bad
Ridin' Kawasaki, and I could cop you a new 'Rari
Let you ride it in your Rafs and you're bad, bad, bad
No playin', no Atari, I won't play with you for nothing
I can eat you like Hibachi 'cause you bad, bad, bad
I just took the doors off the 'Ghini, now I'm riding
And I'm sliding in her sideways, now she call me her Zaddy

Paper tag, peanut butter seats, I'm ridin'
I be in the foreign, I fuck with slime, we tied in (slatt)
Different color Diors on my feet, I couldn't decide which
Never talked about it, she done made herself my side bitch
Trash bag gang, I can put that on Elijah
Streets chose me, I ain't never had to sign up
Then we hittin' bitches in the group, I make 'em line up
Beep, beep, beep, that's me, nigga, get back
Real dope boy, don't know how to work a CashApp
How many you got? I'll send it long, bring the cash out
I been sipping lean, 'bout to pee 'til I pass out
Went to sleep 'partment, woke up in a paradise
Niggas stealin' drip but it don't matter, they don't wear it right
They don't even speak but I can see I got 'em terrified
Double R truck, come through, shit on everybody
Bad, bad, bitch, good head, hit her every night

Rose gold seat on a fucking helicopter
Double C, no Chanel, 'cause she bad, bad, bad
Ridin' Kawasaki, and I could cop you a new 'Rari
Let you ride it in your Rafs and you're bad, bad, bad
No playin', no Atari, I won't play with you for nothing
I can eat you like Hibachi 'cause you bad, bad, bad
I just took the doors off the 'Ghini, now I'm riding
And I'm sliding in her sideways, now she call me her Zaddy

Take the four doors off of the Jeep (bad, bad, bad)
I ain't doin' no swaps with a freak, uh (bad, bad, bad)
We can handle this shit out in the streets, yeah (bad, bad, bad)
I ain't goin' to a house for a meetin', yeah (bad, bad, bad)
Pull up in a truck, any season
Niggas never comin' out, then we leavin'
How could nigga take a loss if he leavin'?
Quickly take off like I'm LeBron
