		<p>
		  Yeah, haha
I'm outside right now, tryna get lit
Yeah, fuck with that shit right there
Alright, yeah, yeah
Alright, here we go, here we go
(Level) I'ma be outside, I'ma be outside (go)

Smoke a blunt right now, roll a 'Wood (let's go)
Bruh, I'm up and down in your hood (yeah)
Man, I wish a bitch-nigga would (yeah, fuck that bitch)
Smokin' all this gas in the hood (huh)
Blowin' all this gas, Hazelwood (fuck)
I just wanna know where you from (where the fuck you at?)
Hundred round bullet, it's a drum (let's go, buh, buh-buh-buh-buh)
Light a nigga up like the sun (yeah)

Light a nigga up like the sun (yeah)
Don't let him run (let's go)
We gon' be up 'til like 5 AM
5 AM, 5 AM, 5 AM
I don't even know the time, but I know it's time to reach
Open up my head
Tryna go outside (outside)
Got the moshpit outside (outside)
Burn this bitch with my pride
I don't give a fuck about this shit
Everybody better go and drop this shit
Diamonds on my neck like a cooling kit
Walk around like I own your block
Fuck 12, I don't even fuck with cops
White bitch straight from Beverly Hills
All she want is molly and pills
She just wanna die or get killed
Don't really matter what how she feel
Bad bitch looking like cocoa (cocoa)
From the top of the ozone
Only live once like YOLO (huh?)
Fuck a bitch in my GoPro
Pull up in a all-black, woo
What you know about this agony?
Demon outside won't let me breathe
Bitch-ass niggas tryna be like me
I'ma be up 'til 5 AM
I don't give a fuck 'bout none of them
Catch me with a Glock shootin' out the Benz
All the hoes just wanna fuck my friends (go)

Smoke a blunt right now, roll a 'Wood (let's go)
Bruh, I'm up and down in your hood (yeah)
Man, I wish a bitch-nigga would (yeah, fuck that bitch)
Smokin' all this gas in the hood (huh)
Blowin' all this gas, Hazelwood (fuck)
I just wanna know where you from (where the fuck you at?)
Hundred round bullet, it's a drum (let's go, buh, buh-buh-buh-buh)
Light a nigga up like the sun (yeah)

(Light a nigga up like the sun)
(Don't let him run)
(We gon' be up 'til like 5 AM)
