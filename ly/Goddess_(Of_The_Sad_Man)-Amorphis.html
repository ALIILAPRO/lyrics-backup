		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Astonishment when I bend over you creep 
Put a noose around my neck 
Which side I decide it's my time to reap 
It's your side wicked and deaf 

Take me to the place I can sleep 
Wipe away all misery 
Turn my path away 
From the mind tearing tragedy 
Consuming range of vision 
I can see they decline 
It's a stay of execution 
I fly free tonight 

New moon laughs on it's own 
Without compassion 
I crawl through the realms unknown 
And kneel to the goddess of the sad man 

Inhale all mists from the shadows 
And hide before the dawn 
Face your mortal horror 
You won't be reborn 

Is he a proud man or just a fraud 
Fooling himself with a losers talk 
Punished to eternal vanity 
It's thy destiny to cry for purity 
You infidel slime 
I grace insanity 

satisfy my agony 
I know what my goddess needs 
I bet there's something wrong 
inside my psycho creep 
fire burns within her eyes 
take me to the deadly ride 
I remember how she was 
when she choked on her own pride 

New moon laughs on it's own 
Without compassion 
I crawl through the realms unknown 
And kneel to the goddess of the sad man
