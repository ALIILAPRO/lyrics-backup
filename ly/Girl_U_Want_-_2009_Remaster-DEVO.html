		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She sings from somewhere you can't see
She sits in the top of the greenest tree
She sends out an aroma of undefined love
It drips on down in a mist from above

She's just the girl, she's just the girl
The girl you want
She's just the girl, she's just the girl
The girl you want

You hear her calling everywhere you turn
You know you're headed for the pleasure burn
But the words get stuck on the tip of your tongue
She's the real thing but you knew it all along

She's just the girl, she's just the girl
The girl you want
She's just the girl, she's just the girl
The girl you want

Look at you with your mouth watering
Look at you with your mind spinnin'
Why don't we just admit it's all over
She's just the girl you want

She's just the girl, she's just the girl
The girl you want
She's just the girl, she's just the girl
The girl you want

She sings from somewhere you can't see
She sits in the top of the greenest tree
She sends out an aroma of undefined love
It drips on down in a mist from above

She's just the girl, she's just the girl
The girl you want
She's just the girl, she's just the girl
The girl you want

Look at you with your mouth watering
Look at you with your mind spinnin'
Why don't we just admit it's all over
She's just the girl you want

She's just the girl, she's just the girl
The girl you want
She's just the girl, she's just the girl
The girl you want
She's just the girl, she's just the girl
The girl you want
She's just the girl, she's just the girl
