		  Ayy, 200 I floor it
I might get a 'Rari, 200 I floor it
I might get a 'Rari, 200 I floor it
Y'all get the shit, you get the message
200 I floor it

Better keep up yeah, that's a foreign (yeah)
Hit your girl with endurance ('durance)
She like "I'm okay, (okay)
'Cause I got insurance" (yeah)
Your number, won't store it
Call me, I ignore it (hello)
I might get a 'Rari, 200 I floor it (Rari)
I was broke yesterday (yeah)
I was rich by the morning (the morning)

I was broke yesterday (yeah)
I was rich by the morning (the morning)

Yeah, rich by the morning
Yeah, rich by the morning
New whip, with the big Forgies
New crib, thats a new fortress (wow)
You dig, choppa with the cartridge
My slime, move with the cartridge (yeah)
My time now, not the mornin' (mornin')
My bracelet cost like 40, yeah (yeah)
That's shit funny, that boy countin 40's (oh God)
My swag so important
Off-white collab with the Jordans (Jordans)
Me, don't believe in extortion (extortion)
Hairline hit like a hornet (hornet)
Walk in and my neck got the pointers (pointers)
Fuck your bitch homie and she got appointment

Appointment, appointment (ayy)
Want it, point it (point it)
Call me, ignore it (yeah)
The 'Rari is roarin'
It's blue, like Corbin (yeah)
Eat oysters, and swordfish (yeah)
Was broke, last night (what)
Was rich, by the morning (by the morning)

Better keep up yeah, that's a foreign (yeah)
Hit your girl with endurance ('durance)
She like "I'm okay, (okay)
'Cause I got insurance" (yeah)
Your number, won't store it
Call me, I ignore it (hello)
I might get a 'Rari, 200 I floor it (Rari)
I was broke yesterday (yeah)

Nowadays, I think a lot of you (lot of you)
But I don't really don't wanna bother you (bother you)
Every day get right inside of you (inside of you)
Not talkin' Twitter, I follow you (follow you)
I fuck that girl just like a prostitute (yeah)
I cannot lie girl I bother you (that Uzi)
I'm usually with more than one of you (one of you)
So I can just, um, make a pot of you
Every day you got a struggle
Every day you got a pain, yeah (pain)
Used to watch shit in doubles
And I still feel the rain, yeah
Ooo, know what? We don't feel the pain, yeah (don't feel the pain, yeah)
Go to the club, make it rain, yeah
Rain, rain, go to the club make it rain
You'll get wet up like a sink
All of my diamonds, they pink
Jump in the 'Rari, switch lanes
Jump in the 'Rari, switch lanes
Boy, I can do my dash (woo)
Watch me, I won't crash

Better keep up yeah, that's a foreign (yeah)
Hit your girl with endurance ('durance)
She like "I'm okay, (okay)
'Cause I got insurance" (yeah)
Your number, won't store it
Call me, I ignore it (hello)
I might get a 'Rari, 200 I floor it (Rari)
I was broke yesterday (yeah)
I was rich by the morning (the morning)
I was broke yesterday (yeah)
I was rich by the morning (the morning)
I was broke yesterday (yeah)
I was rich by the morning (the morning)
I was broke yesterday (yeah)
I was rich by the morning (the morning)
