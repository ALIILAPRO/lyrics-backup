		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wake up  
I fall down 
Get up 
Move all around 
 
Look up 
Stare at a cloud 
Breath out 
Feel so let down 
 
Look around 
I see the ground 
Turn my head 
I hear a sound 
 
I think I'm coming 
Coming unwound 
 
I tie my shoes 
I go to town 
 
I go out 
I go to town 
Get down 
I get around 
Cant tell 
Just where I want to be 
I go outside 
Move slow 
Cant tell me to go ( x3)
 
I run around 
 
Cant dance but I move my feet 
Cant sing but I feel the beat 
 
Cant tell just where I want to be 
Cant dance but I move my feet 
 
I just been run-in and run-in 
 
I turn my head 
I hear a sound 
You say my name 
I turn around 
 
I think I'm coming 
Coming unwound 
Look down
Stare at the ground 
 
Breath out 
Feel so let down 
Look up 
Stare at a cloud 
 
I wanna move 
Move all around 
Tie my shoes 
I go to town 
 
Go out 
I go to town 
Get down 
I get around 
Cant tell just where I want to be 
I go outside  
Move slow 
Cant tell me to go
