		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm pulling up to an empty street
Nothing to hear but myself breathe
I'm too afraid of what I might be
I'm too scared to be alone right now
Headlights on with nothing to see
Radio's on just to give me some peace
Wish I could say it's a figure of speech
But I'm too scared to be alone right now

I think I've had enough now
Save me from myself now
I can't handle anymore

'Cause I'm scared to be alone
Have you ever been alone? (So alone)
'Cause I'm scared to be alone
So alone (So alone)

Too much space makes a girl insane
I guess I'll take another lap inside my brain
Can't catch up with my own mind's game
I hate so much that I'm alone right now

I think I've had enough now
Save me from myself now
I can't handle anymore

'Cause I'm scared to be alone
Have you ever been alone? (So alone)
'Cause I'm scared to be alone
So alone (So alone)

Can flowers bloom in a darker place?
Can't find myself, do I know this face?
Memories catch up with me
And who I used to be

I think I've had enough now
Save me from myself now (Save me)
I can't handle anymore

'Cause I'm scared to be alone (I'm scared)
Have you ever been alone? (I'm scared)
'Cause I'm scared to be alone (I'm scared)
So alone (So alone)

(So alone)
(So alone)
I'm scared
(So alone)
I'm scared
(So alone)
