		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'll tell you what we're gonna do, what you need to know
What you gotta get to get where you wanna go
Never ever miss a noun, keep your eye on all displays
When you find your style everyday's a holiday

I'll show you how to work it
To find the fit that's perfect
You know that you deserve it
Whoa, whoa, whoa

This is the good life
Take a good look, have anything you want
This is the good life
Dining with your friends at the fancy restaurant
Living the good life
We have such a good time I know

Grab a little Gucci bag and some Prada shoes
Here take my credit card, they're all here to wait on you
Jimmy Choo calls out your name, D&G on every wall
When you can't decide, that's okay just buy them all

There's no better feeling
There's nothing more appealing
The door, front floor, the ceiling
Whoa, whoa, whoa

This is the good life
Take a good look, have anything you want
This is the good life
Dining with your friends at the fancy restaurant
Living the good life
We have such a good time, I know

Can't be slow, never stop, fill those bags up to the top
Turn around, try it on, now off to the hair salon
Joanie says, "I'll just pay, there's no need for layaway"
Slide your plastic, flash your cash, ring it up, it's such a blast
One, two, three, four

This is the good life
Take a good look, have anything you want
This is the good life
Dining with your friends at the fancy restaurant
Living the good life
We have such a good time, I know

Oh, oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, the good life
Oh, oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, I'm living the good life
Oh, oh, whoa, whoa, the good life
Oh, oh, whoa, whoa, I'm living the good life
Whoa, the good life, yeah
