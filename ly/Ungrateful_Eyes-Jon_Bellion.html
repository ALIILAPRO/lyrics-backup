		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I made a hundred grand this year
(Clap clap, clap clap, so what?)
Still lost, still feeling anxious
Still worry 'bout the same shit
I made a hundred grand this year
(Clap clap, clap clap, so what?) still lost
Still feel depressed like I'm tryna
Find a way in

I'm tryna figure this out
But, my God, I'm so human
And so I turned to my sister
And smiled and asked this question

All we wanna know is where
The stars came from but do we ever stop
Ever stop to watch them shine?
All we wanna know is where
The stars came from but do we ever stop
Ever stop to watch them shine?
Or are we staring with
Staring with ungrateful eyes?

I made a hundred grand this year
(Clap clap, clap clap, so what?)
Still hung up on opinions
Still tryna find a way home
I made a hundred grand this year
(Clap clap, clap clap, so what?)
Still feel like I'm behind time
Still worry where the day goes

I'm tryna figure this out
But, my God, I'm so human
And so I turned to my sister
And smiled and asked this question

All we wanna know is where
The stars came from but do we ever stop
Ever stop to watch them shine?
All we wanna know is where
The stars came from but do we ever stop
Ever stop to watch them shine?
Woah oh, oh, woah oh oh oh, woah oh, oh
Woah oh oh oh or are we staring with
Staring with ungrateful eyes?
Woah oh, oh, woah oh oh oh, woah oh, oh
Woah oh oh oh or are we staring with
Staring with ungrateful eyes?

All we wanna know is where
The stars came from but do we ever stop
Ever stop to watch them shine?
All we wanna know is where
The stars came from
But do we ever stop, ever stop to watch them
Woah oh, oh, woah oh oh oh, woah oh, oh
Woah oh oh oh or are we staring with
Staring with ungrateful eyes?
Woah oh, oh, woah oh oh oh, woah oh, oh
Woah oh oh oh or are we staring with
Staring with ungrateful eyes?
