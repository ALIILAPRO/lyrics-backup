		  5...4...3...2...1...
At the end of every week 
each one of us becomes a freak. 
Tonight the dj makes us move 
and then the sweat drops from the roof. 
Each time you let the bass beat hard 
to know we all spend now apart. 
Just activate your energy 
lets sing the song and come with me.

Turn it up!

At the end of every week 
each one of us becomes a freak. 
Tonight the dj makes us move 
and then the sweat drops from the roof. 
Each time you let the bass beat hard
to know we all spend now apart. 
Just activate your energy 
lets sing the song and come with me.

The speaker system brings the sound,
And alot of heads starts spinnin' round. 
All the people on the floor 
they shake their bodies cry for more. 
Never let this feeling go 
and let the music take control. 
Forget your problems and be free, 
Enjoy this moment, come with me!

Turn it up!
