		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everybody's looking for someone to follow
Finding the whole thing hard to swallow
Everybody's looking for a reason to live
If you're looking for a reason, I've a reason to give
Pleasure, little treasure

Everybody's looking for a new sensation
Everybody's talking about the state of the nation
Everybody's searching for a promised land
Everybody's failing to understand
Pleasure, little treasure

Everybody's looking for a reason to live
If you're looking for a reason, I've a reason to give
Pleasure, little treasure

Maternity frocks and paternity suits
If that's what you want, they're waiting for you
Everybody needs some reason or other
You'll find a reason when you discover
Pleasure, little treasure

Everybody's looking for a reason to live
If you're looking for a reason, I've a reason to give
Pleasure, little treasure

Pleasure, little treasure
Pleasure, little treasure
Pleasure, little treasure
Pleasure, little treasure
Pleasure, little treasure
