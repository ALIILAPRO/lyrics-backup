		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now you're gone
I realized my love for you was strong
And I miss you here now you're gone
I keep waiting here by the phone
With your pictures hanging on the wall

Now you're gone
I realized my love for you was strong
And I miss you here now you're gone
I keep waiting here by the phone
With your pictures hanging on the wall

(Are you ready?)

Now you're gone
I realized my love for you was strong
And I miss you here now you're gone
Is this the way it's meant to be?
Only dreaming that you're missing me
I'm waiting here at home
I'll be crazy now you're gone

(Ready for take off, ready, ready, ready, ready for takeoff)

Now you're gone
I realized my love for you was strong
And I miss you here now you're gone
I keep waiting here by the phone
With your pictures hanging on the wall
There's an empty place in my heart
Without my Anna it will break apart
It won't heal, it never fades away
I'll go crazy, now you're gone

Now you're gone
I realized my love for you was strong
And I miss you here now you're gone
I keep waiting here by the phone
With your pictures hanging on the wall

Is this the way it's meant to be?
Only dreaming that you're missing me
I'm waiting here at home
I'll be crazy now you're gone
