		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In every city you sit when you listen to this
You'll find a piece of me that
Drifts in the infinite bliss
It's been a gamble in the twist
But I managed to risk
And free solo climbed the face of this cliff
Get a grip
I'm ripping flower petals down to the stem
Start a fire in my hand and
Blow an ounce in the wind
I'm out for my kin
My Bowie doggy dog and all of my friends
I know it's dog eat dog out
There in the cannibals' den
But I trail blaze past
What a fantasy's ending
In the pastures of my passion and gift
The grass is greener here
It's cleaner and the soil is rich
I need land on every continent
Down to the inch take a glimpse at my losses
That my wins will eclipse
And everyone who figured I'd fail
Finally eating their shit
Switch this abyss oasis of my infinite bliss
Dive in a moon pool and
Swim to the ocean again

Ever since I met my dream girl
I can't fall asleep
It's been like this for weeks
And the weeks just repeat
I wrote a poem about her
To bring me some peace
Or at least just release before
I turn to a beast beauty blindfolding me
Spirit took a hold of me
Legs wrapped around
Heart started controlling me
Carving her name in all the
Marches of my poetry growing trees
Pulling on weeds breaking this fresh dirt
Spending hours smoking flowers writing
All these excerpts 'Til my breath burst and
Colours a couple words
I'm head first, diving in the blood
Country girls love diamonds
Give me healthcare and drug money
Sometimes it feels like I'm
Hunting Bugs Bunny
Nothing's funny, smoggy and still sunny
