		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  tears turning to ice

who made your eyes look so sad
who just wiped your smile away
looks like you live a fairy tale with no end
who took the joy from your life
moved the sun out of your day
who made you look so lost in a no man‘s land
where there‘s no return
and there‘s no escape

so take me
to your secrets
i see your tears turning to ice
clear and cool

oh just take me
to your daydreams
i see your tears turning to ice
like a jewel

take me
to your secrets
turning to ice

i’ll make your eyes shine again
with a love that kills the pain
you feel that long forgotten dreams come true
i’m here to rescue your hopes
and to stop the heartbreak rain
never give up – for i will stand by you
where there‘s no return
and there‘s no escape

so take me
to your secrets
i see your tears turning to ice
clear and cool

oh just take me
to your daydreams
i see your tears turning to ice
like a jewel

take me
to your secrets
turning to ice
