		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's everybody's business
When you walk down the lane
You're taking the right of way
And you don't realise at all
It's everybody's business
Let's hear what you've gotta say
You're losing the right to breathe
You're losing the right to roam
And when the end is near 
Bummed out you just don't care
And when the end is now
Come then you just don't know
And if it makes you feel better
The creeps are all gonna cook
Along with the rest of us
On this weird rock
Does it make you feel better?
Does it make you feel worse?
When's it gonna happen?
Are we all fucked?
One morning 
You are gonna wake up in a different world
Open your eyes yeah
And when the end is near
Bummed out you just don't care
And when the end is now
Come then you just don't know
And when the end is near
Bummed out you just don't care
And when the end is now
Come then you just don't know
Everything was forever
Until it was no more
It was forever
Well then it's time to go
One morning
You are gonna wake up in a different world
