		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  [Verse 1]
I set the bar too high, watch them fall, and wonder why
People think I'm hard to reach, I only show a part of me
I do it every time, fuck it up, and wonder why
I can't fall asleep at night, running circles in my mind
[Pre-Chorus]
If I don't laugh, I'll cry (Ahh)
What a waste of time

[Chorus]
There's no high like the comedown
Lay low, ride out the blackout
Guess that's just how I'm living now
Going through the motions
New day, same kind of breakdown
All in until I'm all out
Guess that's just how I'm living now
Just going through the motions

[Post-Chorus]
M-m-m-oh-otions
Just going through the motions
M-m-m-oh-otions

[Verse 2]
Like a loaded gun, a second from oblivion
Drifting closer to the edge, tightrope walking at my best
I got no regrets, it used to hurt but I'm used to it
They say I'm a masochist, but I feel so indifferent
[Pre-Chorus]
If I don't laugh, I'll cry (Ahh)
At least I'm getting by

[Chorus]
There's no high like the comedown
Lay low, ride out the blackout
Guess that's just how I'm living now
Going through the motions
New day, same kind of breakdown
All in until I'm all out
Guess that's just how I'm living now
Just going through the motions

[Post-Chorus]
M-m-m-oh-otions
Just going through the motions
M-m-m-oh-otions
