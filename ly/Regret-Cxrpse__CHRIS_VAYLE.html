		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Smoke choke fill my lungs
Still feel my face, no fun
Ayy, want me dead
Then you better bring a gun
Ayy, want me dead then you
Better bring the drugs
No friends, no brothers, no love
All gone, they ain't never fuck with us
All problems, they coming back to me
All talk, they ain't never shaking none
Ayy, four hoes fill my ride
Pull up hot a night all them flashing lights
Get closer, might die
I got the drugs too hard to try
I didn't pay full price
Full moon rise at night
That's why you act so wild

Hold her hand just like a child
Coke nose, bet you snort it out the pile
They all mad I can tell by they frowns
I don't care, you can see it in my smile
Halo on my head like my crown
Can't find me, lost in the crowd
I came to make my momma proud
Are you high right now?

I don't care, I'm still here, yah
I don't care, I'm still here, yah
I don't care, I'm still here, yah
I don't care, I ain't goin' nowhere
I don't care, I'm still here, yah
I don't care, I'm still here, yah
I don't care, I'm still here, yah
I don't care, I'm still here
