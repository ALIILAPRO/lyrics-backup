		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hide and seek is a game
We'll teach you how to play
Close your eyes really tight
Make it dark, like the night

The party never ends
The game begins again
The party never ends
The game begins again

The party never ends
The game begins again
The party never ends
The game begins again

Climb the stairs to the top
Rooms are dark but don't stop
Getting close, really warm
Now you're cold on the floor

The party never ends
The game begins again
The party never ends
The game begins again
The party never ends

The game begins again
The party never ends
The game begins again
The party never ends

The game begins again
The party never ends
The game begins again
The party never ends

The game begins again
The party never ends
The game begins again
