		<p>
		  (Calling all cars, calling all cars
Be on the lookout for a tall light-skinned brother with dimples 
Wearing a black Kangol, sweatsuit, gold chain, and sneakers
Last seen on Farmers Boulevard heading east
Alias LL Cool J, he's bad)

Ah
No rapper can rap quite like I can 
I'll take a musclebound man and put his face in the sand 
Not the last Mafioso, I'm a MC cop 
Make you say, "Go LL" and do the Wop
If you think you can out rhyme me, yeah, boy, I bet 
'Cause I ain't met a motherfucker who can do that yet 
Trendsetter, I'm better, my rhymes are good 
I got a gourmet plate that says "I wish you would"
And when battles begin then I gotta join in and
Before my rhyme is over, you know I'ma win
Cool J has arrived, so you better make way
Ask anybody in the crowd, they say the kid don't play
Slaughter competition, that's my hobby and job 
I don't wear a disguise because I don't owe the mob 
Got a pinpoint rap that makes you feel trapped 
So many girls on my jock, I think my phone is tapped 
I'm bad 

Cool J
Cool J (yeah)
Cool J
Cool J
Cool J
Cool J-J-J-J

I'm like Tyson, icin', I'm a soldier at war 
I'm makin' sure you don't try to battle me no more 
Got concrete rhymes, been rappin' for ten years and 
Even when I'm braggin', I'm bein' sincere 
MC's can't win, I make 'em rust like tin 
They call me Jaws, my hat is like a shark's fin 
Because I'm bad as can be, got my voice on wax
Some brothers think he's making records, now he must have relaxed 
I couldn't, I shouldn't, and it'll stay that way 
The best rapper you've heard is LL Cool J 
Kamikaze, take a look at what I've done 
Used to rock in my basement, now I'm number one 
And can happen on time, never standin' on line 
You wanna try me? First you better learn how to rhyme 
I'm the pinnacle, that means I reign supreme 
And I'm notorious, I'll crush you like a jellybean 
I'm bad

(Suspect was last spotted with three other members of his group
Bobcat, E Love and the Cut Creator
They are extremely bad, so keep your eyes open
Use extreme caution)

I eliminate punks, cut 'em up in chunks 
You were souped, you heard me, and your ego shrunk 
I'm devastating, I'm so good it's a shame 
'Cause I eat rappers like a cannibal, they call me insane 
I'm as strong as a bull, of course you know I have pull 
I enjoy what I'm doin', plus I'm paid in full 
Not Buckaroo Bonsai but bust it out as I
Say the kind of rhymes that make MC's wish that I died
Never retire or put my mic on the shelf 
The baddest rapper in the history of rap itself 
Not bitter or mad, just provin' I'm bad 
You want a hit? Give me a hour, plus a pen and a pad 
MC's retreat, 'cause they know I can beat 'em 
And eat 'em in a battle and the ref won't cheat 'em 
I'm the baddest, takin' out all rookies 
So forget Oreos, eat Cool J cookies 
I'm bad 

Cool J
Cool J (ha)
Cool J (come and get it)
Cool J-J-J
Cool J-J-J

Never ever, no, never (Cool J)
Never wearin' no Levis, battle me, why try?
I'll treat you like a stepchild, so tell mommy "bye-bye"
Slaughterin' MC's and I'ma never get whipped
When I retire, I'll get worshipped like a old battleship 
LL, I'm bad, all the rappers know 
When I enter the center they say, "Yo, yo there he go" 
My paycheck's large, Mr. Bogart in charge 
Not a puncher or a hunter from a raccoon lodge
The original Todd, teachin' how to be hard 
Take the skin off a snake, and split a pea from a pod 
You're a novice, I'm noble, and I decipher my tongue 
Not Atilla the Hun, nor Abdullah his son
My vocals exact like rack and pinion in a Jag 
You try to brag, you get your rhymes from a grab-bag 
No good scavenger, catfish vulture 
My tongue's a chisel and this composition's sculpture 
I'm bad 

(Think I'm gonna need backup
I think I'm gonna need backup)

(Gimme that walkie-talkie
Yo, this is L.L. Cool J
And you'll never catch me, so don't even try it
'Cause I'm too bad for ya, understand?
I'm bad
