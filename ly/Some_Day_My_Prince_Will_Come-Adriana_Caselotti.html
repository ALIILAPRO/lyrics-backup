		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Once there was a Princess 
Was the Princess, you?
And she fell in love 
Was it hard to do?
Well, it was very easy 
Anyone could see that the Prince was charming 
The only one for me
Was he strong and handsome?
Was he big and tall?
There's nobody like him anywhere at all
Did he say he loved ya?
Did he steal a kiss?

He was so romantic
I could not resist

Someday my prince will come
Someday we'll meet again
And away to his castle we'll go
To be happy forever I know
Someday when spring is here
We'll find our love anew
And the birds will sing and wedding bells will ring
Someday when my dreams come true
