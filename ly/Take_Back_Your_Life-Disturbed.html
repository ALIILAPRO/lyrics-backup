		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't sit there and watch it fall apart (fall apart)
There's no one coming to save you
You've got to make your stand now
Stop bleeding from your broken heart (your broken heart)
Time to let go of what used to be, now

Take back your life (take back your life)
You've got to let them know you won't be denied
Take back your life (take back your life)
Time to take it back again
Make it worth remembering now

Do not let this moment pass you by 
(Now, now, now) 
You're the only one who can decide
You've got to make that change now
You need to break out from behind the lie (behind the lie)
Show the world what you were meant to be now

Take back your life (take back your life)
You've got to let them know you won't be denied
Take back your life (take back your life)
Time to take it back again
Make it worth remembering now

Oh, take it, you're gonna make it
Let them hear your voice like never before
Bring it back now, and attack now
You know it's time, my friend, to start living again
Oh, take it, you're gonna make it
Let them hear your voice like never before
Bring it back now, and attack now
You know it's time, my friend, to start living again (now, now)

Take back your life (take back your life)
You've got to let them know you won't be denied
Take back your life (take back your life)
Time to take it back again
Make it worth remembering now
Take back your life (take back your life)
You've got to let them know you won't be denied
Take back your life (take back your life)
Time to take it back again
Make it worth remembering
Time to take it back again
Make it worth remembering now

Don't let this moment pass you by
Don't let this moment pass you by
(Now)
