		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All that time I was searching with nowhere to run to
It started me thinking
Wondering what I could make of my life
And who'd be waiting
Asking all kinds of questions to myself
But never finding the answers

Crying at the top of my voice 
And no one listening
All this time, I still remember everything you said, oho
There's so much you promised, how could I ever forget

Listen, you know I love you, but I just can't take this
You know I love you, but I'm playing for keeps
Although I need you, I'm not gonna make this
You know I want to, but I'm in too deep

So listen, listen to me
Ooh, you must believe me
I can feel your eyes go through me
But I don't know why

Ooh, I know you're going but I can't believe
It's the way that you're leaving
It's like we never knew each other at all
It may be my fault
I gave you too many reasons, being alone
When I didn't want to

I thought you'd always be there
I almost believed you
All this time, I still remember everything you said, oho oh
Ooh there's so much you promised, how could I ever forget

Listen, you know I love you, but I just can't take this
You know I love you, but I'm playing for keeps
Although I need you, I'm not gonna make this
You know I want to, but I'm in too deep
So listen, listen to me
I can feel your eyes go through me

It seems I've spent too long
Only thinking about myself, oho
Now I want to spend my life
Just caring 'bout somebody else

Listen, you know I love you, but I just can't take this
You know I love you, but I'm playing for keeps
Although I need you, I'm not gonna make this
You know I want to, but I'm in too deep
You know I love you, but I just can't take this
You know I love you, but I'm playing for keeps
Although I need you, I'm not gonna make this
You know I want to, but I'm in too deep (you know I love you, but I just)
You know I love you, but I just can't take this (but I just can't take this)
You know I love you, but I'm playing for keeps (you know I love you)
Although I need you, I'm not gonna make this (you know I love you)
You know I want to, but I'm in too deep (you know I love you, love you)
You know I love you, but I just can't take this (I can't take this)
You know I love you, but I'm playing for keeps
