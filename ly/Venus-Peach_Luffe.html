		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I fantasize, romanticize what we are in my mind like a daydream 
haven't felt so alive until I gave you every bit of me
Why am I still here when you're not

Did Venus fly away
Off to another place

The shimmer inside your eyes have fade over time
The ship has run its course, I can see why
You're in a your own galaxy

Did Venus fly away
Off to another place
