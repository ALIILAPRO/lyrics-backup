		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh baby, why don't you just meet me in the middle?
Why don't you just meet me in the middle?

Take a seat
Right over there, sat on the stairs
Stay or leave
The cabinets are bare, and I'm unaware
Of just how we got into this mess, got so aggressive
I know we meant all good intentions

So pull me closer
Why don't you pull me close?
Why don't you come on over?
I can't just let you go

Oh baby, why don't you just meet me in the middle?
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle?
In the middle
Baby, why don't you just meet me in the middle?
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle?
In the middle

Ohh, take a step
Back for a minute, into the kitchen
Floors are wet
And taps are still runnin', dishes are broken
How did we get into this mess? Got so aggressive
I know we meant all good intentions

So pull me closer
Why don't you pull me close?
Why don't you come on over?
I can't just let you go

Oh baby, why don't you just meet me in the middle?
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle?
In the middle
You might also like

Lookin' at you, I can't lie
Just pourin' out admission
Regardless of my objection, oh, oh
And it's not about my pride
I need you on my skin
Just come over, pull me in, just

Oh, baby, why don't you just meet me in the middle?
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle?
In the middle, no no
Baby, why don't you just meet me in the middle?
Oh yeah, I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle?
Oh, in the middle
Baby-y-y, why don't you just meet me in the middle, baby?
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle, middle?
In the middle, middle
