		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Want you more every day
While tripping on the words I wish you would say
I get that late night knock on my door
And I know exactly what you're coming here for

You went out with your girls 
Told a lie said you're lonely
But you know where I am
And I know where you're going

Every night you're sleeping in my bed 
Every morning you're fucking with my head
Every night you're sleeping in my bed
Every morning you're fucking with my head
La da da da da 
La da da da da 
Every night you're sleeping in my bed
Every morning you love me like a friend

Sunrise coffee I know 
You'll take a sip and slip back into your clothes
Oh every time you're walking out of my door 
I don't think that you know what you're leaving here for

When you're out with your girls (With you and your girls)
You can lie (Lie to me) say you're lonely 
But you know where I am 
And I know where you're going

Every night you're sleeping in my bed 
Every morning you're fucking with my head
Every night you're sleeping in my bed
Every morning you're fucking with my head
La da da da da 
La da da da da 
Every night you're sleeping in my bed
Every morning you love me like a friend

You've got a friend in me
And that's what's killing me
You've got a friend in me
And that's what's killing me

Every night you're sleeping in my bed 
Every morning you're fucking with my head
Every night you're sleeping in my bed
Every morning you're fucking with my head

Every night you're sleeping in my bed 
Every morning you're fucking with my head
Every night you're sleeping in my bed
Every morning you're fucking with my head
La da da da da 
La da da da da 
Every night you're sleeping in my bed
Every morning you love me like a friend
