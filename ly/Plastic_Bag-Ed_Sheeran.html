		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I overthink and have trouble sleeping
All purpose gone and don't have a reason
And there's no doctor to stop this bleeding
So I left home and jumped in the deep end
Took a job for dad, I think just to please him
So when I quit I just kept it secret
And I had friends but no longer see them
And it's just me, and now all my demons

Are heavy, weighing on my heart
I guess I'm done already, all but given up
I'm burning days 'til the week ends and start
I just pretend I'm not where I am
Should I cancel my plans?

Saturday night is giving me a reason
To rely on the strobe lights
The lifeline of a promise in a shot glass
And I'll take that
If you're giving out love from a plastic bag
Saturday night is giving me a reason
To rely on the strobe light
The lifeline of a promise in a shot glass
And I'll take that
If you're giving out love from a plastic bag

My friend died, it's been years, still grieving
And I thought time would be somehow healing
When love finds me, I'm too numb to feel it
Why the hell am I still here breathing?
Oh, I would pray, but I don't believe it
Woe is me, but I don't care either
Life is not the way that it seems, but
Maybe this will all be a dream

And I'll stay steady, balance on the rope
I guess that I'm not ready to rely on the hope
I'm burning days 'til the week ends and start
I just pretend I'm not where I am
Should I cancel my plans?

Saturday night is giving me a reason
To rely on the strobe light
The lifeline of a promise in a shot glass
And I'll take that
If you're giving out love from a plastic bag
Saturday night is giving me a reason
To rely on the strobe light
The lifeline of a promise in a shot glass
And I'll take that
If you're giving out love from a plastic bag

I'm a wreck head, oh
Take me to the other side
Don't look in my eyes
Oh, whoa

It's almost morning, I'm still not leaving
It's wearing off, but I still can feel it
Another one and I'll touch the ceiling
This is all I want to be

Saturday night is giving me a reason
To rely on the strobe light
The lifeline of a promise in a shot glass
And I'll take that
If you're giving out love from a plastic bag
Saturday night is giving me a reason
To rely on the strobe light
The lifeline of a promise in a shot glass
And I'll take that
If you're giving out love from a plastic bag
