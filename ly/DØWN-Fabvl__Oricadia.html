		  VERSE 1:

Fuck around and put you on the news
I got dead, dead  bodies and I’m gripping ten and two on my stick yea 
Six eyes, take him out, leave him in a ditch yea 
Dished out, hollowed out, I said I’ll take em this year 
Woah, wait 
I don’t deal with heartbreak 
Run up on that boy, leave him ridden with heartache
I got no feelings I want my place 
Brush off the sins you can’t erase 

PRE CHORUS:

Born to deliver
Return to sender
I’ve been a sinner
Gang full of killers

Drop dead 
Drop dead 
Oh baby you want my head 

CHORUS:

I’ll be

The one to break you

And you’ll see

What life looks like from hell

I can see it hurting

I think it’s time we burn it

Down (down)

Down (down

Down

VERSE 2:

I’m not one to say I’m sorry

Ii’m too far gone

So don’t you push me again

High stakes life and I came to place a bet

Keep a Draco in my pocket that I’d like to represent

Yea don’t try to act like you know me now

Rockstar rich you can’t hold me down

And I’ll really steal your bitch

You can’t tell me nothing

Nah you’ve always been a snitch

On god


PRE CHORUS:

Born to deliver
Return to sender
I’ve been a sinner
Gang full of killers

Drop dead 
Drop dead 
Oh baby you want my head 

CHORUS:

I’ll be

The one to break you

And you’ll see

What life looks like from hell

I can see it hurting

I think it’s time we burn it

Down (down)

Down (down

Down


BREAKDOWN:

Imma burn it

DOWN

Go and say something

Do something little bitch

I knock your ass out

When the bass drum hit like

BLOW

Ughhhhhh

IMMA BURN IT

IMMA BURN IT

IMMA BURN THIS MOTHER F**** TO THE

CHORUS:

I’ll be

The one to break you

And you’ll see

What life looks like from hell

I can see it hurting

I think it’s time we burn it

Down (down)

Down (down

Down
