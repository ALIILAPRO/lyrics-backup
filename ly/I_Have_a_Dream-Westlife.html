		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I have a dream
A song to sing
To help me cope 
With anything

If you see the wonder 
Of a fairy tale
You can take the future 
Even if you fail

I believe in angels
Something good in everything I see
I believe in angels
When I know the time is right for me

I'll cross the stream
I have a dream, oh yeah

I have a dream
A fantasy
To help me through 
Reality

And my destination 
Makes it worth the while
Pushing through the darkness 
Still another mile

I believe in angels
Something good in everything I see
I believe in angels
When I know the time is right for me

I'll cross the stream
I have a dream

I have a dream
A song to sing
To help me cope 
With anything

If you see the wonder 
Of a fairy tale
You can take the future 
Even if you fail

I believe in angels
Something good in everything I see
I believe in angels
When I know the time is right for me

I'll cross the stream
I have a dream
I'll cross the stream
I have a dream
