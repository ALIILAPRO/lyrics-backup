		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  La, la, la, love me or na, na, not
Love me or na, na, not
Love me or let me rest in-

Woke up in a bad mood
Didn't get to see you
Blissful in my dreams, you snuck out in my sleep
Now I wanna hate you
Mystery
Do you even miss me?
When I turn around, you'll be back in town
The truth is gonna kill me

Wish you didn't come today
If you're just gonna leave tomorrow
Bet you're gonna stay away so long
That I ask myself, ("Am I still enough?")
Don't give me a single thing
If it's only something borrowed
Bet you're gonna stay away so long
That I ask myself, ("Am I still in love?")

La, la, la, love me or na, na, not
Love me or na, na, not
Love me or let me rest in peace

Heard your tires on the gravel
Won't put up a battle
It's heaven for a weekend, then a week of demons
Best I ever had though

Wish you didn't come today
If you're just gonna leave tomorrow
Bet you're gonna stay away so long
That I ask myself, ("Am I still enough?")
Don't give me a single thing
If it's only something borrowed
Bet you're gonna stay away so long
That I ask myself, "Am I still in love?"
Oh

La, la, la (oh-oh), love me or na, na, not (love me, love me or not)
Love me or na, na, not
Love me or let me rest in peace
La, la, la, love me or (oh) na, na, not (oh-oh)
Love me or na, na, not
Love me or (oh) let me rest in peace
La, la, la, love me or na, na, not
Love me or na, na, not
Love me or let me rest in peace
