		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey, there's no rules today
You steal instead of borrow; you take all the shapes that I make
You think that you think all the thoughts that are thought you
Don't you?

Mutilation's the most sincere form of flattery
If you want to be me, then stand in line like the rest
Now, do you know what I mean?

[Chorus:]
The young get less bolder, the legends get older
But I stay the same as long as you have less to say
You think that I wouldn't say this
You know that I play this better than you

Fuck you
Fuck you
Fuck you, too
Fuck you
Fuck you
Fuck you, too

Do you really think that I wouldn't say this?
You know that I play this better than you
Rebels without applause; I sell my shadow to those who are standing in it
Who think I would bitch about them thinking they are the shit when they can't even step in it

[Chorus]

Fuck you
Fuck you
Fuck you
Fuck you
Fuck you, too

[Chorus]

Fuck you
Fuck you
And fuck you, too

[Chorus]

Fuck you
Fuck you
Fuck you, too
Fuck you
Fuck you
Fuck you, too
You really think that I wouldn't say this
You know that I play this better than you
