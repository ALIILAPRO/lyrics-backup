		  Hmm ahhh I am on the road
Hmm ahhh follow you dey go
Anywhere you want I go dey close
Tell me anything and I no go say no
Hmm ahhh I am on the road
Hmm ahhh follow you dey go
Anywhere you want I go dey close
Tell me anything and I no go say no
I'm not looking back at all
With you I'm standing tall
Hold my hand I no go fall
You are there when I call
You no leave me hanging
You only leave me bragging
About your love oh
I can't doubt your love oh
Be my commando
Be my commando
I want dey go where you want me to
Go where you want me to
Be my commando
Be my commando
I want de go where you want me to
Go where you want me to
I badder when dem think dem badder gon
My manners no go let me para gon
My God no be like them wey be Akagum
Me I go follow like say I be temple run
Hold me hold me hold me tender o
Go before me make the road blender o
Enemies dey come make you mend dem
Make wetin them talk back to sender o
Away
I no wan want go my way
I wan dey your lane
Oh everyday
Away
I no wan want go my way
I wan dey your lane
Oh everyday
Be my commando
Be my commando
I want dey go where you want me to
Go where you want me to
Be my commando
Be my commando
I want dey go where you want me to
Go where you want me to
Be my commando
Be my commando
I want dey go where you want me to
Go where you want me to
Be my commando
Be my commando
I want de go where you want me to
Go where you want me to
