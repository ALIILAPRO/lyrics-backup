		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You just know
Sometimes you feel it in your bones
Though we've heard that hearts can still beat long
Something's telling me that you're the one
I just know
Even if I had a heart of a stone
You could make it bleed all on your own
You could break it but I hope you won't

I'd burn it down, I'd light it up for you
I'd risk it all

I'd rather crash, I'd rather crawl
Than never have your love at all
With only bricks to break my fall
For you I'd risk it all
Yoohoo yoohoo
Yoohoo yoohoo

Stand your ground
Win or lose I gotta see this out
Go to hell, I'll let you watch me drown (It takes more)
It takes more than this to keep me down

I'd give it in, I'd give it all for you
I'd risk it all

I'd rather crash, I'd rather crawl
Than never have your love at all
With only bricks to break my fall
For you I'd risk it all

Come on just do it
You pull me through it
Come on just do it
You pull me through it
Come on just do it
You pull me through it

I'd burn it down, I'd light up
I'd take the way
I'm strong enough
Not giving in, not giving up

I'd risk it all
I'd risk it all
Than never have your love at all
With only bricks to break my fall
For you I'd risk it all

I'd rather crash, I'd rather crawl
Than never have your love at all
With only bricks to break my fall
For you I'd risk it all
Yoohoo yoohoo
Yoohoo yoohoo
Yoohoo yoohoo
