		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All the lack of symmetry
Fits you so perfectly, lady
Yes, I fall with your clothes 
Take em' off hold me close, baby
Those October eyes
Keep me up all night
Darling, my sunrise is when you go

If God spends extra time
Didn't waste a single dime on you (no, darling)
Bless your arms, bless your breath
Singing songs to my chest as we dance the crowd away

(Oh, October eyes)
(My sunrise)
(Oh, October eyes)

Say you hate your little nose
Girl, I love that little nose always
The way you sway in those jeans 
Means so damn much to me
Yeah, you do

Those October eyes
Couldn't hold one lie
Got my heart so wide
Like windows and stereos

If you are merry for a hangover
Put some gasoline into my motor
Girl, I'd buy a ring if I could afford to, right now
Yeah, you are merry for a hangover
Put some gasoline up in my motor
Girl, I'd buy a ring if I could afford to, right now

October eyes
Yeah
Those October eyes
Ohh, yeah

Those October eyes (you are merry for a hangover)
(Put some gasoline up in my motor)
Those October eyes (girl, I'd buy a ring if I could afford to)
You
