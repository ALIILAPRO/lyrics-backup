		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  she knows 
all the times i cried 
over stupid guys
ohh

and she knows
how to dry my eyes
every single time 
ohh

so

i'm coming over 
he ain't acting right 
i told him that it's over 
(no) 

head on her shoulder
skin to skin she's leaning in 
a little closer
(oh)

and she said
promise i could love you better than the boys do
than the boys do
if you want to 

they don't even know your body the way i do
not like i do
i could show you

what you're missin every time
you're fucking with another guy

I
promise i could love you better than the boys do
than the boys do
if you want to

i like the way i like the way 
she pull up to my place
no excuses 
say she wanna know how good i taste
show me what you gonna do to me 
and you can leave me missing how you handle me 

i'm comin over i can't help it 
cuz i'm thinkin bout her more than i want to

and she said

promise i can love you better than the boys do
than the boys do
if you want to 

they don't even know your body the way i do
not like i do
i could show you

what you're missin every time
you're fucking with another guy

I
promise i could love you better than the boys do
than the boys do
if you want to

(they don't even know your body your body your body)
(no)

and she said 

promise i could love you better than the boys do
than the boys do
if you want to 

they don't even know your body the way i do (body the way i do)
not like i do
i could show you

what you're missin every time
you're fucking with another guy
(with another guy i)

I
promise i could love you better than the boys do
than the boys do
if you want to

(baby lemme love your body your body your body)
(they don't even know your body your body your body)

promise i could love you better than the boys do
