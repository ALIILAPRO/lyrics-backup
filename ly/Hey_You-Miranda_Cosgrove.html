		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You always see the beauty in a passin' cloud
You're the one who fixes me when I'm down
And you don't think twice, do you?
You could find one diamond in a mine
But you're the one who's shinin' for miles around
And you don't see that, do you?

And when the day is done
Do you have the feelin'
That you're all alone
Givin' up on your own dreams?

Hey you, it's your turn to
See the beauty in yourself
Just like you tell everyone else
Hey you, am I gettin' through?
If you would only see yourself
The way you see everyone else
The way I always see you
I see you, hey you, hey you

If you fly like Icarus to the edge
I could be there talkin' you back
Don't forget, that you don't go there, do you?

And when the night is long
Do you wake up hearin'
A voice inside
Callin' out for you, "Oh please"?

Hey you, it's your turn to
See the beauty in yourself
Just like you tell everyone else
Hey you, am I gettin' through?
If you would only see yourself
The way you see everyone else
The way I always see you
I see you

Hidin' in the background
Thinkin' you're not pretty
Holdin' back your thoughts
'Cause who's gonna listen?
Hidin' behind a half-smile
Hey, it's such a pity
Everybody's missin' out
While you're busy
Holdin' it all inside, inside

Hey you, it's your turn to
See the beauty in yourself
Just like you tell everyone else
Hey you, am I gettin' through?
If you would only see yourself
The way you see everyone else
The way I always see you
I see you, hey you
What you're gonna do?
Mmmhmmm
