		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Verse 1:

I can’t be the one for you
Sometimes things just never do
You live only for yourself
So just leave me on the shelf
Where your exes come and go
That’s where you’ll find your ego
Things could never be the same
So I’ll gladly pass the blame

Pre-Chorus

But I know its not just you
I’ve done things to fuck up too
But I'll keep that to myself
Until my dying breath

Verse 2:
As the pain takes its own form
Hope I don’t fight this alone
Life has never been too great
Until you came and broke my fall
But I’ve seen you come and go
And I never let you grow
You saw through my foolish ways
So we took our separate ways

Pre-Chorus

But I know its not just you
I’ve done things to fuck up too
But I'll keep that to myself
Until my dying breath
