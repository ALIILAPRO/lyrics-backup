		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You bring me to life then you shut me out
You keep me silent when I should shout
You make me cry and you make me come
You are the cop and I'm on the run

It all begins with just one kiss
I'm held hostage by your love
Put me in cuffs, lock me up
I'm held hostage by your touch
This prison is rough but I can't get enough
The secret life of us keeps me in handcuffs
Don't lock me up, don't you wanna free us
I'm held hostage by your love

Then you let me out and I catch the sun
You give me a taste of you and no one
But you always leave, and again I'm alone
This secret burns but I'm imprisoned

It all begins with just one kiss
I'm held hostage by your love
Put me in cuffs, lock me up
I'm held hostage by your touch
This prison is rough but I can't get enough
The secret life of us keeps me in handcuffs
Don't lock me up, don't you wanna free us
I'm held hostage by your love

Secret life of lovers who have others
Under the covers
And while you break my heart
I'm a criminal in these parts

It all begins with just one kiss
I'm held hostage by your love
Put me in cuffs, lock me up
I'm held hostage by your touch
This prison is rough but I can't get enough
The secret life of us keeps me in handcuffs
Don't lock me up, don't you wanna free us
I'm held hostage by your love

It all begins with just one kiss
I'm held hostage by your love
Put me in cuffs, lock me up
I'm held hostage by your touch
This prison is rough but I can't get enough
The secret life of us keeps me in handcuffs
Don't lock me up, don't you wanna free us
I'm held hostage by your love

Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh
