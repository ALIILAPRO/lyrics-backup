		  Life Has Passed Me By

I don't ever wanna be an old man
with barely just enough to get by
and I'm fed up cause I'm never going nowhere (at all)
I guess the perk of having nothing is at least i have nothing to lose
I've been saying it so long
I'm heading to the top and 
aint nobody gonna stop me, yeah right 
even as I write this song 
I just can't be bothered 
cause what's the point in moaning?

(CHORUS)
I get so wasted sometimes 
But it feels like wasting my time
Is this the end of the line?
Cause I can't help thinking 
Life has passed me by

I know I'm a cynic and a moaner
But did I peak in summer 09?
I never ever wanna grow up cause I'm older at all
It's better to have loved and lost than never to have tried

I've been telling you so long
I'm heading to the top and aint 
nobody gonna stop me, yeah right 
I'm not ready to disarm
My best years are behind me
And no one can console me


(CHORUS)
I get so wasted sometimes 
But it feels like wasting my time
Is this the end of the line?
Cause I can't help thinking 
Life has passed me by

Lookin back got me tearful
I'm a mess, I'm a weirdo
Waiting for a sign
Was I in my prime? No
In a van, with a can, flickin fags out the window - where'd the years go?
Wish I had more time
Life has passed me by though
