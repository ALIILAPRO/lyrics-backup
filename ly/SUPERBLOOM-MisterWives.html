		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Resilient little thing
Just like mama made you
No one needs to save you
Ah-na-na, ah-na-na, ah-na-na
Wildflower in the spring
No, they can't contain you
Through the cracks you break through
Ah-na-na, ah-na-na, ah-na-na

I deserve congratulations
'Cause I came out the other side
I've been having revelations
And I'm gon' let them shine
I deserve congratulations
I never thought that I'd survive
If you tell me I won't make it
That's when I, that's when I

Superbloom
Superbloom
Superbloom
Superbloom

Resilient little thing
Just like mama raised you
So you've got that
Wildfire in your soul
Don't you ever let it go
Make it burn so bright
That they all know

I deserve congratulations
'Cause I came out the other side
I've been having revelations
And I'm gon' let them shine
I deserve congratulations
I never thought that I'd survive
If you tell me I won't make it
That's when I, that's when I

Superbloom
Superbloom
Superbloom
Superbloom
Superbloom
Superbloom
Superbloom
Superbloom

Never rained in the desert, 'til I
Picked me for the very first time
It's darkest before the sunrise
That's when I

Never rained in the desert, 'til I
Picked me for the very first time
It's darkest before the sunrise
That's when I

Superbloom
Superbloom
Superbloom
Superbloom

I deserve congratulations
'Cause I came out the other side
I've been having revelations
And I'm gon' let them shine
I deserve congratulations
I never thought that I'd survive
If you tell me I won't make it
That's when I, that's when I

Superbloom
Superbloom
Superbloom
Superbloom
Superbloom (yeah, I deserve congratulations)
Superbloom ('cause I came out the other side)
Superbloom (if you tell me I won't make it)
Superbloom (that's when I)
