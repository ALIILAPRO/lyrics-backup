		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Okay, you back stab me
Bitch, I gave you my all
I'm in this black Caddy
I'm finna drive til I'm gone
I feel so damn saddened
Just by the way it resolved
I pull my heart out everyday and stitch that bitch into my arm
Know no way to live, this weight to lift is similar to God
I can't fade a bit cause saving this my only fuckin' part
In this play we in, I'm vacant when it come to any else
So tryna' find a way around the trauma feel like it won't help, nah
Feel like I'm in hell, stop
Blowing up my cellphone
I got so much weight to push and don't wish shit went well, no
Made me who I am, quick
Take the world for ransom
I'm tryna' get in everything my people need these answers,

I know nobody got em',
Roll in with the Boston, what?
I lit it up and sonically come with super phonics, yo
I feel a lack of knowledge when I hear these rappers speak
Stay walking off the leash at least the path it hit my feet, please
Believe sight cause we I'm seaside and we moving sick, got
Big swervin' and big servin' up in this bitch, we
Freewavin' I seen angles that they would miss
I hit the freeway going AWOL straight into the mist
That's soap
