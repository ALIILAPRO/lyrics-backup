		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Whip, bought it
Crib, got it
Job, on it
Did I ever
Ask you to take me to go
Shopping in Paris or go
Sailing overseas and just
Drape me in Gucci? No
All I ever asked was you to
Pick up the phone when you alone
All I ever asked was you to
Show me some love, kisses and hugs
No, I never had an issue
Go to the club with your boys, baby, I
Never wanted you to stay too long
Just wanted you to show me off

So won't you say my name, say my name?
If you claim you want me, it ain't no thang
You actin' kinda shady
You ain't been callin' me baby, oh
Boy, you can gon' stop playing games
Playing games

I know you say you hit my line
I'm on your mind, and that
You want this bad
So I'm cool with that
I'm just tryna match your words with your actions
I need more than satisfaction
Is you really 'bout that action?
You really wanna give your all
But flex in front of your friends
How that work?
Swear that you doin' the most
But we take a picture, can't post it
How that work?
Quit your talkin', back that shit up
Won't you say my, say my

So won't you say my name, say my name?
If you claim you want me, it ain't no thang
You actin' kinda shady
You ain't been callin' me baby, oh
Boy, you can gon' stop playing games (yeah)
Playing games (yeah)

I blow your mind, honey (damn)
Say it one time, honey (goddamn)
Sick of 'em lies
Tell 'em goodbye
Get in my ride
I wanna come by
I wanna just listen
Get in your vibe
Get in your feelings
Get in your
I get in your feelings
Not in your business
I wanna get kisses
And I wanna get
I wanna get with you, yeah
I wanna get him out of the picture, yeah
I made it my mission, yeah
And despite the difference, yeah
Me, I'm never actin' shady
You will always be my baby
You'll be my baby, yeah, yeah
