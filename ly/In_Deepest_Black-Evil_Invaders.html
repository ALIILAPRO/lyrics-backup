		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Thrown off the edge, stranded in hell
The mind is restless in this desert where I dwell
The darkness deep within me, a drought that seems to last
Trapped in a mental cage that's stuck inside the past

Freezing nights, hot blistering days
I feel my grip on life just slipping away
Speechless in terms of answers, questions I fail to ask
The storm is raging on the inside of my mask


Alone in total darkness
Memories won't take me back
Can't someone tell me why I'm
Lost in deepest black
Along with all this madness
No trace of any track
Forever left to wander
Lost in deepest black


The wind is raging, sand covers every wound
The scars of time leave me broken and marooned
A restless soul in anguish, broken by endless pain
The sun is setting, I'm led astray

Another night, takes me to hell
Another night leaves me to dwell
Just tame the beast that drags me through this living hell!


Alone in total darkness
Memories won't take me back
Can't someone tell me why I'm
Lost in deepest black
Along with all this madness
No trace of any track
Forever left to wander
Lost in deepest black


Alone in total darkness
Memories won't take me back
Can't someone tell me why I'm
Lost in deepest black
Along with all this madness
No trace of any track
Forever left to wander...
In deepest black
