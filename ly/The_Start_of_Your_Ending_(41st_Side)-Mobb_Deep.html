		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I keep it real pack steel like my man Y.G
When a fool try to play me wet 'em up then I'm Swayze
You must be crazy kid
Man I never did forever wildin' that's how we live up in the Bridge
You just sit scared cock back the gat then hit a nigga like a bid
25 naw kid you gettin' life
Forever burnin' in hell niggas is trife
It's the, semi auto you can bring it on yo
I'm pullin' out strippin' niggas just like a porno flick
I'm sick the Mobb rolls thick
Cross paths with my clique and get vic
I'm on some bullshit that's how I was raised G
Slept at the stage have you slippin' down blazin'
In pools of alcohol walk before you crawl
I'm in this to win this you gonna take a fall
Infamous Queensbridge kid we on the scene kid
Creepin' for those that's caught sleepin'
Don't ever do that I run with two macs
And plus my crew back my every move
I choose givin' crews the blues
I'm open off the Damey
Obey me or get sprayed with the sweeper
Cause I'm my brothers keeper
The Grim Reaper holdin' with nothin' but big batters
And big heaters
Blow ya three times leave a mark like Adidas
Jig you I know how to fix you
Pretty boy niggas frontin' hard is the issue
Word to my unborn you get scolded
Old and molded when I get bent you get folded
Every rhyme is the truth that I must get cross
Put your right on your back take it to the source
No doubt I'm stuck and I can't get out
Of this lifestyle the 41st side get bent run wild
The 41st side two you know how we do
Violate motherfucker I'm a see you, with the Lenden
It's the start of your endin' settin' it again and again

Yo, it's the P. E. double push a Lex bubble in the winter
You can't come alone only the hoes can enter
Told him to meet me at six on the hill at the center
Took her to the west way and bent her right over
Stay intoxicated, never sober
Face it, violate and get laced while you wasting
Slugs you ain't buckin' nothing
You better off buckin' yourself you need to stop fronting
I used to drive an Ac and kept a Mac in the engine
Littles painted it black with crack sale intentions
To blow up the whole projects the Infamous
Our sons will grow up to be murderers and terrorists
It's the nigga in me accompanied by the cognac
You can ask around, don't fuck with the Mobb
I could've told you that, where you been at
You must have cut class
If it ain't me, another member of my crew will kick your ass (what what)
We do damage to limbs
In '91, stomping you out with black Timbs
Prodigy and the H.A.V.O.C. from the Q.B.C
Putting cowards where they're supposed to be
If I don't know your face then don't come close to me
I got too much beef for that
Drama in the 3rd degree
And to the kids you don't wanna be me
I'm up in the mix of action, where niggas wanna kill me
But it's the start of they ending my man's lending
Me his linden forty-two shots depending
On whether or not the clip is full to the top
We busting caps non-stop
Blazing in all the shows and even at the hoes

Naw naw chill son chill

And it's the start of your ending
Yeah, yeah it's the start of niggas ending, you know what I'm sayin?
And it's the start of your ending
All y'all weak-ass crews that got drama with mines, you know what I'm sayin'
It's the start of your ending
And it's the motherfuckin' start of the ending
You know who you fuckin' with
(Yeah, yeah nigga) you know what will happen
(Recognize and realize)
41st side get bent, run wild
41st side get bent, run wild
Word up you know what I'm sayin'?
