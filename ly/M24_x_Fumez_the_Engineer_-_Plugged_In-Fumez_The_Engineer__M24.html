		<p>
		  Heh, M24 you know
Plugged In with Fumez, yeah
Get back or get stretched
Gang shit, you know
They know the ting
Free all the fucking mandem, you know
Yeah, shout out my nigga Fumez, heh

I'm pissed that I didn't whack my man
But bro got, instead (niggas know)
Don't try glide on the gang like, did 
Cah you might just end up dead (dead boy)
Put, in the wood and smoke him
That shit's going straight to my head
I been on every single block that I beef
The beef can't dead 'til the opps are dead (mhm)
I'm fully on wass, yes (me)
I say that shit on my chest
This not a Biggie, Christopher Wallace (no)
Cah the man's been shot or cheffed
What's next? Hold on a sec
Man's really out 'ere and I'm known to the Met (I'm known to the)
(Talk, talk) Talk on the Get Backs when your friends got stretched (dead boy)
I been out here since kway back
Man can't tell man nuttin'
All of these new plates talkin' wass (new yutes)
I'm soon gonna show man suttin'
We don't take violation, we violate (us man)
Pull up on their block, they're cutting (why you running?)
Forty-two quid on my wrist
They can't chat for me, are you buzzing?

Four man got slapped on a drip (boaw)
Two man got packed on my strip
Angel Town where the demons be (A-Town)
Come round here man ruin that drip
Don't slip, or get done up
Just like I done it on the 6
Me and SMan done him on the mains
And me and BD done him with a flicks (rip that)
Free Snoop, he's known to shoot
Straight headshot for that eediat yute (mhm)
Before rapping, I was out drilling
I didn't see you, nigga where was you?
Came a long way from a 2 in a Q
Them man still ringin' on a 2 in a Q
Them man popped up from out of the blue
Everybody's rapping now
Look, everybody's chatting now
Look, everybody's capping now
If I talk 'bout the things we done, it's foul
We ain't on that rap battle shit, no 8 Mile (no way)
We just pull up and do it in style
Come back to the ends and smoke on loud (heh)

The young boys really on wass
Go over there and do gang proud (go over there)
When that point got scored 'round there, I smiled (yes)
She knows man's young and lit, now I got this bad one movin' wild
He got ripped in his drip and drowned
Now he's in the ground got lost, not found
Pronounced, smoked like an ounce
Do the drill with the boys then bounce
Ayy, bro-bro bring that out
Watch bro-bro rinse that out (grrrt, grrrt, boaw)
Spot them in a whip, man spin that now (spin that)
Opp block, gotta spin back 'round
Why you think that the GB's talk of the town?
I heard they're tryna get back on my homies
Get back what?
Country days I was setting up shop
Had to better myself why you think I'm on top?
Mainstream in this ting but I'm fully on opps
Got shot with a mop but that boy never dropped (mhm)
(Grrt, baow) I was pissed when I heard that boy never dropped

(Fumez The Engineer)
