		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A cynic, I'm hopeless, I'm broken
There is no light inside of me
I'm tired, I'm restless, I'm lonesome
But I can never sleep
My mind plays games when I'm alone now
You said the worst things to
Get inside my head
Intoxication takes control now
Self-medication takes it's grip

I'm crawling on the floor
(Take deep breaths, your heart is racing)
There's clawing at the door
Oh God, don't let 'em take me

Now I have to find a way out
I have to find my voice
I'm entertaining thoughts that are
No good for me

When I'm completely numb
A darkness takes me
I turn into someone I hate completely

It's me against the world
(Take cover, you cannot fix me)
Just throw me to the wolves
I'm a victim of self-pity

Now I have to find a way out
I have to find my voice
I'm entertaining thoughts that are
No good for me now I have to find a way back
I have to make a choice
I'm never losing sight of what's
In front of me

I've given up i'm in for a lifetime of
Second-guessing everything that I've become
My mind plays games when I'm alone
Self-medicated, intoxication takes control
Now I have to find my way out
I have to find my voice
These thoughts are no good for me

Now I have to find a way out
I have to find my voice
I'm entertaining thoughts that are
No good for me now I have to find a way back
I have to make a choice
I'm never losing sight of what's
In front of me–º
