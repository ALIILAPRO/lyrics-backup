		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I diggin' with my fingertips
I'm gripping at the ground I stand upon
I'm searching for fragile bones
(Evolution)

I'm never gonna be refined
Keep trying but I won't assimilate
Should we have come far in time
(Watch the bow break)

And I'm sorry that I don't believe
By the evidence that I see
That there's any hope left for me
It's evolution
Just evolution

And I, I do not dare deny
The basic beast inside
It's right here, it's controlling my mind
And why do I deserve to die?
I'm dominated by
This animal that's locked up inside

Close up to get a real good view
I'm betting that the species will survive
Pull tight, I'm getting inside you
(Evolution)

And when were gonna find these bones
They're gonna wanna keep them in a jar
The number one virus caused by
(Procreation)

And the planet may go astray
In a million years I say
Those motherfuckers were all deranged
It's evolution
Just evolution

And I, I do not dare deny
The basic beast inside
It's right here, it's controlling my mind
And why do I deserve to die?
I'm dominated by
This animal that's locked up inside

Take a look around (take a look around, take a look around, take a look around)
Nothing much has changed (take a look around, take a look around, take a look around)
Take a look around (take a look around, take a look around, take a look around)
Nothing much has changed (take a look around, take a look around, take a look around)

Take a look around
Take a look around
Take a look around (nothing much has changed)
Take a look around

Take a look around (nothing much has changed)
Take a look around
Take a look around (nothing much has changed)
Take a look around

I, I do not dare deny
The basic beast inside
It's right here, it's controlling my mind
And why do I deserve to die?
I'm dominated by
This animal that's locked up inside

Why? (Why, why, why)
Why do I deserve to die? (Do I deserve to die? why, why)
