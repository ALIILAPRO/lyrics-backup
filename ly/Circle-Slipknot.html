		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Give me the dust of my father
Stand on the face of the ancients
Bare the secret flesh of time itself

Follow me (follow me)
I've come so far behind again
Follow me (follow me)
Wish so hard I'm there again
Follow me (follow me)
Follow me (follow me)

All that I wanted the things I had before
All that I needed I've never needed more
All of my questions were answers to my sins
All of my endings are waiting to begin

I know the way but I falter
I can't be afraid of my patience
There's a sacred place Razel keeps safe

Follow me (follow me)
I've seen so much I'm blind again
Follow me (follow me)
I feel so bad I'm alive again
Follow me (follow me)

All that I wanted the things I had before
All that I needed I've never needed more
All of my questions were answers to my sins
All of my endings waiting to begin
