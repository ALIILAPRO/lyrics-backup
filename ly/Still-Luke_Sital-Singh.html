		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm still hoping it's ever coming
Just tell me something can I stop running?

Yeah, I broke through
Walls to get back up to yours
Now I am unglued nothing left undone

The light is coming on everywhere
Something in the back of my mind
Is running scared
Time is running on year on year
River ever rolling
But I'm still standing here oh, I'm still

The hours soften the heavens open
One look in your eyes and I know, I know
I'm almost home one look in your eyes

The light is coming on everywhere
Something in the back of my mind
Is running scared
Time is running on year on year
River ever rolling
But I'm still standing here oh, I'm still

Rest assured my soul
That everyone's restless
It's been quite a fall for everyone
You've got more than most
So look above the sun

The light is coming on everywhere
Something in the back of my mind
Is running scared
The time is running on year on year
River ever rolling
But I'm still standing here

The light is coming on everywhere
Something in my mind is scared
Oh, I'm still
