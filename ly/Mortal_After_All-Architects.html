		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I guess we're mortal after all

One day all of us will give up the ghost
Too lost in the light to see what matters most
All ends will be met
And all worlds must collapse

Another part of the symphony lost between eternity
But God is in the detail
I know that there's a part of me, doomed to face infinity
'Cause every wave has gotta break
Has gotta break

The truth is, all of us are hostages
Staring down the throat of the screaming abyss
Surrendering is half the battle
But we're powerless to resist

Another part of the symphony lost between eternity
But God is in the detail
I know that there's a part of me, doomed to face infinity
'Cause every wave has gotta break

Have you forgotten the deal we made?
I've seen the end and the pain we trade
All these walls will fall
I guess we're mortal after all
The end will come for all of us
This all rests on the fault line
All ends will be met
And all worlds must collapse

Another part of the symphony lost between eternity
But God is in the detail
I know that there's a part of me, doomed to face infinity
'Cause every wave has gotta break
Has gotta break, yeah

Have you forgotten the deal we made?
I've seen the end and the pain we trade
All these walls will fall
I guess we're mortal after all
