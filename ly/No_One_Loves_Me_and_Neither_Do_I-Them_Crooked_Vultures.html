		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Think I saw her for the first time maybe in a news stand
She was picking a mag and dressed oblique
She called me baby, and was a mean lady with the song on the radio
So I told her I was rich, then she asked could I use a dirty bitch? (of course)

[Chorus]
Then she said, 'No one loves me' neither do I
You get what you give,
I give goodbye
And if I should vanish
Don't get caught off guard
Don't hold it against me
Unless it gets hard

(Oh, oi, oo, oop! Aaawhhha, yea, aaawhhha, that's right)

Well if sex is a weapon, then smash, boom, pow,
How ya like me now?
You can't always do it right, you can always do whats left
So I told her I was trash, she winked and laughed and said I already know
I've got a beautiful place to put your face' and she was right,

[Chorus]

Cutting her loose, I'm ready to go
People in the world, your gonna lose control
Cut me a noose, I'm ready to go
People in the world, your gonna lose control
Cut me a noose, I'm ready to go
People in the world, your gonna lose control
Cut me a noose, I'm ready to go
People in the world, you're gonna lose

I know how to burn with passion
Hold nothing back for future ration
Give all you are, do not make haste
Savor every single taste

You get, cut

I know how to be controlled
Do what they said, son, watch your tongue
Quick to react, to break the box
Turn on queue, as your cell door locks
Behind you

I know how to be lost in lust
Not because you should, but because you must
It burns white hot, and so climbs the mile
This lightening strike isn't always kind

So use me up
Use me up
