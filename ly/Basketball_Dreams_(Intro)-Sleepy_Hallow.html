		  (Great John on the beat, by the way)

Look, huh
Remember I had basketball dreams, huh
I hit the block and shot a different type of three, huh
Said they love me, I don't know what that mean, huh
Started ballin', now these bitches playin' D, huh
Smokin' gas so my pockets never E
I'm in somethin' fast and it's probably AMG, huh
Fear no man, I know everybody bleed, huh
Stuck up in my ways, I'm a different type of breed, huh

I'm the wave, I hope everybody see, huh
Ocean on my neck, I pull up smokin' out the B, huh
But she want me to fuck her, make her famous, she think I made it
That's the reason when I pull up she be naked, uh
She gon' throw it to me, never take it
And my pockets full of dead niggas' faces
(She gon' throw it to me, never take it)
(And my pockets full of dead niggas' faces) 

Look
Remember I had basketball dreams, huh
I hit the block and shot a different type of three, huh
Said they love me, I don't know what that mean, huh
Started ballin', now these bitches playin' D, huh
Smokin' gas so my pockets never E
I'm in somethin' fast and it's probably AMG, huh
Fear no man, I know everybody bleed, huh
Stuck up in my ways, I'm a different type of breed, huh
