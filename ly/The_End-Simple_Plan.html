		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been trying to tell you something but you never understand
I feel like we've been going around in circles
You look at me like I've become a stranger on the street
A skeleton that's hiding in your closet

I see you next to me but still you feel so far away
Where did we go wrong?
Where did we go wrong?
I guess this is the part where you look at me and say goodbye

Don't, don't let me go
It's not the end, whoa
Girl you know it's not so bad
It's not the end, whoa
You know it's not the end

I've been around the world and I have seen so many things
I can't even tell you where I'm going
But no matter where I'm heading
And no matter what I do
Something keeps me coming back to you

I see you next to me but still you feel so far away
Where did we go wrong?
Where did we go wrong?
I guess this is the part where you look at me and say goodbye

Don't, don't let me go
It's not the end, whoa
Girl you know it's not so bad
It's not the end, whoa
You know it's not the end

Don't, don't let me go
It's not the end, whoa
Girl you know it's not so bad
It's not the end, whoa
You know it's not the end

What can I do when you're gone
When it feels so wrong
What can I say to make you wanna stay?
So what can I do?
Don't leave me this way
Cause it feels so wrong
Let's stop all these games
Cause I just can't say goodbye

Don't, don't let me go
It's not the end, whoa
Girl you know it's not so bad
It's not the end, whoa
You know it's not the end

Don't, don't let me go
It's not the end, whoa
Girl you know it's not so bad
It's not the end, whoa
You know it's not the end
