		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I am the man who holds the keys
I sew the seeds and I've got what you need
I live in fire, I am discord
I destroy, I am the demon

Weight of the world, the price of a fighter
And I decide where you make your stand

Rise up, resist and disorder
Rise up, resist and disorder  

Nowhere to run, it's all undone
Everything burns, everything burns
I'll watch you fall down, I'll drag you face-down
Everything burns, everything burns  

Behind the veil is the machine
It steals your soul, devouring all your dreams
My hand is firm upon the wheel
I control, I am the demon

Hate for the world, the birth of a soldier
And I decide if you live or die

Rise up, resist and disorder
Rise up, resist and disorder  

Nowhere to run, it's all undone
Everything burns, everything burns
I'll watch you fall down, I'll drag you face-down
Everything burns, everything burns  

Nowhere to run, it's all undone
Everything burns, everything burns
I'll watch you fall down, I'll drag you face-down
Everything burns, everything burns  

Nowhere to run, it's all undone
Everything burns, everything burns
I'll watch you fall down, I'll drag you face-down
Everything burns, everything burns
