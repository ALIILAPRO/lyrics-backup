		  3. What's Become Of Us
I always wonder ... why you feel so proud inside
 When those were days of crime and wasted lives
And you keep comin' ... try to justify
The very wrong that comes to tear you apart

Chorus 
Does anybody ever dream?
Does anybody ever win?
What's become of us?

Does anybody still believe?
The only good that's left of me
Shines in you

Whenever you claim you are the ruler of this land
You're painting a lie that you call destiny
And now when you testify before your time is gone
I finally know where the sinners go

Chorus - Solo - Chorus
