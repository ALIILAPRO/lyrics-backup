		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I sign autographs in the visitation room
Waiting for you the last time
Inmate 502

Daddy's home

You still got it in ya
Government green suit
And I look down and out 
In my fine Italian shoes
And we're tight as a bible
With the pages stuck like glue
Yeah, you did some time
Well, I did some time too

Daddy's home

Ow
Ow
Ow

Daddy's home
Daddy's home
Daddy's home
Daddy's home
Daddy's home
Daddy's home
Daddy's home

We're all good puritans
They'll pray about reform
You swore you had paid your dues
Then put a payday into your uniform
We're all born innocent
But some good saints get screwed
But hell, where can you run
When the outlaw's inside you

Ow
Daddy's home
Daddy's home
Daddy's home
Daddy's home
Daddy's home
Daddy's home
Daddy's home
Daddy's home
Daddy's home

Yeah
Oh
Ow
Daddy's home
Daddy's home
Daddy's home
Daddy's home
Daddy's home
Daddy's home
Daddy's home

Daddy's home
