		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  To be the best
We got to pass the test
We gotta make it all the way
To the top of the mountain
We can do it again!
To feel the high
We got to learn to fly
We got to take it to the sky
On the wings of an eagle!

You're the best in the world!

You are the best but you say you don't know
You got the touch, now come on let it show
You call the shots
But you know that you gots to believe in
The things that you're dreaming
Your search for the meaning
Is very revealing
The power of being
Is what you're feeling
You gotta believe
That you're simply the best!
