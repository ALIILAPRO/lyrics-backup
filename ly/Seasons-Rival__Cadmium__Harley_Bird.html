		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The seasons come and go like thoughts of you
Like a wave returns to the sea into the blue
They change but in a cycle that I can’t lose
Each painful but delightful to live through

You came into my life
Just like another season
Not for long, just a time
Just like another season

Maybe this time next year you’ll reappear for no reason 
But I’ll cherish everyday till you come my way this season

The seasons turn and change just like your mind 
Like the sun gives into the moon
Into the night
Time continues marching
It slowly crawls
With each new one starting
I recall

You came into my life
Just like another season
Not for long, just a time
Just like another season 

Maybe this time next year you’ll reappear for no reason 
But I’ll cherish everyday till you come my way this season

Each time of year carries memories
Like an ever fading whisper in the breeze
Oh we will keep on changing all over again
Yeah we will keep on changing
Just like another season

Don’t want another day without you by my side
Another season

You came into my life
Just like another season
Not for long, just a time
Just like another season
