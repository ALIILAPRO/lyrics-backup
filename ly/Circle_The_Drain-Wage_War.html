		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I had a dream
Where we were side by side
Would you believe
In a world where we weren't blind?
I saw us free
From pain and hate inside
But I woke to see
It was all just in my mind

I finally looked inside myself
And found my debt to pay
And if you took the chance
I think you'd probably feel the same

If we really wanna change
We gotta learn from our mistakes
Can we start over, start over?
With a past we can't erase
And a stain to every name
Will we find closure or circle the drain?
Circle the drain

We fill our heads
With lies and chemicals
And wonder when
The side effects withdraw

I finally looked inside myself
And found my debt to pay
And if you took the chance
I think you'd probably feel the same

If we really wanna change
We gotta learn from our mistakes
Can we start over, start over?
With a past we can't erase
And a stain to every name
Will we find closure or circle the drain?

They come to devour what solace breeds
The wolves are waiting, the hunt begins with me
The hunt begins with me
(I finally looked inside myself
And found my debt to pay
And if you took the chance
I think you'd probably feel the same)

If we really wanna change
We gotta learn from our mistakes
Can we start over, start over?
Can we start over, start over?

If we really wanna change
We gotta learn from our mistakes
Can we start over, start over?
With a past we can't erase
And a stain to every name
Will we find closure or circle the drain?
Will we find closure or circle the drain?
