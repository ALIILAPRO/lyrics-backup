		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The sky is red, I don't understand
Past midnight I still see the land
People are sayin' the woman is damned
She makes you burn with a wave of her hand 

The city's ablaze, the town's on fire 
The woman's flames are reaching higher 
We were fools, we called her liar 
All I hear is, "Burn"

I didn't believe she was devil's sperm 
She said, "Curse you all, you'll never learn
When I leave there's no return "
The people laughed till she said, "Burn"

Warning came, no one cared 
Earth was shakin', we stood and stared 
When it came, no one was spared 
Still I hear, "Burn"

You know we had no time
We could not even try 
You know we had no time 

You know we had no time
We could not even try 
You know we had no time 

The sky is red, I don't understand
Past midnight I still see the land 
People are sayin' the woman is damned
She makes you burn with a wave of her hand 

Warning came, no one cared 
Earth was shakin, we stood and stared 
When it came, no one was spared 
Still I hear, "Burn"
