		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Reached out for your hand
But it's not there
Where did it go? 
Where did you go?

You left me all alone 
Now I'm on my own
You said goodbye 
Don't wanna see your face on my phone

Why did you leave me?
And why did I think it was meant to be?
Why did it hurt so badly?
You were good to me
You were good to me
But did you ever hurt for me?

I feel like I might drown 
And falling down
I wanted you to be around
But you were nowhere to be found

You left me all alone 
Now I'm on my own
You said goodbye 
Don't wanna see your face on my phone

Why did you leave me?
And why did I think it was meant to be?
Why did it hurt so badly?
You were good to me
You were good to me
But did you ever hurt for me?

I want to say I love you
But you left, what should I do?
I tried to forget you 
But you left, what should I do?

Why did you leave me?
And why did I think it was meant to be?
Why did it hurt so badly?
You were good to me
You were good to me
But did you ever hurt for me?
