		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's a ghost in my bedroom, it haunts me at night
I've asked him to leave, but he keeps stopping by
Just when I think that I'm alone, it shows up again with a friend this time
And now this is getting old
I don't know what to do
Metaphorically, this ghost is you

Now this ghost in my bedroom it gives me advice
He promised one day that he'd teach me to fight
Now when I think that I'm alone, he comes up my way with a devil's smile singing
"This is now my home. You're my wish come true"
When you reach that golden cloud, I'll be there with you

If there were monsters in the closet
Well, I don't think I would be surprised
I hear them call out from my window
They try and trick me to come outside
(I won't let you down)
We talked all day
I can't tell if he's real or a made-up version of her again
Never alone 'cause I've got you
Get this out of my head

No I won't waste away my love onto something new
If there's only one way out, I'll come back for you

If I get stuck out there forever
Tell everyone that I said goodbye
You're on my lifelong list of wishes
And I could bring you back, but we don't belong here now

If he stays, well that just means I've got numbered days
'Til I go back to my little world where it's just me and my imaginary friends

So go on, love, find a new direction
(Hold my heart, keep it for protection)
And don't get stuck on your way
The other side's a scary place
(Do your best not to be afraid)
Lose it all when we run away
(Letting go of the little things you know that I do)

There's a ghost in my bedroom, and he's dying to meet you
(Ah, ah)
God knows he's heard all about you
I guess he's friendly enough though
I'll see him more
(There's a ghost in my bedroom)
Always sneaking roses in your bed
(Ah, ah)
He's in your bed, says he won't let you down
He will, he will, he will

(There's a ghost in my bedroom)
(Ah, ah)
(He will, he will, he will)
(When the world is crashing down, when the world is crashing down)

Softly, slowly how can I go down?
I want you to notice when I let go
Softly, slowly how can I come down?
I want you to notice when I let go

(There's a ghost in my bedroom)
(Ah, ah)
