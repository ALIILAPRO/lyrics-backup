		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've learned the world it never moves in a straight line
Like my midnight insides reeking holy havoc on the west side
I hide dry and bitter lights under my riptide eyes
I'm afraid of my infinite little mind

I love you like a sailor loves the sea
With longing and terror and envy
But I want too much and I think I'll be okay
If I just fill myself up cause I don't know another way

How does your heart have so many doors
And why do I find it so hard to be cared for
But don't hold it against me (don't hold it against, don't hold it against, don't hold it against me)
I'm still learning how to be saved
So don't hold it against me (don't hold it against, don't hold it against, don't hold it against me)
I'm not ready to be rearranged

Don't hold it against me
Don't hold it against me

Our crowded futures will be filled with acid rainbows
And maybe love will be the only way to make it feel like home
