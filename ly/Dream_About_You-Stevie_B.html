		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There was a time in my life
When I opened my eyes
And there you were
You were more than a dream

I could reach out and touch you girl
That was long ago
There are some things
That I guess I'll never know

When you love someone
You gotta learn to let them go

When I dream about you
That's when everything's alright
You're in my arms, here next to me, forever
When I dream about you, girl you never go away
Just close my eyes, wait for my dreams
'Cause I still love loving you.

How can I get you to see
That I'm falling apart
Since you've been gone
I can never be sure
I could ever let go

Your love is much too strong
There are some things
That I guess I'll never know
When you love someone
You gotta learn to let them go

When I dream about you
That's when everything's alright
You're in my arms, here next to me, forever
When I dream about you, girl you never go away
Just close my eyes, wait for my dreams
'Cause I still love loving you.

There are some things
That I guess I'll never know
When you love someone
You gotta learn to let them go

When I dream about you
That's when everything's alright
You're in my arms, here next to me, forever
When I dream about you, girl you never go away
Just close my eyes, wait for my dreams
'Cause I still love loving you.
