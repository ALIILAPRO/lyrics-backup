		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'll keep my screams within
Bite my hand until it bleeds
Won't let it show
Won't let it show
Never let it show

But if you're feeling down
And nothing's real around
Just let it go
Just let it go
Just give me a call
And I'll never let you down

'Cause it's just something to depend on
For when it hurts
A little thing to ease the pain
For when it hurts
And you'll need it by your side
For when it hurts
Keep it close to stay alive
For when it hurts

It's just that we're all alone
It's just that we're all alone
It's just that we're all alone
All alone while we go

Some of us can't make it
Make it through the show
Some of us can't make it
Make it through the show

Just let it go
Just let it go
Just give me a call

'Cause it's just something to depend on
For when it hurts
A little thing to ease the pain
For when it hurts
And you'll need it by your side
For when it hurts
Keep it close to stay alive
For when it hurts
