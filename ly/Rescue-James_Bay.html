		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I found you all alone
I came to warm your bones
There were twenty million tears in your hands
You found me in the dark
You came to heal my scars
I was slipping, sinking through the sand

They say the more you love, the harder you fall
But I would rather hurt than nothing at all
Through the good, through the bad, through the lonely
I always rescue you, you always rescue me

We never draw the line
But only 'cause you're mine
Only 'cause you promise me I'm yours
You made me fall apart
My sewn together heart
Is better when you're walking through the door
You know you keep me alive, oh

They say the more you love, the harder you fall
But I would rather hurt than nothing at all
Through the good, through the bad, through the lonely
I always rescue you, you always rescue me

I rescue you
You rescue me

I shelter you, you guide me
I lose myself, you find me
I shelter you, you guide me
I shelter you

They say the more you love, the harder you fall
But I would rather hurt than nothing at all
Through the good, through the bad, through the lonely
I always rescue you, you always rescue me

I always rescue you
I rescue you
You always rescue me
You rescue me
I always rescue you
I rescue you
Oh, I always rescue you
You always rescue me
