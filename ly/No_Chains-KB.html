		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Aye, aye
A-K, Ok, Ok, Ok, Ok

I was running with the set (yeah)
Running with the set (yeah)
We don't ever flex, we just rep
Hear me, no, what did you expect? (what did you expect?)
I don't need respect
I'm the threat (ah)

Tell 'em I'm so free I got no chains on me
I'm so free I got no chains homie
Nappy hair, nappy hair, no shame, homie
I'm so free I got no chains on me
I'm so free I got no chains on me
I'm so free I got no chains on me
I'm so free I got no chains homie
I'm so free I got
Running through the

Right back where I started with it (aye)
I've been off since college with it (aye)
They hit the club, I hit religion (aye)
Jesus, Jesus I'll admit it (aye)
I just came from living reckless (aye)
You just give up Insta snaps (aye)
Do we need another post? (aye)
You insecure, you do the most

On my side we revive God through the WiFi
T'Challa poppin, never colonize 'round the high-fives for the top God, made us dangerous
Ain't a bust, flame with us, every idol bring to us, gangs of us
Trained to trust and man that's bloodstains of us Christ gained us

I was running with the shade yeah
I was running through with chains yeah
We don't flex, we invest hear me, yeah
This is what you get, yeah
I don't need respect
I'm the threat

Tell 'em I'm so free I got no chains homie
I'm so free I got no chains on me
Nappy hair, nappy hair, no shame, homie
I'm so free I got no chains on me
I'm so free I got no chains
Look at my neck
No chains, no shame, rapper

Yeah come get your opinion they don't matter
Money or the faith I chose the latter
Ohh, I can see them trying to keep us on the outside now
We pull up and watch them scatter yeah
Running through the woo (ay)
Heaven got a playlist
I promise that's my favorite placement (woo)
Faithful over famous
Yeah faithful over famous

New rappers that's sure to blow are really drug addicts with a studio
You gotta pop pills on the usual then that paradise ain't really coolio
If your world is really that flames then why you always high, tryna to escape?
'Gram flexin' that's too fake and them money phones really money loans
And that real life is you coming home, empty house and a heart of stone
Bad chick super savage but for a bigger bag she moving on
Oh yeah you making moves but these folks don't really love you
Industry only love dudes that they can use, don't be confused
Interviews that don't tip toe
Go and check my info
His glory that's simple
Riding around with that tempo
That's liberal that's conservative, that's charismatic and reformed too
My wife happy and Jesus love me ain't nothing left to conform to
Haha (no chains on me, I got no chains on me)

I was running with the set
Running with the set
We don't ever flex we just rep
Hear me, what did you expect?
I don't need respect
I'm the threat

Tell 'em I'm so free I got no chains on me
I'm so free I got no chains homie
Nappy hair, nappy hair, no shame, homie
I'm so free I got no chains on me
