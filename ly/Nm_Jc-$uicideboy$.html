		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Cock that Glock, then I pop, pop, pop
All the bodies drop in my drop-top
Holler "fuck cops!" 'Cause I won't ever stop
Hit the Benz, and I pop that lock
Screaming "motherfuck the law" while I
Ride around the block
Bitch, I'm so fucking sick with
The shit that I spit watch 'em all get hit
'till I fuckin' get rich
Motherfuckers know what it is
$uicide, give a fuck about life, bitch
I'm ready to die
$crim ain't shy, $crim just high
Fuck all y'all bustas, ain't shit in my eyes
Brain on fried, Columbine mind
To kill all you fuckers
And piss on your mothers
Call it what you want
And call it how you see
One thing I know y'all ain't fuckin' with me
One thing I know y'all ain't fuckin' with me
Bitch

If it was up to me, I would fuck it up
Fuck everything and bust a nut
Yung Mutt never smiles, got to cut me one
On my flip phone, dialin' 911
I need a pick me up, so come and pick me up
So I can pick me up about
Sixty bucks worth of sticky nugs
Just a quick re-up, then I'm up, up, and away
Bitch, I'm grey, take me to my fucking grave
Bitch, I'm broke like the bone in your back
Get the fuck up off my wave
Let me drown in peace, bitch
Bring a gun to the beach, bitch
Blow my brains away
Grey matter scattered in the sand
Surfing blood-soaked waves

I been smokin', I been drinkin'
I been smokin', I been drinkin'
I been smokin', I been drinkin'
I been smokin', I been drinkin'
I been smokin', I been drinkin'
I been smokin', I been drinkin'
I been smokin', I been drinkin'
I been drinking
