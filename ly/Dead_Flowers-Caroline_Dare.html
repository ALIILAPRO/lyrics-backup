		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got a few red flowers
That you left on my coffee table
I forgot to give them water so
Now they're dead and I'm unstable
Think it's funny how
I never figured out
That all you needed
Was more of me
So the only thing i have now is
Dead flowers
And you not by my side
Cause I let it die
Let it die
Let it die
All these dead flowers
I can't bring back to life
Cause I let 'em die
Let 'em die
No I'm not fine
No I'm not fine
I didn't mean to keep you
Waiting when you didn't need to
Or treat you like you're see through
And now I know that I was wrong
All my mistakes
Turn into petals that fall on your grave
Your heart, it breaks
Now I'm going crazy
I killed all these daisies
I'm thinking of you and how you made me hate these
Dead flowers
And you not by my side
Cause I let it die
Let it die
Let it die
All these dead flowers
I can't bring back to life
Cause I let 'em die
Let 'em die
No I'm not fine
No I'm not fine
I think it's funny how
I finally figured out
The only way I'm getting over you
Is if I finally throw out these
Dead flowers
So you're not on my mind
I should let it die
Let it die
Let it die
Throw out these dead flowers
To bring me back to life
I'll let 'em die
Let 'em die
I'll be alright
I'll be alright
I'll be alright
I'll be alright
I'll be alright
