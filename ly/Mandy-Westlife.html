		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I remember all my life
Raining down as cold as ice
Shadows of a man
A face through a window
Crying in the night
The night goes into

Morning, just another day
Happy people pass my way
Looking in their eyes
I see a memory
I never realized
How happy you made me, oh Mandy

Well, you came and you gave without taking
But I sent you away, oh Mandy
Well, you kissed me and stopped me from shaking
And I need you today, oh Mandy

I'm standing on the edge of time
I walked away when love was mine
Caught up in a world of uphill climbing
The tears are on my mind
And nothing is rhyming, oh Mandy

Well, you came and you gave without taking
But I sent you away, oh Mandy
And you kissed me and stopped me from shaking
And I need you today, oh Mandy

Yesterday's a dream
I face the morning
Crying on the breeze
The pain is calling, oh Mandy

Well, you came and you gave without taking
But I sent you away, oh Mandy
Well, you kissed me and stopped me from shaking
And I need you today, oh Mandy

Well, you came and you gave without taking
But I sent you away, oh Mandy
Well, you kissed me, you stopped me from shaking
And I need you

Oh Mandy, won't you listen to what I got to say?
Oh Mandy, don't you let me throw it all away
Oh Mandy, won't you listen to what I got to say?
And I need you today, oh Mandy
