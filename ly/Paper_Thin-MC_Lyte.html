		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When you say you love me, it doesn't matter
It goes to my head as just chit chatter
You may take this egostistical or just or worry free but
What you say I take none of it seriously, and
Even if I did I wouldn't tell you so
I'd let you pretend to read me and then you'll know
'Cause I hate when one attempts to analyze 
The fact that I despize those who even try
To look into my eyes to see what I am thinking
That dream is over you gotta sink it
And I tell all of you like I told all of them
What you say to me is just paper thin, word

I'm not the kind of girl to try to play a man out
I take the money and the gear and then break the hell out
No that's not my strategy, not the game I play
I admit I play game but it's not done that way
Truly when I get involved I give it my heart
I mean my mind, my soul, my body I mean every part
But if it doesn't work out, yo it just doesn't
It wasn't meant to be you know, it just wasn't
So I treat all of you like I treat all of them
And what you say to me is still paper thin

In one ear and right out the other
hurt is mumbo jumbo lover
I don't pay attention I don't concentrate
You ain't got the bait that it takes to hook this
Sucker you missed, I put feelings aside I know who I am
My name is Lyte is your name Sam?
'Cause if it is step off, grab your coat and get lost
Wrap your scarf around your throat and go back and catch a rope and hit the road Sam
Don't you come back no more, no more, no more, no more
Hit the road Sam, don't you come back no more

So now I take precaution when choosing my mate
I do not touch until the third or fourth date
Then maybe we'll kiss on the fifth or sixth
Time to be me 
'Cause a date without a kiss is so incomplete
And then maybe I'll let you play with my feet
You could suck the big toe and play with the middle
It's so simple unlike a riddle
It's as easy as counting to 1-2-3
In other terms, letters L-why-T-E
I'll tell you, you, you and all of you
In the back and in the middle in the front, yo
That's it paper thin word up
Lyte checkin' out
Special dedication to my DJ K-Rock in the place to be
