		  J Smash
Keep Smashing

All my goons gon show up
Hope you got that roller
Bottles on the pour up
We about to go off
Don't act like you don't know us
Codeine in my soda
Wilding till it's over
Uber man my chauffeur

All my goons gon show up
Hope you got that roller
Bottles on the pour up
We about to go off
Don't act like you don't know us
Codeine in my soda
Wilding till it's over
Uber man my chauffeur
Wilding till it's over

Too many drugs in my system
Too many girls who wanna kick it
Faces change when we in the building
But trust me out here ain't no fucks given
Too many niggas in their feelings
Cause we out here with their main bitches
Faces change when we in the building
But trust me out here ain't no fucks given
We don't no we don't
No fucks given boy zero
We smoke in the cribo
Puffing on the needles
We don't no we don't
No fucks given boy zero
We smoke in the cribo
Puffing on the endos
I'm getting lit right now
I'm with your bitch right now
Boy I'm the king right now
How do you feel right now
Boy I'm the shit right now
Boy I'm the shit right now
That's how it's right now
How do you feel right now

All my goons gon show up
Hope you got that roller
Bottles on the pour up
We about to go off
Don't act like you don't know us
Codeine in my soda
Wilding till it's over
Uber man my chauffeur

All my goons gon show up
Hope you got that roller
Bottles on the pour up
We about to go off
Don't act like you don't know us
Codeine in my soda
Wilding 'till it's over
Uber man my chauffeur
Wilding till it's over

I heard the party is private
But I got my goons right behind me
Just so you know we ain't looking for problems
But that's only if you don't start
Bring out the bottles I'm willing to spend
Your bitch ain't thicker than my wallet
I got the condoms if you wanna hit
My nigga make sure you got options
Stripper like flow when I rap
Ashin all over my Vans
Two 20 grams in my pants
Pre rolls inside of the bag oh yeah
It's litty inside of the mansion
Don't call my phone I won't answer
I'm with the squad and your hoe watching
She bout to lose all her manners
She bout to lose all her manners
Pick her ass up at the campus
She ready to go ready to go
She know the deal and what's happening
She bout to lose all her manners
Pick her ass up at the campus
She got a man I understand
I got the cash it's happening
Tell these niggas I ain't playing no game
I ain't messing with these bitches no names
Pull up at the party with your hoe yeah
Pull up at the party with some more drugs

All my goons gon show up
Hope you got that roller
Bottles on the pour up
We about to go off
Don't act like you don't know us
Codeine in my soda
Wilding till it's over
Uber man my chauffeur

All my goons gon show up
Hope you got that roller
Bottles on the pour up
We about to go off
Don't act like you don't know us
Codeine in my soda
Wilding till it's over
Uber man my chauffeur
Wilding till it's over
