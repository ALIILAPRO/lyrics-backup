		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bought a new suit for the action
Couple threads loose, see the traction
Stepping on shoes like it's packed in
Threw a ace deuce on my last men
Get a little boost every time
I feel the passion
Now I'm getting loose ain't no
Telling where I'm crashing
I was getting loot for the rap
About to cash in
Now we in the room, can tell who the act is

Who do I trust
Looking at me, do you looking at us?
Might not be good but I'm good in a clutch
I got some peeps who be doing too much
I got some peeps want to see me get crushed
I did some things when
Thе movement was hushed
See thе proof in my cup
See the proof in my blood
I did some things when the moment was up
We gon' run it back up
We gon' show how it's done
Number 1 thing when I came in
Everybody want the dub but you can't win
See I'm running to the ground
What your lane is?
If you're gunning for the crowning better
Go put your claim in tell no lies
I done came up but I failed more times
They be trying to sell with
The same old lines
I'ma speak mine, better tell you same

Came out the well, rang on the bell
Live what I talk i don't do what you say
You ain't been where I fell
Let the people talk, they don't know enough
Let my people spark, they don't own enough
I be speaking dark, see me blowing up
I just live what I tell
Cause I came out the well, rang on the bell
Pray for my all i got weight on my heart
I got weight on the scale
Let the people talk, they don't know enough
Let my people spark, they don't own enough
I be speaking dark, see me blowing up
I just live what I tell

Do a few shots, trying to throw me
Rap game fake, could have told me
Said I may as well join the army
Either way they trying to own me
Who do I trust
Looking at me, do you looking at us?
Might not be good but I'm good in a clutch
I got some peeps who be doing too much
I got some peeps want to see me get crushed
I did some feats when the movement was hushed
See the proof in my cup
See the proof in my blood
I did some things when the moment was up
We gon' run it back up
We gon' show how it's done

Came out the well, rang on the bell
Live what I talk i don't do what you say
You ain't been where I fell
Let the people talk, they don't know enough
Let my people spark, they don't own enough
I be speaking dark, see me blowing up
I just live what I tell
Cause I came out the -

Came out the water, my weight and my honor

Came out the well, rang on the bell
Live what I talk i don't do what you say
You ain't been where I fell
Let the people talk, they don't know enough
Let my people spark, they don't own enough
I be speaking dark, see me blowing up
I just live what I tell
Cause I came out the well, rang on the bell
Pray for my all i got weight on my heart
I got weight on the scale
Let the people talk, they don't know enough
Let my people spark, they don't own enough
I be speaking dark, see me blowing up
I just live what I tell
