		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Not all but most days
There's an ache for a place out of sight
Not now, but someday
I'll live life less removed
I'll make time

Few sit by the flowers
And I stay out of view
Some bed weeds between us
But I stay stuck on you

You want to see me from the other side
I know it's right
Holding a flame to the sunlight
I know it's bright

Not all but most days
There's an ache for a place out of mind
Not now, but someday
I'll live life less removed
I'll make time

You want to see me from the other side
I know it's right
Holding a flame to the sunlight
I know it's bright

Of all the places I've gone searching
Of all the places I go running
There you go

Not all but someday
I'll live life less removed
I'll make time

You want to see me from the other side
I know it's right
Holding a flame to the sunlight
I know it's bright
