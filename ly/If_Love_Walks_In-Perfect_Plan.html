		  IF LOVE WALKS IN
(Lyrics & Melodies: Kent Hilli, Music: Kent Hilli, Rolf Nordström, Leif Ehlin, Mats Byström, Fredrik Forsberg)

i know you, girl
Huh
Yea yea yeah

Did you hear the days of thunder
Or the fall of poison rain
Or did you crawl and run for cover
It's like you never been just quite the same
Did you ever stop to wonder
about the plans we made for the other day
Or did u think that it's all over
And it's time for you to be on your way

Was All those nights we had just wasted
(All those nights)
Could those days we had be lost and gone

If love walks in
Would you know that i'll be right here waiting
To love you again..yeah yeah
If love walks in
You should know that i'll be right here fighting
For love again
If love walks in
I will love you again.
I will love you again

Did the roll of a dice and hunger
Decide your dreams in vain
Or did you choose a name and number
It's like you've always been so hard to blame
Did you ever stop to wonder 
About the plans u schemed for another day
Or did you think that i'll recover
And that you bide some time to be on your way

PRE-CHORUS

CHORUS

SOLO

BRIDGE
I can tell by the look in your eyes you're no longer there
You don't seem to care at all  about our life, baby
I can tell by the way of your smile it's just a love affair
You don't seem to care at all it's in your eyes, yea yea yea yeah

PRE-CHORUS

CHORUS


.if love walks in, i will love u again
.if love walks in, i will love u again
If love walks in
If love walks in 
I will love you again
I will love you again
