		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Step forward and meet a new sunrise
A coward is shivering inside
Today I'll be a friend of mine
Who swallows suffering with smile
I drew a different reality
With unconditional loyalty
Ego hardly can be piqued
'Cause I'm selfless

Scale armour blaze
Virgin innocence
One being brings life
Another runs for death
Scale armour blaze
Virgin innocence
One being brings life
Another runs for death

No promises I ever give
Don't rely on me and I won't deceive
The beginning or the end you can't tell
When I wave my fin and shake my tail
I grew in different normality
With unblamable morality
Hooks and nets are there for me
But I'm skittish

Scale armour blaze
Virgin innocence
One being brings life
Another runs for death
Scale armour blaze
Virgin innocence
One being brings life
Another runs for death

A Neptune's child shivering inside
Drowns in the liquid gold
Cherished his life to the underworld
Meet me flashing when winter cries

Pisces swimming through the river
All their life against the stream
Searching for a hook to catch on and see their sun beam
Then suffocate in painful tortures
On cutting tables of callous men
Under a knife of handsome butchers
Emeralds are ripped away
Emeralds are ripped away
Emeralds are ripped away
Emeralds are ripped away
