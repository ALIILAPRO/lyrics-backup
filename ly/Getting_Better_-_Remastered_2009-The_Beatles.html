		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  It's getting better all the time

I used to get mad at my school (no, I can't complain)
The teachers who taught me weren't cool (no, I can't complain)
You're holding me down (ah-ah)
Turning me 'round (oh-oh)
Filling me up with your rules (fool, you fool)

I've got to admit it's getting better (better)
A little better all the time (it can't get no worse)
I have to admit it's getting better (better)
It's getting better
Since you've been mine

Me used to be angry young man
Me hiding me head in the sand
You gave me the word, I finally heard
I'm doing the best that I can

I've got to admit it's getting better (better)
A little better all the time (it can't get no worse)
I have to admit it's getting better (better)
It's getting better
Since you've been mine

Getting so much better all the time

It's getting better all the time
Better, better, better
It's getting better all the time
Better, better, better

I used to be cruel to my woman
I beat her and kept her apart from the things that she loved
Man, I was mean but I'm changing my scene
And I'm doing the best that I can (fool, you fool)

I admit it's getting better (better)
A little better all the time (it can't get no worse)
Yes, I admit it's getting better (better)
It's getting better
Since you've been mine

Getting so much better all the time

It's getting better all the time
Better, better, better
It's getting better all the time
Better, better, better

Getting so much better all the time
