		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Coach said to fake right and break left
Watch out for the pick and keep an eye on defense
Gotta run the give and go and take the ball to the hole
But don't be afraid to shoot the outside "J"

Just keep ya head in the game
Just keep ya head in the game

And don't be afraid to shoot the outside "J"
Just keep ya head in the game

You gotta, get'cha
Get'cha head in the game
We gotta get our, get our, get our
Get our head in the game

You gotta, get'cha
Get'cha head in the game
We gotta get our, get our, get our
Get our head in the game

Come on, get'cha
Get'cha head in the game
We gotta get our, get our, get our
Get our head in the game

You gotta, get'cha
Get'cha head in the game
We gotta get our, get our, get our
Get our head in the game
Whoa!

Let's make sure that we get the rebound
'Cause when we get it then the crowd will go wild
A second chance, gotta grab it and go
Maybe this time we'll hit the right notes

Wait a minute, it's not the time or place
Wait a minute, get my head in the game
Wait a minute, get my head in the game
Wait a minute, wait a minute

I gotta get my
Get my head in the game
You gotta get'cha, get'cha, get'cha
Get'cha head in the game

I gotta get my
Get my head in the game
You gotta get'cha, get'cha, get'cha
Get'cha head in the game

Come on, get my
Get my head in the game
You gotta get'cha, get'cha, get'cha
Get'cha head in the game

I gotta get my
Get my head in the game
You gotta get'cha, get'cha, get'cha
Get'cha head in the game
Whoa!

Why am I feeling so wrong?
My head's in the game
But my heart's in the song
She makes this feel so right

Should I go for it?
Better shake this, yikes!

I gotta get my
Get my head in the game
You gotta get'cha, get'cha, get'cha
Get'cha head in the game

I gotta get my
Get my head in the game
You gotta get'cha, get'cha, get'cha
Get'cha head in the game

Come on, get my
Get my head in the game
You gotta get'cha, get'cha, get'cha
Get'cha head in the game

I gotta get my
Get my head in the game
You gotta get'cha, get'cha, get'cha
Get'cha head in the game
Whoa!
