		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let's go
There's only one way in, there's only one way out
Where the black top ends, five miles south
Cross the tracks and don't turn back (let's go)
In your tight black jeans, you been misbehavin'
And livin' up to that reputation, girl
Hard to read, hard to please (just like me)
Smoke signals in your eyes
Whiskey drowns the butterflies
Drinks lined up on the tailgate
Feel that shot like a 12-gauge
It started with a flicker
Feel the heat of the liquor
When the stars come out
Break away from the crowd
Chasin' smoke signals
Smoke signals
I had a plan but your hands tell me I don't need it
Got me heavy breathin', girl
You put on a show
Show me what you know
Smoke signals in your eyes
Whiskey drowns the butterflies
Drinks lined up on the tailgate
Feel that shot like a 12-gauge
It started with a flicker
Feel the heat of the liquor
When the stars come out
Break away from the crowd
Chasin' smoke signals
Yeah
We both know when you get that close
No telling where this wildfire goes
We both know when you get this close
Watch this night go up in
Smoke signals in your eyes
Whiskey drowns the butterflies
You and me on the tailgate
Feel that shot like a 12-gauge
Started with a flicker
Feel the heat of the liquor
When the stars come out
Break away from the crowd
Chasin' smoke signals
No tellin' where this wildfire goes
But girl I gotta know
No tellin' where this wildfire goes
Yeah
Started with a flicker
Feel the heat of the liquor
When the stars come out
Break away from the crowd
