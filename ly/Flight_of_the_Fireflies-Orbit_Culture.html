		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In destruction
The flight of fireflies
The birth of lost control, a cry in the night
Inside the dungeon
Inside the waves of my head
I try to grasp it, chasing what's in myself

Now it happens and now I'm myself

It's coming down to the last second

The bridge is not safe

Safe

But it helps me to escape

Escape

And even my demon

Know things and join me

And who are you to me?

Me

Life you took away

Away

And still the temptation

Know things and join me

By seduction
The toxic death arrives
The search for fireflies 
Through mists in the night
Inside the temple
Inside the shimmering light
I try to follow 
The lights in the sky

To break the suffering
Its tainted, life it steals
In prison, in life's cell
You'll learn the way of the thorn

In trial for living
It keeps us all
In the cloud

It's coming down to the last second

The bridge is not safe

Safe

But it helps me to escape

Escape

And even my demon

Know things and join me

And who are you to me?

Me

Life you took away

Away

And still the temptation

Am I alive?
The taste of salt
Is this what you are, anger?
It pours down on me like hailstorms

I'll see you again

The fallen, the fallen man

When we are alone

You can't disappear

The fallen, the fallen man

Since you live inside of me

Inside of me

In destruction
The flight of fireflies
The birth of lost control, a cry in the night
Inside the dungeon
Inside the waves of my head
I try to grasp it, chasing what's in myself

I don't belong here
The doors are shut
And I see hell
