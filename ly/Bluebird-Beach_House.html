		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Love, it comes up on the ceiling
My mouth and these arms
Hold the feeling
Even I can't control my nature

If they should come up much
Before you
I would not ever try
To capture you

Bluebird
Where you gonna go now?

Lead me to the gallows
Where out 
Corner my eye
There's something
That's pulling me back
From nothing
From nothing

If they should come up much
Before you
I would not ever try
To capture you

Bluebird (I would not ever try)
Where you gonna go now?

Scenes change (I would not ever try)
Before they are over
Before they are over
