		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
I look at the floor and I see it needs sweeping
But still my guitar gently weeps

I don't know why nobody told you how to unfold your love
And I don't know how someone controlled you
They bought and sold you

And I look at the world and I notice it's turning
While my guitar gently weeps
From every mistake we must surely be learning
Yes, but still my guitar gently weeps (hey-hey)

I don't know why you were diverted
You were perverted too
And I don't know how you were inverted
No one alerted you (hey, don't know you know)

When I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
And when I look at you all
Yes, but still my guitar gently weeps (oh, no-no)

Yeah, the guitar gently weeps
Oh, it weeps, oh, it weeps, oh

And it's weeping, oh (oh-oh)

Keep on, keep on

Yeah
