		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Silent lover, secret lover, run for cover
When my man´s in town

You never been a shy one
You really are a sly one yes sire, yes sire, oh
Coming right out of hiding
Slipping right in and sliding, down to me, oh baby oh
And when it´s time for worryin´
You´re doing what you´re doing, gracefully, oh baby
When you took me into your arms and shook me
To the core, oh yeah...

Silent lover, secret lover, run for cover
When my man´s in town
Silent lover, secret lover, run for cover
When my man´s in town

Oh I guess you really change me
You sort of rearrange me more and more, oh baby yeah...
Each day you come on stronger
I know you really longer
What´s the score, what´s the score, alright
And I know you´re much too clever,
Just to go run forever
No, not you, oh baby
You´re like a wind wing rover
Just like a wind wing rover, passing through, oh yeah...
And one day you´ll say
No use to keep on saying, name the truth, oh baby

Silent lover, secret lover, run for cover
When my man´s in town
Silent lover, secret lover, run for cover
When my man´s in town

You never been a shy one
You really are a sly one yes sire, oh baby
Coming right out of hiding
Slipping right in and sliding, down to me, oh yeah...
Oh...and when it´s time for worryin´
You´re doing what you´re doing, gracefully, gracefully
Oh you took me into your arms and shook me
To the score, to a score
Oh I guess you really change me
You sort of rearrange me more and more, oh...yeah...

Silent lover, secret lover, run for cover
When my man´s in town
