		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Girl, well I've been thinking 'bout you every day and night
I've been missing you and I wanna hold you tight
You know, all my songs are all about you
And the things that we do

Oh, be my ride or die, baby
I'll never let you go
Oh, girl it's you, and me against the world

Oh, baby take my hand
We'll walk toward the sand
I wanna go with you
And only you my boo
I wanna be your man
The future we will plan
The things I wanna do
Like watch the sunset with you, oh no

Hey boy
Wanna stick around with you all night long (all night long)
Until we get tired and finish all the songs
I liked it when you danced with me
Every single step I feel so alive and thrilled

Oh, be my ride or die, baby
I'll never let you go
Oh, boy it's you, and me against the world

Oh, baby take my hand
We'll walk towards the sand
I wanna go with you
And only you my boo
I wanna be your girl
And you become my world
The things I wanna do
Like watch the sunset with you, no

Oh, baby take my hand
We'll walk toward the sand
I wanna go with you
And only you my boo
I wanna be your man
The future we will plan
The things I wanna do
Like watch the sunset with you, oh no

Boy, I wanna spend the rest of my whole life with you
Oh, girl I wanna take this chance so I can be your man
Girl, I just wanna sing with you
