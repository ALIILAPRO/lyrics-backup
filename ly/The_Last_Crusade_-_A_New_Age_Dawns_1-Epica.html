		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Magna culpa nostra
Poena danda nobis erit
Usque ad finem dierum ad finem temporum

Magna culpa nostra
Poena danda nobis erit
Usque ad finem dierum ad finem temporum

You can't force yourself upon me
And you never will
You can't keep digging in
Desecrated graves

No more innocence left to kill
Don't be afraid, participate and
Just give us all your trust
Your soul will be saved
Just honour me, I'll set you free so
Get ready to join the very last crusade

Ad finem temporum

You can't get away with your crimes
And you never will
For you'll have to pay the price
And this time is near

No more innocent left to spill
Don't be afraid, participate and
Just give us all your trust
Your soul will be saved
Just honour me, I'll set you free so
Get ready to join the very last crusade

Magna culpa nostra
Poena danda nobis
Usque ad finem erit dierum

Ad finem temporum

Don't be afraid, participate and
Just give us all your trust
Your soul will be saved
Just follow me, I'll set you free so
Get ready to join the very last crusade

Don't be afraid, participate and
Just give us all your trust
Your soul will be saved
Just follow me, I'll set you free so
Get ready to join the very last crusade
Get ready to chase the final victory

Ad finem temporum
