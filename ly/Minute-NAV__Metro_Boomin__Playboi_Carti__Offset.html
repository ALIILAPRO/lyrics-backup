		  Yo
Yo, Pierre, you wanna come out here?
If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you

I'm balling, so I put some diamonds on my fists
Punch you in your mouth, leave diamonds on your lip
Selling rerock, we passin' the block, slide in your block
Depressing my ops

Counting all this money, getting used to having it
My wallet costs more than what I used to have in it
Ayo, Pierre, do you wanna come in here?
I got lots of girls and I got lots of drugs in here
In my studio, it feels like it's a club in here
Bitches fucking 'bout a double, ain't no dub in here
Diamonds shining, I feel like I got the sun in here
Shooters 'round me, who you think you're signing here?
I take a Fanta and I put some mud in there
You say, you've got a party, I might pop up there
You a cub, your main bitch fuck me like I'm papa bear
You the type to wild out when the cops are there
I found a trap, my pans and all my pots are there
I'm going fast, who you think you're stopping here?

I'm balling, so I put some diamonds on my fist
Punch you in your mouth, leave diamonds on your lip
Selling rerock, we passin' the block, slide in your block
Depressing my ops

Just give me a minute
Just give me a minute
I'mma hit it and quit it
You need some drink, pint gon' pull up in a minute
Just give me a minute
Just give me a minute
Dressed up in designer, give me a minute
Just give me a minute
Just give me a minute
Get a hundred dollar line-up, give me a minute
Just give me a minute
Just give me a minute

Offset!
Give me a minute
The coupe is tinted
Knife ended
It's time to go get it
I used to be trappin' pigeons, now I push start and crank the engine
Wrist on frigid, glisten, listen, hundred round drum with biscuit 
La di da di put her on molly, fuck her on top of the 'Rari
Python Audi, sitting on Forgi's, right baby Follies
I thank the plug kept me alive
My uncle cooking up dope in front my eyes
'Fore you open the door, go get the fire
She on the Perc, now it's a vibe
I get the bag, it's automatic
She on the Addy'
I got some cash inside the mattress, I got more in the attic
I'm high fashion like I imagined
Look at my status
Look at the mathematics
Look at the baddest
All made of plastic
I bet this money gon' last me
I stay in my lane, don't crash it
Wake up lil nigga, you lackin' (wake up)
Droppin' the phone, I pass it

I'm balling, so I put some diamonds on my fist
Punch you in your mouth, leave diamonds on your lip
Selling rerock, we passin' the block, slide in your block
Depressing my ops

Just give me a minute
Just give me a minute
I'mma hit it and quit it
You need some drink, pint gon' pull up in a minute
Just give me a minute
Just give me a minute
Dressed up in designer, give me a minute
Just give me a minute
Just give me a minute
Get a hundred dollar line-up, give me a minute
Just give me a minute
Just give me a minute

Got your navi on the phone, he asking for some work
Got some bitches in my home, they cookin' on the pot
Know some niggas in the A, still trappin' at the spot
And we robbing all you niggas, we taking off your top
I'mma 4 up with the slime, we pull up with them mops
And when I'm talking, 'bout the mob, that's Harlem to the Bronx
I use to run run with that Glock
But now I'm way too hot
Got some niggas who time for Carti, 'cause they got they guap
Got some paparazzi looking at me, waiting on the flock
Fuck these little niggas hating snitching like some cop

I'm balling, so I put some diamonds on my fist
Punch you in your mouth, leave diamonds on your lip
Selling rerock, we passin' the block, slide in your block
Depressing my ops

Just give me a minute
Just give me a minute
I'mma hit it and quit it
You need some drink, pint gon' pull up in a minute
Just give me a minute
Just give me a minute
Dressed up in designer, give me a minute
Just give me a minute
Just give me a minute
Get a hundred dollar line-up, give me a minute
Just give me a minute
Just give me a minute

Metro Boomin' want some more nigga
Yo, Pierre, you wanna come out here?
