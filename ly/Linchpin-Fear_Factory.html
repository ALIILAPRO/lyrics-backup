		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can't take me apart...
Can't take me apart...

See the light a new day has arrived for us
Genesis of our evolution
A linchpin holds within a means to and end 
Can't you see that we are one?

[Repeat: x3]
Can't take me apart

No you can't

We see no end to the dream

[Chorus]
We will never see the end
We will never be the ned
All of my life I felt discarded
Never feeling a part of it

No you can't

Without me you will fade, you will not remain
We are one and though the same future machine
A linchpin holds within a mean to an end
Can't you see that we are one?

[Repeat: x3]
Can't take me apart 

No you can't

We see no end to the dream

[Chorus]

No you...
No you can't take... [Repeat: x5]

No you can't take me apart

[Chorus]

We will never see the end
We will never be the end
All my life I felt discarded
Never feeling a part of it

[Repeat: x5]
You can't change me 

You can't change me now
