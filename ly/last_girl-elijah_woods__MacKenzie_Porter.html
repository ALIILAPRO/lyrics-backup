		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  St Lawrence river, a quarter to five
You ask if I'm swimming and I didn't think twice
My head going under, I come up for air
And you're just sitting there

There must be something in the water
'Cause I've never seen it this clear

It's you and me in the August heat
The bright orange everglow
The southern sky
When it hits your eyes there ain't nowhere I wanna go
This moment is perfect
Sunburnt, shirtless
Then everything starts to move slow
Then suddenly
It just hit me
You're the last girl I'm bringing home

Your denim jacket
You said I could have it
But I should know better
Than saying words like forever
The suns falling
And so am I, boy, I'm all in

I swear there must be something in the water
'Cause I've never seen it this clear

It's you and me in the August heat
The bright orange everglow
The southern sky
When it hits your eyes there ain't nowhere I wanna go
This moment is perfect
Sunburnt, shirtless
Then everything starts to move slow
Then suddenly
It just hit me
I'm the last girl you're bringing home

The last girl you're bringing home
The last girl you're bringing home

This moment is perfect
Sunburnt, shirtless
Then everything starts to move slow
Then suddenly
It just hit me
You're the last girl I'm bringing home
