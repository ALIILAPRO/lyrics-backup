		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't eat
I don't sleep
I do nothing but think of you
I don't eat
I don't sleep
I do nothing but think of you

You keep me under your spell
You keep me under your spell
You keep me under your spell
You keep me under your spell
You keep me under your spell
You keep me under your spell

Hey
Yeah?
I was wondering
Do you know the difference between love and obsession?
No
And what's the difference between obsession and desire?
I don't know
Do you think this feeling will last forever?
You mean like forever ever? 
Forever ever? 
Forever ever? 
Forever ever?
Sure
God, I hope so
Me too

I don't eat
I don't sleep
I do nothing but think of you
I don't eat
I don't sleep
I do nothing but think of you

You keep me under your spell
You keep me under your spell
You keep me under your spell
You keep me under your spell
You keep me under your spell
You keep me under your spell

La, la, la, la, la (ooh)
La, la, la, la, la (ooh)
La, la, la, la, la, la (ooh)

La, la, la, la, la (ooh)
La, la, la, la, la (ooh)
La, la, la, la, la, la (ooh)

La, la, la, la, la (ooh)
La, la, la, la, la (ooh)
La, la, la, la, la, la (ooh)

La, la, la, la, la (ooh)
La, la, la, la, la (ooh)
La, la, la, la, la, la (ooh)

I don't eat
I don't sleep
I do nothing but think of you
I don't eat
I don't sleep
I do nothing but think of you
