		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I caught the moon today
Pick it up
And throw it away all right
I got the perfect steal
A cleaner love
With a dirty feel all right
Fallout and take the bait
Eat the fruit
And kiss the snake goodnight

Common ruse, dirty face
Pretty noose is pretty hate
And I don't like what you got me hanging from
And I don't like what you got me hanging from
And I don't like what you got me hanging from

Let your motor race
Pick it up
And get this mother gone
Out from and far away
The wooden stake
This thing has got me on

Diamond rope, silver chain
Pretty noose is pretty pain
And I don't like what you got me hanging from
And I don't like what you got me hanging from
And I don't like what you got me hanging from
And I don't like what you got me hanging from

Common ruse, dirty face
Pretty noose is pretty hate
And I don't care what you got
I don't care what you need
I don't want anything
And I don't like what you got me hanging from
And I don't like what you got me hanging from
And I don't like what you got me hanging from
And I don't like what you got me hanging from

And I don't like what you got me hanging from
And I don't like what you got me hanging from
Yeah
