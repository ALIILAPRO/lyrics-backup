		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Searching through my memories, I see
Us happily dancing underneath a tree
And I can't seem to let you go, I know
I seem to fall in love
With every glimpse I take of you
And I can't explain right now
What I'm going through
But if you stay for awhile
I promise I'll say the truth
Like how I got here
How I fell in love
How I fell apart
And how I got back up
How I'm fighting
How I'm barely enough
How I keep moving on
Even though I'm hurting in love
Hurting in love
Years gone by and I still don't know
How this ended, can you tell me slowly
Was it dream or fantasy?
Hand in hand I thought that we
Would end this year, but it was differently
Am I alive or am I asleep?
And I can't explain right now
What I'm going through
But if you stay for awhile
I promise I'll say the truth
Like how I got here
How I fell in love
How I fell apart
And how I got back up
How I'm fighting
How I'm barely enough
How I keep moving on
Even though I'm hurting in love
Hurting in love
I'm hurting baby
Hurting in love
I'm barely enough
Hurting in love
