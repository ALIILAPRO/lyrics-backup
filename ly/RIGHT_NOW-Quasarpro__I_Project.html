		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yes I'm living for The Lord right now
Next few months ill be on the road right now
I don't care about my life right now
Ill be losing my life for His sake and that's right now
Yes I'm living for The Lord right now
Next few months ill be on the road right now
I don't care about my life right now
Ill be losing my life for His sake and that's right now
I'll be tripping in my head feeling like I'm going down
Remember the nights I wanted pistol to my mouth
Remember all them nights I was so drugged out
Remember all them days â€‹I wasn't feeling like myself
Aye and wheres Thomas been?
Been up all night in His room again
Been sitting all alone with His only Friend
He's not moving on
He's been born again
When this dirt comes over my eyes
I know these bad thoughts are lies
I know that you made the sky
I know your my reason why
Yes I'm living for The Lord right now
Next few months ill be on the road right now
I don't care about my life right now
Ill be losing my life for His sake and that's right now
Yes I'm living for The Lord right now
Next few months ill be on the road right now
I don't care about my life right now
Ill be losing my life for His sake and that's right now
I'm just trying to find my way
Every second feels like a rainy day
Lord, I need the sun to shine my way
Now I can see the life he gave
You might feel lost but there is a way
Darkness clouding me now I'm in a cave
Lord give me faith
When I found faith in the one who gave me freedom
We follow Jesus to the people who need Him
All you have to do is call the name that's freedom
He found me when I was lost and searching
Now I found the Lord right now
Right now right now
Yes I'm living for The Lord right now
Next few months ill be on the road right now
I don't care about my life right now
Ill be losing my life for His sake and that's right now
Yes I'm living for The Lord right now
Next few months ill be on the road right now
I don't care about my life right now
Ill be losing my life for His sake and that's right now
