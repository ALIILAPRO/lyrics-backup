		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  That first night we were standin' at your door
Fumblin' for your keys, then I kissed you
Asked me if I wanna come inside
'Cause we didn't wanna end the night
Then you took my hand and I followed you

Yeah, I see us in black and white
Crystal clear on a starlit night
In all your gorgeous colors
I promise that I'll love you for the rest of my life
See you standin' in your dress
Swear in front of all our friends
There'll never be another
I promise that I'll love you for the rest of my life

Now, we're sittin' here in your livin' room
Tellin' stories while we share a drink or two
And there's a vision I've been holdin' in my mind
We're 65 and you ask
When did I first know, I always knew

Yeah, I see us in black and white
Crystal clear on a starlit night
In all your gorgeous colors
I promise that I'll love you for the rest of my life
See you standin' in your dress
Swear in front of all our friends
There'll never be another
I promise that I'll love you for the rest of my life

I want the world to witness
When we finally say, "I do"
It's the way you love
I gotta give it back to you
I can't promise picket fences
Or sunny afternoons
But, at night when I close my eyes

I see us in black and white
Crystal clear on a starlit night
There'll never be another
I promise that I'll love ya

I see us in black and white
Crystal clear on a starlit night
In all your gorgeous colors
I promise that I'll love you for the rest of my life
See you standin' in your dress
Swear in front of all our friends
There'll never be another
I promise that I'll love you for the rest of my life

And there'll never be another
I promise that I'll love you for the rest of my life
