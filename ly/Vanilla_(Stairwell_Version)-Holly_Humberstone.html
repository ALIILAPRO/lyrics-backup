		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now I don't wanna be your enemy
But truly I ain't got the energy
To wait for somebody you'll never be
It never works, it never will
I need a cure for all this apathy
I'm spending way too long on Web MD (not so sure it's good for me)
I guess I feel a little nauseous
Think I should be cautious because

We go in circles
Pick me up, let me down
Whatever works for you
We kept it lukewarm, oh, so vanilla
Ooh, that's just what we do

And I could go on and on and on and on and on
But the truth is I have my best nights without you
So tell me I'm wrong to think we're far from having fun, tell me I'm wrong
You should know, here goes
I have my best nights without you

I'll make it easy for the both of us
Now everything's become so meaningless
We're perfectly comfortable in the worst way (in the worst way)
From time to time a spark ignites between us
Whenever works for you
So dull and lifeless, oh, so vanilla
Ooh, that's just what we do

And I could go on and on and on and on and on
But the truth is I have my best nights without you
So tell me I'm wrong to think we're far from having fun, tell me I'm wrong
You should know, here goes
I have my best nights without you

We go steady, we just get by
We coast until we hit a red light
Truth is that I have my best nights without you
Give me the same jokes, you messed up the punch line
A few notes so you'll do better next time
Here goes, I have my best nights without you

And I could go on and on and on and on and on
But the truth is I have my best nights without you
So tell me I'm wrong to think we're far from having fun, tell me I'm wrong
You should know, here goes
I have my best nights without you

And I could go on (we go steady, we just get by, we coast until we hit a red light)
Tell me I'm wrong (truth is that I have my best nights without you)
And I could go on (same jokes, you messed up the punch line 
A few notes so you'll do better next time)
Here goes, I have my best nights without you
