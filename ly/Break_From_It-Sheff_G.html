		  (Great John on the beat, by the way)
Turn my voice up
All up in my feelings, got me movin' real desperate
Look

All up in my feelings, got me movin' real desperate
Got me movin' on some next shit
Shawty, why you playin'? You the one I'm tryna mess with
She think I'm focused on the next bitch
I can't get a break from the fuckery, huh
I can't get a break from it, huh, look
I can't get a break from the fuckery, huh
I can't get a break from it, huh, look

Hunnid K flat, had to put that on my necklace
Boy, I get you hit up if you front just with the backend
I'ma stitch some baddie, she be creamin' while I'm slappin'
We don't do no lackin,' but I don't use no strap in it
I can't go on dates, without my gun on waist, huh
Never show no face, that's how you beat your cases
She my lil' Snapple with the apple, baby girl, yeah, you so juicy
Seen 'em her on the 'net, I left some flicks, now it's a movie
A movie, huh, wanna seduce me
Pussy tight, got me addicted like a loosie, and, look
I know what she like, nigga, I know what she need
We might have some fights, baby, don't want you to leave (want you to leave)
Huh, look, got my heart up on my sleeve
Huh, crazy how those smiles could turn easily to beef

All up in my feelings, got me movin' real desperate
Got me movin' on some next shit
Shawty, why you playin'? You the one I'm tryna mess with
She think I'm focused on the next bitch
I can't get a break from the fuckery, huh
I can't get a break from it, huh, look
I can't get a break from the fuckery, huh
I can't get a break from it, huh
