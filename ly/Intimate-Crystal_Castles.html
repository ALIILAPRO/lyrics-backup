		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Collecting hearts
Another love is another place to stay
Another face
We close our eyes and feel our way
A new fit
You're Positive but they don't need to know
Another boy another girl another place to go

It feels like sleep
It feels like being born
Return to soil
Return to frailer form
