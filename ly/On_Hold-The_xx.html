		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't blame you
We got carried away
I can't hold on
To an empty space

Now you've found a new star to orbit
It could be love
I think you're too soon to call us old
When and where did we go cold?
I thought I had you on hold

And every time I let you leave
I always saw you coming back to me
When and where did we go cold?
I thought I had you on hold

Where does it stop, where does it stop
Where do you dare me to
You've got the body, you've got the body
Dare me to, dare me to
Where does it stop, where does it stop
Where do you dare me to
You've got the body, you've got the body

I thought I had you on hold

Where does it stop, where does it stop
Where do you dare me to
You've got the body, you've got the body
Dare me to, dare me to
Where does it stop, where does it stop
Where do you dare me to
You've got the body, you've got the body
Dare me to, dare me to

My young heart
Chance to believe
We were destined
Young hearts
All need love
Call it a lesson

The stars and the charts and the cards make sense
Only when we want them to
When I lie awake staring in to space
I see a different view

Now you've found a new star to orbit
It could be love
I think you're too soon to call us old
When and where did we go cold?
I thought I had you on hold

And every time I let you leave
I always saw you coming back to me
When and where did we go cold?
I thought I had you on hold
I thought I had you on hold
I thought I had you on hold

Where does it stop, where does it stop
Where do you dare me to
You've got the body, you've got the body
Where do you dare me to, dare me to
Where does it stop, where does it stop
Where do you dare me to
You've got the body, you've got the body
You've got the body, you've got the body
Where does it stop, where does it stop
Where do you dare me to
You've got the body, you've got the body
Where do you dare me to, dare me to
Where does it stop, where does it stop
Where do you dare me to
You've got the body, you've got the body
Dare me to, dare me to

And every time I let you leave
I always saw you coming back to me
When and where did we all go cold?
I thought I had you on hold
I thought I had you on hold
I thought I had you on hold
