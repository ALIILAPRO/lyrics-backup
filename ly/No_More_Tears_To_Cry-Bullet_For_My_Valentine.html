		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I think it's time to recognize these demons in my head
They're killing me internally, I know they want me dead
Let's take the time to analyze and get this off my chest
By digging up the skeletons to finally confess

Wait, am I losing it?
There's an itch under my skin
Is this pain another sin?
Wait, am I losing it?
Will this rope around my neck make it easy to forget?

I got no more tears to cry
Under the surface there's
No more strength to fight
There's nothing inside of me

So nothing seems to ease my mind, no matter what I try
An endless vicious circle on a loop that won't rewind
I'm outta luck, out of time, is this just all in vain?
I've had enough, I'm giving up, I'm feeling so afraid

Wait, am I losing it?
With no hope, there's nothing left
And you're not afraid of death
Wait, am I losing it?
When you can't rely on faith
Cut this cycle of self-hate

I got no more tears to cry
Under the surface there's
No more strength to fight
There's nothing inside
I've got no more tears to cry
Under the surface there's
No more strength to fight
There's nothing inside

I'm cut into pieces, pushed over the edge
Feeling so worthless, god, when will this end?
Every minute a battle, an hour a war
Feeling so helpless, god, when will it end?
Nobody's listening, does nobody care?

I got no more tears to cry
Under the surface there's
No more strength to fight
There's nothing inside
I've got no more tears to cry
Under the surface there's
No more strength to fight
There's nothing inside
There's nothing inside
