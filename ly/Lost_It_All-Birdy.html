		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Give a little time to me
Give a little trust and you'd see
Give a little peace of mind
You never know what you might find

Oh, if this is what dreams are made of
Then I think that I've seen enough
Oh, I've given you all of my love
But it's still not enough

You told me that you light my way
You're clever with the words you say, yeah
Let me out into the dark
I took a little step too far

Oh, if this is what dreams are made of
Then I think that I've seen enough
Oh, I've given you all of my love
But it's still not enough

Oh, it hurts (lost control)
Oh, it hurts (lost it all)
It hurts sometimes, sometimes

If this is what dreams are made of
Then I think that I've seen enough
Oh, I've given you all of my love
But it's still not enough

A bitter heart
You let me down
But you'll never lose
What you'll never found
