		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You hate I'm always such a mess 
My problems I cannot confess 
So tired 
Never what you required 
Bet I'm one of your regrets 
The sadness you will not address 
So wired 
Never felt less inspired 
Guess it's all down to me 
Impressive how you always keep 
So cold 
With all the lies you've told 
And at night I fight with all my feelings 
Cause nothing no more seems appealing Still trying 
But never felt less admired 
(Like you told yourself, I'm no good for your health) 
You hate I'm always such a mess 
My problems I cannot confess 
So tired 
Never what you required 
Bet I'm one of your regrets 
The sadness you will not address 
So wired 
Never felt less inspired 
I'll make my own way round 
No I won't make a sound 
No I won't tear you down 
You hate I'm always such a mess 
My problems I cannot confess 
So tired 
Never what you required 
Bet I'm one of your regrets 
The sadness you will not address
So wired 
Never felt less inspired
