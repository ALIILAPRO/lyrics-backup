		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She comes in colors everywhere
She combs her hair 
She's like a rainbow 
Coming, colors in the air 
Oh, everywhere 
She comes in colors 

She comes in colors everywhere
She combs her hair 
She's like a rainbow 
Coming, colors in the air 
Oh, everywhere 
She comes in colors 

Have you seen her dressed in blue? 
See the sky in front of you 
And her face is like a sail 
Speck of white so fair and pale 
Have you seen a lady fairer? 

She comes in colors everywhere
She combs her hair 
She's like a rainbow 
Coming, colors in the air 
Mmm, everywhere 
She comes in colors 

Have you seen her all in gold? 
Like a queen in days of old 
She shoots colors all around 
Like a sunset going down 
Have you seen a lady fairer? 

She comes in colors everywhere
She combs her hair 
She's like a rainbow 
Coming, colors in the air 
Oh, everywhere 
She comes in colors 

She's like a rainbow 
Coming, colors in the air 
Oh, everywhere 
She comes in colors
