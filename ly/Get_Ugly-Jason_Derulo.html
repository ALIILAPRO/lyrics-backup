		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Girl, ladies, let your hurr down
Let your hurr down
We's about to get down

Oh my, oh my, oh my god
This girl straight and this girl not
Tipsy off that peach Ciroc
Like la la la
Ching-a-lang-lang, ching-a-ling-a-lang-lang
Jeans so tight I could see loose change
Do your thang, thang, girl
Do that thang like la la la

Tell them pretty faced girls tryna grabs each other
And them undercover freaks who ain't nun' but trouble
Baby, I'mma tell you some' only 'cause I love ya
People all around the world sexy motherfuckers

Get ugly
Yeah, get ugly, baby
Get ugly
You're too sexy to me
Sexy to me
You're too sexy to me
Sexy to me
So sexy
Damn, that's ugly

Bruh, I can't, I can't even lie
I'm about to be that guy
Someone else gon' have to try me
La la la
Bang-a-rang-rang, bang-a-ring-a-rang-rang
Bass in the trunk, vibrate that thang
Do your thang, thang, girl
Do that thang like la la la

Tell them pretty faced girls tryna grabs each other
And them undercover freaks who ain't nun' but trouble
Baby, I'mma tell you some' only 'cause I love ya
People all around the world sexy motherfuckers

Get ugly
Get ugly, baby, woo hoo
And everybody say la la la
Get ugly
You're too sexy to me
Sexy to me
You're too sexy to me
Sexy to me
So sexy
Damn, that's ugly

Ay, Ricky
This beat give me that ugly face, man
Everybody lose control
Let's get ugly, dysfunctional
Everybody lose control
Let's get ugly, dysfunctional

Tell them pretty faced girls tryna grabs each other
And them undercover freaks who ain't nun' but trouble
Baby, I'mma tell you some' only 'cause I love ya
People all around the world sexy motherfuckers

Light them up then pass that, pass that
La la la
Everybody lose control
Let's get ugly, dysfunctional
Get ugly
You know what I'm talking about
You're too sexy to me
Sexy to me
You're too sexy to me
Sexy to me
So sexy
Damn, that's ugly
