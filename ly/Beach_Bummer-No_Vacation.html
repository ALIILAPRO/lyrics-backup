		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  (One, two, three, let's go)

Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

I could cry for days
When I hear your name
Things don't feel the same
I'm the only one inside today

Why, oh, why do I
Put up with this misery?
Still looking for a reason
But now, it is a mystery to me
Why, oh, why do I
Put up with this misery?
Still looking for a reason
But for now, it's ancient history to me

Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

Just slap me in the face
Been worn out as of late
My friends go to the beach
I'm too tired to sleep

Why, oh, why do I
Put up with this misery?
Still looking for a reason
But for now, it is a mystery to me
Why, oh, why do I
Put up with this misery?
Still looking for a reason
But for now, it's ancient history to me

Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah (now it's ancient history to me)
Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah (now it's ancient history to me)
