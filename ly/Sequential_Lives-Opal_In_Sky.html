		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I found it strange
How symmetries live between the lines
From way up in space down to the oceanic life
I found it strange How dreams
Lose concept of time
It's a separate world
Drifting into
Our minds
As I stand in the dirt there's a sensation on my skin
But I don't feel at all
I am one with the wind
As I stare at the sky
I see the lives where we become
Witnessed not by these eyes
But the one from above
As I stand so familiar
A place I've never been
A sense in the air
With a sense to begin
Picking up where I once left off
In a past Life
And I will
We're all apart of a cycle
We can't recall
But the lessons are
Never gone
Two souls have been bound by time
In a sequential form of love
Reaching multiple lives
Connected by the stars above
And just as a knight has honoured ancient ways
We're here on this earth
Sent to maintain
Trees give the air we breath
And In return we give it back
The light we see
The sun that forges our path
And just as the moon will surely shift the waves
We're here on this earth sent to maintain
I've witnessed the lost before
And I'll
Stand
To make sure we're all found
I found it strange
How symmetries live between the lines
From way up in space down to the oceanic life
I found it strange How dreams
Lose concept of time
It's a separate world
Drifting
Don't let a meaning
Define what becomes of us
They never said "set in stone" can't be broken
It's all sequentially laid out before us
But we control inside
And we can free our minds
Two souls have been bound by time
In a sequential form of love
Reaching multiple lives
Connected by the stars above
And just as a knight has honoured ancient ways
We're here on this earth
Sent to maintain
Trees give the air we breath
And In return we give it back
The light we see
The sun that forges our path
And just as the moon will surely shift the waves
We're here on this earth sent to maintain
All our souls are bound by time
It's a sequential form of love
Reaching all of our lives
And all these fucking stars above
Just as a god has planed out everything
We stand on this earth
We will maintain
