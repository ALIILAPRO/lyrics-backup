		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I just wanna let go
I solo
Speaking on my M.O.
What they don't know
Know you see the skin glow
Sweet like cocoa
Keep up with my tempo
While I let go

Way
Feel some way
When I'm in my bag, can't slow the pace
I know my place
It's a shame
How you hate
On everything and everyone
When you're the one to blame, ooh-ooh

Keep it on the low
'Cause I'm better on my own
So you could go sit your ass over there (yeah)
Caught up in my flow
Something that you'll never know
Don't need nobody to care

Feel good when you're living like me (ooh)
Can't fuck with a woman like me (oh-ooh)
Lemon slice in your sugar iced tea (oh, oh, oh-ooh)
Feels good when you're living carefree
(Carefree)
(Carefree, care)

I just wanna let go (let go)
I solo (solo)
Speaking on my M.O.
What they don't know (what they don't know)
Know you see the skin glow (they see my skin glow)
Sweet like cocoa (cocoa)
Keep up with my tempo
While I let go (while I let go)

Sweetest deceiver
Biting on the hand that feeds ya (oh-ooh)
I see your demeanor
Why you getting mad for no reason? (reason)
Money don't heal the pain (pain)
I know we ain't all the same (same)
See-through like cellophane (phane)
Carry on like
Carry on like
Carry on

Keep it on the low (oh-ooh)
'Cause I'm better on my own (oh-ooh)
So you could go sit your ass over there (you can sit your ass)
Caught up in my flow (flow)
Something that you'll never know (know)
Don't need nobody to care
Feel good when you're living like me, like me (ooh)
Can't fuck with a woman like me, like me (oh-ooh)
Lemon slice in your sugar iced tea, iced tea, iced tea (oh, oh, oh-ooh)
Feels good when you're living carefree
(Carefree)
(Carefree, care)

I just wanna let go (let go)
I solo (solo)
Speaking on my M.O.
What they don't know (what they don't know)
Know you see the skin glow (they see my skin glow)
Sweet like cocoa (cocoa)
Keep up with my tempo (keep up with my tempo)
While I let go (while I let go)

Whoa-oh (while I let)
Ooh oh-oh (while I let go)
Oh, oh, ooh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-ooh
Ooh-oh, oh, oh
Oh oh, oh oh
Ooh-ooh
Oh, oh
