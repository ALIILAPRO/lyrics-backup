		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Build a fire and gather 'round the tree
Fill a glass and maybe come and sing with me

So kiss me under the mistletoe
Pour out the wine, let's toast and pray for December snow
I know there's been pain this year, but it's time to let it go
Next year, you never know
But for now, Merry Christmas

We'll dance in the kitchen while embers glow
We've both known love, but this love we got is the best of all
I wish you could see it through my eyes then you would know
My God, you look beautiful right now
Merry Christmas

The fire is raging on
And we'll all sing along to the song
Just having so much fun
While we're here, can we all spare a thought
For the ones who have gone?
Merry Christmas, everyone

(Ah ah ah ah)
(Ah ah ah ah)

So just keep kissing me under the mistletoe
Pour out the wine, let's toast and pray for December snow
I know there's been pain this year, but it's time to let it go
Next year, you never know
But for now, Merry Christmas

We'll dance in the kitchen while embers glow
We've both known love, but this love we got is the best of all
I wish you could see it through my eyes then you would know
My God, you look beautiful right now
Merry Christmas

I feel it when it comes
Every year, helping us carry on
Filled up with so much love
All the family and friends all together
Where we all belong
Merry Christmas, everyone

(Ah ah ah ah)
(Ah ah ah ah)
(Ah ah ah ah)
(Ah ah ah ah)

It's Christmas time for you and I
We'll have a good night and a merry Christmas
It's Christmas time for you and I
We'll have a good night and a merry Christmas
It's Christmas time for you and I
We'll have a good night and a merry Christmas
It's Christmas time for you and I
We'll have a good night and a merry Christmas time
