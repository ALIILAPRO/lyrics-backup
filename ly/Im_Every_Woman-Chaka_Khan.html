		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm every woman
It's all in me
Anything you want done, baby
I'll do it naturally

I'm every woman
It's all in me
I can read your thoughts right now
Every one from A to Z 
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa

I can cast a spell
Of secrets you can't tell
Mix a special brew
Put fire inside of you
Anytime you feel danger or fear
Instantly
I will appear 'cause

I'm every woman
It's all in me
Anything you want done, baby
I'll do it naturally
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa

I can sense your needs
Like rain unto the seeds
I can make a rhyme
Of confusion in your mind
And when it comes down to some good old-fashioned love
That's what I've got baby, 'cause

I'm every woman
It's all in me
Anything you want done, baby
I'll do it naturally

I'm every woman
It's all in me
I can read your thoughts right now
Every one from A to Z 
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa

I ain't braggin' 'cause I am the one
You just ask me, ooh, it shall be done
And don't bother to compare
'Cause I've got it (I've got it)
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa (I've got it, yeah-yeah)
Whoa, whoa, whoa (ah)
Ah ah

I'm every woman
I'm every woman
I'm every woman
I'm every woman (oh)
I'm every woman (whoa, whoa, whoa)
I'm every woman (whoa, whoa, whoa)
I'm every woman (whoa, whoa, whoa)
I'm every woman (whoa, whoa, whoa)
I'm every woman (whoa, whoa, whoa)
I'm every woman (whoa, whoa, whoa)
I'm every woman (whoa, whoa, whoa)
I'm every woman (whoa, whoa, whoa)
I'm every woman (whoa, whoa, whoa)
I'm every woman (whoa, whoa, whoa)
I'm every woman (whoa, whoa, whoa)
I'm every woman (whoa, whoa, whoa)
I'm every woman (whoa, whoa, whoa)
