		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  As I descend, I see the end
It's reaching up to pull me in
The bowels of Hell, a prison cell
It's decorated with my sin

I smash the shackles, God above me
Your world is toxic, now sink and let me be

Pull me from the void
Trapped beneath the tie of noise
Pull me from the void
Pathetic world I must destroy

Please, pull me from the void
An uphill battle I must climb
So, pull me from the void
Commandingness, you find yourself in time

As I ascend, enough defend
My reasons that I must avenge
A dying dream, unspoken being
I clean myself of you, I'm free

I smash the shackles, God above me
Your world is toxic now sink and let me be

Pull me from the void
Trapped beneath the tie of noise
Pull me from the void
Pathetic world I must destroy

Please, pull me from the void
An uphill battle I must climb
So, pull me from the void
Commandingness, you find yourself in time

Revelation
Revelation

Revelation

Pull me from the void
Trapped beneath the tie of noise
Pull me from the void
Pathetic world I must destroy

Please, pull me from the void
An uphill battle I must climb
So, pull me from the void
Commandingness, you find yourself in time
