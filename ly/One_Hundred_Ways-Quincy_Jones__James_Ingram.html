		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Compliment what she does
Send her roses just because
If it's violins she loves
Let them play

Dedicate her favorite song
And hold her closer all night long
Love her today
Find one hundred ways

Don't forget there could be
An old lover in her memory
If you need her so much more
Why don't you say?

Maybe she has it in her mind
That she's just wasting her time
Ask her to stay
Find one hundred ways

Bein' cool won't help you keep a love warm
You'll just blow your only chance
Take the time to open up your heart
That's the secret of romance

Sacrifice if you care
Buy her some moonlight to wear
If there's one more star she wants
Go all the way

In your arms tonight
She'll reflect that she owes you
The sweetest of debts
If she wants to pay, find one hundred ways

In your arms tonight
She'll reflect that she owes you
The sweetest of debts
If she wants to pay, find one hundred ways

You better believe it or love her today
Find one hundred ways
I'm telling you to love her today
Find one hundred ways

Oh, love her, love her, lover her
One hundred ways
Yeah, you've got to love her today
Find one hundred ways
