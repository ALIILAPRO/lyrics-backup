		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Meet me outside of my palace
Don't need no approval, girl, you valid
Let's make out right by my violets
Don't watch me do it, close your eyelids

Inside, inside, tell me, is it inside?
Inside, inside, tell me, is it inside?
My darling
Inside, inside, tell me, is it inside?
Inside, inside, tell me, is it inside?
My darling

Damn, now we movin' kinda fast
It's cool, I guess you get a pass
I'ma kiss ya neck and grab ya ass
And when I do it, I'ma make it last
Yeah, yeah

Inside, inside, tell me, is it inside?
Inside, inside, tell me, is it inside?
My darling
Inside, inside, tell me, is it inside?
Inside, inside, tell me, is it inside? (Inside)
My darling

Uh, hey baby
Um, I know I keep asking this
Um, but I guess I just really wanna know at this point
You know, we've been intimate for a while
We've been crushing on each other for years
But I guess I'd just really like to know if
You feel the same way about me as I feel about you
You know all your feelings for me inside of your heart
Let me know, bye

Inside, inside, tell me, is it inside?
(Inside, inside, inside, inside)
Inside, inside, tell me, is it inside?
My darling
Inside, inside, tell me, is it inside?
(Inside, inside, inside, inside)
Inside, inside, tell me, is it inside?
My darling
