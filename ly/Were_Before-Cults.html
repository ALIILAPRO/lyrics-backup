		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I met you on the sidewalk
I hoped you were the way you were before
Talking into the small talk
Don't give up on the things that we adore

Oh yes you know I'm like that
I like it like the way we were before
Still got some things to work at
These days just walk around here, Such a chore

We both need it all anew
Just the way were before

We both need it all anew
Just the way were before

I'm pleased to see that old walk
Skipping all the cracks on the concrete
These days have gotten real tough
More [?] someone like you ever seemed

I've been around a few blocks
I chased away the cobwebs in the street
I wound up all the old clocks
So we can say we never skipped a beat

We both need it all anew
Just the way were before

[Chorus]
'Cause we like that
Just like the way we were before
It's all made up
But that's just what we have in store

You can't fix that [x4]
