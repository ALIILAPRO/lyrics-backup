		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Spoiled, self-centered
A woman like this shouldn't be trusted
Devious, heartless
This woman is used to getting what she wants

Good for her, got what she needs
After years of people-pleasing
Made a weapon of her tongue
'Cause she heard you like 'em young, ah
Good for her, they say she lost it
Found your switchblade in her pocket
Everybody should be scared
When they're calling it hysteria, hysteria

Wanted someone who's controllable and moldable
Think you're getting too emotional

Good for her, you're only gonna make it worse 'cause
If you stand in her way, she's not gonna behave
Good for her, I really hope she makes it hurt 'cause
It's what you deserve, she puts her first now, good for her

Beware of a woman scorned
She'll do anything to get her way

Good for her, now look who's got the power
She'll watch you stand in the corner and cower
Baby, you'll end up alone, yet you'll
Watch her take over your throne, bet you

Wanted someone who's controllable and moldable
Think you're getting too emotional

Good for her, you're only gonna make it worse 'cause
If you stand in her way, she's not gonna behave
Good for her, I really hope she makes it hurt 'cause
It's what you deserve, she puts her first now, good for her
