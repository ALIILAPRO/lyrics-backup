		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Been thinking about you, your records a hit
Your eyes are on my wall, your teeth are over there
But I'm still no one, and you're not a star
What do you care?

Been thinking about you, and there's no rest
Shit, I still love you, still see you in bed
But I'm playing with myself
What do you care when the other men are far, far better?

All the things you got
All the things you need
Who bought you cigarettes
Who bribed the company to come and see you, honey

I've been thinking about you, so how can you sleep?
These people aren't your friends, they're paid to kiss your feet
They don't know what I know
Why should you care, when I'm not there?

Been thinking about you, and there's no rest
Shit, I still love you, still see you in bed
But I'm playing with myself?
What do you care when I'm not there?

All the things you got
That you'll never need
All the things you got
I've bled and I bleed to please you

Been thinking about you
