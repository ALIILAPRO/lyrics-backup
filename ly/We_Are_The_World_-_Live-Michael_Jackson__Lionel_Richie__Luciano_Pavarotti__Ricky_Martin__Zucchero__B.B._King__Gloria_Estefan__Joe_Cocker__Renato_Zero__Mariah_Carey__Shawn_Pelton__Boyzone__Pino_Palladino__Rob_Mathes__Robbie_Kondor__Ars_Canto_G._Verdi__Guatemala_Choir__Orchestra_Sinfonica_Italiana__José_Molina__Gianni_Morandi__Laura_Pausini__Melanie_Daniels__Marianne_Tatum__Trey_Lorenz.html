		  Carini, educati, pazienti
Grazie mille a tutti
Grazie, grazie

There comes a time
When we heed a certain call
When the world must come together as one
There are people dying
Whoa, and it's time to lend a hand to life
The greatest gift of all

We can't go on
Pretending day-by-day
That someone, somewhere will soon make a change
We are all a part of God's great big family
And we're truth, love is all we need

We are the world
We are the children
We are the ones who make a better day 
So let's start giving
There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives
It's true we'll make a better day
Just you and me

Oh, send them your heart
So you know that someone cares
And their lives will be stronger and free
Oh, as God has shown us by turning stone to bread
So we all must lend a helping hand

We are the world (we are the world)
We are the children (we are the children, yeah)
We are the ones who make a brighter day 
So let's start giving (oh-oh)
There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives
It's true we'll make a better day
Just you and me (yeah)

Now when you're down and out, there seems no hope at all (hope at all)
But if you just believe there's no way we can fall
No, no, no, just realize
Oh, that a change can only come
When we stand together as one

We are the world (we are the world)
We are the children (we are the children)
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving (let's start giving)
There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives
It's true we'll make a better day
Just you and me 
(Everybody now, come on now)

We are the world (we are the world)
We are the children (we are the children)
We are the ones who make a brighter day 
So let's start giving (so let's start giving)
There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives
It's true we'll make a better day 
Just you and me

We are the world (we are the world)
We are the children (we are the children)
We are the ones who'll make a brighter day 
So let's start giving (giving, so let's start giving)
There is a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives
It's true we'll make a better day 
Just you and me (yeah-yeah) (yeah, yeah)

We are the world (we are the world)
We are the children (we are the children) 
We are the ones who'll make a brighter day 
So let start giving (so let's start giving)
There's a choice we're making (oh, there's a choice we're making)
We're saving our own lives
It's true we'll make a better day 
Just you and me (oh, oh, oh-oh)

Grazie mille
Grazie
Mille grazie, ancora
