		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Nobody normal hurts like this
Nobody normal acts like this
Everything stops and nothing grows
Everything's hot and I'm alone

Nobody's ever going to love
This face I'm afraid of
Nobody's ever going to see
The person I can't be

Nobody normal hurts like this
Nobody normal acts like this
Everything stops and nothing grows
Everything's hot and I'm alone

Nobody's ever going to love
This face I'm afraid of
Nobody's ever going to see
The person I can't be

Nobody normal hurts like this
Nobody normal acts like this
Everything stops and I can't go
Everything starts and I'm alone

Nobody's ever going to love
This face I'm afraid of
Nobody's ever going to love
This face I'm afraid of

Nobody's ever going to love
This face I'm afraid of
Nobody's ever going to love
This face I'm afraid of

Nobody's ever going to love
This face I'm afraid of
Nobody's ever going to love
This face I'm afraid of

And nobody's ever going to love
This face I'm afraid of
Nobody's ever going to love
This face I'm afraid of

Nobody's ever going to love
This face I'm afraid of
Nobody's ever going to love
This face I'm afraid of

Nobody's ever going to love
Nobody's ever going to love
Nobody's ever going to love
Nobody's ever going to love

Death of a heart, death of a heart
Death of a heart, death of a heart
Death of a heart, death of a heart
Death of a heart, death of a heart

Death of a heart, death of a heart
Death of a heart, death of a heart
Death of a heart, death of a heart
Death of a heart, death of a heart
