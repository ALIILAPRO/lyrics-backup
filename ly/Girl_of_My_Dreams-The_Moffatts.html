		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You are the girl of my dreams 
In my heart I believe 
You are the girl of my dreams, 
Baby, of my dreams 

All alone in my room 
Wishing that you were here 
Without you in my arms 
I'm holding back all the tears 

Without you in my life 
I'll never be satisfied 

You are the girl of my dreams 
In my heart I believe 
You are the girl of my dreams, 
Baby, of my dreams 

Sometimes I feel 
I could have been better to you 
All I want is a chance 
To prove that my love is true 

Without you in my life 
I'll never be satisfied 

You are the girl of my dreams 
In my heart I believe 
You are the girl of my dreams, 
Baby, of my dreams 

Baby let's go back in time 
To when our hearts would shine 
And I could hold you tight 
In my dreams at night 

You are the girl of my dreams 
In my heart I believe 
You are the girl of my dreams, 
Baby, of my dreams
