		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Briefly; an imaginary view of our planet after a thermo-nuclear splattering. we hope not.

The sky is falling, timbers they rush down
All is in rubble, vomiting sounds
Screams in the night, yellow and orange
Blackened indent, future deformed

The earth it doth shake, molested and torn
All living aborted, none left but unborn
Contrived devastation, see all is ruined
Bodies, now corpses, bent, broken and strewn

Reduced to ash
Reduced to ash

Self-contained eternity, we've sealed the dawn
By torching the sun with the dragons we have spawned
Farewell to all, it's time to leave
Chaotic waste, too much to grieve

Reduced to ash
Reduced to ash

Reduced
Reduced to ash
