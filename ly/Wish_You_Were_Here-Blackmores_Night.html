		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wish you were here
Me, oh, my country man,
Wish you were here

I wish you were here
Don't you know, the snow is getting colder,
And I miss you like hell,
And I'm feeling blue

I've got feelings for you,
Do you still feel the same?
From the first time I laid my eyes on you,
I felt joy of living,
I saw heaven in your eyes
In your eyes

Wish you were here
Me, oh, my country man,
Wish you were here

I wish you were here
Don't you know the snow is getting colder,
And I miss you like hell
And I'm feeling blue

I miss your laugh, I miss your smile,
I miss everything about you
Every second's like a minute,
Every minute's like a day
When you're far away

The snow is getting colder, baby,
I wish you were here
A battlefield of love and fear,
And I wish you were here

I've got feelings for you,
From the first time I laid my eyes on you
