		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  there's no shame in worry
as long as the worries in control
you say you're sorry 
cause then that's all you know

you don't have to hide
or isolate the circumstance
that follows you
cause they're the stories 
behind the freckles of your youth 

it's okay
you're at home
safe in the bed where you write songs

it's okay
you're not alone
i'm here, we can get your mom

ahhhhh
ahhhhh
ahhhhh
ahhhhh

i don't know you well
i don't have to care this much
i'll say i'm sorry
i won't try'n scare you off

i could let the sun burn on your skin
you don't need me, you don't need him
but there's a solace in having someone
to burn with

it's okay
you're at home
safe in the bed where you write songs

it's okay
you're not alone
i'm here, we can get your mom

ahhhhh
ahhhhh
ahhhhh
ahhhhh

panic

ahhhhh
ahhhhh
ahhhhh
ahhhhh

ahhhhh
ahhhhh
ahhhhh
ahhhhh
