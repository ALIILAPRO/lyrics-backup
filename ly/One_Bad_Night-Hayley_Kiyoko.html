		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Talk with your fingertips
Don't stop the car, let's drive
Suck on your amber lips
Just give me one bad night
Heart beat is razor thin
Hot heat, you make me high
Get underneath my skin
Just give me one bad night

Ohh, ahh
You make me feel like
I wanna be bad
I wanna be bad, bad
Ohh, ahh
Let's have a good time
And never look back
Let's never look back

Talk with your fingertips
Don't stop the car, let's drive
Suck on your amber lips
Just give me one bad night (one bad night)
Heart beat is razor thin (one bad night)
Hot heat, you make me high (one bad night)
Get underneath my skin (give me one bad night)
Just give me one bad night

One bad night
One bad night
One bad night, one bad night

We play with fire
These yellow marks get glowing
Ember on the wire, I'm burning with you on this black tar road
When it feels this good, you don't let go

Ohh, ahh
You make me feel like
I wanna be bad
I wanna be bad

Talk with your fingertips
Don't stop the car, let's drive
Suck on your amber lips
Just give me one bad night (one bad night)
Heart beat is razor thin (one bad night)
Hot heat, you make me high (one bad night)
Get underneath my skin (give me one bad night)
Just give me one bad night

One bad night
One bad night
One bad night, one bad night

All night
Never gonna stay
All night
Never gonna stay
All night

One bad night
One bad night
One bad night
One bad night

All night
All night
