		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We're hearty souls on the ocean's flow
Heave, ho
Onwards we row
Forever off to new shores we go
Heave, ho
Onwards we row

We sail so long and so far from home
We brave the storms and the cold
From port to port on the waves we roam
We're venturesome and bold

We're hearty souls on the ocean's flow
Heave, ho
Onwards we row
The waves they roar and the gales they blow
Heave, ho
Onwards we row

No pillow soft and no lover's breast
The cold it rips through the nights
We long to lay on a gentle chest
And hold warm bodies tight

We're hearty souls on the ocean's flow
Heave, ho
Onwards we row
The sailor's labour is all we know
Heave, ho
Onwards we row

And the wind lifts our songs
And our arms they are strong
Over oceans and rivers we glide
Lift our sails and our hands
We will ride to new lands
Many voyages on many tides

We're hearty souls on the ocean's flow
Heave, ho
Onwards we row
Forever off to new shores we go
Heave, ho
Onwards we row
