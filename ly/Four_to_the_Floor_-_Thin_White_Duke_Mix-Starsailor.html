		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Four to the floor, I was sure
Never seeing clear
I could have it all
If only you were here

Four to the floor, I was sure
Never seeing clear
I could have it all
Whenever you are near

Four to the floor, I was sure
She would be my girl
We'd rent a little world
Have a little girl

Whoa
Whoa

Four to the floor, I was sure
She would be my girl
We'd rent a little world
Have a little girl

Four to the floor, I was sure
Never seeing clear
I could have it all
If only you were here

Whoa
Whoa

Four to the floor, I was sure
She would be my girl
We'd rent a little world
Have a little girl

Four to the floor, I was sure
She would be my girl
We'd rent a little world
Have a little girl

Four to the floor, I was sure
Never seeing clear
I could have it all
Whenever you are near
