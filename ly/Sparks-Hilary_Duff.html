		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't hear a single word
Just know you're talking 'cause your lips keep moving
Every thing I thought I'd learned
Goes out the window
All I want is one thing

You can promise castle, treasures, babies
I don't care
'Cause right now you're just enough for me
I want you near
Like a fairytale to feel your breath right on my neck
You remember what I love so baby take me back

Turn down the lights down low and kiss me in the dark
'Cause when you're touching me baby I see sparks
You make my heart go
You
You, you make my heart go
You
You, you make my heart go

Ticking tocking like a bomb
Throws me back to when I had you closer
Skin to skin we get it on
Without the love I feel you going bolder

You can promise castle, treasures, babies
I don't care
'Cause right now you're just enough for me
I want you near
Like a fairytale to feel your breath right on my neck
You remember what I love so baby take me back

Turn down the lights down low and kiss me in the dark
'Cause when you're touching me baby I see sparks
You make my heart go
You
You, you make my heart go
You
You, you make my heart go

Take it all off
Want every inch of you
Traveling back in time
Tangled up tight
Just like we used to
Now do that thing I like

Turn down the lights down low and kiss me in the dark
'Cause when you're touching me baby I see sparks
You make my heart go
You
You, you make my heart go
You
You, you make my heart go
