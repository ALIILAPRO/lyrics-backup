Da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da

All she want is Gucci and Chanel
All she want is everything they sell
All she want is sushi in hotels
She don't want your love
All she ever want is more, more
All she want is Prada and Dior
Flights to Paris, flights out to New York
All she want is not to be ignored
She don't want your love
All she ever want is more, more
(All she wants is-)

Skin tight dresses
Late night, guest list
Molly, Teslas
Diamond necklace
Tiffany, Cartier, Goyard, Gaultier
Off the runway, omakase

She, she's a work of art
She, she'll tear you apart
Don't, don't care who you are

All she want is Gucci and Chanel
All she want is everything they sell
All she want is sushi in hotels
She don't want your love
All she ever want is more, more
All she want is Prada and Dior
Flights to Paris, flights out to New York
All she want is not to be ignored
She don't want your love
All she ever want is more, more

(All she want is-)
Da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da
(All she want is-)
Da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da
(All she want is-)

She always dosin'
She ain't got no emotion
She cried her oceans
Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah
Heart never open
She addicted to ghostin'
Still she keep postin'
Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah

She, she's a work of art
She, she'll tear you apart
Don't, don't care who you are

All she want is Gucci and Chanel
All she want is everything they sell
All she want is sushi in hotels
She don't want your love
All she ever want is more, more
All she want is Prada and Dior
Flights to Paris, flights out to New York
All she want is not to be ignored
She don't want your love
All she ever want is more, more
All she want is-

Da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da

Woo-ah
(All she want is-)
(All she want is-)
(All she want is-)
(All she want is)

Kim, Paris
Icons only, bitch
Get out if you're not an icon
That's hot
(I love you so much, Paris)
