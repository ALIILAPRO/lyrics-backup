		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Staring into Your eyes
Makes my heart come alive
Suddenly brought to life
When I met You

Reaching beyond the skies
Running deep, stretching wide
Perfect love realized
Here with You

Yeah this love is for real
You will never let go
Never let go, oh
And it's more than just words
Love beyond my control
Out of control

This is real love
This is real love
This is real love
This is real love

You're pulling me closer and closer
Holding my heart till the very end
Jesus, I'm found in your freedom
This is real love, this is real love

In Your heart, I'm found
I want You, I want You
You won't let me down
You got me, You got me

Yeah this love is for real
You will never let go
Never let go, oh
And it's more than just words
Love beyond my control
Out of control

You're pulling me closer and closer
Holding my heart till the very end
Jesus, I'm found in your freedom
This is real love, this is real love
Oh

You're pulling me closer and closer
Holding my heart till the very end
Jesus, I'm found in your freedom
This is real love, this is real love
Oh

Staring into Your eyes
Makes my heart come alive
Suddenly brought to life
When I met You

This is real love
This is real love
This is real love
This is real love

You're pulling me closer and closer
Holding my heart till the very end
Jesus, I'm found in your freedom
This is real love, this is real love
This is real love
