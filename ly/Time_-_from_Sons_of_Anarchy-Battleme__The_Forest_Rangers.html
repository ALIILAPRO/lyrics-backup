		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take me outside now, give me a bed I'm going down
I hear I'm losing bad, it's better to lose than see you again
I've got no wings to fly, clipped them and caged me high
So now your bird's not singing, singing again

I've got this future song
Doing away with the freaks alone
Good it over dry, hitting the cross with my eyes tonight 

I've got no wings to fly, you clipped them and caged me high
So now your bird's not singing, singing again
