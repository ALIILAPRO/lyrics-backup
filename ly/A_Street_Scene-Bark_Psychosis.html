		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm sure you can make it.
Flip side now nothing changes.
I run past your street deserted;
Fading light on your fading face

Incision. Carved out.
No trace of doubt.
I can't extract the truth, you know it.
But what you give you get.
While this place spins like a heavy doorway.
But you've seen it all.

Pretense. Rip this town.
You turn my world upside down

Incision. Carved out.
No trace of doubt.
I can't extract the truth, you know it.
But what you give you get.
While this place spins like a heavy doorway.
But you've seen it all.

Gather it around:
You built it up to tear it down.
