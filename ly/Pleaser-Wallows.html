		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're talkin' while you're fast asleep
As I walk slowly from your house
Back in your room remain the words
I wanna say to you
But couldn't leave my mouth
Does it come as a surprise?
Language of averted eyes
Silence is what I do best

Still I hear it all
Wasting time around my head
So I talk to myself instead

Sitting out the weekend
Couldn't do it again
Say you want it right now
But I wouldn't know how
It's something that I can't do
Then what am I supposed to?
Quite the people pleaser
If only I could please her

Indecisive feelings of enjoyment
Hold the thought, I think I need a moment
I'm aware there's something I should tell you
But my voice annoys me
Bite my tongue off with a smile
I can't feel it anymore
'Cause recently, the line is blurred
Between depression and bliss

Now I see that the times don't change, they waste away
But I just wanna sleep today
And I don't wanna talk to you right now
You say

But, I'm sitting out the weekend
Couldn't do it again
Say you want it right now
But I wouldn't know how
It's something that I can't do
Then what am I supposed to?
Quite the people pleaser
If only I could please her

Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh

I'm talking while you're next to me
Did I ruin the moment?
If I could tell you how I feel
Would you know what the words meant?
For sake of conversation
Could you read the writings on my sleeve?
'Cause that's the best you're gonna get
So maybe I had better leave
