		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Shake your head)
Everybody's gettin' funky
In the days when the funk was gone
I recall not long ago
When the funk it was goin' strong

Now they were rocking upside the wall (to funky music)
Rockin' out in the hall (to funky music)
Now they were jumpin' up and having a ball (to funky music)
Music's got them beggin' for more

Give me more, give me more
Come on
Give me more
Give me more of that
Good old funky music, yeah
Good old funky music, yeah

Yes, indeed they're movin'
Yes, they are doin' it to and fro
Yes, indeed they're groovin'
To that music that will let them go

You know they started somewhere round about midnight (to funky music)
And they rocked it all night until daylight (to funky music)
Music that was groovin' my mother (to funky music)
It's groovy for my sister and brother

Give me more, give me more (come on, let's sing it together)
Give me more
Give me more of that
Good old funky music, yeah
Good old funky music, yeah

Music that was groovin' my mother (funky music)
It's groovy for my sister and brother
Good old funky music, yeah
Good old funky music, yeah
