		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Talk is cheapYou caught me on another losing streakI wish you didn't have to watch me bleedAs I pick up all the pieces that are left of meTrying to look on the upside 
but maybe I'm upside downI tried to fill the space between us 
when we were more than just a couple miles apartGet a map, draw a line that connects You and IAnd follow it to the end to start all over againI keep repeating the same thing without any meaningJust hoping that it takes me back to the beginningI just keep talking myself in circlesTalking round and round in circlesWhat's with the attitudeHow about a little bit of gratitude?Forgive my sweet and sour point of viewbecause I already know the truth of what you think of meTrying to look on the Brightside
Maybe I'm just burnt out
