		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
Touch my mind and my body
Oh come on and put me close to you
Put your arms around me, yeah
Come on and do what you want to do
Touch my mind and my body
Hey, can't you hear the way I'm breathing
Good loving, your good loving, I know
Oh it's all that I've been needing

Touch my mind and my body
Hey, can't you hear the way I'm breathing
Good loving, your good loving, I know
Oh it's all that I've been needing

Touch my mind and my body
Hey, can't you hear the way I'm breathing
Good loving, your good loving, I know
Oh it's all that I've been needing

Touch my mind and my body
Oh come on and put me close to you
Put your arms around me, yeah
Come on and do what you want to do
Touch my mind and my body
Hey, can't you hear the way I'm breathing
Good loving, your good loving, I know
Oh it's all that I've been needing

Touch my mind and my body
Hey, can't you hear the way I'm breathing
Good loving, your good loving, I know
Oh it's all that I've been needing

Touch my mind and my body
Hey, can't you hear the way I'm breathing
Good loving, your good loving, I know
Oh it's all that I've been needing
