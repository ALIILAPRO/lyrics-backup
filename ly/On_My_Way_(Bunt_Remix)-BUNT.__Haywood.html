		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well I've been roaming way too long
I've been singing the same old song
Without ya, without ya
And I've been chasing the sun too long
Sick and tired waking up alone
I need ya, I need ya

I tell myself I need something new
But you're still there like an old tattoo
Would you be there if I come for you?
Coming for you

Don't give up 'Cause I'm on my way
I'm on my way running through the fire
Through the valley through the waves
Don't give up 'Cause I'm on my way
I'm on my way
Running through the darkness till I
See you once again

Well I've been roaming way too long
I've been singing the same old song
Without ya, without ya
And I've been chasing the sun too long
Sick and tired waking up alone
I need ya, I need ya

I tell myself I need something new
But you're still there like an old tattoo
Would you be there if I come for you?
Coming for you

Don't give up 'Cause I'm on my way
I'm on my way running through the fire
Through the valley through the waves
Don't give up 'Cause I'm on my way
I'm on my way
Running through the darkness till I
See you once again
