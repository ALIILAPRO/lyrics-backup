		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don’t wanna die today
Blood in her soul and
Her eyes were grey
I held the brush and began to paint
I know that all men are made from clay
Different color but all the same
I know the odor we blow the same
I know oppression don’t know my name
I know a milli’ gon’ come my way

(Wait what)
Who dat
Slow down girl
How you do that

(Wait what)
Too much
I don’t really see it too much
Niggas doin’ way too much
Don’t talk like that you’re from cunch
My tolerance so low for the bullshit
If I don’t like it then it can’t run

Rain don’t pour on me
In the deep blue sea

Topdeck by the window seat
She’s there right next to me

Bucked her on the 453
And now she wan’ pester me

Made love now I’m hooked on beat
She’s giving me ecstasy

Outside these Mandem play pantomime
I think I don’ lost my mind
More time don’t really fuck with most guys
An obvious reason why
These ties they grow from malicious lies
I’d rather post up inside
Back then I’d never turn up on time
And now I turn up on time
Stay blessed I send praise to the most high
I need to slow down, oh my
I took the loneliest route that night
I need to detox my mind

I need to detox my mind
I need to detox my mind

Rain don’t pour on me
In the deep blue sea

Topdeck by the window seat
She’s there right next to me

Bucked her on the 453
And now she wan’ pester me

Made love now I’m hooked on beat
She’s giving me ecstasy

Rain don’t pour on me
In the deep blue sea

Topdeck by the window seat
She’s there right next to me

Bucked her on the 453
And now she wan’ pester me

Made love now I’m hooked on beat
She’s giving me ecstasy

I need to detox my mind
I need to detox my mind
