		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Waiting by the mailbox, by the train
Passin' by the hills 'til I hear the name
I'm looking for a saw to cut these chains in half and all I want is
Someone to rely on as
Thunder comes a rolling down
Someone to rely on as
Lightning comes a staring in again

I'll wait to be forgiven
Maybe I never will
My star has left me
To take the bitter pill
That shattered feeling
Well the cause of it's a lesson learned
Just don't know if I could roll into the sea again
Just don't know if I could do it all again she said, it's true

Waiting in my room and I lock the door
I watch the colored animals across the floor
And I'm looking from a distance
And I'm listening to the whispers
And oh it ain't the same, when your falling out of feeling and your
Falling in and caught again (caught again)

I'm caught again in the mystery
You're by my side, but are you still with me?
The answer's somewhere deep in it, I'm sorry but your feeling it
But I just have to tell you that I love you so much these days
Have to tell you that I love you so much these days, it's true

My heart is in economy
Due to this autonomy
Rolling in and caught again
Caught again
Caught again
Caught again
My heart is in economy
Due to this autonomy
Rolling in and caught again
Caught again
