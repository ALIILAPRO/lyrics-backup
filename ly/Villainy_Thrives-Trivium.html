		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can feel it aching within every bone inside of me
I can feel it breaking a retaliation release
I need to cause the evil doer suffering
Cant wait to choke the life out from your ?? Bodies

If only I could afflict you
Hurt you in the same way that you hurt
I just want to exact reprisal
Retribution calls

The only way I depict you
Is that your attentions undeserved
Meet the vessel of your reprisal
Retribution calls

Its not that I take life for granted
Its only that the good wont make it
Innocence dies while Villainy Thrives

How can you harm a living thing thinking that its your right
Having you devitalized to prior of innocence
For too long you've gotten away with murder
A fitting justice would be your painful execution

If only I could afflict you
Hurt you in the same way that you hurt
I just want to exact reprisal
Retribution calls

The only way I depict you
Is that your attentions undeserved
Meet the vessel of your reprisal
Retribution calls

Its not that I take life for granted
Its only that the good wont make it
Innocence dies while Villainy Thrives

Its not that I take life for granted
Its only that the good wont make it
Innocence dies while Villainy Thrives

I want to ruin the rapist
Punish the criminal
Violate the abuser
End the murderer

I want to ruin the rapist
Punish the criminal
Violate the abuser
End the murderer

Its not that I take life for granted
Its only that the good wont make it
Innocence dies while Villainy Thrives

Its not that I take life for granted
Its only that the good wont make it
Innocence dies while Villainy Thrives
