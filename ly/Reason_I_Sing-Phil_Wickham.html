		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You pulled me from darkness
And clothed me in garments of praise
Jesus forever my song will be You
I'm living in freedom
You've taken my burdens away
Jesus forever my song will be You
Only for You

For the cross that You bore
And the debt that You paid
For the victory You won
Over death and the grave
This is the reason I sing
For the hope that You give
And the joy that You bring
For the promise that Heaven
Is waiting for me
This is the reason I sing

I will not be silent
I'll testify of Your grace
Jesus forever my song will be You
Only for You

For cross that You bore
And the debt that You paid
For the victory You won
Over death and the grave
This is the reason I sing
For the hope that You give
And the joy that You bring
For the promise that Heaven
Is waiting for me
This is the reason I sing

So good, so good
You're so good to me
Forever I'll sing
You're so good to me

So good, so good
You're so good to me
Forever I'll sing
You're so good to me

For the cross that You bore
And the debt that You paid
For the victory You won
Over death and the grave
Oh this is the reason I sing
For the hope that You give
And the joy that You bring
For the promise that Heaven
Is waiting for me
This is the reason I sing

For the cross that You bore
And the debt that You paid
For the victory You won
Over death and the grave
This is the reason I sing
For the hope that You give
And the joy that You bring
For the promise that Heaven
Is waiting for me
Oh this is the reason I sing
Jesus, the reason I sing
Jesus, the reason I sing
Jesus, the reason I sing
