		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You can have it if you want it
Have it if you want it
Over my dead body
Come and get it, yeah

Back in black
Industry's under attack
The violent pop underdogs are back on track
We're juggernauts
With our backs against the wall
Showbiz's a bitch
We take it by the storm
Going through hell like we call it home
We're selling ourselves just to save our souls
Every dumbass wants to take the throne
They need a young band the show 'em how it goes

The lights are out
I feel the rush now
The crowd is loud
It's time to go out
We're just getting started
Everybody join the party
The lights are out
I feel the rush now

You can have it if you want it
Over my dead body

We keep on dreaming
We're driven only by the feeling inside
We keep living and breathing this way 'til we die, 'til we die
You can have it if you want it
Over my dead body

Back in black
Industry's under attack
The violent pop underdogs are back on track
We're juggernauts
With our backs against the wall
Showbiz's a bitch
We take it by the storm

Coming for everything we couldn't have
Gave it all now we're gonna take it back
And we take some more
And we make it last
Stay tuned for the breakthrough

We keep on dreaming
We're driven only by the feeling inside
We keep living and breathing this way 'til we die, 'til we die
You can have it if you want it
Over my dead body
We're dreaming
So what do you see when you close your eyes?
We keep living and breathing this way 'til we die

We keep on dreaming
We keep living and breathing this way 'til we die, 'til we die
You can have it if you want it
Over my dead body
You can have it if you want it
Over my dead body
You can have it if you want it
Over my dead body
You can have it if you want it, want it
Come and get it

Just get it started
Everybody join the party

We keep on dreaming
We're driven only by the feeling inside
We keep living and breathing this way 'til we die, 'til we die
You can have it if you want it
Over my dead body
We're dreaming
So what do you see when you close your eyes?
We keep living and breathing this way 'til we die, 'til we die

You can have it if you want it
Over my dead body
You can have it if you want it
Over my dead body
