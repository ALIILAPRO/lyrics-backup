		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was raised by a mom
Who told me I should never listen to another voice
But my own
Now I've grown up, now I know
That when I'm tryna be myself it isn't so simple
Anymore

Some days I wake up I just wanna hide under the covers
'Cause no matter what I do I'll never be like all the others

I'm a little O.D.D
Most people really don't get me
I'm the girl in the back of the class
Blank stare, don't care, don't ask
I'm a little O.D.D
And I see the way they look at me
I can hear it when they talk that trash
Saying "Any minute she gon' crack"

Oh
My sister, bless her heart
She was the only one who had my back when everyone
Else did not
Looking back, it's crazy
I almost turned into the person people told me I
I should be

Some days I wake up I just wanna hide under the covers
'Cause no matter what I do I'll never be like all the others
Because

I'm a little O.D.D
Most people really don't get me
I'm the girl in the back of the class
Pink hair but I'm wearing all black
I'm a little O.D.D
And I see the way they look at me
I can hear it when they talk that trash
Saying "Any minute she gon' crack"

I'm a little O.D.D
And I see the way they look at me
I can hear it when they talk that trash
Saying "Any minute she gon' crack"

I'm a little O.D.D
Most people really don't get me
I'm the girl in the back of the class
Fuck bitches, get money, book cash
I'm a little O.D.D
Most people really don't get me
