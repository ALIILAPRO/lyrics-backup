		  Hey, Jay Montana man
Okay, Jay Montana
Hey, Jay Montana man
Oh my God it's Jay Montana man
I just been smoking on dope, yea
Step in all white like the Pope
I'm with some reapers, they taking your soul, yea
I put the beam on his nose
Bullets they hit him, they make him a ghost, yea
I'm finna pour me a four
Raise up your cups, Imma have me a toast, yea
Smoking exotic, I fucked up my lungs
Damnit I just got a cough
I'm up in Boston, balling like Rondo
Catching the pack like I'm Moss
Walk in the store and I'm popping them tags
I do not care what it cost
He running his mouth, we making him famous
We put that boy up on Fox
We were so broke, I was a jhit, Momma was juggin for clothes, yea
'Member them days, I had to walk, now Imma spin inna Rolls, yea
I'm inna crib, smoking a blunt, white boy he smoking a bowl, yea
They like Montana you going so crazy but I had to switch up the flow, yea
Labels keep calling my phone, I told em shut up if it's not bout a M
Every time I make a song, I send it to gang, I'm like yea this a gem
Nigga who switched up on me, they see that I'm up, they try making amends
I use to pray for a V, now I'm at the dealer I'm copping a Benz
Damnit I feel like I'm him
I got a brudda that's shooting this shit and a brudda that jump out the gym
I got a brudda that's swiping them cards and a brudda that's locked inna pen
I got a brudda that pull up with za and a brudda that pull up with gin
So don't be calling me brother if you do not know all the shit that I've been
No, don't be calling me twin
Feel like the President, when I done walked in the spot they all know that I'm in
Shorty she heaven sent but I know when we together we both finna sin
SRT revving it but Imma hop inna stoley when we finna spin
I just been
I just been smoking on dope, yea
Step in all white like the Pope
I'm with some reapers, they taking your soul, yea
I put the beam on his nose
Bullets they hit him, they make him a ghost, yea
I'm finna pour me a four
Raise up your cups, Imma have me a toast, yea
Smoking exotic, I fucked up my lungs
Damnit I just got a cough
I'm up in Boston, balling like Rondo
Catching the pack like I'm Moss
Walk in the store and I'm popping them tags
I do not care what it cost
He running his mouth, we making him famous
We put that boy up on Fox
