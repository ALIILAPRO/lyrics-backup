		  (Classic)
Y-yes
You're now rocking with the SDC
It's the Show Dem Camp omo yes indeed (y-yes)

Gbedu don burst, oja
Cruise of the highest order
Kele won't stop, onja (onja)
Steadily causing problem
Ta lon fa wahala
Ta lon fa wahala nibę
Ta lon fa wahala
Ta lon fa wahala

Came with a banger again (again)
Came here to show them again (again)
The way she dey shake am for me
I start to dey throw away money
Start to dey jolly, she start to dey throw away body
Start to dey jolly, I start to dey throw away money
Ta lon fa wahala (yeah-yeah)
Ta lon fa wahala nibę
Ta lon fa wahala (yeah-yeah)
(Ta lon fa wahala, ta lon fa wahala)

Bad babes holla, say they wan roll (wan roll)
Palm wine papi, what's the dress code? (Dress code)
Love is overrated they prefer streets
Spend the whole December living carefree
Cold nights, hold tight
Been waiting for this moment here my whole life (whole life)
I used to think that money dey control life
But these rich guys chasing all my old pies
Whole gang, new scene
Dropping bangers, making money that's the routine
I just put my brother on some new schemes
Everybody chow, money too clean

Came with a banger again
Came here to show them again
The way she dey shake am for me
I start to dey throw away money
Start to dey jolly, she start to dey throw away body
Start to dey jolly, I start to dey throw away money
Ta lon fa wahala (yeah-yeah)
Ta lon fa wahala nibę
Ta lon fa wahala (yeah-yeah)
(Ta lon fa wahala)

When you bet on yourself, it's like an act of faith
That's how we went from grass to grace
Like Tuface with these classic tapes
Then we drew up a blueprint these new kids tagged and trace
Our legacies will outlast the greats (talk to her)
True shit, man, these niggas too lit
Shut down jand left with a few quid
See, Naija is a Squid Game better move quick 
'Cause you either make money or you make excuses (yeah-yeah)
Transform a booth to a pulpit (ha, God)
Blessings cover me in my new drip (ha, God)
Everybody eats, omo cruise shit
My life's a movie, I'm just scoring the music
Call me Ghost Scorsese, pen arm Brady
Lagos City raised, so it's F y'all, pay me
Silverfox in the spot, cuff your lady
'Cause I'm a legend, dawg, can't play me

Came with a banger again (again)
Came here to show them again (again)
The way she dey shake am for me
I start to dey throw away money
Start to dey jolly, she start to dey throw away body
Start to dey jolly, I start to dey throw away money
Ta lon fa wahala (yeah-yeah)
Ta lon fa wahala nibę
Ta lon fa wahala (yeah-yeah)
(Ta lon fa wahala, ta lon fa wahala)

It's Palm Wine Radio, 1billion.1 FM
