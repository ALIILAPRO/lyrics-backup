		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We're singing Mellow Song
And they're dancing along
We're living in a fantasy
The weather feels so fine
And we're drowning in time
Nothing can be more beautiful to see
I'm so in love with everything
I see on this moment
And I wish I could make this feelings stay
Forever

The evening has come
Let us gather around
We're watching on an open air
Leave everything behind
We got plenty of time
Movie on a summer night

We're singing to the rhyme
Bonfire keeps you warm
Hoping never leave this place
There goes a shooting star
Tell wishes in your heart
We're wishing that we all would stay
I'm so in love with everything
I see on this moment
And I wish I could make this feelings stay
Forever

The evening has come
Let us gather around
We're watching on an open air
Leave everything behind
We got plenty of time
Movie on a summer night
The evening has come
Let us gather around
We're watching on an open air
Leave everything behind
We got plenty of time
Movie on a summer night

The evening has come
Let us gather around
We're watching on an open air
Leave everything behind
We got plenty of time
Movie on a summer night
