		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Its getting hard to breathe
So much weighing on my chest
100 million voices all up in my head
Going la la la la la la
La la la la la la
Wish I was seeing green but today I'm seeing red
I put on a smile but I'm hangin by a thread
Like la la la la la la
La la la la la la

If I could jump 10 years ahead
I'd grab a paper and pen
I'd take my thoughts
Put them down
Stamp it up
And mail it out

Note to self
It's just a wave
Just keep fuckin swimming for another day
Take a breath
You're okay
It might take a minute but you'll find a away
A thousand bad nights when you thought you might drown
And I ain't gonna lie there's no easy way out
But note to self
It's just a wave
Just keep fuckin swimming for another day

But I'm sinking like a stone
And I'm worried for my soul
I spend all day overthinking
I spend all night on my phone
Yeah Californias getting colder
Scary thoughts like October
I got people counting me
Weight of the world on my shoulders
I just need someone to tell me I'll be fine
But I'm all alone in my head tonight
I'm all alone in my head tonight
And something isn't feeling right

If I could jump 10 years ahead
I'd grab a paper and pen
I'd take my thoughts
Put 'em down
Stamp it up
And mail it out

Note to self
It's just a wave
Just keep fuckin swimming for another day
Take a breath
You're okay
It might take a minute  but you'll find a away
A thousand bad nights when you thought you might drown
And I aint gon lie there's no easy way out
But note to self
It's just a wave
Just keep fuckin swimming for another day

Note to self
It's just a wave
Just keep fuckin swimming for another day
Note to self
It's just a wave
Just keep fuckin swimming for another day

Another day
Another day
Note to self
It's just a wave
Just keep fuckin swimming for another day
