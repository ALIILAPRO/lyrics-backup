		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got Yen
In my pocket
Yokohama load

Spin a fucking whip
Fuck a block
With a 40 OE

Sigil with a fang
With the gang
Got a dirty glow

Yen up on the dash
Ima whip it
Like some hippy crack

Racks racks racks
I got Milli’s if we talking Yen
Broke, ran back track
Now my money up again

Flip it, double down again
Locked up in the stu ascend
How the fuck I get here
From a shitty town
Of walking dead

Broke back
Blood rag
Singing till my throat crack

No gas
Full dash
Stepping on some broke glass

Weight up in my voice
I see some shadows by my night stand
Banish with a cherry
I be sparking for the light yeah

Every light I burn
A shadow follow with a fight
I needa bright light all white
Push back the night

Life fly
Right by
Existing to die
Living to thrive
Create to survive

I got Yen
In my pocket
Yokohama load

Spin a fucking whip
Fuck a block
With a 40 OE

Sigil with a fang
With the gang
Got a dirty glow

Yen up on the dash
Ima whip it
Like some hippy crack

Racks racks racks
I got Milli’s if we talking Yen
Broke, ran back track
Now my money up again

Flip it, double down again
Locked up in the stu ascend
How the fuck I get here
From a shitty town
Of walking dead

Broke back
Blood rag
Singing till my throat crack

No gas
Full dash
Stepping on some broke glass

Weight up in my voice
I see some shadows by my night stand
Banish with a cherry
I be sparking for the light yeah

Every light I burn
A shadow follow with a fight
I needa bright light all white
Push back the night

Life fly
Right by
Existing to die
Living to thrive
Create to survive
