		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The closer I get to you
The more you make me see
By giving me all you got
Your love has captured me

Over and over again
I tried to tell myself that we
Could never be more than friends
And all the while inside I knew it was real
The way you make me feel

Lying here next to you
Time just seems to fly
Needing you more and more
Let's give love a try (oh, oh, oh)

Sweeter than sweeter love grows
And heaven's there for those
Who fool the tricks of time
With the hearts of love they find true love
In a special way

The closer I get to you
The more you make me see
By giving me all you got
Your love has captured me

Over and over again
I try to tell myself that we
Could never be more than friends
And all the while inside I knew it was real
The way you make me feel

The closer I get to you
The more you make me see
By giving you all I got
Your love has captured me

The closer I get to you
A feeling comes over me (me too)
Pulling closer, sweet as the gravity

(The closer I get) to you
