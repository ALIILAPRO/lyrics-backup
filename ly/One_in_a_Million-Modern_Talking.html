		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You are one in a million
You are one in a million
You are oh love my love
You are everything for me
You are one in a million
You are one in a million
You caught me with your charms
When you held me in your arms

Oh lonely life, I hear your heartbeat
Deep in the night
I need you so
Know that I can't let you go
Dim all the lights and let me hold you so tight
The night is yours and mine
You're looking fine
Just tonight

Just like a child
You're sometimes weak, sometimes you're wild
You understand, sometimes I feel like a man
Stay here tonight
And let me hold you so tight
You are the one for me
You are my dreams, my reality
