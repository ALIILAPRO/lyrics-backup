		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey
If you ever, you ever
How we doin' over here?

I met you in a dream
I chased you through the street
Turned around and you were gone
I woke up in a daze
The moonlight on your face
My heart was racin' at the thought

If you leave me
Oh, I think that I just might lose it completely, yeah
If you leave me
Hope you know that you're sentencing me to a life on my knees
Don't know who I would be

If you ever leave
If you ever leave

I'm in too deep
Swimmin' in your sea
So tell me where you want to go
'Cause I don't wanna change
Have it any other way
Promise that you'll stay this close

If you leave me
Oh, I think that I just might lose it completely, yeah
If you leave me
Hope you know that you're sentencing me to a life on my knees
Don't know who I would be

If you ever leave
If you ever leave

Come on

Wakin' up with you gone in the mornin'
Goin' to sleep with you not here at night
Oh, these feelings, they would just be so foreign
Can't you stay for the rest of my life?

If you leave me
Oh, I think that I just might lose it completely, yeah
If you leave me
Hope you know that you're sentencing me to a life on my knees
Don't know who I would be

If you ever (leave) (if you ever)
If you ever (leave) (if you ever)
If you ever (leave) (if you ever)

If you ever, you ever
If you ever, you ever
If you ever, you ever, ah

Welcome to your life
There's no turning back
Even while we sleep
We will find you

Acting on your best behavior
Turn your back on Mother Nature
(Everybody wants to rule the world)
Again

It's my own design
It's my own remorse
Help me to decide
Help me make the

Most of freedom and of pleasure
Nothing ever lasts forever
(Everybody wants to rule the world)

There's a room where the light won't find you
Holding hands while the walls come tumbling down
When they do, I'll be right behind you

So glad we've almost made it
So sad they had to fade it
Everybody (wants to rule the world)
All for freedom and for pleasure
Nothing ever lasts forever
(Everybody wants to rule the world)
