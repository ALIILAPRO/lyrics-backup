		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't know where to start
I don't know what to say
What do you want me to say?
I can't see in the dark
This room is getting cold
My mind is getting old
Because I
Refuse to believe
That things are gunna change
When things have stayed the same
For so many years
Through so many complications
And so many tears
In all of your situations
If you had me now would you take me away?
If you had the nerve could you make me stay?
Or go cause I felt the love inside this home
Oh I know that I could lean in but I could be wrong
Cuz it was a memory
It was a waste of time
Could it be over now?
Will I be all right?
It was a hold up
Could it be yours this time?
Take my confession
Write it in your lines
There's something new to find
I'm gunna shut my eyes
Lay down until the new thing dies
Because I
Refuse to believe
That things are gunna change
When things have stayed the same
Oooh
There's nothing left to say
Shut down until it goes away
Oooh
There nothing left to say
Shut down until it goes away
