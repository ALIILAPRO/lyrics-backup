		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Out on the sea we'd be forgiven
Our bodies stopped the spirit leaving
Wouldn't you like to know how far you've got left to go

Somebody's child
Nobody made you
It's not what you stole, it's what they gave you
In or out, you go
In your silence, your soul

Would you rather go unwilling?
The heart is full and now it's spilling
Barreling down the steps
Only a moment left

In hind of sight no peace of mind
Where you begin and I'm defined
Daughter of unconscious fate
Time will tell, in spite of me

In hind of sight no peace of mind
Where it begins and we'll be fine
Shadows bend and suddenly
The world becomes
And swallows me in, me in

Whistle to a friend
Gentle 'til the end
Any way in a name
She takes shape just the same
