		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My love is on the line 
My love is on the line 
My love is on the line 
My love is on the line 

A little late for all the things you didn't say 
I'm not sad for you 
But I'm sad for all the time I had to waste 
'Cause I learned the truth 
Your heart is in a place I no longer want to be 
I knew there'd come a day 
I'd set you free 
'Cause I'm sick and tired 
Of always being sick and tired 

[Chorus:]
Your love isn't fair 
You live in a world where you didn't listen 
And you didn't care 
So I'm floating 
Floating on air 

Oh.. yeah... 

No warning of such a sad song 
Of broken hearts 
My dreams of fairy tales and fantasy, oh 
Were torn apart 
I lost my peace of mind 
Somewhere along the way 
I knew there's come a time 
You'd hear me say 
I'm sick and tired 
Of always being sick and tired 

[Chorus 2x]

My love is on the line 
My love is on the line 
My love is on the line 
My love is on the line 

My love is on the line
