		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I woke up weak today and needing your voice
Crawled into the speakers and turned up the volume
Felt so sick today but cured by your noise
My head in the speakers is drowning out volumes

In ashes to ashes, I'm falling falling
In ashes to ashes, I'm losing losing
In curl and grazes, I'm feeling feeling
In curl and grazes, I'm losing losing 

Turn it up turn it up turn it up turn it up
Turn it up turn it up turn it up turn it up
Turn me on

Turn it up turn it up turn it up turn it up
Turn it up turn it up turn it up turn it up
Turn me on

I dress up bright tonight and needing the beat
Dance into the speakers and max up the volume
Feel so high tonight and moved by my feet
My heart in the speakers is loving the volume

In pretty vacant, I'm jumping jumping
In pretty vacant, I'm moving moving
In teaches of Peaches, I'm speeding speeding
In teaches of Peaches, I'm moving moving

Turn it up turn it up turn it up turn it up
Turn it up turn it up turn it up turn it up
Turn me on

Turn it up turn it up turn it up turn it up
Turn it up turn it up turn it up turn it up
Turn me on

In Delia's gone I'll keep it with mine
Birdland clouds sous le soleil
Sous le soleil exactement sunshine superman
I want you ghosts in some velvet morning
Paper wings Virginia Avenue Laura 
In summer's almost over I walk the line a night
Like this strange fruit

In hat full of hollow, I'm diving diving
In hat full of hollow, I'm screaming screaming
In poison voodoo, I'm living living
In poison voodoo, I'm screaming screaming

Turn it up turn it up turn it up turn it up
Turn it up turn it up turn it up turn it up
Turn me on

Turn it up turn it up turn it up turn it up
Turn it up turn it up turn it up turn it up
Turn me on

Turn it up turn it up turn it up turn it up
Turn it up turn it up turn it up turn it up
Turn me on

Turn it up turn it up turn it up turn it up
Turn it up turn it up turn it up turn it up
Turn me on

Turn it up turn it up turn it up turn it up
Turn it up turn it up turn it up turn it up
Turn me on
