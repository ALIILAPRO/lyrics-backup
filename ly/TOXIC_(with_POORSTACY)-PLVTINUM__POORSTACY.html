		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She says I'm an asshole
She says I'm a scumbag
If it hurts like hell
Then why am I screaming "Hell yeah"?
She says I'm a fuckboy
She says I'm a dickhead
If I hate her guts
Then why am I always in them?
Yeah, yeah

Split ends, mini skirt
Bleached her fucking head
Until it hurt, yeah
(oh God, that fucking hurt)
Brand new Prada bag, can't afford that drip
I think she stole that off Fifth Ave
One bed in Tribeca, says
Kylie's her best friend
But
Last time that I checked she not A list
At best a B+
Studio in Soho, fishnets with the Go-Gos
Said the pops are at her door
It's just UPS though

She says I'm an asshole
She says I'm a scumbag
If it hurts like hell
Then why am I screaming "Hell yeah"?
She says I'm a fuckboy
She says I'm a dickhead
If I hate her guts
Then why am I always in them?
Yeah, yeah

Loving you's toxic
But I can't stop it

I'm an asshole, a hard pill to swallow
She says I'm a narcissist and
I'm so fucking shallow
Yeah my heart is hollow
Wallow in my emptiness
She thinks that I'm such a mess
But I know all about hoes
Push the blame on me
Tell me that it's my fault
And you'll never hurt me
Please just let me be
Tell me that you love me, tell me that you

She says I'm an asshole
She says I'm a scumbag
If it hurts like hell
Then why am I screaming "Hell yeah"?
She says I'm a fuckboy
She says I'm a dickhead
If I hate her guts
Then why am I always in them?
Yeah, yeah

Loving you's toxic
Loving you's toxic
But I can't stop it
