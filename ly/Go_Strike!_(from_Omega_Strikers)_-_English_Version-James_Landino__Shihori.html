		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  cmbitious flame hidden in my heart
Didn't know how to grow from a single fire spark
Nowhere to go, and the road was dark 
Couldn't wait, ran ahead
It's time to move and make my mark

I gave my pride, left all my regret
I just wish to be stronger to give it all my best
What do I do to spread this burning courage? 
Everyday, every night
I'm stuck inside of my head

Don't wanna stay who I am today
Wanna be somebody leading the way?
Don't be afraid, we gotta be brave 
No matter what's coming our way

Strike it down and hype up the crowd
We can bring the energy they've never seen before, oh
There's no doubt we're going all out 
It's time, we can shine the fighting dream inside, so
Don't back down we have the power
I know nothing can stop us or get in the way, ah
Can't stop now, let's take the knockout
My friend, just believe and keep on shouting till the end
Go strike!
