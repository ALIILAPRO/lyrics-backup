		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  I be on the block with my niggas shooting dice all day
Feeling like a philly goat feeling like i'm dyce today

Buss downVVS a patek
Yeah this the icey way
If my bitch said she want it swipe it Don't care what them prices say

It's brockfriedrice lil bro stay safe lil bro better stay dangerous
We coming thru ya block like LA clips and yeah we bangin it

Yeah you know we bangin it
She shake that shit she thangin it
She fwm my name is lit she only want this famous dick

She ask me how she playing
I'm like baby you know
She ask me what i'm saying
I'm like baby you know

I ain't worried about these bitches Man these bitches can go
I'm like baby you know
I'm like baby you know

Ohhh

I tell that bitch v√°monos
I tell that bitch she gotta go
I pull up in that phantom ain't no danny but i gotta ghost

Like can i rewind ya
Get right behind ya
Shawty be wild'n
but she stay out here stylin

She drop drop down lil baby is with it
Chocolate like hersey im giving her kisses

Call me Kung Lao she love how i finish it
Don't throw in the towel no running on quitting

Babygirl like OMG

Think you need ya own airline
Join the club it's mile high

She ask me how she playing
I'm like baby you know
She ask me what i'm saying
I'm like baby you know

I ain't worried about these bitches Man these bitches can go
I'm like baby you know
I'm like baby you know

Ohhh

Nigga think this dragon ball
Freezing shit Vegeta
Watch a nigga Frieza
When i flash em with this heater

Make em say baby ohhh but i ain't Justin Bieber
Had to dick her down she was acting like a diva

If a nigga run up he get done up
We gon do him
If we talking dollars , euros , pesos
Speak it fluent

This blickin shit my movement
Blickin shit my movement
Love the way she shake her hips
Love the way she do it

She ask me how she playing
I'm like baby you know
She ask me what i'm saying
I'm like baby you know

I ain't worried about these bitches Man these bitches can go
I'm like baby you know
I'm like baby you know

Ohhh

She ask me how she playing
I'm like baby you know
She ask me what i'm saying
I'm like baby you know

I ain't worried about these bitches Man these bitches can go
I'm like baby you know
I'm like baby you know

Ohhh
