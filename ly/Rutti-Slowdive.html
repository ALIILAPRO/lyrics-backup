		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Into the light of mine
Inside I fall
Into the light of mine
It's just a love
Into the soul of mine
In by the bed

Into the soul of mine
His soul
His soul the light of mine
It's all a bibe

Into the light of mine
Inside of me
Here's to the light outside 
It's all in pain

I see the soul of you
It's just a life

Into the water of me
Inside your bed 

Go kill the ghost of her
Don't bother me

Here's to the light outside
In the water
In the water
In the water
