		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  IÂ miss my friends and my guitar
And knowing I can travel far
But now I'm only standing here
Completely paralyzed with fearThe fear of who I'll come to be
Of all the weaknesses in me
I truly thought I was prepared
But now I'm panicked and I'm scaredBut how did I become a coward?
How did I become a coward?
(Coward, coward, coward...)I lived alone and I was free
To do whatever came to me
But I was craving to share
If only I could ever dareTo care for someone-else but me
If our two created three
But can i let go of the thrill
turn it into something realBut how did I become a coward?
How did I become a coward?
(Coward, coward, coward...)Little girl, little boy
Do you feel my fear?
And do you feel my joy?
Now you've entered my body
Straight to my heart
And into my soul
Grow, growAnd now a voice inside my head
Is telling me to go ahead
You're not coward(coward...)But how did I become a coward?
