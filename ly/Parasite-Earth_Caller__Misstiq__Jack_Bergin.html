		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I ripped it out
I didn’t want it
I never lied so don’t act like you forgot it
You painted me with a darkened face
No safer space
In disgrace you’ll face the price
I’m fucking over it

Coz I don’t see what you see
I don’t believe what you believe
We will never get back on our feet
Once we’ve fallen to our knees
It’s not about what’s right
It’s about what’s left
You are not what you say you are
(You are)
The boot that’s on our on our necks

Hypocrite, full of shit
I won’t fucking suffer it
No.

I won’t fucking suffer it
Affiliate, capitulate and lie.

I ripped it out
I didn’t want it
You always lie, I won’t act like I forgot it
No safer place, to lay in wait
You are not brave
You can’t even face the lie

Retaliate and devastate their lives
Too afraid to even try
So you, So you, So you
affiliate, capitulate and lie
I’m fucking over it

Coz I don’t see what you see
I don’t believe what you believe
We will never get back on our feet
Once we’ve fallen to our knees
It’s not about what’s right
It’s about what’s left
You are not what you say you are
(You are)
The boot that’s on our on our necks

You don’t even know what you believe
It’s plain to see
You’re drowning in your limitless hypocrisy
If I were you I couldn’t sleep
The days are numbered for your ideology


Life is hard living with you mentality
The things you see are void from reality
Subvert your shame, deflect the blame
Stop playing games
You’re a fucking parasite

Get the fuck out my face
You’re a fucking parasite.
Accept the shame and face the blame
Just face the blame

Coz I don’t see what you see
I don’t believe what you believe
We will never get back on our feet
(Our feet)
Once we’ve fallen to our knees
(Our knees)
It’s not about what’s right
It’s about what’s left
You are not what you say you are
(You are)
The boot that’s on our on our necks

I won’t fucking suffer it
Retaliate and devastate their lives
I ripped it out
I didn’t want it
I never lied so don’t act like you forgot it
You painted me with a darkened face
No safer space
You’re a fucking parasite
