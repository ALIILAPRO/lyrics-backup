		  (My indecision)
(My indecision)
(My indecision)

Jaded and I'm not up for debating
Initiate the collision
My vision will fall apart
I'm not aggravated

Thirty nights where I can hide from you
Dirty lies unfettered by the truth
Is that unnatural
If I avoid it all?

Secrets are things that we bury
In depths so shallow
Uncovered when we're

Gone
This shred of patience
Gone

And I cannot believe you

Jaded and I'm not up for debating
Initiate the collision
My vision will fall apart
I'm not aggravated

Sweet, it's blossoming
So casual
It's gradual
You won't see

My indecision
My indecision
My indecision

I cannot believe you
I cannot believe you

Gone
This shred of patience
Gone

And I cannot believe you
I cannot believe you

Sweet, it's blossoming
Changes so casual
It's gradual
You won't see it

Thirty nights where I can hide from you
Dirty lies unfettered by the truth
Is that unnatural
If I avoid it all?

Sweet, it's blossoming
So casual
It's gradual
You won't see
