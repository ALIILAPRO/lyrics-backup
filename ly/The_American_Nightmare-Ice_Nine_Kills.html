		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Getting ready for bed at a regular time
Is one of the most important habits you can learn
David has probably never stopped to think what a wonderful thing sleep is
Dreams are normal too
Going to bed at a regular time each night
Makes it easier to go right off to sleep

Rest your head, here's a lullaby
A melody for heavy eyes
Early to bed, early to die
Welcome to your worst nightmare

Fast asleep, it's all in your head now
Past the street where they cursed my name
But I won't be forsaken
Craven my revenge from the shallow grave
Where I went down in flames
The beast has been awakened

When night comes creeping
My cruel hand will rock you to sleep

I'm the American nightmare
With American dreams
Of countin' the bodies while you count sheep
I'm the American nightmare
Yeah, I'm living' the dream
I'm slashing my way through the golden age of the silver scream
Sweet dreams

Fell in love with hate 'cause evil fit like a glove
It's fate that I'm still here
And I won't be forsaken
Wicked when I was just a man
But sickening now and fed by fear
The beast has been awakened now
They all think it's just pretend
You'll never ever sleep again
All your friends are fucking dead
You can't turn down your own deathbed

When night comes creeping
My cruel hand will rock you to sleep

I'm the American nightmare
With American dreams
Of countin' the bodies while you count sheep
I'm the American nightmare
Yeah, I'm living the dream
I'm slashing my way through the golden age of the silver scream

I'm the American nightmare
I'm the man of the dreams
Now the cloth is cut
So I'm sinking my claws in the silver scream

One, two, dreams do come true
Three, four, see you at the morgue
Five, six, he'll get his fix
Seven, eight, now shake the twisted hand of fate
No!
Now shake the twisted hand of fate
All your friends are fucking dead

When night comes creeping
My cruel hand will rock you to sleep

I'm the American nightmare
With American dreams
Of countin' the bodies while you count sheep
I'm the American nightmare
Yeah, I'm living the dream
I'm slashing my way through the golden age of the silver scream
I'm the American nightmare
I'm the man of your dreams
Now the cloth is cut
So I'm sinking my claws in the silver scream
