		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I'm down on the darkest
Then you come around and the sparks lit
I can be myself and be honest
I can be myself

I can build a wall out of sadness
You don't give a damn if I'm damaged
You know who I am and the fact is
I can be myself

There been times my friends didn't act like friends
But you did
There been times when I didn't like myself
But you did

I get hi-lo, up, down 
Then I go yes, no
Hold on tight then I let go
You know how to make me feel like it's alright
To be hi-lo, right, wrong 
No, you don't mind though
For me you've always got time so
You know how to make me feel like it's alright

To be high (low, low, low)
High (low, low, low)
High (low, low, low, low)

And I'm learning that's it's all in
The perfect timing
When it's love there's just no denying
That I can be myself

There been times my friends didn't act like friends
But you did
There been times when I didn't like myself
But you did

I get hi-lo, up, down 
Then I go yes, no
Hold on tight then I let go
You know how to make me feel like it's alright (like it's alright)
To be hi-lo, right, wrong 
No, you don't mind though
For me you've always got time so
You know how to make me feel like it's alright

To be high (low, low, low)
High (low, low, low)
High (low, low, low, low)

Yeah, that's just how it goes (to be high, low, low, low)
They're highs then they're lows (high, low, low, low)
That's just how it goes (high, low, low, low, low)
You get it, you get it

That's just how it goes
They're highs then they're lows
That's just how it goes
You get it, you get it
