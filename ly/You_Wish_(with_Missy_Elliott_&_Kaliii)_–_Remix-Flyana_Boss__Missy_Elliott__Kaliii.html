		  (Get in my belly)
Kaliii

Hello, Christ? (Hello) 
My jeans don't fit again (yeah, yeah)
They got me jumpin' up and down when I try to get in 'em (goddamn)
They know what's up, I'm on my shit again (bitch)
They was all like, "One-hit wonder," mm, but they might all tip again (ah)
I need more haters (I need more)
How these niggas havin' all this motion but ain't got no paper? (Ain't got no, uh)
Yeah, who that bad bitch in the club with the ice? (Kaliii)
I got a little, yeah, he a dub for the night
He know I'm not shit but I'm still his type, hahaha
Uh, yeah, I'm paid-paid, locked, so the wig, it's laid-laid
No hand-outs, I'm self-made
Tryna make me mad, better downgrade
Huh, yeah, she cool, ain't poppin' enough
She ain't a ten, she ain't rockin' with us
She ain't like that, why they act so tough? Huh

Get like me?
Nah, you wish
You could never, ever, ever be that bitch
Get like me?
Nah, you wish
You could never, ever, ever, ever, ever
Be that bitch

Hello, wait (wait), what we runnin' from?
Hatin' hoes with Twitter fingers, are you dumb or somethin'?
Black girls up one, we ain't fazed or none
Your opinions don't mean shit, we be flushin' 'em
I be AAA, all these broke hoes that I'm towin' on
You can call me Marvin Gaye 'cause you know what's goin' on
I keep my bag with me like I'm Badu and it's on and on
Tight lip bitch never snitch, pussy confidant

Get like me?
Nah, you wish
You could never, ever, ever be that bitch
Get like me?
Nah, you wish
You could never, ever, ever, ever, ever
Be that bitch

I'm like, never, ever (ever), ever, ever, ever, ever (let's go)
Ever be that bitch, you think I'm wack? Ho, shut up
You know I'm in the Rock N Roll Hall Of Fame, ooh, pressure
I got many hits, it'd take you ten years to catch up
Hit the box, still rock on any block
When you see my car parked, all eyes on me like Tupac
On the charts, I just hopscotch, I got many bops
Who wanna do Verzuz with me? Thought not
Get the camera, I'm sexy glamour
Super thick, love handles
Rest it up like antennas
So juicy like a Tropicana
Switch flows, change the channel
This a smash like a hammer
I'm comin' out like Diana, now, who the boss bitch? Flyana

Get like me?
Nah, you wish
You could never, ever, ever be that bitch
Get like me?
Nah, you wish
You could never, ever, ever, ever, ever
Be that-

You could never ever, ever, ever, ever (woo)
Ever, ever, ever, ever (okay)
Ever, ever, ever, ever be that bitch
You could never ever, ever, ever, ever
Ever, ever, ever, ever (yeah, yeah)
Ever, ever, ever, ever (get in my belly)
