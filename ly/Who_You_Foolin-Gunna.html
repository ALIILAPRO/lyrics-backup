		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wheezy outta here
Huh, uh

Who think you foolin'? We not new to it
We countin' fluent
I'm scammin' a wood, my cup full of mud
I came out the hood
Sometimes a gangsta need a hug
I'ma give all my problems above
Hate when people keep doin' too much
Keep it real, the streets show you no love

We don't need no one vouchin' for us
I've been grindin' and found me a bust
I've been searchin' for love and found lust
It's so hard to stop holdin' a grudge
My lil' dawg split your shit like a Dutch
My whole squad kept the kid in the cut
Keep your strap 'cause these niggas play tough
Pick and chose who the right one to trust
Pick and chose who the right one to trust
Keep it real it's a lot of fake love
Niggas hate but they bitches in love
And the Bentley all white like a dove
I took off, ate this Xan, means it works
Kicked her out, told her walk to the burbs
I'm a sipper, can tell when it's cut
You can't tell me that she ain't a slut

Who think you foolin'? We not new to it
We countin' fluent
I'm scammin' a wood, my cup full of mud
I came out the hood
Sometimes a gangsta need a hug
I'ma give all my problems above
Hate when people keep doin' too much
Keep it real, the streets show you no love

I don't need no one vouchin' for me
I be flossin', ain't talkin' 'bout my teeth
Car push-start, I keep losin' the keys
Chanel boss my closet full of C's
My shit wet Elliantte, VVs
I got pearls 'round my neck, not no beads
I get cash in my bank when I'm sleep
New blue face, two-tone Patek Philippe
Beverly Center, shoppin' spree on me
New agenda, don't do nothin' free
Ain't not one of my foreigns on E
All my bitches got expensive weave
I sip drank for my pain to get eased
I still talk to the Lord on my knees
Helpin' me take care all of my needs
And we take off the top for a breeze

Who think you foolin'? We not new to it
We countin' fluent
I'm scammin' a wood, my cup full of mud
I came out the hood
Sometimes a gangsta need a hug
I'ma give all my problems above
Hate when people keep doin' too much
Keep it real, the streets show you no love
