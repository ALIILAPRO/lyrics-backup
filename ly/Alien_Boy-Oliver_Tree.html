		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I fell down to Earth from a hundred miles away
And somehow I still make it work
But it's overrated and somehow played out

Three doors down so you can't ignore it
I'll hunt you down like a tyrannosaurus
My teeth are sharp like a great white shark
Let me taste that flesh, it's my favorite part
Got a eagle beak, with the ostrich feet
Seven spider eyes for every day of the week
Means I'm still up working while your bitch-ass sleeps
I'm an alien among the human beings

I fell down to Earth from a hundred miles away
And somehow I still make it work
But it's overrated and somehow played out

Ten doors down but you still can't see me
I talk a lot of shit so you won't believe me
I really wouldn't say anything else
I shouldn't be standing here all by myself
'Cause I'm out there
Tried to tell you that I'm out here on my own
I told you I was out there
Tried to tell you that I'm out here on my own

I fell down to Earth from a hundred miles away
And somehow I still make it work
But it's overrated and somehow played out

Ah, I won't be here long at all

I fell down to Earth from a hundred miles away
And somehow I still make it work
But it's overrated and somehow played out
