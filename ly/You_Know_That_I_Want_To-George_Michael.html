		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lover don't love too much
It's a bad thing, a sad thing
It is heaven to the touch
Hey everybody's got a moment in their lives
They can't change
(don't they baby)

I know you don't care
What's right or wrong
All that I know
Is that love don't belong heer
So it's better to turn the page
Watch me walk away my dear
Watch me walk away
You say

[Chorus]
I can't stop but you know that I want to
I can't stop don't you know that I want you
I want you baby
More than ever
I can't stop but you know that I want to
I can't stop don't you know that I want you

But it's never gonna be that easy
I don't want to waste your time

Lover don't love too much
I'm a bad boy, a sad boy
And I'll never give you much
Hey everybody's got some moment in their lives
They can't change
Yeah

So I do not dare
Take you home
All that I know
Is that something's so wrong with this heat
Why do you touch the flame
You know you feal the pain my dear
You always find it here
You say

[Chorus]

But it's never gonna
So what happens everytime
It's so easy to forget myself where
A little while you want a boy
In a place you will be all mine
Can't you see

Oh, I'm losing you baby
Chorus
But it's never gonna be that easy
You want a lover, I am just a friend
