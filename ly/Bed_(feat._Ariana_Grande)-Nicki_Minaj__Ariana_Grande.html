		<p>
		  Got a bed
Wit' your name on it
Wit' your name on it
Got a kiss
Wit' your name on it
Wit' your name on it

Thousand dollar sheets
Waitin' for you on some thousand dollar sheets
I got Carter III on repeat
Back shots to the beat of (A Milli') on you
Got me acting like you got a milli' on you
You say I'm the GOAT, yeah, the billy on you
I could make all your dreams come true
Wanna fall through
Then you better come through (come through)

But don't make me wait until the morning (the morning)

Got a bed
Wit' your name on it
Wit' your name on it
Got a kiss
Wit' your name on it
Wit' your name on it
Love me good
Love me down
Don't turn me down
Got a bed
Wit' your name on it
Wit' your name on it

Strawberry lingerie
Waitin' for you, strawberries, lingerie
You told me you on the way
Mess around, mess around, put it down on you (you)
I'ma do everything I said I'm gon' do (do)
Pretty little body, it look better on you (you)
Might have to blow it like a feather on you (you)
Waterfalls, ooh, yeah, you better come through (come through)

But don't make me wait until the morning

Got a bed
Wit' your name on it
Wit' your name on it
Got a kiss
Wit' your name on it
Wit' your name on it
Love me good
Love me down
Don't turn me down
Got a bed
Wit' your name on it (oh, yeah)
Wit' your name on it (on it)

O-on, on it (on it)
O-on, on it
O-on, on it
O-on, on it (bed wit' your name, oh yeah)

Yo, he in my startin' five
He get his city live
These niggas scared they doin' fifty in a fifty-five
I'm tryna clap him like somebody told him, "Gimme five"
I'ma be a half an hour but I told him gimme five
I'm tryna dance on him, blow my advance on him
I like him better when he got some sweatpants on him
I like his hang time, he said his head right
I said, "Go all the way down and then head right"
I watch him fuck it up, look at him luckin' up
I said, "You need some thick skin, baby, suck it up"
He go insane on it, I put my fame on it
Coulda' put Zayn on it, but I put your name on it

I got a bed
Wit' your name on it
Wit' your name on it
Got a kiss
Wit' your name on it 
Wit' your name on it, yeah
Love me good
Love me down
Don't turn me down (turn it down, baby)
Got a bed
Wit' your name on it (your name)
Wit' your name on it
