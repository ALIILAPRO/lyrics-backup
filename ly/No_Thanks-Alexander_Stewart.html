		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You already know the way I feel
Promised you that I would keep it real, yeah, yeah
I've been straight up
Told you I wanted love

You keep tryna put me on the side
Expecting me to wait 'til you decide, yeah, yeah
Stop trying to fade
I don't have time to waste

You keep playing my emotions like a yo-yo
So far us to keep this going that's a no no
Next time you ask to hang
I'ma say

No thanks
I don't wanna just be friends
With you
No thanks
I'm not doing this again
With you
No thanks
We've been down this road before
And you know that I want more, yeah
Tired of being in this game
With you
No thanks

Everything you do is hard to read
Only person in the dark is me, yeah, yeah
Quit acting cute
I don't like when you do

You keep playing my emotions like a yo-yo
So far us to keep this going that's a no no
Next time you ask to hang
I'ma say

No thanks
I don't wanna just be friends
With you
No thanks
I'm not doing this again
With you
No thanks
We've been down this road before
And you know that I want more, yeah
Tired of being in this game
With you
No thanks

I'ma say
No thanks
I don't wanna just be friends
With you
No thanks
I'm not doing this again
With you
No thanks
We've been down this road before
And you know that I want more, yeah
Tired of being in this game
With you
No thanks
I'ma say
No thanks
