		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  People been talking about it
We won't just stand here in silence
Can't stop the fire from rising
Rising
Ooh Ooh

People don't you be afraid
So many innocents slain
This is an era for change
Change

And Malcolm's probably turning in his grave

Every shade was beautifully made

And Powerful
There's so much strength in you and me
Powerful
A breathe away from victory

I matter
You matter
We matter, all
I matter
You matter
We matter, all

Powerful
Powerful

I see a colorful future
Where skin don't define any human
And stars are the only thing shooting
Shooting, wow oh

Mothers that bury their child
How can we sit there and hide
Change comes when all take a stand now
Stand up
Stand up

Martin's speech still echoes in my brain

Every shade was beautifully made

And Powerful
There's so much strength in you and me
Powerful
A breathe away from victory

I matter
You matter
We matter, all
I matter
You matter
We matter, all

Powerful
Powerful

Oh Oh, Oh Oh, Oh.Oh
Oh Oh, Oh Oh, Oh.Oh
Oh Oh, Oh Oh, Oh.Oh

Powerful

There's so much strength in you and me
Powerful
A breathe away from victory

I matter
You matter
We matter, all
I matter
You matter
We matter, all

Powerful
Powerful
