		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Pull up in the '97 Benz (baby, get up in)
Sexy with that fire truck red (with the windows tinted)
Smokin' while I cruise through the valley (you so ignorant)
Looks like we don't give a shit (looks like we don't give a shit)
Looks like we don't give a shit (looks like we don't give a shit)
Looks like we don't give a shit (looks like we don't give a shit)
Looks like we don't give a shit (looks like we don't give a shit)
Looks like we don't give a shit (looks like we don't give a)

Yeah, I ain't got no skeletons in my luxury walk-in
They ain't know I'm innocent, baby, look who is talkin'
They ain't even ready spaghetti, baby, they sauceless
Speedin' through the city, we medicated the horses
You could hit up PETA., the paint on me make me gorgeous
I'ma take the geese and chinchilla coat on a walk and
Don't forget the cheetah print, speed up, come here, record it
If that shit ain't bleedin' and screamin' I do not want it
Take it back

Pull up in the '97 Benz (baby, get up in)
Sexy with that fire truck red (with the windows tinted)
Smokin' while I cruise through the valley (you so ignorant)
Looks like we don't give a (looks like we don't give a shit)
Said looks like we don't give a shit (looks like we don't give a shit)
Looks like we don't give a shit (looks like we don't give a shit)
Looks like we don't give a shit (looks like we don't give a shit)
Looks like we don't give a shit (looks like we don't give a)

Yeah, said if these are clothes, motherfucker, what are those?
You look like a butter face, butter body, butter toes
I put Can't Believe It on my early morning butter toast
Y'all cannot believe I'm not a fiend and that it wasn't coke
You look so uncomfortable
You could have a seat and several hundred mo'
Hop up off my D just like a bunny go
Hop up out the scene and now they want it mo', I don't know
I like when they plead and beggin', "Please, now where the fuck is Doj'?"
Pull up and they smiley instead (actin' stupid)
Like they wasn't tryna fight me in Threads ('bout some music)
In a tweet that I'ma probably still stand by (I'm ruthless)
Keep ya money, funky bitch, 'cause I don't play about the (the rumors)
They gon' buy it, they gon' pirate, they gon' play it, they consume it
If you scootin', let me know 'cause that's a comment, that's a view
And that's a ratin', that's some hatin', that's engagement, I could use and
I could teach y'all how to do this, but I'd much rather be cruisin'

Watch me pull up in the '97 Benz (baby, get up in)
Sexy with that fire truck red (with the windows tinted)
Smokin' while I cruise through the valley (you so ignorant)
Looks like we don't give a shit, said (looks like we don't give a shit)
Looks like we don't give a shit (looks like we don't give a shit)
Looks like we don't give a shit, yeah (looks like we don't give a shit)
Looks like we don't give a shit, huh (looks like we don't give a shit)
Looks like we don't give a shit, huh (looks like we don't give a)
Looks like we don't

'Cause we don't, motherfucker
That's 'cause we don't, little bitch
That's 'cause we don't
