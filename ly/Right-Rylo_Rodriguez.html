		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm from the trenches, we see 12, we hit a route like Chase
Or CeeDee Lamb, they got the trap house wide open
Opps in the club, tryna have starin' matches with a nigga
Can't wait to catch him, leave him dead with his eyes open
I thought when you make your problems gon' just go away or somethin'
I know that sound a little bit crazy but that's the real
Picked up a switch, left his equipment, he in the field
Money comin' in, I still ain't signed a major deal
Lil' bro died off a pill
No nigga ain't never popped more seals than me, I sip more lean than C
Know the game, I signed my cleats
She callin' my phone, I'm in the city, girl, like I signed to P
Yeah, he killed a nigga, he did it on camera, he ain't take a plea
I pray he beat it too
I answer when you call, but you ain't pick up when I needed you
In Houston, James Harden house, we ain't playin' hoops
Just got a message from your area code was 8-3-2
Wonder why I only get your texts when I'm in Texas

How bad you want it? (How bad you want it?)
How bad you want it? (How bad you want it?)
How bad you want it? (How bad you want it?)
If lovin' you is wrong, then I don't wanna be right (what you got?)
I got niggas who I love that died, and I still haven't cried (the stories never told)

I'm so used to death, can't even shed no more tears
I'm so used to you dependin' on me for real
You have a family that I ain't seen in years
Cooler still'll get you bailed
Locked in, we ain't playin' Madden, just make sure you get the bill
Backdoor, we readin' books, hopin' he get pardoned
She text me, "Oh," I texted her "blocked," she from Parkway Garden
He rock strong, I don't feel the act
And he got bodies, but he told, that boy a killer rat
Jo like my spine, miss my lil' bros, wish I could get 'em back
I got all my jewelry, yeah, I'm posted in the trenches
Hittin' potholes, spillin' codeine in the Bentley

How bad you want it? (How bad you want it?)
How bad you want it? (How bad you want it?)
How bad you want it? (How bad you want it?)
If lovin' you is wrong, then I don't wanna be right
I got niggas who I love that died, and I still haven't cried
