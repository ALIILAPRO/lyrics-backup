		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How can you
Say the truth
When you
Can barely speak
What can I think
When perception
Is expanding infinitely

I don't have the answers
I must come clean
You broke the spell
Over me
Exhausted by the rain
And tempted in the fog
I'm led astray
In the dark

When the pieces
Come together
You tear them apart
Is it because
You are compelled
By a disorder
In your heart

I don't have the answer
I must come clean
You broke the spell
Over me
Exhausted by the fog
And tempted in the rain
I'm led astray
By the dark again

By the dark again
By the dark

How can we know
When we don't think
For ourselves
At all
Does of any of this
Make any sense
Or are we
Trapped again

I don't have the answer
I must come clean
You broke the spell over me
Exhausted by the fog
And tempted in the rain
I'm led astray
By the dark again
I don't need the answer
I won't come clean
You can't break the spell
Over me
I'm lost in the fog
And dancin' in the rain
I won't be led astray again
