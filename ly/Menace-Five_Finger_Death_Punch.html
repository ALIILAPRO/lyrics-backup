		<p>
		  Oh yeah, fuck it!

Yeah!

Oh
I've got a killer's blood
Running deep inside my veins
(Down in my veins)
Don't expect you to understand
I was born without a name
(No name)
I see right through you, your opinions are a fucking joke
(Haha)
I crucify you, on a silver spoon I hope you choke

I'm tired of trying to please the world that spins around me
This time I'm doing it for me and me alone
I don't need anyone, don't think I ever did
Not trying to be selfish, just doing what I know

I'm a menace!

Right!

Oh
I'll fade the fuck away
Swear to God that I don't care
(I swear to Christ)
I'll die a lonely death cause I know that life ain't fair
(It ain't fair at all)
I can't pretend that I am someone that I'm not
I live for me, myself
You can't convince me that I'm wrong

I'm tired of trying to please the world that spins around me
This time I'm doing it for me and me alone
I don't need anyone, don't think I ever did
Not trying to be selfish, just doing what I know

I'm a menace!

Right!

Yeah!

I'm tired of trying to please the world that spins around me
(Why?)
This time I'm doing it for me and me alone
(All for me)
I don't need anyone, don't think I ever did
Not trying to be selfish, just doing what I know

I'm a menace!

I'm tired of trying to please the world that spins around me
(Why?)
This time I'm doing it for me and me alone
(All for me)
I don't need anyone, don't think I ever did
Not trying to be selfish, just doing what I know

I'm a menace!

Fucking menace!

Oh menace!
