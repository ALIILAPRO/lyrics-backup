		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (okay)

I was out getting faded 'til she hit me up
She heard I was zoning, girl, you trip too much
It's only been like three months
Why you take it personal, personal like that?
I like to push her buttons, it gets her tight
I say something slick like, "Maybe I ain't your type"
Your problem is you get angry
You always take it personal, personal like that
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)

Ooh, alright, I'll make it up tonight (alright, I'll make it up)
I wanna do all the things that you like
Provided, you give me time
I'm saying you, you're right
You deserve what you like
I don't even care about the cost
I came here just to break you off

Just come and, come and break me off

Why you provoking me, boy please
Why do you fuck with me, knowing
I'm gonna take it personal, I always take it personal
You should know I'm like that
You like to get me hot, you test me
You know how to hit the spot, touch me
I'm gonna take it personal
I always take it personal, you should know it's like that

Ooh, alright, better make it up tonight
You gotta do all the things I like
Wine and dine me right
I'm saying ooh, alright, I deserve what I like
I don't really care how much it cost
Just come and, come and break me off

(Come and break me off, I deserve your love)
Just come and, come and break me off
(I deserve your love, I deserve your love, yeah)

Won't you say, why won't you say
(I want your love)
Won't you say, why won't you say
(I want your love)
Won't you say, why won't you say
(I want your love)
Won't you say, why won't you say
(I want your)

Ooh, alright, I'll make it up tonight (alright, I'll make it up)
I wanna do all the things that you like
Provided you give me time
I'm saying you, you're right, you deserve what you like
I don't even care about the cost
I came here just to you break you off

Oh, oh-oh (oh-oh)
Hey, hey-hey-hey (hey-hey-hey)
Your love, your love
I deserve it, said I deserve it
