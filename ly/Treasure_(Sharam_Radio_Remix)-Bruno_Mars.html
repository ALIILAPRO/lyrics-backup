		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Baby squirrel you'se a sexy mother fucker)
Give me all, give me all, give me all your attention baby (attention baby)
I got to tell you a little something about yourself (self)
You're wonderful, flawless, oh you're a sexy lady (sexy lady)
But you walk around here like you wanna be someone else (else)

I know that you don't know it, but you're fine, so fine (fine so fine)
Oh girl I'm gonna show you when you're mine, oh mine (mine oh mine)

Treasure, that is what you are
Honey you're my golden star
You know you can make my wish come true
If you let me treasure you
If you let me treasure you oh

Pretty girl, pretty girl, pretty girl you should be smiling (you should be smiling)
A girl like you should never live so blue (blue)
You're everything I see in my dreams
I wouldn't say that to you if it wasn't true (true)

Oh, I know that you don't know it, but you're fine, so fine (fine so fine)
Oh, oh girl I'm gonna show you when you're mine, oh mine (mine oh mine)

Treasure, that is what you are
Honey you're my golden star
You know you can make my wish come true
If you let me treasure you
If you let me treasure you

You are my treasure, you are my treasure
You are my treasure, yeah, you you you, you are
You are my treasure, you are my treasure
You are my treasure, yeah, you you you, you are

Treasure, that is what you are (you are my treasure)
Honey you're my golden star (you are my treasure)
You know you can make my wish come true (you are my treasure)
If you let me treasure you (you are my treasure)
If you let me treasure you (you are my treasure)
