		  Hmm ahh ah ahh
Aahn (Cook that thing)

Can't seem to take my eyes off you
Especially your Python move
The way you hold that thing
Me wan hold that thing
Baby let me take a look
Oh Lord me want all the girls in the whole world (Me want all the girls in the whole world)
I know what I'm doing is so wrong (I know what I'm doing is)
But since no man can focus
We definitely don't give a fuck

She said she know me get ah girlfriend
And so what
What if I
What if I
What if I (What if I)
What if I do ahnn
She said she know me get ah woman on mi bed
What if I
What if I
What if I (Oh na na na)
What if I do

Listen to me quick
So mi girlfriend said she want me back home by two
What will I do
So mi tell her say my car broke down at Mile 2
Girl I won't be home so soon
Oh Lord me want all the girls in the whole world (Me want all the girls in the whole world)
I know what I'm doing is so wrong (I know what I'm doing is)
But since no man can focus
Me definitely don't give a fuck

She said she know me get ah girlfriend
And so what
What if I
What if I
What if I (What if I)
What if I do ahnn
She said she know me get ah woman on mi bed
What if I
What if I
What if I
What if I do

Girl I am wayward
E be like na the only way forward
Your back looking like two planets
You're not from this same world (Alright)
Girl I am famous
Swear down I'm a playboy too
And if e burst up my brain too much
Shall swear I fit break up oh yeah

Can't seem to take my eyes off you
Especially your Python move
The way you hold that thing
Me wan hold that thing
Baby let me take a look
Oh Lord me want all the girls in the whole world (Me want all the girls in the whole world)
I know what I'm doing is so wrong (I know what I'm doing is)
But since no man can focus
We definitely don't give a fuck

She said she know me get ah girlfriend
And so what
What if I
What if I
What if I (What if I)
What if I do ahnn
She said she know me get ah woman on mi bed
What if I
What if I
What if I (What if I)
What if I do

She said she know me get ah girlfriend
And so what
What if I
What if I
What if I (What if I)
What if I do ahnn
She said she know me get ah woman on mi bed
What if I
What if I
What if I (What if I)
What if I do

What if I (What if I)
What if I do (Kukuruku)
