		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mama always told me don't you run
Don't you run with scissors, son
You're gonna hurt someone
Mama told me look before you leap
Always think before you speak, and watch the friends you keep

Stay along the beaten path, never listened when she said

Sharp edges have consequences
I guess that I had to find out for myself
Sharp edges have consequences
Now every scar is a story I can tell

Should've played safer from the start
Loved you like a house of cards
Let it fall apart
But all the things I couldn't understand
Never could've planned
They made me who I am

Put your nose on paperbacks
Instead of smoking cigarettes
These years you're never getting back

Stay along the beaten path, never listened when she said

Sharp edges have consequences
I guess that I had to find out for myself
Sharp edges have consequences
Now every scar is a story I can tell

We all fall down
We live somehow
We learn what doesn't kill us makes us stronger
We all fall down
We live somehow
We learn what doesn't kill us makes us stronger

Ooh
Stay along the beaten path, never listened when she said

Sharp edges have consequences
I guess that I had to find out for myself
Sharp edges have consequences
Now every scar is a story I can tell

We all fall down
We live somehow
We learn what doesn't kill us makes us stronger
We all fall down
We live somehow
We learn what doesn't kill us makes us stronger, ooh
