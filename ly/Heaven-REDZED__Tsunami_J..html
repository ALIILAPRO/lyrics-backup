		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Angels cry
Suicide
Take my hand
Realize
It's all in good fun
Loading my gun
Blow my brains out
Burn and fade out

I hate this 
Can we fake it 
I made this
Let's base it
I hate this 
Can we face it 
I made this
Let's base it

Fuck I'm just a fiend
I might dance out in the rain
I keep coming up with numbers till I run out of my brain

I keep looking in the streets for my next dose I might need
All these lovely women all they want are diamonds and a ring

I love these pills but all my friends 
They think I just like leaving
I'm kneeling to the beings
Greeting me with bleeding briefings
Revealing what they're stealing
I say that they're not real and
Appealing to my treason
But they know I won't stop healing

I hate this 
Can we fake it 
I made this
Let's base it
I hate this 
Can we face it 
I made this
Let's base it

I be waiting and craving
And thinking 'bout the past
I am hating, the fading
I was not built to last

I be waiting and craving
And thinking 'bout the past
I am hating, the fading
I was not built to last

(And no more thoughts)
