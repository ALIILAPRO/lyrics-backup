		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My life is a different story 
It's a movie written by God
My heart on my sleeve so baby, my wrist gon' drip enough blood 
My dice got the heavenly roll and
My six got a perfect landing 
My life is a different story, it's a movie written by

My life jagajaga 
My life wuruwuru 
I dey thank God for mercy oh 
I for don enter kuru
My life jagajaga oh 
My life wuruwuru 
I dey thank God for mercy oh 
I for don enter kuru

My life jagajaga 
My life wuruwuru 
I dey thank God for mercy oh 
I for don enter kuru
My life jagajaga oh
My life wuruwuru 
I dey thank God for mercy oh 
I for don enter kuru

Kuru, kuru kuru kuru
Kookoorookoo omo morning don reach 
Find cash pass lady donli 
Kuru, kuru kuru kuru
She know where the struggle don reach 
She come start to do for her fans only 
Ah hm
This pain, dey my head 3-6-5 days 
Soldier man no look side ways
Soldier man, no look my age oh 
Hm hm
Earth quake, soldier man no gree migrate 
Mami water right and left
Soldier man no gree hydrate oh 
Hm hm, oh

My life is a different story 
It's a movie written by God
My heart on my sleeve so baby, my wrist gon' drip enough blood 
My dice got the heavenly roll and 
My six got a perfect landing 
My life is a different story, it's a movie written by

My life jagajaga 
My life wuruwuru 
I dey thank God for mercy oh 
I for don enter kuru
My life jagajaga oh
My life wuruwuru 
I dey thank God for mercy oh 
I for don enter kuru

That's a story you'd pay to document 
Kept it running even when I lost my legs 
No accident wey happen accidentally 
E be destiny plotting 
E hook me for neck like bow tie 
That's why you see me clinging to the most high 
That's my father never dropped his chaplet
And that's why you acting like you seen a ghost, I never buckle under pressure (never) 
For kolawole I been dey beg God 
As-salaam-alai, now I'm bout to be an export (ehen)
Them look me for my wheel chair, think say I wan dey play dress up (oh no) 
Them been no wan gree say I be next up, they try shadow all my effort
But I go dey move until I reach God, olofofo go dey escort 

My life jagajaga 
My life wuruwuru 
I dey thank God for mercy oh 
I for don enter kuru
My life jagajaga 
My life wuruwuru 
I dey thank God for mercy oh 
I for don enter kuru

My life is a different story 
It's a movie written by God
My heart on my sleeve so baby, my wrist gon' drip enough blood 
My dice got the heavenly roll and 
My six got a perfect landing 
My life is a different story, it's a movie written by
