		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When we spent all day doing nothing at all
Left my in phone in the car
You showed me all your favourite songs
We danced all night on the roof of your house
And i miss all of that
But it's ok if you don't
Then I keep it for the both of us
I should be over you by now
But i can't get out of this town
Wish i could see the world
A different view
With tinted eyes
That makes it blue
Do you still think of us two?
When we spent all day doing nothing at all
Left my in phone in your car
You showed me all your favourite songs
We danced all night on the roof of your house
And I miss all of that
But it's ok if you don't
Then I keep it for the both of us
It's ok if you don't
Then I keep it for the both of us
Yeah it's ok if you don't
Then I keep it for the both of us
It's not fair that i feel like this
Cause you seem so fine without me
But I'm sorry for you
If you can't remember the good
Like the weekend we spent in woods talking 'bout how we got through the shit we been through
Yeah we danced all night on the roof of your house
And I miss all of that
But it's ok if you don't
Then I keep it for the both of us
Yeah it's ok if you don't
Then I keep it for the both of us
