		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everybody in the world are you with me?
It's too late to try to run, we run the city
It's my time, it's your time
Held me down, now it's don't give a fuck time
It's go time, it's show time
Sing it with me everybody let's go

'Cause it's one, it's one, one for the money
Two, it's two gots too much for the show
Three, it's three, three get ready
Are you ready motherfuckers? Are you ready? Let's go!

'Cause it's one, it's one, one for the money
Two, it's two gots too much for the show
Three, it's three, three get ready
Are you ready motherfuckers? Are you ready? Let's go!

Let me see you start a war, start a riot
When there's nothing left to burn, hear the silence
Hate me, you can't escape me and you ain't ever gonna change me
I can't stand it, I've fucking had it, I'm about to blow

'Cause it's one, it's one, one for the money
Two, it's two gots too much for the show
Three, it's three, three get ready
Are you ready motherfuckers? Are you ready? Let's go!

'Cause it's one, it's one, one for the money
Two, it's two gots too much for the show
Three, it's three, three get ready
Are you ready motherfuckers? Are you ready? Let's go!

'Cause it's one, it's one, one for the money
Two, it's two gots too much for the show
Three, it's three, three get ready
Are you ready motherfuckers? Are you ready? Let's go!

'Cause it's one, it's one, one for the money
Two, it's two gots too much for the show
Three, it's three, three get ready
Are you ready motherfuckers? Are you ready? Let's go!

Are you ready? Let's go!
