Just what in the world has come over you
Is it some kind of game you're playin' with me

Fed up, tired and lonely
Gonna run away and hide
Was riding, tryin' to get to heaven
Was riding down the road feeling bad
Left me standing in the doorway cryin'
â€˜Til my eyes begin to bleed

Just what in the world has come over you
Shall I hold you close or let you go by
Just what in the hell has come over you
Is it some kind of game you're playin' with me

Blind
Tired
Blind

You left your feelings out there hanging
Just don't know what I'm gonna do
It's just a game, it's the same old story
This kind of love could you ever be true
You left me standing in the doorway cryin'
I'd give anything to be with you

Just what in the world has come over you
Shall I hold you close or let you go by
Just what in the hell has come over you
Is it some kind of game you're playin'

Just standing in the doorway cryin'
Gonna run away and hide
Got no place left to turn
Is the love in your heart turning

You left me standing in the doorway cryin'

Just what in the world has come over you
Shall I hold you close or let you go by
Just what in the hell has come over you
Is it some kind of game you're playin' with me

Blind
Tired
Blind
Tired
Blind
Tired
Blind
