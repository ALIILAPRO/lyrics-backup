		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You focus on the words I said
Burning me up like I knew you would
Then you're burning me up like
I knew you would
Then you're burning me up and
It's all over again

You greet me in your favourite place
Telling me it's over
(you) bet I wouldn't mind and then
Then you're burning me up like
I knew you would
Then it's all over again like
I knew it would

I never loved my body watching all the rest
And then I'd took in every mirror honey
Falling in despair
Yes then I'd fall all around us
People oh they look so well
And then you said little darling won't
You focus on your girl

I need to focus on the words you said
We're not the centre of universe
Just little bugs that's it
But it's burning me up like I knew it would
Guess it's burning me up and
It's all over again

I never loved my body watching all the rest
And then I'd took in every mirror honey
Falling in despair
Yes then I'd fall all around us
People oh they look so well
And then you said little darling won't
You focus on your girl
