		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A new day has come
A new day has come

I was waiting for so long
For a miracle to come
Everyone told me to be strong
Hold on and don't shed a tear

Through the darkness and good times
I knew I'd make it through
And the world thought I had it all
But I was waiting for you

Hush, now
I see a light in the sky
Oh, it's almost blinding me
I can't believe I've been touched by an angel with love

Let the rain come down and wash away my tears
Let it fill my soul and drown my fears (drown my fears)
Let it shatter the walls for a new sun
A new day has come
A new day has come

Where it was dark, now there's light
Where there was pain, now there's joy
Where there was weakness, I found my strength
All in the eyes of a boy

Hush, now
I see a light in the sky
Oh, it's almost blinding me
I can't believe I've been touched by an angel with love

Let the rain come down and wash away my tears
Let it fill my soul and drown my fears (and drown my fears)
Let it shatter the walls for a new sun
A new day has come
A new day has come

Let the rain come down and wash away my tears
Let it fill my soul and drown my fears (and drown my fears)
Let it shatter the walls for a new sun
A new day has come
A new day has come

Hush, now
I see a light in your eyes
All in the eyes of a boy (a new day)
I can't believe I've been touched by an angel with love (a new day)
I can't believe I've been touched by an angel with love (a new day, a new day)
Hush, now (a new day)
Let the rain come down (a new day)
Let the rain come down
