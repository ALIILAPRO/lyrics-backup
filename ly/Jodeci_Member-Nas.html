		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ta-da-da-da
Ta-da-da-da
Ta-da-da-da
Like a nigga theme music uh
Uh

I flex, I found someone she text account number, no sex
I bounced on her, not yet
But while summer, I bet
I get my next child from her
Have a baby by me playin' as loud as I wanna
My checks, they pile, runneth over
Older guys be mad like I stole their lives
Some of these young boys tight like I had their wives
Realize that's not real, it's only in your mind
The real recognize real type of time
Real man ain't supposed to be in his feelings, that's a crime
Half the time I pay attention to all these rappers lyin'
Real men, ain't 'posed to be postin' up all the time
I take somethin' you slept on and make it mine
I hit the party scene, they thought I was DeVante Swing
My introduction to that name, they thought I was a Jodeci member
Now when I stroll through the center, I'm lookin' more like the owner
Opposed to a beginner, she need to try the winner
Vibes only, uh

Try me like new shoes, try me like new clothes
A color you never wore
Try me like vegan food, I'll show you what we can do
So you ain't sad no more, a love you ain't had before
Try me, try me, try me
I'll show you, I'll show you, show you

Keep twenties on you, not hundreds, you spend less
A balanced like a one-wheel unicyclist uphill
Inclining up the Eiffel and shit
One lady told me cut my hair, one lady likin' my twists
One shawty said that I should put her on a cypher to hit
Any time I feel, instead I said, she can sell natural diet pills
With an acquired skill, she might hit a lick
Put a fine girl in the studio, you might get a hit
They just like us, snipers, who the slickest, quickest
It's a cycle, try us, it's the beginnin'
Witness the good dude who wouldn't try enough
Gang could've had it all
Denim and leather, no bike club but tatted arms
Try me like stayin' off your phone with some real shit goin' on
Try me like some threads in the fittin' room
Try me like puttin' new art on the wall in the living room
Saturday morning vacuum tryin' out a new rap tune
Vibes only, uh

Try me like new shoes, try me like new clothes
A color you never wore
Try me like vegan food, I'll show you what we can do
So you ain't sad no more, I love you ain't had before
Try me, try me, try me
I'll show you, I'll show you, show you
