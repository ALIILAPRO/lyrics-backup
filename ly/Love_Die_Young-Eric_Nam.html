		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What happens when it's over
When we've breathed our last breath
And we've loved each other to death
Can you tell me what happens?

I wonder where the love goes
When pleasure turns to pain
When the memories fade away
Can you tell me what happens?

Flowers in your hair now on our grave
A little bit of pressure's all it takes
Shoulda known we'd shatter that we'd break, break (oh oh)

Maybe I'm the one that we should blame
For never thinking we'd end up this way
I don't need answers I need you to stay, stay

Please don't let this love die young
Please don't let this love die young
If I'm gonna lose someone
Don't let it be you
Please don't let this love die young
Please don't let this love die young
If I'm gonna love someone
Then let it be you

In my dreams we're growing older
But I wake up to the truth
That I'm scared we're gonna lose
Tell me it won't happen

So before it's really over
Can we have a little faith
Baby say it ain't too late
It's all that I'm asking

Maybe I'm the one that we should blame
For never thinking we'd end up this way
I don't need answers I need you to stay, stay

Please don't let this love die young
Please don't let this love die young
If I'm gonna lose someone
Don't let it be you
Please don't let this love die young
Please don't let this love die young
If I'm gonna love someone
Then let it be you

Please don't let it die
Please don't let it die
Please don't let it die young (oh)

Flowers in your hair now on our grave
A little bit of pressure's all it takes
Shoulda known we'd shatter, that we'd break

Please don't let this love die young
Please don't let this love die young
If I'm gonna lose someone
Don't let it be you
Please don't let this love die young
Please don't let this love die young
If I'm gonna love someone
Then let it be you
