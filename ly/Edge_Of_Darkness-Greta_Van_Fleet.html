		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Every day is a new day
Every way is a new way
On the edge of darkness
Finding out what it means to love
And to think we've found the time

All my brothers we stand
For the peace of the land
Is there meaning?
I've got love in my heart
For an army apart I am bleeding 

All my brothers we stand
For the peace of the land
Is there meaning?
I've got love in my heart
For army apart I'm bleeding 

Always searching for love
Always searching for light
What the world is made of
When I'm thinking it's right
And to think we've found the time

All my brothers we stand
For the peace of the land
Is there meaning?
I've got love in my heart
For army apart I'm bleeding 

All my brothers we stand
For the peace of the land
Is there meaning?
I've got love in my heart
For army apart I'm bleeding 
 
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

I've got love in my heart
For army apart I am bleeding

All my brothers we stand
For the peace of the land
Is there meaning?
I've got love in my heart
For army apart I am bleeding

Is there meaning?
All my brothers we stand
For the peace of the land

All my brothers we stand
For the peace of the land
I'm bleeding
