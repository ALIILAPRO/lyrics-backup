		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Something came from nothing today
While I was saying no

Well don't you knock on my door
I can't answer you anymore

Absence makes the heart grow fond
Of staying away from people

It was a question before
But I can't answer you anymore

Skipped to the scene where we meet
And wrote a song
I did everything right for somebody that
Does everything wrong

So I go from coast to coast
Over the Hawthorn Bridge

To the one I adore
You asked me what I'm looking for
But I can't answer you anymore
No, I can't answer you anymore
