		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Cross my heart and hope to die
I don't need another guy
To fight my battles, to overshadow me
Don't ya know I'm dangerous?
Fire burnin' in my blood
I got this handled, I don't need rescuin'

You can call me a princess all you like
'Cause you love to keep me helpless by your side
But that ain't what I want, I'ma show you
I'ma show you

How to treat me like a queen (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Boy, you better bow down on your knees
Can I get a "Yes, your majesty"?
So treat me like a queen (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Boy, you better bow down on your knees
Can I get a "Yes, your majesty"?

Eyes on me like I'm a prize
But you better recognize
I'm not your angel 'cause I belong to me

You can call me a princess all you like
'Cause you love to keep me helpless by your side
But that ain't what I want, I'ma show you
I'ma show you

How to treat me like a queen (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Boy, you better bow down on your knees
Can I get a "Yes, your majesty"?
So treat me like a queen (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Boy, you better bow down on your knees
Can I get a "Yes, your majesty"?

Yeah
You can call me a princess all you like
'Cause you love to keep me helpless by your side
But that ain't what I want, I'ma show you

How to treat me like a queen (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Boy, you better bow down on your knees
Can I get a "Yes, your majesty"?
So treat me like a queen (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Boy, you better bow down on your knees
Can I get a "Yes, your majesty"?
