		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (One, two)

Where do I begin, I can't explain it
Know you wasted (20 plus years, like)
Photos fadin' in, I see 'em changin'
All the faces (waitin' up all night)

Seein' red flags in the mornin'
It's a warnin', a warnin' (it's a sure sign)
Where do I begin, I can't explain it
Now you're wasted

How could you let them do this to you?

How could you let them turn you into a monster?
Your bridge started to burn when you ran all across it
I guess you never learn 'til you live and you lost it
Live and you lost it

How could you let them turn you into a monster?
Your bridge started to burn when you ran all across it
I guess you never learn 'til you live and you lost it
Live and you lost it

Goin' on a whim, try to erase it
Leavin' traces (sweat, blood and tears dry)
Your head on the pavement, know you're jaded
Sick of playin' (waitin' up all night)

Throwin' white flags in the mornin'
It's a warnin', a warnin' (it's a sure fire)
Goin' on a whim, try to erase it
All the traces

How could you let them do this to you?

How could you let them turn you into a monster?
Your bridge started to burn when you ran all across it
I guess you never learn 'til you live and you lost it
Live and you lost it

How could you let them turn you into a monster?
Your bridge started to burn when you ran all across it
I guess you never learn 'til you live and you lost it
Live and you lost it

Monster
In your blood on a cold night, monster
It's a curse, it's a sure sign
Monster
In your blood on a cold night, monster
It's a curse, it's a sure sign
Monster
In your blood on a cold night, monster
It's a curse, it's a sure sign
Monster
In your blood on a cold night, monster
It's a curse

How could you let them do this to you?

How could you let them turn you into a monster?
Your bridge started to burn when you ran all across it
I guess you never learn 'til you live and you lost it
Live and you lost it

How could you let them turn you into a monster?
Your bridge started to burn when you ran all across it
I guess you never learn 'til you live and you lost it
Live and you lost it
