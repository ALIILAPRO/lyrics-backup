		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What you know 'bout a double four?
What you know 'bout Rambo's twinnin'?
Yo
Mm-hmm
Yo

Gyal from North London (uh-uh)
Gyal from East London (uh-uh)
Gyal from West London (uh-uh)
Gyal from South London (uh-uh)
That gyal wan' shock
One eye on her arse like, "Holy fuck"
Look at the arch, you know I buss
Back up the arse like (uh-uh)

What you know 'bout a double four? (What you know?)
What you know 'bout Rambo's twinnin'? (Nuttin')
Slap that off, ching him, ching him (uh-uh)
Then my name start ringin' (start ringin')
Badness, I had it from young (me)
Them man act bad for the women (yes)
Do it, air out the linen (uh-uh)
Why you think GB's stay winnin'? (GB's)
I was out there tryna shake him down (yes)
Still tell a bad one, "Shake it down"
This music ting's kinda takin' off
I'm soon gon' make it out (facts)
Nigga, I don't do this shit for the clout (no)
My yardie one made better than my Naija one
Cah she makes it bounce

Made a half a mill last quarter
But I still swing my borer (swing it)
And if me and my G's got beef
Then we're to doing violent disorder (mm-hmm)
They say my name but I ain't take a L
How come we ain't never get touch in the jail? (Mm-hmm)
I like Beyonce, I like beef in a cell
Man get roll on, I ain't leave no shells
Like, I can never go back starvin'
Original Edmonton boy just chartin' (boom)
Beat that firearm case, no chargin'
I ain't into internet beef or tarkin' (bow, bow)
So much girl on a army
Someone fuckin' a party (party)
Boxers, Berto Cavalli (mm-hmm)
Box man up for my chargy

Gyal from North London, yuh mad (uh-uh)
Gyal from East London, yuh mad (uh-uh)
Gyal from West London, she bad (uh-uh)
Gyal from South London, she bad (uh-uh)
That gyal wan' shock
One eye on her arse like, "Holy fuck"
Look at the arch, you know I buss
Back up the arse like, "Holy fuck"

It was always us that done that first
I defo spun it (skrr)
Beef, we won it
I swear I had my man's shawty cumin' (cumin')
Gyal just wanna party with us (facts)
She's even tryna get her mum in (mum in)
(Meanwhile) meanwhile, bro's tryna get that drummin' (uh)

Her arse so fat, look tricky (mine)
Sticky, been a bad boy like Diddy (mm-hmm)
Whizzy, might drive but you look silly
Used to have ye in the crib like Kimmy (bow-bow-bow)

Ye in the crib like Kimmy
Wrap that up like I'm wearin' a jimmy
She can pass cah she ain't too skinny
Chingy, I was out there gettin' chingy

I fuck your girl from the back (ayy)
I put my block on the map (uh-huh)
She fell in love with a gangster (gangster)
She fall in love when I rap (bow, bow)
All of the Bristol girl (mad)
All of the Midlands girl
All of the England girl
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, yo

Gyal from North London, yuh mad (uh-uh)
Gyal from East London, yuh mad (uh-uh)
Gyal from West London, she bad (uh-uh)
Gyal from South London, she bad (uh-uh)
That gyal wan' shock
One eye on her arse like, "Holy fuck"
Look at the arch, you know I buss
Back up the arse like, "Holy fuck"

Gyal from North London (uh-uh)
Gyal from East London (uh-uh)
Gyal from West London (uh-uh)
Gyal from South London (uh-uh)
That gyal wan' shock
One eye on her arse like, "Holy fuck"
Look at the arch, you know I buss
Back up the arse like (uh)
