		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Peer into circles the wind on my cheek
Making new shapes in the star sing mold
Making ruts with translucent feet
Peering into circles the wind on my cheek

(But we should, should, should)
I won't get to see you
(But we should, should, should)
I won't get to see you
(But we should, should, should)
I won't get to see you
(But we should, should, should)
(But we should, should, should)
I won't get to see you
(But we should, should, should)
I know what the date would be
I won't get to see you
(But we should, should, should)
I don't get to see you
(But we should, should, should)
I won't get to see you
(But we should, should, should)
Now who would you take with me?

I don't get to see you
I don't get to see you
I don't get to see you
I don't get to see you decide on

But we should, should, should
But we should, should, should
But we should, should, should
But we should, should, should

I won't get to see you
(Can we should, should, should)
I won't get to see you
(Can wе should, should, should)
I won't get to see you
(Can we should, should, should)
I won't get to see you
(Can wе should, should, should)
Now who would you take to see?

Peering into circles the window matching
Making new shapes with the star sing mold
Making ruts with translucent feet
Peering into circles the window matching
