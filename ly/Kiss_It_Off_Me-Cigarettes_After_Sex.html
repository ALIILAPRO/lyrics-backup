		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Saw you on the side of the road
I could see you walkin' slow
Drinkin' a Slurpee
In a peach baseball cap
Fallin' in my lap
You were so thirsty

Could you love me instead
Of all the boyfriends you got?
Know I make you forget
About all of those rich fuckboys

Kiss it off me
If you're gonna break my heart
This is a good start
Kiss it off me

You always bite your lip
When you're feelin' it
As we move slowly
And your peach baseball cap
Is tossed under the rack
Of clothes and your jewelry

And you beg for it
In the morning again
Before you go to the gym 
Said it's a bad habit
You just can't quit

Kiss it off me
If you're gonna break my heart
This is a good start
Kiss it off me

Kiss it off me
If you're gonna break my heart
This is a good start
Kiss it off me
If you're gonna break my heart
This is a good start
Kiss it off me
