		<p>
		  Yeah (yeah)
That's how you had it, yeah
Pretty sure
It is, it's goes clapping a bit (so interesting that way)
Alright, here we go
Gonna go an octave down this time

I'm writing the future
I'm writing it out, loud
We don't talk about the past
We don't talk about the past, now

So I'm writing the future
I'm leaving a key here
Something won't always be missing
It won't always feel emptier

Just think of the future
And think of your dreams
You'll get away from here
You'll get away eventually

So just think of your future
Think of a new life
Don't get lost in the memories
Keep your eyes on a new prize
