		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now that you're gone
It's been a long, lonely time
It's a long, sad, lonely time
Rollin' along
I'm in a strange state of mind
It's a strange old state of mind

Memories, they mess with my mind
Who am I to deny?

She was so good at being in trouble
So good at being in trouble
So good at being in trouble
So good at being in trouble
So good at being in trouble
So good at being in trouble
So good at being in trouble
So bad at being in love

Now that you're gone
It's been a long, lonely time
It's a long, sad, lonely time
Rollin' along
I'm in a strange state of mind
It's a strange old state of mind

Memories, they mess with my mind
Who am I to deny?

She was so good at being in trouble
So good at being in trouble
So good at being in trouble
So good at being in trouble
So good at being in trouble
So good at being in trouble
So good at being in trouble
So bad at being in love
