		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't open I'm dead inside
Disappear into the night I'm dead inside
An open wound, the feeling makes me feel alright
My body's crying, the face I hide I'm ashamed to find
I stand alone, while the demons find a place to call home
They're in my head they're in my head
I tried to run but hide instead
They're in my head they're in my head
I tried to run but hide instead
In this nightmare, nowhere to find me
You're passing by me, do you like what you see?
Do you like what you see?
Do you like what you see?
Pull me down, I feel like it's taking over
Pull me down, don't open I'm dead inside (I'm dead inside)
Don't open I'm dead inside
Oh
I'm just here
Towards the grave
God save me
Take from me my sins
Desecration (traitor)
Face it (face it)
Face it, now leave me the fuck alone
Face it, face it, face it, yeah
Pull me down, I feel like it's taking over (it's taking over)
Pull me down, don't open I'm dead inside (I'm dead inside)
Disappointment will not set me free
Disappointment will not set me free
Lies, traitor, anguish, fear
Lies, traitor, anguish, fear
Where am I?
This isn't where I wanted to be
The door's locked tight
And so am I
Set me free, please
This feeling still haunts me
I can't escape, I can't escape
I can't escape the pain
I feel like I'm dying
Help me save
Help me save
Help me save myself
