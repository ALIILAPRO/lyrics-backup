		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You know, you know all the ways that life can test you
You know I, I, I, I
I am with the spirit of the mother and father's son
Tryna be a beacon of each other
Love everyone

Falling into memories of Anunnaki dreams
Falling over ley lines and sacred geometry
Ooh-wee, ooh-wee
Falling into memories of Anunnaki dreams
Falling over ley lines and sacred geometry

You know
You know all the ways that life can
Test you

I'm hopping out on top now
I talk slow when I'm in the room
The drama got crossed out
We in the ocean with the vision of the swimming pool, a wave
Talking of digits, I handle my business
Botanical wrist when I throw up
Make everything golden
I'm a magician, they know it
I'm in the kitchen, they know it
These young boys snoring
I'm 'bout to get 'em up going
Up early in the morning

Ancient secrets on me, on the beach for the week
They'd hurt they feet tryna dance like me
Ancient secrets on me, on the beach for the week
They'd hurt they feet tryna dance like me
Ancient secrets on me, on the beach for the week
(You know, you know all the ways that life can test you)
They'd hurt they feet tryna dance like me
Ancient secrets on me, on the beach for the week
They'd hurt they feet tryna dance like me
Ancient secrets on me, on the beach for the week
They'd hurt they feet tryna dance like me (test you)
Ancient secrets on me, on the beach for the week
They'd hurt they feet tryna dance like me
