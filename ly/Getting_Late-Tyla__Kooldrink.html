		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby, I know it's getting late

Baby and I want you to know

Baby, I know it's getting late
And you don't want to wait
But I won't waste your time and I
Baby and I want you to know
Without me you don't go
So I'ma take my time and I

All I wanna ask is 

All I wanna ask is 

All I wanna ask is 

All I wanna ask is 

Baby, I know it's getting late
And you don't want to wait
But I won't waste your time and I
Maybe, I want you to know
That I won't let you go
And I won't waste your time and I

You give me life, no gravity, you fly
For you baby, I will stop the hands of time
Relax baby, gimme time and then we'll go
Couldn't call to let you know
That I'ma be a while

Baby, I know it's getting late
And you don't want to wait
But I won't waste your time and I
Baby and I want you to know
Without me you don't go
So I'ma take my time and I 

All I wanna ask is 
But I won't waste your time

All I wanna ask is 

All I wanna ask is 

All I wanna ask is 

All I wanna ask is 

Baby, I know it's getting late
And you don't want to wait
But I won't waste your time and I
Maybe, I want you to know
That I won't let you go
But I won't waste your time and I

All I wanna ask is
All I wanna ask is
