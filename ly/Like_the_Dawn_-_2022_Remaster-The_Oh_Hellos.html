		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was sleeping in the garden when I saw you first
He'd put me deep, deep under so that he could work
And like the dawn you broke the dark and my whole earth shook
I was sleeping in the garden when I saw you

At last, at last
Bones of my bones and flesh of my flesh, at last

You were the brightest shade of sun I had ever seen
Your skin was gilded with the gold of the richest kings
And like the dawn you woke the world inside of me
You were the brightest shade of sun when I saw you

At last, and you will surely be the death of me
But how could I have known?

I was sleeping in the garden (oh oh)
I can show you 
I was sleeping in the garden ? (oh oh)
