		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Play me a tune 
I know it’s gonna hit 
Play me your groove
and with you The world is grooving 
Play me a tune 
Play me your music 
Play me a hit 
And watch us get stupid 

said Shut up and dance
Said shut up 
And Shake that ass 
Got hella cash 
Her ass is  dropping bands 
Im feelin bad 
Whats next ,We do the thriller Dance
On triller banned 
That pussy flashing
All her fans 


Play me a tune 
I know it’s gonna hit 
Play me your groove
and with you The world is grooving 
Play me a tune 
Play me your music 
Play me a hit 
and watch us get stupid


Get crazy 
Watch her get her crazy 
The star of the show 
is my baby 


Get crazy 
Watch her get 
Get crazy 
She fuck on herself 
On a daily 



Don’t watch That 
No nigga 
Don’t  watch that 
No 
Don’t watch that 
No nigga

Don’t watch that 
No 
Don’t watch that 
No nigga 
Don’t watch that 
No 
Don’t watch that 
No Nigga 
I’m all that 

Play me a tune 
I know it’s gonna hit 
Play me your groove
and with you The world is grooving 
Play me a tune 
Play me your music 
Play me a hit 
And watch us get stupid 

 
Don’t watch That 
No nigga 
Don’t  watch that 
No 
Don’t watch that 
No nigga

Don’t watch that 
No 
Don’t watch that 
No nigga 
Don’t watch that 
No 
Don’t watch that 
No Nigga 
I’m all that
