		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Something told me it was over
When I saw you and her talking
Something deep down in my soul said to cry, girl
When I saw you and that girl walking around

Ooh, I would rather, I would rather go blind, boy
Than to see you walk away from me, child and all

I was just, I was just, I was just sitting here thinking
Of your kiss and your warm embrace
When the reflection in the glass that I held to my lips, now baby
Revealed these tears that are on my face

And baby, and baby, I'd rather be blind, boy
Than to see you walk away, walk away from me, yeah
And baby, and baby, I'd rather be blind, boy
Than to see you walk away, walk away from me

Something told me it was over
When I saw you and her talking
