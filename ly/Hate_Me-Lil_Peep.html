		  But I know I wanna take you
Leave you alone, ayy
Hello

I don't really know where I'm tryna go but I know I wanna take you, yeah
When I'm on the road and I leave you alone, I just pray I don't break you, yeah
I was on the phone with her in the other room, not tryna wake you, yeah
When I'm on my own I will be sipping Patron trying to blame you, yeah

Now you're calling me crazy, girl I know
When you tell me you hate me (yeah), I know that you don't
Now you're calling me crazy (ayy), girl I know, girl I know
When you tell me you hate me (ayy), I know that you don't

I would give it all back for you right now, I could never forget you
Runaway from me, try to runway, but I ain't gonna let you (gonna let you)
And I can hear my heartbeat sounding like the bass drum
I said baby don't stall with the fuckin' and the makeups
Nah, I'ma take the long way home
Got a couple hunnid missed calls in my phone

Now you're calling me crazy, girl I know
When you tell me you hate me (yeah), I know that you don't
Now you're calling me crazy (ayy), girl I know, girl I know
When you tell me you hate me (ayy), I know that you don't

But when you tell me that you love me
I put trust in you, don't judge me
I'm just going through some shit right now
And I don't wanna let you down
I don't wanna let you down
No, I just wanna to leave this town
Sometimes I feel like everyone hates me

Now you're calling me crazy, girl I know
When you tell me you hate me (yeah), I know that you don't
Now you're calling me crazy (ayy), girl I know, girl I know
When you tell me you hate me (ayy), I know that you don't
