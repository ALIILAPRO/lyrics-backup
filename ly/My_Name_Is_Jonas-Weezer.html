		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My name is Jonas
I'm carryin' the wheel
Thanks for all you've shown us
But this is how we feel

Come sit next to me
Pour yourself some tea
Just like grandma made
When we couldn't find sleep
Things were better then
Once but never again
We've all left the den
Let me tell you 'bout it

The choo-choo train left right on time
A ticket costs only your mind
The driver said, "Hey man, we go all the way"
Of course we were willing to pay

My name is Wepeel
Got a box full of your toys
They're fresh out of batteries
But they're still making noise, making noise

Tell me what to do
Now the tank is dry
Now this wheel is flat
And you know what else?
Guess what I received
In the mail today
Words of deep concern
From my little brother

The building's not going as he planned
The foreman has injured his hand
The dozer will not clear a path
The driver swears he learned his math

The workers are going home
The workers are going home
The workers are going home
The workers are going home
Yeah

The workers are going home
The workers are going home
The workers are going home
Yeah, yeah, yeah

My name is Jonas
