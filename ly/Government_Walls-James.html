		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Break down the government walls
Speak in tongues, power is money
I see our interests fall
Well behind their curtain
Break down the government walls
Infiltrate our television
Break down the government walls
Time to be outspoken


I can hear the sound of falling masonry
As they try to plug that leak
I am tempted by their cloak of secrecy
To find out what their games are about
Ask a question and they'll talk of secret services
Secrets from the people they should serve
When they can hide their crimes in a legal disguise
Truth will not be seen nor heard


In ireland they may shoot to kill without
Warning you
Or lock you away for a while without trial
And if an honest cop gets to close to the
Truth of it
They'll set him up in style in style
In china, they murder
Their youth
Who are questioning
How their lives are controlled
Do they have the means to rewrite history
Wipe out the genes of doubt


Bring down the government walls
Bring them down within my lifetime
Let's see the curtain drawn
See what they are concealing
Bring down the government walls
Crime to be outspoken
It's a crime to be outspoken
