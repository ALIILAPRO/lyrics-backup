		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Okay (yeah)
It's about that time again (haha)
Green Lantern
That's right
G-G-G-G-G Unit
(Shit)
Shady
We back (Invasion)
Part two
The Conspiracy

'Cause we ain't gonna never stop
You just keep wasting your energy on us
You should find something to do with your time, time
And quit fucking with us 'cause we ain't fucking with you
And we must be fucking with you
So much you must be goin' out your mind (yeah, Shady Records Mixtape)
(Come on, Em)

They say I'm day away from my entire empire crumbling
Speak up your mumbling
What the fuck-a you's a bibi-bay okay big-bi-bi-baby
This is Shady I know you was
Bi-bi-hoping we be-be-would ge-go away
But weeble mable weeble wobble
But we don't fall down like
Jam Master Jay's two turn tables
Our label's just too stable
Your magazine so motherfucking thin
You using staples to hold it together
It's turning back into a newspaper
And y'all got something for my ass every issue
Thank you, 'cause I keep running out of fucking tissues
And not to diss you but God, I was sick of looking at you
At least now I can see when Nike's got a new tennis shoe
But-but I guess no good news is always good good news
Moving on to bigger and better things, chicka chicka jeera
50's blowing up, his shit just keeps going up
What the fuck is going on? Who the fuck is Norah Jones?
Shady, wait a minute, baby, leave the whore alone
Just go up there and be humble and take them awards home
Bush has just declared the world a fucking warzone
And meanwhile we got a war going on of our own at home
My fucking mind's blown
Tryna figure out how to fight my own clone
Rhinestones are so nice, they shine so bright
Especially at night after a hit of ecstasy, ain't that right?
Whoa, wait a minute, I'm rambling
Back to the matter at hand, it's Green Lantern
With Elvis Presley, the selfish MC
Back to ruin rap and destroy the industry
Single handedly and, oh man, did we
Yeah me and 50, Obie, me and Twizzy
And Nelly and Missy and Jigga
God damn, it's all a plan devised by the Man, it's a conspiracy
Against fake shit, and anybody who can't make hits or ain't dope lyrically
So fuck what you heard and what you read about
We ain't ruining rap, baby, we're just trying to weed it out
Shady in the place to be see
And I got what it takes to rock the mic right
Still keep talking shit to me punk
'Cause your magazine's over in less than six months

Haha
Shady Records
Still Aftermath
And don't think we can hear you motherfuckers talking
'Cause we can't
We don't hear y'all
So we just gonna sit back for the rest of our lives
While you ride our dicks
