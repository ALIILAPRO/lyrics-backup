		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Every day she tells her daughter
"Baby, you're not just a pretty face"
She says "you gotta work much harder
Than every single man, that's just the way"

But she goes to the same job everyday
She's overworked and underpaid
Just 'cause the way her body's made
Ain't that insane?

If you never been told how you gotta be
What you gotta wear, how you gotta speak
If you never shouted to be heard
You ain't lived in a woman's world
And if you can't see that it's gotta change
Only want the body and not the brains
If you think that's the way it works
You ain't lived in a woman's world, no

Try living, try try living
Try living, try try living
Try living in a woman's world

Every night she tells her daughter
"Don't you know a change is gonna come?"
There's a whisper in the water
And I know the tide is gonna turn
No, no, no

But she goes to the same job everyday
She's overworked and underpaid
Just 'cause the way her body's made
Ain't that insane?

If you never been told how you gotta be
What you gotta wear, how you gotta speak
If you never shouted to be heard
You ain't lived in a woman's world
And if you can't see that it's gotta change
Only want the body but not the brains
If you really think that's the way it works
You ain't lived in a woman's world

Just look at how far that we've got
And don't think that we'll ever stop
This ain't the way it's gonna be
No, this ain't the way it's got to be
Know that there will be a day
When everyone's treated the same
It's the only way it's gotta be
It's the one way it's gotta be, yeah

If you never been told how you gotta be
What you gotta wear, how you gotta speak
Never shouted to be heard
You ain't lived in a woman's world
And if you can't see that it's gotta change
Only want the body but not the brains
If you think that's the way it works
You ain't lived in a woman's world, no

Try living, try try living
Try living, try try living in a woman's world
(A woman's world)
Try living, try try living
Try living, try try living in a woman's world
(A woman's world)
Try living, try try living
You got to try
Try living, try try living in a woman's, a woman's world
