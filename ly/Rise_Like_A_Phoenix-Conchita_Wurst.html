		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Waking in the rubble
Walking over glass
Neighbors say we're trouble
Well that time has passed

Peering from the mirror
No, that isn't me
Stranger getting nearer
Who can this person be

You wouldn't know me at all today from the fading light I fly

Rise like a phoenix
Out of the ashes seeking rather than vengeance
Retribution you were warned
Once I'm transformed
Once I'm reborn
You know I will rise like a phoenix
But you're my flame

Go about your business
Act as if you're free
No one could have witnessed
What you did to me

'Cause you wouldn't know me today
And you have got to see
To believe
From the fading light I fly

Rise like a phoenix 
Out of the ashes seeking rather than vengeance
Retribution, you were warned
Once I'm transformed
Once I'm reborn

I rise up to the sky
You threw me down but
I'm gonna fly

And rise like a phoenix
Out of the ashes seeking rather than vengeance
Retribution you were warned
Once I'm transformed
Once I'm reborn
You know I will rise like a phoenix
But you're my flame
