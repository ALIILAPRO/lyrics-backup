		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You and me, we come from different worlds
You like to laugh at me when I look at other girls
Sometimes you're crazy and you wonder why
I'm such a baby 'cause the Cowboys make me cry

But there's nothin' I can do
I've been lookin' for a girl like you

You look at me, you got nothin' left to say
I'm gonna pout at you until I get my way
I won't dance and you won't sing
I just wanna love you but you wanna wear my ring

But there's nothin' I can do
I only wanna be with you
You can call me your fool
I only wanna be with you

Put on a little Dylan, sittin' on a fence
I say that line is great, you asked me what it meant by
Said I shot a man named Gray, took his wife to Italy
She inherited a million bucks and when she died, it came to me

I can't help it if I'm lucky
I only wanna be with you
Ain't Bobby so cool?
I only wanna be with you

Yeah, I'm tangled up in blue
I only wanna be with you
You can call me your fool
I only wanna be with you

Sometimes I wonder if it'll ever end
You get so mad at me when I go out with my friends
Sometimes you're crazy and you wonder why
I'm such a baby, yeah, the Cowboys make me cry

But there's nothin' I can do
I only wanna be with you
You can call me your fool
I only wanna be with you

Yeah, I'm tangled up in blue
I only wanna be with you
(I only wanna be with you)
I only wanna be with you

(I only wanna be with you)
I only wanna be with you
