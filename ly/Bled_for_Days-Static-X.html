		  Meaningless
It's meaningless [Repeat: x3]

I take the hold [Repeat: x4]

Mindlessness
It's mindlessness [Repeat: x3]

I bled for days [Repeat: x4]

[Chorus: x2]
Get to the race (hate)
The healing of it ing with
Conceal the scab you don't want to show (fate)
Into the hate (no)
I channel all the negative and (break)
I bled for days now I take the hold, go!

I don't believe it
Fuck me, read me, get me (bled for days)
Smile on my rage I'm
Scarred by age, I bled (bled for days)

Uselessness
It's uselessness [Repeat: x3]

Make my weapons [Repeat: x3]
Take the hold

I don't believe it
Fuck me, read me, get me (bled for days)
Smile on my rage I'm
Scarred by age, I bled (bled for days)

I don't believe it
Fuck me, read me, get me (bled for days)
Smile on my rage I'm
Scarred by age, I bled (bled for days)

Bled for days
Bled for days

[Chorus: x2]
