		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ye-eeees, the moon a-risin'.
And the sun is sinkin' low.
I can't find my baby.
Wonder, where in the world did the woman go?
You can talk about my baby.
Say a-just what you please.
She's my baby.
Lord, an I don't care what she do.
She will be my baby, until her dyin' day.
Ye-eeees, I love that woman.
An I just can't help myself.
She the only woman, people.
Yes, I ever loved.
Yes, Lord have mercy.

[Guitar solo]

Ye-eeees, she know I love her.
The way she treat me.
Lord have mercy, way she do.
Yes, I love you, baby-ee.
Don't care what you do.
