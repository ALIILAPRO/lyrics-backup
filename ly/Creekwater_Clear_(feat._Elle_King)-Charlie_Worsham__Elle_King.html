		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Between the moccasins, the skeeters and the gators
Old tires and rusted out refrigerators
You'd think it's a wonder I made it out alive, yeah
I learned to watch my step and how to swim there
My first fish and my first beer's still buried in there
Along with the all the where I'm from, I grew up and left behind

Ain't it funny how you gotta leave home sometimes to find it
My rambling liked to sink me like a stone
The world don't often look like the Lord designed it
Turns out it was under them bare feet all along
Somewhere in the mud and kudzu vines
The suns still shines brighter in my memory there than it does here
Lookin' back into that delta, flat, Mississippi mirror
I see it all creek water clear

If I said today I'm good, I'd be a liar
'Cause that something's missing sticks me like a briar
It's been so long since I've been back, so long I can't believe
So with a six-pack, some crickets and a cane pole
I'm headed down where that muddy water flows
If I could only find myself this time, I may never leave

Ain't it funny how you gotta leave home sometimes to find it
My rambling liked to sink me like a stone
The world don't often look like the Lord designed it
Turns out it was under them bare feet all along
Somewhere in the mud and kudzu vines
The suns still shines brighter in my memory there than it does here
Lookin' back into that delta, flat, Mississippi mirror
I see it all creek water clear

Down under them roots in the banks in between
It might look dirty but it'll wash you clean

Ain't it funny how you gotta leave home sometimes to find it
My rambling liked to sink me like a stone
The world don't often look like the Lord designed it
Turns out it was under them bare feet all along
Somewhere in the mud and kudzu vines
The suns still shines brighter in my memory there than it does here
Lookin' back into that delta, flat, Mississippi mirror
I see it all creek water clear
