		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sally, you opened out your arms 
to all those young men
And girl you had room
For every one of them
You're the only girl
on Bowery and Third
Sure as hell
You're the only one who cares

So put your hands together for Sally
She saved all those young men
Put your hands together for Sally
She's the one who cared for them

She's doing our dirty work
She's the only one who can
Doing our dirty work, thirsty world
One angry day in New York

Take a look at Dave he was once seventeen
Zoot suit and shiny shoes
He ran around town and through his mentholated laughter
Most of his memories drowned
But he remembers what his mother used to shout
She used to shout
"One day, surely son
The streets are gonna tire you out"

So put your hands together for Sally
She's the one who cared for him
Put your hands together for Sally
She was there when his luck was running thin

She's doing our dirty work
She's the only one who can
Doing our dirty work, thirsty world
One angry day in New York

Tommy had a wife and family
But the needle came between the love and the hard times
Thank God for Sally
She was there through the misery
Just a place to lay his head
Just about better off than dead

She's doing our dirty work
She's the only one who can
Doing our dirty work, thirsty world
One angry day

Vince, came up from the country
Couldn't even find himself a room
Thinking about his babies
They're further away than the moon
With no money but his pride in his pocket
There's really no way he can go home
There's a picture of his woman in his locket
Most of all he doesn't want to be alone

put your hands together for Sally
She's the one who cared for him
Put your hands together for Sally
She was there when his luck was running thin

She's doing our dirty work
She's the only one who can
Doing our dirty work, thirsty world
One angry day in New York
