		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My soul's gettin' tired, always running from the law
My bruddas are gettin' by, we don't struggle any more
If you love me how you love me then love me a little more
If you love me how you love me then love me a little more
My soul's gettin' tired, always running from the law
My bruddas are gettin' by, we don't struggle any more
If you love me how you love me then love me a little more
If you love me how you love me then love me a little more

They might love you for an hour then they'll change in a minute
I need that love that's like a tower, don't hold back or be frigid
I had a dream that I got locked, you never came for a visit
People claim their loves eternal but I'm questioning is it
My diamonds Milly Rock
But they're on molly rock
This Scotti got me noddin' off
This shit is poppin' off
We make the beef a Stroganoff
Won't take another loss
I'm duckin' from these Babylon
I keep the battle on
Get home and stick the kettle on
Don't take my kettle off
My pagans wanna settle off
On God, you're better off
You switch, we turn the metal on
We make the weather strong
They try but they won't get along
Go make a better song

My soul's gettin' tired, always running from the law
My bruddas are gettin' by, we don't struggle any more
If you love me how you love me then love me a little more
If you love me how you love me then love me a little more
My soul's gettin' tired, always running from the law
My bruddas are gettin' by, we don't struggle any more
If you love me how you love me then love me a little more
If you love me how you love me then love me a little more

I keep my circle A1, it's tight, my niggas know what's best
Got God so we don't walk with a vest
My names Ch√©, the revolution leader from west
So I leveled up and got Guevara inked on my chest
And I'm from Trinidad
My fam are big and bad, get busy, we ain't kickin' back
Lick shots, we're lickin back
The oppers I ain't in to dat
Reload get rid of dat
It's New York on my fitted hat
We smoke Gorilla pack
And in the ends it pops off, parties get locked off
Barrels are lock stocked, cruisin' in a drop-top
I got a point to prove, that's for real
Changed how we do it, went platinum with no deal

My soul's gettin' tired, always running from the law
My bruddas are gettin' by, we don't struggle any more
If you love me how you love me then love me a little more
If you love me how you love me then love me a little more
My soul's gettin' tired, always running from the law
My bruddas are gettin' by, we don't struggle any more
If you love me how you love me then love me a little more
If you love me how you love me then love me a little more

(Yoz, what you tellin' me?)
