		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They wanna fight with me
I can see the fever in their eyes
I feel them circling
Swimming down my walls and up my spine
Trying hard to drag me down
Just below the surface now
Will I float or will I drown
Can you hear me screaming out
Somebody help me I’m losing my breath
I’m breathing I’m breathing I’m breathing to death
Somebody help me I’m losing my breath
Pull me out
Pull pull me out
Of deep water
I’m calling out
Calling out
From deep water
Down to the wire
In over my head
My lungs are tired
But it’s not over yet
Pull me out
Pull pull me out
Of deep water
Kindling
There’s still something burning deep inside
Set it free
Shooting up a flare into the sky
Fingertips are getting cold
Desperately hanging on
Depths are swallowing me whole
Trying not to look below
Somebody help me I’m losing my breath
I’m breathing I’m breathing I’m breathing to death
Somebody help me I’m losing my breath
Pull me out
Pull pull me out
Of deep water
I’m calling out
Calling out
From deep water
Down to the wire
In over my head
My lungs are tired
But it’s not over yet
Pull me out
Pull pull me out
Of deep water
Pull me out
Pull pull me out
Of deep water
I’m calling out
Calling out
From deep water
Pull me out
Pull pull me out
Of deep water
I’m calling out
Calling out
From deep water
Down to the wire
In over my head
My lungs are tired
But it’s not over yet
Pull me out
Pull pull me out
Of deep water
