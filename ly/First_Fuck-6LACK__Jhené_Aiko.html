		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (I bet you'll love me more after that first fuck)
(I bet you'll love me more after that first fuck)
(I bet you'll love me more after that-)

I bet you'll love me more after that first fuck
I bet you'll love me more after you hear, "Worst Luck"
I bet you'll love me more when I write you these songs
I bet you'll love me when I finally make it home, yeah

I'ma make it mine
Mine for the night
Got me pullin' on your hair
I'ma make it mine
Mine for the night
Got me pullin' on your hair

I bet you'll love me more after that first fuck
I bet you'll love me more after you get that first nut
I bet you'll love me more when I write you these songs
I bet you'll love me when I finally make it home

I'ma make you mine, mine
Got you pullin' on my hair
I'ma make you mine, mine
Got me pullin' on your hair

I bet you'll love me more after the first fuck
Bet I'll love you better than your first love
I bet I'll love you so much you forget the shit that had you worked up, yeah
I bet I'll love you more than I can say to you
Somethin' 'bout you makes me wanna lay with you
But only for the night

I'ma make you mine, mine
Got me pullin' on your hair (your hair, oh yeah)
I'ma make it mine
Mine for the night
Got me pullin' on your hair

I bet you'll love me more, I bet you'll love me more
I bet you'll love me more
I bet you'll love me more after that first fuck
I bet you'll love me more
I bet you'll love me more, ooh-oh, oh, oh, oh
