		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Read my lips
I'm into you
I'm into you
I can't resist
You're so hot (get me into the shade)
The spotlight's on
You take me to it
You like it and
Just the way that you dance
Just the way that you dance

(Yeah, yeah) Is enough to love you baby
(Yeah, yeah) Is enough to send me crazy
(Yeah, yeah) Such angelic motion
(Yeah, yeah) You know you're made in heaven

The way you walk
The rhythm when you're dancing
Every inch of you spells out desire
You're such a rush
The rush is never ending
Now, you got it, you're wow, wow, wow, wow
You got it, you're wow, wow, wow, wow

The more I try, I try to stop
The more I can feel my antenna just sensing you up
What can I do?
I'm into you
I'm into you
Love the way that you move
Just love the way that you move

(Yeah, yeah) Such angelic motion
(Yeah, yeah) You know you're made in heaven

The way you walk
The rhythm when you're dancing
Every inch of you spells out desire
You're such a rush
The rush is never ending
Now, you got it, you're wow, wow, wow, wow
You got it, you're wow, wow, wow, wow

W-woah ooh, ooh
W-woah ooh
W-woah ooh, ooh
W-woah ooh

The way you walk
The rhythm when you're dancing
Every inch of you spells out desire
You're such a rush
The rush is never ending
Now, you got it, you're wow, wow, wow, wow

The way you walk
The rhythm when you're dancing
Every inch of you spells out desire
You're such a rush
The rush is never ending
Now, you got it, you're wow, wow, wow, wow
You got it, you're wow, wow, wow, wow

Wow
