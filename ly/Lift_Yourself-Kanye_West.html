		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hard to see, ooh
The hang ups we have today
Said we need to strive for more liberty
Lift yourself upon your feet, let's get it on
Lift yourself up on your feet, let's get it on
Lift yourself upon your feet, let's get it on
Lift yourself upon your feet, let's get it on
Lift yourself upon your feet, let's get it on
Lift yourself upon your feet, let's get it on
Lift yourself upon your feet, let's get it on
The hang ups we have today
Said we need to strive for more liberty
Lift yourself upon your feet
Lift yourself upon your feet
Lift

Lift your, lift your, lift yourself
Lift, lift your, lift your, lift your, lift your, lift, lift
Hard to see, ooh
The hang ups we have today-ay-ay
But they don't really realize, though
This next verse, this next verse though
These bars
Watch this some shit, go

Poopy-di scoop
Scoop-diddy-whoop
Whoop-di-scoop-di-poop
Poop-di-scoopty
Scoopty-whoop
Whoopity-scoop, whoop-poop
Poop-diddy, whoop-scoop
Poop, poop
Scoop-diddy-whoop
Whoop-diddy-scoop
Whoop-diddy-scoop, poop
