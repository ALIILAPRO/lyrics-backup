		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What say you now?
The door is opening on your vigil
And I'm in my usual way
I save my breath, knowing what you're
Wanting me to say
I only love you when I'm down
You say that midnight opens its arms to me
Leaving you alone, and I fly so far away
Until the light blurs my vision
And I have nowhere to roam
I only love you when I'm down
And I only love you when I'm down
And I'm only near you when I'm gone
But one thing for you to keep in mind, you know
I'm down all the time

Well I know you're reaching out
And you need to feel my hand
You want to be understood, yeah well I understand
I know you hold precious little hope for me
And in your hapiness
I'm always drowning in my grief
And I only love you when I'm down
And I'm only near you when I'm gone
But one thing for you to keep in mind, you know
I'm down all the time
All the time, all the time, all the time
