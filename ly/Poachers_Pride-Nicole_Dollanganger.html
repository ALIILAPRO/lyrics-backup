		  I shot an angel with my father's rifle
I should have set it free, but I
I shot an angel with my father's rifle
I should have set it free, but I

I shot an angel with my father's rifle
I should have set it free, but I
I shot an angel with my father's rifle
I should have set it free, but I

I shot an angel with my father's rifle
I should have set it free, but I
I shot an angel with my father's rifle
I should have set it free, but I

I shot an angel with my father's rifle
I should have set it free, but I
I shot an angel with my father's rifle
I should have set it free, but I

I shot an angel with my father's rifle
I should have set it free, but I
I shot an angel with my father's rifle
I should have set it free, but I

I shot an angel with my father's rifle
I should have set it free, but I
I shot an angel with my father's rifle
I should have set it free, but I
