		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been wishin' for angels
To come down here to save ya
You said that the good guy never wins
And I haven't recognized you ever since
Drugs and love and friendships
Everything that makes you anxious
You said that the good ones never stay
And you don't think you'll find your way

How you holdin' up?
Want me to stay the night?
When it's all too rough
I hope you'll realize
That I can hold your hand when the sun goes down
I'm gonna hold your hand when the sun goes down

California's burnin'
Your heavy heart is too
You know the whole world is hurtin'
And it's not because of you
So take a step, take a step and a breather
It'll be okay
You can rest your head on my shoulder
There's nothin' left to say

How you holdin' up?
Want me to stay the night?
When it's all too rough
I hope you'll realize
That I can hold your hand when the sun goes down
I'm gonna hold your hand when the sun goes down

Hear you, buddy
Life's always been harder for you than it is for everybody
But your lucky day will come
I hear you, buddy
Life's always been harder for you than it is for everybody
But your lucky day will come

How you holdin' up?
Want me to stay the night?
When it's all too rough
I hope you'll realize
That I can hold your hand when the sun goes down
(Ooh yeah, I'm gonna hold your hand)
I'm gonna hold your hand when the sun goes down
(I'm gonna hold your hand)
I'm gonna hold your hand when the sun goes down
(I'm gonna hold your hand, gonna hold your hand)
I'm gonna hold your hand when the sun goes down
