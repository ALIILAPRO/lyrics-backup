		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I made it to an exhibition
The opening is tonight
Men's clothes
Handmade weavings
Hanging on the ceiling
All over the room
It took me 90 seconds to look at
All the artworks
And another fifteen
To read the description
Now I am sitting outside on a bench
Just finished my Flensburger beer
Observing the people in the opposite house
In their apartments with LED lights
One man keeps bowing his head
The other is kissing something
That looks like a child
But turns out to be a dog
Is there more to explore
Is there still more to explore
Or should I just wrap it up
And go home
It took me 90 seconds to look at
All the artworks
And another fifteen
