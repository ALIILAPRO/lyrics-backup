		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I could break any second
I can see where it's headed
You're gonna say I'll be better off
It's gonna hurt when we cut it off
But you can't drive through a dead end
What if we turn the car around
And just go backwards
So we never have to figure out
What comes after
I don't wanna see you every time it snows
It doesn't ever stop in Buffalo
I bet that it's probably twice as cold without you
I don't wanna meet you in another twenty years
Walk out of the bar alone in tears
Wishing I could go back to right here
Where we let go
So what if we don't
Don't
What if we
Don't
People go their whole lives
Wondering if they gave up on something right
But I don't wanna be like one of them
Forty five and just settling
'Cause we called it off at a dead end
What if this is everything that we ever wanted
I can't spend forever feeling like I'm haunted
I don't wanna see you every time it snows
It doesn't ever stop in Buffalo
I bet that it's probably twice as cold without you
I don't wanna meet you in another twenty years
Walk out of the bar alone in tears
Wishing I could go back to right here
Where we let go
So what if we don't
Don't
What if we
Don't
What if we end up making it out alive
And everythings fine in a week
I'm yours and you're mine
'Cause we stayed instead of saying goodbye
What if we tried
I'd rather fight right now
Than see you every time it snows
It doesn't ever stop in Buffalo
I bet that it's probably twice as cold without you
I don't wanna meet you in another twenty years
Walk out the bar alone in tears
Knowing that we had it all right here
Where we let go
So what if we don't
