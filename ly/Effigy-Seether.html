		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Say what you want but you’re not getting through to me
Can you take it, can you take it
Pray if you want but you can't get a piece of me
Can you save this, can you save this
Don't keep saying I'm afraid of a new day
Don't you hate that, really hate that
So stay if you want but we'll burn you an effigy
So separate us, separate us

‘Cause I've been waiting for something beautiful
Can you serve it up for me
But I've been thinking that something wrong with me
Clear it up for me
And I've been hoping for something meaningful
Can you serve it up for me
Yeah I've been looking for something to keep coming back for more

Say what you want but you’re not getting through to me
Can you take it, can you take it
Pray if you want but can't get a piece of me
Can you save this, can you save this
Don't keep saying I'm afraid of a new day
Don't you hate that, really hate that
So stay if you want but we'll burn you an effigy
Separate us, separate us

'Cause I've been waiting for something beautiful
Can you serve it up for me
But I've been thinking that something wrong with me
Clear it up for me
And I've been hoping for something meaningful
Can you serve it up for me
Yeah I've been looking for something to keep coming back for more

Say what you want but you’re not getting through to me
Can you take it, can you take it
Pray if you want but can't get a piece of me
Can you save this, can you save this
Don't keep saying I'm afraid of a new day
Don't you hate that, really hate that
So stay if you want but we'll burn you an effigy
Separate us, separate us

Say what you want but you’re not getting through to me
Can you take it, can you take it
Pray if you want but can't get a piece of me
Keep me coming back for more
