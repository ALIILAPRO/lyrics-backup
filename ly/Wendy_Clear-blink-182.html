		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let's take the boat out on the bay
Forget your job for just one day
I wish it didn't have to be so bad

It might be inappropriate because
Either way our band gets dropped, oh yeah
I wish it didn't have to be so bad

But I'd play with fire to break the ice
And I'd play with a nuclear device
Is it something I'll regret?
Why do I want what I can't get?
I wish it didn't have to be so bad

The three-date theory's getting old
Everyone's getting left out in the cold
I wish it didn't have to be so bad

So I'll see you with another guy
Who pretends not to hear you when you cry, oh yeah
I wish it didn't have to be so bad

But I'd play with fire to break the ice
And I'd play with a nuclear device
Is it something I'll regret?
Why do I want what I can't get?
I wish it didn't have to be so bad

I'll be moving on, moving on
Moving on, and on and on
Moving on, moving on
Moving on and on and on

But I'd play with fire to break the ice
And I'd play with a nuclear device
Is it something I'll regret?
Why do I want what I can't get?
I wish it didn't have to be so bad
I wish it didn't have to be so bad
I wish it didn't have to be so bad
I wish it didn't have to be so bad
