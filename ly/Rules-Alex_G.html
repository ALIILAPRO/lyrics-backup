		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is wrong
This is right
Why don't you understand
You fight
Clean that mess
Wear that dress
I want you to be happy
I guess

When I go you'll know
By my footprints in the snow
Mama says where'd you go
Daddy says where'd you go
Baby says don't you go

She says
Rules are rules
Made for fools
And you are no exception
We're tools
I won't believe
Hate my need
To be a little part of
A machine

Don't you dare ask why
Ill be with you all the time
Mama says close your eyes
Daddy says close your eyes
But baby don't close her eyes
