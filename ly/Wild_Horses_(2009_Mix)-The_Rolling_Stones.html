		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Childhood living 
Is easy to do
The things you wanted 
I bought them for you

Graceless lady 
You know who I am
You know I can't let you 
Slide through my hands

Wild horses 
Couldn't drag me away
Wild, wild horses 
Couldn't drag me away

I watched you suffer 
A dull aching pain
Now you've decided 
To show me the same

No sweeping exit 
Or offstage lines
Could make me feel bitter 
Or treat you unkind

Wild horses 
Couldn't drag me away
Wild, wild horses 
Couldn't drag me away

I know I've dreamed you 
A sin and a lie
I have my freedom 
But I don't have much time

Faith has been broken 
Tears must be cried
Let's do some living 
After we die

Wild horses 
Couldn't drag me away
Wild, wild horses 
We'll ride them some day

Wild horses 
Couldn't drag me away
Wild, wild horses 
We'll ride them some day
