		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There’s a system error that I can’t compute 
Wrap my head round selling my whole heat to you 

We’re up all night talking and confessing our feelings 
I try to forget but when I wake I still feel it 
Are we liquid lucky 
Are we just confused 

Cos You said what you said 
Loose lips aren’t so concealing 
Cos we did what we did 
In my bed and it’s so misleading 

Behind closed doors 
Behind your eyes 
I saw something and I can’t unsee it 
Now I’m lying where you lied 
We can’t hide but we can’t reveal it 
Oh what a sin can do to your mind 
I can’t repent so I keep it inside
Behind closed doors 
Behind your eyes
