		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah

Flashin' lights (ha), bigger stage (hmm)
World watchin', streets amazed (yeah)
Rollin' dope, livin' life (nigga, we made it)
Another day, another dollar, another fight (nigga, we made it)

Yeah, shit couldn't stop (shit couldn't stop)
I pray to God that I see an opp
He think he shinin', my niggas on timin'
We take everything but his sneakers and socks
Mention my name when you speak of the block
Picture my face when you reach for the Glock
I can just do it and act like it's nothin'
They askin' like, "Fivi, it's easy or not?" 
Look, huh, I got a story and I'll never tell it
I got a soul and I'll never sell it
I see them hatin', they watchin', they jealous 
Like how he get a million dollars on the debit?
How he get a million views on the edit?
He marry a million bitches without a wedding
He got a million bitches in the section
That's like a million bitches to have sex with
I got some demons that's hotter than me
They keep on wakin' me out of my sleep
I look on the 'Gram, they ain't hotter than me
'Cause I'm killin' the fit and I body the feats, huh, woo
(Yeah, look, killin' the fit and body the beats, ha, Fivi')
(Killin' the fit and body the beats)
Yeah, look, all of my shooters alert
If I tell 'em I pay 'em the money, they doin' the work
Bullets is bitin' and chewin' his shirt
Show up to the funeral and shoot at his hearse
I chill with the bitches and roll with my niggas
And hang with the baddest and move with the worst
Shorty a baddie, she wish she could have me
I ask for her name and I Google her worth (ha)

Flashin' lights (yeah), bigger stage (yeah)
World watchin' (ha), streets amazed (uh)
Rollin' doupe(yeah), livin' life (uh)
Another day, another dollar, another fight (ha, let's do it)
Flashin' lights (yeah), bigger stage (yeah)
World watchin' (ha), streets amazed (let's do it, uh)
Rollin' dope (yeah), livin' life
Another day, another dollar, another fight (oh, oh, oh)

He was on Sunset with a pistol (grrt)
I turned a jackboy to a victim, hmm
Hope you can tell that I'm not finna play with you 
Bitch-ass nigga, we slide tonight
We put the laser on top of the Glock 
When we slid on the weekend with blindin' lights (yeah)
I'm tryna bury a nigga
Get off the block 'cause you ain't from the area, nigga (yeah)
Get shot in the stomach, that's a miscarriage, lil' nigga
The fuck is you starin' at, nigga?
For the record I might have to address 
All the niggas that say I'm an industry plant
They say all my cars is rented 
I guess they ain't used to no young niggas havin' these racks 
These niggas be trolls, we fuckin' they hoes
They get on the internet, go on a rant
He try to approach, he gon' get turned to a ghost
'Cause I got this bitch in my pants
I probably punch a nigga if he glance
I'm finna shoot, don't worry 'bout my stance
I got my broad a new Hellcat
When you hop in this Rolls, put your hair back (let's go)
I was in the hood where they tote Glocks
And they sell crack at the same motherfuckin' house
When we in the club, I go through the backdoor
I don't trust nobody, I'ma pick your ass off (let's go)
Right now I'm in Vegas tryna get a bad bitch to come through
Maybe she can take the edge off
I ain't got no money, when she go to the bathroom
I'ma take off then start to head home

Flashin' lights, bigger stage (yeah, yeah, yeah)
World watchin', streets amazed (the world is watchin', hmm)
Rollin' dope, livin' life
Another day, another dollar, another fight (know they watchin', yeah)
Flashin' lights, bigger stage
World watchin', streets amazed
Rollin' dope, livin' life
Another day, another dollar, another fight (oh, oh, oh)

Callin', callin', callin' me home
Callin', callin', callin' home
You know the lights that stop to turn to stone
You shine when I'm alone (J Perry on the track)
Callin', callin', callin' me home
Callin', callin', callin' home
You know the lights that stop to turn to stone
You shine when I'm alone
