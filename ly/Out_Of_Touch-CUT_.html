		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  'Do', such a simple word just do
It's harder when it's you
Try to find a solution 
Through, such a simple fact it's true
It's harder when it's you
Try to find a solution

I come home late at night
Dizzy with conversation running through my mind
See my reflection with someone I dislike
Watch myself, try to drink it away
Turn the volume up, can't hear myself say
"I'm out of touch"

I'm out of touch
I'm out of sync with you
I'm out of touch
I'm out of sync with you
Oh-woah, oh, oh-woah, oh
I'm out of touch
I'm out of sync with you
I'm out of touch
I'm out of sync with you
Oh-woah, oh, oh-woah, oh

'Do', such a simple word just do
It's harder when it's you
Try to find a solution 
Through, such a simple fact it's true
It's harder when it's you
Try to find a solution

Lay on my back and I can't close my eyes
'Cause I'm spinning around, can't deny
I'm out of touch
Try to feel my body, so deaf and blind
In this social overload I'm confined
I'm out of touch

I'm out of touch
I'm out of sync with you
I'm out of touch
I'm out of sync with you
Oh-woah, oh, oh-woah, oh
I'm out of touch
I'm out of sync with you
I'm out of touch
I'm out of sync with you
Oh-woah, oh, oh-woah, oh

I'm out of touch
I'm out of sync with you
I'm out of touch
I'm out of sync with you
Oh-woah, oh, oh-woah, oh
I'm out of touch
I'm out of sync with you
I'm out of touch
I'm out of sync with you
Oh-woah, oh, oh-woah, oh
