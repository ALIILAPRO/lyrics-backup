		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Impatient, just say it
Still waitin', for another round
New faces, I'm racin'
On foot but I'll never make it home
Sixth Street for the occasion
Can't take all of the changes
Blue moon, in different phases
Blue moon, in different places

Three hours, three months away
Gone back but not the same
I don't want you to see me
Cause I'm not what I seem
Why was everyone leaving?
Do we say what we mean?
Got the nine to five and the bloodline
Better dress up for the date night
For the date night

Don't hit my cell
There's an unknown number on my phone
I don't need your help
Just let me lay down on the floor
I don't know myself
Not like the time I did before
No, no

Impatient, just say it
Still waitin', for another round
New faces, I'm racin'
On foot but I'll never make it home
Sixth street for the occasion
Can't take all of the changes
Blue moon, in different phases
Blue moon, in different places

Tear me to pieces
I won't even feel it
You're not what I needed
Move on with the seasons

Impatient, just say it
Still waitin', for another round
New faces, I'm racin'
On foot but I'll never make it home
Sixth street for the occasion
Can't take all of the changes
Blue moon, in different phases
Blue moon, in different places
