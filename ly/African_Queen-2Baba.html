		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yea e yea e
You are my African queen
Ooh lord ooh lord uh

Just like the sun lights up the earth
You light up my life uh
The only one I've ever seen with a smile so bright e
Just yesterday eh you came around my way e e e
You changed my whole scenery way
With your astonishing beauty oh
You could make a brother sin
Ordinary thing a supernatural being I know
You are just brighter than the moon
Brighter than the sun I love you just the way you are

And you are my African queen
The girl of my dreams
You take me where I've never been
You make my heart go ting a ling a ling oh ahh
You are my African queen
The girl of my dreams
You remind me of a thing
And that is the African beauty yahh oooo
You are my African queen oh lord oh lord hmm

Out of a million you stand as one the outstanding one hmm
I look into your eyes girl what I see is paradise yeah
You captivated my soul
Now everyday I want you more o o oo
How can I deny this feeling I'm feeling inside
Ey oh no one can never take your place
Can never take your space that a fact I cannot erase
And you you are the one that makes me smile
Make me float like a boat upon the nile

Girl you are my African queen
The girl of my dreams
You take me where I've never been
You make my heart go ting a ling a ling oh ahh
You are my African queen
The girl of my dreams
You remind me of a thing
And that is the African beauty yahhh
Oh oh oh oh oooo oh oh oh boy
E e e eee uh uh uh boy

You are my African queen and I know oh yes I know hmm
You are my African queen and I know see I know
See I know what I am feeling in my heart and in my soul
Oh I know that it is love
And I know that this love was surely sent from up above
Surely you're the only one I think of
You are my African queen
And I know that this means that
You're the only one that I will serve
I'll give you my heart my love my body and my money
Every other thing you think of
Inner ma who could think of anything better than you
Who could think of ever hurting you
Sacrifice my all I'll give it all to you
You are my African queen for real

And you are my African queen
The girl of my dreams (the girl of my dream)
You take me where I've never been oh na na ye
You make my heart go ting a ling a ling oh ahh
You are my African queen my Africa queen
The girl of my dreams my African
You remind me of a thing oh oh e
And that is the African beauty yahhh so black so beautiful
