		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Watch what you say
Living and dying
Swallowed decay
Somebody rescue me

Watch what you say
Watch what you want
Living and dying
Faster we're dying

Destroy this world
Destroy everything that comes to near for me
Destroy this world
Destroy everything that comes to near for me
Destroy this world
Destroy everything that comes to near for me
Destroy this world
Destroy everything that comes to near for me

Destroy

Watch what you say
Living and dying
Swallowed dismay
Ferocious hostility

Watch what you say
Watch what you need
Living and dying
Faster we're dying

Destroy this world
Destroy everything that comes to near for me
Destroy this world
Destroy everything that comes to near for me
Destroy this world
Destroy everything that comes to near for me
Destroy this world
Destroy everything that comes to near for me

Destroy

Destroy

Life in the monster's grip
Life in the monster's mouth
It's eating lives, the mouth we feed
It feeds on weakened souls

I've been in monster's grip
I've been in circles we call life now
Lives, the mouth we feed
It feeds on weakened souls
It takes us all

In the monster's grip
Life in the monster's mouth
It's eating lives, the mouth we feed
It feeds on weakened souls
It takes us all

It takes us all

It takes serenity
It takes the weaker ones out of this game

This is obscenity
It takes the lone ones out of this world

Destroy this world
Destroy everything that comes to near for me
Destroy this world
Destroy everything that comes to near for me
Destroy this world
Destroy everything that comes to near for me
Destroy this world
Destroy everything that comes to near for me

Destroy
