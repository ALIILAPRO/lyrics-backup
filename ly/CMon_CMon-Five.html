		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lately I've been thinking that I don't feel like I used to do
I'm trying to keep my two feet on the ground
Constantly surrounded everywhere I turn I'm hounded
People stop and stare and look me up and down
Now you shouldn't feel down from what everybody says
And don't let it bother you if anybody stares
'Cause you know that at times people can be cruel
Try to put you down make you feel like a fool
But you got one shot now don't you ever stop
Keep your dreams high keep reachin' for the top
'Cause you know and I know if they had the chance
They'd be climbin' up on the stage trying to dance

C'mon c'mon and get together
Lets take a chance, it's now or never
Spread the word over the nation
That we are the new generation
C'mon c'mon and get together
Start living your life like it's forever
Don't want to stop if you're dreamin'
Let everybody know what you're feeling

Questions I can't answer got me going round in circles
Make me feel as though I'm losing self control
It's feeling like a dream to me. I've lost a touch of reality
Deep inside I've searched with my soul
Now it's good to keep searching and bettering yourself
But don't push too hard 'cause it's bad for your health
And running round in circles will always get you dizzy
And thinking too much that will make your head busy
So just sit back and relax, you gotta chill
I promise that all of your dreams will be fulfilled
One day if you keep on looking you'll find
You just gotta go with your heart and your mind

C'mon c'mon and get together
Lets take a chance, it's now or never
Spread the word over the nation
That we are the new generation
C'mon c'mon and get together
Start living your life like it's forever
Don't want to stop if you're dreamin'
Let everybody know what you're feeling

C'mon c'mon and get together
Lets take a chance, it's now or never
Spread the word over the nation
That we are the new generation
C'mon c'mon and get together
Start living your life like it's forever
Don't want to stop if you're dreamin'
Let everybody know what you're feeling

C'mon c'mon and get together
Lets take a chance, it's now or never
Spread the word over the nation
That we are the new generation
C'mon c'mon and get together
Start living your life like it's forever
Don't want to stop if you're dreamin'
Let everybody know what you're feeling

C'mon c'mon and get together
Lets take a chance, it's now or never
Spread the word over the nation
That we are the new generation
C'mon c'mon and get together
Start living your life like it's forever
Don't want to stop if you're dreamin'
Let everybody know what you're feeling

C'mon c'mon and get together
Lets take a chance, it's now or never
Spread the word over the nation
That we are the new generation
C'mon c'mon and get together
Start living your life like it's forever
Don't want to stop if you're dreamin'
Let everybody know what you're feeling

C'mon c'mon and get together
Lets take a chance, it's now or never
Spread the word over the nation
That we are the new generation
C'mon c'mon and get together
Start living your life like it's forever
Don't want to stop if you're dreamin'
Let everybody know what you're feeling
