		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Show me how you care)
(Statik Selektah) yeah
(Tell me how) tell me all
(You love)
Tell me how you love, baby (before)

Uh, can't spell us without trust
Put the lust aside, there's some things we gotta discuss
So close your legs for a bit, baby, let's open up
Closed mouths don't get fed, finish your lunch
Your panties in a bunch
Tell me where you been at these last couple months
You say you want me back, so baby, don't front
'Cause I could never know too much but just enough 
So the next nigga never feel like he got the one-up
But, we ain't gotta rush, take ya time
We can talk until the sun up, I see you tryin'
To say what's on your mind, I promise it'll be fine
I can see the signs, be honest, I ain't blind
The truth is we all got our own desires, our own dreams
It's a big world, gotta try new things
So right here right now what you gotta say?
You ain't gotta lie now, it's the bed we made

(Show me how) show me how, baby
(You care) right here, right now
Right here, right now, right now, baby, yeah 
(Tell me how) tell me all 
(You love)
Tell me how you love, baby (before)

Uh, 'cause transparency my love language
Can't see the bigger picture if your vision tainted
Love is like glass, either break it or you stain it
These late night conversations turned into arraignments
Just tell me the truth
'Cause I ain't tryna judge, baby, I just want you be you
'Cause I'ma be me, keep it G like like real niggas do
'Cause you knew a nigga way before he got famous
On the block, nameless and I'm proud to say the money never changed us
We've been through many phases like mazes then we found a way
I never knew a love that wasn't painless
Pourin' out my heart was always drainin'
I gotta say, now every day is indigo rain
And yet it's a brighter day
A lifetime I provide for you, by the way
Don't you forget that I would die for you any day
Right here right now, what you gotta say?
You ain't gotta lie now, it's the bed we made, uh

(Show me how) show me how, baby
(You care) right here, right now
Right here, right now, right now, baby, yeah 
(Tell me how) tell me all 
(You love)
Tell me how you love, baby (before)

You ain't gotta lie to me, no, no
I know you would die for me, it's for sure
Baby girl, this life we lead is too short (too short)
Baby girl, this life we lead is too (too short)

You ain't gotta lie to me, no, no
I know you would die for me, it's for sure
Baby girl, this life we lead is too short (too short)
Ayy, too, it's too short

Said thug don't cry, no
But a thug don't cry, no
And real niggas don't lie
Said thug don't cry, no
Said a thug don't cry, no
And real niggas don't lie

Said a thug don't cry, no
Said a thug don't cry, no
And real niggas don't lie
Said a thug don't cry, no (don't lie, don't lie, don't lie)
Thug don't cry
Real niggas never lie (too short)
