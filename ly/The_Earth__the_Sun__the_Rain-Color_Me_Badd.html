		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I was lost, 
I could not see all the beauty and wonder wrapping around me.
I was alone dreaming of you.
Oh, I could not imagine this dream coming true.
 
So much joy now in all that I touch.
You make me feel ev'ry thing so much.
 
I will love you for the earth at my feet.
I will love you for the sun in the sky.
I will love you for the falling rain, hoh, hoh.
I will love you for the heart that could break.
I will love you for the dreams that we share.
I will love you for the falling rain, hoh, hoh.
 
Facing the wind, tears from my eyes.
Baby, where have you been?
But I was always waiting for you to pull back the dawn,
to take me by the hand and lead me through.
 
This whole world lies a stranger to me.
Now you have open my heart to ev'rything.
 
I will love you for the earth at my feet.
I will love you for the sun in the sky.
I will love you for the falling rain, hoh, hoh.
I will love you for the heart that could break.
I will love you for the dreams that we share.
I will love you for the falling rain, hoh, yeah.
 
Like a whisper in a dream
you have walked softly into my life 
with love and sweet emotion.
And as I gaze into your eyes 
I see the beauty that God has created , and I love you, 
girl, now and forever.
 
I will love you for the earth at my feet.
I will love you for the sun in the sky.
I will love you for the falling rain, hoh, hoh
I will love you for the heart that could break. 
I will love you for the dreams that we share.
I will love you for the falling rain, hoh, hoh 
 
I will love you  for the earth at my feet. 
I will love your for the sun in the sky.
I will love you for the falling rain, hoh, hoh
I will love you for the heart that could break. 
I will love you for the dreams that we share.
I will love you for the falling rain, hoh, hoh
