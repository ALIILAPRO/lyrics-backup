		  Isabel Isabel Isabel
Coming to the end of the road
Not that we'll ever know
It's about it's about Isabel Isabel
Coming to the end of the road
Make sure to put your jacket on
And make this last stretch on
your own

Time to
Send your soul back to the ground
Send your soul back to the ground
Let go of all pains within
And once again hear the pearl
fishers sing
Isabelâ€¦

It's in your eyes in your eyes
A part of you already there
Off a cliff flying thru the air

The moving hands the moving hands
Circle with nowhere to go
Underneath a blanket of snow
Inside concrete built to code

Time to
Send your soul back to the ground
Send your soul back to the ground
Let go of all pains within
And once again hear the pearl
fishers sing

Send your soul back to the ground
Send your soul back to the ground
Let go of all pains within
And once again hear the pearl
fishers sing Isabel
