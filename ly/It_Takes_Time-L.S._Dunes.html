		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hello, I'm not sure if you remember
We connected a long time ago
We were only kids trying everything
To reflect the light we're denied

Scalpel admission
The tendons bare
All pins and needles
I can feel it everywhere

Devolution demands
Devour everything and fire across the multiverse
To collect, collect, collect my anchor
To collect, collect, collect my end
To collect, collect, collect my anchor
Matter over mind
One day at a time

The veins collapse
An iron bar infused into the wrist
And I'd surrender anything to try and keep a grip

Operation obsolete
Metacarpal you can't keep
Anaesthesia hasn't kicked in
I can feel it everywhere

Commotion command
We'll cancel everything
And play our records in reverse
To collect, collect, collect my anchor
To collect, collect, collect my end
To collect, collect, collect my anchor
Matter over mind
One day at a time

Cheek to chest and unimpressed
We're severed at the wrist
(Scalpel admission
The tendons bare)

Replace the bone with earth and stone
And make sure that it fits
(All pins and needles
Will make it fit)

Devolution demands
Devour everything and fire across the multiverse
To collect, collect, collect my anchor
To collect, collect, collect my end
To collect, collect, collect my anchor
Matter over mind
One day at a time
