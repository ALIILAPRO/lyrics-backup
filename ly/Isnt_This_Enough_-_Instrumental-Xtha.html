		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I stood alone against the monochrome
The enigmatic system of life
Where dreams fall frail
And slip away like ashes on a knife

Begging you please see through your ambitions
Entangled in a vicious lilt and lie
We'd build a paradise forgetting all the days we died.
So tell us why

Isn't this good enough to live for
Isn't this what you always planned
Isn't this good enough to die for
Or is this the final time to stand for
Isn't this what you always hoped for
Why is this misery all the same
Isn't this where your only love's stored
Or is this all a never-ending game

Life lives and dies inside our memories
As fragile as the friendships we cling to
Entrenched in imperfection
There's no telling what they'll do

These people fight for opportunity
A freedom and a future of their own
Where chasing new creation
Leaves the innocent alone

Begging you please see through your intentions
At all the horrid torture we've been through
You're executing failure on everyone you knew
Your heart's consumed

One universe
Made of all the best of others
Hold back your bitterness
Every fight leads to another
Cross out all of your
Bothersome sentimentality
All this anarchy
Finally means something perfectly

Isn't this good enough to live for
Isn't this what you always planned
Isn't this good enough to die for
Or is this the final time to stand for
Isn't this what you always hoped for
Why is this misery all the same
Isn't this where your only love's stored
Or is this all a never-ending game

Isn't this good enough to live for
It isn't good enough
Isn't this what you always planned
It's all to plan
Isn't this good enough to die for
You can die for something more
Or is this the final time to stand for
So take a stand
Isn't this what you always hoped for
I hope for so much more
Why is this misery all the same
It's never the same
Isn't this where your only love's stored
You know what my love's for
Or is this all a never-ending game
This is my game
