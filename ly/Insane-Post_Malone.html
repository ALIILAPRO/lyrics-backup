		<p>
		  (Yeah, we want to go insane)

Take your bitch, give her back, insane
Send her packin', she was actin' crazy
Goin' batshit in the backseat, Range
She was classy, now she nasty, hey
I'm a bachelor, I'm a bastard, hey (wow)
Don't believe me? You can ask her, hey
Goin' batshit in the backseat, Range 
She was classy, now she nasty, hey

Bring that ass, meet me backstage
A million racks, I need it cash, cake
Yeah, we both got a car, but it's different
Yeah, we both got a house, but it's different
Yeah, we both got teeth, but it's different
(Both got teeth, both got teeth) (damn)

I wanna see somethin' in a short skirt, please
I wanna see somethin' in a shirt skort, please (wow)
Treat my top like my ex, I'm gon' cut it off completely
Treat my top like my ex, I'm gon' cut it off completely (skrrt-skrrt)

Take your bitch, give her back, insane
Send her packin', she was actin' crazy
Goin' batshit in the backseat, Range
She was classy, now she nasty, hey
I'm a bachelor, I'm a bastard, hey (wow)
Don't believe me? You can ask her, hey
Goin' batshit in the backseat, Range (skrrt)
She was classy, now she nasty, hey 

Second verse, second verse, yeah
Second verse, second verse, again (damn)
Put her on game, this is not the same though
This is a Mulsanne, diamonds make a rainbow
Keep my Glocky tucked like a baby in a manger
When your girl around me, she treat you like a stranger
I got twenty, thirty strippers in the sprinter van
It's a little cramped, they tryna teach me how to dance

Ooh, and you talkin' this shit, but 
You ain't gonna do shit, ooh (gonna do shit, ooh)
I ain't even gotta get up
Ain't nobody scared of you, ooh (damn)

Take your bitch, give her back, insane (wow)
Send her packin', she was actin' crazy
Goin' batshit in the backseat, Range 
She was classy, now she nasty, hey
I'm a bachelor, I'm a bastard, hey (wow)
Don't believe me? You can ask her, hey
Goin' batshit in the backseat, Range (wow)
She was classy, now she nasty, hey
