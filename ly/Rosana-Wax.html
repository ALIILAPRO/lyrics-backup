		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, uh, yeah, uh
Ow ow, yeah, ow ow ow ow
Check it out
My chick is one out of a million, she a grand prize
Met her on the dash bus up in Van Nuys
That pretty face, accent, and them tan thighs
Make me fantasize all day, I hit it like

Boom, boom, ay
She is untouchable
Boom, boom, ay
I'm tellin' ya, man, she don't quit
I hit it like, boom, boom, ay
She is untouchable
Boom, boom, ay
And I don't think I can handle this shit

(What's my motherfuckin' name?)
Rosana, freaky little mama
She be tryin' to fuck all day
Hit it from the morning to the evening
She be still fiendin'
Lil mamacita, don't play

(What's my motherfuckin' name?)
Rosana, freaky little mama
She be tryin' to fuck all day
Hit it from the morning to the evening
She be still fiendin'
Lil mamacita, don't play

Hey yo
Me and her been together for like a couple months
Mami got that punani sweeter than peanut butter crunch
I hit it from the back like a sucker punch
Bust a nut, back to the front for some uppercuts
And in the morning she be hookin' me up proper
Butt-naked in my kitchen while she cookin' me machacha
And before I go to work she give me that boom-shocka-locka
I want to stay home and fuck her all day, I hit it like

Boom, boom, ay
She is untouchable
Boom, boom, ay
I'm tellin' ya, man, she don't quit
I hit it like, boom, boom, ay
She is untouchable
Boom, boom, ay
And I don't think I can handle this shit

(What's my motherfuckin' name?)
Rosana, freaky little mama
She be tryin' to fuck all day
Hit it from the morning to the evening
She be still fiendin'
Lil mamacita, don't play

(What's my motherfuckin' name?)
Rosana, freaky little mama
She be tryin' to fuck all day
Hit it from the morning to the evening
She be still fiendin'
Lil mamacita, don't play

A lot of joy, a lot of pleasure, lot of pain, lot of misery
She turn me on, but she be drainin' me physically
And I mean that quite literally
'Cause I've only got so many mini-mes swimmin' in me
Man I give it all I got, but still she wants to get some more
Back to the bathroom, back to the bedroom
Back to the hall to the kitchen floor
I don't know what I'm bitchin' for, cause I like it that way
And all I wanna do all day is hit it like

Boom, boom, ay
She is untouchable
Boom, boom, ay
I'm tellin' ya, man, she don't quit
Gonna hit it like, boom, boom, ay
She's industructable
Boom, boom, ay
And I don't think I can handle this shit

(What's my motherfuckin' name?)
Rosana, freaky little mama
She be tryin' to fuck all day
Hit it from the morning to the evening
She be still fiendin'
Lil mamacita, don't play

(What's my motherfuckin' name?)
Rosana, freaky little mama
She be tryin' to fuck all day
Hit it from the morning to the evening
She be still fiendin'
Lil mamacita, don't play

(What's my motherfuckin' name?)
Rosana, freaky little mama
She be tryin' to fuck all day
Hit it from the morning to the evening
She be still fiendin'
Lil mamacita, don't play
