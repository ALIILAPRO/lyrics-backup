		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't be your love
Look it's too trivial for you now
Oh, my life's fallin' apart
Maybe no one will know if I disappear

But I'll pray for you all the time
If I could be by your side
I'll give you all my life my seasons

I can't be your love
'Cause I'm afraid I'll ruin your life (hmm)
While the leaves withered away
And grew again you have gone far away
I'll be pushing up daisies
And bring all the chances to here

But I'll pray for you all the time
If I could be by your side
I'll give you all my life my seasons
By your side I'll be your seasons, hmm
My love
