		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I didn’t think flowers would grow for me, again
I didn’t know clouds could part above my head
And the empty streets were slowly filled with colour
I turned around and winter changed to summer

Cause I’ve been waiting for the flowers to grow
And I’ve been longing for these showers to go
But now I’m finally falling for this feeling, I am falling like the rain
that let me grow flowers once again

And underneath all the the thorns, I found a rose
You were the sun that warmed my bones
It’s like heaven tried to hide away in plain sight
Yes I turned around and darkness turned to daylight

Cause I been waiting for the flowers to grow
And I’ve been longing for these showers to go
But now I’m finally falling for this feeling, I am falling like the rain
that let me grow flowers once again

Cause I’ve been waiting for the flowers to grow 
I’ve been waiting for the flowers to grow
I’ve been waiting for the flowers to grow
I’ve been waiting for the flowers to grow
to grow
let me grow flowers once again.
