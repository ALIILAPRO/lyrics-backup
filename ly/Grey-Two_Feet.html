		<p>
		  Before I fall away
I feel like I should say
I've always liked your eyes
But now I've got to leave

It's okay
It's alright
I feel good
I feel fine

I feel it all today
I told you that's okay
I've always liked your eyes
And say you never stayed

It's okay
It's alright
I feel good
I feel fine

It's okay (you never know, you never know)
It's alright (you never know)
I feel good (you never know, you never know)
I feel fine (you never know)
It's okay (you never know, you never know)
It's alright (you never know)
I feel good (you never know, you never know)
I feel fine (you never know)
