		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (That's the shit I'm talking about though, like
You changed up
You don't even fucking link nobody no more
You just dash me away like a cyattie
Yo, you cheese me dog)

Always felt like my vision been bigger than the bigger picture
Crazy how you gotta wait until it's dark out to see who really with you
Crazy how even when it miss you, shit'll come back around and get you
Crazy like all my niggas
Crazy like all my niggas
Remember I deleted all my other girls' numbers out the phone for you?
Remember when you had to take the bar exam, I drove in the snow for you?
Yeah, you probably don't remember half the shit a nigga did for you

Yeah, you ain't really fuck with me way back then, but how 'bout now? (Now)
'Cause I'm up right now ('cause I'm up right now)
And you're stuck right now (stuck right now)
Oh, you thought you had it all figured back then, but how 'bout now? (Now)
'Cause I'm up right now ('cause I'm up right now)
And you're stuck right now (stuck right now)
Yeah, you thought the little effort that you put in was enough, girl, how 'bout now? (Now)
Yeah, girl, how 'bout now?
How 'bout now, girl? What about now, girl? How 'bout now?

Yeah, always been daddy's little angel
I bought your dad a bunch of shit for Christmas, he ain't even say, "Thank you"
I had no money left from acting, I was focused on the music
I used to always try and burn you CDs of my new shit
You be like, "Who's this?" I be like, "Me, girl"
You be like, "Oh word, true shit"
Then ask if we could listen to Ludacris
And car rides made me feel like I was losin' it
Yeah, made me feel I ain't have it like that, I was average like that
Started drinking way more than I used to, people form habits like that, girl
Yeah, man enough to tell you I was hurt that year
I'm not even Christian, I still went to church that year
Guess I just had to pretend that year
I ain't even see my friends that year
Places that I should've been

You ain't really fuck with me way back then, but how 'bout now? (Now)
'Cause I'm up right now ('cause I'm up right now)
And you're stuck right now (stuck right now)
Oh, you thought you had it all figured back then, girl, how 'bout now? (Now)
'Cause I'm up right now ('cause I'm up right now)
And you're stuck right now (stuck right now)
Yeah, you thought the little effort that you put in was enough, girl, how 'bout now? (Now)
Yeah, girl, how 'bout now?
How 'bout now, girl? What about now, girl? How 'bout now?

(My heart belongs to you)
(Whatever you need, there's nothing I won't do)
(Whatever you need, there's nothing I won't do) now
(Whatever you need) and you stuck right now (there's nothing I won't do) now
'Cause I'm up right now
And you stuck right now
Now (whatever you need) right now
(There's nothing I won't do) now
