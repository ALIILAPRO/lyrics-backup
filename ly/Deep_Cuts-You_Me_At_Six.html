		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, it's true, I don't know how it feels
But tell me, did you take the red or blue pill?
A finger on the trigger is a crutch
Time to press eject, it's a feeling in your gut

It's a heartache in the making
It's half post lonely
Deadbeat promises, for your eyes only
Eyes wide shut, you're all grown up

And oh, death by a thousand cuts
A lover's touch hurts twice as much
A flesh wound got you all torn up

And I don't want you to live like this forever
And I don't want you thinking you can't do better
You're upside down and you're inside out
And I know that you would be better
Better off alone

It's a heartache in the making
It's half post lonely
Deadbeat promises, for your eyes only
He's got the legion, it's speaking, a language I ain't feeling
Caesar, the Palace, ODed on wreaking havoc
Stroke of genius, it's seamless, the man's an extremist
Eyes wide shut, you're all grown up

And oh, death by a thousand cuts
A lover's touch hurts twice as much
A flesh wound got you all torn up

And I don't want you to live like this forever
And I don't want you thinking you can't do better
You're upside down and you're inside out
And I know that you would be better
Better off alone

And I, I know
You've got deep cuts (you've got)
People tell you to move on (I, I know)
Still holding on to what you know is gone (you've got)
An alibi, another chance to lie (deep cuts)
Caught with tears in your eyes
No more time for sad songs (I, I know)
In all black, no funerals (you've got)
Plastic flowers for vacant souls (deep cuts)
Jealousy's a fatal dose

And I don't want you to live like this forever
And I don't want you thinking you can't do better
You're upside down and you're inside out
And I know that you would be better
Better off alone

(I know you've got)
(I know, I know)
(I know, you've got)
(You've got, you've got, you've got)
