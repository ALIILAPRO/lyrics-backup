		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Gather around everybody
Have you heard the latest craze?
Put your hands in your pockets
And look the other way
Remember those times when you were laughing
Naked on my couch pretend it never happened
Politely smile as we turn around

Do the act like you never met me
Do the act like you never met me
Do the act like you never met me
And slowly walk away

The hidden kisses
The clumsy conspiratory glance
But I don't really mind it though
I always like the way you danced
It's so easy to do
So much simpler than the one we did before
Just point out your toe at someone you know
And pretend that they're not

And do the act like you never met me
Do the act like you never met me
And do the act like you never met me
And slowly walk away slide to the left
Now slide to the right
Now tell me once again
How I was a really great guy dip to right
Shimmy to the left
It's 3 o'clock in the morning
Don't answer my texts take a step back and
Take a couple more now one more sorry look
Before you walk out that door arch your back
When you spend the night with him
Bounce around a while never talk to me again

That's how you do the
Act like you never met me
So do the act like you never met me
Do the act like you never met me
And slowly walk away
