		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hah
And lil' Metro on that beat
Helpless, please help me
I'm helpless
When she put that pussy on me I feel helpless
Huh, Metro, Guwop

The way she put that pussy on me, I feel helpless
And I want that pussy to myself, I'm selfish (true)
Say she want a nigga like me that's wealthy
Try to stay away from her but I can't help it
I'm so helpless
(Please help me, huh, somebody please help me)
I feel helpless (please help me)

Say she got that Sunshine pussy from Harlem Nights
Make you come home, say "I ain't comin' home for life"
You're like, "Damn, you don't care if you're wrong or right?"
Goin' hard on that patron, girl it's on tonight
I'm addicted, somebody please help me
Is there a pussy rehab? Please tell me
A thousand dollars, fuck her long, she smell me
Dick harder than a rock, she felt me
I put it on her so good, she helpless
See me with her girlfriend, she jealous
I woke up with a rich bitch, we wealthy
I'm talkin' good cardio, we healthy
Expensive lingerie on, she sexy
She asked me when I'm comin' home, she text me
I want head in the morning, fuck breakfast
I'm the best that ever did it, fuck Elvis (Wop)

The way she put that pussy on me, I feel helpless
And I want that pussy to myself, I'm selfish (true)
Say she want a nigga like me that's wealthy
Try to stay away from her but I can't help it
I'm so helpless
(Please help me, huh, somebody please help me)
I feel helpless (please help me)

She got a church girl smile but a bedroom body
But this ain't no church girl, this a grown ass woman
Get to diggin' in her stomach, got her grown ass runnin'
Tell me "hurry up" 'cause her home girl comin'
Told me beat it up, I say "You ain't said nothin'"
If you ain't seen her naked, nigga, you ain't seen nothin'
Laughin' but that camel in her jeans mean muggin'
Actin' like we family, but bitch we ain't cousins
Knockin' out the stuffings man, I'm trampoline jumpin'
Tryna set this bed on fire like it's kerosene burning
Dressed up like a naughty nurse like Halloween comin'
I'm addicted like a fiend so I give her green money

The way she put that pussy on me, I feel helpless
And I want that pussy to myself, I'm selfish (true)
Say she want a nigga like me that's wealthy
Try to stay away from her but I can't help it
I'm so helpless
(Please help me, huh, somebody please help me)
I feel helpless (please help me, hah)
