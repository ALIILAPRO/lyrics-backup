		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Cut me deep
I can't get no sleep
Then I'm rolling by the river
Trying to get back on my feet

God-damn you woke up the ghost in me
And now I need minute to breathe
'Cause I'm losing my self-control

Ooh-ooh-ooh

That's right I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve
That don't mean that I want it to bleed
But I'm walking down your road

Ooh-ooh-ooh

Oh me, oh my
I've been thinking that I'm alright
Now I'm realizing I'm blind
And I need to open my eyes

Oh me, oh my
I've been swimming against the tide
Oh I have (oh I have)
And now I feel it

Cut me deep
I can't get no sleep
And I'm rolling by the river
Trying to get back on my feet
And you still cut me deep
And I'm on my knees
And I'm rolling by the river
Trying to get back on my feet

You still cut me deep
I can't get no sleep
And I'm rolling by the river
Trying to get back on my feet
And you still cut me deep
'Cause I'm on my knees
And I'm rolling by the river
Trying to get back on my feet

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh

God-damn woke up in a reverie
Your loves taking a hold on me
As the silence comes and goes

Ooh-ooh-ooh

Was it something that I said
That you let get inside your head
That made you want me
Then made you cold

Ooh-ooh-ooh

Oh me, oh my
I've been thinking that I'm alright
Now I'm realizing I'm blind
And I need to open my eyes

Oh me, oh my 
I've been swimming against the tide
Oh, I have (oh, I have)
And now I feel it

(Power to a crowd when the river runs dry)

You still cut me deep
I can't get no sleep
And I'm rolling by the river
Trying to get back on my feet
And you still cut me deep
'Cause I'm on my knees
And I'm rolling by the river
Trying to get back on my feet

Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Rolling by the river?

Can you feel it? Ah-ooh
Can you feel it? Ah-ooh
Can you feel it?
Rolling by the river?

You still cut me deep
I can't get no sleep
And I'm rolling by the river
Trying to get back on my feet
And you still cut me deep
'Cause I'm on my knees
And I'm rolling by the river
Trying to get back on my feet

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
