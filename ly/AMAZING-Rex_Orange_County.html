		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's no way to time it
And where you may find it
Is unknown, until then
You're a loner
So you see her (see her)
She's over (over) in the corner (corner)
And you can't (you can't) ignore her (ignore her)
There must be a reason
You see it, believe it now

Search the definition of shame
I'm sure you'll see my face
Who's gonna save me now?
I hope it's you, my babe

Don't change a thing, you are amazing
I can't believe you've come and saved me
You can stay here, spend every day here
I don't mind, no
Don't change a thing, you are amazing
I can't believe you've come and saved me
You can stay here, spend every day here
I don't mind

See her
She's over in the corner
And I can't ignore her
I hope there's a reason
To see it, I see it now (now, oh)

Search the definition of afraid
And I'm sure you'll see my face
Who's gonna save me now?
I hope it's you, my babe

Don't change a thing, you are amazing
I can't believe you've come and saved me
You can stay here, spend every day, dear
I wouldn't mind
Don't change a thing, you are amazing
I can't believe you've come and saved me
You can stay here, spend every day here
Oh (I don't mind), that's alright

Yeah
