		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've never wanted to be
What you want me to be
It's like I've lost myself in finding my way
I feel it creeping in
Patience is wearing thin
If I could help myself I would

But there's a part of me that roams
That belongs to the road and begs me to run

To run away from the world
To leave it all behind
To strip it away and see what's on the inside
So I'm facing my fears
And taking my time
To strip it away and see what's on the inside

I've always tried to be
What you needed from me
Along the way forgot who I am
I'm sorry for getting cold
And for pushing you away
It just feels like I'm falling and nobody's there

But there's a part of me that roams
That belongs to the road and begs me to run

To run away from the world
To leave it all behind
To strip it away and see what's on the inside
So I'm facing my fears
And taking my time
To strip it away and see what's on the inside

Oh-oh

To run away from the world (run away from the world)
To close my eyes and leap
To take the road less traveled to the unknown
To take the long way home (long way home)
And be wrong sometimes
To be like the wind and find out what's on the inside

Runaway from the world
And leave it all behind
Strip it away and see what's on the inside

(Run)
Runaway from the world
And leave it all behind
Strip it away and see what's on the inside
So I'm facing my fears
And taking my time
To strip it away and see what's on the inside

(Runaway from the world) runaway from the world
(Runaway from the world) leave it all behind
(Runaway from the world) runaway from the world
(Runaway from the world) leave it all behind
