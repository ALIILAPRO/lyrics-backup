		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Keep it on the hush
I just want your loving here
Let me lead

Hold my hand
I got a plan

I don't ever get the hold up
You told me last time you're here
You tried to leave him

Go and do that
Then come right back

You afraid once your done
You won't find love so fun

You gave years girl what a run
Now You don't want anyone

How many times will you try?
It seems your one and done

Girl I know
It's getting a little old

You Still gotta
Open up your arms
Open up your heart
And let someone in
What can make you break?
All it's gotta take
Is me trying again
Open up
You pray for
A shooting star
A shooting star
To wish for someone like me
You pray for
A shooting star
A shooting star
To wish for someone like me
Ah
Show me your best yes
And Give me what's left
Do you hear me?
Give me what's left
Ahhh Give me what's left of you
Do you hear me?
Give me what's left
Do you hear me
Tell me what's next
Ah the rest of you

Back and forth
You worth the wait

Shackled up
You'd rather play

Demons out here
With us When it's getting late

Eat between those legs
I got expensive taste

Exotic bitches
That's you I mention

Some Picked fences
With the matching benzes

Rub my lamp
I'm granting all your wishes

Hope you really with it  baby

You Still gotta
Open up your arms
Open up your heart
And let someone in
What can make you break?
All it's gotta take
Is me trying again
Open up
You pray for
A shooting star
A shooting star
To wish for someone like me
You pray for
A shooting star
A shooting star
To wish for someone like me
