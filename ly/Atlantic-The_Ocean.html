		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  yes this one time you've been bold
but don't you get a big head
remind yourself what you've been told
don't you get carried away
you were never ever good enough
you should try harder

if you can understand all the patterns
that redound to your detriment 
if you can understand all the patterns:
why do you keep repeating them?

high, high defeatism
high, high defeatism

now I see you in another light

immerse in the dark that you chose to surround you
you're so hurt and so weak and you're so damn afraid of the truth
and you chew on your pain by denying the past and begriming what used to be your nest
you're filled to the brim with a guilt that you can't come to terms with

high defeatism
high defeatism

how can you say that you loved me
when all you seek is revenge
how can you say that you loved me
when all you seek is retaliation

son you'll need a radical change
son you deserve something better than this
son you're in need of a tactical 
switch in defence

son you'll need a radical change
for something better than this
but now you're daydreaming

here comes the dark that you chose to be your playground
it's not so hard, with eyes closed, to find your way around 
enter the void of your own imagination
harvest the fruits of years of procrastination

but now your daydream is over
