		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Onokey fully loaded)

All our feelings gone, we don't show no pity
Hit the door, ain't tryna talk, bitch, let me see yo' titties
Shoot at the group and make 'em dance, we turn opps Diddy
It get scary where I'm from, this shit like Gotham City
Gotham City
This shit like Gotham City
This shit like Gotham City
Swear this shit like Gotham City

This shit like Gotham City, we the villains
Gang be tryna slide without me, that shit hurt my feelings
They like, "You got too much to lose, don't need to do no drillings"
Laugh in they face, hop in that car
Like, let's go touch a ceilin'
This that Ruff Ryder shit, I'm tryna break the wheel
Switchin', swervin' lanes, my bitch say, "Jesus, take the wheel" (grrah)
Toni pop a X, look like an owl on them pills
When Toni on that X, all he talk about is, "Kill, kill"
I hit Tu phone, like what's the move?
I hang with shit from the zoo
I got opps that's overdue
Catch him, "Du-du-du-du-du"
His rats and them, know that them ain't shoot
Once he talk a lot, that shit ain't cool
Just play like one, I ain't no fool
Turn me up, I'm in that mood
Tell the opps we villains, in the hood, we heroes
Fill up the whip with shots, look like a bunch of zeroes
I just got four more switches, gave 'em to my lil' bro
In Chicago with one one me, bitch, I feel like DRose
Ho hit me like, "Where you been"
She must miss what's in my pants
Pull up, eat what's in my pants
Come back tomorrow, eat again
Where the pounds? They finna land
Pocket chop', that F&N
Chop a opper and his friends
Know a lot of bloody men

All our feelings gone, we don't show no pity
Hit the door, ain't tryna talk, bitch, let me see yo' titties
Shoot at the group and make 'em dance, we turn opps Diddy
It get scary where I'm from, this shit like Gotham City (uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh)
Gotham City
This shit like Gotham City
This shit like Gotham City
Swear this shit like Gotham City
It get scary where I'm from

Scary where I'm from this shit like Gotham City 
(Grrah, grrah, grrah, grrah, grrah)
