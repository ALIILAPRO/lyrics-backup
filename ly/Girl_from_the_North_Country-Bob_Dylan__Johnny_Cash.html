		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you're travelin' in the north country fair
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
Remember me to one who lives there
Oh, she once was a true love of mine

See for me if her hair's hanging down
It curls and falls all down her breast
See for me that her hair's hanging down
That's the way I remember her best

If you go when the snowflakes falls
When the rivers freeze and summer ends
Please see for me if she's wearing a coat so warm
To keep her from the howlin' winds

If you're travelin' in the north country fair
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
Please say "hello" to the one who lives there
Oh she was once a true love of mine

If you're travelin' in the north country fair
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
Remember me to one who lives there
Oh, she once was a true love of mine

A true love of mine
A true love of mine
True love of mine
A true love of mine
A true love of mine
She was once a true love of mine
