		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Time is moving
With situations I'm not choosing
And we both wanna say I'm sorry
For something that we cannot stop
You've been alright
You're losing time for me and our fights
So I'm done writing for you, baby
Now this gon' be the last I got

I'm losing the person I was when I found you
Am I acting different when I'm not around you?
I'm being dramatic, I say that I'm losing
I wanna show you all the things I've been doing
I'm going on dates and I'm hanging my head
I wanna share an apartment, a room and a bed
I want to tell you I love you but I cannot reach you
I'm learning to lose, that's the thing they don't teach you

Can't take you home
You have shown that you won't go
So I'll go all by myself
And when I try someone else

I'll still miss you
I'll miss you, help me through
When I try someone else, I'll still miss you
I'll miss you, help me through, when I'm
