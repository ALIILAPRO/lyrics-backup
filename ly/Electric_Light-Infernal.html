		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  People tell me I'm far too obsessed but they don't
Understand how it feels to be me and I won't
Be told by others what I shouldn't like
I just feel right when I let myself go
It can feel me with pride and excitement inside
Such a thrill to be filled with the joy and delight
How could anyone not feel the same?
Oh, they don't see...

That there is something on my mind
It is a world they leave behind
And it will always draw me closer
I want electric light
That flashes away
I want my heels sky high
I can't run away
And I say uhh, ahh and baby come play
And I know just why I wanna stay
'Cause on a disco night everything is all right

All the time I pretend to be into something
That I don't really like or connect with at all
Just to please someone's credible mind
But that ain't me
'Cause in my heart I'm someone else
And it's been true since I was twelve
And baby now I'm singing my song.
I want electric light...
