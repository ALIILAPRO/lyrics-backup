		<p>
		  Let me tell you to try
What did you tell you
Another day goes by
Tell me why does
So this is why
We're falling down

The...

I am the chosen next in line
Sent to slaughter your mankind
Rip the souls, born to die
No reason for you to fight

What is this for?
I to say
And we leave

I am the chosen next in line
Send to slaughter your mankind
Rip the souls, born to die
No reason for you to try

I am the chosen next in line
Send to slaughter your mankind
Rip the souls, born to die
No reason for you to try
