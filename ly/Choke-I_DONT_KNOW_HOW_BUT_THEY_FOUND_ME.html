		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Stop, drop
And drag me into place
And lock the fire escapes
I'll break your pretty face
(Yeah, yeah)

Oh, you clever little things
The sycophantic teens
What a precious basket case
(Yeah, yeah)

Now shut your dirty mouth
If I could burn this town
I wouldn't hesitate
To smile while you suffocate and die
And that would be just fine
And what a lovely time
That it would surely be
So bite your tongue
And choke yourself to sleep
(Yeah, yeah)

You get everything you want
And money always talks
To the idiot savants
(Yeah, yeah)

Now shut your dirty mouth
If I could burn this town
I wouldn't hesitate
To smile while you suffocate and die
And that would be just fine
And what a lovely time
That it would surely be
So bite your tongue
And choke yourself to sleep

Now shut your dirty mouth
If I could burn this town
I wouldn't hesitate
To smile while you suffocate and die
And that would be just fine, oh!
And what a lovely time
That it would surely be
So bite your tongue
And choke yourself

(Yeah, yeah)
