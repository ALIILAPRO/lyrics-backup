		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Woke up on a good day
And the world was wonderful
A midnight summer dream had me in its spell

I dreamt about an old man
Sat and watched the rain all night
He couldn't sleep a wink as all the drops fell

He told me of the beauty
Hidden in our foreheads
He told me of the ugliness
We show instead

And when we put a foot wrong do we learn
From all the pain
A midnight summer dream as he watched the rain

Then at midnight he poured another drink
And bent my ear
After midnight we sat up half the night
Or maybe more
And he began to tell me what it was all for

I woke up in an armchair
He had gone I don't know where
Left me there to sit and look at the rain

Don't remember much at all
But his words were echoing
A midnight summer dream and then wake again

Maybe I'll never find him
Maybe he's gone forever
Maybe I'll have to sit here
Watching the weather

One thing's pretty certain helped me
Make it in the night
Showed me somewhere else between wrong and right

And at midnight if you can't sleep
Then I can bend your ear
After midnight we'll sit up half the night
Or maybe more
And I'll begin to tell you what it is all for

Wake up on a good day
And the world feels wonderful
Midnight summer dream has me in its spell.
