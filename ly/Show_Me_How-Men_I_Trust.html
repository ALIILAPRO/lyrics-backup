		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Show me how you care
Tell me how you loved before
Show me how you smile
Tell me why your hands are cold
(Show me how)

I'm turning around, I'm having visions of you
Then I understand
The friend I'm dreaming of is far away
But I'm here, I'm here

Show me how you're proud
Tell me how you reach the moon
My thoughts err away tonight
My heart fell to love again
(Show me how)

I'm turning around, I'm having visions of you
Then I understand
The friend I'm dreaming of is far away
And doesn't feel my love
But I do
I do
