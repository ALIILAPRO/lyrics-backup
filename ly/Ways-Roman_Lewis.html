		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There are four ways to look at life
Love, lust, addiction, strife
The first two no I don't mind
But the last two ain't hard to find
          
If you look to the left to the right 
There are several ways 
Only one night
But things as they stand 
Won't get out of hand
Quite as much as I would like 
          
So I drink some shit,
I don't like the taste
Singing songs that I secretly hate
I'm not thinking 
Spiked but I liked it 
The rush didn't fight it
No I just felt high from 
           
This dopamine from that ketamine 
In my head while I ride in a limousine 
And at first it was riding through movie scenes 
But the tripping then stopped and then shit could not be more real
           
Thigh to thigh
Face to face
Time it flies 
My heart it races
Laces come undone 
I trip you're there to pick me up 
           
A dance ? You down ? 
It could be fun
She said alright
We danced all night 
She showed me shit that my mama wouldn't like 
But then she walked away so I took her aside 
           
Saying leave or believe me 
No you're not easy
But that won't slow me down 
No no no
           
I will perceive 
Until you come clean
And say that you love me too
Tonight it's me and you
          
Take my hand 
The world is just a ride away 
          
My demand
Tonight we do it my way
          
Understand 
Tomorrow we'll dream of yesterday 
           
Cos you never know how things will go 
Cos things they might just go our way
           
Now autumn, my heart it falls  
Still standing on all fours
Neglectful of any laws 
These remedies are for a good cause 
           
Depression you mentioned this one time 
But you said it was fun if pills were prescribed 
Well I'm just hung up on that one time
I fell in love with how you fell out of line
           
So I'll call you up once again
Answer phone my old friend
Maybe this time you'll pick up by the end
           
Saying leave or believe me 
No you're not easy
But that won't slow me down 
No no no
          
I will perceive 
Until you come clean
And say that you love me too
Tonight it's me and you
           
Take my hand 
The world is just a ride away 
           
My demand
Tonight we do it my way
           
Understand 
Tomorrow we'll dream of yesterday 
           
Cos you never know how things will go 
Cos things could still just go our way
           
Heartbreak comes
Heartbreak goes
But the latter won't come to a close
          
Heartbreak comes
Heartbreak goes
           
Saying leave or believe me 
No you're not easy
But that won't slow me down 
No no no
           
I will perceive 
Until you come clean
And say that you love me too
Tonight it's me and you
           
Take my hand 
The world is just a ride away 
          
My demand
Tonight we do it my way
           
Understand 
Tomorrow we'll dream of yesterday 
          
Cos you never know how things will go 
Cos things they might just go our way
          
But that's just one of many ways
