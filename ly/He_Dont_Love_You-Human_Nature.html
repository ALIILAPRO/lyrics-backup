		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  He don't love you, no

If I was your man
I'd be here every day
And if I was your man
I wouldn't treat you that way
He's never home
He never calls
How can you tell me he's yours?
If I was him
And you were mine
Girl you'd know it for sure

If you were my girl
I'd give you it all
Why can't you see he's faking?

He don't love you, no
But he don't want anyone else to have you
He don't want to let go
So baby tell me why you
Let him treat you so
When I would do anything to have you
Make your mind up
What you want to do
He don't love you
No

Oh
Tell me
Do you know his friends?
Girl do you know the score?
Don't you think its strange
They don't know who you are?
He takes you out
To somewhere new
Then he leaves you alone
And if you talk
To anyone
Then he tells you to go

You forgive him then
He does it again
Tell me how long will you take it?

He don't love you, no
(He don't love you)
But he don't want anyone else to have you
He don't want to let go
(Don't want to let go)
So baby tell me why you
Let him treat you so
When I would do anything to have you
Make your mind up
(Make your mind up)
What you want to do
He don't love you
No

Make your mind up
What you want to do
He don't love you
Make your mind up
What you want to do
(Make your mind up
What you want to do)
Make your mind up
What you want to do
He don't (He don't)
Love you
Make your mind up
What you want to do
(Make your mind up
What you want to do)

If you were my girl
I'd give you it all
Why can't you see that he's faking?
Oh yeah

Make your mind up
What you want to do
He don't love you
No

He don't love you, no
But he don't want anyone else to have you
He don't want to let go
So baby tell me why you
Let him treat you so
'Cause I would do anything to have you
Make your mind up
What you want to do
He don't love you
No
