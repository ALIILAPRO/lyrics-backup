		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We don't walk anywhere
Where lacks shadows, we don't dare
We walk between spiders
We live in love with darkness

And we want skeleton dance
And we need skeleton dance
Witches, bats, and spiders
In trance, communing in darkness

We're not alone
We have no fear
As soon as the full moon light is near
You may find us when the sunlight is away
We live in love with darkness

We don't walk anywhere
Where lacks shadows, we don't dare,
You may find us when the sunlight is away
We live in love with darkness

And we want skeleton dance
And we need skeleton dance
Witches, bats and spiders
In trance, communing in darkness

And we want skeleton dance
And we need skeleton dance
You may find us when the sunlight is away
In trance, communing in darkness
