		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You lift me up when I am down
You place my feet on solid ground
Cuz you take broken pieces
Turn them to masterpieces
All I gotta do is ask you Jesus
And you just give so freely
And when I'm feeling lonely
Come put your spirit on me
I got a testimony
God your my one and only
I get my joy directly from the source
Directly from the Lord
Protecting me from storms
I get my peace directly from the source
Directly from the Lord
That's why I'm lifting up my voice
I need that power
Rain down on me like showers
And hours feel like minutes in your presence
This feels just like heaven to me
I see them forming the weapon
But it wont stop me from dancing
I spend some time in His presence
He took my life and he blessed it
I don't know why he blessed
I just know that I'm thankful
Never take it for granted
I get my joy directly from the source
Directly from the Lord
Protecting me from storms
I get my peace directly from the source
Directly from the Lord
That's why I'm lifting up my voice
I don't wanna take a step without you
I don't wanna go anywhere that you wont go
I wanna be in your will
I wanna be in your presence
I wanna be
Gotta go where the spirit direct me
Cant afford to be out here fleshy
No thank you respectfully
I'ma get it from the source directly
No thank you respectfully
I'ma get it from the source directly
Gotta go where the spirit direct me
Cant afford to be out here fleshy no no
Why would I go anywhere else
When you got everything i need
Why would i search anywhere else
When everything I need is right in front of me
I get my joy directly from the source
Directly from the Lord
Protecting me from storms
I get my peace directly from the source
Directly from the Lord
That's why I'm lifting up my voice
Break break break it down now
Break break break it down now
Break break break it down now
Break break break it down now
How low can you go?
How low can you go for Jesus?
How low can you go?
How low can you go for Jesus?
Break break break it down now
Break break break it down now
Break break break it down now
Break break break it down now
Get get get low now
Get get get low now
Get get get low now
