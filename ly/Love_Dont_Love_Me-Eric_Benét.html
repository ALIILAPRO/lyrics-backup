		<p>
		  Mmm, hmm 
Mmm, hmm 
Mmm, hmm 
Yeah.ooh 
Yeah.ooh 
Yeah.ooh 
Uh, uh, mmm, hmm 

Time 
I still don't know the reason after all this time 
I'm all alone but see it comes as no surprise 
It seems like I go left each time that love goes right 
Every time 

By chance 
Somethin' happens every time I get a chance 
I feel the rhythm but I just don't know the dance 
I want to move with you but something holds me back 
Holds me back, yeah 

All I ever needed I could never find 
All I ever wanted was to get it right 
Somebody tell me what is wrong with me 
I wasn't sure, but I know now 
I believe that it must be (Must be) 
Love don't love me 
Love don't love me 

Oh, I 
I know exactly what is missing in my life 
Something for sure and something real, maybe a wife 
But then I'm out the door before the morning light 
Every night 

So I pray 
I'm so afraid I'm always gonna feel this way 
Relationships only to pass the time away 
Fear of commitment is a habit hard to break 
I must say, yeah 

All I ever needed I could never find 
All I ever wanted was to get it right (Get it right) 
Somebody tell me what is wrong with me (Wrong with me) 
I wasn't sure, but I know now 
I believe (I believe) that it must be (It must be) 
Love don't love me (Hey) 
Love don't love me (Don't love me) 

All I ever wanted was some happiness (Happiness) 
Take it to a level that's above the rest 
I want to know how it's supposed to be 
I want to feel something real 
But I believe (I believe) that it must be (It must be) 
Love don't love me (Love don't love me) 
Love don't love me (No, no, it don't love me) 

Someone teach my heart to fall in love again 
That all I have to fear is fear itself 
I know that I was born to love one woman 
But why must I keep runnin' through the rest, oh 

Yeah 
Yeah.ooh 
Yeah.ooh 
Yeah.ooh 
Uh, uh, mmm, oh, all I ever need 

All I ever needed I could never find (Oh..) 
All I ever wanted was to get it right (Hey) 
Somebody tell me what is wrong with me (Tell me please) 
I wasn't sure, but I know now 
I believe (I believe ) that it must be (It must be) 
Love don't love me (Love don't love me) 
Love don't love me (Love don't love me) 

All I ever wanted (Hey) was some happiness (Oh) 
Take it to a level that's above the rest (That higher place) 
I want to know how it's supposed to be 
I want to feel something real 
But I believe that it must be 
Love don't love me (Oh) 
Love don't love me (Ho) 

All I ever needed I could never find (I could never find) 
All I ever wanted was to get it right (Just to get it right) 
Somebody tell me what is wrong with me (Oh, oh) 
I wasn't sure, but I know now (Oh, oh) 
I believe that it must be (Yeah) 
Love don't love me (Love don't love me) 
Love don't love me (Love don't love me) 

All I ever wanted was some happiness (Oh) 
Take it to a level that's above the rest (Hey) 
I want to know how it's supposed to be 
I want to feel something real (I) 
But I believe that it must be (Oh) 
Love don't love me 
Love don't love me
