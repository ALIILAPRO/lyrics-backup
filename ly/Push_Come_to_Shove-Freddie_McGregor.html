		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tired of taking the blame
Might just well play the game
Oh, oh, sometimes it can be so unfair

I'm a longing to see you
I wanna know how you've been doing
Oh my young girl

I'm gonna catch this flight
And when I reach my destination
I hope you'll be smiling
Longing to see me

I thought you'd drop me a line
Just to say hello my dear
I'm doing fine

Doesn't matter anyway now
'Cause my love for you will never change
Tell me what you're doing right now 'cause

When push comes to shove
Everybody gonna put the blame
The blame on me
For loving you
For loving you

When, when, when push comes to shove
Everybody gonna put the blame
The blame on me, oh, oh, see?

I had your number in my diary
But as soon as I get home
It has been changed

I'm not playing any games
I wanna know if what we have still remains the same
Tell me right now 'cause I wanna know if

When push comes to shove
Everybody gonna put the blame
The blame on me
I'm tired of taking the blame for loving you

When, when, when push comes to shove
Everybody gonna put the blame
The blame on me
Said I'm loving you
It's a love that's true

Telling you my darling
This is not an easy game

I'm a longing to see you
I wanna know how you've been doing
Oh my young girl

I'm gonna catch this flight
And when I reach my destination
I hope you'll be smiling
Longing to see me

I thought you'd drop me a line
Just to say hello my dear
I'm doing fine
Doesn't matter anyway now 'cause

When push comes to shove
Everybody gonna put the blame
The blame on me
I'm tired of taking the blame
For something that I didn't do, ya

Push comes to shove
Everybody gonna put the blame
The blame on me
For loving you
They wanna know if it's a love that's true

Push comes to shove
Everybody gonna put the blame
The blame on me
Oh well
