		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Time went slowly
But then it hit me 'round the head
I'm not quite over this just yet
I thought I'd let go gently
But I've been holding on too tight
And it still keeps me up at night
It isn't right
It's not healthy
To stay home, stay for so long
When you don't feel like you belong
Because I have these memories
Some got lost along with time
Some still linger in my mind
It's hard to find
Somewhere to go
But I just wanted you to know that I've gone home
Can you hear me?
Tell me that you feel it too
Do you still know me
Like you used to do?
Nobody loves me like you used to do
Nobody loved me like you used to do
Do you still need me
Like you used to do?
I've seen colors
Shining from the other side
When they're close enough, they're blinding
And they tug you under
Show you what you left behind
Until you slowly realize
You're never fine
A taste of gold
But I just wanted you to know that I've gone home
Can you hear me?
Tell me that you feel it too
Do you still know me
Like you used to do?
Nobody loves me like you used to do
Nobody loved me like you used to do
Do you still need me
Like you used to do?
No, no, no, no, no, nobody
Nobody loves me like you used to do
No, no, no, no, no, nobody
Nobody loves me like you used to do
Can you hear me?
Tell me that you feel that too
Do you still know me
Like you used to do?
Nobody loves me like you used to do
Nobody loved me like you used to do
Do you still need me
Like you used to do?
