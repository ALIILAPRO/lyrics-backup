		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Let me bleed out)
(Leave me open) (open)

I'm a shipwreck
Lying in the bottom of the ocean
I can't handle my emotions
I'ma chase those fuckers anyway
Lipstick
All she left and now I'm antisocial
I'ma gamble my devotion
For these cheap thrills any day

I don't want your medication, no
I don't need your education
Jetset life is only gonna drive me crazy
I won't change it
On my deathbed you're only gonna hear me say

Don't fix me
Let me bleed out
Leave me open (open)
No, don't fix me
Maybe I was born to be broken
I'm dead inside (I'm dead inside)
And it's alright (and it's alright)
So don't fix me (don't fix me)
Don't fix me

People wanna healthy diet
And a peaceful climate and a house to hide in
Last night I lost my driver's license
To a girl who said she was Miley Cyrus
Oh damn, I'm on autopilot
I'm a broken hearted starving artist
Going through a crisis, empty pockets
Ain't nobody gonna tell me about what life is

I don't need your diagnosis, no
You can keep your love and roses
Violent popper on his way to see a doctor
I got drugged, woke up in Compton
I thought fuck it, it's just rock'n'roll

Don't fix me
Let me bleed out
Leave me open (open)
No, don't fix me
Maybe I was born to be broken
I'm dead inside (I'm dead inside)
And it's alright (and it's alright)
So don't fix me (don't fix me)
Don't fix me

(I'm dead inside)
(And it's alright)
(I'm dead inside)

Don't fix me
Let me bleed out
Leave me open
No, don't fix me
Maybe I was born to be broken
I'm dead inside
And it's alright (it's alright)
So don't fix me (don't fix me)
Don't fix me
