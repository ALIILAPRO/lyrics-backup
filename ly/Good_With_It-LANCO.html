		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Long day, work sucks, baby, I know it
But my truck is gassed up and ready to go 
If you're up, then I'm down 
If you're good, then I'm good with it

We're gettin' lost out in the country 
I found us a spot that's right on the money
I'm missing the view watching you 
But you're good with it 

With that gold sun sinking 
And this cold one I'm drinking 
Got me thinking that life don't get no better than this
There's a slow song playing 
And my tailgate's waiting 
And I hope that you know that you go so 
Good with it
So good, so good, so good, so good
So good, so good, so good
Yeah, I hope that you know that you go so good with it

Yeah you and me are fire and smoke
But we're meant to be like whiskey and coke
And this night is just right 
But your kiss would go good with it 

With that gold sun sinking 
And this cold one I'm drinking 
Got me thinking that life don't get no better than this
There's a slow song playing 
And my tailgate's waiting 
And I hope that you know that you go so 
Good with it
So good, so good, so good, so good
So good, so good, so good
Yeah, I hope that you know that you go so good with it

Yeah, with that gold sun sinking 
And this cold one I'm drinking 
Got me thinking that life don't get no better than this
There's a slow song playing 
And my tailgate's waiting 
And I hope that you know that you go so 
Good with it
So good, so good, so good, so good
So good, so good, so good
Yeah, I hope that you know that you go so good with it

So good, so good, so good
So good, so good, so good
So good, so good, so good
