		<p>
		  Thugger
The Thugger, baby
Young Metro, Young Metro, Young Metro
Metro!
Young Metro, Young Metro, Young Metro
And what?
Metro Boomin want some more, nigga

Sick
Shoot him in his back like Ricky but not Slick
Spent like 7 bands on a tri-colored pit
All my signs red like a stop, nigga no pit
Blow the purple, nigga, high like fuckin' martians, woah
In a foreign, yesterday I was just walkin', woah
Left my baby mama, now my bitch a Barbie, woah
All red Dickies suit, I'm ridin' down Slauson, woah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hercu-Hercules
Hercu-Hercules
Hercu-Hercules
Hercu-Hercules

I smoke gas, that's that Hercules, strong marijuana
She looked at him, oh now she watchin' me
Bitch likes my persona
Bitch I'm speedin' to that guapanese
Old Chevy mounted up, I can't forget the T
Drop the top, shoot birds at the officers
Fuck them boys, they costin' us, they stalkin' us
They know they old lady not runnin', they'll fall for us
We so tired of takin' loses, ain't no more chalkin' up
I swear, I promise
YSL on ape and they donkeys
These niggas pointless, they want me wanted
I'm still a stoner, MAC and cheese on me
These niggas clone me, I'm full, but I'm still hungry
Hey when the click clock, I'll make your bitch stop
Ice Inside my tick tock, boss cookies, no brisco
I just bought a Cuban link, flooded with big rocks
Bitches trying to juug at me? Well, I gotta get some, woah shit

Sick
Shoot him in his back like Ricky but not Slick
Spent like 7 bands on a tri-colored pit
All my signs red like a stop, nigga no pit
Blow the purple, nigga, high like fuckin' martians, woah
In a foreign, yesterday I was just walkin', woah
Left my baby mama, now my bitch a Barbie, woah
All red Dickies suit, I'm ridin' down Slauson, woah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hercu-Hercules
Hercu-Hercules
Hercu-Hercules
Hercu-Hercules

Okay first of all, I was doin' this shit 'fore I was rich
I don't care at all, I'll go do a dolphin for my clique
Fuck your conference call, pull up with a cheque and get my sig
Double D, you dig? No firework, it was lit
If there's a fuck nigga was hatin' on me
They took ya life and I know some fuck niggas waitin' on it
I grab that TEC, I grab that 40 and the F&N
Then we pulled up ready to squabble, yeah we waited on 'em
Anaconda, we on that slime stuff, here to remind ya
Fucked your old lady, she want the finest
YSL, we shinin', let her stand behind us
Yeah my crew we rock, rock, baby you can climb us
I call my migo, migo come and let me juug through the city
He stuffed it with burritos and he let 'em fly right to me
Bitches call me Casino but I let 'em ride 'round the city
She want bingo, kilo, no sweat, now she can ride in the Bentley

Sick
Shoot him in his back like Ricky but not Slick
Spent like 7 bands on a tri-colored pit
All my signs red like a stop, nigga no pit
Blow the purple, nigga, high like fuckin' martians, woah
In a foreign, yesterday I was just walkin', woah
Left my baby mama, now my bitch a Barbie, woah
All red Dickies suit, I'm ridin' down Slauson, woah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
