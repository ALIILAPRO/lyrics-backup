		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I recite the lies
To keep them in my head
She's standing next to me
Wishing I was dead

But she can't understand
What she meant

The thoughts you have to choose
The synchromatic blues
The people you adore in your terrible 22s
The ones she calls her friends

And she says

I'm interested in the thought of you
Do what you have to do
To make amends

Calling me back home in the afternoon
What's trust to you?
I can't comprehend

To pull me closer and drag me under
With one last breath
With all the power that you have over
My darling what did you expect

Is it the drugs kicking in are you there my love?
I can hear you round the corner
But I cannot lose you no more
The uncertainty when it's hard to breathe
And I can't stay long
And she's speaking to the words unsaid
The loneliness
When it makes it harder to stand
Trust me the air that I breathe ain't enough

And I have second thoughts
And though they seem adverse
She's screaming when it's better
Cause when it's betters when it's worse

Like when speaking out of turn
In false terms

And so the night it haunts
The memories lay there lost
And so I start to wonder
But I'm wondering at a cost

Hoping something stays forgot
As in what?

I pull her closer and drag her under the weight on top
With all the power I now have over
My darling I will never stop

How are the drugs kicking in can you my take my love?
I can hear you round the corner
But I cannot lose you no more
The uncertainty when it's hard to breathe
And I can't stay long
And she's speaking to the words unsaid
The loneliness
When it makes it harder to stand
Trust me the air that I breathe ain't enough

I know it's the end but is this just the feeling of longing I get when I'm feeling the same
I'm stuck in my ways but inside there is something that I want to feel when I finally change

I know there's nothing left to say

Are the drugs kicking in are you there my love?
(Are you there my love?)
I can hear you round the corner
But I cannot lose you no more
The uncertainty when it's hard to breathe
(Are you there my love?)
And I can't stay long
And she's speaking to the words unsaid
The loneliness
When it makes it harder to stand
Trust me the air that I breathe ain't enough
The air that I breathe ain't enough
