		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't help it when you make me feel this way
I can't help it when I don't know what to say
It's just that you make me speechless
You make me speechless
But you know I need you so badly
Baby you light up the night sky
We know how to make the time fly
We could go to the sunrise
There's no going back now
I can't help it when you make me feel this way
I can't help it when I don't know what to say
It's just that you make me speechless
You make me speechless
But you know I need you so badly
Baby you take my places
Inside of my head I chased it
You're rare now I won't waste it
There's no going back now
Hold me close
No one knows
What tomorrow holds
So Don't Let go
I can't help it when you make me feel this way
I can't help it when I don't know what to say
It's just that you make me speechless
You make me speechless
But you know I need you so badly
