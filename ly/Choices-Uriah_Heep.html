		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was walking all alone
Through a sideshow
With passion and pain
On each side
Something inside me was calling
For a chance to stay alive

At the time I didn't know
What was calling
As my head was buried in grief
Today I heard what was crying
My freedom calling me

And we all make our choices
Like a blind man feels his way
And the choice
I've made is simple
Passion over pain

When I got to
The end of the sideshow
And looked back
To where I had been
My eyes filled with
Teardrops of loneliness
For the ones
Who will never be fee

I thought of
The children in the sideshow
As they wandered
Around so confused
Some day
They'll make their decision
But which one will they choose

And we'll all make our choices
Like a blind man feels his way
And the choice
I've made is simple
Passion over pain

And we'll all make our choices
Like a blind man feels his way
And the choice
I've made is simple
Passion, passion over pain

And we'll all make our choices
Like a blind man feels his way
And the choice
I've made is a simple one
Passion over pain
