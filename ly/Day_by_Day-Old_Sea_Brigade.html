		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Time and time again, I think I'm falling through space
And I wake up in my bed just sweating in sheets
Remembering my name but it don't sound the same
Daylight come and save me from the 2 AM creeps

And I think of you growing old and it breaks my heart
And I think of you growing old and it breaks my heart

Hold me up again or I can count on the wall
Just a temporary panic that I can't seem to beat
Stranger in the mirror, his smile makes me shiver
He wears my features and grinds my teeth

And I think of you growing old and it breaks my heart
And I think of you growing old

Darkness, it comes and puts me in place
I'm a prisoner, babe, you know I can't escape
Take all you want, take all you can take
But the shadow of age is every step of the way
And it's day by day, it's all I can take of it
And it's day by day, it's all I can chase

Time and time again, I think I've pulled it together
But something's so familiar that's unraveling me
I'll forget my name, every evening's the same
Lying on my back just praying for sleep

And I think of you growing old and it breaks my heart
And I think of you growing old

Darkness, it comes and puts me in place
I'm a prisoner, babe, you know I can't escape
Take all you want, take all you can take
But the shadow of age is every step of the way
And it's day by day, it's all I can take of it
And it's day by day, it's all I can chase

And I think of you growing old and it breaks my heart
And I think of you growing old and it breaks my heart
And I think of you as the night grows cold and it breaks my heart
And I think of you growing old
