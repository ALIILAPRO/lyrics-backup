		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All my wolves, begin to howl
Wake me up, the time is now
Oh, can you hear the drumming?
Oh, there's a revolution coming

Wide awake, the fever burns
Sweat it out, wait my turn
Can you hear the drumming?
There's a revolution coming
All this doubt is creepin' in
Inside out, I shed my skin
Can you hear the drumming?
There's a revolution coming

I been waitin' all my life
To live, when I've only been dreaming
Get love when I've only been stealing
Can't let time keep passing me by
Run down what I've always been chasing
Black out every fear I've been facing

All my wolves, begin to howl
Wake me up, the time is now
Oh, can you hear the drumming?
Oh, there's a revolution coming
Wild things that turn me on
Drag my dark into the dawn
Oh, can you hear the drumming?
Oh, there's a revolution coming

Body aches, I'm bound in chains
Well there's a fire in my veins and
Can you hear the drumming?
There's a revolution coming
Like every king who lost a crown
And all those years are history now
Can you hear the drumming?
There's a revolution coming

I been waitin' all my life
Run down what I've always been chasing
Black out every fear I've been facing

All my wolves, begin to howl
Wake me up, the time is now
Oh, can you hear the drumming?
Oh, there's a revolution coming
Wild things that turn me on
Drag my dark into the dawn
Oh, can you hear the drumming?
Oh, there's a revolution coming

There's a revolution coming
There's a revolution coming
Oh, can you hear the drumming?
Oh, there's a revolution coming

I'm rising up, up from the ground
From the bottom, can't hold me down
Hold me down
I'm rising up, up from the ground
From the bottom, can't hold me down
Hold me down
Hold me down

All my wolves, begin to howl
Wake me up, the time is now
Oh, can you hear the drumming?
Oh, there's a revolution coming
Wild things that turn me on
Drag my dark into the dawn
Oh, can you hear the drumming?
Oh, there's a revolution coming

There's a revolution coming
There's a revolution coming
Oh, can you hear the drumming?
Oh, there's a revolution coming
There's a revolution coming
There's a revolution coming
Oh, can you hear the drumming?
Oh, there's a revolution coming
