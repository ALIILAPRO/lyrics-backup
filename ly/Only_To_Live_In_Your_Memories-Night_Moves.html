		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Keep it up
Tired eyes
Hotels
You and your dresses, the evening swells
I can tell
I've known you well
Everyone's known you well

White cuff
Diamond shoes
Falling out
You and your keys, what they sounded like
I don't know
How you feel
Only you live in your memories
Are you satisfied?

And you want love
In your right mind
And you want love in your right mind
Oh it's the right time and I held on
'Cause I feel love
And I held on
'Cause I feel love
It's the night time
In your right mind

You know you're satisfied
Ooh
Morning calls
Hiding me
Watching you
You oughta keep up to never lose
In my heart I always love your eyes

And you want love
In your right mind
And you want love
In your right mind
Oh it's the right time and I held on
'Cause I feel love
And I held on
'Cause I feel love
It's the night time

Ooh, but are you satisfied?
Ooh, but are you satisfied?
In your right mind

You know you're satisfied
