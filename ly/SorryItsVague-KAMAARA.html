		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Think I'm too scared of the spotlight
Think I'm too scared for a night light
Tell me why we wait at the wrong time
Tell me why you stare, it's a white line
Tell me why you here? Yuh
Tell me why you care? Yuh
Are you even there? Yuh
Are we even there? Yuh

Think I'm too scared of the spotlight
Think I'm too scared for a night light
Tell me why we wait at the wrong time
Tell me why you stare, it's a white line
Tell me why you here? Yuh
Tell me why you care? Yuh
Are you even there? Yuh
Are we even there? Yuh
