		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been ignoring this big lump in my throat
I shouldn't be crying, tears were for the weaker days
I'm stronger now, or so I say
But something's missing

Whatever it is
It feels like it's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror
Whatever it is
It's just laughing at me
And I just wanna scream

What now? 
I just can't figure it out
What now? 
I guess I'll just wait it out (wait it out)
What now? 
Oh-oh-oh-oh, what now?

I found the one, he changed my life
But was it me that changed
And he just happened to come at the right time
I'm supposed to be in love
But I'm numb again

Whatever it is
It feels like it's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror
Whatever it is
It's just sitting there laughing at me
And I just wanna scream

What now?
I just can't figure it out
What now?
I guess I'll just wait it out (wait it out)
What now? 
Please tell me
What now?

There's no one to call, 'cause I'm just playing games with them all
The more I swear I'm happy, the more that I'm feeling alone
'Cause I spend every hour just going through the motions
I cant even get the emotions to come out
Dry as a bone, but I just wanna shout

What now?
I just can't figure it out
What now?
I guess I'll just wait it out (wait it out)
What now?
Somebody tell me
What now?

I don't know where to go
I don't know what to feel
I don't know how to cry
I don't know why
I don't know where to go
I don't know what to feel
I don't know how to cry
I don't know why
I don't know where to go
I don't know what to feel
I don't know how to cry
I don't know why

So what now?
