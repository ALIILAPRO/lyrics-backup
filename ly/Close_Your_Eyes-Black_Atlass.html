		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The time's lyin' lately (lately)
I'm missin' you like crazy (crazy)
I can't be complacent
I'll try 'til my days end

So can you
Promise I'll stay in your mind? (Your mind)
When I ride back to the West side (west side)
Baby, promise I'll stay in your mind (your mind)
I'll meet you there tonight (tonight)

Close your eyes (close your eyes)
Let me come and find you in the dark (close your eyes, close your eyes)
Close your eyes (close your eyes)
Baby I can read between your scars (close your eyes, close your eyes)

Down for love, I can't fake it (fake it)
I been caught up but I'll make it (make it)
I was holdin' onto the pieces that I found
'Til you came around
Nothing left if I can't have you now (now)

So can you
Promise I'll stay in your mind? (Your mind)
When I ride back to the West side (west side)
Baby, promise I'll stay in your mind (your mind)
I'll meet you there tonight (tonight)

Close your eyes (close your eyes)
Let me come and find you in the dark (close your eyes, close your eyes)
Close your eyes (close your eyes)
Baby I can read between your scars (close your eyes, close your eyes)

So can you
Promise I'll stay in your mind? (Your mind)
When I ride back to the West side (west side)
Baby, promise I'll stay in your mind (your mind)
I'll meet you there tonight (tonight)

Close your eyes, close your eyes, close your eyes
Close your eyes, close your eyes, close your eyes
