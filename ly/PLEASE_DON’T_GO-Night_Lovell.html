		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got pain but I'm walking with a blank face
Shawty playing but she know she in the right place
I'm just saying I don't wanna leave the house today, it's raining
Bitch you know me, bitch you know me
Pay attention to the shit you can and can't say
Count my last days, bitch I'm dying slowly
Take my hand, say the plan 'cause I'm banned from this planet
Bitch you know me
Bitch you know me, ay

I'm so numb and the air so cold
Didn't wanna lie to you, please don't go
I'm a fucking Devil, nigga I already know
Break this fucking phone then away I go
I'm so dumb with the way she be
At the same time it's because of me
Girl I see I'm the one with the key, huh, huh

I don't got no time to really play with her
Hit that pussy from the back, I think I came in her
Walking 'round the crib this bitch ain't got no shame in her
Picture perfect like I'm in a fucking game, nigga
Wish I saw you show your face but I'm blind now
But I know I'm fucking with a different kind now
Call me crazy but my life's under light now
Run the lights if they pull on the side now, ay

I'm so numb and the air so cold
Didn't wanna lie to you, please don't go
I'm a fucking devil, nigga I already know
Break this fucking phone then away I go
I'm so dumb with the way she be
At the same time it's because of me
Girl I see I'm the one with the key
