		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Some girls get all done up, lose their face to repair
They attend every party, but it's taking them nowhere
Some think it's funny, say they don't even care
But on the inside, they wish they were there

What have we come to now?
We all wanna be like the rest
Can't describe just how
But we're all a beautiful mess

One moment, we're broken and then we're fine
He called you back? Wait, wasn't he mine?
One moment, we're broken and then we're fine
Lost in the puzzle of the teenage mind

Some boys make the trouble and think they're all it
Constantly in company or thrown to the ditch
And some are just there to have a good time
Ignoring every bit of drama and each little lie

Yeah, what have we come to now?
We all wanna be like the rest
Can't describe just how
But we're all a beautiful mess

One moment, we're broken and then we're fine
He called you back? Wait, wasn't he mine?
One moment, we're broken and then we're fine
Lost in the puzzle of the teenage mind

What have we come to now?
Can't describe just how

One moment, we're broken and then we're fine
They said hello, but missed goodbye
We are all insane inside
And no one's gonna figure out the teenage mind
