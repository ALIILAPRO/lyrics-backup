		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The curtains are closed now
Nothing to see
But a dozen dying roses at our feet
Your timing is perfect
Ironic to me
Showing up the moment that you shouldn't be

Last time I checked
You're the one that left
Last words you said
That you couldn't care less

It's funny how you miss me more than you could ever love me
How you couldn't give me everything and now you want it from me
Yeah, it's funny how it's different now that I got somebody
Yeah it's funny
Ooh

Yeah it's funny, funny, funny, how you answer, answer, answer
'Cause his lips seem, lips seem, lips seem, both my hands are on his body
Yeah it's funny how it's different now that I got somebody
Yeah it's funny
Ooh

Sending a message
Through mutual friends
It's like I'm talking to you using them
You heard I was happy
And I heard you're not
I guess freedom didn't free you like you thought

Last time I checked
You're the one that left
Last words you said
That you couldn't care less

It's funny how you miss me more than you could ever love me
How you couldn't give me everything and now you want it from me
Yeah, it's funny how it's different now that I got somebody
Yeah it's funny
Ooh

Yeah it's funny, funny, funny, how you answer, answer, answer
'Cause his lips seem, lips seem, lips seem, both my hands are on his body
Yeah it's funny how it's different now that I got somebody
Yeah it's funny
Ooh

It's funny how you miss me more than you could ever love me
How you couldn't give me everything and now you want it from me
Yeah, it's funny how it's different now that I got somebody
Yeah it's funny (yeah it's funny)
Ooh

Yeah, it's funny how you're calling couldn't answer if I wanted
'Cause his lips are on my lips and both my hands are on his body
Yeah it's funny how it's different now that I got somebody
Yeah it's funny
Ooh

Yeah it's funny, funny, funny, how you answer, answer, answer
'Cause his lips seem, lips seem, lips seem, both my hands are on his body
Yeah, it's funny how it's different now that I got somebody
Yeah it's funny
Ooh

Who's laughing now?
Who's laughing now?
Ooh

Who's laughing now?
Who's laughing now?
Ooh
