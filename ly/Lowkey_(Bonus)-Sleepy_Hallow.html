		  (Great John on the beat, by the way)
Nah, loyalty and love is different
Loyalty is some shit, like, you gotta see
Love, people throw that shit around a lot
People throw that shit around
I don't think nobody even knows what that shit means no more
Hmm, look

I liked it better when we was lowkey
Now you're tellin' all your friends that I'm different, ain't the old me
Takin' these drugs, I'm 'bout to O-D
Can't tell me that you're loyal or you love, gotta show me
Locked up in pain and you my Co-D
For all the times that we waste, we gon' need some matchin' rollies
Girl, would you ride if it's a stoley?
Girl, would you ride if it's a-, look

Girl, I got some bad luck with love, so don't judge
You say you the one, so that makes two of us
You know I got some problems, I don't really trust
Took a lil' minute for my heart to adjust
I know you got some problems, you don't really trust
You don't wanna be the one to fall for a scrub
But it ain't what it was, it is what it is
Love it when I pull up, but you hate it when I dip
So you mad when I dip, we gon' take a trip
Vacation, thousand miles from the crib
Remember when you told me that you wish you would've quit
Said you wasn't fuckin' with me, threw a whole fit
I was runnin' to a bag, told me stay up out the mix
She know I be stressin' 'cause my brothers in the bricks
You know how I'm livin', so I gotta take risks
Think I'm with some bitch, but I'm probably makin' hits

I liked it better when we was lowkey
Now you're tellin' all your friends that I'm different, ain't the old me
Takin' these drugs, I'm 'bout to O-D
Can't tell me that you're loyal or you love, gotta show me
Locked up in pain and you my Co-D
For all the times that we waste, we gon' need some matching rollies
Girl, would you ride if it's a stoley?
Girl, would you ride if it's a-, look

Every time I'm in a jam, you the one that I call
Pass my assist on the court, we gon' ball
Got a call from the gang, said they finna break the law
Know I gotta go, know I gotta get involved
Break up, make up, we done been through it all
Call before I walk, stood ten toes tall
Even if we fall apart, both left a mark
Last one I'm lovin', after that it's fuck 'em all
I'm the best in the league, Mike Jordan
She gon' make it bounce, like Spalding
I know what she need, ice water
Cool it down, she been actin' out of order
Actin' like she leavin', but she can't
Said her heart won't let her take the chance
She be actin' like she leavin', but she can't
Nuh-uh, won't let her take the chance

I liked it better when we was lowkey
Now you're tellin' all your friends that I'm different, ain't the old me
Takin' these drugs, I'm 'bout to O-D
Can't tell me that you're loyal or you love, gotta show me
Locked up in pain and you my Co-D
For all the times that we waste, we gon' need some matching rollies
Girl, would you ride if it's a stoley?
Girl, would you ride if it's a-
