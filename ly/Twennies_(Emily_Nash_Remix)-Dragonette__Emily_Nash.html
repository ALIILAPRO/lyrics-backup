		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Turn down for what?
You throw me back like 2014
All that attention in the end is a distortion

The more I get it, the less I want it, the more I get it
The more I get it, the less I want it, the more I get it
The more I get it, the less I want it, the more I get it

Baby, we'll never make it, I'm too cool to try
Drag me into the twennies, I'm too cool to try

The more I get it, the less I want it, the more I get it
The more I get it, the less I want it, the more I get it

Losing my amusement with the audience engagement
Come in like a cannon, supernova my Oasis

The more I get it, the less I want it, the more I get it
The more I get it, the less I want it, the more I get it

Baby, we'll never make it, I'm too cool to try
Drag me into the twennies, I'm too cool to try

The more I get it, the less I want it, the more I get it

The more I get it, the less I want it, the more I get it
The more I get it, the less I want it, the more I get it
The more I get it, the less I want it, the more I get it
The more I get it, the less I want it, the more I get it
