		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You put something better inside of me,
You put something better inside of me.

I could look out the window or stare at the wall,
But really it didn't matter, no, I just didn't care at all.
Could be sitting by the water, counting every stone,
Cause nothing means nothing when you're empty and on your own.

[Chorus]
But you put something better inside of me,
You put something better inside of me.
Makes me so much stronger,
I'm amazed at the change in me.

Well, I knew what I was doing, I was running away,
Busy going nowhere, just wasting the time of day.
Walking down the road, kicking up the stones,
Nothing means nothing when you're empty and on your own.

[Chorus]
