		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Playing cool makes me lose my mind
I can't be someone I don't recognize
I'm not the type to have to say it twice
Or wait for you 'til the end of the night

I've been falling fast and you don't seem to move
But is it worse for me if I tell the truth?
And are you just a poison that I shouldn't use?
Wish I could say to you what I can't say to you

We could take it slower
Wait until we're older
But I might be somebody
You might not even know her
I'm going through changes
It's a roller-coaster
But I might be somebody
You might not even know her
We could take it slower
We could take it slower

Who knows who I'll be tomorrow
But I hope that you still like her the same
We might end up strangers somehow
You should get to know me today

I've been falling fast and you don't seem to move
But is it worse for me if I tell the truth?
And are you just a poison that I shouldn't use?
Wish I could say to you what I can't say to you

We could take it slower
Wait until we're older
But I might be somebody
You might not even know her
I'm going through changes
It's a roller-coaster
But I might be somebody
You might not even know her
We could take it slower
We could take it slower

I've been falling fast and you don't seem to move
But is it worse for me if I tell the truth?
And are you just a poison that I shouldn't use?
Wish I could say to you what I can't say to you

We could take it slower
Wait until we're older
But I might be somebody
You might not even know her
I'm going through changes
It's a roller-coaster
But I might be somebody
You might not even know her
We could take it slower
We could take it slower
