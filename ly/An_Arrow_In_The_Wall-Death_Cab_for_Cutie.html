		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My heart runs on gasoline vapors
The thousand drums waking up the neighbors
But I can feel the fissures in the freeways
The rusted steel, deception in the handshakes
In the handshakes

An arrow in the wall, arrow in the wall
Take it as a warning
That you are gonna fall, you are gonna fall
Even if you're soaring
Take it as a warning

This machine was built to be broken
The strip mall teens were sniffing and swollen
And I could not run fast enough to flee them
There's more than one way to get your freedom
To get your freedom

An arrow in the wall, arrow in the wall
Take it as a warning
That you are gonna fall, you are gonna fall
Even if you're soaring
An arrow in the wall, arrow in the wall
Take it as a warning
That you are gonna fall, you are gonna fall
Even if you're soaring
Take it as a warning, take it as a warning
Take it as a warning, take it as a warning

An arrow in the wall, arrow in the wall
Take it as a warning
That you are gonna fall, you are gonna fall
Even if you're soaring
An arrow in the wall, arrow in the wall
Take it as a warning
That you are gonna fall, you are gonna fall
Even if you're soaring
Take it as a warning, take it as a warning
Take it as a warning, take it as a warning
