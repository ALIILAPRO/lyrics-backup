		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tired of going out, scared I'll run into you
All of these whereabouts, what is a girl to do?
Say no to everything I'm invited to
And I can't do that, no

I be in the section dolo, baby, oh
Working on self control, oh baby, no, oh
Finna get antisocial, no, yeah

Damn, you know I hate the club
But I came 'cause I knew you'd show up
Maybe if I drank enough
I'll make my way over to ya
Damn, you know I hate the club (oh, oh)
But I came 'cause I knew you'd show up
Maybe if I drank enough (oh, oh, drank enough, drank enough)
I'll make my way over to ya (I hate the club)

Your homegirl told me you would be here, uh
Besides you, ain't no one to see here
It's a Saturday, shoppin' in LA
Yeah, that's your shit
On the second floor, with your pants down low
Hanging off your hips

I walked out the section, dolo baby, oh
Lost all my self control, oh baby, oh, oh
You wanna get antisocial, baby?
We could head home, baby

Damn, you know I hate the club (oh, oh)
But I came 'cause I knew you'd show up
Maybe if I drank enough (oh, oh, drank enough, drank enough)
I'll make my way over to ya
Damn, you know I hate the club (oh, oh, I hate the club, oh woah)
But I came 'cause I knew you'd show up
(I came 'cause I knew you would show up)
Maybe if I drank enough (drank enough, drank enough)
I'll make my way over to ya (I hate the club)

Order another round and round and round
DJ saying my name
DJ shouting me out
Order another round and round and round
Drunk when I call you Monet
Beggin' you to walk me out

(Say) say you miss me, well, I need proof
I came all this way to see you
Every word you say is see-through (oh)
You be lying, baby, me too
(Would) would have to be with you to cheat you
You're a Taurus, let me feed you
So important, I still need you

Tired of going out, scared I'll run into you
(Tired of going out, scared I'll run into you)
Said I'm tired of going out, scared I'll run into you
(Tired of going out, scared I'll run into you)

Damn, you know I hate the club (oh woah, oh, oh, oh, oh no)
But I came 'cause I knew you'd show up (uh)
Maybe if I drank enough (oh, oh, drank enough, drank enough)
I'll make my way over to ya
Damn, you know I hate the club (oh, oh, hate the club, ooh)
But I came 'cause I knew you'd show up (show up)
Maybe if I drank enough
(Maybe if I drank enough, oh woah, drank enough, drank enough)
I'll make my way over to ya (I hate the club)
