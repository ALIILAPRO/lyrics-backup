		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So I'm waiting for this test to end
So these lighter days can soon begin
I'll be alone by maybe more carefree
Like a kite that floats so effortlessly

I was afraid to be alone
Now I'm scared that's how id like to be
All the faces none the same
How can there be so many personalities

So many lifeless empty hands
So many hearts in great demand
And now my sorrow seems to far away
Until I'm taken by these bults of pain

But I turn them off and tuck them away
Till these rainy days that make them stay
And then ill cry so hard to these sad songs
And the words still ring, once here now gone

And they echo through my head everyday
And I don't think they'll ever go away
Just like thinking of your childhood home
But we can't go back were on our own

Oh
But I'm about to give this one more shot
And find it in myself
I'll find it in myself

So were speeding towards that time of year
To the day that marks your not here
And I think ill want to be alone
So please understand that I don't answer the phone

I'll just sit and stare at my deep blue walls
Until I can see nothing at all
Only particles some fast some slow
All mys can see is all I know

Oh
But I'm about to give this one more shot
And find it in myself
I'll find it in myself
