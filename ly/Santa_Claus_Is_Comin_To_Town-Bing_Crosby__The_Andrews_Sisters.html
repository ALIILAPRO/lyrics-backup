		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You better watch out, you better not cry
You better not pout, I'm telling you why (why)
Santa Claus is comin' to town, gather all

He's making a list and checking it twice
He's gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town

He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake

You better watch out, you better not cry
You better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town

With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town

The kids in girls and boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland town all around the Christmas tree
You better watch out, you better not cry
You better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town

He sees you when you're sleepin'
And he knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake

You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town

You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin'

You mean, the big fat man with the long white beard
He's comin' to town
