		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Im sure you know it i just wanna be clear 
the sun shines whenever you are near to me 
you gave me life when i didnt want to be here 
cos i didnt want to be here no more 
your vibes like oxygen it keeps me alive 
and i dont fear the dark cos you are my light 
wihtout you im not sure i'd of survived 
So what would i do without you 
without you 
without you 
what would i do without you though 
without you 
without you 
its like the world stops turning when you're not around 
and then my heart still beats but its making no sound without you 
without you 
what would i do without you 
you, you 
See im no poet but i wrote you a rhyme 
i know im blessed cos i got you by my side 
when i look up and i see nothing but sky i remenisc on good times with you 
i'd also like to thank some and im sad that i cant 
cos youre not here no more youre up with the stars 
without your words wouldnt of made it this far
and im me beacuse you played a part 
So what would i do without you 
without you 
without you 
what would i do without you though 
without you 
without you 
its like the world stops turning when you're not around 
and then my heart still beats but its making no sound without you 
without you 
what would i do without you 
you, you
