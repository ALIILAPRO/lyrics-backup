		  Doomshop, motherfucka
Doomshop, motherfucka

Walk, walkin' down, you never notice me
Too, too geeked up, I cannot feel my body bleed
Where you bitches at? You done hit my phone
Bitch, you do not fuck with me, I know you're home

I see you creepin', see you tip, tip toe, toe through your house
Like a mouse, like a rodent, baby, come right here
Don't act weird, oh it's fear, man I understand
Freddie comin' up so quick, always on demand

Walk, walkin' down, you never notice me
Too, too geeked up, I cannot feel my body bleed
Walk, walkin' down, you never notice me
Too, too geeked up, I cannot feel my body bleed
Where you bitches at? You done hit my phone
Bitch, you do not fuck with me, I know you're home
Walk, walkin' down, you never notice me
Too, too geeked up, I cannot feel my body

Motherfucka, fucka
Motherfucka
Doomshop, motherfucka
Doomshop, motherfucka
Doomshop, motherfucka

Walk, walkin' down, you never notice me
Too, too geeked up, I cannot feel my body bleed
Where you bitches at? You done hit my phone
Bitch, you do not fuck with me, I know you're home

I see you creepin', see you tip, tip toe, toe through your house
Like a mouse, like a rodent, baby, come right here
Don't act weird, oh it's fear, man I underst
Freddie comin' up so quick, always on demand

Walk, walkin' down, you never notice me
Too, too geeked up, I cannot feel my body bleed
Walk, walkin' down, you never notice me
Too, too geeked up, I cannot feel my body bleed
