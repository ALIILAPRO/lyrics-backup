		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can you kiss me in the morning
Hold me tight in the evening
And tell me that it'll all be okay
Will you look me in the eye
'Cause I have secrets to confide
I want you to hear what I have to say
I find myself acting tough
And I try not to ask for much
'Cause what if I do the thing
That makes you run for good
But I know that I can't go on
Turning all of my feelings off
So here is a short and simple list
Of all that I want from you
Can you kiss me in the morning
Hold me tight in the evening
And tell me that it'll all be okay
Will you look me in the eye
'Cause I have secrets to confide
I want you to hear what I have to say
And buy me roses on Valentine's Day
'Cause this is how I was taught
Be glad for a little or a lot
But I'm learning that love is the safety
To ask for what you need
Can you kiss me in the morning
Hold me tight in the evening
And tell me that it'll all be okay
Will you look me in the eye
'Cause I have secrets to confide
I want you to hear what I have to say
Will you look me in the eye
When I feel like I might cry
I want you to wipe my tears away
And buy me roses on Valentine's Day
