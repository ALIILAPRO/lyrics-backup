		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're not the man who gave me everything 
I've ever wanted

You're not the man
Who stepped inside my life
And haunted every, every day

You're not the one
Who said he'd never leave
Couldn't breathe
And could not sleep without me
That was someone who you left behind
A long time ago

You're not the man
Who would bleed for me
You never shed a tear
You're not the one
Said he'd always be near

You're not the man
Who threw me a lifeline
And you're not the man
I am so proud to call mine

And you're not the one
Who said he'd never leave
The one who made me believe in me
That was someone who could do no wrong
And you lost him

You're not the man
Who would bleed for me
But never shed a tear
You're not the one
Said he'd always, always, always be here

Said he'd always, always be near
But don't get me wrong
Although it seems sad
It's not all bad
You see
I'm not the little girl I used to be

You're not the man
Not the one
Said he'd always, always, always be near

He was everything, you see
He made me believe in me
Said he'd always, always, always be here
