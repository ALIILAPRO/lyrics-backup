		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Living
I is only one part of being
Believing 
Is to know just what you're feeling

You were so positive thing you know, you have
I'm sure that in knowing you're growing and it's you

Thinking 
Is you're own road of living
Dreaming 
Is the one way to being

Go in and your eye can see everything that's you
The only real person you need to know is you 

Ah, oh
Living, Living, Living
