		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Deep down we're broken
No plan to stay
Got a flight in the morning but
Imma love you anyway
Imma love you anyway

Another one of me won't come around again
Another one of me won't come around
So let me love you now
With the lights down low
Imma let it show
Another one of me won't come around again
Another one of me won't come around again
And you can't save a thing
With the lights down low
Imma let you know

I'm sorry for the pain I caused
And I let you fall way too deep
But it's over now
At least it's over now
Go ahead and blame me
Go ahead replace me
But girl you know
There's not another one
That there's not another one

Another one of me won't come around again
Another one of me won't come around
So let me love you now
With the lights down low
Imma let it show
Another one of me won't come around again
Another one of me won't come around again
And you can't save a thing
With the lights down low
Imma let you know
