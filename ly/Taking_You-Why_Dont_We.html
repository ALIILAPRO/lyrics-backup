		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I need you in my life like limelight
Wherever I go I'm taking you
Whenever I call you're my lifeline
I never hang up I depend on you

You fly with me so I call you red-eye
The sky's so clear when you're the view
(you're the view)

I only say it 'cause I really mean it
I ain't afraid of how you got me feeling
The sky's so clear when you're the view

Anywhere I go I'm taking you
Anywhere I go I'm taking you

I need you in my life like limelight
Wherever I go I'm taking you
Whenever I call you're my lifeline
I never hang up I depend on you

You fly with me so I call you redeye
The sky's so clear when you're the view
(you're the view)

I only say it 'cause I really mean it
I ain't afraid of how you got me feeling
The sky's so clear when you're the view

Anywhere I go I'm taking you
Anywhere I go I'm taking you
Anywhere I go I'm taking you
The sky's so clear when you're the view

You're the view, you're the view
You're the view, you're the view

I only say it 'cause I really mean it
I ain't afraid of how you got me feeling
The sky's so clear when you're the view

Anywhere I go I'm taking you
Anywhere I go I'm taking you
Anywhere I go I'm taking you
Anywhere I go I'm taking you
