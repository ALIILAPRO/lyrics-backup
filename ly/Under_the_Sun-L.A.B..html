		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, I've been waiting on the cold line
For a moment you called on the phone
Oh, I needed to find a reason to come back home, oh yeah
And can you hear me out on the freeway?
Got my hand out and nowhere to go
You see it's cold in the night
And I'm trying to get back home

You see I'm taken away by the things you say
When you called me on the phone
You told me I need to be working it night and day, oh yeah
But someone else told me to leave it alone
And go and live your life
I took the words that he said, running away from life

'Cause I can feel it
For the first time
Leaving here, I wanna come home
I can feel it
'Cause the country is all I know
'Cause I can feel it
Like the old times
People treat me strong and warm
'Cause I can feel it
'Cause this loving is all I want

Now it's easy to see that life ain't easy
Everybody wants it all
So can I tell you my story?
Changes and so much more
If you only believe what it means to be free
Some day you will be the one
'Cause no one else can break you under the sun

'Cause I can feel it
For the first time
Leaving here, I wanna come home
I can feel it
'Cause the country is all I know
'Cause I can feel it
Like the old times
People treat me strong and warm
'Cause I can feel it
'Cause this loving is all I want

'Cause I can feel it
For the first time
Leaving here, I wanna come home
I can feel it
'Cause the country is all I know (yes, it is)
'Cause I can feel it
Like the old times
People treat me strong and warm
'Cause I can feel it
'Cause this loving is all I want

Oh yeah, whoa
