		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Overtime every day of the week
Still the house ain't big enough
Spend your money so fast that you never see the green
Big, better, best, tell me where does it end?
Keeping up with the totals is tough

Better open your eyes, boy
She just wanna buy, buy, buy
Better wake up boy, I'll tell you why

She's got a mean streak (mean streak)
But you love her so much, you don't want to see her mean streak
Everybody knows she's got you on a leash, mean streak (mean streak)
Well she'll laugh in your face (mean streak)
But you're kissing her feet
You're never good enough
In the eyes of a woman with a mean streak

Every time that I look at you, boy
I can see you're a nervous wreck
You try too hard to give her every little thing
Big car, big pool, big house, heart attack
But you better bend or you're gonna break

How far does it take you?
She just wanna buy, buy, buy
She's gonna break you, I'll tell you why

She's got a mean streak
But you love her so much, you don't want to see her mean streak (mean streak)
Everybody knows she's got you on a leash, mean streak (mean streak)
She'll laugh in your face (mean streak)
But you're kissing her feet
You're never good enough
In the eyes of a woman with a mean streak

It could be different now
If you'd thought you'd goodbye
But you're too weak to try
Things won't change till you open up your eyes
How could you be so blind?

She's got a mean streak
But you love her so much, you don't want to see her mean streak (mean streak)
Everybody knows she's got you on a leash, mean streak (mean streak)
Well she'll laugh in your face (mean streak)
But you're kissing her feet, mean streak
You're never good enough
In the eyes of a woman with a mean streak
Mean streak, mean streak, mean streak
