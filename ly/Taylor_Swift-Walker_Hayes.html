		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, two Taylor Swift concert ticket stubs
Cost me more than my mortgage does
And that was before
T-shirts, cokes, and popcorn
But hey, I mean, how many times
Does your little girl turn nine?
Dave Ramsey wouldn't like it
But it was priceless
Watching her watch her hero
Singing every single word to every song
In the nosebleeds smiling like we had VIP passes
So enchanted 'til her bedtime struck like midnight
And she yawned and climbed up in my arms
She was gone

Who am I, that I get to hold a real life princess
While she sleeps through her way too expensive
Birthday gift
I just hope that she grows up and always knows
That me, her mom, and Jesus
Love her even more than she loves
Taylor Swift

I bet she was singing in her dreams
Dancing in that spotlight beam
Blowing kisses to her fans
Making heart shapes with her hands
In my hug, I could feel her heavy breathing
She was out, it was perfect
Even though my ears were ringing
Don't know how in the world
She could sleep through all that screaming
It's a night that we both
Won't forget for different reasons

Who am I, that I get to hold a real life princess
While she sleeps through her way too expensive
Birthday gift
I just hope that she grows up and always knows
That me, her mom, and Jesus
Love her even more than she loves
Taylor Swift

When she turns twenty-two and I turn fifty-six
I hope she thinks of me when she hears Taylor Swift

Who am I, that I get to hold a real life princess
While she sleeps through her way too expensive
Birthday gift
I just hope that she grows up and always knows
That me, her mom, and Jesus
Love her even more than she loves
Taylor Swift

Two Taylor Swift concert ticket stubs
Cost me more than my mortgage does
But hey, how many times
Does your little girl turn nine?
