		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Love me
Just a little bit longer
Love me

I remember times my love
When we really had it all
You were always there to make me smile
To help me when I fall

Ooo, I can't believe you're leaving me
When there's so much more to say
I can't let you go
Ooo, every time I look at you,
I still can feel the glow
Let it be, let it grow
 
[Chorus: ]
Ooo, love me, please
Just a little bit longer
Together, we can make it
Our love is much too young to break it

Oh all I ever wanted was
To have you to myself
Then I see you standing there
In the arms of someone else

Ooo, you know a girl can stand so much
And it's more than I can fake
I can't let you go
Ooo, every time I look at you
I still can feel the glow
Let it be, let it grow

[Chorus: ]

Love me, please
Just a little bit harder

Never even tried to see things my way
It's hard on a woman
When love ain't no love at all
And when you walk away
From me baby you're gonna be sorry
I'm begging you please

[Repeat: to fade]
Love me, please love me, love me
Just a little bit longer
Together we can make it
Our love is much too young to break it

Love me, please just a little bit harder
Just a little bit harder (just a little bit harder)
Together we can make it
Our love is much too young to break it
Love me, please just a little bit longer
