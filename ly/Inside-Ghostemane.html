		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I keep going back
But I’m not going back this time
I’ve been consuming myself in
All of your lies i think you’re right
I think I’m losing my mind
But I would rather have
Insane than nothing inside

I’ve been so down on my luck
And you wanna fuck me
I know you want me inside
I won’t catch feelings this time
I’ve been so down on my luck
And you wanna fuck me
I know you want me inside
I won’t catch feelings this time

Your eyes met mine
And then I turned my sadness into hate
You’re the reason I smoke cigarettes
And pick my face
And you’re the reason I don’t
Think I’m all that great

I’ve been so down on my luck
And you wanna fuck me
I know you want me inside
I won’t catch feelings this time
I’ve been so down on my luck
And you wanna fuck me
I know you want me inside
I won’t catch feelings this time

(Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)

Y'all be fucking with just anybody, ayy
But I don't fuck with anybody, yeah
Y'all be fucking with just anybody, yuh
But I don't fuck with anybody, ayy

Wrote to shawty and she wrote back, yuh
Now the shawty got a broke back, yuh
You tryna burn, I don't smoke that
I want no drugs if it ain't caps
Why y'all think I'm cool? I don't like that
Yuh rest in peace Gus, wanna bring you back
Don't tell me to collab with aesthetic trends
All these rappers got you fooled
They ain't really friends

Y'all be fucking with just anybody, yeah
But I don't fuck with anybody, yuh
Y'all be fucking with just anybody, yeah
But I don't fuck with anybody
