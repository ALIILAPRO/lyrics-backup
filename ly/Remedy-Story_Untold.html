		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't be scared
Come with me down there
I swear
I'm your remedy
I'm not your enemy
One sip and I already lost
So I keep on drinking
'Til the morning comes
Now I feel like shit
I'm calling it quits
But all I've done
Gets harder and harder to bear
I'm just living in fear
And my sanity's gone
Now I'm on my knees
Begging for some ease
I'm all but satisfied
I'm stuck inside of a lie
I feel so horrified
I might as well just hope to die
I'm your
Remedy
Put me out of my
Misery
Help me change my
Destiny
I hate to love you
But you're always
Here for me
You fuck me up bad
Mentally
You're wrong just like a
Robbery
I hate to love you
But you're
You're my remedy
Can't see clear
I'm in fear
When you're near
I know I'll hurt myself
Or someone else
Paranoia is taking over
Sober up?
Well I beg to differ
Give me some more
'Cause I don't wanna feel a thing
I'm breaking down
And I know the reason
I want out
But I can't drown my demons
I look around
All I see is treason
I'm fading out
Come save me now
I'm all but satisfied
I'm stuck inside of a lie
I feel so horrified
I might as well just hope to die
Can I get another try?
Bring the life back in my eyes
Make me whole again inside
And bury me
Remedy
Put me out of my
Misery
Help me change my
Destiny
I hate to love you
But you're always
Here for me
You fuck me up bad
Mentally
You're wrong just like a
Robbery
I hate to love you
But you're
You're my remedy
Remedy
Put me out of my
Misery
Help me change my
Destiny
I hate to love you
But you're always
Here for me
You fuck me up bad
Mentally
You're wrong just like a
Robbery
I hate to love you
But you're
You're my remedy
Don't be scared
Come with me down there
I swear
I'm your remedy
