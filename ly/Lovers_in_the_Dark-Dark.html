		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Flowing in the wind
A leaf under the moonlight
You have come to me

A present from the fate
Shining like a starlight
We've turned to be...

Lovers in the dark
Lovers in the dark
But I don't know, was it my pain you were looking for?
I don't know at all but I could no more

Lost with wounds and tears
You left me with a locked door
You have faded away

I never loved again
You have the key of my heart
But you don't want to stay

We could've found a way
But now no more
Memories forevermore
Of two, two lovers in the dark

Two lovers in the dark
Lovers in the dark
I don't know, was it my pain you were looking for?
I don't know at all, I could no more

Lovers in the dark
Lovers in the dark
But I don't know, was it my pain you were looking for?
This pain will last forevermore

Lovers in the Dark
