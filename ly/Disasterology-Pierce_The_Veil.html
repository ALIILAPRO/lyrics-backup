		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Alright 
I laid down
And I drank the poison then I passed the fuck out
Now let me tell you 'bout the good life
I have a million different kinds of fun
When I'm asleep and in a dream that I'm your only one

Can we create something beautiful and destroy it?
Nobody knows I dream about it, this is my imagination

If you come over tonight we can travel through time
We can sleep on the ceiling and creep under black lights
I have a million different girls that hide under my bed
And when I let them out they treat me right
Oh what a waste of a perfectly good, clean wrist
You were screaming till the police came

Can we create something beautiful and destroy it?
Nobody knows I dream about it, this is my imagination
If every living thing dies alone
What am I doing here?
If every living thing dies alone
What am I doing here?
(Fuck it!)

If it's the end of the world
If it's the end of the world
You and me should spend the rest of it in love

Can we create something beautiful and destroy it?
Nobody knows I dream about it, this is my imagination
If every living thing dies alone
What am I doing here?
If every living thing dies alone
What am I doing here?
What am I doing here?
Oh, no
