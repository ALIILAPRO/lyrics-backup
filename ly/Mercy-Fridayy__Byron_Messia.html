		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I say I got it all together, just know I'm lyin'
From a place we don't make it out
Too many niggas dyin'
Truth is, I ain't better than the next man, but you know I'm tryin'
Woah-oah

Have mercy on me, me
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on me, me
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on me

Have mercy pon me
When mi touch di road just fi kill di enemies
'Cause mi have dat cold Fahrenheit, Celsius below ten degrees
Best believe, sixteen, release a kill bwoy
But mi nuh chat more than a press release
Mi head sicker than a STD
Mi jus ah do what's best fi mi
Blood ah spill like Hennessy
Full ah money, Guyanese gold, dat ah mek a fella pree
Di Glocks dem up, mi start dem up fi shot you up, I make them chop you up
Boy nah guh reach and then di ambulance a wrap 'em up
Brand new AR weh mi get from mi dawg
Haffi mek people scatter when dat ah buss
Have mercy pon me
Mi nah thug it in di streets, I'm a juvenile teen
Tell me weh di fuck, if yuh know how it feel
When yuh cyan't get a meal, have siblings fi feed 

If I say I got it all together, just know I'm lyin'
From a place we don't make it out
Too many niggas dyin'
Truth is, I ain't better than the next man, but you know I'm tryin'
Woah-oah

Have mercy on me, me
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on me
Have mercy for me, me
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on me

On, on me
On, on me
Have mercy on me, on me
Have mercy on me, on me
Have mercy on-
Have mercy on-
