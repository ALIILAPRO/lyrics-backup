		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It’s been so long, it’s difficult to tell
If I truly miss what I once called home
It’s been so long, it’s difficult to tell
If this truly was my longest way home

So, sing for the damage we’ve done
And the worse things yet to come
Sing for the damage we’ve done
And the worse things we’ll still do

Cause with you at my side
I will never be lost
As my apathy is death
Our apathy is death
But with you at my side
I will always be lost
As my apathy is death
Your apathy is death

You can take my word I wish I would have followed you
You can take my word I wish I could have followed you
And so we’ll witness how the last days will come and stay
And so we witnessed when the last days came and stayed

So, drink from the night itself
The night no one came home
Drink from the night itself
But remember me as a time of day

Cause you not understanding my silence
Makes you also deaf to my words
Cause every word has consequences
And every silence seems to have too

Sing for the damage we’ve done
And the worse things yet to come
Sing for the damage we’ve done
And the worse things we’ll still do
