		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Curtains open, scared to get up on the stage
Second guessing, no way that I could have played
I was fearing, blank stares and empty chairs (ah, ah, ah)
Then you found me, and pushed me into the light
All around me, the crowd was coming alive
I got lost in your bright technicoloured dream

So I'm never gonna waste my love
On anyone else
Now I'm awake, my love
You've broken the spell
Your heart sings to me
A melody that sets me free
Your love is like a symphony
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
And what a way to set me free
Your love is like a symphony

Well I, had no rhythm, two syncopated left feet
Now I'm dancing 'cause your heart is driving the beat
Hold me close and I won't ever drift off key (ah, ah)
The highest of highs and the lowest of lows
You're makin' me sing out and hit all the notes
And with you around me it's just so easy to be in love

So I'm never gonna waste my love
On anyone else
Now I'm awake, my love
You've broken the spell
Your heart sings to me
A melody that sets me free
Your love is like a symphony
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
And what a way to set me free
Your love is like a symphony

The song starts and ends with you
The song starts and ends with you
The sun sets and rises just for you
The song starts and ends
The song starts and ends with you
The song starts and ends with you
The sun sets and rises just for you

So I'm never gonna waste my love
On anyone else
Now I'm awake, my love
You've broken the spell
Your heart sings to me
A melody that sets me free
Your love is like a symphony
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh 
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (your love is like a symphony)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
And what a way to set me free
Your love is like a symphony
