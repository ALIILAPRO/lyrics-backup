		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Silver surfer
With a silver tongue
Giving us a look in to
A look in to what's wrong

I'll tell you 'bout a girl just like any other
Just a girl - acting all grown up
'N don't say "she sounds all messed up!"

No 'cause any way you see it she's a girl and not a woman
And he knew that - oh and still he let her
Faithfully and honestly expose herself - silly girl!

She was simply playing
He was being serious
And she toyed with his mind
And they had a good time
And she felt safe

And I don't think she is responsible
He's the grown-up, not the girl
Even if she looks cheap
She's a child, so forget it
And walk away

Silver surfer
With a silver tongue
Giving us a look in to
A look in to what's wrong
And There is no way
You can justify
Putting all the blame on her
And shame on you if you try

Silver surfer
With a silver tongue
Giving us a look in to
A look in to what's wrong
And There is no way
You can justify
Putting all the blame on her
And shame on you if you try

I understand why he got tempted
By a girl - young, fresh and un-aware
'Cause she said "oh, let me sex you up!"

Then they talked about meeting - get a little dinner
And she felt good - like an adult
Little did she know what would follow - silly girl!

Finally she gave in -
Met him at a restaurant
And she felt kind of strange
When he poured her wine
But she was fine

I don't think she is responsible
He's the grown-up, not the girl
Even if she looks cheap
She's a child, so forget it
Walk away

Silver surfer
With a silver tongue
Giving us a look in to
A look in to what's wrong
And There is no way
You can justify
Putting all the blame on her
And shame on you if you try

Silver surfer
With a silver tongue
Giving us a look in to
A look in to what's wrong
And There is no way
You can justify
Putting all the blame on her
And shame on you if you try

Silver surfer
