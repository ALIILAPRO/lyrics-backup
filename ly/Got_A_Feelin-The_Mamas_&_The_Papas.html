		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Got a feelin' that I wasting time on you babe
Got a feelin' that you're been untrue
I got a feelin' that you're stealin'
All the love I thought I was giving to you
Baby, it'sÂ¯ true
Got a feelin' that you're playing some game with me babe
Got a feelin' that you just can't see
If you're entertaining any thought that you're gaining
By causing me all of this pain and making me blue
The joke on you
When I get to feeling that you're stealing love
And I don't know why, baby
It makes me so discouraged
I finally get the courage not to cry, babe
Or even try, babe
Got a feelin' that I'm wasting time on you babe
Got a feelin' that you're been untrue
I got a feelin' that you're stealin'
All the love I thought I was giving to you
Baby, it's true; the joke's on you
Baby it's true; the joke's on you
