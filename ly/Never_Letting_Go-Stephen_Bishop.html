		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hi, I thought I dropped by so nice to see you
It's been too long since I was calling you
I've been holding on to prayer
'Cause my dreams never seemed to come true

[Repeat: x3]
Oh I'll never letting go 

It's not that easy

[Repeat: x3]
No I'll never letting go 

I'm crazy about you, and I can't live without you

I left the kitchen light on this past midnight
It don't blow out, just keep shining bright
And now your eyes they danced away from mine
Is there someone else again this time?

I could be gentleman and walk away with style
But I'll fight to keep, throw my arms around you
This is crazy I know I'm just damned to show
