		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In the temple (I was an offering)
Of the heartless (I was an offering)
I was humbled (I was an offering)
And reborn
Into a god.

Darling,
A sensitive soul is just,
A tyrant who enslaves,
All those around him,
To make certain he
Is hurt, always

I don't need a reason baby,
Put your arms around me.
Hold me real close,
Clap me in irons,
C'mon caligulove me,
C'mon caligulove me.

You can hear it (as an offering)
If you're a good girl (as an offering)
A righteous choir is singing (as an offering)
No, screaming,
As they burn.

Darling, there are no taboos
In lust.
My veins coarse blood that's so
Venomous.
When heartless hears a heartbeat
He's jealous, so jealous.

I don't need a reason baby,
Put your arms around me.
Hold me real close,
Clap me in irons,
C'mon caligulove me.

I already gotcha baby,
Put yourself upon me.
I'm in lust,
A slave to desire,
When you caligulove me.
C'mon on,
Love me.
Hold me real close
Love me.
I need your caligulove girl.
Caligulove.
