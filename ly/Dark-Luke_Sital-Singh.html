		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You are the deepening mystery
When life is full of simplicity
You are the nagging doubt
The hideaway doubter when everyone believes
Everyone believes

You are the abstract art of paint and poem
When our propaganda makes everything clear
You are the thirsty throat, the desert defeat
When there's water everywhere

You are, you are, you are, you are dark
You are, you are, you are, you are dark
You are, you are, you are, you are dark
When all is bright

You are the silence the God gone missing
When the din of all belief is deafening
You are the stranger in the night time
Throwing us to the ground
When all we wanna do is getaway

You are, you are, you are, you are dark
You are, you are, you are, you are dark
You are, you are, you are, you are dark
When all is bright

You are the cloud of unknowing
When we know-it-alls know it all
You are never ever ever ready
And I've waited for eternity
But I want it all, yea I want it now

You are, you are, you are, you are dark
You are, you are, you are, you are dark
You are, you are, you are, you are dark
When all is bright, all is
Bright, all is bright, all is bright
