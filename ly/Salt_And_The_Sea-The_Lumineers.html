		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Could it be I was the one that you held so deep in the night
On the back staircase you fell to your knees with tears in your eyes

All that you suffered, all the disease
You couldn't hide it, hide it from me

All alone scared in your room, would you swear there's nobody home
On the bed laying awake as you prayed he'd leave you alone

I'll let the darkness swallow me whole
I need to find you, need you to know

I'll be your friend in the daylight again
There we will be, like an old enemy
Like the salt and the sea

And they wrote all these prescriptions, they wrote me off
Like a heel
Yeah, the doctors with their medicine left me
To rock in my filth

From the destruction, out of the flame
You need a villain, give me a name

I'll be your friend in the daylight again
There we will be, like an old enemy
I'll be your friend in the daylight again
There we will be, like an old enemy
Like the salt and the sea
Like the salt and the sea
