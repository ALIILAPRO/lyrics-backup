		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm lonely and abandoned 
Washed up, left for dead 
I'm lost inside the desert 
Of every word you said 
Like a nuclear reactor 
Or TNT 
I'm thinking about the times 
When you lied to me 
All the innuendo 
Caught up on your hook 
I was just a name 
In your little black book 
Ah, I'll get even with you 
I'm bitter and I'm twisted 
I haven't slept in days 
I'm lonely and I'm angry 
I can't make it go away 
I'm like a bomb that's ticking 
I got voices in my head 
I got a doll with needles in 
Wishing you were dead 
I'll get you back somehow 
That's what I'm gonna do 
I'll get you back somehow 
Your nightmare coming true 
Ah, I'll get even with you 
Ah, that's what I'm gonna do 
Gonna get even with you 
You better look behind you 
'Cause there I'm gonna be 
I'll be standing in the shadows 
With who I used to be 
He's slightly schizophrenic 
Me and me and me and me agree 
That you are gonna pay 
For what you did to me 
Ah, I'll get even with you 
Gonna get even with you 
Ah, that's what I'm gonna do 
I'm gonna... 
Ah, I'll get even with you
