		<p>
		  Oh, oh
I got drip for days 
I got drip 
(Great John on the beat, by the way)
Hol' on (look)

I got drip for days (I got drip)
No, you can't catch this wave (no)
She tryna fuck, take dick for days, uh (she tryna fuck)
I'm tryna trap and get paid, uh
She fell in love with it, uh (she fell in love)
She fell in love with the gang, uh(yeah)
You better come get her, uh (you better come)
I got her sayin' my name (I got her sayin' my name)

Bro hit the dash, now we switchin' lanes, uh (lanes)
I turn the pain to fame, uh (pain to fame)
One shot from this Glock get your face rearranged (arranged)
You changed, I stayed the same, uh (the same)
T2MB, we done paved the way, fall back like a fade-away
I dare a nigga test that
I done got shot and I done shot back
SD on a drill, that's a opp pack
You've been in the field, gotta move tact

Hold on, fuck it, I'm done with the Act'
Perkys, I'm givin' 'em back
Nah, fuck it, let me pop one more
Bro just caught a body tryna up that score, uh
We left his face on the floor, uh
Now watch me flex on the tour
Way back then I was way too poor
Now I rock Mike Amiris with Diors
Hold on

I got drip for days (I got drip)
No, you can't catch this wave (wave)
She tryna fuck, take dick for days, uh (dick for days)
I'm tryna trap and get paid, uh (get paid)
She fell in love with it, uh (she fell in love)
She fell in love with the gang, uh
You better come get her, uh (you better come)
I got her sayin' my name (I got her sayin' my name)

I got 'em jackin' the steeze
They don't like you, they lovin' on me
The price just went up, had to double the fee
That's your bitch, why she up on her knees?
That's your mans, why he talk to police?
Swear these niggas ain't made for these streets
These bitches ain't loyal, they love on the team, oh
You know I'm fly like Rio
Run up on a nigga, take shit like Deebo
Trap spot hot like Nino, huh
But we can't go out like that nigga (we can't go out)
I run in your house with my niggas
You ride with that stick, better pull on that trigger, huh
Or you can get hit by a hitter
Free Caesar, he droppin' shit, ain't talkin' litter
Free Fross, I'm still sendin' him pictures
I can't love on that bitch, she too bitter
You know me, I forgive and forget her

I got drip for days (I got drip)
No, you can't catch this wave (wave)
She tryna fuck, take dick for days, uh (she tryna fuck)
I'm tryna trap and get paid, uh
She fell in love with it, uh (she fell in love)
She fell in love with the gang, uh
You better come get her, uh (you better come)
I got her sayin' my name (I got her sayin' my name)
