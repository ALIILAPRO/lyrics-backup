		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've got your number, lonely
October 33
I wear it on my soul's back
Like, fair, fair, fair
And, I can hear the brass ring, I hear it in the nosebleeds
Where you once felt a cold breeze
Think it was Halloween

I've got your number, lonely
October 33
That's cold facts, fair, fair, fair
Holds me down, like you know how, darlin'
Hold me now, like you know my plight

Got your number, I do
Alone in the back
I'm sending love where you are at
I do

I've got your number, lonely
October 33
Your love's my only good thing
Like, fair, fair, fair
So, help me hear the bird sing
I'll help you capture your dream
Let's see it in the present, and try to let it be

I've got your number, lonely
October 33
I'm knockin' at your door, babe
Like, fair, fair, fair
You can hear the band play
Then listen to my heart say
It's gonna be a good day
October 33

Got your number, baby, I do
Crying in the back
I'm sending love where you are at
I do, to you
Hold on, hold on, hold on
Fair, fair, fair
Hold on, hold on, hold on

Say, I wanna make it alright
Good times, stop, look and listen
Said, I wanna make it alright
Stop, look and listen
Alone in the back
Send love where you're at
I do
