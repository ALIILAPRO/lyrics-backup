		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I see you walking through the rain
And I see the water covering your teardrops on your face
And I know that I broke all your rules
Oh, now you're looking at me, and I'm looking at you like a fool
But, you don't know what it feels like to fall in love with you
No, you don't know what it's like when you can't go back

'Cause I only lose my mind when I ain't got you
And how can I not win when I'm always bound to lose
No, when I ain't got you
No, no, no, I ain't got you, no

So come on inside, you catch a cold
Oh, darling the storm will pass when you grow old
But you stand next to me with a look in your eyes
And you say goodbye, you say goodbye
And you say goodbye
But, you don't know what it's like to lose you

'Cause I only lose my mind when I ain't got you
And how can I not win when I'm always bound to lose? 
When I'm always bound to 
'Cause I tried to hold on tight to make you mine, but I lost each time
And I only lose my mind when I ain't got you

But I think it's time to let you go
To let your heart find a home
I need to let you go

'Cause I only lose my mind when I ain't got you
And how I can win when I'm always bound to lose
No, I ain't got you
No, no, no, I ain't got you, oh
