		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Forgiveness my one and only truth 
That still knows me like I once knew you 
Can't live this 
If that's what we chose 
Remembering me remembering you

I.... I..... I..... I'm sorry

You get one chance to live,
One chance to die 
c million in betweens, 
To get it right, get it right 

Sure there's 4, 3 and 2 
That's all been done 
There's just one
There's just one
 
Deliverence 
c two way street 
That needs you 
Like you've been needing me 
Though you hate this 
cs I agree, 
Mistakes are words that never ever breathe

I.... I..... I..... I'm sorry

You get one chance to live,
One chance to die 
c million in betweens, 
To get it right, get it right 

Sure there's 4, 3 and 2 
That's all been done 
There's just one
There's just one

There's Just One.... There's Just One...

c second too late 
Is the second you're done 
cnd until someday, 
You belong to no one 
Without you without me 
Nothing left to be seen
If tomorrow never comes, 
What did it all really mean

You get one chance to live,
One chance to die 
c million in betweens, 
To get it right, get it right 

Sure there's 4, 3 and 2 
That's all been done 
There's just one
There's just one
