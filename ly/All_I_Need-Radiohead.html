		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm the next act
Waiting in the wings
I'm an animal
Trapped in your hot car
I am all the days
That you choose to ignore

You are all I need
You're all I need
I'm in the middle of your picture
Lying in the reeds

I am a moth
Who just wants to share your light
I'm just an insect
Trying to get out of the night
I only stick with you
Because there are no others

You are all I need
You're all I need
I'm in the middle of your picture
Lying in the reeds

It's all wrong
It's all wrong
It's all wrong
It's all right
It's all right
It's all right
It's all wrong
It's all right
It's all wrong
It's all right
