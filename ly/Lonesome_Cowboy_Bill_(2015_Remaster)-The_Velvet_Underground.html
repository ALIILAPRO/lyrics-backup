		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lonesome Cowboy Bill
Rides the rodeo.
Lonesome Cowboy Bill,
You got to see him yodel "Ay-hee-ho!"

Lonesome Cowboy Bill
Rides the rodeo.
Ever since he was a little lad,
Loves the rodeo.
Bucking broncs, yeah, sipping wine,
You got to see him go,
And all the ten-gallon girls
Love to hear him yodel "Ay-hee-ho!"

Because
Lonesome Cowboy Bill
Rides the rodeo.
Lonesome Cowboy Bill,
You got to see him yodel "Ay-hee-ho!"

Oh, Lonesome Cowboy Bill,
You still ride the rodeo.
Up 'round the Colorado shore,
Down by the Ohio.
Sometimes even New Orleans,
Down by the Mardi Gras,
And all the ten-gallon girls
Love to hear him yodel "Ay-hee-ho!"

He's Lonesome Cowboy Bill, He rides the rodeo.
Just a Lonesome Cowboy Bill,
You got to see him yodel "Ay-hee-ho!"

You got to see him in the rodeo
When he's ridin', goin' too darn fast.
You got to hear the people scream and shout

They call him,
Lonesome Cowboy Bill
He's a
Lonesome Cowboy Bill

He goes...
Lonesome Cowboy Bill
Rides the rodeo.
Lonesome Cowboy Bill,
You got to see him yodel "Ay-hee-ho!"

I said,
You got to see him yodel "Ay-hee-ho!"
Oh he's a Lonesome Cowboy Bill, Lonesome Cowboy Bill...
