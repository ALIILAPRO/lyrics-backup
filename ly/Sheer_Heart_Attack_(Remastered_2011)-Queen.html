		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well you're just seventeen, all you wanna do is disappear
You know what I mean there's a lot of space
Between your ears
The way that you touch don't feel nu nu nothin'
Hey hey hey hey, it was the D.N.A.
Hey hey hey hey, that made me this way
Do you know, do you know, do you know, just how I feel?
Do you know, do you know, do you know, just how I feel?

Sheer heart attack
Sheer heart attack
Real cardiac

I feel so inar, inar, inar, inar, inar, inar, inar, inarticulate

Gotta feelin', gotta feelin', gotta feelin', like a paralyse
It ain't no, it ain't no, it ain't no, it ain't no surprise
Turn on the T.V. let it drip right down in your eyes
Hey hey hey hey, it was the D.N.A.
Hey hey hey hey hey, that made me this way
Do you know, do you know, do you know, just how I feel?
Do you know, do you know, do you know, just how I feel?

Sheer heart attack
Sheer heart attack
Real cardiac

I feel so inar, inar, inar, inar, inar, inar, inar, inarticulate
Just how I feel
Do you know, do you know, do you know. Do you know, just how I feel?

Do you know, do you know, do you know, just how I feel?
Do you know, do you know, do you know, do you know, just how I feel?

Sheer heart attack
Sheer heart attack
Real cardiac
