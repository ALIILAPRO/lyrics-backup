		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lying here I pray that you're alone
I'm tired of sleeping on my own
I wish your name would flash up on my phone
Reminding me I'm not alone

Trapped in this burning room
Flames in the shape of you
You left me standing in the dark
You left my heart in two
These words were made for you
And now we're nothing but a spark

'Cause the hardest thing I'll ever do
Is walk away still lovin' you
But now I'm just somebody that you loved 
(Hey!)
You let me in, you spat me out
You're someone I can't live without
But now I'm just somebody that you loved

Somebody that you loved
Somebody that you loved
Somebody that you loved
Somebody that you loved
(Hey!)

You cut me deep, you counted up my scars
You found a place to leave your mark
I never thought that we would fall apart
But lovin' you just broke my heart

Trapped in this burning room
Flames in the shape of you
You left me standing in the dark
You left my heart in two
These words were made for you
And now we're nothing but a spark

'Cause the hardest thing I'll ever do
Is walk away still lovin' you
But now I'm just somebody that you loved
You let me in, you spat me out
You're someone I can't live without
But now I'm just somebody that you loved
Somebody that you loved

Hey!

'Cause the hardest thing I'll ever do
Is walk away still lovin' you
But now I'm just somebody that you loved
You let me in, you spat me out
You're someone I can't live without
But now I'm just somebody that you loved
Somebody that you loved

Somebody that you loved
Somebody that you loved
Somebody that you loved
(Hey!)
