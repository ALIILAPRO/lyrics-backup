		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I drag my hands out the window for you
Oh, it's killing me, it's killing you too
Suffering people surround us, it's true
Yet we stay

Will you stand in the headlights confused?
Well, it's always forever with you
And my instincts, they act like they knew
We would change

It's always been forever with you
It's always been forever with you

Drop the gear like you do just for you
Well, it's kind of surprising you'd bruise
Complicated but perfectly made
You've changed

Crashed the car like the person you are
Is it always forever with you?
And ironically you'll try to prove
You'll get through

It's always been forever with you
It's always been forever with you
(Don't tell me, please)
It's always been forever with you
(I won't agree)
It's always been forever with you

It's always been forever with you
It's always been forever with you
