		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know your high
And I know your downfall
Though we fell apart
It was no one's fault

I've gotta make you remember
How hard it was to let me go
Slow dancing with a stranger
I found somebody new

She moves just like you
She tastes just like you

But it's always been you
Oh, it's always been you
Yeah, its always been you
Oh, it's always been you

Back when we started
I was a fighter
I kept my guard up
But I took it down for you
Oh, what a thing to do

What do you tell your friends
The ones I'll never see again
What are you filling in their heads
I found another ex, some temporary settlement
To kiss the heartbreak off my lips

She moves just like you
She tastes like you

But it's always been you
Oh, it's always been you
Oh, it's always been you
Yeah, it's always been you
Oh, it's always been you

Oh, it's always been you

Don't let go if you love me
Don't move on, don't move on
Don't let go if you love me
Don't move on, don't move on

Don't move on, don't move on
Don't move on, don't move on
