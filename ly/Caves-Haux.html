		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Forget all the faces you missed
Remember the hearts that you risked
It's when your tongue-tied
It's when you can't hide
You follow the words from the caves

Take your last supply
To leave this home behind
Take your last supply
To leave this home behind
You follow the words from the caves

You follow the words from the caves
You follow the words from the caves

Tear up the letters you've saved
From all the love left astray
It's from the white lies
When you were knee high
You follow the words from the caves

Take your last supply
To leave this home behind
Take your last supply
To leave this home behind
You follow the words from the caves

You follow the words from the caves

Take your last supply
To leave this home behind
Take your last supply
To leave this home behind
You follow the words from the caves

You follow the words from the caves
You follow the words from the caves
