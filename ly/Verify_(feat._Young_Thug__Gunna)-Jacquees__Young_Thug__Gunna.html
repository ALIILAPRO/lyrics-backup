		  Yeah
Rich Gang
Uh-huh
Come on

Yes, I love your physical, but it's your energy
I got no fear to put you on a pedestal, but are you trustin' me?
I feel like I picked the right time (what?)
To hit your line (yeah)
Girl, you all mine (uh huh)
Anticipatin' for a long time
Will you verify what I feel inside? (What I feel inside)

Truck the chicken, get a million out the whole ride (yeah)
Fifty Shades of Grey with bitches got 'em all tied (ooh)
Lamborghinis and Ferraris, you're verified (skrrt, skrrt)
Strawberry, kiwis and greens, you got berry eyes (skrrt)
She from Swahili, the color of wild berry eyes (yeah)
How much you sip lean, that lets you know you're verified (yeah)
I got my heart broke, now I keep me a spare tire (spare)
I'm in a tall Rolls Royce truck, I feel very high (Rolls, aye)
Fuck a bus, (what?) Rolls Royce, (skrrt) yeah, yeah
Twist it up, (yeah) roll a Dutch, (yeah) yeah, yeah
I got tires on the 9, yeah, yeah
Sting your body then you die
Yeah, I got vibes all on my line, yeah, yeah
She just wanna be verified, yeah, yeah
Different, I think you one of a kind (Yeah)
She from New York, but she don't like to Milly Rock (Milly Rock)

Yes, I love your physical (yes, I)
But it's your energy (your energy)
I got no fear to put you on a pedestal (no fear) 
But are you trustin' me? (Trusting me)
I feel like I picked the right time (aye) 
To hit your line (why?)
Girl, you all mine (yeah, yeah, oh-yeah)
Anticipatin' for a long time (what?)
Will you verify what I feel inside? (What I feel inside)

I don't need a Super Bowl team (yeah)
Throw it on me, my position locked down
(I got my position locked down)
Fixin' your heart from shit before me
But you know (yeah) he won't set you up for let downs
(He won't set you up for let downs)
I'm participating
In whatever it is (yeah, whatever)
The charges are your rent (Yeah)
I'll throw the towel all in for you

Yes, I love your physical (yes, I)
But it's your energy (your energy)
I got no fear to put you on a pedestal (no fear) 
But are you trustin' me? (Trusting me)
I feel like I picked the right time (aye) 
To hit your line (why?)
Girl, you all mine (you're all mine)
Anticipatin' for a long time
Will you verify what I feel inside?

What I feel
Inside, yeah
No fears
