		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Come on, Barbie, let's go party
Pop champagne, like Kelly, get naughty
Don't need nobody, but I like your body
Dress up for me, you're the dolly

Cool Barbie doll with the hair cut off
Comin' in on fire like a fuckin' molotov
I don't wanna be polite, I'm sleepy of bein' soft
I've got money on my mind, he ain't worth the cost

Pretty piece of plastic, shiny underneath the flash
If you look from far away you would think I'm made of glass
But a little less breakable, quite unmistakable
Be your favorite toy, make some noise, unerasable

Come on, Barbie, let's go party
Pop champagne, like Kelly, get naughty
Don't need nobody, but I like your body
Dress up for me, you're the dolly
Come on, Barbie, let's go party
Pop champagne, like Kelly, get naughty
Don't need nobody, but I like your body
Dress up for me, you're the dolly

Wanna buy all of my favorite things and move out to the hills
Show my mama and my daddy I can pay my own bills
Get a pretty new car, drop some change on some art
Make a song that you listen to and wish I broke your heart

Pretty piece of plastic, shiny underneath the flash
If you look from far away you would think I'm made of glass
But a little less breakable, quite unmistakable
Be your favorite toy, make some noise, unerasable

Come on, Barbie, let's go party
Pop champagne, like Kelly, get naughty
Don't need nobody, but I like your body
Dress up for me, you're the dolly
Come on, Barbie, let's go party
Pop champagne, like Kelly, get naughty
Don't need nobody, but I like your body
Dress up for me, you're the dolly

(Ah, ah, ah, yeah, yeah, ah, yeah)
(Ah, ah, ah, yeah, yeah, ah, yeah) (ooh, oh)
(Ah, ah, ah, yeah, yeah, ah, yeah)
(Ah, ah, ah, yeah, yeah)

Ah, yeah
I'm so pretty in the LA sun
Ah, ah, ah, yeah
Barbie girl, if you ever seen one
Ah, ah, ah, yeah

Come on, Barbie, let's go party
Pop champagne, like Kelly, get naughty
Don't need nobody, but I like your body
Dress up for me, you're the dolly

(Come on, let's go, go, go, go, go)
(Go, go, go go, go, go, go, go, dolly)

Come on, Barbie, let's go party
