		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My life story's strictly business never blew my chance
Moms kicked me out the house when I was flippin' "I'm the Man"
Put the boys on the street, make them walk this beat
Teach them how to eat and to seek for peace
Son, I stamped this name Livin' Proof 'cause I mean what I say
Bring the fake to reality and make them pay
Yo, these ghetto rhyme stories got 'em scared to death
I'm tryin' to get the fuck out, see what the world's about
Check it, 1986 is when I reached my peak
Take my brothers outta state and tried to make some ends meet
First destination Texas and it's just like that
Makin' moves with my brothers and there's no turnin' back
We got thirty-six grams on the scale right now
Gettin' ready with my brothers, time to break the shit down
I'm not about killin' my people but you know how it go
Work with me not against me and we'll make mad dough
Wear my co-defendant out when I break down with rap
Hold me back and give me love and now I'm givin' it back
A unique sound from the streets and it's just so sweet
My livin' proof life story, let me break it in piece

Yo, I rock on the block with the real hip-hop
As you start to clock (clock) and jock (jock)
Yo, I'm comin' off with mad rage
Eighteen, and hittin' the real stage
But don't worry bout me 'cause I'm makin' it
And if I can't have it, then I'm takin' it
That's how it is, 'cause I'm livin' trife
Where's my knife? Take a chance with your life
Rappers decapitate and disintegrate
You I will mutilate when I penetrate
Go for the one when I say raid
A hitman for hire and I want to get paid
'Cause bullets are sprayed and anybody is laid
More money is made and that's the family trade
See I make moves and tell what's the truth
That's why I'm here to be livin' proof

(Leave it up to me while I be livin' proof)
(Life as a shorty shouldn't be so rough)
(Leave it up to me while I be livin' proof)
(Life as a shorty shouldn't be so rough)
(Leave it up to me while I be livin' proof)
(Life as a shorty shouldn't be so rough)
(Leave it up to me while I be livin' proof)
(Life as a shorty shouldn't be so rough)

I'm lost, must pay the cost to be the boss
With force, rather get my point across
I'm goin' off on the mic insane, out of sight
When I take flight (like who, kid?) Like Mike
And you see, I be rollin' like a battlecat
And I'm ready to rip on my combat
Beef I'm not havin' that, yo, I pull my trigger back
And all you pussy niggas know where my heart is at
I like to stay down low but, yo, I flip at times
Like when I'm kickin' lines, or bustin' out nines
It's like that, shit, I jumped off the roof
Pysch 'cause I wouldn't be livin' proof

(Kick the truth to the young Black youth)

The moral of the story, what the fuck's goin' on?
And our seeds won't see 2000 if these niggas keep frontin'
I used to hustle on the block, now I rock for papes
Watch as the world turn and I will come back
Relieving stress off my brain, I got the la-la for that
Breakin' down all subjects and then all facts
Lettin lose everyday, but still, keepin' it fat
Bust it, niggas keep on frontin' in this game, aight?
Scared to death ass rappers don't get no props
Scared to come to the ghetto, talk about bustin' shots
See I can walk around the ghetto, stand in peace and at ease
Get my ghetto crowd open, yo, you know what I mean
Indeed, see what I see and then you know what I mean
Gettin, ready for the future so don't fuck with me
My livin' proof life story, niggas, I kill it with ease

(Leave it up to me while I be livin' proof)
(Life as a shorty shouldn't be so rough)
(Leave it up to me while I be livin' proof)
(Life as a shorty shouldn't be so rough)
(Leave it up to me while I be livin' proof)
(Life as a shorty shouldn't be so rough)
(Leave it up to me while I be livin' proof)
(To kick the truth to the young Black youth)
