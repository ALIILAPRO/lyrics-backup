		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Had enough, I've really
Had enough
Had enough of denial
I'm not alright, but I'm not gonna lie
I don't know that I ever was

All alone, I've waited
All alone
Held it in as I played by your rules
I've been biting my lip, but I'm losing my grip
I'm coming down, down, down

When all the hate burns off, I'm left here with the pain
Behind our vain devices are we all the same?

Ooh-ooh, ah-ah
Change me into something I believe in
Change me so I don't have to pretend

Take a breath and try to play along 
But I'm a terrible liar
I feel the world like a brick on my chest
And the party's just begun
Throw the rope, I'm wading
Through the mud
From your mouth flow a thousand truths
But you know, there's only one

When all the hate burns off, I'm left here with the pain

Ooh-ooh, ah-ah
Change me into something I believe in
Change me so I don't have to pretend
Sweet words, they mean nothing, they're not true
'Cause the game is over

I want it all or I want nothing at all
Maybe I can

Change me into something I believe in
Change me so I don't have to pretend
Your sweet words they mean nothing, save your breath
The game is over
