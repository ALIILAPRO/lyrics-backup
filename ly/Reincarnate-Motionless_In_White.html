		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Get up

You pull the trigger just for fun
Forgetting I'm a loaded gun
So hate me for the things I've done
And not for what I've now become

I want this
I need this
I love it

Crawling from hell
Fallen from grace
And there is nothing left to take
Leaving the past to the grave
So we can reincarnate

You sit upon your throne of filth
Condemning what you haven't built
So hate me cause you're standing still
Watching while I shoot to kill

I live this
I breathe this
You crave it

Crawling from hell
Fallen from grace
And there is nothing left to take
Leaving the past to the grave
So we can reincarnate

There's one thing you forget
You can't make me play dead
I've swallowed your bullshit
No respect
You make me fucking sick

Give me a reason

I won't bite my tongue
I am not afraid spineless
A dominion of nothing is all you will reign
You laugh but what did you create
Bitch you give a fucking aspirin a headache

Through hell
From grace
There's nothing left

Crawling from hell
Fallen from grace
There's nothing left for you to take
Driving the nail through my mistakes
So we can reincarnate

When we lie down, we're sore and sick
We fall down, sink or swim

Underground
The remedy for who we are
And what lies beneath

Reincarnate
