		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ya never know what you're gonna feel, oh
Ya never see it comin' suddenly it's real

Oh, never even crossed my mind, no
That I would ever end up here tonight

All things change
When you don't expect them to
No one knows
What the future's gonna do
I never even noticed
That you've been there all along

I can't take my eyes off of you
I know you feel the same way too, yeah
I can't take my eyes off of you
All it took was one look
For a dream come true

Yeah, we got a good thing goin' on

Oh, right here is right where we belong

You never really know what you might find
Now all I see is you and I
You're everything I never knew
That I've been looking for

Can't take my eyes off of you
Oh, oh, oh yeah
So let the music play
Can't take my eyes off of you
Yeah, the feeling's getting' stronger
And I never ever felt this way

Alright, I see everything
In your eye, oh yeah
Alright, something's happening
'Cause everyone's around but
You're the only one I see

I can't take my eyes off of you
Feelings like I never knew
I can't take my eyes off of you
From the start, got my heart
Yeah, you do
Can't take my eyes off you
