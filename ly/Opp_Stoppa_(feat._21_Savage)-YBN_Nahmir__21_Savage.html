		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (21, pussy, pussy) shh, shh, sheesh
Ayy, ayy, ayy, all these pancake ass niggas (pussy, pussy)
Weird ass niggas, man (pussy, pussy)
What are all these niggas talkin' 'bout?
Ice cream ass niggas
Ayy (ayy, sheesh)

I keep a rocket in my pocket, socket called a pocket rocket
If it's war, we ain't playin' games, bitch, we get it started
I'm the man, clip it keep a hundred, nigga, I'm a gunner
When it's beef, we ain't playin' games, we hit you and yo' mama
Know that choppa, that's that oppa stoppa, hit you and your pops
I fell in love with all this fuckin' money, you in love with drama
Say-say baby, I'm not Sosa baby, but I keep a llama
Gonna pull up in a new i8, you ridin' in a Honda
Ayy, all these tattoos on my fuckin' body, she say I'm a hottie
Why your girlfriend always wanna fuck me, wanna touch my body?
We got all type of fuckin' guns, might even have a Tommy
I remember them days in the jail, still free my nigga Ryan
And free Chris though, 'member we was bouncin' out with .44's
A nigga keep it silent, in L.A. I keep a clip though
'Cause no, I can't be lackin' in these streets, I keep a big pole (ayy)
And I can't have no nigga with me if they gon' snitch on us (snitch on us)

That choppa, that's that oppa stoppa, hit you and your pops
I fell in love with all this fuckin' money, you in love with drama
Say-say baby, I'm not Sosa baby, but I keep a llama
Gonna pull up in a new i8, you ridin' in a Honda

Ayy, big dawg Savage (21)
Toss your baby mama in the air like she a salad (on God)
Ratchet bitch suck me while I'm drivin', she from Dallas (straight up)
Lil' mama got some buns on her, I call her Patty (21)
My model bitch be smokin' all the 'Woods, she from Cali (21)
In my Testarossa (21)
My pistol out the holster (on God)
I'm double cuppin' syrup, bitch, I don't need no coaster (facts)
Opps want promotion (pussy)
We put 'em on a poster (pussy)
I gunned him down in his own hood 'cause he local (pussy)
My watch ten bricks (God shit)
Rolling Loud Miami, I pulled up with ten sticks (21)
Bitch, smell my fragrance, you can't tell me I ain't rich (21)
Big 4L, I ain't shakin' no hand with no snitch (21)

Know that choppa, that's that oppa stoppa, hit you and your pops
I fell in love with all this fuckin' money, you in love with drama
Say-say baby, I'm not Sosa baby, but I keep a llama
Gonna pull up in a new i8, you ridin' in a Honda
Ah, that choppa, that's that oppa stoppa, hit you and your pops
I fell in love with all this fuckin' money, you in love with drama
Say-say baby, I'm not Sosa baby, but I keep a llama
Gonna pull up in a new i8, you ridin' in a Honda (pussy, pussy)
