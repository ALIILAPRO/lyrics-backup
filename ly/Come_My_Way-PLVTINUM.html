		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby girl, won't you come my way
Tell me all the things
That you wanna say
Baby girl, you can say my name
Show me all the ways
You can move that thing

I don't wanna take you nowhere
I don't wanna waste your time
Baby girl, won't you come my way
Baby girl, won't you come for me

Baila conmigo
Anoche contigo
I wanna feel you against me
All night, bodies connecting

Baby girl, yeah
We can get it in
I can be temptation
You can be my sin
I want the rush of your heartbeat
Those eyes, I know that you want me

Baby girl, won't you come my way
Tell me all the things
That you wanna say
Baby girl, you can say my name
Show me all the ways
You can move that thing

I don't wanna take you nowhere
I don't wanna waste your time
Baby girl, won't you come my way
Baby girl, won't you come for me

Na na na

Vamos fiesta
I want you, se√±orita
I'm gonna kiss all your body
Sharp breath, gripping the bed sheet

Baby girl, yeah, I'm 'a put it in
I can make your bed shake
I can be your sin
Your hands scratching against me
One look, I know that you want me

Baby girl, won't you come my way
Tell me all the things
That you wanna say
Baby girl, you can say my name
Show me all the ways
You can move that thing

I don't wanna take you nowhere
I don't wanna waste your time
Baby girl, won't you come my way
Baby girl, won't you come for me

You know you want me
Girl, you need me
Whoa
I'll be waiting girl, come through
Won't ya?
Ooh

Baby girl, won't you come my way
Tell me all the things
That you wanna say
Baby girl, you can say my name
Show me all the ways
You can move that thing

I don't wanna take you nowhere
I don't wanna waste your time
Baby girl, won't you come my way
Baby girl, won't you come for me

Na na na
