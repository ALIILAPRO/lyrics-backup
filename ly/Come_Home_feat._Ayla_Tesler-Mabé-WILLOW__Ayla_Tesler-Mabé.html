		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't bear you gone, oh
You're my stars and sun
A force in the room
Of course they're confused, you're stunning
(Just wanna let you know)
When I look back, I just want you back
Don't know how to act
You were cool with that part of me
(You love me naturally)

I'm tired of this feeling, I feel so alone
I need you right now, baby, won't you come home?
That's how it be, definitely
Can't stress it, you see, life is a game, that's on me
I need you right now, baby, won't you come home?

I need you, babe
But you're far, far away
Separated by the sea
Think about you every day
I'm in a daze
Thinking 'bout all of the days
That you been away from me
Since I looked upon your face
Closer to love
I just wanna get a little closer to love
(You love me naturally)
Loss is for when it comes to an end

I'm tired of this feeling, I feel so alone
I need you right now, baby, won't you come home?
That's how it be, definitely
Can't stress it, you see, life is a game, that's on me
I need you right now, baby, won't you come home?

Am I someone by myself
Or am I only someone
When I'm with someone else
I'm done being confused, it all leads back to you
And I'm sorry
(I left you all alone)
Worked on myself, food for my health
Hope you can tell, I been doing well
I'm coming home (home)

I'm tired of this feeling, I feel so alone
I need you right now, baby, won't you come home?
That's how it be, definitely
Can't stress it, you see, life is a game, that's on me
I need you right now, baby, won't you come home?
