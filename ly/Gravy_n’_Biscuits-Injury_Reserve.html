		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Check it, yo, yo

Me and you (check it, yeah, check it)
Everything cool nigga
Everything gravy n' biscuits (yeah)
Everything's alright, nigga (I said)
Me and you (yeah, check it)
Everything cool, nigga
Everything gravy n' biscuits (yeah, check it, yeah)
Everything's all good nigga (yeah, yeah)

Humble as a mumble in the jungle, ya dig?
Can't never knock the hustle, get that shit how you live
Glad to see a new day, 'cause not everyone does
Tell my daughter I love her, shoot a text to my bruhs
I'm just glad nobody shootin' TECs to my bruhs
'Cause to not be in the Bay got me stressin' so much
New timezone every day, it's hard keepin' in touch
But all my real ones know I'll be there in the clutch
Yo, I went from Duck, Duck, Goose to gettin' fucked up off Goose
Connect Four to hittin' my connect for
Four grams or more, just to make it through the day
Now I fly for some Harold's and come back the same day, what's up?
I'm an awful guy, you bozos set the bar too low
You born in '85 and told your girl you 'bout to blow
You blew like 85 and told your mom it's for the business
Nigga, you 'bout to blow your knee out at a L.A. Fitness

Who, me? You should see the other guy
He been Mavis Beacon thumbs crampin', tryin' nullify
He been tryin' monetize handshakes and daps
I been buyin' passports for my friends, point at the map
The sky over your head ain't safe no more
And this safe place ain't your home
(Would you like to upload this to your cloud?)
The blue lights bad for your eyes, lil nigga
You won't grab the chrome (Google me, nigga)
Niggas put all they eggs in one basket
Shit happens, gotta double down on they actions
Or they hold they breath and turn around for reactions
Ain't shit happen, we well accustomed to your tactics, yo
This is just the beginning, here comes crescendo
Annie, are you okay? Peekin' out the window
Wrong info, fake flexin' me and them know
I could tell you just took the Uber sticker off your window
(Yo, yo)

Me and you (check it, yeah, check it)
Everything cool, nigga
Everything gravy n' biscuits (yeah)
Everything's alright, nigga, I said
Me and you (yeah, check it)
Everything cool, nigga
Everything gravy n' biscuits (yeah, check it, yeah)
Everything's all good nigga (check it)
