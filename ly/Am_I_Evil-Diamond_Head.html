		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My mother was a witch, she was burned alive
Thankless little bitch
For the tears I cried
Take her down now
Don't wanna see her face
Blistered and burnt, can't hide my disgrace

Twenty-seven, everyone was nice
Got to see them, make them pay the price
See their bodies out on the ice
Take my time

Am I evil?
Yes I am
Am I evil, I am man, yes 

Watched my mother die
I lost my head
Revenge now I sought
To break with my bread
Takin' no chance
You come with me
I'll split you to the bone
Help set you free

Twenty-seven, everyone was nice
Got to see them, make them pay the price
See their bodies out on the ice
Take my time

Am I evil?
Yes I am
Am I evil, I am man, yes I am
Oh oh 

On with the action now, I'll strip your pride
I'll spread your blood around
I'll see you ride
Your face is scarred with steel, wounds deep and neat
Like a double dozen before you
Smell so sweet

Am I evil?
Yes I am
Am I evil, I am man, yes I am

My soul is longing before, await my heir
Sent to avenge my mother, sleep myself
My face is long forgotten, my face not my own
Sweet and timely whore, take me home

Am I evil?
Yes I am
Am I evil? I am man, yes I am

I'm with the action now, I'll strip your pride
I'll spread your blood around, I'll see you ride
Your face is scarred with steel, your spirits dance
Like a double dozen before you, no romance

Am I evil?
Yes I am
Am I evil? I am man
Am I evil?
Yes I am
Am I evil? I am man
Yes I am
