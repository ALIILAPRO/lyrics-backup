		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, don ready, stay ready
Aye, Mr. Young Greatness, yeah

Look, God he been changing my mindset
Focus on winning the contest
I asked the Lord to just keep me from evil
And the lost some friends in the process
Guess they was killing the progress
That was way harder to digest
That's why when I'm meeting new people
I love them but I just can't let them inside yet
No, I can't let them inside

Heard what they said, I ain't letting it slide
Nevermind that I ain't moving in pride
All that I know is they ain't down to ride
Trouble it comes, they run and they hide

Most of these people distractions
Most of them come with the passion
Just not to habits
Spirit showed me that they lacking
Most of them hip to the fashion
Just not the action

Look, when they hear my records
They know that it's me
Mr. Young Greatness, I'm back on the scene
Follow the shed but I go when he leads
Fight for the fam but I die for the king
Going up levels again
Parted with sin, had to repent
I lost some friends that's not really friends
Thought we was kin

Cause God he been changing my mindset
Focus on winning the contest
I asked the Lord to just keep me from evil
And it lost some friends in the process
Guess they was killing the progress
That was way harder to digest
That's why when I'm meeting new people
I love them but I just can't

Let them inside yet
I got friends that ain't died
So I had to get involved
When you see the wounds, the scars
You gotta pursue the lost
How you not reaching in the streets
But selling webinars
You got a voice to free the slave
But make them pay a cost
Yeah, you chase the bag instead of God
And now you slick lost
You made this house a den of thieves
That's why your peace gone
Cause you's a thirst trapper
Pay me first rapper
Looking at the views
Treat the few like they don't matter
God been switching my mindset
I don't be focused on progress
I just embed myself in Christ
And I gotta trust the process
If he ain't the center then I'm stressed
But I'll get a bucket if God says
I won't let this hardened heart
Go tween tween back steps slide, yeah

K-I-N-G-D-O-M
Dog, I'm really bout it
Christ set me free from my grave
Dog, I hopped up out it
God first on my timeline
I can't sit back and don't sideline
When I write rhymes, I got a pipeline
To my father dog, I'm on the right mind
Four quarters versus a hundred pennies
Let me take a look at what the circle be
The type of brothers rolling with a brother
Really showing brothers
And it does occur to me
That a lot of people inside
Don't look at eternity
Don't give me time if they never heard of me
Thought it sad when they only hitting me back
For the cut of a check like surgery
What is our mission again
Remember it's more than a rap
They looking for swag and a trend
The devil, he making the traps
The spirit of God on the mic
Only reason we making a slap
I'm giving my music to Christ
All for the glory, I don't want it back

God he been changing my mindset
Focus on winning the contest
I ask the Lord to just keep me from evil
And then lost some friends in the process
Guess they was killing the progress
That was way harder to digest
That's why when I'm meeting new people
I love them but I just can't let them inside

No, I can't let them inside
