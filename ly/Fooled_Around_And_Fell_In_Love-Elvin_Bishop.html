		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I must have been through about a million girls
I'd love 'em then I'd leave 'em alone
I didn't care how much they cried, no sir
Their tears left me cold as a stone

But then I fooled around and fell in love
I fooled around and fell in love, yes I did
I fooled around and fell in love
I fooled around and fell in love

It used to be when I'd see a girl that I liked
I'd get out my book and write down her name
Ah, but when the, the grass got a little greener over on the other side
I'd just tear out that page

I fooled around and fell in love
I fooled around and fell in love, since I met you baby
I fooled around and fell in love
I fooled around and fell in love

Free, on my own is the way I used to be
But since I met you baby, love's got a hold on me
It's got a hold on me now
I can't let go of you baby

Fooled around and fell in love
(Fooled around and fell in love) I can't stop loving you now (hey)
'Cause I fooled around, I fooled around, I fooled around
Fooled around and fell in love I fooled around
(Fooled around and fell in love)
(Fooled around and fell in love) I fooled around, I fooled around yes I did I fooled around
(Fooled around and fell in love) I fooled around, I fooled around
(Fooled around and fell in love) I fooled around, yeah 
(Fooled around and fell in love)
