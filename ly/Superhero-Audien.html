		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Heard you lost your way
Fell into a haze
Off the beaten route

When the lights go out
All I think about
Memories with you

Oh it's like I can’t
Be the one to be there
When your feeling blue

Sometimes I drift away
And think that we escape
Is there nothing we can do

Darlin' I would guide you home tonight
If I could be a superhero
Oh I would even breathe you back to life
There’s nothing that you should fear no
When it’s tough, don’t give up
Follow the light
Darlin' I would bring you home tonight
If I could be a superhero

If I could be a superhero

If I could be a superhero

Across the ocean,
I hear you calling
Calling out my name

In the silence,
When I’m hiding
I think of you again

Oh it's like I can’t
Be the one to be there
When your feeling blue

Sometimes I drift away
And think that we escape
Is there nothing we can do

Darlin' I would guide you home tonight
If I could be a superhero
Oh I would even breathe you back to life
There’s nothing that you should fear no
When it’s tough, don’t give up
Follow the light
Darlin' I would bring you home tonight
If I could be a superhero

If I could be a superhero

If I could be a superhero

If I could be a superhero

If I could be a superhero
