		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, body right, tempted
Pretty like a night in Memphis
Ask Jesus Christ, it's a blessing
The way you move, oh my, I'm hell-bent
On whether or not I'm bold enough
Is my heart cold enough?
Wondering if I could trust you

Yeah, body right, tempted
Pretty like a night in Memphis
Ask Jesus Christ, it's a blessing
The way you move, oh my, I'm hell-bent
On whether or not I'm bold enough
Is my heart cold enough?
Wondering if I could trust you

Don't like 'cause
Girl, me know you really you want the vibes
Tease me when you open every night (yeah)
Sweep me off my feet, keep me off the grind
Pretty likkle freak, sexy likkle dime
You got me focused, can't get enough
Made me wholesome, give me that love
Tempted to touch, dangerous fun
Wait, hold up

It's giving, yeah, temptation
Feel the vibration (no)
Flooded with the sensation (oh no)
The perfect creation

Body right, tempted
Pretty like a night in Memphis
Ask Jesus Christ, it's a blessing
The way you move, oh my, I'm hell-bent
On whether or not I'm bold enough
Is my heart cold enough?
Wondering if I could trust you

She be teasing me all day, yeah
Say you have a man, no way, yeah
All these games you play, yeah
Got me confused in every way, yeah
She be toxic but
Ooh, body serving
Mind games be wild when you flirting
Eight o'clock on the dot, put the work in
My body, how your body be merging

Tempted
Pretty like a night in Memphis
Ask Jesus Christ, it's a blessing
The way you move, oh my, I'm hell-bent
(On) whether I'm not I'm bold enough
Is my heart cold enough?
Wondering if I could trust you

Tempted (tempted)
Pretty like a night in Memphis (hey, yeah)
Ask Jesus Christ, it's a blessing
The way you move, oh my, I'm hell-bent
On whether or not I'm bold enough
Is my heart cold enough?
Wondering if I could trust you
