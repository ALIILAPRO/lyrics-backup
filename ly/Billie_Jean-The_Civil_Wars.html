		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said, "Don't mind me but what do you mean I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?"
She said, "I am the one who will dance on the floor in the round"

She told me her name was Billie Jean as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in a round

People always told me, "Be careful of what you do
Don't go around breaking young girls' hearts", no
And mama always told me, "Be careful of who you love
Be careful of what you do, the lie becomes the truth"

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

For forty days and forty nights, law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand, her schemes and plans
Because we danced on the floor in the round

So take my strong advice
Just remember to always think twice
Oh think twice

She told my baby, we danced till three
Then she looked at me, then showed a photo
My baby cried, his eyes were like mine, oh no
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round

People always told me, "Be careful of what you do, ooo
Don't go around breaking young girls' hearts", no
But she came and stood right by me with a smell of sweet perfume
It happened much too soon, she called me to her room, and

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son

So Billie Jean is not my lover (she just a girl)
Billie Jean is not my lover (she just a girl)
Billie Jean is not my lover
Mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm, mmm mmm mmm mmm
