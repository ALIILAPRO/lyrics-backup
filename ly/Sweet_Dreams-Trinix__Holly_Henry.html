		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Hold your head up)
(Keep your head up)

Sweet dreams are made of this
Who am I to disagree?
I travel the world
And the seven seas
Everybody's looking for something

Sweet dreams are made of this
Who am I to disagree?
I travel the world
And the seven seas
Everybody's looking for something

Sweet dreams are made of this

Hold your head up
Keep your head up

Sweet dreams

Everybody's looking for something

Sweet dreams are made of this
Who am I to disagree?
I travel the world
And the seven seas
Everybody's looking for something

Sweet dreams are made of this

Sweet dreams

Everybody's looking for something

Sweet dreams are made of this
Who am I to disagree?
Travel the world
And the seven seas
Everybody's looking for something
