		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In an imaginary world
Every boy and every girl
They'd all get the same things
They'd all get the same things

A little dough, a lot of love
With a mom and dad to hug
They'd all get the same things, yeah

But now the world is real
And it don't matter how you feel
'Cause we don't get the same things
We don't get the same things

You gotta work to stay alive
Forty hours from 9 to 5
We don't get the same things, no

But all my gangster friends
And all my skater friends
We all want the same thing
I'm saying we all want the same thing

DJs in the clubs, Jesus freaks and thugs
We all want the same thing, yeah

And, I think about the way
All the politicians say
They say they wanna change things
You know they say they wanna change things

But every year, they take some more
And I don't know what it's for
You know they never change things

But, if you want to make it stop
Oh, first, you got to start
Making some big, old changes
Doing some different things, yeah
Get up out your bed
You better think outside your head
And, you won't get the same things, no

But all my gangster friends
And all my skater friends
We all want the same thing
I'm saying we all want the same thing

Djs in the clubs
Jesus freaks, and thugs
We all want the same thing, yeah

All my ex-girlfriends
And all their new boyfriends
They all want the same thing
I'm saying, they all want the same thing

From Wall Street to the hood
New York and Hollywood
We all want the same thing

This is a message to remind you
There's just one who coast love

But all my gangster friends
And all my skater friends
We all want the same thing
I'm saying we all want the same thing

DJs in the clubs
Jesus freaks, and thugs
We all want the same thing, yeah

All my ex-girlfriends
And all their new boyfriends
They all want the same thing
I'm saying, they all want the same thing

From Wall Street to the hood
New York and Hollywood
We all want the same thing, yeah
We all want the same thing
We all want the same thing
