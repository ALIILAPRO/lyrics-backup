		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't know what he does to make you cry
But I'll be there to make you smile
I don't have a fancy car
To get to you I'd walk a thousand miles
I don't care if he buys you nice things
Does his gifts come from the heart, I don't know
But if you were my girl
I'd make it so we'd never be apart

But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give

When you talk, does it seem like he's not
Even listening to a word you say?
That's okay babe, just tell me your problems
I'll try my best to kiss them all away
Does he leave when you need him the most?
Does his friends get all your time?
Baby please, I'm on my knees
Praying for the day that you'll be mine!

But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give

To you, hey girl
Hey girl, I don't want you to cry no more inside
All the money in the world
Could never add up to all the love I have inside
I Love You

And I will give it to you
All I can give, all I can give
Everything I have is for you
My love is all I have to give

My love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give

But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give, to you

I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
Give the world to you
But love is all I have to give

But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give, to you
