		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I admit it, what's to say
I'll relive it, without pain
Backstreet lover on the side
Of the road
I got a bomb in my temple that is gonna explode
I got a .16 gauge buried under my clothes, I play

Once upon a time I could control myself
Once upon a time I could lose myself
Oh try and mimic, what's insane
I am in it, where do I stand?

Indian summer I hate the heat
I got a backstreet lover on the passenger seat
I got my hand in my pocket so determined discreet, I pray

Once upon a time I could control myself
Once upon a time I could lose myself
Once upon a time I could control myself
Once upon a time I could lose myself
Once upon a time I could love myself
Once upon a time I could love you
Once
Once
Once
Once
Once
Once
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
