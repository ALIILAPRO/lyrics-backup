		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Time to play a little disco

What you want, what you want
What you want

You've been so conflicted
You've been so restricted
Wanna share the secret
Open your mind and see it (see it)

Picture this, it's your life
It's exceptional tonight
Picture this, it's your life
It's exceptional tonight

Time to play a little disco

What you want, what you want
What you want, what you want
(What you want)

You've been so conflicted
You've been so restricted
Wanna share the secret
Open your mind and see it (see it)

Picture this, it's your life
It's exceptional tonight
Picture this, it's your life
It's exceptional tonight

Time to play a little disco

What you want, what you want
What you want, what you want
(What you want)

What you wanna do
What you wanna do
What you wanna do

Time to play a little disco

Do what you wanna do, do, do, do, do
What you wanna do, what you wanna do
Do what you wanna do, do, do, do, do
What you wanna do, what you wanna do

What you want, what you want
What you want
