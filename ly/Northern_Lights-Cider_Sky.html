		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Every time I close my eyes I can touch the colors around me
Suddenly I realize everything I thought was impossible is here
And my heart sings in a world so incredible
And everything burns much brighter

I (I) want to fly (fly) into this beautiful life
I think it'd be nice with you
I want to fly (fly) into this beautiful life
I think it'd be nice with you with you, with you, with you

Fingertips, northern lights, tracing colors right through the sky
Underneath a lullaby I never felt as blissful as I do here
And my heart sings in a world so incredible
And everything shines much brighter

I (I) want to fly (fly) into this beautiful life
I think it'd be nice with you
I want to fly (fly) into this beautiful life
I think it'd be nice with you with you, with you, with you

Set the night on fire if we want to
Hanging out with the stars and the big moon
I very well thank you how do you do
Set the night on fire if we want to
Hanging out with the stars and the big moon
Put them down for a dance with your lasso

I think it'd be nice with you, with you

I think it'd be nice with you, with you

I think it'd be nice with you, with you

I think it'd be nice with you, with you
