		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Our love has changed,
It?s not the same,
And the only way to say it ?
Is say it ? It?s better.

I can?t concede,
This way I feel,
For all the time we spent, together,
Forever ? Just gets better .

See what I?m trying to say is:
You make things - better
And no matter what the day is,
With you here - it?s better.

I?ll stand by you,
If you stand by me.
I think time that I, reveal it,
?Cos I believe it -
It?s better.

See what I?m trying to say is:
You make things - better
And no matter what the day is,
With you here - it?s better.

Ooooh the more ? I ? talk ? to ? you
The more in love with
Ev ? ry ? thing ? you ? do

Doo doo doo doo doo doo (hum chorus)

See what I?m trying to say is:
You make things - better
And no matter what the day is,
With you here - it?s better.

Our love has changed
It?s not the same
And the only way to say it ?
Is say it ? It?s better
