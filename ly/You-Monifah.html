		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you

And if the sun don't shine
You brighten up my day
And if the rain should fall
It never seems to fall my way
And when it's cold outside
You're there to keep me warm
Those days I'm feeling weak
You make me feel so strong

You seem to bring out the best in me now
My heart can sing 'cause you make me so happy
No one else can do, no they won't do
The things you do for me, baby, baby, baby, baby

Baby you blow my mind
Every day and night
You got me paralyzed
Makes me feel so good inside

And if the sun don't shine
You brighten up my day
And if the rain should fall
It never seems to fall my way
And when it's cold outside
You're there to keep me warm
Those days I'm feeling weak
You make me feel so strong

Never have I felt a love so strong would stand
The test of time
Tell me how could I go on
If you took your love away, so far away
There would only be cloudy days
Baby, baby, baby, baby

Baby you blow my mind
Every day and night
You got me paralyzed
Makes me feel so good inside

And if the sun don't shine
You brighten up my day
And if the rain should fall
It never seems to fall my way
And when it's cold outside
You're there to keep me warm
Those days I'm feeling weak
You make me feel so strong

And if the sun don't shine
You brighten up my day
And if the rain should fall
It never falls my way
And if it's cold outside
You're there to keep me warm
And if I'm feeling weak
You make me feel so strong

And if the sun don't shine
You brighten up my day
And if the rain should fall
It never seems to fall my way
And when it's cold outside
You're there to keep me warm
Those days I'm feeling weak
You make me feel so strong

And if the sun don't shine
You brighten up my day
And if the rain should fall
It never falls my way
And if it's cold outside
You're there to keep me warm
And if I'm feeling weak
You make me feel so strong
