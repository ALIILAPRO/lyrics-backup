		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Suspended
I've been lifted by her love
I fell lifted from above
Suspended
I've been lifted by her love
I fell lifted from above

I was in and out, but drowning more and more
Sipping on red wine, I spilled it on the floor
Then I find myself, all washed up by the shore
Artificial light, a glowing phone the source
It would wake me up, alarm with no remorse
Then I find this memory when we were high abroad
Round about the time that we were still unsure
Stoppin' on this photo, I really do j'adore
The vanilla skies, we step onto the moor
In Italy, in Florence where we walk
Where the sun it shines, a yellow tint we talk
Can we go back to how we were before?
But we're not where we used to be, of course
I lost the map but still we could explore
We're going up, we're wired to the force
A force we're on course, we're, of course, we're

Suspended
I've been lifted by her love
I fell lifted from above
Suspended
I've been lifted by her love
I fell lifted from above

Still a mystery the feelings I ignore
Like running from what I've been looking for
In-between the moments, each one like sliding doors
I was in and out, time don't make sense no more
In another life, we were two birds that soared
In another life, I don't know who you are
I'm a troubled mind, reality divorced
When you ask me if I love you, I'm

Suspended
I've been lifted by her love
I fell lifted from above
Suspended
I've been lifted by her love
I fell lifted from above
Suspended (suspended)
I've been lifted by her love
I fell lifted from above
Suspended (suspended)
I've been lifted by her love
I fell lifted from above

Time issue, time travel
Back, forward, back with you
Time issue, I miss you
Life, issues, time
