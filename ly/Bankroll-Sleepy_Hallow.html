		  (Ayy, 2300 Beats goin' crazy)
(Great John on the beat, by the way)
Look, huh

Tryna watch that money grow
You know my heart cold, ain't no way you gettin' close
I just got a bankroll, 'roll, 'roll, 'roll, 'roll
Gotta make sure mama good 'fore I get my chain froze
Trappin' out the same clothes
Now tell me who had us when we ain't had nowhere to go?

All I know is run up on them bitches, tryna catch a score
Pull up on 'em, let it off, and then it's back to blowin' O's
I ain't askin', bitch, I know
We ain't fightin', we got poles
Bitch, I battle anxiety just in case you wanna know
Pack it up, I'm 'bout to go
I think I might get a rope
Sometimes I think I'm buggin', but I gotta stay afloat

If you goin' through some pain, you ain't by yourself, huh
You ain't by yourself
I done seen some dark days, I ain't had no help, huh
I ain't had no help

Tryna watch that money grow
You know my heart cold, ain't no way you gettin' close
I just got a bankroll, 'roll, 'roll, 'roll, 'roll
Gotta make sure mama good 'fore I get my chain froze
Trappin' out the same clothes
Now tell me who had us when we ain't had nowhere to go?

I been flexin' back-to-back, I know they feelings hurtin'
In a different type of bag, know this ain't no Birkin
I do drugs for the pain and I think it's workin'
Yeah, we seen him on accident, but we shot on purpose
Put that money on your mouth, yeah, it's gon' be cheap, nigga
And if you in the street, better keep your heat with you
We ain't talkin' to police, we ain't tryna speak, nigga
You know that ain't your bitch, you keep tryna creep with her
Swear I barely get no sleep, barely get no peace
And I'ma crossover if a nigga try to reach
I'm a dog with no leash, I'm on when it's beef
And I'ma do the dash if the cops know the beat

Look, huh
Tryna watch that money grow
You know my heart cold, ain't no way you gettin' close
I just got a bankroll, 'roll, 'roll, 'roll, 'roll
Gotta make sure mama good 'fore I get my chain froze
Trappin' out the same clothes
Now tell me who had us when we ain't had nowhere to go?
