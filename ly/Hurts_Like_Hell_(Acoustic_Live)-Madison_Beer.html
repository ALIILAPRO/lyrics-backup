		  I really hope it hurts like hell
I really hope it hurts like hell
(I really hope it hurts like hell)
I really hope it hurts like hell
I really hope it hurts like hell
(I really hope it hurts like hell)

My baby said he loved me
My baby said he need me
Gonna eat, sleep and breathe me out
'Til the end (yeah)
But then my baby went bad (went bad)
I guess he had a relapse (yeah)
Had to sneak, cheat and bring me down
It had to end (end, yeah)

My baby falls asleep (sleep) in his bed (bed)
Fingertips (tips) on the edge
He left me for a girl (girl)
But he regrets leaving me (leaving me, leaving me)

And I hope it hurts like hell (oh-oh-oh)
And I hope it hurts like hell (oh-oh-oh)
You shoulda never let me go
I know I'm messing up your mind
The devil got you good this time
And I hope it hurts like hell (oh-oh-oh)

My baby said he loved me (yeah, I do)
My baby had it easy (yeah)
Got to touch, kiss and please me
All night and day (day, yeah)
Remember when we took that trip to Cabo?
Twenty-four hours, then we took it to the chateau
How does it feel to do it on your own?
Missing me (yeah, yeah)

My baby's all alone (all alone) in his bed (in his bed)
Fingertips (fingertips, yeah) on the edge (on the edge)
He left me for a girl
But he regrets leaving me (leaving me)

And I hope it hurts like hell (oh-oh-oh)
And I hope it hurts like hell (oh-oh-oh)
You shoulda never let me go
I know I'm messing up your mind
But now I got you good this time
And I hope it hurts like hell (oh-oh-oh)
(I really hope it hurts like hell)

Offset!
Drop tears from my eyes (tears)
I can't cry (cry), I'm on fire (fire)
Cheatin' night 'n night (night)
No more flights (flights)
You got caught in the hype (hoo!)
Ain't take my advice
You got the steak, the fork and the whole knife
No more ice (ice)
In a course on the jet on flight (jet)
You so trife
I can't trust you sheist (no)
You gon' miss this pipe
Billie Jean, I think I'm Mike (Mike, yeah)
I'ma miss her in the bed
Fuckin' up my head, fuck it up like lice
I hope it was worth it (worth it)
Jumpin' on dick like Kermit (Kermit)
It was picture perfect
'Til the bullshit had surfaced (surfaced)
Lookin' at you like a clown
Lookin' at you like a bird bitch (clown)
I don't even want you now, you can go live on the curb, bitch (curb)

I really hope it hurts like
Like, like hell (hell)
I really hope it hurts like (oh)
Like (hell), like hell (hell)
I really hope it hurts like (oh)
Like (hell), like hell (hell)
I really hope it hurts like (oh)
Like (hell), like hell
