		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm not drinkin', I'm just smokin'
Back to back, it's hard to focus
Got the gas, not in motion
Stuck in traffic, stop-and-go shit
Overcame procrastination
I get paid without promotion
Rappers out here jackin', jackin', jackin'
They forgot the lotion, ooh
I don't wanna talk
This ain't no negotiation
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you
I'm not interested in procreation
I am not your big bro, fam we got no relation
If you not on this side
Then you guilty by association, uh

Check my reputation, you can check the résumé
I ain't finished second place since I
Was in the 2nd grade
It's second nature to me
This is how I set the stage (Stage)
Check and raise
If you bet it then they 'bout to pay
I'm a believer, exorcist of evil
Got so many demons I can barely feel a fever
This my demeanour even when I'm off tequila
Your girl is a Meg Griffin, my girl is a Mila
Let's get animated, Jolly Rancher
Fanta faded drinks in the cabana very
Strawberry banana flavoured
Go get your money girl
Gender roles are antiquated
I won't let the toxic
Masculinity contaminate it
You druggin' women, you a piece of shit
Yeah, you need to know that you need consent
You be the type to talk the talk
And then go plead the fifth
I plead the second, make you eat this dick
How does it feel bitch?

I'm not drinkin', I'm just smokin'
Back to back, it's hard to focus
Got the gas, not in motion
Stuck in traffic, stop-and-go shit
Overcame procrastination
I get paid without promotion
Rappers out here jackin', jackin', jackin'
They forgot the lotion, ooh
I don't wanna talk
This ain't no negotiation
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you
I'm not interested in procreation
I am not your big bro, fam we got no relation
If you not on this side
Then you guilty by association, uh

I get older and I grow impatient
I found money
It get harder to find motivation
I'm so antisocial, I took no vacations
I'm just rolling with the five I got
It's no rotations
They want take me out the game
I'ma walk and bock it
Pray for Austin Rucker Park
Rodney Harper rockers
I've been outta pocket
I've been causing ruckus
Y'all been outta business
Y'all some motherfucking fud ruckers
Ayy, boy you better back up
You a little too close
I suggest you fix your face
Might give you a new nose
Who knows? On the weekend I
Did only two shows
And I made enough that I could
Pay off all your student loans, aww

I'm not drinkin', I'm just smokin'
Back to back, it's hard to focus
Got the gas, not in motion
Stuck in traffic, stop-and-go shit
Overcame procrastination
I get paid without promotion
Rappers out here jackin', jackin', jackin'
They forgot the lotion, ooh
I don't wanna talk
This ain't no negotiation
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you
I'm not interested in procreation
I am not your big bro, fam we got no relation
If you not on this side
Then you guilty by association, u
