		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I couldn't manage the problem I laid on myself
And it just made it worse when I laid them on somebody else
So I finally surrendered it all, brought down in despair
I cried out for help and I felt a warm comforter there

And I came to believe in a power much higher than I
I came to believe that I needed help to get by
In childlike faith, I gave in and gave Him a try
And I came to believe in a power much higher than I

Nothing worked out when I handled it all on my own
And each time I failed, it made me feel twice as alone
Then I cried, "Lord there must be a surer and easier way
For it just cannot be that a man should lose hope everyday"

And I came to believe in a power much higher than I
I came to believe that I needed help to get by
In childlike faith I gave in and gave Him a try
Then I came to believe in a power much higher than I
Yes, I came to believe in a power much higher than I
