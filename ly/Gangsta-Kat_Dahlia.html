		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You say you a gangsta, that don't impress me none
You say you a gangsta, ain't seen a thing you done
I do it all myself, I ain't getting help
From no one, from no one

Yeah I'm young, twenty one, living in a crazy world
But I know the difference between a man and a herb
You frontin' like you got it, claim they hating on your wallet
Gucci telling you the time and you watch it,
No I ain't stunting like my daddy, he's living with my grammy
Used to be a big baller, he surviving off of gambling
But I love him, he's my daddy, yeah I love him he's my daddy
Put him in a big house before I ever see a Grammy

And my mommy started working days at the church
Finding faith in God 'cause the real world hurts
So much evil lurks, they just make us work

But we can't find work

Abuela, mommy, and the girls in a one bedroom
South Beach lifestyle, they just paying for the view
Mommy on the couch, since she was forty two
Sacrificing for the kids, 'cause that's what mommies do

So I smoke my spliff, I spliff it hard
But Candy says to stop my voice is getting too harsh
So I sobered up, and my thoughts they rush
And now I think of you, behind bars
Cross state lines, they spliffin' good
In Miami you catch a charge
And the whole family tears apart

You say you a gangsta, that don't impress me none
You say you a gangsta, ain't seen a thing you done
I do it all myself, I ain't getting help
From no one, from no one
You say you a gangsta, that don't impress me none
You say you a gangsta, ain't seen a thing you done
I do it all myself, I ain't getting help
From no one, from no one

And this recession so depressing
My parents don't stop stressing
Just hoping I learned all they lessons
And I'm paying for this session
I'm paying for this session
And I'm paying rent, food, clothes, phone, Christmas presents
Six shots in, I'm just counting all my blessings
No days off baby I ain't resting
I told my sins, now I'm done confessing

You say you a gangsta, that don't impress me none
You say you a gangsta, ain't seen a thing you done
I do it all myself, I ain't getting help
From no one, from no one
You say you a gangsta, but that don't impress me none
You say you a gangsta, ain't seen a thing you done
I do it all myself, I ain't getting help
From no one, from no one

Come way to the top, I make with what I've got
You want my number baby, I'm on a mission, catch up
Men sellin' love like thieves
But when the girlie leaves, he'll start flirting with me
So I took my heart off my sleeve
Never trust a man 'cause they all hungry
Yeah they all hungry
Never trust a man 'cause they all hungry

Right when you thought you had me
Baby you just lost someone
Finally got over you
Baby time to move on
Never learned your lesson, ain't even gone question
Why it went so wrong?
Right when you thought you had me
Baby you just lost someone
Finally got over you
Baby time to move on
Never learned your lesson, ain't even gone question
Why it went so wrong?

You say you a gangsta, that don't impress me none
You say you a gangsta, ain't seen a thing you done
