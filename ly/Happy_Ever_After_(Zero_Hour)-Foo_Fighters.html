		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The sun went down on another perfect day
Busy countin' shadows on the wall
The weeds are swallowing up the flower bed
Roses in the whiskey jar
Blood on the thorns
Drink until the taste is gone

Cracks in the floorboards are deep
From dancin' to the sound of candles burnin' out
Heavy from writin' your resignations
Licking bitter envelopes
Blood on your tongue
Drink until the taste is gone

Where is your Shangri-La now?
Where is your Shangri-La now?
Countin' down to zero hour
There ain't no superheroes now
There ain't no superheroes, they're underground
Happy ever after
Countin' down to zero hour

There ain't no superheroes now
There ain't no superheroes, they're underground
Happy ever after
Countin' down to zero hour

Where is your Shangri-La now? (where's your Shangri-La?)
Where is your Shangri-La now? (where's your Shangri-La?)
Countin' down to zero hour
There ain't no superheroes now
There ain't no superheroes, they're underground
Happy ever after
Countin' down to zero hour

There ain't no superheroes now
There ain't no superheroes, they're underground
Happy ever after
Countin' down to zero hour
