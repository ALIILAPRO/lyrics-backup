		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  "Once you've found the right doctor
And have told him or her about your pain
Don't, don't be afraid to take what we give you
Often, it will be an opioid medication
Some patients may be afraid of taking opioids
Because they perceived as too strong or addictive
But that is far from the actual fact
Less than one percent of patients taking opioids
Actually become addicted"
Talk my shit (knock, knock, knock)
Say, guess (knock, knock, knock)
Calm down (knock, knock, knock)

Ayy, deaf addict
My mathematics you can't add up
So tragic, my baggage comes with no back up
Breakin' patterns like splittin' atoms
It ain't happenin'
Cycles spin, psychosis wins
The world spins on my motherfuckin' dick like a whirlwind
Devilish sins, devilish grins
Got motherfuckers like, "Here we go again"
This motherfucker scrim Can never stop for nada
Too toxic, send his ass off to the doctor
Between the Xanny and suboxone
Lost cause lost hope
He a throw away
Way, way, way too deep in this hole where he lay
Lay, lay, lay me down to sleep
Northside shorty ride curb on creep
Northside shorty don't pray where he eat
But, ayy, soon we'll see 
A soulja by the lake buried six feet deep
Less stress on me, ,ore profit for thee
Middle finger pokin' out for everyone to come and see

Lately, lately, lately
Lately, I've been feelin' brainwashed
Ayy, ayy

Lately I been feelin' brainwashed 
Like my soul was rubbin' against the grain
Lost in the same sauce
I would complain but I'm wearin' diamond chains
Cost more than I care to explain, uh, yeah
Lately I been feelin' out of character
Bitch left 'cause I embarrassed her
But everyday I be like a thousand fuckin' miles away
Blowin' dope remindin' myself I'm the boss of the GREY, ayy
Boardin' the plane, what the fuck is a holiday?
Dreamin' through the day 
What were you sayin'? My mistake
Fleetin' attention
Screenshots and mentions
Wish I still had an away message
Forever stressin'
Live a life in a day
This a day in the life
I'm still the fuckin' same
Covered in spots not stripes
From broke to fuckin' paid this the GREY*59
Suicide for life
Rep it 'til I fuckin' die

Soldier by the lake-lake
Soldier by the lake, soldier by the-
Soldier by the lake
Soldier by the l-
Soldier by the lake-lake
Soldier by the lake
Soldier by the lake-lake
Soldier by the lake, by the lake-lake
Soldier by the lake-lake
"And any drowsiness
That might occur when you start to take the medication
Will soon wear off"
Soldier by the lake
Soldier by the-
Soldier by the lake-lake
