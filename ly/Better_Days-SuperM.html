		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Woo it's gonna be, I say yeah it's gonna be

Alright remember the times
When we were kids
Just running round
Full of hope, ignorance was bliss

Young dumb living care free
We had the whole world at our feet
That's right
Then out of the blue, it all changes
Turned upside down, when I look around
All I see is scared faces

We woke up to a bad dream
A world full of uncertainty
But mirror, mirror
I see you, and all your hopes and fears
I'm a stay by your side
So baby let me dry your tears

I know that it feels like
The world is falling down
And you can't make it through
There's gon' be better days, better days, better days
Better days, better days, better days (yeah)

Just gotta hold on
Yeah, I know that it hurts
But the sun will shine through
There's gon' be better days, better days, better days
Around the corner it's true

I said I know there's gonna be better days for you

So let me be, your guiding light
In a new world with new problems, hold on tight
'Cause no storm lasts forever (ain't that a truth)
We'll get through this together

I got you, so don't lose you, you're special, runs through you
We lost our old lives
But I swear you'll find a brand new you
We'll rise up from the madness
Like a, phoenix from the ashes

But mirror, mirror I see you (I see you)
And all your hopes and fears
I'm a stay by your side
So baby let me dry your tears (dry your tears)

I know that it feels like (feels like)
The world is falling down
And you can't make it through
There's gon' be better days, better days, better days
Better days, better days, better days (yeah)

Just gotta hold on (hold on)
Yeah, I know that it hurts
But the sun will shine through
There's gon' be better days, better days, better days
Around the corner it's true

I said I know there's gonna be better days for you
I said I know there's gonna be better days, better days

I can't fix your heart, but I can listen
Ain't got no answers, but I got tissues
Lean on me, lean on me

So baby dry your eyes
Dry your eyes

I know that it feels like
The world is falling down
And you can't make it through (that's right)
There's gon' be better days, better days, better days, yeah

I know that it feels like
The world is falling down
And you can't make it through
There's gon' be better days, better days, better days
For you, for you, for you

Just gotta hold on (hold on)
Yeah, I know that it hurts
But the sun will shine through (shine through)
There's gon' be better days, better days, better days
Around the corner it's true
I said I know there's gonna be better days for you
