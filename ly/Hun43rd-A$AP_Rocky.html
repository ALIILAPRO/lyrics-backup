		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  From the cradle to the grave, I'ma put in work
From the cradle to the grave, I'ma put in work
From the cradle to the grave, I'ma put in work
From the cradle to the grave, I'ma put in work
From the cradle to the grave, I'ma put in work
From the cradle to the grave, I'ma put in work
From the cradle to the grave, I'ma put in work

Yeah, uh-huh
All year long bruh, stuck up in my zone all by my lonesome
Pay the role my dues, I brought my own funds
When it's time to war I brought my own guns
Difference is I'm ghetto but I'm wholesome
Nigga saying I switch up like I'm on somethin'
Why you always treat me like I owe some
Truthfully you only wanna hold some
Whip it like I've been a slave
Bucking from the twelve like I've been afraid
Motorola, burn out couple minutes saved
Kept a pre-paid, on my hip them days
Hundred forty third and from the menacing
Cam'ron had us wearing pink
From the cradle to the grave
Putting work, hustle 'round the corner where my mans'd stay
Couldn't work, open up shop now from the corner store
Make 'em rennovate, with the killer's stand
Fuck a lemonade, but they cook it by the Minute Maid
Couple niggas hate but the best form of flattery is
When you imi-, when you imitate, ayy

Tell me how it's gonna be
Tell me how it's gonna be
Tell me how it's gonna be (Ohh)
Tell me how it's gonna be

With my back against the wall
Nigga I'ma ball
Show you how to ball, got it with the squad
Never had a job, but I kept a broad
When I went in Saks, went and copped it all
My cougars had me lit
Kept a PYT
Your mama on my dick
(Prettier than a bitch)
And I'm overseas
And I had to ball, seein' overseas hoes
(Really litty lit)
We ain't counterfeit like we have face tats
How you name go when, where your hoes?
Why your chain don't spin?
Light them up, really like 'em all
Nigga like it all, nigga like it
Tell her "get like me"

Tell me how it's gonna be
(Get like me, tell me how it's gonna, how it's gonna be)
Tell me how it's gonna be
(Like me, tell me how it's gonna be)
(I'ma have a ball, I'ma cop it all, I'ma buy the store)
Tell me how it's gonna be
(I'ma go ball, cradle to the grave, busy gettin' paid, niggas don't shade, nigga I'ma have itâ€“)
Tell me how it's gonna be

Bow, nigga, bow
Bow, nigga, bow
Bow, nigga, bow
Bow, nigga, bow
Bow, nigga, bow
Bow, nigga, bow
Bow, nigga, bow
Bow, nigga, bow
Bow, nigga, bow
Bow, nigga, bow
Bow, nigga, bow
Bow, wow, bow, wow
Bow, nigga, bow
Bow, nigga, bow (shoot)
Bow (pew)
