		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Where's the light killed my day
Lost in the dark of your ways
Wasted my energy, endlessly
On your sweet lie

And if you don't mind
I would like to live the lie
That I will survive and if you don't mind
I would love to slip away
And leave your world behind

Insecure, I'm not so sure that
You're not just faking something
Wasted our last day
I can't take the pain, babe

And if you don't mind
I would like to live the lie
That I will survive and If you don't mind
I would love to slip away
And leave it all behind

And if you don't mind
I would like to live the lie
That I will survive and if you don't mind
If you don't mind
