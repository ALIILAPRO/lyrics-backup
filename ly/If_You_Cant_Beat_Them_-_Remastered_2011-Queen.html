		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Keep your chin up when you're feelin' lonely
Don't let them get you down
Ain't no use in your sitting all alone
Hangin' around for someone to call
Ooh they won't come knocking at all
Don't run and hide
Even if it hurts you inside
So I said
Give as good as you get

If you can't beat 'em, join 'em
You'd better do it
'Cause it makes you feel good
If you can't beat 'em, join 'em
You're never gonna help yourself

Come on
Get up
You're feelin' good

Keep your fingers off my money
Don't try and pull me down
You're takin' me out to wine and dine me
Tryin' to wind me 'round and around
Invite me to your little contract Ha! Ha!
Rumor has it that you could play dirty
I'll tell you what I'll do about that
I'm playing at the wrong game yeah!

If you can't beat 'em, join 'em
You'd better do it
'Cause it makes you feel good
If you can't beat 'em, join 'em
You're never gonna help yourself

If you can't beat 'em, join 'em
You'd better do it
'Cause it makes you feel good
If you can't beat 'em, join 'em
It's everyone for themselves
Move on out
