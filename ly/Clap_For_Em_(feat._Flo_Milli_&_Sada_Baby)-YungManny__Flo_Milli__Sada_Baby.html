		  Hey Flo, hey
(B-b-bankroll Got It)
Dior on a nigga, fuck Gucci

uh, I'm with two bad bitches, they got ass on 'em (wow)
Damn, I love the way she clap on 'em
Shake, shake and I might throw the racks on 'em (throw the racks on 'em)
If a nigga out of state then she gon' trap for me, uh (trap, trap)
It ain't Thursday but she gon' throw it back on 'em
Damn, I love the way she clap on 'em
Damn, I love the way she clap on 'em
Damn, I love the way she clap on 'em

Too official in the game like an umpire (brrt)
And good dick make her run like gunfire
Blow her back out like a flat tire
Baby girl that ain't my baby 'cause I wrap mine
I with Flo in the club, Progressive
I'm in your hood and I ain't even checkin'
Bad bitch from the East (East Side)
I put her on a Southwest flight 
and now she fuckin' in the west end (baow)

I'm with two bad bitches, they got ass on 'em (wow)
Damn, I love the way she clap on 'em (clap)
Shake, shake and I might throw the racks on 'em (throw the racks up)
If a nigga out of state then she gon' trap for me, uh (trap, trap)
It ain't Thursday but she gon' throw it back on 'em (back, back)
Damn, I love the way she clap on 'em (ayy, ayy, baow, baow)
Damn, I love the way she clap on 'em (Flo Milli shit, baow, baow)
Damn, I love the way she clap on 'em

He love when I clap for 'em
Movin' my ass in these platforms (yup)
Bitch, I'm not the one you wanna nap on (lil' ho)
Yeah, I like to shake it, shake it (he love it)
He lucky if he see me naked, naked (haha)
I look good in these jeans when I walk by
Make him do a double take with his mouth wide (he love it)
Bitch, I'm lit like a blunt you can't get high (I'm lit)
And my trunk in the front, ain't no spare tire (ho)

I'm with two bad bitches, they got ass on 'em (wow)
Damn, I love the way she clap on 'em (clap)
Shake, shake and I might throw the racks on 'em (throw the racks up)
If a nigga out of state then she gon' trap for me, uh (trap, trap)
It ain't Thursday, but she gon' throw it back on 'em (baow, baow)
Damn, I love the way she clap on 'em (baow, baow)
Damn, I love the way she clap on 'em (baow, baow)
Damn, I love the way she clap on 'em (ayy, hold up)

It's a hoedown, got my cowboy hat on (hoedown, my hat on)
Hit her doggy style 'cause her back strong (bang, bang)
She hold the dick two hands like a saxophone (ooh)
Dope and hamburger helper on the stove (whip up)
Fuckin' Santa lil' helper 'cause she cold (ayy)
Yeah, a freaky ass bitch, came from the North Pole (lil ho, ho)
I brought two Percocets and one Norco (one Norco)
Watchin' last chance, you on Netflix, not Narcos

I'm with two bad bitches, they got ass on 'em (wow)
Damn, I love the way she clap on 'em (clap)
Shake, shake and I might throw the racks on 'em (throw the racks up)
If a nigga out of state then she gon' trap for me, uh (trap, trap)
It ain't Thursday, but she gon' throw it back on 'em (baow, baow)
Damn, I love the way she clap on 'em (baow, baow)
Damn, I love the way she clap on 'em (baow, baow)
Damn, I love the way she clap on 'em
