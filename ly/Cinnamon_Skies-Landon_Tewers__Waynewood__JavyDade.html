		  Search for you
Selfish audit
Found nothing
If i'm honest
Think to deep
Got you drowning
In your sleep
Think about it
Drop the hate to lift the mountains
Sip the wine cause heavens drownin
Speak the truth the lies will bound you
Free your mind seems lost without you

Said I'm all good don't trust me
Cinnamon skies sweet nothing
Peppermint burns so lovely
Oh oh oh sweet nothing

Hate it when I get too deep inside my head
Looking at yourself like you been
out of it
Day by day you find it hard to
recommitt
Hanging up my jersey i don't wanna play
I'm working on problems
Hard not to worry bout em
You know how
I'm rocking
I'm dodging all the drama
You stalling
You falling
And you don't seek no guidance
I'm finding a new me
I dont need anybody

Said I'm all good don't trust me
Cinnamon skies sweet nothing
Peppermint burns so lovely
Oh oh oh sweet nothing

Damn I'm back
Was thinking all alone
Eyes were on the cash now I gotta let her know
Hurts real good
Feeling something else
Good or bad I never care I probably need some help
So I know that it's you
You're worth my time
Know that it's true, yeah
Baby girl you got me working on my pheromones
Try to not abuse it I could keep you till my funeral

Said I'm all good don't trust me
Cinnamon skies sweet nothing
Peppermint burns so lovely
Oh oh oh sweet nothing
