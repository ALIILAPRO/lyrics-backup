		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't leave my light on
You'll burn out the bulb
And then I'll have to buy another
It's not like we can't talk to each other
Don't write a sad song
You'll burn out your love
And then you'll have to find another
I'm gonna shine on for my little brother

Hazy, lazy
Burning through my trees
She says that I'm crazy
But I don't let it faze me
Taste me, baby
Take me as you please
Take me as you please

I feel the sunshine
That burns away the cold
Pulling off the nylon cover
How many times can I say that I love her?
That's not for this song
'Cause I'm done with all the noise
Know that we can talk to each other
It's all good, it's all love, now it's over

Hazy, lazy
Burning through my trees
She says that I'm crazy
But I don't let it faze me
Taste me, baby
Take me as you please
She says that I'm crazy
But I don't let it faze me

Hazy, lazy
Burning through my trees
She says that I'm crazy
But I don't let it faze me
Taste me, baby
Take me as you please
Take me as you please
