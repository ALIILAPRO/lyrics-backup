		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been looking for answers
I've been looking for change
I've been looking for dancers
In the middle of the rain
Might seem a mile away
It might seem insane
You could be a smile away
Could you feel my pain

How do I reach you
What's underneath you
Keeping you safe and sound
Found what I'm chasing
Heart's racing
When you're around it feels like

Angels over me
I never seen them before
But I feel angels over me
I hear 'em sing I love you more, I love you more, I love you more
I love you more, I love you more

Got the keys to the kingdom
And it felt like a cage
I had to look for the wisdom
Right there on the page
Hey, are you kings and queens and in betweens
We're okay
Staying higher than the mezzanine
We're okay

How do I reach you
What's underneath you
Keeping you safe and sound
If you see me
Do they see me?
When you're around it feels like

Angels over me
I never seen them before
But I feel angels over me
I hear 'em sing I love you more, I love you more, I love you more

It's only a case of denial
That messes with my inner child
But you bring out the best in me and fill me with ecstasy
Like I haven't seen in a while

I see angels
When you're around it feels like
Angels over me
I never seen them before
But I feel angels over me
I hear 'em sing I love you more, I love you more, I love you more

When you're around it feels like
Angels over me
I never seen them before
But I feel angels over me
I hear 'em sing I love you more, I love you more, I love you more
I love you more, I love you more
