		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't really want no weed (hell yeah)
I don't really want no friends (hell yeah)
I don't really need no whip (hell yeah)
I don't really want no ends (hell yeah)

I don't really want no weed (hell yeah)
I don't really want no friends (hell yeah)
I don't really need no whip (hell yeah)
I don't really want no ends (hell yeah)

I don't really want no bitch (hell yeah)
I don't really want no top (hell yeah)
I don't really want no hope (pah)
I don't really want no hoe (hell yeah)
I don't really want no life (hell yeah)
I don't even really wanna die (hell yeah)

I don't really wanna do shit, bitch
World got me down and I wanna just quit (hell yeah)
I don't wanna play no shows (hell yeah)
I don't wanna make no clothes (hell yeah)
I don't wanna write you a verse (bitch, yeah)
I don't wanna talk no more

I don't really want no weed (hell yeah)
I don't really want no friends (hell yeah)
I don't really need no whip (hell yeah)
I don't really want no ends (hell yeah)

I don't really want no weed (hell yeah)
I don't really want no friends (hell yeah)
I don't really need no whip (hell yeah)
I don't really want no ends

This world is a school
No one expects to stay in school forever

Sever the limbs off my torso and burn what remains
Shouts out to Coheed
I would not be alive if I gave in to one of the times
That I wanted to be six feet deep beneath all of our feet
Hey
I've given up on giving up I found a
Reason to be in hopes you will deify me
I'm sick of writing I would rather be in Andromeda
That way it would take a billion years for you to find me

Candle wax burns on her back in the shape of a pentacle (shape of a pentacle!)
