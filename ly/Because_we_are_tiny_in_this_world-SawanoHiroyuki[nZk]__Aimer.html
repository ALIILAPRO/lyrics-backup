		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You must take a risk just
on my side
Now we are here to search
the light
As soon as moon light cut
the night
Here you go,
searching for your way
Show me your confidence
Holding my hands
Moving my heart
Wrapped around me tight
Every little things with you
All I remember,
you're blue
Come right back
Take a chance and fly
to the fight
We will all say hi
to the world
We have so much war
in this world
Let's move on
You will save me
from the despair
I will save you dear
So much strife
we can not ignore
Because we are tiny
in this world
So I say
Coming back or Give it up
for your life
Coming back or Give it up
for your love
Coming back or Give it up
for your time
Coming back or Give it up
for your chance
...For earth ...For earth
...For earth ...For earth
You are shy with me
for my love you hide so
Shut them down
with all your might
The girl you love she waits
for you
In the heat you see your goal
You are our self defense
Calming my fears
Catching my tears
Keep me in your sight
Every little things
with you
All I remember,
you're blue
Come right back
Take a chance and fly
to the fight
I will wait for you
in the fire
Die it only makes you
stronger sill
Let's move on
You will save me
from the despair
I will save you dear
So much strife
we can not ignore
Because we are tiny
in this world
So I say
Coming back or Give it up
for your life
Coming back or Give it up
for your love
Coming back or Give it up
for your time
Coming back or Give it up
for your chance
...For earth ...For earth
...For earth
Would you die for me
and our love?
We must show the earth
we care
It's a world of hurt yeah
I know
Let's move on
You will save me
from the despair
I will save you dear
So much strife
we can not ignore
Because we are tiny
in this world
Come right back
Take a chance and fly
to the fight
We will all say hi
to the world
We have so much war
in this world
Let's move on
You will save me
from the despair
I will save you dear
So much strife
we can not ignore
Because we are tiny
in this world
So I say
Coming back or Give it up
for your life
Coming back or Give it up
for your love
Coming back or Give it up
for your time
Coming back or Give it up
for your chance
...For earth ...For earth
...For earth ...For earth
