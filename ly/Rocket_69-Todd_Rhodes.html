		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Would you like to ride my rocket 69?
(Rocket 69, rocket 69)
Well, would you like to ride my rocket 69?
(Rocket 69, rocket 69)
Little, sweet man like you we could have such a wonderful time
(Rocket 69, rocket 69)
You'll have to hold tight bobble while I go into my speed
(Rocket 69, rocket 69)
Well, you'll have to hold tight bobble while I go into my speed
(Rocket 69, rocket 69)
You'll love the new world I'm going to take you in
(Rocket 69, rocket 69)
We'll take off from a star and the moon is not too far
(Rocket 69, rocket 69)
Well, we'll take off from a star and the moon is not too far
(Rocket 69, rocket 69)
We'll ride and glide and be so satisfied
(Rocket 69, rocket 69)

Stand by
Stand by
The rocket is ready to fly!

I'll make you mighty happy that I'm your girl 
We'll fly through the sky and go out of this world.

I'll bet you sweet papa I can make you feel mighty fine
(Rocket 69, rocket 69)
When you take a little trip on a rocket 69
(Rocket 69, rocket 69)

We'll zip it we'll dip it
(On a rocket 69)
We'll rip it we'll tip it
(On a rocket 69)
We'll flip it we'll whip it
(On a rocket 69)
We'll ride and guide and be so satisfied
The trip will be fine
In my rocket 69
(Rocket 69, rocket 69)
