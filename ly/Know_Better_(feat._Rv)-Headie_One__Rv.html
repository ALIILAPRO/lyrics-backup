		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They should know better
They should know better
They should know better
Melo beats Trap house mob

Bad B on the nizz
You really think I went upsie for scrum
Live corn in the shh
I could’ve let it in the uni room (Shh)
But I know better
Opps wanna see me get nicked with a shh
But I know better
Next day shh got-got by shh (Bow)
Gang done got down two this week that's shh and shh (Turn turn turn turn)
They should know better
Don’t see me in the flesh and don’t make man leak (Told me turn)
Man do shit for the gram and tweet
Man rise that shh and skeet (Shh)
How many shh shh shh shh
Let's see (One)

Man could’ve put it on the net
When gang done chinged up shh (Shh)
And the bros didn’t neither
Man just left it to the media (Simple)
They say I took a L in L (Turn turn)
But shh made a W in W (Turn turn)
Anything green get wah then oh lord (What)
Know better (Turn turn turn turn)
Anything shh shh excellent finish Mo Salah (Turn turn)
How man tell me buss my shh
Only cah they know I’m on camera
They want me in the bin Osama (Turn)
That would’ve been four summers (Suh suh)

Let me know if your favorite rapper would've shh shh shh
You feel me still out here B
Lobster steak and these things (Turn turn turn)
One

Old friends doing up commentary
But they forgot that shh got shh
Then they came over here with the mandem
And that’s just be cah Abz made Robbery (Turn turn turn turn)
Everybody do it for the net so much
They forget to go do their job properly
Shh done chinged down shh
Put one on the wing I was playing Monopoly (One)
Still see me on the opp block open toe (Trackie and sliders)
I could’ve put shh on the net
When I had man crashing on Croyland Road

Bad B on the nizz
You really think I went upsie for scrum
Live corn in the shh
I could’ve let it in the uni room (Shh)
But I know better
Opps wanna see me get nicked with a shh
But I know better
Next day shh got-got by shh (Bow)
Gang done got down two this week that's shh and shh (Turn turn turn turn)
They should know better
Don’t see me in the flesh and don’t make man leak (Told me turn)
Man do shit for the gram and tweet
Man rise that shh and skeet (Shh)
How many shh shh shh shh
Let's see (One)

OFB run Tottenham (OFB)
And I love my team like a Spurs fan (Ah)
Get round there and try burst man (Boom)
Blue Nile or I hit Kervans (Everywhere)
Them boy there neeks cheff game on fleek
Just copped new sweets straight cash no deets
My strap got grease Still stack them P’s
Ring trap all week (Trapping)
Got beef in the streets
So I invest in shells (Loaded)
Had man changing their bio
Hashtag your bredrin's world (Haha)
Try put gang on a vid (Then what)
Twenty-four hours later
Shh got slapped with a stick (Oh well)
Now opps can’t stand on their strip (No way)
All now I don’t know who my paigons are
Cah them man don’t wanna buck me (Runners)
My niggas keep up with fuckery
Slide round there with that brucky (Boo!)
Fry man like it’s Kentucky
If I don’t hit one then they’re lucky (Lucky)
If I don’t hit one then they’re lucky
But I’m still gonna try my best (Real talk)
Blow my ting and take him out the game
I’m like the ref (Red card)
In the field I slide on dem
But I ain’t tryna kick man's leg (No)
Twelve inch Rambo dip man's chest
Send shots tryna hit man's head
Mind your friends don’t intercept (Sho)

Bad B on the nizz
You really think I went upsie for scrum
Live corn in the shh
I could’ve let it in the uni room (Shh)
But I know better
Opps wanna see me get nicked with a shh
But I know better
Next day shh got-got by shh (Bow)
Gang done got down two this week that's shh and shh (Turn turn turn turn)
They should know better
Don’t see me in the flesh and don’t make man leak (Told me turn)
Man do shit for the gram and tweet
Man rise that shh and skeet (Shh)
How many shh shh shh shh
Let's see (One)
