		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And I hope that you find it, all that you need
I hope that you stay young and wild and free
You'll have America
And I hope that you're better than all of your friends
I hope that they hold you until the end
You can have America
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm

But all of our time chasing America
But she never had a home for me
All of our time chasing a dream
Hmm-hmm, hmm
A dream that meant nothing to me

And see where I found you, where they all lay
All of the greats, they are here to stay
Here in America
And I hope that you're finding, all that you are
I hope that it sets you up high
In the heart of America
Hmm, hmm

But all of our time chasing America
But she never had a home for me
Hmm-hmm, hmm
All of our time chasing a dream
Hmm-hmm, hmm
A dream that meant nothing to me

And all the parties they fade
And yes, my looks, they'll go away
I'll just be left here in America
But she never had a home for me
