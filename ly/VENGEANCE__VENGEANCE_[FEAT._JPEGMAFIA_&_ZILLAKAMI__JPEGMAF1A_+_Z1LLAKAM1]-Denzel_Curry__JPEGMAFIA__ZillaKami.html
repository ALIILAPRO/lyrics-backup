		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ultimate, Ultimate

I feel the pain, kill the brain
'Cause, bitch, I walk with vengeance
I feel the pain, kill the brain
'Cause, bitch, I walk with vengeance
I feel the pain, kill the brain
'Cause, bitch, I walk with vengeance
I feel the pain, kill the brain
'Cause, bitch, I walk with vengeance

Who the fuck you think you tryna creep on?
Who them niggas in that black Nissan?
I'm that nigga Freddy wouldn't sleep on
Catch a nigga in the bushes doing recon
Cops found a body in the alley
Gotta rock the club like a caddie
I'mma push your button like an innie
Switch it up and then I head to Cali
Chop another bitch nigga up
Put them body parts in the bag
Put them body parts in the concrete
Spread the concrete across the whole city
Plug a nigga up like a dead mitty
Voice in my head, got too many
Hit you with the metal like I'm Yung Simmie
I'mma kill everybody like they did 50
'Cause I go hard like Timmy!
Nigga wanna talk about a nigga like Jimmy, Neutron
Told you don't mess with the Z-Eltron
Banish my demon, you's in a seance
Goddamn, nigga, wanna talk about you
Put your ass in the ICU, Intensive care unit
If a nigga keep shootin', bitch!

I feel the pain, kill the brain
'Cause, bitch, I walk with vengeance
I feel the pain, kill the brain
'Cause, bitch, I walk with vengeance
I feel the pain, kill the brain
'Cause, bitch, I walk with vengeance
I feel the pain, kill the brain
'Cause, bitch, I walk with vengeance

Uh, made it past twenty-five, I'm set, bitch, let me die
Bet you respect me when I check in with that .45
Slide, ride, this a homicide, pull up to the side, let that man retire
I ain't Drake, this ain't 6ix, issa nine, sticky, clicky
I, heard you fuck with swine? That ain't my convo
Who you run to? Keep it tucked, you know my choppers shy
When they cry to Christ, if you die, you die, pussy, meet the sky
Rappers telling lies, they con too hard, write a hit like Akon
Heard you talking shit on Twitter, 40, make 'em log off
Know my plans just make you bitter, bitch, you better be cautious!
It's nasty

I feel the pain, kill the brain
'Cause, bitch, I walk with vengeance
I feel the pain, kill the brain
'Cause, bitch, I walk with vengeance
I feel the pain, kill the brain
'Cause, bitch, I walk with vengeance
I feel the pain, kill the brain
'Cause, bitch, I walk with vengeance

Put your black ass in a duffle bag
Slide off in the hopes it's a closed casket
My presence alone can exterminate masses
The tongue speed spells cause blades and rashes
Like who gonna go and betray the beast?
Like who gonna go start war with me?
Nigga, who gonna go betray the Zii?
Godzilla (Wardog), go start a feast
It's the wardog, sup (wassup)
Fired Sarge in a routine hut (wassup)
In the bottom of hell I clutch (wassup)
Hands clappin' and blood dun' rush (wassup)
No nigga can tame my soul (wassup)
Drop dead, them heads will roll (wassup)
We'll drop the corpse in the cold (wassup)
Wardog gon' stick to the code (wassup)
And now I'm money bootin', redrummin'
Body baggin', head huntin'
Police out here, feds jumping
Black metal, gun bustin'
Wardog, bitch, we gon' tape up our fists
We're the Wardogs bitch
With our rank on our wrist

I feel the pain, kill the brain
'Cause, bitch, I walk with vengeance
I feel the pain, kill the brain
'Cause, bitch, I walk with vengeance
I feel the pain, kill the brain
'Cause, bitch, I walk with vengeance
I feel the pain, kill the brain
'Cause, bitch, I walk with vengeance
I feel the pain, kill the brain
'Cause, bitch, I walk with vengeance
I feel the pain, kill the brain
'Cause, bitch, I walk with vengeance
I feel the pain, kill the brain
'Cause, bitch, I walk with vengeance
I feel the pain, kill the brain
'Cause, bitch, I walk with vengeance

Looking in the mirror
The night is gone 
And I'm waitin' such a long, long time to see you
I can't help but smile as I know the colour right
So excited, can't sit still
Gonna catch you in the moonlight
Catch you, in the moonlight
