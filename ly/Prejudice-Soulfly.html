		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Shame of all nations 
What seeds do we plant in an infant's mind? 
Seeds of destruction 
And don't you trust their kind? 
This hate is deep-rooted, get rid of the weed 
Destroying the harvest 
Of peace that we need 

Prejudice 
Shame of all nations 

We got to live in the same neighborhood 
When you take a man's life it don't mean that you're good 
Same blood runs through your veins 
Your hate proves you're insane 
See a man's face but you can't see his heart 
Don't even know him but you tear him apart 
Them kind of things, they're just killing off the Earth 
Madness, mayhem, we must desert

Prejudice 
Shame of all nations 
Breeding hate, don't need no segregation 

If dirty people are all I can see 
Then in their eyes the same dirt covers me 
Take off the blindfold, it's time to enlighten 
Come out of the wickedness, step out of the night 
One man's agony is another man's joy 
For self satisfaction we're prepared to destroy 
One man, one earth and one destiny 
To kill Satan and give God the glory

Prejudice 
Shame of a nation 
Breeding hate, don't cause annihilation 

For real
