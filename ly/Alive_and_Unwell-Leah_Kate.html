		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't wanna wake up
Can't cover up the pain with my makeup
All these strangers rip me to shreds
The beauty of the internet
But I don't make it better
You know I never have my shit together
I'm a bad drunk, can't keep a job
I'm a disappointment to my mom

Think that I might lose It
Damn, I feel so insecure
If you ask me how I'm doing
One, two
One, two, three, four

I'm alive and unwell
Some days I fucking hate myself
No magic pill is gonna help
But at least I'm thriving in hell
Yeah, I'm alive and screwed up
Ruining everything I touch
I'm a hot mess but guess what?
I don't give a fuck

Ooh, alive and unwell
Ooh, alive and unwell

It is what it is, I am who I am
You can tell me what to do but I won't listen
I'm a lost cause, I'm a bit depressed
I'm the worst even at my best

Think that I might lose It
Damn, I feel so insecure
If you ask me how I'm doing
One, two
One, two, three, four

I'm alive and unwell
Some days I fucking hate myself
No magic pill is gonna help
But at least I'm thriving in hell
Yeah, I'm alive and screwed up
Ruining everything I touch
I'm a hot mess but guess what?
I don't give a fuck

Ooh, alive and unwell
Ooh, alive and unwell
I'm alive and unwell, ooh
Alive and unwell
