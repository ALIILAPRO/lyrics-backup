		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here's to you for givin' me a chance
(Oh, oh)

Uh, shorty, light-skinned (woo), tatted, ass fat (grrt)
I need your number and that's that (that's that)
I need your number and that's that (huh)
Black hair, bob, nice teeth, smile
I like your style, I like your, uh
Shorty, light-skinned, tatted, huh, ass fat (grrt)
I need your number and that's that (that's that)
I need your number and that's that (huh)
Black hair, bob, nice teeth, smile
I like your style, I like your style

Baby, we could take it all away
Fast whips, cash trips, ass crisp
Yeah, you know I got it (what you want?)
Bad bitch, mad thick, high fashion
I don't need a stylist, I'm him
Get you there, I could fly you in (uh-huh, uh-huh)
Bad bitches, they be eyein' him (say what?)
Heard I be with Smoke and them (skrrt, skrrt)
Shake it (shake it), talk that shit you was talkin' (talkin')
Hit it from the back wit' her archin' (wit' her archin')
Have her leavin' with a limp when she walkin' (when she walkin')
I don't care if she light-skin or dark-skin (I don't care)
Pussy watery, slippery, caution
Had to murder it, put it in a coffin (damn)
"Chris, I love you," I hear that so often

Shorty, light-skinned (woo), tatted, ass fat (grrt)
I need your number and that's that (that's that)
I need your number and that's that (huh)
Black hair, bob, nice teeth, smile
I like your style, I like your, uh
Shorty, light-skinned (woo), tatted, ass fat (grrt)
I need your number and that's that (that's that)
I need your number and that's that (huh)
Black hair, bob, nice teeth, smile
I like your style, I like your style

I ain't gon' lie, I need you (woo)
Don't let me in it (don't let me in it)
I might just breed you, look (I might just breed you, okay)
She said she wanna be a teacher
Damn, in my head, she would look good as a teacher (teacher)
She would look good as a teacher (teacher), uh
Treat her with Balenciaga sneakers (oh)
Please her, baby, let me eat you
Home run, home run like Jeter (Jeter)
Don't make me catch you cheatin', beat her (bad boy)
RIP Capo, pull up in Tahoe
She said, "Oh, her brother's Wooin'" (Woo)
She said she's seen me around (yup)
She said she love what I'm doin' (I love it)
She said, "Do you remember me?" (Me)
"You was a friend to me"
We start talkin' sexually, it's been a while

Shorty, light-skinned (woo), tatted, huh, ass fat (grrt)
I need your number and that's that (that's that)
I need your number and that's that (huh)
Black hair, bob, nice teeth, smile
I like your style, I like your, uh
Shorty, light-skinned (woo), tatted, huh, ass fat (grrt)
I need your number and that's that (that's that)
I need your number and that's that (huh)
Black hair, bob, nice teeth, smile
I like your style, I like your style
