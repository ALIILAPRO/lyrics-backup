		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I think it's time for you to go 
Don't cancel your next appointment 
And don't be here tomorrow 
You've got brothers loathing brothers 
(brothers loathing brothers)
And the ones who just can't be bothered 

Leave it up to odds
Maybe you'll come greet me at the metro stop
Stream of consciousness 
You can find me dancing in the land of regrets

Turns out real love is hard to find
If she won't mind full disclosure 
I might stay here in the meantime
He was gone before he came 
(gone before he came)
By noon he'll forget my name

Leave it up to odds
Maybe you'll come greet me at the metro stop
Stream of consciousness 
You can find me dancing in the land of regrets

Hard to say what brought me here 
Young girl, disappeared
And now there's something in the air we breathe
We breathe 

Leave it up to odds
Maybe you'll come greet me at the metro stop
Stream of consciousness 
You can find me dancing in the land of regrets
