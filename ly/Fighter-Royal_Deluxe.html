		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Come back to life 
With a fire inside 
The fever is breaking 
The shadows are fading 
Away as I sharpen the knife 
Can’t take me out 
No I ain’t going down tonight 
(Ain’t going down tonight)

Not over yet, no 
Ain't gonna quit, no
No matter what, no
Never lay down, never give up

I am a fighter, I’m a fighter, I’m a survivor
Even if I fall, I’ll be up again cause I’m a fighter 
I am a fighter, I’m a survivor
Never lay down, never give up
I am a fighter

Under attack 
Sky’s going black
Sirens are sounding 
I’m screaming, I’m shouting 
I’m breaking the silence at last 
This is my life 
And I’m coming to take it back
(Coming to take it back)

Not over yet, no 
Aint gonna quit, no
No matter what, no
Never lay down, never give up

I am a fighter, I’m a fighter, I’m a survivor
Even if I fall, I’ll be up again cause I’m a fighter
I am a fighter, I’m a survivor
Never lay down, never give up
I am a fighter

Fighter, Fighter, Fighter, Fighter
Fighter, I’m a fighter, Fighter, I’m a fighter
Fighter, I’m a fighter
Never lay down, never give up, up, up, up

I am a fighter, I’m a fighter, I’m a survivor
Even if I fall, I’ll be up again cause I’m a fighter, 
I am a fighter, I’m a survivor
Never lay down, never give up
I am a fighter, I am a fighter 
Yeah I’m a fighter, I am a fighter
