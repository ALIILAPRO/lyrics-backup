		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Haven't you noticed I'm lost again?
Balance the totem
Don't wake me yet
Feel like reality's caving in
Lost Again
No one's above a losing streak
Harmony died with the sun
I'm losing steam
Under the tree where she hung an effigy
Deep in this nightmare
I built a home
No my darling
This can't be
Blood drips from your feet
Skin so freezing cold
Lifeless hands can't hold
Darling I can be
Everything you dreamed of
But I don't even give a fuck
Yeah
Funny how when I was down you left me in the dust
Yeah
Funny how you never showed me any kind of love back then
Only want me cause I'm up
Cash in
Never give away my trust like that
Haven't you noticed I'm lost again?
Balance the totem
Don't wake me yet
Feels like reality's caving in
Lost again
Haven't you noticed I'm lost again?
Balance the totem
Don't wake me yet
Feels like reality's caving in
Lost again
This is the only lie I'll ever tell you
"Kiss me like we're running fast & losing time"
Is this a dream?
I know you left
I know you left some scars on me
I know you better
Know you better hide now
Don't want me to find out
Never satisfied when your shouting through a screen
Baby are you crying?
Makes me kinda smile
Yeah
No one ever broke your heart like me
Life is violent
Haven't you noticed I'm lost again?
Balance the totem
Don't wake me yet
Feels like reality's caving in
Lost again
Haven't you noticed I'm lost again?
Balance the totem
Don't wake me yet
Haven't you noticed I'm lost again?
Lost Again
