		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Silent criminals analyzed
Through psychic waving tears
Superstitious minds collide
As silence fills the hall

Silence moving proclamations
This silence proving lies
Speechless cries, emotions dull
Shouting out across the hall

Didn't mean to let you down
I'm shouting out, so ashamed
Didn't mean to run from you
I didn't mean to shouting out

Showing weakness in your eyes
You're crawling on your knees
Roaming aimless through skies lost
As silence shakes the halls

Creeping past all illusions
Searching thoughts that hide
Silence brakes in weeping hands
Shouting out and in again

Didn't mean to run from you
I'm shouting out, so ashamed
I didn't mean to let you down
I didn't mean to shouting out
Shouting out
Shouting out
Shouting out
