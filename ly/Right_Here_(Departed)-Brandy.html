		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When you feel
Your heart's guarded
And you see
The break started

When the clouds
Have all departed
You'll be right
Here with me

Darkchild
You'll be right
Here with me
Oh-oh
You'll be right
Here with me

When you're life
Is going too fast
Off the train tracks
I can slow it down

Just when you think
You bout to turn back
Scared you might crash
I'll be your ground

When you feel
Your heart's guarded
And you see
The break started
When the clouds
Have all departed
You'll be right
Here with me
When your tears
Have dried from cryin'
And the world
Has turned to silent
When the clouds
Have all departed
You'll be right
Here with me

I'll be right
Here with you
You'll be right
Here with me

I'll be right
Here with you
You'll be right
Here with me

When you're so trapped
And there's just no key
And you can't breathe
I'll breathe for you

The fire's got you down
On both knees
And the walls
Are closing

In but
I'll be
Breakin' through

And when you feel alone
I'm a be ya home
When others come and go
Ya know I got you

When you feel
Your heart's guarded
And you see
The break started
When the clouds
Have all departed
You'll be right
Here with me
When your tears
Have dried from cryin'
And the world
Has turned to silent
When the clouds
Have all departed
You'll be right
Here with me

I will be there
Right be side
You every step
You take

I will be
Your strength
Your shelter
Shield you
From the rain

When you feel

When you feel
Your heart's guarded
And you see
The break started
When the clouds
Have all departed
You'll be right
Here with me
When your tears
Have dried from cryin'
And the world
Has turned to silent
When the clouds
Have all departed
You'll be right
Here with me

When you feel
Your heart's guarded
And you see
The break started
When the clouds
Have all departed
You'll be right
Here with me
When your tears
Have dried from cryin'
And the world
Has turned to silent
When the clouds
Have all departed
You'll be right
Here with me

I'll be right
Here with you
You'll be right
Here with me

I'll be right
Here with you
You'll be right
Here with me

I'll be right
Here with you
You'll be right
Here with me

I'll be right
Here with you
You'll be right
Here with me, yeah
