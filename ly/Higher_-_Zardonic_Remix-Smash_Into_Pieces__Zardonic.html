		  Higher

You think your life is over now
It's nothing but a bad, bad dream
Afraid to lose it all somehow
And you don't know what it means
There's no telling how it all will end up now
But you can't quit now
When you gonna feel it don't hold it back inside

If you wanna take it higher
You will set your mind on fire
When the heart is burning and you feel like turning, light up, light it up
If you wanna take it higher
You will set your mind on fire
Drowning your devotion deeper than the ocean, light up, light it up
And take it 
And take it 
Take it higher
Take it higher
Take it higher
Take it higher
Take it higher
Take it higher

You think your life's a waste of time
Tick tock then you fall behind
Try to live while you're alive
Nothing is holding you down
There's no given how we all should live our lives
But you can't quit now when you're gonna feel it just keep the dream alive

If you wanna take it higher
You will set your mind on fire
When the heart is burning and you feel like turning, light up, light up
If you wanna take it higher
You will set your mind on fire
Drowning your devotion deeper than the ocean, light up, light up
And take it 
Take it higher
Take it higher
Take it higher
Take it higher
Take it higher
Take it higher

There is something else, always on your mind always on the line this life
It's not always what you want it to be
But you, got what it takes
There's a voice in your head sayin' it's just pretend
There's a choice and it's all up to you, where you go
