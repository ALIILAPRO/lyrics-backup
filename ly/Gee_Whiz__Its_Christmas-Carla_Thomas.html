		  Hello there, merry Christmas how you been
Gee, it's so good to talk to you again
It's been a long, long time 
Can't explain why you crossed my mind
I guess it's just to wish you a merry Christmas

My best friend's having a party 
And everybody's going
I know it's gonna be a lot of fun, oh by the way
It's snowing

It's been a long long time 
Can't explain why you crossed my mind
I guess it's just to say gee whiz it's Christmas

It's funny that I haven't thought to call you before 
And why is it I haven't seen you around anymore
Another year has passed and I can't erase
The memory of your smiling face 
So I have to call you up and say
Gee whiz it's Christmas

So don't forget the party that we're throwing
The warm fires of the fireplace
Will be glowing 
It's been a long long time 
I still can't figure out why you crossed my mind
I guess it's just to say gee whiz it's Christmas

I'm wishing you a merry, have a merry merry Christmas
Gee whiz have a merry, merry, merry
