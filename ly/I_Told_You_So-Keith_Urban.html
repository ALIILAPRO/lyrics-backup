		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You said you needed your space
I wasn't where you wanted to be
I didn't stand in your way
I only want you to be happy
And, so, how surprised am I to see you here tonight?

Oh, can't you see
That for worse or for better we're better together?
Please just come back home
No, don't say that you're sorry
And I won't say I told you so

Sometimes in our life
We get to where we wonder if
The long road that we're on
Is headin' in the same direction
Well, when it comes to you and me
We're right where I know we should be

Oh, can't you see
That for worse or for better we're better together?
Please just come back home
No, don't say that you're sorry
And I won't say I told you so

Sometimes it's like we're deep in nothing but love
The slightest thing can grow so foolishly
Remind me, please
Oh, can't you see
That for worse or for better we're better together?
Please just come back home
No, don't say that you're sorry
You don't gotta say you're sorry, baby
Oh, can't you see
That for worse or for better we're better together?
Please just come back home
No, don't say that you're sorry
And I won't say I told you so
And I won't say I told you so
But I told you so
Should've known better than to leave me, baby
