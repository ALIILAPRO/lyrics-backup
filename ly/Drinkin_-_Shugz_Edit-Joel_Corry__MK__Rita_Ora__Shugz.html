		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All night, I've been drinkin' all night
I've been drinkin' all night, I've been drinkin', ayy, ayy
All night, I've been drinkin' all night
I've been drinkin' all night, I've been drinkin', ayy

Woke up in somebody's kitchen, twenty missed calls
One percent, my phone on red, how am I gettin' home?
The double vision, room is spinnin', clothes all over the floor
But I ain't trippin' 'cause I'm just livin' and every night I want more

Flashback to the deep chats with a stranger
Toasting for no reason, celebration
One night turns into a whole situation
But I would do it all again, no regrets, no

All night, I've been drinkin' all night
I've been drinkin' all night, I've been drinkin', ayy, ayy
All night, I've been drinkin' all night
I've been drinkin' all night, I've been drinkin', ayy, ayy
All night, I've been drinkin' all night
I've been drinkin' all night, I've been drinkin', ayy, ayy, ayy
All night, I've been drinkin' all night
I've been drinkin' all night, I've been drinkin', ayy, ayy
All night, I've been drinkin' all night
I've been drinkin' all night, I've been drinkin', ayy, ayy
All night, I've been drinkin' all night
I've been drinkin' all night, I've been drinkin', ayy, ayy, ayy

Last night was a movie, I'm playin' it back
Lookin' through my camera roll like, "Who the hell is that?"
I don't wanna know what I've been spending
I don't wanna see who I've been texting, yeah

Flashback to the deep chats with a stranger
Toasting for no reason, celebration
One night turns into a whole situation
But I would do it all again, no regrets, no

All night, I've been drinkin' all night
I've been drinkin' all night, I've been drinkin', ayy, ayy
All night, I've been drinkin' all night
I've been drinkin' all night, I've been drinkin', ayy, ayy
All night, I've been drinkin' all night
I've been drinkin' all night, I've been drinkin', ayy, ayy, ayy

All night, all night, all night, all night
All night, all night, all night, all night
All night, all night, all night, all night
Ayy, ayy (all night), ayy, ayy (all night)

Do a shot every night on somebody
Do a shot every night on some-
Do a shot every night on somebody
Do a shot every night on some-
Do a shot every night on somebody
Do a shot every night on some- (ayy, ayy, ayy)
