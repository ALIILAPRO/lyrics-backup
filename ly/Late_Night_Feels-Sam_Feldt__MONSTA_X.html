		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What if we go missing
Turn off both our phones
Making my decisions
Do some things we won't

Do it when they listenin' yeah
Proof's in kitchen umm
We're the only witnesses
Ooh, oh-ooh-whoa

Just keepin' it real
You know you're a steal
Like twelve out of twelve
You're my ideal
I know you got taste like
It's Gucci made cakes, right?
I'd take two ooh-ooh-ooh

Know what to do with these late night feels
Late night feels, I want you baby
Know what you do in those late night heels
Late night heels yeah, ooh-ooh

Shawty, can I meet you in the lobby? (Umm-mm)
You know we ain't waitin' for nobody (umm-mm-mm)
Know what to do with these late night feels
Late night feels ooh

Late night heels, late night heels yeah, ooh-ooh
Late night feels, late night feels ooh

We've been livin' in that midnight life
Sippin' in the same things you mind
It's true whoa-oh, yeah
They've been tellin' me I'm wasting time
With my hands around your waistline
Not true ooh-yeah

Just keepin' it real
You know you're a steal
Like twelve out of twelve
You're my ideal
I know you got taste like
It's Gucci made cakes, right?
I'd take two ooh-ooh-ooh

Know what to do with these late night feels
Late night feels, I want you baby
Know what you do in those late night heels
Late night heels yeah, ooh-ooh

Shawty, can I meet you in the lobby? (Umm-mm)
You know we ain't waitin' for nobody (umm-mm-mm)
Know what to do with these late night feels
Late night feels ooh

Late night heels, late night heels yeah, ooh-ooh
Late night feels, late night feels ooh
