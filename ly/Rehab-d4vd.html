		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sparking again
Cocaine and liquor
Hang out with your friends
I'm at the party where it never ends
I'm at the party with hella regrets
I feel like getting in trouble again
Kickstart, repertoire with a shovel again
I'm on a different level again
She fell in love with the devil again
I gotta get her out of here
I don't feel this way anymore
For the girl that I used to know
I'd rather take it slow
She thinks she's too good for me now

No room in class for a clown
It's too much for me to handle, handle
White rose petals
Broken hearts and bloody sandals
Bodies stacked on top of another
Good undercover too bad for each other, now
Or not
I've been hearing gunshots
Inside of my clouded thoughts
Do I love you a lot?
Ha, never mind

It don't matter what we've done tonight
You can't run or hide from me now, uh
Stay a sec, tryna to keep you from self destructing
Just hold on to something

'Cause we're sparking again
Cocaine and liquor
Hang out with your friends
I'm at the party where it never ends
I'm at the party with hella regrets
I feel like getting in trouble again
Kickstart, repertoire with a shovel again
I'm on a different level again
She fell in love with the devil again
We gotta get apart for now
'Cause it's obvious
You don't feel the same as you did the other day
Where'd we go wrong, I see it now
I see it now
I see it now
I see it now
I see it now
I cannot be, uh
What you want me to be, uh
Do you envy me, uh (I see it now) and my energy? uh
When you talk to me, uh
Don't walk with me, uh, don't follow me, uh
In all honesty, I don't know you all that well
I will not chase you on your way to hell
