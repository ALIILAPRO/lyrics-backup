		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Give me back all my love
I've had a change of heart
Give me back all my love
I've had a change of heart

I have opened up my eyes
Now I can see clearly
You told there's no other guy
Who would be as good to me

I fell in love and didn't stop
To think what you were doing
But now I know
I don't need you at all
You're no good for me

I've changed my mind
I'm taking back my love

Give me back all my love
I've had a change of heart
Give me back all my love
I've had a change of heart

Give me back all my love
I've had a change of heart
Give me back all my love
I've had a change of heart

I would never let you down
So you began to use me
You were always afraid of
My female sensitivity
(And you knew that)

I do my best
To give you what you want
And you abuse me
It's time you go
I'd rather be alone
Without the heartache

I've changed my mind
I'm taking back my love

Give me back all my love
I've had a change of heart
Give me back all my love
I've had a change of heart

Give me back all my love
I've had a change of heart
Give me back all my love
I've had a change of heart

Change of heart
You made me change my mind yeah, yeah
I'm taking back all the love
I gave to you, baby

Oh, oh, yeah, you
Yeah, you, yeah, you
You, give it back to me
I'm taking back my love

Give me back all my love
I've had a change of heart
Give me back all my love
I've had a change of heart

Give me back all my love
I've had a change of heart
Give me back all my love
I've had a change of heart

Give me back all my love
I've had a change of heart
Give me back (give me back)

Change of heart

Change of heart
Change of heart
Change of heart
I'm taking back my love

Give me back 

Give me back all my love
I've had a change of heart
Give me back all my love
I've had a change of heart

Give me back all my love
I've had a change of heart
Give me back all my love
I've had a change of heart

Give me back all my love
I've had a change of heart
Give me back all my love
I've had a change of heart
