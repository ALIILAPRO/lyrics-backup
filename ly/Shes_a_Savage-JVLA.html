		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She's a savage all I know
She a bad bitch all night long
What kinda magic you did on me
Because you all I want
With that body you can own me
Now I got a type it's a blonde
Lotta bitches out there want me
Lotta wolves around my hommies
Baby you can make me do whatever you want
Lately I'm not myself baby
You'll end a life don't play me
Don't play me
Don't play me
Don't play me
Don't play me
Don't play me

What did you say little bitch
Can't believe you came with a midget
Hunnid K on my neck like a widget
She loves the way I say lil bitch
I need one reason only
Got a little beef with a hommie
Your city but still they love me
Lotta hate but they can blow me

She's a savage all I know
She a bad bitch all night long
What kinda magic you did on me
Because you all I want
With that body you can own me
Now I got a type it's a blonde
Lotta bitches out there want me
Lotta wolves around my hommies
Baby you can make me do whatever you want
Lately I'm not myself baby
You'll end a life don't play me
Don't play me 
Yeye
Don't play me
Don't play me
Yeye

I do what I know
Bodies on the floor
Drunk but I want more
Take me outta door

I do what I know
Bodies on the floor
Drunk but I want more
Take me outta door
