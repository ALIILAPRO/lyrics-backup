		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been around the world
In the pouring rain
Feeling out of place, I'm feeling strange
Take me to a place where they know my name
Where everyone knows my name

Check it, check it out
I'm out to do my thing
King of the floor, king of the swing
Play a little beat, I'll be a dancing machine
Play a little jam, I'll come alive, alive
Alive

They've got jungle fever, show 'em some love
This is my home, this is my home
King of the throne, this is my home
This is my home, this is my home
This is my home

See I've been travelin' and travelin' forever
But now that I found a home
Feels like I'm in heaven
See I've been travelin' and travelin' forever
But now that I'm home feels
Like I'm in heaven

Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'ma work it
Work it out
Check it, check it, check it out
I'm okay now hey, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'ma work it
Work it out
Check it, check it, check it out
I'm okay now hey, yeah, yeah, yeah
