		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, my baby
We need some time
That's all we need
That's all we need
You pull my tie
I smooth your hair
That's all we need
That's all we need
You lose your senses
Before the storm
But let's forget it
But let's forget it
Oh, my baby
We need some calm
That's all we need
That's all we need
Let's put the movie
You choose tonight
That's all we need
Just all we need
Too much flowers
cnd too much food
That's why we live for
That's why we live for
You're my diamond
You smell the rose
That's all I say
To you
cnd remember
Love never dies
That's all you need
To know
Oh, believe me
We don't need more
c room to make love,
cnd a cigarette to smoke
I don't need more
Than our little world
That's all we need
That's all we need
We need some time
We need some cement
We need some pets, and
cnother thing to love
We need to dance
We need some wine
We need some music, and
Everything we like
We lick some ice-cream,
Buy too much candies,
You burn the eggs but
I still fall in love
We eat some bagels,
We read together,
You take the bath and
I still fall in love
Oh, believe me
We don't need more
c room to make love,
cnd a cigarette to smoke
I don't need more
Than our little world
That's all we need
That's all we need
I don't need more
Than our little world
That's all we need
That's all we need
