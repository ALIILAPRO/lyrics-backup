		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Was I a fool to ever trust you?
Gave you my all
Now you're playing it cool
As if you don't know who I am
Like the back of your hand
So who are you to tell me what I'm going through
When you abuse my feelings like they're bulletproof
Do you drown the thought of me to help you sleep at night

I'm going under
I'm caught beneath the waves
Now I can't find the surface
Through all the memories
I'm losing my mind, losing my faith
Losing my will to break these chains
That drag me down, down, down
Down, down, down to the bottom
Down to the bottom

You were like a siren singing to me
Never heard a sound so bittersweet
Beyond the breaker, calling my name from the deep
Troubled water melody, now it's got its grip on me
And all you ever do is sink ships, baby

I'm going under
I'm caught beneath the waves
Now I can't find the surface
Through all the memories
I'm losing my mind, losing my faith
Losing my will to break these chains
That drag me down, down, down
Down, down, down to the bottom
Down to the bottom
