		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Maybe I'm just always overreacting
But lately I've been feeling so out of practice with everyone
Can't put up with anyone, yea-yeah

When you're left in your own mess
(It's not my problem)
You lash out, start to freak out (freak out)
So find help from somebody else (somebody else)
You pass your trauma to me

So beat me like a punching bag
I can take more hits than you'll ever get
Watch me bleed into nothing
I'm already dead
So beat me like a punching bag

I won't even dignify you with response
It's engagement that you're craving, it's what you want
You're portraying' innocent saint, way you flaunt
While you're pacin' over graves paved in your vault

(Come on) could be something you said
Calling yourself a friend
I just want it to end
'Cause you keep beating me down (keep beating me down)
So find help from somebody else (somebody else)
You pass your trauma to me

So beat me like a punching bag
I can take more hits than you'll ever get
Watch me bleed into nothing
I'm already dead
So beat me like a punching bag

When you're left in your own mess
You lash out
Don't pass your trauma to me
So watch me (watch me) 
Bleed into nothing (into nothing)
'Cause you can't put it to rest
Soon you'll have nobody left

So beat me (beat me)
So beat me
Like a punching bag

So beat me like a punching bag (punching bag)
I can take more hits than you'll ever get (you'll ever get)
Watch me bleed into nothing
I'm already dead (already dead)
So beat me like a punching bag

So beat me like a punching bag
I can take more hits than you'll ever get (that you'll ever get)
Watch me bleed into nothing 
I'm already dead (I'm already dead)
So beat me like a punching bag (yeah)

(Beat me like a punching bag)
(You're gonna beat me like a punching bag)
