		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you only knew
How much I loved you
The sky would open up
And shine from heaven above

So come on, open up
Give me your love, babe
Tell me I'm the one
You've been dreaming of

We're dancing in the dark
While we're spinning in circles
I'll take you to the top
Where the beat don't stop

So swing on over
Tell me that you need me again

I wanna take you high
Into the night
Like the stars in the sky
We could live out our lives

I wanna take you high
Into the night
Like the stars in the sky
We could live out our lives
If you only knew
How much I refuse to
Let you on your way
Even though you're gone

Maybe you would come back
And show me the way now
Don't leave me in the dark
Here on my own

Hanging by a thread
From the web that you're spinning
Somehow hanging on
As it's falling apart

So swing on over
Tell me that you need me again

I wanna take you high
Into the night
Like the stars in the sky
We could live out our lives

I wanna take you high
Into the night
Like the stars in the sky
We could live out our lives
