		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Find yourself a girl and settle down
Live a simple life in a quiet town

Steady as she goes (steady as she goes)
Steady as she goes (steady as she goes)

So steady as she goes

Your friends have shown a kink in the single life
You've had too much to think, now you need a wife

Steady as she goes (steady as she goes)
So steady as she goes (steady as she goes)

Well here we go again
You've found yourself a friend that knows you well
But no matter what you do
You'll always feel as though you tripped and fell

So steady as she goes

When you have completed what you thought you had to do
And your blood's depleted to the point of stable glue

Then you'll get along
Then you'll get along

Steady as she goes (steady as she goes)
So steady as she goes (steady as she goes)

Well here we go again
You've found yourself a friend that knows you well
But no matter what you do
You'll always feel as though you tripped and fell

So steady as she goes
Steady as she goes

Settle for a world (settle for the world), neither up or down (neither up or down)
Sell it to the crowd (sell it to the crowd) that is gathered round (that is gathered round)

Settle for a girl (settle for the girl), neither up or down (neither up or down)
Sell it to the crowd (sell it to the crowd) that is gathered round (that is gathered round)

So steady as she goes (steady as she goes)
Steady as she goes (steady as she goes)

Steady as she goes (steady as she goes)
So steady as she goes (steady as she goes)

Steady as she goes, are you steady now?
Steady as she goes, are you steady now?

Steady as she goes, are you steady now?
Steady as she goes, are you steady now?

Steady as she goes
