Audemar, huh, on God, huh
Take it off, huh, get in car, huh
Shorty ride dick like a porn star, huh
I'm a soul eater like Black Star, huh
And she let me beat, feel it in her feet
Diamonds in my teeth, talk ain't cheap
Waka-waka, ayy, ayy, ayy, hypebeast
What a nigga say? Hey, wanna fight, B?
Audemar, huh, on God, huh
Take it off, huh, get in car, huh
Shorty ride dick like a porn star, huh
I'm a soul eater like Black Star, huh
And she let me beat, feel it in her feet
Diamonds in my teeth, talk ain't cheap
Waka-waka, ayy, ayy, ayy, hypebeast
What a nigga say? Hey, wanna fight, B?

Treat that pussy just like ping pong
Back and forth just like I'm King Kong
At your city, nigga, ding dong
At your phone, I'm like a, ayy, uh
At your front door like Jehovah Witness
I'm too kind so I'ma spare the witness (ayy, okay)
Fresher than a nigga with a retwist (okay, okay)
Dreads is real as fuck, they not extensions
Count up my fetti, I cheat on Margiela
Like Finding Nemo, I hope you go belly up
Never mind, kill 'em with kindness
Call me your highness, heard your boyfriend, got a 'gina
These niggas slow like some tortoises, huh
I got machine gun like Portishead, hmm
Bitch, I am Rick like The Walking Dead, uh
You fuck around, leave you walking dead, hm

Audemar, huh, on God, huh
Take it off, huh, get in car, huh
Shorty ride dick like a porn star, huh
I'm a soul eater like Black Star, huh
And she let me beat, feel it in her feet
Diamonds in my teeth, talk ain't cheap
Waka-waka, ayy, ayy, ayy, hypebeast
What a nigga say? Hey, wanna fight, B?
Audemar, huh, on God, huh
Take it off, huh, get in car, huh
Shorty ride dick like a porn star, huh
I'm a soul eater like Black Star, huh
And she let me beat, feel it in her feet
Diamonds in my teeth, talk ain't cheap
Waka-waka, ayy, ayy, ayy, hypebeast
What a nigga say? Hey, wanna fight, B?

Niggas want war, but it ain't likely
Boy, you know, threats I don't take lightly
Better have hands if you gon' fight me
Got a quick left jab and that shit's light-speed
Niggas say I'm next up and I just might be
Started from the bottom they ain't know a lot about him
All I had was Ramen noodles and a little iced tea
Now my life's like a movie, motherfuckin' Spike Lee
I just want canaries on my wristwatch, yeah
Niggas get buried in the slipknot, woah
Shorty think I'm married, but my dick's not, uh
I ain't get married 'til my dick drop, yeah
I just wanna hit it in some flip flops, woah
I don't want kids, I don't lip-lock, no
If you want love, better kick rocks, yeah
I'm a rock star, hoe, Kid Rock, yeah

Audemar, huh, on God, huh
Take it off, huh, get in car, huh
Shorty ride dick like a porn star, huh
I'm a soul eater like Black Star, huh
And she let me beat, feel it in her feet
Diamonds in my teeth, talk ain't cheap
Waka-waka, ayy, ayy, ayy, hypebeast
What a nigga say? Hey, wanna fight, B?
Audemar, huh, on God, huh
Take it off, huh, get in car, huh
Shorty ride dick like a porn star, huh
I'm a soul eater like Black Star, huh
And she let me beat, feel it in her feet
Diamonds in my teeth, talk ain't cheap
Waka-waka, ayy, ayy, ayy, hypebeast
What a nigga say? Hey, wanna fight, B?

Uh-huh
Uh-huh
On God, huh
Uh-huh
Uh-huh
Audemar, huh
