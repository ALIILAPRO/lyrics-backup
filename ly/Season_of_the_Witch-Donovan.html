		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I look out my window
Many sights to see
And when I look in my window
So many different people to be
That it's strange, so strange

You've got to pick up every stitch
You've got to pick up every stitch
You've got to pick up every stitch
Mmm, must be the season of the witch
Must be the season of the witch, yeah
Must be the season of the witch

When I look over my shoulder
What do you think I see?
Some other cat lookin' over
His shoulder at me
And he's strange, sure, he's strange

You've got to pick up every stitch
You've got to pick up every stitch, yeah
Beatniks are out to make it rich
Oh no, must be the season of the witch
Must be the season of the witch, yeah
Must be the season of the witch

You've got to pick up every stitch
The rabbits running in the ditch
Beatniks are out to make it rich
Oh no, must be the season of the witch
Must be the season of the witch
Must be the season of the witch

Where'd I go?

When I look out my window
What do you think I see?
And when I look in my window
So many different people to be
It's strange, sure is strange
You've got to pick up every stitch
You've got to pick up every stitch
The rabbits running in the ditch
Oh no, must be the season of the witch
Must be the season of the witch, yeah
Must be the season of the witch
Where'd I go?
Where'd I go?
