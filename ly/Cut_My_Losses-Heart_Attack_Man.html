		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You told me you're gonna kill yourself, and that it's all cuz of me. You said ""Read it in my suicide letter,' but I never found your obituary. I couldn't find your name. Driving me insane, how bad I let you twist and fold me. I can't help the fact you hate yourself, and felt that you should take it all out on me. I don't hope you're doing better. I'll just cut my losses. I'll walk down the road, you'll go across it just get away from me. One thousand times you tried, you pulled me down every single time. Sink your teeth into my neck while I'm sleeping suck the life out of me. Say you're gonna paint the walls with your brain, because you want to see me worry. Go ahead and load your gun. Go and tie your noose. Do what you got to do to crack me open. You'll wring me out, hang me up and bleed me dry, and pass me through the ringer till it's broken. You said I'll read it in your letter. I'll just cut my losses. I'll walk down the road, you'll go across it just get away from me. One thousand times you tried, you pulled me down every single time. One thousand times I tried, I realized I had your back unreciprocated every time.
