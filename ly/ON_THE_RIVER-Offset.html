		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Black leaves on the Mississippi River
Black leaves in the Mississippi fire (Southside on the track, yeah)
Black leaves in the Mississippi choir
Black leaves on the Mississippi land

White Rove' (white)
Twenty hoes (twenty), white gold (white)
Mink roll (mink), lotta pink toes (pink)
Ricky O. (woo), Margiela, you didn't know (Margiela)
We pop G6's, make the bitch go sicko mode (G6)
Up the status, I bust her down, the bitch the baddest (baddest)
The racks in the attic (woo)
I doubled the money, dope mathematics (I doubled it)
My cars the fastest (rah)
I'm flippin' the bitch, I'm knowin' gymnastics (uh-uh)
I Elliot diamond, I twinkle the wrist, you need some glasses (twinkle, twinkle)
It's hard to catch me (woo)
I bulletproof trucks, I could move in madness (bullet)
They thought it was Madden
We ballin' on niggas, go get you a basket (baow)
The money come blue (woo)
I bought me a watch, but it cost me a coupe (a coupe)
Set it off like a nuke (set it off)
I'ma turn me a hundred 'fore I leave the booth (lets go)
I had got off the juice (woo)
Then the money start blowin' up out of the roof (blow it)
I'm tellin' the truth, I became the one when I got out the group
Don't got to say it, they bitin' aesthetics
If I'm shootin' my shot, then I know I'ma wet it
I put my son in baguetties before he could walk, he could talk and that shit was too heavy (so heavy)
I had, I had to drop my top on Biscayne, knowin' a nigga regret it (Biscayne)
I had to smash on her and her friend and told them both they petty (they petty)
I got the drop all on my opps, I told them boys to shred it (shred it)
I got a foreign fetish (fetish), I am the one, you get it? (Hey)

Black leaves on the Mississippi River
Black leaves in the Mississippi fire
