		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, turn me up a lil' bit, overall
Yeah, ooh, ooh (no, no)
(Great John on the beat, by the way) (yeah, yeah)

First nigga play, I bet he die (bah)
Bet he get left up in the sky (bah)
Niggas been hatin', wonder why? (Bah)
I been just lettin' bullets fly (bah)
Hear niggas talkin' on the book (bah)
They don't wanna see us, Smiley Drive (bah)
Hear niggas talkin' on the book (bah, bah, bah)
They don't wanna see a homicide (bah, bah, bah)
We gon' wet 'em up, wet 'em up
I don't talk once through the cellular
Been in that field, I'ma do drills
Shit, it ain't 'bout nothin', it's regular
And I been in that timin', don't lighten up
Don't you think about playin', I been gettin' up
I don't drill a nigga (grr)
I said, "Drill a nigga", maybe kill a nigga, bitch

.40 go dumb, I gave my lil' bro a drum, what else?
Nigga, you dumb, caught him, he ain't have his gun
I'm gettin' paper, ain't got time for niggas, that's just what they want
I don't mean swingin' when I say that MAC leave a nigga swung
Look at the body, he red
No cameras on him so he might just beat it
And niggas don't tell on the stand
Hope niggas don't tell on the stand
All these opp niggas really be feds (feds)
Stay on my dick, I know they mad (bah)
Said they been gettin' the Benz
Then gotta have me a plan, tryna get played

Rip the guys, free the guys
If he disrespect then he should die
He ain't gettin' to the money, he a liar
Huh, throw the Gs up in the sky
Huh, put it plain, any who want it
You know they get it, for the gang
Huh, act like you want it, then you can get it
Look, run up the numbers and move like a runnin' back, huh
You know we run up them numbers
So baby, talk money, we into that, huh
You know we run up them numbers
So baby, talk money, we into that
(You know we run up them numbers)
(Baby, talk money, we into that)

Uh, look, we put the whole city on the map
Look, whole city on my back
Two or three hoes with me, couple bros with me
They gon' go for me, that's a fact
Pop out, we on timin', huh, yeah, we on timin'
Ask my opps, man, they gon' lie
Ridin' 'round block with a big ol' nine
We don't get Shiggy, nah
We never get Shiggy
Back out, chops, niggas gettin' busy
Roll up the pack, niggas gettin' splizzy
I ain't with your sis, prolly with your bitty
Ooh, and I get love in my city
Ooh, but ain't no love in my city
Pull up, you catch a slug, on my mama
I gotta wet 'em up, that's a problem
I gotta do it, huh, huh
Run up that bag, know I'm gettin' to it
Ooh, she wanna do it, she wanna fuck to my music
No corona, boy, I'm too sick
I just been coppin' all this new drip
Hol' on, wait, huh, she want Chanel, I just wanna hit
Name ring bells all up on your strip
Toilet gang, nigga, I'm the shit
(Toilet gang, nigga, I'm the shit)
(Uh, Toilet gang, nigga, I'm the-)

First nigga play, I bet he die (bah)
Bet he get left up in the sky (bah)
Niggas been hatin', wonder why? (Bah)
I been just lettin' bullets fly (bah)
Hear niggas talkin' on the book (bah)
They don't wanna see us, Smiley Drive (bah)
Hear niggas talkin' on the book (bah, bah, bah)
They don't wanna see a homicide (bah, bah, bah)
We gon' wet 'em up, wet 'em up
I don't talk once through the cellular
Been in that field, I'ma do drills
Shit, it ain't 'bout nothin', it's regular
And I been in that timin', don't lighten up
Don't you think about playin', I been gettin' up
I don't drill a nigga (grr)
I said, "Drill a nigga", maybe kill a nigga, bitch
