		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I stay out too late
Got nothing in my brain
That's what people say (mmm mmm)
That's what people say (mmm mmm)

I go on too many dates
But I can't make them stay
At least that's what people say (mmm mmm)
That's what people say (mmm mmm)

But I keep cruising
Can't stop, won't stop moving
It's like I got this music in my mind
Saying it's gonna be alright

I never miss a beat
I'm lightning on my feet
And that's what they don't see (mmm hmm)
That's what they don't see (mmm hmm)

Players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off

Heartbreakers gonna break
Fakers gonna fake
I'm just gonna shake
I shake it off, I shake it off

I shake it off, shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, shake it off
