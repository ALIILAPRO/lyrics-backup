		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Grew up vicious like black panthers 
Mentors, drug dealers and gang bangers 
A lot of badman, defo some good man 
I learnt to hustle man, I defo learnt the jug 
Ride for my bruddas, and I'll buss through your hood 
Should I see man violate and I'll do it cah I could 
Lion hearted in this concrete jungle
The clean hearted turn devil in the struggle 

Thats still no excuse 
Kanye got a billion, man I can too 
Main prayer unity then the wealth comes too 
Gorillas, goats and snakes in my zoo 
I'm a black star, west side of Africa  
Warrior, guidance from my ancestor 
My sorcerer, speaking on my future
Friends de tight like Rachael and Monica

Prayers in the mosque I know Elon 
Good die young I must live long 
Close friends really became distance 
Abdul never forget where you come from 
Prayers for knowledge and the wisdom 
Back as a youngen it was for funds
Now the money coming in abundance 
Another girlie said she wanna one dance

Calls me starboy she sees it in me 
Still feel illegal, my passport is green 
Why is student finance still chasing me
They didn't gimme p's, I funded me 
All'a this pain no need amoxicillin 
Only remedy is through melody 
Dark shades on they can't see what I see
Told baby girl please don't trust in me

Don't end up a victim tryna be the bad guy 
Area boyz ain't a brand, it's a franchise 
Shit ain't been the same ever since unc died 
Ain't my blood but we still got family ties 
From your stance I can tell that you're telling lies
Bro went legit from county lines 
You ain't seen the ghost before you see KWAY live
My guy will smoke you for less than a 3.5

Bro done the dirt and still buss case 
Rolex cost more than a CLA
If she bad enough, fly her go LA 
Acting like my guy but I know you hate 
Teshie taught me to appreciate what I got
Hackney taught me take what's mine n yours 
Like bro can't forget wear I'm from 
That's why I rob man I give thanks to my lord
