		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's quiet now and what it brings is everything
Comes calling back a brilliant night
I'm still awake
I looked ahead
I'm sure I saw you there
You don't need me to tell you now
That nothing can compare

You might've laughed if I told you
You might have hidden your frown
You might've succeeded in changing me
I might've been turned around
It's easier to leave than to be left behind
Leaving was never my proud
Leaving New York never easy
I saw the light fading out

Now life is sweet and what it brings
I tried to take
The loneliness it wears me out
It lies in wait
And on a loss still in my eyes
Shatter a necklace across your thigh
I might've lived my life in a dream
But I swear this is real
Memory fuses, and shatters like glass
Mercurial future forget the past
But it's you, it's what I feel

You might've laughed if I told you
(It's pulling me apart)
You might have hidden your frown (change)
You might've succeeded in changing me
(It's pulling me apart)
I might've been turned around (change)
It's easier to leave than to be left behind
(It's pulling me apart)
Leaving was never my proud (change)
Leaving New York never easy
(It's pulling me apart)
I saw the light fading out

You find it in your heart, it's pulling me apart
You find it in your heart (change)

I told you forever, I love you it's forever
I told you if I love you, I love you forever
I told you forever, I love you it's forever
I told you if I love you, I love you forever
You never

You might've laughed if I told you
(It's pulling me apart)
You might have hidden your frown (change)
You might've succeeded in changing me
(It's pulling me apart)
I might've been turned around (change)
It's easier to leave than to be left behind
(It's pulling me apart)
Leaving was never my proud (change)
Leaving New York never easy
(It's pulling me apart)
I saw the light fading out (change)

Leaving New York never easy
(It's pulling me apart)
I saw the light fading out (change)
Leaving New York never easy
(It's pulling me apart)
I saw the light fading out (change)
