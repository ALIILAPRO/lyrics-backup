		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I invite you
To look in my eyes
It can be scary
But it's my best advice
Do not be led
By the lies of a life
But I just know
I have to be your wife

Spread you heart
Spread your love
Spread your soul
Spread your skin
Spread your everything
'Cause I wanna come in

I invite you
To take my heart
It can be scary
But it's my best part
Do not be led
By the lies of a life
But I just know
I have to be your wife
 
Spread you heart
Spread your love
Spread your soul
Spread your skin
Spread your everything
'Cause I wanna come in

Invite you (x6)

Spread your love
Spread you heart
Spread your mind
And spread your soul
Oh, spread your everything
'Cause I wanna come in (x2)

Spread your love
Spread you heart
Spread your mind
Spread your soul
Spread your eyes
Spread your vains
Spread your toes
Spread your chains
Spread your everything

'Cause I wanna come in
I, I invite you
