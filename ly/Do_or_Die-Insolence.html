		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It happen again like the time before
Took a trip through my mental and find a small door
To a passage written through time this is my mind set
You find it deeper inside the strong-minded
I find the energy and feel ire
Changes the gravity inside of me
We have no time to fret
No time for regret
If the poison doesn't kill us we comin live and direct

This is my life
This is my hell
Straight took a journey
to the poison well
This is my life
This is my hell
Straight took a journey
to the poison well

My brain strain
I feel no pain
All kinds a chemicals race through my brain
This and that well let me counteract
I'm lost in the vortex and aint comin back
I become you and you become me
Lost in dream of fact or fantasy
Hallucinations from red to green
Find the calculations for why we fiend

This is my life
This is my hell
Straight took a journey
to the poison well
This is my life
This is my hell
Straight took a journey
to the poison well
This is my life
This is my hell
Straight took a journey
to the poison well
This is my life
This is my hell
Straight took a journey
to the poison well
This is my life
This is my hell
Straight took a journey
to the poison well
This is my life
This is my hell
Straight took a journey
to the poison well

Yo Yo
I can see clearly despite all the nonsense
I can see clearly despite all the bullshit
You can break it down but it still makes no sense
I can see clearly despite all the nonsense

This is my brain
So sick science cant even contain
Is there any thought process that remains
This is my brain
So sick science cant even contain
Is there any thought process that remains

This is my life
This is my hell
Straight took a journey
to the poison well
This is my life
This is my hell
Straight took a journey
to the poison well
This is my life
This is my hell
Straight took a journey
to the poison well
This is my life
This is my hell
Straight took a journey
to the poison well
This is my life
This is my hell
Straight took a journey
to the poison well
This is my life
This is my hell
Straight took a journey
to the poison well

What is the poison
What do you think
What is the poison
what do you think
