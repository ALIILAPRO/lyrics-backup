		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Without the evidence 
(Evidence, enough evidence for me)
Without the evidence, you're evidence (yeah, oh)
(Enough evidence for me)
Without the evidence 
(Enough evidence for me)
Without the evidence, you're evidence

Elegant, best of intentions
Prayerful being, had those beautiful lessons
Lovely way of seeing things
Making me believe in things

Without the evidence, you're evidence
You're enough evidence for me
You're enough evidence for me, you're 
You're enough evidence for me

Immanence, that there's the feeling
Wake in the morning and I stare at you dreaming
Little one, so new to things
Making me believe in things

Without the evidence, you're evidence
You're enough evidence for me
Without the evidence, you're evidence
You're enough evidence for me (your)
Without the evidence, you're evidence
Enough for me
Without the evidence, you're evidence (enough)
Enough for me

Searching and reading 
The writings for evidence of meaning 
When the cruelties screaming won't subside
An angel is teething, giving me more reasons
To watch what I'm eating and how I spend my time
Can't shake the feeling, the motion, the fiending
For something to to lean in when I keep wondering why
A telescope, a legion, stars in a region
I wonder if they're seeking
The same thing as I

I-I-I can get stuck on perfection
I can get lost in directions
I can be gone in a sec, yeah
In a second
Sorry I lost the connection
I can get lost in reflection
I can be gone in a sec, yeah
In a second
