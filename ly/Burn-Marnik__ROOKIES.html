		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
You look familiar, skin like vanilla
You're onto me, I'm onto you
I gotta make it work
In my blood like tequila
And it's making me weaker
I look, you look
Our bodies talk, no need to say a word

And you're dancing like nobody else, nobody's watching
And if you let me, I wanna take it, I wanna take it

Slow oh oh, all the way
We can go oh oh
You're a fire, you're a fire
I wanna burn
Burn, burn, burn it up
Up, up, let you know oh oh
You're a fire, you're a fire
I wanna burn

(You're a fire, you're a fire, you're a fire)
(I wanna burn)
(You're a fire, you're a fire, you're a fire)
(I wanna burn)
(You're a fire, you're a fire, you're a fire)
(I wanna burn)
(You're a fire you're a fire)
You're fire I wanna burn

Now we got familiar
We melt like we're chocolate
I taste your love, you're like a drug
Yeah I'm gonna give you all
All my attention, to all your dimensions
Let's do the things we're made to do
And let our bodies talk

Let's do it like nobody else, nobody's watching
And if you let me, I wanna take it, I wanna take it

Slow oh oh, all the way
We can go oh oh
You're a fire, you're a fire
I wanna burn
Burn, burn, burn it up
Up, up, let you know oh oh
You're a fire, you're a fire
I wanna burn

(You're a fire, you're a fire, you're a fire)
(I wanna burn)
(You're a fire, you're a fire, you're a fire)
(I wanna burn)
(You're a fire, you're a fire, you're a fire)
(I wanna burn)
(You're a fire you're a fire)

I wanna take it, I wanna take it
Slow oh oh oh, all the way
We can go oh oh oh
You are fire, you are fire
I wanna burn
Burn, burn, burn it up
Uh uh, let you know oh oh
You are fire, you are fire
I wanna burn

(You're a fire, you're a fire, you're a fire)
(I wanna burn)
(You're a fire, you're a fire, you're a fire)
(I wanna burn)
(You're a fire, you're a fire, you're a fire)
(I wanna burn)
(You're a fire you're a fire)
You're a fire I wanna burn
(You're a fire, you're a fire, you're a fire)
(I wanna burn)
(You're a fire, you're a fire, you're a fire)
(I wanna burn)
(You're a fire, you're a fire, you're a fire)
(I wanna burn)
(You're a fire you're a fire)
I wanna take it, I wanna take it slow, oh oh
All the way we can go, oh oh
You're a fire, you're a fire
I wanna burn
Burn, burn, burn it up
Up, up, let you know oh oh
You're a fire, you're a fire
I wanna burn
(You're a fire, you're a fire, you're a fire)
(I wanna burn)
(You're a fire, you're a fire, you're a fire I wanna burn)
