		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Gravity is working against me
And gravity wants to bring me down

Oh, I'll never know
What makes this man, with all the love that his heart can stand
Dream of ways to throw it all away

Whoa, whoa
Gravity is working against me
And gravity wants to bring me down

Oh, twice as much ain't twice as good
And can't sustain like one half could
It's wanting more that's gonna send me to my knees

Oh, twice as much ain't twice as good
And can't sustain like one half could
It's wanting more that's gonna send me to my knees

Whoa, whoa
Gravity, stay the hell away from me
Whoa, whoa
Gravity has taken better men than me
Now how can that be?

Just keep me where the light is
Just keep me where the light is
Just keep me where the light is
Come on, keep me where the light is
Come on, keep me where the light is
Come on, keep me where, now, keep me where the light is
