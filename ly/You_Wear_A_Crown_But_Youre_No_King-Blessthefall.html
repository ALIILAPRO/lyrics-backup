		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Watching your empire fall

You'll never stop 'til you get what you want
You think you have control
You tried to take mine
But I won't leave 'til I get what I want
Over and over bending and breaking

Watching your empire fall
Watching the ashes fall

Will it ever cross your mind?
I'm the man you'll never be
Think about me when you're all alone
Without someone to love (without someone to love)

Am I gonna be the last one standing?
How's it gonna feel when I'm on top?
I guess I'll watch you walk away (away)

Don't waste my time
You've got this upside down
What were you thinking of?
What were you thinking of?
You've got this upside down
What were you thinking of?
What were you thinking of?

Watching your empire fall
Watching the ashes fall

Will it ever cross your mind?
I'm the man you'll never be
Think about me when you're all alone
Without someone to love
You're out there on your own

Am I gonna be the last one standing?
How's it gonna feel when I'm on top?
I guess I'll watch you walk away
And let your empire crumble

Am I gonna be the last one standing?
How's it gonna feel when I'm on top
I guess I'll watch you walk away
Watch your empire crumble

You decide what's next for us
Over and over you sold me out
You decide what's next for us
Over and over bending and breaking

You decide what's next for us
You decide what's next for us

You'll never learn, you never will
You'll never learn, you never will

You decide what's next for us
You decide what's next for us
