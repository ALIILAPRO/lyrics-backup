		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yo, why is Jadakiss as hard as it gets?
Why is the industry designed to keep the artist in debt?
And why them dudes ain't riding if they part of your set?
And why they never get it popping but they party to death?
Yea, and why they gonna give you life for a murder?
Turn around only give you eight months for a burner? It's going down
Why they selling niggas CD's for under a dime?
And if it's all love, daddy, why you come with your 9?
Why my niggas ain't get that cake?
Why is a brother up north better than Jordan
That ain't get that break?
Why you don't stack instead of trying to be fly?
Why is ratting at an all time high?
Why are you even alive?
Why they kill 2pac n' Chris?
Why, at the bar, you ain't take straight shots instead of poppin Cris?
Why them bullets have to hit that door?
Why did Kobe have to hit that raw?
Why'd he kiss that whore?
Why?

All that I've been given
Is this pain that I've been living
They got me in the system
Why they gotta do me like that?
Tried to make it my way
But got sent up on the highway
Why? Oh why
Why they gotta do me like that?

Why do niggas push pounds and powder?
Why did Bush knock down the towers?
Why you around them cowards?
Why Aaliyah have to take that flight?
Why my nigga D ain't pull out his Ferrari
Why he take that bike?
Why they gotta open your package and read your mail?
Why they stop letting niggas get degrees in jail?
Why you gotta do 85% of your time?
And why do niggas lie in 85% of they rhymes?
Why a nigga always want what he can't have?
Why I can't come through in the pecan Jag?
Why did crack have to hit so hard?
Even though it's almost over
Why niggas can't get no jobs?
Why they come up with the witness protection?
Why they let the Terminator win the election?
Come on, pay attention!
Why I sell in the stores what you could sell in the streets?
Why I say the hottest shit but we sellin' the least?

All that I've been given
Is this pain that I've been living
They got me in the system
Why they gotta do me like that?
Tried to make it my way
But got sent up on the highway
Why? Oh why
Why they gotta do me like that?

Why Halle have to let a white man pop her to get a Oscar?
Why Denzel have to be crooked before he took it?
Why they didn't make the CL6 with a clutch?
And if you don't smoke why the hell you reaching for my dutch?!
Why rap? Cause I need air time
Why be on the curb with a "Why lie? I need a beer" sign?
Why all the young niggas is dying?
Cause they moms at work, they pops is gone, they living with iron
Why they ain't give us a cure for AIDS?
Why my diesel have fiends in the spot on the floor for days?
Why you screaming like it's a slug? It's only the hawk
Why my buzz in L.A. Ain't like it is in New York?
Why they forcing you to be hard?
Why ain't you a thug by choice?
Why the whole world love my voice?
Why? Try to tell 'em that it's the flow son
And you know why they made the new twenties?
Cause I got all the old ones
That's why

All that I've been given
Is this pain that I've been living
They got me in the system
Why they gotta do me like that?
Tried to make it my way
But got sent on up the highway
Why? Oh why
They gotta do me like that?
Why
Oh why
Oh
