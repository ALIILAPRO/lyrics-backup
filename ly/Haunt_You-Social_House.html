		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How do I measure up to heights you've been to?
How could I ever love you like you're meant to?
How could a view of my skies light your temple?
How beautiful the bird outside my window

Always greener on my other side of things
Think so much of you, I can't overthink
Can't take my eyes off you, I don't wanna blink (no, no)

Never thought something so beautiful could
Haunt you, haunt you, haunt you
Better off this way but
I want you, want you, want you
Sometimes I just wanna fucking
Call you, call you, call you
Never thought something beautiful could
Haunt you, haunt you, haunt you

Must be the summer breeze, the smell of orchids
Or its the way you look, I won't forget it
Watching the devils dance outside my doorstep
Some kind of heaven I haven't seen yet

Always greener on my other side of things
Think so much of you, I can't overthink
Can't take my eyes off you, I don't wanna blink (no, no)

Never thought something so beautiful could
Haunt you, haunt you, haunt you
Better off this way but
I want you, want you, want you
Sometimes I just wanna fucking
Call you, call you, call you
Never thought something beautiful could
Haunt you, haunt you, haunt you

Never thought something so beautiful could
(Haunt you, haunt you, haunt you)

Never thought something so beautiful could
Haunt you, haunt you, haunt you
Better off this way but
I want you, want you, want you
Sometimes I just wanna fucking
Call you, call you, call you
Never thought something beautiful could
Haunt you, haunt you, haunt you
