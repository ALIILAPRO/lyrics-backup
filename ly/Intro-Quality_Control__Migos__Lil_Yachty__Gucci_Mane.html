		  Hah
DJ Durel
Burr
Hah
Money

It's all love, I ain't trippin', it's all love (it's all love, hah)
Gave my jeweler an M and told him, "Ice the club" (ice me up, burr, burr)
She keep lookin' for tips, I gave her a cookie nub (here, cookie)
'Cause we lookin' like icebergs, lookin' like glacier thugs (uh, glacier, glacier)

All us got coupes so we racer boys (hoo)
Nut on her face, she gon' taste the boy (ugh)
Youngest in the room (yeah)
Hit a street sweep, no broom (yeah)
Sawed-off pump go, "Boom" (boom)
Old ass nigga thought Lil Boat was a coon
I reserved his daughter for June (June)
Beat that pussy to a tomb (skrrt, skrrt)

Iceberg, ice trays
We the culture, nigga, no tidal, but we the wave (yeah)
White ice, dark shades (yeah)
They think I'm workin' at Krispy Kreme, ice glace
I can get sick with the jewelry, no AIDS
And my hunnids old, just look at the age (yeah)
I get the bag and walk on the stage
Glacier Boyz, just call us new ice age (ruh, ruh, ruh, ruh)

Gucci Mane a plug
If I ain't even know Takeoff, probably think he sellin' drugs
If I ain't even know Quavo, prolly' think he sellin' bud
Offset told me sign Pablo 'cause he got designer drugs
(Fah, fah, fah) Niggas shootin' in the club
Shitted on my new bitch, then I went a bought a rug (fur)
Flip that work with a spatula, with nothin' but a shoulder shrug (Chef Curry)
These bitches on the bachelor, they know them M's up (M&Ms)

Get in there
Know a nigga lookin' like a millionaire
Frigidaire
I had a dream, cookin' dope, I'm a motherfuckin' visionar'
Looky there
Told the bitch to make a million out the kitchen with no underwear
Get 'em out of here
I'ma shoot the hundred round drum 'til the AP get another pair
Get in there
Know a nigga lookin' like a millionaire
Frigidaire
I had a dream, cookin' dope, I'm a motherfuckin' visionar'
Billionaire
I'ma take the rap checks and put it in a brick affair
Give her swimwear, diamonds pink clear
Baguettes all wet like a sink, yeah

My diamonds singin' like Gladys
They gon' shoot out the window, want addy's
We got baddies on baddies on baddies
Walk through the mall, I start up a pep rally
Drippin' too much, I can't put on New Balance
I'm not slippin' or trippin', I'm holdin' my balance (yeah)
Feed your bitch dick, it's organic (yeah)
Kel-Tecs, pussy boy panic (Lil Boat)

I can't go out like Titanic (no)
Ice on my wrist is gigantic (bling)
Bro kept a pot, no ceramics (yeah)
Glacier Boy, check my dynamics (yeah)
Baby girl, settle down
Shoot your boyfriend if he talkin' down (shoot)
Niggas 'round me keep a hunnid round (hah)
(Graow, graow, graow) They gon' air it out
Woo, woo, Lil Boat

And straight like that, man, we the OG Glacier Boyz, man
Seen everybody came straight from Atlanta, you fell me
Zone 6, Nawfside, West Side, whatever you wanna do it
Big cash too, I'm talkin' seventy-five pointers and up
Everythin' real, VVS, VS1, you know what I'm sayin'?
Flawless diamonds and all that
Put them lil' ass diamonds away
I'm sayin' put them fake ass diamonds away
Them enhanced diamonds, put 'em away, know what I'm sayin'?
It's comin' from the youngest in charge, you feel me?
This Lil Boat speakin', all my diamonds real, you feel me?
All my watches cost over fifty, bitch
And stop tellin' me stop buyin' jewelry
'Cause I'ma keep buyin' jewelry
Every time you say stop buyin' jewelry I'ma go buy more jewelry, yeah
I seen your house, that's a nice house, but look at my watch, you feel me?
Look at, look at this ring I just bought
Oh, you just married your girl, I married myself
Check this ring, you feel me
I'm tired of y'all niggas hatin' on me, man, you feel me?
Y'all niggas ain't gettin' no motherfuckin' money, man
And if you is gettin' money, it ain't money to me
That shit ain't money to me
Fuck you talkin' 'bout, man, we them Glacier Boyz
Lil Boat
Yeah, that's our intro, ho
Just like that, man, and we ain't cuttin' out nothin' out
Just like that, you feel me?
That shit was too hard
Keep talkin' 'bout buyin' jewelry, nigga
Ayy, that's a nice house, nigga, but look, look at my watch
You feel me? Talkin' shit
That shit was hard, bro
