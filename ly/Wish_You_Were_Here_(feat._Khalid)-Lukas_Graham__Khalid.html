		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wish you were here
Yeah I, wish you were here
After all this time and all these years
I, wish you were here

Yeah, I've had my share of friends, they come and go
Seems they don't make 'em like they made you anymore
All these places, all these faces, still alone
It only helps to grow, tell you 'bout it when I'm home

'Cause I'm out here without you (yeah I'm out, yeah I'm out here without)
Doing all of the things that we said we'd do
And life don't have a redo
No one else in the world could ever be you
All I'm saying is

I wish you were here
Yeah I, wish you were here
After all this time and all these years
Oh I, wish you were here

Oh I, I wish you were here
Yeah I, wish you were here
After all this time and all these years
Oh I, wish you were here

It could be the way it was
The way it was way back when
Way before crazy began
I got you right here with me
Here in my memories
I know I'm gonna see you again (I'm gonna see you again)

'Cause I'm out here without you (yeah, I'm out, yeah I'm out here without)
Doing all of the things that we said we'd do
And life don't have a redo
No one else in the world could ever be you
All I'm saying is, I

I wish you were here
Yeah I, wish you were here
After all this time and all these years
Oh I, wish you were here

Oh I, I wish you were here
Yeah I, wish you were here
After all this time and all these years (after all these years)
Oh I, wish you were here

After all this time and all these years
I wish you were here
