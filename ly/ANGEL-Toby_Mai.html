		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  LA is the mission
Right now we just hit the road
Girl my lovin is just somethin
That I know you can't control
Look
You could try to defy
To defy some rules
Cause I wanna be wrong girl
Wanna be proved
So hold
Your love
And your truth
Oowowaho
Cause there's no one
Like you
Oowowaho
She moves
Like a damn
Angel
And you can't
Understand
How your gonna let her go
She moves
Like a damn
Angel
And you can't
Understand
How your gonna let her go
LA is the mission right now
We just do these shows
I've been loved up
I've been fucked up girl
I'm better off alone
Look try to find
try to find
try to find some sense of it
But baby you should know
that there's just not an end to this
So hold
Your love
And your truth
Oowowaho
Cause there's no one
Like you
Oowowaho
She moves
Like a damn
Angel
And you can't
Understand
How your gonna let her go
She moves
Like a damn
Angel
And you can't
Understand
How your gonna let her go
