		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can feel it taking over all my senses
Getting slower
And every part of your dead mind is me
But you're gonna be the one too blind to see

I cannot take it
You started taking me in
I cannot take it
You wanna bury me, bury me
I would rip you off like a Band-Aid on my knee
But you hold on tight, you're a part of me

We struggled all the way
And it was still okay
But I lost it when you got into my head
You and me forever
You're like a parasite
But you keep me alive
And I can hear you say
"We're gonna be okay"
I know you're lying but the truth is what I fear
You and me forever
You're like a parasite
I really need you to stay

I can feel it taking over
All my senses getting slower
And all you see is an illusion of truth
It will make you believe you got nothing to lose

You cannot take it
I'm crawling under your skin
You cannot take it
You gotta carry me, carry me
I will make you mine
You can run but you can't hide
And I will push you down
You better give in to me

We struggled all the way
And it was still okay
But I lost it when you got into my head
You and me forever
You're like a parasite
But you keep me alive
And I can hear you say
"We're gonna be okay"
I know you're lying but the truth is what I fear
You and me forever
You're like a parasite
I really need you to stay

I can feel it taking over all my senses
Getting slower
I see you fighting but I'm letting you know
I don't lurk in the dark but
I'm already here with you

I will bot ever say goodbye
'Cause I'm feeding on your
Sadness, your nightmares, your dirty little soul
Your pain is my pleasure
You feel me everywhere you go

There's no way to hide
I will find you
And every time that you think I'm not with you
I will push you into deep
You are dead but alive

We struggled all the way
And it was still okay
But I lost it when you got into my head
You and me forever
You're like a parasite
But you keep me alive
And I can hear you say
"We're gonna be okay"
I know you're lying but the truth is what I fear
You and me forever
You're like a parasite
I really need you to stay
