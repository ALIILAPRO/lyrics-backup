		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Will the kids in the back deny it?!
Will the kids in the back deny it?!
Their heads are all empty, our hearts in flat lines...
Will the kids in the back deny it?!
Will the kids in the back deny it?!
And blurred all the lines when I'm lying through my teeth!
When I'm backing up, can't let you go!
Wait up girl you know that I cannot turn away!!!
Will the kids in the back deny it?!
Will the kids in the back deny it?!
Their heads were all empty, our hearts in flat lines...
Will the kids in the back deny it?!
Will the kids in the back deny it?!
And make up our minds when you know we're lost...
When I'm backing up, can't let you go!
Wait up girl you know that I cannot turn away!!!
Watch your mouth when you're talking back!
With broken heart that you never could fix!
When my broken home is about to fall out...
Then that's how I know...
Make the same mistakes that you once were made of,
Our brains are empty, our hearts are so empty you know, that we can't go away...
Wait for this one,
Wait for this to pass,
Wait one more fucking day!
When I'm gone, you'll always remember, the ignored affection,
With your back to the back of all that's safe!!
You know, we ran, we fell, rebuild what we had!
