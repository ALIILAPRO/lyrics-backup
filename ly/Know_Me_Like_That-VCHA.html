		  Hey (ha, ha)
Hey (ha, ha)

You got me wrong
Thinking I'm not gonna bite
When all along
I don't think you worth the fight
Say what you want
But now it's my time to talk
Oh, my, my, you're making me scream (ow)

I know I'm a superstar, ain't saying it twice
You think that I'm stupid, I got stars in my eyes
If you cross the line then I ain't playing it nice
I walk the walk, I talk the talk
Don't need to hear 'bout what ya want
I'm quiet, but I came to rock (ah)

You think that you know me, but
No, you don't know me like that
I don't care 'bout what you heard
No, you don't know me like that
Talking shh like I'm a nerd
No, you don't know me like that
No, you don't know me like that
No, you don't know me like that

Sit down and watch
While I am making a scene
Look what I got
Something that you couldn't dream
'Bout to get hot
Oh, God, you better believe
Oh, my, my, you're making me sing (ow)

I know I'm a superstar, ain't saying it twice
You think that I'm stupid, I got stars in my eyes
If you cross the line, then I ain't playing it nice
I walk the walk, I talk the talk
Don't need to hear 'bout what ya want
I'm quiet but I came to rock (ah)

Why you wanna stop and stare?
No, you don't know me like that
Making fun of what I wear
No, you don't know me like that
Why you tryna even care?
No, you don't know me like that
No, you don't know me like that
No, you don't know me like that

I can tell you things that you never knew before
Do you wanna know the score? Got the pedal to the floor
I can tell you this, I be laying down the law
I be kicking down doors 'til ya say no more
So get off of my back, you don't know me like that
Better listen up, I'ma make a fuss
Yeah, the time is up, leave you in the dust

You think that you know me, but
No, you don't know me like that
I don't care 'bout what you heard
No, you don't know me like that
Talking shh like I'm a nerd
No, you don't know me like that
No, you don't know me like that
No, you don't know me like that

Why you wanna stop and stare?
No, you don't know me like that
Making fun of what I wear
No, you don't know me like that
Why you tryna even care?
No, you don't know me like that
No, you don't know me like that
No, you don't know me like that

No, you don't know me like that
