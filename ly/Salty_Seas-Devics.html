		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm not saying that i felt like you cared
I'm not saying that i want to go back

The salty seas behind the eye
And it's the tears that come and make me cry
The falling leaf that never tries
To hold on to what keeps it alive

I was so green nothing could touch me
I'm not saying that this is good or bad
I'm not saying that I want to go

The salty seas behind the eye
And it's the tears that come and make me cry
The falling leaf that never tries
To hold on to what keeps it alive

The summer dream behind the eye
And it's the sleep that makes me alive
The sudden ease when you arrive
And it's you that makes me try
