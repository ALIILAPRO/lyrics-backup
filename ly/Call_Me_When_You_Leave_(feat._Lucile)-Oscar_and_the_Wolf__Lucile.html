		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I just didn’t know how to change who I was misunderstood 
but can  I stay the night? 
got stuck on your heart, and I’ll follow your lead 

You don’t see I’ve changed and I misunderstood 
could bear that I was stuck on you 
I got stuck on your heart, and I’ll follow your lead 

So call me when you leave 
Call me when you leave 
So call me when you leave 
Call me when you leave

And i was wrong to always ask you to stay 
And how i forced you to behave 
I know you love her but can I see you again? 
So you leave me standing here when you knock on your door 
Now i’m fucked up and I just called you like I called you before 

I just wanna see you again 
I just wanna see you again
I just wanna see you again 

So call me when you leave 
Call me when you leave 
So call me when you leave 
Call me when you leave

I just didn’t know how to change who I was misunderstood 
but can  I stay the night? 
got stuck on your heart, and I’ll follow your lead 

So call me when you leave 
Call me when you leave 
So call me when you leave 
Call me when you leave
