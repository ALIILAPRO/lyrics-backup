		  BBB-BB-Boom
BBB-BB-Boom (boom)
BBB-BB-Boom
BBB-BB-Boom (boom)
BBB-BB-Boom

In a world full of heartache
Seems like everyone's burning out
You and me, we did it our way
And this love ain't running out
We got that fire, that glow (oh)
And I just need you to know

You're my favorite song, my sing along
You shine bright like lighters in the dark
And you're my clarity, the best part of me
You still make my crazy little heart go boom
BBB-BB-Boom (boom)
BBB-BB-Boom (boom)
BBB-BB-Boom
You still make my crazy little heart go boom

Don't worry 'bout tomorrow
'Cause these walls will never fall
I just wanna let the world know
What we got's unbreakable
We got it under control (oh)
We're good, we're solid, we're gold

You're my favorite song, my sing along
You shine bright like lighters in the dark
And you're my clarity, the best part of me
You still make my crazy little heart go boom
BBB-BB-Boom (boom)
BBB-BB-Boom (boom)
BBB-BB-Boom
You still make my crazy little heart go boom

You make my crazy little heart go
And now I never wanna let go (crazy little heart go)
(Crazy little heart go, crazy little heart go) ayy
You make my crazy little heart go (crazy little heart go, crazy little heart go)
And now I never, I never, I never want to let go 

(Boom)
BBB-BB-Boom (boom)
BBB-BB-Boom (boom)

You're my favorite song, my sing along
You shine bright like lighters in the dark
And you're my clarity, the best part of me
You still make my crazy little heart go boom
You're my favorite song, my sing along
You shine bright like lighters in the dark
And you're my clarity, the best part of me
You still make my crazy little heart go boom
BBB-BB-Boom (boom)
BBB-BB-Boom (boom)
BBB-BB-Boom
You still make my crazy little heart go boom
