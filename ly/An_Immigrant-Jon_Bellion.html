		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Is this the American? Is this the American?
Is this the American? Is this the Ameâ€“

Woke up in London with you next to me
Made love in Brixton with both
Hands around your neck
I'm back in New York on British ecstasy
So I feel like an immigrant in America
Yes, I am just an immigrant in America

Cigar and cigarette ashes
As I open all my luggage up
I still speak my native language
But I only want your foreign tongue

Remember? Remember?
When you spilled coffee on my J
Coffee on my J Dilla vinyl
I didn't even mind, didn't even mind (crazy)
When you spilled coffee on my J
Coffee on my J Dilla vinyl
I didn't even mind, didn't even mind (baby)

Woke up in London with you next to me
Made love in Brixton with both
Hands around your neck
I'm back in New York on British ecstasy
So, I feel like an immigrant in America
Yes, I am just an immigrant in America

South London, born in Colombia
Texts in Spanish that she's all alone
She said she's found an apartment
I'm in Harlem, screaming, "take me home"

Remember? Remember?
When you spilled coffee on my J
Coffee on my J Dilla vinyl
I didn't even mind, didn't even mind (crazy)
When you spilled coffee on my J
Coffee on my J Dilla vinyl
I didn't even mind, didn't even mind (baby)

Woke up in London with you next to me
Made love in Brixton with both
Hands around your neck
I'm back in New York on British ecstasy
So, I feel like an immigrant in America
I miss you
Yes, I feel like an immigrant in America
That's how I feel
