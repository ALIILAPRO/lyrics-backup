		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Your eyes, your eyes tell me everything.
The first, the last and in between, that's everything.
Your kiss, your kiss so wet I loose my breath, your lips erase the old regrets, of anything.

You're not just a girl, you're more like the air and sea.
I want you so desperately and nothing's gonna keep us apart.

Your voice, its whispering against my neck,
Your lips, erase the old regrets of anything.
Your mind, it makes me wanna know you more,
So tell me what we have in store, tell me everything.

You can say anything, and you can say anything, and you can say anything to me.
