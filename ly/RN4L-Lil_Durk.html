		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, man, it's Mad, man, live from the trenches, man
Happenin' with my boy Durkio, man
He the soul of the streets, man, I'm the voice of the streets, man
I'll be back out there going crazy
Bro was there when nobody wasn't there, man
You know, payin' lawyer fees, you know, sending bread, whatever, on bro
Holding a motherfucker down, man, doing his thing for me
All you fu' ass niggas out there snaked out, man, on some fake shit, man
Remember all the real niggas
Showed love, man, stayed down, shout out to real niggas, man
Y'all know I'm on my OTF shit, man, on go

They told me don't die young because I'm talented
You really for me, you been around and you ain't asked for shit
Voice of the streets, and if I say it, Vern, he stand on it
I speak my soul through my music, I'm so passionate
And if you thinkin' 'bout taking my chain, just know you would die with it
When them niggas count your pockets, you gotta watch that shit
I ain't have a pot to piss in, you did
You say this brother shit fell off, it did (turn up)

I'm the brains and you the muscle, that's Rodney still
And niggas really speak they mind off them Perky pills
They left me hanging and left me abandoned, that shit hurt me still
We fell off and it was a shootout, and I think they'll murk me still
In the studio smoking exotic, comin' up with new bars
I tried to stop it, I tried to stop it, that shit too far
Been around with my brothers, you give me endurance, I ride with two Glocks
And I'm thinking 'bout getting insurance, tryna do me like 2Pac
Ooh, it hurt my soul
Who gon' ride with you 'til the end?
Then again, you gotta watch out for your friends
They disrespect me on the 'net, don't pay it no 'ttention

They told me don't die young because I'm talented
You really for me, you been around and you ain't asked for shit
Voice of the streets, and if I say it, Vern, he stand on it
I speak my soul through my music, I'm so passionate
And if you thinkin' 'bout taking my chain, just know you would die with it
When them niggas count your pockets, you gotta watch that shit
I ain't have a pot to piss in, you did
You say this brother shit fell off, it did (turn up)

Gotta be a snake to hang around you snakes
Boona gon' be straight, you know that's my lil' ace
If you play with my name, the streets gon' give you a taste
Just signed my deal with Bel-Air, fuck around and give you a case
Niggas low-key Chuck E. Cheese, tryna give you a case
A lot of pussies in these streets and I'll never embrace
You talking like you an OG and you can't get replaced
They wanna see your face in the casket, I told 'em leave your face
And I be thinkin' about my dawg until them Runtz gone
Until a nigga shoot that dome, it won't be much long
It's not a letter to the streets, it's just a love song
Lost Baby D to these streets, can't believe my cuz gone

They told me don't die young because I'm talented
You really for me, you been around and you ain't asked for shit
Voice of the streets, and if I say it, Vern, he stand on it
I speak my soul through my music, I'm so passionate
And if you thinkin' 'bout taking my chain, just know you would die with it
When them niggas count your pockets, you gotta watch that shit
I ain't have a pot to piss in, you did
You say this brother shit fell off, it did (turn up)

(Let's get it)
(DJ on the beat, so it's a banger)
