		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A change will do you good
I always knew it would
Sometimes I'm thinking that I love you
But I know it's only lust
Your kiss so sweet
Your sweat so sour

Your kiss so sweet
Your sweat so, so, so
Your kiss so sweet
Your sweat so sour

Sometimes I'm thinking that I love you
But I know it's only lust
The sins of flesh
Are simply sins of lust

Sweat's running down your neck
Sweat's running down your back
Heated something's in the sun 
(Or is that untrue?)
Colder something's in the night 
(Never saw your body)

Your kiss so sweet
Your sweat so sour
Sometimes I'm thinking that I love you
But I know it's only lust
A change will do you good
I always knew it would
You know the change will do you good
You know the change will do you good

Damaged goods
Send them back
I can't work, I can't achieve 
Send them back
Open the till
Give me the change you said would do me good
You said you're cheap

Your kiss so sweet
Your sweat so sour
Sometimes I'm thinking that I love you
But I know it's only lust
The change will do you good
I always knew it would
You know the change will do you good
You know the change will do you good

(Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye)
Hey
(Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye)
Bye
(Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye)
Hey
(Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye)
Bye
