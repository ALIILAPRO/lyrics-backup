		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A cold heart could see through your bullshit
Like Chrome Heart, you cross me like you don't care
I get lost to pass felt emotions
I get lost for you

And I ain't calling you a liar
Not one thing you told me was true, not one thing
I let my desire get the best of me because of you, because of you
Yeah, you told me that you love me, but you don't care at all
Yeah, you fuck me, then you leave me, and you don't even call
'Cause you're a liar
Not one thing you told me was true, not one thing

Now I'm looking at the time spent
Feeling stupid, guess I don't know what a sign is
And we could have saved it but instead it end up dyin'
I don't wanna blame you but you left me here in silence
Right person, wrong time, and
It's there, another feeling, still there
'Cause it did, I know you haven't let me go
That and more, then you show
I know you're sad, but this is what you want

A cold heart could see through your bullshit
Like Chrome Heart, you cross me like you don't care
I get lost to pass felt emotions
I get lost for you

And I ain't calling you a liar
Not one thing you told me was true, not one thing
I let my desire get the best of me because of you, because of you
Yeah, you told me that you love me, but you don't care at all
Yeah, you fuck me, then you leave me, and you don't even call
'Cause you're a liar
Not one thing you told me was true, not one thing
