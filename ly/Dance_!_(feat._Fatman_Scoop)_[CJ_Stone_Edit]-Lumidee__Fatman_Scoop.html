		  Come on and dance! (oh, oh)
Come on and dance! (oh, oh)
Fatman Scoop, Lumidee let's go now! Dance

Oh I wanna dance with somebody (Let's go, Let's go!)
And I wanna feel the heat with somebody (Everybody now dance!)
Yeah I wanna dance with somebody (Hands up! Hands up!)
With somebody who loves me (Come on and dance!)
Oh I wanna dance with somebody (Let's go, Let's go!)
And I wanna feel the heat with somebody (Everybody now dance!)
Yeah I wanna dance with somebody (Come on and dance!)
With somebody who loves me (oh, come on!)

Listen
Excuse me as I'm comin' through
This Harlem chick wanna know what's good with you
And I don't really need to know your name
Just wanna dance, wanna go insane
Wild out the night, ain't no one to blame
Come back tomorrow and straight do the same
But you're the hottest thing here tonight
Heatin' up the spot and you know that's right
Got me in the zone, whole movement tight
Tear up the club 'till the mornin' light like, dance!

Oh I wanna dance with somebody (Come on and dance!)
And I wanna feel the heat with somebody (Everybody now dance!)
Yeah I wanna dance with somebody (Come on and dance!)
With somebody who loves me (Hand up, Hands up!)
Oh I wanna dance with somebody (Come on and dance!)
And I wanna feel the heat with somebody (Let's go! Let's go!)
Yeah I wanna dance with somebody (Come on and dance!)
With somebody who loves me (Stand up! Let's go!)

As the night is flowin', got me goin'
I'm the main attraction growin'
Gotta feel it all in your system
When you hear the drums and the banger rhythm
Bet you gon' miss me, and won't forget me
Straight rock the spot like you just let me
Huh, I'm a little too much myself
Still into it dancing, screaming I yell out

Dance! (oh, oh, oh)
Come on and dance! (oh, oh, oh)
Come on and dance!

Oh I wanna dance with somebody (Come on and dance!)
And I wanna feel the heat with somebody (Everybody now dance!)
Yeah I wanna dance with somebody (Come on and dance!)
With somebody who loves me (Hands up, Hands up!)
Oh I wanna dance with somebody (Come on and dance!)
And I wanna feel the heat with somebody (Let's go! Let's go!)
Yeah I wanna dance with somebody (Come on and dance!)
With somebody who loves me

Fatman Scoop from the top let's go now!

Stand up! (hey!) Hands up! (hey!) Stand up! (hey!) Hands up! (what?) Lumidee
Stand up! (hey!) Hands up! (hey!) Stand up! (hey!) Hands up! (what?) Dance
Ladies! (hey!) Fellas! (hey!) Ladies! (hey!) Fellas!
Ladies! (hey!) Fellas! (hey!) Ladies! (hey!) Fellas! (hey!)

Oh I wanna dance with somebody (Come on and dance!)
And I wanna feel the heat with somebody (Dance!)
Yeah I wanna dance with somebody (Come on and dance!)
With somebody who loves me (Fatman Scoop moving in let's go now!)
Oh I wanna dance with somebody (Come on and dance!)
And I wanna feel the heat with somebody (Everybody now dance!)
Yeah I wanna dance with somebody (Come on and dance!)
With somebody who loves me
