		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Speak for yourself
I can't see your face with
Your blood in my eyes it's dark in my brain
I can't find my way out
You've turned down the lights
I will await, your illusions
As you fill up all the spaces
Inside of my empty lungs

Like a ritual
I've got you inside of my soul
You're the cracks in my hollow bones
You're the ache in the back of my throat
Like a ritual
Think of you every time I choke
Though I've tried, I still can't let you go
Like a ritual like a ritual

I don't wanna stay
When you say my name I feel haunted inside
I'll keep you safe
You can't run away 'cause
There's nowhere to hide
I will await your illusions
As you fill up all the spaces
Inside of my empty lungs

Like a ritual
I've got you inside of my soul
You're the cracks in my hollow bones
You're the ache in the back of my throat
Like a ritual
Think of you every time I choke
Though I've tried, I still can't let you go
Like a ritual like a ritual

Like a ritual
I've got you inside of my soul
You're the cracks in my hollow bones
You're the ache in the back of my throat
Like a ritual
Think of you every time I choke
Though I've tried, I still can't let you go
Like a ritual like a ritual
