		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I just got to forget you
That's one thing I've got to do
Oh, and I know
That you don't like me half as much
As I love you
I just gotta leave you
And start all over anew
Oh, one day, I'll find
Someone down the line
To help me forget the thought of you

Oh, it won't be easy
To get you off of my mind
Lord, one day, you'll be
Just a faded memory
It's just that bad, a hard time
I just gotta leave you, darling
I've just gotta put you down
Oh, oh, I know you're no good for me, darling
I just gotta, I just gotta put you down
