		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm a cheap trick kinda girl I'll fool you any day, 
I'm a cheap trick kinda girl ain't no other way,
I can keep up, play the game, ain't no need to stop,
I'm a cheap trick kinda girl, might just well give up.
I'm a cheap trick kinda girl I'll fool you any day, 
I'm a cheap trick kinda girl ain't no other way,
I can keep up, play the game, ain't no need to stop,
I'm a cheap trick kinda girl, might just well give up.

She knows, he's never gonna loose,
And she knows she's never gonna win,
Everybody's playing, knowing it's a sin,
She's a cheap trick kinda girl,
And oh' yeah, you'll bet your ass,
She knows it's a sin.

I'm a cheap trick kinda girl I'll fool you any day, 
I'm a cheap trick kinda girl ain't no other way,
I can keep up, play the game, ain't no need to stop,
I'm a cheap trick kinda girl, might just well give up.

Never gonna loose, and never gonna win,
Everybody's playing, (knowing it's a sin)
Never gonna loose, and never gonna win,
Everybody's playing, knowing it's a sin.

Never gonna loose, and never gonna win,
Everybody's playing, (knowing it's a sin)
Never gonna loose, and never gonna win,
Everybody's playing, knowing it's a sin.

I'm a cheap, trick, kinda girl.

I'm a cheap trick kinda girl ill fool you any day, 
I'm a cheap trick kinda girl ain't no other way,
I can keep up, play the game, ain't no need to stop,
I'm a cheap trick kinda girl, might just well give up.

Never gonna loose, and never gonna win,
Everybody's playing, (knowing it's a sin)
Never gonna loose, and never gonna win,
Everybody's playing, knowing it's a sin.

I'm a cheap, trick, kinda girl.
