		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh don't you dare look back
Just keep your eyes on me
I said your holding back
She said shut up and dance with me
This girl she's my destiny
She said oh oh oh
Shut up and dance with me

We were victims of the night
The quizzical, mystical, kryptonite
That helped us through the phase and the fading light
Oh we were bound to get together
Bound to get together

She took my arm
I don't know how it happened
We took the floor and she said

Oh don't you dare look back
Just keep your eyes on me
I said your holding back
She said shut up and dance with me
This girl she is my destiny
She said oh oh oh
Shut up and dance with me

A brand new dress and some beat up sneaks
My discotheque Juliet teenage dream
I felt it in my chest as she looked at me
I knew we were bound to be together
Bound to be together

She took my arm
I don't know how it happened
We took the floor and she said

Oh don't you dare look back
Just keep your eyes on me
I said your holding back
She said shut up and dance with me
This girl she is my destiny
She said oh oh oh
Shut up and dance with me (oh, come on girl)

Deep in her eyes
I think I see the future
I realize this is my last chance

She took my arm
I don't know how it happened
We took the floor and she said

Oh don't you dare look back
Just keep your eyes on me
I said your holding back
She said shut up and dance with me
This girl she is my destiny
She said oh oh oh
Shut up and dance, dance

Oh don't you dare look back
Just keep your eyes on me
I said your holding back
She said shut up and dance with me
This girl she is my destiny
She said oh oh oh
Shut up and dance with me

Oh oh oh shut up dance with me
Oh oh oh shut up dance with me
