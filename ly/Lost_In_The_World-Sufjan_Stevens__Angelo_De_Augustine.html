		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A voice of airs' mellifluence
Draconian will, superstition
Now go arise, awake your dead
An angel fell, one heaven sent
The Beaufort scale measured the gales
I saw the world between two sails
The water climbed over the sky
As miracles demystify
All that was lost in the world

Yeah, I've been lost in the world
How do we all make it through?
Caught in thought, daydreaming like I do
Just like you, when you told me all your dreams would come true
Well I hope you're right, and they always do

An optical indifference parallel realms of existence
Cosmologies, apocalypse, your premonition's persistence
For all that was lost in the world

Yeah, I've been lost in the world
How will we all make it through?
Caught in thoughts, daydreaming like I do
Just like you, when you told me all your dreams would come true
Well I hope you're right, and they always do
