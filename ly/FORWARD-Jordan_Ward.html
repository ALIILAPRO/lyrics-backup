		  Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

I touch the sun, I feel renewed, it's lookin' gorgeous
I shed a tear for the first time in years this mornin'
I wasn't ready for everythin' I wanted
Guess all mine and my family's prayers wasn't for nothin', no
We came from next to nothin', oh
Hate the way them drugs took my cousin, oh
Hate the way them drugs took my bro (oh)
Last time we talked, he called from behind bars (yeah)

He would probably say, "Boy, you took that shit far"
I would probably say, "Didn't you know I was just one call away?"
So I'ma do this for y'all
Gotta do this for y'all, I do this for y'all
When it gets dark, no, I ain't forgot
('Cause I do this for y'all)
('Cause I do this for y'all)

We was good kids, didn't always make the best decisions
Our folks did they're best with what they was gettin'
Damn near killed themselves just to make a livin'
I can't let 'em die tryna make a livin'
Know we'd get somewhere if we get past our differences
This shit way bigger than me and how I'm feelin' or imperfections
I turned my dream to a day job
But that was the same year all my friends and fam got laid off
Now I'm always isolated, wonder if I strayed off
But when I was at my lowest, man, that's where I found God

I was probably saying', "Damn, how'd I stray so far?"
She would probably say, "Don't you know I'm just one call away?"
(Do this for y'all)
I still do this for y'all
Gotta do this for y'all, I do this for y'all
When it gets dark, no, I ain't forgot

Yeah
Gotta do this for y'all (yeah), I do this for y'all (yeah)
When it gets dark (let's go), no, I ain't forgot (let's go)
