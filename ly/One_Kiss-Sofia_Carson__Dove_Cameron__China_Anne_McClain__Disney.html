		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't freak out, it's okay
'Cause true love can save the day
And I think we feel the same
But I don't know
When we met, it was sweet
He was oh so into me
Seems like things are meant to be
But I don't know

Does he love me? Or does he love me not?
Do I love him? And is it strong enough?

One kiss, one kiss
It all comes down to this
One kiss, one kiss
Ooh
One kiss, one kiss
This moment could be it
I, I, I wanna know
So here I go (go)

Keep it cool, keep it calm
Think he's loved me all along
But maybe I got it wrong
So I don't know (hey)
He's so good, got my back
But maybe I'm just too bad
Could we be a perfect match?
Now, I don't know

Does he love me? Or does he love me not?
Do I love him? And is it strong enough? Ooh-ooh-ooh

One kiss, one kiss
It all comes down to this
One kiss, one kiss
Ooh
One kiss, one kiss
This moment could be it
I, I, I wanna know
So here I go (go)
Yeah, here I go

I feel my heartbeat beating saying, "It's gonna work"
But if I'm dream-dream-dreaming, this is gonna hurt
Either I will or I won't
What if I do and he don't?
Is he my Romeo?
Oh, there's only one, one way to really know

Ayy
Ayy

Hey, one kiss, one kiss
It all comes down to this (one kiss)
One kiss, one kiss (one kiss)
Ooh
One kiss, one kiss
This moment could be it
I, I, I wanna know (I wanna know)
So here I go (go)

Here I go
Here I go (here I go, here I go)
Here I go
