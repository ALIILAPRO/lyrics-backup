		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ninety miles outside Chicago
Can't stop driving
I don't know why
So many questions
I need an answer
Two years later he's still on my mind

What ever happened to Amelia Earhart?
Who holds the stars up in the sky?
Is true love just once in a lifetime?
Did the captain of the Titanic cry?
Oh

Someday we'll know
If love can move a mountain
Someday we'll know
Why the sky is blue
Someday we'll know
Why I wasn't meant for you

Does anybody know the way to Atlantis?
Or what the wind says when she cries?
I'm speeding by the place that I met you
For the ninety-seventh time tonight

Someday we'll know
If love can move a mountain
Someday we'll know
Why the sky is blue
Someday we'll know
Why I wasn't meant for you 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Someday we'll know
Why Sampson loved Delilah
One day I'll go
Dancing on the moon
Someday you'll know
That I was the one for you (ow)

I bought a ticket to the end of the rainbow
I watched the stars crash in the sea
If I could ask God just one question
Why aren't you here with me
Tonight

Someday we'll know
If love can move a mountain
Someday we'll know
Why the sky is blue
Someday we'll know
Why I wasn't meant for you 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Someday we'll know
Why Sampson loved Delilah
One day I'll go 
Dancing on the moon
Someday you'll know
That I was the one for you
