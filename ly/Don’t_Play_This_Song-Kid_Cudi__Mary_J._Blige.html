		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wanna know what this sound like when I'm not on drugs?
Please please don't play this song r-r-r-r-right r-right r-right right right
Trynna get my mind m-mind m-mind right right
People think they're really being helpful by telling me please be careful
Yeah right r-r-r-r-right r-right r-right right right please don't play this song

Pain, hurt, sadness and loneliness
Bought all that shit right up
Tossed away to the bottomless pit
Of the part of my mind that slips
The part of my mind so sick
I don't even like to take that trip
Unless I'm sloppy drunk I pray for my mom,
I teach her the son that never gave a fuck about a scantron
All I wanted was to be a human being
And show the world some new colors and scene
Imagine all types of beautiful scenery
I remember when I first had tree smoked
Black and Mild, how dumb of me now,
I'm grape cigarello man
Any young black kid a guaranteed fan
On a downhill grind and I'm humble
And I treat normal girls like models
Reckless and young, am I my mom's calling,
Thank god she hit decline
I'm numb faced while I'm thinking about suicide

Wanna know what this sound like when I'm not on drugs?
Please please don't play this song r-r-r-r-right r-right r-right right right
Trynna get my mind m-mind m-mind right right
People think they're really being helpful by telling me please be careful
Yeah right r-r-r-r-right r-right r-right right right please don't play this song

Hey, black Robin Hood ridin high,
Just like we should you know the saying,
Ain't no delaying
Gotta gets the gettin' while the gettin's good
Yeah demented, my brain was forced to transform wise up,
I'm checkin' the gate on humble tales
And minimum wage the girls tell it, Cudi's lame
Wearing a kilt, he must be gay
Let's keep it chill, fuck being discrete
But some girls tweet how they miss my meat ya,
Cudders, HBO, that Vitamin Water
That's money to blow cause your money for blow
Don't take no shit you can blame my Ma I'm in the maze,
I'm in a daze, I'm losing it
I'm locking in my rocket ship I be a blip in your radar bitch
It feels like things can be covered
Until the day I'm above myself hover

Wanna know what this sound like when I'm not on drugs?
Please please don't play this song r-r-r-r-right r-right r-right right right
Trynna get my mind m-mind m-mind right right
People think they're really being helpful by telling me please be careful
Yeah right r-r-r-r-right r-right r-right right right please don't play this song
