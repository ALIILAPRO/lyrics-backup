		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wish that I could say
I’m not dancing on your grave
But thinking about the shit you put me through
To hell with you

So long and goodnight
Traded darkness for the light
Cuz everything I had I gave to you
I wanted to you

Rest in fucking peace all my issues
I’d be lying if I had to say I miss you
When I’m with you I feel numb
I still taste you on my tongue
But now I tell myself I had enough

Rest in fucking peace all my problems
Cuz reaching for the bottle couldn’t solve them
If the damage has been done
I’ll can’t be the only one
I just tell myself I’ve had enough

Bittersweet relief, without you next to me
Funny how it all just disappears
When you’re not hear
Faking self-control like everyone I know
Funny how they all just sing along your siren song

Rest in fucking peace all my issues
I’d be lying if I had to say I miss you
When I’m with you I feel numb
I still taste you on my tongue
But now I tell myself I had enough

Rest in fucking peace all my problems
Cuz reaching for the bottle couldn’t solve them
If the damage has been done
I’ll can’t be the only one
I just tell myself I’ve had enough

Since you went away
I haven’t needed saving
They say I’m being brave
Cuz I’m good without you lately

Since you went away
I haven’t needed saving
They say I’m being brave
Cuz I’m good without you lately

Rest in fucking peace all my issues
I’d be lying if I had to say I miss you
When I’m with you I feel numb
I still taste you on my tongue
But now I tell myself I had enough

Rest in fucking peace all my problems
Cuz reaching for the bottle couldn’t solve them
If the damage has been done
I’ll can’t be the only one
I just tell myself I’ve had enough
