		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How do you find somebody to love you
If love is a lie?
Keep on looking all around for someone
Not to pass you by

There's a hole inside your chest
And it keeps growing if you stare inside
But when you try to look away
You only see the love that you can't find

We're the last of our kind
Lost in our time
Broken inside 
But not alone
Last of our kind
And we're frozen in time
Loving inside
You're not alone.
