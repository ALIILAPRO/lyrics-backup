		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lonely hours, Lonely days, 
Never meant to drive you away from me, 
I shoulda listened to ya lady and what you had to say, if only
I never knew how much you feel for somebody after you've let them go (let them go) 
And you find out that it's too late to let your feelings show (feelings show) 
And even though I've done you so wrong 
Don't you know, like I know, baby

You see you've got the key to my heart, girl 
Unlock me and take all my feelings apart 
Cause when you said you had to leave, had to go away, 
You closed the door on me; you threw away the key

I'm starting over, I'm feeling down, 
Still can't believe that you're not around. 
I shoulda been there for you, baby
But now I'm crying on this melody tonight

I didn't realize that there is no other remedy to end this pain (end this pain) 
But if you come back in my life then maybe I can start to live again (live again) 
And even though you're being so strong 
Don't you know, like I know, baby

You see you've got the key to my heart, key to my heart girl 
Unlock me and take all my feelings apart 
Cause when you said you had to leave, had to go away, 
You closed the door on me; you threw away the key

And everyday and night I'm thinking about you constantly 
Now I know for sure how much you really mean to me, yeah 
Sometimes I get a rush and I see, how we were meant to be, lady

You see you've got the key to my heart, key to my heart girl 
Unlock me and take all my feelings apart 
Cause when you said you had to leave, had to go away, 
You closed the door on me; you threw away the key
