		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I just want you to
Relax
Ease into it

Baby slow down, just take your time
You and me goin' be here for a while
Okay
Baby don't rush this, take your time
You and me goin' be here for a while
Okay
I got so much that I want to do
I just wanna be close to you
Okay
I got so much that I want to do
But I can show you better than I can say

Don't want to be no where but here
No where in this atmosphere
Stratosphere, ionosphere
Ain't no sphere that's bright like here
Don't want to be no where but here
No where in this atmosphere
I'm good where I am

Baby slow down, take your time
You and me goin' be here for a while
Okay, hey
I got so much that I want to do
But I can show you better than I can say

Let me show you 
Let me show you 
Let me show you 
Let me show you 
Let me show you 
I wanna show you
Let me show you
Let me show you
Let me show 

Oh baby, you make me feel so good
Come let me take you by the hand
Oh baby, you make me feel so good
Let me show you how
Let me show you out
Let me show you now
Let me show with out
Let me show you how
I wanna show ya how
Let me show ya, let me show ya, let me show ya, let me show ya
Move ya shoulders
Oh

Baby slow down just take your time
You and me gon' be here for a while
Okay, hey
I got so much that I want to do
But I can show you better than I can say

Enough talk and let's move, ah
Come on, come on, come on, come on, oh
Come on, come on, come on, come on, oh oh
Come on, come on, come on, come on, oh
Oh baby
