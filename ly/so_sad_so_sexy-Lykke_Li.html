		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Open your eyes
I'm right in front of you
Open your eyes
Open your eyes
I'm walking out on you for the last time

I keep my heart achin'
Why do we keep fakin'?

I was only lyin' when I looked in your eyes
I'm cryin' diamonds like a river inside
And it's so sad, so sexy
So sad, so sexy
I was only lyin' when I looked in your eyes
Now I'm lyin' with you one last time
And it's so sad, so sexy
So sad, so sexy

Don't turn around
I'm not the one for you
Don't turn around

I keep my heart achin', why?
Don't have the guts to break it

I was only lyin' when I looked in your eyes
I'm cryin' diamonds like a river inside
And it's so sad, so sexy
So sad, so sexy
I was only lyin' when I looked in your eyes
Now I'm lyin' with you one last time
And it's so sad, so sexy
So sad, so sexy

So sad, so sexy
So sad, so sexy
So sad, so sexy

All the words are so-o-o-o-o-o (so-o-o-o-o-o)
So I dance, but I don't feel it

Darlin', I was only lyin' when I looked in your eyes
I'm cryin' diamonds like a river inside
And it's so sad, so sexy
So sad, so sexy
I was only lyin' when I looked in your eyes
Now I'm lyin' with you one last time
And it's so sad, so sexy
So sad, so sexy

So sad, so sexy
So sad, so sexy
So sad, so sexy
