		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Headed for the station with a pack on my back
I'm tired of transportation in the back of a hack
I love to hear the rhythm of the clickety clack

And hear the lonesome whistle, see the smoke from the stack
I pal around with democratic fellas named Mac
So take me right back to the track, Jack

Choo choo, choo choo ch'boogie
Whoo whoo, whoo whoo ch'boogie
Choo choo, choo choo ch'boogie
Take me right back to the track, Jack

We reach the destination but alas and alack
We need some conversation to get back in the black
You take a mornin' paper from the top of the stack

And read the situations from the front to the back
The only job that's open needs a man with a knack
So put it right back in the rack, Jack

Choo choo, choo choo ch'boogie
Whoo whoo, whoo whoo ch'boogie
Choo choo, choo choo ch'boogie
Take me right back to the track, Jack

I'm gonna settle down by the railroad track
And live the life of Riley in a beaten down shack
So when I hear the whistle I can peek through the crack

Watch the train rollin' when it's ballin' the jack
For I just learned the rhythm of the clickety clack
So take me right back to the track, Jack

Choo choo, choo choo ch'boogie
Whoo whoo, whoo whoo ch'boogie
Choo choo, choo choo ch'boogie
Take me right back to the track, Jack

Alright Jack, whoo whoo, oi

Choo choo, choo choo ch'boogie
Whoo whoo, whoo whoo ch'boogie
Choo choo, choo choo ch'boogie
Take me right back to the track, Jack

Choo choo, choo choo ch'boogie
Whoo whoo, whoo whoo ch'boogie
Choo choo, choo choo ch'boogie
Take me right back to the track
