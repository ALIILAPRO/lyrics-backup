		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You cut your hair short, I still love it
Does it look good from the back, now doe
s it
Do what I say, my puppet
Earthquake when I’m standing above it
Here is the church and here is the steeple
Open it up and see all of the evil
Forgive me father, I did something illegal
Didn’t feel like a sin
It’s not my fault, it’s accidental
Starting to feel experimental
Don’t be so shy, boy don’t be gentle
Da da da da da da da da
He thinks I’m the devil (Aw!)
Think I’ll take him down with me
Six feet, yeah I know he wanna kiss me
Devil (Aw!)
God is playing favorites
Backseat, yeah he just go
tta face it
Father, Son, Holy Ghost
I’m the one she loves the most
Father, Son, Holy Ghost
I’m the one she loves the most
In the garden like, “don’t tempt me”
My body, my blood it’s a crime scene
When she hit me up (hello?)
Saying pretty please
Cherry on
top
Ain’t no need to convince me
Here is the church and here is the steeple
Open it up and see all of the evil
Forgive me father, I did something illegal
Didn’t feel like a sin
It’s not my fault, it’s accidental
Starting to feel experimental
Don’t be so
shy, boy don’t be gentle
Da da da da da da da da
He thinks I’m the devil (Aw!)
Think I’ll take him down with me
Six feet, yeah I know he wanna kiss me
Devil (Aw!)
God is playing favorites
Backseat, yeah he just gotta face it
Father, Son, Holy Ghost
I’m the one she loves the most
Father, Son, Holy Ghost
I’m the one she loves the most
Ahh!
He thinks I’m the devil (Aw!)
Think I’ll take him down with me
Six feet, yeah I know he wanna kiss me
Devil (Aw!)
God is playing favorites
Backseat, yeah he just gotta f
ace it
Father, Son, Holy Ghost
I’m the one she loves the most
Father, Son, Holy Ghost
I’m the one she loves the most
