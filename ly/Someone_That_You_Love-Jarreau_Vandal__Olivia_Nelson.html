		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Stardust in the moonlight is all I wanna see
Look up in the night sky 'cause you nowhere to be seen
Never thought I'd be the one living for fantasy
Got me onto higher ground, I think I'm in too deep

When you heard me calling for you, already given up on
Someone that you love, someone that you love, someone that you love
Act like you don't know me 'cause you got too much going on for
Someone that you love, someone that you love, someone that you love
I'll be waiting, won't give up on you, you
I am waiting, always waiting for you, you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Like paper airplanes, they glide across the globe
Golddust in the daylight is when I need you most
Living in a place where I can't seem to keep you close
But you just go where the wind blows

When you heard me calling for you, already given up on
Someone that you love, someone that you love, someone that you love
Act like you don't know me 'cause you got too much going on for
Someone that you love, someone that you love, someone that you love
I'll be waiting, won't give up on you, you
I am waiting, always waiting for you, you
I'll be waiting, won't give up on you, you
I am waiting, always waiting for you, you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
