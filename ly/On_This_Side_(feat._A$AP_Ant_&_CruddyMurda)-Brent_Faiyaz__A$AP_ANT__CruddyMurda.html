		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh, cash out
Go to Prada (what?), I need clothes
Go to Melrose for some- (nyoom)
I'm at LA, at the Grove (shh)
White Air Forces, I stay low
Marino shirt underneath the coat (uh)
Gotta stay fresh, R.I.P. Bankroll (Fresh)
Lightskin shorty like Keyshia Cole (lightskin)
I love that bitch (I love that bitch), X and O
Paycheck I see decimals
Codeine taste like jello
Might grow my hair like Melo
Neon lights, my car glow
Back to the future like Marty McFly
I pour up a deuce 'cause I gotta stay high
I drive her whip, I touch her thighs
When I pull out my dick, don't act surprised

I don't know what it is
Is it me or how I live?
You'll die to feel what it's like to be here on this side
I don't know what it is (she said she wanna go to, uh, Jamaica)
Is it me or how I live? (I told her, close her eyes, you be anywhere you wanna be)
You'll die to feel what it's like to be here on this side (you dig what I'm sayin'?)

Damn
Ayy, Cruddy
Been through some shit, got a hell of a story
Bought me a watch, put me more in my glory
Come to my spot, you can never record me
I'm tryna get it and better my people
Tryna show I want more, 'cause they know I get evil
I hate all the rumors, a nigga been hearin'
I'm gettin' this paper, them niggas pretendin'
I need a preacher, a nigga been sinnin'
I took some Ls, but I'm usually winnin'
I poured a deuce of the Wock' and I added some Quai' (Wock', Wock')
And that's just how a nigga been sippin' (damn)
I pulled out a hundred and showed her it's me
She buy me a pint, I might get on one knee
Put Chanel on her bag and Rick on her feet
When I lift up my arm, that's a quarter on me

I don't know what it is (we gon' get this shit long as they print this shit, man)
Is it me or how I live? (Know what I'm sayin'? Brick on my wrist)
You'll die to feel what it's like to be here on this side (long live the dead, man, free all the guys)
I don't know what it is (R.I.P. A$AP Yams, man, big sheets and funnel on deck)
Is it me or how I live? (Lost Boys, A$AP shit, man, Marino Infantry shit, man 
Takin' over, man, for the 2000s, nigga)
You'll die to feel what it's like to be here on this side (you know the fuck we comin')

Don't know what I got, but it's hot (yeah, yeah)
Maybe, it's my style that drives 'em wild (drives 'em wild)
Maybe it's the dough or the clothes
Baby, I don't know, I don't know (on my motherfuckin' Flavor Flav shit)
Don't know what I got, but it's hot (five-hundred bitches in the crib like Ray J)
Maybe, it's my style that drives 'em wild (drives 'em wild)
Maybe it's the dough or the clothes (we still spendin' them bands for OG)
Baby, I don't know, I don't know (yeah, yeah)
I don't know

I don't know what it is
Is it me or how I live? (Oh, woah)
You'll die to feel what it's like to be here on this side
I don't know what it is
Is it me or how I live? (Yeah, yeah)
You'll die to feel what it's like to be here on this side

Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, Spizz, man, pour that four up, let's get high, my boy
