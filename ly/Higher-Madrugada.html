		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Higher
There's no need to come down
Arising through the other ground
These people
These people don't mean a thing
But don't you think it's funny
That now they get to have a say
Alright

We'll try this
We'll try this and see if it works
I want you just like that
Just like I
Always had you
Well, if it doesn't work
Then what we need is another drug
When I'm like this
It strikes me:
I'm the only one who knows you

So long

Draw a line
Into these spinning heads

Oh, higher
There's no need to come down
Arising through the other ground
This song
This song is the same as always
Anyway
Go on and shape it
Such a diamond, such a holiday

So long

Draw a line
Into these spinning heads
Go honey, be a holiday
Go honey, be a holiday
Go honey, be a holiday
Go honey, be a holiday
