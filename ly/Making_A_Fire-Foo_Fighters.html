		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Na na, na-na-na, na, na
Na-na-na, na, na, na-na-na, na
Na na, na-na-na, na, na
Na-na-na, na, na, na-na-na, na

I've been waitin', elevatin', hanging on a line
Hate to say it your new favorite's going out of style
Threw away those broken heroes, they're just wood and wires
Hallelujah, spread the news, but don't believe the hype

Alright
Are you afraid of the dark?
I know a place we can start

But if this is our last time
Make up your mind
I've waited a lifetime to live
It's time to ignite
I'm makin' a fire

Na na, na-na-na, na, na
Na-na-na, na, na, na-na-na, na

I was baited when I said I'd never tell a lie
Luck be damned I took a stand and finally hit my stride

Bye bye
Are you afraid of the dark?
I know a place we can start

But if this is our last time
Make up your mind
I've waited a lifetime to live
It's time to ignite
I'm makin' a fire

Na na, na-na-na, na, na
Na-na-na, na, na, na-na-na, na

Are you afraid of the dark?
I know a place we can start, yeah

Na na, na-na-na, na, na
Na-na-na, na, na, na-na-na, na
Na-na-na-na, na na, na-na-na, na, na
Na-na-na, na, na, na-na-na, na

So if this is our last time
Make up your mind
I've waited a lifetime to live
It's down to the wire

This is our last time
I've made up my mind
I've waited a lifetime to live
It's time to ignite
I'm makin' a fire

Na na, na-na-na, na, na
Na-na-na, na, na, na-na-na, na
Na-na-na-na, na na, na-na-na, na, na
Na-na-na, na, na, na-na-na, na
