		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I put my hands around your wrists, would you fight them? 
If I put my fingers in your mouth, would you bite them? 
So many things that I would do if I had my way with you 

I can keep secrets that I know that you want me 
You could dig your nails into my skin and you won't stop me 
You could twist and scream into the air but no one can hear you here 

And there will be no tenderness, no tenderness 
There will be no tenderness, no tenderness 
I will show no mercy for you, 
You had no mercy for me 
The only thing that I ask, love me mercilessly 

While your shouting friends that despise you to your face 
What would they say now if they saw you in this place? 
Naked and breathless, could you live with this disgrace? 
Could you live? Could you live? Could you live with this? 

And there will be no tenderness, no tenderness 
There will be no tenderness, no tenderness 
I will show no mercy for you, 
You had no mercy for me 
The only thing that I ask, love me mercilessly 

If I put my hands around your wrists, would you fight them? 
If I put my fingers in your mouth, would you bite them? 
So many things that I would do if I had my way with you 

And there will be no tenderness, no tenderness 
There will be no tenderness, no tenderness 
I will show no mercy for you, 
You had no mercy for me 
The only thing that I ask, love me mercilessly 
Love me mercilessly
