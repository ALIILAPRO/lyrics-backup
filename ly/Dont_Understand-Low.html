		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Carry the weight
And wait at the last
Bloodied my leg
And buried my fist
I don't understand
I don't understand
I send it away
Now it's back in my breast
And drag you to town
Treat you just like a son
Alone in my house
Did they teach you to run?
I don't understand
I don't understand
I don't understand
