		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I think you're smart
I think you're funny
But it's too bad
You don't have any money
I know we got a dog
Her name is Shari
But that's too bad
She won't buy me a rari
Gold digging anthem of the year
I'll make sure I am loud and clear
Sugar baby
That's my name do you hear
Cough up some money or I'll leave you here
Bye bye, my dear
At Christmas time
We handmade presents
And sure it's sweet
But I felt like a peasant
When I bring it up
It makes you so sad
I don't fucking care
Where's my gucci handbag
Gold digging anthem of the year
I'll make sure I am loud and clear
Sugar baby
That's my name do you hear
Cough up some money or I'll leave you here
Bye bye, my dear
