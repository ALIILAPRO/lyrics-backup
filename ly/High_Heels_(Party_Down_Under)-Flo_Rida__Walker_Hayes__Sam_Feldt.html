		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wake up like a billion dollars in the morning (oh, yeah)
I pick and choose from twenty cars, I'm Mr. Foreigns (zoom)
I'll take my whisky neat to hide my mixed emotions (my mixed emotions)
And they don't got a clue

My life is like parties over sleep
Monkey in the middle of my money and my dreams (oh, yeah)
My life is like high heels on the beach
Perfect on the surface, but I'm sinkin' underneath (oh, yeah)
You know my life is like

(Oh, yeah)
You know my life is like
(Oh, yeah)
You know my life is like

You know, life is priceless
There's pressure, but
I guess pressure make diamonds (oh, yeah)

You know my life is like
Giddy up, giddy up, family daddy
Almost got that Grammy
But I guess they don't do fancy like me, but I'm cool with it
I got low miles on my Prius
Rollin' down the road with Jesus
And my food at Applebee's is for free
I got this light and I'm lit like flash, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, God, I'm blessed, yeah, yeah, yeah
I do my best, I do 'cause I got so much I could lose
And they don't got a clue (ayy)

My life is like parties over sleep
Monkey in the middle of my money and my dreams (oh, yeah)
My life is like high heels on the beach
Perfect on the surface, but I'm sinkin' underneath (oh, yeah)
You know my life is like

Yeah, you know my life is like
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah

Yeah, you know my life is like 
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah
