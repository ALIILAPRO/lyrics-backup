		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What do you mean? You can't possibly
Be meaning the words that came out of your mouth
You wanna go home, but I just wanna have fun
You say that you're tired and want me to calm down

I was shy at first, but they welcomed me
There's way too many reasons to stay here
Just 'cause you want to, I don't think that it's fair
I'm putting my foot down, I'm staying here

I don't wanna go home
I'm fine right here
Leave me alone
'Cause I just wanna dance
And be in the zone
Eat some candy
Just leave me alone

Are you serious now? Are you leavin' now?
The truth is that I don't wanna stay without you
And if we go, we'll miss it all
I'm sleepy too, I promise this will be worth it

(It's getting late) yeah, I'm not nearly done
(I miss my bed) let's hang out, come on
(Are you really sure that you don't wanna come with us?)
Yeah

I don't wanna go home
I'm fine right here
Leave me alone
'Cause I just wanna dance
And be in the zone
Eat some candy
Just leave me alone
'Cause I just wanna
