		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  i already told you
you look so fucking cute when you do that
your fucking laugh and your dimples and shit
you wanna get high?

wonder what you're up to
been raining all night
smoking cigs in my bathroom
listening to doin time
4 more days til your birthday
am i supposed to call?
how do i fit in your life now,
what's the protocol?

i cant really complain
the sunlight hits my window
that's that novocaine
cause who needs company when you got mary jane?
but it's better with you by side
yeah i cant lie

i miss you when im high
i miss you when im high
and im high all the time
i miss you when im high

i miss you when im high
miss you all the fucking time
then im all alone again
yeah
i try my best not going back there
but you're always on my mind
its like you're trapped there baby
i just wanna smoke a backwood
without reminiscing visiting the past cause
i just miss your love, miss the tension
miss you fuckin' up all my plans
took me to a different dimension
even mary jane can't

i miss you when im high
i miss you when im high
and im high all the time
i miss you when im high

(high)
(high)

and i dont care how long it's been
i think a part of me will always miss you
i wish we could go back to 7-11 and get a slushee 
and stay up all night watching dumb youtube videos
and listening to songs that would become our songs
those times seemed so much more simple
but in a way they never were
i hope you're doing well
and uh, i miss you
