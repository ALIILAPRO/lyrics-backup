		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby, please don't go, stay a little while
You see, ooh, the night is young and we're having so much fun
I've been waiting all day long for this moment with you
Baby, please don't go, I wanna have you now

Wanna make love to you all night long
Wanna make love to you all night long

Baby, I can't wait, I wanna have you now
And hold you in my arms, keep you safe and warm
Please don't let this night end without integrating, consecrating our love
Please don't make me wait, I want to have you now

I wanna make love to you all night long
(All night, baby, all night)
Wanna make love to you, girl, all night long

I'm ready to go all the way
Please don't hold back your love from me
Honey, all my passion inside of me burns for you
Wanna make love, wanna make love

Wanna make love to you all night long
(I want you, pretty baby, all night, all night, all night tonight)
Wanna make love to you all night long
(Oh baby)

Wanna make love to you all night long
(Got to hold you in my arms, all night, baby, oh yeah)
Wanna make love to you all night long
(Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, all night long, girl)
(All night, just me and you, honey)
Wanna make love to you all night long
