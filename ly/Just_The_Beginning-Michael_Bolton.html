		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  'Cause in the end your love, your love, your love
Is just the beginning
'Cause in the end your love, your love, your love
Is all that I needed
I feel it in my heart and in my head
We'll never be on our own again
'Cause in the end your love, your love

I've been looking high and low
To find the light inside my soul
For a love deep down that missin' (missin')
And I've been running east to west
Heart is pounding in my chest
'Cause you've rewrote all that's written (written)
Through good and bad and in between
I wouldn't trade for anything
Now we can go wherever we want

'Cause in the end your love, your love, your love
Is just the beginning
'Cause in the end your love, your love, your love
Is all that I needed
I feel it in my heart and in my head
We'll never be on our own again
'Cause in the end your love, your love
Is just the beginning (oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
Is just the beginning (oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)

We can take the world head on
Make it out of any storm
Wide awake and finally livin' (livin')
Through good and bad and in between
I wouldn't trade for anything
We can go wherever we want

'Cause in the end your love, your love, your love
Is just the beginning
'Cause in the end your love, your love, your love
Is all that I needed
I feel it in my heart and in my head
We'll never be on our own again
'Cause in the end your love, your love
Is just the beginning (oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
Is just the beginning (oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)

Just the beginning
The start of something new
Just the beginning
And I'm stronger next to you
Oh, oh

'Cause in the end your love, your love, your love
Is just the beginning
'Cause in the end your love, your love, your love
Is all that I needed
I feel it in my heart and in my head
We'll never be on our own again
'Cause in the end your love, your love
Is just the beginning (oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
Is just the beginning (oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
Just the beginning (oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
Just the beginning (oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
