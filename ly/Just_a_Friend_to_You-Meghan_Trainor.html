		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh

Why you gotta hug me
Like that every time you see me?
Why you always making me laugh
Swear you're catching feelings

I loved you from the start
So it breaks my heart

When you say I'm just a friend to you
'Cause friends don't do the things we do
Everybody knows you love me too
Tryna be careful with the words I use
I say it 'cause I'm dying to
I'm so much more than just a friend to you

Mmm, mmm, mmm
When there's other people around
You never wanna kiss me
You tell me it's too late to hang out
Then you say you miss me

And I loved you from the start
So it breaks my heart

When you say I'm just a friend to you
'Cause friends don't do the things we do
Everybody knows you love me too
Tryna be careful with the words I use
I say it cause I'm dying to
I'm so much more than just a friend to you

You-oh-oh-oh-oh
You-oh-oh-oh-oh
You-oh-oh-oh-oh
You-oh-oh-oh-oh

You say I'm just a friend to you
Friends don't do the things we do
Everybody knows you love me too
I tried to be careful with the words I use
I say it 'cause I'm dying to
I'm so much more than just a friend to you

A friend to you
A friend to you
A friend to you
