		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Look at me, son it's not your fault

I wish you could read my mind
'Cause I'm not okay
Fake a smile and I'll make
It through another day
"I'll be alright", what I tell myself
But bottle after bottle danger to my health

Out of sight out of mind again
But I keep doing circles
Thinking this will end
Take some time, I'll be better then
A little time to feel okay again

Words play in my mind
Tell me I don't need you
Genuine is hard to find
When everyone is see through
Now I'm stressing all the time
Praying for a redo don't kick while I'm down
'Cause I'm human and I bleed too

Used to the silеnce
My feelings, they cauterizе
Absence of violence, little normal in my life
I think it's time that I let this feeling die
It won't change if we won't try

I wish you could read my mind
'Cause I'm not okay
Fake a smile and I'll make
It through another day
"I'll be alright", what I tell myself
But bottle after bottle danger to my health

Out of sight out of mind again
But I keep doing circles
Thinking this will end
Take some time, I'll be better then
A little time to feel okay again

Sweet sorrow didn't tell me you were leaving
Out the window with our memories
I don't need them burn our photos in the
Whiskey that I'm drinking
Bricks on my feet, Imma jump in the deep end

Used to the silence
My feelings, they cauterize
Absence of violence, little normal in my life
I think it's time that I let this feeling die
It won't change if we won't try

I wish you could read my mind
'Cause I'm not okay
Fake a smile and I'll make
It through another day
"I'll be alright", what I tell myself
But bottle after bottle danger to my health

Out of sight out of mind again
But I keep doing circles
Thinking this will end
Take some time, I'll be better then
A little time to feel okay again

Don't fuck with me it's not your fault
Don't fuck with me, alright?
Don't fuck with me Sean, not you
It's not your fault
