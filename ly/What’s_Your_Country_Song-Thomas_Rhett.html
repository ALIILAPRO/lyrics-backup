		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Did you grow up on a tractor?
Did your daddy let you drive?
Are you whiskey bent and hell bound
Even though your mama tried?
Did you cruise down a backroad
With your Dixieland Delight?
Are you on the Chattahoochee
On a barefoot blue jean night?

Everybody got a small town anthem
Everybody got a story to tell
Everybody got a Hallelujah
Everybody been through a little hell
When you're rollin' down a two lane highway
And you turn your radio on
Tell me which one hits you, baby
Yeah, what's your country song?
Yeah, what's your country song?

Do your exes live in Texas?
Are you so lonesome you could cry?
Are you heart broke 'cause you know
That ain't your truck in her drive?
Are your friends all in low places
Underneath the neon moon?
Were you already country
Back when country wasn't cool?

Everybody got a small town anthem
Everybody got a story to tell
Everybody got a Hallelujah
Everybody been through a little hell
When you're rollin' down a two lane highway
And you turn your radio on
Tell me which one hits you, baby
Yeah, what's your country song?
Yeah, what's your country song?

Who's your strawberry wine?
Yeah, what's your family tradition?
What makes you turn it up, make you raise your cup every time you listen?

Everybody got a small town anthem
Everybody got a story to tell
Everybody got a Hallelujah
Everybody been through a little hell
When you're rollin' down a two lane highway
And you turn your radio on
Tell me which one hits you, baby
Yeah, what's your country song?
Yeah, what's your country song?
