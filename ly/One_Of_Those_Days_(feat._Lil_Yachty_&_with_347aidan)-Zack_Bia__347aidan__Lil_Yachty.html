		  (Ah)
It's just one of those days
Oh, it's just one of those, hmm (ah)
It's just one of those days
Oh, it's just one of those, hmm

I feel like I've been flying, me and the clouds colliding
The stars have got me blinded, lightwaves I've started riding
Riding, oh, ho, ho, ho, ho
Trying to go, go, go, go
Running 'round, hunt 'em down, blast 'em with a hunnid rounds
I lost count, now I'm out, bullet shells all on the ground
I hope that they don't find me now
I'm hiding way above the clouds
I don't wanna die right now
I still gotta make you proud
I just wanna fly right now
I don't wanna let you down (ow)

(Ah)
It's just one of those days
Oh, it's just one of those, hmm (ah)
It's just one of those days
Oh, it's just one of those, hmm

1, 2, 3, go

Sunset, Bernie Mac, loud pack
They know how we get, every night, not to call
Oh yeah, coolin' up the moment, anything I need
I'll never try to fight it, if it ain't nothin' goin' on, nah, nothin' go on
Ain't it, all day, swervin' on a interstate, pickin' up double cups from the corner-store
No need for the rush, all good, comes with time, moderate at the perfect speed
Down in your sea, livin' in peace

(Ah)
It's just one of those days
Oh, it's just one of those, hmm (ah)
It's just one of those days
Oh, it's just one of those, hmm

1, 2, 3, go
