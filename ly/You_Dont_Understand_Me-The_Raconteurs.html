		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You don't understand me
But if the feeling was right you might
Comprehend me.
And why do you feel the need to tease me?
Why don't you turn it around,
It might be easier to please me.

And there's always another point of view,
A better way to do the things we do.
And how can you know me and I know you
If nothing is true?

What do you think that you are doing? (Oh...)
Who is the fool, the fool
Or the fool that you are fooling? (Fool that you are fooling...)
And maybe I just don't see the reason (Reason...)
But in the core of my heart
Your ignorance is treason.

And there's always another point of view,
A better way to do the things we do.
And how can you know me and I know you
If nothing is true?

You think you know how I feel.
It's not that big of a deal.
There's no such thing, it's not real.
Oh...

You don't understand me.
But if the feeling was right you might
Comprehend me.
And I don't claim to understand you. (Oh...)
But I've been looking around
And I haven't found anybody like you.

And there's always another point of view,
A better way to do the things we do.
And how can you know me and I know you
If nothing is true?
