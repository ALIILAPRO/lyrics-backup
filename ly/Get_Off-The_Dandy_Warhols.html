		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah like it or not.
Like a ball and a chain.
All I want to do is get off, I feel it for a minute babe.
Hot diggity dog, I love god all the same.
But all i want to do is get off, I feel it, I feel it, I feel it babe.

Baby, come on yeah, If you have a hard time gettin' there, maybe you're gone.
If you find, you find yourself forget yourself.

Yeah maybe I fought.
One thought I was saved.
But all I want to do is get off,
and feel it for a minute like the real thing baby, I guess.
I already forgot, what I thought I would say.
But all i want to do is get off. I feel it, I feel it, I feel it babe.

Baby, come on yeah. If you have a hard time gettin' there, maybe you're gone.
If you find, you find yourself, forget yourself.
Hey, come on yeah. If you have a hard time gettin' there, maybe you're gone.
If you find, you find yourself forget yourself.

And like it or not, Like a ball and a chain.
All I want to do is get off.
And feel it for a minute like the real thing baby, oh yes.
I already forgot, what I thought I would say.
But all I want to do is get off, I feel it, I feel it, I feel it babe.

Baby, come on yeah. If you have a hard time gettin' there, maybe you're gone.
If you find, you find yourself, forget yourself.
Hey, Come on yeah, If you have a hard time gettin' there, maybe your gone.
If you find yourself, forget yourself. Hey!
