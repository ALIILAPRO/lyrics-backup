		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My skin is dripping from blood
For that moment I sighed in relief
But I was not just going to be dying
I was going to bleed like sinners bleed

Paralyzed by the fear
For something I could not believe
A paradise to some
But hell to suckers like me
Unspeakable sights I behold
They're freezing and teasing my mind
Terrorized by the essence from beyond
The dimensions of another kind

Moving lights
Passes nihility in which I fell
Descent into fright
When I was slowly send down to hell

Scarlet black all I see
The void caught up with my eyes the horrid wait suffers me
Please set me free I just want to die

Palace of confusion
Castle of pain
Beneath these walls of power
I'm lost in hells Domain

I am scattered in my own blood
I am losing all my beliefs
But I was not just going to be dying
I am bleeding like sinners bleed
