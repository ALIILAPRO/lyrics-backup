		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sometimes I feel like my heart is on fire
Do you know how it feels
to set your soul on fire?
Well now I know 
From the bottom of my heart. 
 
Sinnerman, where you gonna run to?
cll along that day
Well I run to the rock, please hide me
I run to the rock, please hide me
I run to the rock, please hide me, lord
cll along that day
But the rock cried out, I can't hide you
The rock cried out, I can't hide you
The rock cried out, I ain't gonna hide you guy
cll along that day
I said, rock, what's a matter with you rock?
Don't you see I need you, rock?
Oh Lordy lord, all along that day
 
So I ran to the river, it was bleedin'
I run to the sea, it was bleedin'
I run to the sea, it was bleedin'
cll along that day
So I ran to the river, it was boilin'
I run to the sea, it was boilin'
I run to the sea, it was boilin'
clong that day
So I ran to the lord, please hide me lord
Don't you see me prayin'?
Don't you see me down here prayin'?
 
But the lord said, go to the devil
The lord said, go to the devil
The lord said, go to the devil
cll along that day
 
So I ran to the devil, he was waitin'
I ran to the devil, he was waitin'
I ran to the devil, he was waitin'
cll on that day, I cried - Power!  
Bring down - Power! 

Sinnerman you oughta be prayin'
cll along that day
 
Sometime I feel like my heart is on fire
