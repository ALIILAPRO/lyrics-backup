		  Aloneeee
In a room full of people I'm alone

If you really cared
I'd think youd call my phone

I don't know where I belong so imma Rome
When I die, don't know where I'mma ago

Smokin helps me feel like I'm lesss alone
I'm in my zone, I feel it in my Bones
Maybe, it feels good to overdose
Maybe my demons comfort me the most
Success seems so far
People self imprisoned can't be who they are
Scared to stand out thinkn well pull them apart
My self expression is my art

Imma leave it all behind when i depart
I'm Really a good person, I just can't control My heart
Some times u gotta cry it out, don't ignore Fallin apart
Held it all in, i Took it to far
Too far
I'm coldddd

Aloneeee
In a room full of people I'm alone

If you really cared
I'd think youd call my phone

I don't know where I belong so imma Rome
When I die, don't know where I'mma ago

Money, sex, fast cars cannot fill this void
Depressions been eating me up
And its out to destroy
I'm not one for the games
Press eject on you playboys
So much more on my mind
That I know I can't avoid
Workin but still broke

Basically Unemployed
I Can't match no stranger
I start to get paranoid

I miss your face man
Reminiscing off polaroids
Layin in my tub just thinking
I Gotta Drown out the noise

Aloneeee
In a room full of people I'm alone

If you really cared
I'd think youd call my phone

I don't know where I belong so imma Rome
When I die, don't know where I'mma ago

Death Star, Death Star
Another mentally ill sad rock star

Death Star, Death Star
I'll be back, this is just a head start
