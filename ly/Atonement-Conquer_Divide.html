		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We are not the same

We built this fortress up brick by brick
'Til you came along and tried
To knock it down
Throwing knives around to see
Where they'd land
There's the applause you wanted
From the crowd

You watched us fighting hard
Against the current
Right when we needed you the most
Oh don't you see we don't believe
A goddamn thing that you say
When it was easy to let go

You turned your back
A waste of my time, is all that you are
So don't look back get out of my life
We don't know who you are anymore

I don't ever want to know what it feels like
To become a shell of myself just like you
Diving deep to help you find your voice
But you can't find meaning in an empty room

We were fighting hard against the current
Right when we needed you the most
Oh don't you see we don't believe
A goddamn thing that you say
When it got hard you let us go

You turned your back a waste of my time
Is all that you are so don't look back
Get out of my life
We don't know who you are anymore

How does it feel how does it feel
To be a filthy fucking rat!

We're picking up the pieces
Your best wasn't good enough
And if you wanted atonement
You'll get nothing from us

You let it slip through your hands
Haunted by thoughts when you're alone
You wonder what could've been
If you didn't let it go

You turned your back a waste of my time
Is all that you are so don't look back
Get out of my life
We don't know who you are anymore

We don't know who you are
We don't know who you are
We don't know who you are anymore

We are not the same
