		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I guess I just feel like
I guess I just feel like
Nobody's honest, nobody's true
Everyone's lyin' to make it on through
I guess I just feel like
I'm the same way too

I guess I just feel like
Good things are gone
And the weight of my worries
Is too much to take on
I think I remember the dream that I had
That love's gonna save us from a world that's gone mad
I guess I just feel like
What happened to that?

I guess I just feel like
The joke's gettin' old
And the future is fading
And the past is on hold
But I know that I'm open, and I know that I'm free
And I'll always let hope in, wherever I'll be
And if I go blind, I'd still find my way
I guess I just felt like
Givin' up today
