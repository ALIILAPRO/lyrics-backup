		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Running out of answers
Burning through September
You were fire in the driveway last night
Saw it in your blue eyes
And you were just a small child
Now you're only ashes of a man

And I know it's the truth
I'm better off without you
But I can't seem to say it to your face
And I know it's not wrong
To leave you to the dogs
But I can't watch 'em tear into your skin

Simmer in your water
Boil until you smother
Spit is seething out between your teeth
I swore that I would be there
Icing out a fever
I've just grown so tired of getting burned

And I know it's the truth
I'm better off without you
But I can't seem to say it to your face
And I know it's not wrong
To leave you to the dogs
But I can't watch 'em tear into your skin

Your blood is running through me
Bleed until you lose me
I can't ever lose you from my head
