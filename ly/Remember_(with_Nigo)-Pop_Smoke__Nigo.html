		  Grr, buh
Look
Oh, yeah

Why the fuck are you hatin' lil nigga?
Lil nigga, I know why you hatin' lil nigga
'Cause I got that money, now you want that money
I get the clout, now you chasin' the fact
I put VS's in all of my chains
Know how to trap, nigga, three different ways
I ain't comin' outside, boy, unless I get paid
Yeah, we droppin' the fives and we droppin' them Gs
Mr. Big EBK, boy, I'll fuck everything
If you droppin' my knot, uppin' my knot
Opp up in Heaven, send shots to the sky
Ride for my niggas, yeah, only my guys
For my lil' niggas, we pourin' out liquor
I'm tryna see seven figures
I'm tryna see seven figures

Mama, no vacation but I'm on a island
Since a young nigga, we wildin'
Call up the Batman, I'm robbin'
Niggas ain't on my timin'
And my money keep pilin' and pilin'
Lil' nigga, you chuckin' and jivin'
I'm like, "Mmm hmm, whatever"
I'm still gon' send shots like the motherfuckin' reverend
Knock on the door, nigga, let me in
Yeah, we still sendin' shots up on President
All my niggas is felon and evident
Shack through the sea with no evidence
DayDay, have you screamin' through mega like, "Mayday"
Who the fuck are you talkin' to crazy?
If you don't want no beef, nigga, pay me
Nigga, talk to me nice, nigga lay-lay
Why the fuck are you hatin', lil' nigga, lil' nigga, on me?

'Cause that money gon' stay up on me
Know some niggas that chase up on me
That's why I keep Trey up on me
Now your bitch wanna lay up on me
And she wanna lick, lick up on me
I remember when I was in deep
Uh, flexin', if you gettin' bread, why you stressin'?
I bought a chain and a tuck in
I did fifteen on my check-ins
Big Louis Vuitton, what I'm steppin'
Big .38 for the weapon
And my pockets on swole yeah, I keep a bankroll
Walk with pole yeah, I'm always on go
'Member them days I was all in the slum
'Member them days I was playin' with
'Member them days I was playin' with
We both had a , nigga, why did you front?
