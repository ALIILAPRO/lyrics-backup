		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ayy, ayy ayy, woah, ayy, ayy, ayy

Don't you try forget about me, ayy, woah
I can't have them niggas 'round me, ayy
Woah i am off them hittas, drowsy, ayy, woah
I don't want your bitch she lousy, ayy, woah
Livin' demon but I'm where the
Clouds be, ayy, woah, ayy
Don't you try forget about me, ayy, woah
Don't you try forget about me
All my enemies befriending me, used to it
Everything I love gon' be the end
Of me but who knew it
I can't text her back because there's
Nothing else to do to it
Geekin' off the molly
Still sleepin' cause I'm used to it
Professional 'Tech sipper
Fuck about my damn liver
My ex say that Xannies still taste
Good because she's still bitter
Groupies got me lonely
Only reason I'ma deal wit' her
I can't listen to authority unless
A deal wit' it
