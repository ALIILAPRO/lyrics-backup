		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been on tenderhooks, ending in dirty looks
Listening to the Muzak, thinking 'bout this 'n' that
She said, "That's that, I don't wanna chitter-chat"
Turn it down a little bit or turn it down flat

Pump it up, when you don't really need it
Pump it up, until you can feel it

Down in the pleasure center, hell-bent or heaven-sent
Listen to the propaganda, listen to the latest slander
There's nothing underhand that she wouldn't understand

Pump it up, until you can feel it
Pump it up, when you don't really need it

Hey

She's been a bad girl, she's like a chemical
Though you try to stop it, she's like a narcotic
You wanna torture her, you wanna talk to her
All the things you bought for her, could not get a temperature

Pump it up, until you can feel it
Pump it up, when you don't really need it

Out in the fashion show, down in the bargain bin
You put your passion out under the pressure pin
Fall into submission, hit-and-run transmission
No use wishing now for any other sin

Pump it up, until you can feel it
Pump it up, when you don't really need it
Pump it up, until you can feel it
Pump it up, when you don't really need it

Pump it up, until you can feel it
Pump it up, when you don't really need it
Don't really need it
Don't really need it
Don't really need it
