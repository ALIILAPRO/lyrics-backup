		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh ay hey

What would I do if I didn't affect you?
Mary goin' round and round and round
Tell me the truth, I know that you're leaving.
Tell me the truth, I know it's you.

Strange it didn't affect me.
Strange it didn't affect me.

Ooh, stay.
Assuming to your heart, we got nothing at all.

What should I do?
It completely destroyed you.
Swimming around, around and drown. Oh.
Tell me the truth love.
I know that you need me.
Tell me the truth, I know it's you.

Strange it didn't affect me.
Strange it didn't affect me.

I came to say goodbye, cause you're feeling nothing.
Assuming to your heart, we got nothing at all.
Cause even if you wanna try to see if there's something.
I drove into your heart, we got nothing at all.

Ooh, I
I came to say goodbye, cause you're feeling nothing.
Assuming to your heart, we got nothing at all.
Cause even if you wanna try to see if there's something.
I drove into your heart, we got nothing at all.

And I don't care to say goodbye, cause you're feeling nothing.
I dug into your heart, we got nothing at all.
