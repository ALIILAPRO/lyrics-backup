		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Just like a certain motorbike gang from charming
or you’re looking for the old ultraviolence, you’re trouble.
Yes I knew right from the start.
And the labyrinth I thought I knew, rearranged to shape anew
at amazement of the excitement that once rang true.

And if I was a fool for you,
I’d wait 500 million hours on a park bench out on the moon.
But in full view of what you are, oh.

Just like a feline with multiple lives, she lost a couple but she used to have five.
A saviour of mankind.

And if I was a fool for you,
I’d wait 500 million hours on a park bench out on the moon.
But in full view of what you are, you’re a goddess you’re my rock star.

I fell in love with Alexandra even though I barely met her.
Even though we’d break our hearts before we’d even start.

And if I was a fool for you,
I’d wait 500 million hours on a park bench out on the moon.
But in full view of what you are, you’re a goddess you’re my rock star.
