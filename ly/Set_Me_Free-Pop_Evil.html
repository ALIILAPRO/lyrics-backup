		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Far away, so far below
All the demons inside of me

I feel so chained up, so locked up
Kicked down and thrown around
I walked through oceans and mountains
Been buried underground
Never could be who I wanna be
The best version of myself, who I wanna be
All the darkness, still it's inside of me
This time, set me free

Give up the ghost, afraid to let go
Inside what I didn't know
So tired of being alone
Does anybody out there feel like me?

Far away, so far below
All the demons inside of me
Falling apart everywhere I go
Why won't you set me free?

Give me a reason, a purpose
To help me realize
That I'm unbroken, I've spoken
No time to compromise
Never could be who I wanna be
The best version of myself, who I wanna be
All the darkness, still it's inside of me
This time, set me free

Give up the ghost, afraid to let go
Inside what I didn't know
So tired of being alone
So tired of being alone

Far away, so far below
All the demons inside of me
Falling apart everywhere I go
Why won't you set me free?
Someone is messing with my life
Why does lightning always strike me twice?
Far away, set me free

Give up the ghost, afraid to let go
Inside what I didn't know
So tired of being alone
Does anybody out there feel like me?

Somebody's messing with my life
Why does lightning always strike me twice?
So far away, so far below

Far away, so far below
All the demons inside of me 
Falling apart everywhere I go
Why won't you set me free?
