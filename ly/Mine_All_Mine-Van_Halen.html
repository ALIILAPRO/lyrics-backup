		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ow, forgive me father, for I have sinned
I've been through hell and back again
I shook hands with the devil
Looked 'em in the eye
Looked like a long lost friend

Ow, anything you want, any dirty deeds
He's got everything except what I really need
Keepin' me temporarily satisfied
But not one thing I've tried
Filled me up inside or felt like mine

Mine all mine

Yeah, and the search goes on
The more I look
My world keeps gettin' smaller
Staring at the sun, searchin' for the light
Almost ended up blind

Some only see what they wanna see
Claiming victory, oh, but that's not me
Gimme truth, gimme somethin' real
I just wanna feel like it's mine, all mine

Oh, really mine (mine, all mine)
Come on, gimme somethin'
Somethin' that's mine, all mine, all mine

Mine all mine

All the words on the wall
Look the same in the mirror
Every riddle and every clue
Ow, you've got Allah in the East
You've got Jesus in the West
Christ, what's a man to do?

They'll find a cure for anything
Just kill the pain or numb my brain
We see a man speakin' the word of God
Provin' to be a fraud, oh, his own church applauds

Stop lookin' out, start lookin' in
Be your own best friend
Stand up and say

Hey this is mine oh, all mine
Yeah and baby you've got somethin'
And I got somethin'
Hey, and it's mine, all mine, all mine

Mine all mine
Mine all mine
Yes, I'm searchin'
Mine all mine
Uh, I got to have it

Mine all mine
Mine all mine
Well
Mine all mine
Got ta, got ta, got to

Mine all mine
Got to have it
Mine all mine
Mine all mine

You got, you got, you got Mine all mine
