		  You (yeah)
I'm on the run with you
You (yeah)
I'm on the run with you

Summer 2019 was like a pipe dream
Pulling up in a six-speed
Trying to run away from myself (run away from me)
Never really got my peace
Nothing but beef
Couldn't shake me up
I don't think that I could fake it much longer

It feels like I'm dreaming
No use in the feeling
Don't know who to trust (breaking bad, breaking bad)
I'm losing the meaning
No way that I'm healing
It's never enough (breaking bad, breaking bad)

I was on the west side, it was a far cry
From the city and the bright lights
But I can see the sun on me now (shine the sun on me)
I guess I got bad instincts
'Cause I'm in sync with the worst of us
And I don't really mind burning in Hell

So let me count the ways (renegades)
Running from the life that we made
Something like the bulls on parade
Something like the icing on cake
But if you lose, if you lose me (yeah)
No telling what they all might think about it
As if meaning was everything

It feels like I'm dreaming
No use in the feeling
Don't know who to trust (breaking bad, breaking bad)
I'm losing the meaning
No way that I'm healing
It's never enough (breaking bad, breaking bad)

It feels like I'm dreaming
No use in the feeling
Don't know who to trust (breaking bad, breaking bad)
I'm losing the meaning
No way that I'm healing
It's never enough (breaking bad, breaking bad)

You (yeah)
I'm on the run with you
You (yeah)
I'm on the run with you (yeah)
