		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Every time I wake up next to you, I talk to God
And I'm so damn grateful 'cause you make up for the things I'm not
Didn't know I needed nothing 'til I needed you ('til I needed you)
In a world that's spinnin', it ain't easy lettin' go
8 billion people, we're just looking for a hand to hold
Everybody's tryna find someone to hold on to (hold on to)

It's okay, it's okay
We all try to pretend that we're brave
When I'm weak, yeah, I'm strong 'cause of you at the end of the day

Everybody needs somebody (everybody needs somebody)
Somebody to remind you that you're not alone
Who gon' defend you like an army (defend you like an army)
And never let go (and never let go)

Everybody needs somebody (everybody needs somebody)
Somebody to wake up to when everyone's gone
So if you need me, then you got me (if you need me, then you got me)
I'll be the shoulder you cry on
Everybody needs some-
Everybody needs somebody

Every time I look at you, I'm looking at a star
It's the way you light up every room just being who you are
Didn't know I needed nothing 'til I needed you ('til I needed you, oh)
Right before I met you, I never believed in magic
But you stole my heart before anyone knew you had it
I know (yeah, yeah) that you know (yeah, yeah)
What we got, it don't come easy

It's okay, it's okay
We all try to pretend that we're brave
When I'm weak, yeah, I'm strong 'cause of you at the end of the day

Everybody needs somebody (everybody needs somebody)
Somebody to remind you that you're not alone
Who gon' defend you like an army (defend you like an army)
And never let go (and never let go)

Everybody needs somebody (everybody needs somebody)
Somebody to wake up to when everyone's gone
So if you need me, then you got me (if you need me, then you got me)
I'll be the shoulder you cry on
Everybody needs some-
Everybody needs somebody
