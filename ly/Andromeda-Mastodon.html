		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It never ends
The game isn't done
I feel the crawling and haunting upon us until you listen

It never ends
Enough is enough
Taking your essence and use it to strengthen their own flesh and blood

Time watching as the sand flows through glass
Light calls to me from future and from past

This kills me to know
We cannot learn

It never ends
The ink isn't dry
The Great Consolation has written a second lease on your life
The Great Consolation has granted a second lease on your life

Light watching as the sand flows through glass
Time calls to me from future and from past

This kills me to know
We cannot learn

Time watching as the sand flows through glass (time is moving as sands flowing)
Light calls to me from future and from past (light is blinding radiating)

It never ends, it never ends, it never ends

Chronic illusions, confusing conclusions
Foster the culture, predict the deception
Chronic delusions with caustic solutions
