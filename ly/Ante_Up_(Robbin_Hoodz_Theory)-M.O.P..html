		  Where did all mutherfuckers go?

Attention please, attention please
This shit here feels like a whole entire world collapsed
Motherfucker! Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah) yeah
Yeah (yeah) yeah (yeah) yeah (yeah)
Blunt(blunt) blunt (blunt) blunt (blunt) blunt (blunt) blunt

Busta Rhymes now, M.O.P. Now
What you want now? (What you want now?)
What you want now? (What you want now?)
What you want now? (What you want now?)
What you want now?
(What you want want want want want want blunt blunt)

Ante up! No, cut that fool
They want to act stupid gun-butt that fool
When I cock that tool, nigga run your damn jewels
'Fore we fuck around and lay you up in your own blood pool, nigga
Hunt you down nigga, run your ass down
Unleash the hounds 'til them niggas'll gun your ass down (stop it)
You frontin' like this was a thing of the past
With tattoos over the scars a nigga left on your ass
My niggas think lopsided, bust, they got cross-sided
In the subways they rob trains runnin' along-side it
(Blunt blunt) see motherfucker we don't play for that shit
And if you want your shit back you had to pay for that shit
You little costume niggas, romper-room niggas
Get you in the night or early in the afternoon niggas
We takin' your whole shit while we pass through
Even the shirt off your back, nigga run that too

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I catch you backstage, give me the keys to the Escalade
You think you cute hoe? Take off them Gucci shades
I get my dogs to do you dirty, they all seven-thirty
Rock a ski-mask, whether it's June or February
I take your show money (ohh) take your 'dro money (ohh)
Yo yap that fool, 'cause I don't know money
For my peeps that hate slow money, I put them in the industry
So they can come and take all your money
Wish I could bring pun back
(Blaow!) bitch, run that!
(Blaow!) bitch, run that! (Blaow!) bitch, run that
So keep actin' like you don't know where the funds at
And I'ma show y'all motherfuckers where the guns at

Ante up! Yo, yap that bitch
She try to spaz out, then smack that bitch
Hoe you don't be rhymin', you still memorizin'
Remi want them goddamn diamonds (huh)

Ante up! Yap that fool
Ante up! Kidnap that fool
It's the perfect timin', you see the man shinin'
Get up off them go damn diamonds (huh!)
Ante up! Yap that fool
Ante up! Kidnap that fool
Get him (get him) get him, hit him (hit him) hit him
Yap him (zap him) yap him (zap him)

Ante up! Yap that fool
Fuck hip-hop, rip pockets, snatch jewels
Ante up

What? My whole family nuts
Run up yo' stash house, tie granny up
Make you strip butt-naked
Young buck got struck with the gun butt (for what?)
For tryin' to tuck the necklace
I'm young hungry armed and reckless
On the streets with a death wish
Don't hide when you see me, I'm on the guestlist

Ante up!

Show no mercy, B.K., nigga, thirsty thirsty
We bang hollows, you misrepresentin' The game 
motherfucker you lame and your chain hollow
Hit him (hit him) hit him, flash the tech
Yap your chain, smash the lens in your specs
Listen it's, lil' fame right?
With that Brownsville mentality to Shanghai

Hey yo I'm firin' out a coppertop city, with a whole empire
A clip full of blue-tips and a hand full of fire
Eat deep dirt nigga (yep)
It's berk' I put in work until it hurt nigga (step)
Easy out the truck punk, 'fore I leave your ass leakin'
I'ma bang 'til the springs in this thang start squeakin'
Die cocksucker, boom bap boom bap
Aight motherfucker, what's wrong with you?

Ante up! Yap that fool
Ante up! Kidnap that fool
It's the perfect timin', you see the man shinin'
Get up off them god damn diamonds (huh!)
Ante up! Yap that fool
Ante up! Kidnap that fool
Get him (get him) get him, hit him (hit him) hit him
Yap him (zap him) yap him (zap him)

Hahahahaha
What the fuck, what the fuck, what the fuck
Nigga
What the fuck, what the fuck, what the fuck, what the fuck
What the fuck, what the fuck
Mutherfucker
