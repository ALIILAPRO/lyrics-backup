		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Never done it like this before
I've been looking for a love like this
You're the one that I've waited for
You're the one that I want to kiss
I'm driving through the night
I'm tryna make it right
I know it takes 9 hours
But I'll be there for you
You know I care for you
And I will bring you flowers
I promise it won't be long (I promise)
There's no way I'll let you go (there's no way)
I know it looks like it's too far (it's too far)
I just wanna make sure you know
Make sure you know
I'm driving through the night (driving through the night)
I'm tryna make it right (tryna make it right)
I know it takes 9 hours
But I'll be there for you (I'll be there for you)
You know I care for you (you know)
And I will bring you flowers
I'm driving through the night
I'm tryna make it right
I know it takes 9 hours
But I'll be there for you
You know I care for you
And I will bring you flowers
