		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Thought when I grew up
I would be the same as the ones who gave me my last name
I would not give in, I would not partake
In the same old drugs everyone else takes

I'm better than that, I'm better than that
I'm living my life so I go to heaven and never come back
But look where I'm at, look where I'm at
I'm living the life that I said I wouldn't, I wanna go back

I used to call my mom every Sunday
So she knew her love wasn't far away
But now I'm all fucked up out in LA
'Cause I care more about what other people say
I used to not take chances with God's name
But it's been so long since I last prayed
And now I'm all fucked up and my heart's changed
'Cause I care more about what other people say
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
'Cause I care more about what other people say

I wish I could shelter the boy I knew
From the constant hell I put him through
'Cause I'm all grown up and I'm black and blue
I could use some tape, I could use some glue

I'm better than that, I'm better than that
I should be living my life so I go to heaven and never come back

I used to call my mom every Sunday
So she knew her love wasn't far away
But now I'm all fucked up out in LA
'Cause I care more about what other people say
I used to not take chances with God's name
But it's been so long since I last prayed
And now I'm all fucked up and my heart's changed
'Cause I care more about what other people say
Yeah, yeah, yeah
'Cause I care more about what other people say

Thought when I grew up
I would be the same as the ones who gave me my last name

I used to call my mom every Sunday
So she knew her love wasn't far away (far away)
But now I'm all fucked up out in LA (out in LA)
'Cause I care more about what other people say
I used to not take chances with God's name (God's name)
But it's been so long since I last prayed (since I last prayed)
And now I'm all fucked up and my heart's changed (and my heart changed)
'Cause I care more about what other people say (what other people say)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah, no, no)
'Cause I care more about what other people say
