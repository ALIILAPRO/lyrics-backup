		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Pushing all your dreams aside 
Never see the warning signs 
Just one look and leave you blind 
Everybody knows

Chew you up and spit you out 
Never even make a sound 
Leaves a trail of broken hearts 
Everywhere she goes

Cold dark magic in those deep brown eyes 
Draws you closer with that sweet disguise 

She's so magnetic 

You know she's so magnetic 
She'll pull you in, you'll try to push away 
You know she'll pull you back again 
She's so magnetic 
She's so magnetic

Poison in that pretty smile 
Just one taste will drive you wild 
You're an addict in denial 
Everybody knows

Heaven turning into hell
She's got you under her spell
Want to keep her to yourself
Everywhere she's goes

Cold dark magic in those deep brown eyes 
Draws you closer with that sweet disguise

She's so magnetic 

You know she's so magnetic 
She'll pull you in, you'll try to push away 
You know she'll pull you back again 
She's so magnetic 
She's so magnetic

You told all your friends it was time for her to leave
but then look who's back again begging, crawling on your knees
She's got what you want
She's got what I need 
She'll hypnotize you 
She'll paralyze me

You know she's so magnetic 
She'll pull you in, you'll try to push away 
You know she'll pull you back again 
She's so magnetic 
She's so magnetic
You know she's so magnetic 
She'll pull you in, you'll try to push away 
You know she'll pull you back again 
She's so magnetic 

Poison in that pretty smile 
Just one taste will drive you wild 
You're an addict in denial
Everybody knows
