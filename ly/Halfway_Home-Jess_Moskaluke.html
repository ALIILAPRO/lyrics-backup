		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know I just left
But I had to see you again
Your lips, these front steps
Were on repeat in my head

Somewhere down that two-lane road
A feelin' hit me, I didn't know

'Til I got halfway home
It stopped me like a red light
I want more than just a kiss goodnight
Want you to hold me from this porch light to the mornin' light
I couldn't take it
I only made it halfway home, yeah
Halfway home

So how 'bout I come in?
The door you kissed me up against
Show me why I
Pulled back into your drive

Hold me closer in your arms
Thank God I didn't get that far

Yeah, I got halfway home
It stopped me like a red light
I want more than just a kiss goodnight
Want you to hold me from this porch light to the mornin' light
I couldn't take it
I only made it halfway home, yeah
Halfway home

I saw your eyes
I felt your touch
I realized
I fell in love

Halfway home
It stopped me like a red light
I want more than just a kiss goodnight
Want you to hold me from this porch light to the mornin' light
I couldn't take it
I only made it halfway home, yeah
Halfway home, yeah
Halfway home, yeah
Halfway home
