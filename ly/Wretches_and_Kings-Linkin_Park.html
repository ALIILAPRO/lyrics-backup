		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's a time, when the operation of the machine becomes so odious
Makes you so sick at heart, that you can't take part
You can't even passively take part
And you've got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels
Upon the levers, upon all the apparatus
And you've got to make it stop

To save face, how low can you go?
Talk a lotta game, but yet you don't know
Static on the wind, makes us all say whoa
The people up top push the people down low
Get down, and obey every word
Steady, get in line if you haven't yet heard
Wanna take what I got, don't be absurd
Don't fight the power, nobody gets hurt
If you haven't heard yet, then I'm lettin' you know
There ain't shit we don't run when the guns unload
And no one make a move, unless my people say so
Got everything outta control, now everybody go

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

Feel alone, final blow
We, the animals, take control
Hear us now, clear and tall
Wretches and kings, we come for you

So keep face, how slow can you go?
Talk a lotta shit, and yet you don't know
Fire on the wind, makes you all say whoa
The people up top and the people down low
Get down, and I'm runnin' it like that
The front of the attack is exactly where I'm at
Somewhere in between the kick and the hi-hat
The pen and the contract, the pitch and the contact
So get with the combat, I'm lettin' them know
There ain't shit you can say to make me back down, no
So push the button, let the whole thing blow
Spinning everything outta control, now everybody go

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

Feel alone, final blow
We, the animals, take control
Hear us now, clear and tall
Wretches and kings, we come for you
Still alone, fight our blow
Filthy animals beat down low
Steel and bone, black and blue
Run at the sunshine, we come for you

From the front to the back and to side to side
If you feel what I feel, put 'em up real high
Front to the back and the side to side
If you feel what I feel, put 'em up real high
Front to the back and the side to side
If you feel what I feel, put 'em up real high
Front to the back and the side to side
If you feel what I feel, put 'em up real high
Front to the back and the side to side
If you feel what I feel, put 'em up real high
Front to the back and the side to side
If you feel what I feel, put 'em up real high

When the operation of the machine becomes so odious
Makes you so sick at heart, that you can't take part
You can't even passively take part
And you've got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels
Upon the levers, upon all the apparatus, and you've got to make it stop
And you've got to indicate to the people, run in to the people on it
And unless you're free, the machine will be prevented from working at all

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
