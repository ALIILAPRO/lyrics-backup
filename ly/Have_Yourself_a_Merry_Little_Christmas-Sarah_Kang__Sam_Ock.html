		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on our troubles will be out of sight, mmhm

Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay
From now on our troubles, will be miles away, mmhm-hm

Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more

Through the years we all will be together
If the fates allow
I will hang a shinning star upon the highest bough, mmhm
Let's have ourselves a merry little Christmas now

Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore (of yore)
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more

Through the years we all will be together
If the fates allow
I will hang a shinning star upon the highest bough, do-bo-bo-bo-da-da-da
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now
