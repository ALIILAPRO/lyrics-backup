		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey what's happinin' homie
It's your lil' one Plies man
I ran across da eyes of a lil' baby da other day homie
Lil' mama so bad she had me hypnotized
I couldn't get my eyes off her
Lemme tell you how it feels to be hypnotized

You got me so hypnotized
The way your body rollin' round and round
That booty keep bumping, titties just bouncin' up and down
You got me so hypnotized
The way your body rolling round and round
That booty keep bumping, titties just bouncin' up and down

It's two o'clock in the mornin'
I'm jaged up, and I'm horny
All I need now is some moanin'
That pussy got me zonin'
Her vibe tell me she want it
She gotta fuck how she on me
I got her tonight 'cause she joanin'
I know in the panty she foamin'
I'm locked eyes on that monkey
I know she wet, 'cause she told me
That ass on the shit pokin'
Every nigga in here scopin'
I see me up in her pokin'
She bent over and I'm strokin'
Her cheeks spread wide opened
I'm beatin' it and I'm focused

You got me so hypnotized
The way your body rollin' round and round
That booty keep bumping, titties just bouncin' up and down
You got me so hypnotized
The way your body rollin' round and round
That booty keep bumping, titties just bouncin up and down

Now do it some more (just like that)
Just do it some more (yes just like that)
Girl do it some more (now shake that ass, make a nigga like me spend that cash)
Now do it some more (just like that)
Just do it some more (yes just like that)
Girl do it some more (now shake that ass, and make a nigga like me spend that cash)

She bad as hell and she swoll
I'm tryna play in her hole
Lil' mama a dime, she cold
I fuck her once and she sold
I want her naked no clothes
I'm into private shows
No limit anything goes
Imma let her ride me her toes
Just stand in front of me and pose
You touch mine, I touch yours
To get her sprung is my goal
First time I seen her I froze
I had to get her she knows
She buck'd it then she fold
'Cause I'm too real and she knows
She wanna goon and it show

You got me so hypnotized
The way your body rollin' round and round
That booty keep bumping, titties just bouncin' up and down
You got me so hypnotized
The way your body rollin' round and round
That booty keep bumping, titties just bouncin' up and down

Now do it some more (just like that)
Just do it some more (yes just like that)
Girl do it some more (now shake that ass, make a nigga like me spend that cash)
Now do it some more (just like that)
Just do it some more (yes just like that)
Girl do it some more (now shake that ass, and make a nigga like me spend that cash)

You got me so hypnotized
The way your body rollin' round and round
That booty keep bumping, titties just bouncin' up and down you got me so hypnotized
The way your body rollin' round and round
That booty keep bumping, titties just bouncin' up and down
