		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Yung Germ)

Fear was a dog from my side of the tracks
Took a little walk and he never came back
"We'll find your son," told his mom to relax
"He would never go nowhere without his baseball bat"
Found his body layin' on the side of the creek
With a backpack on and a note near his feet 
It said, "Everything will end eventually
Every leaf will blow into the wind eventually"
And I swear, that night, I saw him in my sleep

Blood shadow that floats right above me
I can't scream and I can't shout
And I can't breathe, I can't scream out
And I swear, that night, I saw him in my sleep
Blood shadow that floats right above me
I can't scream and I can't shout
And I can't breathe and I can't see

I'll see you in space, cowboy
I'll see you in space, cowboy
I'll see you in space, cowboy
I'll see you in space, cowboy
And all dogs go to Heaven
And all dogs go to Heaven
And all dogs go to Heaven
And all dogs go to Heaven

Fear was a dog from my side of the tracks
Took a little walk and he never came back
Had a SIG-Sauer with one in the mag
And a book full of notes in a small backpack
Walked in the woods dropped a note to be read
Took out his gun put one in his head
Blood in the sky and the leaves turn red
And the deer's run away while the children in bed

'Cause nobody cared while he was breathing
He thought he was living for no reason
'Cause nobody cared for him
Nobody cared if he was leaving
Lived a thug life through reading
'Cause nobody was there for him
And I guess you're part of the problem too
And I hope that it all swallows you
And now, I'm part of the prodigies
And every night it starts to bother me

I'll see you in space, cowboy
I'll see you in space, cowboy
I'll see you in space, cowboy
I'll see you in space, cowboy
And all dogs go to Heaven
And all dogs go to Heaven
And all dogs go to Heaven
And all dogs go to Heaven

And all dogs go to Heaven
And all dogs go to Heaven
And all dogs go to Heaven
And all dogs go to Heaven
