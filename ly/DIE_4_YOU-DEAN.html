		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't wanna go
'Til everything comes crashing down
You're the one I want
When everything comes crashing down

그냥 왜인지 난
너가 돌아올 것 같은데

I don't wanna go
'Til everything comes crashing down
You're the one I want
When everything comes crashing down

Could you tell me once again, again? (oh-oh-oh)

널 안아줬던 그 날 처럼
오늘도 비가 오고 있어
Could you kill me once again, again? (oh-oh-oh)

'Cause I know, I know
I'll be loving you
I'll be loving you
I'm still loving you
Baby, you know I'd die for you

네가 떠오르면 나는 미쳐
사실 아직 안믿겨 
늦었을지도 모르지만 let you know

어떤 멜로디도
그 어떤 스토리도 내겐
네 잔상일 뿐인데

I know it is way too late (I know it is way too)
I know it is way too crazy (I know it is way too)
But if you give me one more chance

Could you kill me once again, again? (oh-oh-oh)

날 떠나갔던 그 날부터
하루도 잊은적 없어 난
Could you kill me once again, again? (oh-oh-oh)

'Cause I know, you know
I'll be loving you
I'll be loving you

What's wrong? (ooh)
Baby, you know I'd die for you

I would die for you
I would die for you
I would die for you
I would die for you
