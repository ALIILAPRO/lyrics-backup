		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The motherfuckers got in my head
Trying to make me someone else instead

It's my world now
It's my world now
It's my world
It's my world

"Mama, why's it raining in my room?"
"Cheer up, boy, clouds will move on soon"
Heavy fog got me lost inside
Gonna sit right back, enjoy this ride

It's my world, you can't have it
It's my world, it's my world
It's my world, you can't have it
It's my world, it's my world
It's my world, you can't have it
It's my world, it's my world
It's my world
Sucker

I'm out of my head, out of my head
Get 'em out of my head, out of my head
Get 'em out

Who's in charge of my head today
Dancing devils in angels way

It's my time now
It's my time now
It's my time
Yeah, it's my time

Look out, motherfuckers, here I come
I'm gonna make my head my home
The sons of bitches tried to take my head
Tried to make me someone else instead

It's my world, you can't have it
It's my world, it's my world
It's my world, you can't have it
It's my world, it's my world
It's my world, you can't have it
It's my world, it's my world
It's my world
Sucker

Yeah, out of my head, out of my head
Get 'em out of my head, out of my head
Get 'em out

Not only do I not know the answer
I don't even know what the question is
Not only do I not know the answer
I don't even know what the question is

God, it feels like it only rains on me
God, it feels like it only rains on me
God, it feels like it only rains on me
God, it feels like it only rains on me

Not only do I not know the answer
I don't even know what the question is
Not only do I not know the answer
I don't even know what the question is

God, it feels like it only rains on me
God, it feels like it only rains on me (like it only rains on me)
God, it feels like it only rains on me (like it only rains on me)
God, it feels (oh God, oh God, oh God)
Like it only rains on me (like it only rains on me)

Not only do I not know the answer
I don't even know what the question is
Not only do I not know the answer
I don't even know what the question is

Sucka

Out of my head, out of my head
Out of my head, Get 'em out of my head
Get 'em out

Enough's enough, enough's enough
Enough's enough, enough's enough
Enough's enough, enough's enough
Enough's enough, enough's enough
