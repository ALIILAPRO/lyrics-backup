		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I just need a look in the mirror
Need a wish in my pocket
Always stretching the truth and
I need to learn to be honest

억지로 숨죽일 뿐
허탈함에 갇혔네
I had a love but I lost it

I've got some shit I should mention
Pretend my ego is dying
Ask me if I love attention
And I'll say no but I'm lying

시든 눈빛을 애써
숨길 여유도 없어 이젠
긴 헤매임의 끝에
외롭기를 자처해

I, I, I
I don't understand I don't know
Why, I, I
I'm this way it's like this every time
And I'm so fucked up but it's fine
I just find somebody to blame and then I sigh

I just need a look in the mirror
I need a wish in my pocket
I'm always stretching the truth and
I need to learn to be honest

억지로 숨죽일 뿐
허탈함에 갇혔네
I had a love but I lost it

더는 남아 있지 않아
소비할 감정이 말이야
답답함에 움켜쥔 심장은 파란색일 테지 아마
오늘이 빨리 지나갔으면 해
내일을 기대하는 건 아닌데

I, I, I
I don't understand I don't know
Why, I, I
I'm this way it's like this every time
And I'm so fucked up but it's fine
I just find somebody to blame and then I sigh

I just need a look in the mirror
Need a wish in my pocket
Always stretching the truth and
I need to learn to be honest

억지로 숨죽일 뿐
허탈함에 갇혔네
I had a love but I lost it

I just need a look in the mirror
Need a wish in my pocket
Always stretching the truth and
I need to learn to be honest

억지로 숨죽일 뿐
허탈함에 갇혔네
I had a love but I lost it
