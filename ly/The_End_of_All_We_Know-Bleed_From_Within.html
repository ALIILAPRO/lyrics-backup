		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I’m hearing voices, but I'm not seeing progress. Devastate, can’t relate, stay the fuck away from me. We run at nothing ‘til we can’t turn back. So we dig our way to the other side. I finally feel like I can breathe again. Take a moment to absorb the consequence of taking the fall. I shed my skin once and for all. The light is shifting out of sight. But not out of mind. What the light has failed to capture. Is this the end of all we know? I will not deny the warning signs. This time I will not stand alone. Fall into insanity again and again. Lingering obsessions dwell in the shadows below. In this moment there is pain in our eyes. All that we have left we will die for. I finally feel like I can breathe again. Take a moment to absorb the consequence of taking the fall. I’ve spent years on the ground looking up at the world for mercy. I shed my skin. Let the fires rise. From the ashes we will see the light. Where the embers lie. Our liberty no longer denied.
