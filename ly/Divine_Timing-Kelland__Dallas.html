		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I no longer need the space for two 
Took some time away to face the truth 
sick and tired of the deja vu
now i never really think of you

got rid of the void
Forgotten your voice 
I'm closing my eyelids 
Lately I'm loving the silence 

time with myself
abundance of wealth
stars in the sky are aligning 
Damn

This must be divine timing
this must be divine timing
this must be divine timing 
this must be divine timing 
everything is bright and vibrant

Feeling grateful for a lot of things
I've been open to what life will bring 
i've been careful with my energy 
universe is always blessing me 

got rid of the void
Forgotten your voice 
I'm closing my eyelids 
Lately I'm loving the silence 
time with myself
abundance of wealth
stars in the sky are aligning 
Damn

this must be divine timing 
this must be divine timing 
everything is bright and vibrant 
this must be divine timing 
this must be divine timing
