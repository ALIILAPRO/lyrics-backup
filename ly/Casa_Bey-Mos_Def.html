		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Magnetic, the flows are athletic
Dimensions are perfected
But the static and kinetic is power
Past pressure, and mass beyond measure
You can place son where ever, he "Don't stop"
Magnetic, the flows are athletic
Dimensions are perfected
But the static and kinetic is power
Past pressure, and mass beyond measure
You can place son where ever, he Bed-Stuy "Boogie Man"
Magnetic, the flows are athletic
Dimensions are perfected
But the static and kinetic is power
Past pressure, and mass beyond measure
You can place son where ever, he "Thank you and thank you very kindly"
Magnetic, the flows are athletic
Dimensions are perfected
But the static and kinetic is power
Past pressure, and mass beyond measure
You can place son where ever, he Bed-Stuy forever

The fresh, the author and associates are proud to present
M-Def the Black, fantastic raw
Dynamic, true Ecstatic, ghetto outstanding
Classic active every place, I have
The skill, power, passion, raise your red lantern
Stanzas and anthems based on expansion
A vantage point of the past, present and after
Rapture, mastered the ceremonial master craft
Of the masterminds who craft masters
Master and viber from Brooklyn Island
Legendary asylum, Black Star shining
Bedford-Stuyvesant isn't Strivers
Flatbush blazing like it's smoke of the prophet
And it's constant, remarkable artwork
And God is the author, from Flaco to Archer
We right on target, a ready steady responsive
A black light bright in the darkness, y'all just
A fantastic rawness, good morning, yes

You are rocking with the fresh
You are rocking with the fresh
You are rocking with the Def
With a kiss
Hah, ye-hee-hes
Right now on it alwaaaaays
Soul shocking, never stopping
Always keep the beat rock
Hah, ye-he-he-heees
Ye-hee-he-hes
Right now on it always

Play on all digits
You know you can't stop my go
You can't stop my go
Born to be who I am
(Been born to be who I am)
Bright light from a distant star
(Bright light from a distant star)
Miracles, answered prayers
(Miracles, answered prayers)
Huh, all in together now
You can't stop my go
I've been born to be where I am
A bright light from a distant star
Miracles and answered prayers
You can't stop my go
I've been born to be where I am
Mos light from a distant star
Miracles and answered prayers

Yes, ye-hee-hees
Right now on it always
Soul shocking, never stopping
Always keep the beat on rock
Hah, ye-he-he-hees
Hah, ye-he-heees
Right now on it always
Author and associates are proud to present
Static rhythms of Boogie Man productions

Don't stop the rock
You don't, don't stop the rock
You don't, don't stop the rock
You don't, don't stop the rock
You hear the people say "Don't stop"
Don't stop the rock
You don't, don't stop the rock
You don't, don't stop the rock
You don't, don't stop the rock
You hear the people say "Don't stop"

You can't stop my go
I've been born to be where I am
Bright light from a distant star
Miracles "Don't stop"
