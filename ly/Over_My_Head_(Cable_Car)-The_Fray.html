		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I never knew
I never knew that everything was fallin' through
That everyone I knew was waiting on a cue
To turn and run when all I needed was the truth
But that's how it's gotta be
It's comin' down to nothin' more than apathy
I'd rather run the other way than stay and see
The smoke and who's still standing when it clears

And everyone knows I'm in
Over my head, over my head
Eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind, she's on your mind

Let's rearrange
I wish you were a stranger, I could disengage
Just say that we agree and then never change
Soften a bit until we all just get along
But that's disregard
Find another friend, and you discard
As you lose the argument in a cable car
Hanging above as the canyon comes between

And everyone knows I'm in
Over my head, over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind, she's on your mind
Everyone knows I'm in
Over my head, over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind, she's on, on

And suddenly I become a part of your past
I'm becoming the part that don't last
I'm losing you, and it's effortless
Without a sound
We lose sight of the ground in the throw around
Never thought that you wanted to bring it down
I won't let it go down 'til we torch it ourselves

And everyone knows I'm in
Over my head, over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind, she's on your mind
Everyone knows
That she's on your mind
Everyone knows I'm in over my head
I'm in over my head
I'm over my

Everyone knows I'm in
Over my head, over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind, she's on your mind
