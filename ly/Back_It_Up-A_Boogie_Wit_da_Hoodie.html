		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You know exactly what happens when baddies and baddies link up
I don't only want Venus, I want Serena
Big ass crib, so much acres, can't find my neighbors
Big ass watch like the chain off Flavor Flavor
Sorry, mama, these pills are for centration
You the only one that mean it when you say "Congratulations"
If I gotta up this pole, I promise I ain't overthinkin'
Ooh, baby, blue faces and VV's
Probably the reason why that you the coldest ever (coldest ever)
Right to my collection when we're not together
Fuck a bad bitch, now I'm feelin' better

Christian Louboutin bag came with the spikes
This type of swag might change your mind
Put this dick in you, might replace your spine, huh, look

Back it up, baby, come and back it up
Immaculate and I got the ratchet tucked
Shorty bad and niggas mad that they ain't one of us
Don't you let nobody tell you you ain't one of one
(Ooh, nah, nah, nah) Huh? Irregular
I go platinum every single time I smack her butt
Before I even hit the age of twenty-one
I knew one day that I would end up blowin' up

Pakistan, if they front, we goin' back again
I lay her right down on her stomach, she rolled over, said "I'm comin'"
Came to see me in commercial, now she never go nowhere without private jets
Do it for Boogie, baby, fuck what Simon says
She know I'm the reason niggas dressin' the way they dress
But it's okay, 'cause 50 told me, "Go 'head, switch the style up"
I hate how niggas hate, but they don't ever want no problems

Christian Louboutin bag came with the spikes
This type of swag might change your mind
Put this dick in you, might replace your spine, huh, look

Back it up, baby, come and back it up
Immaculate and I got the ratchet tucked
Shorty bad and niggas mad that they ain't one of us
Don't you let nobody tell you you ain't one of one
Huh? Irregular
I go platinum every single time I smack her butt
Before I even hit the age of twenty-one
I knew one day that I would end up blowin' up
