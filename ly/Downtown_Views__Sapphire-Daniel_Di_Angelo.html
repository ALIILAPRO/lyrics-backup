		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everything looks purple from here if we look down
I'm always embodied by the underground
What got me this high in the first place was you
You
Yeah, downtown views from the building with that girl
She's gonna make me fall in love
Pussy so gold, makes me want to wrap it up
I know your world
Know how you stack it up
I'll teach you ways to back it up
When she rack up, put the stacks away
Every time she comes back, flights get delayed
I'm still stuck on my mary jane, 'cause she come back but never stay
I'm too tired of having to wait
I'm too tired of having to wait
Yeah
Every time I pull up downtown inner-city baby say
She wanna get it down tonight, tonight yeah
And we get the city on fire, puff up chronic
Say she love, she lovin' the view oh-wow
Empty bottles on the tables and the floor
And she took it all the way, she almost throw up
And that look upon her face make you go up to the top floor kick your toes up yeah
Sapphire oo-ooh
Made me loot the cities of harbor
Uh, when she rack up, put the stacks away
Every time she come back, flights get delayed
I'm still stuck on my mary jane, 'cause she come back but never stay
I'm too tired of having to wait
I'm too tired of having to wait
Yeah, so I always take her to the
Downtown views from the building with that girl
She's gonna make me fall in love
Pussy so gold, makes me want to wrap it up
I know your world
Know how you stack it up
I'll teach you ways to back it up
Throwin' stacks, I bet I'll get that ass
Baby, I popped two Xans earlier, don't ask
We're still on Hollywood time
But we're losing connections, it happens so fast
Only way to love is when you're fucking attached
Look, we hit the rooftop twice
Valet park treat us nicely, 'cause my bitches always seem so nice
I swear the downtown views from the hotel light up her life
Every time we get to fuck she always say "love" yeah
Feel her juice up in my tastebuds, yeah
Girl, you know I like the taste of you
Pussy tight so I hit the sofa, yeah
Just call me when you're coming over, yeah
Sapphire oo-ooh
Made me loot the cities of harbor
Yeah, downtown views from the building with that girl
She's gonna make me fall in love
Pussy so gold, makes me want to wrap it up
I know your world
Know how you stack it up
I'll teach you ways to back it up babe
