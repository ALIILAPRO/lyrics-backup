		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is a call to arms,
Will you stand beside me?
This is our time to fight,
No more compromising
And this blackened heart will sing
For sad solidarity

Halo, over our demise
Following a God so blind
Shallow, in their sickening
Swallow not, the shit they feed

This is a right to life,
Not the Religious Rights act
This is abortions knife,
Aiming at the womb of
The Christian conspiracy
So open thine eyes and see, the

Halo, over our demise
Following a God so blind
Shallow, in their sickening
Swallow not, the shit they feed

Our time will come, our time will come
Our time is now, our time is now

And I won't pray for you
And I won't pray for you
And I won't pray for you

Halo
Follow
Shallow
Swallow
Halo, over our demise
Following a God so blind
Shallow, in their sickening
Swallow not, the shit they feed

Your words will never hold us down
Prayers won't be spared on you
Satisfaction denied
Til you're dead and gone
Gone
Dead and gone!
You're gone!
