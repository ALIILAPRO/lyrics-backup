		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't show you how to
Love yourself
But I promise you
I'll be the one
By your side

I won't tell you the truth
About love
It's so difficult
For me
Babe, I don't want you to get hurt

When I first met you
I know that we can be
Together forever
Night we spent so long
Until you're asleep on my lip

'Cause I've 
Been waiting for this so long
Oh, long
And I
Will always keep you safe

If we ever get into a fight
Listen to me, babe
Don't let it take
Over us

If you missed the way we
Used to be
Put us on the phone
Instead of you just cryin' all night

When I first met you
I know that we can be
Together forever
Night we spent so long
Until you're asleep on my lip

'Cause I've 
Been waiting for this so long
Oh, long
And I
Will always keep you safe
