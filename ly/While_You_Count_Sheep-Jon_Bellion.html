		  Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum
Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum
Beautiful Mind, Mind, Mind
She's literally like five feet away from me
While I'm recording this
Sleeping on the couch
This is for her, sleepy ass

I wrote this while I'm watching you sleep
(You sleep)
You're behind me on the couch in the studio
So I'm gonna make this lullaby sweet
(Lullaby sweet)
And soft so I don't wake you up
You're smiling as you sleep so you dig it
Only I can make some soft shit and rip it
I knew that you were dope
From the jump like ribbit
'Cause all these other girls
Fall short like midgets

The Sandman gon' flip when he come through
While you count sheep
I'll give him music to jump to
The Sandman gon' flip when he come through
While you count sheep
I'll give him music to jump to
While you count sheep
I'll give him music to jump to
While you count sheep
I'll give him music to jump to
Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum
Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum
Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum
Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum
While you count sheep
I'll give him music to jump to

I wrote this while I'm watching you sleep
(You sleep)
Your hair is all over the place and I love it
I won't put the bass in this beat (This beat)
If it knocks, then I might wake you up
You're smiling as you sleep, so you like it
She just let me work 'cause
She know I cook diamonds she know I'm paid
But she still nine-to-five-ing
That's why she allowed to
Hang while I'm writing

The Sandman gon' flip when he come through
While you count sheep
I'll give him music to jump to
The Sandman gon' flip when he come through
While you count sheep
I'll give him music to jump to
While you count sheep
I'll give him music to jump to
While you count sheep
I'll give him music to jump to
Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum
Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum
Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum
Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum
While you count sheep
I'll give him music to jump to

Dopest musical breakdown ever, ready?
If I make this
Then maybe you will wake up and get naked
Girl, I'm playing, girl, I'm
Playing, girl, I'm playing, maybe not
I make this
Then maybe you will wake up and get naked
Girl, I'm playing, girl, I'm
Playing, girl, I'm playing, maybe not
If I make this
Then maybe you will wake up and get naked
Girl, I'm playing, girl, I'm
Playing, girl, I'm playing, maybe not
I make this, then maybe you will wake up and
Wake up and get, wake up and get, yah, yah
Wake up and get, wake up and get, yah, yah
Wake up and get, wake up and get, yah, yah
Wake up and get, wake up and get, yah, yah

Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum
Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum
Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum
Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum
Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum
Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum
Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum
Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum
Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum
Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum
Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum
Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum
Ah, look who finally decided to wake up
