		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Fuck the fire, we got grease)
(It's a Wayne beat)
(Elijah, run another one)

A young nigga up, but I'm humble, all this money gettin' doubled
Nigga play me, bust his bubble, if he make it, he gon' struggle
Ten milli' with a switchy get busy, I don't tussle
Got a nigga, but she fuckin', I'ma get this bitch in trouble
Damn, we fucked y'all club up? Let us reimburse y'all
I ain't never had a kennel, but I used to serve dog
Y'all boys some lil' bitty kids, we'll burp y'all
If you don't see bro on tour, he somewhere gettin' work off (the bag in)

I ain't in the streets no more, I'm on some rap shit (I'm on some rap shit)
If you make me remember you, I call you back, bitch (I call you back, bitch)
I'm comin' down off these drugs, get me back lit (get me back lit)
She droppin' tears, sayin' she love me, you should act, bitch
And the award for best actress goes to this bitch
If you don't take care of your kids, you a fuck nigga (you a fuck nigga)
It is what it is, fuck what it was, nigga (what it was, nigga)
You put your hands on a bitch, you a fuck nigga (you a fuck nigga)
That's why she comin' over here and gettin' fucked, nigga (nigga)

All talk, no action, we ain't hearin' you (shut the fuck up)
Brodie hug the block tight like Amiris do (outside)
If I book a bitch a flight, it's gon' be spiritual (yellow plane)
If she fuck and don't suck, I think that's very rude
Made six figures last time I drove the Benz
My pockets can't remember last time they saw some lint
These niggas can't remember last time they saw they kids
And they last time was they last time tryna spin (mission failed)
Christmastime, I take my son to Dubai (we outta here)
Wifey know that she can pull whatever off the lot
You flashin' lil' money, what the fuck can that buy?
Not them other niggas, if it's up, you gon' die (bitch)

But look, I ain't in the streets no more, I'm on some rap shit (I'm a rapper)
If you make me remember you, I call you back, bitch (I call you back)
I'm comin' down off these drugs, get me back lit (get me turnt)
She droppin' tears, sayin' she love me, you should act, bitch (you should act)
If you don't take care of your kids, you a fuck nigga (you's a fuck nigga)
It is what it is, fuck what it was, nigga (fuck it)
You put your hands on a bitch, you a fuck nigga (oh, you's a fuck nigga)
That's why she comin' over here and gettin' fucked, nigga (no cap)

All night though
Every time she say she 'bout to link with her girls
Run some errands, go grocery shopping
She linking with gang, dumbass nigga
G7
