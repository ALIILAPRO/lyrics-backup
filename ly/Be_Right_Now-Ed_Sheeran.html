		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A lifetime is starting to feel like
It's falling short of the mark
But it's all that we got
Every teardrop, every wrong turn
Made the moment we found
And it's coming around, around, around, around, around

I don't wanna miss one thing
We can turn the whole world down
And listen to the in-between
We are, we are the sound
There's nothing but the space we're in
The hurry and the noise shut out
Just stay here and be right now

The shadows cling to the ceiling
And fracture the light that lands in our eyes
Every moment changes the whole view
And just when it ends
I feel it again, again, again, again, again

I don't wanna miss one thing
We can turn the whole world down
And listen to the in-between
We are, we are the sound
There's nothing but the space we're in
The hurry and the noise shut out
Just stay here and be right now

And nothing else matters
And nothing else matters
And nothing else matters
Stay here and be right now

And nothing else matters
And nothing else matters
And nothing else matters
Stay here and be right now

I don't wanna miss one thing
We can turn the whole world down
And listen to the in-between
We are, we are the sound
There's nothing but the space we're in
The hurry and the noise shut out
Just stay here and be right now
