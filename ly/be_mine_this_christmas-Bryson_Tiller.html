		  Haha
It's cold
A cold December night

I thought you would be mine this Christmas
Ring, ring, ring, hear the bells ringin' on the Christmas tree
Minnesota winter, snow is glistenin'
Yeah, but I'll be spendin' this one different
Checked the fireplace and your stocking's missin'
Hard to celebrate when you're not here with me
I'm writin' from a distance
So, I guess I'll be all alone this Christmas
No, Santa didn't grant my wishes
You and me, by the fire, kissin', baby
Unwrap you like you was my gift, baby

And you're top of my list now, baby
How did we go out like this now, baby?
Seen a star, had to make a wish now, baby
My only wish is for you to come home but how does this sound, baby?
Baby, I'll make the trip, I'll tell you what
I'll sing it to you like this, I'll tell you what

I thought you would be mine this Christmas
Ring, ring, ring, hear the bells ringin' on the Christmas tree
Minnesota winter, snow is glistenin'
But I'll be spendin' this one different
Checked the fireplace and your stocking's missin'
Right now you're not here with me
Writin' from a distance
So, I guess I'll be all alone this Christmas
No, Santa didn't grant my wishes
You and me, by the fire, kissin', baby
Unwrap you like you was my gift, baby

Since you don't wanna be friends, I should probably move on
This issue, you don't wanna make amends
Girl, I been tryna make this whole thin' make sense
You don't know I'm in it all the way to the end
I been trippin' off this situation I'm in, a lotta reminiscin'
Like me and you out at the Chalet last Winter
Snow in your hair, tell me where you wanna go, I'm there
Anywhere you wanna go, I'm there
I really don't wanna be alone this year
You know I'll make a trip, I'll tell you what
(Sing it to you like) this, I'll tell you what

I thought you would be mine this Christmas
Ring, ring, ring, hear the bells ringin' on the Christmas tree
Minnesota winter, snow is glistenin'
But I'll be spendin' this one different
Checked the fireplace and your stocking's missin'
Right now you're not here with me
Writin' from a distance
So, I guess I'll be all alone this Christmas
