		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't know baby where we stand
With the future that we planned, so long ago
I don't know

Well I don't know if you're my friend
Or a long lost lover coming back again
Where did you go
Baby I don't know

You'd think by now that I would know better
But I ain't got a lot to show
I could write a song or I could write a letter
I could write a book about I don't know

Watched my life fall through the cracks
Like a long gone train that ain't coming back
Where did it go?
Baby I don't know

You'd think by now that I would know better
But I ain't got a lot to show
I could write a song or I could write a letter
I could write a book about I don't know

My past is pretty rocky
And my future ain't long
Why do I think we got a chance at all
Where does the wind blow?
Baby I don't know
