		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How far do you go when you look for love?
How long does it take before you give up?
Do you see rays from up above?
Does it only happen once?

Is it like running in the rain?
Is it like Sunday mornin' shame?
Is it like fire when you dance?
When you give love a chance?

Tell me, how long do you have to be strong?
Do you have to hold on before you walk away?
Tell me, how come all the feelings go numb?
When it comes to your love, what's it gonna take?

21 days, 21 days

Is it a dream that you set free (you set free)
Or holdin' your hands so tightly?
Is it a wish that you regret
Waitin' for happiness?

Tell me, how long do you have to be strong?
Do you have to hold on before you walk away?
Tell me, how come all the feelings go numb?
When it comes to your love, what's it gonna take?

21 days
(Ooh-ooh)
Oh

Tell me, how long do you have to be strong?
Do you have to hold on before you walk away?
Oh, tell me, how come all the feelings go numb?
When it comes to your love, do I leave or do I stay?

21 days, 21 days

How far do you go when you look for love?
