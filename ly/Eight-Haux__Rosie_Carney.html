		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When you woke (when you woke)
I was there (I was there)
I was quiet (I was quiet)
Lost in your stare (lost in your stare)

It was dark (it was dark)
I drew the blinds (I drew the blinds)
Let the light in (let the light in)
Stinging our eyes (stinging our eyes)

You went cold
You went cold

You took me in
Caught in two minds
Gave me a home
Taught me to be kind
To say hello
Or wave goodbye
To always love
And never lie

You went cold
You went cold
You went cold
You went cold

I awoke
(And you were there)
It was silent
(I was scared)

I was eight
You were old
I held your hand
As you went cold

As you went cold
'Cause I was eight
And you were old
I held your hand

As you went cold
'Cause I was eight
And you were old
I held your hand
As you went cold

As you went cold
'Cause I was eight
And you were old
I held your hand
As you went cold

You went cold
You went cold
