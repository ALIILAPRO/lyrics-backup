		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can see you coming back for more
Coming back for more, eh
If you walk out that door

When I'm with you it all feels different
When I'm with you it all makes sense
And I know you don't feel no different
Whoa-ooh
There's a magic to how we livin'
There's a magic to what this is
It's like a dream and we both day-trippin'
Whoa-ooh

All I know is if you walk away
There'll be something
There'll be things you can't replace
All I know is if you walk away
There'll be something
Baby, that's okay, 'cause

I can see you coming back for more
Coming back for more (yeah)
If you walk out that door
I can see you coming back for more
Coming back for more (yeah)
If you walk out that door (ooh)

I don't want to feel nobody 
If it isn't you, baby
Contigo me pongo naughty
Been thinking about you lately
Ita ita loco como mueve el culo Anitta
De todas yo soy la favorita
Tú estás pa mi y yo pa ti todita
Pa-pa-pam-pam, pam-pam-pam-pam
I know what you like, sing it like
Pa-pa-pam-pam, pam-pam-pam-pam
Esto va a empezar (oh)

All I know is if you walk away
There'll be something (something)
Baby, that's okay, 'cause

I can see you comin' back for more
Comin' back for more (hey)
If you walk out that door
I can see you comin' back for more (I can see you)
Comin' back for more (yeah)
If you walk out that door (door, ooh)

When I'm with you, it all feels different
When I'm with you, when I'm with you
I can see you comin' back for more
Comin' back for more
If you walk out that door

Oh (ow)
Ah, ta-da-da, ah
Ooh
Ah, ta-da-da, ah
If you walk out the door
Ooh-ooh, oh
When I'm with you, when I'm with you (come on)

I can see you comin' back for more (comin' back for more)
Comin' back for more (ooh-ooh)
If you walk out that door (door)
I can see you comin' back for more (ah)
Comin' back for more (yeah)
If you walk out that
