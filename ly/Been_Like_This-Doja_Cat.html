		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Since you've been like this
Baby, I don't really wanna be in like this
Ever since you've been like this
Baby, I don't really wanna be in like this

See you've been changin', baby
In good ways and bad ways
Can't say what I say, it's far too late
And I think you've made me, baby
Made me too nervous
Cryin' and this hurt and I gotta tell you why

Since you've been like this (this, this, this)
Baby, I don't really wanna be in like this (this, this, this)
Ever since you've been like this (this, this, this)
Baby, I don't really wanna be in like this (this, this, this)

Who is frontin', baby?
We don't have fun these days
It's more than complicated, ah
(Could've said you wasn't wit' it)
Told me to stop my whining
When you gave up I tried
I gave you all this time
Gave you my everything
Said I can do this all night, baby
Said I was actin' out of line, maybe
Can't put my trauma to the side
When you told me I was lyin'
Had me feelin' I could die, baby
I seen a grown man cry, baby
To see you do it, ain't special, no
Wonder when I ain't there
What the fuck you've been sayin'
Talking 'bout how I say shit, oh
And I know it might mess you up
Hate me, gon' get you love
Ain't nobody gon' set you up
I ain't even gon' sweat you, love
And we'll never be friends like this
God couldn't forgive like this
Way I really went in like this
Thank God I ain't been like this, yeah

Since you've been like this (this, this, this)
Baby, I don't really wanna be in like this (this, this, this)
Ever since you've been like this (this, this, this)
Baby, I don't really wanna be in like this (this, this, this)

Since you've been like this
I bless your heart (like this)
But I, I can't take no more (like this)
I bless your heart (like this)
But I, I can't take no more

(Baby, I don't really wanna be in like this)
(Since you've been like this)
(Baby, I don't really wanna be in like this)
