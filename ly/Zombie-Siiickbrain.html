		<p>
		  sorry i don’t pick up the phone 
don’t ask me, i don’t wanna leave home
knock on my door I’m gonna ignore 
not enough or so much I’ll wake up on the floor 

You give me something that i need
I’ll be your zombie baby turn off my crazy 
Now just sedate me won’t you please 
I’ll be your zombie baby turn off my crazy 

you’re like my own 
special injection 
a quiet voice 
that tells me to question 
my deepest fears 
the lust that I live for
fades away 
not sane anymore

it doesn’t hurt 
not if you like it 
i get withdrawals 
my muscles are knotted 
can’t give u up
when there’s blood in my locket 
i know you’re here 
feel you in my pocket 

You give me something that i need
I’ll be your zombie baby turn off my crazy 
Now just sedate me won’t you please 
I’ll be your zombie baby turn off my crazy 

you’re like my own 
special injection 
a quiet voice 
that tells me to question 
my deepest fears 
the lust that I live for
fades away 
not sane anymore

you’re like my own 
a quiet voice 
my deepest fears 
fades away 
not sane anymore
