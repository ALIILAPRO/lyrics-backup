		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We watch the children playing
Beside the Christmas tree
Presents are wrapped up, it's beautiful
And secretly the gifts you'll hide
The fun awaits for you inside

Christmastime has come
There'll be toys for everyone
'Cause Christmastime has come for you

I remember dreaming
Wishing, hoping, praying for this day
Now I sit and watch them
The little ones I love
So excited by the way

Christmastime has come
There'll be toys for everyone
'Cause Christmastime has come for you

And now the word is given
It's time to peek inside
It's time to let the toys out
So anxious for your look of joy and delight
The waiting for just your surprise

Christmastime has come
There'll be toys for everyone
'Cause Christmastime has come for you

Christmastime has come
There'll be toys for everyone
'Cause Christmastime has come for you
For you
