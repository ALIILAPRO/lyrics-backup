		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  French press on a pedestal
Two scoops haven’t worked for too long
Fill the beaker now and wait a song
It’s carefully pressed down
Caffeine makes the world go round
How did he get up anyhow?

Cigarette butts in the kitchen sink
The floor’s been sticky for so long
No more water only stale drinks
Be careful not to drink it all
How did he get up anyhow?

Something political
He doesn’t know how to feel
She moved on like a breeze
And he’s gone back to the original

Bar lights on a pedestal
A few drinks each day since she’s gone
Late night vernissage – yeah she’s the one
Be careful not to drown

Something political
He only does what she says
She left a terrible mess
And he’s gone back to the original
Something political
He doesn’t know how to fell
She moved on like a breeze
And he’s gone back to the original
