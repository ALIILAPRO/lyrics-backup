		  Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
Check up on my ears
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
I'm 'bout to cop the Porsche
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
You leave me no choice, take 'em to
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana

I take over the streets, fresh off the banana boat
I come straight from the east, where niggas split your canteloupe
Just tell me where you wanna meet, I'm coming with a gang of dope
My cigar full of loud
I'm laced up to the fucking floor
The Porsche Carrera, Panamera, 911
I do the whole dash, dropping all cash
Gutter to the death of me, I'm sticking to the recipe
Plug, deal with Columbians, I know Sosa
All I got is my balls and my word, fuck the Roaches
Everything we do, we put Versace on the sofas
The money got me geeked, like I took a hit of coka
My life is a movie, I gotta stay focused

Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
Check up on my ears
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
I'm 'bout to cop the Porsche
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
You leave me no choice, take 'em to
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana

On the hood you see the Stallion
Passenger a stallion
Niggas getting nervous
I'm passing out the Valium
I suggest you pop it
But please don't get too sleepy
Used to have them bitches twerkin'
Up in 400 West Peach tree
Bet ya those same hoes'll see me
Be like that's how you feeling
Used to stay up after twelve
Now your worth like twelve million
Boy you did, boy you did it
You did the unexpected
I say fuck the unexpected
I just did what I projected
I swear young women are lost these days
While older women dig me
Fucking women that knew Biggie so
We really ain't no biggie
It's just OVO and XO and Freebandz of committee
And shout out to Toronto
Bitch, I'm Tony in my city

Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
Check up on my ears
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
I'm 'bout to cop the Porsche
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
You leave me no choice, take 'em to
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana

Another shot of Quelo
She be comin' back for pesos
When you plugged in with Pedro, it's hard for hoes to let go
See AK's ain't no bitch, nigga I'll split your tato
Ain't nothin' 'bout me ordinary, I come with the yayo
I move like a mob boss, it's gon' take an army
The world is mine, nigga, you get it if you want it
You fuckin with me you'll move to Alaska by the mornin'
You want me to be the bad guy, okay, it's on then
Champagne spillin', crabcakes everywhere
My white bitch trippin, she say ain't playin' fair
I'm bout to cop a tiger and put it in the castle
Freebandz a company, so nigga, it don't matter though

Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
Check up on my ears
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
I'm 'bout to cop the Porsche
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
You leave me no choice, take 'em to
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
