		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's something about your love
There's something about it
There's something about your love
There's something about it

Can't find any words
Couldn't tell you what makes it perfect
You're the cure for the hurt
Came around when I least expected

There's something about you, yeah
Yeah, I know

There's something about your love
There's something about it
There's something about your love
There's something about it

There's something about your love
There's something about it
There's something about your love
There's something about it

There's something about your love
There's something about it
There's something about your love
There's something about it

(Yeah, I know)
(Yeah, I know)

There's something about it
Something about it, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

There's something about your love
There's something about it
There's something about your love
There's something about it

There's something about your love
There's something about it
There's something about your love
There's something about it

There's something about your love
There's something about it
There's something about your love
There's something about it
