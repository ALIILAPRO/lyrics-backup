		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Trapped in a lonely body I'm
Losin' control
Can't show my emotions and I'm
Losing my soul
Could it be that I'm obsessed
With feeding my disease
I couldn't make it know that
Hidden things that no one
Sees

Yeah loser I'm a secret loser
Loser I'm a secret loser

Fighting a losing battle
Pretending to win
Repenting to holy unknowns
Pretending to sin
All i do is hide the wounds
Where blood just
Won't congeal
Couldn't ever take my soul
'Cause isn't there to steal

Yeah loser I'm a secret loser
Loser I'm a secret loser

Though I'm the loser there is
No winner
There's nothing left to win
The hidden reasons now in
Deletion
Are lost in sin
So heed my warning the time is
Dawning
I'll tell you here's the twist
The truth is lying
Below the surface i don't exist

Loser I'm a secret loser
Loser I'm a secret loser

Seeing is not believing it don't
Mean a thing
Although it appears to be that
The loser is king
I can understand that what
You see you think is real
But underneath the surface is
A wound that cannot heal

Yeah loser I'm a secret loser
Loser I'm a secret loser
Loser I'm a secret loser
Loser I'm a secret loser
Loser I'm a secret loser
