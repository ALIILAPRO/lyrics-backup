		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Good evening and welcome to a test of the minds
This match begins as our thoughts begin to grind
I send a pawn towards you, a subtle piece of my attack
Pondering the next move, I guess you'll never know unless you try
It

Knight jumps queen if you know what I mean
Anticipation of the final scene
Knight jumps queen, so get prepared
For this checkmate has been happily declared
As the knight jumps the queen

You have made selections, a white castle crumbles at your feet
To Counter the men in black, your moves must all be elite
A bishop takes a rook and this cuts him down to size
This is no tailor-made situation
I guess I have some real competition for once

Knight jumps queen if you know what I mean
Anticipation of the final scene
Knight jumps queen, so get prepared
For this checkmate has been happily declared
As the knight jumps the queen

Hours and hours to a stalemate, this game has come to a close
Could it end without a climax between to exhausted foes
Night-time's falling on the castle, it's bringing in another day
The concentration was impossible, I never had a doubt I wouldn't
Win it from you

Knight jumps queen if you know what I mean
Anticipation of the final scene
Knight jumps queen, so get prepared
For this checkmate has been happily declared
As the knight jumps the queen
