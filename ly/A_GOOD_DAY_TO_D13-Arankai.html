		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've had one too many fuckin bad days
I got no friends running in the rat race
Took the red pill now I got a headcase
Killed the old me and left that body cold case
Cut the dead weight got me feeling lighter now
No one saved me but I'm feeling better now
It's a good day to die and my hands are steady
Got the reaper on my line, bitch come and get it

I look pretty good being dead inside
Couple drugs later and I'm back to life
La da da da, setting fire to my limousine I love the smell of gasoline
I'm a product of society that used and desecrated me
It's taken everything I have to cope
The first thing you learn, everybody wants a turn
A chance to twist the knife put in your back

I've had one too many fuckin bad days
I got no friends running in the rat race
Took the red pill now I got a headcase
Killed the old me and left that body cold case
Cut the dead weight got me feeling lighter now
No one saved me but I'm feeling better now
It's a good day to die and my hands are steady
Got the reaper on my line, bitch come and get it

Guess who, me bitch
Wake up with a gun barrel pressed to your eyelid
Ain't nobody has this kind of appetite for inciting violence
No one ever see it coming but I did
Sick of these pussy-walking, pillow talking bitches eating at my table
Fuck out of my line
I need mine, bitch

I've had one too many fuckin bad days
I got no friends running in the rat race
Took the red pill now I got a headcase
Killed the old me and left that body cold case
Cut the dead weight got me feeling lighter now
No one saved me but I'm feeling better now
It's a good day to die and my hands are steady
Got the reaper on my line, bitch come and get it
