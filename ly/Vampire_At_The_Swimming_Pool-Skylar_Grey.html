		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Should I stay or should I leave?
No one is talkin' to me
Head to toe, covered in lace
Sittin' quiet in the shade
Fighting some internal rage
Like a lion in a cage

Like a vampire at the swimming pool in the summertime
Like a vampire at the swimming pool tryin' to hide
I don't know why I even came, I just feel so out of place
Like a vampire at the swimming pool in the summertime

Skin so fair, it's nearly blue
For every shot you're taking, I'm taking two
Feelin' awkward, feelin' strange
I was born against the grain
Never know quite what to say
All I do is pray for rain

Like a vampire at the swimming pool in the summertime
Like a vampire at the swimming pool tryin' to hide
I don't know why I even came, I just feel so out of place
Like a vampire at the swimming pool in the summertime

Like a vampire at the swimming pool in the summertime
Like a vampire at the swimming pool tryin' to hide
I don't know why I even came, I just feel so out of place
Like a vampire at the swimming pool in the summertime
