		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't like to wait too long, to wait too long, wait too long
Bring it out and bring it strong, bring it, baby
I feel the pain and it feels good, I know it would
Your heart burns slow, I feel the pain and I cry out, I cry out

I need you, I need you
Babe, oh I want to drink you in
Like oxygen, like oxygen

Baby, I'm a house on fire
And I want to keep burning
Boy, I'm going up in flames
And you're to blame
Yeah, you're to blame
Baby, I'm a house on fire
And I want to keep burning
I wanna keep burning
I wanna keep burning
I wanna keep burning
Baby, I'm a house on fire
I wanna keep burning
I wanna keep burning
I wanna keep burning
Baby, I'm a house on fire

So take me to the heavens now
As we burn down, as we are found
Take me to the heavens now
My heart screams out

I need you, I need you
Babe, oh I want to drink you in
Like oxygen, like oxygen

Baby, I'm a house on fire
And I want to keep burning
Boy, I'm going up in flames
And you're to blame
Yeah, you're to blame
Baby, I'm a house on fire
And I want to keep burning
I wanna keep burning
I wanna keep burning
I wanna keep burning
Baby, I'm a house on fire
I wanna keep burning
I wanna keep burning
I wanna keep burning
Baby, I'm a house on fire

Love me, to the beat of a drum, to the beat of a drum, yeah
Love me, till the walls give in, yeah
Love me, to the beat of a drum, to the beat of a drum, yeah
Love me, I don't wanna say, babe

Babe, oh I want to drink you in
Like oxygen, like oxygen

Baby, I'm a house on fire
And I wanna keep burning
Boy, I'm going up in flames
And you're to blame
Yeah, you're to blame
Baby, I'm a house on fire
And I want to keep burning
I wanna keep burning
I wanna keep burning
I wanna keep burning
Baby, I'm a house on fire
I wanna keep burning
I wanna keep burning
I wanna keep burning
Baby, I'm a house on fire
Baby, I'm a house on fire
