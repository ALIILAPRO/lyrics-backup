		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Come to me know

I want to be your best friend for all of time
I want to be the tissue for your tears
I never want to be alone
I never really thought that I could feel
A feeling that awakened me so
I was astray of knowing where I belong
Living out of time, living out of time

[Chorus]
Now that you've come and set me free
Now that I know what love can be
All that I want is you with me
That's all I want

You allow me to be what I want to be
Thanks for helping me
I feel like a bright shining star
For only you to see, for only you to see

[Chorus]

Hold me tight, hold me tight
I won't let you go
Close to you, close to you
Touch me, don't let go
Give me all your love
Close to you, close to you
Give me all your love
All that I want
Is you to be with me
