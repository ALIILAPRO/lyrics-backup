		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Pulling out garages, broads, and credit cards
Dodging all charges, clout chasers, and frauds
We are not the same, I am a Martian, Marvin
Bitches like, "Ayy, let's get it on"
Let's get it on, ow baby
Coca
Let's get it

Joe Crack been slipping the feds since the 80's
Moving that white boy, yeah, that's Slim Shady
Pushing that D like Terry Flannery
Uncle Drew with the rock, they couldn't handle me
You niggas buying Dapper Dan out the Gucci store
I was in Harlem dripping dap, serving Pookie raw
Cold case unit want smoke, they tryna find leakers
Only cold case I know holding time pieces
Now that's a milli on a wrist
The only chains that matter is the rock piece and this
TS logo diamonds dripping on the Fashion Nova
They like, "Fuck, these niggas ain't gong never be over"

Pulling out garages, broads, and credit cards
Dodging all charges, clout chasers, and frauds
We are not the same, I am a Martian, Marvin
Bitches like "Ayy, let's get it on"
Let's get it on, ow baby
Woo, this is, yeah
Let's get it

Look, I'm still bumping Mike Jack Thriller (still)
I put that on the gang and the man in my mirror (talk to 'em)
I would never land of the side of foul niggas
Where I'm from if they think that you ratting they might kill ya
Rappers do time, come home, then sound different
When them feds be them niggas ghostwriting they life sentence
It's D-R-E, I fuck models and roll with mobsters
And I cook up beats like the Doc that's straight outta Compton, nig

Pulling out garages, broads, and credit cards
Crushing bottle bitches, divas, and ghetto stars
We are not the same, I am a Martian, Marvin
Bitches like, "Ayy, let's get it on"
Let's get it on, ow baby
Let's get it on
Let's love, baby
Let's get it

I'm with several incredible bitches 
That's ready to do what I tell 'em to 
And that includes even beheading you
I never knew how much you never knew of what you never knew
I'm from the jungle not the petting zoo and you look edible
Silencer on the Glock, 'cause I'm just tryna hold the noise
You can hear a pin drop without hearing the bowling balls
And the truth is hard to swallow, but not for my ho at all
Oh my gosh, she bought me flowers, I'm about to smoke 'em all (woo)
Never had a white girl fetish, like my bitch kinda reddish
With that white girl credit
White sand by the kilo like a white pearl desert
Y-M T-S's all white pearl letters, motherfucka

Pulling out garages, broads, and credit cards
Dodging all charges, clout chasers, and frauds
We are not the same, I am a Martian, Marvin
Bitches like, "Ayy, let's get it on"
