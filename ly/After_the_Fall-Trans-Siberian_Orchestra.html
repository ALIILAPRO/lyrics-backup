		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Time
Only time
Could never take me away from you

And why
Should it try
Time never cares just what we do

It just sits on a star
And gazes down
Dropping its moments all around
And if I could wish upon that star
I would find what you dream
And then ask god to grant it

I wanted
To say this
Long before this dark would fall
At night I
Would pray this
Then wonder if god heard at all
For the chances I've had are now long gone
And that star is no longer wished upon
For on this night it seems too far away

Try
I have tried
To pretend that I don't care
But then
Sleep arrives
And in every dream I find you there

But I don't want the past to be my life
And I don't want to live inside the night
But I don't want to see your shadow fade
So I sleep and I dream
Though I don't understand it

I wanted
To say this
Long before this dark would fall
At night I
Would pray this

Then wonder if god heard at all
For the chances I've had are now long gone
And that star is no longer wished upon
For on this night it seems too far away

You can live your life in a thousand ways
But it all comes down to that single day
When you realize what you regret
What you can't reclaim but you can't forget

If I could just fall back into my life
And find you there inside this night
And let eternity just drift away
