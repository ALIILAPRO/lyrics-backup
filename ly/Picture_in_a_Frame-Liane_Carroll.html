		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The sun come up
It was blue and cold
Sun come up
It was blue and cold

Sun come up
It was blue and cold
Ever since I put your picture 
In a frame

I come call him
In my Sunday best
I come call him
In my Sunday best

I come call him
In my Sunday best
Ever since I put your picture 
In a frame

I'm gonna love you
Till the wheels fall off
oh yeah
oohhhh

I'm gonna love you
And until the wheels fall off
oh yeah
oh yeah

I love you baby
And I always will
I love you baby
And I always will

I love you baby
And I always will
Ever since I put your picture
In a frame

I love you baby
And I always will
Ever since I put your picture
In a frame
