		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Woo, oh girl 

Blame it on the rain (yeah, yeah)
Blame it on the stars (woo)

You said you didn't need her
You told her goodbye (goodbye)
You sacrificed a good love
To satisfy your pride
Now you wished that you still had her (had her)
And you feel like such a fool
You let her walk away
Now it just don't feel the same
Gotta blame it on something (gotta blame it on something)
Gotta blame it on something

Blame it on the rain that was falling, falling
Blame it on the stars that didn't shine that night
Whatever you do, don't put the blame on you
Blame it on the rain, yeah, yeah
You can blame it on the rain

Should've told her you were sorry (sorry) huh
Could have said you were wrong
But no, you couldn't do that, no, no
You had to prove you were strong, ooh
If you hadn't been so blinded (blinded)
She might still be there with you
You want her back again
But she just don't feel the same
Gotta blame it on something (gotta blame it on something)
Gotta blame it on something

Blame it on the rain that was falling, falling
Blame it on the stars that didn't shine that night
Whatever you do, don't put the blame on you
Blame it on the rain, yeah, yeah

Come on and blame it on the rain
'Cause the rain won't mind
And the rain don't care
You got to blame it on something
(Blame it on the rain, yeah, yeah)
(Blame it on the rain, yeah, yeah)
(Blame it on the rain, yeah, yeah)
You can blame it on the rain, blame it on the rain, blame it on the rain, baby
Blame it on the stars that didn't shine that night
Blame it, blame it on the rain, woo

(I can't, I can't, I can't, can't stand the rain)
(I can't, I can't, I can't, can't stand the rain)
Yeah, yeah

Blame it on the rain that was falling, falling
Blame it on the stars that didn't shine that night
Whatever you do, don't put the blame on you
Blame it on the rain, yeah, yeah
Blame it on the rain, woo
