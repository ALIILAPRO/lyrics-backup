		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  He's a very online guy
He likes to hit reply
He's incredibly vigilant
Hair with the feathered wings
He likes to pull the strings
It's incredibly visible

We all know everything that he says and does
Leave your location on and just follow the buzz

He's only one filter away
He's only one follow, one filter away

He's a very online guy
He types his cool replies
He's incredibly animal
Front of the wedding trains
He laps up all domains
And he loves a patio

He's only one flicker away
He's only one photo, one filter away

Like a thinning wave, what was it supposed to be?
Truth is I'm afraid of sudden change
But when you're close to me, does anyone notice?
Life disintegrates, what was it supposed to be?
Truth is I'm afraid to turn away
But when you're ghosting me, does anyone notice?

He's only one follow away
He's only one follow, one filter away
He's only one follow, one filter, one follow away

He's a very online guy
