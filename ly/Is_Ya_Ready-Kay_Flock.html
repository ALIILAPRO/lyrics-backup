		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (War's too nasty) grrah, grrah-grrah
Yo, turn that shit up (grrah-grrah)
Grrt, baow, baow, baow, baow (like)
Like, every opp shot, nigga (everything dead)
Grrt, baow, baow, baow, baow (smokin' all deads, nigga)
Suck my dick (grrah-grrah-grrah)

Don't run, don't trip (like)
Don't run, don't trip (like)
Dubski

Go ask my opps, it get ugly
I could do (shh) like Ice did to Sonny (like)
Think I'm lacking? That nigga a dummy (a dummy)
He think I'm a rapper, he think this shit funny (like, okay)
Okay, dump both ways (like)
Flip through the fours while I'm yelling out "Dubski"
Don't-don't run, don't-don't trip (don't trip)
They know my body, Mr. Throw More Than Six (like)
On a Revel, or a Lyft
Hop-out gang I bought him and his bitch (him and his bitch)

F-F-Fuck it I'm in fashion, I bet I'll still up it (pussy)
He the fastest, don't know where I'm running (don't run)
Fuck it, back out put the beat on in public (like)
Grrah, grrah, grrah, keep dumping (keep dumping)
Edot Baby, that kid ain't on nothing (baow, baow)
On JayRip, got most of 'em ducking (baow-baow-baow)
Grrah, grrah, nigga stop putting names in your song
You alright? Something is wrong
Bent up my block, show me you perform (boom-bbom-boom, pussy)

They can't wait 'til they catch 'em a what? (Like)
Okay, let's get it on (let's get it on)
EBK, bitch, I'm feeling like Melly (like)
He get shot if he tote in the deli (grrah-grrah)
Make it sexy (sexy)
Bitches get shot, it get heavy (grrah-grrah, baow)
Like with Nesty
My .45 hold 6, throwing deadies (like grrah-grrah)
Wit' his bestie, in the ground EBK, he with Mexi (grrah-grrah, Mexi)
And free Freddy, miss the opp, better pop like confetti (grrah-grrah)
Is you ready? We gon' bend through that block, leave it messy
(Is you ready? We gon' bend through that block, leave it messy)

Bitch, I'm a stomper, I don't really step (I don't do the step)
Nigga I'm a vet' (better watch ya' step)
Better come correct
I'm a demon, so watch who you check (grrt, baow)
Always lit, say less
I done slept wit' a Nine Trey, pound 'em with TEC (baow-baow-baow-baow)
See a opp, fuckin' duh I'ma wreck
Catch an LV put him on his neck (LVK)

Grrah, grrah, grrah-grrah, boom
Grrah, grrah-grrah, boom
