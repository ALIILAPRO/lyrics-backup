		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Slit my own wrist, bitch, I been killin' shit
Bitch, pick up ash off the
Blunt when it spill i ain't paying for shit
I got three hunnid pills
Palm full of pills, I might die any day
Hope I die with no will
There's a way to escape
It's called digging your grave
I don't chill with nobody
Or meet face-to-face
I'm just waitin' in here until I
Can creep outta my cave
Don't try and save what cannot be saved
I cannot be saved
'cause I am a slave to my own mistakes
I hope I fade away like a
Memory fades in my brain
Pray that I slay all the prey
Blade that drains my fucking veins
Satan, please save me today
I break away, now I've escaped

Slumped up off my habit's
Wit' two full metal jackets
I'm that Slenderman up in yo' closet
Panic when you think about it
That grey haired thuggin' lil' shawty
Paranoid, can't be too cautious
Roll up, finna blow on this dope
Could be heron, could be smoke
Either way, I'm gonna blow
Numb 'till I can't feel no more
RIP to the one they call $lick
D-IE when you fuck with the clique
Pull up quick with the sticks, empty clips
Then I dip with your bitch
Made her suck dick
She was shit, I got pissed so I didn't hit
Just hit a lick
Hit the whip and then I dipped swift
