		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Someday we'll be together
Say it, say it again
Someday we'll be together
You're far away from me my love, and just as sure my
My baby as there are stars above
I wanna say, I wanna say, I wanna say some day we'll be together
Yes we will, yes we will say some day we'll be together
Someday day, some sweet day we will be together
I know, I know, I know, I know

My love is yours, baby
Oh, right from the start
You, you, you possess my soul now honey
And I know, I know you won my heart
And I wanna say someday (some sweet day) we'll be together
Ah, yes we will, yes we will
Someday we'll be together, tell everybody now
Ah, yes we will, yes we will
Long time ago my, my sweet thing, I made a big mistake, honey
I say, I said goodbye
Oh, oh baby ever ever, ever, never, never since that day now
Now all I, all I wanna do ah is cry, cry, cry, cry
Oh hey, hey, hey
I long for you, every night
Just to kiss your sweet, sweet lips
Hold you ever so tight and I wanna say
Someday we'll be together
Oh, yes we will, yes we will
Someday we'll be together
Oh, yes we will, yes we will
Someday we'll be together
Ah, honey, honey
Some day we'll be together
Yes we will, yes we will
