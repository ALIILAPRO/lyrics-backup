		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Told you once about your friends and neighbors
They were always seeking but they'll never find it
It's alright, yes it's alright

Where to go and where to see
It's always been this way and it can never be
It's alright, yes it's alright

Give it all and ask no return
And very soon you'll see and you'll begin to learn
That's it's alright, yes it's alright

Uh uh uh 
Uh uh uh
It's alright, it's alright

Don't you know that it's so good for you
You can be making love and see it all go through
But it's alright, yes it's alright

Told you once about your friends and neighbors
They were always seeking but they'll never find it
It's alright, yes it's alright

Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Uh uh uh
Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright
