		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What a strange twist of fate
That this long night should end
With me finally meeting
With the other man
Yeah, you have heard about me
The guy who came before
And I'd give all I have
For one last chance with her
But I know it's too late now
Just remember that she loves
The long walks under the rain
Staying in bed on Sunday mornings
Taking pictures from a train
And she loves to watch old movies
Until late into the night
But most of all just make her laugh
Cause God knows that I made her cry
Oh I miss you so much
At least I really did
But I'm feeling better
And happy now with him
And one day I just hope
We can meet once again
To simply chat in the street
Like a couple of old friends
But for now, I remember
I remember how we loved
The long walks under the rain
Staying in bed on Sunday mornings
Taking pictures from a train
And we loved to watch old movies
Until late into the night
But most of all you made me laugh
Cause God knows that I made you cry
God knows that I made her cry
