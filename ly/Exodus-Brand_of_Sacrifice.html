		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This terror flows through my veins
I'm hated by the world I betrayed
Lost everything
But night after night I'm reminded
Of the time that he held you in his clutches
No I won't look away, for I must struggle on

You won't let go of the thing you love the most
We believed in you
We lived in a culture of deception
So raise your banner higher
Now you're a walking corpse
Pile up all the bodies
This dream was meant for one
Meant for one

When will you see there's a difference?
It is a simple one
I see the truth upon your face
No, I won't look away

I see the truth upon your face
I fear it but I can't look away
No time will ever heal this pain
Burning alive from the fire inside me

It is in your nature
To call yourself the savior
You are not my king
When I'm done with you
Your name won't mean a thing
Your judgment is certain
Your time will come
(You cannot plead any case)

Slit your throat and carve your face out

Carve your face out
Your name won't mean a thing
Your name won't mean a thing

I see the truth upon your face
I fear it but I won't look away
No time will ever heal this pain
Burning alive, from the fire inside me
(I am burning alive tonight)
Burning alive from the fire inside me
(I can't recognize what's right)
Burning alive from the fire inside me

Your ambition will crumble
Isn't this the end of the insatiable?
(Now)
This is the end
This is the end of your dream

You will not wake up
You will not fulfill your destiny
From the demon's highest
Now the one who's below my feet
Now the one who's below my feet

I see the truth upon your face
I fear it but I won't look away
No time will ever heal this pain
Burning alive from the fire inside me
(I am burning alive tonight)
Burning alive from the fire inside me
(I can't recognize what's right)
Burning alive from the fire inside me

Carve your face out
Your name won't mean a thing
Carve your face out
Your name won't mean a thing
