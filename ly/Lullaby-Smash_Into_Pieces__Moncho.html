		  Lullaby

I'm gonna sing you a LULLABY 
From when I was young, young like you
Let this sweet little rockabye 
Rock your world tonight you're the special kind

While the stars shine bright and we say good night I'll be by your side sing a lullaby
I kiss your cheek and you fall asleep to this melody (melody) with this lullaby


Lulla, lullaby lullaby lullaby
Rockabye keep your dreams alive
Lulla, lullaby lullaby lullaby
I'm by your side baby don't you cry, cry no


My mama told me that she could see 
The power that's within me from when I was young
Now I know what she talked about 
You're like me I clearly see born to be free

While the stars shine bright and we say good night I'll be by your side sing a lullaby
I kiss your cheek and you fall asleep to this melody (melody) with this lullaby


Lulla, lullaby lullaby lullaby
Rockabye keep your dreams alive
Lulla, lullaby lullaby lullaby
I'm by your side baby don't you cry cry


I remember when dad used to say handle the pain 
Nothing comes easy we have to be brave
Singing a lullaby when I had been afraid talking 'bout back in the days
Lived in the project with the problems that we faced like animal trapped in a cage
But time can change now I be traveling from place to place 
Live on stage night and day life is strange
So this is my way to repay


With this lullaby
Lulla, lullaby lullaby lullaby
Rockabye keep your dreams alive
Lulla, lullaby lullaby lullaby
I'm by your side baby don't you cry ,cry no
