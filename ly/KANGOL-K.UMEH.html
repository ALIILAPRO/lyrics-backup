		  She does wafi' get him
Pop one yeah she might pop two

Looking the whole sound
Part two on the ocean
Universe moving to me
Already wondering what KOU can be
I'm running Mason, I pulled a Mason (Umehzing)
Back in the flow, I'm getting a hair cut
Send me to two sides, the moonshine
Apple face time looking great now this our life
We gone have to muscle the Nkita It's a dog fight
And I'm finna ride low baby
And it's in my hands
Yippee Kai Love Back Baby
And If you have to hold down we don't care that means you care
And If your'e still fighting for your limitations you'll have to keep them
And If you don't say that shh for the rest of the day I might believe you
Nelson Mandalay Bay, and we looking at the creator

She does wafi' get him
Pop one yeah she might pop two
Let me put it in ya
If the two girl you know I'm coming through
Shawty I'm get raw
Alright
Girl you know what I'm tryna do
I aint got all night
Ima show you what this boy can do, do, do
I'm a show you what this money kangol o o
I'm a show you what this money kangol o o
I'm a show you what this money kangol o o
Let me show you what this money Ken O
