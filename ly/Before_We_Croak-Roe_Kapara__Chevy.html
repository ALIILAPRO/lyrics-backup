		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Piss in the shower, got some on my feet
You hog the water while we're cleaning our meat
We fill our bodies with lactose and bread
So we got pimples on our backs and our neck
And you say that I snore way too loudly
Goodnight kiss, I love feeling your mouthpiece
And I hope we get fifty more years or so
Before we croak

So if the sun explodes tonight
Just know that I'll hold you 'til we die
And if the planets all collide
Then I'll be happy we had this life
'Cause I'd be next to you
You

I'll tell you all of my darkest secrets
You untangle all the knots in my head
You unfold me like a wrapped up blanket
And throw me over onto the bed
With you so close it feels like home
But I don't know how far we'll go
I hope there's fifty more years or so
Before we have to croak

So if the sun explodes tonight
Just know that I'll hold you 'til we die
And if the planets all collide
Then I'll be happy we had this life
'Cause I'd be next to you
You
You
You
