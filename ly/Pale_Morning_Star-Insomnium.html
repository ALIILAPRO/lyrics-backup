		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Long is the trail of the day
Into the lap of the evening dusk
Sweetest the hour of sleep
For I am weary of sorrow and pain
Into the tender night I now lapse
Into the slumber so sound and deep
Arching over the ravines of time (Time, time)
Bridge into the shrouded land

For, for you left before me
My, my pale morning star
Now, now you walk in undying light
And I'm, I'm still chained in this rimed soil

When twilight reaves my senses
The heavenly ones will linger here
Right here by my feverish side
The ghosts of those I loved
Gone is the cruelest longing now (Now)
Undone this grief of mine

For, for you left before me
My, my pale morning star
Now, now you walk in undying light
And I'm, I'm still chained in this rimed soil

And still I can sense you
Still I can hear your voice
Still I quiver under your touch
Celestial shine in your hair
Empyreal crown upon your brow
Radiance blurs my teary eyes

Broken is the sphere of the body
As the spirit will ascend

Broken is the sphere of the body
As the spirit will ascend
Over the infinite boundaries
Over the gulches of death

Once you carried me from the
Night into the sun (Sun)
And now I follow your steps
Into the unseen land
Sore are these weary eyes when
I pass into the light
Blinding the eternal glow after the
Long path in the dark
Wide awake amidst the dream
I stand by your side
I tremble before your gleam
My pale morning star

I stand by your side my pale morning star
