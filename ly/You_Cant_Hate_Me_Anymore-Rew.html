		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm not mysterious yet
Open my coffin and share
I want you always
I want you always
I went through terrible things, sure
I have no memory of where
Every time it makes me scared
Every time it makes me scared
I walked alone in my head
Repeating words that you said
You cant hate me anymore
You ever know that
I'm gonna change i swear
Kiss me like you care
Cry into your shoulder while you're clinging to my hair
Clearly, I'm seeing things
That aren't there
That aren't there
I walked alone in my head
Repeating words that you said
You can't hate me anymore
You can't hate me
There's something wrong with me
I'm bringing it up I've been a lonely one
Couldn't you tell?
They want your head and your heart
That's up to you
It's not an easy way out
It's hard to do
You bring me to tears yeah
Underneath the stairs
Take something so I can socialize and try to care
You can't hate me anymore
You can't hate me anymore
You can't hate me anymore
You can't hate me anymore
There's something wrong with me
I'm bringing it up I've been a lonely one
Couldn't you tell?
They want your head and your heart
That's up to you
It's not an easy way out
It's hard to do
I'm gonna change i swear
Kiss me like you care
Cry into your shoulder while you're clinging to my hair
Clearly, I'm seeing things
That aren't there
That aren't there
