		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, it's getting late have you seen my mates

Ma tell me when the boys get here

Oh, it's seven o'clock and I want to rock

Want to get a belly full of beer

My old man's drunker than a barrel full of monkeys

My old lady she don't care

My sister looks cute in her braces and boots

A handful of grease in her hair

Oh, don't give us none of your aggravation

We had it with your discipline

Saturday night's alright for fighting

Get a little action in

Get about as oiled as a diesel train

Gonna set this dance alight

Saturday night's the night I like

Saturday night's alright, alright, alright, ooh

Oh, well, packed pretty tight in here tonight

I'm looking for a dolly who'll see me right

I may use a little muscle to get what I need

I may sink a little drink and shout out, "She's with me"

A couple of the sound that I really like

Are the sounds of a switchblade and a motorbike

I'm a juvenile product of the working class

Whose best friend floats in the bottom of a glass

Oh, don't give us none of your aggravation

We had it with your discipline

Saturday night's alright for fighting

Get a little action in

Get about as oiled as a diesel train

Gonna set this dance alight

Saturday night's the night I like

Saturday night's alright, alright, alright, ooh

Oh, don't give us none of your aggravation

We had it with your discipline

Saturday night's alright for fighting

Get a little action in

Get about as oiled as a diesel train

Gonna set this dance alight

Oh, Saturday night's the night I like

Saturday night's alright, alright, alright, ooh

Saturday, Saturday, Saturday, Saturday, Saturday, Saturday

Saturday, Saturday, Saturday night's alright

Saturday, Saturday, Saturday, Saturday, Saturday, Saturday

Saturday, Saturday, Saturday night's alright

Saturday, oh, Saturday night's alright

Saturday, Saturday, Saturday, Saturday, Saturday, Saturday

Saturday, Saturday, Saturday night's alright

Saturday, Saturday, Saturday, Saturday, Saturday, Saturday

Saturday, Saturday, Saturday night's alright

Saturday, Saturday, Saturday, Saturday, Saturday, Saturday

Saturday, Saturday, Saturday night's alright

Saturday, Saturday, Saturday, Saturday, Saturday, Saturday

Saturday, Saturday, Saturday night's alright

Saturday, Saturday, Saturday, Saturday, Saturday, Saturday

Saturday, Saturday, Saturday night's alright

Saturday, Saturday, Saturday, Saturday, Saturday, Saturday

Saturday, Saturday, Saturday night's alright

Oh yeah, yeah, yeah

Saturday, Saturday, Saturday, Saturday, Saturday, Saturday

Saturday, Saturday, Saturday night's alright

Saturday, Saturday, Saturday, Saturday, Saturday, Saturday

Saturday, Saturday, Saturday night's alright
