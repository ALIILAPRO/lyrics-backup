		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I play dead
So that the monsters in my head
Think that they've done their best
And they can take a rest
I think that I just might have played this part too well
I'm not feeling myself
And I'm wondering where I fell
Off the wagon
I'm dragging
Mud and used to love up to my attic
There's static
Where I used to be ecstatic
You can call
You can call me dramatic
But I got this nasty habit
I'm living everyday like it's doomsday
Even if it's just another Tuesday
The internet is telling me
That it's depression
Yeah it's my obsession
Never learn my lesson
Cause I'm living everyday like it's doomsday
Like it's doomsday
I'm an egomaniac
On the self attack
Whatcha looking at
It's like you never seen anyone having a quarter life crisis
I might be biased
On the scale of self destructive tendencies I think I score the highest
Why is
Everything good in my life
Overshadowed by a sinking feeling that
Everything is gonna go to shit
And it's the best it's gonna get
I just want to be the kid who thought that the
World was filled with possibilities
And not so many responsibilities
And my world is falling into entropy
Could someone please just give me the keys
So I can see the world through a different screen
Cause the one I got's not the one I need
And you could call it a modern tragedy
I'm living everyday like it's doomsday
Even if it's just another Tuesday
The internet is telling me
That it's depression
Yeah it's my obsession
Never learn my lesson
Cause I'm living everyday like it's doomsday
Like it's doomsday
I play dead
So that the monsters in my head
Think that they've done their best
And they can take a rest
I think that I just might have played this part too well
I'm not feeling myself
And I'm wondering where I fell
Off the wagon
I'm dragging
Mud and used to love up to my attic
There's static
Where I used to be ecstatic
You can call
You can call me dramatic
But I got this nasty habit
I'm living everyday like it's doomsday
Even if it's just another Tuesday
The internet is telling me
That it's depression
Yeah it's my obsession
Never learn my lesson
Cause I'm living everyday like it's doomsday
Like it's doomsday
Doomsday
Doomsday
Doomsday
Doomsday
Doomsday
Doomsday
Doomsday
Doomsday
