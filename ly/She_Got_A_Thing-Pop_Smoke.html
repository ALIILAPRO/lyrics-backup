		  Uh, woo
(Oh, oh)

Fuck it up (AXL, fuck it up), stick it out (stick it out)
Throw it back (throw it back), for these racks (for these rack)
Poke it out (poke it out), stick it out (stick it out)
Throw it back (throw back), for these riches (grrt, bah)
She got a thing for niggas with money
She got a thing for niggas with money (uh, uh)
Poke it out (poke it out), stick it out (stick it out)
Throw it back (throw back)

I got the baddest bitch out of the city
She got my name on top of her titty
I do my dance when I get jiggy
I do my dance, I feel like I'm Shiggy
Hit the pole, do a trick
Climb on top, do a split
She wanna do it on my dick
Sit on my Amiris, told her look out for the stick
Baby, lemme, see some, okay
Two bad, bitches, goin', both ways
She gon' do it for these bands
She make it clap like how I do both of my hands

Fuck it up (fuck it up), stick it out (stick it out)
Throw it back (throw it back), for these racks (for these rack)
Poke it out (poke it out), stick it out (stick it out)
Throw it back (throw back), for these riches (grrt, bah)
She got a thing for niggas with money
She got a thing for niggas with money (uh, uh)
Poke it out (poke it out), stick it out (stick it out)
Throw it back (throw back)
