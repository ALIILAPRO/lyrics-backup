		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm in serious, I feel totally lost
If I'm asking for help, it's only because
Being with you has opened my eyes
Could I ever believe such a perfect surprise?
I keep askin' myself, wonderin' how
I keep closin' my eyes, but I can't block you out
Wanna fly to a place where it's just you and me
Nobody else, so we can be free
(Nobody else, so we can be free)

All the things she said, all the things she said
Runnin' through my head, runnin' through my head
Runnin' through my head
All the things she said, all the things she said
Runnin' through my head, runnin' through my head
All the things she said
This is not enough (all the things she said, all the things she said)
This is not enough (all the things she said, all the things she said)

And I'm all mixed up, feeling cornered and rushed
They say it's my fault, but I want her so much
Wanna fly her away where the sun and the rain
Come in over my face, wash away all the shame
When they stop and stare, don't worry me
'Cause I'm feelin' for her what she's feelin' for me
I can try to pretend, I can try to forget
But it's drivin' me mad, goin' out of my head

All the things she said, all the things she said
Runnin' through my head, runnin' through my head
Runnin' through my head
All the things she said, all the things she said
Runnin' through my head, runnin' through my head
All the things she said
This is not enough (all the things she said, all the things she said)
This is not enough (all the things she said, all the things she said)

All the things she said, all the things she said
All the things she said, all the things she said (all the things she)
All the things she said, all the things she said
All the things she said, all the things she said (all the things she)
