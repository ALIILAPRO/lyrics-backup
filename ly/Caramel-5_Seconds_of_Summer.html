		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Under the East, gotta leave, I need a way out
Lookin' at me, colorin' all of the lines now
You only break when you take the bend too far
Don't like it fake, I relate, I think it's true love

It's been a while since you and I been where we started
I don't wanna let it fade away

It used to be easy
Now you can't even look me in the eye
A visceral feeling
That I can never leave behind
And it's under my skin, but I can't reach it
When you know where I've been, so we play pretend
It used to be easy
It used to be easy

I know it well, caramel, I feel the comedown 
(Feel the comedown) Yeah
We've been to hell, I can tell, we're slowin' down now
Ooh, you bring up the past, didn't ask, give me the know-how
(I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry)
So we make it last, 'nother glass, until we come 'round

It's been a while since you and I been where we started
I don't wanna let it fade away

It used to be easy
Now you can't even look me in the eye
A visceral feeling
That I can never leave behind
And it's under my skin, but I can't reach it
When you know where I've been, so we play pretend
It used to be easy
It used to be easy

Love like a landslide, I kiss you goodnight
Love like a landslide, I kiss you goodnight
It used to be easy
