		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do you really wanna hurt me?
Do you really wanna make me cry?
Precious kisses, words that burn me 
Lovers never ask you why

In my heart the fire is burning
Choose my color, find a star
Precious people always tell me
That's a step, a step too far

If it's love you want from me
Then take it away
Everything's not what you see
It's over again

Do you really wanna hurt me?
Do you really wanna make me cry?
Precious kisses, words that burn me 
Lovers never ask you why

You've been talking but believe me
If it's true you do not know
This boy loves without a reason
I'm prepared to let you go

If it's love you want from me
Then take it away
Everything's not what you see
It's over again

Give me time to realize my crime 
Let me love and steal
I have danced inside your eyes 
How can I be real?
How can I be real?

How can I be real?

Do you really wanna hurt me?
Do you really wanna make me cry?
Do you really wanna hurt me?
Do you really wanna make me cry?

Do you really wanna hurt me?
Do you really wanna make me cry?
Do you really wanna hurt me?
Do you really wanna make me cry?
