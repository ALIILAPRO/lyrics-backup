		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Get in, loser, we're going home
You want me to scream out the window?
I fucking like you, you already know
Get in, loser, we're going home

I made a wish and I crossed my heart
Sent a drunk text on a shooting star
You're playing hard to get
And these games aren't working for me, working for me
Said you're at a rave with the boys in the band
Wishin' I could come, I could wreck your plans
I'm on the West side, I could be there
Right before two, I can save you

Let's G-T-F-O

Get in, loser, we're going home
You want me to scream out the window?
I fucking like you, you already know
Get in, loser, we're going home
We're going home

You're in the front seat, you plug in your phone
A unknown number says "Where did you go?"
So I kick you out on 2nd Avenue
But you know I can't stay mad at you

Let's G-T-F-O

Get in, loser, we're going home
You want me to scream out the window?
I fucking like you, you already know
Get in, loser, we're going

Red lights, your hands slippin' under my clothes
So hot, we're foggin' up the window
Mini-skirt and I couldn't look cuter, yeah
So get in, loser

Get in, loser
