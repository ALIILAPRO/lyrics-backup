		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh, uh uh uh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I know you gave me your heart
How did I mess that
Another day, lay in the dark
I need to check that, uh
Gave me it all,  I can't express back
Looking way into the stars
 I need to get back
Another thing that bring me afar
Would be a setback
Or why I stay with a spark
A little head crack
It sucks that things remain where they are
I couldn't trespass my escape in the yard
Or where to flex at the cut
But I ain't staying too far
From where the nets at
Struggle, we bе paying it large
And getting less pack
I know my grеatest applause is in the end act
I lust for the day's resolve
My chest snatched
From hugs that will fade into fogs
My best chance to touch just
Away 'til I'm gone
Attest that for once, he be saying I'm wrong
Sent fast a clutch little prayer, I'm strong
Resent passed for months
I'm just playing along until it get bad
I'm stuck at the head of the storm
Intense draft
And cuts that you get from the war
