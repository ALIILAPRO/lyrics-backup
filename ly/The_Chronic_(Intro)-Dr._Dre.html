		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is dedicated to the niggas that was down from day one
Welcome to Death Row
Like we always do about this time

Hahaha, yeah, nine-deuce
Death Row Records
Creepin' while you're sleepin'
Niggas with attitudes? Naw, loc
Niggas on a motherfuckin' mission
What up niggas and niggaettes?
That crazy-ass nigga's back in the motherfuckin' hizzouse
The notorious Compton G
D.R.E., on the solo tip, fuck them other fools
What up, Ren? Yeah
Droppin' chronic flakes on your ass, biatch
West Coast flavor
Niggas who talk shit get dealt with real quick
So if you wanna take a trip to the Row
Let a nigga like Snoop Doggy Dogg know
Protected by niggas with big dicks, AK's, and 187 skills
So if it's a must you test us
We can handle it in the streets, nigga
Fuck makin' records, yeah
G's up, hoes down
If that bitch can't swim then she bound the drizzown
Peace to my nigga Drizzae
Another platinum hit, nigga
Peace to the D.O.C., still makin' it funky enough
And Death Row Records is in full motherfuckin' effizzect
Oh yeah, PS, fuck Mr. Roarke and Tattoo
AKA Jerry and Eazy
Sincerely yours, these motherfuckin' nuts
I don't love Eazy, I don't love Jerry
I don't love Ruthless Records
Frankly, I don't love nothin' they got to do with
But, but, but you know what I want you the do for me?
Jerry, Eazy, check this shit out here
I want y'all to put these bizzalls, in your jizzaws
And work 'em like a strizzaw
And tell me what you sizzaw
Yeah, you know what? You know what?
Fuck all y'all, fuck y'all
Really though, it's Death Row, nigga
You better ask somebody
You really better ask somebody

(Get out, get out, I don't love you no more)
Yeah, nigga, you's a penguin-lookin' motherfucker
