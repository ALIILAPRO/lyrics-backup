		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lust equals fire when you come to me
Obsession and craving burning inside of me
Pain feeds desire as you cut me deep
Sharpened caresses of debauchery

It runs through my veins and through my heart
assuring that death won't do us part
Then leaving me craving torn apart... I just want you

Rust equals blood and I hear you sigh
"pain will be gone in a blink of an eye"
Fear turns to dust with a blissful cry
Self-pollution's how we cleanse the lie... I just want you

It's useless to tame, so useless to point your fingers and blame
the hunger that's screaming out your name
It's needless to say, I need you inside my heart to stay
All else is cleansed away, all else is hollow anyway
