		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell us where you're from
What you want to become
And we'll say if you're OK
Where did you go to school?
Right answer and you're cool
Yeah, you're the kid the whole day

You get a sticker in your face
Information 'bout the case
So you know your potential
Don't think you can extend
Don't think you can extend, just comprehend

But I don't wanna hear it
No, it's more than I accept

'Cause I don't care where I belong no more
What we share or not I will ignore
I will ignore

We will shut you out
We'll put you in doubt
If you think that you're special
We'll tell you who you are
We'll tell you that you're close but no cigar

But I don't wanna hear it
No, it's more than I accept

'Cause I don't care where I belong no more
What we share or not I will ignore
And I won't waste my time fitting in
'Cause I don't think contrast is a sin

What they say is
Go back where you came from
They'll tell you that, I don't want to hear
No, I don't want to hear
No, I don't want to hear it
No, it's more than I accept

'Cause I don't care where I belong no more
What we share or not I will ignore
And I won't waste my time fitting in
'Cause I don't think contrast is a sin
No, it's not a sin
