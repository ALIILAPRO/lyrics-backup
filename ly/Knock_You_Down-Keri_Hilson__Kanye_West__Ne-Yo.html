		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Keep rocking, and keep knocking
Whether you Louboutin it up or Reebokin'
You see the hate, that they're serving on a platter
So what we goin' have, dessert or disaster

I never thought I'd, be in love like this
When I look at you my mind goes on a trip
Then you came in, and knocked me on my face
Feels like in I'm in a race
But I already won first place

I never thought I'd fall for you as hard as I did
(As hard as I did, yeah)
You got me thinking bout our life our house and kids (yeah)
Every morning I look at you and smile
'Cause boy you came around and you knocked me down, knocked me down

Sometimes love comes around
And it knocks you down
Just get back up
When it knocks you down
Sometimes love comes around
And it knocks you down
Just get back up
When it knocks you down

I never thought I'd
Hear myself say (ooh)
Y'all go ahead
I think I'm gonna kick it wit my girl today (kick it wit my girl today)
I used to be commander and chief
Of my pimp ship flying high (flying high)
'Til I met this pretty little missile that shot me out the sky (oh shot me out the sky)

Hey, now I'm crashing, don't know how it happened
But I know it feels so damn good
Said if I could back, and make it happen faster
Don't you know I would baby if I could
Miss independent (oh, to the fullest), the load never too much
She helping me pull it
She shot the bullet that ended that life
I swear to you the pimp in me just died tonight,
Girl sometimes love

Sometimes love comes around
And it knocks you down
Just get back up
When it knocks you down
Sometimes love comes around
And it knocks you down
Just get back up
When it knocks you down

Tell me now can you make it past your caspers
So we can finally fly off into NASA
You was always the cheerleader of my dreams that
Seem to only date the head of football teams

And I was the class clown that, always kept you laughing
We, were never meant to be baby we just happen
So please, don't mess up the trick, hey young world I'm the new slick rick
They say I move too quick, but we can't let the moment pass us

Let the hourglass pass right into ashes
Let the wind blow the ash right before my glasses
So I wrote this love letter right before my classes
How could a goddess ask, someone that's only average

For advice
OMG, you listen to that bitch?
Whoa it's me
Baby this is tragic
'Cause we had it, we was magic

I was flying, now I'm crashing
This is bad, real bad, Michael Jackson
Now I'm mad, real mad, Joe Jackson
You should leave your boyfriend now, I'm a ask him

Say you gotta put the good with the bad, happy and the sad
So will u bring a better future than I had in the past
Oh 'cause, I don't wanna make the same mistakes I did
I don't wanna fall back on my face again
Whoa, whoa
I'll admit it, I was scared to answer love's call
Whoa, whoa
And if it hits better make it worth the fall

(When it comes around)

Sometimes love comes around
And it knocks you down
Just get back up
When it knocks you down
Sometimes love comes around
And it knocks you down
Just get back up
When it knocks you down

Won't see it coming when it happens (hey)
But when it happens you're gonna feel it, let me tell you now
You see when love knocks you down

Won't see it coming when it happens
But when it happens you're gonna feel it, let me tell you now
You see when love knocks you down
Yeah
