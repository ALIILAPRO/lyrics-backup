		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No matter what you do, it's never enough
I don't understand these bitches, Drizzy
Tryin' to, hear all these niggas, they never say

Time after time after time
Money's all I get and still money on my mind
But I ain't never satisfied
And I ain't never satisfied
I found the one and say, I'll never cheat again
We don't talk for like some months
I ended up fucking with her friend
I ain't never satisfied
I ain't never satisfied

I'm putting pressure on these niggas and I know
But I still be on the road like I'm scared of going broke
'Cause I ain't never satisfied
I ain't never satisfied

I got a lot of money in the room
I gotta find a hotspot hot soon
I mix the ros√© with the purple juice
I hustle everyday and you don't have a clue
How do you get money and all your dreams come true
It's like everything that surround you get brand new
I can't never forget the struggle and I pay dues
Can't let the money and fame come between my crew
My veins still runnin' deeper than the ocean
Ordered up 10,000 ones and I throw it
Name a bag in the store that she ain't got
Name a designer store that we ain't shop
They ain't never satisfied

Time after time after time
Money's all I get and still money on my mind
But I ain't never satisfied
And I ain't never satisfied
I found the one and say, I'll never cheat again
We don't talk for like some months
I ended up fucking with her friend
I ain't never satisfied
