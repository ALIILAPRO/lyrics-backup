		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When you move
Under the moon
I can feel you
Slipping through to tantalize

When you sing
Your words soft and sincere
Oh I want you
More than I ever desired

There are things I don't understand
Deep within my well
Then I wish to unveil myself
When I dance under your midnight prayer

I dance around, around, around, in circles
And I dance around, around, around, in circles

In a dream
Calm, surreal
I can taste you
Feel completely hypnotized

When you speak
The words I long to hear
Oh I want you
More than I ever desired

There are things I don't understand
Deep within my well
Then I wish to unveil myself
When I dance under your midnight prayer

I dance around, around, around, in circles
And I dance around, around, around, in circles
