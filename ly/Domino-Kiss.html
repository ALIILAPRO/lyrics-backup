		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now lemme tell ya my story, I got a man-sized predicament
And it's a big one, goes like this, yeah
My my, ow, yeah!
Never had confession, never had a home
Never had no worry, until I met Domino
Ain't the virgin Mary, love her I confess
Got my hesitations, 'cause she kisses like the kiss of death
Loves lots of money, back's against the wall
Calls me Sugar Daddy, she knows she's got me by the balls
They call her Domino - so fine
Got a reputation, haven't got a hope
It's a sticky situation, if she ain't old enough to vote
Loves to play with fire, loves to hurt so good
Loves to keep me burnin', 'cause she's a bad habit, bad habit
Bad habit that's good, good, good
They call her Domino, Domino, Domino
Every damn time I walk through that door, it's the same damn thing
That bitch bends over, and I forget my name - ow!
Loves lots of money, back's against the wall
Calls me Sugar Daddy, she knows she's got me by the balls - ow!
Loves to play with fire, love her I confess
Got no hesitations, cause she's a bad habit,
Bad habit, she's a bad habit!
Yeah
