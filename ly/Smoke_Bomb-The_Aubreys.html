		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (I'm recording now)

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

We're the same, you and I
We feel like aliens inside
I fly a plane, we get together
Are you feeling any better?

She's getting tired
It's getting late
We're on a pond
With one skate
I look up then, and she's gone
She is magic
She's like a smoke bomb

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh (alright)
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

Remember that one day we went to Howard's?
I wanted to prove that I wasn't a coward
I drove your car up the road
We laughed and yelled
We never told

She's getting tired
It's getting late
We're on a pond
With one skate
I look up then, and she's gone
She is magic
She's like a smoke bomb

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh (whoo)
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

"I'm definitely coming over this week"
"Oh my god, let's do it"
