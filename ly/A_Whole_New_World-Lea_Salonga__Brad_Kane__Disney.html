		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can show you the world
Shining, shimmering, splendid
Tell me, princess, now when did you last let your heart decide?

I can open your eyes
Take you wonder by wonder
Over, sideways and under on a magic carpet ride

A whole new world
A new fantastic point of view
No one to tell us, "no" or where to go
Or say we're only dreaming

A whole new world
A dazzling place I never knew
But when I'm way up here, it's crystal clear
That now I'm in a whole new world with you
(Now I'm in a whole new world with you)

Unbelievable sights
Indescribable feeling
Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling
Through an endless diamond sky

A whole new world (don't you dare close your eyes)
A hundred thousand things to see (hold your breath, it gets better)
I'm like a shooting star, I've come so far
I can't go back to where I used to be (a whole new world)

(Every turn, a surprise)
With new horizons to pursue (every moment, red-letter)
I'll chase them anywhere
There's time to spare
Let me share this whole new world with you

A whole new world (a whole new world)
That's where we'll be (that's where we'll be)
A thrilling chase (a wondrous place)
For you and me
