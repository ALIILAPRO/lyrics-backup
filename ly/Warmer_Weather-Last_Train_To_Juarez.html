		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't live that 9 to 5
I always found some other way to get by
I can't seem to live my life confined
I never was able to stay within those damn lines
Lord I know we met a little too late
But I'm still holdin' on to some hope you'll open those gates
Though I know it's likely not what you'll do
I guess I'm headed for warmer weather when I'm through
I know I ain't been by in some time
I never could get passed those stares and judging eyes
And I get I don't live that righteous life
The things I've done and the life I live
I Guess I'm not the prayin' kind
Lord I know we met a little too late
But I'm still holdin' on to some hope you'll open those gates
Though I know it's likely not what you'll do
I guess I'm headed for warmer weather when I'm through
Lord I know we met a little too late
But I'm still holdin' on to some hope you'll open those gates
Though I know it's likely not what you'll do
I guess I'm headed for warmer weather when I'm through
With the life I live I know I can't blame you
So I'm headed for warmer weather
Yeah I'm headed for warmer weather
Looks like I'm headed for warmer weather when I'm through
