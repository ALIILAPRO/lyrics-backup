		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Nothing new to know about, nothing new to see
What I said is what I said, what's that say about me
Says I couldn't see the signs
With my dim little light
Watching the big stars shine

Show up late, stay up late, wake up late again
Turn me back into the dirt, where everyone's my kin
Six feet below your borderline
With my dim little light
Watching the big stars shine

We might lie and cross the line
We might surrender to the times
We might stare into the void
We might hit the basement floor
We might wonder what it's for
We might wind up overjoyed
Overjoyed

It's raining in the morning, raining all the time
This year was like a waterfall, raining in my mind
Now the writing's on the wall
With our dim little light
Watching the big stars fall
