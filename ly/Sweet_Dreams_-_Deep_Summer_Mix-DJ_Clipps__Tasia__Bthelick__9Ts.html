		  Sweet dreams are made of this
Sweet dreams are made of this
Sweet dreams are made of this
Sweet dreams are made of this

Sweet dreams are made of this
Who am I to disagree?
I travel the world And the seven seas
Everybody's looking for something

Sweet dreams are made of this
Who am I to disagree?
I travel the world And the seven seas
Everybody's looking for something

Sweet dreams are made of this
Who am I to disagree?
I travel the world And the seven seas
Everybody's looking for something

Some of them want to use you
Some of them want to get used by you
Some of them want to abuse you
Some of them want to be abused
Hold your head up 
Keep your head up
Hold your head up 
Keep your head up
Hold your head up 
Keep your head up
Hold your head up 
Keep your head up

Sweet dreams are made of this
Who am I to disagree?
I travel the world
And the seven seas
Everybody's looking for something

Some of them want to use you
Some of them want to get used by you
Some of them want to abuse you
Some of them want to be abused

Sweet dreams are made of this
Who am I to disagree?
I travel the world
And the seven seas
Everybody's looking for something
Sweet dreams are made of this
Who am I to disagree?
I travel the world
And the seven seas
Everybody's looking for something

Some of them want to use you
Some of them want to get used by you
Some of them want to abuse you
Some of them want to be abused

Some of them want to use you
Some of them want to get used by you
Some of them want to abuse you
Some of them want to be abused

Hold your head up 
Keep your head up
Hold your head up 
Keep your head up
Hold your head up 
Keep your head up
Hold your head up 
Keep your head up

Hold your head up
Keep your head up, movin' on
Hold your head up
Keep your head up, movin' on
Hold your head up, movin' on
Keep your head up, movin' on
Hold your head up, movin' on
Keep your head up, movin' on

Sweet dreams are made of this
Who am I to disagree?
I travel the world
And the seven seas
Everybody's looking for something

Hold your head up
Keep your head up, movin' on
Hold your head up
Keep your head up, movin' on
Hold your head up, movin' on Keep your head up, movin' on
Hold your head up, movin' on Keep your head up, movin' on
Hold your head up, movin' on Keep your head up, movin' on
