		  Out of My Head

I got a little bit of something, but its all in my head
But god its better than nothin, better than cavin in
Get me out, get me out I’m needed, yeah that’s because I’m done dreamin
I’m a wreck I’m only human, its human, I’m breakin

Out of my head, but it ain’t who I am
Yeah, I’m keepin my crown I’m takin 
The last piece of my heart worth savin
Out of my head but it ain’t who I am
Yeah, I’m keepin my crown I’m takin
The last piece of my heart worth savin

So, I’ve been pickin up the pieces tryin to find out what fits
But god it’s better than nothin better than losin it
Get me out, get me out I’m needed, yeah that’s because I’m done dreamin
I’m a wreck I’m only human, its human 

I’m breakin out of my head, but it ain’t who I am 
Yeah, I’m keepin my crown I’m takin 
The last piece of my heart worth savin
Out of my head all over again 
Yeah, I’m keepin my crown I’m takin
The last piece of my heart worth savin

It’s like I got it all, yeah, it’s like a chemical it’s insane
It’s like a domino and things are fallin in to place
It’s like I’m wide awake, yeah, yeah, I’m so far away from this place
It’s like a leap of faith and things will never be the same

Oh, I’m out of my head, but it ain’t who I am
Yeah, I’m keepin my crown I’m takin 
The last piece of my heart worth savin
Out of my head all over again 
Yeah, I’m keepin my crown I’m takin 
The last piece of my heart worth savin

Out of my head, but it ain’t who I am
Yeah, I’m keepin my crown I’m takin 
The last piece of my heart worth savin
