		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's been a lonely night
Just woke up and saw the sun 
Think it's time that I move on 
Been spending my days
Trying to find something like
What we had it felt so right 
I thought I could forget her 
Still here lost in your clouds 
Been to hell and to heaven 
But you're still 
In my heart 
I thought I could forget her 
Still here lost in your clouds 
Been to hell and to heaven 
But you're still 
In my heart 
You're a witch in the night
Call upon me and I'll 
Surface back, back to life 

I said there's no delay
Rushing quick to get to you
I'm a fool, fool for you 
I thought I could forget her 
Still here lost in your clouds
Been to hell and to heaven 
But you're still 
In my heart (In my heart)
(In my heart)
I thought I could forget her 
Still here lost in your clouds 
Been to hell and to heaven 
But you're still 
In my heart 
You're still in my 
In my heart, in my heart 
You're still in my 
In my heart, in my heart (In my heart)

(That's your place yeah) 
(Deep in my heart) 
(In my heart)
(In my heart)
I thought I could forget her 
Still here lost in your clouds
Been to hell and to heaven 
But you're still 
In my heart (In my heart)
