		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Will all who wish to die please raise their hands

I'm not lost in the dark
I'm not blind to what I see
I know the river's wide and the water is deep
I feel the cold, my heart skips a beat
Don't need your absolution
So don't hold that sword over me
For my confessions I don't need a church
I don't need salt to know where it hurts
Don't pray for me, no (will all who wish to die please raise their hands)

I cannot breathe for you
You're trying over and over, denying what I feel
And every time you bow down your head to pray
Don't pray for me, don't pray for me

Oh, I needed revolution, never had a war in mind
And now the river's dry and the fall is deep
The truth is dark and it makes us bleed

In hell is where I stand
It's where I find my inner strength
For my confessions I don't need a church
I don't need salt to know where it hurts
Don't pray for me, no

I cannot breathe for you
You're trying over and over, denying what I feel
And every time you bow down your head to pray
Don't pray for me, don't pray for me

I'm going to let you pray for me
I cannot breathe for you
You're trying over and over, denying what I feel
And every time you bow down your head to pray
Don't pray for me, don't pray for me
