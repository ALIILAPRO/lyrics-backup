		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I made the perfect you in my head
'Cause physically, you are the blueprint
But internally, god damn you're a mess
So to stay with you, I had to imagine

That he is perfect
Anything I give him, he deserves it
Rarely does he ever come to see me
But anytime he does, he makes it worth it
Like I earned it

God, I love him
And when I'm with you, I can't help myself but only think about him
I can't wait to see him again
My god, I miss him
And when I'm with you, I'm just thinkin' 'bout how much I wish it was him
I can't wait to see him again

More frequent visits would've been nice
But I don't want you knowing that there's somebody new
Sometimes the guilt will clog up my mind (ooh-oh, oh-oh)
But is it cheating if I love a better version of you?

'Cause he is perfect
Anything I give him, he deserves it
Rarely does he ever come to see me
But anytime he does, he makes it worth it
Like I earned it

God, I love him
And when I'm with you, I can't help myself but only think about him
I can't wait to see him again
My god, I miss him
And when I'm with you, I'm just thinkin' 'bout how much I wish it was him
I can't wait to see him again

My god, I miss him
And when I'm with you, I'm just thinkin' 'bout how much I wish it was him
I can't wait to see him again, oh
