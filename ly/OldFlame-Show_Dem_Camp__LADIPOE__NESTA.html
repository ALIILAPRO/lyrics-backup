		  Classic

Somehow it slipped through our fingers
I'm still in love now you got me crazy
Somehow it slipped through our fingers
I’m still in love now you got me crazy

See any problems we got we can overcome
Cause you are me baby
See any problems we got we can overcome
Cause you are me baby

I never stopped wanting you
Got me reminiscing on the good times
Wanting you
Something in me won't let me say goodbye
Wanting you
Stop fronting you know it
Don't like to be lonely
I’m yours and you know it

How we go from a main screen status
In the sheets laid up
One day wake up and act like strangers
Used to fly Han Solo
You were my Leia
Now I am Van Gogh
With my whole ear taped up

All from the screaming it off
Girl this ain't us
Told me you were leaving
Should have said wait up but

You know pride is the devil
Then this Edwards Scissorhands cut ties
Something special
Left an open wound that was far from sterile
In the name of closure let's vibe on a level
Know I tend to switch from Hyde into Jekyll
But if we talking good times
Ma we had several

See love's a muscle, needs resistance to grow
Some more dedication is all I propose
Hope I am not here pouring water on stone
Cause I had to let you know on the low

I never stopped wanting you
Got me reminiscing on the good times
Wanting you
Something in me won't let me say goodbye
Wanting you
Stop fronting you know it
Don't like to be lonely
I'm yours and you know it

Another new school guy with these pies
Wey dey improvise
When she met a king she dey visualize
Now she done dey see the light
Said I put it down now she hypnotize

Used to feel the waves
Now she feel the tide
Said she wanna vibe, wanna feel alive
Said she wanna ride with the winning side
Said it's bang bang and she realised
That she ready to decide

So where you wanna go now baby slow down
Freed all her guys say she wanna slow down
Giving you the load down all the codes now
When did your world turn to a ghost town

If we go deep are you sure you won’t drown
If I find out are you sure it won’t count
When yawa come
Shey this omo won't bounce
And even if she do men
That’s how it goes down
That's how it goes down

Somehow it slipped through our fingers
I'm still in love now you got me crazy
Somehow it slipped through our fingers
I'm still in love now you got me crazy

See any problems we got we can overcome
Cause you are me baby
See any problems we got we can overcome
Cause you are me baby

I never stopped wanting you
Got me reminiscing on the good times
Wanting you
Something in me won’t let me say goodbye
Wanting you
Stop fronting you know it
Don't like to be lonely (but you knew that)
I'm yours and you know it

I've been yours since shorts and pinafores
Was that JS2 boy took shots, never scored
Now we taking shots over our dinner
Who's keeping score
Beginners locked in love
How did it turn to war

She said, you act like you don't know why
I know you're Ladipoe
But you were Ladipo then
You should have kept your heart for me
But it belonged to your pen
That will forever leave a mark
I can't repeat this again

My ambition speaks for itself
Louder than the remedies
I keep on rolling to help
Yeah and every time I think we're done baby
I text you something crazy

Like are you gonna read my lips or just kiss them
Don't you know that you're so deep in my system
What we do behind closed doors is not Christian
This right here is my confession

I never stopped wanting you
Got me reminiscing on the good times
Wanting you
Something in me won't let me say goodbye
Wanting you
Stop fronting you know it
Don't like to be lonely
I'm yours and you know it
