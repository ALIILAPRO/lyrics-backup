		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take me now, I'm ready.
As ready as I'll ever be.
Take me now, I'm ready.
Come along with me.

Well you, you wanted me for so long.
And I, I wanted you.
You know my heart, gets rockin' and reelin',
When you come into view.

So won't you take me now, I'm ready.
As ready as I'll ever be.
Take me now, I'm ready.
Come along with me.

Go on won't you take me now, I'm ready.
As ready as I'll ever be.
Take me now, I'm ready.
Come along with me.

Well I, I know all about the ladies.
And you, you know all about the boys.
It's time for us to get together.
And learn, learn about the joys.

So won't you take me now, I'm ready.
As ready as I'll ever be.
Take me now, I'm ready.
Come along with me.

Take me now, I'm ready.
As ready as I'll ever be.
Take me now, I'm ready.
Come along with me.

So won't you take me now, I'm ready.
As ready as I'll ever be.
Take me now, I'm ready.
Come along with me.

Take me now, I'm ready.
As ready as I'll ever be.
Take me now, I'm ready.
Come along with me.

Take me now, you know I'm ready.
Take me now, you know I want you.
You know I need you.
You know I'm ready.
You know I want you.
