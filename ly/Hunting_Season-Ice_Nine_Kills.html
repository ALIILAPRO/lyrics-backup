		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They've come for us, they've come from the darkness
To burn it all and bury what's left
Who can we trust when we're always the target?

(Now I know)

I cannot be broken, I cannot be wronged
Hunting season is open, so we're marching on (marching on)
Against the wall, against the odds, the lone survivor
I cannot be broken, I cannot be wronged 
(I cannot be, I cannot be wronged)

We've set our sights on shadowy figures
We'll make it right and never recoil
Can't pull it off 'til we're pulling our triggers

(Now I know)

I cannot be broken, I cannot be wronged
Hunting season is open, so we're marching on (marching on)
Against the wall, against the odds, the lone survivor
I cannot be broken, I cannot be wronged (I cannot be wronged)
I cannot be wronged

(Our faction will thrive)
(Land, loot, survive)

We won't fall to our knees, this will always be our town
(This will always be our town)
We will rise and reclaim control of this battleground

They've come for us, they've come from the (darkness)
To burn it all and bury what's left
The joke's on them, 'cause now they're the target
Our guns are slinging (so we'll keep singing)
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da (so we'll keep singing)
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da

I cannot be broken, I cannot be wronged
Hunting season is open, so we're marching on (marching on)
Against the wall, against the odds, the lone survivor
I cannot be broken, I cannot be wronged (I cannot be wronged)
I cannot be wronged

Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
(So we'll keep singing) da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
