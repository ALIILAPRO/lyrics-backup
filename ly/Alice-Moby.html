		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My head keeps turnin' turnin'
Like Russian roulette
Thoughts are like bullets
I cannot do this...do this...
Do this... 
Do this...

[Repeating "do this..."]

[Chorus: x2]
How do I feel like?
Alright probably going home
Gonna make it the same
Gonna make it my love time... 
My love time...

Cause this is the right world
This is the wrong world
This is the one world
This is the dark world
This is the sun world
This is the sun world
Can you become girl here in the fun world?

[Chorus]

Psychosomatic
Imagine having shadows swooping
To the sadness
And mirrors cracking
The shudders was a trappin'

High empty
With callas 
Rapid up on the mirror
I'm jealous chemically
Imbalance into my channel

Tracking through the heart of the devil
My minutes longer so whatever
My thoughts are spinnin' from umbrellas to higher levels

Severed from your lovin'
I'm troublin' to talk to no one
And no one told there's no one
I'm feelin' in here the cold come

Where I'm not supposed to 
With padded rooms like a sofa
They told me it's for my hova
My voices on my shoulder
Plan it
Let the vultures divulgin'
To keep revolvin' the spot
Works on my focus
My culture, but no one knows it

This is why you focusin' mostly upon my my own shit.
I told you I'm not the culprit I'm the only one you notice
Walking across the ocean explosives with co-motive I'm hopeless
With out your notice I'm goin' 'til my mind falls

Psychosomatic I don't know what is the matter...
Psychosomatic I don't know what is the matter with me.

[Chorus]

Cause this is the right world
This is the wrong world
This is the one world
This is the dark world
This is the sun world
This is the sun world
Can you become girl here in the fun world?

Mix it up with the alpha hits
Now me smokey yeah I smoke them trees
Think that we should ever stop from takin' trips
From my Jah to the U.S. strips
Let my country road go everywhere we go
They just adjust there toxin to make it easier-oh
Easy enough, get down the road
Hey there missy
I like the way you movin'

[x2]
My head keeps turnin' turnin'
Like Russian roulette
Thoughts are like bullets
I cannot do this...
Do this...
Do this...

[Chorus: x2]

[Everything Begins to Fade]

Cause this is the right world
This is the wrong world
This is the one world
This is the dark world
This is the sun world
This is the sun world
Can you become girl here in the fun world?

[Chorus: x2]

Cause this is the right world
This is the wrong world
This is the one world
This is the dark world
This is the sun world
This is the sun world
Can you become girl here in the fun world?
