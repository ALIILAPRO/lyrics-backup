		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Steal your soul 
Steal your soul 
Steal your soul 
Steal your soul 
Steal your soul 
You took me down
To the river
Steal your soul 
You took me down
Steal your soul 
You took me down
To the river

Steal your soul 
You took me down
Steal your soul 
Steal your soul 
You took me down
Steal your soul 
Steal your soul 
You took me down (down, down)

You took me down (down, down)

You took me down (down, down)
And drowned me
