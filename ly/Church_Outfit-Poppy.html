		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is the dress I want to be buried in
Leave the rings, I might need them
I'm holy water, take a sip
This is my church outfit

Life is a commercial for death
Anger is something I worked to manifest
Life is a commercial for death
And you're hypnotized by the advertisement

I'll dress to the nines, show up on time
You can wear whenever you like
Dress to the nines, show up on time
You can wear whenever you like

This is the dress I want to be buried in
Leave the rings, I might need them
I'm holy water, take a sip
This is my church outfit

It's my confession and my testament
Don't need your weapons, I got my own
And you said I couldn't commit
This is my church outfit

It's my confession and my testament
Don't need your weapons, I got my own
You said I couldn't commit
This is my church outfit
