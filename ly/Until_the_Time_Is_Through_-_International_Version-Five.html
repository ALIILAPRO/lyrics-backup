		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now and forever 
Until the time is through
I can't believe it, I don't know where to start
No, baby, so many questions deep inside my heart

Give me a moment before you go
There's something you ought to know

Baby, now and forever
Until the time is through (until the time is through)
I'll be standing here
Waiting and never give up my faith in you (give up my faith in you)
Trying to make it clear
Without your love, I'd be half a man 
Maybe one day, you'll understand
Now and forever, until the time is through

I'll be waiting

How can I tell you, so that you can see
You know that, love has a meaning
When you are here with me (when you are here with me baby)

Give me a moment before you go
There's something you ought to know

Baby now and forever
Until the time is through (until the time is through)
I'll be standing here
Waiting and never give up my faith in you (give up my faith in you)
Trying to make it clear
Without your love, I'd be half a man 
Maybe one day, you'll understand
Now and forever, until the time is through

There is no one to comfort me
Here in my cold reality
I'm searching for words
What can I say to make you see

Baby now (now and forever)
Until the time is through (until the time is through) 
I'll be here

Baby now (now and forever)
Until the time is through (until the time is through) 
I'll be here

Baby now and forever
Until the time is through (until the time is through)
I'll be standing here
Waiting and never give up my faith in you (give up my faith in you)
Trying to make it clear
Without your love, I'd be half a man
Maybe one day, you'll understand
Now and forever, I will be here for you
Until the time is through
