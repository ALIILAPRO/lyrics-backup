		  (What up, Ant?) Tried and tried again 
(Tried and tried again)
But now this is the end (Helluva made this beat, baby)
(Let me talk to 'em)
Tell me, what's the use of holding on (oh yeah)
If we can't be friends? I'm em- (ayy)

Hurt my heart when niggas I think solid, don't be solid
Confuse me when they rap when they was really out here slidin'
Childhood like Chris Brown and Drake's song, no guidance
If anybody find peace, let me know where to find it

You know? 'Cause it ain't easy being me
Ain't easy dealin' with a death 'cause they was sleepin' on the beef
Ain't easy totin' switches while the police ridin' up the street
Ain't easy wakin' up in prison after dreamin' you was free
Hate disappearin', but this how it gotta be
'Cause I'm not knowin' what to think, tryna teach niggas how to think
Niggas that you used to see with me that's not with me
Can't ever tell you what they did for me, just what they got from me
But I tried and tried again, I'm far from the end
Ask God, remove all the snakes and I start losin' friends
Niggas just want your momentum, so they come pretend
That they fuck with you, just be careful on who you let in
Damn, what happened? We was just laughin'
I ain't know that when I turned my back, you was gon' stab me
You don't love me, you love what I do, you love my actions
Street niggas be phony too, not just the niggas that be rappin'

Hurt my heart when bitches I think solid, don't be solid
Confuse me when they fuck me over, I thought we was vibin'
Childhood like Chris Brown and Drake's song, no guidance
If anybody find peace, let me know where to find it 'cause I tried

Yeah, uh, burnin' candles and lightin' sage
Pick my notebook up and then I write a page
Admittedly, this ain't one of my brightest days
I talk to God and beg Him to help me find my way, uh
And friends changin' like pronouns
I thought they was there for me, couldn't hold it down
Feelin' like The Lost Boy, like my first album
Just drownin' myself in tears, brought the worst outcome
Friends changin', real niggas is endangered (for real)
Righthands become strangers, we used to player Power Rangers
Even stole Now & Laters from gas stations
I'm back pacin', reminiscin' on past relations (damn)
Catchin' jets like Aaron Rodgers, no vaccinations
Waitin' on my time to come, all we had was patience
Left my scars open, I lost all hope in
Loyalty 'cause that's how you get your heart broken

Hurt my heart when bitches I think solid, don't be solid
Confuse me when they fuck me over, I thought we was vibin'
Childhood like Chris Brown and Drake's song, no guidance
If anybody find peace, let me know where to find it 'cause I tried

Tried and tried again
But now this is the end
Tell me, what's the use of holding on
If we can't be friends?
I'm em- (Beat Gang)
