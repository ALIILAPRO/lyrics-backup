		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I stand upon the solid
Rock of faith in Christ
This steadfast hope shall not
Break apart within the trial
I am assured His promises will never fail
As long as life remains He is faithful

God is patient
God is kind
He does not envy
He does not boast
His ways are higher than my own, His thoughts consume the great unknown
Of this alone I am sure
My God is love

I draw my breath under His created windswept sky
I know my hope shall last
Long after my flesh retires
From dusk until the dawn He calls His children home
His righteous love outlasts generations

God is patient
God is kind
He does not envy
He does not boast
His ways are higher than my own, His thoughts consume the great unknown
Of this alone I am sure
My God is love

He is Almighty God Elohim
Maker of the earth, He is the Lord of hosts, Heaven's King
God of endless worth, His kingdom stands above Every power
Every living soul, His love is like the sun
Ever true, shining over all

He is Almighty God Elohim
Maker of the earth, He is the Lord of hosts, Heaven's King
God of endless worth, His kingdom stands above Every power
Every living soul, His love is like the sun
Ever true, shining over all

God is patient
God is kind
He does not envy
He does not boast
His ways are higher than my own, His thoughts consume the great unknown
Of this alone I am sure
My God is love
