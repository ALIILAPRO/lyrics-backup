		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I think my life might be better if I lived in Colorado (mmm)
Sit around and get high, sippin' some white wine out the bottle (bottle)
I throw my phone into a lake
And watch it sink to a better place, down at the bottom
I think my life might be better if I lived in Colorado

'Cause maybe there I'd like myself
Work on my mental health
Might even feel compelled
To sing karaoke
Down at the local dive
And meet some young ex-wife
We'd start a brand new life
And never be lonely

Swear to God, I am going
Not that far but I know I won't (I know I won't)
Yeah, I know I won't (I know, I know, I know I)

Who am I kiddin'? I'm addicted to the chip on my shoulder
I like it best breaking a sweat
So I go somewhere that is colder (I go somewhere that is colder)
And I'll admit, it would be nice
To meet some guy who's not my type
And move to Boulder
But I think I'd probably hate my life
If I lived in Colorado (I think I'd probably hate my life)

'Cause maybe there I'd like myself
Work on my mental health
Might even feel compelled
To finally let go
But it's an empty dream
That shit's not meant for me
I choose the devil I know
Over the heaven I don't

Swear to God, I am going
Not that far but I know I won't (I know I won't)
Yeah, I know I won't (I know, I know)
Yeah, I know I tell myself I'm leavin'
This is hell but I'll stay right here (I'll stay right here)
Yeah, I'll stay right here

I'll stay right here (I'll stay right here)
I'll stay right here (it's alright here)
I'll stay right here (I'm used to having)
Yeah, I'll stay right here (I'll stay right)
(I'll stay) I'll stay right here
