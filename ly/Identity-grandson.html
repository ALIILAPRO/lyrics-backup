		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Nobody really cared, so it never really mattered
It never really mattered, so it never really happened
What's the point in fightin' for a happy ever after?
The past keeps hauntin' the future, I imagine (woo)
All I ever wanted was a little peace and quiet
Just color in the lines, and you'll get it like they promise
If you bite the hand, get louder and defiant
Then you'll see how quickly they come making a deposit

One false move, you're Kennedy
If you fight it, you're the enemy
I'm so sick, but I can't find a remedy
I'm still tryna find my identity
Where's my head on the podium?
Gas me up, no petroleum
I'm so sick, but I can't find a remedy
I'm still tryna find my identity

Mass detention, debt collection
Missed direction, got lost, missed intervention
We missed redemption, missed reflection
Kissed the weapon, skip the lesson, got an infection
Mass confusion, air pollution, compromise foreign contribution
Mass epidemic, no mask and amass, call the medic, go fast
Do I last? Apathetic
Might crash, I'm a hack, I'm pathetic, I know
Time's ain't changin', the sun don't show
When the trees won't grow, when the bombs keep droppin'
The fake tan on the TV keep talkin'
Just wanna be optimistic, my sanity's gone off, ballistic
Train was leavin', I just missed it
Guess that I'm stuck with this shit, damn

One false move, you're Kennedy
If you fight it, you're the enemy
I'm so sick, but I can't find a remedy
I'm still tryna find my identity
Where's my head on the podium?
Gas me up, no petroleum
I'm so sick, but I can't find a remedy
I'm still tryna find my identity (-dentity, -dentity)

I'm still tryna find my identity

One false move, you're Kennedy
If you fight it, you're the enemy
I'm so sick, but I can't find a remedy
I'm still tryna find my identity
Where's my head on the podium?
Gas me up, no petroleum
I'm so sick, but I can't find a remedy
I'm still tryna find my identity (-dentity)
