		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh
Ooh

It's too loud
Talking to you in all these airports
You can't hear me
I'm putting too much on the line
And you're telling me
Not to worry

It's too loud
Talking to you in all these airports
You can't hear me
I'm putting too much on the line
And you're telling me
Not to worry

But the tone of your voice
Is making me want to cry
The tone of your voice
Is making me want to cry

Doo, doo doo
Doo doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo 
Doo, doo, doo 

Sink my face to my hands
Universe I don't want to be alone again
'Cause I found love
Stronger than a river
That drowns the swimmer
I'm gasping for air
Need to come up

I'm three minutes to falling
Just tell me I'm all you need
I'm three minutes to falling
Just tell me I'm all you need

I won't fool around again
Oh
Don't fool around again

Lean against the speckled soil
Right eye is tearing up
Straight up
Sink my face to my hands
Universe I don't want to be alone again
'Cause I found love (doo, doo, doo)
Stronger than a river (doo, doo, doo)
That drowns the swimmer (doo, doo, doo)
I'm gasping for air (doo, doo, doo)

'Cause I found love
Gasping for air
'Cause I found love
I'm gasping for air
'Cause I found love
I'm gasping for air
