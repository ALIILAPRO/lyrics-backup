		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How do I get through one night without you
If I had to live without you
What kinda life would that be
Oh I, I need you in my arms, need you to hold
You're my world, my heart, my soul

If you ever leave
Well, baby you would take away everything
Good in my life
And tell me now

How do I live without you?
I want to know
How do I breathe without you?
If you ever go
How do I ever, ever survive
How do I, how do I, oh how do I live

Without you
There'd be no sun in my sky
There would be no love in my life
There'd be no world left for me

And I, well baby, I don't know what I would do
I'd be lost if I lost you

If you ever leave
Well, baby you would take away everything
Real in my life
And tell me now

How do I live without you
I want to know
How do I breathe without you
If you ever go
How do I ever, ever survive
How do I, how do I, oh how do I live

Please tell me baby how do I go on

If you ever leave
Well, baby you would take away everything
Need you with me
Baby don't you know that you're everything
Good in my life

And tell me now
How do I live without you
I want to know
How do I breathe without you
If you ever go
How do I ever, ever survive
How do I, how do I, oh how do I live

How do I live without you?
How do I live without you, baby?
How do I live
