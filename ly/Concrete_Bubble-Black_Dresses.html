		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  OKAY UH alright alright uhhhh
Haha uhh fuck this shit up uhhh
Rock out rock out ok devi

Rock your body uh uh UH UH UH

Rock your body like a cattle plague
Endless, paralytic, stagnant uncertainty

Watch the death like a shitlib
Sitting on your hands
Never did shit, never known shit
Never done shit for anyone ever
Never-never done shit for anyone ever

I know it's not easy for anyone
We're all on a clear light hell trip
But that doesn't mean we shouldn't try
Just don't come anywhere near me
And we'll be ok
I don't wanna see anyone's face
I'm dealing with my own shit right now
You can deal with your shit somewhere else

TEN THOUSAND EYES (yea)
Broken lenses seeing different lives
IT'S OKAY TO HIDE (yea')
If you have the luxury tHIN LINES (yea)
Getting thinner all the time tHE LIGHT:
Casting shadows til the shadows
Are the only thing alive
Eleven thousand eyes

Stuck inside a concrete bubble
Everyone is "doing their best"
I think that it's kind of whatever
But dreams are not meant to be achieved

It's just not enough it's never been enough
When the FUCK has it been enough
Only to dream?

How do you know
What direction you should go?
Breaking into pieces offering up your soul
Keep it behind your windows
I can't put you at ease or judge you
Everyone is a different ruin
Everyone has to figure their own shit out

I'm not you i'm not you
And you're not me i'm not you
And you're not me i'm not you
And you're not me

I'm not you and you're not me
I'm not you and you're not me
You're not me and I'm not you
I'm not you and you're not me

I can't even stand to be me
What the fuck is going on in your head?
What the fuck is going on in your head?
What the fuck is going on in your head?

I know what it feels like
Empty hollow inside everyone's fucked up
I can't tell you that you're fine
Life goes on, you know?

Is that? Shit
