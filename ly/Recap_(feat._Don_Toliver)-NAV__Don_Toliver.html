		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh (shout through your car door)
Ooh (shout out to Cardo, yeah)
Ooh, ooh (yeah)
Oh, oh (yeah)

I'm like, "Damn, lil' shawty you stylish"
Too geeked up on a island
Cartier frames, you valid
I can't tell where your mind at, yeah
Baby might start a fire
Long as I get to burn with ya
Let me be your supplier
Long as I get to burn with ya
Took enough time to get your stripes, I seen you fall back
Took a lil' time to hold yourself, avoided contact
You outta line to think that I would never come back
Remember that time you gave me that head, I need a recap, yeah

Mm, had me a soul-snatcher, had a mouth like a water slide (slide)
Pull up on me, baby girl, I need a reminder (yeah)
Every time you fuck with me, yeah, you know it's gon' be a vibe (vibe)
Got a pint comin' through and I'm not not goin' outside
I'm on that dirty road (road)
Used to hit the block, where it's hot, but I can't no more
Fuckin' with a brown boy like me, girl, gotta stay on yo' toes (stay on yo' toes)
Made some bags on quarantine, I ain't gotta do no shows (ooh)
Why you checkin' up on me? (On me)
We both know I'm doin' fine
I know they hate on me (on me)
Fuck it, I never mind (ooh)
She just call me, yeah (brr), whenever she like (yeah)
She know I'ma be up (I'm up) at whatever time (yeah)

I'm like, "Damn, lil' shawty you stylish"
Too geeked up on a island
Cartier frames, you valid
I can't tell where your mind at, yeah
Baby might start a fire
Long as I get to burn with ya
Let me be your supplier
Long as I get to burn with ya
Took enough time to get your stripes, I seen you fall back
Took a lil' time to hold yourself, avoided contact
You outta line to think that I would never come back
Remember that time you gave me that head, I need a recap, yeah

(Yeah) I wanna do somethin', oh, I'm goin' all night, oh
(Yeah) you keep callin' my name, you can't relax, no
(Yeah) I wanna do somethin', oh, I'm goin' all night, oh
(Yeah) you keep callin' my name, you can't relax, no
