		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Seen the hood make sacrifices
And the hood rivals
And the hood vitals
And the hood rights
And the hood bible

I seen the hood life
Seen the hood cry
Seen the hood riding
At first vices

No silver spoons so they shot dope antidotes
Old heads telling lies murder introduced
Gave me thirty shots like I guess I'm seduced
Should I pull the trigger start shooting

Everybody became dead bodies
But then we walk through 64 became allies
Everybody in the trenches don't make it alive
Girls telling men don't cry

Best friends turn to enemies
Hustle for a Bentley
I was on my six-speed
Riding 'til my wheels lean

Skies from the concrete
Made a boy a man
I feel LA soul with the wind

The streets don't pretend
The streets don't make amends
And the police make evidence
I'm just riding through in a Benz

Seen the hood make sacrifices
And the hood rivals
And the hood vitals
And the hood rights
And the hood bible

I seen the hood life
Seen the hood cry
Seen the hood riding
At first vices

I seen the hood cycle
And the hood Michael
Jackson and Jordan just the hood type

I got the hood vibes
Late night riding summer time hood nights

On the curb with the fire hydrants
At the Park watching City and Manny Dub for the highlights
Ditching school for the highlife
Robbing for Jordan's not the flight Nikes

Neighborhood cameras on the lights
You hear the sirens police on the bikes
You hear the silence somebody die
You see the soul lift from his body

You see the shells somebody shot him
You see the gun all in his brother pocket

In the streets you alone
In the streets ain't no hope
And the cases prolong
And the murder go on

Seen the hood make sacrifices
And the hood rivals
And the hood vitals
And the hood rights
And the hood bible

I seen the hood life
Seen the hood cry
Seen the hood riding
At first vices
