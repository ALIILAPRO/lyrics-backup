		  (Ayy, ayy, Kevlar, that motherfucker fire)
(I watch Kevlar cook the beat)
M-a-d

Slide (yeah), slide (yeah)
Slide (yeah), slide (yeah)
Catch him lackin', we gon' bust him (yeah)
.45, don't like to tussle (bop-bop)
I fucked his sister, yeah
If she try to fight me, shoot her brother (yeah)
These diamonds hit like lightning, shining bright, this drip a puddle
Walked in when I was countin' up, she gon' bite me, grab a muzzle
First spot just made two hundred racks, can't wait to rent another
Shoot first, no room to hesitate, that's how they caught my brother (21)

Spin (21), spin (21)
If you miss, spin again (21)
I give you w, you hit his twin
Hold on, hold on, hold on (phew, phew, phew)
Let me see what car them niggas in
I be all up in the club with the F&N
You see your opps and made friends (huh?)
Big 4l pussy hold a lot of shells, pussy
Whack your brother, show you how his body smell, pussy
Every time we slide, you niggas gon' tell, pussy
If you talk to hold, that's just like talkin' to 12, pussy
Step (21)
Name an opp that we ain't shot (21)
We ain't smokin' one, we smokin' their whole block (21)
Time to slide, you know they rockin' out for rocks (21)
Put a hunnid on 'em, I don't play on niggas top (pussy)

Slide (yeah), slide (yeah)
Slide (yeah), slide (yeah)
Catch him lackin', we gon' bust him (yeah)
.45, don't like to tussle (bop-bop)
I fucked his sister, yeah
If she try to fight me, shoot her brother (yeah)
These diamonds hit like lightning, shining bright, this drip a puddle
Walked in when I was countin' up, she gon' bite me, grab a muzzle
First spot just made two hundred racks, can't wait to rent another
Shoot first, no room to hesitate, that's how they caught my brother (21)

We came from taking shit, look at me now, hell of a hustler (i know they proud of me)
You scared to take a loss, how you gon' win without no struggle? (Think 'bout that)
Niggas get confronted by they sins and show they colors (rack, rack)
Beefin' 'bout these bitches, shoot a pistol 'cause he love her (rack, rack)
Fell in love with stackin', shoot a missile 'bout these hundreds (stack, stack)
My goal to get the money, boy, you play, we puttin' you under (slide)
On this soda, got me rollin', bitch, I'm loaded, check my jeans (slide)
Nigga folded, on my brodie, I'ma slide 'til he free (slide)

Slide (yeah), slide (yeah)
Slide (yeah), slide (yeah)
Catch him lackin', we gon' bust him (yeah)
.45, don't like to tussle (bop-bop)
I fucked his sister, yeah
If she try to fight me, shoot her brother (yeah)
These diamonds hit like lightning, shining bright, this drip a puddle
Walked in when I was countin' up, she gon' bite me, grab a muzzle
First spot just made two hundred racks, can't wait to rent another
Shoot first, no room to hesitate, that's how they caught my brother (21)

Slide, slide
Slide, slide
