		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby
You know you drive me crazy yeah crazy
Save me
You're body is my remedy
But before you get ahead of me

Girl you know I wanna fuck you in the right ways
Take a pick, backseat or to my place
I been thinking bout your lips and how they might taste
Girl I know it makes you nervous when I grab your waist girl
Like water you drip
Finding out she could commit all these sins
I know you're different then all of the rest
She wanna ride, she wanna
Impress me yeah

Its three am and you want me
Hit my line and I'm on my way
Hit my line and I'm on my way yeah
Girl I know you're feeling lonely
Empty bed Is where you lay
I can tell you want company
But don't lie and say you miss me
Cause I know what you do when I'm away
When I'm away
Baby you think you can fix me
But I'm still gonna push away
Wether you stay

I don't think i'll change
Fake love don't phase me
Im into the lies you feed me
Baby love ain't easy
Let's just skip the teasing
So lets put our emotions away
I just wanna hear you say my name

Girl you know I wanna fuck you in the right ways
Take a pick, backseat or to my place
I been thinking bout your lips and how they might taste
Girl I know it makes you nervous when I grab your waist girl
Like water you drip
Finding out she could commit all these sins
I know your different then all of the rest
She wanna ride, she wanna
Impress me yeah

Give me your love
Give me your love
Give me your love
Give me your love
Give me your love
Give me your love

Girl you know I wanna fuck you in the right ways
Take a pick, backseat or to my place
I been thinking bout your lips and how they might taste
Girl I know it makes you nervous when I grab your waist girl
Like water you drip
Finding out she could commit all these sins
I know your different then all of the rest
She wanna ride, she wanna
Impress me yeah
