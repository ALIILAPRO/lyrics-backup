		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You-ooh, ooh

You never quite said it
'Til death do us part
I bet you regret it
When you kiss her in your car
Why won't you admit it?
I know that it's hard
To say I'm the reason you're scared of the dark

Although I left, I'm not gone
It's funny how every day you say that you moved on
Haha, I hope that

Everywhere you go and everything you do
You'll never forget me, I'll be watching you
And when you take her home
You're kissin' someone new
You'll be wishin' it was me on top of you
And when she's in your bed, I'll be in your head
You'll be thinkin' 'bout me instead
Everywhere you go and everythin' you do
You'll never escape me, baby, I'm gon' haunt you-ooh
There's nothin' I'd rather do-ooh, ooh

You asked me to promise
To leave you alone
But that would be boring
So, sorry, it's a "no"
'Cause I kinda like it when I'm fuckin' with your head
I kinda like the games I play
I smile when I see you upset (yeah)

Although I left, I'm not gone
It's funny how every day you say that you moved on
Haha, I hope that

Everywhere you go and everything you do
You'll never forget me, I'll be watching you
And when you take her home
You're kissin' someone new
You'll be wishin' it was me on top of you
And when she's in your bed, I'll be in your head
You'll be thinkin' 'bout me instead
Everywhere you go and everythin' you do
You'll never escape me, baby, I'm gon' haunt you-ooh
There's nothin' I'd rather do-ooh, ooh

Everywhere you go and everything you do
You'll never forget me, I'll be watching you
And when you take her home (when you take her home)
You're kissin' someone new (kissin' someone new)
You'll never escape me, baby, I'm gon' haunt you-ooh
There's nothin' I'd rather do-ooh, ooh

Na-na-na-na
I know where you live
So watch your fuckin' back
I'ma teach you not to treat a girl like that
First thing when you wake
The last thing that you'll see
You get what you give when you mess with me
