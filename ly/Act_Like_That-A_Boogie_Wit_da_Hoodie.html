		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fuckin' 'round with the wrong bitch, now my heart itch
Now I never wanna be sober (yeah)
And it's only 'cause your ass so fat
From the front, you know what's back there
And I ain't tryna be fallin' in love
Yeah, you don't even love me enough
Yeah, why you gotta act like that?
Act all that
And it's only 'cause your ass so fat
From the front, you know what's back there
And I ain't tryna be fallin' in love
You don't even love me enough
We just finished breakin' up

Nigga, I was dead broke (broke)
But that was back around the time I was tryna get signed
They was calling me DeJ Loaf (Loaf)
Niggas that I be around, they don't play around
They'll cut your whole face open (face open)
These days, gotta play it too safe, niggas be two-faced
You a real joke (yeah, yeah)
Drive by in a Range Rover, fuck around and hit your whole face
And I ain't jokin'
Fuckin' 'round with the wrong bitch, now my heart itch
Now I never wanna be sober (yeah)
I ain't even gon' lie, I was feelin' so down
I was even drinkin' pink soda
These days, gotta play it too safe
I don't even wanna let a bitch sleepover
Look, I already know that she ain't good for me
But, fuck it, I'ma keep goin', yeah
I'ma keep goin', look

Why you gotta act like that?
You act all that, girl
And it's only 'cause your ass so fat
From the front, you know what's back there
And I ain't tryna be fallin' in love
You don't even know me enough
We just finished breaking up
Next week, end up making up
You must think I'm crazy, huh?
Callin' my phone, keep hangin' up
I don't even play with her
I'll leave her like shakin' off

Why you gotta act like that?
Just keep it real (yeah)
Just say how you feel, yeah
Why you gotta act like that? Yeah
I'm the reason why your ass is fat, yeah
I paid a bag for that, yeah

I ain't wanna fall in love with it
I admit it, I ain't never wanna fuck with it
Tellin' me a lot of lies, that was wrong of you (wrong)
You was tellin' me I'm chillin' with the wrong niggas, hah
Fuck that, I'ma ride with my niggas
If the opps slide, I'ma spin blocks for my niggas, hah
She ain't never met a fly ass nigga like me
She ain't never met a Highbridge nigga, nah
Baby, you ain't never fallen with a dawg
So what's up? I'll make you fall in love with it, yeah
Make you fall right in love with it, yeah, yeah, yeah
Make you fall right in love with it, yeah, yeah, yeah
You know I keep a gun in the glove
But it's tough 'cause she hold it whenever I'm done with it, yeah, yeah
But I'm not done with it, yeah, yeah
I'll tell you when I'm done with it, yeah, yeah

Act all that, girl
And it's only 'cause your ass so fat
From the front, you know what's back there
And I ain't tryna be fallin' in love
You don't even love me enough
We just finished breaking up
Next week, end up making up

Yeah, why you gotta act like that? Yeah
Just keep it real, yeah
Just say how you feel, yeah
Why you gotta act like that? Yeah
I'm the reason why your ass is fat, yeah
I paid that bag for that
