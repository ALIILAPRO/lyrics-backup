		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't listen to these stupid songs
'Cause they all remind me that you're gone
I'm still sleeping in your favorite tee
Pictures I just can't delete
Don't know how to be, how to be alone

If I can't live without you, I can't live at all
I'm sick of finding reasons
To feel the way I did before

I don't wanna waste another day
I don't wanna wish that you would stay
If I know I should let go
Why do I hold on to you?

I don't wanna waste another day
I don't wanna say I'm not okay
If I know I should let go
Why do I hold on to you?

Why do I hold on to you?
Why do I hold on to you?

I'm still listening to this stupid song
Like I don't know where it all went wrong
All my friends are asking where you been
Memories keep on creeping in
Don't know how to be, how to be alone, hey

I don't wanna waste another day
I don't wanna wish that you would stay
If I know I should let go
Why do I hold on to you?

I don't wanna waste another day
I don't wanna say I'm not okay
If I know I should let go
Why do I hold on to you?
Hold on to you

Why do I hold on to you?
Why do I hold on to you?

Why, oh why, do I lose my mind
When I hold on tight?
No, I don't wanna let go

Why, oh why, do I lose my mind
When I hold on tight?
No, I don't wanna let go

Why, oh why, do I lose my mind
When I hold on tight?
No, I don't wanna let go (don't wanna let go)

I don't wanna let go

I don't wanna waste another day
I don't wanna wish that you would stay
If I know I should let go
Why do I hold on to you?
I don't wanna waste another day

I don't wanna say I'm not okay
If I know I should let go
Why do I hold on to you?
