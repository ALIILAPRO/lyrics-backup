		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I go through your iPad looking for
Somethin' that I used to have
Guess I finally lost my mind (lost my mind)
I wish that I could take my number back
Go back to the place we met
Start this up a second time (second time)

You're living in a past life, twenty-five
All your friends are verified
Acting like they're first in line
I'm lookin' at your life through cellophane
Hoping things would stay the same
I was always by your side

And isn't it strange how we're strangers again?
Isn't it strange how we're strangers again?

Yeah, now we're strangers again
Yeah, now we're strangers again

You were just a downtown socialite
Ship I pass on summer nights
Shadow that I can't define
Turned into a gaslight kerosene
Love that felt like seventeen
Hurt me 'til I feel alive

I wonder who your friends are
Where you go, who you know now
You play the same card, swear to God
Do you call him?

Isn't it strange how we're strangers again?

Yeah, now we're strangers again
Yeah, now we're strangers again

You were just a downtown socialite
Ship I pass on summer nights
Shadow that I can't define
Turned into a gaslight kerosene
Love that felt like seventeen
Hurt me 'til I feel alive

Isn't it strange how we're strangers again?
Now both of us know we were better as friends
When it all, yeah, when it all falls apart
Sometimes you let go just to know where to start

Somethin' that I used to have
Somethin' that I used to have
Somethin' that I used to have

Yeah, now we're strangers again
Somethin' that I used to have

You were just a downtown socialite
Ship I pass on summer nights
Shadow that I can't define
Turned into a gaslight kerosene
Love that felt like seventeen
Hurt me 'til I feel alive
