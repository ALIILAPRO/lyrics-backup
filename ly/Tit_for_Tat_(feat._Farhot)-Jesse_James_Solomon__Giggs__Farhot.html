		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Flexin' on my ex, but I don't double back, huh
Stepped in lookin' like a hundred racks, yeah
It's the season, water on me gleamin', yeah
Niggas hatin', we got drip on tap, uh
Nonstop, ain't no dribs and drabs, hey
I'm on Cloud 9, we can't go tit for tat, huh
Flip a pack if I get sick of rap
She used to give me shade, now she give me hat
I'm in Ibiza at the villa
Can't post it on my story 
'Cause Caroline will give me flak, huh
I told my bitch cut me a bit of slack, yeah
She heard the rhythm, told me bring it back
Big Shaq, skiddy-pap, just make the rhythm slap
Jj, I'm bakin' off here, I'm just kickin' back
One bae, some tequila and bit of 'Gac
Pick your poison, we been splittin' crack

Yeah, Jesse, that was funny
That was funny, you know that
Let me tell you my story

Flexin' on my ex, but shouldn't give a fuck, yeah
'Cause I'm smellin' like a million bucks (woo)
Was in Sweden, what a lovely evenin'
They see negative, but I just see the plus
I'm with bud and he's a suss
Thirty bottles but won't see no cups
Clock the whip but they won't see no bus
Clock that hottie, nigga, she's with us (jheeze)
See the profit, nigga, that's the profit, yeah
Nigga, watch it, do not break your pocket
She stayed over, she's just gettin' off it
Brekkie, scrambled egg and chicken sausage

Hollowman and I just left the office
Countryside, I'm chillin' in the cottage
We the bosses, nigga, we the bosses
Catch me drippin', nigga, watch me drop it
2010, I dropped that, what's the gossip?
Eighteen, I'm on that chopper, shoppin'
Straight cheese, but, nigga, what's the topping? Yeah
Straight jeans and pockets got the guap in (jheeze)

Fuckin' hell
Cor blimey, H
Fuckin' banger
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
