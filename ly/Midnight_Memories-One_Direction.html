		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One, two, three

Straight off the plane to a new hotel
Just touched down, you could never tell
Ah, a big house party with a crowded kitchen
People talk (shh) but we don't listen

Tell me that I'm wrong but I do what I please
Way too many people in the Addison Lee
Now I'm at the age when I know what I need, oh, whoa

Midnight memories
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Baby, you and me
Stumblin' in the street
Singin', singin', singin', singin'
Midnight memories
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Anywhere we go, never say no
Just do it, do it, do it, do it

Five foot something with the skinny jeans
Don't look back, baby, follow me
I don't know where I'm going but I'm finding my way
Same old sh- but a different day

Tell me that I'm wrong but I do what I please
Way too many people in the Addison Lee
Now I'm at the age when I know what I need, oh, whoa

Midnight memories
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Baby, you and me
Stumblin' in the street
Singin', singin', singin', singin'
Midnight memories
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Anywhere we go, never say no
Just do it, do it, do it

You and me and all our friends
I don't care how much we spend
Baby, this is what the night is for
I know nothing's making sense
For tonight let's just pretend
I don't wanna stop so give me more

Midnight memories
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Baby, you and me (ayy)
Stumblin' in the street
Singin', singin', singin', singin'
Midnight memories
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Anywhere we go, never say no
Just do it, do it, (yeah) do it, do it
