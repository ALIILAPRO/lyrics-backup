		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you love it like I love it
And you feel what I feel inside
If you want it like I want it
Then, baby, let's get it tonight
If you feel it, say, "Hell yeah" (hell yeah)
Say, "Hell yeah" (hell yeah)
And say, "Hell yeah" (hell yeah)
This is love, this is love, this is love

Can you feel the love?
Can you feel the love?
Can you feel the love?
This is love, this is love, this is love

This is love for the beats (ayy)
Feel it in the streets (ayy)
Love for the melody, notes on the sheets (oh)
The dope crusader, funky terminator
I created me a rocket just so we could rock it later
And the way the beat is knocking
Got me feeling, alright
'Cause the DJ got me walking on the ceiling (all night)
I got a rocket for the globe (hey), bomb the disco (ah)
Filled it up with lovin', and I watch it explode

If you love it like I love it
And you feel what I feel inside (feel what I feel)
If you want it like I want it
Then, baby, let's get it tonight
If you feel it, say, "Hell yeah" (hell yeah)
Say, "Hell yeah" (hell yeah)
And say, "Hell yeah" (hell yeah)
This is love, this is love, this is love

Can you feel the love?
Can you feel the love?
Can you feel the love?
This is love, this is love, this is love

Yeah
Yeah
Yeah

This is love for the bass (ayy), and love for the treble
Love for the orchestra, violin, cello (ah)
Love for computer beats, harder than metal (ayy)
House beats housin', bouncing in the ghetto
We sip 'til we smashed up, feeling alright
And we rock the ghetto blaster, rockin' all night
I got a rocket to the globe (hey), bomb the disco (ah)
I filled it up with lovin', and I watch it explode

Yeah, baby, yeah, alright
Can you feel it?
Good God, yeah, alright

Can you feel the love?
Can you feel the love?
Can you feel the love?
This is love, this is love, this is love

This is love, this is love, this is love
This is love, this is love, this is love
This is love, this is love, this is love
This is love, this is love, this is love

Can you feel the love?
Can you feel the love?
Can you feel the love?
Can you feel the love?
Can you feel the love?
Can you feel the love?
Can you feel the love?
Can you feel the love?
