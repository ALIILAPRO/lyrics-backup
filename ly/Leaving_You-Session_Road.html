		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm watching me make a fool of myself
Silently speaking my wish to be free
Turning my world inside out
Spin my emotions building my doubt

I fed on this strangeness plain and true
But there was nothing beneathe it i knew
I see myself falling falling from grace
My life fading without a trace

I'm tired of waiting here for you
Can't waste my time, i'm leaving you

I'm watching me make a fool of myself
Silently speaking my wish to be free
Turning my world inside out
Spin my emotions building my doubt

And now that you've taken the world out of me
I'm left with my body hanging free
As lovers come and comfort me
I'm still left with my misery

I'm tired of waiting here fo you
Can't waste my time, i'm leaving you

I'm leaving youâ€¦
