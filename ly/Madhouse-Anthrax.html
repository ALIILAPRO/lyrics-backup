		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's time for your medication Mr. Brown
Mwahaha

White coats to bind me, out of control
I live alone inside my mind
World of confusion, air filled with noise
Who says that my life's such a crime?

Trapped, in this nightmare
I wish I'd wake
As my whole life begins to shake
Four walls, surround me
An empty gaze
I can't find my way out of this maze

'Cause I don't care
Fall in, fall out
Gone without a doubt, help me
I can't take the blame
They don't feel the shame

It's a madhouse
Or so they claim
It's a madhouse
Oh, am I insane?

My fears behind me, what can I do?
My dreams haunt my sleep at night
Oh no, won't learn their lesson, white fills my eyes
And only then they see the light

Trapped, in this nightmare
I wish I'd wake
Then my whole life begins to shake
Four walls, surround me
An empty gaze
I can't find my way out of this maze

'Cause I don't care
Fall in, fall out
Gone without a doubt, help me
Can't take the blame
I don't feel the shame

Cause it's a madhouse
Or so they claim
It's a madhouse
I'm insane

Trapped in this nightmare
I wish I'd wake
As my whole life begins to shake
Four walls, surround me
An empty gaze
Can't find my way out of this maze

'Cause I don't care
Fall in, fall out
Gone without a doubt, help me
Can't take the blame
They don't feel the shame

It's a madhouse
Or so they claim
It's a madhouse
I'm insane

A, a, a, a (madhouse)
Ma-a-a-adhouse 

Hahaha
