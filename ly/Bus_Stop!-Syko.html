		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bloody mess out out here in the bus stop
And your girl she's gonna give
Me that top, top, top
Drive bys on the cops pull
Up to the bus stop!
Kids were in the back you gotta floor it!
Blah blah blah you talking
All that horse shit can't win the game
Bitch boy forfeit pointing them fingers
Snitch! Couldn't never ever ever support it

Kiss on your son & your mother
Kiss on bibles so you suffer
Hear my cries and my suffer stay disguised
Stay under cover

"Allow me to introduce myself:
I am a PDQ-88b Securitron
But you can call mе Yes Man!"
"It sounds like Mr house is just plain mеan
No wonder the good guys wanna kill
Him and take his stuff"
Oh God, oh God, yes, yes, yes!

Light you up out- out- out here at the
Gas station for fun! Munchin' on
Your love & your guts yeah yeah yeah
Just give it up light it up
Spark it up bloody blunts
Yeah feel it in my lungs
Love the crunch of your bed bugs
Get your hands off of me
In my face one off killing spree talk shit
I talk third degree it's real
It's concrete crucify
Yeah, crucify me yeah

Got the power from the Russian caller
Yeah, yeah, hit the mile up
Yeah, fight with the boy at the bus stop
