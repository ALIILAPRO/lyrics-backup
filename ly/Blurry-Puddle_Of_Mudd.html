		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everything's so blurry
And everyone's so fake
And everybody's empty
And everything is so messed up
Pre-occupied without you
I cannot live at all
My whole world surrounds you
I stumble then I crawl

You could be my someone
You could be my scene
You know that I'll protect you
From all of the obscene
I wonder what you're doing
Imagine where you are
There's oceans in between us
But that's not very far

Can you take it all away?
Can you take it all away?
Well ya shoved it in my face
This pain you gave to me
Can you take it all away?
Can you take it all away?
Well ya shoved it in my face

Everyone is changing
There's none left that's real
To make up your own ending
And let me know just how you feel
'Cause I am lost without you
I cannot live at all
My whole world surrounds you
I stumble then I crawl

You could be my someone
You could be my scene
You know that I will save you
From all of the unclean
I wonder what you're doing
I wonder where you are
There's oceans in between us
But that's not very far

Can you take it all away?
Can you take it all away?
Well ya shoved it in my face
This pain you gave to me
Can you take it all away?
Can you take it all away?
Well ya shoved it in my face
This pain you gave to me

Nobody told me what you thought
Nobody told me what to say
Everyone showed you where to turn
Told you when to runaway
Nobody told you where to hide
Nobody told you what to say
Everyone showed you where to turn
Showed you when to runaway

Can you take it all away?
Can you take it all away?
Well ya shoved it in my face
This pain you gave to me
Can you take it all away?
Can you take it all away?
Well ya shoved it in my face
This pain you gave to me

This pain you gave to me
This pain you gave to me

Take it all
Take it all away
This pain you gave to me
Take it all away
This pain you gave to me
Take it all away
This pain you gave to me
