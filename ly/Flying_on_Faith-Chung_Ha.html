		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're exactly what you're meant to be
Oh no, there ain't nothing wrong with you
I lift you up so that you can see
Oh what your ex has done to you

I always treat you different
So why are you judging me, baby
I think the scars are healin' then
Oh but the feelings back again

I'm out of luck, out of time, I've been out of my mind
Now you left but you still can't leave her behind
When I'm speaking in a voice that you hear isn't mine
You said gimme some time can't you see that I'm trying
She keeps weighing us down
I keep wondering if you wanna stay
Can't seem to get us off the ground
But I keep trying to fly on faith

No matter what you say, you got me flying on faith yeah
No matter what you say, you got me flying on faith

I let you tell me what's wrong with me
Oh when I don't take it out on you
But when I tell you what's wrong with you
Oh boy, you always got an attitude

I always treat you different
So why are you judging me baby
I think the scars are healing then
Oh but the feelings back again

I'm out of luck, out of time, I've been out of my mind
Now you left but you still can't leave her behind
When I'm speaking in a voice that you hear isn't mine
You said gimme some time can't you see that I'm trying
She keeps weighing us down
I keep wondering if you wanna stay
Can't seem to get us off the ground
But I keep trying to fly on faith

No matter what you say, you got me flying on faith yeah
No matter what you say, you got me flying on faith

I'm out of luck, out of time, I've been out of my mind
Now you left but you still can't leave her behind
When I'm speaking in a voice that you hear isn't mine
You said gimme some time can't you see that I'm trying
She keeps weighing us down
I keep wondering if you wanna stay
Can't seem to get us off the ground
But I keep trying to fly on faith

No matter what you say, you got me flying on faith yeah
No matter what you say, you got me flying on faith

No matter what you say, you got me flying on faith yeah
No matter what you say, you got me flying on faith
