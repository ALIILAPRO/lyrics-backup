		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Before we knew what we were missing
Before we felt desire's sting
We were content with what we had
And never wanted for anything

We know it's futile to compare
Our culture was the culprit, we were taken unaware

Manifest the weakness, a self-fulfilling prophecy
Undermining every insecurity

It's a fear growing deeper when no one's around
Like a nagging aching sore
The devil's in the detail, the truth inconsequential
The idle mind is scrutinised and robbed of its potential in time
Begging for redemption
Pleading for solutions

We know we never should have had this cross to bear
Our culture was the culprit, we were taken unaware

We've been led to think we needed more
(Resenting who we are)
Only to find that we were better off before
(Before we bought what we were sold
Before we tried to fit the mould)

We've been chasing false perfection
Searching in the wrong direction
This is the crux of our corruption
Drawn into social seduction

Manifest the weakness, a self-fulfilling prophecy
Undermining every insecurity

To fan the flame, to watch your pride burn away
To reinforce the fear that taught us that we're never good enough

We've been chasing false perfection
Searching in the wrong direction
This is the crux of our corruption
Drawn into social seduction
