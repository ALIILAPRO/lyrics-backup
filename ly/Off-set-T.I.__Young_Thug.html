		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey say man, hey say man
I bet you diamond to dog shit
Nigga you can't get lost soon as I get strapped homie
You fuckin' with the right one
Bank rolls on deck, it's the game nigga

You catch me riding foreign shit Off-set
Car ain't even out yet
Big tool long clip, you know you ain't 'bout that
Bankroll mafia, can't believe you bought that
Automatic long clip, you know you ain't 'bout that

Better listen so you heard what I said, hoe nigga
Better known that I was going before they said go nigga
Try to cross the line, be a dead hoe nigga
Give a damn if you wearin' blue or red, hoe nigga
Listen, I ain't really much for the convo
I'm finna bring the drama to your front door
R.I.P. Nando, shout out to Fernando
Well give the keys to me here, andale pronto

Turn up out through the night
Fucking little mama right
Hey, black diamonds like a night
100k, I'm precise
No hater, I ain't throwin' rights
Hey, took what the fuck you say

You catch me riding foreign shit Off-set
Car ain't even out yet
Big tool long clip, you know you ain't 'bout that
Bankroll mafia, can't believe you bought that
Automatic long clip, you know you ain't 'bout that

Pussy nigga know a nigga spend it
Pussy nigga know a nigga never ride rentals
100 thousand, Chevelle
Nigga havin' hoes, hoes, hoes sounding ill (main bitch)
Nigga, I'mma keep it trill
I could never tell, I'mma make bail
Fuck, so many rats, I can't feel
Add the Coca Cola take away some of the pills

Make plays everyday?
Still get money out the bitches
Every hoe look away, catch whiplash
Still got the K in the whip stashed
Cut me wrong got your [?] dead
Bodybag, nigga you ain't gotta ask
You probably mad cause I hit and I came back
Hit her again, hit her friend
Then I'm in a win

You catch me riding foreign shit Off-set
Car ain't even out yet
Big tool long clip, you know you ain't 'bout that
Bankroll mafia, can't believe you bought that
Automatic long clip, you know you ain't 'bout that

Difference between me and you
Is you shoot and I aim for the body bag
I'm the same nigga that tell a lil bitch that they gon' have to show us that
You the same nigga that take out your pictures when choppers get (?)
You guys are fuck niggas so therefore I pop 'em off
Pop 'em off, pop 'em off
The beef I just cooked and just turned into Stroganoff
Belly of the beast, I was raised in that
Now I'm riding with a beauty with amazing hair
Kids ride past my house, say the king's in there
I'll make your head disappear like Malaysian Air)

(Hell nah Thugger, we gotta cut that shit out)

You catch me riding foreign shit Off-set
Car ain't even out yet
Big tool long clip, you know you ain't 'bout that
Bankroll mafia, can't believe you bought that
Automatic long clip, you know you ain't 'bout that
