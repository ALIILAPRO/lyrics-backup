		  (Great John on the beat, by the way)
Look

Brand new whip, I race it, huh
Bad bitch with me, no basic, huh
Still keep chops, got cases, huh
I can't let a nigga take me out
Watch how I run up a check, huh
I bet they love me to death, huh
Watch how I run up a check, huh
I bet they love me to death, huh
Ooh-ooh, pop Perkies, not Xans, huh
Glock up on my hip, I bet this chopper make 'em dance, ayy
Hol' on, huh, these Versaces, not Vans
Lil' bitch gon' make it shake, she say, "It's jelly, not jam"
Oh, woah, she wanna keep me alone, huh
She wanna get in my zone
She don't know I know she fuckin' the bros
She out in Miami, she drivin' the boat, huh
You can't say I ever fold, huh, you can't say I ever told
Ride with my niggas, put that on my soul
Push to start, my car, huh, Moncler kept me warm
Bro got chops the size your arms
Two gun charges on my dome, huh
Pray my lawyer keep me home, huh
This your shawty favorite song, huh
She gon' lick it when you gone, huh
(She gon' lick it when you gone, huh)
Ocean on my neck, I'm drownin' shit, huh
Benny just drowned the wrist
And I got up 'cause I was down and shit, huh
Ain't have a pot to piss
But they gon' act like they don't know, huh
They gon' miss me when I'm gon', huh
They gon' miss me when I'm gon', huh
(They gon' miss me when I'm gon', huh)
Look, trap got lit, look, and we used to sleep in that shit
Money maker do a thousand tricks
And I get money so she wildin' shit, huh
I bet they proud of the kid, huh, wanna be down with the kid
Flex, I know niggas hate on the kid 
Sex, your bitch wanna rape on the kid, uh
I bet they love me, I bet they love me now, uh
When shit got ugly, ain't no one help me out, uh
I bet they love me, I bet they love me now, uh
When shit got ugly, ain't no one help me out
Trappin' out the same sweater, uh
You know Sleepy do it better, uh
You know he a big stepper, uh
Ride with choppers, that's forever, uh
Mama said you gotta change, life
So I left and made a change, right
Got the gang right
