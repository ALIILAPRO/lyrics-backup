		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Your dreams came true

Taste it to know right off the beg
Uninvited but I found a girl and you're
Your dreams, your dreams came true
Nothin' compares no worries

To know right up the beg
Uninvited but I found a girl and you're
Your dreams, your dreams came true
Nothin' compares no worries

Get the bomb back
Get the bomb back
Get the bomb back
Get the bomb back
Get the bomb back
Get the bomb back
Get the bomb back
Get the bomb back
Get the bomb back
Get the bomb back
Get the bomb back

And that your dreams came down
And that your dreams came down
Settle down, dreams heard (invited by your)
Settle down, dreams heard
And that your dreams came down
And that your dreams came down
Settle down, dreams heard (invited by your)
Nothin' compares no worries

Get the bomb back
Get the bomb back
Get the bomb back
Get the bomb back
Get the bomb back
Get the bomb back
Get the bomb back
Get the bomb back
Get the bomb back
Get the bomb back
Get the bomb back

Taste it to know right off the beg
Uninvited but i found a girl and you're
Your dreams, your dreams came true
Nothin' compares no worries

And that your dreams came down
And that your dreams came down
Settle down (settle down)
Dreams heard invited by your
Nothin' compares no worries

Bomb back, no worries
Get the bomb back, no worries
Get the bomb back, no worries
Get the bomb back, no worries
Nothin' compares, no worries
Nothin' compares, no worries
Nothin' compares, no worries
Nothin' compares, no worries
