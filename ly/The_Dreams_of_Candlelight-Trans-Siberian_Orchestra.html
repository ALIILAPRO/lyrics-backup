		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Could this night it last forever
Every moment held together
As if in a perfect trance
And such a thing could be

No one else would understand it
We would know the gods had planned it
And for such a night as this
That they gave memory

And we would live inside this night
Within the dreams of candlelight
If you would bring this wish to life
And spend this night with me

Could this moment last forever
And this dream our one endeavor
If the stars would just enchant
And time would then agree

Every moment of tomorrow
From this evening we would borrow
If this wish the stars would grant
And gently oversee

And we would live inside this night
Within the dreams of candlelight
If you would bring this wish to life
And spend this night with me
