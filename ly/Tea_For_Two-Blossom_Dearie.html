		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm discontented
With homes that are rented
So I have invented my own

Darling this place is
A lover's oasis
Where life's weary chase is unknown

Far from the cry of the city
Where flowers pretty
Caress the streams

Cozy to hide in
To live side by side in
Don't let it abide in my dreams

Picture me upon your knee
With tea for two 
And two for tea
Me for you 
And you for me
Alone

Nobody near us
To see us or hear us
No friends or relations
On weekend vacations

We won't have it known
That we own
A telephone

Day will break
And you'll awake
And I will bake
A sugar cake
For you to take
For all the boys to see

We will raise a family
A boy for you and a girl for me
Can't you see
How happy we would be?
