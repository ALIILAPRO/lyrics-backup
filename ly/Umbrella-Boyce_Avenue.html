		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You had my heart, and we'll never be worlds apart
Maybe in magazines, but you'll still be my star
Baby, 'cause in the dark you can't see shiny cars
And that's when you need me there
With you I'll always share, because...

When the sun shine we'll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'mma stick it out 'til the end
But now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have eachother
And you can stand under my umbrella

You can stand under my umbrella
Ella ella yay eh eh
Under my umbrella
Ella ella eh yay eh eh
Under my umbrella
Under my umbrella

These fancy things will never come in between
You're apart of my entity, here for infinity
When the war has took his part
When the world has delt it's card
If the hand is hard together we'll mend your heart, now because...

When the sun shine we'll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'mma stick it out 'til the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have eachother
And you can stand under my umbrella

You can stand under my umbrella
Ella ella eh eh eh
Under my umbrella
Ella ella eh eh yay eh
Under my umbrella
Under my umbrella

You can run into my arms
It's okay, don't be alarmed
Come into me
There's no distance in between our love
So gonna let the rain pour
I'll be all you need and more, because...

When the sun shine we'll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'mma stick it out 'til the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have eachother
Well, you can stand under my umbrella

Oh no, it's raining
Oh baby, it's raining
Oh baby, come into me
Come into me

Oh, it's raining
Oh baby, it's raining
Oh, come into me
Come into me
