		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The chimes of time ring out the news, another day is through
Someone slipped and fell, was that someone you?
You may have longed for added strength your courage to renew
Do not be disheartened, I have news for you
It is no secret what God can do
What he's done for others he'll do for you
With arms wide open, he'll pardon you
It is no secret what God can do

There is no night for in his light you'll never walk alone
You'll always feel at home, wherever you may roam
There is no power can conquer you while God is on your side
Take him at his promise, don't run away and hide
It is no secret what God can do
What he's done for others he'll do for you
With arms wide open he'll pardon you
It is no secret what God can do
