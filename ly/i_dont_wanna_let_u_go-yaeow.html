		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'll try my best to live without you
It's like you're already gone
But you're still in my arms
Yeah best to live without you
Oh I want to hold on
But you tell me I should
Try my best to live without you
It's like you're already gone
But you're still in my arms
Yeah best to live without you
Oh I want to hold on
But you tell me I should let you
Go
But I don't wanna let you
Go
I'm running against the tide
And it feels like I'm drowning in my mind
I don't feel alive
And I'm not sure what it's like
To lose someone I love in my life
I wonder if I'll be alright
But i'll try my best to live without you
It's like you're already gone
But you're still in my arms
Yeah best to live without you
Oh I want to hold on
But you tell me I should let you
Go
But I don't wanna let you
Go
I'll try my best to live without you
It's like you're already gone
But you're still in my arms
Yeah best to live without you
Oh I want to hold on
But I know that i should let you go
