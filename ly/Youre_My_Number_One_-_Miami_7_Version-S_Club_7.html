		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh ho, yeah yeah
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na na

What is love, 'cause baby I don't know
I got a funny feeling in my heart
If this is love it feels like butterflies
So tell me baby is this how it starts

I know I've never felt like this before
You're like a drug you got me wanting more
I've got to let you know, I've got to let you know

You're, you're my number one
I'd do anything for you
Catch the rain from the sky, even hold back the tide for you
Baby baby, you're, you're my number one (my number one)
With you I know I belong
I put the radio on and it's always playing our song

Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na na na

Tell me what, what have I gotta do
'Cause I wanna lay a claim on you
To make you mine for now and for all time
So tell me baby what I gotta do

I know I've never felt like this before
You're like a drug you got me wanting more
I've got to let you know I've got to let you know

You're, you're my number one (my number one)
I'd do anything for you
Catch the rain from the sky, even hold back the tide for you
Baby baby, you're, you're my number one
With you I know I belong
I put the radio on and it's always playing our song

And there ain't nothing I won't do
Oh, I'd walk on water just to be with you

Ooh
Oh, baby baby, you're, you're my number one (you're my number one)
I'd do anything for you
Catch the rain from the sky, even hold back the tide for you
Baby baby, you're (you are, you are), you're my number one (you're my number one)
With you I know I belong
I put the radio on and it's always playing our song

You're, you're my number one (you're my number one)
I'd do anything for you (oh)
