		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Listen to the girl
As she takes on half the world
Moving up and so alive
In her honey dripping beehive
Beehive
It's good, so good, it's so good
So good

Walking back to you
Is the hardest thing that
I can do
That I can do for you
For you

I'll be your plastic toy
I'll be your plastic toy
For you

Eating up the scum
Is the hardest thing for
Me to do

Just like honey 
Just like honey 
Just like honey 
Just like honey 
Just like honey 
Just like honey 
Just like honey 
Just like honey 
Just like honey 
Just like honey 
Just like honey 
Just like honey 
Just like honey 
Just like honey 
Just like honey 
Just like honey
(Just like honey)
