		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When you start to take a look within
Do you feel at ease with what you see?
Do you think you can have peace of mind
And have self belief or be satisfied?

Do you even think you like yourself
Or really think you could be someone else?
Is there something that you'd rather be?
Never thought you'd be, had the chance to see

All my life I've run away
All my life I've tried to hide away

Feel the paranoia creepin' in
Like a cancer eatin' at the skin
Do you think you've lost your self esteem
And your self respect, what can you expect?

All my life I've run away
All my life I've tried to hide away
All my life I've run away
All my life I've tried to hide away

All my life I've run astray
Let my faith slip away
All my life I've run astray
Allowed my faith to drift away

All my life I've run astray
Let my faith slip away
All my life I've run astray
Allowed my faith to drift away

Are you scared to look inside your mind?
Are you worried just at what you'll find?
Do you really wanna face the truth?
Does it matter now, what have you got to lose?

Try to release the anger from within
Forgive yourself a few immortal sins
Do you really care what people think?
Are you strong enough to release the guilt?

All my life I've run away
All my life I've tried to hide away

All my life I've run astray
Let my faith slip away
All my life I've run astray
Allowed my faith to drift away

All my life I've run astray
Let my faith slip away
All my life I've run astray
Allowed my faith to drift away
