		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I might lose my mind
Wakin' when the sun's down
Ridin' all these highs
Waitin' for the comedown
Walk these streets with me
I'm doin' decently
Just glad that I can breathe
Yeah

I'm tryin' to realize
It's alright to not be fine
On your own

Now I'm shakin', drinkin' all this coffee
These last few weeks have been exhausting
I'm lost in my imagination
And there's one thing that I need from you

Can you come through?
Through
Through, yeah
And there's one thing that I need from you
Can you come through?

Ain't got much to do
Too old for my hometown
Went to bed at noon
Couldn't put my phone down
Scrollin' patiently
It's all the same to me
Just faces on a screen
Yeah

I'm tryin' to realize
It's alright to not be fine
On your own

Now I'm shakin', drinkin' all this coffee
These last few weeks have been exhausting
I'm lost in my imagination
And there's one thing that I need from you

Can you come through?
Through
Through, yeah
And there's one thing that I need from you
Can you come through?
Through
Through, yeah
And there's one thing that I need from you
Can you come through?

Yas, baby
That's the one, baby
Where you goin', dude?
