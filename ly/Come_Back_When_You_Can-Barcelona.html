		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been led on
To think that we've been
Trying for too long
Every time we drift
Were forcing what is wrong
At last that voice is gone
Please take your time
But you've got to know that
I am taking sight
Oh, you look good
With your patient face and wandering eye
Don't hold this war inside

Whoa
Come back when you can
Whoa
Let go, you'll understand
You've done nothing at all, to make me love you less
Whoa
So come back when you can
You left your home
You're so far from
Everything you know
Your big dream is
Crashing down and out your door
Wake up and dream once more

Whoa
Come back when you can
Whoa
Let go, you'll understand
You've done nothing at all to make me love you less
Whoa
So come back when you can
Whoa
Come back, I'll help you stand
Whoa
Let go and hold my hand
If all you wanted was me, I'd give you nothing less
Whoa
So come back when you can
