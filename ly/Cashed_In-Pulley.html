		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  For what it's worth, I've walked miles
And I've seen the sun go down.
Played my share of dues,
Yet you still want to put me down..
Started on the bottom tell me
Why I feel here again.
It was at my expense, now you're cashing in.
Make way for the boys in your town today,
Dig in your pockets, they've got a lot to say.
Look up on the wall,
They'll have some shirts for sale.
Another week has passed
Can you keep up with the brand new scene,
The music's changing
With the constant tapping of my feet.
Play it faster, play it slower,
You still don't know,
The music's not so important to you,
It's what you're makin' off the show.
Starting from the bottom again.
