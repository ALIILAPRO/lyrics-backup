Just play it, you feel it,

Just play it, you feel it,
you've get it ... Explosion, explosion,explosion. 
Just play it, you feel it,
you've get it ... Explosion, explosion,explosion. 

Na-haaa 
Aaaaaaaaa ... 
Explosion ... Na-haaa 

Just play it, you feel it,
you've get it ... Explosion, explosion,explosion. 
Just play it, you feel it,
you've get it ... Explosion, explosion,explosion. 
Just play it, you feel it,
you've get it ... Explosion, explosion,explosion. 
Just play it, you feel it,
you've get it ... Explosion, explosion,explosion. Na-haaa 

Explosion ... 
Aaaaaaaaa ... 
Explosion. Na-haaa. 
Explosion. Na-haaa.
