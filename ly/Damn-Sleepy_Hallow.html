		  (Great John on the beat, by the way)

I'm tryna vibe with it
I'm tryna slide with it
Shit so good, might dive in it
Jump in that water, I'm diving in it
Heartbroken, baby, I'ma fix it
And I love when she rocking my fitted
I can't lie, I've been getting addicted
Don't know what hit her, I told her a dick did
Baby uh, wait, baby uh, damn, baby uh, hold on, uh
Baby uh, damn, baby uh, wait, baby uh, damn, uh
Baby uh, hold on, baby uh, yeah

Tell your friends they should mind they business
Like why do they care if we did it?
Why do they care if we fuckin'?
Why do they care if we kissin'?
Uh, can we kick it, I don't care if we stay in the trenches
I don't care if we get us a telly
Somewhere that nobody gon' give us attention
Wait, they not fucking with me
I'ma oot if I catch me a G
Lil bro still duckin' the D's
I told him "Go harder, ain't nothin' for free"
They can't wait 'til they run into me
I'm like fuck it, one day I'ma see like
Like I should go fuck on her friend
But my new bitch way too elite
I just been missing my Benz
I don't like the way the Lamb speed
She a baddie and her friend a ten
That's some fries with a twenty piece like
She tryna uh, wait, she wanna uh, damn
She tryna uh, hold on, she wanna uh, damn
She tryna uh, wait, she wanna uh, hold on
She tryna uh, damn, damn, damn

I'm tryna vibe with it, with it
I'm tryna slide with it
Shit so good, might dive in it
Jump in that water, I'm diving in it
Heartbroken, baby, I'ma fix it
And I love when she rocking my fitted
I can't lie, I've been getting addicted
Don't know what hit her, I told her a dick did
Baby uh, wait, baby uh, damn, baby uh, hold on, uh
Baby uh, damn, baby uh, wait, baby uh, damn, uh
Baby uh, hold on, baby uh, yeah
