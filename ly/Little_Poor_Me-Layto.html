		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I tried hard, you know I care i care, I care
Just a little poor me, ee-ee
Just a little poor me

Mirror, mirror on the wall
I'll make sure you crack and fall
I made strides, don't call me sweet
Chaos organizes me
I can see you're wondering, oh why?
(Oh, it's such distaste)
When I'm with you, I crumble alive
(I have to leave this place)

I'm gone (Hey) not goin' home
Going down that lonely road whoa oh oh ooh
It's too bad I'll never be back (Oh oh)
I can't tell you what I feel inside
(What I feel inside)
This feeling burns inside my mind
Just a little poor me

I tried hard, you know I cared
Thousand yards, embrace that stare
Manic days, I know you know
You'd get high while I'd be low
I can sense you're trembling inside
(Oh, that spiteful face)
Certain things you just can never buy
(Things you'll always chase)

I'm gone (Hey) not goin' home
Going down that lonely road whoa oh oh ooh
It's too bad I'll never be back (Oh oh)
I can't tell you what I feel inside
(What I feel inside)
This feeling burns inside my mind
Just a little poor me

This is not what I want
Becomin' to someone I'm not
Disaster, pressure it mounts
Faster, master, please just let me move on
Just let me move on come on
It's not like I'm wrong
Sheddin' a tear with the pain
A month or a day the game I can't play
Typical time to move on
You know I'm not wrong (Hey) all for not
The me that you thought
The one who you sought
I'm not the kind of kid to point to a map
Who runs at a snap
I'm trapped, I'm trapped yes sir, no sir
Not for me i'd rather spend it all
So you can see
What freedom's really worth to me
One, two, three (Set me free)

I'm gone (Hey) not goin' home
Going down that lonely road whoa oh oh ooh
It's too bad I'll never be back (Oh oh)
I can't tell you what I feel inside
(What I feel inside)
This feeling burns inside my mind
Just a little poor me

I tried hard, you know I care i care, I care
Just a little poor me, ee-ee
Just a little poor me
