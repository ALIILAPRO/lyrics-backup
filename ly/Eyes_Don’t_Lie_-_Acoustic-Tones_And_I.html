		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Eyes don't lie
Eyes don't lie
Eyes don't lie

Heard you tried to sell your soul to another
Heard you tried to dance around 
With flames are made from angels undercover 
But I see the way your face just changed 
As if you lost a lover
Did you lose a lover? Oh 

And I know the story goes 
You say you really tried, you didn't try at all
So now you hate the world
It hates you back is your excuse to fall
You say you're dead inside 
So you decide to cut off everyone 
Cut off everyone

Are you a stranger? (Are you a stranger?)
But you seem so familiar 
It's hard to explain, yeah (it's hard to explain, yeah)
From what I can see, from what I can see
And maybe I'm broken 
But my arms are wide open for ya 
And you'll never know it, but you're just like me
From what I can see

Heard you try to place the blame on your brother
Heard it's everybody else's fault 
You're home alone, inside for summer
Now you can't deny the times you lied and cried, you missed your mother
Cried and missed your mother, oh

And I know the story goes 
You say you really tried, you didn't try at all
So now you hate the world
It hates you back is your excuse to fall
You say you're dead inside 
So you decide to cut off everyone 
Cut off everyone

Are you a stranger? (Are you a stranger?)
But you seem so familiar 
It's hard to explain, yeah (it's hard to explain, yeah)
From what I can see, from what I can see
And maybe I'm broken 
But my arms are wide open for ya 
And you'll never know it, but you're just like me
From what I can see

Eyes don't lie
Eyes don't lie
Eyes don't lie
Eyes don't lie

Are you a stranger? (Are you a stranger?)
But you seem so familiar 
It's hard to explain, yeah (it's hard to explain, yeah)
From what I can see, from what I can see
And maybe I'm broken 
But my arms are wide open for ya 
And you'll never know it, but you're just like me
From what I can see (eyes don't lie)
