		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got some niggas upstairs
I hope in peace they be restin'
Got some niggas upstairs
I hope in peace they be restin’
To talk to god, you know that's my pleasure
Bitches trying to give me head, 'fore I ’em
You be talking too much, you confessin'
I'm 'on bust that nigga, bust his vessel
Crack a, crack a head yeah he test me
You don't want to leave the scene too messy

Money be the mantra, double the entendre
He just like to conquer, papa he don't ponder
On they ass like huggies
Nasty don't fuck ugly
Waggin' like a puppy, soon as he touch money
We’re hot like sauna, happy so why bother
Lookin’ like a fossil, chippin'
He chip tonsils
Lower like a futon, stood on what I grew on
Bruiser what I blew on
One up a sum I knew on out of my mind
I don’t give a fuck if it's glued on
Keep two left shoes on
Wouldn't give the game away
It's like teaching a newborn

I got too much game it’s spillin' out
They drop you in the hood
What you gon' do about it
Helicopter drop you in the hood
What you do about it?
I got too much game, fuck, shawty
It's spillin' out me
I got too much game it's spillin' out
Drop you in the hood
What you gon' do about it?
You can't survive in the jungle
You a baller but you fumbled
Rocking in the rumble
Been here like a fungus

In the hood getting it how I want to
You don't wanа the problem
Hit you with a tonka
Yeah, you hard the mantra
Spill you and your mama
Flow wet like barnacles
Shipping out some parcels
Pocket full of parsley
You ain't getting it hardly
I don't do the larceny, ima get it up off me
I swear these niggas look like licks
They look like frosties
