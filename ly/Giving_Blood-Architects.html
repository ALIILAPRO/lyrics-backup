		  The Gospel, distorted
It leaves my blood running cold
But still they say
I'm rigging the ritual

I never said that I was giving blood for the unbelievers
Bleeding out like a devil in disguise
They shot a hole in the parachute
'Cause I'd rather feel alive

It's so convoluted
They're just trepanning for gold
May they rest in peace
'Cause they're fucking dead to me

Well there's your eulogy
The water's polluted
My feathers caught in the spill
Nobody said that it would be safe up here

I never said that I was giving blood for the unbelievers
Bleeding out like a devil in disguise
They shot a hole in the parachute
'Cause I'd rather feel alive

Your salvation's a letdown
Ooh-ooh
Oh, I'm sorry that I'd rather feel
I'd rather feel alive

It leaves a mark on the mind
It weaves a web in the background
Silently
No time to spare
No sign of the exit wound
God help me
There's no drying off
Once you're soaked right down to the bone
Hopefully
Somebody thinks of me in the aftermath
Woe is me

It leaves a mark on the mind
It weaves a web in the background
Silently
No time to spare
No sign of the exit wound
God help me
There's no drying off
Once you're soaked right down to the bone
Hopefully
Somebody thinks of me in the aftermath
Woe is me

Woe is me
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry

I never said that I was giving blood for the unbelievers
Bleeding out like a devil in disguise
They shot a hole in the parachute
'Cause I'd rather feel alive

Your salvation's a letdown
Ooh-ooh
Oh, I'm sorry that I'd rather feel
I'd rather feel alive
