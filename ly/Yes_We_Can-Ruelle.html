		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Follow the arrow that points to your heart
Open the door and step out of the dark (See the light, see the light, see the light, yeah) Rivers to cross and there's mountains to climb
There's not a peak or a summit too high (we will rise, we will rise, we will rise, yeah)

Come together our voice like a thunder oh There's no stopping the sound
Light the fire, the whole world can follow us Let the echo ring out
We can do anything now (yeah yeah yeah) Turning the world upside down (yeah yeah yeah) We can do anything now
Yes we can, yes we can, yes we can
Yes we can, yes we can
Turning the world upside down
Yes we can, yes we can, yes we can
Yes we can, yes we can
We can do anything now
Give me the map and I'll give you the keys
The higher we go, yeah the more we are free (so alive, so alive, so alive, yeah)
This is the moment, the time of our lives
You won't believe what we can do when we try yeah (we can fly, we can fly, we can fly, yeah)
We can do anything now (yeah yeah yeah) Turning the world upside down (yeah yeah yeah) We can do anything now
Yes we can, yes we can, yes we can Yes we can, yes we can
Turning the world upside down
Yes we can, yes we can, yes we can Yes we can, yes we can
We can do anything now
