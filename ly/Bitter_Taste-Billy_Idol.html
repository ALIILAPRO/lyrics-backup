		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The bitter taste on my tongue
Too many holes, the damage done
It's bittersweet, black on gold
Talk is cheap, or so I'm told

I'm gonna ride this bike to the edge of town
Roll to the bridge with my eyes shut
And spit at the stars
And scream in the dark
There's nothing I can do to change it now
But if I cut myself open, baby
You can read all my scars
Read all my scars

Hello, goodbye
There's a million ways to die
Should've left me way back
Should've left me way back
By the roadside
Hello, goodbye
I was staring in the devil's eyes
Should've left me way back
Should've left me way back
By the roadside

It's a bitter taste

Jagged stain on my skin
Broken leg, born again
Wide glide, upside down
Twisted frame, my new crown

I'm gonna ride this bike 'til the break of day
Rolling through the garden like the fountain
Won't take it away
I'm not gonna change
I'm gonna live so hard, these broken wings
Will lift me to the sun so I can burn
Up in the flames
Again and again

Hello, goodbye
There's a million ways to die
Should've left me way back
Should've left me way back
By the roadside
Hello, goodbye
I was staring in the devil's eyes
Should've left me way back
Should've left me way back
By the roadside

It's a bitter taste
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
It's a jagged stain
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
It's a bitter taste
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
It's a jagged stain
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)

Hello, goodbye
There's a million ways to die
Should've left me way back
Should've left me way back
By the roadside

It's a bitter taste
