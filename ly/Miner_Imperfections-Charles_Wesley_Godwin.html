		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  He wasn't one to talk much when we'd pull off to school
I could never tell what's running through his mind
It'd be three more hours until those halls were full
But long walls don't run on nine to five

I didn't get it then, every day that man would fight
To punch the clock and make it home alive

He's got miner imperfections
Blame it on his roots
Calluses on his hands, coal dust on his boots
He's not one for conversation when there's work to do
Papaw said get paid in cash
Company script's a noose
Them city folks would shame him if he let them
But he's proud of his miner imperfections

Years went by and I grew up
His brown hair faded white
He somehow picks up every time I called
Moved me in and bailed me out
And shared all he knows about
Like how to pair a diamond to a girl
His hard edges cut me deep when I was just a boy
I saw his face light up when those grandchildren were born

He's got miner imperfections
Blame it on his roots
Calluses on his hands, coal dust on his boots
He's not one for conversation when there's work to do
He told me do what you love
Misery's a noose
Them city folks would shame him if he let them
But I'm proud of his miner imperfections

I don't mine low coal but my collar's still stained blue
My kids look up at me the way I looked at him
For those little ones there's nothing I won't do
I hope one day they can understand

I've got miner imperfections
I'm proud of my roots
Calluses on my hands, singing to a room
I'm not one for conversation when I've got work to do
I tell my kids do what you love
Your papaw told me too
Them city folks try to shame me now and then, don't mind them
I'm proud of my miner imperfections
I'm proud of my miner imperfections
