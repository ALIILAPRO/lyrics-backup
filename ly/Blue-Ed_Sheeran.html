		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, it took a while to read the signs
But she used to be a friend of mine
Leading forward but fell behind
Loneliness redefined

Over and all of above I hope for
Happiness is all you know, but
I can't help but holding on, on

Silence is never golden
Quietly stuck in the moment
I'm not over you
I'll be forever lonely
Silence ain't golden
You know that it's only blue
Blue
It's only blue
Blue

Oh, I missed the mark a hundred times
Tried to take it back and change the night
Yeah, we used to set the dream alive
'Til the day it sunk and slowly died

Over and all of above I hope for
Happiness is all you know, but
I can't help but holding on, on

Silence is never golden
Quietly stuck in the moment
I'm not over you
I'll be forever lonely
Silence ain't golden
You know that it's only blue
Blue
It's only blue
Blue
It's only blue
