		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My blood brother is an immigrant
A beautiful immigrant

My blood brother's Freddie Mercury
A Nigerian mother of three

He's made of bones, he's made of blood
He's made of flesh, he's made of love
He's made of you, he's made of me
Unity

Fear leads to panic, panic leads to pain
Pain leads to anger, anger leads to hate
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Danny Nedelko

My best friend is an alien (I know him, and he is)
My best friend is a citizen
He's strong, he's earnest, he's innocent

My blood brother is Malala
A Polish butcher, he's Mo Farah

He's made of bones, he's made of blood
He's made of flesh, he's made of love
He's made of you, he's made of me
Unity

Fear leads to panic, panic leads to pain
Pain leads to anger, anger leads to hate
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ah, ah, ah, ah

The M, the U, the N, the I, the T
The Y, the S, the O, the F, the U
The C, the K, the Y, the O and the U
And you, and you, and you

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Danny Nedelko
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ah, ah, ah, ah
