		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And another one bites the dust
But why can I not conquer love?
And I might've got to be with one
I learned to fight this war without weapons
And I wanted it , I wanted it bad
But there was so many red flags
Now another one bites the dust
And let's be clear, I trust no one

You did not break me
I'm still fighting for peace

Well I've got a thick skin and an elastic heart
But your blade it might be too sharp
I'm like a rubber band, until you pull too hard
But I may snap and I move fast

But you won't see me move no more
'Cause I've got an elastic heart

I've got an elastic heart
Yeah, I've got an elastic heart

And now we stay up through the night
Let's be clear, won't close my eyes
And I know that I can't survive
I walked too far to save my life
And I want it, I want my life so bad
I'm doing everything I can
Then another one bites the dust
It's hard to lose a chosen one

You did not break me
I'm still fighting for peace

Well I've got a thick skin and an elastic heart
But your blade it might be too sharp
I'm like a rubber band, until you pull too hard
But I may snap and I move fast

But you won't see me move no more
'Cause I've got an elastic heart

Well I've got a thick skin and an elastic heart
But your blade it might be too sharp
I'm like a rubber band, until you pull too hard
But I may snap and I move fast

But you won't see me move no more
'Cause I've got an elastic heart

Well I've got a thick skin and an elastic heart
But your blade it might be too sharp
I'm like a rubber band, until you pull too hard
But I may snap and I move fast

You won't see me move no more
'Cause I've got an elastic heart

I've got an elastic heart
