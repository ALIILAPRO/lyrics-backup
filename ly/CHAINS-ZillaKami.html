		  (Yung Germ)
Yeah

Big bank truck (truck), with the piece tucked (tucked)
Big bank, what? Thirty for a feature ('ture)
Black card, metal swipin' like a visa ('sa)
You can't see us (us), you can't be us (us)
I wear big chains to choke ya out if you play me (yeah)
I wear big chains to choke ya out if you play me (yeah)
I wear big chains to choke ya out if you play me
I wear big chains to choke ya out if you play me (haha)

Ho, I'm on your street, I got the Glocky (okay)
Just in case this operation turn a little sloppy (huh?)
A bulletproof vest in case they shot me (yeah)
That's maybe why I walk around this bitch a little cocky (okay, okay)
I push your shit back, I push a nigga shit back (huh?)
Rack the glick back, give your boy a shitbag (haha)
I push your shit back, I push a nigga wig back (huh?)
It's a doggy world, you're chillin' where the kittens at (haha)
Niggas really wanna be like me and now I see (okay)
Niggas want the extendo like it's a limousine (okay)
I will really kick your door and make your ass scream (haha)
'Cause you can't be like me, your name is Timothy (yeah)

Big bank truck (truck), with the piece tucked (tucked)
Big bank, what? Thirty for a feature ('ture)
Black card, metal swipin' like a visa ('sa)
You can't see us (us), you can't be us (us)
I wear big chains to choke ya out if you play me (yeah)
I wear big chains to choke ya out if you play me (yeah)
I wear big chains to choke ya out if you play me
I wear big chains to choke ya out if you play me (haha)

Where the fuck my Glock? Extendo on the mop (yeah)
Grippin' on the pole like a mothafuckin' thot (yeah)
I might get a bag and spend it on my car, who knows? (Okay)
You the type of nigga spend your money on these hoes (okay)
Bust and then it slip, had to rubberize the grip (what?)
Bustin' on your bitch, had to bust on to her lip (yeah)
I got a couple niggas who ain't make it on this ship (okay)
Got a couple stragglers, them niggas all got snipped (huh?)
None of y'all niggas safe 'cause you woke up Godzilla (okay)
Rather fist-fight a dozen steroided gorillas (okay)
Hangin' out the whip with your homie's fuckin' killer (huh?)
With the same grip that done got that nigga did up (oh well)

Big bank truck (truck), with the piece tucked (tucked)
Big bank, what? Thirty for a feature ('ture)
Black card, metal swipin' like a visa ('sa)
You can't see us (us), you can't be us (us)
I wear big chains to choke ya out if you play me (yeah)
I wear big chains to choke ya out if you play me (yeah)
I wear big chains to choke ya out if you play me
I wear big chains to choke ya out if you play me (haha)
I wear big chains to choke ya out if you play me (yeah)
I wear big chains to choke ya out if you play me (yeah)
I wear big chains to choke ya out if you play me
I wear big chains to choke ya out if you play me (haha)
