		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Have you ever experienced the feeling
When you’re almost like floating
Your head is empty
And arms are weightless
You’re speechless and calm
Despite the fact
That you’ve done too many bad things
To confess

Help me, I’m dying
I’m all puffed and blown
I always hear words like this
When time has come
You’re sorry
You beg me
To live for some more
The punisher has no compassion
At all

Blinded by sins that you shouldn’t ignore
Preaching the people who fall even lower
Begging on knees and
Then praying for more
The punish must be paid
According to god

Do you know what sins are crawling from your back
People running from it
This is your own regret
Begging begging begging, Ow
Torture yourself to the ground

Do you know what sins are crawling from your back
People running from it
This is your own regret
Begging begging begging, Ow
Torture yourself to the ground

Father forgive for
Things I commit
There is no god
For what we believe in
There is no devil with what I’m dealing
I’m failing to pleasure you
Isn’t that thrilling?

Displeasure for breaking
Distortion for fun
This skin on me rotting
I’m peeling it off
For souls I’ve forsaken
For crimes I commit
My faith is a sin
I’m gonna admit

Do you know what sins are crawling from your back
People running from it
This is your own regret
Begging begging begging, Ow
Torture yourself to the ground

Do you know what sins are crawling from your back
People running from it
This is your own regret
Begging begging begging, Ow
Torture yourself to the ground

Do you know what sins are crawling from your back
People running from it
This is your own regret
Begging begging begging, Ow
Torture yourself to the ground

Do you know what sins are crawling from your back
People running from it
This is your own regret
Begging begging begging, Ow
Torture yourself to the ground
