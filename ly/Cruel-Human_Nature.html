		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You can say love's forever
And find it never stays
In you I've recovered
The one thing that must remain
I'm tired of a world undone
I've figured out you're my setting sun
It's cruel
The way I'm needing you
I guess I'll play the fool
It's my heart, not my mind and it's taking over
Cruel
Suddenly it's true
No longer can I choose
It's in you I'm defined and there is no other
Oh it's cruel
Oh it's cruel

I can hold back emotions
Get lost in a maze
But this urgency tells me
I just can't refrain
Dreams have come and passed me by
But now it's time to redefine (yeah)
It's cruel
The way I'm needing you
I guess I'll play the fool
It's my heart, not my mind and it's taking over
Cruel
Suddenly it's true
No longer can I choose
It's in you I'm defined and there is no other

I've seen it come and go so many times
But this is critical, the truth 
I can't hide
(can't hide)
And I don't know why

(and I don't know why, I don't know why)
Yeah, oh yeah
(so cruel)
So cruel, oh
It's cruel the way I'm loving you, oh yeah
(so cruel)
Cruel the way I'm loving you

It's cruel
The way I'm needing you
I guess I'll play the fool
(it's cruel the way I'm loving you)
(baby now I know it's true)
It's my heart, not my mind and it's taking over
Cruel
Suddenly it's true
No longer can I choose
It's in you I'm defined and there is no other
