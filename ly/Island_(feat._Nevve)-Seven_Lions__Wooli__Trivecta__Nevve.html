		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been trying to roll like
A stone into your island (Oh, oh)
But everywhere I go
Only echoes in the silence (Oh, oh)
You don't even know
You don't even show your diamonds (Oh, oh)
Where the fuck are you? Always
Leave me in the blindness

But I know it's not over feel the static
I can feel you getting closer
Send a flare to light the way
Oh, oh (Oh, mmm) oh, oh (Oh, yeah, yeah)

Holding out for you is like
A drop into the ocean (Oh, oh)
Lost between the waves, treading water
But I'm open (Oh, oh)
That you might come around
Fix the poison now, let's forget
(Oh, oh) shadows in the dark
Need your light to break 'em open

But I know it's not over feel the static
I can feel you getting closer
Send a flare to light the way oh, oh
Oh, oh way onto your island

Oh, oh oh, oh
Way onto your island (Your island)

I've been trying to roll like
A stone into your island (Oh, oh)
But everywhere I go
Only echoes in the silence (Oh, oh)
You don't even know
You don't even show your diamonds (Oh, oh)
Where the fuck are you? Always
Leave me in the blindness

But I know it's not over feel the static
I can feel you getting closer
Send a flare to light the way oh, oh
Oh, oh way onto your island

Oh, oh oh, oh
