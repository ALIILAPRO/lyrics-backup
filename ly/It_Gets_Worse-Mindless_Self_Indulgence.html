		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey, you, baby,
You don't know how bad it's gonna get.
If you think shit sucks now,
You ain't seen nothing yet.
Because it doesn't get better unless you're pretty
It doesn't get better unless you got money.
It doesn't get better, so just give up.
It never gets better, no.
It gets worse.

Oh oh oh oh oh, woo hoo hoo.
You're gonna die alone.
Oh oh oh, shit yeah.
It gets worse.

Now I'm no psychiatrist, I'm no doctor with no degrees.
But it don't take no fucking scientist to figure out that
There is nothing in this world for free.
Because it doesn't get better
Unless you're pretty
It doesn't get better, unless you got money.
It doesn't get better, so listen the fuck up!
It never gets better, it gets worse.

You're gonna die alone.
Oh oh oh shit yeah.
It gets worse.

You're going down the road, the sick one that we have.
We cannot wait to watch life kick you in your ass.
Ashamed of nothing, for all of you out there:
There's no way to escape, there's no way to escape.
Welcome to hell, welcome to hell, welcome to hell, welcome to hell.
Welcome to hell, welcome to hell.

Because it doesn't get better.
Unless you're pretty.
It doesn't get better
Unless you got money.
It doesn't get better.
So just give up.
It never gets better
It gets worse.

So long, cruel world.
Oh oh oh shit yeah.
It gets worse.
It. Gets. Worse.
