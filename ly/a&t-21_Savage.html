		  Good job 1st

(Bounce that)
Ass and titties, ass and titties (Shake that)
Ass and titties, he throw money, twenties (Bounce that)
Ass and titties (Ayy), ass and titties (Shake that)
Ass and titties (Ayy), come get savage with me

(21) If you play the paint, I'ma go for the 3 (Straight Up)
She don't dribble balls, but she good with the D
Stay in Fashion Nova 'cause she get it for free
She at home, but her Instagram location the beach
She at home bro
Ass phat, baby can I grab that? (God damn)
Booty viral, that shit need a hashtag (Yes ma'am)
She walkin' into work like where the bags at? (21, 21)
Hit a couple models, but I love the ratchets

Ass and titties, ass and titties (Shake that)
Ass and titties, he throw money, twenties (Bounce that)
Ass and titties (Ayy), ass and titties (Shake that)
Ass and titties (Ayy), come get savage with me

Where my big dick diamond rocking foreign driving niggas at? (Where they at?)
Big shit poppin', fuck that talkin', where them dollas at?
100 bad bitches in the club on some hustle shit (Yup)
If you ain't breaking bread, please don't you touch a bitch
Bills (I got bills), I gotta pay (I gotta pay)
If you gon' handle it for me, then we can play (We can play)
All depending how you spend and you can stay (You can stay)
When it's 'bout that money youngin', don't discriminate (Haha)
I don't wanna smoke yo' weed, I don't wanna meet yo' homie (nah)
We ain't gotta let me lead if you find a nigga with it on him
I'm 21 'bout it baby, I need that cash, you feel me?
So, if you ain't got that bag, don't grind my ass, you hear me?

Ass and titties, ass and titties (Shake that)
Ass and titties, he throw money, twenties (Bounce that)
Ass and titties (Ayy), ass and titties (Shake that)
Ass and titties (Ayy), come get savage with me

Drop it to the flo' after she wobble and twist (Straight up)
I like 'em natural, I don't like plastic booties and lip
Struggling strippers always tryna sneak in the VIP (21)
You didn't get no wristband, then you can't get no tip (Nope)
Got a bitch a brand new G Wagon and I snatched her stomach, she happy (She snatched)
100 racks on me, I'm sagging (Yeah)
Made it out the bottom, I'm braggin' (Straight up)
Came in the club with all that fake ass jewelry on, threw a hundred dollars, he cappin' (Cappin')
Before I walk around trying to act like I'm something I ain't, I quit rapping (On God)
I had to start selling bundles of weave, you wouldn't even get her hair done (21)
If a nigga had a chance, he'd fuck my bitch, that's why I don't even spare none (On God)
I'm so 21, I'm so 4L, play with this shit, get redrummed (Straight up)
Bullets so big, I could be in Zone 6, fuck around and hit a nigga in Belgium (21)

Ass and titties, ass and titties (Shake that)
Ass and titties, he throw money, twenties (Bounce that)
Ass and titties, ass and titties (Shake that)
Ass and titties, come get savage with me

Ass and titties, hunnids and fifties (21)
Yeah, I got a girl, don't leave no hickies (On God)
St. Laurent panties she don't wear Vicky (Straight Up)
I'm her sugar son, her sugar daddy was 50
Bounce that
Shake that, ayy
Bounce that, ayy
Shake that, ayy
Bounce that
Shake that, ayy
Bounce that, ayy
Shake that, ayy
Bounce that
