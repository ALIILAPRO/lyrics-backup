		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  City nights
Summer breeze makes you feel all right
Neon lights
Shining brightly make your brain ignite

See the girls with the dresses so tight (give you love)
Give you love if the price is right
Black or white
In the streets there's no wrong and no right, no

Outta sight
Buy your kicks from the man in the white
Feels all right
Powder pleasure in your nose tonight

See the men paint their faces and cry (like some girl)
Like some girl it makes you wonder why
City life
Sure is cool but it cuts like a knife (like a knife), it's your life

So forget all that you see
It's not reality
It's just a fantasy

Can't you see
What this crazy life is doing to me?

Life is just a fantasy
Can you live this fantasy life?
Life is just a fantasy
Can you live this fantasy life?

So forget all that you see
It's not reality
It's just a fantasy

Can't you see
What this crazy life is doing to me? Yeah

Life is just a fantasy
Can you live this fantasy life?
Life is just a fantasy
Can you live this fantasy life?

Life is just a fantasy
Can you live this fantasy life?
Life is just a fantasy
Can you live this fantasy life?
I know
I know
