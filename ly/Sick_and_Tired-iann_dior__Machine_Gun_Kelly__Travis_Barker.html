		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been losing my mind tryna figure it out
But I'm stuck in a drought
I guess I'll start again
I've been losing my mind tryna figure it out
But I'm stuck in this house
I am my only friend

Lately I know I've been a punk
And I need to sober up
Double cup it got me stuck
I think I'm losing it (yeah)
'Cause every time that I've been getting stuck (stuck)
There's a line inside my head (my head)
Of all my friends act they've been dead
Since I made it out

It's every time that you cross my mind
Remember the times, but I know that you won't ever change
I'm not sobering up, sick and tired of love
If you draw that line bae, I hope you know I'm crossing it

I've been losing my mind tryna figure it out
But I'm stuck in a drought
I guess I'll start again
I've been losing my mind tryna figure it out
But I'm stuck in this house
I am my only friend

Over and over again
It's like I never win
Why you putting me down? It don't make any sense
I'm not sober again
But I'm tryna pretend like everything's alright
But it's over with

I get drunk and interrupt
And my eyes look red because I'm mad at myself
I stabbed the opening
Lately everything I say you just tell me it's wrong
I told her I won't be here long
I can't hold it in

Every time you cross my mind
I brought another memory to keep yours inside
I saw us drown like high tide
And everything is nothing if you're not here tonight

I've been losing my mind tryna figure it out
But I'm stuck in a drought
I guess I'll start again
I've been losing my mind tryna figure it out
But I'm stuck in this house
I am my only friend

Over and over again
It's like I never win
Why you putting me down? It don't make any sense
I'm not sober again
But I'm tryna pretend like everything's alright
But it's over with
