		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's been a few years now since
I've felt an urge to roam
I been livin' up the holler
Watchin' my children grow
I'm doin' just fine keepin' my mind
A daughter ain't a worry of mine
I'm like a bull to the slaughter
A fish out of water every time
I leave the wood line

I'm lyin' low i'm lyin' low
On the north side of the
Mountain reapin' what I sow i'm lyin' low
I'm lyin' low in a better way than my
Daddy minin' thirty inch coal
I'm lyin' low

If I keep runnin' with the masses I'll
Find myself in an early casket
If there's water in the well
Don't go doin' somethin' drastic
There's fruit on my vine so bring on
The wine I got so little time
I'll take what I got
Save a few shots and stride
Out on the decline

I'm lyin' low i'm lyin' low
On the north side of the
Mountain reapin' what I sow i'm lyin' low
I'm lyin' low in a better way than my
Daddy minin' thirty inch coal
I'm lyin' low

I'm lyin' low i'm lyin' low
On the north side of the
Mountain where my ginseng grows
I'm lyin' low i'm lyin' low
In a better way than my
Daddy minin' thirty inch coal
I'm lyin' low
