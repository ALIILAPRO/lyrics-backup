		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Stare into the eyes of devastation long enough and it begins to stare back.
Brace for the impact.

Watch it burn, watch it die.
System purge, run for your lives.

Don't go outside, go find a quiet place to cry
It's judgement day, there's nowhere to hide. Everyone get in line.

Hell to pay
Bleach stains, couldn't wash away the pain you made
Blood soaking their clothes says they've got hell to pay
Rot came in waves, the carriers of the fucking plague
A fate much better than you deserve, we've got hell to pay

Blackwater up to our necks
On earth, it feels like hell
Blackwater up to our necks
When the shit hits the fan, it's every cunt for themselves.

Watch it burn, watch it die.
System purge, run for your lives.

Red bleach stains, couldn't wash away the pain you made
Blood soaking their clothes shows they've got hell to pay
I guess the meaning of life is just to dig our own graves
It's either hurt or the hearse, we have hell to pay.

Got my name in your mouth and it's becoming hard to chew,
If i'm a terrorist then what the fuck does that make you?
