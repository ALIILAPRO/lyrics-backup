		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sometimes I feel I got to (get away)
For these streets like a fein for crack
But pullin me back
Its real got a nigga goin (ooh ooh) cause no matter drama or gossip
My heart is your hood my dogs niggas I rock with (get away)
Before you get clapped put the tougnes to two loose have everybody on the corner goin (ooh ooh)
Holdin they mouth shock as fuck I just had to air that boy out (get away)
And now theres blood on my tims snitches callin 1 800 crime stoppers
When they see me they like (ooh ooh)
Cuz they want that thousand dollars
And not only that police will die to catch a fucking collar (get away)
And I'm out of here ain't no telling when I be back
Get rid of this gat
Dog you know I flew (ooh ooh) hell out of dodge
Nigga bout this paper ain't no time to be sitting behind bars

I got to get away but fuck that never let a nigga take me out of my zone
If he tryin to blown it go
(ooh ooh) wit no remorse kid its the cold hearted
Queens nigga grimey retarted
You know

'Cause I'm not playin I'm bangin hammers on niggas
Put hands on that niggas life (ooh ooh)
Just beat the shit out you I brawl like animal
Your whole team scrambling ( thats right) ( get away)
When we come through pushing new trucks
Bitches be pushing and shoving to look at us
They go (ooh ooh) yeah take a good look bitch
This might be last time you'll see gangsters like this
Then (get away) cuz somebody bout to die
And its going to be a stampede when them shots fly
(blah ba blah) (ooh ooh) rip that nigga you know
R.I.P your soul just lift up and (get away)
Uh huh yeah you out of here nigga
I'll see on that other side bye nigga
( other side) (thats right) families cry river
Courtesey of my niggas we terrorize rappers

I got to get away but fuck that never let a nigga take me out my zone
If he tryin blown it go
(ooh ooh) wit no remorse kid its the cold hearted
Queens nigga grimey retarted you know
I got to get away

(No doubt tell it like it is)
Its either me or you
Believe it dog no a nigga like you ain't got shit to loose (ooh ooh)

Prodigy:
Cuz you walking that thin line
I'm clapping you first time for a motherfucker trying(get away)

Havoc:
To put it past me
That ass be bleeding somewhere like a hemophilly act exactly (ooh ooh)
(shut the fuck up)

Prodigy:
Before its to late go at your gut
You ain't a gangster and yes you could get touched (get away)

Havoc:
Saw it before the henny was talking
It wasn't him but you know that nine stopped that (uh huh) (ooh ooh) ( grow up)

Prodigy:
I swear these niggas like bitches

Havoc:
Why is that?

Prodigy:
Cause these niggas always laying on their back
