		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I saw your name on a street sign
In the middle of nowhere
And that has to mean something
I know your zodiac sign
Me and Leo's get along great
And that has to mean something
But for some reason
You're not here
And I refuse to believe
That means something

I felt the way that you hugged me
When I was broken inside
And that has to mean something
When we got too drunk that night
And that had to mean something
But for some reason
You're not here
And I refuse to believe
That means something

Every time I think too much
It ends up crazy
But I don't know how to not think about you
Every time I trust my gut
I think I'm crazy
Cause I don't know how to put my trust in you
Do you think it means something
That I wrote another song about you?
