		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This never was the way I planned, not my intention
I was so drunk, she took my hand, lost my discretion
It's not what I'm used to, just wanna try you on
I'm curious for you, caught my attention
I fucked her friend and I liked it
Felt guilt, but can't be bothered
I fucked her friend just to try it
Hope my girlfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I fucked her friend and I liked it (I liked it)
I liked it
I fucked her friend and I liked it
Felt guilt, but can't be bothered
I fucked her friend just to try it
Hope my girlfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I fucked her friend and I liked it (I liked it)
I liked it
Walking slow, slow, slow, I see 'em everywhere I'm going
You don't give a fuck, you'll never know it
I go where the fuck I want and I don't care about condoning
You forgot I'm a motherfucking grown man
It's not what I'm used to, but my girl been acting up
It's one time, don't confuse it, but I'd do it again
I fucked her friend and I liked it
Felt guilt, but can't be bothered
I fucked her friend just to try it
Hope my girlfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I fucked her friend and I liked it (I liked it)
I liked it
I won't text back 'cause I don't want to waste no time, no
I'm too busy fucking on a high now
I can't talk right now, we'll be gone for a while now
Unless you come round, have some fun now
Two bitches on me at one time, I can't take 'em all
Sorry, can't get to the phone now, too busy to call
Your new man is a pussy, he shouldn't be in my shit
So anytime you trying to make a movie, come round, make a hit
(So anytime you trying to make a movie, come round, make a hit)
(Anytime you trying to make a movie, come round, make a hit)
(Anytime you trying to make a movie, come round, make a hit)
Anytime you trying to, trying to, try, try, trying to make a hit
I fucked her friend and I liked it
Felt guilt, but can't be bothered
I fucked her friend just to try it
Hope my girlfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I fucked her friend and I liked it (I liked it)
I liked it
