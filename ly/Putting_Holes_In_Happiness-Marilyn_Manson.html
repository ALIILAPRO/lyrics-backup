		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sky was blond like her; it was a day to take the child out back and shoot it
I could have buried all my dead up in her cemetery head
She had dirty word witchcraft; I was in the deep end of her skin
Then, it seemed like a one-car car wreck, but I knew it was a horrid tragedy
Ways to make the tiny satisfaction disappear

[Chorus:]
Blow out the candles
On my Frankensteins
At least my death wish will come true
You taste like Valentine's, and we cry
You're like a birthday: 
You should have picked the photograph; it lasted longer than you

Put holes in happiness
We'll paint the future black if it needs a color
Death sentence is now a story we'll be digging when you finally let me die
Romance of our assassination
If you're Bonnie, I'll be your Clyde
But the grass is greener here, and I can see all of your snakes
You wear your ruins well; please, run away with me to hell

[Chorus x 3]
