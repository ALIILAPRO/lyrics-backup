		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My romance, doesn't need to have a moon in the sky
My romance, doesn't need a blue lagoon standing by
No month of May, no twinkling stars
No hideaway, no soft guitar

My romance doesn't need a castle rising in Spain
Or a dance to a constantly surprising refrain
All at once I can make my most fantastic dreams come true
My romance, doesn't need a thing but you

My romance doesn't need a castle rising in Spain
Or a dance to a constantly surprising refrain
And wide awake, I can make my most fantastic dreams come true
My romance, doesn't need a thing but you, but you
