		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Ow) touch your toes, throw them against the wall (hey)
Do your dance 엉덩이 제끼러 (shake that)
Lose your breath, go ahead, take it off (okay)
Now, make it clap 손 없이 박수쳐 now, taste that

Gum, gum, gum, gum
Gum, gum, gum (gum)
Gum, gum, gum, gum
Gum, gum, gum (now, taste that)
Gum, gum, gum, gum
Gum, gum, gum (gum)
Gum, gum, gum, gum
Yum, yum, yum (now, taste that)

I got so many flavors
I know you want a taste (yeah)
Blueberry, strawberry 달고 맛있대 (yum, yum)
내 입술 물기 촉촉 my peach delicioso
Yeah, I'm so global on my Dolo
Hol' up, take that photo
I'm feelin' freaky, dicky
Super sticky, icky, likey (yeah)
날 계속 씹어대지 내 뒤에서 끼리끼리 (yeah)
Everyday a holiday 어떻게 날 말릴래? (huh)
꿀 빨아봐 벌 줄게 life is sweet, just let 'em hate

Who you with? (Ayy)
Where you from? (Ayy)
씹어 더 (ayy) now, pop that (gum)

Touch your toes, throw them against the wall (hey)
Do your dance 엉덩이 제끼러 (shake that)
Lose your breath, go ahеad, take it off (okay)
Now, make it clap 손 없이 박수쳐 now, taste that

Gum, gum, gum, gum
Gum, gum, gum (gum)
Gum, gum, gum, gum
Gum, gum, gum (now, taste that)
Gum, gum, gum, gum
Gum, gum, gum (gum)
Gum, gum, gum, gum
Yum, yum, yum (now, taste that)

Tear it off 입에 넣어 (입에 넣어)
Blow it up (pow, pow, pow), sugar rush (sugar rush)
Now, do that bubble gum
Now, do that bubble gum
Now, do that bubble gum
Now, do that bubble gum, run it back

Boy, boy, you know you want it bad
All of this and all of that
잠깐 봤을 뿐인데 이 짜식들 다 제비 돼
Suck it dry 더 쭉쭉 (씁)
My booty 둘이 짝짝꿍
You know you love this attitude
So bring it back, I think we should

Who you with? (Ayy)
Where you from? (Ayy)
씹어 더 (ayy) now, pop that (gum)

Touch your toes, throw them against the wall (hey)
Do your dance 엉덩이 제끼러 (shake that)
Lose your breath, go ahead, take it off (okay)
Now, make it clap 손 없이 박수쳐 now, taste that

Gum, gum, gum, gum
Gum, gum, gum (gum)
Gum, gum, gum, gum
Gum, gum, gum (now, taste that)
Gum, gum, gum, gum
Gum, gum, gum (gum)
Gum, gum, gum, gum
Yum, yum, yum (now, taste that)

Can I get a little?
Can I get a piece of that?
I got that yum, yum
I got that yummy, yum
Look at me got you stuck
I'ma make you fall in love
Now, put it on your tongue
I know you want that (gum)
