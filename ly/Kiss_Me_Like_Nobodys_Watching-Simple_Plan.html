		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wanna paint it on every wall
And shout it out up and down the halls
I wanna post it in shining lights
'Cause I just can't keep it bottled up inside

I wanna call up every single person I know
Write a song and play it on the radio
Stick a message in a bottle then I'll let it go
I don't care what people might think
I got your name in permanent ink
'Cause baby this ship ain't never gonna sink

So kiss me
Like nobody's watching
Yeah people are talkin'
It doesn't matter what they say
Just kiss me
In the middle of the streets
To let the whole world see
That there's nobody else for me
There's nobody else for me

People around us are cynical
Go ahead and say that we're typical
True love is dead, well that's a lie
'Cause we'll be together 'til the end of time

Now I'm burnin' up I'm speaking in tongues
Listen to my heart it's beating like a drum
I'm screaming your name at the top of my lungs
I don't care what people might think
I got your name in permanent ink
'Cause baby this ship ain't never gonna sink

So kiss me
Like nobody's watching
Yeah people are talkin'
It doesn't matter what they say
Just kiss me
In the middle of the streets
To let the whole world see
That there's nobody else for me
There's nobody else for me

I wanna call up every single person I know
Write a song and play it on the radio
I don't care what people might think
I got your name in permanent ink
'Cause baby this ship ain't never gonna sink

So kiss me
Like nobody's watching
Yeah people are talkin'
It doesn't matter what they say
Just kiss me
In the middle of the streets
To let the whole world see
That there's nobody else for me, for me
There's nobody else for me, for me
There's nobody else for me
