		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I just told my ex that
I'm better than her next
I just told my ex that
I'm better than the rest, yeah
I just told my ex I'ma pull up and flex
I just told my ex, uh, I just told my ex, uh
I just told my ex I'm
Teen X, this ain't that, uh
I just told my ex, uh, I just told my ex
Yeah
I'm just totin' a Glock 43, it's a X, yeah
(Glocky) i'm just totin' my X, yeah
I'm just totin' my X, yeah

Uh, yeah, Teen X, Teen X, Teen X (X, X)
I just called my partner up
Asked him where them beans at
(Where them beans?) i just called my doctor
Where the pills and lean at?
(Where the l–µan?) call up Metro Bloomin
Where the fuck my weed at? (Where my weed?)
Uh, uh, Teen X, Teen X, Teen X (yeah, Teen)
And I can't understand nothin'
You saying, lil' bitch, i'm high as shit
Fucked a ho off a Perc'
Popped a Xan' and now I'm out of it
And she just told her bestfriend that
She wanna try this shit

She wanna try this shit (yeah)
She want Boy Barbie (Oh yeah)
She wants Car$on Ken (yeah)
She want Teen Ecstasy
These niggas green like Ben 10 (Oh yeah)
So they can't stand next to me (Oh nah)
Pull up with an FN spinned the block
All you heard was a screech
Chrome Heart rug in my crib
So when you come in, no shoes on your feet
(Oh yeah) and I know she act a friend
But to me she just a freak (Oh yeah)
She do anything to get away from
You and come to me
I don't get into that relationship shit
I'm just a teen (I swear to God)

Yeah, yeah, Teen X, Teen X, Teen X
(Teen, Teen) i just called my partner up
Asked him where them beans at
(Where the fuck them beans?)
I just called my doctor
Where the pills and lean at?
(Pills and lean) call up Metro Bloomin
Where the fuck my weed at? (Where my weed?)
Uh, uh, Teen X, Teen X, Teen X (Teen, Teen)
And I can't understand nothin'
You saying, lil' bitch, i'm high as shit
Fucked a ho off a Perc'
Popped a Xan' and now I'm out of it
And she just told her bestfriend that
She wanna try this shit
(Wanna try this shit)
