		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  Lady
It's like we speak a different language
I'm tryna find a way to say it
Blame it all on me I don't mind

Lady
It's like we live on different planets
I really try to understand it
Blame it all on me I don't mind

Lately I can see your colors changing
I can see you colors fading away
You left me hanging on a kiss
I can feel my heart is racing
I'm playing, unless you wanna save it
Come save me
So maybe we can blame it on my sense of right and wrong
Baby, if only you would understand me
You could make our problems vanish
It'll always be alright

Lady
It's like we speak a different language
I'm tryna find a way to say it
Blame it all on me I don't mind

Lady
It's like we live on different planets
I really try to understand it
Blame it all on me I don't mind
