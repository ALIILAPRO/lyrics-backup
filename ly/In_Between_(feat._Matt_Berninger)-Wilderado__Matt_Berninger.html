		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Does anybody know where the pretty horses go?
I see deep into their eyes, they're headed down to Mexico
That's where my baby's from and where she longs to be
There's a song that sits and waits for her she's always sung to me

It's somewhere between here and now
Somewhere in between right here, right here and now

Palomino runnin' where the desert meets the sun
There's a million ways to go from here, a million ways and one
Up to Oklahoma where my baby sits with me
How much longer will she stick around?
I guess we wait and see

It's somewhere between here and now
Somewhere in between right here, right here and now
Somewhere in between right here, right here and now

Does anybody know where the pretty horses go?
I see deep inside their eyes, they're headed down to Mexico
That's where my baby's from and where she longs to be
There's a song that sits and waits for her, she's always sung to me

Does anybody know where the pretty horses go?
