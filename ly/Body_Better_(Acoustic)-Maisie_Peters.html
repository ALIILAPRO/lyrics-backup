		  Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh

I was good to you
Could lay my head up on your chest
And hear I was good for you
Got your heartbeat at its best
You were it for me
Did I just not do it for you superficially
'Cause you were it for me

If it was nothing I did and nothing I said
And I know I gave you all of myself, one hundred percent
Now I'm watching you moving on in the beat of a drum
So if I never gave you any reason to run

Then I, I can't help thinking that she's got a better body
Has she got a body better than mine?
And I, I can't help thinking when you touched it, were you sorry?
Were you sorry like you weren't at the time?
Loving you was easy, that's why it hurts now
The worst way to love somebody is to watch them love somebody else and it work out
Now, I can't help thinking that she's got a better body
Has she got a body better than mine?

Do you love her?
When you're twisting up all her sheets, do you suffer?
Do I sit there and watch you sleep?
If you love her
Was I just an idea you liked?
A convenient use of type
With obedient blue eyes

You took what you took and you left what you left
And I don't know how I still can't make it make any sense

Now I, I can't help thinking that she's got a better body
Has she got a body better than mine?
And I, I can't help thinking when you touched it, were you sorry?
Were you sorry like you weren't at the time?
Loving you was easy, that's why it hurts now
The worst way to love somebody is to watch them love somebody else and it work out
Now, I can't help thinking that she's got a better body
Has she got a body better than mine?

All the hows and the whens and whys
I thought it would be us for life
Was I wrong and is she so right?
Is her body better than mine?
All the clothes and the warning signs?
How's it feel to have made me cry?
Will you tell me just one more lie?
Is her body better than mine? (Mine)

I can't help thinking that she's got a better body
Has she got a body better than mine?
I can't help thinking when you touched it, were you sorry?
Were you sorry like you weren't at the time?
Loving you was easy, that's why it hurts now
The worst way to love somebody is to watch them love somebody else and it work out
Now, I can't help thinking that she's got a better body
Has she got a body better than mine?

Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
