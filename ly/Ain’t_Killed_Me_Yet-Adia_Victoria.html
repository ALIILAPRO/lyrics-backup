		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My baby, you know I've been givin'
A mighty hard road to row
And this life I'm a fan of dead ends and a field of stone

So pour me one last drink
And lit me one last smoke
And keep the jukebox paid 'til we both go broke
Now, it's a hard way of living but
The living ain't killed me yet
Now, it's a hard way of living but
The living ain't killed me yet

You already know when I go missing
I'm out and getting into trouble again
And I've been lying if I'd told ya
That the devil ain't my dearest fan

So pour me one last drink
And roll me one last smoke
And keep the jukebox paid 'til we both go broke
Now, it's a hard way of living but
The living ain't killed me yet
Now, it's a hard way of living but
The living ain't killed me yet

Now every night I get to pacing
Walking a tight wire under the moon
The time is nigh, I cannot face it
So all I do is gamble and loot

So pour me one last drink
And roll me one last smoke
And keep the jukebox paid 'til we both go broke
Now, it's a hard way of living but
The living ain't killed me yet

So pour me one last drink
And roll me one last smoke
And keep the jukebox paid 'til we both go broke
Now, it's a hard way of living but
The living ain't killed me yet
Now, it's a hard way of living but
The living ain't killed me yet
No, it ain't killed me yet
It ain't killed me yet
Mm, it ain't killed me yet 
No, it ain't killed me yet
(You ain't) ain't killed me yet
