		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Yeah)

Red eyes and a cold smile
Dim lights at the shoreline
You say that I am a runaway
I just can't find the words to say
A soft breeze in the palm trees
On an island, but I don't give a
Don't let me be misunderstood
If I could change, you know I would

Right now
Everything is way too loud
Got tired of it all somehow
I won't make it, can't fake it
Oh, I gotta get away

All I, all that I know
My mind can't take it no more
I'm goin' down in my bedroom exile
Haven't seen myself for a while
Late night, you tell me that you miss me
Changes have never been easy
I'm goin' down in my bedroom exile
Let me go, let me go, daylight

Yesterday is a lost friend
On my island at the world's end
Show my regret for past mistakes
Nobody knows it's just a fake
My kingdom is gonna rise
I got carried away in the riptide
Tryna hold on to somethin' real
Tryna live up to great ideals

Right now
Everything is way too loud
Got tired of it all somehow
I'm goin' places, new faces
I gotta get away

All I, all that I know
My mind can't take it no more
I'm goin' down in my bedroom exile
Haven't seen myself for a while
Late night, you tell me that you miss me
Changes have never been easy
I'm goin' down in my bedroom exile
Let me go, let me go, daylight

Goin' down in my bedroom exile
Let me go, let me go, daylight

Goin' down in my bedroom exile
Let me go, let me go, daylight
(All I, all I, all I)
(All I, all I, all I)
I'm goin' down in my bedroom exile
Let me go, let me go, daylight
(All I, all I, all I)
(All I, all I, all I)
I'm goin' down in my bedroom exile
Let me go, let me go, daylight
