		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't sell yourself short now
All but abandoned hope
Success is never easy
What a depressing trope
Hear what you're saying
That isn't me won't ever be
I just don't believe it
You can achieve it if you've got the means
Hear what you're saying
That isn't me won't ever be
Give me all your reasons
I'll disprove all your disbelief

Pick your head up
I'm sick and tired of you saying that you're not enough
Your lungs are still breathing
Speak your life into being
Your heart is still beating
Don't give up
Keep believing

Time's running out
What you got to lose?
Wasted time and fruitless attempts to prove your worth to a world that will move on
Feed it with a legacy that lives on
Hear what I'm saying
You blame your insecurities
The truth is a demon when shadow's the only thing you see
Hear what you're saying
You always say what you never mean
And you've got your reasons
They just don't mean a thing to me
No

Pick your head up
Life gets better when you say it
I'm not giving up
Your lungs are still breathing
Speak your life into being
Your heart is still beating
Don't give up
Keep believing
Your lungs are still breathing
Speak your life into being
Your heart is still beating
Don't give up
Keep believing
