		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm stuck in this bed you made
Alone with a sinking feeling
I saw through the words you said
To the secrets you've been keeping
It's written upon your face
All the lies, how they cut so deeply
You can't get enough, you take
And take and take, you never say

No, you've gotta get it inside
You push it back down
You push it back down
No, you'll never get it inside
Push it back down, blackout, blood in your eye

You say that it's not your fault
And swear that I am mistaken
You said it's not what it seems
No remorse for the trust you're breaking
You run but then back, you fall
Suffocate in the mess you're making
You can't get enough, you take
And take and take and take and take
Fuck it, are you listening?

No, you've gotta get it inside
You push it back down
You push it back down
No, you'll never get it inside
Push it back down
You push it back down
No, you've gotta get it inside
You push it back down
You push it back down
No, you'll never get it inside
Push it back down, blackout, blood in your eye

Blackout, blood in your eye
You push it back down
Push it back down
You push it back down, blood in your eye
Blackout, blood in your eye
Blackout, blood in your eye
Blackout, blood in your eye
Blackout, blood in your eye

Floating down, as colors fill the light
You look up from the ground in fields of paper white
And floating up, you pass us in the night
A future gazing out, a past to overwrite
So come down, far below
We've been waiting to collect the things you know
Come down, far below
We've been waiting to collect what you've let go

Come down, oh
Come down, oh
Come down, oh
Come down, oh
Come down, oh
