		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I hate the way you
(I hate the way you love me)

You're nice to your friends
You're sweet to your mother
You talk so respectfully and everyone loves ya
Behind closed doors
You're not nice anymore
I see it now
I wish I saw it before

You're almost perfect, baby
But I've been thinking lately

You won't stop going through my phone
Don't trust me when I'm alone
Wonder if you even know
I hate the way you love me

Always try so hard
To make people like you
But you make me feel
Like you wouldn't like to
Behind closed doors you're not nice anymore
I see it now
I wish I saw it before

You're almost perfect, baby
But I've been thinking lately

You won't stop going through my phone
Don't trust me when I'm alone
Wonder if you even know
I hate the way you love me
You don't like the way I dress
Roll your eyes when I'm upset
I should it make it clear I guess
I have to say I hate the way you love me

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I hate the way you love me
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I hate the way you love me

Don't try
All of those tricks, you tried before
Where you lie
And leave me lying on the floor
I won't cry (won't cry)
Not this time (this time)
I've seen enough of your bad side

You won't stop going through my phone
Don't trust me when I'm alone
Wonder if you even know
I hate the way you love me
You don't like the way I dress
Roll your eyes when I'm upset
I should it make it clear I guess
I have to say I hate the way you love me

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I hate the way you love me
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I hate the way you
