		  Labrinth, come in

Labrinth, come in

Labrinth, come in

Labrinth, come in

Ladies and gentlemen
This is something they call a ground-breaker
So, let me first apologize
To the shirts and the ties for your make-up
'Cause I'll make you ugly, as soon as it drops
We're on a rampage, bottles poppin' off
Before you know it, there's rubble and dust
'Cause we'll be fuckin' it up
Somebody say, "You better run"

Yeah!
I predict an earthquake up in here
Say, "Yeah!"
I predict an earthquake up in here
'Cause we throw bombs on it, throw bombs on it
Just smash something, yeah mosh for me
Hey, yeah!
We can make an earthquake up in here

Ladies and gentleman
What you're about to witness is no illusion
And now, we got the bass banging from here to Buckingham Palace
They're all moving
Hey Simon, we're fucking them up, turnin' them SyCo
Everybody rock, let's bring the house down
To rubble and dust cause we'll be fuckin' it up
Somebody say, "You better run"

Yeah!
I predict an earthquake up in here
Say, "Yeah!"
I predict an earthquake up in here
'Cause we throw bombs on it (yeah) throw bombs on it (yeah)
Just smash something, yeah mosh for me
Yeah (Let's go)
We can make an earthquake up in here

I predict an earthquake up in here
Say, "Yeah"
I predict an earthquake up in here
'Cause we throw bombs on it, throw bombs on it
Just smash something, yes mosh for me
Hey, yes
We can make an earthquake up in here (so here we go, we go)

Hey, yo, Labrinth
This one's feelin' like a straight ten on the Richter scale, you know?

Yeah, fire, fire
W-We about to set this place on fire
Without a match or lighter
Don't do girlfriends, one nighters
Make them (Ahh), C-minor
If I want Christian or Kurt Geiger
I just phone up their designer
Doing all nighters, no days off
Gray hairs and a little bit of weight loss
I predict (riots!) I predict (chaos!)
I predict (people!) I predict (oh!)
Disturbing London, got the whole city panicking
I be Nostradamus, this my ni-ni-nigga Labrinth

Yeah!
I predict an earthquake up in here
Say, "Yeah!"
I predict an earthquake up in here
'Cause we throw bombs on it (yeah) throw bombs on it (yeah)
Just smash something, yeah mosh for me
Hey, yeah!
We can make an earthquake up in here

(Labrinth, come in)
(Labrinth, come in)
(Labrinth, come in)
(Labrinth, come in)
