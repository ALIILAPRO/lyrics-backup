		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're the highlight of my dreams when I go to sleep
I don't wanna wake up for nothing
Everytime I dream I think I found peace
(Great John on the beat, by the way!)
Then I wake up and feel like I can't

Still smoke a pack to the face
Gettin' high only way to escape
Even when I be feelin' a way, I'ma tell 'em, "I'm doin' okay"
Like, don't say you love me when I'm in the grave
Don't you act like you feelin' my pain
When I took a L, it was part of the game
As a man all you got is your name

Feel like me and the judge in the race
If I crash, she gon' lock me away
Got a Perc', I might pop it today
Said I'd stop but I'm stuck in my ways
And I work like I'm tryna get a raise
She said, "If you loved me, then you would've stayed"
I know what she feelin', that's played
I ain't really tryna bring you pain
Would you love me if I was a lame?
That'd mean minus the watch and the chain
Had no car? Had to walk in the rain?
Bentley truck, but you get what I'm sayin'
Gettin' money, don't care for the fame
EBK, we don't care what you claim
Got no license, let's go on a chase
I be switchin' and swervin' mid lane
Double X, tried to get me too late
I said no 'cause I found that shit strange
Don't be lackin' out here, it ain't safe
Take a L, you get hit with a K
Niggas hate it when you gettin' cake
Been through shit but you couldn't relate
'Member me and big bro in the Wraith
Thinkin' back, we was lookin' for stains
Can't believe I was askin' for change
Can't believe that this shit really changed
In the trap, we was flippin' them thangs
Said you root for them troops for the gang
And my shooters ain't been in no range
Double-back like we puttin' in pain
If you with it, then do what you sayin'
Made you better now you got to lay it

Ain't nobody think Tjay'll stick, couldn't pay 'em no mind, I know
Industry won't acknowledge my gift so fuck 'em niggas, I'm just here for my dough
First, I'm gettin' six figures on stage, checkbooks lookin' like there's a typo
Woke up one day, my pockets was flat, the next day look like I just gave 'em lightbulbs
Love the Gods, but they never need a gang, that's me, what did I show?
All the time when I spit, that shit be flames, m√°s o menos, so that's how the price go
In the line like they watchin' how I move, I have to shoot for them trenches, still approved
Love my fans but you see me keep it smooth, we at war right now, I ain't tryna lose
Soothe, soothe, see him there? He get left up on the news
I got shot in my neck, that shit could of went left, not my lungs, still I'm standin', shit to prove
For them pussy boys, they know what we do, I be doin' it better, be the same
Steady jet, when I see that boy, he flew, Drilly killed his shit, never finna change

Gang, gang, gang, gang
(Gang) Gang, gang, gang
(Gang, gang) Gang-gang
Gang-gang, gang-gang

Still smoke a pack to the face
Gettin' high only way to escape
Even when I be feelin' a way
I'ma tell 'em, "I'm doin' okay"
Like, don't say you love me when I'm in the grave
Don't you act like you feelin' my pain
When I took a L, it was part of the game
As a man all you got is your name
