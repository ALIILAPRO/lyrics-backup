		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tear down these walls
Well, this can't go on forever
Something's gotta give

How can I relate to a world that I feel is broken?
To the minds that I feel won't open?
And how can I speak life
When all I see is death, yeah, and all I see is strife?
Yeah, I'll tell them

Look into their eyes
Listen to their cries
Voices speak demise

Tear down these walls
Well, this can't go on forever
Something's gotta give
Burn down and relearn
Well, we won't be here forever
Something's gotta change
Right now, right now, right now, right

How can we exist in a constant state of crisis?
Society in conflict
All the ignorance betrays a weakness
Too much pride to admit there's a sickness
Vacant emotions, like walking corpses

Look into their eyes
Listen to their cries
Voices speak demise

Tear down these walls
Well, this can't go on forever
Something's gotta give
Burn down and relearn
Well, we won't be here forever
Something's gotta change
Right now, right now
Right now, right now

If we all take a second and listen
Voice of reason is how we can end this
We can't waste a minute, it needs to happen now
Drop your weapons and all your defenses
Drop your pride, get the point that we're missing
We can't waste a minute, it needs to happen now
It needs to happen now

Tear down these walls
Well, this can't go on forever
Something's gotta give
Burn down and relearn
Well, we won't be here forever
Something's gotta change
Right now, right now
Right now, right now
