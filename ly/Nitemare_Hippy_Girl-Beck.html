		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She took me off my guard with disappointment
I got sucked inside of her apartment
She's got dried-up flowers, flaky skin
A beaded necklace and a bottle of gin

She's a nightmare hippy girl
With her skinny fingers fondlin' my world
She's a whimsical, tragically beauty
Self-conscious and a little bit moody

It's a new age letdown in my face
She's so spaced out and there ain't no space
She's got marijuana on the bathroom tile
I'm caught in a vortex
She's changing' my style

She's a nightmare hippy girl
With her skinny fingers fondling' my world
She's a whimsical, tragically beauty
Uptight and a little bit snooty

Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

She's a magical, sparkling' tease
She's a rainbow choking' the breeze
Yo, she's busting' out onto the scene
With nightmare bogus poetry
She's a melted avocado on the shelf
She's the science of herself
She's spazzing out on a cosmic level
And she's meditating with the devil
She's cooking salad for breakfast
She's got tofu the size of Texas
She's a witness to her own glory
She's a never-ending story
She's a frolicking depression
She's a self-inflicted obsession
She's got a thousand lonely husbands
She's playing' footsie in another dimension
She's a goddess milking her time
For all that it's worth
