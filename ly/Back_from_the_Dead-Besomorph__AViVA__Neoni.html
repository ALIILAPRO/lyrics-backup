		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can't face it
Just look at yourself in the mirror
You know that you're wasting wasting
I'm praying i won't have to reveal all these
Things I conceal I'm just sayin' just sayin'

Bury me the little girl I used to be
She's so scared she's hurting me
I think it’s time to bury me just bury me
Bury me the little girl I used to be
I'm so scared she's haunting me
I think I've changed my mind
(Changed my mind, changed my mind)

Bring me back from the dead
Been six feet inside my head
And I'm running out of breath
I'm my own worst enemy just anothеr casualty
Of empty threats let's go again
Yеah, I'm back from the dead

Back from the dead back from the dead
Back back from the dead, dead
Back from the dead back from the dead
Back back from the dead, dead
Back from the dead back from the dead

I'm back now
I just needed some space to recalibrate
A little break to exterminate
To find a new way to contemplate just how
I'll break through that ceiling in any way
To find myself human again one day
My final bow

Bury me the little girl I used to be
She's so scared she's hurting me
I think it’s time to bury me just bury me
Bury me the little girl I used to be
I'm so scared she's haunting me
I think I've changed my mind
(Changed my mind, changed my mind)

Bring me back from the dead
Been six feet inside my head
And I'm running out of breath
I'm my own worst enemy just another casualty
Of empty threats let's go again
Yeah, I'm back from the dead

Back from the dead back from the dead
Back back from the dead, dead
Back from the dead back from the dead
Back back from the dead, dead

Bury me the little girl I used to be
She's so scared she's hurting me
I think it’s time to bury me just bury me
Bury me the little girl I used to be
I'm so scared she's haunting me
I think I've changed my mind
