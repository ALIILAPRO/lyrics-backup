		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, no, don't act like you never lost
Come back and win like you Ronda Rousey
Like you Ronda Rousey
My niggas twist like they origami
Got them girls waiting all in the lobby
But my baby still right here beside, yeah
My niggas twist like they origami
Got them girls waiting all in the lobby
But my baby still right here beside, yeah

This a gang, is you in or you out?
I put diamonds all up in my mouth
I feel like I bought a Swishahouse, yeah
I was lost, and then, yeah, I was found
Had no money, yeah, um, I was down
We was already down

Nowhere else for us to go
Drive around in a Testarossa
Puetro Rican and she had a cold sore
Same girl that was on my poster
Damn, now I know
Treat my girl like I am Jay Z
Treat my girl like she Beyonc√© Knowles
Money got longer, my neck got cold
When my money get longer, don't need these diamonds

Yeah, no, don't act like you never lost
Come back and win like you Ronda Rousey
Like you Ronda Rousey
My niggas twist like they origami
Got them girls waiting all in the lobby
But my baby still right here beside, yeah
My niggas twist like they origami
Got them girls waiting up all in the lobby
But my baby still right here beside, yeah
Yeah, no, don't act like you never lost
Come back and win like you Ronda Rousey
Like you Ronda Rousey
My niggas twist like they origami
Got them girls waiting all in the lobby
But my baby still right here beside, yeah
My niggas twist like they origami
Got them girls waiting up all in the lobby
But my baby still right here beside, yeah

This a gang, is you in or you out?
I put diamonds all up in my mouth
I feel like I bought a Swishahouse, yeah
I was lost and then, yeah, I was found
Had no money, yeah, um, I was down

Know I'm gon' die for my baby
Know I'm gon' ride for my baby
You know that I go suicide for my baby
All in the way, I don't care what they say, yeah
Made a hundred in a day (In a what?) 
Got a Rollie with a face
Diamonds, break the bank
Yeah, boy, you fake
Yeah, really hate
Under those handshakes
House so big, it got a maid
Yeah, Lil Uzi, you got it made

This a gang, is you in or you out?
I put diamonds all up in my mouth
I feel like I bought a Swishahouse, yeah
I was lost and then, yeah, I was found
Had no money, yeah, um, I was down
Turn myself to the man of my town

Yeah, no, don't act like you never lost
Come back and win like you Ronda Rousey
Like you Ronda Rousey
My niggas twist like they origami
Got them girls waiting all in the lobby
But my baby still right here beside me, yeah
My niggas twist like they origami
Got them girls waiting all in the lobby
But my baby still right here beside me, yeah

This a gang, is you in or you out?
I put diamonds all up in my mouth
I feel like I bought a Swishahouse, yeah
I was lost and then, yeah, I was found
Had no money, yeah, um, I was down
