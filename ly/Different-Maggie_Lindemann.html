		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  2AM, windows down, driving on the 405
Only got two hours left 'til I catch my flight
If I disappear would they call my name at my gate?
Why do my reckless decisions happen this late?
4AM, windows down, I'm not comin' home tonight

Thinkin' don't be scared, don't you cry
Everything will be alright
But if it's still not enough
Can somebody just

Take me where the headlights go
I'm so fuckin' lost here, just wanna be not here
Take me where stars don't show
It can get a lot here, shinin' all alone

I just wanna be someone different than me sometimes
I just, I just, I just
I just wanna be someone different than me sometimes
I just, I just, I just

Always feeling guilty so I need somewhere to put the pain
Poison in my mouth 'cause it's better than the words I say
Am I just a burden or is it certain? Don't know
This isn't working but I keep diggin' this hole
If I try hard enough, maybe I'll forget my name

Thinkin' don't be scared, don't you cry
Everything will be alright
But if it's still not enough
Can somebody just

Take me where the headlights go
I'm so fuckin' lost here, just wanna be not here
Take me where stars don't show
It can get a lot here, shinin' all alone

I just wanna be someone different than me sometimes
I just, I just, I just
I just wanna be someone different than me sometimes
I just, I just, I just

Thinkin' don't be scared, don't you cry
Everything will be alright
But if it's still not enough
Can somebody just
