		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You crossed that line

The sirens take you under

The holding cell inside, with walls of pride

Has lost it's charm



You felt it once

Euphoric overflowing

But then I held the line, commit the crime

And hope to find a


Cause
Am I holding on too long?

Find a cause

Am I holding on too long?



Ey!



Sir I know my rights

I'll stay silent

(I'm not saying nothing)

But these here eyes

If you're quiet

(They'll show you everything)



Your hold is strong, your bite too tight

I'm shot to the heart but I kinda like it

You're in the right place

But with all that at stake

Urg - It's just the wrong timing



(Damn!)



Find the cause, take me in

Hold me captive

Go and throw away the key so no distraction

In my mind day and night

Am I wandering too far?

Hope you find the cause

Coz in my mind day and night

Am I wandering too far?



I'm in a dark room

Baby don't you go

Maybe us being alone

Will help our love grow

I'm in a dark room

Baby don't you go

Maybe us being alone

Will help our love grow



I feel it

I know it

Calling out
