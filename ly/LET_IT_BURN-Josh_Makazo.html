		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Intro:
Call out my name when I let go, 
Send it off with a burning momento, 
and I don't wanna know how you feel, 
If I said it I meant it I said so, 
Yea

Verse 01:
I said what I mean, 
Cut it off or either torn at the seams,
Give me solace or a moment to breath,
Automatic with the choice 
Automatic to the Quay

Time to move on cause I know what I know, 
She been like too in her feels, so she's coming outside,
forget a reply and go ghost 

Leave it and go now, 
Call me up when you giving the low down,
Give me time like you know what I'm on,
Act surprised like we aren't both on our own now 

Don't tell me you'll try, 
Just prove it, 
Fugazi, go wild, go stupid,
Black hummer go hop out the scene, 
Call up the bumper, 
Get in secluded 

She gonna pull up whenever the lights shine, 
Said her vices were more like a lifeline,
Welcome back to wherever you've been, 
When I'm back and alive in the right time  

Hook:
You wanted to switch, you wanted to turn on me, 
Forget what I said, I want you to turn on me, 
Forget bout a bridge, I'm letting it burn on me, 
I'm letting it, letting it

You want to turn on me, 
Forget what I said, I want you to turn on me, 
Forget bout a bridge, I'm letting it burn on me, 
Forget bout a bridge, I'm letting it burn on me
