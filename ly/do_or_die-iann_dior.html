		  Ten-band-fit on occasion (go)
I'm at the event faded (yeah)
She wanna fuck me 'cause I'm famous (okay)
She see all the cash I'm makin'
(Nick, you're stupid)

Ten-band-fit on occasion (go)
I'm at the event faded (yeah)
She wanna fuck me 'cause I'm famous (okay)
She see all the cash I'm makin'
I ain't have no choice but to get it, it was do or die (yeah)
Pull up with the roof missing, doors up, suicide (okay)
We get the cake and bakin', dreaded my head like Jamaican
I'm in a new location every damn day of the week (oh yeah)
Places you only gon' see on vacation
Spin off in that new coupe
See these hoes, eenie-minie-mo, bitch, I choose you
Pullin' up to my show, when I'm on the road, she said, "I knew you"
Diamonds my neck they froze
Yeah, you cold, they not used to this new life that I moved to

It it's some cash to make, you know I'ma get it
This side of me is gone girl, I'm not the same
I ain't have no choice but to get it, it was do or die (do or die)
Pull up with the roof missing, doors up, suicide (suicide)
I know that you wanted what I have, it was you and I (yeah, yeah, yeah)
You said what you said, now go do 'cause I'm doing mine (oh yeah)

Ten-band-fit on occasion (yeah)
I'm at the event, faded (let's go)
She wanna fuck me 'cause I'm famous (whoa)
She see all the cash I'm makin'
I ain't have no choice but to get it, it was do or die (do or die)
Pull up with the roof missing, doors up, suicide (suicide)
We get the cake and bakin', dreaded my head like Jamaican
I'm in a new location every damn day of the week (I am)
Places you only gon' see on vacation
Spin off in that new coupe
See these hoes, eenie-minie-mo, bitch, I choose you
Pullin' up to my show, when I'm on the road, she said, "I knew you"
