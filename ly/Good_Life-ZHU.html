		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Life is all about you and not at all about you
Now, that's two opposing thoughts and yet both of them are true
How can you experience everything you choose to do
While observing the experience you're having from a higher view
See, it's the question, not the answer, that's the higher view
Otherwise, you couldn't differentiate between the two
Awareness? But of who?
You think you hurt me, but I promise I was letting you
They say we're all one, but where have we been headed to
I'd rather die free than have to live inside a petting zoo
I am the journey that I'm getting to

I could be it all, I'll make a good life
Let me lose my mind, it's the only way to love
Only way to, only way to love
I could be it all, I'll make a good life
Let me lose my mind, it's the only way to love
Only way to, only way to love

Gratitude is my destination
My destiny is perfectly aligned with this location
I am the map, so I travel back in time
I have everything I want cause my imagination is mine
But mind is not enough for me cause I am not my mind
I could see it all, but never get to see I'm truly blind
I could be it all, but all identities intertwine
The moon is only bright cause it reflects the sun's shine

I could be it all, I'll make a good life
Let me lose my mind, it's the only way to love
Only way to, only way to love

It's not the human race, it's just the human race
There's nothing left to chase, we do not run this place
But both medicine and poison's an acquired taste
So I started taking selfies of somebody else's face

Tell me something
What is more genius than a child's laughter
Are we not simply the children of this world?
