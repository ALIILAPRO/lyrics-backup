		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One, two
Yo, Oh No, what up papa?
Yeah, sun still shine, you nah mean?
I call my brother sun 'cause he shine like one
You nah mean?
Pack Pistol Pazzy
Pistol Gang Pazienza
Listen

Carefully wrote L's, I order [?] liquor
Son talked loud and he died with a whimper
Shooters in the cut like they hold a [?] scissor
The [?] watch is in the toxified liver
You need somebody popped? We'll rock for five figures
For less we could touch him and leave him alive limbless
Giant Rambo knife all of y'all bitches
Gut a muh'fucker, par, lie with the fishes
Allah word always gon' justify the Deen (DÄ«n)
Especially since the end gon' justify the mean
This the confession of revelation of a king
The most high, whole dedication to the ring
The orientation and resurrection of the queen
The glorification and insurrection of the being
Every variety of thought is obscene
The falsehood lies in the walls of the dream
Yeah

Niggas out of line, then we hit 'em with them thangs
You can see the blood still dripping from my fangs
First you hear the click-click, then you hear the bang
Then you hear the bang, bang, bang

Niggas out of line, then we hit 'em with them thangs
You can see the blood still dripping from my fangs
First you hear the click-click, then you hear the bang
Then you hear the bang, bang, bang

No high hopes, so there's no disappointment
Just another fly in the ointment
Y'all are like poison, this is why the TEC stay pointed
Emphatically non-cypher and disjointed
Them jump out boys will smoke to stay noited
Fam got jammed on the lamb and they [?]
Tried to keep peace and got stuck in the middle
When son got touched, I got tucked for a little
The Pyrex like Benihana when the white cooking
The K-Frame turned his brain into rice pudding
We tried sight to the blind, but the night took him
We stay high like a 95' white [?]
I reorganize a circumvent still
The banishing ritual of the pentagram real
It's always in accordance with something that y'all feel
Magical philosophy, something that y'all kill
Yeah

Niggas out of line, then we hit 'em with them thangs
You can see the blood still dripping from my fangs
First you hear the click-click, then you hear the bang
Then you hear the bang, bang, bang

Niggas out of line, then we hit 'em with them thangs
You can see the blood still dripping from my fangs
First you hear the click-click, then you hear the bang
Then you hear the bang, bang, bang
