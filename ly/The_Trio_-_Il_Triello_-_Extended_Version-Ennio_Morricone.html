		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There is a lonely train called the 3.10 to Yuma
The pounding of the wheels is more like a mournful sigh
There's a legend and there's a rumor
When you take the 3.10 to Yuma
You can see the ghosts of outlaws go ridin' by (Ridin' by)
In the sky (In the sky), way up high
The buzzards keep circlin' the train
While below the cattle are thirstin' for rain

It's also true they say on the 3.10 to Yuma
A man may meet his fate
For fate travels ev'rywhere
Though you've got no reason to go there
And there ain't a soul that you know there
When the 3.10 to Yuma whistles its sad refrain
Take that train (Take that train)
Take that train

So when you take the train called the 3.10 to Yuma
And leave the things you love
You leave with a silent prayer (Silent prayer)
Though you've got no reason to go there
And there ain't a soul that you know there
When the 3.10 to Yuma whistles its sad refrain
Take that train
Take that train
