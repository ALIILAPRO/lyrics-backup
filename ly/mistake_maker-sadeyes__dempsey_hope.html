		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  premeditated, should be medicated
do the same shit everyday i hate it
we never made it, sorry that i’m anxious
always in my head everyday can’t take it
 
hey, i’ve been fightin for you
little miss oh i adore you
hey i’ve been fightin for you
little miss oh i adore you
 
your friends all wanna do lines thats fine i’ve tried
that’s not my thing
my heart won’t mend over one weekend
mistakes have a grip on me
 
they call me mister mistake maker
i’m fuckin up everything
can’t commit to anything
not even a wedding ring
 
i remember waitin in the cold with you next to me
misery loves company and pretty girls love ketamine
 
hey i’ve been fightin for you
little miss oh i adore you
hey i’ve been fightin for you
little miss oh i adore you
 
i know i can make shit overcomplicated
i know you can’t stand me you don’t have to say it
i’m well aware i’m a hard person to be around
i don’t care, yes i do what are you sayin about me
 
i’m sorry i canceled last minute
a downward spiral i’m in it
and if you hate me i get it
 
hey i’ve been fightin for you
little miss oh i adore you
hey i’ve been fightin for you
little miss oh i adore you
 
hey i’ve been fightin for you
little miss oh i adore you
hey i’ve been fightin for you
little miss oh i adore you
 
premeditated, should be medicated
do the same shit everyday i hate it
we never made it, sorry that i’m anxious
always in my head everyday can’t take it
