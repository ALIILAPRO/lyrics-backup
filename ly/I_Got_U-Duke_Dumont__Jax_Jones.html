		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ask me what I did with my life
I spent it with you
If I lose my fame and fortune (really don't matter)
As long as I got you, baby

Clap your hands, y'all, it's alright
Clap your hands, y'all, it's alright
Clap your hands, y'all, it's alright
As long as I got you, baby
Clap your hands, y'all, it's alright
Clap your hands, y'all, it's alright
Clap your hands, y'all, it's alright
As long as I got you

Ask me what I did with my life
I spent it with you
If I lose my fame and fortune (really don't matter)
As long as I got you, baby

Clap your hands, y'all, it's alright
Clap your hands, y'all, it's alright
Clap your hands, y'all, it's alright
As long as I got you, baby
Clap your hands, y'all, it's alright
Clap your hands, y'all, it's alright
Clap your hands, y'all, it's alright
As long as I got you

As the years they pass us by (years they, years they, years they)
We stay young through each other's eyes (each other's eyes)
And no matter how old we get
As long as I got you, baby

Clap your hands, y'all, it's alright
As long as I got you, baby
Clap your hands, y'all, it's alright
As long as I got you
Clap your hands, y'all, it's alright
As long as I got you, baby
Clap your hands, y'all, it's alright
As long as I got you, baby

As long as I got you
As long as I got you
As long as I got you
As long as I got you
As long as I got you
