		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I was a young boy I was scared of growing up
I didn't understand it but I was terrified of love
Felt like I had to choose but it was outta my control
I needed to be saved, I was going crazy on my own
Took me years to tell my mother, I expected the worst
I gathered all the courage in the world

She said, "I love you no matter what
I just want you to be happy and always be who you are"
She wrapped her arms around me
Said, "Don't try to be what you're not
'Cause I love you no matter what"
She loves me no matter what

I got a little older wishing all my time away
Riding on the pavement, every sunny day was grey
I trusted in my friends then all my world came crashing down
I wish I never said a thing 'cause to them I'm a stranger now

I ran home I saw my mother, it was written on my face
Felt like I had a heart of glass about to break

She said, "I love you no matter what
I just want you to be happy and always be who you are"
She wrapped her arms around me
Said, "Don't try to be what you're not
'Cause I love you no matter what" yeah

Now I'm a man and I'm so much wiser
I walk the earth with my head held higher
I got the love that I need
But I was still missing one special piece
My father looked at me

He said I love you no matter what
I just want you to be happy and always be who you are
He wrapped his arms around me
Said, "Don't try to be what you're not
'Cause I love you no matter what"
He loves me no matter what

They love me no matter what
