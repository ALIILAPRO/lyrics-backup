		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Today I woke up and I hate myself
Death doesn't answer when I cry for help
No high could save me from the depths of hell
I'll drown my mind until I'm someone else

Don't take care of me, be scared of me
My misery owns me
I don't wanna be my enemy
My misery owns me now

Under the graveyard
We're all rotting bones
Oh, oh
Everything you are
Can't take it when you go
Oh, oh
I ain't living this lie no more
Ain't living this lie no more
Oh, oh
It's cold in the graveyard
We all die alone

Cover my eyes so I can't see clear
One sip away from everything I fear
Ashes to ashes, watch me disappear
Closer to home because the end is near

Don't take care of me, be scared of me
My misery owns me
I don't wanna to be my enemy
My misery owns me now

Under the graveyard
We're all rotting bones
Oh, oh
Everything you are
Can't take it when you go
Oh, oh
I ain't living this lie no more
Ain't living this lie no more
Oh, oh
It's cold in the graveyard
We all die alone

(I'm waiting for you)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Under the graveyard
We're all rotting bones
Oh, oh
Everything you are
Can't take it when you go
Oh, oh
I ain't living this lie no more
Ain't living this lie no more
Oh, oh
It's cold in the graveyard
We all die alone
Oh, oh
