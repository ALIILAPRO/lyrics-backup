		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Days go by and I know I still love you
And I cry every night for you

Hated that we went our separate ways
Maybe we just need some time to change
Maybe in the future, I could stay
Wait, for once I got a lot to say

Used to meet me at the bar
Didn't drive a fancy car
You would tell me how you are
Never kept me in the dark
Always knew you were a star
Way before the fancy clothes
You're so beautiful and smart
On my way to where you are

Hated that we went our separate ways
Maybe we just need some time to change
Maybe in the future I could stay
Wait, for once I got a lot to say

(Ain't it sad we went our separate ways)
(Ain't it sad we went out separate ways)

Days go by and I know I still love you
