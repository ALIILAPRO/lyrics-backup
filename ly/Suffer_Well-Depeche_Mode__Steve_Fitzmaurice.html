		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Where were you when I fell from grace?
A frozen heart, an empty space

Something's changed and it's in your eyes
Please don't speak, you'll only lie

I found treasure not where I thought
Peace of mind can't be bought
Still I believe

I just hang on
Suffer well
Sometimes it's hard
It's hard to tell

An angel led me when I was blind
I said, "Take me back, I've changed my mind"
And now I believe
From the blackest room, I was torn
He called my name, a love was born
So I believe

I just hang on
Suffer well
Sometimes it's hard
It's hard to tell

I just hang on
Suffer well
Sometimes it's hard
So hard to tell
