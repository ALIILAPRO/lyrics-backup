		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Why these niggas fall in love with weak hoes?
Why these niggas fall in love with weak hoes?
Money talk, numbers speak, ho
I got a bag, I ain't worried about a cheap ho
Not a needy ho, not a needy ho
I got a loyal bitch, she don't need me though
She don't need me though, she don't need me though
She don't need me though, she don't need me though

Twenty-four hours, I got lean on my bladder
I'm like, "Bae, pass the blicky"
It got a beam, I might splat 'em
I smell pussy, I can't dap 'em
Wipe your nose, grab a napkin
She had to stack and use that dick
Yeah, that mmm, so I kept her
And I got the Draco on me too
Keep on playing, I make it clap
These niggas be cuffing up these broke hoes
Can't even buy 'em a snack
This bitch can't even give you a rack
Your broke ass can't even gift back
Broke hoes out here making a proud penny, call 'em Kyla Pratt
I could upgrade you but I don't wanna upgrade, Beyonc√©
If I can fuck on your bitch then I want your bitch, that's solid I'll say
Pull up to the party, "Where the Percs at?"
Broke bitches and niggas belong together
My ho pimp your ho for cheddar
You gotta do better if you know better

Why these niggas fall in love with weak hoes?
Why these niggas fall in love with weak hoes?
Money talk, numbers speak ho
I got a bag, I ain't worried about a cheap ho
Not a needy ho, not a needy ho
I got a loyal bitch, she don't need me though
She don't need me though, she don't need me though
She don't need me though (yeah), she don't need me though

Bitches ain't shit
