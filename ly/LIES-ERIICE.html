		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  wasn't I enough
thought you'd have the heart to say it
guess I'm out of luck
you don't even want to face it
I can hear the voice of someone else
behind your phone
so I know
you're not alone


don't you think I know you're lying
when you're always working late
don't you think I know that something is off
don't you think I know you're lying
so just tell it to me straight
I can take it I just want you to stop


telling lies
cause I don't know why
I don't know why you think it's better
why you think it's better telling lies
cause I don't why
I don't know why you think it's better
yeah I don't know
I don't know why


baby this ain't us
maybe you don't want to save this
look what we've become
you don't even want me lately
I can smell her perfume on your neck
when you come home late at night
late at night
