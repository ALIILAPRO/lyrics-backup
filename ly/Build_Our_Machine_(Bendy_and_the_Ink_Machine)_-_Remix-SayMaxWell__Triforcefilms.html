		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They've sent you a letter
Come back home to play but to your dismay
This isn't your day
For the happy fun time has begun to fade
Watch as we reanimate our
Corpses you abandoned
We're dismantled, we're mishandled
But we won't be skipped and swayed
Trapped within these walls
You left our souls to drip away
The ink decays the walls at bay
The reckoning has come today you say
Boris has no guts 'cause you
Replaced it with mechanical strain
We've been tortured but we move forward
This disorder kills your day i am alive
Immortalized you're the creator
You traitor hey!
There's no vaccine to cure our dirty needs
For now you must build up our machine
You die tonight tonight
Build up our machine you die tonight
Tonight build up our machine
You die tonight so you found all the pieces
To initiate the pain our venom stains
The night remains
But the ending is always just the same
No gain nod your head to the beat of death
As you draw your last eternal breath
Sensations of an invasion
Start to course right through your veins
You say we have no brains
We're just cartoons for your portrayal
To tell some tale about a boat and sail
But sure this inevitably unveils the fail
Splashes of eternal hate will flood the
Floors and clean the slate
Now we're the tools and you're the fool
Our nightmare dominates i am alive
Immortalized you're the creator
You traitor hey
There's no vaccine to cure our dirty needs
For now you must build up our machine
You die tonight i am alive
Immortalized you're the creator
You traitor hey
There's no vaccine to cure our dirty needs
For now you must build up our machine
You die tonight tonight
Build up our machine you die tonight
Tonight build up our machine
You die tonight i am aware
Your soul is now divine
We care not to toil with unbroken chains
So don't toil with ours
Like he did to our shining stars
So prepare for adventure
We're a whole new creature
From the darkest side
You can't take away the pain we feel
Created as monsters that come to life
(Back to life)
So you've come to the end now
Alive but dead inside the heart beats loud
You've joined our crowd
We are but punished serpentines
Your life with him was fun
But now the terror's only just begun
Now come with me and you will see
We're a new born cyanide i am alive
Immortalized you're the creator
You traitor hey
There's no vaccine to cure our dirty needs
For now you must build up our machine
You die tonight i am alive
Immortalized you're the creator
You traitor hey
There's no vaccine to cure our dirty needs
For now you must build up our machine
You die tonight tonight
Build up our machine you die tonight
Tonight build up our machine
You die tonight
