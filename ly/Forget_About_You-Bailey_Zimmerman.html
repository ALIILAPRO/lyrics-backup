		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm a wreck, I'm a mess
Girl, since you left, I confess getting over you feels so wrong
Forgive and forget
That's what they said I gotta do to get through the movin' on
Got one step right
The other step's holding on strong

But the talk of the pine trees
Girl, they remind me
Just how good it was back when your lovin' was mine
We were nineteen, chasing that lighting
We were Colorado high, didn't get a goodbye
Just a note on the fridge and them words that you said
Still stuck in my head like glue
Yeah, I forgive, yeah, I forgive
But I can't forget about you

Oh God knows I'm tryin' but I wanna rewind it
Back to the day, when ya had my back, before them plans fell through
Ain't no denying and girl I'd be lying
If I said I'm getting over you

The talk of the pine trees
Girl, they remind me
Just how good it was back when your lovin' was mine
We were nineteen, chasing that lighting
We were Colorado high, didn't get a goodbye
Just a note on the fridge and them words that you said
Still stuck in my head like glue
Yeah, I forgive, yeah, I forgive
But I can't forget about you

Those nights that we'd dance slow
Both bare feet on the dirt road
Didn't know what I was about to lose
Never thought it'd be you
Too good to be true

But the talk of the pine trees
Girl, they remind me
Just how good it was back when your lovin' was mine
We were nineteen, chasing that lighting
We were Colorado high, didn't get a goodbye
Just a note on the fridge and them words that you said
Still stuck in my head like glue
Yeah, I forgive, yeah, I forgive
But I can't forget about you
No, I can't forget about you
(I'm weak, I'm a mess)
(Girl, since you left, I confess)
No, I can't forget about you
