		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Like a city overthrown
We're turning buildings into stone
We leave the bodies to the crows
On a funeral of fire

Now we're choking on the fumes
Spread the lie and kill the truth
They're in the ashes of the proof
We watch the flames rise higher

Our empire
Is on fire
Our empire
Is on fire
Our empire's on fire
Our empire is on fire

Now we're falling through the ice
We made our bed and rolled the dice
Well every gamble has a price
We watched the cracks grow wider

Waves are climbing past your knees
It's just the coming of the seas
It's getting harder now to breathe
We watched the tides rise higher

Our empire
Is on fire
Our empire
Is on fire
Our empire's on fire
Our empire is on fire

I said I know you know we feel it in our bones
I said I know you know we feel it in our bones
I said I know you know we feel it in our bones
I said I know, whoa oh oh

I said I know you know we feel it in our bones
I said I know you know we feel it in our bones
I said I know you know we feel it in our bones
I said I know, whoa oh oh

Our empire
Is on fire
Our empire
Is on fire
Our empire's on fire
Our empire is on fire
