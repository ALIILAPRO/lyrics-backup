		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Another town, another place
Another girl, another face
Another truck, another race
I'm eating junk, feeling bad
Another night, I'm going mad
My woman's leaving, I feel sad
But I just love the life I lead
Another beer is what I need
Another gig, my ears bleed

We are the road crew

Another town I've left behind
Another drink, completely blind
Another hotel I can't find
Another backstage pass for you
Another tube of superglue
Another border to get through
I'm driving like a maniac
Driving my way to hell and back
Another room, a case to pack

We are the road crew

Another hotel we can burn
Another screw, another turn
Another Europe map to learn
Another truck stop on the way
Another game that I can play
Another word I learn to say
Another blasted customs post
Another bloody foreign coast
Another set of scars to boast

We are the road crew
That's right!
