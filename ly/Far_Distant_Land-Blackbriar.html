		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Upon the hill, one last time
I brought a gemstone to leave behind
And through the stones, I went
To that far distant land

Upon the hill, it still feels the same
I'm sure I can hear you calling my name
And through the stones, I went
To that far distant land

You are now a ghost from the past
Two hundred years went by so fast
But I can feel you in my soul
Like I know exactly where to go

You are now a ghost from the past
Two hundred years went by so fast
But I can feel you in my soul
Like I know exactly where to go

Upon the hill, one last time
I brought a gemstone to leave behind
And through the stones, I went
To that far distant land

A land I know so well
In which I left a part of myself
I am on my way
I'm sure I can hear you calling my name

I travel to days of yore
As I'm stepping through the stony door
I can feel you in my soul
Like I know exactly where to go

Our love is like the dragonfly in amber
Preserved in time
And I can feel you in my soul
Like I know exactly where to go

Upon the hill where the stones are standing
And a little blue forget-me-not
Waiting for the stones to start chanting
So they can take me back to you, my love

Back to you, back to you, back to you, my love

Upon the hill, one last time
I brought a gemstone to leave behind
And through the stones, I went
To that far distant land
