		  Yo, this shit is unbelievable
(Bangladesh)

Pressure
Pressure
Pressure, pressure
Need some pressure
Need some pressure (pressure)
This shit pressure (pressure)

This shit pressure (pressure)
Two BBL, you know she extra (know she extra)
Got that stank walk, but clean as a whistle (whistle)
In the kitchen, scale, fork, and a pistol (and a pistol)
Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, yeah, we cookin' now (cookin' now)
You know this shit pressure, 'cause they lookin' now (they lookin' now)
Say look out for me, but they wasn't lookin' out (lookin' out)
Got your shit together suki, suki now (suki, suki now)

More refills on me, you know we lit, lit (lit, lit)
They gon' run this back just like a pick-six (pick-six)
I done fell in love with a thick bitch (thick bitch)
I done fell in love with a rich bitch (talk to 'em)
Shawty know she pressure, talkin' high blood (high blood)
Put two girls together like a hybrid (like a hybrid)
You know I been trappin' since the dial-up (dial-up)
If they gon' hate, then let 'em hate, the money pile up (woo)
When your friend call, say, "Hello, pressure speakin'" (pressure speakin')
Towel under door, but that pressure reakin' (yeah)
I done took a shroom with the 42 (shit)
I done start whistlin' like 42 (shit)

Pressure
Pressure (yeah)
Pressure, pressure
Mhm, yeah, she pressure
Mhm, yeah, she pressure
Yeah, she pressure (yeah, pressure)

Uh, pressure busts pipes, the weapons talk nice
I only bust twice, 'cause I'm so precise
The foreign run nice, I'm whorin' all night
I don't handcuff her, and I read her her rights
I'm on that pressure, she on that bass
I'm on that treble, I'm on her level
She say her brother, he got them birds
We ruffle his feathers
Watch what you tell us, pressure cooker
Extra hoes, got my section full of
Smokin' dope, you can smell the boogers
Break your nose like Devin Booker
And all my hoes some second lookers
And I got bros with extra blickers
And I got Nina and I got Maggie
And they both got extra sisters
I be puttin' pressure on the plug
I get treated special by the plug
The feds puttin' pressure on me
But I don't even sweat in hot tubs
I be puttin' pressure on my lungs
I'ma fill the whole blunt with pressure
Like a stack of a hundred ones
You still will fold under pressure, lil' bitch

Pressure (yeah)
Pressure (yeah)
Pressure, pressure (yeah, yeah)
Need some pressure (yeah, yeah)
Need some pressure, pressure (yeah)
This shit pressure (lil' bitch)

This shit pressure (pressure)
Two BBL, you know she extra (extra)
Got that stank walk, but clean as a whistle (whistle)
In the kitchen, scale, fork, and a pistol (pistol)
Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, yeah, we cookin' now (we cookin' now)
You know this shit pressure, 'cause they lookin' now (they lookin' now)
Say look out for me, but they wasn't lookin' out (wasn't lookin' out)
Got your shit together suki, suki now (suki, suki now)

Pressure, pressure (suki, suki now)
Pressure, pressure (suki, suki now)
Pressure, pressure
Pressure, pressure (suki, suki now)
