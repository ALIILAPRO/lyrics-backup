		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got my eye on you boy
I got my eye on you boy
And when I get my eye on something it's like search and destroy
There's no running away
Not a game that I play
I wanna get to know you
So come on

We can dance, we can dance, we can dance, we can dance tonight
Come on just move your body
Come on just move your body
We can dance, we can dance, we can dance, we can dance tonight
'Cause your the one that I like
Don't ask me for my number
'Cause my number's undercover
Don't tell me that your going I just got here and I'm hoping

I'm not leaving without you
I'm not leaving without you
So stop looking at the clock
'Cause baby time's on my side
Tick tock, tick tock
Soon you'll be mine
I wanna know things about you
I'm not leaving without you

We can dance, we can dance, we can dance, we can dance tonight
Come on just move your body
Come on just move your body

So what ya got on your mind?
What ya got don't hide
I need to know that there is something more to you then those eyes
I need someone who's sweet
Someone who wants me for me
And when I'm not around he's not gonna cheat

We can dance, we can dance, we can dance, we can dance tonight
Come on just move your body
Come on just move your body
We can dance, we can dance, we can dance, we can dance tonight
'Cause your the one that I like
Don't ask me for my number
'Cause my number's undercover
Don't tell me that your going I just got here and I'm hoping

I'm not leaving without you
I'm not leaving without you
So stop looking at the clock
'Cause baby time's on my side
Tick tock, tick tock
Soon you'll be mine
I wanna know things about you
I'm not leaving without you

We can dance, we can dance, we can dance, we can dance tonight
Come on just move your body
Come on just move your body

I wanna know whatcha dream about
I wanna know whatcha thinking now
I wanna know whatcha dream about
I wanna know whatcha thinking now
And when the lights go down and you come around

Let me see what it's all about
I wanna know whatcha dream about
I wanna know whatcha thinking now
And when the lights go down and you come around

Let me see what it's all about
I wanna know whatcha dream about
I wanna know whatcha thinking now
And when the lights go down and you come around

Let me see what it's all about
I wanna know whatcha dream about
I wanna know whatcha thinking now
And when the lights go down and you come around
Let me see what it's all about
