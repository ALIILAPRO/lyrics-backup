		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So few cares and ever so unprepared
Mind, still not made up

And you sigh, there's so much I could've said
You try and keep strong
You sigh, there's so much I could've said
But I wasn't ready then and I'm still not

You sigh, there's so much I could've said
Don't cry, all day long
You sigh, there's so much I could've said
But I wasn't ready then and I'm still not
