		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ain't no need to worry
There ain't no use to cry
'Cause I'll be comin' home soon
To keep you satisfied

You know I get so lonely
That I feel I can't go on
And it feels so good inside baby
Just to call you on the telephone
An' I said...

Ooh baby I love you
What more can I say
Ooh baby I need you
I miss you more everyday

I woke up early this mornin'
As the sun came shining down
It found me wishin' and a'hoping
That you'd come back around

You know that I need you
More than the air I breathe
And I guess I'm just tryin' to tell you woman
Oh what you mean to me yeah, yeah

Ooh baby I love you
What more can I say
Ooh baby I need you
I miss you more everyday

I'm tryin' to tell you I love you
In each and every way
I'm tryin' to tell you I need your sweet loving
So much more and more every day
