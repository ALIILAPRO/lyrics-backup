		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Many nights we've prayed
With no proof anyone could hear
In our hearts a hopeful song
We barely understood
Now we are not afraid
Although we know there's much to fear
We were moving mountains long before we knew we could

There can be miracles when you believe
Though hope is frail
It's hard to kill
Who knows what miracle youcan achieve
When you believe somehow you will
You will when you believe

In this time of fear
When prayers so often proved in vain
Hope seemed the summer birds
To swiftly flown away
Yet now I'm standing here (now I'm standing here)
With heart so full I can't explain
Seeking faith and speaking words I never thought I'd say

There can be miracles when you believe
Though hope is frail
It's hard to kill
Who knows what miracle you can achieve
When you believe somehow you will
You will when you believe

There can be miracles when you believe
Though hope is frail
It's hard to kill
Who knows what miracle you can achieve
When you believe somehow you will
You will when you believe
