		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Scream a name
Or go insane
Now lie on the ground and be silent
Take a drink
And spit it out
You're gonna play the game and you'll like it
Take your pride and your mind
And recycle reality
Hail to the beasts
That corrupt humanity
Ahead or behind
Is the voice of clemency
I will kill you all
To secure my legacy
Light my
Way with the fires of the havoc
Fight the
Mass as it falls into panic
Listen when I say it's not fun anymore
I don't want to lose my mind anymore
I'm telling you that it's not fun anymore
I'm just fine
Now the fear
And the greed
It boils in your blood and it's toxic
On the ground
No way out
Your loyalty's eternal and we mock it
Maybe now I can see
That the servant is part of me
The lies that you speak are filled with tenacity
Now curl as you bleed
And your life feeds into me
Tomorrow you will see
The fall of the new regime
Light my
Way with the fires of the havoc
Fight the
Mass as it falls into panic
Listen when I say it's not fun anymore
I don't want to lose my mind anymore
I'm telling you that it's not fun anymore
I'm just fine
Go
Light the
Way with fires of the havoc
You can have it
Just another motherfucker that'll like it
As you burn up
And you fall down
Just remember that you're not
All alone now
Only cast out
Far away from
The people that are running to freedom
Spit it out now
Get it out now
It's up to you
Light my
Way with the fires of the havoc
Fight the
Mass as it falls into panic
Listen when I say it's not fun anymore
I don't want to lose my mind anymore
I'm telling you that it's not fun anymore
I'm just fine
