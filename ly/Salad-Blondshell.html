		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Keep an eye out for his pickup
I know all about it
I would take a gun out
Put some poison in his salad

And it wouldn't be so bad
It wouldn't hurt the world
Look what you did
You'll make a killer of a Jewish girl

And he did it to a lady
Oh, you have a family
How does someone end up
With a stone in a chest cavity?

It wouldn't be so bad
It wouldn't hurt the world
Look what you did
Now in my sleep I am a murderer

It doesn't happen to women I know
I put it in a box in a TV show
It doesn't happen to women I know
God, tell me why did he hurt my girl?

And she took him to the courthouse
And somehow he got off
Then I saw him laughing with his lawyer
In the parking lot

It wouldn't be so bad
It wouldn't hurt like this
Look what you did
You'll make a killer of a pacifist

It doesn't happen to women I know
I put it in a box in a TV show
It doesn't happen to women I know
God, tell me why did he hurt my girl?

Gonna get big, gonna get big, I'm so scary
I can't stop having visions of following him
Gonna make it hurt, gonna make it hurt
But I don't know how to do that within the framework
'Cause we were never violent, oh

Gonna get big, gonna get big, I'm so scary
I can't stop having visions of following him
Gonna make it hurt, gonna make it hurt
But I don't know how to do that within the framework
'Cause we were never violent

Gonna get big, gonna get big, I'm so scary
I can't stop having visions of following him
Gonna make it hurt, gonna make it hurt
But I don't know how to do that within the framework

'Cause we were never violent
'Cause we were never violent
'Cause we were never violent
