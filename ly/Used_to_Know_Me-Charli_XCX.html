		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You used to know me, now you don't
You used to hypnotize me, did it so easy
You, you, you, you

You had me 'round your finger
You had me on the floor
I used to be your angel
Now I'm walking out your door
You say I'm turning evil
I'll say I'm finally pure
Shine bright in my reflection
Think I lost myself before

Held me back, tied me up inside a cage
Had to change my life 'cause I knew you'd stay the same
Couldn't see you were standing in my way
I can see clearly now, now, now

You used to know me, now you don't
You used to hypnotize me, did it so easy
I'm finally free from your control
I don't need a kiss goodbye
I'm on my own tonight, oh

You used to know me, now you don't
You used to hypnotize me, did it so easy
I'm finally free from your control
I don't need a kiss goodbye
I'm on my own tonight, oh

I'm like a flower blooming
Since I left you behind
Don't know what I was doing
Thought your venom was divine
Knew you were turning evil
You said I lost my mind
No, you ain't gon' do me like that

Held me back, tied me up inside a cage
Had to change my life 'cause I knew you'd stay the same
Couldn't see you were standing in my way
I can see clearly now, now, now

You used to know me, now you don't
You used to hypnotize me, did it so easy (so)
I'm finally free from your control (control)
I don't need a kiss goodbye
I'm on my own tonight, oh
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah

La-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
(La-la-la-la) La-la-la-la-la-la
(La-la) La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la

You used to know me, now you don't
