		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Always out of place, I knew I needed something new for me
I never knew just what that was, yeah
Finding something safe was just like trying to catch a bird in flight
I knew that I would never touch

But now I won't let go
'Cause I'm happy to call this

Home
No more running
I'm good knowing
That I belong
(Happy to call this)
Home
I got loving
Inside this island
Don't care who knows it
(Happy to call this)
Home
(Oh way oh, oh way oh, oh way oh)
Happy to call this

Shedding all that insecurity, I kind of found a new me
I'm OK with how that feels, yeah
Being me was hard enough so being someone else was too much
All I want is something real

Now I won't let go
'Cause I'm happy to call this

Home
No more running
I'm good knowing
That I belong
(Happy to call this)
Home
I got loving
Inside this island
Don't care who knows it
(Happy to call this)
Home
(Oh way oh, oh way oh, oh way oh)
Oh I'm happy to call this

Home is where you're happy
Home is when you're right where you should be
Find where you're happy
'Cause I'm happy to call this

Home
No more running
I'm good knowing
That I belong
(Happy to call this)
Home
I got loving
Inside this island
Don't care who knows it
(Happy to call this)
Home
(Oh way oh, oh way oh, oh way oh)
Happy to call this
Home
Home
Home
Happy to call this
