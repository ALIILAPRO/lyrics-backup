		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fly, broken wings
I know you are still with me
All I need is a nudge to get me started

Fly, broken wings
To somewhere we can free
Closer to our "ideal"

Teary eyed
Once gentle soul
I watched as you rotted away
The mirror says
That I still remember hope
Mhm, mhm-mhm

You're doing what you love
Isn't that enough? Isn't that enough?
A genius, perfect job
Isn't that enough? Isn't that enough?
Again and again, you locked me down, I locked me down
We staked me to the ground
The soil gave me warmth

Please die, little dreams
Kill the camellias in me
Wouldn't it be easier to give in?
Why are these hands chasing dreams out of my reach?
Is my thirst for normalcy "odd"?

Fly, perfect wings (goodbye, goodbye, goodbye)
Where have you been hiding? (Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye)
Bring me to the mind that got us started
Fly, perfect wings (goodbye, goodbye, goodbye)
Show them who I can be (goodbye, goodbye, goodbye)
For the one last time, if you will
"That's all"
