		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, oh
Oh, oh

And now this could be the last of all the rides we take
So hold on tight and don't look back
We don't care about the message or the rules they make
We'll find you when the sun goes black

And you want to live forever in the lights you make
When we were young we used to say
That you only hear the music when your heart begins to break
Now we are the kids from yesterday

Oh, oh
Oh, oh

All the cameras watch the accidents and stars you hate
They only care if you can bleed
Does the television make you feel the pills you ate?
Or every person that you need to be

'Cause you wanna live forever in the lights you make
When we were young we used to say
That you only hear the music when your heart begins to break
Now we are the kids from yesterday

Today
today
We are the kids from yesterday
Today
today

Here we are and we won't stop breathing (today)
(Today) yell it out 'till your heart stops beating
We are the kids from yesterday, today

'Cause you wanna live forever in the lights you make
When we were young we used to say
That you only hear the music when your heart begins to break
Now we are the kids from yesterday

Oh, oh
We are the kids from yesterday
Oh, oh
We are the kids from yesterday
Oh, oh
We are the kids from yesterday
Oh, oh
Today, today
