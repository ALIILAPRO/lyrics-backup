		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Over the moon
Under the stars
Feel them arresting me
Unknowables
Fading at dawn
Troubles, too

Dimness sustains
Oh the regret
I could be lost to you
Lost in thought
Sending a kiss
Back to the sky

So has my world become
Run out of breath
I'm not the only one to lose a friend

Where do you go
You're going home

What do I do with the
Void in your shape
Leaving me frailty
A drop and I break

What do I do
With half of myself
Then when the stars align
With some kind of peace

I could be loved by you
Either way
Where did you go
You're going home

Then when the stars align
With some kind of peace

I know I'm loved by you
Either way
Where did you go
You're going home

Then when the stars align
With some kind of peace

I know I'm loved by you
Either way
Where did you go
You're going home

You're going home
