		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I want every bit of you 
But how could I be so selfish?
Your past and your future too 
But its not what I read on your lips
When you said you don't want me too
Is it just my ears that heard it?
But there's something in your tone's 
Got me staring at my phone

There's death in the air tonight 
It's colder than it should be 
In mind but you're out of sight
I just wanna feel you near me
I know its overdue 
But something in your tone's
Got me staring at my phone 

Carried away far far up above
To where the vultures scour the earth for remnants of your love
The blue ways heavy on my mind
I'm trying so hard just to leave you behind.
But it's a weariness that doesn't go away
And the night gets so much harder than the day.
An old kite in a strong wind
I feel it in my stomach as your razor cuts the string

This cave is as silent as death
I thought I caught the sound of your breath
The feeling of your fingers as they pressed against mine.
But the sublime and the divine play tricks on the mind
I through my heart against the wall
And it slides to the ground with a deep and heavy sound
That beats in time with an even deeper love 

I want every bit of you 
But how could I be so selfish?
Your past and your future too 
But its not what I read on your lips
When you said you don't want me too
Is it just my ears that heard it?
But there's something in your tone's 
Got me staring at my phone

There's death in the air tonight 
It's colder than it should be 
In mind but you're out of sight
I just wanna feel you near me
I know its overdue 
But something in your tone's
Got me staring at my phone
