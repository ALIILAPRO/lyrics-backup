		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I never meant to get us in this deep
I never meant for this to mean a thing
Oh, I wish you were the one
Wish you were the one that got away

I got caught up by the chase
And you got high on every little bit
I wish you were the one
Wish you were the one that got away

Oh, if I could go back in time
When you only held me in my mind
Just a longing, gone without a trace
Oh, I wish I never ever seen your face
I wish you were the one
Wish you were the one that got away

I miss the way you wanted me
When I was staying just out of your reach
Begging for the slightest touch
Ooh, you couldn't get enough, mmm

Oh, if I could go back in time
When you only held me in my mind
Just a longing, gone without a trace
Oh, I wish I never ever seen your face
I wish you were the one
Wish you were the one that got away

Got away from me
Got away from me
For anybody has to breathe

Oh, if I could go back in time
When you only held me in my mind
Just a longing, gone without a trace
Oh, I wish I never ever seen your face
I wish you were the one
I wish you were the one
Oh, I wish you were the one
I wish you were the one that got away
