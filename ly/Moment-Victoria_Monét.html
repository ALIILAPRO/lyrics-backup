		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got a feeling that you 
Brought me to you
Yeah, you did, babe
Look what your mind's imagination can do
Making shit true
Yeah, you do, babe

So let me take away your pain
Give me all of your emotions
Land it like a plane 
On my back if you can't hold it
Life is but a dream that you manifested slowly
So fuck a fantasy
This your motherfuckin' moment

(Give me all of your emotions) aye
This your motherfuckin' moment, yeah
(That you manifested slowly) aye
This your motherfuckin' moment

Life is but a dream
Here we are inside of it 
And you're inside of me
Until you actually fall asleep
Finally you can add this moment 
To your memory, ooh

Take away your pain
Give me all of your emotions
Land it like a plane 
On my back if you can't hold it
Life is but a dream that you manifested slowly
So fuck a fantasy
This your motherfuckin' moment

(Give me all of your emotions) aye
This your motherfuckin' moment, yeah
(That you manifested slowly) aye
This your motherfuckin' moment

(Give me all of your emotions) aye
This your motherfuckin' moment, yeah
(That you manifested slowly) aye
This your motherfuckin' moment

This your motherfuckin' moment, yeah hey
This your motherfuckin' moment
