		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Angel Eyes, that’s what she said
Twinkle Eyes, all in her head
I don’t mean to be so, magical
My G-Code
But now she’s catching feelings I’m not feeling
No, not me no
'Cause all I really wants your time, baby
I don’t want the love lately
I don’t want you, I don’t want you
Not for real
I just want tonight, baby
I don’t want the life lady
I don’t want to lie
Maybe, I just wanna chill
So are you down for the time being
Girl when I’m around we’ll get down to it
I will spell you bound, change your life through it
Girl the man you’ve found is
Mr. Right for right now
I know you’re ready, know you’re ready
But I’m not ready I’m contrary
Honey I don’t want to be the one to break your heart
Money and a little bit of time is all I’ve got
Temporary temporary
I'ma give you daily if you let me
Tell me if you’re down when I’m round I’ll play my part
Baby, if you like how that sound then we can start
Now meet me where I be at
You see the door all of your feelings where you leave that
So If you’re wit it I’m wit it
You can believe that
You can have time if you would like, to decide
Angel Eyes, that’s what she said
Twinkle Eyes, all in her head
'Cause all I really wants your time, baby
I don’t want the love lately
I don’t want you, I don’t want you
Not for real
I just want tonight, baby
I don’t want the life lady
I don’t want to lie
Maybe, I just wanna chill
So are you down for the time being
Girl when I’m around we’ll get down to it
I will spell you bound, change your life through it
Girl the man you’ve found is
Mr. Right for right now
I won’t get into it like that
Keep it low key
Keep it low key
Tight you ain’t living like that
Must be lonely
Must be lonely
(But with versace)
Antidopes, settled down don’t keep me waiting
Come alone don’t dress down be ready to face it
Face it, oh baby just be done and we’ll get wasted
Wasted, and if we cry we’ll do it in a Lamborghini
Angel Eyes, that’s what she said
Twinkle Eyes, all in her head
'Cause all I really wants your time, baby
I don’t want the love lately
I don’t want you, I don’t want you
Not for real
I just want tonight, baby
I don’t want the life lady
I don’t want to lie
Maybe, I just wanna chill
So are you down for the time being
Girl when I’m around we’ll get down to it
I will spell you bound, change your life through it
Girl the man you’ve found is
Mr. Right for right now
