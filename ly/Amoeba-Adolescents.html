		  Amoeba amoeba
Amoeba amoeba
Amoeba amoeba
Amoeba amoeba

We are the scientists in the lab
Looking through a microscope
The little glass slides they never lie
How can this small mind cope?

I've never seen anything like it before
This amoeba's got a mind of it's own
But don't turn your back you stupid science world
This is reaching for the telephone

Amoeba amoeba
Amoeba amoeba
Amoeba amoeba
Amoeba amoeba

A one celled creature a one celled thing
It hardly knows it's alive
You're better off dead if you only knew
Your growing life is taking a dive

I've never seen anything like it before
This amoeba's got a mind of it's own
But don't turn your back you stupid science world
This is reaching for the telephone

Amoeba amoeba
Amoeba amoeba
Amoeba amoeba
Amoeba amoeba

Amoeba amoeba
Amoeba amoeba 
Amoeba amoeba 
Amoeba amoeba (amoeba, amoeba, amoeba)
Amoeba amoeba (amoeba, amoeba, amoeba)
