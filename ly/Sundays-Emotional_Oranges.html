		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I see you more than I should and it hurts my pride
I'm affected by you (affected by you)
Then we go back and forth, undecided
You and I just spiral
Wonder why we fight it (wonder why we fight, oh yeah)

How could you ever question me?
Shit hit me in my chest today
I remember like it's yesterday
Gave you my best, you just gave it away

Sundays with you were special (special)
I still don't know how to let go (let go)
Why did you keep in touch? (Touch)
Thought we was deep in love (love)
You didn't believe in us
Boy, you forgot what we had (we had)

I need you more than I should
I can't help but love you
Although it hurts to trust you, but
Then we go back and forth
Girl, I'm tired, give you my undivided
Our love is so one-sided, look, look, look, look

How could you ever question me?
Shit hit me in my chest today
I remember like it's yesterday
Gave you my best, you just gave it away

Sundays with you were special (special)
I still don't know how to let go (let go)
Why did you keep in touch? (Touch)
Thought we was deep in love (love)
You didn't believe in us
Girl, you forgot what we had, we had

Ah, ah-ah
Ah, ah-ah
Ah, ah-ah
Girl, you forgot what we had, we had

You were on my side, babe
Now you running wild, babe
Running out of time, babe
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You were on my side, babe
Now you running wild, babe
Running out of time, babe
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

Sundays with you were special (special)
I still don't know how to let go (let go)
Why did you keep in touch? (Touch)
Thought we was deep in love (love)
You didn't believe in us
Girl, you forgot what we had, we had

Ah, ah-ah
Ah, ah-ah
Ah, ah-ah
Girl, you forgot what we had, we had
