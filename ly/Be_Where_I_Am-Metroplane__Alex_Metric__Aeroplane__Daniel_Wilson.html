		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Saved all our memories
Put it all into a jar of love
They keep me company

When you're too far away to touch
What you give is enough  but i want some more
Need you here but you’re gone, you’re gone
And I’m here for it all even when it’s hard
But it hurts when you're gone too long
I need you closer to me


Be where I am as fast as you can
Be where I am
Be where I am as fast as you can
Be where I am


Baby you need to know when I see you in the distance
You make me lose control, just a touch can make a difference

What you give is enough but I want some more
Need you here but you’re gone, you’re gone
And I’m here for it all even when its hard
But it hurts when you're gone too long
I need you closer to me


Be where I am as fast as you can
Be where I am
Be where I am as fast as you can
Be where I am
