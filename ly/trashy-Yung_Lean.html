		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lately, I've been makin' money, magic
But I'm caught up in the traffic
Killin' verses, that's a habit
Yeah, I'm always stackin', laser tracking
Always down to make it happen, wrapped in plastic
(Wrap it, wrap it up)
Remember back, back, addicts in the attic
I was working, Mickey D's, kinda trashy (yeah, I was working)
September feelings, but we lavish on the plane
Go to Paris, mass massacre, attacking

Yeah, I'm still flashy, knives of madness
I'm a bore, bank is slacky, get slackin'
Call me Alice, I've been poppin' a white rabbit
We gon' make it rain cabbage in the palace
Since a toddler, I've been swaggin'
Since a toddler, I've been having
I'm your uncle, not your daddy
Call me Alice, I've been poppin' a white rabbit
We gon' make it rain cabbage in the castle

Lately, I've been makin' money, magic
But I'm caught up in the traffic
Killin' verses, that's a habit
Yeah, I'm always stackin', laser tracking
Always down to make it happen, wrapped in plastic
(Wrap it, wrap it up)
Remember back, back, addicts in the attic
I was working, Mickey D's, kinda trashy (yeah, I was working)
September feelings, but we lavish on the plane
Go to Paris, mass massacre, attacking

I don't wanna see your face
We ride foreigns in the dirt
Lately, I've been coolin' playin' magic
My fucking name's savage, I got your bitch, bitch
