		  (Great John on the beat by the way)
Shot, everything dead
Four more shots to the, huh, huh
Four more shots to the, huh, huh
Four more shots to the

I called up my brother and he wouldn't ride it
I found out he told and that shit broke my heart
Anxiety running through my fucking veins
I'm thinkin' bout this shit, I feel pain in my heart
And I been going through it with my BM
I can't let her go, she was there from the start
And lately we've been breaking apart
They said I lost my glow, I'm tryna find my spark (grrah)

I tell bitches I love 'em, I just wanna fuck
I keep a smile but I'm hurting inside 
And they say they love me, I don't give a fuck
My baby a star so she got me struck
Know them niggas talking on me better duck
Like four-deep, four guns and a truck
I stay away, I be falling in love
But I'd rather her loyalty over her love
Like she a baddie, she look good in morning
And when I fuck up I never say I'm sorry
Like we go together cause' we both sluts
And if she call my phone I be there in a heartbeat
And she know I'm a demon but for her I'm soft
Like off the perky, on her I be sauced
She tell me she love me, bitch, I love you more
I know niggas envy, had to cut 'em off, bitch (bitch)

No, I don't like to party
Keep a choppa even though I'm a artist
Gotta watch who you know, I'm a target
They like, "How he gon' shine through the darkness?" Like
Uh, look what we started
R.i.p to love cause' that shit went departed
Tryna hold you like I hold my 40
But I'm watching your shit through a story
It get cold like it's snowing and shit
Keep a knocker, I'm throwing that shit
Said she say she love me, I'm already knowin' that shit
And I love her just hard for me showin' that shit
Had to stop with the lean, I was pourin'
When I'm sober this shit get boring
Hopped in the Lamb, hit gas, shit roarin'
On call, got lil' bro scorin', like
I want your love I just don't want the problems
Would you love me if I ain't have nothing?
He just a steppa, you know I be stompin'
I'm on go, you should tell me to stop it
I know it's makin' you sick but I'm sicker
I know you could get slick but I'm slicker
Baby, I'm not just a, uh, hol' on
Baby, I'm not just a regular nigga

I called up my brother and he wouldn't ride it
I found out he told and that shit broke my heart
Anxiety running through my fucking veins
I'm thinkin' bout this shit, I feel pain in my heart
And I been going through it with my BM
I can't let her go, she was there from the start
And lately we've been breaking apart
They said I lost my glow, I'm tryna find my spark
