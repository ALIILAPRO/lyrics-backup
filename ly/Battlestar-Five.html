		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yo I'm a battlestar knight like I'm jedi 
Rough to the tough but I'm sharper than the geam in your eye 
Galactic battlestar like I'm ready 
Ready for the 12 check get steady, on your marks set 
your best to throw you hands high 
Heads to the sky keep your eyes peeled listen for the sign 
A trip stage walk wire, I bring fire till I'm done 
you cause there can only be one 

How many times does it sound like this 
here we come again the microphone specialists 
Action time 
Take back the track rewind 
sing it for me one more time 

If you feel the force throw your hands to the sky 
Put your hands up, get em' up, put your hands high 
If you want to jump we can give you what you want 
Put your hands up, get em' up, put your hands high 

If you feel the force throw your hands to the sky 
Put your hands up, get em' up, put your hands high 
If you want to jump we can give you what you want 
Put your hands up, get em' up, put your hands high

I lead the packs like Bruce Wayne leads da batz 
Rocking top hats with my verbal attacks 
yo when I raps boogie down 
can you hear the bell tower ring when you're time travelling from 
The funk that I bring fly wit me 
I'll take you higher when I'm walking over fire, come on follow the messiah 
I run jump skips over battle ships 
Doing lyrical back flips on the stage that I rips 

How many times does it sound like this 
Here we come again the microphone specialists 
action time 
take back the track rewind 
sing it for me one more time 

If you feel the force throw your hands to the sky 
Put your hands up, get em' up, put your hands high 
If you want to jump we can give you what you want 
Put your hands up, get em' up, put your hands high 

If you feel the force throw your hands to the sky 
Put your hands up, get em' up, put your hands high 
If you want to jump we can give you what you want 
Put your hands up, get em' up, put your hands high

How many times does it sound like this 
Here we come again the microphone specialists 
action time 
take back the track rewind 
sing it for me one more time 

If you feel the force throw your hands to the sky 
Put your hands up, get em' up, put your hands high 
If you want to jump we can give you what you want 
Put your hands up, get em' up, put your hands high 

If you feel the force throw your hands to the sky 
Put your hands up, get em' up, put your hands high 
If you want to jump we can give you what you want 
Put your hands up, get em' up, put your hands high
