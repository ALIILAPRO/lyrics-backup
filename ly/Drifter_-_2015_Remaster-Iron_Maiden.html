		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Walk away
 
Look out now, baby, won't you take me away?
Sittin' here, think it's gonna be a new day
Gotta get my song and I can't go wrong
Gotta keep on roaming, gotta sing my song
 
What you feeling when you hold me tight?
I'm gonna cuddle up to you tonight
Gonna get you feeling so secure
Listen, child, don't you see there's a cure?
Anyway got to get you away
Feels so good, think it's gonna be a new day
I'm gonna get my song 'til I can't go on
I've gotta keep on roaming, gotta sing my song
 
Ooh, yeah, oh-oh, oh
Ooh-ooh, ooh, yeah
Oh-oh, oh
I keep on drifting 

What you feeling when you hold me tight?
I'm gonna cuddle up to you tonight
Gonna get you feeling so secure
Listen, child, don't you see there's a cure?
ooh, yeah
Anyway, got to get you away
Feels so good, think it's gonna be a new day
I'm gonna get my song 'til I can't go on
I've gotta keep on roaming gotta sing my song
I want rock and roll, ooh, yeah


Gonna sing my song, yeah and It won't take long 
I'm gonna sing my song, yeah 
I want you to sing along 
 
I want you to sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it along
I want you to sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it along
I want you to sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it along
I want you to sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it along

'Cause I'm a drifter
Drifting on
Yeah
