		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Oh, what time is it, man?)

You're lifting me up
That dopamine high
Oh, I'm addicted to taking your lies
I'm breathing you in
You're smoking me out
And I feel like I'm coming down

And baby
Why you gotta be so complicated?
I've been trying not to lose my patience
But you keep phoning me intoxicated

Why'd you only call me after midnight?
It's not right
You only call me when you're high
Always after midnight
Every time
Controlling my mind
Why'd you only call me after midnight?

Mm, mm, mm
You only call me after midnight
Mm, mm, mm
You only call me after midnight

You give me a rush
I'm not seeing straight
The taste of your lips makes me hallucinate
The touch of your skin
I feel in my soul
When I'm with you I overdose

And baby
Why you gotta be so complicated?
I've been trying not to lose my patience
But you keep phoning me intoxicated

Why'd you only call me after midnight?
It's not right
You only call me when you're high
Always after midnight
Every time
Controlling my mind
Why'd you only call me after midnight?

Mm, mm, mm
You only call me after midnight
Mm, mm, mm
You only call me after midnight

Calling me after midnight
Calling me after midnight
Calling me after midnight
You only call me after midnight?
Calling me after midnight
Calling me after midnight
Calling me after
Why'd you only call me after midnight?
