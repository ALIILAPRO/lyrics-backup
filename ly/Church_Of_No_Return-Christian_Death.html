		  Church Of No Return-Christian Death


In the beginning there was sinning
And in the end, well, let's pretend
Blessed is the fruit I dare you
To take another bite of it
And somehow I think you will
In spite of it

O'no no no no no no no passion like a hurricane
O'no no no no no no no is desire a ball and chain
O'no no no no no no no passion like a hurricane
Sweet sixteen with a letter between
Mother, virtue won't you explain?

Harvest of victims for the church of no return

In the beginning there was sinning
And we made love like animals
Out of wedlock
Away back when it was the laws of nature
Not gods or men
And in the end, well, let's pretend

O'no no no no no no no passion like a hurricane
O'no no no no no no no is desire a ball and chain
O'no no no no no no no passion like a hurricane
Sweet sixteen with a letter between
Mother, virtue won't you explain?

Harvest of victims for the church of no return

In the beginning a hurricane
Transgressed the law
And there was fire and desire, passion and smoke
And from the mist that chilled the ashes
Came the men
With the words of right and wrong, huh!

Yea let's pretend again
