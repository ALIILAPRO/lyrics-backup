		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh well uh, you might think I'm crazy
To hang around with you
Or maybe you think I'm lucky
To have somethin' to do
But I think that you're wild
Inside me is some child

You might think I'm foolish
Or maybe it's untrue
(You might think I'm crazy)
You might think I'm crazy
(All I want is you)
All I want is you

You might think it's hysterical
But I know when you're weak
You think you're in the movies
And everything's so deep
But I think that you're wild
When you flash that fragile smile

You might think it's foolish
What you put me through
(You might think I'm crazy)
You might think I'm crazy
(All I want is you)
All I want is you

And it was hard so hard to take
(So hard to take)
(There's no escape)
There's no escape
Without a scrape
(Without a scrape)
But you kept it going till the sun fell down
You kept it going

Oh well uh, you might think I'm delirious
The way I run you down
But somewhere sometimes
When you're curious
I'll be back around
Oh, I think that you're wild
And so uniquely styled

You might think it's foolish
This chancy rendezvous
(You might think I'm crazy)
You might think I'm crazy
(All I want is you)
All I want is you, aoo
All I want is you
(All I want is you)
All I want is you
