		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Drag my tongue across the sand
So happy just to crawl across the land
Soon I'll be the best around
I'm gonna keep my plunder underground
Hard flesh cold against the rain
Dust billowing around my brazen brain
Saw off all my stinking limbs
Blood dripping down my sunken money chin

Baby can you leave it in the (distant past)?
Baby can you leave it in the (distant past)?
Girl, I'm from the very very (distant past)
Girl, I'm from the very very (distant past)
Baby can you leave me in the (distant past)?
Baby can you leave me in the (distant past)?
Girl, I wanna take you to the (distant past)
Girl, I wanna take you to the (distant past)

Take me to the distant past, I want to go back
Save me from the distant past, I wanna survive

Take me to the distant past, I want to go back
Save me from the distant past, I wanna survive

Two thumbs across the Rubicon
Slack jaw but you'll never be passing it on
Plug hole, down the drain you go
Your body never made it past the snow
Canine fangs about my throat
You're bleeding over Eden like a goat
Tall blade dripping in every field
I'm blooming like a fuming human shield

Baby can you leave it in the (distant past)?
Baby can you leave it in the (distant past)?
Girl, I'm from the very very (distant past)
Girl, I'm from the very very (distant past)
Baby can you leave me in the (distant past)?
Baby can you leave me in the (distant past)?
Girl, I wanna take you to the (distant past)
Girl, I wanna take you to the (distant past)

Take me to the distant past, I want to go back
Save me from the distant past, I wanna survive

Take me to the distant past, I want to go back
Save me from the distant past, I wanna survive

Past, past, past, past, past, past

Take me to the distant past, I want to go back
Save me from the distant past, I wanna survive
