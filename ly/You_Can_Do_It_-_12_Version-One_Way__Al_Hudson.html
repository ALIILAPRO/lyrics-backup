		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dance, let your body go you know you can do it
Like me, eenie meenie minie moe, there's really nothin' to it
Dance, let your body go you know you can do it
Like me, eenie meenie minie moe, there's really nothin' to it

You can do it and you know that you can
There's nothing to it, just go ahead
And do your dance
You can do it and you know that you can
There's nothing to it, just go ahead
And do your dance

Get up and do your thing, you know you can do it
And don't you be ashamed, there's really nothing to it
Get up and do your thing, you know you can do it
And don't you be ashamed, there's really nothing to it

You'll know you can do it, so get up
And move your body to it
Don't be afraid to do your thing
No such word as being ashamed, everybody boogie tonight

Get up and do your thing, you know you can do it
