		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Your sin gonna waste you brother
No way you'll be alright
You're fuckin' with the wrong wolf baby
Darkness gonna break your light
No prayer gonna part my thunder
No one's gonna change my mind
You're fuckin' with sickness baby
Your heart is a plague on mine

I am a missile
I am the fire
Love is destruction
But this war is mine, this war is mine
I am a missile
I am the fire
Love is destruction
But this war is mine, this war is mine
I am the missile

Vengeance is a cold thing baby
I serve it on a bed of pain
Still think you a hot one baby?
We'll see when the missile reigns yeah
Reigns yeah

I am the missile
I am the fire
Love is destruction
But this war is mine
This war is mine
I am the missile
I am the fire
Love is destruction
But this war is mine
This war is mine
I am the missile

I am the missile

I am the missile
I am the fire
Love is destruction
This war is mine

I am the missile
I am the fire
Love is destruction
But this war is mine
This war is mine

I am the missile
I am the fire
Love is destruction
But this war is mine
This war is mine

I am the missile
I am the missile
