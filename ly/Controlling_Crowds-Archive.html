		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Why are you so scared and creeping around?
Taking photographs all over town
Pictures in the dark that live in the light
The world is my playground too and I'll do what I like
Why are you so scared of falling apart
Intimidating me for falling apart
Stay on your knees with your cross and don't tell me you know so
The world is my playground too and I refuse to follow

Fly with me
Falling through the night
Fly with me 
Falling out of sight
Find me
Hold me

In your arms
'Cause I'm scared of their controlling crowds
Keep me calm
'Cause I'm scared of their controlling crowds
Here they come

Why are we so obscure and creeping around?
Hiding from mirrors and screens all over town
Objects disturbing blinding takin' the peace in me
The world is my kingdom too and I'll feel what I like in me

Killing my heart, I can't face, I can't face no more
Killing my heart, I can't face, I can't face no more
Killing my heart, I can't face, I can't face no more
Killing my heart, I can't face, I can't face no more
Killing my heart, I can't face, I can't face no more
Killing my heart, I can't face, I can't face no more
Killing my heart, I can't face, I can't face no more
Killing my heart, I can't face, I can't face no more

The world is my playground too, I can't feel anymore

Fly with me
Falling through the night
Fly with me 
Falling out of sight
Find me
Hold me

In your arms
'Cause I'm scared of their controlling crowds
Keep me calm
'Cause I'm scared of their controlling crowds
Here they come

Why are we so cold and breaking apart?
Caught up in this storm just breaking apart
Pictures of colors I loved but don't see anymore
The world is my playground too, I don't feel anymore
Why are you so adored (adored, adored, adored, adored, adored)
(Adored, adored, adored, adored, adored, adored, adored, adored)

'Cause I'm scared of their controlling crowds
Here they come
'Cause I'm scared of their controlling crowds
Here they come
'Cause I'm scared of their controlling crowds
Here they come
'Cause I'm scared of their controlling crowds
Here they come
