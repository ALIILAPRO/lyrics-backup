		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's killing you, you're killing me,
I'm clinging on to my sanity,
All I need is a short term remedy,
Come and hide me from this terrible reality

Dreaded memories flood back to me,
But there's still a willful mind behind these cold,
Psychotic eyes,
Now I tread this path so differently,
I've opened my mind and darkened my entire life.

I'll dance with the angels to celebrate the holocaust,
And far beyond my far gone pride,
Is knowing that we'll soon be gone,
Knowing that I'll soon be gone
