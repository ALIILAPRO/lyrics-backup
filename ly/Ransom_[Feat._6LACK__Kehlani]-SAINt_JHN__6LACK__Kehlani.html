		  (Told Lee he'd be a millionaire)

Holidays in California, quite strange
The height change but the sight same
I'm just adjustin' to the price change
The truth is I'm just in a better price range
The Saint Laurents and the dice game
That's just fly talk, that's just sky slang
I'm just ballin', I'm ballin, I'm really ballin'
Strip club like I'm tryna win a Heisman
The applause first, then the spite came
Tryna kill my pain in the Sprite can
The top off in a strange way, I'm tryna fight fame

Am I still sharin' my location with you?
Feels like I'm on probation with you
Too hard to have a rotation with you
I love you on occasion but you
Fuck it up way too much
Fuck it up way too much
You like to fight too much
You like to play too rough

I like when you're short skirt and your heels
And you're not in your feels
I cover the bills
Oh, what a thrill, what a thrill
If you call and I don't reply
And you text and I just don't answer
It don't mean that I changed my mind
It just means that I don't pay ransom
You walk out and you don't say bye
And I don't wanna speak out of anger
And I won't be held for ransom, I'm too handsome

What you say on the way? Time to pray, have faith
From the temple, extra ordinary brain, gotta say, ayy
You look so excited, I can tell by your face
But to me it's just an ordinary day
You want me to take a vacation with you
You just better hope I stay patient with you
We gon' need some de-escalation, can you talk to me nice?
I got you a gift, but you fuck it up way too much
The situation way too us
Want peace like deuce up, why your dukes up?
I'm tryna drown my pain in a fuckin' two cup
Lost too many niggas, I ain't tryna lose touch

Gotta share my location with you
Feels like I'm on probation with you
Too hard to have a rotation with you
I love you on occasion but you
Fuck it up way too much
Fuck it up way too much
You like to fight too much
You like to play too rough

I like when you're short skirt and your heels
And you're not in your feels
I cover the bills
Oh, what a thrill, what a thrill
If you call and I don't reply
And you text and I just don't answer
It don't mean that I changed my mind
It just means that I don't pay ransom
You walk out and you don't say bye (bye)
And I don't wanna speak out of anger
And I won't be held for ransom
I'm too handsome
