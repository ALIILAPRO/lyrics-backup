		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I drive across bridges so worried 'bout falling
That I miss the view
Already watching the news report saying
There was nothing anyone could do

In my mind
What if I fall?
But if it's in my mind

What if I fly?
Get a little higher
Get out of my head for a minute
And just feel the wind on my face
Maybe the fear
Just means I'm alive
Maybe I'll fall
But what if I 

Fly
Fly
Fly
What if I, what if I

I think of you, pick up my phone
Then put it down it again
There's no way for you to reply
To the messages I never send

In my mind
We'd never fall in love
But what if I'm on your mind?

What if I fly?
Get a little higher
Get out of my head for a minute
And just feel the wind on my face
Maybe the fear
Just means I'm alive
Maybe I'll fall
But what if I

Fly
Fly
Fly
What if I, what if I

Yeah, when I get to the end of my life
I wanna know that I used my time

So what if I fall
Straight out of the sky?
Would I rather look back and wonder
Or know that I actually tried?

What if I fly? (Yeah)
Get a little higher
Get out of my head for a minute
And just feel the wind on my face (yeah)
Maybe the fear (maybe the fear)
Just means I'm alive
Maybe I'll fall
But what if I

Fly
Fly (fly)
Fly
What if I, what if I

Fly
Fly
Fly
