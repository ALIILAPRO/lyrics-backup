		  (4PLAY, 4PLAY)
Woo, uh (Diztortion)

Slim waist, big bum (big bum)
Rolex, Datejust
Said she's got a man, so what?
My wrist froze, ice block
Six-car convoy, roadblock
Why the ugly ones always gotta cockblock?
Went platinum, still on the block
I won't fuck if her energy's off

Apart from money, a nigga needs love
Apart from shank, also use guns
Apart from weed, kids don't do drugs
Apart from coke, my nigga sell drugs
I love my girl but her problem opor
I was in the streets, you ain't in the streets
She sent me her postcode 'cause she in the streets
(She sent me her postcode 'cause she in the streets)

She said she got a man, heard that before
She still hit it raw on my bedroom floor
I feel sorry for my man, cool guy (cool guy)
Does he know what his girl's doing in Dubai?
Anyway, life's fucked, we turn up (uh)
Invest in defense, that's cash on a Glock
Shit, still turning up the block (huh)
From the block to the top of the pops

Slim waist, big bum (big bum)
Rolex, Datejust
Said she's got a man, so what?
My wrist froze, ice block
Six-car convoy, roadblock
Why the ugly ones always gotta cockblock?
Went platinum, still on the block
I won't fuck if her energy's off

She had them beads on her waist, it was hypnotizing
Ass so fat, we had to sneak the thighs in
Chew my earlobe like she Mike Tyson
Baby girl, I hope you know I don't like fighting
I keep it in my notes but still need reminding
Most of my niggas still on the block grinding
Demon time 'cause she satanic
Do him like Kodak, I might snipe him

Rude Ghana boy, they call me Akwei (Akwei)
I scoop her from her friend like, "we'll be back, chale"
I push the D in, have her screaming out, "Adjei!" (Adjei, yeah)
Look, long dreads, big waps, she love all of that
Operate the frontline, I'm the quarterback (I am)
He was tweaking 'til he turned into a quarter pack (stretch that)
Six figures, rich drillers
Nod my head and watch my little brother slaughter that

Slim waist, big bum (big bum)
Rolex, Datejust
Said she's got a man, so what?
My wrist froze, ice block
Six-car convoy, roadblock
Why the ugly ones always gotta cockblock?
Went platinum, still on the block
I won't fuck if her energy's off

She just wanna sex me and spend my money
I just wanna eat Banku and smoke on Cali
Don't worry about my friend over there in that Bally
He's a good yute but he turned one Cali (stretch that)
Anywhere, I gotta have it, it's a habit
Stage show, award show, you know we brang it
And lately, I been feeling myself
Name a girl I can't bag, I bet I pull up and I bag it

If you lean on me, you might learn something
She keep calling me Black Jesus
If you come with me, I go make you cum
Pull out game sweet, I don't want no bump
I don't slow down, fuck a speed bump
My own President, no, I don't mean Trump
Need therapy 'fore my brain burst
This not therapy, no, these are just words

Yo, I was done before the night done
Still on action when I'm off set
I don't play fair 'cause there's no rules
Your next caption was my old moves
Live most of my life off brand
I'm capable of anything, I don't think you understand
Fuck her in the pool and I can't even swim
Her ass is so fat but the waist so thin

Slim waist, big bum (big bum)
Rolex, Datejust
Said she's got a man, so what?
My wrist froze, ice block
Six-car convoy, roadblock
Why the ugly ones always gotta cockblock?
Went platinum, still on the block
I won't fuck if her energy's off
