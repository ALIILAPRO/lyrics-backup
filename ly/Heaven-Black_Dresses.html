		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm just meat without a soul without a brain
Without anything an animal

I'm just meat without a soul without a brain
Without anything an animal

I have no spirit everlasting

I love feelin' pain
Makes me feel like I'm going to heaven
Makes me feel like I'm going to heaven
Makes me feel like I'm going to heaven
I love being in pain
Makes me feel like I'm going to heaven
Makes me feel like I'm going to heaven
Makes me feel like i'm going to heaven

The night explodes in the light
From a shooting star
All things beautiful and warm
Reflected in your heart
And all brokеn creatures are
Pеrfect just the way they are
But it's easy to be disillusioned
When you don't know who you are

Ok uhh (clears throat) uh yea

I'm nothing i'm less than nothing
I'm just spit in the wind

That's- that's so wonderful
Isn't it beautiful?
I know that you are doing good!
Every sunrise brings a new tomorrow!

The night explodes in the light
From a shooting star
It's easy to become disillusioned
When you don't know who you are
And it can live forever in your heart
It can live forever in your heart
Forever in your heart
It can live forever in your
Sick pathetic little heart
