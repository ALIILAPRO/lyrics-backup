		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Are you happy? Saw your new man
Shit is tacky
Talking 'bout me like you know me
Shit is tacky
All the small talk, baby, you could keep that
Yeah, I'm hungry but I'm cool on the feedback
Got a free pass outta town and I need that
Got a big crib in the woods just to relax
Giving O's to my ex-bitch, it's the relapse
He don't know where she at
I could drop a pin and you wouldn't know where we at
I know what you want and I didn't wanna be that 
couldn't really be that
Tried to show you what I mean you couldn't even see that
Tried to give you all of me and baby got me

So sick, so sick of the love songs
So sick, so sick of the fuck shit
So sick (yeah)
Got me so sick
Tried give you all of me and, baby, got me
So sick, so sick of the love songs
So sick, so sick of the fuck shit
So sick (yeah)
Got me so sick

Ayy
I could make hard work look easy
Need two to myself, yeah, I'm greedy
Flew 'em out to Paris, yeah, oui, oui
Yeah, Eiffel Tower like oui, oui (yeah)
We both like kissin' girls oui, oui (yeah)
Bitch, you get the message like you CC'd
And I see 'em both sides like Chanel
And I see both sides (yeah)
Come and see me on the house on the hill
Eye contact with the pilot, for real
Right on track, I'm doubted, for real
IRS 'cause I count that for real
And I tax that too

So sick, so sick of the love songs
So sick, so sick of the fuck shit
So sick (yeah)
Got me so sick
Tried give you all of me and, baby, got me
I'm so sick, so sick of the love songs
So sick, so sick of the fuck shit
So sick (yeah)
I'm so sick
