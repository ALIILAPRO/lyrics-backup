		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was walking through icy streams
That took my breath away
Moving slowly through westward water
Over glacial plains

And I walked off you
And I walked off an old me
Oh me, oh my, I thought it was a dream
So it seemed

And now, breathe deep, I'm inhaling
You and I, there's air in between
Leave me be, I'm exhaling
You and I, there's air in between

(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh)
(Ooh-ooh, ooh)
You and I, there's air in between
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh)
(Ooh-ooh, ooh)

Cut my hair so I could rock back and forth
Without thinkin' of you
Learned to talk and say
Whatever I wanted to

And I walked off you
And I walked off an old me
Oh me, oh my, I thought it was a dream
So it seemed

And now, breathe deep, I'm inhaling
You and I, there's air in between
Leave me be, I'm exhaling
You and I, there's air in between

(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh)
(Ooh-ooh, ooh) (ooh)
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh)
(Ooh-ooh, ooh)
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh)
(Ooh-ooh, ooh)
You and I, there's air in between
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh)
(Ooh-ooh, ooh)
You and I, there's air in between
