		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What it do, baby?
It's Paul Wall, come on

Purple pint, that's Gucci rap
Driving slow, black on black
Backwood lit, windows cracked
Dime in my lap with her hair pulled back
And a hand full of diamonds all on my wrist
Mouth full of ice, pardon my lisp
World full of haters, very few real
So I open my mind and stack up my chips
Lollipop grind, whole lotta licks
From paper planes to a house made of bricks
Big ol' cold cup with codeine mix
So I'm so throwed and I'm still gettin' lit
And everything is purple, baby

I said, everything is purple (swag)
Everything is purple (swag, swag, swag)
I said, everything is purple (swag)
Everything is purple (swag, swag, swag)

Trill OG and I rep the South
Nigga, I rep the streets and I rep the hood
And I'm grippin' grain, grippin' stains
And I'm flippin' mane so it's pretty good
I'm holdin' wood with diamonds on it
Hittin' the block and I'm grindin' on it
With a big ol' chain and a big ol' piece
'Cause when I'm in these streets I be shinin', homie
Haters better get they ass behind me, homie
'Cause I'm in the front and I'm takin' charge
And when I'm done, I have 'em homie run
And they be hard to find like they's El Debarge
And my swag is large, extra large
I can barely fit it up in this room
But don't sweat the size and don't be surprised
When your bitch reminds that I'm the shit to swoon
I lick the blunt and I pass the 'dro
Spit my game and I smash your hoe
But no, I ain't trick, it's no passin' dough
Then I hop up in this slab and I mash it, bro
I got a passion for this Southern flow
This that purple life and we thuggin', bro
These haters might not really understand it
But that's all good 'cause we love it though
This PAT, that's where I'm from
That's what I rep and that's how it go
I roll with rocks so get up off the jock
From New York to PA, this that purple flow
It's that swag

I said, everything is purple (swag)
Everything is purple (swag, swag, swag)
I said, everything is purple (swag)
Everything is purple (swag, swag, swag)

Purple swag, purple swag, I'm in the zone, I'm getting throwed
That purple swag, purple swag, that purple smoke up in my clothes
That big booty, juicy fruity, yellow bone, I wanna bone
I'm getting dome, I took her out, dick in her mouth, she getting on
I'm flexing steel, I'm flexing still, I'm sitting high, I'm tipping slow
I'm Texas trill, Texas trill, but in NY we spit it slow
I got these boppas going crazy, they see me comin'
Robitussin, quit discussin', A$AP, tell these niggas somethin'

I said, everything is purple (swag)
Everything is purple (swag, swag, swag)
I said, everything is purple (swag)
Everything is purple (swag, swag, swag)

Haha yeah
Check, one, two, what it do?
Run it

Fo's spinnin' like the shit under my wave cap
Just rock it like a nigga named A$AP
Fast money man, I get mine ASAP
Always stacking and I'm paid, that's ASAP
Wood grippin', candy drippin'
Four in my 20, I'm candy sippin'
Fill my prescription, I'm leanin', hoe
Nightmare cup, I'm dreamin', hoe
Trill nigga like Chad and Bun B
Crocodile seats insides, I'm Dundee
Slow that down, Screw, Watts or Ron C
I'm getting rap money but I used to run D
MC, rep, run it
Frank Cyser shit, any beat get punished
Y'all got problems, I get money
So my neck, fist, wrist always look sunny
I stay fresh, y'all niggas look bummy
Cold with the flow, so I ball like Tommy
Martin, I keep a yellow bone like Gina
Thick like Serena, my pockets on Venus, nigga

(Swag) Everything is purple (swag)
Everything is purple (swag, swag, swag)
I said, everything is purple (swag)
Everything is purple (swag, swag, swag)
