		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This ain't where the legends come from
You're not what a hero looks like
Pretty little flower, won't you sit back down and go play nice?

So keep talking, keep laughing
One day you'll wish you hadn't
All the people want fire, fire
Maybe it's time they meet their dragon

If you're gonna hold me down
You're not gonna let me in
Into your castle walls
None of you can keep them

'Cause if I gotta
Bu-bu-burn it all down
Then we'll burn it all down
My, oh my, look at who ends up bigger this time
And if I gotta
B-b-break it all down
Then let's break it all down
Bye, bye, bye
Playing with fire
And we'll burn it all down (down, down, down, down)

This is where the bruises come from
This is when the game gets ugly
These blood, sweat, tears keep running
Licking my plate 'cause I'm so hungry

Keep talking, keep laughing
One day you'll see what happens
All the people want fire, fire
It's about time they meet their dragon

If you're gonna hold me down
And you're not gonna let me in
Into your castle walls
None of you can keep them

'Cause if I gotta
Bu-bu-burn it all down
Then we'll burn it all down
My, oh my, look at who ends up bigger this time
And if I gotta
B-b-break it all down
Then let's break it all down
Bye, bye, bye
Playing with fire
And we'll burn it all down (down, down, down, down)

It starts right now
Baby, you're surrounded
Put your money where your mouth is
Bury your doubts under the ground
And they gonna watch you step over the ashes
Right now I'm taking my turn with the matches

'Cause if I gotta
Bu-bu-burn it all down
Then we'll burn it all down
My, oh my, look at who ends up bigger this time
And if I gotta
B-b-break it all down
Then let's break it all down
Bye, bye, bye
Playing with fire
And we'll burn it all down
