		<p>
		  (Fuck the fire, we got grease)
I love Tee (it's a Wayne beat), I love Tee
I love Tee, I love Tee Grizzley
I love Tee, I love Tee
I love Tee, I love Tee Grizzley

Ay, you know that nigga Tee? (You know him?)
He really my cousin
He used to sell work, I'm the reason he was plugged in (I plugged him)
I remember when he made his first song
We was best friends, now he rich, we don't get along (he ghosted)
When he blew up, I told that nigga put me on a track (put me on there)
It shouldn't really matter if I don't know how to rap (I'm weak)
He hoed me, so you know I had to get him back
I been runnin' 'round tellin' everybody he a rat (nah)
He ain't really tell but I know they gon' believe me
I know I ain't shit, but, one day, he gon' need me (one day)
I'm really in my feelings 'cause he ain't never feed me (I'm broke)
My bitch met him, now she talkin' like she 'bout to leave me (man)
You know that nigga Tee? (Yeah)
That was my nigga
Brodie know I'm loyal and I'm a real killer (for real?)
He start beefin' wit' niggas that really had the bag (he did?)
I told his opps like, "Don't put me in all that" (for real?)
I ain't heard from him since (damn)
Then I saw him shootin' out of town with my bitch (where they goin'?)
So I went and posted up a picture with a blick (a .40)
And tagged him, niggas know I'm really with the shit (I'm like that)
But I was really sick (man)
He hit my DM, like, "We ain't beefin', bro"
"I just hit her once, I ain't really tryna keep the ho" (steal yo' bitch)
He on some I-ain't-tryna-beef-over-a-ho shit (he was)
I post a message, made it look like he on ho shit (I lied)
I know that nigga mama, I know that nigga daddy (I do)
I know that nigga aunties (I do), I know that nigga granny (I do)
All the bros tellin' me to stop goin' at him
But every time I see that nigga out, I'm blowin' at him (I'm on that)
Y'all know that nigga Tee? We got history
I know that boy remember me (know he do)
When he got out of prison, I put him on his feet (I did)
I had a job at Mcdonald's makin' sure we eat (I gave him forty dollars)
But when he got a record deal, that nigga switched (changed)
He ain't never answer for me, actin' like a bitch (he changed)
I seen him up a hunnid K, it had me in my feelings (a hunnid
So I quit my job, brodie makin' all the millions (he gon' take care of me)
I left my bitch and everything, but it's all good (damn)
I bet that nigga fall off, money on the wood (I bet it)
I bounce back, I'm gettin' money, all I do is jugg (that's all I do)
And I told that nigga he can't come back to the hood (he can't)
All the bullshit he did, we should make a list (make a list)
Or we can turn up in the booth, bro, let's make a diss (let's go viral)
Know that nigga got them killas and they shakin' shit (and they killin' shit)
Our best bet is to say "fuck it" and make a wish, damn (let's do it)
I just wish he woulda plugged me
I tried to get his attention with a subtweet
This lyin' and hatin' don't work, that nigga still rich
I be talkin' crazy, but on some real shit
(On some real shit, on some real shit, on some real shit)

I love Tee (I love Tee), I love Tee (I love Tee)
I love Tee (that's my nigga), I love Tee (ay, that's brodie)
I love Tee (my best friend), I love Tee Grizzley (I love that nigga)
I love Tee (he the GOAT), I love Tee Grizzley (no cap)
I love Tee (I love that nigga), I love Tee (yeah, that's brodie)
I love Tee (that's my mans), I love Tee (ay, he the GOAT)
I love Tee (I fuck with him), I love Tee Grizzley (I love that nigga)
I love Tee, man, I love Tee Grizzley (I love that nigga)

You know that nigga Tee?
Yeah, why you askin'?
I went to state, I was right there when they grabbed him
Bitch-ass nigga, stop cappin'
Know none of you ho-ass niggas, man
Keep my fuckin' name out y'all mouth, nigga
