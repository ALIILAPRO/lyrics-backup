		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oldest dream without a dream 
Cold but sweet and tempting 
As I look into those eyes long gone 
And it feels like you were still a part 
Of this restless world 
From beyond you reach out for my hand 
Come closer follow me 

Are you willing to pay the price 
To see what the future will bring 
Here in the place where the weak become strong 
And the lowest of life become kings 
All are lost in euphoria 
No failure or earthly disease 
Glorious and proud, stands the beggar now crowned 
Who once lived a life on his knees 

Tonight I hear you whisper 
Deep inside within my head 
Tonight I see familiar faces 
Voices of the dead calling me 

Are you aware of the hate and the greed 
That would fall forever from you 
Do you believe that this mortal coil 
Is the only path you can choose 
Memories of life 
Memories of death 
Right here its all the same 
So come on over to the other side 
And let go of this life of pain 

Tonight I hear you whisper 
Deep inside within my head 
Tonight I see familiar faces 
Voices of the dead calling me 

So my friend don't leave me now 
There's nothing I would miss here 
Let me join the cirle now and teach me how to fly 
Love and hate, lust and joy 
I have seen it all here 
So lead me through and light my path 
Embrace me as I die
