		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Your hand on his arm
Haystack charm around your neck
Strung out and thin
Calling some friend tryin' to cash some check
He's acting dumb
That's what you've come to expect

Needle in the hay
Needle in the hay
Needle in the hay
Needle in the hay

He's wearing your clothes
Head down to toes a reaction to you
You say you know what he did
But you idiot kid, you don't have a clue
Sometimes they just get caught in the eye
You're pulling him through

Needle in the hay
Needle in the hay
Needle in the hay
Needle in the hay

Now on the bus
Nearly touching this dirty retreat
Falling out
6th and Powell, a dead sweat in my teeth
Gonna walk, walk, walk
Four more blocks, plus one in my brain
Down downstairs
To the man, he's gonna make it all okay
I can't be myself
I can't be myself and I don't wanna talk
I'm taking the cure
So I can be quiet whenever I want
So leave me alone
You oughta be proud that I'm getting good marks

Needle in the hay
Needle in the hay
Needle in the hay
Needle in the hay
Needle in the hay
Needle in the hay
Needle in the hay
Needle in the hay
