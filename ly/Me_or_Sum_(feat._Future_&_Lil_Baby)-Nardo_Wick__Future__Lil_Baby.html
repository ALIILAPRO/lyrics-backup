		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Drop your location, she think she me or sum' (Hendrix)
Put on my chains, now she think she me or sum'
She keep a Glock in her bag, she think she me or sum' (Pluto)
VVS rocks with the cash, she think she me or sum' (keep it Z3N)

Came out hustlin' with the bag, oh no
I can't get it the guys, oh
Bitch can't see me in binoculars
Runnin' a check up, I'm proud of you
You runnin' the racks up, I'm proud of you
All bad bitches eat seafood
Took the hot box on the detour
Came back, red on the bottom of her shoe
Post up the devil, she thinkin' she me or sum'
Canary yellow, she thinkin' she me or sum'
Step like a stepper, she drippin' Emilio Pucci
She think she me or sum'
She barely ever poppin' outside
But when she do (when she do), tryna kill sum'
My number one hitter, always movin' in silence
She the truth, real one
You can ask her if she gang-gang
She gon' tell you she rep the same thing I do (yeah)
She not my main thing
But on the weekend, she lovin' my crew, lovin' my crew

She said she got a man, I act deaf, I don't hear her (I don't hear her)
Come here, girl, stop playin', let me put in your liver (put it in your liver)
Eat what's in my pants, bae, don't gotta go to dinner
I stole her heart, thou shall not steal, I'm sorry, I'm a sinner
Let her put my chains on, now she think she me or somethin'
Got a special ringtone, when it beep, I know she comin'
She just put her hair on, now she just think she flee or somethin'
Nardo hit that G spot, when she scream, I know she cummin'
I put her in LV, on my feet is LV
I think I'm a lover boy, sing to your bitch like Elvis
My bitch in the front seat, my other bitch in back seat
Nardo, who your other bitch? I'm talkin' 'bout my choppy
Know I keep a bankroll, baby, count my bankroll
Put it in your purse, she say, "It's too much, bae, it won't go
Too much, bae, it won't fold, too much, bae, I'm gon' tote"
I know I got a lot of y'all, but, baby, you my favorite ho
She love me, she love me not
She love me, she love me not
She love me, she love me not
She love me, she love me not

Baby in this bitch
Like, "Let me through here," I need millions for the new year
Send a threat, I send my crew there
Know they hate how big I blew up
Got that check for real, went Audemars Piguet and bought my boo one
Think my favorite car's my blue one, pop that shit for real, I do this
Put my heart inside my safe deposit box 'cause I ain't gon' use it
I made forty million last year, and that's just off my music
I done finally got the mothafuckin' ball, and I ain't gon' lose it
Seem like everybody snoozin' while I'm steadily improvin'
I get money like I'm Jewish, I'm gon' be the one
She got all them bracelets up her arm, look like she me or somethin'
She get new Chanel whenever she want to like it's free or somethin'
I been buyin' Birkin bags for bitches like they three for one
Excuse my French, I'm sorry, mama, this Phantom cost five hunnid
I been lit for five summers, everyone know how I'm comin'
Real exotic bags for thirty-five, we got our side pumpin'
Niggas don't want war with us, I spin until my last hunnid, yeah

Rackies on rackies, now she think she me or sum'
Dressin' like she tecky, now she think she me or sum'
Count up cash really fast, now she think she me or sum'
Keep the extendo in her bag, now she think she me or sum'
Walked in with a baddie, now she think she me or sum'
Gon' drop the addy, now she think she me or sum'
Bust down an Audemars, now she think she me or sum'
Cop another foreign car, now she think she me or sum'
Bitch don't need no stylist, she must think she me or sum'
Always goin' viral, she must think she me or sum'
Turn up on a bad ho, she must think she me or sum'
Diamonds on her rings and her chain, think she me or sum'
Posted up, runnin' with her gang, think she me or sum'
Flawless, Freeband gang, reppin' like she me or sum'

Yeah, Pluto
Wicked
Nardo, you got you one with this one
