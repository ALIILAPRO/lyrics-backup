		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bad news from the zones tumbleweeds
It looks like Jet-Star and the Kobra kid
Had a clap with an exterminator that went all Costa Rica
And uh, got them selves ghosted, dusted out on route Guano
So it's time to hit the red-line and up thrust the volume out there
Keep your boots tight, keep your gun close
And die with your mask on if you've got to
Here is the traffic
