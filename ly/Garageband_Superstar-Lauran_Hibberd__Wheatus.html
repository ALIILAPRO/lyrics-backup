		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I woke up, I hit my head
I'm taller now, you go back to bed
I'm dressed down, my skin is red
I'm sliding out of your house again

And then you text me something
Stupid that I didn't know
You said you heard a song of
Mine come on the radio he must me losing it
I wrote one song on Garageband
No one I sent it to would
Ever give it half a chance

Turn on the TV oh my god, it's me
Yeah, yeah, yeah
My face on every screen and everyone I meet
Loves me

It's just a matter of time
Before I lose my mind i'm a superstar now

I'm sneaking into a party
And I hope that they don't notice me
I'm walking 'round the big streets
The lines are short and the beers are free

And then I pass a couple
Strangers on the Megabus
They told me that they recognize
This pretty face I got
I asked them why and then blush twice
They never answered back
They're probably starstruck by
My wholesome little

Turn on the TV oh my god, it's me
Yeah, yeah, yeah
My face on every screen and everyone I meet
Loves me it's just a matter of time
Before I lose my mind i'm a superstar now

Pull back the shower curtain
I am just a normal person
Dressed to the nines hairbrush microphone
A big stage dive
But no one can catch you when you're alone

Turn on the TV it was never me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
My face on no one's screen and
Everyone I meet hates me

It's just a matter of time
Oh God, I lost my mind
I'm not a superstar now
