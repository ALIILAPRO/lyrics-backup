		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I ain't got nothin'
If I ain't got nothin'
One plus one, plus one, plus one
Plus one, plus one, plus one equals two

Yeah, I'm sayin' somethin', they want it the old way (yeah)
Comin' down the block, the windows is so hazy (yeah)
Never said, "I can't," my nigga, there's no way (no way)
Every time we wild, that's rock n' roll, baby

It's back to the basics, hop back in the matrix
Gave the Maybach back, back, now it's off to the races
Had 'em tappin' my phones, so I blurred out the faces
The new David Ruffin, I just follow Temptation
When you follow The Rager, the money is outrageous
Look at me, legally sellin' dope on all of these stages
Van Cleef & Arpels, V got all of the bracelets
The keys and the codes, and know where all of the safes is
We don't make mistakes here, we don't take no breaks here
My son is like a work of art, his father's like Shakespeare
I've done the impossible, I should wear a cape here
A "C" on my chest, coke dealers come and play here
Careers in it's eighth gear, nothin' left to do but levitate
I'm David Blaine here, I could disappear, I swear
We been gettin' change here, so what's really changed here?
Still next to Ye in here

Yeah, I'm sayin' somethin', they want it the old way (yeah)
Comin' down the block, the windows is so hazy (yeah)
Never said, "I can't," my nigga, there's no way (no way)
Every time we wild, that's rock n' roll, baby
This is my story, and yes, you should pay me
Told her, "I ain't stayin' the night," she might hate me
Life is where it's been, where they not, it's so crazy
Every time we wild, it's rock n' roll, baby

We the only clique takin' risks
Touchin' lives, fuck your hits
Touchin' skies, when you rich, every drop make 'em blitz
I done drove every six, I done glowed every wrist
Every plot got a twist when you sink a battleship
I'm confused by your list, who are you's to convince
All the mules that I sent? What I miss?
I been gettin' at these coins as I'm breakin' down a brick
Made the jump to each level, Super Mario exists
All the spoons that were bent
All the fumes through the vents
I don't care what they do
This ain't that, that ain't this
I'm the trap, I'm the fix
I'm the broker, I'm the joker in the deck
Arthur Fleck when he's pissed, triple six

I accepted you to lie
All the times, selfish, thinkin' you was mine
I showed up, then you arrived
I thought I could turn the tides
How I make it through the Chi
Get to you and almost die?
Finally tired of comin' and goin', make up your mind
I ain't come to pick up the kids to pick a fight
Goin' off all of the time
Showin' off all of the time
Pushin' me over the edge
Don't know if I'm fallin' or flyin'
How many nights I pray, how many times?
No matter what we say, God will decide
God will decide
Call the divine, stars will align
Stars will align
Love my mama, but sometimes, dad was right
Take His hand, hold on with all of your might
When you're lost in the light, call on the light
Follow the signs, walk in the shine

See, I'm losin' time
See, I really wanna live my life, oh
See, I want more, I want more, I want more
See a nigga try, yeah, oh
It never dries, oh
See, I want more, I want more, I want more

If I ain't got nothin'
If I ain't got nothin'
One plus one, plus one, plus one
Plus one, plus one, plus one equals two

If I ain't got nothin'
If I ain't got nothin'
One plus one, plus one, plus one
Plus one, plus one, plus one equals two
