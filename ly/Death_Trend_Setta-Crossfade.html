		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, it's what I've become that I fear the most
I never thought it could get so wrong
I believe there's a part of me that I cannot beat
A part of me that I can't defeat
The side of me that just doesn't belong

Judging by the weight of my fucked up world
I think maybe I should take a step back from this
I need to quit pushing, just let it roll

The waves that you made (push me, push me)
The things that you say (push me, push me)
The waves that you made (push me, push me)
So I'll play God now and blow you, blow you away

Yeah, it's what you've become that I took today
You never thought I could be so strong
You can see there's a part of me that you cannot beat
And part of you will always remember me
When you look around and you are so alone

Judging by the weight of my fucked up world
I think maybe I should take a step back from this
But you had to keep pushin' so I let it go

The waves that you made (push me, push me)
The things that you say (push me, push me)
The waves that you made (push me, push me)
So I'll play God now

Now that you pushed me
I bet you wish we could have made things better
And now you see that I could be
Another would be, another death trend setter
Now you see that you pushed me
I bet you wish we could have made things better
And now you see that I could be
Another would be, another death trend setter

(Push me, push me)
(Blow you, blow you away)
(Push me, push me)
(Blow you, blow you away)

The waves that you made (push me, push me)
The things that you say (push me, push me)
The waves that you made (push me, push me)
So I'll play God now and blow you, blow you away

Now that you pushed me
I bet you wish we could have made things better
And now you see that I could be
Another would be, another death trend setter
Now you see that you pushed me
I bet you wish we could have made things better
And now you see that
I'll play God now
