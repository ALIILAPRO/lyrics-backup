		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it

She loves to laugh
She loves to sing
She does everything
She loves to move
She loves to groove
She loves the lovin' things

Ooh, all night, all night
Oh, every night
So hold tight, hold tight
Ooh baby, hold tight

Oh, she said
Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it
She said, any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it

I was alone
I never knew
What good love could do
Ooh, then we touched
Then we sang
About the lovin' things

Ooh, all night, all night
Oh, every night
So hold tight, hold tight
Ooh baby, hold tight

Oh, she said
Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it
I said, any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it

She said ohh, hold on, hold on, hold on
Oh, she said any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it

Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it

She said any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it

Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it

Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it

Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it

Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it

Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it

Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it

Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
