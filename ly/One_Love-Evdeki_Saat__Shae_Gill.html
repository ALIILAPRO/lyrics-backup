		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bilmem insan bunu nasıl edebilir ifade
Aklım her an bile bile girebilir her hale
Biz ikimizi saklasak
Biraz beklesek
Ya da uzatmasak
Bunu diretmesek
Ve kalp akla taktı bi kelepçe hep
If you wanna be friends I like that
If you don't wanna pretend, I like that more
We could be on the run, forever
You'll be my only one, forever more
My one love, my one love
Swear that I would put no one above ya
If you wanna begin, I like that
My one love, my one love
Sun le
Abhi tau shuru hoye ye rastay
Hongai in kahaniyon ke charchay
O sun le, o sun le
Sun le, saari baatein karle tu khul k
Kabhi dil ki khabar bhi tou le
Kya kahe, yeh kya kahe
Silsilay phir kyun na milay
Jab dil ki sabhi
Sar-e-aam bhi dikhay
If you wanna be friends I like that
If you don't wanna pretend, I like that more
We could be on the run, forever
You'll be my only one, forever more
My one love, my one love
Swear that I would put no one above ya
If you wanna begin, I like that
My one love, my one love
If you wanna be friends I like that
If you don't wanna pretend, I like that more
We could be on the run, forever
You'll be my only one, forever more
My one love, my one love
Swear that I would put no one above ya
If you wanna begin, I like that
My one love, my one love
