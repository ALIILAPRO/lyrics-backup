		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Feel so high, I touch the sky
I get all through the stages
A fallen eye, a sacrifice to get to you, my angel
Your golden hair, the dust as a doll
The sun, the moon and the ocean

Blue skies, no clouds out as far as I can see
And it feels like we are right
(A dream of life)

Every night I count the days I have to wait for you
And everyday I count the nights
And every night I count the days I have to wait for you
Everyday I count the nights

Only one at the top, it can get so lonely
When you're the only one
Had to try once again, I keep on trying
Try 'til this all works

Only one at the top of the cross, lonely
In another world
Had to try once again, and I keep on trying
Try 'til this all works

I got eyes just for you in a different story
But it's just for me
Create as I speak, I can speak your language
Would you want to be?
