		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And I
Want you to know something very important
Before I even start this song
Something very important before I even start this song
I can't feel no more, nooooo
I can't feel no more
I told myself that I wasn't gonna pop no pills nomore
No, I can't feel no more
I can't

I can't feel, no
I can't feel, I can't feel
I can't feel, my body's numb
It because I am so hurt
I feel the pain in the rain
Tell me when is my time and where
Not my first merry-go-round
Not my first merry-go-round yeah
Living life just with a curse, before I go in a hearse
Told you that I love you first
Told you that I love you first, ooh
Now a days I gotta swerve you
I took you out of the fur boots

Back then I saw no one but you
Gave you my racks and I splurged too
Calling my phone and I curved you
Hope this song really don't hurt you
AP froze, time so slow, yeah, hit reverse
Margiela all on my coat, got buttons but leaving it open
So they can all see my shirt, Rick Owens all on my shirt
I can't believe I made it out the dirt
That was back then when my pockets was hurt
Pockets so stuffed that them shits still be hurtin'
Walk with the Goyard, they say its a purse
Louis stuffed on me it look like a curatin
My main girl a doctor, my side girl a nurse
They keep on talkin' (woah)
They keep on talkin' (they hatin)
All these girls up in the club, why you lookin at Vert?
I am not worried because when my niggas come
They gonna need a white curtain
Her boyfriend hate my Bad and Boujee verse
She gave me head so I called her a nerd

I can't feel, no
I can't feel, I can't feel
I can't feel, my body's numb
It because I am so hurt
I feel the pain in the rain
Tell me when is my time and where
Not my first merry-go-round
Not my first merry-go-round yeah
Living life just with a curse
Before I go in a hearse
Told you that I love you first
Told you that I love you first, oo
Now a days I gotta swerve you
I took you out of the fur boots

I'm doing fine now, I'm doing fine now
No I do not need nobody now
No I do not need nobody now
No girl don't make a sound
You don't wanna argue about body count
You don't wanna talk about body count
You don't wanna talk about body count
What is all this fighting all about
It's the bodies that I'm finding out
It's the bodies I don't know about
So many bodies like a murder trial
You used to say that it's word of mouth
But I love you so you're bonding out
But I love you so you're bonding out
Grandma and Mom love you now
I'm so high I ain't coming down
I'm so high I ain't coming down
I'm so high I ain't coming down
Hate me then, but they love me now
Love me then, but they hate me now
It don't matter, got a baby now
I'm so numb

I can't feel, no
I can't feel, I can't feel
I can't feel, my body's numb
It because I am so hurt
I feel the pain in the rain
Tell me when is my time and where
Not my first merry-go-round
Not my first merry-go-round yeah
Living life just with a curse
Before I go in a hearse
Told you that I love you first
Told you that I love you first, oo
Now a days I gotta swerve you
I took you out of the fur boots

I'm doing fine now, I'm doing fine now
No I do not need nobody now
No I do not need nobody now
I'm doing fine now, I'm doing fine now
No I do not need nobody now
No I do not need nobody now
I can't feel
