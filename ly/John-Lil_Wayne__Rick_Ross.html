		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Just saw an alien saucer approaching from the sky
Radio contact has been attempted but cannot be established
Instructions are to prepare for an attack by an unknown enemy

Huh
Yeah
Huh

Uh
.44 bulldog, my motherfucking pet
I point it at you and tell that motherfucker, "Fetch"
I'm fuckin' her good, she got her legs on my neck
I get pussy, mouth and ass, call that bitch triple threat
When I was in jail, she let me call her collect
But if she get greedy, I'ma starve her to death
Top down, it's upset
Been fucking the world and nigga, I ain't come yet
You fuck with me wrong, I knock your head off your neck
The flight too long, I got a bed on the jet
The guns are drawn and I ain't talkin' 'bout a sketch
I pay these niggas with a reality check
Prepare for the worst but still praying for the best
This game is a bitch, I got my hand up her dress
The money don't sleep, so Weezy can't rest
An AK47 is my fucking address, huh

I'm not a star, somebody lied
I got a chopper in the car (huh)
I got a chopper in the car (huh)
I got a chopper in the car
Yeah, load up the choppers like it's December 31st
Roll up and cock it and hit them niggas where it hurts
If I die today, remember me like John Lennon
Buried in Louis, I'm talking all brown linen, huh

Big black nigga and an icy watch
Shoes on the coupe, that got a Nike shop
Count the profits, you could bring 'em in a Nike box
Grindin' in my Jordans, kick them off, they might be hot (huh)
Swish, I'm swimmin' in a yellow bitch (boss)
In the red 911, lookin' devilish (haha)
Red beam make a bitch nigga sit down (huh)
Thought it was bulletproof 'til he got hit the fifth time
Drop Palmolive in a nigga dope
Make it come back even harder than before (yeah)
Baby, I'm the only one that paid your car note (Rozay)
Well connected, got killers off in Chicago (huh)

I'm not a star, somebody lied
I got a chopper in the car (huh)
I got a chopper in the car (huh)
I got a chopper in the car
Yeah, load up the choppers like it's December 31st
Roll up and cock it and hit them niggas where it hurts
If I die today, remember me like John Lennon
Buried in Louis, I'm talking all brown linen, huh

Talk stupid, get your head popped
I got that Esther, bitch, I'm Red Fox
Big B's, Red Sox
I get money to kill time, dead clocks
You're fucking with a nigga who don't give a fuck
Empty the clip, then roll the window up
Pussy niggas sweet, you niggas Cinnabon
I'm in a red bitch, she say she finna cum
Two hundred thou' on a chain, I don't need a piece
That banana clip, let Chiquita speak
Dark shades, Eazy E
Five letters, Y-M-C-M-B
Bitch ass nigga, pussy ass nigga
I see you lookin' with your lookin' ass, nigga
You know the rules, kill 'em all and keep moving
If I die today, it'd be a holiday, huh

I'm not a star, somebody lied
I got a chopper in the car, so don't make it come alive (yeah)
Rip your ass apart, then I pull myself together
Y-M-C-M-B, Double M, we rich forever (huh)
The bigger the bullet, the more that bitch gon' bang
Red on the wall, Basquiat when I paint (yeah)
Red Lamborghini 'til I gave it to my bitch
My first home invasion, papi gave me forty bricks
Son of a bitch, then I made a great escape
Ain't it funny? Mama only son be baking cakes
Pull up in the sleigh, hop out like I'm Santa Claus
Niggas gather around, got gifts for each and all of y'all (haha)
Take it home and let it bubble, that's the double up (yeah)
If you get in trouble, that just mean you fuckin' up (nigga)
It's a cold world, I need a bird to cuddle up (yeah)
I call the plays, motherfucker, huddle up

I'm not a star, somebody lied
I got a chopper in the car
Yeah
