		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You don't have to dance with me,
You don't have to dance at all.
You can just lie there looking good,
Or you can play by yourself.

We should be careful because the canyon screams
As the valley sleeps at night.
Then the fear takes hold,
As the Santa Ana winds blow cold.

'Cause if the city's goin' up in flames
Then we oughta go down, down, down, down
You know down, down, down together.
And if the city's goin' up in flames
Then we oughta go down, down, down, down
You know down, down, down together.

You don't have to sleep with me,
We don't have to touch at all.
We can talk till the sun comes up
And listen to the raindrops fall.

But be careful because the canyon screams
And the highways bleed at night.
Then the freeways fold
And the Santa Ana winds blow cold.

And if the city's goin' up in flames
Then we oughta go down, down, down, down
You know down, down, down together.
And if the city's goin' up in flames
Then we oughta go down, down, down, down
You know down, down, down together.

'Cause if the city's goin' up in flames
Then we oughta go down, down, down, down
You know down, down, down together.
And if the city's goin' up in flames
Then we oughta go down, down, down, down
You know down, down, down together.

'Cause if the city's goin' up in flames
Then we oughta go down, down, down, down
You know down, down, down together.
