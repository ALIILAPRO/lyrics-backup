		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When it rains, it pours, but you didn't even notice
It ain't rainin' anymore, it's hard to breathe when all you know is
The struggle of staying above the rising water line

Well, the sky is finally open, the rain and wind stopped blowin'
But you're stuck out in the same ol' storm again
You hold tight to your umbrella, well, darlin' I'm just tryin' to tell ya
That there's always been a rainbow hangin' over your head

If you could see what I see, you'd be blinded by the colors
Yellow, red, and orange, and green, and at least a million others
So tie up the boat, take off your coat, and take a look around

'Cause the sky is finally open, the rain and wind stopped blown'
But you're stuck out in the same ol' storm again
You hold tight to your umbrella, well, darlin' I'm just tryin' to tell ya
That there's always been a rainbow hangin' over your head

Oh, tie up the boat, take off your coat, and take a look around
Everything is alright now
'Cause the sky has finally opened, the rain and wind stopped blowin'
But you're stuck out in the same ol' storm again
Let go of your umbrella, 'cause darlin', I'm just tryin' to tell ya
That there's always been a rainbow hangin' over your head
Yeah, there's always been a rainbow hangin' over your head

It'll all be alright
