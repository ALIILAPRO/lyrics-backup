		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know that she's waiting
For me to say forever
I know that I sometimes
Just don't know how to tell her

I want to hold and kiss her
Give her my love
Make her believe
'Cause she doesn't know

She doesn't know
You're all I need beside me girl
You're all I need to turn my world
You're all I want inside my heart

You're all I need when we're apart
I know that she's always
There when I need her loving
I know that I've never

Told her how much I love her
I see her face before me
I look in her eyes
Wondering why

She doesn't know
She doesn't know
You're all I need beside me girl
You're all I need to turn my world

You're all I want inside my heart
You're all I need when we're apart
Say, say that you'll be there
Whenever I reach out

To feel your hand in mine
Stay, stay within my heart
Whenever I'm alone
I'll know that you are there

You're all I need beside me girl
You're all I need to turn my world
You're all I want inside my heart
You're all I need when we're apart

You're all I need
All that I need
Is for you to believe
All that I need

Is "you"
