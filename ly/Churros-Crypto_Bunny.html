		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's Crypto baby
 
I like cinnamon I like cinnamon
Chocolate swirls don't got no vitamins
I could go all night long no minute men
Ah ah no minute men
Gimme lychee with a Sprite please ah
Gimme mochi cause the rice sweet ah
With that gummi so yummy
Ooh that pink marshmallow pink bunny
 
Yummy so yummy so ya
Yummy so yummy so ya
 
I want it I got it
I want it I got it
I want it I got it
I want it I got it
I want it I got it
I want it I got it
I want it I got it
I want it I got it
 
Hit that sweet sweet spot
Hit me like oh my god
Then when we go AH
It's like oo la la
 
Pull up to the spot in my bicicleta
Hustlin, I lick em I'ma see ya later
Costco buy em in bulk churros
Boys linin' up around the block two rows
Here's a couple bucks get yourself some new clothes
Mac n cheese serve it in the pot elbows
 
Chitty chitty bang chitty chitty bang bang
If ya look at me I'ma steal your main gang
Pull up to the spot I'ma make your girl sang like
La da dee da dee da dee da dang
 
I want it I got it
I want it I got it
I want it I got it
I want it I got it
I want it I got it

I want it I got it
I want it I got it
I want it I got it
I want it, I got it
I want it I got it
I want it I got it
I want it I got it
I want it I got it
 
I want it I got it

I want it I got it
I want it I got it
I want it I got it
I want it I got it
I want it I got it
I want it I got it
