		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Forgotten things remembered 
The tigers eat their young 
The body stayed but inside the head 
The mind was on the run 
Conspiracy of silence 
The only way out of pain 
Is turn around and run through it man 
Too wet to come in from the rain, 
Tell them... 
I know they were doing it to you 
But don't try doing it to me 
Let me show you, how I love you 
It's our secret, you and me 
Let me show you how I love you 
But keep it in the family tree... 
The secret of the family tree 
When you hear them saying "Trust me" 
Don't wait to see what's next 
Thrown to the wolves 
Forever trusting 
Raised in a form of living Hell 
Sing a one note song of rage 
Live and die within your heart 
So beware in the shadows 
Your family tree waits in the dark 
I say...
