		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Where can we go from here?
Where can we go from here?
A compass can’t help us
We’re tangled in wilderness, dear

Why do you do this to me?
Why do you do this to me?
We’re twirling and biting
A couple of wolves, aren’t we dear?

But we’re losing the spark
We’re losing the heart
That we had
Oh I wish I had the time
To say what’s on my mind
But I can’t

And I wish that I had known you
Before this was a war zone
Before I called the soldiers
Before my love was colder
Oh I wish that I had known you
I wish that I had known you
Years ago

Why’s it so hard to speak?
Why’s it so hard to speak?
We used to call for hours
Stay up laughing on the phone, we wouldn’t sleep

Feels like I’m stuck in between
Feels like I’m stuck in between
No doors will open
The windows are locked, I’m trapped in here
