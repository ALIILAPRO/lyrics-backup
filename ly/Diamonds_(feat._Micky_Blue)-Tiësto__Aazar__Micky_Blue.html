		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take me far away
Looking for a way to such great heights
Watching all the world
Watching all the world through bloodshot eyes

Oh, and it's perfect when it's all a blur
Going 'round and 'round again just like a tie-dye shirt
We're not perfect, yeah, we all get hurt
But we know just what we're made of

Diamonds in the rough, yeah, we shine the place up
Show me what you got, what you think about us
Diamonds in the rough, yeah, we shine the place up
Show me what you got, what you think about us

Dancin' in the rain
Dance away the pain 'til we're on fire
Let the merry-go
Let the merry-go-round take you higher

Oh, and it's perfect when it's all a blur
Going 'round and 'round again just like a tie-dye shirt
We're not perfect, yeah, we all get hurt
But we know just what we're made of

Diamonds in the rough, yeah, we shine the place up
Show me what you got, what you think about us
Diamonds in the rough, yeah, we shine the place up
Show me what you got, what you think about us
