		  Soulja Boy Tell 'Em hopped up out the bed turn my swag on
Took a look in the mirror said what's up
Yeah I'm getting money oh

Hopped up out the bed turn my swag on
Took a look in the mirror said what's up
Yeah I'm getting money oh

Turn my swag on,
It's my time to turn it up yea yea
I put my team on then my theme song
Now it's time to turn it up yea yea

I got a question why they hatin' on me
I got a question why they hatin' on me
I ain't did nothing to 'em
But count this money
And put my team on and now my hold click stuntin' boy what's up, yeah
Boy what's up, yeah
When I was nine years old I put it in my head I'ma die for this gold (Soulja boy tell 'em)

Hopped up out the bed turn my swag on
Took a look in the mirror said what's up
Yeah I'm getting money oh

Hopped up out the bed turn my swag on
Took a look in the mirror said what's up
Yeah I'm getting money oh

I'm back again
I know a lot of y'all thought I wasn't coming back
Yeah yeah
I had to prove 'em wrong
Got back in the studio and came up wit' another hit
Yeah yeah
I told the world my story
The world where I'm from Soulja Boy XL dot com boy whats up yeah yeah

Now every time you see me spit
Every time you hear me rhyme
Every time you see me in yo State are town say what's up
Yeah yeah (Soulja Boy Tell 'Em)

Hopped up out the bed turn my swag on
Took a look in the mirror said what's up
Yeah I'm getting money oh

Hopped up out the bed turn my swag on
Took a look in the mirror said what's up
Yeah I'm getting money oh
