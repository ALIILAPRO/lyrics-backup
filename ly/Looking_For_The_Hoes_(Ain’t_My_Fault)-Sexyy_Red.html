Twirl on the dick (shake that ass, ho, yeah-yeah)
It ain't my fault that I fuck better than yo' bitch (it ain't my fault)
I'm so fuckin' sexy, you can't even fake it (you can't)
Got that nigga nuttin' and I think his ass was Haitian (it ain't my fault)
Shake that ass, bitch, make them hoes mad
Show me how you fuck her baby dad (baow, baow)

You like my voice? It turn you on? (Sexyy)
This ain't nothin', wait 'til you see it in a thong (Sexyy)
He ate my coochie and I cracked him to my song (Sexyy)
Bitches tryna hide they ratchet pussy, ho, we all grown (dick me down)
I like a hood nigga that don't give a fuck
I threw it back on yo' nigga, he beat my coochie up (wow)
I'm his favorite bitch, you a lame ho (baow, baow)
I bounce that ass, make my knees touch them elbows

I'm lookin' for the hoes
Yeah, yeah, shake that ass ho (it ain't my fault) (where they at?)
Shake that ass, ho
Shake that ass, ho (I'm lookin' for the hoes)
Shake that ass, ho (where they at?)
Shake that ass, ho (it ain't my fault)
Shake that ass, ho
Shake that ass, ho (it ain't my fault)
