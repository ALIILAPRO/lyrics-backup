		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been thinking of it all week
Taste of salt and wine
Hands all over my mind and body, and body

Since I left you I've been in a haze
Got me counting hours, counting days
You've been wondering where I'm at
I just want to let you know that

You, you got me
You got me mind and body
You got me
You got me mind and body
You got me
You got me mind and body
Mind and body

I've been praying for it all week
Playing on rewind
The things you do to my mind and body, and body
Since I met you I've been up in space
Got me feeling things I can't explain
You've been wondering where I'm at
I just want to let you know that

You, you got me
You got me mind and body
You got me
You got me mind and body
You got me
You got me mind and body
Mind and body

Throw it on the floor
Beggin' you for more
It'll all in the decor
Hang my panties on the door
What you waiting for
What you waiting for

You, you got me
You got me mind and body
You got me
You got me mind and body
You got me
You got me mind and body
Mind and body
