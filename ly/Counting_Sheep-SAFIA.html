		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I never make a sound
Fingers crossed I shut my mouth 
Thoughts they're creeping through my teeth
Drip, drop, the night is loud
Silence seems to drown me out
Box my thoughts and give me some relief

I wanna let you down
Make you toss and turn around
Won't you give me what I need
I wanna let you down
And I'm always lost and never found
Won't you give me what I need

Tick, tock, make me creep
Never ending counting sheep, never get no sleep
Tick, tock, make me creep
Never ending counting sheep, never get no sleep

Don't drop the curtains down
Darkness is the whole surround
My mind is lurking at my feet (At my feet)
Criss, Cross, the night is sour
Pupils fixed on every hour
Sunrise is the only thing that's sweet

I wanna let you down
Make you toss and turn around
Won't you give me what I need (What I need)
I wanna let you down
And I'm always lost and never found
Won't you give me what I need

Tick, tock, make me creep
Never ending counting sheep, never get no sleep
Tick, tock, make me creep
Never ending counting sheep, never get no sleep

Tick, tock, make me creep
Never ending counting sheep, never get no sleep
Tick, tock, make me creep
Never ending counting sheep, never get no sleep
