		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's one of those unfortunate things (things)
That bad things always happen to me (to me)
And you don't wanna keep the door open (open)
You wanted to see me full of emotion
I ruined all my friendships with you (with you)
And I think I'm runnin' out of people to lose (to lose)
I only have to give you my motion
And you always find your way right back to me

This problem again (this problem again)
Look what I started (look what I started)
I lay in your bed (I lay in your bed)
That's how it started (that's how it started)
A little bit more (a little bit more) of this mystery 
I will make you wish that you had never come to me ('cause)

I'd picture you one day after you improved (look what I started)
And you're walkin' down the aisle (walkin' down the aisle)
It's the thing that makes me smile (that's how it started)
You lay in bed, where you'd rather be instead
No, you're not quite stuck with me (you're not quite stuck with me)
But, one day, you'll be

So, why can't I be romantic with you? (With you)
I'm guessin' it's somethin' about the stuff we went through
Now, you'll never let me leave that behind us (behind us)
Leave it in California (California)
This sticky situation with you (with you)
Made me start bookin' all my tables for two (for two)
I still refer to you as an option (an option)
'Cause you'll always find your way right back to me

This problem again (this problem again)
Look what I started (look what I started)
I lay in your bed (I lay in your bed)
That's how it started (that's how it started)
A little bit more (a little bit more) of this mystery 
I will make you wish that you had never come to me ('cause)

I'd picture you one day after you improved (look what I started)
And you're walkin' down the aisle (walkin' down the aisle)
It's the thing that makes me smile (that's how it started)
You lay in bed, where you'd rather be instead
No, you're not quite stuck with me (you're not quite stuck with me)
But, one day, you'll be

You can say you're sorry, do you ever really mean it?
You and your Ferrari might just make you seem appealin'
Lookin' at your photos, when did your life get so quiet?
Open up yours doors to me and I'll enter inside it (yeah!)
