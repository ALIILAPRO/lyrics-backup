		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  On a palace floor I see my soul
Banging through the doors, we swing 'em closed
We need glass or something strong
For the creeps when you come 'round

I feel like fucking on the west side like bullets out a gun
These strangers are coming out about twice as strong
Yeah, I know you say I miss it but come on baby please
Just know you come off strong, your soul is getting lost

I wish you knew me
I wish you knew
I'm everything I am
I'm everything I am
But you don't know me
I'm everything I am
With everything I am
You don't know me

Hold me down, I know I've lost control
Picking up all of my dirty bones
Oh I know there's something wrong
Freak me out when you come round

I feel like fucking on the west side like bullets out a gun
These strangers are coming out about twice as strong
Yeah, I know you say I miss it but come on baby please
Just know you come off strong, your soul is getting lost

I wish you knew me
I wish you knew
I'm everything I am
I'm everything I am
But you don't know me
I'm everything I am
With everything I am
You don't know me

At all, at all, at all, at all, at all, at all 
(You don't know, you don't know)
At all, at all, at all, at all, at all, at all, at all, at all
