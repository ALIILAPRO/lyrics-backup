		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You and I we're flying to the stars, love told me that you're work of art 
Baby I've, loved you from the start, I know that I should listen to my heart

And it goes like, huh!

You and I, one way ticket to Mars, wake up baby lets light up the 
Cuz I loved you from the start, I know that I should listen to my heart

And it goes like, huh!
And it goes like, huh!

Counting stars and everything beautiful, so are you
Planet earth seems smaller we'r floating thru space, oh

Sing it loud nanananananana nanananana
Sing it loud nanananananana nanananana

One two, one two, one two, one two listen

You and I we're flying to the stars, love told me that you're work of art 
Baby I've, loved you from the start, I know that I should listen to my heart

And it goes like, huh!
