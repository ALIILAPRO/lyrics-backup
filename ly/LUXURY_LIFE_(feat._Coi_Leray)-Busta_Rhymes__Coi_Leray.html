		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
Aye, you gon' hold me down mama?
Best believe in me, daddy, now what you 'bout to do?
Secure another win, just to bring it back and empower you
The other dude I was with
We ain't talkin' about that coward, boo
'Cause you my lil' sis, so don't turn that pussy into sour fruit
Never that, let me rap, fuck the cap 'cause girls is players too, remember that?
Yeah you know just how to act, oh yeah
You learned from the best, that's a fact, if a nigga violate you, I'ma black
Be cautious, was raised by teachers that was flawless
We 'bout to make 'em nauseous, forget about the flaws, you know I'm gorgeous
Talk that shit, yeah, yeah
You love it when I talk my shit
Mhm, you know just who the boss is
We got a lot, peep the way these niggas fuckin' with the bop
Pray on our downfall and we supposed to stop?
Shit is funny, right?
How we get money like
In indescribable ways they can't copy
You niggas know my body

Pop another bottle, pour a couple of shots
'Cause we gon' spend whatever
Luxury life, we livin' over the top
No one can do it better
They try to reject so I ain't ever alone
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
You talk too much, your friends is callin' my phone

Yo, every time that I touch it, you know it's flammable
The game that I be feedin' you, hope you got some collateral
The way I function, you tryna figure out my mechanicals
Fuck flowers, it's time to give me the whole botanical
See, when I pull up and park in the intersection
When you see me, you supposed to see yourself in my reflection
The sunlight reflectin' off the moon
If you don't mention me as one of the greatest
Your train of thought is no exception

Mm, come on Busta, I'm immaculate
The way I'm attackin' these bitches, trackin' it
They askin' how I'm havin' it
Put numbers on the board, Billboard
That's where I'm trappin' at
Big plaques, platinum and gold, up in my habitat
Living my best life, why they mad at that?
Already went number one, yeah, they could have it back
I don't even drive, I just sit and roll up in the back
He wanna get high then slide up in this kitty cat

Pop another bottle, pour a couple of shots
'Cause we gon' spend whatever
Luxury life, we livin' over the top
No one can do it better
They try to reject so I ain't ever alone
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
You talk too much, your friends is callin' my phone
