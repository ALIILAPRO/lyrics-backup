		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Many years ago is when it all began
You found a home in the palm of my hands

The minute I held you to my chest I knew I found
The only one for me, such a beautiful sound

Sing for me, my darling
Won't you sing it for me?
Let my fingertips keep playing your sweet melody
Sing for me, my darling
Don't need no symphony
Let my fingertips keep playing your sweet melody

(Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh)

You help me write a song when I've nothing to say
When I need you most, oh, you're not far away

The minute I held you to my chest I knew I found
The only one for me, such a beautiful sound

Sing for me, my darling
Won't you sing it for me?
Let my fingertips keep playing your sweet melody
Sing for me, my darling
Don't need no symphony
Let my fingertips keep playing your sweet melody

(Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh)

Sing for me, my darling
Don't need no symphony
Let my fingertips keep playing your sweet melody

Sing for me, my darling
Won't you sing it for me? (Sing it for me)
Let my fingertips keep playing your sweet melody
Sing for me, my darling
Don't need no symphony
Let my fingertips keep playing your sweet melody

(Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh)
