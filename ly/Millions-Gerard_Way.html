		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You twist my arm
I'm twisting fate
You'll leave alone, or crazy great
Or break into a million pieces, all your reasons

Lets live alone
And out of state
Lets make up everything and wake up breathing
Don't give a damn about the wreck you leave in

You can use my friends, but that depends

On what they're for
And while we're laying on the floor
My mouth is sore
I'm keeping score
A million reasons but I need a million more

You believe in love
I believe in faith
They'll believe in anything, you make up villains
A trillion legions of the damned and William,
It was really me
It was really you
There was really nothing I could do
Until then,
Let's use our magic powers with the children

You don't understand, we don't hold hands

Come catch me, run
'Cause I'm not having any fun
I think you're sore
I think I'm done
A million reasons

Can I be your number one?

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Can I be your number one?

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Can I be your number one?
We are something, we are of use somehow
