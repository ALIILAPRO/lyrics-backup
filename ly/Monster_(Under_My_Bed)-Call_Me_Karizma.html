		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Monster, monster under my bed
Come out and play 'cause I need a friend
You're so damn close that I feel your breath
You're the only one I have left

Feel you in my bones
Shiver up my spine
You're a master of disguise
You show up when no one's home
Are you real or just a lie
I can feel you in my mind
In my soul
But I love when you jump in
And help me feel something
My blankets are the door
My bed is the coffin
And just as it closes
And I go to lock it
I sing that lullaby you taught me

Monster, monster under my bed
Come out and play 'cause I need a friend
You're so damn close that I feel your breath
You're the only one I have left

Show me where to go
I guess I'm always lost
Now that everyone is gone
You're the one who gives me hope
I was told to be afraid
But around you I feel safe
And you know that
I love when you jump in
You help me feel something
My eyelids are the door
My mind is the coffin
And just as they're closing
You come from the closet
And sing the lullaby you taught me

Monster, monster

Save me, someone I'm crazy
Or maybe something is saying
My days are numbered like babies
I stay in slumber let's face it
I spend my summers in basements
I fucking love when you hate me
I never want you to take me
From my monster, monster
Someone call a doctor, a doctor
I'm fucking off my rocker don't offer to talk when you're not gonna 
Stop copping these Oxys to feed me
I'm probably not gonna eat these
But if the problems within me are just the monster your seeing I'm singing

Monster, monster under my bed
Come out and play 'cause I need a friend
You're so damn close that I feel your breath
You're the only one I have left
Monster, monster under my bed
Come out and play 'cause I need a friend
You're so damn close that I feel your breath
You're the only one I have left
