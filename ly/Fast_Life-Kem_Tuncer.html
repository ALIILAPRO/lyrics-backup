		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's a dangerous game
Still you're playing with your life
Tell me which road do you take tonight?
Would you leave right here or would you never let me go
Would you save my soul tonight?
Would you save my soul tonight?
Inshallah, that is what you feel
Inshallah, our worlds can coexist in peace
Inshallah, we could be living next to my dreams
Inshallah, I hope that you're prepared for that
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I'm on dat fast life
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
you cannot change mine
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I'm on dat fast life
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
you cannot change mine
You cannot change mine, oh
Don't wanna start up with a bunch of lies
You want to hang out with me and spend the night
You're still in love, I see it in your eyes
You tryna cut the ties, still let me roll the dice
You wanna get in my life
And you can't stop calling me in my studio time
You don't wanna go alone to sleep at night
And the love you got for me slowly dies
I hope you feel alright
Inshallah, that is what you feel
Inshallah, our worlds can coexist in peace
Inshallah, we could be living next to my dreams
Inshallah, I hope that you're prepared for that
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I'm on dat fast life
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
you cannot change mine
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I'm on dat fast life
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
you cannot change mine
