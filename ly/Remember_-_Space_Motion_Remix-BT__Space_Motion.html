		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know how you feel.
I'm feeling it to.
I hold my heart, I dream of you.
I see your face, I feel it, too.
Searching skies.
I need you.
I miss you.

Take this and hold
My love for you.
In separate times we think as two.
In paradise I'll drown in you.
Still searching skies.
I need you.
I want you.

I know how you feel.
I'm feeling it to.
I hold my heart, I dream of you.
I see your face, I feel it, too.
Searching skies.
I need you.
I miss you.

Take this and hold
My love for you.
In separate times we think as two.
In paradise I'll drown in you.
Still searching skies.
I need you.
I want you.

I love you, love you, I love only you, love you.

Remember me near.
There may be times when it's not right
For me to be there.
But remember me near.
Remember me near.
There may be times when it's not right
For me to be there.
But remember me near.

Searching for strength.
Can I face this day.
Blinded by your love we stay.
You're always there,
You're in my head
Still chasing skies.
I need you.
Oh, I miss you.

Just love you, only you, only you

I love you, I love you, I love only you, love you.

Remember me near.
There may be times when it's not right
For me to be there.
But remember me near.
Remember me near.
There may be times when it's not right
For me to be there.
But remember me near.

Remember me near.
There may be times when it's not right
For me to be there.
But remember me near.
Remember me near.
There may be times when it's not right
For me to be there.
But remember me near.
