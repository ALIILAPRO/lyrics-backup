		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ah, so what a scene, let's do another toast to confine
Match a city, overflowing laughing voices are
Pretended fabrications of a lie, blinded eye, deception
I'm trying not to go mad

Could a, could an aroma come and feed the brain in tune
With stimulation, reawaken inclinations
Don't know who's gonna go there today, I wonder

If I kept trying then, what can i, that cannot be done
On to the world, what can i, that cannot be done
Looking in those dark little eyes, I decide
I need to not once let your tear fall beneath

Ah get out to find it now, don't ever let go
The brighter future knows to reach it
Even when the world is caught and full of wrong
Keep needing ya to laugh and be free for once
No, I cannot be hurting no one
I wanted, I wanted to be stronger now
Woken to resume my need to stay the real me

So what a scene, here's to another safely passed time
Masking every new bad rumor flowing in the city
Feel the lie, feel the lie, release to turn a blind eye
Choking on their own hysteria

Marching with an innocence, they proceed
To a location echoing the sound of feet skipping and
Feeling high, feeling high, memories of a lasting flavor
The other side's insanity

Ah

Can you call the "standard good" a living at all
And can "nobody feeling sadder" be a living at all
How is a straighter path you could see a living at all
So let's imagine going "no mistake" as living at all

And I don't wanna live as you'd assume, be saying it's right
And artificially be living and you're saying it's right
I don't know what I'll be, and to believe this, I wonder
Want to know the truth, what I'm inside and under
Oh, spill me the tale
Oh, spill me the tale

Still, we reside inside a dry confusing big world
I make a wish alone
Believe it, I just wanna be with you forever
Give me hope to be just smiling with you again

Ah, the skipping beating in my heart
Is shaking me within, and begins to shout
"Now you got to move, go make the way"

I will rise to prove the fragile little "myself"
Go bite into my own and reach it
Even when the world is caught, and full of wrong
Keep needing ya to laugh and be free for once
No, I cannot see nobody cry
I wanted, I wanted to be stronger now
Woken to resume my need to stay the real me

I'm gonna keep ya from danger, there are too many
I'm running, I'm running, I'm running for you
I will overcome what is residing for you
