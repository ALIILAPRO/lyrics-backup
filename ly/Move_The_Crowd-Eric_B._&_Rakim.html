		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Standin' by the speaker 
Suddenly I had this fever 
Was it me or either summer madness
'Cause I just can't stand around
So I get closer and the closer I get, the better it sound
My mind starts to activate, rhymes collaborate
'Cause when I heard the beat, I just had to make
Somethin' from the top of my head
So I fell into the groove of the wax and I said
How could I move the crowd
First of all, ain't no mistakes allowed
Here's the instructions, put it together
It simple ain't it, but quite clever
Some of you been tryin' to write rhymes for years
But weak ideas irritate my ears
Is this the best that you can make?
'Cause if not and you got more, I'll wait
But don't make me wait too long 'cause I'ma move on 
The dancefloor, when they put somethin' smooth on
So turn up the bass, it's better when it's loud
'Cause I like to move the crowd

Move the crowd (hey)
Move the crowd (hey)
Move the crowd (hey)
Move the-, move the-, move the crowd (hey)
Move the crowd (hey)
Move the-, move the-, move the-, move the- 
Move the crowd (hey)
Move the-
Move the crowd (hey)
Move the crowd (hey)

Ra-, Ra-, Rakim (hey)
Ra-, Ra-, Rakim (hey)
Ra-, Ra-, Ra-, Ra-, Ra-, Ra-, Ra-, Rakim (hey)

Imagine me wit' the heat that's made by solar
It gets stronger every time I hold a
Microphone, check the tone to get started
The line for the microphone is departed
So leave it up to me, my DJ is mixin'
Everyone is movin' or eager to listen
Your hands in the air, your mouth, shut
'Cause I'm on the mic and Eric B. is on the cut
For those that know me, indeed I like to flow
Especially when the music's goin' slow
It gives me a chance to let everybody know
It's time to bust out the Rakim show
I'm the intelligent wise, on the mic I will rise
Right in front of your eyes 'cause I am a surprise
So I'ma let my knowledge be born to a perfection
All praise is due to Allah and that's a blessing
Wit' knowledge of self, there's nothin' I can't solve
At three-hundred and sisty degrees, I revolve
This is actual fact, it's not an act, it's been proven
Indeed, and I proceed to make the crowd keep movin'

Move the-, move the-, move the crowd (hey)
Move the-, move the-, move the-, move the- 
Move the-, move the-, move the crowd (hey)
Move the crowd (hey)
Move the crowd (hey)
Move the crowd (hey)
Move-, move-, move-, move-, move-, move-, move-, move the crowd (hey)
Move the-, move the-, move the-, move the- 
Move the-, move the-, move the crowd (hey)
Move-, move-, move-, move-, move-, move-, move-, move the crowd (hey)
Move-, move-, move-, move-, move-, move-, move-, move the crowd (hey)
Move-, move-, move-, move-, move the crowd (hey)
Move the crowd (hey)
