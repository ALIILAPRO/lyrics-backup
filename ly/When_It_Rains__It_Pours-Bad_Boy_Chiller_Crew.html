		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Girl, this you, this ain't my fault
I swear you drive me up the wall
Twenty-four, can't take no more
Feels like when it rains, it pours
Girl, this you, this ain't my fault
I swear you drive me up the wall
Twenty-four, can't take no more
Feels like when it rains, it pours

Yo, I don't wanna play with you
You ain't gonna take me for no fool
Girl, you better change your tune
You makin' us say that shit, it gets gone
Yo, ever since I made my move
You make me question, is this love?
You got me stressin' just my luck
Yo, I get the message, girl, I'm done
Yo, I don't wanna play with you
I'm still the same guy I was from the jump
Girl, you better change your tune
You ain't really bad, ah girl, don't front
Yo, ever since I made my move
You make me question, is this love?
You got me stressin' just my luck
Yo, I get the message, girl, I'm done

She calls me a waste of space
Told her I'ma make a change
Real talk, I'ma stay the same
Not long 'til we fade away
Get this sh-sh off my chest
We ain't ever gonna fix this mess
Can't say didn't give my best
Girl, you send my head west
Many times what I did do
Girl, I know this life's an addiction
My heart cold
It's like an addiction to my soul
Guess I should have listened to my folk
If I ride for you, would you ride for me?
If I tell you lies, will you lie and cheat?
I'ma hold you down, I'ma make you proud

Girl, this you, this ain't my fault
I swear you drive me up the wall
Twenty-four, can't take no more
Feels like when it rains, it pours
Girl, this you, this ain't my fault
I swear you drive me up the wall
Twenty-four, can't take no more
Feels like when it rains, it pours

Yo, I don't wanna play with you
You ain't gonna take me for no fool
Girl, you better change your tune
You makin' us say that shit, it gets gone
Yo, ever since I made my move
You make me question, is this love?
You got me stressin' just my luck
Yo, I get the message, girl, I'm done
Yo, I don't wanna play with you
I'm still the same guy I was from the jump
Girl, you better change your tune
You ain't really bad, ah girl, don't front
Yo, ever since I made my move
You make me question, is this love?
You got me stressin' just my luck
Yo, I get the message, girl, I'm done

What's with the mood swings? Why so abusive?
Why do you do this? My life a movie
I'm in the fast line, clutchin', cruisin'
I give you love, that diamonds, rubies
I be the king, you be my queen
Air Max, Moncler, Dsquared2 jeans
Hit that club, got racks on me
My gang, my team, my family
We made it
Back at the club, we faded
Slumped from the drugs we takin'
Oh God, why the fuck we here?
Yo, look at the funds we makin'
She got me right up on my toes
If she's not ridin', she's my foe
I'd rather die all on my own
I told time and time before

Girl, this you, this ain't my fault
I swear you drive me up the wall
Twenty-four, can't take no more
Feels like when it rains, it pours
Girl, this you, this ain't my fault
I swear you drive me up the wall
Twenty-four, can't take no more
Feels like when it rains, it pours

Yo, I don't wanna play with you
You ain't gonna take me for no fool
Girl, you better change your tune
You makin' us say that shit, it gets gone
Yo, ever since I made my move
You make me question, is this love?
You got me stressin' just my luck
Yo, I get the message, girl, I'm done
Yo, I don't wanna play with you
I'm still the same guy I was from the jump
Girl, you better change your tune
You ain't really bad, ah girl, don't front
Yo, ever since I made my move
You make me question, is this love?
You got me stressin' just my luck
Yo, I get the message, girl, I'm done

Girl, this you, this ain't my fault
I swear you drive me up the wall
Twenty-four, can't take no more
Feels like when it rains, it pours
Girl, this you, this ain't my fault
I swear you drive me up the wall
Twenty-four, can't take no more
Feels like when it rains, it pours
