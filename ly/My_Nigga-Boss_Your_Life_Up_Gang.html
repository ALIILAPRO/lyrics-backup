		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Mustard on the beat, ho)

I said that I'ma ride for my motherfuckin' nigga
Most likely I'ma die with my finger on the trigger
I've been grindin' outside all day with my niggas
And I ain't goin' in 'less I'm with my niggas
My nigga, my nigga (my nigga, my nigga)
My nigga, my nigga (my motherfuckin' niggas)
My nigga, my nigga (my nigga, my nigga)
My nigga, my nigga
Yeah

First thing's first I love all my niggas
This rap shit cracked and I involve my niggas
You lookin' for some lean, lemme call my nigga
He sell it for the high, I need all mines nigga
Some niggas smoke smoke, some niggas drink drank
Got niggas on the block with the glock that don't think
I said, "That's a nigga back up," they in a bucket lapped up
I got to act right if you niggas wanna act up
He talkin' like a snitch, no, that ain't my nigga
He trippin' off a bitch, no, that ain't my nigga
Take a nigga case, yeah that's my nigga
Know him since I was eight, yeah that's my nigga
Fucked my first bitch, passed her to my nigga
Hit my first lick, passed with my nigga (my nigga)
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my niggas
I ride for my niggas, fuck them other niggas 

I said that I'ma ride for my motherfuckin' nigga
Most likely I'ma die with my finger on the trigger (400)
I've been grindin' outside all day with my niggas
And I ain't goin' in 'less I'm with my niggas
My nigga, my nigga (dope boys my niggas)
My nigga, my nigga (YG my nigga)
My nigga, my nigga (Rich Homie my nigga)
My nigga, my nigga (it's the motherfuckin' world)

Just know I'm down with the niggas down for me (let's go)
I got two words for you, love and loyalty (that's right)
It was me and my nigga, trippin' on a half a B
When we used to hit a mall and buy everything we see (damn)
Me and my down ass nigga gettin' twisted
Nigga get to trippin', he knock the gravy out your biscuit (boom, ayy)
Just know I fucked with you the long way, my nigga
So when I see you out I'm like, "Hey, my nigga!"
Drink that act right by the case, my niggas
Drink that act right and get straight with my niggas (my niggas)
Me and my nigga ridin' dirty tryna chase them figures
Who got the yopper, who got the yola? Don't matter, go figure (what's up)

I said that I'ma ride for my motherfuckin' nigga
Most likely I'ma die with my finger on the trigger (yeah)
I've been grindin' outside all day with my niggas
And I ain't goin' in 'less I'm with my niggas
My nigga, my nigga (it's the motherfukin' world)
My nigga, my nigga (YG my nigga)
My nigga, my nigga (Rich Homie my nigga)
My nigga, my nigga (my nigga, my niggas)

My nigga's got cake, money got weight
My nigga fronted me, he the reason I'm straight
My nigga got a house, my nigga got a lake
My nigga we eatin', my nigga get a plate
And we're still hittin' licks, my nigga, my nigga
Runnin' off a nigga shit, my nigga, my nigga
I fucked a nigga bitch with my nigga, my nigga
If a nigga talkin' shit then he ain't my nigga
My nigga, my nigga (my nigga, my nigga)
YG my nigga (YG), and I ain't goin' in, ain't trynna leave my niggas (nah)
Shawty seein' me and want to leave with a nigga (let's go)
But it wasn't enough room 'cause I came with my niggas
My niggas, my niggas
I need a set of wings 'cause I'm too fly, nigga
And I'm all about my business like a suit and tie nigga

I ride for my niggas (believe that)
I said that I'ma ride for my motherfuckin' nigga
Most likely I'ma die with my finger on the trigger
I've been grindin' outside all day with my niggas
And I ain't goin' in 'less I'm with my niggas
My nigga, my nigga
My nigga, my nigga (my motherfuckin' niggas)
My nigga, my nigga (my nigga, my nigga)
My nigga, my nigga
Yeah

My nigga, my nigga
My nigga, my nigga
My nigga, my nigga
Yeah
