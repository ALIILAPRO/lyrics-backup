		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I had a feeling from the start (from the start)
That you would go and break my heart
Now we’re a thousand miles apart
Trying to make a brand new start

Going fast moving slow
Trying to let you go
Getting up, breaking down
Feeling stuck but in flow

Felt like my soul was turning dark (turning dark)
You poured your venom on my spark
Now I’m rebuilding part by part
Trying to mend my broken heart

Going fast moving slow
Trying to let you go
Getting up, breaking down
Feeling stuck but in flow
