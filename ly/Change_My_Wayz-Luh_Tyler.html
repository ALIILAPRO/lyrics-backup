		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I told her I'ma hit this bop, told 'em hundreds hello
They like how I play it smooth? Say I'm a clever fellow
I got my nigga living lavage he came from the ghetto
I told my bro to stay up tall like he got on stilettos, stacking up like Legos
I got money now so bitches acting like they preggo'
Gettin' racks like Melo
Know I got to stay on 10 I got to keep my head up
She mad 'cause I done fucked her friend, she like you know you dead wrong

Damn, I gotta change my ways
Now it's sixty on my neck, remember my chains was fake (ice, ice)
'Member back when times were hard, we prayed for better days
But now I'm gettin' paid
Now I'm bringin' home them racks, I'm fillin' up the safe
Now I make like thirty bands, that's just to rock the stage
I cut her off, now she on Instagram, she posting pictures listening to Rod Wave
Man, ain't that a shame?
She done showed me all her love, but I still did her wrong (Mm-mm-mm)
Even though I always try my best to do her right
I always end up fuckin' up, girl, we ain't lastin' long
I swear my brodie always keep it tucked, yeah, he gon' blast the chrome
My niggas love it when I tell the plug to go and ship them Ps
My bitches love it when I take 'em home and fuck 'em to my songs
(On God, it's no cap, no hat, real shit)
Ayy, yeah, that's just how it be
Niggas tryna ride my wave, I'm tryna ride the beat
Bad bitch put on my scuba suit, I'm finna dive in deep
Say you got paper, I'll believe in when my eyes can see it
For that money I be feenin' man I swear I need it
They ain't think that I could do it, but I beat the odds
Biggest Skee, bitch, I'm the MVP I think I'm undefeated
(Yeah, ayy, shoo, shoo, skee)

Yeah, nigga, the Biggest Skee, nigga
Nah, not the lil' one
Skee
