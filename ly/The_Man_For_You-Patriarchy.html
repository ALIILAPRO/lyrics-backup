		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Suffocate...
just a bit Longer.
With you, I can barely Breathe.
I know it's only Fucking.
I know it's only Love.
I know it's only Fucking,
And I...
I've never been really Bad.
I've only been really Good.
I'm gonna be the Man for You tonight.
Stay alive...
As long as I'm with you.
Slaves on Slaves...
We're Dying every day.
I know it's only Fucking.
I know it's only Love.
I know you're only joking,
But I...
I'm Fatally Drawn
To the Human Race.
I'm Obsessed with your Pre-Cum Face
Lately.
I know we're only Fucking.
I know it's only Love.
I know we're only Fucking,
And I...
I've never been really Bad.
I've only been really Good.
I'm gonna be the Man for You tonight.
I know it's only Fucking.
I know it's only Love.
I know it's only Fucking,
And I...
