		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Temptations, they make it hard for me to change
We go out but there's nothing to celebrate
You could tell you wanna blame your innocence
It's why I lie awake, why I lie awake

I took a trip down memory lane
I saw you there, I'm calling your name
Temptations, they make it hard for me to change
It's why I lie awake, it's why I lie awake

Searching for the words I never said
'Cause I got feelings I hold in
If what you sayings true, then why you next to me
Tell me why I got a feelin' that you testin' me
Still feel you all in my bedroom
How in the hell do we get to
Wishing that I never met you
It's been a while since I felt you
Only seen you when my eyes are closed
We just a couple of lost souls
You take me places that I never go
We should've kept it where nobody knows

Temptations they make it hard for me to change
We go out but there's nothing to celebrate
You could tell you wanna blame your innocence
It's why I lie awake, why I lie awake

I took a trip down memory lane
I saw you there, I'm calling your name
Temptations, they make it hard for me to change
It's why I lie awake, it's why I lie awake

I took a trip down mem-mem-mem-mem
I saw you there, I'm call-call-call-call
I saw you there, I'm calling your name
I saw you there, I'm calling
Call-call-call-call
