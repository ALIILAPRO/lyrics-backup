		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I ain't Aaron Rodgers 'cause I'm still on that pack, nigga
Still got twelve on my motherfuckin' back, nigga
Came home from jail, they was tryna send me back, nigga
I just called my nigga Donald Trump and that was that, nigga

Fuckin' all night long when I wake up, I could barely walk
Money callin' me, I say, "Hello?", That shit said, "Can we talk?"
Don't care who these rappers are, that shit sound sound like salad bars
Countin' so much money, I'ma need a hand massage
I took a sip like that shit Frappuccino
I wore a tuxedo to cook up a kilo
I'm in the kitchen lookin' like Al Pacino
Whippin' Aquafina 'til it's Pellegrino
Shout out the CO that gave me some pussy in jail
On the d-low, she one, double zero
Shout out to freak hoes that I get the lead role
But this is a b-roll lowkey had me emo (fuck)

I ain't a killer but you pushin' me
I smoke your lil' ass like some kushery
I burn your lil' ass like a DVD
I caught my lil' ho with a EBT
I think this ho thinking 'bout havin' ten of me
Ten of me, ten of me, ten of me
She want some company, she want some misery
She want some Tiffany's, bitch, you a Headphanie
I know the bad times won't ever replace the good (the good)
I got some new money comin' in, gotta make room (check)

Instead of me holdin' the trophy, I'd rather my brothers
I got a homie who stay in the field, on the mountain, had a hell of a splittable
Now he inside and he totin' a cutter
They put a lil' thing on the side that go clickin' and make it go, "Brr"
Smoother than butter and I'm always tellin' myself
Just 'cause he showin' me love, it do not mean they love us
I'm takin' my time and can nobody rush us
Said she got a man with a whole lot of rules, and she breakin' em all
So I'm doin' it justice, don't leave me alone, I never did trust us
Too many eyes on the team like I'm sendin' a text with no auto-correct, huh, huh
Said she a virgin until she get fucked like a slut on the jet
I only come to collect
I'ma go through all the threat without makin' a threat
Shit is a movie, it's lookin' like Tubi and I'm seein too many flaws in your set
Still on road and I came off tourin'
And I ain't shit but I'm still important
I don't judge and I do no courtin'
It ain't nothin' left when I take my portion
We gon' die enormous, playin' no games and I still be scorin'
Ain't shit pretty, my bitch is gorgeous
Now that man in the mirror ain't normal

I ain't a killer but you pushin' me
I smoke your lil ass like some kushery
I burn your lil ass like a DVD
I caught my lil' ho with a EBT
I think this ho thinking 'bout havin' ten of me
Ten of me, ten of me, ten of me
She want some company, she want some misery
She want some Tiffany's, bitch, you a Headphanie
I know the bad times won't ever replace the good (the good)
I got some new money comin' in, gotta make room (yeah)

I ain't Aaron Rodgers 'cause I'm still on that pack, nigga
Still got twelve on my motherfuckin' back, nigga
Came home from jail, they was tryna send me back, nigga
I just called my nigga Donald Trump and that was that, nigga
