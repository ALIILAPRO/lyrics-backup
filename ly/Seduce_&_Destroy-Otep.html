		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Open wide)

And when the medicine ran out
And when we didn't speak for days
I could hide inside your smile
Fade 
And curl up around the fang 
Drained 
Wasted away 

I'll be your toy
To seduce & destroy 
I'll be your toy
To seduce & destroy 

(Open wide)

I'll kill
What's killing me! 
I'll do what I have to
To kill
What's killing me! 

No one is clean 

Chemical bondage
Pale as parchment
I'll kill
What's killing me! 

Abuse me
You can use me
Better living through chemistry! 

And when you fall asleep
And when you drop the key
I'll slide it inside your mouth
And say, 
"Do you wanna play?"
Bang 
Blow you away 

You'll by my toy
To seduce & destroy 
You'll be my toy
To seduce & destroy 

(Open wide)

I'll kill
What's killing me! 

I'll do what I have to
To kill
What's killing me! 

No one is clean 

Chemical bondage
Pale as parchment
I'll kill
What's killing me! 

Abuse me
You can use me
Better living through chemistry! 

On your knees
Coughing up
Prayers made of
Money & Dust 

Serrated blades of
Your bated breath
Have made a monster
In the house of death 

Punctured, deflated
The snakes in your veins
Evacuated & slithered away
Are you sure you still want to play
This evil little game?

I'll kill
What's killing me! 
I'll kill
What's killing me! 

A devil made of crystal
Glistens like the sun
Fingers to the head
Pointed like a gun 

A devil made of crystal
Glistens like the sun
Fingers to the head
Pointed like a gun 

A devil made of crystal
Glistens like the sun
Fingers to the head
Pointed like a gun 

A devil made of crystal 
A devil made of crystal 

A devil made of crystal
Glistens like the sun
Fingers to the head
Pointed like a gun 
Pointed like a gun 
Pointed like a gun 
Pointed like a gun 

Are you sure you still want to play
This evil little game?
