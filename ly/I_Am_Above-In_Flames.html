		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Cut my throat and throw me to the wolves
I'm just too tired, too tired to reload
Don't need your tears
I don't need your love
Don't need your sympathy
I am above
I'll be the ghost that haunts you in your sleep
You have anchored the hate in me
Don't need your tears
I don't need your love
Don't need your sympathy
I am above

My God
I don't need you
I won't wait for you to come around
My God
As the pain inflicts
I know I bleed, I bleed for you

We'll never be, (you) are a ghost to me
This is the feeling that I have been waiting for

Maybe, just maybe it takes time to sink in
Did you not hear me loud and clear?
Don't need your tears, I don't need your love
Don't need your sympathy, I am above

My God
I don't need you
I won't wait for you to come around
My God
As the pain inflicts
I know I bleed, I bleed for you

We will never be, you are a ghost to me
This is the feeling that I have been waiting for
We will never be, you are a ghost to me
This is the feeling that I have been waiting for

My God (my God) 
I don't need you
I won't wait for you to come around
My God (my God)
As the pain inflicts
I know I bleed, I bleed for you

We will never be, you are a ghost to me
This is the feeling that I have been waiting for
We will never be, you are a ghost to me
This is the feeling that I have been waiting for

This is the feeling that I have been waiting for
Don't need your tears, I don't need your love
This is the feeling that I have been waiting for
Don't need your sympathy, I am above
