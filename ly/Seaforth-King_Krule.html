		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She's sleeping, she's sleeping
Sleeping, sleeping

She speaks in my dreaming
I take her waist within my hands
And when I wake she melts away into the sand
What meanin', of this feelin'?
Why'd you return into the world of distant past?
We separate across the blades of growing grass
(Across the blades of growing grass)

I see you, the same eyes
Reflect the world that falls apart
There's a fire in my heart
'Cause this faith is all I have
(Baby, this faith is all I have)

Despite the, the brick walls, the ceilin'
Up here, I'm freer than the birds
We soar above the broken Earth
The train line in Seaforth
We sit and watch the planet dyin' up above
We sit and smile without concern
Now walk through shop centres together
Our love dissolves this universe
(Our love dissolves the universe)

I see you, my same eyes
Reflect the world that falls apart
There's a fire in our hearts
Baby, this faith is all I have

(Baby, this faith is all I have)
Baby, this faith is all I have
(this faith is all I have)
Baby, this faith is all I have (this faith is all I have)
Baby, this faith is all I have (baby, this faith is all I have)
We share the dark days between us (we share the dark days between us)
They put a heavy space between us (they put a heavy space between us)
They put a heavy space between us (they put a heavy space between us)
