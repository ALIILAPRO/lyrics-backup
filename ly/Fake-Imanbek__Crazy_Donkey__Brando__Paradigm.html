		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And all your friends fake

Watching you drop a stack
On another Coke and Jack, oh
You're comatose, you're comatose
Louis bag painted black
Bought your friends a booth in back, oh
You're comatose, you're comatose

Everybody's waiting for something, for something
They all want what you have
But they say nothing, they say nothing

You look so bad with your Louis V and plaid
They hate your ass 'cause you just got paid
Rich dad, heart tatts, does it ever get you sad
That your life's a wreck and all your friends fake?

Na na na, na na na, na na na
And all your friends fake
Na na na, na na na, na na na
And all your friends fake

Poppin' pills, knock 'em back
Watch the floor turn into black, oh
You're overdosed, you're overdosed
Looking for misery
Take your boat out to the sea, oh
Just let it row, just let it row

Everybody's waiting for something, for something 
They all want what you have
But they say nothing, they say nothing

You look so bad with your Louis V and plaid
They hate your ass 'cause you just got paid
Rich dad, heart tatts, does it ever get you sad
That your life's a wreck and all your friends fake?

Na na na, na na na, na na na
And all your friends fake
Na na na, na na na, na na na
And all your friends fake

Na na na na, na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na
Na na na na, na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na
And all your friends fake
