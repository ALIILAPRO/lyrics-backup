		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I ain't too sure what I believe in
But I believe in what I see
And when I close my eyes
I see my whole life ahead of me

These are our hours (These are our hours)
This is our time (This is our time)
This is our time
These are our hours (These are our hours)
Out on the verge (Out on the verge)
Out on the verge of the rest of our lives (The rest of our lives)

Out on the verge of the rest of our lives tonight
Top of the world and we're dressed to the nines tonight
Edge of the earth and we're touching the sky tonight
Out on the verge of the rest of our lives

These are our hours (These are our hours)
This is our time (This is our time)
These are our hours (These are our hours)
Out on the verge
Out on the verge
Out on the verge of the rest of our lives

Out on the verge of the rest of our lives tonight
Top of the world and we're dressed to the nines tonight
Edge of the earth and we're touching the sky tonight
Out on the verge of the rest of our lives

(For the rest of our lives)

From now on
There's no looking back
Full steam ahead
On this one way track
From this day forward
I will make promise
To be true to myself
And always be honest
For the rest of my life
I will do what's right
I will do what's right
When I step out on the

Out on the verge of the rest of our lives tonight
Top of the world and we're dressed to the nines tonight
Edge of the earth and we're touching the sky tonight
Out on the verge of the rest of our lives (The rest of our lives)

The rest of our lives
Edge of the earth and we're touching the sky tonight
Out on the verge of the rest of our lives
