		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fuck out my way when you see me
I'm rollin' with the LGBT
Fuck out my way when you see me
I'm rollin' with the LGBT
I'm rollin' with the LGBT
I'm rollin' with the LGBT
Lookin' like we belong on TV
I'm rollin' with the LGBT

Too cool for this shit, look at my body language
Shit on everything, I need some potty training
Money missing, had to ask him, "Where the rest, dummy?"
(Where it's at?) Before I call my bitches up, they say "yes, hunty"
(You know it)
Judge one of the studs, they gone bring some thugs (ya)
Judge one of my drags, catch a heel up yo' ass (uh-oh)
Don't judge a lesbian, 'cause she don't want you back, man (woo)
Judge one of the gays, they drag you from Z to A (they will)
And shout out to the bi's, you ain't gotta pick a side (nope)
And if you in the closet, shorty, you ain't gotta hide (come out)
Gotta make these bitches sick when they see you (What?)
And if a bitch want beef, give her beef stew (yup, yup)
Stripper right in front of me, I hope she washed her ass (you know it)
She looking at my fine gays, but they don't wanna smash (nope)
Know they 'bout to act a fool, time is past due
Then the gays hop on stage, like, "I can shake my ass too."

Fuck out my way when you see me
I'm rollin' with the LGBT
Fuck out my way when you see me
I'm rollin' with the LGBT
I'm rollin' with the LGBT
I'm rollin' with the LGBT
Lookin' like we belong on TV
I'm rollin' with the LGBT

Fashion wise, they don't play (no, boy)
When they step out, they gone slay
I'm talkin' tight jeans, good hygienes
Mothafuckas stay fleek everyday, yeah (We fleek!)
Fuck with them, you better run off
No skydivers, gone jump off
No pun intended, hoes offended
'Cause they see we flyer than flight attendants
Do a hair flip, then I dip (then I dip)
In the strip club throwing tips
In V.I.P., I'm 'bout to buy more
'Cause life too short, like hype sports
Tissue in my bra, bitch, gone head (gone head)
Bad bitch, and I got long legs (long legs)
Ass super plump, full of cornbread
I shut a bitch up like a phone dead

Fuck out my way when you see me
I'm rollin' with the LGBT
Fuck out my way when you see me
I'm rollin' with the LGBT
I'm rollin' with the LGBT
I'm rollin' with the LGBT
Lookin' like we belong on TV
I'm rollin' with the LGBT
I'm rollin' with the LGBT
I'm rollin' with the LGBT
