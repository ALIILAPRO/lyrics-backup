		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You've given me the world with all your love
So, I got you something special just because
I found a gift that's perfect
And you're more than worth it
It's everything that you've been dreaming of
Oh, this is my love language
So, I'll go ahead and say it
'Cause you're the gift that keeps on giving

You deserve it all (all)
You deserve it all (all)
You know you've been good all year
Come over here
And let me show you
You deserve it all (all)
You deserve it all (all)
I'll shower you with more than you'll ever need
It's all good with me
'Cause you deserve it all

You give of yourself so unselfishly
So, I, I wanna give you all the finest things
I found a gift that's perfect
And you're more than worth it
It's everything that you've been dreaming of
So, treat yourself to something nice
The luxury, the life
'Cause you're the gift that keeps on giving

You deserve it all (all)
You deserve it all (all)
You know you've been good all year
Come over here
And let me show you
You deserve it all (all)
You deserve it all (all)
I'll shower you with more than you'll ever need
It's all good with me
'Cause you deserve it all

For all you mean to me
Underneath the tree
For you to see beyond your wildest dreams
And I know that I should do this all year long

'Cause you deserve it all (all)
You deserve it all (all)
You know you've been good all year
Come over here
And let me show you
You deserve it all (all)
You deserve it all (all)
I'll shower you with more than you'll ever need
It's all good with me
'Cause you deserve it all
