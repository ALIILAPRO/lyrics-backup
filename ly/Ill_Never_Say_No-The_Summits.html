		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  He treat me like an angel
As far as I can see
Even when I was a stranger
You were so good to me
(You were so good to me)
And that is why I'm saying
I'll never say no
I'll never say no
After what you've done for me
Even through my jealousy

You wanted to be lovers
I wanted just for friends
But after all the love you gave baby
I'll love you 'til the very end girl
(I'll love you to the end)
And that is why I'm saying
I'll never say no
I'll never say no
After what you've done for me
Even through my jealousy
See you, jealousy

I'll never say no
I'll never say no
I'll always be with you baby
I'll never say no
Anything you want from me baby
You got it when you want it girl
