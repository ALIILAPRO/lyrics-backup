		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You can't believe. 
How did I succeed. 
I went were no ones gone before. 
I opened up your heart and 
Tiptoed through the door to forevermore. 
What did I do? 
I tooked my time with you. 
The other girls they moved too fast. 
I knew the way to make it last was take it slow. 
I let it go. 
Kiss by kiss and baby touch by touch. 
That you wanted me so much darling kiss by kiss is how I got you 2 fall in love with me like this. 
Well here's the key. 
I made you come to me. 
I didn't run I didn't chase. 
I played it cool I gave you space before I knew I was holding u. 
Made every kiss. 
Just so hard to resist. 
I always left. 
You wanted more. 
Care for much. 
You'll give it all. I played it smart. 
I won your heart 
Kiss by kiss and baby touch by touch. 
That you wanted me so much. 
Darling kiss by kiss is how I got you 2 fall in love with me like this. 
Night by night and baby day by day you would feel the special way. 
Darling kiss by kiss is how I got you 2 fall in love with me like this. 
Wanted you form the start. 
You knew it was so hard to keep it locked inside me.
Afraid its getting slow instead I let it show 
Kiss by kiss and baby touch by touch. 
Kiss by kiss and baby touch by touch. 
That you wanted me so much. 
Darling kiss by kiss is how I got you to fall in love with me like this. 
Night by night & baby day by day you wud fil the special way. 
Darling kiss by kiss is how I got you to fall in love with me like this. 
Kiss by kiss
