		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I been livin for the weekend
But no not anymore
'Cause here comes that familiar feelin'
That Friday's famous for
Yeah I'm lookin' for some action
And it's out there somewhere
You can feel the electricity
All in the evening air
And it may just be more of the same
But sometimes you wanna go where everyone knows your name
So I guess I'll have to wait and see
But I'm just gonna let something brand new happen to me

And it's alright
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
Bright lights and the big city
It belongs to us tonight

Now Friday's cool
But there's somethin' about Saturday night
You can't say what you won't do
'Cause you know that you just might
I'm alive this evening
It was love at first sight
This Saturday
And every Saturday for the rest of my life
And everyone's standin' in line
Yeah lookin' good and lookin' for a real good time
So I'll never have to wonder if
I'll have someone to share all of this with

And it's alright
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
Bright lights and the big city
It belongs to us tonight

Yes I need it
Everybody does
Cocktails and conversation
Music and making love

And it's alright
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
Bright lights and the big city
It belongs to us tonight
Bright lights, bright lights, bright lights
And the big city
It belongs to us tonight
