		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't give up now
I been chasing this my whole life
And if the world's gonna bring me down
Then I'mma get back up and fight
I can't give up now
I got people that need me to provide
And if the worlds gonna bring me down
Then I'mma get back up and fight
Yeah, look
They just wanna keep you down
They don't wanna see you crowned
Keep winning
Never see you frown
Keep swimming
Never see you drown
Be loud
Be proud
Family gotta keep them round
Don't go down easy when they beat you down
Better Keep your ground
Roll with the punches
Keep moving no interruptions
Keep going till the day that I make my name so great need no introduction
Even if they go low then I'm going above em
If I can't walk them I'm going on crutches
And if they hate what I make and they spit in my face okay I'll show em what tough is
I'm not perfect
Perfect
That's why every day I'm learning
Learning
Gotta try and find my purpose
Purpose
Cause I know that I am worth it
Worth it
Got me singing like
I can't give up now
I been chasing this my whole life
And if the world's gonna bring me down
Then I'mma get back up and fight
I can't give up now
I got people that need me to provide
And if the worlds gonna bring me down
Then I'mma get back up and fight
Have u ever been hurt so much in your life?
That u don't even feel like you no more it's a battle to stay alive
My mum telling me it's alright, she told me "son your futures bright"
Everyone told me imma failure, but I knew i'd put up a fight
Look at me now i'm making moves
Wait "i need a bottle of water"quick
Before i step in the room
I don't even have no time for games
All of the labels call my zoom
All of the mandem know it's true
I used to live in the council flats
I wanted to make it out of the hood
So i chased my dreams and i made it back
They used to hate on my ting
Look at me now they see i'm shining
I used to pray for days like these
I'm thankful it came at a perfect timing
Too many times i wanted quit
But i got back up and i kept on grinding
If the best version of myself
I know nothing gonna stop me flying
I can't give up now
I been chasing this my whole life
And if the world's gonna bring me down
Then I'mma get back up and fight
I can't give up now
I got people that need me to provide
And if the worlds gonna bring me down
Then I'mma get back up and fight
