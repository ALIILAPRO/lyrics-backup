		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Address unknown, not even a trace of you
Oh what I'd give to see the face of you
I was a fool to stay away from you so long
I should have known there'd come a day when you'd be gone

Address unknown, oh how could I be so blind?
To think that you would never be hard to find?
From the place of your birth to the ends of the earth
I've searched only to find, only to find, address unknown

Address unknown, honey child, I ain't even got a trace of ya
You know one thing?
I'd give anything in the world just to see the face of ya
I was a fool to stay away from you and everything else so long
I should have been diplomatic and figured that some day
You'd be solid gone

Address unknown, oh how could I be so blind?
Who'd think that you would never be hard to find?
From the place of your birth to the ends of the earth
I've searched only to find, only to find, address unknown
