		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't hesitate if you're slidin'
Please don't hesitate if you're slidin'
If you catch me slippin', and you got me
You better head shot me, like it's the only option
Even pussy niggas got choppers, stop it
Die with my motherfuckin' pride like my papa
Four-five on both sides, I was raised in the 90s
Money on the table, at least a hunnid thousand
Sixteen hours, countin' all day and days
Man this shit can get monotonous
I promise I'm fuckin' gorgeous, chrome heartless
Loyal to the soil unless you cross me
Bitch, she say that I'm toxic, but I don't know
Maybe she right cause when I search it I made a mil'
Ever see a badmon in vintage Chanel?
Ever seen a dead man in designer?

Don't hesitate if you're slidin'
Please don't hesitate if you're slidin'
She an expert in late night drivin'
Always on timin', always on diamonds (whoa)
Baby caught another body (whoa)
Got another dead man in designer (whoa)
Baby caught another body (whoa)
Got another dead man in designer (whoa)
(Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)

Yeah-yeah (whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)
Yeah-yeah (whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)
Yeah-yeah (whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)
Yeah-yeah (whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)

Out in California thuggin', fuckin' bitches on my Pac shit
On the west side slidin' with the hottest thing that I done seen, like honestly
Let me introduce you to the finer things
Got you laid out in the mornin', Prada, the whole thing
Skims, got the Chanel bag, Bottega matchin' and we stay high
Stay fly, fuck what they jackin'
And if you slide up on the biscuit, I might turn this to a red rum
She my Bonnie, hide the body, talkin' 'bout a real one

Girl, I know you bluffin' how that Fenty crop top show your bellybutton
She gon' slide, I don't care, we can change the subject
If you thought a nigga beefin', it was really nothin'
But my favorite thing to do is to play the scene
And because the money blue, double take the green
And so how it feel a nigga who give everything
I would truly put this moment over everything
Designer broaches
Never let a shawty play with my emotion
I'm one for high doses, you move into the ocean
First time I hit, I heard her yellin' out "hh shit"
Had to catch it out, then I went and got some more shit
I posted and this money put this shit in motion
Had me ghostin', I had to keep your open
I wanna say it's true, but I don't feel
Off the 1942 and I'm so lit

Don't hesitate if you're slidin'
Please don't hesitate if you're slidin'
She an expert in late night drivin'
Always on timin', always on diamonds (whoa)
Baby caught another body (whoa)
Got another dead man in designer (whoa)
Baby caught another body (whoa)
Got another dead man in designer (whoa)
