		  Check this
Two cups nigga got the red in me
The Ku Klux Klan and the streets with me
Some real designers love to sleep with me
Some real designers love to sleep with me
The molly crumbs got me like a zombie
Her waist line small and that booty look dummy
She just did some alcohol and she about to go dummy
You can check my catalog I'mma keep some money coming
I done kept the water all night, fuck it keep it running
Gotta call a no fly treaty, 'cause of my necklace

Get a lotta money put your main bitch on the sideline
Main bitch on the sideline
Get a lotta money put your main bitch on the sideline
I just get them bands, get them Xans, do a shoutout
I just get them bands and I like to give them a shoutout
I just get them Xans and the light becomes a shadow
I just fucked a fan and she asked me for a shoutout
Nigga talking crazy tryna get the club shot up
I just had some coke inside the freezer tryna come up
Everything seems different when you spark a blunt up
Do it gang territory, dare you try to run up
Dare you try to run up, I dare you try to run up
I dare you try to run up

I just bring my bands up on a weekday
Gotta keep the hammer on the seat baby
I gotta switch my gun up every week baby
'Til I see a billion dollars ain't complete baby
See a trillion dollars ain't complete baby
(See a trillion dollars ain't complete baby)
Dare you try to run up, boy I dare you try to run up
I, I dare you try to run up

Christian L's on me this is not a fairy tale
A couple bales on me I just got it out the mail
Dom Perignon let the champagne spill
We just get the funds then hit you with the steel
Upper echelon we will never miss a meal
You gotta use Waze just to get through the crib
Shawty fell in love with the codeine and pills
Shawty whip around and say it hit a half a mill

Main bitch on the sideline
Get a lotta money put your main bitch on the sideline
I just get them bands, get them Xans, do a shoutout
I just get them bands, get them Xans, do a shoutout
I just get them Xans and the light becomes a shadow
I just fucked a fan and she asked me for a shoutout
Nigga talking crazy tryna get the club shot up
I just had some coke inside the freezer tryna come up
Everything seems different when you spark a blunt up
Do it gang territory, dare you try to run up
Dare you try to run up, I dare you try to run up
I, I dare you try to run up

I just bring my bands up on a weekday
Gotta keep the hammer on the seat
I gotta switch my gun up every week baby
'Til I see a billion dollars ain't complete baby
See a trillion dollars ain't complete baby
(See a trillion dollars ain't complete baby)
Dare you try to run up, boy I dare you try to run up
I, I dare you try to run up

Off white leather gotta pop collars
Shawty bust it up, want top dollar
Caught a brown bad, bought her Margiela
I did the whole dance and said "you exceptional"

Main bitch on the sideline
Get a lotta money put your main bitch on the sideline
I just get them bands, get them xans, do a shoutout
I just get them bands and
