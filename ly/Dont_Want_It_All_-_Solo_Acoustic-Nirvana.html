		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  To hope is admittance
Feed before beginning
Double-sided cynics
Reflected image
Don't be so selfish
Leave in me this
Follow it far
To find where you are
You haven't grown
Go on alone
Never finished his sentence
Remained in seclusion
For the next few days
The family circle noose
He had removed us
All the styles of heresy
Finally he appeared unexpectedly
Looking for company
