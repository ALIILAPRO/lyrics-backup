		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Simple things, little things
Get lost in all the glitter and the bling
And the machine
Remember the trees and the bees
The memories of when you used to be
A kid on a swing

But I'm in Hollywood
Dreaming bigger than I ever should (ooh)
I'm a product of Hollywood
Dreaming bigger than I ever should
(Dreaming bigger than I ever-)
(Dreaming bigger than I ever-)

Simple things, little things
Get lost in all the glitter and the bling
And the machine
Remember the trees and the bees
And memories of when you used to be
A kid on a swing

But I'm in Hollywood
Dreaming bigger than I ever should (ooh)
I'm a product of Hollywood
Dreaming bigger than I ever should
(Dreaming bigger than I ever-)
(Dreaming bigger than I ever-)

What do you live for?
What are you here for?
What do you breathe for?
What do you stand for?
What would you die for?
What will you leave when you're gone?
What are you here for?
How could you give more?
How could you love more?
What do you live for?

But I'm in Hollywood
Dreaming bigger than I ever should (ooh)
I'm a product of Hollywood

Dreaming bigger than I ever should
(Dreaming bigger than I ever-)
(Dreaming bigger than I ever-)

Simple things, little things
Get lost in all the glitter and the bling
And the machine
