		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Gone cold, it's horrible weather
It's gone stone cold and you know we should've got it together
Well, it's nice, it's nice to be wanted
But I want you, want you too and never be frightened

Never had a broken heart
Never seen me fall apart
Haven't got a broken dream
Not that ain't too crazy scene
Don't know where I get the strength
And I'll go out of my head
I'm not even out of breath
I could go forever, yeah

Never had a broken heart
Am I incapable of love?
Never seen me fall apart
I must be incapable of love
Never had a broken heart
Yet I'm unavailable for love
And I should try and play my part
But I'm incapable

I don't know what I'm doing
Never had a broken heart
I don't know if I can love
In all honesty
I don't know if that's what I'm feeling
Never seen me fall apart
When I've never had my heart broken

Well, I get that there's a sensation
Never had a broken heart
Though I don't know what it means
You might never get to make a connection
Never seen me fall apart
If I don't learn how to feel
But I'm incapable (incapable, incapable)

Haven't got a broken heart
You have got to play your part
What will all the talking do?
I just wanna be with you
Haven't got a broken will
I could never get my fill
Haven't lost the energy
Haven't lost this other me

Haven't lost this other me
Haven't lost this other me
Haven't lost this other me
