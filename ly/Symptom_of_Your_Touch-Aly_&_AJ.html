		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Every night gets worse
It's harder to control the urge
My blood rushes up
And my judgement's on the way out

If you're asking me for closure
Just know what'll happen if I come over

It's a symptom of your touch
Symptom of your touch
If it feels so good
Why does it hurt so much?

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Way too many mistakes
You're familiar so it makes it easy
Where did we go wrong?
Who am I to say that I don't need you?

If you're asking me for closure
Don't expect it to happen when I lose my composure

It's a symptom of your touch
Symptom of your touch
If it feels so good
Why does it hurt so much?

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Why am I never capable
Of doing the right thing just for once?
Why am I never capable
Of doing the right thing just for once?
Why am I never capable
It's just a symptom of us
It's just a symptom 

It's a symptom of your touch
Symptom of your touch
If it feels so good
Why does it hurt so much?

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
