		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And in the dark he sits alone
To watch his final hours breathing
While unconcerned upon the wall
The clock it ticks away the time

No need for words for in the dark
All words have long since lost their meaning
Still when they whisper in his ear
He tries to read between the lines

What I see in the night
What I feel in your heart
All your dreams all your lies
Can you tell them apart

See the hands on the clock
Are you watching them turn
For your candle is quite low
We've been watching it burn

Do you lie here awake
As the shadows look on
Should they cry for your sake
Should you sleep in their arms

For the shadows see all
And they rarely forget
Every dream that you've had
Every act you regret
