		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't want no time on the big screen
I'm okay with me and my ripped jeans and you, and you

Messy hair, that's what he likes on me
I don't care as long as we're happy and free
To be just you and me, and free to be just you and me

They think it's a shame
That the world will never know our names
But I think that's okay
'Cause love gets ruined by money and power and fame and

We're just two poor kids from a really rich city
My oh my, what a pity
'Cause we've got a love story unlike the rest
No fancy suit and no fancy dress
Just us, just us, just love, just love
Just us, just us, just love, just love

He picks her up in a Benz but
My lover comes by himself and a dozen roses
He probably stole 'em
He's got a smudge of mud on his eye
Here to makes me break into smile
'Cause he drives them mad, oh, he drives them mad

'Cause they think it's a shame
That the world will never know our names
But I think that's okay
'Cause love gets ruined by money and power and fame and

We're just two poor kids from a really rich city
My oh my, what a pity
'Cause we've got a love story unlike the rest
No fancy suit and no fancy dress
Just us, just us, just love, just love
Just us, just us, just love, just love

Dollar signs all around us
We sneak onto the city bus
Too blinded by what we have to notice
Your mean old laughs

Dollar signs all around us
We sneak onto the city bus
Too blinded by what we have
To notice your mean old laughs

And they think it's a shame
That the world will never know our names
But I think that's okay
'Cause love gets ruined by money and power and fame and

We're just two poor kids from a really rich city
My oh my, what a pity
'Cause we've got a love story unlike the rest
No fancy suit and no fancy dress

Just us, just us, just love, just love
Just us, just us, just love, just love, love, loveca
