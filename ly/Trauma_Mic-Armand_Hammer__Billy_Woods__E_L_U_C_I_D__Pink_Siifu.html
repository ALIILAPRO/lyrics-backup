		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My brother in Christ, it's no I in team

Never wore a fitted in my life, big head busting out the seams

pressure bust pipes, lose your mind Getting Out Our Dreams

Brotha tryna rhyme, told him it's 100 niggas doing that right up the street

Hate to say it

Love to see it

Brotha drop a project every month, got the nerve to ask if I peeped it

Let me tell you a secret Them niggas aint dying for you!

It's the other way around if you actually read it

Storefront preacher, bring em in out the cold

Hot lunch, folding chairs, couple space heaters

Any one of you bums could be Jesus

Fingers numb, tryna work the light, that white like Mother Theresa

Hype when I first laid eyes on Bathsheba

buss down, middle part, big laugh, she still call grass cheeba

Missionary, cause I know G-d see us
