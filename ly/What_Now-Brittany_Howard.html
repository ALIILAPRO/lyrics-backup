		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't wanna confuse you for fulfillment
I don't want to wonder what our love is
I might be the one to cause you trouble
I've been asking questions you don't wanna know
I wonder if I'm here just so I'm not alone
It's painful but I might as well say sorry

I surrender, let me go
I don't have love to give you more
You're fucking up my energy
I told the truth so set me free

If you want someone to hate then blame it on me
Blame it on me
Blame it on me, girl
Blame it on me
If you want someone to hate then blame it on me

I've been making plans that don't include you anymore
My heart wants to stay but I don't know what for
I can't have you always thinking for me
I've been learning lessons I didn't wanna know
I wonder if I stay because it's comfortable
I wonder if you notice I ain't trying

I surrender, let me go
I don't have love to give you more
You're fucking up my energy
I told the truth so set me free

If you want someone to hate then blame it on me
Just blame it on me
Blame it on me
Blame it on me
If you want someone to hate then blame it on me

Oh

I don't wanna get used to all the tension
I don't wanna worry what kind of mood you're in
I don't wanna fall for your potential
I've been staying open you don't wanna grow
I've been seeing patterns that I can't ignore
It is what it is I guess I'm sorry

But I ain't sorry

I ain't sorry (blame it on me)
I ain't sorry (blame it on me)
But I ain't sorry (blame it on me)
But I ain't sorry (blame it on me)
If you want someone to hate then blame it on me

'Cause I ain't sorry (blame it on me)
No, I ain't sorry (blame it on me)
No, I ain't sorry (blame it on me)
I ain't sorry (blame it on me)
If you want someone to hate then blame it on me
