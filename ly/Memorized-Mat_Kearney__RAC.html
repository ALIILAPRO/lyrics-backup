		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know you by heart like ink on my sleeve
Right from the start makin' memories
You had bangs and a Honda Accord
I bought them jeans I couldn't afford
Threw you a party, the cops shut us down
You liked it better with just us around
Speaking to me without makin' a sound

Listenin' to Sade playin' on the radio
Sippin' on your latte, drawing on your window
You feel like second nature, can read it in your eyes
I don't need it down on paper, I got you memorized
I got you memorized
I got you memorized

You got all my respect girl like you know
When I got that first check and we bought a bungalow
Now that they tell me there's one on the way
Never did know that I could feel this way
Still on that high like nothing has changed

Listenin' to Sade playin' on the radio
Sippin' on your latte, drawing on your window
You feel like second nature, can read it in your eyes
I don't need it down on paper, I got you memorized
I got you memorized
I got you memorized

Don't need to lie in the dark
I already know your body by heart
Don't need to fire, don't need a spark
I already know your body by heart

Listenin' to Sade playin' on the radio
Sippin' on your latte, drawing on your window
You feel like second nature, can read it in your eyes
I don't need it down on paper, I got you memorized
I got you memorized
I got you memorized
I got you memorized
