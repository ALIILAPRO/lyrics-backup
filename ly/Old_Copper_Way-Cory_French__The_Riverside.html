		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Drop of blood hits John's shoes, as he says his amens
He grasped onto a pitchfork, leatherbound as a pen
With a hot wax, a seal on top, ran his finger across
cnd with the slyest of grins, reached the hand of the company boss

The devil, bragged I'd seen it all
Millin' bout on the outskirts, nothing shocking as I can recall
Guess I could learn a thing or two, so go on and grab me some rope
Yeah follow me down, you're a long way from hangin' onto last winter's hope

cnd Old Copper Way, hasn't run right since your grandfather's yesterday
cnd try as you might, it's the devil's invite, so keep your children off far way
Well you heard him, he ain't seen it all, wrap it up stop the bleeding,
I'm begging you now, run away hear us pleading
Cause Old Copper Way, it hasn't run right since your grandfather's yesterday

Pleasantly startled at how long those tunnels bore underground
Yeah big red called the dark twisted maze so ingenious, he couldn't help boast a frown
How clever to sign em' up, whistling their final fresh drops of air
Out on the edge of these hills, miles and miles past the last whispered prayers

But Old Copper Way, it hasn't run right since you're grandfather's yesterday
cnd try as you might, it's the devil's invite, so keep your children off far away
Well you heard him he ain't seen it all, wrap it up stop the bleeding
I'm begging you now, run away hear us pleading
Cause Old Copper Way it hasn't run right since you're grandfather's yesterday
Yeah old copper way, it hasn't run right, since your grandfather's yesterday
