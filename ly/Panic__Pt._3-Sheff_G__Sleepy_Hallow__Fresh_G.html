		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is a Melo beat

What you know about sittin' in traps?
(Traphouse Mob) matter of fact
What you know 'bout sleepin' in 'em?
Got weed, got crack and demons in it
Can't talk, my Sprite got lean up in it
Look i don't play with nobody, don't wait
On nobody, don't wait on me, uh
I don't hate on nobody, you
Hate on the posse, you hate on me
Told bro if I die
"Don't let that bread stop just
Send me some dead opps"
Know the gang still up on that sly shit
We don't talk all we know is fly shit
Boy, you buggin'
Think you thuggin' my clique
It ain't nothin', stuffin' corn
In my clip, like, stupid
T2MB be the team if you oppin'
I'm boomin' m8V3N, look
Don't got no brakes when I skate
On the cops I be movin' pull up gray flag
Left out the house with no breakfast
Smokin' straight gas in the whiplash
Pray that I don't see the gates fast
So, you got cash? Let me take half
Lawyer gon' beat up the case fast


Suck me up in court
System lying to the judge
I'm movin' with same tax
So I heard he wit' it
Look, slide in the hoopty, we
Hit him he move suspicious
Better not see a witness
Cap him, watch him scream, "Duck!"
40 baby beam, smoke him like a wet machine
Ever watch him scream stuck up it then I'm
Squeezing then walkin' right off the scene

And all my niggas do is blitzos kick those
Spinning with the crips when I say so
Straight two-three shots out the Draco
Hit him then forget him on the
Scene then we lay low
And all you see is white
Sheets and chalk and tape
No face, no case, ain't no mistakes
Play big hollow tips gon' change his way
Car getaway, no Sheff don't play no games

Look, what you know 'bout
Keepin' the strap? (Traphouse Mob)
Matter fact
Whatchu know 'bout feedin' clips in
Got cops outside, still creep out windows
Send shots, they like
"Still tuggin', chillin''', look
I'm a hunnid man, damn, hunnid bands
Only problem be rubber bands
Pray that 40 don't jam
When I squint, it got me
Hittin' him and his mans, but no homo
Man, this metal got bungee and bounce
Out of balance like Pogo's, look
Say that, spray that
Fuck with the gang and get left
As a poster or logo

Heavy Auto's
Get the Smith and I'm jumpin' we stripe
Through the scene in a four door
Blitz again for the night
That's for bro bro
Bend through your block with the beam
Know the promo

Look never solo
I'm with gang and we gang and that
30 held up by the Polo's never low though
Always ask, "Stupid bitch
Why you always try fuck up my mojo?"
Can't get locked though
Heard the Deez on my body
They ask me some shit, say, "I don't know"
Pass the chapo
I'm with bro, spin the blocko
Hop out, we cracking your toppo

What you know 'bout flippin' the pack?
Matter fact
What you know about stakin schemin'
Parked up all night call that faithful demons
Masked up, grips out
Paper chasin' dreaming like
I ain't gotta call up gang-gang
Never call up gang 'cause the
Gang they stay with me
I don't talk on the pain gang
Bro switched lane then gang
Gon' drench your tee

M8V3N, M8V3N gang (M8V3N gang)
Shoota, shoota, that's shoota gang
(shoota gang gang gang) gang, gang
M8V3N, M8V3N gang (M8V3N gang gang gang)
Shoota gang
