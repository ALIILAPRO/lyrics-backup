		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My fire is starved of oxygen
A flicker in the howling wind
Beware the night is closing in
And if I fall asleep, the shadows win

Well, the darkness came to take my faith
It tried to steal my words to pray
My love came down like holy rain
And she became my God that day

And she became my God that day

She taught me how to think out loud
To listen when there ain't no sound
To love myself through all the doubt
To sing and make my mother proud

Ooh, to sing and make my mother proud
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Mm, to sing and make my mother proud

In the dark, I learned to love again
A sacred place it's always been
Where souls depart and life begins
The dark led me to light again
Yeah, the dark led me to light again

Oh, oh
Ooh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Yeah, the dark led me to light again
Oh, oh
Ooh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Yeah, the dark led me to light again
