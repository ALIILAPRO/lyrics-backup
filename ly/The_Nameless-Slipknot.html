		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah

Pathetic (benign)
Accept it (undermine)
Your opinion (my justification)
Happy (safe)
Servant (caged)
Malice (utter weakness)
No toleration
Invade (committed)
Enraged (admit it)
Don't condescend (don't even disagree)
Desire (decay)
Disappoint (delay)
You suffered then
(Now suffer unto me)

Obsession (take another look)
Remember (every chance you took)
Decide, (either live with me) or give up
(Any thought you had of being free)

(Don't go) I never wanted anybody more than I wanted you
(I know) the only thing I ever really loved was hate

Anyone (no), anything (yes), anyway (fall)
Anybody (mine), anybody (tell me)
I want (you), I need (you), I'll have (you)
I won't (let anybody have you)
Obey (me), believe (me)
Just trust (me), worship (me), live for (me)
Be grateful (now), be honest (now)
Be precious (now), be mine (just love me)

Possession (feed my only vice)
Confession (I won't tell you twice)
Decide, (either die for me) or give up
(Any thought you had of being free)

(Don't go) I never wanted anybody more than I wanted you
(I know) the only thing I ever really loved was hurting you
(Don't go) I never wanted anybody more than I wanted you
(I know) the only thing I ever really loved was hate

Yeah
Yeah

Stay inside the hole
Let me take control (dominate)
You were nothing more
You were something less (innocent)
Something has to give
Something has to break (omnipresent)
Fingers on your skin
Let my savage in
You deserve it
You deserve it
You deserve it
You deserve it
You deserve it

(Don't go) I never wanted anybody more
Than I wanted you (I wanted you)
(I know) the only thing I ever really loved
Was hurting you (was hurting you)
(Don't go) I never wanted anybody more
Than I wanted you (I wanted you)
(I know) the only thing I ever really loved was hate

You're mine (I know who you are)
You're mine (I know who you are)
You're mine (I know who you are)
You're mine (I know who you are)
