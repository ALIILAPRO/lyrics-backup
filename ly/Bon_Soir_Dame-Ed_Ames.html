		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In a green wood close to our village
A quiet pool lies still and deep
The evening sounds and forest birds
Have gently lulled my love to sleep

[Chorus]
Bonsoir Dame, Madame, Fais dodo
(Good Evening Dear, My Dear, go to sleep)
Bonsoir Dame, Madame, Fais dodo
(Good Evening Dear, My Dear, go to sleep)
Bonsoir Dame, Madame, Fais dodo
(Good Evening Dear, My Dear, go to sleep)
Bonsoir Dame, Madame, Fais dodo
(Good Evening Dear, My Dear, go to sleep)

Sing softly birds and don't awake her
She doesn't know how my heart aches
I've never dared to say "I love you"
I'll tell her now, before she wakes

[Chorus]

Her pretty mouth is warm and smiling
She lies dreaming peacefully
I'd give my life to know for certain
That she would someday dream of me

[Chorus]

Fais dodo, petite fille
(Go to sleep, little lady)
Smile for me, dream of me

It seems a pity now to wake her
I'd rather stay here and pretend
If we could only stay forever
Then our dreams would never end

[Chorus]
