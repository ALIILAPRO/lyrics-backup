		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You don't take responsibility
For holding on to my heart the way you do
And you know I wear mine out on my sleeve
But what else can you expect me to do?

If you don't end it
When it's over
Could you leave me
Leave me lonely
'Cause when you break me
You break me slowly
You're not here, but you're still holding me

If you don't stop calling then I can't let go
When you're drunk and saying that you need me close
Please don't keep me haunted by your ghost
When you leave me, all I hear is your echo

Oh-oh, oh-oh
Your echo
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Your echo

Hold on to the possibility
That you and me could turn into us, oh
'Cause every time we break, it's never clean
And that's a death by a thousand cuts

If don't you end it
When it's over
Could you leave me
Leave me lonely
'Cause when you break me
You break me slowly
You're not here, but you're still holding me

If you don't stop calling, then I can't let go
When you're drunk and saying that you need me close
Please don't keep me haunted by your ghost
When you leave me all I hear is your echo

Oh-oh, oh-oh
Your echo
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Your echo

In my head, in my heart
In my body and my mind
It echoes
In my bed, I'm a wreck
And I'm trying to forget the echo

If you don't stop calling, then I can't let go
When you're drunk and saying that you need me close
Please don't keep me haunted by your ghost
When you leave me all I hear is

If you don't stop calling, then I can't let go
When you're drunk and saying that you need me close
Please don't keep me haunted by your ghost
When you leave me, all I hear is your echo

Oh-oh, oh-oh
Your echo
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Your echo

Oh-oh, oh-oh
Your echo
