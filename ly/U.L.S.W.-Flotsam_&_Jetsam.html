		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tonight we take the stage again
To shock you and capture your holes
The victims before us, words can't describe
The kind you seize only in your dreams
Her striking glance tells the story
The lust in her mind is plain to see
She knows that I know what she's thinking
Thinking of poisoning me

Poison me - snakes that bite - poison me

The time for gashing has come now
The reptile slithers to me
Just one more persuasion
Her cold blood boils from the heat
Penetration, injection is painless
Forked-tongue flicking about
A constrictor in the form of a woman
With such a grip I barely got out!

I'll poison you with my venom
Come to me, Viper and see

The stage smoulders in silence
The pounding and banging is done
For now, only until next time
When for my venom, again you will come
