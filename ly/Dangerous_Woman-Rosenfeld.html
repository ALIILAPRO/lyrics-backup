		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sweet talk and pretty face
I got beat at my own game
You came around
Made me lose my mind
A lovely crime
Around a glass of wine
You broke into my sinful life
You shot me down and stole my heart
With just a look you locked me up
I guess it's bad luck
You're a dangerous woman
You're a dangerous woman
Call a priest, call my mother
Cuz Lucifer is going back to being an angel
I've found redemption in a foxy incarnation
I'm giving up my reign in Hell to spend a day in Eden
You're the best woman for the worst of men
You bring some heaven to my wicked land
Cross my heart and hope to die
You leave me high and dry
You're a dangerous woman
You're a dangerous woman
You heard my prayers
My cry for danger
You came down to me like the darkest of angels
But your salvation
Feels like damnation
I'm prey to the worst of assassinations
You're a dangerous woman
You're a dangerous woman
Just like cyanide
I will breathe your lies
You could break my heart
And I would still come right back
You caught me off guard
I have lost this fight
So come on and end me
I'm at your mercy
You're a dangerous woman (Wooh)
You're a dangerous woman
You're a dangerous woman
You're a dangerous woman
