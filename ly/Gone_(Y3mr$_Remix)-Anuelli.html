		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was hoping you could be the one
Ashes on the ground I think we're done 
Guess that yesterday was all a game
When you said that you loved me 
Said that you loved me.. 

Murder baby.. 
Caught you in the middle of the night..
All I wanna say is goodbye 
Stars are fading
Caught you killing my love inside 
Goodbye goodbye.. 

I need to understand
What takes to be a man
There's nothing left to hold
No hand, no sholder
When love is gone 

Won't come back cause everything is gone 
Don't you call my name baby, so long
Everything was hidden like a game
When you said that you loved me
Said that you loved me
