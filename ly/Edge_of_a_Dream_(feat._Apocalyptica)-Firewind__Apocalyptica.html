		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  ""Didnt mean to cause you trouble. Didnt mean to cause you pain. I never though this could turn out this way Maybe i am a big mistake.  Didnt mean to say these words. Didnt mean to hurt your pride. We are looking far some inspiration I never found it in your heart.  Walking on the edge of a dream. Cant you see that i am real? Pretend that it's for ever! Walking to the edge of the world We belong in our dream For a while you feel the silence.  Only looking for forgiveness And when the ship is sinking fast I only looking for a sign that tells me Where i can walk through this endless field.  Walking on the edge of a dream. Cant you see that i am real? Pretend that it's for ever. Walking to the edge of the world We belong in our dream For a while you feel the silence. Waiting for the weight of the world In a place so cold! If tomorow never comes Hold my hand one last time one last call If tomorow never comes!  Tommorow never comes...""
