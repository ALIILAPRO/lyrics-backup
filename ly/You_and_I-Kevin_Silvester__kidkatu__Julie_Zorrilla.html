		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I was damaged would you love me the same
Would you vanish
Or would you not be ashamed
To see me manic
Would you bring me back down
Or when I panic
Could you be my Xanny
Without the liquor we don’t know how to behave
Touch of a finger and you can make me insane
But when I’m sober
Would you love me that way
Cuz I’d be lower, don’t want you to be the same
You and I
We can fly
So high we’ll never die
Promise you won’t leave my side
You and I
We can hide
Let’s just leave it all behind
Promise you won’t leave my side
You and I
Baby I told you
I can be there if you just want somebody to hold you
Tell me come over
I’ll be there right away, at your door like a Jehovah
But you so imperfectly perfect 
I’ll be there to reinstate that you worth it
All of my lessons, I learnt them 
Now when it comes to my bridges I burnt them 
Look, I’m tryna make some amends
I know you got mad
When I asked you to bring in some friends 
Fuck it, when all this quarantine ends 
I’m taking you to go shopping in France 
I’m taking you to go visit my ends 
If it’s underwhelming, just make sure you pretend 
You and I, 10 outta 10
Can you see what I see, maybe switch up the lens
I mixed up the frame and the picture
Cuz we doing everything that you could ever envision 
I feel like I bust outta prison
Every time you sad and I make you happy when I visit 
I feel like I’m lost in them system of working everyday
But you bring me down now I’m chilling
I could never do your wrong
Lemme take you far away
Take my hand if you willing
You and I
We can fly
So high we’ll never die
Promise you won’t leave my side
You and I
We can hide
Let’s just leave it all behind
Promise you won’t leave my side
You and I
