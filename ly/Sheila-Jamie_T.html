		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sheila goes out with her mate Stella
It gets poured all over her fella
'Cause she's says, "Man, he ain't no better
Than the next man kicking up fuss"
Drunk, she stumbles down by a river
Screams calling London (London!)
None of us heard her coming
I guess the carpet weren't rolled out

"Oh when my love, my darling
You've left me here alone
I'll walk the streets of London
Which once seemed all our own

The vast suburban churches
Together we have found
The ones which smelt of gaslight
The ones in incense drown'd"

Her lingo went from the cockney to the gringo
Any time she sing a song, the other girls sing along
And tell all the fellas that that lady is single
Fickle way to tickle on my young man's ting
She's up for doing what she like, any day more like the night
She drowned drunk sorrows that she stole, bought, borrowed
She didn't like fights but at the same time understood
Fellas will be fellas 'til the end of time

"Good heavens, you boys!
Blue blooded murder of the English tongue"

Bluh!

Jack had a gang that he called "The Many Grams"
He was known as Smack Jack the Cracker Man
In life he was dealt some shit hands
But the boys got the back now
And Jay went the same way as Mickey and Dan
Dependent mans upon the heroin
And man, Lisa had a baby with Sam
And now Jack's on his own man
Well done, Jack, glug down that cider
You're right, she's a slut and you never fucking liked her
Not like what, he stopped, so shocked
'Cause it turned out the last dance killed the pied piper
Tough little big man, friends with your daughters
Only 'cause they drive him to pick up all his quarters
Crawler, lager lout brawlers
Brought them their filth and they're free but they ain't near the border
Too young, gunned down by your hell fire corner
Always did a favour but never took a order
Behave, young scallywag, a fine young Galahad
Glad ragged up, but only ever getting fag hags
Hung on his shoulder, cheap price shop tag
Slag better understand he came for the glamour
But this town's original, superficial the issue
For one dear Jack had thirty-five doppelg√§ngers

Sheila goes out with her mate Stella
It gets poured all over her fella
'Cause she says, "Man, he ain't no better
Than the next man kicking up fuss"
Drunk, she stumbles down by a river
Screams calling London
None of us heard her coming
I guess the carpet weren't rolled out

"It's over man, it's over"

"London!"

So this a short story about the girl Georgina
Never seen a worse, clean young mess
Under stress at best, but she's pleased to see you
With love, God bless, we lay her body to rest
Now it all dear started with Daddy's alcoholic
Light weights chinking down, numbing his brain
And the doctor said he couldn't get the heart dear started
Now beat up, drugged up, she feeling the strain
She says, "In a rut, what the fuck I supposed to do?"
Suck it up, start, stop, keep running through
True, but you try, it ain't easy to do
She been buckle-belt beaten from the back like a brat
Don't know where she's going, but she know where she at
So Georgie, it's time to chain react
But the truth is, you know, she probably fought back
Tears stream down her face, she screamed away
"When I fall, no-one catch me
Alone lonely, I'll overdose slowly
Get scared, I'll scream and shout"
But you know it won't matter, she'll be passing out
I said gigidy-bigidy-up just another day
Another sad story, that's tragedy
Paramedic announced death at 10:30
Rip it up, kick it, to spit up the views

Sheila goes out with her mate Stella
It gets poured all over her fella
'Cause she says, "Man, he ain't no better
Than the next man kicking up fuss" (London!)
Drunk, she stumbles down by a river
Screams calling London
None of us heard her coming
I guess the carpet weren't rolled

None of us heard her coming
I guess the carpet weren't rolled out
