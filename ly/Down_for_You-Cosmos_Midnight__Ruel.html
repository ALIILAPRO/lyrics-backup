		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You said we'd just drop by
But I wasn't invited
You'd already decided
That I was coming too
I can't stand all these people
All trying to please you
They don't even see you
The way I do
Two AM, haven't left
No one cares, just me, I guess
But I can't leave you

I wasn't gonna say nothing
But I'm about to break something
How you gonna take all of my time

You know that I hate this place
But if you wanna stay, I do too
We'll let the night turn to day
Yeah, I'm down either way
'Cause I'm so down for you

And I can't find the patience
For all the conversations
And all of these blank faces
I should leave, I haven't yet
But when you smile, I just forget
But I can stay a while, I guess

I wasn't gonna say nothing
But I'm about to break something
How you gonna take all of my time

You know that I hate this place
But if you wanna stay, I do too
We'll let the night turn to day
Yeah, I'm down either way
'Cause I'm so down for you

You know that I hate this place
But if you wanna stay, I do too
We'll let the night turn to day
Yeah, I'm down either way
'Cause I'm so down for you

You know that I hate this place
But if you wanna stay, I do too
We'll let the night turn to day
Yeah, I'm down either way
'Cause I'm so down for you

I'm so down for you
So down for you
For you
I'm so down for you
For you
For you
