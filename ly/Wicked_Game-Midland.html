		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The world was on fire and no
One could save me but you
It′s strange what desire will make
Foolish people do
I'd never dreamed that I′d meet
Somebody like you
And I'd never dreamed that I'd
Lose somebody like you

And I don′t want to fall in love
(This girl is only gonna break your heart)
And I don′t want to fall in love
(This girl is only gonna break your heart)
With you with you

What a wicked game to play to
Make me feel this way
What a wicked thing to do
To let me dream of you
What a wicked thing to say
You never felt this way
What a wicked thing to do
To make me dream of you

And I don't want to fall in love
(This girl is only gonna break your heart)
No, I don′t want to fall in love
(This girl is only gonna break your heart)
With you with you

The world was on fire and no
One could save me but you
It's strange what desire will
Make foolish people do
I′d never dreamed that I'd
Love somebody like you
And I′d never dreamed that I'd
Lose somebody like you

And I don't want to fall in love
(This girl is only gonna break your heart)
And I don′t want to fall in love
(This girl is only gonna break your heart)

And I don′t want to fall in
(This girl is only gonna break your heart)

And I with you

With you

And I

Nobody loves no one
