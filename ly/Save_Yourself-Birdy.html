		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Love shouldn't cost a thing
Tell me why
I'm paying for everything
Pretending it's fine

Heaven knows, heaven knows
We're forever changing
Heaven knows, heaven knows
There's no way to save us

Look at what we have become
Empty hearts that spare no one
Save yourself, my darling
Just be gone by morning
After all is said and done
Still this war cannot be won
So save yourself, my darling
Kill the love that's dying

I don't know where you've been
Where you hide
You're here but I feel no thing
In your eyes

Heaven knows, heaven knows
We're forever changing
Heaven knows, heaven knows
There's no way to save us

Look at what we have become
Empty hearts that spare no one
Save yourself, my darling
Just be gone by morning
After all is said and done
Still this war cannot be won
So save yourself, my darling
Kill the love that's dying

Look at what we have become
Empty hearts that spare no one
Save yourself, my darling
Kill the love that's dying
