		  Body language
Oh yeah (yeah, yeah)
Oh yeah (yeah, yeah)
I see what I need to do
Yeah (yeah, yeah)
Oh yeah (yeah, yeah)

I see you watching
Tell me is
Something you like, like
'Cause I feel you eyes
As they undress me
No, don't you stop it
Love it with ya bad attitude, tude
'Cause I'm in the mood
Baby, impress me

Let me follow your lead
Baby, come on control me
Come over take on me
Take me
If you're in it for real
Go ahead put it on me
I know that you want me
So take me

Read my body language
I do what you like, like
So prove that you're right, right
(Control me)
Read my body language
I do what you like, like
Come into my spotlight
I got what ya need
(Need, need, need, need, need)
I got what ya need
(Need, need, need, need, need)

Boy, whatcha waiting for?
Come and take control over me, me
Show authority
'Cause I am looking for a boss type
Someone to fulfill all my needs, needs
So, give me a pices of your guidance

Let me follow your lead
Baby, come on control me
Come over take on me
Take me
If you're in it for real
Go ahead, put it on me
I know that you want me
So take me

Read my body language
I do what you like, like
So prove that you're right, right
(Control me)
Read my body language
I do what you like, like
Come into my spotlight
I got what ya need
(Need, need, need, need, need)
I got what ya need
(Need, need, need, need, need)

Check out
Chillin' in the back of the club tonight
Make kin between us only right?
But, keep dancin' show me your step
And go 'head speed it up like it
Get in the left lane
Up in the jet plane
Fuel about a mill mill
From Paris to Beverly Hills
We that ill (That's right)
Lay my eyes on a sassy pearl
Heidi Montag
Yeah, that's my girl

Read my body language
I do what you like, like
So prove that you're right, right
(Control me)
Read my body language
I do what you like, like
Come into my spotlight
I got what you need

Read my body language
I do what you like, like
So prove that your right, right
(Control me)
Read my body language
I do what you like, like
Come into my spotlight
I got what ya need
(Need, need, need, need, need)
I got what ya need
(Need, need, need, need, need)
I got what ya need
