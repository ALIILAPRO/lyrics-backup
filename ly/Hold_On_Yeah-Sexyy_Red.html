		  Grrr
Grrr

Hold on, yeah, I'm a fuckin' boss
Fast cars, tinted up, you know this shit cost (you know it)
A-and I'm drippin' red, bitch, I got the sauce (wop, wop)
Big dawg shit, I never took a loss (Sexyy)
You blow up his phone, but I ignore his calls
I ain't got a dick, but they be on my balls (yeah)
I was born raw, bitch, I ain't got no flaws (nope)
Watch yo' mouth, ho, I'm known for breakin' jaws (bow, bow)
Hold on, yeah, bitch, this that money talk
You ain't got no money, I ain't one of y'all
Slidin' through the set with my fuckin' dawgs (wop, wop)
High-speed on the north, had to shake the law (yoom)
And you know I been that bitch since the Grand Prix
N-now I'm ridin' foreign and they still can't stand me (Wop)
I'm a ghetto bitch but I keep it super fancy (muah)
And I keep a hammer on me, this bitch come in handy (ugh, ugh)

Hold on, yeah, this that money shit
Hold on, yeah, I ain't the one, lil' bitch
Hold on, yeah, this that money shit
Hold on, yeah, I ain't the one, lil' bitch

I ain't-I ain't-I ain't the one, bitch, I'll punish ya
I ain't gotta say a word, I just point at ya (come here)
And my peoples on yo' bumper in that black truck (skrrt, skrrt)
I be waitin' on a pussy ho to act up
Hold on, yeah, bitch, get yo' stacks up
Baby daddy in the cut and he masked up (wop, wop, wop)
Playin' with Big Sexyy, better have yo' bag up
Put that switchy on him, and make him back up (bow, bow)
You-you gon' need some help, you better have some back up (yup)
Bad-bad bitches give me hugs, niggas dap me up (on Blood)
You can't hang with the gang, you ain't one of us
Pull off in that hemi thang, all you see is dust (skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
When I reach in my purse, you better fuckin' duck
Bitch, don't make me mad, 'cause you gon' T me up
And these hoes big mad, they wanna beat me up
All these niggas choosin', they wanna eat my butt (ugh, ugh, ugh, eater)

Hold on, yeah, this that money shit
Hold on, yeah, I ain't the one, lil' bitch (ah)
Hold on, yeah, this that money shit
Hold on, yeah, I ain't the one, lil' bitch (Sexyy)
