		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All the words I had to say
They don't mean nothing to you
What the hell, we're on the way
There is no nothing better
All we had to do was touch
That was the best chance
I could've ever been of us

All day long we looked to fall
Looking into the sun
And found a way to get along
To be waiting for you
In the day, oh, in the day
There is nights between us
Looking for another way

All the words I said were wrong
They don't mean nothing to you
All we had to do was touch
And there's no nothing better
In the day, oh, in the day
I've been reaching for you
Nights between us all the way

It's all the way
You've got it, it took so long to bare
It's all the way
You got it, it took so long to bare
And we've been waiting for it

All the words I said were wrong
They don't mean nothing to you
All we had to do was touch
And there's no nothing better
What the hell are beds for, man?
They go waiting for you
Waste away, can't find the time
It's all by your side

Hey, you got it
Took too long to get it (you got it)
Hey, you got it
Took too long to get it (you got it)
Hey, you got it
Took too long to get it (you got it)
Hey, you got it
Took too long to get it (you got it)
Hey, you got it
Took too long to get it (you got it)
Hey, you got it
Took too long to get it (you got it)
Hey, you got it
Took too long to get it (you got it)
Hey, you got it
Took too long to get it (you got it)
