		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Always there for whoever is in need
He is a rock he knows no fear
Kindness is all that his heart knows
Wherever he goes
All of his love flows
His love flows
He doesn't show fear
His thoughts are all sincere
His presence to life is like
A diamond in the rough
A diamond in the rough
He does what he thinks is good
To no one he's ever cruel
Don't stop his march
Let's hope he lives on
Cuz a good man is hard to find
He's hard to find
I love the way he thinks
The way he thinks
He teaches me things so easily
Don't stop his march
Let's hope he lives on
Cuz a good man is hard to find
He's hard to find
He cannot be ruled
He is the one we all follow
Don't ever confuse
All his kindness as a weakness
Wherever he goes
All of his love flows
His love flows
He doesn't show fear
He shows no fear
His thoughts are all sincere
So sincere
His presence to life is like
A diamond in the rough
A diamond in the rough
He does what he thinks is good
To no one he's ever cruel
Don't stop his march
Lets hope he lives on
Cuz a good man is hard to find
He's hard to find
I love the way he thinks
The way he thinks
He teaches me things so easily
Don't stop his march
Let's hope he lives on
Cuz a good man is hard to find
He's hard to find
Don't stop his march
Let's hope he lives on
Cuz a good man is hard to find
