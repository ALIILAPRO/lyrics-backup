		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know this song 
Hasn't been too long
Played it in your car 
I've heard it before I'm sure
 
I know this sound 
Heard it around 
Sounds like what I like 
I've heard it before I'm sure 
------------
I can make the sound 
Run it the ground
Play it in your car 
I've heard it before I'm sure 
 
Can't remember where 
This sound was in the air 
Think it was the same 
I've heard it before I'm sure 
 
------------
We all know the beat 
Play it on repeat 
Heard it in your house 
Heard it before I'm sure 
 
It all sounds the same 
Love to play the game 
Play it with your friends 
You've heard it before I'm sure 
 
I know 
I know 
I know 
I know ..
