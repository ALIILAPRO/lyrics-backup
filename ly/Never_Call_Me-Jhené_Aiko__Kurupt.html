		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh boy, I'ma have to call them boys on you
Aw damn, aw damn, I'ma have to call that man on you
Something, something, something must be really wrong with you
Why can you just tell the fuckin' truth now?
Yes your mama did, she raised a fool, wow
What the fuck did you learn in that school house?
To chasin' thrills, takin' pills in the hills
Slauson Hills, Overhills might get you killed
And I won't come 'round them parts no more
Do not run your mouth no more
I can't protect you no more
It's out of my hands for sure

You should've called me
Why you never call me?
Why you never call me?
Oh, you should've called me
Why you never call me?
Why you never call me?
Oh

Okay, now you wanna say all that I done to ya
You knew all along that I wasn't the one for you
So let's stop pretending like we were in love
We never shared anything but the drugs
We were both numb, never had anything real between us
We really must
Smoking that crazy shit, in my city talkin' crazy shit
But you ain't know I'm a crazy bitch
And tell your lawyer that I ain't paying shit
Maybe you should chill, really in your feels
My bros really in the field
Neighborhood is really real and they don't play that here
You shouldn't say that here
You should've made it clear, my dear
You should've called me

You should've called me
Why you never call me?
Why you never call me?
Oh, you should've called me
Why you never call me?
Oh

You, you, you, you
You should've called me
You, you, you, you
Oh, oh
You, you, you, you
You should've called me
You, you, you, you

Now hey sis, I'ma let you know like this
Hit me right back, this Kurupt, okay?
All these niggas with this bullshit, man, fuck these niggas mayne
The 60's, we ain't worried bout none of these muthafuckin' bustas
Ya understand me? From Overhill to the fronts to the back mayne
We pushin' this line d'nine
So don't worry 'bout none of this shit from these funny ass niggas
Don't worry 'bout him callin' you and all the rest of that shit
You know what? It's his lost, ya know what I'm sayin'?
I'm pretty p'd
I heard the homie, the homie called me and was like
"Man Jhene trippin, man this buster ass nigga got her mind fucked up"
I'm like "No no Jhene"
Man fuck that nigga mayne
Nene, you hit me I got you, you understand me?
These niggas is busters, fuck that nigga and fuck his friends, and fuck his bitch
He's nothin my nigga, you are the one, everyone else is 2's and 3's
You're the one, I love you, make sure you hit me back
This is your big brother, you hear me?
This is Kurupt, Gotti
Ay, call me as soon as you get this, you hear me?
Don't make me call your mama now, I'll track you down
