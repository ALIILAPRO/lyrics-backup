		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lead me through your fucking world of joke
Feed me with your luck until I choke

Will you scorn me, will you break me? 
Are you able to forsake me? 
Will you scorn me, will you hate me? 
Won't you finally concentrate my pain? 

Call my name until I clench my fist
Fan the flame until I slash my wrist

Will you scorn me, will you break me? 
Are you able to forsake me? 
Will you scorn me, will you hate me? 
Won't you finally consecrate my hate? 

Bite - nothing can save me from my scorn
Fight - nothing can spare me from my hate
Bite - nothing can save me from my scorn
Fight - nothing can spare me from my... 

And now you read my mind
And now you see my kind

Will you scorn me, will you break me? 
Are you able to forsake me? 
Will you scorn me, will you hate me? 
Won't you finally consecrate me? 

Are you able to forsake me? 
Won't you finally consecrate my hate? 

Bite - nothing can save me from my scorn
Fight - nothing can spare me from my hate
Bite - nothing can save me from my scorn
Fight - nothing can spare me from my...
