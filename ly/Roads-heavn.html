		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Just come talk to me, don't ask for help
You're alone with no one else
Can't believe I said it once before
Gotta break away from this, I said
You've been up and through my head
Just look at me, don't laugh just like before
(Before, before, before)

And when we talk, it don't last
We used to skip out on class
And then we sat by the grass, but you forgot
You took too many years
You say that I'm the one to
Blame and it's my fault (I don't wanna talk)

Just come talk to me, don't ask for help
You're alonе with no one else
Can't bеlieve I said it once before
Gotta break away from this, I said
You've been up and through my head
Just look at me, don't laugh just like before
(Before, before, before)
