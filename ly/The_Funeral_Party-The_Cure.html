		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Two pale figures 
Ache in silence 
Timeless 
In the quiet ground 
Side by side 
In age and sadness 
I watched 
And acted wordlessly 
As piece by piece 
You performed your story 
Moving through an unknown past 
Dancing at the funeral party 

Memories of children's dreams 
Lie lifeless 
Fading 
Lifeless 
Hand in hand with fear and shadows 
Crying at the funeral party 

I heard a song 
And turned away 
As piece by piece 
You performed your story 
Noiselessly across the floor 
Dancing at the funeral party
