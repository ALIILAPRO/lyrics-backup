		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can take your man, if I want to
I can take your man, if I want to 

I can take your mans, if I want to (Want to)
But lucky for you, I don't want to (Want to)
I can take your mans, if I want to
But lucky for you, I don't want to

Why you coming at me with that attitude? (Huh)
Slapping on my ego now I'm mad at you (Shoo)
Now I gotta do what I gotta do (Mm)
Kinda sad don't even like the dude

Not Mickey D's but he's lovin' it (Lovin' it)
Tall glass of water gotta take a sip (Take a sip)
Call him Arby's cuz he has the meat (The meat) 
Pipe down girl better take a seat (A seat) 
I can take your mans, if I want to (Want to)
But lucky for you, I don't want to (Want to)
I can take your mans, if I want to (Want to)
But lucky for you, I don't want to (I don't want to)

Why play tag when you know I'm it (Tag)
You already lost, should've known to quit (Ha)
Life's a game and you're taking L's
Your man don't even like the way your coochie smells (Uh)

Not Mickey D's but he's lovin' it (Lovin' it)
Tall glass of water gotta take a sip (Ahh)
Call him Arby's cuz he has the meat (The meat) 
Pipe down girl better take a seat (A seat) 
I can take your mans, if I want to (Want to)
But lucky for you, I don't want to (Want to)
I can take your mans, if I want to (Want to)
But lucky for you, I don't want to (I don't want to)
 
I'll take your man, I'll take your man
I'll take your man, I'll take your man
Hold on my phones ringing
It's your man

I can take your mans, if I want to
But lucky for you, I don't want to (Do I want to?)
I can take your mans, if I want to
But lucky for you, I don't want to (I think I want to)
I can take your mans, if I want to
But lucky for you, I don't want to (Yeah I want to)
I can take your mans, if I want to
But lucky for you, I don't want to (I think I want to)

I took your man
Hahahaha
He's mine, he ain't yours
