		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  As I turn out the light
I'm consumed by the night
Am I happy?

When my whole body aches
And I feel that I fake
My emotions

I can't believe
That vibe I feel inside

The moon, the sun, the stars
Were passing by

In my life I'm free
If the whole world agrees
Still I'm dying

And I hoped for so long
That one single song
Could set me free

I can't believe
The vibe I feel inside

The moon, the sun, the stars
Were passing by

Just as long as I'm here
It is waiting for me
As long as I'm here
It's calling out loud

Let me ease your pain
Let me ease your pain
Let me ease your pain
Tonight
