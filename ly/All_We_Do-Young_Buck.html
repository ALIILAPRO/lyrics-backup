		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Intro]
When you sign a record deal they say:""Look
I like you, you finna making me some money
Record's singer, Imma give you this money""
Basically, what they doing is
Give me some clothes so I can get out on a track, right
It's the exact same game, they gon' work me till I'm
Burned out, busted and dead
As soon as I... can't sell a record
They send me back, to the curb
Ain't no love, the biggest mistake any hoes believe
The pimp really loves them
You know what I'm sayin'? Theirs fault
So, I'm tellin' these artists, I'm sayin':
""Yo, they don't love you. They just love the money
You're capable of [?]"", and my objective was to
Get to the point where I can pimp myself

[Ad-Libs]
(You're crazy.)
Twerkin' in the fast lane
(I'm in your city.)
Yeah, yeah
(What's up?)
It's Buck
(Hop out the streets with me, yey)

[Verse 1]
Ain't got so much to say they think I'm out the way (okay)
I got so much to say, I just got out today
You know very well my life ain't been no fairytale
I pull up in every [?], put my all on [?]
Fuck 'em, if they left me then stay over there (over there)
(over there, over there, stay over there)
I said fuck you, if ya left me then stay over there (yeah)
I'm back out here, I got it on me, you can't go nowhere
Okay, let me speak out, ain't no nigga knock my teeth out
What this motherfuckin' [?], cause I fucked the nigga bitch?
Cause I really bring the streets out, and I really keep my heat out
And I'm really tryin' to see bout all you niggas talkin' shit (ey man)

[Hook]
What's up (that's what's up), what's up (what y'all wanna do)
What's up, what's up (ya), I said
What's up (that's what's up), what's up (what y'all tryna do)
What's up, what's up, y'all know what's up
What's up (that's what's up), what's up (what y'all wanna do)
What's up, what's up, this is (ya)
What's up (that's what's up), what's up (what y'all tryna do)
What's up (I'm not runnin' from nobody), what's up (yeah yeah)

[Verse 2]
Ain't never sign no artists to my label (nah)
They got many local rappers dumpin' in my table
I show up at your video if I'm able
As long as you keep in your CD stable, niggas pay you (they know I)
[?] But they never put nobody on, that's [?]
Guy like [?] everybody gone, what happen
When your [?] have to lookin' for him
You can take the fake, but you'll live homie, take it for 'em (okay)
Niggas don't know how to cook up, I gotta cook it for 'em (hello)
Taught you niggas how to fish, I gotta hook it for 'em
And name my city *Ca$hville* and we get that bag stealin' (yea)
I'm really that real, if you really knew him, hey Shawty, what's up

[Hook]
What's up (that's what's up), what's up (what y'all wanna do)
What's up, what's up (ya), I said
What's up (that's what's up), what's up (what y'all tryna do)
What's up, what's up, y'all know what's up
What's up (that's what's up), what's up (what y'all wanna do)
What's up, what's up, this is (ya)
What's up (that's what's up), what's up (what y'all tryna do)
What's up, what's up (runnin' from nobody)

[Speaking over hook]
Look out
The foundation of this shit
Buckshots
They throw dirt on my name
And I come out clean in a motherfucker
Y'all know what's up
