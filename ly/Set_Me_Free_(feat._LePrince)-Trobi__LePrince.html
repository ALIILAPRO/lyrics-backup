		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The night was young, air was still
Perfect night for my lover to be on again
I'll try my best, I'll watch my step
Put my heart on the table and she shouted loud

Oh, uh oh uh oh oh oh
Uh oh uh oh oh oh, oh
I'll be, she said
Oh, uh oh uh oh oh oh
Uh oh uh oh oh oh, oh
I'll be, she said

I treat her right, I'm light as hell
I only tried my best to behave myself
Declare my love, she said my words
We're completely unfounded, then she shouted like

Oh, uh oh uh oh oh oh
Uh oh uh oh oh oh, oh
I'll be, she said
Oh, uh oh uh oh oh oh
Uh oh uh oh oh oh, oh
I'll be, she said

Girls don't fight and boys don't cry
That's a lie and you know it when you look at me
Girls don't fight and boys don't cry
That's a lie and you know it when you look at me

Oh, uh oh uh oh oh oh
Uh oh uh oh oh oh, oh
I'll be, she said
Oh, uh oh uh oh oh oh
Uh oh uh oh oh oh, oh
I'll be, she said
