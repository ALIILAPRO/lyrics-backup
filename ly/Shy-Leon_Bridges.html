		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Staring at the ceiling
Hearts and records spinning, round (mmm)
I've been, loving with no meaning
Running from a feeling, that
You know that I want you

Mmm, don't get me started at this time of night
Hard to keep my guard up and the feeling's right
I don't need nobody but for you I might
And all that want is you

I just wanna see you
You could come over
I know you're shy
You can be shy with me
You know I need you
And I'm not quite sober
I know you're shy, baby
You can be shy, it's alright
I just wanna see you
You could come over
I know you're shy
You can be shy with me
You know I need you
And I'm not quite sober
I know you're shy, baby
You can be shy
You can be shy, with me

Met you back in August
Thought you were standoffish, coy (mmm)
But you don't have to try
I'll read between your lines (ohh)
'Cause darling I want you
Ohh ohh ohh why?

You ain't gonna hide who you are tonight
No, take your time
We can move slow, with your hips on mine
Hey, you're so shy
Won't you come 'round here and waste my time
'Cause all that I want is you

I just wanna see you
You could come over
I know you're shy
You can be shy with me
You know I need you
And I'm not quite sober
I know you're shy, baby
You can be shy, shy
It's alright
I just wanna see you
You could come over
I know you're shy
You can be shy with me
'Cause baby I need you
And I'm kinda shy too
Maybe tonight, baby
You can be shy
You can be shy, with me
