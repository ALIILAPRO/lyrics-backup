		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I keep on dancing, I don't wanna know
The world outside
There is a rhythm beating in our hearts
You can't deny

So give your love, let it out
Let it be, I don't mind
Give all you got, don't be shy
Salty wave, cherry taste
Do I feel syncopate?
Give all you got to me now

Getting on a plane with a morning sun (getting on a plane)
Baby, let's pretend that it's all forgotten
I don't wanna stay where our love went wrong
I just wanna dance, wanna dance
Dance like my feet are haunted
Dance like my feet are haunted
Like my feet are haunted

Bad days are feelings only for tonight
We'll drink 'em all
A sweet illusion tells me this is right
You'll catch my fall

So give your love, let it out
Let it be, I don't mind
Give all you got, don't be shy
Salty wave, cherry taste
Do I feel syncopate?
Give all you got to me now

Getting on a plane with a morning sun
Baby, let's pretend that it's all forgotten
I don't wanna stay where our love went wrong
I just wanna dance, wanna dance
Dance like my feet are haunted
Like my feet are haunted
Like my feet are haunted

Give all you got to me now, ow, ow, ow, ow

Getting on a plane with a morning sun (ey)
Baby, let's pretend that it's all forgotten (it's all forgotten)
I don't wanna stay where our love went wrong (oh, love went wrong)
I just wanna dance, wanna dance (oh, love went wrong)
Dance like my feet are haunted
Like my feet are haunted
(Like my feet are haunted)
(Dance, like my feet are haunted)

Dance, like my feet are haunted
