		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When she was a young girl
She used to play with me
I was her best friend
We were in separately
We loved to ride our bikes
Playing hide and seek
Sneaking all the night
Dancing in the street
I look back at the time
Now I realize
She loved to play with fire
I should have seen it in her eyes
I should have seen it in her eyes

Deep inside, you cry cry cry
Don't let your hopes, die die die
Deep inside, you cry cry cry
Don't let your hopes, die die die

Na,na,na,na,na,na,na
Na,na,na,na,na,na,na

She fell in love for the first time
He was older than her
Then he made her do things
First she wouldn't dare
She left everything behind
Couldn't find a place
Running through the night
Loosing all her faith
She throws away the pain
Turning off her lies
But still he makes her see 
Like everything's alright
Like everything's alright

Deep inside, you cry cry cry
Don't let your hopes, die die die
Deep inside, you cry cry cry
Don't let your hopes, die die die

Deep inside, you cry cry cry
Don't let your hopes, die die die
Deep inside, you cry cry cry
Don't let your hopes, die die die
