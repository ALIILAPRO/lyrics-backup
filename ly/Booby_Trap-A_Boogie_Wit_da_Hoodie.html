		  (Zaytoven)
Uh, uh
Uh, uh
Yeah (we got London on the track)
Ayy

Makin' up my mind, I need two hoes at a time
Then I told her ass, "Forget it", 'cause I seen that shit on Reddit
I ain't got no time to block
All my broskis keep a mop
And I keep one right beside me, go to Elliot a lot
My heart cold as a brick, I call London for the hit
I treat Booby Trap like Starlets, hunnid thousand on a car
Got Chanel prints on my joggers, I don't even need a stylist
Huh, yeah, okay, okay

Call the bank, pull up the Brink's
Might buy you a Cuban, I ain't got no time to link up
Yeah, got Saint Michaels on my tee
Quarter million dollars, I got somethin' on my sleeve
Used to call her darlin', now I go to Starlets
When I wanna clear my mind, throw two hunnid at a time
Used to be in projects, now I'm makin' projects
Used to be in the PJ's, now I'm stuck to the PJ

I can tell what's on your mind, Illuminati, got three eyes
If I pull up with my guys, we ain't comin' here to fight
Word to mother, we go in, you know London, that's my twin
And I keep Jeffery on my mind, free Thugger, that's my slime
Free V12 and Montana, out the motherfuckin-
You know I've been bangin' since Santana, used to rock them bandanas
To the side, baby, talk to me nice
Book a flight, if you don't let me hit, I'm sending you back tonight
I'm in Miami, come to Booby Trap, I'm throwin' a bag tonight
The way she took my soul, it's like she's tryna make a sacrifice
In the daytime, diamonds bussin' like a disco ball
We bring the lights out, hoodie on, I'm feelin' like a fuckin' thief at night

Look, call the bank, pull up the Brink's
Might buy you a Cuban, I ain't got no time to link up
Yeah, got Saint Michaels on my tee
Quarter million dollars, I got somethin' on my sleeve
Used to call her darlin', now I go to Starlets
When I wanna clear my mind, throw two hunnid at a time
Used to be in projects, now I'm makin' projects
Used to be in the PJ's, now I'm stuck to the PJ
