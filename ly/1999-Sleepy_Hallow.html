		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You shouldn't love me, I'm dangerous
Mama said, "Look boy, you famous"
Slept in that trap 'til they raided
(Great John on the beat, by the way)

Look, I'ma leave with them niggas I came with
You shouldn't love me, I'm dangerous
Mama said, "Look boy, you famous"
Slept in that trap 'til they raided
Look, couldn't see no way out, had to stay up
Get to shootin', we don't lay up
Count the bag and better pay up

Look, fuck it, we thuggin' it out
Trap got lit, niggas run in and out
Buss down, Benny just flooded it out
Ice on my neck it's a freezer freezer, huh
I think I need her need her
Fuck love, no I don't believe it, huh
I might just keep her and leave her
Fucked up and it ain't no secret
Brand new kicks, no creases
Hop out, flex, new whip look decent, huh
Can't you tell I'm fightin' demons? Huh
Pour the purp' and now I'm leanin', huh
Where the opps? 'Cause I ain't seen 'em, huh
Movin' dirty, I'ma clean 'em up
Say you love me, better mean it, huh
Tell me somethin' I don't know about
Thunder make sound but that lightin' strike 'em
All bark with no bite, you know Sleep don't do no typin'
Don't lose your life, how we livin' just to die? Uh
Shit got you thinkin' twice, fuck that bitch, ain't even wife it
She ain't know my time, see my wrist, I told her watch it
Bitch, I ain't got the time
Remember runnin' niggas' pockets, like what you got, it's mine, ayy
Gotta stand out, can't fit in
Know some niggas that die just to live it
I can't lie, I've been down for a minute
Speed in that whip, I ain't doin' the limit
Girl, I know what to do when I'm in it
She ain't know what to do when I hit it
Stop the frontin' your move, got nothin' to prove 
Can't say what it is when it isn't

Look, I'ma leave with them niggas I came with
You shouldn't love me, I'm dangerous
Mama said, "Look boy, you famous"
Slept in that trap 'til they raided
Look, couldn't see no way out, had to stay up
Get to shootin', we don't lay up
Count the bag and better pay up

You shouldn't love me, I'm dangerous
Mama said, "Look boy, you famous"
Slept in that trap 'til they raided

She said, "Baby, you made it"
Shooters impatient
Can't fuck with them niggas, I'm racist
Can't love on that bitch, she too basic, huh
You gotta face it, huh, we could switch places
You said that you got me, I know you don't got me 
The ones who left me said the same shit
I was sinkin' and you changed shit
Fuck it, I'm sanctioned
Glock on my hip for this gang shit
We seen a lot and never say shit
Mama said, "Look boy, you famous", huh
"Look boy you iced out"
Lil' sister think you the greatest
We made it shine when the lights out, huh
Hundred shots, I got the gang with me, huh
Ain't no lames with me
Actin' up, we give your gang fifty, huh
Keep the gang busy
I'ma shooter, but shooters be with me
Passin' the rock and you know it's a Jimmy
What you doin'? They movin' too iffy
Empty that clip, we gon' dip when it's empty
(Girl you know what's up, hard to be showin' love)
(I know I left you out, I was in there stuck)
(Sorry I left you down, I was goin' up)

Look, I'ma leave with them niggas I came with
You shouldn't love me, I'm dangerous
Mama said, "Look boy, you famous"
Slept in that trap 'til they raided
Look, couldn't see no way out, had to stay up
Get to shootin', we don't lay up
Count the bag and better pay up
