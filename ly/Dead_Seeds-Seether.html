		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wake like pendulum swinging in circles
You can't relate to a world that don't involve your greed
And as I say this the words are pouring from a bleeding mouth
But if I stay here you'll only render me the weak one
So turn that focus back off me now
And go get your broken mirror

The more you get the more you need now (she knows it now)
And it all comes down to your love of misery
Consequences plant the seeds now (she knows it now)
But in the cold black ground you will find it hard to scream

Hey I wish I could find a way to turn this around
But if I play God then everything just goes to seed
And as I say this I hope that you can hear me bleeding out
Oh God I hate this I'm all alone and I am beaten down
So turn that focus back off me now
And go get your broken mirror

The more you get the more you need now (she knows it now)
And it all comes down to your love of misery
Consequences plant the seeds now (she knows it now)
But in the cold black ground you will find it hard to scream

As you spit your blame on me
Please tread softly as you go
I don't have enough to give
And you have robbed me of my hope

The more you get the more you need now (she knows it now)
And it all comes down to your love of misery
Consequences plant the seeds now (she knows it now)
But in the cold black ground you will find it hard to scream

I can't remit this
I can't remit this
As God as my witness
I cannot save from burning now
