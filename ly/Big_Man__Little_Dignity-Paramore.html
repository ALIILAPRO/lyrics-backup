		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't mean to stare at you from across the room
It's like I'm glued to the sheer sight of you
And you're so smooth, it's pitiful
Know you could get away with anything
So that's exactly what you do

Big man (ooh), little dignity
Big man (ooh), little dignity
No offense but you, you got no integrity
Big man (ooh), la-la-la little dignity

Well-well-well look at you
Don't you clean up nice?
Bet it feels good to leave the past behind
Your subscription to redemption has been renewed
You keep your head high
Smooth operator in a shit-stained suit

Big man (ooh), little dignity
Big man (ooh), little dignity
No offense but you, you got no integrity
Big man (ooh), la-la-la little dignity
Oh, I can't look away

I memorized all your lies
I can't look away, you're like a movie that I love to hate
I fantasize your demise
I should look away because I know you're never gonna change

I keep thinking
This time the end'll be different but it isn't
I keep thinking (keep thinking)
The end is gonna be different
But you keep on winning

Big man (ooh), little dignity
Big man (ooh), little dignity
No offense but you, you got no integrity
Big man (ooh), la-la-la little dignity
