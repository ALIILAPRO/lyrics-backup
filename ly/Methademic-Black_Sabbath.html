		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The epidemic from a crystal lie
Puts you in super over drive
The methademic that is so hard to hide
Insanely staring with wide eyes

Hellucinating in a chemical Hell
Ain't my idea of having fun
Synthetic overload you're under its spell
Your super nightmare's just begun

You try to stop, but it controls you
Your love affair with it won't last
You're on a suicidal ride of self-destruction
And in the end you're gonna crash

You live too fast
You live too fast

You look just like a dead man alive
Losing the fight for survival
You sit and wait at Hell's fiery gate
Waiting the Devil's arrival

You live so fast you need more methademic crystal
You never sleep you just keep goin'
Just push the trigger on your hypodermic pistol
Each time you're dying without knowing

You live too fast
You live too fast

What's the point it's killing you without you even knowing
I can tell you've sold your soul and hell is where you're going
I'll see you there
