		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Road trippin' with my two favorite allies
Fully loaded, we got snacks and supplies
It's time to leave this town, it's time to steal away
Let's go get lost anywhere in the U.S.A.
Let's go get lost, let's go get lost
Blue, you sit so pretty west of the one
Sparkle light with yellow icing, just a mirror for the sun

Just a mirror for the sun
Just a mirror for the sun
These smiling eyes are just a mirror for

So much as come before those battles lost and won
This life is shining more forever in the sun
Now let us check our heads and let us check the surf
Staying high and dry's more trouble than it's worth in the sun

Just a mirror for the sun
Just a mirror for the sun
These smiling eyes are just a mirror for

In Big Sur, we take some time to linger on
We three hunky dory's got our snake finger on
Now let us drink the stars, it's time to steal away
Let's go get lost right here in the U.S.A.
Let's go get lost, let's go get lost
Blue, you sit so pretty west of the one
Sparkle light with yellow icing, just a mirror for the sun

Just a mirror for the sun
Just a mirror for the sun
These smiling eyes are just a mirror for
These smiling eyes are just a mirror for
Your smiling eyes are just a mirror for
