		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Stay in your coma
In your own frustration
Lip sinkin' haircut
Blow me away

'Cause I'd rather be in this noise
Suffocate in this noise colder
It means so much to me

Nostalgia
Makes your livin' so easy
Ludites
Make it easy for me

'Cause I'd rather be in this noise
Suffocate in this noise
Colder
It means so much to me

To me to me to me
To me to me to me

'Cause I'd rather be in this noise
'Cause I'd rather be in this noise
'Cause I'd rather be in this noise
'Cause I'd rather be in this noise

Rather be in this noise
Rather be in this noise
I'd rather be in this noise
Rather be in this noise
Rather be in this noise

Repetition baby
Machine is takin' over
Dance with me baby
The future is here

Scientific baby
Waltz hand in hand
Scientific baby
Technological man

Would you rather be in this noise?
Celebrate in this noise colder
It means so much to me

Would you rather be in this noise?
Celebrate in this noise
Colder
It means so much to me

Repetition baby
There's no escape from me here
Run run baby
Try to run from me here

Reconciliation
Welcome back here
Fun fun fun fun fun
Get your fun from us here

'Cause I'd rather be in this noise
Celebrate in this noise
Colder
It means so much to me

'Cause I'd rather be in this noise
Celebrate in this noise
Colder
It means so much to me

It means so much to me
It means so much to me
It means so much to me
It means so much to me
It means so much to me
