		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Through benediction
You tried to rid your mind
Of malediction
But through all this time
You tried to peel it off
And it's such a ride, ahh

Your desolation
Led you into this
Vile incarnation
Of consummated bliss
I know you need it now
To make you feel alive
(Ahh)

All your faith, all your rage
All your pain, it ain't over now
And I ain't talking about forgiveness
All your faith, all your rage
All your pain, it ain't over now

It's the cruel beast that you feed
It's your burning yearning need to bleed
Through the spillways (spillways)

You keep a casket
Buried deep within
You try to mask it
But fall back in sin
You wanna shake it off
But you're stuck inside

When stripped of rags
Of skin and spine
Human decay, corpus dei
Terminally dispelled
And it's such a ride

All your faith, all your rage
All your pain, it ain't over now
And I ain't talking about forgiveness
All your faith, all your rage
All your pain, it ain't over now

It's the cruel beast that you feed
It's your burning yearning need to bleed
Through the spillways
Through the spillways of your soul
Through the spillways
Spillways, spillways

It's the cruel beast that you feed
It's your burning yearning need to bleed
Through the spillways
Through the spillways of your soul
Through the spillways
Through the spillways of your soul
Through the spillways
Through the spillways of your soul
Through the spillways
Through the spillways of your soul
