		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hands pressed to your thighs as if you could protect them
From the thoughts that you’ve had that conspire against them
Even though you need them to get by
Last chance to be a kid with a cereal box
Had a dream in your head but you woke up and lost it
And you only get a few more candles before you’re too old
To try again, to be a wreck, to get the sympathy of friends
Who see that you’re not there yet, but they say that you’ll get there and then

All all of a sudden you’re a bad liar Cuz you said that it would get better But all of the sudden it’s a trashfire And you can’t put it out, can’t put it out All of a sudden you’re a hostage
To things you thought you wanted
All of a sudden you’re a hot mess
And you can’t sweat it out, can’t sweat it out

Gets tough being young but you do it for kicks
Kinda hate how it tastes but you eat it with chopsticks Existentialist, you wanna know what all of this is
Four more months, it’s just a season
Cut your loss, you’ll start to think that
Things you have are things you’ll lose,
It’s normal but it’s not the truth

All of a sudden you’re a bad liar
Cuz you said that it would get better
But all of the sudden it’s a trashfire
And you can’t put it out, can’t put it out
All of a sudden you’re a hostage
To things you thought you wanted
All of a sudden you’re a hot mess
And you can’t sweat it out, can’t sweat it out

All of a sudden you’re a bad liar
All of a sudden you’re a trashfire
But if anybody treats you like a hazard You’re the one with your thumb on the lighter
