		  I. Hold in Derision

Pioneering, big breakthroughs
Proceeded by the opposition
Hold in derision all that's new
Afraid to lose their own esteem

Scorn shall be directed at the genius
Represses subtle theories of the light
To the questions of life

Quantum physics leads us to
Answers to the great taboos
We create the world around us
God is every living soul

Science, spirituality
Will have to meet along the way and
We need new drifts, another view
Expand our grip on the cryptic soul

Scorn shall be directed at the genius
Represses subtle theories of the light
To the questions of life

Quantum physics leads us to
Answers to the great taboos
We create the world around us
God is every living soul

Hope is more than a postponed disappointment

Non intellegens nil explicas
Videre nolens nil capies
Non intellegens nil explicas
Incognita non vides

Open your Sashara

II. Children of the Light

Light creates us all
Pride will make us fall
Life is meaningful
Life delights us all
Light creates us all
Pride divides us all
Life is meaningful
The soul survives us all

Misled by science
Our wake up call
Conditioning cannot fool us 'till the end

Light creates us all
Pride will make us fall
Life is meaningful
Life delights us all
Light creates us all
Pride divides us all
Life is meaningful
The soul survives us all

III. Bardo Th√∂dol

Guide us safely through the gates of death

IV. Paragons of Perfection

Nothing here will be the same
I'll see the world through different eyes and
I was given clarity
And the wisdom I can't deny

All that we can ever see
Until we leave this frail existence
Is just a shadow of reality
Death is not the final instance

It's not your time
You have to go back... back!
Now!

No, no, I don't want to return,
Please let me stay here, don't make me go back

Go back, you've got work to do

We're not alone, we are all one

Nothing here will be the same
The smallest bit is as big as nature
Our limited capacities
Gives us trouble to comprehend

We are linked in every way
And we're strong as our weakest fragment
Every word that we convey
Is an act with consequences

V. The Harsh Return

Misled by science
Our wake up call
Conditioning cannot fool us 'till the end

Light creates us all
Pride will make us fall
Life is meaningful
Life delights us all
Light creates us all
Pride divides us all
Life is meaningful
The soul survives us all

Greed will make us fall
Light will bind us all
