		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Topless models
Doin' semaphore
Wave their flags as she walks by
And get ignored
Illuminations
On a rainy day
When she walks, her footsteps sing
A reckless serenade

I've been tryna figure out exactly what it is I need
Called up to listen to the voice of reason
And got the answering machine

The type of kisses
Where teeth collide
When she laughs, the heavens hum
A stun gun lullaby
Those twinkling vixens
With the shining spiral eyes
Their hypnosis goes unnoticed
When she's walking by

I've been tryna figure out exactly what it is I need
Called up to listen to the voice of reason
And got his answering machine

I left my message
But did he fuck back to me
And now I'm stuck here wonderin'
How it's meant to be

Singin' a reckless serenade
Reckless serenade
Reckless serenade
Reckless serenade

Reckless serenade
Reckless serenade
Reckless serenade
