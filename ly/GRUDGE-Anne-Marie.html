		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you piss me off
Then I'll shrug it off
And I'll probably say I'm sorry with my fingers crossed
'Cause when I commit, I get away with it
You can tell me all your problems, I won't give a shit
Hmm

My therapist said keep calm and don't react
And the Bible says "Love thy enemy" and all that
And my friends all say that karma's gon' get me back
And I shouldn't hold a grudge

But I wanna (hahaha)
I really, really wanna
Hmm, yeah, I'm gonna (haha)
'Cause I really, really wanna

My list of names (ugh), running off the page
Yeah, I don't know why you even wanna play these games
Pay me compliments (ah), keep on groveling (uh)
'Cause I don't believe a word you say, so suck my dick

My therapist said keep calm and don't react
And the Bible says "Love thy enemy" and all that
And my friends all say that karma's gon' get me back
And I shouldn't hold a grudge

But I wanna (hahaha)
I really, really wanna
Hmm, yeah, I'm gonna (haha)
'Cause I really, really wanna

Said I wouldn't do this anymore
But I can't help it, I get bored
And it's the only thing that entertains me
I know that it isn't fine
Been looking for a reason why
And deep down I wish that I could just stop

But I wanna (hahaha)
I really, really wanna
Hmm, yeah, I'm gonna (haha, yeah, I'm gonna, bitch)
'Cause I really, really wanna (hahaha, don't fuck with me, bitch)
