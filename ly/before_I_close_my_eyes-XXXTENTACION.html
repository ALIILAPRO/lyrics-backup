		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Before I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord my soul to keep
I hope it's not too late for me, whoa
Before I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord my soul to keep
I hope it's not too late for me, whoa

Difference, changing in the distance
Time consumes the image, whoa
Difference, changing in the distance
Time consumes our image, whoa

Before I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord my soul to keep
I hope it's not too late for me, whoa
Before I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord my soul to keep
I hope it's not too late for me, whoa
