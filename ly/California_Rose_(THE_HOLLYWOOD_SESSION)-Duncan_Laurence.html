		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dug myself out of the deepest trenches
Several times my world has ended
But I still survive, I still get through
Burned my feet outrunning forest fires
Fell in love with outright liars
Nothing rips me up like loving you

I've had daisies so sweet
But no flower competes with my

Rose in California
Cut my hands every time I hold you
Had my heart ever since I've known you
California Rose
Rose in California
All my love to the place that bore you
Sunny skies with a chance of torture
California rose

I've gone down with ships, but I'm still swimming
Stolen from, but I'm still giving
Trust me when I say, "I've almost died"
Chewed up, spit out by volcanos
Tossed around by big tornados
Until you I swear I've never cried

(Oh, you're my)

Rose in California
Cut my hands every time I hold you
Had my heart ever since I've known you
California Rose
Rose in California
All my love to the place that bore you
Sunny skies with a chance of torture
California rose

California rose
California rose

Rose in California (oh)
Cut my hands every time I hold you
Had my heart ever since I've known you
California Rose
Rose in California (oh)
All my love to the place that bore you
Sunny skies with a chance of torture
California rose

California rose
California rose
