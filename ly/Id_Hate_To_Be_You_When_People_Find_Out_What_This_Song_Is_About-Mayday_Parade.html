		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And we both go down together
We'd stay there forever
Just try to get up
And I'm sorry
This wasn't easy
When I asked you, believe me
And never let go

Well I'm thinking of the worst things
That I could say to you
But a promise doesn't mean a thing, anymore
And this never will be right with me
And now you're trying desperately
But I'm tongue tied and terrified, of what I'll say

And then we both go down together
We may stay there forever
I'll just try to get up
And I'm sorry
But this wasn't easy
When I asked you, believe me
You never let go
But I let go

I could only sing you sad songs
And you could sing along
And you could see the melody
That's been calling out your wrongs
And this never will be right with me
And now you're trying desperately
But I'm tongue tied and terrified, of what I'll say
But I never told you everything
I'm losing hope and fading dreams
And every single memory along the way

And then we both go down together
We may stay there forever
I'll just try to get up
And I'm sorry
But this wasn't easy
When I asked you, believe me
You never let go
But I let go

And we both go down together
And stay there forever
Just try to get up

And then we both go down together
We may stay there forever
I'll just try to get up
And I'm sorry
But this wasn't easy
When I asked you, believe me
You never let go
But I let go
