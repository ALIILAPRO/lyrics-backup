		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The night is on and on
Your head rolling away
I catch it when it falls
And keep beneath my breath
So what have we become
More than a skin and bones
Oh what could beat this love
Exepte heroin

This is when we awake
This is where we don't ache

I see the sun
But it's never quite as close
As the only one and I
I can hardly wait

Oh give me sweet, sweet song
Oh give me what you take
Oh give me all that sleeps inside you
Give me what never awakes
So what have we become
More than a skin and bones
And when do we come down
I don't care at all

This is when we awake
This is where we don't ache

I see the sun
It's never quite as close
As the only one and I
I can hardly wait
I see the sun
It's never quite as close
As the only one and I
I can hardly wait
