		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, yeah
Hey, how's it going?
Can you meet me down on Adelaide street?
Can you talk for a moment
There's no way to say this that easily
And everything I said, I swear I meant it
I need to tell you that this isn't your fault
And I know that I'll probably regret it
And it kills me 'cause the worst part of all

It's that I hate to hurt you
But I got to be honest
I can't give you what you need, oh
You deserve more than I can promise
And I'm just tryna, I'm just tryna
Baby, I'm just tryna be honest, yeah
I'm tryna be honest with ya
You know that I'm sorry
But I'm tryna be honest with ya

Hey, can you listen?
I swear to God to you, there's nobody else
You're gonna say that I'm lyin'
When I tell you every feeling I felt
Was honest and sincere
And that you were different
And when we kissed I felt like that kid in love, yeah
And I know that I'll probably regret it
I might wish I never said this at all

Oh, I hate to hurt you
But I got to be honest
I can't give you what you need, oh
You deserve more than I can promise
And I'm just tryna, I'm just tryna
Baby, I'm just tryna be honest, yeah
I'm tryna be honest with ya
You know that I'm sorry
But I'm tryna be honest with ya

Oh, oh, oh
I don't wanna see you cry
Oh, oh, oh
Swear that I don't wanna see you cry

'Cause I hate I hurt you
But I gotta be honest
I can't give you what you need, oh
You deserve more than I can promise
And I'm just tryna, I'm just tryna
Baby, I'm just tryna be honest

I hate I hurt you
But I got to be honest
That I can't give you what you need, oh
You deserve more than I can promise
And I'm just tryna, I'm just tryna
Baby, I'm just tryna be honest
