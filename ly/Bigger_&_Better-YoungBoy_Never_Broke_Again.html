		  (Ayo, Bans, what you cooking?)
(It's Malik on the track)

Lay down while I'm deep off in my thoughts, I can barely sleep
Smoking cigarettes times I don't need, I can barely breathe
I'm fucked up 'bout your love, without me having it feel I'm weak
Fucked up with drugs 'cause it's the only thing I have when you leaving me
Pistol on side of me, groupies on side of me
Shit, I'm married and everything, this is all that I'll ever see
Up, I can barely see if you do or don't fuck with me
You forever up stalling out here, don't care 'bout what I achieve
And I notice that bitches I neglect treat me better when round
Having too much money still don't make nobody better
Damn, all these diamonds on me still don't make my body special
From that time being, you changed up on me, fuck that measure
Sun out, top down, stuntin' on these hoes, I'm goin' on 'bout my way
Clocked out, don't talk while I count my cake, bitch, I ain't got time to play

Ooh

What the fuck you got to lose?
Got the fame and got the money, I'm the one who sittin' here like a fool
Call her phone, I know she comin', but I neglect that bitch for you
What you discovered? Who you fuckin'? Why you actin' like that out the blue?
Come on, now, if I did you somethin', tell me now what the fuck I do
Hurtin' now, but I gotta crack a smile in front of my Mumu
Weight gain, I cut back off of pills, are you happy I improved?
So ashamed that I ain't never changed, but with this wan' be through
Eagles beek to the streets, so I know that all the hoes watching
Who love me? Who want me? Who need me?
Who here that won't mistreat me? I look around, see nobody
Fuck about who love, they don't know me
Bitch, I say show me a million dollars
I been laughing to the bank since I was sixteen
Fuck your mama, fuck your kids, and fuck your problems
It's on you to plan on stopping, I know you fucked up 'cause they motive
Nigga, stand the fuck up, they tryna leave, take the stick and blow they motor
Let them listen to all them bitches making statements like they know us
She was listenin' to them bitches 'cause they claimin' that they know somethin', they don't know us

I lay down while I'm deep off in my thoughts, I can barely sleep
Smoking cigarettes times I don't need, I can barely breathe
I'm fucked up 'bout your love, without me having it feel I'm weak
Fucked up with drugs 'cause it's the only thing I have when you leaving me
Pistol on side of me, groupies on side of me
Shit, I'm married and everything, this is all that I'll ever see
Up, I can barely see, if you do or don't fuck with me
You forever up stalling out here, don't care 'bout what I achieve
Sun out, top down, stuntin' on these hoes, I'm goin' on 'bout my way
Clocked out, don't talk while I count my cake, bitch, I ain't got time to play

Oh, yeah, yeah
