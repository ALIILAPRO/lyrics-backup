		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We're J.J. Fad and we're here to rock
Rhymes like ours could never be stopped
See, there's three of us and I know we're fresh
Party rockers, non-stoppers, and our names are def
See, the 'J' is for just, the other for jammin'
The 'F' is for fresh, 'A' and 'D' def
Behind the turntables is DJ Train
Mixin' and scratchin' is the name of the game
Now here's a little somethin' 'bout nosy people
It's not real hard, it's plain and simple
Baby-d

Supersonic
Supersonic

Supersonic motivating rhymes are creating
And everybody knows that J.J. Fad is devastating
We know you like us girls so you better get stirl
'Cause we are the homechicks that are rockin' your world

Supersonic
Supersonic

Supersonic is a word when people start to listen
Especially bigger people, they pay close attention
You might not believe it, you might not even buy it
But when it comes to our lady (Beat Box), you might even try it

Supersonic
Supersonic

Now all you supersonic people try to bite our rhyme
You may think that you are def, but you're way (S-s-so) behind
You better listen good to what we have to say
'Cause when it comes to J.J. Fad you can get no play

Supersonic
Supersonic

Now he's the freshest DJ from coast to coast
My man can cut and scratch, but I don't mean to boast
He may be a little light, but that's okay
'Cause when he cuts to the beat it sounds this way
Hit it

Supersonic
Supersonic

Uh, uh, uh, yeah, it's finally my turn to rock the mic
Because my devastating beats I know you will like
You see my beat box is fresh, it'll blow your mind
And if you don't like my beats I'll go big in your behind
(Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-uh-uh-ha)

Supersonic
Supersonic

Now you party people know what Supersonic means
We didn't try to brag 'cause J.J. Fad is just too clean
Now baby, don't you know that our rhymes are so bionic
Don't listen too hard, don't be Supersonic

Supersonic
Supersonic

You see, the 'S' is for super, and the 'you' is for unique
The 'P' is for perfection and you know that we are freaks
The 'E' is for exotic, and the 'are' is for raps
So tell those nosy people just to stay the hell back

Supersonic
Them big everlasting ears
Supersonic
They can hear what I say faster than I can say it
Supersonic
They better chill (Rock box)
It's like, it's like
She's Supersonic
You ran out of words

Hit it, Baby-D
I'm light-skinned, devastatin', I know one thing, he is heavy
That's right, 'cause doll, I'll take
I'll take your man and you made him
Always rappin', always clappin', everybody always say I'm happy
If you try to hang with me you should finally truly see

I'm always rockin', never stoppin', devastatin' rappin' lady
When I'm on the microphone it's either
Everybody say I'm different
There's no other angel lover, everybody know I'm covered
Clientele is a pearl, everybody know in jail
To the beat so you can tell everybody know your cell

A sama lama lama lama doo ma see ma nama lama doo ma lama nama see ma
Na ma lama doo ma lama see ma lama see ma doo ma humma, yeah (Yeah)
That's it (That's it)
