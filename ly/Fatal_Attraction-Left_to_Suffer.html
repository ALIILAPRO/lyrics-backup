		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All I know is I’m lost I the dark
Aggravated in here and you’re the only one who can find me 
You cut me open and you tell me that I’m not enough 
You say you love me while you’re pulling out a loaded gun 

Eviscerate the image in my fucking brain 
The mental pain of wasting all my days away 
I have no time left 
I guess this is as good as it gets 

I wish I could your whisper lays between the wood 
And not stuck in my goddamn head 
Why is the image haunting me in my sleep 
As if my mental state was a trophy that you could keep 

I was made to cast that judgment back 

It’s not as hard as it looks 
But you try to ruin me 
And you know you’re not justified 
When you’re not satisfied 
With the people that you’ve done wrong 

I know it’s something that we’re running from 
How much more of this can I take lately 

Now we’re standing face to face 
(We’re standing face to face) 
I know it’s easy to say when it’s over 
I scream into these burning lungs 
And now I’m left with the fatal attraction 

(But now we’re left with the fatal attraction)

Oh god! We’re all made to burn 
I wish you’d speak my every word 
You’re no better than the rest 
You’re a failure, even when you try your best 

I’m waking up in cold sweats 
Praying on bated breathe 
Only begging that you can take everything back 
But I know that’s just not how it works 
We fight to feel the pain just to feel something 
Oh 

Not a word out of your mouth 
But you try to ruin me 
And you know youre not justified for the people that you’ve done wrong 

(Now we’re standing face to face)

Now we’re standing face to face 
(We’re standing face to face) 
I know it’s easy to say when it’s over 
I scream into these burning lungs 
And now I’m left with the fatal attraction
