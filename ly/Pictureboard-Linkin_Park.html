		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I will be myself
Until it's time
For me to fly

And I will walk away
From this message on my board
I will walk away, yeah

You must be yourself
Until it's time
For us to fly

And I will walk away
From this message on my board
I will walk away, yeah

Night in the corner at the back of the hall
Where we sit all alone and listen to the rainfall
Night in the corner at the back of the hall
Where we sit all alone and listen to the rainfall
Night in the corner at the back of the hall
Where we sit all alone and listen to the rainfall
Night in the corner at the back of the hall
Where we sit all alone and listen to the rainfall
Calling from all sides, they surround all around
You can't see a thing, but you can hear the sounds (I will walk away)
Falling from the sky, upside-down
To the beat of heart as your whole head pounds (I will walk away)
Calling from all sides, they surround all around
You can't see a thing, but you can hear the sounds (I will walk away)
Falling from the sky, upside-down
To the beat of heart as your whole head pounds

I will be myself, yeah
And I will walk away
From this message on my board
I will walk away, yeah

The night in the corner at the back of the hall
Where we sit all alone and listen to the rainfall
Night in the corner at the back of the hall
Where we sit all alone and listen to the rainfall
Night in the corner at the back of the hall
Where we sit all alone and listen to the rainfall
The night in the corner at the back of the hall
Is where we sit all alone and listen to the rainfall
Night in the corner at the back of the hall
Where we sit all alone and listen to the rainfall
The night in the corner at the back of the hall
Where we sit all alone and listen to the rainfall
Night in the corner at the back of the hall
Where we sit all alone and listen to the rainfall
Night in the corner at the back of the hall
Where we sit all alone and listen to the rainfall
