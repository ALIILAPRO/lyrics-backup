		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  "I just want to set the world afire" 
Red flash clouds choking out the morning sky 
They said it'd never come, we knew it was a lie 
All forms of life die now, the humans all succumb 
Time to kiss your ass goodbye, the end has just begun 
Distorted figures walk the street, it's 1999 
Weeds once underneath the feet have grown to vines 
Bodies melted like a candle, a land without a face 
No time to change your fate, no time left, it's too late 
The arsenal of Megadeth can't be rid of they said 
And if it comes the living will envy the dead 
Racing for power and all come in last 
No winning, first stone cast 
This falsehood worldly peace 
Its treaties soon will cease 
No one will be left to prove that humans existed 
Maybe soon the children will be born open fisted 
We all live on one planet and it will all go up in smoke 
Too bad they couldn't see this lethal energy 
And now the final scene, a global darkening 
Dig deep the piles of rubble and ruin 
Towering overhead both far and wide 
There's unknown tools for World War III 
Einstein said, 'We'll use rocks on the other side' 
No survivors, set the world afire!
