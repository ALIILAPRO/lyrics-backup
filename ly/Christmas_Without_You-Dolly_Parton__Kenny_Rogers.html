		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Christmas without you
White Christmas and I'm blue
Like fireworks with no fuse
Christmas without you
The fireplace keeps burning and my thoughts keep turning
The pages of memories of time spent with you
Old Christmas songs we knew and used to make love to
Make it hard to get used to
Christmas without you

Christmas without you
White Christmas and I'm blue
I love you I miss you
So sad but so true
Christmas without you
Like a mystery with no clues
Like fireworks with no fuse
Christmas without you

The sweetest gift I know would be if the new snow
Could fall on your footsteps on this Christmas Eve
The most joyous Christmas if luck could be with us
Would be if Saint Nicholas brought you home to me

Christmas without you
White Christmas and I'm blue
I love you I miss you I need you
So sad but so true
Christmas without you, like a mystery with no clues
Like fireworks with no fuse
Christmas without you

Christmas without you
White Christmas and I'm blue
I love you I miss you
So sad but so true
Christmas without you, not something I can get used to
I just have no use
For Christmas without you

You know that I want you
You know that I need you
You know that I need you
You know that I want you

You know that I love you
I need you
I want you
Oh, yes I do!

You know that I want you
You know that I need you
You know that I need you
You know that I want you
