		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I never thought I would sleep so deep within the waves
You are the anchor that has kept me drowning

We can’t turn back time
I feel we’ve both crossed the line
But you, you gave up the fight for me
How hard did you try to keep
Me floating through your lies?

You walked away
There’s nothing I could say to make you stay
It rains all day but it’s okay
I’ll find my way
And if you want to speak, well it’s too late
It rains all day but it’s okay
It all gets washed away

How does it feel that seven years was all a waste?
Do you feel ashamed?
Do you feel the pain?

You know I’m not blind
I see the truth in your eyes
But you’re with him and not me
How hard will you try to keep
me floating through your lies?

You walked away
There’s nothing I could say to make you stay
It rains all day but it’s okay
I’ll find my way
And if you want to speak, well it’s too late
It rains all day but it’s okay
It all gets washed away

Take, take the time you waste away
Forget the fading memories
You’ll see, there’s nothing left
This is the end

You walked away
There’s nothing I could say to make you stay
It rains all day but it’s okay

You walked away
There’s nothing I could say to make you stay
It rains all day but it’s okay
I’ll find my way
And if you want to speak, well it’s too late
It rains all day but it’s okay
It all gets washed away
