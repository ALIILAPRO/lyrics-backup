		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  On a night like this
We been on a roll
Drop it low
They ain't gotta know
It's just you and I
For the night
We can take it slow
Won't pick up the phone
He's not home
They ain't gotta know
It's just you and I
For the night
Hop up in my zone
And slide on it
When I get you alone
Just ride on it
Hop up in my zone
And slide on it
We can take it slow
Spend some time on it

Hop up in the backseat
She go so bad for me
She gettin' nasty
Way too attached to me
Ride around the city
When it's late at night
Got ya by my side
Like the cash on me
Ride around the city
Then I'm taking flights
Am I coming home
No guarantee
So baby be bad for one night
Baby be bad for my whole life
Told her check my eyes when I roll light
Shawty caught a wave in the moonlight
Ride around the city
Like a rockstar
Put you in my zone
In my spotlight
Ride around the city
Like a cop car
Speedin' through the hills
Better act right

On a night like this
We been on a roll
Drop it low
They ain't gotta know
It's just you and I
For the night
We can take it slow
Won't pick up the phone
He's not home
They ain't gotta know
It's just you and I
For the night
Hop up in my zone
And slide on it
When I get you alone
Just ride on it
Hop up in my zone
And slide on it
We can take it slow
Spend some time on it
