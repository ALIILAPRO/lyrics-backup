		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Today's on fire
The sky is bleeding above me, and I am blistered
I walk these lines of blasphemy, every day
And still

Like a bad star, I'm falling faster down to her
She's the only one who knows, what it is to burn

I feel diseased
Is there no sympathy, from the sun
The sky's still fire
But I am safe in here, from the world outside

So tell me
What's the price to pay for glory

Like a bad star, I'm falling faster down to her
She's the only one who knows, what it is to burn

Today is fine, and she burns
Today is fine, and she burns
She burns

Like a bad star, I'm falling faster down to her
She's the only one who knows, what it is to burn
