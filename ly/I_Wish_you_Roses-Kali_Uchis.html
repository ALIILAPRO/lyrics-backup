		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh, never thought I would be without you
I wish you love, I wish you well
I wish you roses while you can still smell 'em
With pretty flowers can come the bee sting (ooh, never thought I would be without you)
But I wish you love, I wish you well
I wish you roses while you can still smell 'em

I was a rose in a garden of weeds
My petals are soft and silky as my sheets
So do not be afraid to get pricked by the thorns
While I'm here, I'm someone to honor
When I'm gone, I'm someone to mourn
But if you and my heart should someday drift apart
I'll make sure to give you these blessings because they're all I've got
My love's deep as the ocean, don't you drown on me
Just know, any love I gave you's forever yours to keep

Ooh, I wish you roses and roses and roses and roses and roses
I wish you roses, yeah, roses, roses
Ooh, I wish you roses and roses and roses and roses and roses
I wish you roses, yeah, roses, roses

Ooh, never thought I would be without you
I wish you love, I wish you well
I wish you roses while you can still smell 'em
With pretty flowers can come the bee sting (ooh, never thought I would be without you)
But I wish you love, I wish you well
I wish you roses while you can still smell 'em

Ooh, I wish you roses and roses and roses and roses and roses (I wish you roses)
I wish you roses, yeah, roses, roses (I wish you roses)
Ooh, I wish you roses and roses and roses and roses and roses
I wish you roses, yeah, roses, roses

Ooh, ooh

You're gonna want me back
You're gonna want me bad
You're gonna
You know we can't do that
You know we can't do that
You know we
