		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  As I lie awake

All the memories of my life

Seem to come and fade

Wakes me in the dead of night

Am I slipping away?

Is my memory leaving me?

When it's cold and dark,

Ghost of winter comes to me



Look at me

I'm eternal thought

It's a shame but we must part

It's just a dream

It's just a dream



Dreams that seem so real

Granny tells me it's o.k.

Won't you cry to sleep

You'll wake up to a brand new day



Tears to wake the dead

Tell them it's not all in vain

Since the dawn of man

Think how many felt the rain



It's far from what you know

But now I have to go

It's just a dream

It's just a dream



In the world, darkness follows me

Hiding out, in places I can't fee

I'll tell you one thing

I'll never change my ways

Fly high



Solo



I can't distinguish reality from dreams

Ghost of winter, won't you hear my silent scream?



Ghost of winter, won't you hear my silent scream?

Ghost of winter, return me to my dream



Repeat



You've showed me one thing

I've never, ever seen

So take me back there

I've got to have my dream



Oh, Ghost of Winter

Hear my silent scream

Fly high
