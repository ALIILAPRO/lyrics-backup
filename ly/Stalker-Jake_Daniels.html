		  Verse 1-

I don’t get problems, I’m just honest and you hate that don’t ya
You like to stare at me and watch so you can say I told ya

Pre chorus -

Whenever I, do something wrong
you always tell me that I’m a lost cause 
You look at my life, you pick it apart 
But what if I don’t give a

You make me feel like you’re a s-t-a-l-k-e-r

Chorus -

A stalker
You wanna watch my every move
You’re a stalker
You follow me home after school 
You got your notifications on
You watch my stories to get you off 
You’re a stalker
Yeah you’re a
S-t-a-L-k-e-r

Verse 2-

I don’t get why you always pick on me, you’re so annoying
You wanna tell me imma loser so you feel important

Pre chorus 2 -

Whenever I, do something wrong 
you always tell me that I’m a lost cause 
You look at my life, you pick it apart
