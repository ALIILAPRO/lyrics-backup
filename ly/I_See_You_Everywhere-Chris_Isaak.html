		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You've been telling everybody
How much you love me
But I don't know, I don't know
You throw your arms around me
Tell me that you missed me
Is that so, I don't know

[Chorus]
Cause I see you everywhere
And you're always on my mind
And I see you everywhere
No more crying now, no more crying

And I'm hoping that you want me
Like you've been saying but I don't know if it's so
When you put your arms around me
I close my eyes believing but is it so, baby I don't know
I see you everywhere
And you're always on my mind
And I see you everywhere
Baby, no more crying now

[Chorus]
