		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Your eyes opened wide
As I looked your way
Couldn't hide what
They meant to say
Feeling lost in
A crowded room
It's too soon for a new love
When you smile 
Your eyes show your heart
Lost inside a suit on a bar
Feeling alone with
People around
True love is hard to find now
You think you're
So misunderstood
I'd explain if only I could
Something tells me
This time it's real
The way that I feel

Your eyes like the blue
In the summer skies
Caught my gaze
As I looked across
Feeling lost in a magic maze
It's too soon for a new love
You can't hide that
Look in your eyes
Open wide you
Seem so surprised
Searching around
For somebody new
True love is hard to find now
When you smile your eyes
Show your heart
I feel mine is falling apart
Can't you see the
Way that I feel
My loving is real

When you're lost your eyes
Show you how
I should like to
Know I'm about
When your eyes shine
I know you're mine
For all of the time
