		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We're a thousand miles from comfort
We have traveled land and sea
But as long as you are with me
There's no place I'd rather be
I would wait forever
Exulted in the seam
But as long as I am with you
My heart continues to beat
With every step we take Kyoto to The Bay
Strolling so casually
We're different and the same
Gave you another name
Switch up the batteries

If you gave me a chance I would take it
It's a shot in the dark but I'll make it
Loaded gun of your heart, you can't shame me
When I am with you, there's no place I'd rather be

No, no, no, no, no, no place I'd rather be
No, no, no, no, no, no place I'd rather be
No, no, no, no, no, no place I'd rather be
When I am with you, there's no place I'd rather be

We set out on a mission
To find our inner peace
Make it everlasting
So nothing is incomplete
It's easy being with you
Sacred simplicity
As long as we're together
There's no place I'd rather be

With every step we take Kyoto to The Bay
Strolling so casually
We're different and the same
Gave you another name
Switch up the batteries

If you gave me a chance I would take it
It's a shot in the dark but I'll make it
Loaded gun of your heart, you can't shame me
When I am with you, there's no place I'd rather be

No, no, no, no, no, no place I'd rather be
No, no, no, no, no, no place I'd rather be
No, no, no, no, no, no place I'd rather be
When I am with you, there's no place I'd rather be

Yeah, yeah, yeah

If you gave me a chance, I would take it
It's a shot in the dark but I'll make it
Loaded gun of your heart, you can't shame me
When I am with you, there's no place I'd rather be

No, no, no, no, no, no place I'd rather be
No, no, no, no, no, no place I'd rather be
No, no, no, no, no, no place I'd rather be
When I am with you, there's no place I'd rather be
