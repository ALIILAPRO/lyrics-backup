		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'll be outside, underneath the balcony
Knew you was mine when you threw down the key
Up all night, tryin' all kinds of things (yeah)
Love of your life, you know that I'm tryna be

Daydreamin', when I met you, never met you
Kiss me, let me know that it's real
Daydreamin', when I met you, can't forget you
Kiss me, let me know that it's real

Girl, you're so fine, shinin' like a diamond ring
Look me in the eyes and tell me you would die for me
Bonnie and Clyde, like it's 2003 (yeah)
Love of your life, you know that I'm gotta be

Daydreamin', when I met you, never met you
Kiss me, let me know that it's real
Daydreamin', when I met you, can't forget you
Kiss me, let me know that it's real

Daydreamin', when I met you, never met you
Kiss me, let me know that it's real
Daydreamin', when I met you, can't forget you
Kiss me, let me know that it's real
