		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Was the one who wanted no strings
Now I'm tying us together
Tell myself I wouldn't feel things
If I labeled us whatever
But the way you put your clothes on
While you dancing in the mirror
Got me thinking it's been so long
Since I felt so fucking unwell

I've been losing sleep, I can't eat
I'm so weak, oh (oh)

I wasn't looking for this
Now I don't want this to end
Lying on the kitchen floor
Feeling all the side effects
I had it all together
Now you make me such a wreck
Lying on the kitchen floor
Feeling all the side effects

You're the kind of medication
Like it's taken off the shelf
Giving me these complications
You turn me into someone else

Now I'm losing sleep, I can't eat
I'm so weak, oh (oh)

I wasn't looking for this
Now I don't want this to end
Lying on the kitchen floor
Feeling all the side effects
I had it all together
Now you make me such a wreck
Lying on the kitchen floor
Feeling all the side effects

Oh, I'm feeling all the side effects
And it makes me sick and I try to quit
But I get so high
I get so high
Oh, I'm feeling all the side effects
And it makes me sick and I try to quit
But I get so high
I get so high

I don't want nobody else
It makes me sick
I don't wanna ask for help
I try to quit
But now I'm losing sleep, I can't eat
I'm so weak, oh (oh)

I wasn't looking for this
Now I don't want this to end
Lying on the kitchen floor
Feeling all the side effects
I had it all together
Now you make me such a wreck
Lying on the kitchen floor
Feeling all the side effects

Oh, I'm feeling all the side effects
And it makes me sick and I try to quit
But I get so high (but I get so high)
I get so high
Oh, I'm feeling all the side effects
And it makes me sick and I try to quit
But I get so high
I get so high
