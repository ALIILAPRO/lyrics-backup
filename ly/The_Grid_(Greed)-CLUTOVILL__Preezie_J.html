Trap Two Thou
Being black is hard
Getting rich when you black, has gotta be harder (it's fucked up)
God is the way, they don't follow the ladder
They rather spill blood for the BENZ than to jump OKADAS
To rep designers, SCAMMERS
But I'm not taking shots like in SARS style
Always mistake hairstyle for a lifestyle
You looking good they come in and throw your ass out
Oga shey we no go baff again?
Shey young rich niggas no fit pop champagne
Wear two Chains, hold Maryjane
Yeah I too dey complain
Bang bang he makes the bullet rain
(Hmm)
Owuwo, elegbe
I don't know what it means but I'm trending it (Dey plaay)
Shot at an unarmed body down, called it self defense
Funny how the life of the innocent doesn't cost a couple cents (Eeei)
But what's a Naira to a dollar now?
Deja vu on crisis, I don't feel bothered now
False preaching
Cultism
Money missing (Ahan)
That's a new one but fuck it gets to me (Uhh)
Sixty-three years, Happy Birthday!
But except for life, there's nothing to celebrate
Like let me break it down
You say you fight corruption
When I send five hundred k, you commot fifteen k from my account
Damn! That is invasion of privacy
Wish we dump the law and practice some humanity
Greed, corruption, bribery equals poverty
Let me pause if I play too much they send guns to come at me
I got dollars and gold
Dollars and gold see
I could buy a black mans soul, buy a black mans soul
I got dollars and gold
Dollars and gold
I could buy a black mans soul
Revolution on the road (we been coming Nigga)

When I finish school who gimme job?
When I no get food who gimme chop?
As I no get money for babe who gimme fuck?
So no look me like terrorist if I dey bomb
It's only a matter of time before all the youths go join too
Hunger dey and as I can't beat them what am I gon' do?
Reason why we get yahoo boy wey go law school
Reason why we got 16yr olds yelling fuck school
Fuck you!
I no kill anybody, I dey my house dey hustle
I no need wear mask, nothing wey I use gun do
So officer you say, what you want use that gun do?
We are very sorry for the protests o
End SARS or we lazy youths we no go rest o
Buhari, we see the change and the progress o
Do your 8 years finish make you go rest o
See problem o
Emi lokan say na him must to go next o
If na pesin wey dey do us, make we go beg o
'Cause we no go need to die before we go hell
Bad!

Coming to a brother
Cuz you're running from another
Don't try call me your lover, only one that love is my mother
They make you cry, you run to me
I make you smile, you run from me
Girl tell me do you love me or you just want my company
Power to the people like say na ELECTION
But I rig am ooo, like na my NATION
Too many offenders
Too many pretenders
They don't know repentance
God show them VENGEANCE
Too many offenders
Too many pretenders
God show them VENGEANCE
They don't know repentance
