		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Drop top Porsche, Rollie on my wrist
Diamonds up and down my chain (ha ha)
Cardi B, straight stuntin', can't tell me nothin'
Bossed up and I changed the game (you see me)
It's my big Bronx boogie, got all them girls shook
My big, fat ass got all them boys hooked
I went from dollar bills, now we poppin' rubber bands
Bruno sang to me while I do my money dance like
Ayy, flexin' on the 'Gram like (ayy)
Hit the Lil Jon, okay (okay), okay (okay)
Oh, yeah we drippin' in finesse and getting paid (ow)

Ooh, don't we look good together?
There's a reason why they watch all night long (all night long)
Yeah, I know we'll turn heads forever
So tonight I'm gonna show you off

When I'm walkin' with you (when I'm walkin' with you)
I watch the whole room change (I watch the whole room change)
Baby, that's what you do (baby, that's what you do)
No, my baby don't play (no)
Blame it on my confidence
Or blame it on your measurements
Shut that shit down on sight
That's right

We out here drippin' in finesse
It don't make no sense
Out here drippin' in finesse
You know it, you know
We out here drippin' in finesse
It don't make no sense
Out here drippin' in finesse
You know it, you know it

Now slow it down for me baby (slow it down, girl)
'Cause I love the way it feels when we grind (when we grind)
Yeah, our connection's so magnetic on the floor
Nothing can stop us tonight

When I'm walkin' with you (when I'm walkin' with you)
I watch the whole room change (I watch the whole room change)
Baby, that's what you do (baby, that's what you do)
No, my baby don't play (no)
Blame it on my confidence
Or blame it on your measurements
Shut that shit down on sight
That's right

We out here drippin' in finesse
It don't make no sense
Out here drippin' in finesse
You know it, you know
We out here drippin' in finesse
It don't make no sense
Out here drippin' in finesse
You know it, you know it

Fellas, grab your ladies if your lady fine
Tell her she the one, she the one for life
Ladies, grab your fellas and let's do this right
If you're on one like me and mine
Yeah, we got it goin' on, got it goin' on
Don't it feel so good to be us, ayy?
Yeah, we got it goin' on, got it goin' on (yeah)
Girl, we got it goin' on
Yeah, we got it goin' on, got it goin' on (hey)
Don't it feel so good to be us, ayy? (It feels so good to be you)
Yeah, we got it goin' on, got it goin' on

We out here drippin' in finesse (we drippin' on 'em)
It don't make no sense
Out here drippin' in finesse
You know it, you know it
We out here drippin' in finesse (drippin' in finesse with my baby)
It don't make no sense
Out here drippin' in finesse
You know it, you know it

Girl, you know we got it goin' on
Yeah, we got it goin' on, got it goin' on
Don't it feel so good to be us, ayy?
Yeah, we got it goin' on, got it goin' on
You know it, you know it
Yeah, we got it goin' on, got it goin' on (girl, we got it)
Don't it feel so good to be us, ayy?
Yeah, we got it goin' on, got it goin' on
You know it, you know it
