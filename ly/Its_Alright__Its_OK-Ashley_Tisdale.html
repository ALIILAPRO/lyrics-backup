		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You told me
There's no need
To talk it out
Cause it's too late
To proceed
And slowly
I took your words
And walked away

No looking back
I wont regret, no
I will find my way
I'm broken
But still I have to say

It's alright, okay
I'm so much better without you
I wont be sorry
Alright, okay
So don't you bother what I do
No matter what you say
I wont return
Our bridge has burned down
I'm stronger now
Alright, okay
I'm so much better without you
I wont be sorry

You played me
Betrayed me
Your love was nothing but a game
Portrait a role
You took control, I
I couldn't help but fall
So deep
But now I see things clear

It's alright, okay
I'm so much better without you
I wont be sorry
Alright, okay
So don't you bother what I do
No matter what you say
I wont return
Our bridge has burned down
I'm stronger now
Alright, okay
I'm so much better without you
I wont be sorry

Don't waist your fiction tears on me
Just save them for someone in need
It's way to late
I'm closing the door

It's alright, okay
I'm so much better without you
I wont be sorry
Alright, okay
So don't you bother what I do (yeah)
No matter what you say
I wont return
Our bridge has burned down
I'm stronger now
Alright, okay
I'm so much better without you (I'm better without you)
I wont be sorry

It's alright, okay
Alright, okay
Without you
No matter what you say
It's alright, okay
Alright, okay
Without you
I won't be sorry
