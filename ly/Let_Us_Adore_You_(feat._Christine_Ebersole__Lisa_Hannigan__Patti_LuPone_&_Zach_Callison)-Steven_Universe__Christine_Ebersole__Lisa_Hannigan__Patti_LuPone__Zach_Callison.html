		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Come live with us in the palace
There's a room waiting for you
Come on, come on, come on
Just let us adore you

(You guys have really gotten better at showing affection)
(But I've got my own life to get back to)
(Don't forget, I'm not Pink Diamond)

Yes, we know that you're not her but you were hers
You know what it meant to love her
And you remind us so much of her

(Thanks, but I really gotta go)
But Steven
I've disbanded my armies, I've liberated my colonies
I never shattered, I'd never make anyone cry
I've been saying "please" and "thank you," even to lower life-forms
(What did we talk about?)
Ugh, equal life-forms
Steven, we've done everything you've asked
(That's great, good job, keep it up, bye)
