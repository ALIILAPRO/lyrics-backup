		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Right now
Well it's finally time to face my fears
Gonna get the hell out of here
And create a fresher atmosphere
But the consequences clear

There's a furnace set on high
And the yearning undefyed
But it's time to turn the tide
It's social suicide

Like you
Perseverance is a useless tool
Just a patron on a ship of fools
Painting interest in the cast and crew
Why you've broken every single rule

There's a furnace set on high
And the yearning undefyed
But it's time to turn the tide
It's social suicide

Shadows entertain me
I don't want it masses
Shadows explain their known reactions
I don't even know if I can ever find truth
But I'm sure it won't come from far away

There's a furnace set on high
And the yearning undefied
But it's time to turn the tide
It's social suicide
