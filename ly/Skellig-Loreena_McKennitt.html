		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  O light the candle, John
The daylight has almost gone
The birds have sung their last
The bells call all to mass

Sit here by my side
For the night is very long
There's something I must tell 
Before I pass along

I joined the brotherhood my books were all to me
I scribed the words of God 
And much of history

Many a year was I 
Perched out upon the sea
The waves would wash my tears
The wind, my memory

I'd hear the ocean breathe
Exhale upon the shore
I knew the tempest's blood 
Its wrath I would endure

And so the years went by
Within my rocky cell
With only a mouse or bird
My friends I loved them well

And so it came to pass
I'd come here to Romani
And many a year it took
'Till I arrived here with thee

On dusty roads I walked
And over mountains high
Through rivers running deep
Beneath the endless sky

Beneath these jasmine flowers
Amidst these cypress trees
I give you now my books
And all their mysteries

Now take the hourglass
And turn it on its head
For when the sands are still
'Tis then you'll find me dead

O light the candle, John
The daylight is almost gone
The birds have sung their last
The bells call all to mass
