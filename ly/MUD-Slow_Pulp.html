		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't know what I'm still doing here
Yet another full moon that I missed this year
Do you miss me, dear?
Can't be this alone and stay so clear
Wanna be an astronaut and get out of here
'Cause I miss you, dear
So be honest

Are you not where you said that you've been
Getting older, but I still play pretend
I don't want this to end
I don't want this

I can tell that there's someone else
C'mon, tell me
I can take it well
It's just too bad I fell
I'll be honest

I know I'm not where I said that I've been
Getting older, but I still play pretend
I don't want this to end
I'm stuck in it again
Again, again, again, again, again, again, again

Again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again
Again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again
Again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again
Again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again

Are you not where you've said that you've been?
Getting older, but I still play pretend
I don't want this to end
I don't want this to end
I don't want this to end
No, I don't want this
