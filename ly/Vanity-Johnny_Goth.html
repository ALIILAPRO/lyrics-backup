		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Goodbye morning rose
Hello vanity 
Curse that pretty song 
That put you in this sleep 
Girl says she wants to die
You wanna know but you won't ask why 
She laughs at broken bones 
You think she's cool but she's all alone 

Walking on our own
We'll find a hole to call a home 
I don't want to go 
But our time is running low 

Eyes will pierce a hole 
Through your skin and your jet black soul 

Goodbye morning rose, hello vanity 
Curse that pretty song that put you in this sleep
