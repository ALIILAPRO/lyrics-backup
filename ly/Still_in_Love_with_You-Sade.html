		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Think I'll fall to pieces
If I don't find something else to do
This sadness it never ceases
Oh I'm still in love with you

My head, it keeps on reeling
It's got me in a crazy spin
Darling, darling, darling
Is this the end?

Still in love with you

They say time has a way of healing
Dries all the tears from your eyes
But darling it's this empty feeling
My heart can't disguise

After all that we've been through
I try my best but it's no use
I guess I'll just keep on loving you
Is this the end?

Still in love with you

Still in love with you

Now that it's all over, boy
There's something I think you should know
Baby, baby, think it over
Just one more time before you go

Call on me baby
If there's anything I can do for you
Please call on me baby
Help me see it through

Still in love with you
Still in love with you
Still in love with you
