		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One, two, three

Somebody save me
Me from myself
I've spent so long
Living in hell
They say my lifestyle is bad for my health
It's the only thing that seems to help

All of this drinking and smoking is hopeless 
but feel like it's all that I need
Something inside of me's broken 
I hold onto anything that sets me free

I'm a lost cause
Baby, don't waste your time on me
I'm so damaged beyond repair
Life has shattered my hopes and my dreams
I'm a lost cause
Baby, don't waste your time on me
I'm so damaged beyond repair
Life has shattered my hopes and my dreams

Ooh, ooh, ooh

What if the night sky
Was missing the moon?
And there were no shooting stars to use wishing on you
And all of my sorrows
I just wash them down
It's the only peace I've ever found

All of this drinking and smoking is hopeless 
but feel like it's all that I need
Something inside of me's broken 
I hold onto anything that sets me free

I'm a lost cause
Baby, don't waste your time on me
I'm so damaged beyond repair
Life has shattered my hopes and my dreams
I'm a lost cause
Baby, don't waste your time on me
I'm so damaged beyond repair
Life has shattered my hopes and my dreams

Ooh, ooh, ooh
