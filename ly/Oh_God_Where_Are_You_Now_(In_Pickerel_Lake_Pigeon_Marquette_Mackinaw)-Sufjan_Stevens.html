		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh God hold me now.
Oh Lord hold me now.
There's no other man
who could raise the dead.
So do what you can
to anoint my head.

Oh God, where are you now?
Oh Lord save somehow.
The Devil is hard on my face again.
The world is a hundred to one again.

Would the righteous still remain?
Would  my body stay the same?

Oh God hold me now.
Oh God touch me now.
There's no other man
who could save the dead.
There's no other garden
to place our head.

Would the righteous still remain?
Would my body stay the same?

There's no other man
who could raise the dead.
So do what you can
to anoint my head.
Oh God hold me now.
Oh Lord touch me now.
