		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
What I had to do, had to run from you
I'm in love with you, but the vibe is wrong
And that haunted me, all the way home
So you never know, never, never know
Never know enough, 'til it's over love
'Til we lose control, system overload
Screaming, "No, no, no, no-no"
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
See I wanna move, but can't escape from you
So I keep it low, keep a secret code
So everybody else don't have to know

So keep your love lockdown, your love lockdown
Keeping your love lockdown, your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown, your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown, you lose

I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
I can't keep my cool, so I keep it true
I got something to lose, so I gotta move
I can't keep myself, and still keep you too
So I keep in mind, when I'm on my own
Somewhere far from home, in the danger zone
How many times did I tell you 'fore it finally got through?
You lose, you lose
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
See I had to go, see I had to move
No more wasting time, you can't wait for life
We're just racing time, where's the finish line?

So keep your love lockdown, your love lockdown
Keeping your love lockdown, your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown, your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown, you lose

I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
I bet no one knew, I got no one new
Know I said I'm through, but got love for you
But I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
Gotta keep it going, keep the loving going
Keep it on a roll, only God knows
If I'll be with you, baby, I'm confused
You choose, you choose
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
Way I wanna go, I don't need you
I been down this road too many times before
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to

So keep your love lockdown, your love lockdown
Keeping your love lockdown, your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown, your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown, you lose

You lose
You lose
You lose
You lose
