		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Think of all the things we've done and now
You've decided I'm not the one
A love like ours just can't go on
Run away baby have your fun but

I, I, I, I, don't want to hurt you I don't want to see you cry
I, I, I, I, just want to hold your love tonight
You owe me some kind of love

I don't want to see you sad I don't want you
Feeling down I only want you to say you love me and you need me
The way I love ya please believe me

I, I, I, I, don't want to hurt you I don't want to see you cry
I, I, I, I, just want to hold you love tonight
You owe me some kind of love
You owe me some kind of love

Think of all the things we've done and now
You've decided I'm not the one
A love like ours just can't go on
Run away baby have your fun but

I, I, I, I, don't want to hurt you I don't want to see you cry
I, I, I, I, just want you back I don't want to fight
I, I, I, I, just want to hold you love tonight
You owe me some kind of love
You owe me some kind of love
