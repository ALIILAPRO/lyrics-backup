		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're preaching to the choir
Stop hating on yourself
Quit playing with your mind
You're spinning
If you think that I'm a liar
Just try it for yourself
The clouds will open up
Blue skies are willing

Yeah, I know 
It's so hard to throw away
The clouds will open up
Blue skies are willing

Back on your feet again
Lift your head, hold it high
You wanna run it back
But you can't turn the time
You start to feel like you're losing your shine
But the grass ain't always greener on the other side

The other side
Got you stuck in your mind
You start to 
Feel like you're losing your shine
But the grass ain't always greener on the other side

Hey you
Stop stressing 'bout what you're missing
So blue
Just take it easy, take your time, if
You think my words are wise
Just try it for yourself
I promise the stars will light the path you walk
Don't give in

Got a heart of gold
What a shame to go to waste
The clouds will open up
Blue skies are willing

Back on your feet again
Lift your head, hold it high
You wanna run it back
But you can't turn the time
You start to feel like you're losing your shine
But the grass ain't always greener on the other side

The other side
(Feet again, lift your head, hold it high)
Got you stuck in your mind
(Run it back, but you can't turn the time)
You start to 
Feel like you're losing your shine
But the grass ain't always greener on the other side

Just take it from me, you'll be okay
'Cause it don't matter how sweet it taste
The grass ain't green, don't worry
Losing sleep, still want to 
Get, yeah, you get

Back on your feet again
Lift your head, hold it high
You wanna run it back
But you can't turn the time
You start to feel like you're losing your shine
But the grass ain't always greener on the other side

You start to feel like you're losing your shine
But the grass ain't always greener on the other side
