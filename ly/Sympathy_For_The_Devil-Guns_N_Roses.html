		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Please allow me to introduce myself 
I'm a man of wealth and taste 
I've been around for a long, long year 
Stole many a man's soul and faith 

And I was 'round when Jesus Christ 
Had his moment of doubt and pain 
Made damn sure that Pilate 
Washed his hands and sealed his fate 

Pleased to meet you 
Hope you guess my name 
But what's puzzling you 
Is the nature of my game 

I stuck around St. Petersberg 
When I saw it was a time for a change 
I killed the Czar and his ministers 
Anastasia screamed in vain 

I rode a tank 
Held a general's rank 
When the Blitzkrieg raged 
And the bodies stank 

Pleased to meet you 
Hope you guess my name, oh yeah 
What's puzzling you is the nature of my game, oh yeah 

I watched with glee as your kings and queens 
Fought for ten decades 
For the Gods they made 

I shouted out 
"Who killed the Kennedy?" 
When after all 
It was you and me 

So let me please introduce myself 
I'm a man of wealth and taste 
And I laid traps for troubadours 
Who get killed before they reached Bombay 

Pleased to meet you 
Hope you guessed my name, oh yeah 
But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game, oh yeah

Pleased to meet you 
Hope you guessed my name, oh yeah 
But what's puzzling you is just the nature of my game 

Just as every cop is a criminal 
And all the sinners saints 
As heads is tails just call me Lucifer 
'Cause I'm in need of some restraint 

So if you meet me 
Have some courtesy 
Have some sympathy, and some taste 
Use all your well-learned politesse?
Or I'll lay your soul to waste, um yeah 

Pleased to meet you 
Hope you guessed my name, oh yeah 
But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game, oh baby 

Oh yeah
Tell me baby, what's my name 
Oh tell me honey, can you guess my name?
Oh oh oh oh
Tell me honey, what's my name 
Oh, just the sweetest, tell me what's my name?
Tell me, sweetie, what's my name 
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

(Oh oh oh)

Can papa get a holler now?
