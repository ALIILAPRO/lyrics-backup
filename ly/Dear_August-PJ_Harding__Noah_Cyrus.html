		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mmm, mmm-mmm, mmm

Slowly, why's the morning come so slowly
When I got no one to hold me through the dark?
Patient, they tell me that love is patient
But it never wants to wait on my drunk heart

So I'll take all of my, all of my, all of my wasted love
And turn it into wine, into wine, into wine in my cup, woah

Dear August, tell me that there's light
At the end of all this starless night
Dear August, please don't let me fall
'Cause I don't know where this road is headed anymore

Fading, now the summer heat is fading
I spend every evening praying for the dawn
Save me, looking for someone to save me
Give me everything you gave me, but you're scorned

So I'll take all of my, all of my, all of my wasted love
And turn it into wine, into wine, into wine in my cup, woah

Dear August, tell me that there's light
At the end of all this starless night (oh)
Dear August, please don't let me fall
'Cause I don't know where this road is headed anymore, oh

Oh, dear August (oh)
Oh-oh-oh-oh, August
Oh, no, no, dear August (oh)
Oh-oh-oh-oh, August
Ah-ah, ah-ah

Dear August, tell me that there's light
At the end of all this starless night
Dear August, please don't let me fall
'Cause I don't know where this road is headed anymore
