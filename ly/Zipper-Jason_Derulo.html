		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'ma mark my territory
Shawty I'm an animal, slowly digging in to you
Spread you like a bad story
Turn you to a criminal, let me see you cock it back
Bang bang bang on it
'Til the head board break
Make me think that I wanna put a ring on you
But first I'll make you sign for me
And all the ladies say

I wanna ride
I wanna ride
Up and down like a zipper
Zipper, zipper, zipper
Up and down like a zipper
Zipper, zipper, zipper

I could be sweet, lady
Or eat it like a cannibal
Go places that your man can't go
In my back seat baby
You're smoking like some good good
Once I hit that good good
Make me beg beg for it
Mama taught you well
'Cause it ain't about booty but the brain baby
Now let me hear you sing to me
And all the ladies say

I wanna ride
I wanna ride
Up and down like a zipper
Zipper, zipper, zipper
Up and down like a zipper
Zipper, zipper, zipper

She like wearing my snap backs
She got that snap back
So if I ever wanna leave
I'll be right back
Ooh girl
I need it
Ooh girl
Got me fiending
You a 'go' girl
I'll never go girl
'Cause when you surfing in my bed
I'll be like go girl
Ooh girl
I need it
Ooh girl
Got me fiending

I wanna ride
I wanna ride
Up and down like a zipper
Zipper, zipper, zipper
Up and down like a zipper
Zipper, zipper, zipper
