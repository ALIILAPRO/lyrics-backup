		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Try, try to look a little older
So I can go
Down to the bar, there's someone waiting
To take me home
I can't take it, all the damage done
Wanna sink into oblivion
Could be anything or anyone
Anyone at all
He said,""Love that you're 15""
Ten shots of whiskey he brought to my bedside
Said,""Now you'll be alright""
When I was 15, I thought no one would miss me
They're all just pretending, so I wrote the ending
When they say that it's not that bad
You're too young to be this sad
Makes you wanna do something that you can't take back
And be forever 15
Would you have missed me at all?
Walk down the halls a little slower
So nobody knows
Oh, hold, hold my head a little lower
Just want to let it go
I can't take it, all the damage done
Wanna sink into oblivion
Could be anything or anyone
Anyone at all
He said,""Love that you're 15""
Ten shots of whiskey he brought to my bedside
Said,""Now you'll be alright""
When I was 15, I thought no one would miss me
They're all just pretending, so I wrote the ending
When they say that it's not that bad
You're too young to be this sad
Makes you wanna do something that you can't take back
And be forever 15
Would you have missed me at all?
Ophelia, think I see ya underwater
Ophelia, think I see ya underwater
He said,""Love that you're 15""
Ten shots of whiskey he brought to my bedside
Said,""Now you'll be alright""
When I was 15, I thought no one would miss me
They're all just pretending, so I wrote the ending
When they say that it's not that bad
You're too young to be this sad
Makes you wanna do something that you can't take back
And be forever 15
Would you have missed me at all?
