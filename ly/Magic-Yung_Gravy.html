		  Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
It's Jason Rich, baby
Oh, baby

Gravy get near, your bitch disappear, I call that shit magic (whoa)
She was your B, now she with me, ain't that shit tragic? (Baby)
Gravy get close, you get comatose, that shit automatic (whoa)
I'm catchin' spells, you takin' L's, shit is fantastic

Pull up on a bitch and get steamy
Think I'm Houdini, lookin' like a genie (ayy)
Got that sauce, Fettuccine, Gravy so creamy, wrist so gleamy (ayy)
Shit, I'm in it, eatin' that goddamn spinach
What a bad bitch, she finished
Gravy get near, your career get finished

I'm like open sesame, now your bitch right next to me
Pipe up, that's my destiny, call that shit finnessery, baby
Ooh, that's a flex, do a little trick, now your bitch is your ex
Heard my voice, now she tryna have s- (whoa)
Flexin' on ya too complex, baby

Ala-ka-fuckin-zam
I'm like, "Bitch, who is your mans?"
Abracadabra with these hands
Hit your bitch with the shazam

Gravy get near, your bitch disappear, I call that shit magic (whoa)
She was your B, now she with me, ain't that shit tragic? (Baby)
Gravy get close, you get comatose, that shit automatic (whoa)
I'm catchin' spells, you takin' L's, shit is fantastic

Pull up on a bitch and get steamy
Think I'm Houdini, lookin' like a genie, baby
Got that sauce, Tortellini, Gravy so creamy, wrist so gleamy (ayy)
Shit, I'm in it, eatin' that goddamn spinach
What a bad bitch, she finished
Gravy gettin' near, your career get finished

I'm so sorry that I had to end it
Gravy served it up, like I'm playin' fuckin' tennis
2018, I'll be runnin' for the Senate
Gravy took your bitch, that's a fuckin' epidemic (crazy)
Hear the bird call, and your bitch come hither
Your bitch in my line, and the goods get delivered
Pull up and I splash like a motherfuckin' river
Wrist so cold, make a grown man shiver

Gravy get near, your bitch disappear, I call that shit magic (whoa)
She was your B, now she with me, ain't that shit tragic? (Baby)
Gravy get close, you get comatose, that shit automatic (whoa)
I'm catchin' spells, you takin' L's, shit is fantastic
Bum-bum-bum-bum, bum-bum-bum-bum
