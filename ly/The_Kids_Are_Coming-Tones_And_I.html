		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No one wants to listen to the kids these days, yeah
The fibs these days, yeah
They say that we're all the same
But they're the ones to blame
Speaking of the young as if we killed someone
But we don't need your guns
We're all too busy on the run
Tryna be someone

The kids are comin'
The kids are gunnin'
The kids are runnin'
The kids are comin'
The kids are comin'
The kids are gunnin'
The kids are runnin'
The kids are comin' for you

No one seems to understand the kids these days
And why we live this way
We got to clean up the mess you've made
Still you don't wanna change
You create the law but can't control our thoughts
And no, we won't be bought
We don't just protest for the fun
We're here to get it done

The kids are comin'
The kids are gunnin'
The kids are runnin'
The kids are comin'
The kids are comin'
The kids are gunnin'
The kids are runnin'
The kids are comin' for you

Now you've gone and done it and we locked you in the basement
Marching through the streets is not the only way to change things
Now you've gone and done it and we locked you in the basement
Marching through the streets is not the only way to change things

This never would've happened when I was a boy
You kids these days and your millennium items
And your card games
And your loud music
And your hula hoops
And your hopscotch
And your dungarees
And your lollipops
And your Sony Playstations and your

The kids are comin'
The kids are gunnin'
The kids are runnin'
The kids are comin'
The kids are comin' for you
