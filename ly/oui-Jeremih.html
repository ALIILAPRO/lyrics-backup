		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah (yeah)
Ah-ah, ah-ah (yeah)
Ah-ah, ah-ah (yeah)
Ah-ah, ah-ah (yeah)
Ah-ah, ah-ah (yeah)
Ah-ah, ah-ah (yeah)
Ah-ah

I think about all the time
Think you may need (what?) all of mine
Hate to say you know that love is blind
I'm 'bout to see, I'll close my eyes
(Truth is) they can't see you in here though
Most of them need dollar signs to make
Every day your birthday
And every night your valentine

If we (we) tried that, we could be (in love)
Somewhere and the climate is warm, long as you around me
I swear that everything'll be just fine (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I wish that we could take some time (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Go anywhere, baby, I don't mind (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Grown man in my suit and tie (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Hey, there's no we without you and I
Ah, yeah, ah, yeah, ah-ah, yeah
Hey, there's no we without you and I
Ah, yeah, ah, yeah, ah-ah, yeah
Hey, there's no we without you and I

See my baby know, where my baby go, I go
It's no better feeling, you know
When I'm next to her, for sure
It's like, ah-ah
They know they hate, get this off my chest
Ah, damn, I know I love you, I swear your shit the best
Friends, they know they hate, get that off my chest
Ah, yeah, I think I love you, oh, baby, maybe we

If we (we) tried that, we could be (in love)
Somewhere and the climate is warm, long as you around me
I swear that everything'll be just fine (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I wish that we could take some time (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Go anywhere, baby, I don't mind (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Grown man in my suit and tie (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Hey, there's no we without you and I
Ah, yeah, ah, yeah, ah-ah, yeah
Hey, there's no we without you and I
Ah, yeah, ah, yeah, ah-ah, yeah
Hey, there's no we without you and I

Ooh, da-da, do-do-do
Ooh, da-da, do-do-do
Ooh, da-da, do-do-do
Ooh, da-da, do-do-do

If we (we) tried that, we could be (in love)
Somewhere and the climate is warm, long as you around me
I swear that everything'll be just fine (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I wish that we could take some time (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Go anywhere, baby, I don't mind (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Grown man in my suit and tie (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Hey, there's no we without you and I
Ah, yeah, ah, yeah, ah-ah, yeah
Hey, there's no we without you and I
Ah, yeah, ah, yeah, ah-ah, yeah
Hey, there's no we without you and I
