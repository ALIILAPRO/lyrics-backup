		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When the lights go out
Will you take me with you
And carry all this broken bone
Through six years down in crowded rooms
And highways I call home?
Something I can't know 'til now
'Til you pick me off the ground
With a brick in hand, your lip-gloss smile
Your scraped-up knees

And if you stay, I would even wait all night
Or until my heart explodes
How long?
'Til we find our way in the dark and out of harm
You can run away with me anytime you want

Terrified of what I'd be
As a kid from what I've seen
Every single day when people try
And put the pieces back together
Just to smash them down
Turn my headphones up real loud
I don't think I need them now
'Cause you stopped the noise

And if you stay I would even wait all night
Or until my heart explodes
How long?
'Til we find our way in the dark and out of harm
You can run away with me anytime you want

Well, anytime you want
Well, anytime you want

Don't walk away
Don't walk away
Don't walk away
Don't walk away

'Cause if you stay I would even wait all night
Or until my heart explodes
How long?
Until we find our way in the dark and out of harm
You can run away with me
You can write it on your arm
You can run away with me anytime you want
