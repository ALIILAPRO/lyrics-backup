		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You never told me where you came from
You never told me your name
I didn't know if you were legal tender
But I spent it just the same
And I didn't know it could happen to me
But I fell in love in the first degree

It was love at first feel
Love at first feel
Love at first feel
First touch was too much

They told me it was disgustin'
They told me it was a sin
They saw me knocking on your front door
Saw me smile when you let me in
You and me baby we'ez all alone
Let's get something goin'
While your mum and dad ain't home

Love at first feel
It was love at first feel, that's why they said
Love at first feel
Feels good just like I knew it would

Love at first feel
Love at first feel
Love at first feel
Love at first feel
Love at first feel
Love at first feel
Love at first feel
Love at first feel
Love at first feel
Love at first feel
Love at first feel
Love at first feel
Love at first feel
Love at first feel
