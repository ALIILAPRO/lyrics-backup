		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  OG Parker

All the words you said out your mouth, I thought you was true with it
I was down bad on my dick, felt like you was cool with it
You even chopped me on some grams, ain't know what to do with it
You said you pulled up on that car and you had blew in it
Your secret safe with me
My brother for eternity
Fake love, ain't wasting energy
Said you'd take a picture with the enemies

We was fucked up, splittin' Mickey D's
Ridin' in that Nissan, hopin' for some Bentley keys
I was tellin' you about my problems with my kids and niece
I ain't have no time for 'em, but I did for the streets
And I ain't gon' brag on what I did for the streets
I say I won't tell a soul what I did for the streets
Better keep your mouth closed what I did for the streets
Go up fifty a show, dropped Signed to the Streets

Rather fall out with my bitch then fall out with my brothers
Feel like we blood brothers, call each other mamas mamas
They knew we was sellin' drugs, they told us hope we save for college
Fuckin' hoes raw dog, and we paid for condoms
Niggas said they gon' snake us after, shit, we playin' defense
Niggas who don't come 'round here came around but we had stayed and sneak diss
They say you ain't really got my back, don't know how I ain't peep it
Sometimes I went outside without it, you had told me keep it
Whole time these niggas who was trill, you told me they was sneaky
Lowkey I told them niggas fuck 'em, lowkey I was tweakin'
You who you is today, you got clout from me
Niggas lowkey in the way, streets can vouch for me

Sometimes I feel like ten your niggas will bust my brain, you hear me?
Like for that paper, for this clout shit, like
Know what I'm sayin', that shit bring disloyalty
Know what I'm sayin', I ain't gon' lie
I'd rather take myself out 'fore I let an opp
Or a nigga I call my brother
Know what I'm sayin', take me out this shit, like
Like if, if, if I die or they kill me or like
I hit rock bottom with no money, no nothing
I'd rather be my reason for my downfall, not my brothers
You know what I'm sayin'?

We was fucked up, splittin' Mickey D's
Ridin' in that Nissan, hopin' for some Bentley keys
I was tellin' you about my problems with my kids and niece
I ain't have no time for 'em, but I did for the streets
And I ain't gon' brag on what I did for the streets
I say I won't tell a soul what I did for the streets
Better keep your mouth closed what I did for the streets
Go up fifty a show, dropped Signed to the Streets
