		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't you want it can't you feel it
There's something in the air tonight
10,9,8,7,6,5

Don't you want it
Now hitting on the dance floor what's it all about
Girl I give it all make me feel high

10,9,8,7,6, Five time to turn it up 'cause you're getting hot
Why do we bring the flow so raw
Make you want to dance so go on the floor
It's all about the monies, what
Time to get down and get da honeys, yo Scott

[Bridge:]
Baby I can make the nights last forever
And I can make you satisfied
So if you feel like coming together
It's something that you must decide

[Chorus]
Don't you want it, don't you need it
I can give it all and I mean it (aw!)
Don't you want it, Can't you feel it
There's something in the air tonight

Rising from the depths, I confess
Baby I can hit you off got a super on my chest
Nothing but the very best
What you need and you best believin'
Tell that you're feeling
The hand that I'm dealing
Never hear me lack upon a track
Style and whicky whack but you gotta
Savour that a roller-coaster ride baby come and climb upon it
Ruggedness I've shown it, tell me don't you want it

[Bridge 2:]
Baby I can make the sun shine forever
I know you've heard it all before
But if you feel like coming together
All of this will be yours

[Chorus]

I got everything you want baby everything you need now
I can give it all I got everything you want
Baby everything you need now don't you want it, don't you
Don't you want it
Don't you need it
Don't you want it
Can't you feel it
10,9,8,7,6, Five

[Chorus]
