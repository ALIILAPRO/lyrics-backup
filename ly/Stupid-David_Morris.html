		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tonight I'm all alone, killing time and I feel crazy
'Cause I can't live with you but I can't live without, baby
It's a dark night in these streets of my hometown
And when I think about you, I can't help but think how

I feel stupid loving you like all these other guys
I feel stupid loving you but I still want to try
You know you've broke my heart at least a hundred times
I feel stupid loving you like all these other guys

And just as usual, you know just how beautiful you are
You storm around this town like you own everything
And just like usual, I get so delusional
Thinking 'bout you and how I need you now (come back to me)

I feel stupid loving you like all these other guys
I feel stupid loving you but I still want to try
You know you've broke my heart at least a hundred times
I feel stupid loving you like all these other guys

I feel stupid loving you like all these other guys
I feel stupid loving you but I still want to try
You know you've broke my heart at least a hundred times
I feel stupid loving you like all these other guys

I feel stupid loving you like all these other guys
I feel stupid thinking maybe I could change your mind
'Cause everything you tell me girl, is such a lie
I feel stupid loving you like all these other guys

I feel stupid loving you like all these other guys
I feel stupid loving you but I still want to try
You know you've broke my heart at least a hundred times
I feel stupid loving you like all these other guys
