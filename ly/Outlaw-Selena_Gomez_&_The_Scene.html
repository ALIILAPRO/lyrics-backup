		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You've been riding this horse a long time
Why can't you find what you've been looking for?
Always greener on the other side
Always believing there must be something more

Never stay very long anywhere
As the next girl you leave gets smaller
In your rear-view mirror

You're an outlaw
You're an outlaw
You're an outlaw running from love

You're an outlaw
You're an outlaw
You're an outlaw running from love

If you tear her world apart
You have no regrets
If there's a key to your heart
No one has found it yet

You're an outlaw
You're an outlaw
You're an outlaw running from love

Your reputation's getting out of control
I can't believe she believes one word you said
Before I let you take my girlfriend home
I've got to warn her about the price on your head

It must feel so alone out there
Always running away from someone
But you get nowhere

You're an outlaw
You're an outlaw
You're an outlaw running from love

If you tear her world apart
You have no regrets
If there's a key to your heart
No one has found it yet

You're an outlaw
You're an outlaw
You're an outlaw running from love

I'm from the Lone Star State
I'm ready to bring you in, oh
I'm gonna seal your fate
Make you pay for all of your sins, oh, oh-oh

You've been riding this horse a long time
I've had my eye on you all night
I'm gonna find a way to make you mine
I know, even though

You're an outlaw
You're an outlaw
You're an outlaw running from love

You're an outlaw
You're an outlaw
You're an outlaw running from love

If you tear her world apart
You have no regrets
If there's a key to your heart
No one has found it yet

You're an outlaw
You're an outlaw
You're an outlaw running from love
Stop running
