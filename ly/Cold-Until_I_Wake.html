		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm in a bad head space
So just stay away
While I numb the pain
Oh, the things I say
While we're face to face
Have I gone insane?

Now you build your walls
And it feels like I don't know you at all
Lost in the dark as I run through the endless halls

Don't just sit and wonder
You aren't just another
After thought when I'm alone
Someone I can string along
I won't ask for a thing
Would you even listen?
I know words will not atone
For all the nights I've left you cold

You don't play those games
Said I'd change my ways
Another time and place
A war inside my brain
Devil in my way
And I can't escape

Now you build your walls
And it feels like I don't know you at all
Lost in the dark as I run through the endless halls

Don't just sit and wonder
You aren't just another
Afterthought when I'm alone
Someone I can string along
I won't ask for a thing
Would you even listen?
I know words will not atone
For all the nights I've left you cold

Romanticizing what puts you through hell
But I would die for you and no one else

Don't just sit and wonder
You aren't just another
Afterthought when I'm alone
Someone I can string along
I won't ask for a thing
Would you even listen?
I know words will not atone
For all the nights I've left you cold

(Cold) you're so cold
For all the nights I've left you cold
(Cold) you're so cold
Someone I can string along
(All the nights I've left you cold)
