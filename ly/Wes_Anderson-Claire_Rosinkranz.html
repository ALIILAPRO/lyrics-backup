		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'll give you good advice, don't answer them
Let me set the picture like Wes Anderson
Walking 'round the block, pretty out of it
Me and you, I doubted, doubted it

Ring-ring, keep on bothering me
Light my cigarette, please
Made me feel so lonely
Oh, lonely

When will you wake up?
Get over your breakup
Give yourself a moment, count one, two, three (one, two, three)
Moments are fleeting
Some things don't break even
What do you believe in? Nothing's guaranteed

Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-ohh
Nothing's ever guaranteed
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-ohh

I'll tell ya what I think, get over it
Falling out of bounce when October hit
Try to keep my cool (cool), get ahold of it
Ninety degrees, did you notice it? (Did you, oh, oh)

Oh, ring-ring, keep on bothering me (ring, ring, ring, ring)
Light my cigarette, please
Made me feel so lonely
Oh, lonely

When will you wake up?
Get over your breakup
Give yourself a moment, count one, two, three (one, two, three)
Moments are fleeting
Some things don't break even
What do you believe in? Nothing's guaranteed (nothing's guaranteed)

Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-ohh
Nothing's ever guaranteed
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-ohh

Gotta let go, keep the tape rolling
Hit the pins, get a strike, stop holding
Onto last year's game, keep hoping
On a false profit, stop chocking

When will you wake up?
Get over your breakup
Give yourself a moment, count one, two, three
Moments are fleeting
Some things don't break even
What do you believe in? Nothing's guaranteed

Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-ohh
Nothing's ever guaranteed
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-ohh (nothing's guaranteed)

Lonely, lonely (lonely, lonely)
I'm so lonely, lonely
Nothing's ever guran-guranteed
Don't know what I believe (believe)
