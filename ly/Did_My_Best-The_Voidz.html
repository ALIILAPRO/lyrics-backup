		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let me tell you a story
'Bout the hazy good old days

Changing the game, rules are for kids
Wanted to play, but now I'm on the sideline
Watching everyone having so much fun
Never let 'em know you're angrier than them

Nobody cares about the days of old
Take a quick picture then you run home
Call up my friends, no one picks up
I guess I'm going out all alone again

It's time to grow up, but I don't wanna calm down
Everything happens for a reason somehow
But I know that's not true, the meaning is just
The same common purpose that I love but might not trust no more

Oh mama, how I miss those days
Watch them stream away, I wave
But they don't wave back at me
Guess they're just afraid that they might get seen
Maybe afraid of what they wanna be
Some old freak like me
No

It all makes sense, prisoners of Earth
Listen to the stories from before your birth
Training for the game, kiss him in the rain
Everything about it is so fucking insane
It's been a long time, we never lost touch
Here comes an old witch with a poison apple
Bring it to me, I'll take a bite
Every last piece until I lose the light, oh

I can only change what I can change
I can only change what I can change
Meet me at the bottom
I can only change what I can change
I can only change what I can change
Meet me at the bottom
The lost years

I never think about those days everyone's talking about
They were the best, I guess
You say you like the way I dress
But that gets me beat up
And now you see
That was the story of my youth
I hope it makes sense to you
'Cause it doesn't make sense to me
