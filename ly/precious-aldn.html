		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I hope you know that you are precious to me
I fucking hate the new me 
He's taking medicine to feel again
He can't get up to talk to them
You're so precious to me
I'm so sorry that you had to see me here like this
I hope you know that you are precious to me
I fucking hate the new me
Everything is meant to be 
Can't control my personality 
You're so precious to me
I always fuck it up and let it slip away
Away

I think I saw you in a dream last night
I know you're not my type but it felt so right
Butterflies in my stomach but they're scared of flight 
Why can't anything ever be perfect
It was perfect
I got replaced take my face it was all a fucking waste 
But it's whatever it's whatever 
I've been through the shitty weather 
Before 
I've been through it before, yeah

Wish every moment was so special 
I can think of several 
Remember when you tied my shoe, you were so gentle 
I wish that I was helpful 
Wish I was successful 
Wish that I was special 
Special 
And now I face reality 
There's no one meant for me
Fuck being someone that I never even wanted to be
And I'm so close to living so happily 
I'm gonna drop everything and move to the city

I hope you know that you are precious to me
I fucking hate the new me 
He's taking medicine to feel again
He can't get up to talk to them
You're so precious to me
I'm so sorry that you had to see me here like this
I hope you know that you are precious to me
I fucking hate the new me
Everything is meant to be 
Can't control my personality 
You're so precious to me
I always fuck it up and let it slip away
Away
I let it slip away
