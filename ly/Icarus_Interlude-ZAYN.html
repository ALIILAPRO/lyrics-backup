		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh, ooh, ooh
Call me Icarus
I guess I flew too close to the sun
Myth will call me legend
That might be why
In my Yves Saint Laurent
Get the bees coming in for the honey I supply
And if you ain't got it now then you're in for a surprise
You won't get it in a lifetime
I'm in the right place at the right time

Girl, you love me
Better than anyone
Girl, you love me
Better than love
Girl, you love me
Better than I've known before
Better than I've known before
(Better than I've known before)

(Ain't no stopping what I know)
(Before)
(What I know, ain't no)
Ain't no stopping what I feel
Plays on my mind in slow-mo
Every time as if it were real
Every night
It's you I feel
That's who you are in my mind

I've been lying to the liars
I've been lying
I've been lying to the liars
I've been lying to the liars
I've been lying with the liars
Every night
Lying 'cause im flying
I've been lying to the liars
Lying to the liars
