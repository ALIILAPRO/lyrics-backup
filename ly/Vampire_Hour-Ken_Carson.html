		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I never changed (star boy, you're my hero)
I never changed
These niggas switched up, huh, I remained the same, huh
I just want the money, nigga, you can have these chains
You can have the other shit, you can have the fame
You can have all these bitches, we wouldn't still be the same
You could have all these riches, we still wouldn't be the same

I'm a vampire, ayy, ayy, look at my fangs
Yeah, she vamp now, 'cause I bit her the other day
Everywhere I go, I keep a letter after J
Don't let that shit go over yo' head, I keep a K
You could say what you say, I'ma still do what I wanna do anyway
Nigga tried to lock in like a lockout, blow off her socks and I blew her brain
Like a dollar bill, yeah, yeah, yeah, I never changed
How you disappear when I needed you the most, yeah, that shit strange

I'ma just stay in my lane, I'ma-, yeah
I'ma just stay in my lane
I'ma just stay out yo' way, yeah
Way, yeah
Let's go

How the fuck you said I changed, when I never changed, you're the one who changed on me
I been stackin' up for some days, night, and weeks to make sure my gang complete
Even when I got security, and my gang, I still got that bang on me
Even if I go to the studio, I'm gonna still pull up on your main at 3AM
I pop out at night, bitch, I'm a real V-A-M-P, I'm a vampire, yeah
Only time I change is when I turned into a bat
That boy changed, we thought he was real, he turned into a rat
Hop out the Kel, yeah, hop out the Hell', yeah, Hellcat
I'm bein' (?), I'm burnin' the tires, I know you smell that
If my weed smokin' in your house, you need to bag that
You know that ho havin' way too much baggage, why you bag that?

I never changed, I never changed
These niggas switched up, huh, I remained the same, huh
I just want the money, nigga, you can have these chains
You can have the other shit, you can have the fame
You can have all these bitches, we wouldn't still be the same
You could have all these riches, we still wouldn't be the same
