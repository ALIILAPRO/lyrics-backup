		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In these days of confusion
You've turned angry and cold
You say it's an illusion
There's no fire in your soul

Say you don't love me
Say you don't care
But don't leave me standing here
Your heart's like a wheel

Just waiting to roll
It's longing for freedom
To get out on the road
You're hungry for something

That you may never find
So many reasons
Your love has made you blind
You say you don't love me

You say you don't care
So don't leave me standing here
Don't leave me standing here
You say you don't love me

You say you don't care
Don't leave me
Don't leave me standing here
Life ain't been easy

Full of passion and pain
Told me no reason
Why I was to blame
Don't leave me standing

Don't leave me standing
Don't leave me standing
On my own
