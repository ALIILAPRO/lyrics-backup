		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  These martyrs seek no adoration
No promises of God's salvation
They kicked the ladder from beneath their feet
They hung the heroes. They hung the heroes

You've got to watch your back
You've got to swallow fear
Cover your tracks, or you might disappear
They found the words to speak unspeakable things
And they struck the air from the chests of kings

These martyrs seek no adoration
No promises of God's salvation
They kicked the ladder from beneath their feet
They hung the heroes. They hung the heroes

If you were caught between the devil and the deep blue sea
Would you run and hide, or stand for what you believe?
Maybe Orwell was right all along
They think this spells the end, it's only just begun

These martyrs seek no adoration
No promises of God's salvation
They kicked the ladder from beneath their feet
They hung the heroes. They hung the heroes

If you find your feet, you can eclipse the sun
Swear that you won't forget
Swear that you won't forget

If you find your feet, you can eclipse the sun
Swear that you won't forget
Swear that you won't forget

Tell the rats to get back in the gutter
We'll be watching, we're always watching

You try to stamp them out, you'll only fan the flames
This is for all the snakes. Fuck you
So hold your forked tongue
You've got us spitting nails
I'm gonna to say it straight. Fuck you

If you find your feet, you can eclipse the sun
Swear that you won't forget
If you find your feet, you can eclipse the sun
They think this spells the end, it's only just begun
