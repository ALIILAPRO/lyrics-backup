		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The church doors are closed
To those who need most
The love that's inside, mmm
In the black tides they fight
'Bout who's wrong or right
While the innocent die, mmm
An eye for an eye leaves
Everyone blind, we
We can't seem to see the way, oh

'Cause everyone's hurtin'
Tell me, when will we learn it?
And what more can I say

What if we just
Love
Love
Love?
What if we just
Love
Love
Am I askin' too much? Oh

Too many have lost their lives and
Too many tears we've cried 'cause
We couldn't seem to see the light
But what if we just
Love
Love
Love?

Now you're all by yourself
And you're cryin' for help
But they don't hear a sound
And your walls know too well
You've been livin' in hell
Tell me what to do now, oh

But don't you get tired
When you run for your life, yeah?
You don't need to this time

What if we just
Love
Love
Love?
What if we just
Love
Love
Love? Oh

Too many have lost their lives and
Too many tears we've cried 'cause
We couldn't seem to see the light

But what if we just
Love
Love
Love?
What if we just
Love
Love
Love?

But what if we just
Love?
We just love
