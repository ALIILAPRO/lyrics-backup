		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Could you help me go much further?
When my reason's made of thunder?
Will you stand misgiving splendor?
(I'll give you the pieces you've missed in your life)
Be there when my mind surrenders?
(Burning all the secrets you keep in your eyes)

Something strong
Is building its home
Where you belong
Where you belong

Will you stand this hungered loving?
If my wounded soul feels sorry?
Even when my heart looks salty?
(I'll give you the pieces you've missed in your life)
Be there when my fears are screaming?
(Burning all the secrets you keep in your eyes)

Something strong
Is building its home
Where you belong
Where you belong
