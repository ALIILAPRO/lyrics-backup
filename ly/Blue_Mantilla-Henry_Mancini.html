		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All the homies they know what I mean
Baby let me show you how I lean
(Like a cholo)
Lay back, bounce in the club
When we do a dance, yeah we do it like what'
Like a, like a cholo

Side to side
Elbows up, side to side
Elbows up, side to side
Elbows up, side to side
Like a cholo

All up in the club, ten deep
Lookin' for some hyenas, we on the creep
I need a bad one, a real freak
Find them at the dance floor, so don't sleep

Damn, I like you, I like you
But a really want her
She's that type, I can tell
Let me get in too deep
Take her back to the hotel

But right now I'm on the move
Show this little momma how a gangsta groove
I don't do a whole lot, just enough
Lean side to side, keep my elbows up

Like this and like that
All the girls know where the real G's at
You could find us way up in the back
Watching that ass bounce like a low low
I lean like a cholo

Side to side
Elbows up, side to side
Elbows up, side to side
Elbows up, side to side
I lean like a cholo

Side to side
Elbows up, side to side
Elbows up, side to side
Elbows up, side to side
Like a cholo

I'm brown, I get down
The girls love how I lean
Like a G to the beat
Blue and white MJ's on my feet

I'm lookin' real good, I'm so hood
Gotta stay clean if you know what I mean
Pockets full of feria, mucho dinero
Look me in my eyes, tell me, 'Papi, te quiero'

Let me do my dance, you do yours
Shaking what you got 'til you're sweating out your pours
Just like that, yeah I like that
I'm a perro tryin' to chase that cat

Hey DJ won't you play that same track'
Wind it back, I can lean to that
Now she wants me
And I ain't going home solo
'Cause I lean like a cholo

Side to side
Elbows up, side to side
Elbows up, side to side
Elbows up, side to side
I lean like a cholo

Side to side
Elbows up, side to side
Elbows up, side to side
Elbows up, side to side
Like a cholo

All the homies they know what I mean
Baby let me show you how I lean
(Like a cholo)
Lay back, bounce in the club
When we do a dance, yeah we do it like what'
(Like a cholo)

All the homies they know what I mean
Baby let me show you how I lean
(Like a cholo)
Lay back, bounce in the club
When we do a dance, yeah we do it like what'
Like a, like a cholo

Side to side
Elbows up, side to side
Elbows up, side to side
Elbows up, side to side
I lean like a cholo

Side to side
Elbows up, side to side
Elbows up, side to side
Elbows up, side to side
I lean like a cholo

Side to side
Elbows up, side to side
Elbows up, side to side
Elbows up, side to side
I lean like a cholo

Side to side
Elbows up, side to side
Elbows up, side to side
F-f-fingers on the track
