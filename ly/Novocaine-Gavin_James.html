		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Honey I, wish I met you way back in my youth
Honey I, know the past was wasted time and that's the truth
'Til you gave me love, made me feel like home 
You know that I don't dance but when I dance, wanna dance with you

Honey I, I don't know what it is but it feels like ecstasy
Honey I, don't wanna see no one else, nowhere else I'd rather be
You give me serotonin butterflies so I don't need no other highs

Anytime I try to explain the way you're making me feel
The words inside of my brain turn into nothing at all
Maybe a little bit strange but you don't see me complain
Gotta admit that I need this, I want this

You give me something to crave
That leaves me burning for days
It's like a chemical haze
It takes me far away
Might seem a little bit crazy
When I see your face
God, this feels like Novocaine
Novocaine

Honey you, you don't have to say nothing at all
We'll hide in our rooms
Under the covers don't you know that we can fall

Into a daydream runaway with me and if we can't find Heaven we can make believe

Anytime I try to explain the way you're making me feel
The words inside of my brain turn into nothing at all
Maybe a little bit strange but you don't see me complain
Got to admit that I need this, I want this

You give me something to crave
That leaves me burning for days
It's like a chemical haze
It takes me far away
Might seem a little bit crazy
When I see your face
God, this feels like Novocaine
Novocaine

I don't need nobody else 'cause you're the only one, yeah
You're my Novocaine
My Novocaine
I don't need nobody else 'cause you're the only one, yeah
You're my Novocaine
My Novocaine

Anytime I try to explain the way you're making me feel
The words inside of my brain turn into nothing at all
Maybe a little bit strange but you don't see me complain
Got to admit that I need this, I want this

You give me something to crave
That leaves me burning for days
It's like a chemical haze
It takes me far away
Might seem a little bit crazy
When I see your face
God, this feels like Novocaine
Novocaine
Novocaine
