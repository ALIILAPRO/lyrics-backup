		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Midnight, Dutch, Kami, space, space, yuh

You can get face fucked, I run the knife through your pupil and into your eye
She wanna fuck, I don't care if I'm bloody
She bloody her panties, get ripped to the side
I have been making my way through the depths of my mental 
To strengthen my will to survive
You niggas funny the way that you talk 
Like you tough but in person you begging me not to go wild

Threaten me, I wanna die instead
I run the blade deep inside your neck
I am a murderous guy at best
I'm God cause I kill and decide who next
Threaten me, I wanna die instead
I run the blade deep inside your neck
I am a murderous guy at best
I'm God cause I kill and decide who next

Damage is critical
Yeah it's critical
Damage is critical
Damage critical
Damage is critical
Damage critical
Damage is critical
Yeah it's done
Damage is critical
Yeah it's critical
Damage is critical
Damage critical
Damage is critical
Damage critical
Damage is critical
Yeah it's done

Fuck shit, I got that pain in my chest, I can feel it inside
Run it up quick if you want it I got it
I'm gunning it's nothing when I'm on the rise
Out of my head in this bitch I am losing my shit
In a cell I am losing my mind
Pray to the sky that they lock me a way with no key 
Or else all of you fuck niggas die

Damage is critical
Damage is critical (Yuh, aye)
Damage critical (Yuh, aye)
Damage is critical (Yuh, aye)
Damage critical (Yuh, aye)
Damage is critical (Yuh, aye)
Damage is critical (Yuh, aye)
Damage is critical (Yuh, aye)
Damage critical (Yuh, aye)
Damage is critical (Yuh, aye)
Damage critical (Yuh, aye)
Damage is critical (Yuh, aye)

Die instead (Space, space)
I run the blade deep inside your neck (Space, space)
I am a murderous guy at best (Space, space)
I'm God cause I kill and decide who next (Space, yah)
Threaten me, I wanna die instead (Space, space)
I run the blade deep inside your neck (Space, space)
I am a murderous guy at best (Space, space)
I'm God cause I kill and decide who next (Space, yah)
