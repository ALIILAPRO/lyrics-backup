		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Another night she sleeps alone
As she waits for her Romeo
It's the kind of things you read in books
Where he's doin' things that she don't know
Passion gets the best of some
While pain always is the hardest part
And even when you find the one
It's really over before you start
Love's more than a 4-letter word
It's everything that they say is real
And never think that it can't hurt
Even when you've got
A heart of steel
She waits for the phone to ring
As the tears fall from her eyes
And starts to wonder of what was told
Is it true or was it lies
Passion gets the best of some
While pain always is the hardest part
And even when you find the one
It's really over before you start
Love's more than a 4-letter word
It's everything that they say is real
And never think that it can't hurt
Even when you've got
A heart of steel
A shot to the body
Straight to the heart
It doesn't matter cause it's all the same
That look in your eyes tears me apart
But I know I can live with this pain
You take the good, you take the bad
But I know we can make it
'Cause with one touch
You can melt this heart of steel
Love's more than a 4-letter word
It's everything that they say is real
And never think that it can't hurt
Even when you've got
A heart of steel
Love's more than a 4-letter word
It's everything that they say is real
And never think that it can't hurt
Even when you've got
A heart of steel
