		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I, I don't wanna

Can you come fuck me right now?
Parents are home but my bed's too loud
I can take it on the ground
If I get too loud you can shut my mouth

Got me like
Mm-mm
Yeah, yeah
Mm-mm

Got me like
Mm-mm
Yeah, yeah
Mmm, oh, ooh

I got this aching and itching to be in submission
I got this burning desire to set you on fire
I hope my whole room goes down
You say swallow the fire I'll choke it down
Say anything when you're around
Say anything and I make that sound like

Can you come fuck me right now?
Parents are home but my bed's too loud
I can take it on the ground
If I get too loud you can shut my mouth

Got me like
Mm-mm
Yeah, yeah
Mm-mm

Got me like
Mm-mm
Yeah, yeah
Mmm, oh, ooh

I'm afraid of who I'll be
If this love ends up ending me
I spent enough time saying I'ma a savage, a bad bitch
Who don't need no man
Tired of turning to instagram
Tired of pretending I don't give a damn
When I'm fucking lonely
Come and hold me
Fuck your ego
I need you here though

Can you come fuck me right now?
Parents are home but my bed's too loud
I can take it on the ground
If I get too loud you can shut my mouth

Got me like
Mm-mm
Yeah, yeah
Mm-mm

Got me like
Mm-mm
Yeah, yeah
Mmm, oh, ooh
