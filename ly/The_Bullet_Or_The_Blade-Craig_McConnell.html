		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I remember those lost in the dark
The bullet or the blade that kept us apart
But I’ve been moving on, can’t be still for long 
‘Cause it’s the only way

Never ache for a place called home
Can’t hold on too tight, gotta let it all go
I have a purpose and it’s all that I need
To help me find my way, every day

Keep your eyes on the road ahead
Don’t be drawn into the light or the shadows in your head
Keep your eyes on the road ahead
And don’t ever look back, don’t ever look back ‘cause
I gotta feeling in my bones that everything is gonna be fine
Yeah, don’t ever look back, don’t ever look back

I fought a war and I learned how to win
But how do you fight when the enemy’s within?
Find your pride, go deeper inside
For the fire that will light your way

The ones you trust can one day betray
You’re the hunter and then you’re the prey
You pay the cost and it all feels lost
Then you hear a voice inside you say …

Keep your eyes on the road ahead
Don’t be drawn into the light or the shadows in your head
Keep your eyes on the road ahead
And don’t ever look back, don’t ever look back ‘cause
I gotta feeling in my blood that the future is gonna be fine
Yeah, don’t ever look back, don’t hold on to the past

A lot of road now behind me
Every cut, every bruise, they tell their own story
Whatever’s up ahead, around the next bend
I know I will survive

I’ve learned how to live with regret
I can forgive but how could I forget
The things I’ve learned, the strength that I’ve earned
I have it all by my side, as I ride

Keep your eyes on the road ahead
Don’t be drawn into the light or the shadows in your head
Keep your eyes on the road ahead
And don’t ever look back, don’t ever look back ‘cause
I gotta feeling in my bones that everything is gonna be fine
Yeah, don’t ever look back, don’t ever look back

（I remember those lost in the dark
The bullet or the blade that kept us apart
But I’ve been moving on, can’t be still for long 
‘Cause it’s the only way）
