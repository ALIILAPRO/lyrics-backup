		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't want a friend (just me)
I want my life in two (I want my life in two)
Waiting to get there
Waiting for you (waiting for you)

When I'm around slow dancing in the dark
Don't follow me, you'll end up in my arms
You done made up your mind
I don't need no more signs can you?
Can you?

Give me reasons we should be complete
You should be with him, I can't compete
Looked at me like I was someone else, oh well
Can't you see? I don't wanna slow dance
(I don't wanna slow dance) in the dark
Dark

When you gotta run
Just hear my voice in you (my voice in you)
Shutting me out of you
Doing so great (Doing so great) you

Used to be the one to hold you when you fall
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I don't fuck with your tone
(I don't fuck with your tone)
I don't wanna go home
(I don't wanna go home)
Can it be one night? Can you?
Can you?

Give me reasons we should be complete
You should be with him, I can't compete
Looked at me like I was someone else, oh well
Can't you see? I don't wanna slow dance
(I don't wanna slow dance) in the dark
Dark
