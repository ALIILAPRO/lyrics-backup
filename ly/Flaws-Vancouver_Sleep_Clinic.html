		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The weight, I'm gone
In my skin, I'm lost
Tangled in the bones of this love
Melt into the flow of your blood

Grace bestowed
But I was shaped with snow
Seasons don't change
Ignorance remains

I need this alone
I need this alone

Ooh

The burdens on this chest
The vessel of these words
Sinking under tension
Drew afterthoughts and hurt

The burdens on this chest
The vessel of these words
Sinking under tension
Drew afterthoughts and hurt

Ah
Ah

I need this alone
I need this alone
I need this alone
I need this alone
I need this alone

The burdens on this chest
The vessel of these words
Sinking under tension
Drew afterthoughts and hurt
The burdens on this chest
The vessel of these words
Sinking under tension
Drew afterthoughts and hurt
