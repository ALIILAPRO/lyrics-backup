		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Babylon, burn, burn, burn
Sojah representing
We dream of this wonderful time, now we want a reality
Where we can smoke marijuana every day without noÿ apologies

And even when we eyes them red like blood, Babylon can't pene we
'Cause a da healing of the nation
And H.I.M. no want no aggravation

Youthman step out inna Babylon face
Spliff in a we mouth and the chalice we a blaze
Smoke marijuana weÿ get so high like birds in the sky we fly
Youthman step out inna Babylon face
Spliff in a we mouth and the chalice we a blaze
Smoke marijuana weÿ get so high like birds in the sky we fly

Watch how we do, burn a spliff
Whole a medi, then we trail fi sendÿ Babylon go cemetery
Where we mek we talk and try fi market
Always dem a try find the weed dem want fi stop it
So we roll the dutchie and we blaze up the kutchie
Try to load the weed and Babylon dem can't touch it
We want fi blaze every day
We nah give a fuck what Babylon man say

Youthman step out inna Babylon face
Spliff in a we mouth and the chalice we a blaze
Smoke marijuana weÿ get so high, like birds in the sky we fly
Youthman step out inna Babylon face
Spliff in a we mouth and the chalice we a blaze
Smoke marijuana weÿ get so high, like birds in the sky we fly

Yo we burn the herbs and get high
Blaze it up in front of the policeman, ay
Ganja we a smoke but the coke we nah try
When dem ask you why tell them it was sent to I by The Most High
It was found pon Solomon grave and him a the wisest man
See the spliff inna mi hand youÿ better try get one
We want nuff-nuff-nuff-nuff weed to go around
Yo, from Jamaica we ship a thousand miles

Youthman step out inna babylon face
Spliff in a we mouth and the chalice we a blaze
Smoke marijuana weÿ get so high, like birds in the sky we fly
Youthman step out inna babylon face
Spliff in a we mouth and the chalice we a blaze
Smoke marijuana weÿ get so high, like birds in the sky we fly

We dream of this wonderful time
Now we want a reality
Where we can blaze marijuana every day without noÿ apologies
And even when we eyes them red like blood Babylon can't pene we
'Cause a da healing of the nation
And H.I.M. no want no aggravation

Youthman step out inna Babylon face
Spliff in a we mouth and the chalice we a blaze
Smoke marijuana weÿ get so high, like birds in the sky we fly
Youthman step out inna Babylon face
Spliff in a we mouth and the chalice we a blaze
Smoke marijuana weÿ get so high, like birds in the sky we fly
