		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey baby, you know I'mma turn you up
Waka Flame
I got you! You know!

Nowhere to run boy, run come here right now
Here right now, here right now
There's only one thing that I wanna feel right now
Feel right now, feel right now

You all over my skin, I'm anxious
Paint my body boy, I'll be your canvas
Don't talk to me, just show me your talent
Your talent, oh

One look and your're mine
Keep your eyes on me now
'Cause when the stars align
You might bring the beast out

Nowhere to run boy, run come here right now
Right now, right now
'Cause when the sun goes down, the beast comes out
Comes out, comes out

'Cause when the stars align
You might bring the beast out
One look and your're mine
Keep your eyes on me
Nowhere to run boy, run come here right now
Right now, right now

Keep my eyes on you
Keepin' ties to you
Keep aside, I keep a sight, I be inside of you
Between your thighs I woop
We gon' slide by in that coupe
We gon' weave through all that traffic
I wear ones and I work magic
Too much passion can end up tragic
Just attraction, no attachment, Flocka!

Nowhere to run boy, run come here right now
Right now, right now
'Cause when the sun goes down, the beast comes out
Comes out, comes out

'Cause when the stars align
You might bring the beast out
One look in your mind
Keep your eyes on me
Nowhere to run boy run, come here right now
Right now, right now

I'll take you down, down can you keep it up all night
Up all night, up all night?
Want you run run run baby give me what I like
What I like, what I like

You all over my skin, I'm anxious
Paint my body boy, I'll be your canvas
Don't talk to me, just show me your talent
Your talent (oh)

Nowhere to run boy, run come here right now
Right now, right now
'Cause when the sun goes down, the beast comes out
Comes out, comes out

'Cause when the stars align
You might bring the beast out
One look in your mind
Keep your eyes on me
Nowhere to run boy run, come here right now
Right now, right now

Nowhere to run boy run, come here right now (right now)
