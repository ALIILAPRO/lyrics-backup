		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Love could have you in a trance you need to desperately wake up from
When it was time to dance, could always count on you to be my plus-one
High on cloud nine from stomach butterflies, it's when that rush come
I gave that ungrateful bitch my all, that wasn't enough, huh?
No, I swear these hoes, you can't trust 'em
Baby, I don't want relations, I'm just tryna fuck some
I'm just tryna drop a hit and make the club jump
But I hate that I was too deep in so young

I done spent two-thirty on a brand-new Richard Mille
I been turnt up, I'm the youngest and the richest in my city
All on Twitter on my dick because that bitch can't get up with me
This rapper lifestyle lit, called it a quits and now she shitty, uh
In my bag, not in my feelings, do I miss it? Nah, not really
And I know these niggas envy, so I'm clutchin' on my semi
With my goon squad, and we don't catch attempts, so please don't tempt me
Glock gon' do its job and bro gon' blow that bitch 'til it get empty, uh
And for bro, I'd give my kidney up, shots, that's a hundred sixty plus
Me and Liv just fucked Philly up, fucking hoes, I done bust plenty nuts
My care on zero, not no hero, nigga, I don't give any fucks
Adrenaline, that's why my fear go spaz out and let glizzies bust

Love could have you in a trance you need to desperately wake up from
When it was time to dance, could always count on you to be my plus-one
High on cloud nine from stomach butterflies, it's when that rush come
I gave that ungrateful bitch my all, that wasn't enough, huh?
No, I swear these hoes, you can't trust 'em
Baby, I don't want relations, I'm just tryna fuck some
I'm just tryna drop a hit and make the club jump
But I hate that I was too deep in so young

Casamigos sippin', I'm so in that I can't speak proper
She be doin' dicks from block to block, heard she's a street hopper
1300, baby, but got love from all the ReRockers
Them sliders stampin' hits, ain't gotta ask who did it, we shot you
For Ed 'nem and Lil Bit, bitch, you will get your hood hit
Had to watch 'em get put in the grave, them the same niggas I stood with
Bronem tryna ease that pain every time that them 'Woods lit
Accept all my mistakes, it's just one thing I wish I could fix
Niggas did way too much talkin', it's a lot of dead opps that I should diss
And really I be humble, it's a lot of hoes that I could hit
'Fore I fall off or stumble, we extort niggas on some Suge shit
How the fuck you gon' speak on what I did with my chances? You ain't never took risks

Love could have you in a trance you need to desperately wake up from
When it was time to dance, could always count on you to be my plus-one
High on cloud nine from stomach butterflies, it's when that rush come
I gave that ungrateful bitch my all, that wasn't enough, huh?
No, I swear these hoes, you can't trust 'em
Baby, I don't want relations, I'm just tryna fuck some
I'm just tryna drop a hit and make the club jump
But I hate that I was too deep in so young
