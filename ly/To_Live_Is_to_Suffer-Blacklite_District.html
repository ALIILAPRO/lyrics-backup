		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  To live is to suffer
Oh lord, take my mother away again
To live is to suffer
Forgive my father for he has sinned
To live is to suffer
Oh lord, take my mother away again
To live is to suffer
To live is to suffer

I hate to say it I don't think that you'll make it
If you keep on down this road
And live and die by this code, yeah
No I'm not playing
And this just ain't a saying
You're running much too fast
You're just hiding from the past, now I hate to say it
But this shit you can't fake it
You wanna take control
But you're just giving up your soul
Yeah, you can hate it
And your life might seem jaded
But it doesn't matter now
The writing on the walls been found, yeah

To live is to suffer
Oh lord, take my mother away again
To live is to suffer
Forgive my father for he has sinned
To live is to suffer
Oh lord, take my mother away again
To live is to suffer
To live is to suffer

I hate to say it I don't think that you'll make it
If you keep on down this road
And live and die by this code, yeah
No, I'm not playing
And this just ain't a saying
You're running much too fast
You're just hiding from the past, now I hate to say it
But this shit you can't fake it
You wanna take control
But you're just giving up your soul
Yeah, you can hate it
And your life might seem jaded
But it doesn't matter now
The writing on the walls been found

To live is to suffer
Oh lord, take my mother away again
To live is to suffer
Forgive my father for he has sinned
To live is to suffer
Oh lord, take my mother away again
To live is to suffer
To live is to suffer
