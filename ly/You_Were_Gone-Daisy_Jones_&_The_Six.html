		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mm, can't you tell by my face
There are things I try to erase?
Memory to nothing
What for the money's worth I pay?
I woke up and you sat me down
Said, "The future's over now"
And memories are nothing
And there's no light left to see

A tree carvin' of our names left high and alone
Nothin' ever seems to stay that way, not for too long
Where were you? Oh, when I needed you, you were gone
When I needed you, you were gone

Mm, not a trace of that break
I took a topple from the day
And gathered in a ball, couldn't even see
But the hand that pulled me through
The center of the night was you
That's why I'm floating, why I reach towards the moon

A tree carvin' of our names left high and alone
Nothin' ever seems to stay that way, not for too long
Where were you? Oh, when I needed you, you were gone
When I needed you, you were gone

Ooh
When I needed you, you were gone
Ooh
When I needed you, you were gone, mm
Ooh

How about we turn it off?
Just flip the switch and walk away
Every story has an ending
And it's not our job to stay
Now, how about we turn it off?
Just forget it, like it's gone
Oh, forget about the way you turn me on

Yeah, when I needed you, you were gone
(When I needed you, when I needed you)
When I needed you, you were gone
You were gone, you were gone
