		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
Put my shades on

Uh, I live it up in these like my last days
If time is money, I'm an hour past paid
Ugh, gunpowder in my hourglass
Niggas faker than some flour in a powder bag
Yeah, I put it down like my hands hurting
I'm on a natural high, but I land perfect
Some of us are lovers, most of y'all haters
But I put up a wall, and they just wallpaper
So love or hate me, I stay hate-free
They say we learn from mistakes, well that's why they mistake me
I got some weight on my shoulders, to me it's like feathers
All hail Weezy, call it bad weather
I stick to the script, I memorize the lines
'Cause life is a movie that I've seen too many times
You're on the outside looking in, close the blinds
And they say never say never, but fuck your never mind
I've been gone too long
True or false, right or wrong, haha
Hello Weezy, welcome home

Yeah and Imma
Blunt blowin'
Polo draws showin'
I don't give a lovely motherfuck ass nigga
With my money growing, no matter where you're goin'
You don't need a bus pass, for me to bust yo ass nigga Imma

Blunt blowin'
Polo draws showin'
I-I don't give a lovely motherfuck ass nigga
With my money blowing, don't matter I got more and
You don't need a bus pass, for me to bust yo ass nigga

Stunna, I got 'em, I'm back on them bitches
All about my riches, my name should be Richard
Cut the bullshit out, I'm Edward with the scissors
Life is a choice, and death is a decision
Times have changed, but fuck it get a new watch
I still got the vision like a line between two dots
Young money's eating, the label getting fatter
And yea, the tables turned, but I'm still sitting at 'em
I'm a bad motherfucker, 'cause the good die young
Everybody selling dreams, I'm too cheap to buy one
Man when that cookie crumble, everybody want a crumb
Shoot that hummingbird down, hummingbird don't hum yeah
Big money, big money, deep pockets
Money talks, and motherfuckers eavesdropping
Bunch of bloods, you could call it blood clotting
East side, My Piru Damu, I'mma

Blunt blowin'
Polo draws showin'
I don't give a lovely motherfuck ass nigga
With my teeth glowing, I'm on my Deebowin'
You don't need a bus pass, for me to bust yo ass nigga Imma

Blunt blowin'
Polo draws showin'
I-I don't give a lovely motherfuck ass nigga
With my money blowing, no matter where you going
You don't need a bus pass, for me to bust yo ass nigga

Light that Ashton Kusher, I'm a limit pusher
See y'all dead meat, and me I'm just a butcher
I do it for the money, man I am such a hooker
And freedom was my girl, until they fucking took her
You can look into the future, its right behind your eyelids
But I don't wanna know, 'cause shit I like surprises
Why that, why this, why you on that why shit?
Motherfucker ask me why, I say Y-M
Beach bum, call me ocean drive slim
Drop the top, look up and make the sky grin
Young moola, skinnies and some Supras
Belly of the beast till it puke us
Motherfucker

Blunt blowin'
Polo strings showin'
I don't give a lovely motherfuck ass nigga
With my teeth glowing, I'm on my Deebowin'
You don't need a bus pass, for me to bust yo ass nigga

Blunt blowin'
Polo strings showin'
I don't give a lovely motherfuck ass nigga
With my money blowing, no matter where you going
You don't need a bus pass, for me to bust yo ass nigga

I've been gone too long
True or false, right or wrong

Yeah I've been gone too long
True or false, right or wrong

Said I've been gone too long
True or false, right or wrong haha

Hello Weezy, welcome home (welcome home)
It's young mula, baby
Young mula, baby (young mula baby)

I've been gone too long
True or false, right or wrong
Hello Weezy, welcome home yeah
