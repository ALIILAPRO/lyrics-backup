		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yes sir
Investigating the case of loneliness
Wake up in the morning it's a blessing
Count on my finger days this year that I was stressing
My mind be where the growth, what the lesson
Remember days I used to put myself second
My mental tell me why not go and roll one
You might need something just to keep up your composure
I be in my head all the time
Might need someone who can help
Someone to understand me
Zero forty two I swoop in like Columbus
Out the blue I make it rain, Tropic Thunder
Got the high score
Quit playing with me, yea
Lightskin and i'm gifted but no Donald Glover
I do my best, take shots stay undercover
IV in his own lane, don't see no others doe
These other rappers is lame, nothing original
But I only say that knowing
That that one individual
Will leave a mark on the world like a branding on a plane meta-physical
Hate the fact that Cole's right, today's gone digital
Never speak about the love
But they love that medicinal
Matter fact
I be in my head all the time
All the fucking time
Looking like I be fine
Building this buzz like a beehive
But honey might take my own life
Feeling behind, below, so low
Alone, solo, sigh so faded
Isolated, yes, no, jaded
In mind the time always night
Gotta fight to make it out
Sight on taking crown
Light up then we taking down
Any demonic entity, plenty want it mentally
Amply tarnished but fuck it
I'm on this on off, off on so often honestly
Why offing myself seem like the most probable thing
Nah, that's probably a lie
But probability never on the odd side
Probability never on the odd side
Nah, think i'm just high
Stuck in my head
Wake up in the morning it's a blessing
Count on my finger days this year that I was stressing
My mind be where the growth, what the lesson
Remember days I used to put myself second
My mental tell me why not go and roll one
You might need something just to keep up your composure
I be in my head all the time
Might need someone who can help
Someone to understand me
In my, in my
In my, zone
In my, zone
I be, zone
In my zone
In my, zone hey
In my head
