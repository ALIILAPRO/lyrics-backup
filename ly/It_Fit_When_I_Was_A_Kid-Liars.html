		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Deep
At the end of space,
Further than the Sun
Is a crowd of chairs.
Way out
On a crystal sea,
Protecting you and me,
Is a battleship.
I

I had my eyebrow
Into a question.
Who is this captain,
And where do his friends live?

We were walking in the snow
Down the street from your front door,
I jumped a neighbor's fence at dawn,
Danced my way across your lawn,
Used a diamond on the glass,
Slithered slowly through the dark,
Made my way up o'er your stairs,
Crystals flying everywhere.

I
I

We will 
Drive you in the boot
Through the crooked past
To your resting place.
We will leave you in the woods,
Tell your friends you slipped,
Down the Lumen Tree.

If you're
Seen there,
Blooming
Inside

Each time I
Hope that
Talking
Improves

I will
Remember
You
You (In June?)

Follow lonely crowds as clouds will come.
Follow lonely crowds as clouds
Follow lonely crowds as clouds will come.
Follow lonely crowds as clouds will come.
