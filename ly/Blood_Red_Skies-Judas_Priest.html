		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  As the sun goes down, I move around
Keeping to the shadows
Life hangs by a thread
And I've heard it said
That I'll not see tomorrow

If that's my destiny, it'll have to be
So I'll face the future
Running out of time
I'm on the line
But I'll go down fighting

Felt the hand of justice
Telling wrong from right
Threw me out upon the street in the middle of the night
Cybernetic heartbeat
Digital, precise
Pneumatic fingers nearly had me in their vice

Not begging you
I'm telling you

You won't break me
You won't make me
You won't take me under blood red skies

You won't break me
You won't take me
I'll fight you under blood red skies

Through a shattered city, watched by laser eyes
Overhead the night squad glides
The decaying paradise
Automatic sniper
With computer sights
Scans the bleak horizon for its victim of the night

They're closing in
They'll never win

You won't break me
You won't take me
You won't make me under blood red skies

You won't break me
You won't take me
I'll fight you under blood red skies

As the end is drawing near
Standing proud, I won't give in to fear
As I die, a legend will be born
I will stand, I will fight
You'll never take me alive

I'll stand my ground
I won't go down

You won't break me
You won't take me
'Cause I'll fight you under blood red skies

You won't break me
You won't take me
'Cause I'll face you under blood red skies

You'll never take me alive
I'm telling you
Hands of justice

I will stand, I will fight
Never surrender (never surrender)
I still stand, I stand
