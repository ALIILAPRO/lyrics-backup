		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Was it all in my fantasy?
Where are you now?
Were you only imaginary?

Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Under the night 
the faded lights 
have set the heart on fire
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
I'm faded
I'm faded
So lost
Where are you now?

Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Was it all in my fantasy?
Where are you now?
Were you only imaginary?

Where are you now?
I'm faded
Where are you now?
I'm faded
Where are you now?
I'm faded
Where are you now?
I'm faded

Where are you now?
Atlantis, under the sea, under the sea
Where are you now?
Another dream
The monster's running wild inside of me
I'm faded, I'm faded
So lost, I'm faded, I'm faded
So lost, I'm faded
Where are you now?

Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Was it all in my fantasy?
Where are you now?
Were you only imaginary?

I'm faded, I'm faded
Where are you now?
I'm faded, so lost, I'm faded
I'm faded, 
I'm faded so lost, I'm faded
