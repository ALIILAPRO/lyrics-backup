		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wasn't there for you
I wasn't there for you

I know weather's gonna be fine
But I can't see you 'cross the streamline
My love waits for me in daytime
But I can't see you through the snowblind

But I wasn't there for you
You are gone
But I wasn't there for you
Goodbyes are long
Goodbye
But I wasn't there for you
Goodbye

I wasn't there for goodbye
I wasn't there for goodbye

Well, I know time reveals in hindsight
I can wrestle with the stormy night
Because your love lasts a lifetime
But I can see you through the snowblind

But I wasn't there for you
You are gone
But I wasn't there for you
Goodbyes are long

You are gone
But I wasn't there for you
Goodbyes are long
But I wasn't there for you
Goodbye

I wasn't there for you
I wasn't there
I wasn't there for you

But I wasn't there for you
You are gone
But I wasn't there for you
Goodbyes are long
Goodbye
