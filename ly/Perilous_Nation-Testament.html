		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bold is the one who dares to say what he feels
Renegation man, to one he yeilds
The bleeding hearts and empty minds, hiding words they fear
Blind is the one who censors what we see and hear
Come into my world and take a journey with me
Paint me a portait now, of the things you see 

Men are poor and lost in war of ideology
No solution will prevail unless we can be
Free on anger, free of pain
Free of hatred that we obtain
Tell me what this place was meant to be 

Can you see? Can you see what it does to me?
Can you hear? Can you red?
Can you see what it did to me! 

Totalitarians in a Perilous Nation
Forcing through control turns, to desolation
Listen to the leader speak, he's your only friend
Take a stand in the motherland, take it to the end 

Say now what you will, before they make it illegal
Time to draw the line, between the bad and the evil
Distant times had friendly rules, became its deadliest foe
We have heard it all before, the morals come and go 

Men are poor and lost in war of ideology
No solution will prevail unless we can be
Free on anger, free of pain
Free of hatred that we obtain
Tell me what this place was meant to be
Free on anger, free of pain
Free of hatred that we obtain
Tell me what this place was meant to be 

Can you see? Can you see what it does to me?
Can you hear? Can you red?
Can you see what it did to me, can you hear? Can you read?
Can you see what it did to me
Can you hear? Can you read?
Can you see what it did to me...
