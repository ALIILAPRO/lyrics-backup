		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bring the whips out for the Super Bowl (skrrt)
500 racks for the Stripper Bowl
The money on the floor, better get it, hoe (get it)
Anything goes with the Huncho
(Anything goes with the Huncho)
Yeah, yeah
(Buddah, bless this beat)
Ah yeah, woah, uh, yeah, yee, uh woah, yeah, we gon'
Sue, sue, sue, sue, sue, sue, sue, sue let's go

Big boy necklace, seriously flexin' (ice)
Niggas stressin', niggas out here pressin' (Uh)
Niggas out here playin'
My chopper keep on sprayin'
Get on my knees start prayin' (God!)
Get on my knees start crappin'
Everybody know that I'm trappin' (trap)
Everybody know that I'm gettin' it
Spatula money, I'm flipping it (flip)
Big guns all through the city
Bring the whips out for the Super Bowl (skrrt)
500 racks for the Stripper Bowl
The money on the floor, better get it, hoe (get it)
Anything goes with the Huncho
Stir fry, smokin' on eggrolls (whip)
Trap boy hot with a little stove (ahh)
The money got a crease like it been fold
I like my money straight hot cold (hey)
Life in the school, they got the eye on (ahh)
Mama said I left with the pot on (Mama)
Give 'em a shoulder to cry on (uhn)
Brrp, brrp, brrp your thot ain't home (brrrr)
On the ground, tryna be a gangsta (gangsta)
Nigga get bread with no fingers (fingers)
Boy Meets World, no Topanga (hey)
Got tried in the street and it change him (tried)
Damn, I find it the strangest (damn)
Lookin' at the lame and he famous (lame)
Crowd chasin' all different angles (crowd)
Little nigga don't know it get dangerous

Danger (woo, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Danger (woo, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Little nigga don't know it get dangerous
Danger (woo, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Danger (woo, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Little nigga don't know it get dangerous

Offset!
Make M's by the hour (M, m)
We gon' make him, leave him sour (kill him)
Double-up, stack it up, Twin Tower (Twin Tower)
Get the stick, pay the hit, some allowin' it (rah)
Auto, a burk-burk, net deter-terg'
I just occur-urred, LV Verge-erge
Mister perf-er, my wrist is work-work
Which one you work-work? Check on your turban (hey)
Eenie-meenie-miney-mo, they all want me (eenie-meenie-miney-mo)
Hit them all with a .40, the bullet comin' (bow)
Get a nigga dead for a lower hunnid (who?)
Guineas on my wrist, you left the water running (guinea)
Lookin' at, so I don't see it, that's a whole hunter (see)
Niggas kickin' in the door for plenty summers (hey)
Whip it on the stove like it's been in Hundo's (hoo-hoo!)
Take a niggas soul for some petty money

Danger (woo, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Danger (woo, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Little nigga don't know it get dangerous
Danger (woo, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Danger (woo, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Little nigga don't know it get dangerous

Danger, I'ma go and paint 'em (Pew-pew)
Douple Cup, Triple K, I'ma go hang 'em (hang)
Gotta let 'em out the cage, can't tame 'em (argh)
And if you catch 'em by D, you can't blame 'em (you can't)
Big torch, I'ma go and flame 'em
Triple bald lookin' like a Wrestle Mania (woah)
500k through 500 ways in the hurt and nobody else came with 'em (bro)
They say like they mention on Phi
Q say we did it with 21, "Nah" (we'll see)
A part of ya ain't know 'bout the plot
Have fun with the guys, and nobody dies (on God)
No cap on this story, as Banco you goin'
As Bussey, you think that I'm lyin' (ask 'em)
Never seen it with your eyes
So my money strippers were swimmin' in pies
It would've been

Danger (woo, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Danger (woo, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Little nigga don't know it get dangerous
Danger (woo, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Danger (woo, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Little nigga don't know it get dangerous (uh)
