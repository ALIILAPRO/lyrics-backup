		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  He loved her so
But she was already gone, long ago
He really wanted her to stay
She couldn't wait to get away
And I was stuck in the middle

He tried to work it out
But that's was hard 'cause she is an astronaut
He didn't know a thing
Mm..
And I was back what's all was happening
And I was stuck in the middle

He loved her so
But she was already gone, long ago
He really tried until the end
Mm..
She had him on back to attend
And I was stuck in the middle
I was stuck in the middle
I was stuck in the middle

She left him to be with me
We had a few things together but eventually
I understood what she was up to
It was planned from the beginning and the plan was carried through
oh oh oh oh..
And I'm still in the middle

I loved her so
But she was already gone, to the next in role
I really wanted her to stay
She couldn't wait to get away
And I was stuck in the middle

I loved her so
But she was already gone, long ago
I really tried until the end
She had him on back to attend
And I was stuck in the middle
I was struck in the middle
I was stuck in the middle
