		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Raping her and hacking Slashing Violated
I'm not sorry I don't care at all for what I did
You deserve everything you got
Disinclined Her fear is keeping me enticed
Her gateway of sin exposed for fornication
Get over your dysphagia
I see the moisture in your eyes is dehydrating
Your screaming vibrations
Only draw me nigh to rupturing climax
As she chokes and gargles spit
I amputate her salty clitoris
Cutting incisions while reaching climax
How can you expect me to let up
You deserve it
Give me your tongue
I wan to leave you an eternal taste of me
Let them know in hell
Why fight you'll just rue the day
That you try to escape the conscience of the dead
Hold your throat and pray for help
Take this oath to the grave and never let it out
Look in these eyes and endure the sleep you'll need
Before you awake to nothing
Fucked and left for dead
This is war Fight
I am bored But fulfilled
Please if you don't mind fulfill my passion
Gagging on my semen is required Swallow
Spread it on your face
Choke on the snot and reingest all of the foam
Take one final breath
I want to see what you have learned
And what you stand for
Choking and dryheaving
