		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The picture's far too big to look at, kid
Your eyes won't open wide enough
And you're constantly surrounded by the swirling stream
Of what is and what was
Well, we all made our predictions but the truth still isn't out
But if you wanna see the future, go stare into a cloud

And keep trying to find your way out of that maze of memories
It all sorta looks familiar
Until you get up close and then it's different, clearly
But each time you turn a corner, you're
You're right back where you were
And your only hope is that forgetting might make a door appear

Well, is it your fear of being buried that makes you so afraid to speak?
An avalanche of opinions, like the one that fell that I'm now underneath
It was my voice that moved the first rock, and I would do it all again
So I mean, it's cool if you keep quiet, but I like singing

So I'll be holding my note and stomping and strumming
And feeling so very lucky
And there is nothing I know, except this lifetime is one moment
And wishing will just leave me empty

So you can try and live in darkness but you will never shake the light
No, it will greet you every morning
And it will make you more aware with its absence at night
When you're wrapped up in your blankets, babe, that comfortable cocoon
But I've seen the day of your awakening, boy, and it's coming soon

So go ahead and lose yourself in liquor
And you can praise the clouded mind
But it isn't what you're thinking
No, it's the course of history, your position in line
You're just a piece of the puzzle, so
I think you'd better find your place
And don't go blaming your knowledge on some fruit you ate

'Cause there's been a great deal of discussion, yes
About the properties of man
Animal or Angel? You were carved from bone, but your heart, it's just sand
And the wind is gonna scatter it and cover everything with love
So if it makes you happy, then keep kneeling, mama, but I'm standing up

Because this veil, it has been lifted, yes
My eyes are wet with clarity
I've been a witness to such wonders
Oh, I've searched for them all across this country
But I think I'll be returning now
To the town where I was born
And I understand you must keep movin', friend
But I'm headed home

Yeah, I'm gonna follow the road
And let the scenery sweeping by easily enter my body
And I'll send you all this message in code
Under ground, over mountains, through forests and deserts and cities
Ah, ah, ah, all across electric wire, it's a baited line
Yeah, the hook's in deep, boys, theres no more time
So you can struggle in the water, be too stubborn to die
Or you could just let go and be lifted to the sky
