		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  [Chorus]
King Kong, king, king, king, king kong, king
King Kong, king, king, king, king Kong
If you hear before you see me [x3]
I got king kong in the trunk
King kong, king, king, king, king Kong, King
King Kong, King, King, King, King Kong
If you hear before you see me
I got King, I got King Kong

[Verse 1]
A yo this beat is bananas
A King Kong you can put 'em in the trunk of the McClaren
When we do it they fall off, fall off
When they look at my ride, you see the doors fall off
And the wheels look flat, trunk so heavy in the back
Got the speakers in the front, they be sitting on my lap
Got a bumper to the back, with the trunk weighing it down
Look they think it's a lowrider when they come from my town
That's a King Kong, in the trunk, that's the gorillas behind me
When I'm rolling through your hood anybody can find me
You can hear me from the next block
When I'm on the next block, when I'm headed to the next block
Got you jumping to the next block

[Chorus]
King Kong, king, king, king, king kong, king
King Kong, king, king, king, king Kong
If you hear before you see me [x3]
I got king kong in the trunk
King kong, king, king, king, king Kong, King
King Kong, King, King, King, King Kong
If you hear before you see me
I got King, I got King Kong

[Verse 2]
Lil' Momma got you stopping and dropping
When a man stop walking
So I told her she ain't talking about nothing, she just fronting
You can hear me from a block
And you already know what's up
With the women cause they feeling me how it rumble in the trunk

I got 50 speakers up in my trunk and I turned it up
And all the ladies loving how it be bumping
They can check it out, you can hear before you see me
I got beats up in the trunk
All the ladies want to chase me when they hear my system bump

Say Jibbs I'm about to head out to the Bruin
Holla at you about fedy, hit my celly soon as you ready
Count this cheese like a deli
They thought I was a lunatic when I pulled up to the telly
I had that candy coated chevy, showing it's grill like it's nelly
And the ladies love me why is that,
They love the way I be getting my lean on
Flip the diamond, and get a multi colored diamond bling on
That King Kong, yea I bet ya this gon' be the theme song
Cause that King Kong will have your ears ringing like a ring tone

[Chorus]
King Kong, king, king, king, king kong, king
King Kong, king, king, king, king Kong
If you hear before you see me [x3]
I got king kong in the trunk
King kong, king, king, king, king Kong, King
King Kong, King, King, King, King Kong
If you hear before you see me
I got King, I got King Kong

[Verse 3] 
Yea, yea, yea, yeah
Them boys is knockin', I got it on lock
Cause I make hits like I'm boxing
Start it up and it sound like a block hit it
Then a hater, hating inside, like don't pop with this
See the beats will beat, ya hear me before you see me
Before you even can reach me, it'll have ya thinking
That this boy is a beast in the streets
While ya blinking, have ya bopper looking like you been drinking
I'll eat ya, it's like I have speakers in my speakers
So when they speaking on it all they gon' speak of is a beaster boy
So don't make me just treat ya to a feast

A beast'll just beat off both of your ear drums

[Chorus]
King Kong, king, king, king, king kong, king
King Kong, king, king, king, king Kong
If you hear before you see me [x3]
I got king kong in the trunk
King kong, king, king, king, king Kong, King
King Kong, King, King, King, King Kong
If you hear before you see me
I got King, I got King Kong
