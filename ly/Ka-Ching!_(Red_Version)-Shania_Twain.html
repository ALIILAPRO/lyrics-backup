		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We live in a greedy little world,
That teaches every little boy and girl
To earn as much as they can possibly,
Then turn around and spend it foolishly
We've created us a credit card mess
We spend the money that we don't possess
Our religion is to go and blow it all
So it's shopping every Sunday at the mall
All we ever want is more
A lot more than we had before
So take me to the nearest store

Can you hear it ring
It makes you want to sing
It's such a beautiful thing, ka-ching
Lots of diamond rings
The happiness it brings
You'll live like a king
With lots of money and things

When you're broke, go and get a loan
Take out another mortgage on your home
Consolidate so you can afford
To go and spend some more when you get bored

All we ever want is more
A lot more than we had before
So take me to the nearest store

Can you hear it ring
It makes you want to sing
It's such a beautiful thing, ka-ching
Lots of diamond rings
The happiness it brings
You'll live like a king
With lots of money and things

Let's swing
Dig deeper in your pocket
Oh, yeah, ha
Come on, I know you've got it
Dig deeper in your wallet
Whoa

All we ever want is more
A lot more than we had before
So take me to the nearest store

Can you hear it ring
It makes you want to sing
It's such a beautiful thing, ka-ching
Lots of diamond rings
The happiness it brings
You'll live like a king
With lots of money and things

Can you hear it ring
It makes you want to sing
You'll live like a king
With lots of money and things
Ka-ching
