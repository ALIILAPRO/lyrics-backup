		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I waived the white flag, I gave all I had
I'd even given up on love itself, hmm
Soaked by my tears, I was choked by my fears
Just a stubborn man too proud to ask for help

You don't know those words you said
Were the ones that pulled me from the edge

Whoa, I used to walk on bridges with one thing on my mind
Do I wanna live or do I wanna die?
Staring at the waters while trying to decide
Between the pain that I've been living with or the pain I'd leave behind
Or the demons I've been fighting or the angels by my side
Yeah, yeah

The scars on my skin, they don't
Even begin to show the darkest places that I've been, no
The water is rising behind my eyes and 
Only you can see the thoughts I'm drowning in

I wanna thank you for those words you said
'Cause they pulled me right back from the edge

Whoa, I used to walk on bridges with one thing on my mind
Do I wanna live or do I wanna die?
Staring at the waters while trying to decide
Between the pain that I've been living with or the pain I'd leave behind
Or the demons I've been fighting or the angels by my side
Yeah, yeah
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh

Oh, I used to walk on bridges with one thing on my mind
But now I walk on bridges to reach the other side
