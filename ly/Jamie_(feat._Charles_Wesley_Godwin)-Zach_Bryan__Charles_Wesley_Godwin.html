		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There ain't much a war when it's 4:34
With the man you were before that bar door
No one loves you enough to give you a ride
And your car's sittin' right outside
Oh, Jamie

Keep your tires between the ditches
And your eyes peeled on the road
There's two more minutes before you're back home
Don't 103 feel so free? You always loved the revelry
Oh, Jamie

The flashing red and blue in a cracked rear view
He remembers the smile he once owned
But he ain't gonna stop for any cop
From here to damn near Wichita county

Well, I'll go tonight, boys
I don't mean no harm
I just miss my lovin' lady
And layin' in her arms

I'll go tonight, boys
I don't mean no harm
I just miss my lovin' lady
And layin' in her arms

'Cause there's a tombstone hidden in a place that he don't visit
Where the love of his life was laid to rest
He'll make it there by dusk
That is where they'll draw their guns
Oh, Jamie

'Cause this life ain't worth living
If the love that you've been given
Is taken before you are
Now Jamie is dancin'
And spinnin' around his baby in the stars

I'll go tonight, boys
I don't mean no harm
I just miss my lovin' lady
And layin' in her arms

I'll go tonight, boys
I don't mean no harm
I just miss my lovin' lady
And layin' in her arms

When it's late and it's cold on that old hidden road
You can hear laughter all in the trees
Don't 103 feel so free? You don't miss the revelry
Do ya, Jamie?
