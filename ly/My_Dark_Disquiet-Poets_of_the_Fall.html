		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Night, the world, it's mine, with nobody else out here
It's time, run wild and royally cavalier
To burn, ignite, I'd do it for so much less
When all is made clear there is nothing else

And here we stand, the sweet arresting duality
And I come to, it's resin all over me
Will I awake, will I get a ride with you
In this race of two

We're an endless stream of choices
We're the softest murmur of voices

Without names we're fantasising
Dancing like flames, mesmerising
My dark disquiet playing such eerie harmonies

Making waves and diving under
Lightning to the sound of thunder
My dark disquiet singing such haunting melodies

So white, so still, so bright, it's almost too painful now
I'm ready to fight, to run from the light

And here now comes the sweet corrupting reality
While now I'm free, will I once cease to be
Will I awake, will I get a ride with you
In this race of two

We are momentary masters
We're false kings and bastards

Without names we're fantasising…

We are marionettes by strings animated
Yet like lovers of strings liberated

Without names we're fantasising…

Brothers by blood separated
Marionettes animated
Lovers of strings liberated
