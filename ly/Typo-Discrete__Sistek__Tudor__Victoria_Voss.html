		  Fuck it come back

Into my life

You're what I need, that's what I don't like

You're just like my pills,

You keep me high

I'm fighting lows that only you can put right

 

I hate your lies,

But I love the way you say them

All day and night,

Your touch there’s no replacement

I wanna fight,

Maybe I love the chaos

Oh my god

 

You're like the typo

I can't rewrite so

I hit the backspace

Still want you back babe

Don't wanna read it,

I can't delete it

I hit the backspace

Still want you back babe

 

(Still want you back babe)

 

I hit the backspace

Still want you back babe

 

Crossing you out,

Out of my life

Was pretty hard, but I'll be alright

Our highs and lows

Like a fine line

I had to walk to keep us on the good side

 

Hate that I lied

But this time I had to face it

All day all night

You call and I can't take it

Don't wanna fight,

Baby I’m sick of chaos

Oh my god

 

You're like the typo

I can't rewrite so

I hit the backspace

Don't want you back babe

Don't wanna read it,

I can't delete it

I hit the backspace

Don't want you back babe

 

(Still want you back babe)

 

I hit the backspace

Still want you back babe

 

You're like the typo

I can’t rewrite so

I hit the backspace

Don’t want you back babe

Don't wanna read it,

I can't delete it

I hit the backspace

Still want you back babe

 

(Still want you back babe)

 

I hit the backspace

Still want you back babe
