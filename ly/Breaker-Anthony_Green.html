		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can feel it's gone, that alter in my soul.
To be collected.
Running﻿ up and down the walls of your nest.
It never ends. (it never ends)
To build it up again, we get high.
To see if I wanted in, (I can feel it's gone) we stand. (it never ends)
I don't wanna spend my whole life waiting, my whole life wondering when you'd come.
To see it for what it is
You lost all intent. We use to be such good friends.
Then you found a way out to break it down again. (I can feel its gone)
We get high. (It never ends)
And I don't wanna spend my whole life waiting, my whole life wondering when you'd come.
And I don't wanna spend my whole life waiting, my whole life wondering when you'd come.
To see if I wanted in, we gave up. We gave up our lives to be here.
Who else is waiting here? I'm lost inside of your world.
To break it down again,﻿ we get high.
To see if I wanted in (I can feel it's gone) We stand (it never ends)
Our eyes are barely open, our limitations gone.
And I don't wanna spend my whole life waiting, my whole life wondering when you would come
And I don't wanna spend my whole life waiting, my whole life wondering when you'd come. (you'd found a way out)
To see it for﻿ what it is, we gave up.
