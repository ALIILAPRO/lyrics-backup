		<p>
		  Yeah, hey

Pool in my eyes, as you beg I testify that
I hate being alone, but you finally got me out my zone
I know and I miss you
Know when I'm tripping, oh, yes it's difficult
Thank God I'm Christian
Remember how this all begun, just us
My mama said you was bad news, like "dun-dun-dun-dun"
You proved her right, every single night
Oh my, oh my, can't close my eyes
Can't open my eyes, don't know what to do
I'm in some kind of mood
You're so beautiful, you're so beautiful
We gotta listen to the old Kelly
You slipped out if you don't know already

Girl, I know you know already
Girl, I know you know already
Things are getting hot and heavy
Things are getting hot and heavy
Girl, I know you know already
Girl, I know you
Girl, I know you

Girl, I know you know already
What haven't we done before
What is not already mine?
Couldn't tell you what's not yours

You said that you think about me every day
Saturday to Saturday
You see that I've been going through it
Hoping everything's okay
I just want to let you know
Everything these days is textual
I just want to get a little sexual, with you
'Cause I remember way, way, back
With the waves under the wavecap
You were someone else's wife in fact
You didn't even look at me like that
Then it all just switched, over time
Step by step and you know what's next girl
I can't pretend

We gon' have to listen to some old Kelly
You slipped out if you don't know already
Girl, I know you know already
Girl, I know you know already
Things are getting hot and heavy
Things are getting hot and heavy
Girl, I know you know already
Girl, I know you know how it's gon' go down
I know you babe

Girl, I know you know already
What haven't we done before
What is not already mine?
Couldn't tell you what's not yours
Yeah, you know already

Six months since I've been back in the Six
I can't help but wonder how you've been babe

What are you on?
Gotta let me know something
What are you on?
Gotta let me know something
What are you on?
Gotta let me know something
Wonder how you've been

I've been out in Bel-Air like Will was
These streets got so familiar
Malibu coast where I meditate
Book a plane home then I hesitate
Scared to see what I left behind
It's weighing heavy on my mind and
I can't help but wonder how you've been babe

What are you on?
Gotta let me know something
What are you on?
Gotta let me know something
What are you on?
Gotta let me know something
Wonder how you've been, babe
