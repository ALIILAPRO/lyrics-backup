		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Crown the dark animal
Black Jackal crawling
Eternal returning
An end to the waiting
There are thrones underground
And monarchs upon them
They walk serene
In spaces between
At the head of the storm
Darkness is rising
In the Garden of Jaws
His wonds are shining
Angels take poisons
In rotting pavilions
Under shivering stars
The sickness is gilding.
