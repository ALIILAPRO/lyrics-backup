		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I left you out in the English rain
To soak you through and dilute the blame
Don't ever want to hear those words today

You made me high then you swooped so low
From a hummingbird to a silent crow
I was on your side but then I saw it change

I always used to love November
But now it always floods with rain
Oh how can I forgive?
Those words will stain forever

I left you out in the English rain
To soak you through and dilute the blame
Don't ever want to hear those words today

You made me high then you swooped so low
From the hummingbird to a silent crow
I was on your side but then I saw it change

I always used to love November
But now it always floods with rain
I always used to love November
But now it always floods with rain
Oh how can I forgive?
Those words will stain forever

I always used to love November
But now it always floods with rain
I always used to love November
But now it always floods with rain
Oh how can I forgive?
Those words will stain forever
