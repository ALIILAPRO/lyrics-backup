		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I really wanna tell you how my day went how my day went
Really want to spend the weekend babe
I for show you this thing I'm feeling oh yeah
But I don't really know you that well

I really wanna kiss you in the face babe In the face baby
And maybe every other place baby
E be like say I no remember say I
Say I no really know you that well

Aye aye we can go there if you If I
Want to but me I don't know oh no
Why I think I love you
When I don't really know you that well
Aye aye we can go there if you If I
Want to but me I don't know oh no
Why I think I love you
When I don't really know you that well

I'm too polite to insult your intelligence why
Do I believe that we have met maybe not in this life
Time's frozen for a second so I'm thinking tonight
We break the ice or better still we can set it aside
Temporarily my temperature is telling me
That you got me so hot stop girl there is no remedy I
But you don't know me well enough to reply
And I don't really know you that well
It's funny you have something in your teeth
But would you try to stop me if I want to take it out
Cause you don't know me properly
Girl I think you lovely but you turn this bad boy into a busy body
I see you're too busy for me yeah right
Or maybe I'm just busy forming nah
Will you call me when you're ready for me
It's crazy baby
How I don't care at all
That I don't really know you that well

I really wanna tell you how my day went how my day went
Really want to spend the weekend babe
I for show you this thing I'm feeling oh yeah
But I don't really know you that well

I really wanna kiss you in the face babe in the face baby
And maybe every other place baby
E be like say I no remember say I
Say I no really know you that well

Aye aye we can go there if you If I
Want to but me I don't know oh no
Why I think I love you
When I don't really know you that well know you that well
Aye aye we can go there if you If I
Want to but me I don't know oh no
Why I think I love you
When I don't really know you that well

So you be my controller
See me see this paroller
I just wanna come home to you
Spend every night telling bad jokes to you
Be my boyfriend I'll be up in my boyfriend jeans
Have a baby with my boyfriend genes
If you were my boyfriend I'll be up in my boyfriend dreams
But I don't really know you that well

I wanna grow old with you
Do this life with you
Ride or die for you
But I don't really know you that well

I really wanna tell you how my day went how my day went
Really want to spend the weekend babe
I for show you this thing I'm feeling oh yeah
But I don't really know you that well

I really wanna kiss you in the face babe In the face baby
And maybe every other place baby
E be like say I no remember say I
Say I no really know you that well

Aye aye we can go there if you If I
Want to but me I don't know oh no
Why I think I love you
When I don't really know you that well know you that well
Aye aye we can go there if you If I
Want to but me I don't know oh no
Why I think I love you
When I don't really know you that well
Ay ya ya ya yai
No no
Ay ya ya ya yai
I don't really know know
Ay ya ya ya yai
But you knew that
Ay ya ya ya yai
