		<p>
		  Turn it up
Yeah

I'm working hard, you're working too
We do it every day
For every minute I have to work
I need a minute of play
Day in, day out, all week long
Things go better with rock
The only time I turn it down
Is when I'm sleepin' it off

Turn up the radio
I need the music, gimmie some more
Turn up the radio
I want to feel it, got to gimmie some more

Now listen
I want to shake, I wanna dance
So count it off, one, two, three
I feel the beat, I'm in a trance
No better place to be
Daytime nighttime, anytime
Things go better with rock
I'm goin' twenty-four hours a day
I can't seem to stop

Turn up the radio
I need the music, gimmie some more
Turn up the radio
I want to feel it, got to gimmie some more
Turn up the radio
I want to feel it, got to gimmie some more

Turn up the radio
I need the music, gimmie some more (yeah)
Turn up the radio
I want to feel it, got to gimmie some more (whoa)
Turn up the radio (come on)
I need the music, gimmie some more (everybody)

Turn up the radio (turn it up)
I want to feel it, got to gimmie some more (woo)
Turn up the radio (turn it up)
I need the music, gimmie some more (gimmie some more)
Turn up the radio (woo, come on)
I want to feel it, got to gimmie some more (gimmie all you got)
Turn up
