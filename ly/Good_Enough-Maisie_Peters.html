		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I guess I took it for granted
You'd bury me someday
All the big plans that I planted
While you planned your own escape
Never thought I was the greatest
But I was great for you
Just assumed I was your favorite
With no one else to choose

I try to kiss your face, you turn away
No one ever taught me the protocol
What do you do when the good guys change their mind?

'Cause I used to think that if I tried my best I'd always win
But I'll sit in your favorite dress and ask you where you've been
People don't leave people if they really are in love
I was good, just wasn't good enough
I was good, just wasn't good enough

There were four eyes in the garden
Two cried but two looked down
Now you're asking for a pardon
'Cause I'm a good time pound for pound
And you say this was a hard one
But lately you felt stuck
And I thought I was first place
But I was runner up

I try to kiss your face, you turn away
No one ever taught me the protocol
What do you do when the good guys change their mind?

'Cause I used to think that if I tried my best I'd always win
But I'll sit in your favorite dress and ask you where you've been
People don't leave people if they really are in love
I was good, just wasn't good enough
I was good, just wasn't good enough

I never said I was perfect
Just thought I was perfect for you
But all that was worthless
'Cause if I couldn't be one, I wouldn't ever be two
Thought I was the way home
But I was an obstacle to move
I never said I was perfect
Like you

'Cause I used to think that if I tried my best I'd always win
But I'll sit in your favorite dress and wonder how you've been
And did you ever mean it when you said you were in love?
I was good, just wasn't good enough
I was good, just wasn't good enough
I was good, just wasn't good enough
