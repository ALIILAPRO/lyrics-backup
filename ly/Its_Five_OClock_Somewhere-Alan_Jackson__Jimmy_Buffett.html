		  The sun is hot and that old clock is movin' slow and so am I
Workday passes like molasses in wintertime, but it's July
I'm gettin' paid by the hour, and older by the minute
My boss just pushed me over the limit
I'd like to call him somethin', I think I'll just call it a day

Pour me somethin' tall and strong
Make it a Hurricane before I go insane
It's only half past twelve, but I don't care
It's five o'clock somewhere

Well this lunch break is gonna take all afternoon and half the night
Tomorrow morning I know there'll be hell to pay, hey, but that's all right
I ain't had a day off now in over a year
My Jamaican vacation's gonna start right here
If the phone's for me, you can tell 'em I just sailed away

And pour me somethin' tall and strong
Make it a Hurricane before I go insane
It's only half past twelve, but I don't care
It's five o'clock somewhere

I could pay off my tab
Pour myself in a cab and be back to work before two
At a moment like this, I can't help but wonder
What would Jimmy Buffett do?

Funny you should ask Alan 
I'd say, "Pour me somethin' tall and strong
Make it a Hurricane before I go insane
It's only half past twelve but I don't care"
Pour me somethin' tall and strong
Make it a Hurricane before I go insane
It's only half past twelve but I don't care
He don't care
And I don't care
It's five o'clock somewhere

What time zone am I on? What country am I in?
It doesn't matter, it's five o'clock somewhere
It's always on five in Margaritaville, come to think of it
I heard that
You been there haven't you?
Yes sir
I've seen your boat there
I've been to Margaritaville a few times
All right, well that's good
Stumbled my way back
Okay, well we just wanna make sure you can keep it between the navigational beacons
Between the buoys, I tell you
All right, well, it's five o'clock, let's go somewhere
I'm ready, crank it up
Let's get out of here
I'm gone
