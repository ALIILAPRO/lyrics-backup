		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What you doing with my head?
I may let you go ahead
But you gotta do it right, right, right
Show me that you'll make us spin
If I let you try again
Boy, you gotta do it right, right, right

Oh
Come on over
Oh
Let's get together
Come on, turn the lights down
See there's no rewind now
Let's cross the line
Show me yours, I'll show you mine

Just do it right (all night)
Do it right (all night)
Do it right (all night)
All night, all night
Do it right (all night)
Do it right (all night)
Do it right (all night)
All night, all night

Do it right
Do it right
Do it right
All night, all night
Do it right
Do it right
Do it right
All night, all night
Do it, do it

Yeah, show me if you make my head spinnin'
When you do it, do it right, right, right
Baby, if I let you try again
Gotta do it, do it right, right, right
All night, yeah

Oh
Come on over
Oh
Let's get together
Come on, turn the lights down
See there's no rewind now
Let's cross the line
Show me yours, I'll show you mine

Just do it right (do it)
Do it right (do it)
Do it right (do it)
All night, all night
Do it right (do it)
Do it right (do it)
Do it right (do it)
All night, all night

Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
What you doing with my head?
I may let you go ahead
But you gotta do it right, right, right
Show me that you'll make us spin
If I let you try again
