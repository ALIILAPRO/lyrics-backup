		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Try to change your mind, it's like the weather
And you don't make my heart beat like you used to
I've been waiting for a sign, you've been turning on your light

We could save each other for the better
And when you say my name I'll be a memory
This is all that we have planned, choices taken from our hands

Finally this fades to stand alone

My mind is a runaway
And I'll find it's too hard to breathe
Just say what you want to say
Are you there?
Tell me, are you there?
I fear these growing pains
That made us far too strong
Do change if you want to change
Are you there?
Tell me, are you there?

You could lose yourself and search forever
Looking for the person that you'll never be
Breathe in, try to compensate, time to learn from our mistakes

Maybe one day we'll fit back together
I'll pick up the pieces and will rearrange
Now we need to follow fate, now we look beyond the way

Now we find the strangers and the lone

My mind is a runaway
And I'll find it's too hard to breathe
Just say what you want to say
Are you there?
Tell me, are you there?
I fear these growing pains
That made us far too strong
Do change if you want to change
Are you there?
Tell me, are you there?

We've been changing into something more
Familiar faces turning into storm
These growing pains have made us far too strong
We move along, we move along

I'll find it's too hard to breathe
Say what you want to say
Are you there?
Tell me, are you there?
My mind is a runaway
And I'll find it's too hard to breathe
Just say what you want to say
Are you there?
Tell me, are you there?
I fear these growing pains
That made us far too strong
Do change if you want to change
Are you there?
Tell me, are you there?
My mind is a runaway
And I'll find it's too hard to breathe
Just say what you want to say
Are you there?
Tell me, are you there?
I fear these growing pains
That made us far too strong
Do change if you want to change
Are you there?
Tell me, are you there?
