		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I’ve been tempted to lose ya
Plus you keep dashing all this salt on my wounds, ya
Don’t make It easy for me answer the phone, ya
Best try and talk it out
Not tryna’ wash it down
Give me something
Give me something so I know you hear me
Even with these fences rigged I always feel you near me
Its been me against the world
Don’t be the one to tear me
Is this avoidable, might need a miracle
I’ve been tempted to lose ya
Plus you keep dashing all this salt on my wounds, ya
Don’t make It easy for me answer the phone, ya
Best try and talk it out
Not tryna’ wash it down
Give me something
Lose ya
Lose ya
Lose ya
Give me something
Don’t wanna’
Lose ya
Lose ya
Lose ya
You act like you know it all
Then you go humble for a bit goin’ through withdrawals
I'm on the phone with you the temperature takin’ off
No control over yourself
Fuck I heard it all
I’ve been tempted to lose ya
Plus you keep dashing all this salt on my wounds, ya
Don’t make It easy for me answer the phone, ya
Best try and talk it out
Not tryna’ wash it down
Give me something
I’ve been tempted to lose ya
Plus you keep dashing all this salt on my wounds, ya
Don’t make It easy for me answer the phone, ya
Best try and talk it out
Not tryna’ wash it down
Give me something
