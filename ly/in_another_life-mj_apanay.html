		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been thinking of the times when
We'd stay up all night you'd tell me your stories
But you'd fall asleep way before me
So I'd watch you through my phone and
Tell you you're the only one that I need 'cause
It's easier to say when you're sleepin'

Sometimes I think I still need closure
But it's been years since we've been over

So I'm letting go this time
I'm leavin' everything behind
But I'm gonna hold you close and tight
And I'm gonna love you 'till I die
In another life

I've made one too many mistakes but 
I still tried to make it better
But I know I can't change the weather 
So I just tried to numb the hurtin'
But I made it worse and worse
I lied and I tricked you
And you left my life now I miss you

I know I shouldn't think about you
But deep down it hurts to be without you

So I'm letting go this time
I'm leavin' everything behind
But I'm gonna keep this love alive
And I'm gonna keep you by my side
In another life

I'm gonna be the one to find you
Cross every mountain and every sea
I'll be the one who's gonna hold you
Be the guy that I know I could never be

But maybe I'll make the same mistakes I made instead
So maybe we should never meet again

So I'll let these tears run dry
And I'll just leave this love behind
But I can't forget what's deep inside
So I hope I meet you one more time
In another life
