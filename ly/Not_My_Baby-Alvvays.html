		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now that you're not my baby
I'll go do whatever I want
No need to turn around to see what's behind me
I don't care
And it's true, I've been checking out lately
I go do whatever I want
No need to turn around to see what's behind me
I don't care

Because I'm really not there
I'm really not there

And now that you're not my baby
I'll go do whatever I want
No need to sit at home with the dial tone
'Cause I don't care
And it's true, I've been going out lately
And I go do whatever I want
You can write it down with a fountain pen
Close your eyes and then count to ten
You can tell your friends that I don't make sense
And I don't care

Because I'm really not there
I'm really not there

The night is like a fading radio
The lake was frozen over long ago

Now that you're not my baby
(Now you're not)
Now that you're not my baby
(Now you're not)

You sought an eye
So did I for an island
You sought an eye
So did I for an eye
Traded my rose-coloured shades for a wide lens
Used to make noise, now, I much prefer silence

Now that you're not my baby
(Now you're not)
Now that you're not my baby
(Now you're not)
Now that you're not my baby
(Now you're not)
Now that you're not my baby
(Now you're not)

I feel alive for the first time
Since I don't know how long
I see a light for the first time
Since I don't know how long
