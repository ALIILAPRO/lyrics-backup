		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you loved me, I'm sure that you would know 
Wouldn't be so easy for you to let me go 
If you loved me, you'd put away your pride 
And put some love inside, and hold it there forever 
 
If you loved me, if you ever did before 
You could find those feelings, and feel them all once more 
If you loved me, that love would pull us through 
You'd do all you could do to keep that love together 
 
You had me walkin' on a rainbow that vanished at my feet 
Now that it's over, I see the truth my heart refused to see 
 
If you loved me the way I love you from the start 
Wouldn't be so easy for you to break my heart 
If you loved me, you'd give it one more try 
You wouldn't let it die, you'd hold me close forever 
 
If you loved me 
If you loved me 
If you loved me like I love you
