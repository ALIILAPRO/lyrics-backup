		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You have some daddy issues
It's not like that's an issue
The way you look at me it's almost like I have to kiss you
I've fuckin' had it with dramatics
Show the passion in you
Crashing into walls onto the floor
There is no passive in you
Push me, shove me
I don't wanna have no gushy loving
Make it hot till your makeup's coming off your face but
Baby you aren't looking ugly
Hit me, punch me
Give me more baby this is nothing
Feel the sweat on your forehead soaking all of your bed
When we're fucking
I feel your nails in my back
Punish me for my past
Like how you're making it last
If you're gonna hurt me, hurt me
I feel your nails in my back
I feel your nails in my back
The best ones are bad for me
In love with agony
I guess it's my fate that I'm a catastrophe
Inside your galaxy I fight this gravity
Me and you are such a beautiful tragedy
I want and need your constant evil
Ripping off your top that's see through
Climbing up on top of me
Oh God you're being far from peaceful
I'ma leave here bruised and bloody
Use me till my use is nothing
You don't wanna leave
So I can tell that you're not used to coming
I feel your nails in my back
Punish me for my past
Like how you're making it last
If you're gonna hurt me, hurt me
I feel your nails in my back
I feel your nails in my back
I feel your nails in my back
I feel your nails in my back
You're an angel
If you say so
But you have horns for a halo
Dark and twisted
We're sadistic
Can you heal my sickness?
You're an angel
If you say so
But you have horns for a halo
Dark and twisted
We're sadistic
Can you heal my sickness?
I feel your nails in my back
I feel your nails in my back
I feel your nails in my back
I feel your nails in my back
I feel your nails in my
