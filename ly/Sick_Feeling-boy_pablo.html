		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I had to catch the bus
Alarm was shaking, oh
Almost landed on the floor
So ready for you then
To leave where some may stay
What was I waiting for?

What a sick, sick feeling
To let you go, my dear
'Cause I was not prepared to
Let you go, let you go

I used to turn you on
I used to be by your side
And now the rest is leaving me behind

I miss the way you sound
I miss to be around you
Just let me have another chance

What a sick, sick feeling
To let you go, my dear
'Cause I was not prepared to
Let you go, let you go

What a sick, sick feeling
To let you go, my dear
'Cause I was not prepared to
Let you go
