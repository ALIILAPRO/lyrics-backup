		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm in your head, tell me what you said
So you want me right now?
Do you want me dead?
It's in my mind, all the ways she bled
And no I'm not fine, I think that I'm next
Tell me how you feel, baby what's the deal?
Tell me how you feel, baby is this real?
See it in your eyes, are we wasting time?
I don't wanna go now, I don't wanna die
I'm in your head tell me what you said
Do you want me right now?
Do you want me dead?

Whiteface, so I call late
On this side, where your heartache
I don't want life, when my heart ache
I don't want life, when my- yuh
Fuck the profit, split that on your bags
Fuckas role it back
30 cash they throw it back
Faces comin' fast
Wonder why they never last
All mistakes I ever had you can have em back
Never gave a fuck as long as I'm alive
I know how to save it, but I don't like
Pull up on my side, where they double time
Bullet for my cries
Ain't this what you like?
Bullet for my cried
Ain't this what you like?
Blacked off, fuck ya sad talk
Hands out like he handcuffed
Hands out like he handcuffed

I'm in your head, tell me what you said
So you want me right now?
Do you want me dead?
It's in my mind, all the ways she bled
And no I'm not fine, I think that I'm next
Tell me how you feel, baby what's the deal?
Tell me how you feel, baby is this real?
See it in your eyes, are we wasting time?
I don't wanna go now, I don't wanna die
I'm in your head tell me what you said
Do you want me right now?
Do you want me dead?
