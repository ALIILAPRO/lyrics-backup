		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Esta noche no quiero hablar, no
Baby, aléjate de mi
3.5 y un par de tragos
Just to hide what's underneath
I'm starting to question if it's right or wrong, don't know
Solo quiero ser feliz
Pero tú no me va' dejar, no
No tengo na' mas que decir
Ooh, cause every time we talk it feels like I'm the only person in the world
And you don't seem to care enough to listen when I speak and that shit hurts, woah
Te quiero y tú lo sabes, it's the hardest when you got nowhere to turn, woah
Porque aunque quiera, mi corazón no me deja, I just hope I die first
Hoy ya no quiero pensar, no
On all the issues that you bring
And usually yo los dejo pasar, woah
But lately I ain't had time to rethink, woah
So dale, has lo que tú quieras
Oh, I can't believe you said that
I'm out here tryna figure out just where my head's at
And you know fucking up is what we're best at
Pero si supieras to' lo que pasé to be with you
Oh, I'm trying my best to keep it true
But I don't care, as much as I should or as much as you
Cause every time we talk it feels like I'm the only person in the world
And you don't seem to care enough to listen when I speak and that shit hurts, woah
Te quiero y tú lo sabes, it's the hardest when you got nowhere to turn, woah
And if I could, I know I probably never would
I just hope I die first, woah
