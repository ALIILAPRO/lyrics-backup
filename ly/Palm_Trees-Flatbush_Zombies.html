		  So much grams, unzip the bag
Dip in my hand, then I palm trees
So when you throw shade
It could never harm me
(So when you throw shade
It could never harm me)
So much grams, unzip the bag
Dip in my hand, then I palm trees
So when you throw shade
It could never harm me
(So when you throw shade
It could never harm me)

Lions don't lose sleep over
The 'pinion of sheep
On the road to the riches
Money sticking to my cleats
I am moi, magnifique, skin noir, Darky Meech
Niggas with the most opinions
Usually have the least
It's funny how now rappers be
On their druggy shit
Downloaded my tape, sat back, studied shit
Acid pack a hundred hit's
Shroom caps and hash bricks
Trippy like that Destiny Child chick on 106
This white bitch had the fucking nerve
To call me a nigga
When she the one paying the surgeon
For her lips to get bigger
Do you get the bigger
Picture? Shit is backwards, my nigga
You sneak dissing, taking jabs
Get your boxing on
Cause you ain't get the word
I'm Glock Lesnar in the octagon
This shit is straight absurd
Do not hate me cause your life is shitty
I show no pity, you turd
You better off in the dirt
Now you better off dead
Like the title of my work
So much grams, unzip the bag
Dip in my hand, then I palm trees
So when you throw shade
It could never harm me
(So when you throw shade
It could never harm me)
So much grams, unzip the bag
Dip in my hand, then I palm trees
So when you throw shade
It could never harm me
(So when you throw shade
It could never harm me)

Every day me and Mary Jane
You might say I'm addicted, but me
I'm truly lifted
Stoned so loud, you can hear me in the crowd
Smoking girl scout, sour by the ounce
Mary never cheat me
Mary not a backstabbing bitch that'll
Lie and deceive me
Spread it even, even, hash wax in the evening
Dab or die trying, on the road to Zion
Damn, they try and stick me for my paper
They trying to take me under
I've seen it through the vapors
Jealous ones still envy
Got a couple real with me
And my bitch will talk some shit
And smoke the kil' with me
Meech will hide the body
Enough of that though
They saying talk is cheap
So I'll be smiling when we meet
They screaming "Zombies!" out in England
But I'm on the block with Mary
Pushing and dreaming
Ah ah ah, I'm feeling myself
Thizzle, fo' shizzle, my nizzle
Spitting riddles on instrumentals
Trippy life, blotter in the night
Fill my appetite (Fill my appetite)
So much grams, unzip the bag
Dip in my hand, then I palm trees
So when you throw shade
It could never harm me
(So when you throw shade
It could never harm me)

Could be your mans, or be your fan
Or be your kin
Pay your dues, man, I gotta choose
Whether I lose or win this
Foe or friend, can't determine the difference
The instance they see you peaking
They pussy be leaking fluid
My nigga, what is you doing
All black in the back of a Buick
I'm proving I'm sadistic as sin
As I'm making murderous music
We don't rep the same things, nah
Don't bother confuse it
So much stressing on my brain
Momma think I'ma lose it human vagabond
Hoes that stow they panties in my carry on
Why you hating niggas acting nonchalant
(Honest, brah)
Fuck your publication that say
I'm a third wheel architect build your mind
Set stress but won't swell
Oh yes, I smoke kill, I'm crack
You smoke krills
I pack, you dope deal, in fact, I'm so chill
I'm never off the pivot
Six stitches to your image
Not offended when you call me genius
All that means is

So much grams, unzip the bag
Dip in my hand, then I palm trees
So when you throw shade
It could never harm me
(So when you throw shade
It could never harm me)
So much grams, unzip the bag
Dip in my hand, then I palm trees
So when you throw shade
It could never harm me
(So when you throw shade
It could never harm me)
