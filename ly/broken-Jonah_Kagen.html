		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm broken
Tell you I'm fine
But you wouldn't believe me
If you knew the things that crossed my mind
And I'm hurting
But I show no sign
'Cause I'm afraid to give in
Break down, and waste your time

(One, two, three)

Now I'm begging you
To come and pull me out the fire
Come and save me
Like you did when we were young
Oh, please come bring me out
From my lowest, take me higher
Can you see me
Through the ashes and the smoke?

I'm lonely
It's been so long
Since I felt love
To smile, felt strong
And what can I do?
When I'm not friends with my reflection
When I don't understand affection like you do

(One, two, three)

I'm begging you
To come and pull me out the fire
Come and save me
Like you did when we were young
Oh, please come bring me out
From my lowest, take me higher
Can you see me
Through the ashes and the smoke?

You say that you'll help me
You tell me I'm worth it
But I don't deserve it
I don't deserve it
It's easy for you
'Cause you know your perfect
And I need your hand
But I don't want to burn it
There's blood on the counter
And tears on the pages
While I write you a letter
And then I quickly erase it
I'm shatter and beat down
Broken and weak now

So I'm begging you
To come and pull me out the fire
Come quickly
'Cause I'm burning up inside
Oh, please just bring me up
From my lowest, take me higher
Can you see me
Through the ashes and the smoke?

Pull me out
Pull me out
Pull me out
