		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're made of my rib or baby
You're made of my sin
And I can't tell where
Your lust ends
And where your love begins 

I didn't want to hurt you baby
I didn't want to hurt you
I didn't want to hurt you
But you're pretty when you cry 

And the moon gives me
Permission and I enter
Through her eyes
She's losing her virginity and
All her will to compromise 

I didn't want to hurt you baby
I didn't want to hurt you
I didn't want to hurt you
But you're pretty when you cry 

I didn't want to fuck you baby
I didn't want to fuck you
I didn't want to fuck you
But you're pretty
When you're mine 

I didn't really love you baby
I didn't really love you
I didn't really love you
But I'm pretty when I lie 

You hurt me baby
I hurt you baby 

If you knew how much I love you
You would run away
But when I treat you bad
It always makes you want to stay 

I didn't want to hurt you baby
I didn't want to hurt you baby
I didn't want to hurt you baby
I didn't want to hurt you baby
