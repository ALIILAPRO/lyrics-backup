		<p>
		  We can do it
We can do it
We can do it
I can love you, baby
We can do it
We can do it
I can love you, baby

Tell you something you need to know
I still love you
So baby, don't go
Candid changes
Don't waste any time
We can do it
We can do it, baby

Now I've been seeing you for so long
Something so special
There's nothing wrong
Oh, I can change it
We can make it
We can do it
We can do it baby

Ain't no problem that we can't solve
Ain't no worries we won't resolve
But we can do it
We can do it
Get in with it
I can love you, baby

We can do it
I can prove it
We can do it
I can love you, baby
We can do it
Don't you quit it
Get in with it
I can love you, baby

Don't need money
I've got a smile
Summer lovin'
I'm feelin' fine
We're supercruising
Oh yeah
We can do it
We can do it, baby

Check me honey
Down on the floor
Giving everything I've got
'Cause you give me more
Oh, we can do it
I can do it
I can love you
I can love you, baby

We can do it
I can prove it
We can do it
I can love you, baby
We can do it
Don't you quit it
Get in with it
I can love you, baby

Sometimes my world is shaking
And I can't hold on
We've got to find a way to move along

We can do it
I can prove it
We can do it
I can love you, baby
We can do it
We can do it
Get in with it

Baby, don't go
There ain't no problem we can't solve
Don't ya know
Honey don't go
There ain't no problem we can't solve
Don't ya know, baby
We're supercrusing yeah, oh
We're supercrusing yeah, oh
We're supercrusing yeah, oh
