		<p>
		  Don't do it to me
Don't do it to me (Oh, no, no, oh, no, no)
Don't do it to me (Oh, no, no, oh, no, no)
Don't do it to me (Oh, no, no, oh, no, no)
Don't do it to me (Oh, no, no, oh, no, no)


Focused, I'm focused
She got a body like that, I ain't never seen nothin' like that, uh-uh
Like a fantasy in front of me, yeah
I think that somethin' special is goin' down
That's right, I think she foreign (Foreign)
I think she foreign (Foreign), got passports
Mi amor ('Mor) started slow (Slow), got faster
She gon' work some more (More), work some more (More)
No stoppin' her now (Now, now)
No stoppin' her now (Now, now, now, now)

Then she started dancing, sexual romancin'
Nasty but she fancy, lipstick on my satin sheets
What's your nationality? I wonder if there's more of you
She's got my attention, she's confident
