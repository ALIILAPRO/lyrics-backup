		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Open up
Feel the waves cut through me
Hypnotized
By the sounds I'm breathing in

Hold tight, hold tight
Chemicals collide
Hold tight, hold tight
Hold tight

Dripping lights
Paint the skies
All because of you
Dripping lights
Paint the skies
Only you

Can make me move
You, you, can make me move
Can make me move
You, you, can make me move
Can make me

You, you, can make me move
Can make me

So alive
Make it last forever
Stopping time
Yeah, I'm surrendering

Hold tight, hold tight
Chemicals collide
Hold tight, hold tight
Hold tight

Dripping lights
Paint the skies
All because of you
Dripping lights
Paint the skies
Only you

Can make me move
You, you, can make me move
Can make me move
(Can make me move, yeah)
You, you, can make me move
Can make me
