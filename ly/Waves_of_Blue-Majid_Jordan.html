		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wanna hold you close (close)
Don't wanna let you go
Be with you night and day (day)
'Cause I've been feeling so low
Don't have to ask me twice (twice)
You really take me there
I wanna touch your light (light)
I wanna breathe in your air

I'll be holding you tight
When the night is through

We'll be riding the tide in the sky so alive
On waves of blue (waves of blue)
I'm in love with the thought of being in love
In love with you (love with you)
You can bring me along for the rest of your life
If you wanted to (wanted to)
We'll be riding the tide in the sky so alive
On waves of blue (waves of blue)
I'm in love with the thought of being in love
In love with you (love with you)
Being in love with you (love with you)
Being in love with you (love with you)
On waves of blue (waves of blue)

When the night is young (young)
Tell me something so sweet
Wanna hear your song (song)
Wanna dance to your heartbeat
Don't have to ask me twice (twice)
You really take me there
I wanna touch your light (light)
I wanna breathe in your air

I'll be holding you tight
When the night is through

We'll be riding the tide in the sky so alive
On waves of blue (waves of blue)
I'm in love with the thought of being in love
In love with you (love with you)
You can bring me along for the rest of your life
If you wanted to (wanted to)
We'll be riding the tide in the sky so alive
On waves of blue (waves of blue)
I'm in love with the thought of being in love
In love with you (love with you)
Being in love with you (love with you)
Being in love with you (love with you)
On waves of blue (waves of blue)

Being in love with you (love with you)
Being in love with you (love with you)
Being in love with you (love with you)
On waves of blue (waves of blue)

You're no good for me
You got what I need
I just wanna be with you
I just wanna be with you, be with you
You're no good for me
You got what I need
I just wanna be with you
I just wanna be with you, be with you

I'll be holding you tight (tight)
I'll wait this through
Yeah

We'll be riding the tide in the sky so alive
On waves of blue (waves of blue)
Being in love with you (love with you)
Being in love with you (love with you)
On waves of blue (waves of blue)
Being in love with you (love with you)
Being in love with you (love with you)
Being in love with you (love with you)
On waves of blue (waves of blue)

You're no good for me
You got what I need
I just wanna be with you
I just wanna be with you, be with you
