		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Thank God it's Friday
Gonna turn it up
Let's mix the bad
And the good
And forget about what we should
Cause it's Friday
And I like it hot
Cubes of ice
In the glass
Heating up with every touch

If you like to play
If you like to play, then I am the game
Watch out what I say
I don't know the rules and pour champagne
Champagne

Thank God it's Friday
Gonna turn it up
Let's mix the bad
And the good
And forget about what we should
Cause it's Friday
And I like it hot
Cubes of ice
In the glass
Heating up with every touch

Yeah, it's Friday
Friday, ey ey
It's Friday
Friday, ey ey ey ey
Thank God it's Friday
Friday, ey ey
It's Friday
Friday, ey ey ey ey

Who cares about Monday? Tuesday?
Wednesday, baby
When the view is hazy
Be a little crazy
Love-blind
Don't mind
Reckless
Divine
Yeah, maybe
We're good at being hasty

If you like to play
If you like to play, then I am the game
Watch out what I say
I don't know the rules and pour champagne
Champagne


Thank God it's Friday
Gonna turn it up
Let's mix the bad
And the good
And forget about what we should
Cause it's Friday
And I like it hot
Cubes of ice
In the glass
Heating up with every touch
Yeah, it's Friday
Friday, ey ey
It's Friday
Friday, ey ey ey ey
Thank God it's Friday
Friday, ey ey
It's Friday
Friday, ey ey ey ey

Thank God it's Friday
Gonna turn it up
Let's mix the bad
And the good
And forget about what we should
Cause it's Friday
And I like it hot
Cubes of ice
In the glass
Heating up with every touch
