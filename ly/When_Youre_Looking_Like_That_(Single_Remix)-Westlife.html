		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When you're looking like that, yeah, yeah

She's a 5 foot 10 in catsuit and Bambi eyes
Everybody's who's staring wouldn't believe that this girl was mine
I should've known I was wrong when I left her for a life in pity
But they say you never miss the water until it's gone

Guess I failed to love you
And you're taking it out tonight

Am I supposed to leave you now
When you're looking like that?
I can't believe what I just gave away
Now I can't take it back
I don't want to get lost
I don't want to live my life without you
Am I supposed to leave you now
When you're looking like that

She's all dressed up for glamour and rock and roll
Want to squeeze her real tight get out of this place
If only I could take control
But she's out of my reach forever
And just a week ago she lied next to me
It's so ironic how I had to lose just to see

That I failed to love you
And you're taking it out tonight

Am I supposed to leave you now
When you're looking like that?
I can't believe what I just gave away
Now I can't take it back
I don't want to get lost
I don't want to live my life without you
Am I supposed to leave you now
When you're looking like that?

I don't wanna forget you
I don't even wanna try
How'm I supposed to walk on by when you're looking like that?

How am I supposed to leave you now (when you're looking like that)
I can't believe what I just gave away (oh no, babe)
'Cause I can't take it back, I'm lost
I don't wanna live my life without you (live my life without you)
Am I supposed to leave you now
When you're looking like that?
Am I supposed to leave you now
When you're looking like that? (Oh yeah, oh no)
I can't believe what I just gave away
Now I can't take it back
I don't want to get lost (lost)
I don't want to live my life without you
Am I supposed to leave you now
Am I supposed to leave you now (when you're looking like that?)
Am I supposed to leave you now
When you're looking like that? (When you're looking like that?) 
I can't believe what I just gave away
Now I can't take it back ('cause I can't take it back)
I don't want to get lost (I don't want to live my life without you)
I don't want to live my life without you
Am I supposed to leave you now
When you're looking like that?
