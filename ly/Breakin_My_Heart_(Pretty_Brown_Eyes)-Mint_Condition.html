		  Pretty
Brown
Eyes

Pretty brown eyes 
You know I see you 
It's a disguise the way you treat me (the way you treat me) (pretty brown eyes)
You keep holding on 
To your thoughts of rejection 
If you're with me you're secured 
You keep telling me 
That your time is always taken 
But I keep seeing you out alone (out alone) (pretty brown eyes)
Listen to love 
Your heart is pounding with desire 
Waiting to be unleashed 

Quit breakin' my heart 
Breakin' my heart, yeah (pretty brown eyes)
Breakin' my heart, yeah
Breakin' my heart, sugar, yeah, yeah (pretty brown eyes)
 
Don't tell your friends 
That I don't mean nothin' to ya 
Please don't deny the truth (pretty brown eyes)
Tell me right now, I know your heart is in the right place 
You know I won't let you down, yeah 
You can't disguise 
All the pounding of your heart, yeah 
(I see your eyes) I see your eyes (pretty brown eyes) and you can't hide 
Start to make sense 
And quit playin' these love games (silly little love games)
Tell me what you're gonna do, yeah 

Quit breakin' my heart 
Breakin' my heart, yeah (pretty brown eyes)
Breakin' my heart, ooh
Breakin' my heart, yeah (pretty brown eyes)

(Lover, lover lover)
Pretty brown eyes
Pretty brown eyes

I just want to know one thing 
Will you be with me? (pretty brown eyes)

Here comes my darling (here comes my darling)
Here comes romance (here comes romance)
Here comes my love (here comes my love)
(And please, honey will you dance?)

Quit breakin' my heart 
Breakin' my heart (pretty brown eyes)
(Breakin' my heart) breakin' my heart
Breakin' my heart, whoa-whoa

Breakin' my heart, yeah
Got me kinda lonely inside (Breakin' my heart) 
Oh, oh, oh, ooh
I'm talking bout, I'm talking 'bout you, I'm talking 'bout me, I'm taking 'bout we (breakin' my heart)
I'm taking 'bout we, we (breakin' my heart)

(Here comes my darling) here comes my darling
(Here comes romance) here comes romance
(Here comes my love) here comes my love
Babe, will you dance?

Oh yeah, sugar pie, baby

(Breakin' my heart) (here comes my darling) here comes my darling
(Here comes romance) here comes romance
(Here comes my love, please honey will you dance?) will you dance with me, baby?

Ooh, yeah, oh yeah

(Pretty brown eyes)
Breakin' my heart (pretty brown eyes)
(Breakin' my heart) (pretty brown eyes) breakin' my heart
Breakin' my heart (pretty brown eyes)
