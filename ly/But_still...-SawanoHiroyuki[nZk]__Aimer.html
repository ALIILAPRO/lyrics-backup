		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There was a pity boy
lapsed into apathy and doubt
But he got a chance to change
Somehow you bumped into
his range
He's just a normal boy
longing for happiness
And now you see what I mean
In fact, He was who
I used to be
I was reborn
with your sacred love
I don't know what to do
in my mind
But I believe in your
mighty heart
Whenever I lose control,
your soul always brings me back
Even if I got lost
or went blind
Monoceros,
take me to the Seventh star
Open the door
to the peaceful world

I was a tiny boy,
vanished in the mazes
of stardust
Why do we gotta spend our lives
only for hurting each other?
I could just cry for them
cursed at,
I'm powerless
What worth is this
fighting for?
We'll never find out anymore
No one knows,
even the Gods above
I can't draw any schemes
of my mind
But I believe in your
mighty heart
Whenever I lose control,
your soul always brings me back
Even if I got lost
or went blind
Monoceros,
take me to the Seventh star
Open the door
to the peaceful world

Do you see the lights of life?
They are ready to shine
I do swear,
I'll keep telling them
"But still..." forever
Because you bring me to life
I could fly toward your sign
through the jeweled universe
I don't know what to do
in my mind
But I believe in your
mighty heart
Whenever I lose control,
your soul always brings me back
Even if I got lost
or went blind
Monoceros,
take me to the Seventh star
Open the door
to the peaceful world
