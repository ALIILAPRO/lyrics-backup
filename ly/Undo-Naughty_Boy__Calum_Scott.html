		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Last night, we hit the ending for the last time
No more pretending, no, I can't lie
I need you more than ever before, (yuh mean that? Haha) yeah
And yesterday, I told myself exactly what to say
But I'm lost for words when you got me face-to-face
I need you more than ever before, yeah (haha)

'Cause, I can never undo what I did, what I did to you (I know)
And I never rewind every time that I hear the truth
I'll be taking it back to what we had, don't know how to react
If I lose you (lose me) yeah
You gotta let me undo it
You gotta let me undo (ay ay ay)
You gotta let me undo (ay ay ay) it (just let me undo)
You gotta let me undo (ay ay ay)

I can't believe, you got me questioning an answering machine (yessir)
Another chance is all I'll ever need
And I swear that I'll forever be yours, yeah

Bwoy you got caught
All them lies you been telling, I ain't with it
Every time you see a girl, you try to hit
Gave you my love, you never want it
Now you a beg and call me for it
You was di man, yes, di only one mi allow
Fi a bump and grind in a it
Wanted time but you'd avoid it (yeah) 
Gave me shit like I'm your toilet (yeah)
Love did real but bwoy yuh spoil it
Now mi hot like wata when you boil it (yeah)

I can never undo what I did, what I did to you
And I never rewind every time that I hear the truth
I'll be taking it back to what we had, don't know how to react
If I lose you, yeah
You gotta let me undo (ay ay ay) it
You gotta let me undo (ay ay ay) (I know there is nothing that you can do)
You gotta let me undo (ay ay ay) it (just let me undo)
You gotta let me undo (yeah yeah yeah)

Last night, we hit the ending for the last time
No more pretending, no, I can't lie
I need you more than ever before, yeah
If I could turn back, turn back, turn back time
Oh, I would turn back, turn back, turn back mine
If I could turn back, turn back, turn back time
I would turn mine back for you (now)

(Aye!) so hot, hot like fire
Body to great fi a give it to a liar
True mi throw six, you a pose like domino
Think you a player, and a tek mi for poppy show
Nah, it's too late, for you to undo
Bwoy, I'm done crying over you

You gotta let me undo it
You gotta let me undo (I know there is nothing that you can do)
You gotta let me undo it (just let me)
You gotta let me undo (I know there is nothing that you can do)
