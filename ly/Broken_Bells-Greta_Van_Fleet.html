		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can see the faces through the broken glass
No longer pass
Looking at the sky I see the city lights
But no star fights

I never wanna fall asleep
Within our dreams the weight we sew, we reap
Though I believe the sun still shines and
I believe there comes a time

When out of silence we will sing
And even broken bells will ring
Not all the answers are the same
Yet we still play the game

Sweeping off the pavement with a parlor broom
Going nowhere soon
Between the cracks of sidewalk, there's a flower grown
Beyond the stone

I never wanna fall asleep
Within our dreams the weight we sew, we reap
Though I believe the sun still shines and
I believe there comes a time

When out of silence we will sing
And even broken bells will ring
Not all the answers are the same
Yet we still play the game
Yet we still play the game

When out of silence we will sing
And even broken bells will ring
Not all the answers are the same
Yet we still play the game
