		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't blame you, and I can't save you
But I will try
For you and I, for you and I
I won't find out all the dirty little things that you've done
But I will try
I—I'm coming for you giants and you liars and your chariots of fire
You charmers with your anecdotes have started to show your true colors

Now I'm staring at the moon wondering why the bottom fell out
I've been searching for answers and there's questions I've found
Open your eyes and share this burden somehow
Are you ready to drink
Or are you waiting to drown?

I would break you
Before I let you fall into the blind
For you and I, for you and I
I will breathe in all the truth I can stomach
If it keeps you alive
We've changed the dreamers and the preachers and the wise men on the hill
To concrete stepping smilers terrified to lose their power and control

Yeah we've been crying for a leader to speak like the old prophets
The blood of the forgotten wasn't spilled without a purpose, or was it?

Now I'm staring at the moon wondering why the bottom fell out
I've been searching for answers and there's questions I've found
Open your eyes and share this burden somehow
Are you ready to drink
Or are you waiting to drown?

Yeah
Ah—ah

Yeah you'll never be whole, yeah you'll never be whole
Until you lose control
And think freely to smash the wall of apathy
Stop your self-importance and lift the weight off somebody else
Yeah you'll never be whole, yeah you'll never be whole
Until you lose control
And stop drinking the wine that's been dripping
From the lips of the gluttons and envying their bloody teeth
Yeah you'll never be whole, yeah you'll never be whole
Until you lose control
