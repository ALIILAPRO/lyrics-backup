		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I turn my back to the wind
To catch my breath
Before I start off again
Driven on
Without a moment to spend
To pass an evening
With a drink and a friend 

I let my skin get too thin
I'd like to pause,
No matter what I pretend
Like some pilgrim
Who learns to transcend
Learns to live
As if each step was the end 

Time stand still
I'm not looking back
But I want to look around me now
Time stands still
See more of the people
And the places that surround me now 

Time stands still

Freeze this moment
A little bit longer
Make each sensation
A little bit stronger

Experience slips away 
Experience slips away 

Time stands still

I turn my face to the sun
Close my eyes
Let my defenses down
All those wounds
That I can't get unwound 

I let my past go too fast
No time to pause
If I could slow it all down
Like some captain
Whose ship runs aground
I can wait until the tide comes around 

Time stand still
I'm not looking back
But I want to look around me now
Time stands still
See more of the people
And the places that surround me now

Freeze this moment
A little bit longer
Make each sensation
A little bit stronger

Make each impression
A little bit stronger
Freeze this motion
A little bit longer

The innocence slips away
The innocence slips away

Time stands still
Time stands still

I'm not looking back
But I want to look around me now
See more of the people
And the places that surround me now

Time stands still

Summer's going fast
Nights growing colder
Children growing up
Old friends growing older

Freeze this moment
A little bit longer
Make each sensation
A little bit stronger

Experience slips away 
Experience slips away 
The innocence slips away
