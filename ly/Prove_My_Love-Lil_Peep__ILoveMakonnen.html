		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah

I'll be always waitin'
If you leave, I'll start chasin'
I'll do whatever I need to
To prove my love is true
I'll be always waitin' (uh)
If you leave, I'll start chasin' (to prove my love is true)
I'll do whatever I need to (uh)
Yeah, to prove my love is true (uh)

I'll be blue face makin'
I'll wake up, she make bacon
I'll be K K facin', take it to the face
I'ma prove my love is true
Givin' all my drugs to you
Givin' all my love to you
I was tryna make my move
Now I'm seeing faces in the booth
I got a gold soul and a gold tooth
She saw a ghost when I lost my roof
I see ghosts all alone in my room
I've been waitin' for you in my room

I'll be always waitin'
If you leave, I'll start chasin'
I'll do whatever I need to
To prove my love is true
I'll be always waitin' (uh)
If you leave, I'll start chasin' (to prove my love is true)
I'll do whatever I need to (uh)
Yeah, to prove my love is true (uh)

Up and down, all around I'm goin' again
Tryna make the move and love
Always wanna groove with the-
Talk to you, I'll tell the truth, you tell me a lie
I'm just tryna be your guy
In the day or night
'Cause, I need you, baby, I need you
I'll see you, always tryna please you
You called me, didn't wanna stalk me
I'm running, baby, you're walking

I'll be always waitin'
If you leave, I'll start chasin'
I'll do whatever I need to
To prove my love is true
I'll be always waitin' (uh)
If you leave, I'll start chasin' (to prove my love is true)
I'll do whatever I need to (uh)
Yeah, to prove my love is true (uh)

Why he always fakin'? (Always faking)
I left his girlfriend shakin' (yeah)
She said I'll be makin' hits, and I know it's true (yeah, I know it's true), yeah
Leave my heart black and blue (yeah, damn), yeah
You haven't got a clue (you haven't got a clue), yeah
I'm just doin' what I do (I'm just doin' what I do), yeah
I'm just hangin' with my crew (yeah)

I'll be always waitin'
If you leave, I'll start chasin'
I'll do whatever I need to
To prove my love is true
Uh, to prove my love is true
Uh, uh
