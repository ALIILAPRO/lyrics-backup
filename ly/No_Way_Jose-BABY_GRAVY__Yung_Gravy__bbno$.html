		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Three hoes on top, what's the ratio?
Might overdose on fellatio
Turn three into four when your lady's close
Bitch, it's BG3, that's the way she goes
Shawty think that I'm sexy, I'm loveable
Never fumble a bag, that's impossible
Shawty broke my dick, playing Whac-A-Mole
I'ma gladiate the coochie like I'm Russel Crowe

Going dumb-dumb
Yeah, this shit gon' pop, turn it up some
I'ma scam your bitch and your loved ones
If she ain't have kids, I don't want none
No way Jose
Um, I'm sorry, bro, your girl texted me her bumbum
My stummy hurt before a flight, I pop a Tum Tum
I need bread, you got crumbs, I don't want none
No way Jose

Yeah, my girl's favorite movie probably Click, bitch
Got the Adam Sandler Waterboy wrist
Shawty got the jaws, but she call me Moby Dick
Twenty thousand leagues balls deep in your bitch (twenty thousand?)
Fuck a last name, I'm the people's champ
I make it rain on these dames, make the people damp
Got these hoes like moths, and my dick a lamp
And my hoes work together, Lady and the Tramp (whoa)

I check my balance, it's time to celebrate
Drip like Christmas, bitch, I decorate
Exodia that pussy, you know I obliterate
Ballin' with my twin, call it shake and bake

Going dumb-dumb
Yeah, this shit gon' pop, turn it up some
I'ma scam your bitch and your loved ones
If she ain't have kids, I don't want none
No way Jose
Um, I'm sorry, bro, your girl texted me her bumbum
My stummy hurt before a flight, I pop a Tum Tum
I need bread, you got crumbs, I don't want none
No way Jose

My lady favorite movie Madagascar
And I never take L's
I'm always right, no NASCAR
If I flop, it's on purpose, I'm a genius
Mr. Clean on my song, bitch, we the cleanest
She got a big body, big body for my Benz
Yeah, Gravy's on his horny shit, bring your friends
If I nut then I nut, well, there's nothing I can do about it
Baby, that's my bag, yeah, I'm hoping you'll be cool about it (woo)

I check my balance, it's time to celebrate
Drip like Christmas, bitch, I decorate
Exodia that pussy, you know I obliterate
Ballin' with my twin, call it shake and bake

Going dumb-dumb
Yeah, this shit gon' pop, turn it up some
I'ma scam your bitch and your loved ones
If she ain't have kids, I don't want none
No way Jose
Um, I'm sorry, bro, your girl texted me her bumbum
My stummy hurt before a flight, I pop a Tum Tum
I need bread, you got crumbs, I don't want none
No way Jose
