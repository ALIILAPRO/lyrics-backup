		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm gonna make my own way
I'm gonna head downtown
Walk around, settle down,
Find me a proper drink
Don't need a helmet
To get me through life
I walk across the water
Blame it on foolish pride

Lifting me up
Tearing me down
All you give me is indecision
the classic run-around
Bringing me higher
Keeping me whole
Now I feel like I'm living
Living in a Dust Bowl

Diamonds and pearls
You're that kind of girl
You size me up, to break me down
While you're sipping on your crown royal
I'll give you shelter
Babe, it's your call
It's hard to find truth within
When you're living in your own zone

Lifting me up
Tearing me down
All you give me is indecision
the classic run-around
Bringing me higher
Keeping me whole
Now I feel like I'm living
Living in a Dust Bowl

Pride and deception
The same kind of pain
And all that's left for me to lose
Is meant for you to gain
Playing it close
Stealing your time
But who cares anyway?
I've gone the extra mile

Lifting me up
Tearing me down
All you give me is indecision
the classic run-around
Bringing me higher
Keeping me whole
Now I feel like I'm living
Living in a Dust Bowl

Living in a Dust Bowl
