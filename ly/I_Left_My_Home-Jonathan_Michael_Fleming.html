		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I left my home
I left my home
To join the Army
To join the Army
I left my home
I left my home
To join the army
To join the army

The day I left
The day I left
My mama cried
My mama cried
She thought that I
She thought that I
Would surely die
Would surely die

I left my wife
I left my wife
Standing at the door
Standing at the door
She knew that I
She knew that I
Would die at war
Would die at war

I left my son
I left my son
Playing in the yard
Playing in the yard
Seeing daddy leave
Seeing daddy leave
Made him cry so hard
Made him cry so hard

The day I left
The day I left
I shook my daddy's hand
I shook my daddy's hand
He said that I
He said that I
Had become a man
Had become a man

Ooh-wee, ooh-wee
Ooh-wee, ooh-wee
Ooh-wee, ooh-wee
Ooh-wee, ooh-wee
Ooh-wee, ooh-wee
Ooh-wee, ooh-wee
To join the Army
To join the Army
