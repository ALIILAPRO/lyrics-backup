		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Please speak to me face to face
I’ll face it in front of me
Because I know we are
We’re a pretty bad combination

Deceitful, life is a play
Your role is whichever you take
And I know we are
We’re a pretty bad combination

I’ve bought you some plastic flowers
Because I’ve got nothing real to share
I’ve bought you some plastic flowers
Because I’ve got nothing real to share

All of the world is apparently a stage
I won’t speak louder than the first row
My head it hides the make-up in the shade
And I know there are even worse combinations

I’ve bought you some plastic flowers
Because I’ve got nothing real to share
I’ve bought you some plastic flowers
Because I’ve got nothing real to share

I’ve bought you some plastic flowers
Because I’ve got nothing real to share
I’ve bought you some plastic flowers
Because I’ve got nothing real to share
