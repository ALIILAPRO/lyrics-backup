		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This one´s going out to everybody in the place
Sounds of the track attacker
Go ahead!
Yes!
Here comes the chicks´ terminator
In control!  
Aah

On the mic I´m the teacher
Spread my words like a preacher
Cut the crap, get a slap
Drum and bass still on the map

On the mic you can´t stop me
Flat on your back like 1,2,3
Yeah, here we come!

[Chorus]
Love in a woman´s heart
I want to have the whole and not a part.
Strange that this feeling grows more and more
´Cause I never loved someone like you before.

Alright!

[Chorus]

Bass drum!

[Chorus]

Yeah!

Alright crew, it´s weekend!
Yes, we are not the monkeys
But we´ve got the key
I´am the fast chatter
No one better than me
Yeah

On the mic I´m the teacher
Spread my words like a preacher
Cut the crap, get a slap
Drum and bass still on the map

On the mic I´m the voodoo
The destination is zulu
Here we come! Here we go!

[Chorus]

Yeah

[Chorus]
Come on!

What is essential is invisible to the eye
It´s only with the heart that you can see rightly
Yeah!!

[Chorus]

Ye-ha!

Respect to the man in the ice-cream van
Over and out
