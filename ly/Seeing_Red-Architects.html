		  Rent free living in your head
"R.I.P" they commented
I felt it when they said
(We only ever love you when you're seeing red)

Seeing red

You oughta know that I'm like a broken machine
I'm not as bulletproof as you all paint me to be
Time hasn't frozen
Why do you want me to scream?
Are you a junkie punk medicating for free?

(We're all you need)
(We'll make you royalty)
(We'll be the best of enemies)

Read me all my rights
I'll never grow tired of your great advice
Won't somebody tell me what I believe?
I'm sorry for your sacrifice 
I guess I must've sounded like the Anti-Christ
Won't somebody tell me
Won't somebody tell me
What I believe?

No debts, all love, I don't give a fuck
My head, my heart wouldn't be enough
I won't think twice
I'm afraid I'm the priest
You're the poltergeist

We're like one big family
Gee, thanks so much (for the death threat)
Do you hear the audacity?
You dummies only live (on the internet)

We're all (oh, yeah?)
You need (that's right)
We'll make you royalty (gimmie that gold)
We'll be the best enemies

Read me all my rights
I'll never grown tired of your great advice
Won't somebody tell me what I believe?
I'm sorry for your sacrifice
I guess I must've sounded like the Anti-Christ
Won't somebody tell me
Won't somebody tell me
What I believe?

(Are you happy now?)

Rent free living in your head
"R.I.P" they commented
I felt it when they said
"We only ever love you when you're seeing red"

Heaven burning bright
You've really gotta wonder how I sleep at night
Won't somebody tell me
Won't somebody tell me

Read me all my rights
I'll never grown tired of your great advice
Won't somebody tell me what I believe?
I'm sorry for your sacrifice
I guess I must've sounded like the Anti-Christ
Won't somebody tell me
Won't somebody tell me
What I believe
(What I believe)
What I believe
All eyes on me
What I believe
