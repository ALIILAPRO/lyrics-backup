		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One day my father he told me
Son, don't let it slip away
He took me in his arms, I heard him say (hey)
When you get older
Your wild heart will live for younger days
Think of me if ever you're afraid
He said, one day you'll leave this world behind
So live a life you will remember
My father told me when I was just a child
These are the nights that never die
(Good job, Sho)
My father told me

Sometimes, man, I look up to the sky
And ask my God, "Why I lost a couple members?"
My niggas riding if you violate one the guys
You better hide, you better stay inside
'Cause we're coming for you

Sometimes, man, I look up to the sky
And ask my God, "Why I lost a couple members?"
My niggas riding if you violate one the guys
You better hide, you better stay inside
'Cause we're coming for you

See, I ain't really into the verbal
My broski strapped, no Dike, no Virgil
The van might buss that circle
See, I'm tryna blow off this music ting
And pray that I end up commercial
And 'bout time that I make some records
Show them why that I go universal
'Cause I can't get stuck in the ends
I need me a yard with a big ass fence
Lambo'?, shut up, Mercedes-Benz
No fake love, no need to pretend
If I cut you off it's straight intent
Guys out here tryna drill and repent
Same bad B that I need in defense
The J1's coulda been A1
But I can't follow the latest trends
Broski might handle the can and then let off shots 
'Cause the bullets bisexual
It's really for them boy there
Can definitely hit that bitch right next to you
Every time I rap on the beat
Gotta show them why man feels presentable
And chicks love pick and choose their guys 
Like a video game collectable

Sometimes, man, I look up to the sky
And ask my God, "Why I lost a couple members?"
My niggas riding if you violate one the guys
You better hide, you better stay inside
'Cause we're coming for you

Sometimes, man, I look up to the sky
And ask my God, "Why I lost a couple members?"
My niggas riding if you violate one the guys
You better hide, you better stay inside
'Cause we're coming for you

Bare man change, people fake
The world's so fucked nowadays
I don't trust no one cah' they lie to my face
I can't stop working, we all die one day
Back then I was lonely, I ain't got time for these phonies
Got my bro like Zack got Cody
I'm a Top Boy like Modie
Antisocial when I like to socialize
They're cappin' innit, that's social lies
When Brodie died I cried, that's real life
I feel a way that just don't feel right
Could've been homeless
My heart's so cold it's frozen
DTB, I find it hard to open
I've been busy living life in the moment
Reason why I ain't got time to lotion

Sometimes, man, I look up to the sky
And ask my God, "Why I lost a couple members?"
My niggas riding if you violate one the guys
You better hide, you better stay inside
'Cause we're coming for you

Sometimes, man, I look up to the sky
And ask my God, "Why I lost a couple members?"
My niggas riding if you violate one the guys
You better hide, you better stay inside
'Cause we're coming for you
