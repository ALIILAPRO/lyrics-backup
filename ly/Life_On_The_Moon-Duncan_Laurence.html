		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's hard for a man to admit he's afraid the dark
And the loneliness that comes along with it
I closed my eyes, too many nights by myself
I stopped believing and came up with questions
Like, "Will I find love? Am I good Enough?"
I floated along and circled the world by myself

You were the sun, my beam of light
Gave me my bright side
The other side's doomed
If there's life on the moon
It's all 'cause of you
It's all 'cause of you
Life on the moon

You took the lead with me
What did you see in me?
My cold empty heart
Covered in dark most of the times
The ones who pass by drift away

You were the sun, my beam of light
Gave me my bright side
The other side's doomed
If there's life on the moon
It's all 'cause of you
It's all 'cause of you

Life on the moon (life on the moon)
My point of view (my point of view)
You make my world so beautiful 
Life on the moon (life on the moon)
My point of view (my point of view)
You make my world so beautiful

You were the sun, my beam of light
Gave me my bright side
The other side's doomed
If there's life on the moon
It's all 'cause of you
It's all 'cause of you

Life on the moon
