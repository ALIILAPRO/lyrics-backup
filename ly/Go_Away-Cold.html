		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All the sounds around you used to play along with your torn up head,
As the music seeps into you, everyone was trampled dead,
Everyone could see your madness slip in till it takes control,
Everyone could see right through you, I wish you would just...

Go away! (Go!)
Go away! (Go!)
Go away!

Go away from all the pain that made you half as good as God
Taken all over in my brain, I recall the future
Take another star, make him feel the pain.

For every song you ever wrote take another fucking drink
For every melody that haunts take a pill that makes you faint
For every part of you that hurts take a needle and make it sting
The irony is I'm just like you, a pseudo-fucking freak

Fuck you, you piece of shit!
