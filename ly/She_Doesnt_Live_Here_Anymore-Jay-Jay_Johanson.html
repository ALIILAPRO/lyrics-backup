		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I hear your voice
I touch your hair
I see the traces
Everywhere
This house of ours
We used to share
My dream has turned
To nightmare

I sleep no more
I dream no more
There's nothing here
To wake up for
I talk no more
I sing no more
Don't function like
I did before

Because she doesn't live here anymore
She hardly calls at all
Now when she's gone I find myself lost
Staring at the wall

I drink again
I smoke again
There's no one here
To call my friend
I swear again
I'm mad again
So troubled since
I don't know when

Because she doesn't live here anymore
She hardly calls at all
Now when she's gone I find myself lost
Staring at the wall

She doesn't live here anymore
She hardly calls at all
Since she's been gone there's nobody here
To catch me when I fall
