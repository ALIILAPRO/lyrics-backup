		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The choices you're gonna make
Are you sure this is what you want?
I pull up from the hands that you've gotta shake
Remember faces that make or break

They all know the way
'Cause they've been there before
The shortcuts I could take
"Just lean back and enjoy"
He said

"Let me put my hand on your thigh
Let me give you a ride
'Cause I know it's a long way up to the top"
He tryna take me up 'cause no one knows my name
No, thank you, nah, think I'll take another way

It's a long way up to the top
To the top
It's a long way up to the top
He tryna take me up 'cause no one knows my name

They all know the pain
'Cause they've been here before
The shortcuts I could take
"Just lean back and enjoy"
He said

"Let me put my hand on your thigh
Let me give you a ride
'Cause I know it's a long way up to the top"
He tryna take me up 'cause no one knows my name
No, thank you, nah, think I'll take another way

It's a long way up to the top
To the top
It's a long way up to the top
He tryna take me up 'cause no one knows my name
No, thank you, nah, think I'll take another way
