		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Time
I've been passing time watching trains go by
All of my life
Lying on the sand, watching seabirds fly
Wishing there would be
Someone waiting home for me
Something's telling me it might be you
It's telling me it might be you
All of my life

Looking back as lovers go walking past
All of my life
Wondering how they met and what makes it last
If I found the place
Would I recognise the face
Something's telling me it might be you
Yeah, it's telling me it might be you

So many quiet walks to take
So many dreams to wake
And we've so much love to make
Oh-oh, I think we've gonna need some time
Maybe all we need is time

And it's telling me it might be you
All of my life

I've been saving love songs and lullabies
And there're so much more
No one's ever heard before
Something's telling me it might be you
Yeah, it's telling me it must be you
And I'm feeling it'll just be you
All of my life

It's you
It's you
I've been waiting for all of my life

(Maybe it's you) It's you
(Maybe it's you) It's you
I've been waiting for all of my life (oh, it's you, it's you)

(Maybe it's you) It's you, it's you
(Maybe it's you)
(I've been waiting for all of my life)

It's you, it's you
Maybe it's you
It's you, girl
Maybe it's you I've been waiting for
