		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

Can't keep controllin' it
When you come around me
Gotta get a hold of it
Tell me if you're ready 'cause I'm ready

Yeah, you know what you're doing when you're walkin' in that dress
Baby, I can tell that you ain't easily impressed
I got tunnel vision, think it's time that I confess
If I could just get my arms around you

Baby, don't you say that we're just friends
When you know we could be lovers instead
Wanna give you a night you'll never forget
Do the things we never did
You're out your head, so out your mind
To think that I would let you pass me by
Oh, baby, don't you say that we're just friends
When you know we could be lovers instead

You know you're beautiful (beautiful)
I don't gotta say it (gotta say it)
You try to brush me off
But I know that you're playing, quit playing

Yeah, you know what you're doing when you're walkin' in that dress
Baby, I can tell that you ain't easily impressed
I got tunnel vision, think it's time that I confess
If I could just get my arms around you

Baby, don't you say that we're just friends
When you know we could be lovers instead
Wanna give you a night you'll never forget
Do the things we never did
You're out your head, so out your mind
To think that I would let you pass me by
Oh, baby, don't you say that we're just friends
When you know we could be lovers instead

Yeah, yeah (could be lovers instead)
Yeah, yeah
Oh, baby, don't you say that we're just friends (yeah, yeah)
When you know we could be lovers instead (yeah, yeah, yeah)
