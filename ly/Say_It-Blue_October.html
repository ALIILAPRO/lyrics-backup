		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's all about steam
It's all about dreams
It's all about making the best out of everything
You'll know when your fine
Cause you'll talk like a mime

You'll fall on your face
You get back up and you're doing fine
"a considerate clown, a preachy preachy machine"
Is one of the sweetest things you would say about me
But I don't have the time for your distorted esteem
Why are you toying with my mind?

I don't wanna hear you say it
Now you're fucking with my pride

You think you're smarter than me
Well everyone knows you will never be smarter than me
That's how it goes
I gained forty pounds because of you
Was there an S on my chest
Well I confess, you were too much stress
I'd have a heart attack at best
So now I breathe it out, I breathe it out
I spit it on the crowd cause they lift me up, they lift me up, they lift me up

When I'm feeling down
What am I spitting out? spitting out, something we never talk about
It's called my mind

I don't wanna hear you say it
Now you're messing with my pride

I'm sick of standing in your line
So now you'll have to take it
Take this to heart
I will never let you fuck me over
Stop talking down to me your war is old
Your game is over
So here's my coldest shoulder

I don't wanna hear you say it
Now you're messing with my pride

Something we don't talk about
Something we never talk about
