		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ashes blowin' in the air
I was on fire but we don't care, yeah
Wasted youth, always on the road
Never looking back, and we're never getting old
'Cause the skies are black, but our heart's made of gold
Fuck doing what you're told
We're going nowhere fast

I feel sorry for this beat, symphony pains for this track
This road is taking me back, down memory lane with this rap
I could still look out in this crowd, be wild and be takin' aback 
I'm simply stating a fact, I had Wembley stadium packed
But now we're on a path headed to nowhere, and fast
Another terrorist attacks, like a tariff
Blows half of Madison Square up, alas
We perish, in the blast but that isn't scaring us
We pass knowing we're fearless
'Cause we're just

Ashes blowin' in the air
I was on fire but we don't care, yeah
Wasted youth, always on the road
Never looking back, and we're never getting old
'Cause the skies are black, but our heart's made of gold
Fuck doing what you're told
We're going nowhere fast

'Cause we're goin' up, goin' up
Goin' up, goin' up
Goin' up
Goin' nowhere
We're on the ride of our lives
We're goin' nowhere fast

Fuck doing what you're told, act like a two year old
Shit is soon to go kaboom, and blow anyways
For MC's, it's a funeral
But I'm devising this rhyme, 'cause I am awake in your mourning
That's why I rise and I shine, like a new day has dawned on me
Gusto guts bravado, nuts and plus I kick up dust and cuss a lot
I must've got you in somewhat of a debacle
Plus some stuff that's awful
Really don't mean nothing, although
There's a lotta shit I said in jest, that's though to swallow
But if at times, my heart it seems
Like it's in the wrong place, it's probably 'cause it's on my sleeve
Keanu Reeves, speed of light, avoid it, veer or just steer toward it
We're only looking forward, but where we're going
We have no idea
Nowhere to go, but hysterical 
It's getting warm in here, I set the world on fire
I was born to be an arsonist, just one spark and it's lit
But I'ma still get dark on this shit
Told you I'd leave my mark on this bitch
War machine, but you forced me in a corner
I'm sure to have something for your ear
And in the course of the assault this torture gets more severe
Go to war with me, you'll end up blue to Timbuktu
I send at you a ten ton nuke like Kim Jung Un
And end up ruining your career
Moving on, this is said and done
And at the end of my run, I'll just rewind clocks
Forever young, make time stop
Will I ever fall off? That day'll never come
To the pine box, bitch fuck you
I'm better than I ever was
Till the bomb drops, hope it never does
But, I'm not gonna sweat it 'cause
This world's screwed, it's already fucked
And I'm on top, so everyone's just

Ashes blowin' in the air (someone)
I was on fire but we don't care, yeah (we don't give a)
Wasted youth, always on the road (never)
Never looking back, and we're never getting old
'Cause the skies are black, but our heart's made of gold
Fuck doing what you're told
We're going nowhere fast

'Cause we're goin' up, goin' up
Goin' up, goin' up
Goin' up
Goin' nowhere
We're on the ride of our lives
We're goin' nowhere fast

You can't tell us nothing, hardheaded and we're stubborn
So, working out the other when we're young
(On the ride of our lives)
Who knows what the future for us could hold
Another shooter, uh oh
No more tomorrows, we're done, we're done, we're done
And all we are is

Ashes blowin' in the air (someone)
I was on fire but we don't care, yeah (we don't give a, no)
Wasted youth, always on the road
Never looking back, and we're never getting old
'Cause the skies are black, but our heart's made of gold
Fuck doing what you're told (what we're told)
We're going nowhere fast

'Cause we're goin' up, goin' up
Goin' up, goin' up
Goin' up
Goin' nowhere
We're on the ride of our lives
We're goin' nowhere fast
