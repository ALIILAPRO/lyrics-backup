		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is a song about a superhero named Tony
It's called Tony's theme

He's got the oil on his chain, for a ride in the rain
No baloney
Ride around on my bicycle like a pony
I'm waving hi, hi, hi, hi, hi
Gu-gu-gu-gimme a scream
Give me, give me the theme
Of Tony

To-ny, To-ny, To-ny, To-ny, To-ny
I am Tony, super bicycle Tony, I'm racing
Spitfire turn and pop a wheelie, burn and evil chasing
I'm waving bye, bye, bye, bye, bye
I got a card in my spokes
I'm practicing my joke, I'm learning

To-ny, To-ny, To-ny, To-ny, To-ny
This is a song about a superhero named Tony
It's called Tony's theme

I can look at the sun if you give me some bad sun glasses
I'm back on the road, I cut my grass like I'm told
After classes!

To-ny, To-ny, To-ny, To-ny, To-ny
To-ny, To-ny, To-ny, To-ny, To-ny
To-ny
