		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Funny when you come to mind
That's when you hit me up
That's when we feel a little closer
Just when I started thinking
It's like a force we can't explain
Work like a magnet, babe
Thought of you in the next moment
Giving me that feeling

Could be my suspicion
Maybe I'm just out here overthinking
Oh-oh

Like you come into the picture
When I start to feel like something's missing
Oh-oh-oh

I don't wanna miss out on another love
So I'm gonna dive right in
Go head first into the unknown (unknown)
Like it's all I know (like it's all I know)

Baby, could you keep it up?
Don't wanna stop at words, ain't enough
Feels just like a drug
Really fuck me up

Call it
A digital
Physical
Connection

Call it
Digital
Physical
Connection

Love you every single night
That's when I feel your love
That's when I take your clothes off
Can we stay in the bedroom?
'Cause you're always on my brain
I can't get away
Living for your next moment
Give into the feeling

Could be my suspicion
Maybe I'm just out here overthinking
Oh-oh

Like you come into the picture
When I start to feel like something's missing
Oh-oh-oh

I don't wanna miss out on another love
So I'm gonna dive right in
Go head first into the unknown (unknown)
Like it's all I know (like it's all I know)

Baby, could you keep it up?
Don't wanna stop at words, ain't enough
Feels just like a drug
Really fuck me up

Call it
A digital
Physical
Connection

Call it
Digital
Physical
Connection
