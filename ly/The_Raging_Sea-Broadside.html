		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Who am I?
the fear is sinking in
your hands are getting colder as my talents wearing thin
all I ever wanted was the space to put my head
you took my need to be loved and you hung me from a bridge
I'm your poster, I'm your trend, I am your lover, am I your friend?

36 minutes of your time
please just let me just change your mind
if I sang the right words would you decide
to stay, please stay

can i make it out
will i make it out
is there any point
whats the fucking point

all my days are wasted dreams
I know that's not the type of thing you wanna hear from me
i'll cut my words in pieces if it's what'll help you sleep
Iâ€™m not drowning and i'm happy
hidden in the shadows
of someone else's money stacked so tall
it blocks the show
the boy who's on a string
hoping that the crowd will never know

but who am I
what's my purpose
dry your eyes pull the curtain
were selling sadness
Well aren't you worthless?
don't you trust me?
don't you want this?

Can I make it out?
will I make it out?
Is there any point?
whats the fucking point?
