		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You, it's boring
Love is so annoying

You drive me fucking crazy
You drive me up the wall
We argue on the daily
You push it and then you pull
I try to leave you, tear it, like this is the final straw
But when I walk away, right now, I don't feel mad no more
I can't help it, I miss you (miss you)
And I hate it that I miss you when you're gone
I know we have our issues (issues)
The minute I leave, I forget them all

Without you, it's boring
Someone should have warned me
Love is so annoying
Every time I get a message
Hope it's you that's calling
Though I might ignore it
Love is so annoying

I'll go 'round to your house
And all we'll do is talk
Then drive around for hours
For no reason at all
I guess I miss the way that
The way it was before
When we were just so young
Not dumb and immature

I'm mad that I still need you (need you)
And I hate that I don't want somebody new
'Cause we still have our issues (issues)
But when its good, oh boy, it's so damn good

Without you, it's boring
Someone should have warned me
Love is so annoying
Every time I get a message
Hope it's you that's calling
Though I might ignore it
Love is so annoying
Love is so annoying
Love is so annoying

And I can't lie
You're mine and love's unconditional
I can't lie
You're mine

Without you, it's boring
Someone should have warned me
Love is so annoying
Every time I get a message
Hope it's you that's calling
Though I might ignore it
Love is so annoying

Without you, it's boring
Someone should have warned me
Love is so annoying
Every time I get a message
Hope it's you that's calling
Though I might ignore it
Love is so annoying
Love is so annoying
Love is so annoying
Love is so annoying
Love is so annoying
