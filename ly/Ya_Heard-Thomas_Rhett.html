		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, there's been times where I thought that my
Prayers never made it past the ceiling much less the sky
And I've had doubts and questions about
My faith but I don't really even know why or how

'Cause I look at this green-eyed girl from Tennessee
The one I bothered you about since I was seventeen
And I know that I wasn't wasting breath or words
'Cause I look at her and I'm pretty sure ya heard

This old guitar, dad played in bars
As soon as it was mine, I started seeing shooting stars
I played at parties, out in fields
And I hoped one day by the grace of you it just might pay the bills

Now I look at these people sitting in these seats
This dream I've bothered you about since I could barely sing
Yeah, I know that I wasn't wasting breath or words
My face is on the shirt, yeah, I'm pretty sure ya heard
Ya heard

Yeah, we tried for a while
And I got pretty mad at you, no I ain't gonna lie
But people say, you've got a way
Of being pretty funny while you make us wait

'Cause I look at these babies crawling up on me
The ones I've bothered you about since I was twenty-three
And I know that I wasn't wasting breath or words
'Cause I look at them and I look at her
More than I deserve, yeah, I'm pretty sure ya heard

I'm pretty sure ya heard
I'm pretty sure ya heard
Ooh ya heard
