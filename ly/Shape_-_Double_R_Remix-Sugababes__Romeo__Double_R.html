		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I live my life in chains
Got my hands in chains
And I can't sticks with the cards that I got
With a deal like this
I must insist a girls got more to do
Then be the way you think a woman should
I'm taking it into my hands 
In this mans land I can
Understand why I'm taking command
I've had enough of stuff
And now it's time to think about
Me, me yeah

And you can easily gamble your life away
Second after second
And day by day
You play the game or you walk away
It's a new turn on a blue day
And a cool deal of life for me
And it's all good

I know that the spades 
Are the swords of a soldier
I know that the clubs 
Are weapons of war
I know that diamonds
Mean money for this art
But that's not the shape of my heart

I've always played it safe nothings ever safe
Give me the courage to back my own convictions
Every decision I make
I pay it back and more
Now turn the cards and let them fall to me
I don't need to play on with the hand that they have given me
I give it back
'Cause it's not the way it has to be

And you can easily gamble your life away
Second after second
And day by day
You play the game or you walk away
It's a new turn on a blue day
And a cool deal of life for me
And it's all good

I know that the spades 
Are the swords of a soldier
I know that the clubs 
Are weapons of war
I know that diamonds
Mean money for this art
But that's not the shape of my heart

That's not the shape
The shape of my heart
My heart
That's not the shape of my heart

And you can easily gamble your life away
Second after second
And day by day
You play the game or you walk away
It's a new turn on a blue day
And a cool deal of life for me
And it's all good

And you can easily gamble your life away
Second after second
And day by day
You play the game or you walk away
It's a new turn on a blue day
And a cool deal of life for me
And it's all good

I know that the spades 
Are the swords of a soldier
I know that the clubs 
Are weapons of war
I know that diamonds
Mean money for this art
But that's not the shape of my heart

I know that the spades 
Are the swords of a soldier
I know that the clubs 
Are weapons of war
I know that diamonds
Mean money for this art
But that's not the shape of my heart
