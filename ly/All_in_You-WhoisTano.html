		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I put my all in you for you to say I'm not enough
I put my all in you, you know I gave you all my love
I put my all in you for you to give me half your trust
I put my all in you and somehow you ain't give
A fuck

I put my all in you(My all) I put my all in you, my love
I put my all in you(My all) I put my all in you, my love
I put my all in you(My all) I put my all in you, my love
I put my all in you
I Put my all in you

Put my all and you left ain't that funny
Now I keep my heart wrapped up like a mummy
Taking a risk, feeling lucky
Looking for love, but that shit running from me
I won't stress about a bitch, they always come and go
Balenci black and white, It look like an Oreo
I'm seeing views I ain't talking bout Ovo
She said that she love me as if I don't know
Things have changed now, bitches in love with my sound(my sound)
All my bitches act like boomerangs, they come back around(around)

I tried everything to get you off my mind
You say that you love me running out of time
Why did I ever think that you was mine
I really thought that our souls were tied

Tell me is this the ending? I used to dream about a wedding
Used to think you was a blessing, Now some messages on pending(uh)
If love was a race I'd be last, I hate that I have to leave you in the past
is it bad to say I don't miss you?
I just miss what we had

I put my all in you for you to say I'm not enough
I put my all in you, you know I gave you all my love
I put my all in you for you to give me half your trust
I put my all in you and somehow you ain't give
A fuck

I put my all in you(My all) I put my all in you, my love
I put my all in you(My all) I put my all in you, my love
I put my all in you(My all) I put my all in you, my love
I put my all in you
I Put my all in you
