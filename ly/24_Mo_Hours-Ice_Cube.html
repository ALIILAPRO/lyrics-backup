		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Put the whoop on 'em (Ice Cube, a.k.a. Don Mega)
Put the whoop on 'em (a.k.a. Poppa Don)
Put the whoop on 'em (a.k.a. the Big Fish)
Put the whoop on 'em (a.k.a. Brainiac)

Keep it gangsta, y'all
Keep it gangsta (uh huh)
Keep it gangsta, y'all
Keep it gangsta (Keep it gangsta)
Keep it gangsta, y'all
Keep it gangsta (all my life)
Keep it gangsta, y'all
Keep it gangsta (all my life)

Every thing is real on this concrete and steel
Niggas peel your cap for a happy meal
I got to deal with this ball of confusion, world of illusions
We ain't losin' playa (never), we's winnin'
Playin' every night when we sendin' paper chasing, grinnin'
While you still chasin' women 'round tables, no lieutenants
You's your own man; grown (hook it up)
It's Ice Cube and the family stone
Breakin' bread every night in L.A.
And I pray for one more day that's un-ate (check it)
It's ninety degrees, no enemies in sight
Even the Don gotta fall to his knees every night

[Chorus]
Can I get 24 more hours? (can I get, get)
Without dealin' with these killers and these cowards (can I can, can)
I don't want to loose
All I want to do is win
I fucked up today
Can I try it again?

I'm lovin' every breath like a cold sip of soda
While I'm bankin' down these back streets
Thanks for lookin' over
Damn sure nice to know ya
Fuck a four leaf clover
And thanks for this Range Rover
We gets down with this underground gangsta shit
Politicians and parents always havin' a fit
Everybody want to know: "Who you with?" "Where you from?"
Why you lookin' at me dumb?
Here's a bullet 'cause you number one
Nobody knows the fate of a platinum rap star (nobody knows)
We gotta wait until tomorrow
(Yeah, yeah)
And I'm a nigga like you 
(Yeah, yeah)
You know I got the bar

[Chorus]

Put the whoop on 'em (look to Allah)
Put the whoop on 'em (pray to your god)
Put the whoop on 'em (I look to Allah)
Put the whoop on 'em (pray to your god)

Mister Prosperity, these niggas want to bury me
Your bitch want to marry me
Rollin' more than a Cherokee
Don't; I drive what I want, and what I ain't drivin' I don't want
Let it be known (let it be known)
Permits hit the conk in the regal
But we's legal niggas 
Dollars got bald eagles, nigga
You can't undermine Mister Grime
You rappin' 'bout the same shit I rapped about in eighty-nine
Tryin' to be the new fien(d) (never) with raps complex
They love you one minute, and they hate you the next
Push my Lex through the California sunshine
Look back on my life and say, "damn, I done, done fine."
(Damn) (I done, done fine) (Uh)
Mister Ice Cube
I'm always on the grime
(Always, always)
The Don Mega, Mega Don, Don Mega, Mega Don

[Chorus]

Keep it gangsta, y'all
Keep it gangsta (uh huh)
Keep it gangsta, y'all
Keep it gangsta (Keep it gangsta)
Keep it gangsta, y'all
Keep it gangsta (all my life)
Keep it gangsta, y'all
Keep it gangsta (all my life)

I know we can make it
I know that we can
I know damn well that we can work it out
I know we can make it
I know that we can
I know damn well that we can work it out
I know we can make it
I know that we can
I know damn well that we can work it out
I know we can make it
I know that we can
I know damn well that we can work it out

And we can work it out
We gon' work it out
My niggas work it out
Help us work it out
