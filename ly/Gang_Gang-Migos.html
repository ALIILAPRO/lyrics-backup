		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Would you ooh
Would you ooh

Hey, I know this might sound weird to say
But would you love me if I ran away? (away)
I know you probably think I'm insane
Ain't nothin' change but the pocket change ( pocket change)
I know they gotta feel my pain (feel it)
I make them birds Lauren Hill sang (brr)
And everywhere I go they know my name (and what you claim)

'Cause I be reppin' gang gang (gang gang)
Posted with the gang gang (gang gang)
Pour up wit' the gang gang (gang gang)
Suit up wit' the gang gang (gang gang)
I be reppin' gang gang (gang gang)
I shoot wit' the gang gang (gang gang)
Bang wit' the gang gang (gang gang)
Ride out wit' the gang gang (gang gang)
Always rep the gang gang
Always rep the gang gang gang gang (gang)
Always rep the gang gang gang gang
Whole lotta gang shit gang gang gang (gang)
Whole lotta gang shit ay gang gang gang yeah

She froze up when that ghost came
Big body rolls it be hoggin' up both lanes
She lift her nose up when she want that cocaine
I lift my doors up the 'Lambo take propane
After my show we put hoes in the chokehold
At the door, we take cell phones no photos
Money comin' in too much I can't hold, truckload
I'm hot I can't be trappin' in the streets, that what the plug fo'
And all I want is nachos
And all I want is Huncho (Huncho)
Pulls strings like a banjo (banjo)
And the keys a piano (piano)
Take me back to the back do' (back do')
I can see my foot on a door knob
Make it back to the gang that's the whole job
Chop it up and talk about just what we got
Whatcha got? Whatcha got? Whatcha got?
Wavin' that Draco (brr)
She said she love me but that's something we'll never know (never know)
Honestly, that's all I really wanna know (wanna know)
Ain't tryna waste my time it's time to let you go (let you go)
And get back to that back end on the the road 
I can't go out sad about a hoe (hell no)
Married to the money I propose

Always rep the gang gang gang gang
Suit up with the gang gang
Always rep the gang gang gang gang
I be reppin' gang gang
Whole lotta gang shit gang gang gang
Bang with that gang gang
Whole lotta gang shit gang gang gang
Always reppin' gang gang
