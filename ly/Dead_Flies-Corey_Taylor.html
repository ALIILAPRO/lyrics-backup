		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hidden in the dirt, you still remain
A killer cause for your célèbre
When you stare into hell
It's another chance for hell to see you
Now all the lies collide and sway
The little things in the bigger pain
Don't look, don't pray, don't tell
The evidence alone won't save you

Just sift through all the glass they gave you
You see yourself in all you hated
So what is left? What is hate?

One by one
No one's going to help this time
One by one
Silence keeps your stitches tied
Together on your own
Break your oaths to match your bones
One by one
Dead flies are the only things left around you

You dress a scene to set the tone
Ignoring anything out of ordinary
And then it hits you
The fingerprints of self-indulgence
Claw-marked by total fantasy
In a hole where your broken heart should be
Don't point a finger with a
Hand that played a part in murder

Don't pretend your nemesis won't push you further
One more time is all you need and then it's started
Now what is left? What is hope?

One by one
No one's going to help this time
One by one
Silence keeps your stitches tied
Together and gone
Break your oaths to match your bones
One by one
Dead flies are the only things left around you

This life is nothing but a life
A promise of the light
But living in the dark will kill you
Reborn, a victim of the fates
You know you can't escape
So tell me what awaits
But nothing, nothing

Too strong, the feeling to belong
The ending we deny
Is only when the eyes are open
Two strikes, it's easy when you see
The future hasn't changed
But nothing ever came to change me
Nothing can change me
Nothing can change me
Nothing can change me

(One by one)
(One by one)

One by one
No one's going to help this time
One by one
Silence keeps your stitches tied
Together
Break your oaths to match your bones
One by one
Dead flies are the only things left around you
Dead flies are the only things left around you
Dead flies are the only things left around you
Dead flies are the only things left around you
