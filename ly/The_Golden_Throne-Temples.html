		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A friend is more than a companion
A foe is less than that to me
When you hear the words
The words you long to hear
Open up

The guidance from a close and loved one
Is more important than you think
When your arms a closed
The open with the key
Secret key

Clashed hands
Shaking in the closet
Hands down
You will have to see
Past plans
Forgotten and remembered
Act now

When I dont know where to go

Everything that you say
To your closest one
Makes you feel like a pain
Toward everyone
When the words are unkind
Youll regret the choice
For as long as you choose
There may be rejoice

In the colour of day
When you see the truth
Take a step to the front
To the brunt of youth
Understand what they mean
When they say the words
When sorry is said
Feel it to your bones

Amenze is made with a connection
A lonely man becomes a king]
When you need the words
The words you long to feel
Listen up

The triumph of a close and loved one
The journey to the golden throne
When the gown is graced
Proceed towards the stage
Golden stage

Clashed hands
Shaking in the closet
Hands down
You will have to see
Past plans
Verbatim and forgotten
Act now

When I dont know where to go

Everything that you say
To your closest one
Makes you feel like a pain
Toward everyone
When the words are unkind
Youll regret the choice
For as long as you choose
There may be rejoice

In the colour of day
When you see the truth
Take a step to the front
To the brunt of youth
Understand what they mean
When they say the words
When sorry is said
Feel it to your bones
