		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They say the same old talk
But sometimes they don't act upon they word
You, my Lord, always answer when I call
I know I can lean on You
When I don't feel so strong

Your peace is it for me when I feel I'm far
You are here

I'm starting to see in the end
You are all that I need (All that I need)
I'm starting to see, my God
You are all that I need
I'm starting to see in the end
You are all that I need (All that I need)
I'm starting to see, my God
You are all that I need

I'm starting to see in the end
You are all that I need (All that I need)
I'm starting to see, my God
You are all that I need
I'm starting to see in the end
You are all that I need (All that I need)
I'm starting to see, my God
You are all that I need
