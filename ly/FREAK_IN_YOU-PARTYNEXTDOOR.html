		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Room full of beautiful women but I want one
Room full of women and they notice me
Now all they wanna listen to is Jodeci (ooh)
Freak in you (freak in you)
Freak in you (freak in you)
Is there a freak in you? (Freak in you)

Come and talk to me, oh (oh)
Quick, rush, rush, rush
Baby, just like Kimora Lee, oh
So pretty, girl, you belong in a gallery
What's your fantasy? (What's your fantasy?)
Say something you ain't never did (you ain't never did)
Like fuck and suck a real nigga

I'm flickin' my wrist like I'm official
Diamonds on my chest like a bishop
And these lines right here ain't no pickup
These lines right here gon' really, really make you fuck
These lines really gonna make you numb like Chuck
This time is your time
I need to know if you're down
'Cause if not, I know there's more around

There's always more (there's always more)
That's for sure (that's for sure)
There's always more (there's always more)
That's for sure (that's for sure)

(Woo)
Because there's a room full of beautiful women but I want one
Room full of women and they notice me
Now all they wanna listen to is Jodeci (all I care about is, ooh)
Freak in you (all I care about is, freak in you)
Freak in you (freak in you)
Is there a freak in you? (Freak in you)

Come and talk to me, oh (come and talk to me, oh)
I, I don't like the shy game
I, I don't like no mind games
'Cause by the time you make your mind up
It's a tick, uh, time's up
Hey, hey 
You gon' have to climb it
Climb it if you want it
Burnin' rubber (skrrt)
Burnin' through these rubbers is exhausting
Drop, drop, hot
Baby girl, it's CrossFit
I'm gon' grab you by the hips, hey (ooh)

I'm flickin' my wrist like I'm official
Diamonds on my chest like a bishop
And these lines right here ain't no pickup
These lines right here gon' really, really make you fuck
These lines really gonna make you numb like Chuck
This time is your time
I need to know if you're down
'Cause if not, I know there's more around
(If not, I know there's more around)

Ain't no peer pressure
Girl, it's what you wanna do (girl, it's what you wanna do)
So what kind of mood you in? (what kind of mood you in?)
You know what I wanna do (you know what I wanna do)
You see what I see (you see what I see)

(You know)
There's a room full of beautiful women but I want one
Room full of women and they notice me (they notice me)
Now all they wanna listen to is Jodeci (all I care about is, ooh)
Freak in you (all I care about is, freak in you)
Freak in you (freak in you)
Is there a freak in you? (Freak in you)

Ma-Magic City bumpin' (bumpin')
But my crib is nicer 
Got wifey at home
Your night could pan out if wifey like ya
And I seen your old niggas lookin' like some old niggas (yeah)
I'm in the 'Sace Mansion with some Gucci ghost slippers
I got more gold than Mike Myers, if she a gold digger
That spandex might triple my antics (nigga)
Might take off the bandage, might fuck like a savage
Prayers out to Magic
Sav-sav-savage

There's a room full of beautiful women but I want one (I'm lookin' at you)
Room full of women and they notice me (they notice me)
Now all they wanna listen to is Jodeci (all I care about is, ooh)
Freak in you (all I care about is, freak in you)
Freak in you (freak in you)
Is there a freak in you? (Freak in you)
(Is there a freak in you? Is there a freak in you?)
