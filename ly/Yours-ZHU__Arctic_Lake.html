		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know it's not as good as the real thing
I know that you just want to feel things
I give you my attention for a few weeks
I know that you want love everlasting

I'm yours in the moment
I'm yours when I'm broken
I'm yours with devotion
In the moment, in the moment (in the moment)

You wanna play with sadness
You wanna see the sun
And there's no need for hiding
'Cause you're already gone

(I'm yours) you wanna play with sadness
(I'm yours) you wanna see the sun
(I'm yours) and there's no need for hiding
(I'm yours) 'cause you're already gone

I can hear you calling me again
The more I give to you the less I have
Baby, won't you open out your heart?
Why do opposites always attract?

I'm yours in the moment
I'm yours when I'm broken
I'm yours with devotion
In the moment, in the moment

(I'm yours) you wanna play with sadness
(I'm yours) you wanna see the sun
(I'm yours) and there's no need for hiding
(I'm yours) 'cause you're already gone
