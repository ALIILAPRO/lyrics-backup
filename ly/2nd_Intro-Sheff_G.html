		  (Great John on the beat, by the way)

Said it's only the intro, nigga
Look, look, look

Lost so many times, should've been clockin' moves, huh
I was steady breakin' rules, huh
Couldn't stay up in school, huh, nigga, look
Love the hood but you know a nigga gotta move, huh
Ain't no love, it ain't no rules, huh
I'm the shit, ain't talkin' stool, huh, nigga, man, look
On God, I miss my niggas, my niggas
Know I'm here for my niggas
You get killed for my niggas, man
On God, I miss my homies, my dawgs
You don't me at all, so don't bro me at all, look

Lost so many of my dawgs like I need a leash, huh
Went to church once, I was into breesh 
Pastor wanna preach, I wasn't with it, look
Goin' forward, oh, nigga, it ain't no surprises
Know you thought I'd die, saw right through my lies
Ma, I made you cry, I love you, I admit it, look
Late nights on the block, it was me and Sleep, nowhere to sleep
When we got pulled over on the Dracs
Said, "Pass 'em to me, you got a dream, nigga"
We used to fill up them clips, now we tryna fill up a check, yeah, huh
Free all my brothers, we know that the punishment was a sentence

Lo-lost so many times, should've been clockin' moves, huh
I was steady breakin' rules, huh
Couldn't stay up in school, huh, nigga, look
Love the hood but you know a nigga gotta move, huh
Ain't no love, it ain't no rules, huh
I'm the shit, ain't talkin' stool, huh, nigga, man, look
On God, I miss my niggas, my niggas
Know I'm here for my niggas
You get killed for my niggas, man
On God, I miss my homies, my dawgs
You don't me at all, so don't bro me at all, look (bro me at all)

(Said it's only the intro, nigga)
Bro, you you feel me bro?
Like I got scars on my face and shit for the rest of my life
You can't be mad at that, that's part of the life
That's it, it ain't nothin'
(Said it's only the intro, nigga)
That's it, that's it
