		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'll give you water if you'll scream my name for me
Or even better, tell me that you'll play my game
I'll leave the chains off, take off all of the duct-tape
I'll let you run free, please scream, give a little chase
I'll give you freedom, please don't go disappoint me
I've got an itch for you that just won't let me be
You look so pretty, baby, through this scope I see
But when I take your kneecaps out and watch you bleed

It's like time slows down
But the world keeps spinning round
I'll drag you way back down
To my corpse-filled underground

You can take a break if you just tell me that it hurts
A little deeper cut, yeah, show me what you're worth
I'll leave the chains off, take off all of the duct-tape
I'll let you run free, please scream, give a little chase
I've got a sharpened edge with a yearning for your flesh
Amphetamines to keep your consciousness so fresh
Electric stimulation, turn the voltage on
Locked in this game together - darkness until dawn

It's like time slows down
But the world keeps spinning round
I'll drag you way back down
To my corpse-filled underground
Until you're gone
Until you're gone

I've got a secret, listen, I won't tell you again
I've got a special evening planned for you, my friend
I've dug a hole six feet out back next to the fence
It looks so cosy, really, you're one lucky man
I've got arsenic and lye I got today
I've sharpened all my knives and brought a new IV
We're gonna have a special moment here alone
I wanna see what you look like as Blood and Bones
And with a buzz of a saw,
Oh baby we'll be playing God
I'll hold your heart inside
And have it beat out every cry
Until you're gone
Until you're gone
Until you're gone
