Sisi I would never let you go

Hmmmm make omo come chop ogede

Once in a life time type ogede
The type that would make you come back ogede
Ha no be small ogede

The only type that can rise up
And dance to Fuji Gabage

And she said fine boy no pimple
I love your swag and I love you die
That’s simple

She’s looking so fine
And her smile brings me joy
I know you’re the one
And I want you for me

Sisi I would never let you go
I would never let you go
I would never let you go
Say ma baby hear me so
I would never let you go
I would never let you go
I would never let you go
Say ma baby hear me so
