		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ayo, ayo, ayo
Your dope ain't been shit since '96
The highest and the flyest nigga
With Supreme stickers on the double cup
Took a sip, made a wish, up and wish
Diamond Supply drenched chest wide
Beat him with a skateboard
Tiffany SB's, I had to skate off
Off White fatigue shorts
'Bout to moonwalk over this work
Bulldog, pitbull, rottweiler on the t-shirt
I'm from the worst city on Earth
Bodies over bodies
Niggas thought I was broke
I copped the Maserati
Fuckin' model after model
Drinkin' Louis out the bottle
He tried to see me
I took the nigga's eye out like Giotto
Lucky if you see tomorrow
My young bitch like to mix
Molly up in the Moscato
My young boy got five bodies
He lookin' for a sixth
Then I heard son got hit
Gettin' dutches out of King
City fuckin' with Omar
Playin' Reject had to twist me a whole jaw
I don't play games, heart colder than Olaf
We don't fight fair
I beat his ass with a crowbar
Made a blind nigga see who fuckin' with me
The FLYGOD
You ain't fuckin' with me though
Only scared of being broke in the RICO

"Fuck rap " "Fuck rap "
"Fuck rap I'm tryin' to make
Cream and that's that"
"Fuck rap I'm tryin' to make
Cream and that's that" "Fuck " " that"
"Fuck rap " " I'm tryin' to make
Cream and that's that" " rap "
"Fuck rap " " and that's that"
