		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  1 time for my bitches
2 times for my guys
3 times for my 4 5
Gotta keep it by my side
6 deep when we ride
7 in the morning
Gotta get up and get right cause tonight's the night we die
1 time for my bitches
2 times for my guys
3 times for my 4 5
Gotta keep it by my side
6 deep when we ride
7 in the morning
Gotta get up and get right cause tonight's the night we die

Top shelf pussy got me disappointed in myself
Bitch u got me singing
Got me swimmin like I'm michael phelps
Stuck inside in a hole and I dont know if I can help myself
Swervin in my 718 while im duckin 12
Stick in da middle of the whip baby dont slip
Can't catch me slackin no
Dick in da middle of a fat bitch no lips
Can't catch up to me no
I'm riding slidin through yuh hood
20k around my neck
I ran into a check you really thought I wasn't about to flex

1 time for my bitches
2 times for my guys
3 times for my 4 5
Gotta keep it by my side
6 deep when we ride
7 in the morning
Gotta get up and get right cause tonight's the night we die
1 time for my bitches
2 times for my guys
3 times for my 4 5
Gotta keep it by my side
6 deep when we ride
7 in the morning
Gotta get up and get right cause tonight's the night we die

I just did a kamikaze in a Maserati cause I hate myself and I hate everybody
You love me then you hate me wanna fuck me 
Then you rape me out my money like I never been nobody
Hit em up with that
Shot
Gun
Making sho that dat
Clock
Run
Outta time
Outta my mind
Better run for life and yo safety
Back inside that Cadillac
I'm never going back to being broke
1 time for all da hoes that thought I was a joke

1 time for my bitches
2 times for my guys
3 times for my 4 5
Gotta keep it by my side
6 deep when we ride
7 in the morning
Gotta get up and get right cause tonight's the night we die
1 time for my bitches
2 times for my guys
3 times for my 4 5
Gotta keep it by my side
6 deep when we ride
7 in the morning
Gotta get up and get right cause tonight's the night we die
1 time for my bitches
2 times for my guys
3 times for my 4 5
Gotta keep it by my side
6 deep when we ride
7 in the morning
Gotta get up and get right cause tonight's the night we die
1 time for my bitches
2 times for my guys
3 times for my 4 5
Gotta keep it by my side
6 deep when we ride
7 in the morning
Gotta get up and get right cause tonight's the night we die

Bye bye baby you ain't never coming back
Drop the top and pop da Glock right out da window of da lac
I'm feelin myself tonight I'm alive
So many emotions
Imma dive into the ocean
Then rise like I was Moses
Split yuh wig in bits
Chicken and biscuits wit yo bitch oh boy gon have a fit
Fuck the population you can label me degenerate
My generation dying imma have to save these kids
They doing lean they popping pills
They off da sedatives

1 time for my bitches
2 times for my guys
3 times for my 4 5
Gotta keep it by my side
6 deep when we ride
7 in the morning
Gotta get up and get right cause tonight's the night we die
