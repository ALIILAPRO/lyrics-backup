		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How it is a thing?
That I could be your everything
Then suddenly I'm not
Like suddenly it stops
How it is a thing?
That you can go from calling me
To now my number lost
It's like you just forgot

Remember when you drove all night
Just to wake up by my side, by my side

I love the way you loved me
I hate the way you don't
It feels so weird to me that you don't feel it anymore
And I'd like for you to change your mind
But we both know you won't
I love the way you loved me
I hate the way you don't

How can you pretend?
Like it was just my fantasy
Like it was only me
And I'm kidding myself
Whoa, how can you pretend?
That you don't love my family like they where your as well
The lies you tell yourself

Remember when you stayed at mine
Just to wake up by my side, by my side

Whoa, I love the way you loved me
I hate the way you don't
It feels so weird to me that you don't feel it anymore
And I'd like for you to change your mind
But we both know you won't
I love the way you loved me
And I hate the way

You told me that you've been searching
For what I gave you in somebody else
And I'm sorry that I just moved on
And what's done is done and you're by yourself

Thinking you loved the way I loved you
And you hate the way I don't
It feels so weird to you that I don't feel it anymore
And you'd like for me to change my mind
But we both know I won't
You loved the way I loved you
And you hate the way I don't
