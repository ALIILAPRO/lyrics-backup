		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Space Girl, show me the stars
You know the galaxies of my heart

Girl, are you a cancer?
'Cause you make me cry
When we kiss or dance in the sky
We're dancing in the sky

Space Girl, I saw a lunar eclipse
Looked like how I feel 'bout your lips
Space Girl, the only way that we'd end
Was if you were sucked into a black hole
But I'd still spend my days dreaming 'bout you (ooh)
Dreaming bout you (ooh)
Tell me how to (ooh)
Stop dreaming bout you (ooh)

Girl, are you a cancer?
'Cause you make me cry (cry)
When we kiss or dance (dance) in the sky (in the sky)
We're dancing in the sky (in the sky)

I hope (hope, hope) 
You (you, you)
Play (play)
This song (song, song)
Someday (some, some, day)
And think (think, think)
Of (of, of)
Earth Girl (Earth Girl)
Who loves (love, love, love, love)
Space Girl (Space Girl)

I hope (hope, hope) 
You (you, you)
Play (play)
This song (song, song)
Someday (some, some, day)
And think (think, think)
Of (of, of)
Earth Girl (Earth Girl)
Who loves (love, love, love, love)
Space Girl (Space Girl)

I hope (hope, hope) 
You (you, you)
Play (play)
This song (song, song)
Someday (some, some, day)
