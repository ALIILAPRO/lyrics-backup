		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Look all around you
You think I'm so glad I found you
You don't know nothing about me
But I can tell so much about you

Shorty stay getting freaky
She's a good girl till the evening
Both eyes lock when she see me
Trust me, I know she been scheming
Waiting till we leave

Yeah she kinda like my ex be
Always tryna text me
Thinking she can tempt me
Now we in the backseat
Used to whip an X3
Now she riding Bentley
Fellas- she got plenty
Still feeling empty

It's okay, it's okay
Baby you can call me when you're lonely

Dige tanha nemikhai bemooni
Pishe manam nemikhai bemooni
Khodetam khoob ino midooni
Fekr Mikoni faramoosham mikoni
(You don't want to be alone
You don't want to be with me either
You know it, too
You think you'll forget about me)

It's okay, It's okay
Yeah girl we can play that game

Just don't think I'll be the one
I'll be the one till the morning comes
Get what you want then you're gone
You know that I won't be here for long
No I won't be here for long
Nemitoonam bemoonam
(I can't stay)
