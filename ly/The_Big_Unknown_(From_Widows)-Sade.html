		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Only love could bring us
Bring us to this bitter plane
And only one of us who's gonna walk away
Here in the deep below
That only darkness really knows
I'm hoping for a humble seed to grow

No I won't surrender to this hard hearted night
Though I know the sun's gonna bring the palest of light
And all that remains
Is everything that's gone
This life is mine so I'll carry on

I'm just trying to hold on
I'm falling in the dark below
I feel I'm falling in the big unknown

Here in the deep below
I will rise
I will rise again
A humble seed will grow

I have to go back to pull me from the wreck
I know it's not over yet
There's no fire and no flame on this cold cold plane
And no way to measure my pain

I'm just trying to hold on
I'm falling in the dark below
I feel I'm falling in the big unknown

I will rise
I will rise
I will rise again
The humble seed will grow
