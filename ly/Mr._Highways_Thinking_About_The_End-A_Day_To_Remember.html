		  Wake up

Oh, how the times have changed
You're not the person I knew back then
Let's get this straight
This is a calling, when will they stop falling for this?
You lack all inspiration
We're not the same
I'll do whatever it takes to get it through to you, we'll call this a day
We're not the same
You are worthless, stay in your place

It's like speaking in tongues to all of you now (to all of you now)
When will we ever (when will we ever)
Get what we deserve?
How long until the tables turn? (We'll wait our turn)
When will we ever (when will we ever)
Get what we deserve?

I've created a monster
You bring out a side of me that no one should see
So quit stalling, pack your bags, keep walking away
Your life leads to destruction
We're not the same
I've struggled too long to sit back and let you take this from me
We're not the same
I have given everything

It's like speaking in tongues to all of you now (to all of you now)
When will we ever (when will we ever)
Get what we deserve?
How long until the tables turn? (We'll wait our turn)
When will we ever (when will we ever)
Get what we deserve? (Get what we deserve?)
Get what we deserve? (Get what we deserve?)

Disrespect your surroundings

You won't make it out alive
You won't make it out alive
You won't make it out alive
You won't make it out alive

It's like speaking in tongues to all of you now
When will we ever (when will we ever)
Get what we deserve?
How long until the tables turn?
When will we ever (when will we ever)
Get what we deserve?

(When will we ever)
(Get what we deserve?)
(When will we ever)
(Get what we deserve?)
