		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You can't kill me, bitch, I've done too much
You can't kill me, bitch, I've done too much
You can't kill me, bitch, I've done too much
You can't kill me, bitch, I've done too much

Can't die, can't die, can't die
Can't die, can't die, can't die
Can't die, can't die, can't die
Can't die, can't die, can't die

I'm immortal
I'm immortal
I'm immortal
Can't die, can't die, can't die

Can't die, can't die, can't die
Can't die, can't die, can't die
Can't die, can't die, can't die
Can't die, can't die, can't die (Uh, yeah, okay)

Life after death, uh
I just did what's next, uh
Can't be holding feelings inside, say it with your chest, uh
Screams come through my neck, uh
Pleading with myself, uh
Had to get up, find my own way, sunken place regrets, uh
Can't die, can't die, can't die, uh
Jokes on you, life's just a lie, uh
Can't die, can't die, can't die
Life is a lie (Shh)

You can't kill me, bitch, I've done too much
You can't kill me, bitch, I've done too much
You can't kill me, bitch, I've done too much
You can't kill me, bitch, I've done too much

Can't die, can't die, can't die
Can't die, can't die, can't die
Can't die, can't die, can't die
Can't die, can't die, can't die

I'm immortal
I'm immortal
I'm immortal
Can't die, can't die, can't die

Can't die, can't die, can't die
Can't die, can't die, can't die
Can't die, can't die, can't die
Can't die, can't die, can't die
