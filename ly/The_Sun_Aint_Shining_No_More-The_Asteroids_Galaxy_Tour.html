		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, I got my mind out of sight
Lost the common sense,
Got a rave in my brain
Like I'm without defense.

Till I catch my eyes right in front of me,
It's a bloke of a man finally taking me.
Hey cute from the left, oh yeah
Why'd his move he had me shake out a lie
He really had it going

The crowd's getting thinner
We are getting closer,
With a hole in my head
He took me to his sofa

Well now the sun ain't shining no more,
I don't know why but I've seen it before.
Ain't got no joy no man to lean on,
He leaves my soul on the floor like a doll.

He was young, he was hot,
He made me feel alive.
So in love I was falling,
Ooh, it's early morning.

He took me in his hands
And squeezed me real tight.
I was humbled (???)
But depending on this guy
He didn't last very long,
A week or maybe two.
When he called me on the phone
Saying baby I don't love you.

Just another lonely love
Always giving never get.
And now I feel so stupid
It's like a deja vu ooooooo

Because the sun ain't shining no more,
I don't know why but I've seen it before.
Ain't got no joy no man to lean on,
He leaves my soul on the floor like a doll.

Oh no the sun ain't shining no more,
I don't know why but I've seen it before.
Ain't got no joy no man to lean on,
He leaves my soul on the floor like a doll.

Yeah, yeaaahhhh

For a while I'm shining
But later I'm crying.
I'm sick and stronger,
I'm always getting weaker.

For a while I'm shining
But later I'm crying
I'm sick and stronger
I'm always getting weaker

Yeah now the sun ain't shining no more,
I don't know why but I've seen it before.
Ain't got no joy no man to lean on,
He leaves my soul on the floor like a doll.
