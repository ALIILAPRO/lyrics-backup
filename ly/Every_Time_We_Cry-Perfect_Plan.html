		  Every Time We Cry
Lyrics & Melodies: Kent Hilli Music: Kent Hilli , Rolf Nordström, Leif Ehlin, Fredrik Forsberg, Mats Byström

I'm tellin' you straight from the heart
The story's been the same
You and me we've been torn apart
Our life's about to end

I'm beggin' you here in the dark 
Another night so cold
You and  Me
without a spark 
Do you got someone to hold

I know we were right from the start
But a broken heart can't mend
I know that we're two worlds apart
Can we finally learn to love again 

Tell me why
Give me one more reason to try
Give me one more last goodbye
Oh baby 
Every Time, every time we cry
Tell me why
give me one more reason to try
One more last goodbye
Oh baby every time, every time we cry

You're making me walk down the aisle
You took my heart again
But you and me
we could still survive
There's a light at the end

I know we were right from the start
But a broken heart can mend
I know that we're two worlds apart
Can we finally learn to love again 

Tell me why
Give me one more reason to try
Give me one more last goodbye
Oh baby 
Every time, everyt ime we cry
Tell me why
give me one more reason to try
One more last goodbye
Oh baby every time 
every time we cry

Every time i turn around 
The memories remain
I was gone with the lost and found
Girl inside i'm loosin' ground
Do you believe
We can try to love, try to love again

ell me why
Give me one more reason to try
Give me one more last goodbye
Oh baby 
Every time, every time we cry
Tell me why
give me one more reason to try
One more last goodbye
Oh baby every time 
Every time we cry
Tell me why
Tell me why
Tell me why
