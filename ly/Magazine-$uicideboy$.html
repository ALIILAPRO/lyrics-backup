		  Suicidal holocaust
For the dead I shed a tear
Cut fuck boys from ear to ear
You never see me creeping near

Suicidal holocaust
For the dead I shed a tear
Cut fuck boys from ear to ear
You never see me creeping near

Suicidal holocaust
For the dead I shed a tear
Cut fuck boys from ear to ear
You never see me creeping near

Suicidal holocaust
For the dead I shed a tear
Cut fuck boys from ear to ear
You never see me creeping near

I come through with helicopters
Bookoo blades and hella choppers
Looking like the dawn of Vietnam
Ruby crashing on the lawn
Who the fuck else dare to stop us?
Bitch come through
Blue veins turn into new stains
One of the original seven like Liu Kang
Slit the wrist of the six
No one left but me, bitch
The 7th Ward Lord got a new name
But Ruby does not exist due to a personality split
One half devil, other half got zipped
Now who the fuck else wanna talk shit?
Now who the fuck else wanna get ripped?
Now who the fuck else think I'm a bitch?
Come take a fucking sit
I swear to no God you'll end up in a crypt

Snappin' like necks from that bank on the west
Kurt Cobain veins, opium in my chest
Escaped out the psych ward now I'm on a murder spree
Voices inside of me won't let me go to sleep
Drowning in sleeping pills covered in ashes
Riding down Paris this life never mattered
Ready to die bitch, I'm ready to die
I pull on this trigger got blood on my satin
Fuck is he okay?
No, I'm just the same
Deranged out the gate, it's always been my fate
Lil $licky ride the pain
Ruby pumpin' shotty, Crucified in Tommy
Yung Christ risen out the concrete

Suicidal holocaust
For the dead I shed a tear
Cut fuck boys from ear to ear
You never see me creeping near

Suicidal holocaust
For the dead I shed a tear
Cut fuck boys from ear to ear
