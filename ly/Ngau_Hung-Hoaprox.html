		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everyone's walking around
Holding their hearts on their hands
All they can see is the ground
Too busy making up plans

Everyone's walking around
Living in separate worlds
Babies are internet stars
Parents as quiet as Ferb

Memories become so hazy
When did we become so lazy
This world's only getting crazier

Memories become so hazy
When did we become so lazy
This world's only getting crazier

Can we put down our phones
Let's enjoy this moment
Can we put down our phones
Let's enjoy this moment
Can we put down our phones
Let's enjoy this moment
Let's enjoy this moment

You and me alone you and me alone
You and me alone you and me alone
You and me alone

Everyone's craving a high
In every magical touch
Everyone's working their eyes
Until they've both had enough

One blink it's a new day
One touch it's a new face
We act like we're okay
And we'll do it we'll do it again
We'll do it again we'll do it again
Memories become so hazy
When did we become so lazy
This world's only getting crazier

Memories become so hazy
When did we become so lazy
This world's only getting crazier

Can we put down our phones
Let's enjoy this moment
Can we put down our phones
Let's enjoy this moment
Can we put down our phones
Let's enjoy this moment
Let's enjoy this moment

You and me alone you and me alone
