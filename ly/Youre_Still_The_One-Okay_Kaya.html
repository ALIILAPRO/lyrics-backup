		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (When I first saw you)
(When I first saw you, I saw love)
(And the first time you touched me, I felt love)
(And after all this time)
(You're still the one I love)

Looks like we made it
Look how far we've come, my baby
We mighta took the wrong way
We knew we would get there someday

They said, "I bet we'll never make it"
But just look at what's going on
We're still together, still going strong

(You're still the one) you're still the one I run to
The one that I belong to
You're still the one I want for life
(You're still the one) you're still the one that I love
The only one I dream of
You're still the one I kiss goodnight

Ain't nothin' better
We beat the odds together
I'm glad we didn't listen
Look at what we could be missin'

They said, "I bet they'll never make it"
But just look at what's going on
We're still together, still going strong

You're still the one I run to
The one that I belong to
You're still the one I want for life
(You're still the one) you're still the one that I love
The only one I dream of
You're still the one I kiss goodnight
Goodnight
