		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Where do we go from here now that all of the children are growin' up?
And how do we spend our lives if there's no one to lend us a hand?

I don't want to live here no more
I don't want to stay
Ain't gonna spend the rest of my life
Quietly fading away

Games people play
You take take it or you leave it
Things that they say, honor bright
If I promise you the moon and the stars
Would you believe it
Games people play in the middle of the night

Where do we go from here now that all of the children have grown up?
And how do we spend our time knowin' nobody gives us a damn?

I don't want to live here no more
I don't want to stay
Ain't gonna spend the rest of my life
Quietly fading away

Games people play
You take take it or you leave it
Things that they say
Just don't make it right
If I'm tellin' you the truth right now
Do you believe it?
Games people play in the middle of the night

Games people play
You take take it or you leave it
Things that they say, honor bright
If I promise you the moon and the stars
Would you believe it?
Games people play in the middle of the night

Games people play
You take take it or you leave it
Things that they say
Just don't make it right
If I'm tellin' you the truth right now
Do you believe it?
Games people play in the middle of the night
