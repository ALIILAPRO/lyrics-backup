		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I guess to you now, I'm just a face in the crowd
Oh God, kindly, please, would you kill me now?
Late at night in my room, lie awake, think of you
And all your little dooms

Last night I dreamt I still knew you
You
I carved out a place in this world for two
But it's empty without you

I've got all this love I've got to keep to myself
All this effort to make it look effortless
All this love I've got to keep to myself
All this effort to make it look effortless

Confront all the pain like a gift under the tree
Oh please, I can't be who you need me to be
I grind in the sunshine, grind in the rain
So real that I feel fake

Last night I dreamt I still knew you
You
I carved out a place in this world for two
But it's empty without you

I've got all this love I've got to keep to myself
All this effort to make it look effortless
Got all this love I've got to keep to myself
All this effort to make it look effortless

One day every candle's gotta run out of wax
One day no one will remember me when they look back
I can't stop, can't stop 'til we catch all your ears though
Somewhere between Mike Tyson and Van Gogh

You
You
I carved out a place in this world for two
But it's empty without you

I've got all this love I've got to keep to myself
All this effort to make it look effortless
Got all this love I've got to keep to myself, myself
All this effort to make it look effortless
All this effort to make it look effortless
All this effort to make it look effortless
