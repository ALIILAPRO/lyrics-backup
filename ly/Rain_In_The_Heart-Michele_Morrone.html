		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You've come too far
And there's no anybody, anybody
To bring him back in her
She was alone
And she forgot to swim in the same world

Where one day
There was a sun and I can only see the rain

Say
That is love
Was a jungle and I felt you burning off
Say
That is love
Thoughts and breeze has tried me faithful to the heart

I've looked into the dark of your eyes and I saw the tears
What remains for me as I hunt for love and dreams
I've crossed these seas of times as I've never done before
And I'm drowning in the darkness of my fears

We're here one day
There was the sun and I can only see the rain
We're here, we're here one day
There was the sun and I can only see
A sun and I can only see the rain

We're here one day
There was the sun and I can only see the rain, oh no
We're here one day
There was the sun and I can only see
The sun and I can only see
The sun and I can only see the rain
