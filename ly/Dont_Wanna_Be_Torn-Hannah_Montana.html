		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Maybe it's the things I say
Maybe I should think before I speak
But I thought that I knew enough
To know myself and do what's right for me

And these walls I'm buildin' now
You used to bring 'em down
And the tears I'm cryin' out
You used to wipe away

I thought you said it was easy
Listenin' to your heart
I thought you said I'd be okay
So why am I breakin' apart?

Don't wanna be torn
Don't wanna be torn
Don't wanna be torn
Don't wanna be torn

Don't make me have to choose between
What I want and what you think I need
'Cause I'll always be your little girl
But even little girls have got to dream

Now it all feels like a fight
You were always on my side
And though lonely I feel now
You used to make it go away

I thought you said it was easy
Listenin' to your heart
I thought you said I'd be okay
So why am I breaking apart?
Don't wanna be torn

Why is all this so confusing
Complicated and consuming?
Why does all this make me angry
I wanna go back to being happy

The tears I'm crying out
You used to wipe away, yeah

I thought you said it was easy
Listenin' to your heart
I thought you said I'd be okay
So why am I breakin' apart?

Don't wanna be torn
Don't wanna be torn
Don't wanna be torn
Don't wanna be torn

Don't wanna be torn
Don't wanna be torn
Don't wanna be torn
Don't wanna be torn
