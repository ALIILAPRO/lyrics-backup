		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can not resist
I want to fly away
But where are my wings?
And what is my way? 

 What you need from me?
I do not want to talk
My life is free
My life is black milk 

 I wish lists you live
I do not want to cry
Where is my mind?
(My mind) 

 I like to be alone, I hate all the people and
I want to escape and win this round
I like to be alone, I hate all the people and
I want to escape and win this round
I like to be alone, I hate all the people and
I want to escape and win this round
I like to be alone, I hate all the people and
I want to escape and win this round
I like to be alone, I hate all the people and
I want to escape and win this round
