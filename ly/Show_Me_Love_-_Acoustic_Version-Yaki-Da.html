		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I just wanna have what is mine
Your love for me
Wait and see

I'm not trying to seduce you
Though it's a long and cold dark nigt
You are the one you are
I would never try to change you
I wanna see who you are inside

Show me love
And how to share it
I'll give you double up in return
Life is now
And meant for living
Cause it's been grey for so many years

I feel lonely when I see you
Why don't you give me just a smile
You'd make my day in many ways
Just a fragment of your lifetime
Bacause the shine in mye eyes will tell

Show me love
And how to share it
I'll give you double up in return
Life is now
And meant for living
Cause it's been grey for so many years

I, I'm not beautiful
But I can give you something
No one' gonna give you
Me, I will fight for you
So I'll be yours
Just give me time

Show me love
I live, I'm learning
Life will never ever be bad
Under my spell
Kiss and tell
