		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Head down
Quite surprised
'Cause I hear you've quietened down
And I won't suffice
I remember you so proud
Pleasant memories
In the good old days
We must have let them get away

'Cause no one's home
Ringing ringing
Like I'm on my own
Did you forget where you came here from?
I cannot commend
'Cause it's not gonna get you where you want

How you let it go
Without saying hey
Where you let it go
When you hear my name
I'm so thrown
If this is your only aim
No way the chase is worth the sacrifice
Left it behind, I'm so surprised
See you heading in a new direction
Meet the trouble in the intersection
Go
It's as simple as a misconception
Could've learned from your past convictions
If there's a god, well sorry they can't save you now

'Cause no one's home
Ringing, ringing
Like I'm on my own
Did you forget where you came here from?
I can understand
But its not gonna get you where you want

How you let it go
Without saying hey
Where you let it go
When you hear my name
I'm so thrown
By the mess that you had made
No way the chase is worth the sacrifice
Left it behind, I'm so surprised
