		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My My My
Three months more you're out of time
Moving backwards down the line
These veils are getting far too weak
The words make sense but the feeling's oh so bleak

My My My 
What happened to that boy we knew?
The one who's mind was perma-blue
Picking moments from his lifetime
Making scrapbooks of hyperbole
Tryna seem like he'd lived

But you'll be driving back to Bristol
The car will break down twice
And you'll finally love the Beatles but you won't play them out of spite
You'll feel the sun without her shadow
Feel the wind without her touch
And then you'll see
That you'll finally be free

My My My
The pear tree's flowering once again
Falling far from the roots but that's the trend
Chip off the block that's not the tune
But you know that sheltered fruit don't spoil so soon

My My My
You're clouding meaning every line
Tryna write it so it rhymes
Stacking decks and planting jokers
Just lay your cards out in the open, broken
And we'll see what you're like

But you'll be driving back to Bristol, the car will break down twice
And you'll finally love the Beatles but you won't play them out of spite
You'll feel the sun without her shadow, feel the wind without her touch
And you'll leave her on the mainland, and you'll know that it is done
And you'll see dolphins in the clouds again, you'll stay up till it's light
And you'll have a beer for breakfast and you'll move on with your life
And you'll be drinking in the sunrise, run your fingers through your hair
And then you'll see
That you'll finally be free

My My My
My My My
My My My 
My My My

But you'll be driving back to Bristol, the car will break down twice
And you'll finally love the Beatles but you won't play them out of spite
You'll feel the sun without her shadow, feel the wind without her touch
And you'll leave her on the mainland, and you'll know that it is done
And you'll see dolphins in the clouds again, you'll stay up till it's light
And you'll have a beer for breakfast and you'll move on with your life
And you'll be drinking in the sunrise, run your fingers through your hair
And then you'll see
That you'll finally be free
