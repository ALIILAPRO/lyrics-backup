		<p>
		  I just can't hold
I just can't hold it back
I just can't hold it back
I just can't hold it back
The touch i felt on your lips
When i gave you a kiss
I can't imagine a life without you
The touch i felt on your lips
When i gave you a kiss
I can't imagine a life without you
I can't imagine a life without you
