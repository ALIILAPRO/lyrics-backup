		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sometimes you gotta think the unimaginable
Then chase it by any means
'Cause the only thing you got is you
And your wildest dreams
So it started as a thought,
Then it turned to a dream
Would've never thought my goals would
Be in reach
But it seems
All you gotta do is believe
Just take your time
Keep your head down and grind
And then you'll find
You only had to believe
Just believe
Just believe
You gotta believe
Just believe
Just believe
You gotta believe, believe, believe
I'm a real hard boy, not your average or typical
Straight out the mud, tryna paint you a visual
Love for the game unconditional
Eyes on the prize haffi aim for the pinnacle
Came from the bottom
Through the cracks of the pavement
No handouts, freebies, payments
Took a gamble, and I bet on myself
And I stayed on my grind
And I never lost patience
One time for my lifers
Another shout for my ride or dies
Shouts to my day ones
Stayed patient till it's time to rise
And they say sometimes it's too late it seems
They wrong,
So wrong
Only thing you need is a plan
And the will to chase your dreams
Just believe
Just believe
You gotta believe
Just believe
Just believe
You gotta believe, believe, believeâ€¦
