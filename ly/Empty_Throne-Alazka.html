		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So I found you
Tried to show you what you caused you say it's my fault
It's the aftermath of yours
You think I'm happy
You say it's not so bad
I say come closer
Take a look inside my head

My kingdom falls
An empty throne placed in the dark a mother searching for her child my mind's running wild

Rising tension and my world's slipping out of my hand too much to comprehend
Building up
So with my eyes open wide
And the words in my mouth I will say it loud

Welcome my friend
To a world
Where the tables won't turn the sun won't rise
To witness the end
Of what in time could have been

See I tried to
See I tried to find a way
To stand my own ground
And ignore the words you say
It is no use
(They) found a way inside my head like the echoes
Like a voice behind my back

I'll find my own
Approval for want of the crown a lock up with no place to hide I'm trapped in my mind

My so called friend
And I don't need your excuses and I don't need your regret
I just wanted you to understand that I can't forget

It's in my head
