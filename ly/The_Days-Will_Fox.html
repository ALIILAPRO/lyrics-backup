		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You ask me how are the days I spend with my only true love
And I tell you she shows me the summer with snow clouds above

You ask me how are the nights I spend with my only true baby
And I tell you she shows me the light

When my darkest hour shades me
And I tried to hold on to her
But she slipped through my fingers like rain
Now it ain't the same

You ask me how are the days now that my baby is gone
I'm troubled my friend
I know what is right but I do what is wrong

You ask me how are the nights now that my true love has left me
Well, I drink and I dream of her still
But her vision, it only breaks me
And I tried to hold on to her
But she slipped through my fingers like rain
Yeah, she slipped through my fingers like rain
Now it ain't the same

When my darkest hour shades me
And I tried to hold on to her
But she slipped through my fingers like rain
She slipped through my fingers like rain, now it ain't
Now it ain't the same

No, it ain't the same
