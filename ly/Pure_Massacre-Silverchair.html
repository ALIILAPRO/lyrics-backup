		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  People dying for no reason at all 
Age is no difference or if you're large or small 

Families been torn apart 
Doesn't have to be this way 
Some people just have no heart 
It's happening every day 
Pure massacre 
Pure massacre
Pure massacre 
Pure massacre

Machine guns pumping 
Hearts thumping 
Death is all around yeah 
People crying for freedom 
No one hears the sound oh 

Pure massacre
Pure massacre
Pure massacre 
Pure massacre alright

There's people crying
There's people dying
But someone's taken it all
Yeah

Machine guns pumping, 
Hearts thumping, 
Death is all around, 
People crying for freedom
No one hears the sound

Pure massacre
Pure massacre 
Pure massacre 
Pure massacre 
Pure massacre 
Pure massacre, yeah
Pure massacre
Pure massacre 
It's gonna be
A pure massacre
Yeah
