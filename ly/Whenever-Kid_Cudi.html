		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Focus, baby, don't look at me
See right through me, understand my heartbeat
Murmurs to mock your rhythm
Yeah, my nuts, the other girls want 'em
But they can't have, at least for the moment I'm with you
There could be people around, I'm just focused on you
You can sip Chardonnay and I'ma have myself a brew
I'm a country-ass nigga, baby, you know how I roll
Your face, never seen something more perfect
You dance in my mind like Justice
I know you listening back like, "Damn, bruh"
Laid back, so gentle like the violins
Lay on he beat and we don't have to be as discreet
Can I have a taste? Absolutely
You my sweet tangerine, let's make a smoothie
But, baby, all jokes aside
My heart beat faster when open your thighs
I'm just ready slide, ride and glide

Whenever, baby (word)
Whenever, baby (word)
Whenever, baby (word), however (ever)

Whenever, however you want me, girl, you got me 
(Woo-hoo-hoo, woo-hoo-ho)
Whenever, however you want me, boo 
It's me and you, babe
Me and you
Whenever, however you want me, girl, you got me 
(Woo-hoo-hoo, woo-hoo-ho)
Whenever, however you want me, boo 
It's me and you, babe
Me and you

Whenever, however you want me, girl, you got me 
(Woo-hoo-hoo, woo-hoo-ho)
Whenever, however you want me, boo 
It's me and you, babe
Me and you
Whenever, however you want me, girl, you got me 
(Woo-hoo-hoo, woo-hoo-ho)
Whenever, however you want me, boo 
It's me and you, babe
Me and you
