		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The illusory paradise representing a total denial of earthly life is no longer projected into the heavens, it is embedded in earthly life itself.

they said you came across the sea 
the vast sea of reeds
when a strong east wind blew
you came guided by a pillar of fire at night
you walked on dry land
he smothered all your enemies
he smothered all your enemies

clogged the chariot wheels
made them flee, made them disappear
what you've seen today you shall never ever see again 

clogged the chariot wheels
made them flee, made them disappear
what you've seen today you shall never ever see again 

blow back
blow back
blow back
blow back

I divided the waters for you, not for nothing
not as a favour, not as a proof of sentiment
take it all as it seems
close your eyes and find ways to believe
cherish the miracle that is so crucial
to satisfy your vanity

I divided the waters for you
I divided the waters for you
I divided the waters for you
I divided the waters for you
