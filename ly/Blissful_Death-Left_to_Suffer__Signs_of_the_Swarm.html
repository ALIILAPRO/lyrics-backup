		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Patricide: the killing of ones father, a song that cries to heaven.... but don’t beafraid

Ihope the nexttime I see your face iswhen Im fucking bashing it in

Writhing and rotting my brain is allotting a gas line of hate that connects to my body
This struggle to feel you never let me heal am I going insane or is negligence real
The reality is there’s no room for this pig serotonin has told me it’s my turn to dig
Fire up and incinerate worthless remains
And watch as his pestilent
Rot turns to flames


Festering your absence, a sickness that sleeps in the back of my brain
You maggot, you coward
You scream and she cowers
But you never gave a shit
Oh here we go again
I watched you as you threw her to the floor
Oh my god
I wish you’d die
Ooooooooooooooofuck

What so you think your a man?
Standing there with a bottle in your hand

I will never forget
The look on your face
A sorrowful swine, put you in your place

Burn x3
Fucking burn bitch

David:
Visions of your oh sweet blissful death
Haunt my mind like the coldest ever taunting breath
So Luring, whispering thoughts more twisted
Escalating to dreaming of the tomb I would visit
Once setting flame to flesh
Embers enlighten
Reflecting in the joyous tears bound to my eyes
Accompanied by bleakened smile
As I deliver you to the bowels of

HELL

Blood for blood
Clawing at the walls of my skull
I fear myself
So Luring, I can’t resist it

You fucking dead beat

I hope the next time I see your face is when Im fucking bashing it in

Writhing and rotting my brain is allotting a gas line of hate that connects to my body
This struggle to feel you never let me heal am I going insane or is negligence real
The reality is there’s no room for this pig serotonin has told me it’s my turn to dig
Fire up and incinerate worthless remains
And watch as his pestilent Rot turns to flames
