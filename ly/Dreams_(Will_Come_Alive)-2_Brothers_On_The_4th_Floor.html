		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dreams to survive
Dreams make a wish come true, ooh
Keep your dreams alive
Dream, dream on
Your dream will come alive

Come on dream on
Come on dream on
Come on dream on, boy
Your dream will come alive
Come on dream on
Come on dream on
Come on dream on, boy
Your dream will come alive

Your dream will come alive

Your dream will come alive

Once again a song comin' strong
Here to remind you got to dream on
Go for what you know don't let it slide
Take a change let's ride
To the future not to the past
Take it easy and not to fast
Many failed in society
To blind to see you need to be free
Free from the strain that causes pain
Pain is the name and life is the game
Dream on try to survive
Keep hope alive reach for the sky
Do the best you can make a wish come true
Listen here's the clue, let it flow before it's all gone
Come on boy you got to dream on

Dreams to survive
Dreams make a wish come true, ooh
Keep your dreams alive
Dream, dream on
Your dream will come alive

Come on dream on
Come on dream on
Come on dream on, boy
Your dream will come alive
Come on dream on
Come on dream on
Come on dream on, boy
Your dream will come alive

Your dream will come alive

Your dream will come alive

Try to relax and move to the track
Go for your goals and don't hold it back
Strive to keep you dreams and hopes alive
Do it know and don't pass it by
Life is too short so give me your hand
I will lead you to another land
D. R. O. C. K. is here with the light
Shinin' bright 'cause I'm right
Close your eyes and just concentrate
It's never to late to erase the hate
Focus your mind when I say my rhymes
'Cause I'm always on time
Do the best you can make a wish come true
Listen here's the clue, let it flow before it's all gone
Come on boy you got to dream on

Dreams to survive
Dreams make a wish come true, ooh
Keep your dreams alive
Dream, dream on
Your dream will come alive

Come on dream on
Come on dream on
Come on dream on, boy
Your dream will come alive
Come on dream on
Come on dream on
Come on dream on, boy
Your dream will come alive

Dreams are the way to express yourself from the heart
Now it's time to depart
On a journey for the mind
Peace of mind is what you will find
Like Martin Luther King
I had a dream, that we all would sing
In peace and harmony comin' strong
Come on boy, you got to dream on

Dreams to survive
Dreams make a wish come true, ooh
Keep your dreams alive
Dream, dream on
Your dream will come alive

Come on dream on
Come on dream on
Come on dream on, boy
Your dream will come alive
Come on dream on
Come on dream on
Come on dream on, boy
Your dream will come alive

Your dream will come alive

Your dream will come alive
