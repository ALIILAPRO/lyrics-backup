		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Driving along, saw a cliff
That's a pretty big fall, I could break a rib
And if I drove off, I could start again but I won't
Side of the road, stretch my neck
It's so cold outside, I can see my breath
And if I slept here, I would catch my death but I won't
Instead I stare at my screen
Wallpaper still you and me
It's been a month and two weeks
Yeah, I've been counting the days
There's nowhere to hide
No matter how far I drive
If I'm dead or alive
I can't seem to escape
 
I'm just stuck on, stuck on you
There ain't nothing I can do
I'm just stuck on, stuck on you
There ain't nothing I can do, do
Yeah
 
Sleeping alone, head on fire
I keep the TV on just to occupy
'Cause I get too bored, can't control my mind 
And then I'm scared
Holding my breath, making it last
I'm running off feelings that I pull from the past
When you were so close, wish I could go back but I can't
 
So I just stare at my screen
Wallpaper still you and me
It's been four months and a week
Yeah, I've been counting the days
There's nowhere to hide
No matter how far I drive
If I'm dead or alive
I can't seem to escape
I'm just stuck on, stuck on you
There ain't nothing I can do
I'm just stuck on, stuck on you
There ain't nothing I can do, do
Yeah
 
I slept with new people, I muted your 'gram
I focus on friendships 'cause I hope they will last
I stay home on weekends to process the past
Supposed to be angry but that's not the vibe
I miss you like crazy but I know we weren't right
I try to stay hopeful but I'm lonely at night
 
I'm just stuck on, stuck on you (I'm just stuck on you, yeah)
There ain't nothing I can do
I'm just stuck on, stuck on you (oh oh)
There ain't nothing I can do, do (nothing I can do)
Yeah
 
I'm just stuck on, stuck on you
There ain't nothing I can do
Mmm, hmmm, hmmm, hmmm
