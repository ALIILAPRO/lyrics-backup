		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Traitor stands within the wolves' lair
Body count now imminent
Tension will rise, the air is on fire
This nightmare will not go on
Prophecy has touched my hand
The outcome starts here and now
Raise the flag as it burns
Nation's blood will not be lost

Take the war, taste the blood
Attack and continue, never surrender
We shall be victorious
Attack, continue, never, never surrender

Body hangs, piano wire plays
The music will relieve you
So delicate and lifeless now
Is innocence victorious?
Do you think I won't touch your grave?
Devotion to all insane
If war is lost you will die before I
Without dignity for all to see

Take the war, taste the blood
Attack and continue, never surrender
We shall be victorious
Attack, continue, never, never surrender

Terror won't end without you, my friend
This philosophy dreams of murder
Liquidated, now painless face
Death has come no one to mourn
Who will scream when all are gone?
Not for love, for the enemy
Fanatical zeal will bring this to an end
Divine providence, the world's end

Drink the war
Piano wire plays
Your body hangs
Piano wire plays

Take the war, taste the blood
Attack and continue, never surrender
We shall be victorious
Attack, never surrender
