		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Pop star but I'm your boyfriend's favorite DJ
Pay me just to party and I show up in my PJs
Hiding from the scene, I'm not looking for no drama
Doing my own thing, mind my business in my Prada
Pop star, fuck around and act like I'm a model
I don't like the cameras but I love it when you ogle
Hiding from the scene, I'm not looking for no drama
Doin' my own thing, mind my business in my Prada

Pop star
Pop star, pop star
Pop star
Pop star, pop star

I'm a real pop girly, no room for fuckin' posers
Blackout one night, next morning not hungover
We pull up in the Rover with bottles and a chauffeur
Not my fault that your man can't win us over
Looking this good doesn't come for free
If you wanna hang with bad bitches, there's gonna be a fee
We own the VIP
We chugging martinis
We on our Mariah shit
Yeah, skinny
Dior across my shirt
You bitches chirp, chirp
Trueys on my ass
And your boyfriend wanna tap
Pop star lifestyle, I'm in a hurry
No time for you crusty, ugly, scary little girlies

You're disrespectful, you're disrespectful
I don't really care if I'm a handful
You're disrespectful, you're disrespectful
Don't wanna be friends, I'm too special
You're disrespectful, you're disrespectful
I don't really care if I'm mental
You're disrespectful, you're disrespectful
Fuck you and all your friends, ho

Pop star but I'm your boyfriend's favorite DJ
Pay me just to party and I show up in my PJs
Hiding from the scene, I'm not looking for no drama
Doing my own thing, mind my business in my Prada
Pop star, fuck around and act like I'm a model
I don't like the cameras but I love it when you ogle
Hiding from the scene, I'm not looking for no drama
Doing my own thing, mind my business in my Prada

Pop star
Pop star, pop star
Pop star
Pop star, pop star

You bitches just really don't understand
That you cannot compete when you don't compare
Like, there's really levels to this shit
And the level that I'm on? Bitch
