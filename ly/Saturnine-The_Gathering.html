		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The day you went away
You had to screw me over
I guess you didn't know
All the stuff you left me with
Is way too much to handle
But I guess you don't care

You don't need to preach
You don't have to love me, all the time

Whatever on earth possessed you
To make this bold decision
I guess you don't need me
While whispering those words
I cried like a baby
Hoping you would care

You don't need to preach
You don't have to love me, all the time

You don't have to preach
All the time
