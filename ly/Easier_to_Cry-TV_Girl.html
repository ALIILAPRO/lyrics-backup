		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Cigarette between her fingers
And a drink in her hand
She thought about the days
When her looks were still in demand
And wondered where the time had gone
When did everything go wrong

No more flowers at her door
No more phone calls to wait up for

And she just wanted to die
But it was easier, it was easier to cry, cry
To cry, cry

Remembered fingers running through her
Hair as she wept got up to fix another drink
And cursed the memory she kept
When Jack would ease her heavy heart
And Jim would keep her from the dark
Woke up in her clothes and she smiled
And said romance was out of style

She just wanted to die
But it was easier, it was easier to cry, cry
To cry, cry they’re just tears for the cause
Tracks for the lost betrayed by the heart
Waiting for sorrow to dissolve

But it’s so easy to it's so easy to

To cry, cry x5
