		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They'll say, no one can see us
That we're estranged and all alone
They believe nothing can reach us
And pull us out of the boundless gloom

They're wrong
They're wrong
They're wrong
Yeah, baby, they're wrong
They're wrong
They're wrong

They'll say the sun is dying
And the fragile can't be saved
And the cold, it will devour us
And we won't rise up and slay giants

They're wrong
They're wrong
They're wrong
Yeah, baby, they're wrong
They're wrong
They're wrong

It takes a leap of faith
To awake from these delusions
You are the coder and avatar
A star

They'll say, no one will find us
That we're estranged and all alone
They believe nothing can reach us
And pull us out of the boundless gloom

They're wrong
They're wrong
They're wrong
Babe, they're wrong
They're wrong
They're wrong
