		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fade to one, he's all I desire
And so's begun to mourning after
All I've become
And it's here I've shown what has gone before
And was once

Soft, sweet as the air
I longed to stay with you
Or did I belong to my song?
Here I'll wonder, soldier on

Fade to one, he's all I desire
And so's begun to mourning after
All I've become
And it's here I've shown what has gone before
And was once

Soft, sweet as the air
I longed to stay with you
Or did I belong to my song?
Here I'll wonder, soldier on

Ah-la-la-la-la, la-la
Ah-la-la-la-la, la-la
All dismal inside of him, oh
