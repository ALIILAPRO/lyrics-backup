		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We used to friends
Now look at us
This conversation’s stale
Barely holding up
If I had a time machine I’d use it now
To fix all that went wrong and reminisce about

All of the good times
All of the good times
We had plenty
Just a past life
Is all it seems like
What a pity

I’m caught in the middle
You don’t want me around
But you want me to stay with you
You play my heart like a fiddle
make me think that somehow
Everything will work out with you

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Let’s work it out

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Let’s work it out

And I don’t blame myself or you or anyone
Sometimes circumstance is falling out of love
And if we stay I know it’s not an easy fix
But either way I’m here right now to work on this

I’m caught in the middle
You don’t want me around
But you want me to stay with you
You play my heart like a fiddle
make me think that somehow
Everything will work out with you

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Let’s work it out

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Let’s work it out


We still can be friends
Just look at us
Might not be that close
But we are close enough
And I don’t have a time machine
No not at all
Doesn’t mean that all we’ve built up has to fall

We’ll still have good times
We’ll still have good times
We’ll have plenty
It’s not a past life
It’s just you and I
And all our feelings
