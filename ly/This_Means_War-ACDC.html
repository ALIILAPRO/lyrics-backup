		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Oooh, we're gettin' ready 
Ow 
Here we go 
hahaha 
I'm ready 
Oooh) 

Getting ready to rock 
Getting ready to roll 
I'm gonna turn up the heat 
I'm gonna fire up the coal 
I gotta keep that motor turning 
I gotta keep that engine clean 
I gotta keep those tires burning 
I've got the best you've ever seen 

And I'm a heatseeker charging up the sky 
And I'm a heatseeker, and I, I don't need no life preserver 
I don't need no one to hose me down 
To hose me down 

Getting ready to break 
Getting ready to go 
Get your shoes off and shake 
Get your head down and blow 
You gotta keep that woman firing 
You gotta keep that serpent clean 
You gotta make her sound the siren 
You gotta hear that lady scream 

Cause I'm a heatseeker, burning up the town 
And I'm a heatseeker, I don't, I don't need no life preserver 
I don't need no one to hose me down 
Don't hose me down 

(Aw yeah, here ya go, yow! Ready? Heatseeker!) 

I want to see you get up 
And see the whites of your eyes 
And I'm a heatseeker, heatseeker, yeah! 
I'm gonna measure you up 
I'm gonna try you for size 
And I'm a heatseeker 
Gotta keep that motor turning 
You gotta keep that engine clean 
You gotta keep those tires burning 
I've got the best you've ever seen 

And I'm a heatseeker, and I don't need no life preserver 
I don't need no one to hose me down, woah 
I'm a heatseeker 
And I'm a heatseeker 
Heatseeker 

Out on the street feel the heat
