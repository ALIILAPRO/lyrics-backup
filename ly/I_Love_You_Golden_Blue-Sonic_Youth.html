		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dead boy stares 
Strange to meet you 
Dead boy cares 
So great to see you 

Is it time to go 
It's a place I know 
I can't read your mind 
I can't find the time 
I can't feel the thrill 
I don't have the will 

Dead boy dares 
Believe in you 
Dead boy stares 
Afraid that you will see him 

Is it time to go 
Is it a place I know 
I can't read your mind 
I can't find the time 
I can't feel the thrill 
I don't have the will 

I love you 
A metallic blue 
I love you 
Golden blue 
I miss you 
Shine all alone 
I miss you 

Don't know what to do 
I don't glitter like the stars above 
I don't glow like neon alone 
Don't blush it's just the wind outside 
Don't rush to be by my side
