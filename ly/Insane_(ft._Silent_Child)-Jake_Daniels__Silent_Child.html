		  Intro -

We’re insane
Just a little bit
Only a little bit
Not okay
But they don’t give they a shit
No
They’re not listening

Verse -

Put my right hand on the Bible
swear I’m gonna tell the whole truth with my eyes closed
Everybody fake on the net, it’s alright tho
We’re a bunch a messed up kids from the cycle
Here it goes -
Step 1. Be like everybody else that you see
Step 2. Go to college and get you any degree
Step 3. Gotta marry someone that you ain’t gon see cause you go to work everyday sitting at your seat
Just

Just a little bit
only a little bit

We’re insane
Just a little bit
only a little bit
Not okay
But they don’t give they a shit
No
They’re not listening

Verse 2 -

You put your hand on the Bible
Swear to God I see the white lies with my eyes closed
Liar, liar, pants on fire blowing smoke in my eyes
You a wolf in sheep’s skin, what a fuckin surprise yeah
I’m not phased by it, I’m the silent type, but I been too quiet
I guess the new viral trend is fake shit, and fucking everybody over till we make it
Well

Pre -

Don’t waste your life
Tryna be someone that you know you’re not

Chorus -

We’re insane
Just a little bit
only a little bit
Not okay
But they don’t give they a shit
No
They’re not listening
We’re insane
Just a little bit
only a little bit
Not okay
But they don’t give they a shit
No
They’re not listening

Bridge -

Drinking ain’t healthy drugs don’t help me
The world don’t want me to love me
Life in the backseat, seems so relaxing until you realize it’s a crime scene
We’re running outta time, how many gotta fall just so one can stay alive
Insanity’s a one way flight, and I don’t wanna lose my mind

Chorus -

We’re insane
Just a little bit
only a little bit
Not okay
But they don’t give they a shit 
No
They’re not listening
We’re insane
Just a little bit
only a little bit
Not okay
But they don’t give they a shit
No
They’re not listening
