		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The hardest pill to swallow
Is knowing that tomorrow you're not mine, mine, mine
If I don't get to have you
Thank God our matching tattoos last for life, life, life

Oh, I know I can't help if you meet someone else
If you meet someone else

You can take her home, she can get you high
You can hold her heart even after you broke mine
You can kiss her softly, never make her cry
You can tell her that you love her, as long as it's a lie

As long as it's a lie
Promise you'll lie
Promise you'll lie

I still kept the ring
Even if I'll never be your bride, why? Why?
You can grow old together
As long as the last name on your lips is mine, mine, mine

Oh, I know I can't help if you meet someone else
If you meet someone else

You can take her home, she can get you high
You can hold her heart even after you broke mine
You can kiss her softly, never make her cry
You can tell her that you love her, as long as it's a lie

As long as it's a lie
Promise you'll lie
Promise you'll lie
As long as it's a lie
Promise you'll lie
Promise you'll lie
