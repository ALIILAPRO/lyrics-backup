		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Loaded uptown 'til your feet fall off
Hold yourself down 'til you can't come up
Hard times in the promised land
Looking for a thief in the common man
Every little sign is a thing to you
Every line's just another clue
Was it the butler or the boy in blue
That made you steal the heart?

'Cause it's not fair to grow inside
When from the outside in it looks so right
But inside our life it seems unkind
And when the wolves they scream like killing dogs
'Cause it's not fair to tell a lie
Forever unwashed dream that seems so rife
And if you didn't know better you'd swear sometimes
That you never knew love

Toe the line, hard to find
Told to fight for something you love in life

Worry deep down 'til you're skin and bone
Mold yourself now that the picture's stopped
Hard yards in the castle sand
Slipping through the fingers of a modern man
Every little sign is a thing is true
Every time, it's another you
We'll see the father of your mother's bruise
That made you fall apart

'Cause it's not fair to grow inside
When from the outside in it looks so right
But inside our life it seems unkind
And when the wolves they scream like killing dogs
'Cause it's not fair to tell a lie
Forever unwashed dream that seems so rife
And if you didn't know better you'd swear sometimes
That you never knew love

Toe the line, hard to find
Told to fight for something you love in life
Toe the line, cold but kind
Hard to find your something to love in life

Have you ever had to walk away
From something that's cold light in the light of day?
My town, my fault
I'm feeling lost in haze
I never had to walk away
But can I be on your mind?
I've seldom lost my way
You never knew nothing lies
Have you ever had to walk away
From something that you loved yesterday?
I saw the three-four-five
The three looked lost in yester me
I never had to walk away
Now can I be on your mind?
I seldom lost my way
'Cause you never knew love

Toe the line, hard to find
Told to fight for something you love in life
Toe the line, cold but kind
Hard to find your something to love in life

In life
In life
In life
In life
In life
In life
In life
In life
In life
In life
In life
In life
