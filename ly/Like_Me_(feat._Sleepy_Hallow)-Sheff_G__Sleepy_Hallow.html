		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Know they gon', yeah, ayy
I know they gon' act like they like me
Yeah, I'm prayin' heavy, but I'm sinnin' bitch 
Still up on my menace shit
Look

Huh, I know they gon' act like they like me
Huh, I bet you they gon' act like they like me
Huh, I know they gon' act like they like me
Huh, bet you they gon' act like they like me

Yeah, I'm prayin' heavy, but I'm sinnin' bitch 
still up on my menace shit, huh
Bullets hot, bet you don't wanna feel this shit
Run with extended clips, huh
Don't do friendships, huh
I rather take a sentence than a death wish
We be on some next shit, on some vexed shit
Hot nines get to spittin', this ain't Flex, bitch
Fear all of us, huh 
Look, I can make you fear all of us
Only two ways out, jail or the doves
Better choose a route, stand on your worth, huh
I bet they don't understand where I'm from, huh
I been in the gym, she been sticky like some gum, huh
She said she a fan, Winners Circle number one, huh
But niggas hatin', so you gotta keep a gun, uh
They can't relate, so you don't talk to no one, uh
Ran out of patience, can't be trustin' no one, huh
I got a feelin' that I shouldn't show nothin' to 'em
Just pay attention to the ones you lay close to

Huh, I know they gon' act like they like me
Huh, I bet you they gon' act like they like me
Huh, I know they gon' act like they like me
Huh, I bet they gon' act like they like me

I bet they gon' put a front up, light a blunt up
Let some niggas bring you down for a come up
Flexin' with your hunnids, I hope you don't love 'em
Know you see the fake shit, don't trust 'em
