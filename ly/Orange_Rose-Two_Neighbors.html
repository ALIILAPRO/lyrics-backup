		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You walked in the room and
All I saw was red
You walked in the room and
All I smelled was fire
When we first met
All I felt was yellow
A sunrise in my soul
Kept lifting me higher
And I love you
My orange rose
I love you
My orange rose
Well I don’t know where it came from
And I don’t know where it goes
I tried to deny it
Rationalize my truth
I still reach out my hand
Even when your thorns are so cruel
But I love to love you
Like a wild rose
I don’t need to de-thorn you
Although it hurts to hold
And I love you
My orange rose
I love you
My orange rose
Well I don’t know where it came from
And I don’t know where it goes
Well I don’t know where it came from
And I don’t know where it goes
I can’t talk around you
I feel like a fool
I hate the world without you
It’s so blue
