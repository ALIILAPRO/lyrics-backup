		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Dim, dum, dum, bim gum-gum, bim-gum-gum)
Tall, and tan, and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking and
When she passes each one, she passes, goes, "ah!"

When she walks she's like a samba 
That swings so cool and sways so gently
That when she passes each one, she passes, goes, "ah!"

Oh, but he watches her so sadly
How can he tell her he loves her?
Yes, he would give his heart gladly
But each day when she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead not at him

Oh, but he sees her so sadly
How can he tell her he loves her?
Yes, he would give his heart gladly
But each day when she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead not at him

Tall, and tan, and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes, he smiles
But she doesn't see

She just doesn't see
No, she doesn't see
But she doesn't see
