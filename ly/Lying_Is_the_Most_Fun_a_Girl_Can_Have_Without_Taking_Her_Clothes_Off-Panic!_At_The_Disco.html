		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Is it still me that makes you sweat?
Am I who you think about in bed?
When the lights are dim and your hands are shaking
As you're sliding off your dress?
Then think of what you did
And how I hope to God he was worth it
When the lights are dim
And your heart is racing as your fingers touch his skin

I've got more wit, a better kiss
A hotter touch, a better fuck
Than any boy you'll ever meet
Sweetie, you had me
Girl, I was it, look past the sweat
A better love deserving of
Exchanging body heat in the passenger seat
No, no, no, you know it will always just be me

Let's get these teen hearts beating faster, faster

So testosterone boys and harlequin girls
Will you dance to this beat
And hold a lover close?
So testosterone boys and harlequin girls
Will you dance to this beat
And hold a lover close?

So I guess we're back to us
Oh, cameraman, swing the focus
In case I lost my train of thought 
Where was it that we last left off? (let's pick up, pick up)

Oh, now I do recall
We just were getting to the part
Where the shock sets in
And the stomach acid finds a new way to make you get sick
I hope you didn't expect to get all of the attention
Let's not get selfish
Did you really think I'd let you kill this chorus?

Let's get these teen hearts beating faster, faster

So testosterone boys and harlequin girls
Will you dance to this beat
And hold a lover close?
So testosterone boys and harlequin girls
Will you dance to this beat
And hold a lover close?

Dance to this beat
Dance to this beat
Dance to this beat

Let's get these teen hearts beating faster, faster
Let's get these teen hearts beating faster

I've got more wit, a better kiss
A hotter touch, a better fuck
Than any boy you'll ever meet
Sweetie, you had me
Girl, I was it, look past the sweat
A better love deserving of
Exchanging body heat in the passenger seat
No, no, no, you know it will always just be me

Let's get those teen hearts beating faster, faster

So testosterone boys and harlequin girls
Will you dance to this beat
And hold a lover close?

So testosterone boys and harlequin girls
Will you dance to this beat
And hold a lover close?

So testosterone boys and harlequin girls
Dance to this beat
So testosterone boys and harlequin girls
Dance to this beat

Let's get these teen hearts beating faster, faster
Let's get these teen hearts beating faster
