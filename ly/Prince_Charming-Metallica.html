		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's a black cloud overhead that's me 
And the poison ivy chokes the tree again it's me 
I'm the filthy one on bourbon street you walk on by 
I'm the little boy that pushes hard and makes it cry 
There's a dirty needle in your child ha ha stick me 
Empty bottles still in hand still dead still me 
I'm the suit and tie that breaks the street and still wants more 
I'm the 45 that's in your mouth I'm a dirty, dirty whore, yeah 

Look, it's me 
The one who can't be free 
Much too young to focus but too old to see 
Hey look it's me 
When no one wants to see 
See what you brought this world just what you want to see 
Hey ma, hey ma, look it's me 

Yeah he wants to become father now me again, me 
The marks inside your arms still leaves me alone to me 
I'm the nothing face that plants a bomb and strolls away 
I'm the one who doesn't look quite right as children play

Yeah, look it's me 
The one who can't be free 
Much too young to focus but too old to see 
Hey look it's me 
When no one wants to see 
See what you brought this world just what you want to see 
Hey ma, hey ma, look it's me 
It's me 

Look up to me 
What you've been and what you've feared 
Look up to me look it's me, what you hear 
See right through me see the one who can't be free 
See right through me look it's me when no one wants to see 
Hey, hey, hey 

Hm, now see the black cloud overhead that's me 
Hm, in this poison ivy chokes the tree again it's me 
And I'm the filthy one on bourbon street you walk on by 
And I'm the little boy that pushes, pushes makes it cry 
Yeah look it's me 
The one who can't be free 
Much too young to focus but too old to see hey, hey 
Look it's me 
When no one wants to see 
See what you brought this world just what you want to see 
Hey ma, hey ma, look it's me yeah 
It's me 
Hey ma, hey ma, look it's me 
See right though me look up to me 
See right though me look up to me
