		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm all out of ways
To tell you how this got away
How this got away
I'm all out of ways
To tell you how this got away
How this got away

Ooh it's hard to hear your voice
It's how we live
It's tough to stay away (yeah)
Just say another way

You wanna lay low
You wanna stay safe
Let's make a home, mm

We pour it through these days
I tell you how we'll get away
But let's not spill these days
A common inner phase
Feeling how we'll keep you safe
How we'll keep you safe

Ooh, it's hard to hear your voice
It's how we live
It's tough to stay away
Just say another way
Don't stay away
Make love all day, hm hm

You wanna lay low
You wanna stay safe
Let's make a home, mm

Ooh, I wanna live here
Ooh, I wanna live here (not without you)
Ooh, this pace grows now summer's gone
Ooh, this pace grows now summer's gone

You wanna lay low
You wanna stay safe
Let's make a home, mm

You wanna lay low
You wanna stay safe
Let's make a home, mm

You wanna lay low
You wanna stay safe
Let's make a home (let's make a home), mm

You wanna lay low
You wanna stay safe
Let's make a home (let's make a home), mm
