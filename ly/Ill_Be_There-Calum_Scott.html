		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Whatcha hiding?
A little light has gone
You paint a smile on
And I can tell there's something wrong
No silver lining
When you're trying to take the world on alone (alone)

We're all reaching in the dark
Trying to find the answer
Before we fall apart
I can keep you steady on your feet
You can take a moment
To tell me what you need

When you start to doubt all the things you believe in
Fall so many times that you don't even feel it
When you've got love but it isn't enough
I'll be there (I'll be there)
And if you're getting lost on another horizon
And all you really need is somebody to find you
When you've got love but it isn't enough
I'll be there (I'll be there)

I'm not trying to tell you
That I can take it all away
But I'm just saying
That I can take a little weight
If you need saving
Then maybe we can save each other (save each other)

We're all reaching in the dark
Trying to find the answer
Before we fall apart
I can keep you steady on your feet
You can take a moment
To tell me what you need

When you start to doubt all the things you believe in
Fall so many times that you don't even feel it
When you've got love but it isn't enough
I'll be there (I'll be there)
And if you're getting lost on another horizon
And all you really need is somebody to find you
When you've got love but it isn't enough
I'll be there (I'll be there)

You're not alone
Just learn to let go
Reach out in the dark
You'll see how many of us there are
You're not alone
Just learn to let go
Reach out in the dark
Reach out in the dark

When you start to doubt all the things you believe in
Fall so many times that you don't even feel it
When you've got love but it isn't enough
I'll be there (I'll be there)
And if you're getting lost on another horizon
And all you really need is somebody to find you
When you've got love but it isn't enough
I'll be there (I'll be there)
