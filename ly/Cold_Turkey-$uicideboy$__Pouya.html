		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hot boy, BG (BG), that's the way these young niggas eat (eat)
Drinking on syrup can't sleep (can't sleep)
Drinking on syrup can't sleep (can't sleep)
Hot boy, BG (BG), that's the way these young niggas eat (eat)
Drinking on syrup can't sleep (can't sleep)
Drinking on syrup can't sleep (can't sleep)
Hot boy, BG (BG), that's the way these young niggas eat (eat)
Drinking on syrup can't sleep (can't sleep) 
Drinking on syrup can't sleep (can't sleep)

Every night I'm drinkin' on syrup, can't sleep
Hi-Tech, promethazine, real cheap
Codeine got me on the loc' in the creep
Smoked out, riding with Uzi in the Jeep
Buffet Boys with the $uicide, know that we druggin'
Look at my face, bitch, I'm numb, can't feel nothing
Stealing they place, and it got y'all all bugging
You won't say no names, but who else you see bussing?
Just me and my cousin, stay bustin' and cuttin'
These motherfuckers only nuttin' and puffin'
Let's see how it's jumping
When we up in public, don't bring out the old me
'Cause then I'll start dumping, the blood will start gushing
All because of yo' fronting
51-50, bitch, I don't do bluffing

Hot boy, BG (BG), that's the way these young niggas eat (eat)
Drinking on syrup can't sleep (can't sleep)
Drinking on syrup can't sleep (can't sleep)
Hot boy, BG (BG), that's the way these young niggas eat (eat)
Drinking on syrup can't sleep (can't sleep)
Drinking on syrup can't sleep (can't sleep)

Before I hit the blunt, I gotta pop a couple Oxy
Cherry flavor Coke, I flip the cap, and now I'm sloppy
Copy-cat motherfucker looking like a pussy, I will fuck you up, boy
And your squad won't stop me! Aye
Call me a snake in the wrong habitat
Give me a name, I will swallow the rat whole
Cold like the fucking polar icecaps
In a black Cadillac, killing myself in the back
Gaudy pack shawty smokin' blasts
Toting bags full of masks
Pop a tag off the motherfucking body bag
Oddy have a problem, prolly never gonna solve 'em
Spotted cat looking like a fallen angel with no halo
Fuckboy funeral, bitch, I may go captain insane-o
Side bitch and my enemy is the same hoe
(Drinking on syrup can't sleep)

Hot boy, BG (BG), that's the way these young niggas eat (eat)
Drinking on syrup can't sleep (can't sleep)
Drinking on syrup can't sleep (can't sleep)
Hot boy, BG (BG), that's the way these young niggas eat (eat)
Drinking on syrup can't sleep (can't sleep)
Drinking on syrup can't sleep (can't sleep)

Yuh, yuh
Exuberant lunatics hop out the whip
Like Young Thug and get through with it
I dated your momma, sedated your father
Then threw his body to the ocean, he sank to the bottom
I ain't Lil Scrappy, but baby, you don't want no problems
Who is that in the back of the Cadillac with the MAC?
Cocked back, ready to bang into his own brain
Triple $ be the set don't disrespect me
Got hunnid more hoes just from this EP
One shell to your back, you a ninja turtle
Put your whole dead body in a fucking hurdle
I don't want to, but if I have to I will hurt you
And if my lil ass can't do it myself, my lil homie will murk you
Your girl is my bitch, I know you smell the perfume, yuh
