		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, I'm running, police on my back
I've been hiding, police on my back
There was a shooting, police on my back
And the victim, well, he won't come back

I've been running, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
Running, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday

What have I done? What have I done?
What have I done?

Yes, I'm running down the railway track
Won't you help me? Police on my back
They will catch me if I dare drop back
Won't you give me all the speed I lack?

I've been running, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
Running, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday

What have I done? What have I done?
What have I done? What have I done?

Yes, I'm running down the railway track
Won't you help me? Police on my back
They will catch me if I dare drop back
Won't you help me all the speed I lack?

I've been running, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
Running, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday

What have I done? What have I done?

Yes, I'm running, police on my back
Hiding, police on my back
Running, police on my back
Hiding, police on my back

Yes, I'm running down the railway track
Won't you help me? Police on my back
They will catch me if I dare drop back
Won't you help me find the speed I lack?

I've been running
Hiding
Running
