		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I go where you go
Go through Armageddon
Girl I got you
Theres no goodbyes only us
So I will follow
Hold you close standing on the edge of no tomorrow
Still deep in us, get that rush
So I still follow

I been feeling high when I touch your body
That's how I feel the soul inside her body
Can't believe my eyes I swear
You gloat I follow you close
Fingertips touch, all I want your body
Fingertips touch all I want

All I want
All I ever wanted
It's in front of me
Right in front of me
What have I done
Now I never done
This could be the end of me
Be the end of me

I go where you go
Go through Armageddon
Girl I got you
Theres no goodbyes only us
So I will follow
Hold you close standing on the edge of no tomorrow
Still deep in us, get that rush
So I still follow

I been feeling like I deserve somebody
And you burn so bright you can blind somebody
You go following flights to the stars
And these cars can get us home

All I want
All I ever wanted
It's in front of me
Right in front of me
What have I done
Now I never done
This could be the end of me
Be the end of me

I go where you go
Go through Armageddon
Girl I got you
Theres no goodbyes only us
So I will follow
Hold you close standing on the edge of no tomorrow
Still deep in us, get that rush
So I still follow

As long as you feeling the same
I, I'll follow you into the flames (I, I)
As long as you feeling the same
I, I'll follow you into the flames (I, I)

I go where you go
Go through Armageddon
Girl I got you
Theres no goodbyes only us
So I will follow
Hold you close standing on the edge of no tomorrow
Still deep in us, get that rush
So I still follow
