		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I woke up in Japan
Feeling low, feeling lonely
The best I ever had
It was more than half empty
I woke up in Japan
I'm feeling low, feeling lonely
The best I ever had
It was more than half empty

It was more than just a neon weekend
Life slipping through the third floor, curtain
Spreading out like the morning news
From the day before

Falling fast, breathing slow
Time is up, the end is just a dream
Just a dream

I woke up in Japan
I'm feeling low, I'm feeling lonely
And the best I ever had
It was more than half empty

It's enough to let the night let go of me
A few steps into the open doorway
Heart pounding, there's a noise complaint
From room 304

Falling fast, breathing slow
Time is up, the end is just a dream
Just a dream

I woke up in Japan
Feeling low, feeling lonely
The best I ever had
It was more than half empty
I woke up in Japan
I'm feeling low, I'm feeling lonely
The best I ever had
It was more than half empty
I woke up in Japan, whoa
I woke up in Japan, whoa
