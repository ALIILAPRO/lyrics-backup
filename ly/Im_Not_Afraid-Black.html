		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The cotton is high
The field is still full
The dust is drifting everywhere
A harvest moon comes up in the sky
The blues to shake me, wake me
It's a long way down to the birth of the blues
I haven't very far to fall since they were born
and came to haunt this singing fool since day one

There's so many ways to sing the blues
I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid, not afraid
I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid, to let them break me

A harvest moon comes up in the sky
The cotton chokes me, makes me dry
I know that I'm unafraid and so I am
Just a ghost that walks through the room
I'll blame it on the moonshine brew; whisky and wine
Like dust in my eyes making pats of kidney

There's so many ways to sing the blues
I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid, not afraid
I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid, to let them break me

The cotton is high
The field is still full
The dust is drifting everywhere
No! It's happening again, the blues are shaking, waking me
It's a long way down to the birth of the blues
I haven't very far to fall since they were born
And came to haunt this singing fool since day one

There's so many ways to sing the blues
I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid, not afraid
I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid, to let them break me
