		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  London City, far from pretty
2-0-0-5
A lady down in Paddington
Is fighting just to stay alive
Rhythmic beeps and blood-stained sheets
Our lady weeps, she's tired and frail
To set the scene we must rewind 
The hands of time for Violet's tale

Violet was a silent girl
Grew up with violent starts
Her mother was a drinker
And her father was a bastard
Every night he'd tuck her tight
But never left the room
I'll spare you of the things he did
I'm sure her mother knew

Violet was a silent girl
She moved out at sixteen
A semi-detached council flat
Paid for by a welfare-scheme
Packing shelves at Tesco's
Stacking jars like pickled bricks
She met a boy named Stevie
And he was a little prick

Violet was a silent girl
And Violet, she fell fast
See, Stevie was a wrongin'
But he sure knew how to charm her
Every night he'd tuck her tight
But never left the room
History repeats itself
He'd paint her black and blue and, ah

She never stood a chance
The Devil comes to dance

Violet, why you always so quiet?
On her bedroom door and he's irate
He's been drinking and smoking, he's up late
And he stands by her bedside, she shakes
But her eyes stay shut
You fucking slut, I know you're up
And he pinches her eyelids and folds them up
Violet, why you lying to me, Violet?
She stays silent, things turn violent
That's the sound of his fists when they fall like a crashing pilot

Hit like hailstones
One to the collarbone, full force, full-blown
Blood splat, bone crack, knick-knack-paddy-whack
One to the jaw and a tooth spat, detached
Fist connects and disconnects the bone
A quick deflect to misdirect the blow
But nonetheless, his punches met her throat
Such a mess, he's left her bruised and broke
Violet, why you always so quiet, Violet? 
Why you such a little liar, Violet?
Do you think I want to do this, Violet?
In character, she stays silent
Well say something, Violet, silence
Fucking say something, Violet, silence
Wait, say something, Violet
Not one word, she stays quiet

London City, far from pretty
2-0-0-5
A lady rushed to Paddington
Is fighting just to stay alive
The doctor in a state of shock
Saw something here so very wrong
See Violet, she was pregnant
Poor Violet, she was nine months gone

Turning to the doctor 
Violet broke her silence and she cried
"If I'm to die right here tonight
Please let my baby stay alive"
The doctor soon regained composure
Called the surgeon to come in
As Violet's world turned to black
The curtains closed
The lights went dim

In London City, far from pretty
2-0-0-5
A lady down in Paddington
Just lost the fight to stay alive
A tragedy or a miracle
It happened on these very streets
Two twins are lying side by side

A girl named Jenny
And a boy named Screech
