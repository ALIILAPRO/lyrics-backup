		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Funny thing, back when I was still dead
You tried it all, gave your best
And you had your story from what you told me
Maybe put it to bed, said my brain not my chest
And find that it's only I just feel a bit lonely
Too close to leave but too far to reach
Well, what's family if not bittersweet?

Is anybody out there?
Is somebody listening?
'Cause you call me dramatic
But damn it, I've had it
Damn it, I've had it
Is anybody out there?
Is somebody listening?
'Cause you call me dramatic
But damn it, I've had it
I feel so pathetic
With my stupid heart
My stupid heart
My stupid heart

No, I can't fix it all
But if I don't, will it fall?
I should be a big girl
Still hurt like a kid, though
Too close to leave but too far to reach
What's family if not bittersweet?

Is anybody out there?
Is somebody listening?
'Cause you call me dramatic
But damn it, I've had it
Damn it, I've had it
Is anybody out there?
Is somebody listening?
'Cause you call me dramatic
But damn it, I've had it
I feel so pathetic

I just wish that you weren't on my mind all the time (all the time)
Know that I will only need some time and that's fine, but it's kinda
Like you're just on your island and I am ever trying to get back to you

Is anybody out there?
Is somebody listening?
'Cause you call me dramatic
But damn it, I've had it
Damn it, I've had it
Is anybody out there?
Is somebody listening?
'Cause you call me dramatic
So why don't you kill me?
I feel so pathetic
With my stupid heart
My stupid heart
My stupid heart
