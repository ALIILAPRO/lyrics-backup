		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You got it goin' 
Yeah 

Girl I want to play a little game with you 
'Cause I kinda like the things you do 
Maybe we could do a crazy thing or two 
Tonight I want to spend my time with you 

Girl I like your body 
And I think you're sexy 
You got things that turn me on 

[Chorus] 
You got it goin' crazy 
You got it goin' on 
You got it goin' on 
You got it goin' crazy 
You got it goin' on 
You got it goin' on 

Stop- what I'm thinkin' oughta be a crime 
And you shouldn't wear the things you do 
Oh my- let me dance real sexy from behind 
'Cause I want to show I'm into you 

Girl I like your body 
And I think you're sexy 
You got things that turn me on 

[Chorus: x2]
 
Don't worry about your brother 
Or what he's gonna do 
I want to be your lover 
And give it all to you 
Not talkin' about your sister 
She's done it all before 

[Chorus: x2]

You got it goin' 
You got it goin' 
You got it goin' 
Ha, ha, ho 

You got it goin' 
You got it goin' 
You got it goin' 
Yeah
