		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I read it somewhere on the internet
That when you're in my head there's a little chance
That you could be dreaming of me
And nothing is quite what it seems
'Cause it's been almost six months since we met
And eight weeks since you left me here
Is it true, I don't know
But I'd rather buy in than let you go
So last night at the movies
Or today waking up

Is it magical thinking
When you come out of nowhere
That I'm on your mind, like you're on mine?
Am I magical thinking
'Cause I wanna believe that
When I'm thinking of you, you're thinking of me too?
Mm
Mm

And maybe you found a somebody new
Who took my place, who's been distracting you
So why do I feel what I feel?
Like us being done isn't real
I wish I could be a fly on the wall
Do you care at all, like me?
I could pick up the phone
But I'm afraid that might leave me
Feeling more alone
But if I dreamt you still loved me
Would you book a flight home?

Is it magical thinking
When you come out of nowhere
That I'm on your mind, like you're on mine?
Am I magical thinking
'Cause I wanna believe that
When I'm thinking of you, you're thinking of me too?
Mm
Mm
Mm

When I'm thinking of you
Are you thinking of me too?
