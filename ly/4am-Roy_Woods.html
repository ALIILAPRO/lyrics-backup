		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fly to LA, Sunset Boulevard
Yeah
Cruisin' through West Hollywood

Girl, it's 4:00 in the morning, can you tell me why are you outside? (Outside)
Gotta pick up the Porsche, I just wanna see how well you gon' drive
How well you gon' drive
And you ain't gotta tell the truth to me, girl, you can lie if you gon' lie (gon' lie)
And I don't wanna know what's up, I'ma find what I'm gon' find out

Yeah, and you know if there's a problem, then it's on sight
And my nigga just died but I'm alright
Keep my diamonds in the cold like a Klondike
Had to show these little niggas how to ball right
Did a feature, now he soundin' what I sound like
If I send my dogs on you, they gon' all bite
All these VV's on my wrist gon' give me frostbite
You ain't got nothing to say
Lie if you want, not if you want me
It's not who you are, don't let it all fade
Lost in the sauce still tryna find me
Slide on the 9, fly on the highway
Leave from the club, fuck time, you're not late
Party on my side, live like it's '98

Girl, it's 4:00 in the morning, can you tell me why are you outside? (Outside)
Gotta pick up the Porsche, I just wanna see how well you gon' drive
How well you gon' drive
And you ain't gotta tell the truth to me, girl, you can lie if you gon' lie (gon' lie)
And I don't wanna know what's up, I'ma find what I'm gon' find out

Yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'ma find what I'm gon' find out
Oh
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Said I'ma find what I'm gon' find out

Yeah, I been rockin' out like I'm John Lennon
And life been like a party, it's so hard to get in
And he bleedin' on the street but don't call the medics
Said he ready for two twenty like it's Armageddon
And baby girl, I ain't tryna go back when you never move forward
Dealin' with your suicide like these Lamborghini doors
I would trade all I have just to get a lil' peace
Just to get a lil', get away a lil' more
I'm stuck between four walls
Only hit the stu then I'm headed right
I can't sleep with you at all
'Cause every time we do, girl, the feelings like crack
Still dealt with you though you did me dirty like that
Singing with you though I never bump no Fergie like that
What you doin' in the morning with them birdies like that?

Girl, it's 4:00 in the morning, can you tell me why are you outside? (Outside)
Gotta pick up the Porsche, I just wanna see how well you gon' drive
How well you gon' drive
And you ain't gotta tell the truth to me, girl, you can lie if you gon' lie (gon' lie)
And I don't wanna know what's up, I'ma find what I'm gon' find out

Find out
Ooh, I'm always gon' find out
Find out
Oh
Said I'ma find what I'm gon' find out
