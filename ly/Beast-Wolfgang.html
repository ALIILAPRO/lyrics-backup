		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And to the beast
I love you....
and to the beast
I'll have you
though sometimes you tear me apart
and to the beast I
need you
to keep the beating in my heart
and to the beast I want you
the lust I need to keep my spirits high
and to the beast
I'll kiss you
to give me dreams late at night

CHORUS
you can't run you can't hide
from what will find you alone on the night
you can't escape though you may try
the beast inside...

yes it's true
he comes undignified
but to my aid he has yet to deny
his power brings glory
but often drags shame
and if ever needed he'll show no restraint
surely alone in the dark corners
he cries succumbing the human inside
for as every man has a monster to beaware
so must a beast have somthing to bear oh

(Repeat Chorus)

and to the monster I introduce the man
though not as great the first
still somewhat so grand it's dignity
we can never understand for without the beast
there is no man

(Repeat Chorus)

the beast inside
the beast inside
the beast insideeee!!!!
the beast inside!!!!
