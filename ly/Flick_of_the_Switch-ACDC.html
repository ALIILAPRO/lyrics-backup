		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well there's a love gone down on mine
Suicidal voltage line
She sends signals outta distress
She devil, she evil
She got you reelin' on a rockin' machine

[Chorus]
With a flick of the switch
With a flick of the switch she'll blow you sky high
With a flick of the switch
With a flick of the switch she can satisfy

She gonna blow you all sky high
Flash the eye, electrify
A power force you should feel
She devil, she evil
She got you screaming on a lightnin' machine

[Chorus]

(Give you pain, blow your brain)
Flick the switch, flick the switch
With a flick of the switch, she'll blow you sky high
With a flick of the switch, she can satisfy
With a flick of the switch, razed to the ground
With a flick of the switch
With a flick of the switch
With a flick of the switch, she gonna give you pain
With a flick of the switch, she gonna blow your brain, blow your brain

She gonna put the light out on - you
