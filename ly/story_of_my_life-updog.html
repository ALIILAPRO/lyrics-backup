		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Verse 1:

Drenched in weak and hurtful lies,
Full of hate and self despise,
Way too often leave myself so high & dry. 
Always willing, never able,
Living out another fable,
Fighting with myself I don’t know why... no.

Pre-Chorus:

I make my worth a synonym,
With everything I've never been, 
And everything I’m never gonna be.

Chorus:

Wanna show you what I got, got, got,
Wanna see me at the top, top, top,
But I’m bringing me down, bringing me down, 
bringing me down, bringing me down.
Got, got, got,
Wanna see me at the top, top, top,
But I’m bringing me down, bringing me down, 
Yeah.. that’s the story of my life.
That’s the story of my life.
That’s the story of my life.

Verse 2:

Compliments, impossible,
I really can be so intolerable.
They tell me just take that win,
But I just find it all improbable.
I’m so facetious, conversations,
Are self deprecating competitions.
Joking at my own expense,
Another foolish form of self defense, so I...

Pre-Chorus:

Make my worth a synonym,
With everything I've never been,
And everything I’m never gonna be...

Chorus:

Wanna show you what I got, got, got,
Wanna see me at the top, top, top,
But I’m bringing me down, bringing me down, 
bringing me down, bringing me down.
Got, got, got,
Wanna see me at the top, top, top,
But I’m bringing me down, bringing me down, 
Yeah.. that’s the story of my life.
That’s the story of my life.
That’s the story of my life.
