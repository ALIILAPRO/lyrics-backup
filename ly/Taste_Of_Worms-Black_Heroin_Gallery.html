		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A cause
And effect
I can feel death
Wrapped around my neck

Formidable
But regrettable
God has opened
Pandora's box

I feel
Insane
There's nothing but blood
Dripping from my brain

Mortified
Crucified
Lovely zombies are
Coming my way

I have a gift for you
The dead have candy canes
The taste of worms
Is salty and sweet
Will you come with me
Come play in the dark
I am sorry
You can never return

Screaming crows
Wendigo foes
The forest is filled
With dire souls

Help me
Die
Darkness has witnessed
My only lie

The end of days
Has its ways
I hang roadkill
For the thrill

Untouched
But willing
To stand by and watch
All the killing

I have a gift for you
The dead have candy canes
The taste of worms
Is salty and sweet
I was just wondering
Will you kill for me
I promise you
I can hide you away

I have a gift for you
The dead have candy canes
The taste of worms
Is salty and sweet
Will you take that road
Where no one goes
I'll be at the end
With a devil's grin
