		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, woah yeah, woah
Yeah, woah yeah, woah

I'm at the top, don't think that I'm stoppin'
Makin' some songs, my fans tell me
"Drop 'em"
Designer on me and you know that I'm coppin'
Walk into Saks 'cause you
Know that I'm shoppin'
I'm in the top two and I'm not second
Bro got a choppa, he's holdin' that weapon
Feel like a teacher, I'll teach 'em a lesson
(BenjiCold, why you icy?)
Like Ash, already know I'ma catch 'em

I got that rocket on me, let's blast
Talkin' that shit? We beat your ass
You wanna talk, but don't got class
Countin' my money, I watch it add
Up in the bank and it never go down
The hollow tips on the motherfuckin' rounds
Do not think I can let my mama down
I'm doin' my best, I'ma make hеr proud
(yeah, yeah) do not think I want your ho
Sellin' out my shows
Balеnci' my toes, squad, I keep 'em close
This the life I chose, ain't do this alone
Stayin' with my bros, talk to me, boy
Watch your tone you want that smoke
So we pull up with sticks (Boom boom boom)
And now you don't wanna talk shit
I got a choppa, that shit finna rip
Beyblade, we gon' let that bitch spin
Shout-out the gang, yeah, shout out my twins
King of the dough, bitch, I always win
Do it for family, I do it for kin
Free all my brothers that's locked in the pen
I'm finna get a tat, that stick-n-poke
Only wanna talk shit through a damn phone
I been makin' money by singin' at home
Talkin' to me, boy, you bet' watch your tone
Shout-outs Antonio, RIP tone
She said I'm not shit
But I'm makin' her moan i feel like I'm Zee
'cause I'm up in New York
I'm puttin' in effort, I'm puttin' in work
I know your girl want me, yeah
She tryna flirt
I don't even want her, but I know you hurt
Come with the cash if you want a verse
Killin' my features, put 'em in a hearse
Kill them motherfuckers, put 'em in the dirt
I was real down bad, think I had a curse
But I'm up at the top, I ain't stoppin'
Know niggas hatin', I know that they watchin'
Accepting defeat, that cannot be me
I'm mixin' the Kapital with Louis V
I feel like Pharrell
I've been rockin' ICECREAM
Bapestas, know that they stay on the feet

Smokin' on gas, it's all in the brain
Link up with Sam when I'm off the plane
I never cared 'bout that shit they sayin'
Don't play with the stick, stick
Know you don't wan' get hit
Know I'm makin' them hit's, hit's
Know I cannot miss now
Wan' copy my fit's, fit's
Boy wanna be like me
He tellin' a fib, fib, I know that boy lyin'

I'm at the top, don't think that I'm stoppin'
Makin' some songs, my fans tell me
"Drop 'em"
Designer on me and you know that I'm coppin'
Walk into Saks 'cause you
Know that I'm shoppin'
I'm in the top two and I'm not second
Bro got a choppa, he's holdin' that weapon
Feel like a teacher, I'll teach 'em a lesson
Like Ash, already know I'ma catch 'em
