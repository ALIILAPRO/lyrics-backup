		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, I'm guessing that I'm your type
Maybe you could come by
We can do whatever you like
Oh, boy, promise that I won't cry
I know that I seem shy
But you'll never have it like mine

(Ooh ooh) Don't be afraid, no
(Ooh ooh) I'm not that fragile
(Ooh ooh) Got what you need, though
Just say you want me, don't let me go

It don't matter what you do
Do, do do, do do, do do
It don't matter what you do
Do, do do, do do, do do you're kinda toxic
But it only makes me wanna love you
It don't matter what you
It don't matter what you do

Oh, I like it when we slow kiss
After we get undressed
You can trace my silhouette
Oh, my therapy goes all night
I know that this ain't right
I just wanna stay in your head

(Ooh ooh) Don't be afraid, no
(Ooh ooh) I'm not that fragile
(Ooh ooh) Got what you need, though
Just say you want me, don't let me go
(Just say)

It don't matter what you do
Do, do do, do do, do do
It don't matter what you do
Do, do do, do do, do do you're kinda toxic
But it only makes me wanna love you
It don't matter what you
It don't matter what you do

Do do, do do, do do, do do
It don't matter what you do
Do, do do, do do, do do you're kinda toxic
But it only makes me wanna love you
It don't matter what you
It don't matter what you do

(Just say) do do, do do, do do, do do
Do do, do do, do do, do do
Do do, do do, do do, do do
Do do, do do, do do, do do

It don't matter what you do
Do, do do, do do, do do
It don't matter what you do
Do, do do, do do, do do you're kinda toxic
But it only makes me wanna love you
It don't matter what you
It don't matter what you do

You're kinda toxic
But it only makes me wanna love you
It don't matter what you do
Do, do do, do do, do do you're kinda toxic
But it only makes me wanna love you
It don't matter what you
It don't matter what you do

Just say you want me, don't let me go
(Just say)
