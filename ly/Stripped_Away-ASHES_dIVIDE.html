		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Motivate to forget so I can endure your words
Tell myself it's OK cause you say you're finding me pretty 
Enough

Stripped away
Something I'll never get back someday
I'm stuck in doubt, looking for the door that leads me out

I'm just a little child, stripped away
I'm just a little child, you stripped away.
Something I'll never get back someday.

Who're you, enrage, as I bleed and still you know I'm late
To feel obscene,
Love to find but from a past,
You've heard but never seen,
You're so scared that I...

Refuse to lay down tonight,
And tolerate your words...

Stand up for myself if I'm on your knees
You're finding me pretty enough...
I finally see the light tonight
Have I been pathetic enough?

You will feel its hurting tight tonight
And all from this little child

All from a little child, who's finally turned away
All from a little child, who's finally turned away

Drift away...
Come back some day...
