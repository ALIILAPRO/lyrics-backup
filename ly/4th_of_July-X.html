		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She's waitin' for me
When I get home from work
Oh, but things ain't just the same
She turns out the light
And cries in the dark
Won't answer when I call her name
 
On the stairs I smoke a
Cigarette alone
Mexican kids are shootin'
Fireworks below
Hey baby, it's the Fourth of July
Hey baby, it's the Fourth of July
 
She gives me her cheek
When I want her lips
But I don't have the strength to go
On the lost side of town
In a dark apartment
We gave up trying so long ago
 
On the stairs I smoke a
Cigarette alone
Mexican kids are shootin'
Fireworks below
Hey baby, it's the Fourth of July
Hey baby, it's the Fourth of July
 
What ever happened I
Apologize
So dry your tears and baby
Walk outside, it's the Fourth of July
 
On the stairs I smoke a
Cigarette alone
Mexican kids are shootin'
Fireworks below
Hey baby, it's the Fourth of July
Hey baby, Baby take a walk outside
