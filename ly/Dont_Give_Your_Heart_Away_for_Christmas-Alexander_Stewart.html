		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't give your heart away for Christmas
Save every dance for me, every sweet kiss
So save a mistletoe for you and me
I'm counting down the minutes 'til new year's eve
So don't give your heart away for Christmas

We'll light a fire and roast marshmallows and chestnuts
Me holding you will be my present
So please forgive me I know I am late
Will you promise me that you'll wait?
Don't give your heart away for Christmas 

Remember we went skating that winter night
I made a promise under crystalline moonlight
No matter what happens we'll be alright
Alright, alright
I need a promise from you to be strong for me
If I have faith I'll be everything you'll need
There's no one to doubt that who's gonna love you better than me baby
Let me be you man

Don't give your heart away for Christmas (Christmas)
Save every dance for me, every sweet kiss
So save a mistletoe for you and me
I'm counting down the minutes 'til new year's eve
Don't give your heart away for Christmas
Don't give your heart away for Christmas
