		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You’ve been hiding since the day I could feel,
You couldn't tell me if the bond was real
I can’t see
My heart had turned a brand new shade of teal,
Your outer being starts to peel,
Look at me,

Months flew by, 
Your voice sang me a wailing cry,
Who knows who’s worth the try?
Your voice still echoes in my room at night,
You're pleading to me what’s wrong and what’s right

But I found someone who taught me how to breathe,
She showed me how it felt to finally unclench my teeth,
Reality had drilled some disbelief,
She’s so real,
But I feel like I’m dreaming,
I feel like I’m dreaming
