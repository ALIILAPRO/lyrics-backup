		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  ""Hope is gone ashes in the wind All that was is buried in filth The shadows grow deeper with each passing hour The taste of life has turned too sour  I am but ghost in time Time unforgiving I am the failed design Without a meaning  Can't recall those days of old Some were stolen some were sold They won't ever come back Pages turned time after time Bridges burned and left behind But my sun still shines black  The rust is spreading eating the bones The spirit is lame The head explodes""
