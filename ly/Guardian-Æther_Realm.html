		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When the road is long
And the night has come
I will stay with you
We will see this through
When your flame burns low
That's a place I know
Place your hand in mine
We all need some help sometimes

I will be your guardian from loneliness
Feel my love surround you
Share your burden I will carry it
A refuge all around you
When sorrow overtakes you
You can call on me
Lay your troubles on me friend
I'll be with you til the end
I'll be your guardian

When your burden starts
Weighing on your heart
You are not alone
And you're stronger than you know

I will be your guardian from loneliness
Feel my love surround you
Share your burden I will carry it
A refuge all around you
When sorrow overtakes you
You can call on me
Lay your troubles on me friend
I'll be with you til the end
I'll be your guardian

(Solo - Burbage)

When the road is long
And the night has come

I will be your guardian from loneliness
Feel my love surround you
Share your burden I will carry it
A refuge all around you
When sorrow overtakes you
You can call on me
Lay your troubles on me friend
I'll be with you til the end
I'll be your guardian
