		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (We got London on da Track)

Can we calm down and make love?
Get it poppin' in the back of your Bentley truck
That vroom-vroom, that ooh-ooh, let's make up
Don't know why I can't let you go wit' no one
Nah, no one
'Cause I don't wanna fuss and fight (yeah)
Oh baby, I wanna go ride it all night (yeah)
Oh

You're dangerous
Perfect hips in every single pic, you got your angles up
I admit that I am not the best for you, no lie, I feel fake as fuck (yeah)
And you don't even smile no more, why you so serious?
And you don't even wanna come around no more
Can you just wait up?
I can make you feel like a star if I fuck you this a spaceship
That new-new double R truck so spacious (yeah)
And I know we stay up, but

Can we calm down and make love? (Make love)
Get it poppin' in the back of your Bentley truck ('ley truck)
That vroom-vroom, that ooh-ooh, let's make up
Don't know why I can't let you go wit' no one
Nah, no one
'Cause I don't wanna fuss and fight (yeah)
Oh baby, I wanna go ride it all night (yeah)
Oh

When I come over, ride me just like I'm a Maserati
Go fast or go slow
I think the feds is watching, they think I be catching bodies
And if they ask just say that I was a nice guy
Then I touch you, a muh'fuckin' thief in the nighttime
Make it scary like sci-fi
Got a .30 on me, ain't got time for a knife fight
Even when it's nighttime
My VVS is shimmery like a nightlight
And she wanna act shy (can we)
I could be your connection like the Wi-Fi (calm down)
You tryna get high? (And make love?)

Get it poppin' in the back of your Bentley truck
That vroom-vroom, that ooh-ooh, let's make up
Don't know why I can't let you go wit' no one
Yeah, no one
'Cause I don't wanna fuss and fight (yeah)
Oh baby, I wanna go ride it all night (yeah)
Oh
