		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I remember all my life
Raining down as cold as ice
Shadows of a man
A face through a window
Crying in the night
The night goes into

Morning, just another day
Happy people pass my way
Looking in their eyes
I see a memory
I never realized
How happy you made me 

Oh, Mandy
Well, you came and you gave without taking
But I sent you away 
Oh, Mandy
Well, you kissed me and stopped me from shaking
And I need you today
Oh, Mandy

I'm standing on the edge of time
I've walked away when love was mine
Caught up in a world of uphill climbing
The tears are in my mind
And nothing is rhyming

Oh, Mandy
Well, you came and you gave without taking
But I sent you away 
Oh, Mandy
Well, you kissed me and stopped me from shaking
And I need you today
Oh, Mandy

Yesterday's a dream
I face the morning
Crying on a breeze
The pain is calling

Oh, Mandy
Well, you came and you gave without taking
But I sent you away 
Oh, Mandy
Well, you kissed me and stopped me from shaking
And I need you today
Oh, Mandy

You came and you gave without taking
But I sent you away 
Oh, Mandy
You kissed me and stopped me from shaking
And I need you
