		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You got the looks, but you might be a sinner
I could tell, you're dressed all black with that glimmer
I'd show you off, and buy you fancy liquor
Can I prove myself? Cause I ain't no quitter
I ain't stupid, I know that you're not a social butterfly
But you got me hooked, looking super sexy, snorting all them lines
I'ma pop another addy, we can have some fun tonight
I'll just stay focused, right on you baby, you see it in my eyes
I'd never play you, throw the other bitches to the side
So romantic, maybe I could turn you to my bride
Could you tell that I'm into you? I'm coming for the ride
Kissing all on your face, and touching on your thighs
I'd never play you, play you, play you, play you
I'd never play you, play you, I'd never play you, play you
Hey I heard your stressed, it's okay just rest
You do your thing while I care for you, I'll always try my best
Just tell me all your needs, you could open up to me
Show me all your darkest secrets, I'll love you guaranteed
Let's go out and see the stars, you could show me all your scars
Just open up your arms, and I'll hold you there's no harm
I'll make you feel safe, we could go slow it's no race
Our past we can erase, only good things to replace
She says that she's emo, but she likes to suck my cock
Can you stop lying when you say, I'm the only one
You're not broken, you're not sad bitch, you're just a whore
Fuck you then I dip, fab gonna kick you out the door
I know that you like my hands on your slutty neck
You know what I do, kill you, then I go and spend a cheque
You a lame, you ain't on shit, get up out of my face
Don't talk to me unless you want to fucking fornicate
You got the looks, but you might be a sinner
I could tell, you're dressed all black with that glimmer
I'd show you off, and buy you fancy liquor
Can I prove myself? Cause I ain't no quitter
I ain't stupid, I know that you're not a social butterfly
But you got me hooked, looking super sexy, snorting all them lines
I'ma pop another addy, we can have some fun tonight
I'll just stay focused, right on you baby, you see it in my eyes
I'd never play you, throw the other bitches to the side
So romantic, maybe I could turn you to my bride
Could you tell that I'm into you? I'm coming for the ride
Kissing all on your face, and touching on your thighs
