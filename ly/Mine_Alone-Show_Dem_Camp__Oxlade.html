		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oxlade from Africa, ohh
Now rocking with the SDC 
Show Dem Camp, omo yes indeed

Omayima, baby, omayima carry load o, omayima
Na she be my kele, she no dey for everybody
Omayima, baby, omayima, mine alone o, omayinma
Oma ah ah omalicha

True say, a bad man was never too good at algebra 
But our first date just broke the X
When I took your number and we crack the formula
Are reasons why you should replace my ex
Now you got the boy tripping, retrace my steps
Quick SWOT analysis, let's weigh up strengths
Time to risk it all, girl, I'll place my bet 
'Cause you check every box just like my favorite creps
Let's see, you're soft spoken and your heart's golden
The way your ass poking, baby, Lord knows that 
I can slow stroke the weight off your shoulders
Love it when you super soak it, osmosis
I caught the bug and, no, it's not COVID
You're like a drug and I need more doses
Now catch yourself, let's play with your roses
Drown in the sea of love, our hearts woven, shout out to my

Omayima, baby, omayima carry load o, omayima
Na she be my kele, she no dey for everybody
Omayima, baby, omayima, mine alone o, omayinma
Oma ah ah omalicha

I need fire be lighter
Girl, I've been lonely, o tojo mÄ™ta
You be the reason for my laughter 
'Cause all the hustle and the pain make me wan kolomental
See, the feeling real I no fit forfeit am
Na you I dey talk about for my Twitter
I wanna be with you all day
Na you be go my shawty for days, oh no

Omayima, baby, omayima carry load o, omayima
Na she be my kele, she no dey for everybody
Omayima, baby, omayima, mine alone o, omayinma
Oma ah ah omalicha (listen)

I'm gonna start up by saying you look bad, you know
Lowkey, you're not even trying to brag, you know
Your beauty had Olodumare in his bag, you know
Way you're moving got a G running mad, you know
Let's take a palm wine trip, girl, the runway clear
If forever na the aim, it's a long way there
For my queen I go wan break bread
Let's get closer like Oxlade said
Walahi my vision, girl, e don dey clear
Build a future we can one day share 
That's real talk, pray in ten years time we're still soft
Came and you changed my life, I'm still shocked
Many pies throwing eyes at guys, I'm still yours so

Plenty boys want to ta si you
But na only me be the boy wey fancy you
Ohh, you're so classy too
And I want you to smile with your thirty-two
Omo, me I get money wey me want to dashy you
Girl, I swear I ain't got enough with your attitude
E gety reason I dey find you
E gety reason I dey want you, baby o

Omayima, baby, omayima carry load o, omayima
Na she be my kele, she no dey for everybody
Omayima, baby, omayima, mine alone o, omayinma
Oma ah ah omalicha
