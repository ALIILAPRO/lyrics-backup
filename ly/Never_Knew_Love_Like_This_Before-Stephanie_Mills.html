		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I never knew love like this before
Now I'm lonely never more
Since you came into my life

You are my love light, this I know
And I'll never let you go
You my all, you're part of me

Once I was lost and now I'm found
Then you turned my world around
When I need you, I call your name

?Cause I never knew love like this before
Opened my eyes
?Cause I never knew love like this before
What a surprise

?Cause I never knew love like this before

This feeling's so deep inside of me
Such a tender fantasy
You're the one I'm living for

You are my sunlight and my rain
And time could never change
What we share forever more, ooh...hoo...

I never knew love like this before
Now I'm lonely never more
Since you came into my life

?Cause I never knew love like this before
Opened my eyes
?Cause I never knew love like this before
What a surprise

?Cause I never knew love like this before

You are my lovelight, this I know
And I'll never let you go
You my all, you're part of me

Once I was lost and now I'm found
Then you turned my world around
When I need you, I call your name

?Cause I never knew love like this before
Opened my eyes
?Cause I never knew love like this before
What a surprise

?Cause I never knew love like this before
Inside of me
I never (Never) knew love like this before
Opened my eyes

Never (Never), never (Never)
Never knew love like this (I never knew, I never knew I never)
Never (Never), never (Never)
Never knew love like this (I never knew, I never knew I never knew)

Never (Never), never (Never)
Never knew love like this (I never knew)
Never (Never knew), never (Never)
Never knew love like this (I never knew)

Never (Never knew), never (Never)
Never knew love like this (I never knew, I never knew I never knew)
Never (I never knew, I never knew), never (I never)
Never knew love like this (Never knew)

Never (Never knew), never (Never)
Never knew love like this (Opened my eyes)
Never (What a surprise)
