		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Since I've gotten older
I've realized we all care about things
That don't really matter
We're just told it does
And now we're all trying
To keep our heads above the water
But what if we don't wanna?

If there's something you wanna do, just do it
Don't let your head stop your heart from moving
If there's someone you wanna talk to, talk to 'em
Who knows who we'd be if we just
Live more and love more
We all just need to live more and love more

When we're not here anymore
It all comes down
To who we were and what we stood for
Not what we had and not where we lived
So when we're told it does

Maybe then we'll see
We don't just have to keep our heads above the water
Not if we don't wanna

If there's something you wanna do, just do it
Don't let your head stop your heart from moving
If there's someone you wanna talk to, talk to 'em
Who knows who we'd be if we just
Live more and love more
We all just need to live more and love more

So hug your kids, tell them you love them
Have some heart but make sure it's open
Play by risk 'cause time gets stolen
Maybe speak less and listen more

'Cause life's too short
You only have one
It might sound cliche
But your life can start when you choose it to
When you choose it to

'Cause if there's something you wanna do, just do it
Don't let your head stop your heart from moving
If there's someone you wanna talk to, talk to 'em
Who knows who we'd be if we just
Live more and love more

Who knows who we'd be if we just
Live more and love more
Who knows who we'd be if we just
Live more and love more
Who knows who we'd be if we just
Live more and love more
