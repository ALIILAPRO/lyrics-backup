		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Writin' love letters on a folded napkin
Pickin' at the label on a beer
Choosin' which vise I'll try attacking
Showing you I'm different this year
I know I went and messed this up
And I wish the truth didn't sound like a bluff
Cause I've been drinkin' like a fish, smokin' like a train
The outside lookin' in looks the same
And I know you can't believe me cause it seems like nothing's changed
And I've been trying to fix me and losin' every time
But the point is baby you're the reason I tried
And the longer I go I love you more everyday
I know I'm different this time
But what do you do when the truth sounds like a lie
Yeah I can hear myself in every single word I'm saying
And I know you can't just forgive
I can't say that I'm sorry for all the men in your past
All I can say is I'm sorry for this
I always try to play it cool
But I'll only be a fool to you
Cause I've been drinkin' like a fish, smokin' like a train
The outside lookin' in looks the same
And I know you can't believe me cause it seems like nothing's changed
And I've been trying to fix me and losin' every time
But the point is baby you're the reason I tried
And the longer I go I love you more everyday
I know I'm different this time
But what do you do when the truth sounds like a lie
Yeah I've been drinkin' like a fish, smokin' like a train
The outside lookin' in looks the same
And I know you can't believe me cause it seems like nothing's changed
And I've been trying to fix me and losin' every time
But the point is baby you're the reason I tried
And the longer I go I love you more everyday
I know I'm different this time
Yeah I promise I'm different this time
I pray Lord every night
What do you do when the truth sounds like a lie
