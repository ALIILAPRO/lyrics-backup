		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She's got a way about her
I don't know what it is
But I know that I can't live without her
She's got a way of pleasin', mmh
I don't know what it is
But there doesn't have to be a reason
Anyway

She's got a smile that heals me, mmh
I don't know why it is
But I have to laugh when she reveals me
She's got a way of talkin', mmh
I don't know what it is
But it lifts me up when we are walkin'
Anywhere

She comes to me when I'm feelin' down
Inspires me without a sound
She touches me and I get turned around
She's got a way of showin', mmh
How I make her feel
And I find the strength to keep on goin'
She's got a light around her, ooh
And everywhere she goes
A million dreams of love surround her
Everywhere

She comes to me when I'm feelin' down
Inspires me without a sound
She touches me and I get turned around, ooh, oho
She's got a smile that heals me, mmh
I don't know why it is
But I have to laugh when she reveals me
She's got a way about her,mmh
I don't know what it is
But I know that I can't live without her
Anyway, hey
