		  Midnight shower
And I'm counting down the hours
Till I gotta get up for work
Cause I've got some big dreams
And plans left ahead of me
But first I gotta get off this dirt

The world is sleeping
and I'm right here keeping
On doing the things that I should
To make all those big dreams
A part of my reality
So I'll just keep pushing when it hurts

Over and over, and over again
We'll start it all over, with no means to an end

And now this water's raining down, and I'm trying hard to drown
Out this feeling, this feeling
And I'm staring at the ground as these doubts start to mount
But there's a feeling, and this feeling
I can't wash it out, no I can't just wash out

I should be sleeping
Cause I sure am needing
A nice night of seven or eight
Hours of shut eye
But my bed can't quite supply
The answers my mind needs of late

Over and over, and over again
We'll start it all over, with no means to end

And now this water's raining down, and I'm trying hard to drown
Out this feeling, this feeling
And I'm staring at the ground as these doubts start to mount
but there's a feeling, and this feeling
I can't wash it out, No I can't just wash it out

And I can't shake this
I was made for it
To give it my everything
And I can't break this
Or escape it
to be the better man
The one I know I can

Now this water's raining down, and I'm trying hard to drown
Out this feeling, and this feeling
And I'm staring at the ground as these doubts start to mount
but there's a feeling, and this feeling
I can't wash it out
No I can't just wash it out
No I can't just wash it out
