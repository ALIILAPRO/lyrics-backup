		  Alright, uh, let me tell this story
So I met this girl at a party
Really cute girl, uh
She had, she had, you know those clips from Walmart 
That you put in your hair? The colorful ones? 
Yeah, she had that, uh
Gorgeous make-up and pretty clothes
She was like an Insta-baddie, she was like one of those girls

Her name was Sarah
I was kinda shy, but she was a daredevil
And she liked to smoke
But she didn't like to drink 'cause she knew
That her parents would yell at her

Then she said, "Hey, Layla"
Yeah, what's up?
"You know, I really like hanging out with ya"
Aw, I like hanging out with you, too
"I think I really wanna kiss ya"
Wait, really?
"Yeah, but I don't wanna scare ya"
Oh, no, that's cool

And next thing I know, Sarah took me to the bathroom, ooh
And then I met Sarah in the bathroom, ooh

Now we're up against a wall and she's calling me "baby"
I said, "Are you sure? This is kinda crazy"
She says, "I just really wanna go
I don't wanna take it slow"

Sarah in the bathroom, ooh
And with a face like hers, I can't say no
I can't say no
