		  Hol' up!
(Hitmaka!)

Let's have sex, but not without the foreplay (okay, cool)
But not without the first date (okay, cool)
But not before I have to wonder if you let me hit if I walk you to your door way
Let's have sex, but not without the sprees babe (okay, cool)
Not without the vacays, no

Ohh, it's the way it goes
Now don't this feel right (don't this feel right)
I'm tryna put you in the light (tryna put you in the light)
Ooh, it's the way you go
Now don't say goodnight (don't say goodnight)
I'm tryna fuck you on top

Back in the days when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore
But these days I'm thinkin' maybe we should fuck again
I'm tryna meet you in Vegas and try my luck again
All your friends say you ain't really in love with him
Started off the Henn' and now I'm off the Patron
Had to switch it up, I had to hit your phone
Can you picture us posted on the wall?
Can you picture us posted on the wall?
I put her to sleep, she woke up like that
Breakfast in bed, I ordered her for a snack
Then get to the bag, talkin' a big payback
Roll my Wood' and give her good

Ohh, it's the way it goes
Now don't this feel right (don't this feel right)
I'm tryna put you in the light (tryna put you in the light)
Ooh, it's the way you go
Now don't say goodnight (don't say goodnight)
I'm tryna fuck you on top

Let's have sex, but not without the foreplay (ooh yeah, okay cool)
But not without the first date (ooh yeah, okay cool)
But not before I have to wonder if you let me hit if I walk you to your door way
Let's have sex, but not without the sprees babe (ooh yeah, okay cool)
Not without the vacays, no

Ohh, it's the way it goes
Now don't this feel right (don't this feel right)
I'm tryna put you in the light (tryna put you in the light)
Ooh, it's the way you go
Now don't say goodnight (don't say goodnight)
I'm tryna fuck you on top
