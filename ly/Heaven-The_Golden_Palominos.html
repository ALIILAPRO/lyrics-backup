		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ah, heaven here it is again

Here it is again, black on black
The tones the same though the names have changed 
It's the way it always is, blood in our veins,
The twisted ways we know how to love 
You can blame me if you want to 
I blame the sun going down
And the color of the air
And the sparks gone haywire

Ah, heaven here it is again

It feels good for a minute all that shoving and shoving
All that screaming and moaning but it all leads to nothing 
It feels good for a minute all the promises sighed
All that whispering and crying all that coming like dying 
You can blame me if you want to 
I blame the sun going down
And the color of the air
And the sparks gone haywire

Ah, heaven here it is again

It seems like eternity is shoved into this day
It rains and it rains, it's Grey and it's Grey
But you can blame me if you want to you can call me hysterical
Though it's the color of the air and it's the sun going down 
It all leads to nothing, it all leads to nothing,
It all leads to nothing, it all leads to nothing
I think if I let you it will be O-K 
But it's never O-K, no it's never O-K
You can blame me if you want to 
I blame the sun going down
And the color of the air
And the sparks gone haywire

Ah, heaven here it is again

It feels good for a minute all that shoving and shoving
All that screaming and moaning but it all leads to nothing 
It feels good for a minute all the promises sighed
All that whispering and crying all that coming like dying,
But it all leads to nothing, it all leads to nothing
And if this is heaven, then what's burning in hell,
And if this is heaven, then what's burning in hell?

Ah, heaven here it is again,
Here it is again
Here it is again
Here it is again
Here it is again
