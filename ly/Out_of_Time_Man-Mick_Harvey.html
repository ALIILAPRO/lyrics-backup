		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm walking out for love
I'm walking bad really down
Like a cool breeze
I'm gonna be late again
Driver wait for me please!
I'm running all in vain
Trying to catch this fucking train
"Time don't fool me no more"
And I throw my watch to the floor
(It's so lazy)
Time don't do it again
Now I'm stressed and strained
In the subway train
Now it s half past two
Long gone the rendez-vous
Now it's half past three
Time made a fool out of me
Now it s half past four
Baby can't you see
No use in waiting no more
It's timing tragedy
I think it s nine
When the clock says ten
This girl wouldn't wait
For the out of time
Out of time man
