		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, I'd rather fuck ya than kiss ya (kiss ya)
But I won't press the issue
You know what I need is (I need, I need)
And ya never gonna be it (be it)
I shoulda' hesitated
Limousine inebriated
So unsophisticated
Too late to be debated

[Chorus]
It's three a.m.
She won't put out
Lets go make out with her friends
Make out with her friends friends
It's three a.m.
She won't put out

Lets go make out with her friends
Make out with her friends

Oh, I want a lot of profanity
With a lot of lost virginity
It's a boy's intuition
With a right explanation
'Cause I'm on that mission
With deducted admission
Now take my clothes off
And show me what you're made of

[Chorus]

Make out with her friends

Excuse me, do you want to screw? 
Excuse me, do you want to screw?

I'm so amazing in the sack
Yes, I'm so amazing in the sack
 
I'd rather fuck you than kiss you

I want a lot of profanity
With a lot of lost virginity

Now take those clothes off
And show me what you're made of

It's three a.m. 
She won't put out

It's three a.m. 
She won't put out
Lets go make out with her friends
Make out with her friends' friends
Make out with her friends, make out with her friends' friends
Make out with her friends, make out with her friends' friends
Make out with her friends, make out with her friends' friends
Make out with her friends, make out with her friends' friends
Make out with her friends, make out with her friends' friends
Make out with her friends, make out with her friends' friends
Make out with her friends, make out with her friends' friends
Make out with her friends, make out with her friends' friends
