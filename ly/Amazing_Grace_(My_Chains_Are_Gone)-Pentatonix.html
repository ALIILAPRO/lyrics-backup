		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Amazing grace
How sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
And I once was lost, but now I'm found
Was blind, but now I see

'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved (ooh)
How precious did that grace appear (ooh)
The hour I first believed

My chains are gone (ooh, ooh, ooh)
I've been set free (ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
My God, my Savior has ransomed me (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
And like a flood His mercy rains 
Unending love, amazing grace (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

The Lord has promised good to me (oh, oh, oh)
His word my hope secures 
He will my shield and portion be
As long as life endures (oh, oh, oh)

My chains are gone (oh, oh, oh)
I've been set free 
My God, my Savior has ransomed me 
And like a flood His mercy rains 
Unending love, oh amazing grace (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

The Earth shall soon dissolve like snow
The sun forbear to shine
But God, who called me here below (oh)
Will be forever mine

My chains are gone
I've been set free
My God, my Savior has ransomed me (oh)
And like a flood His mercy rains
Unending love, amazing grace (ooh, ooh, ooh)

I once was lost, but now I'm found
Was blind, but now I see
