		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Brace yourself
You feel nothing
But you see
Your limbs are black and frozen

A swell of ice
Descends from the North, caps the land
Old thoughts under the surface

Lift me up
Into the stratosphere
It's cold
And breathing becomes a challenge

I'm floating high
Bird's eye perspective
Sets you free
Now let me take my distance

We are alone
So save your sentimental considerations
For the moment when it hits
No hideout, no safe retreat

We are alone
So save your sentimental considerations
For the moment when it hits
No hideout, no safe retreat

You feel so disconnected
And yes, I get it
But there is just no point in further confrontation
Dysfunctional communication skills

You undermine our mutual
Resolution strategy
With your condescending patronising
Habitus of false modesty

Lift me up
Into the stratosphere
It's cold
And breathing becomes a challenge

I'm floating high
Bird's eye perspective
Sets you free
Now let me take my distance
