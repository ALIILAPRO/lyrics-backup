Oh, you want it like that?
Sugar sweet like a cute kitty cat
One more move and I'd snatch it right back
Is it me, or do you like it like that?
Like it what I mean when I switch up my hair
You can have a taste, but don't get too attached
One way ticket, baby, don't look back
All eyes on me, did you feel the impact?

I just can't seem to make up my mind
But I'm ready to give you what you like
Take the poison, I'll be sour tonight
Alright, alright

Take a bite, take a bite, s-sour candy
Take a bite, take a bite, s-sour candy
Take a bite, take a bite, s-sour candy
Take a bite, take a bite, sour candy

Taste
Taste
S-sour candy

I'm sour candy, so sweet, then I get a little angry, yeah
Sour candy, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm super psycho, make you crazy when I turn the lights low
Sour candy, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Take a bite, take a bite, s-sour candy
Take a bite, take a bite, s-sour candy
Take a bite, take a bite, s-sour candy
Take a bite, take a bite, sour candy

I'm hard on the outside
But if you give me time
I could make time for your love
Time for your love
I'm hard on the outside
But if you give me time
Then I could make time for your love (oh-oh-oh)

Yeah, I can be sweet, but I'm sour for you
Taste the poison, make your dreams come true
It's not right to like, but you know you do

I just can't seem to make up my mind
But I'm ready to give you what you like
Take the poison, I'll be sour tonight
Alright, alright

Take a bite, take a bite, s-sour candy
Take a bite, take a bite, s-sour candy
Take a bite, take a bite, s-sour candy
Take a bite, take a bite, sour candy

I'm sour candy, so sweet, then I get a little angry, yeah
Sour candy, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm super psycho, make you crazy when I turn the lights low
Sour candy, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Take a bite, take a bite, s-sour candy
Take a bite, take a bite, s-sour candy
Take a bite, take a bite, s-sour candy
Take a bite, take a bite, sour candy

(Shy)
