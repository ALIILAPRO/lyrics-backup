		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mama's got a new man
And daddy's got a new mansion to keep
He never really calls back
'Cause he's got too many finances to reap

Money, money
Ain't it funny, honey
When you get what you need
Baby, life is a breeze
Money, money
Give me money, money
'Til I'm bloody, bloody

All these kids have got affluenza
Going wrecking their daddy's Benza
Crystal liquor cups and designer drugs, oh oh
They say money can't buy you no love
But a diamond cheers you right up
Give me none of your affluenza, affluenza, affluenza

Every day's your birthday
You threw a party but you kinda
Hate all your friends
So you're crying in a drive-way
Killing time, getting high
Can't wait 'til it ends

Money, money
Ain't it funny, honey
When you get what you need
Baby, life is a breeze
Money, money
Give me money, money
'Til I'm bloody, bloody

All these kids have got affluenza
Going wrecking their daddy's Benza
Crystal liquor cups and designer drugs, oh oh
They say money can't buy you no love
But a diamond cheers you right up
Give me none of your affluenza, affluenza, affluenza

Fat stacks, cold cash
You've always had it real lavish, first-class
Trust fund, gold tongue
Eighty grand in both your hands, but no love

All these kids have got affluenza
Going wrecking their daddy's Benza
Crystal liquor cups and designer drugs, oh oh
They say money can't buy you no love
But a diamond cheers you right up
Give me none of your affluenza, affluenza, affluenza
