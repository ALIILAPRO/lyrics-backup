		<p>
		  Hey, yeah, I wanna shoop, baby

Ooh, how you doin', baby?
No, not you
You, the bow-legged one, yeah
What's your name?
Damn, that sounds sexy, uh

Here I go, here I go, here I go again (again?)
Girls, what's my weakness? (Men!)
Okay then, chillin', chillin'
Mindin' my business (word)
Yo, Salt, I looked around, and I couldn't believe this
I swear, I stared, my niece my witness
The brother had it goin' on with somethin' kinda, uh
Wicked, wicked (ooh) had to kick it
I'm not shy, so I asked for the digits
A ho? No, that don't make me
See what I want slip slide to it swifty
Felt it in my hips so I dipped back to my bag of tricks
Then I flipped for a tip, make me wanna do tricks for him
Lick him like a lollipop should be licked
Came to my senses and I chilled for a bit
Don't know how you do the voodoo that you do
So well, it's a spell, hell, makes me wanna shoop, shoop, shoop

Shoop, shoop ba-doop, shoop ba-doop
Shoop ba-doop, ba-doop, ba-doop 
Shoop ba-doop, shoop ba-doop 
Shoop ba-doop, ba-doop, ba-doop

Umm, you're packed and you're stacked 'specially in the back
Brother, wanna thank your mother for a butt like that (thanks, Mom)
Can I get some fries with that shake-shake boobie?
If looks could kill you would be an uzi
Or a shotgun, bang! What's up with that thang?
I wanna know how does it hang?
Straight up, wait up, hold up, Mr. Lover
Like Prince said you're a sexy motha well-a
I like 'em real wild, b-boy style by the mile
Smooth black skin with a smile
Bright as the sun, I wanna have some fun
Come and give me some of that yum-yum
Chocolate chip, honey dip, can I get a scoop?
Baby, take a ride in my coupe, you make me wanna

Shoop, shoop ba-doop, shoop ba-doop (baby, hey)
Shoop ba-doop, ba-doop, ba-doop
Shoop ba-doop, shoop ba-doop 
(Don't you know I wanna shoop, baby)
Shoop ba-doop, ba-doop, ba-doop
Shoop, shoop ba-doop, shoop ba-doop
Shoop ba-doop, ba-doop, ba-doop 
Shoop ba-doop, shoop ba-doop 
Shoop ba-doop, ba-doop, ba-doop

Well, let me bring you back to the subject
Pep's on the set
Make you get hot, make you work up a sweat
When you skip-to-my-lou, my darling
Not falling in love but I'm falling for your (super sperm)
When I get ya betcha bottom dollar you were best under pressure
(Yo, Sandy, I wanna like, taste you)
Getcha, getcha lips wet, 'cause it's time to have Pep

On your mark, get set, go, let me go, let me shoop
To the next man in the three-piece suit
I spend all my dough-re-mi cutie
Shoop, shoop a-doobie, like Scoobie Doobie Doo
I love you in your big jeans, you give me nice dreams
You make me wanna scream, ooh, ooh, ooh
I like what ya do, when you do
What ya do, you make me wanna shoop

Shoop, shoop ba-doop, shoop ba-doop
Shoop ba-doop, ba-doop, ba-doop 
Shoop ba-doop, shoop ba-doop 
Shoop ba-doop, ba-doop, ba-doop

Oh, my goodness, girl, look at him
He is the cutest brother in here
And he's comin' this way! Ooh!

S and the P wanna kick with me, cool (uh-huh)
But I'm wicked, G, (yeah) hit skins but never quickly (that's right)
I hit the skins for the hell of it, just for the yell I get
Mm-mm-mm, for the smell of it (smell it)
They want my bod, here's the hot rod (hot rod)
Twelve inches to a yard (damn) and have ya soundin' like a retard (yeah)
Big 'Twan Love-Her, six-two, wanna hit you
So what you wanna do? What you wanna do? Mm, I wanna shoop

Shoop, shoop ba-doop, shoop ba-doop
Shoop ba-doop, ba-doop, ba-doop
Shoop ba-doop, shoop ba-doop
Shoop ba-doop, ba-doop, ba-doop
Shoop, shoop ba-doop, shoop ba-doop (oh, you make me wanna)
Shoop ba-doop, ba-doop, ba-doop 
Shoop ba-doop, shoop ba-doop (hey, yeah, I wanna shoop baby)
Shoop ba-doop, ba-doop, ba-doop
Shoop, shoop ba-doop, shoop ba-doop (oh, you make me wanna)
Shoop ba-doop, ba-doop, ba-doop 
Shoop ba-doop, shoop ba-doop (hey, yeah, I wanna shoop baby)
Shoop ba-doop, ba-doop, ba-doop 
Shoop, shoop ba-doop, shoop ba-doop (oh, you make me wanna)
Shoop ba-doop, ba-doop, ba-doop 
Shoop ba-doop, shoop ba-doop 
Shoop ba-doop, ba-doop, ba-doop
