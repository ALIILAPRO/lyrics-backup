		  Yeah, what?
Jacquees (Rich Gang, mhm), uh-huh (XL Eagle baby)

You can find me somewhere in the spot on a mission (a mission, mission)
You can find me in the spot lookin' for me a missus (a missus, missus)
Got my eyes locked on this brown-tone, sexy, well-known woman (Rich girl), woman
She got a vibe and I can't miss it (miss it)
I wanna put it down on this mission (this mission)
I wonder, will she go there with me? (With me)
I'm MJ with my shot, twenty-three (twenty-three)
She a boss, she got drive, niggas fail, but they tried
Nobody's hittin' it (nobody's hittin' it)

You say you need someone real
I got somethin' (I got somethin')
You been stressin' 'bout your bills, that ain't 'bout nothin' (ain't 'bout nothin')
I know I could be your light
I wanna shine with you (shine with you)
I'll flood your follie on your wrist
Won't waste my time with you (my time with you)

Girl, all you need is me
Girl, I just wanna lift your spirits (yeah)
For anyone that ever hurt your feelings
Girl, all you need is me (right)
Be my partner in this life of sinnin' (for sure)
My love for life, girl, like I caught a sentence

I can see your dress flowin' down the runway (uh, uh-huh)
'Cause I'ma put a ring on it one day
Ooh, she drippin' wet now (drippin')
She got my respect now
We came from the bottom and she stayed down
I know that she worth it
She shaped like a bottle, it's no servin'
She don't cut no corners, she's so perfect
Lookin' like she straight off the runway
She get my braggin' rights, her little ass is nice
I'ma be in my bag tonight, she wanna dance tonight
We lit like dynamite, I wanna make you my wife
Put this pipe in your life, she'll be goin' all night
She like it inside, yeah (inside)
She told me keep it inside (inside)

Girl, all you need is me
Girl, I just wanna lift your spirits (yeah)
For anyone that ever hurt your feelings
Girl, all you need is me (right)
Be my partner in this life of sinnin' (for sure)
My love for life, girl, like I caught a sentence (yeah, yeah)

Can I get in your business, girl?
Who's been takin' care of you? (Who's been takin' care of you?)
Or are you independent, boo? (Or are you independent, boo?)
If so, then tell me what you do (what you do)
I can take care of you, girl, don't you fight it (don't you fight it)
I got sexual needs, girl, come and ride it (come and ride it)
Ice cube your neck, girl, fuck a Friday (yeah)
That's bible, like Usher, let's do it my way
I wonder, will she go there with me? (With me)
I'm MJ with my shot, twenty-three (twenty-three)
I know she'd be perfect for me (for me)
Sweet lil' lady is makin' me sing (yeah)
But she's not happy, I can tell (I can tell)
Someone is not treatin' her well, I need you all to myself

You say you need someone real
I got somethin' (I got somethin')
You been stressin' 'bout your bills
That ain't 'bout nothin'
I know I could be your light
I wanna shine with you
I'll flood your follie on your wrist
Won't waste my time with you (won't waste my time)

Girl, all you need is me
Girl, I just wanna lift your spirits (yeah, yeah)
For anyone that ever hurt your feelings
Girl, all you need is me (yeah)
You my partner in this life of sinnin' (my life)
My love for life, girl, like I caught a sentence
You're all I need
Girl, I just wanna lift your spirits (ohh)
For anyone that ever hurt your feelings
You're all I need, yeah
Be my partner in this life of sinnin'
My love for life, girl, like I caught a sentence

Na-na-na, na-na (ooh, yeah)
Na-na-na, na-na (ooh, yeah, Rich Gang)
Na-na-na, na-na (ooh, babe)
Na-na-na, na-na (and ya know, and ya know)
Rich Gang
