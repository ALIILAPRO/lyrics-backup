		<p>
		  Woo-ooh, woo-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Woo-ooh, woo-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

I let go
Every time I hear those
Voices in my head, my head
I run home
Every time I get those
Voices in my head, my head

Don't let me down
Don't say you miss me now
'Cause I've been tryna figure out
Why you still in my mind
I been drivin' 'round
This good for nothin' town
It helps me not to think about
Oh, where you sleep at night

Now I'm layin' in bed here without you
And I can't stop dreamin' about you
Wanna close my eyes and watch us drift away (oh, yeah)

I let go
Every time I hear those
Voices in my head, my head
I run home
Every time I get those
Voices in my head, my head

Woo-ooh, woo-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Woo-ooh, woo-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

I try to hide
The pain you put me through
I tell myself it's fine
Another one night stand will do
I'm turnin' off the light so it's dark inside my room
And then I close my eyes, pretendin' that it's you
I wish my memory was deleted
My heart's in a hundred pieces
In my head I hear you screamin'
It wakes me while I'm sleepin'

Now I'm layin' in bed and I'm without you
And I can't stop dreamin' about you
Wanna close my eyes and watch us drift away (oh, yeah)

I let go
Every time I hear those (hear those voices)
Voices in my head, my head (oh)
I run home (I run home)
Every time I get those (I get those)
Voices in my head, my head (my head, in my head)

Woo-ooh, woo-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
(Voices in my head)
Woo-ooh, woo-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

Woo-ooh, woo-ooh, ooh, ooh
Woo-ooh, woo-ooh, ooh, ooh
Woo-ooh, woo-ooh, ooh, ooh
Woo-ooh, woo-ooh, ooh, ooh
