		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't even moonwalk
I don't believe in moving backwards
If you knew just where I came from
You would understand me better, why I never

Take shit for granted 'cause
I ain't always had it
From my shoes to my tattoos
Tryna make this habit, ah
Them who think that they are stoppin' me
They don't know I got a hundred ways

Hunnid ways to get it everyday
Only catch me resting in my grave
I'm too busy counting numbers
If I lose it, watch me do it, bet I come up with
Another hundred ways

Hunnid, hunnid, hunnid, hunnid
Hunnid, hunnid, hunnid, hunnid ways
Hunnid, hunnid, hunnid
If I lose it, watch me do it, bet I come up with
Another hundred ways

I'm just tryna stay way up (way up)
Gettin' my convos in with Jes√∫s (Jesus)
By the way he says, "What's up" (what's up)
And he told me he forgives you

Don't take shit for granted 'cause
I ain't always had it
From my shoes to my tattoos
Tryna make this habit, ah
Them who think that they are stoppin' me
They don't know I got a hundred ways

Hunnid ways to get it everyday
Only catch me resting in my grave
I'm too busy counting numbers
If I lose it, watch me do it, bet I come up with
Another hundred ways

Hunnid, hunnid, hunnid, hunnid (ways)
Hunnid, hunnid, hunnid, hunnid ways
Hunnid, hunnid, hunnid
If I lose it, watch me do it, bet I come up with
Another hundred ways

Always got a hundred ways, yeah
Never see me run away, no
Chopper, extra clip extendo
I do it on my own (ways)

Hunnid ways to get it everyday
Only catch me resting in my grave
I'm too busy counting numbers
If I lose it, watch me do it, bet I come up with
Another hundred ways

Hunnid, hunnid, hunnid (hunnid ways)
Hunnid, hunnid, hunnid, hunnid ways
Hunnid, hunnid, hunnid
If I lose it, watch me do it, bet I come up with
Another hundred ways
