		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's gonna be the right time
It's gonna be the right one

If only I could silence all this noise
The chaos in my heart
It's killing me to be all alone
Wanna tear down my defenses
Wanna quiver at your touch

Take a ride
You don't even have to mean it
And if you wanna stay the night
I promise I'll keep it secret
Stay awhile
Baby, you won't regret it
Just let it out
Love is a way to say it

(Could it be the right time?)
(Could he be the right one?)

I linger in the shadows of my doubt
I've waited here so long
It's killing me to be all alone
I better take down my defenses
Or the moment will be lost

Take a ride
You don't even have to mean it
And if you wanna stay the night
I promise I'll keep it secret
Stay awhile
Baby, you won't regret it
Just let it out
Love is a way to say it

(There's a way, way, way)

Take a ride
You don't even have to mean it
And if you wanna stay the night
I promise I'll keep it secret
Stay awhile
Baby, you won't regret it
Just let it out
Love is a way to say it
