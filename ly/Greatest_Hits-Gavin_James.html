		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do you remember all those wild nights?
'Cause I've been flicking through the highlights
To when you said you love me for the first time
And I just couldn't get my words right

Why do all of the good memories hurt the most?
All I see is your face when my eyes are closed
You're like all of the good songs I can't forget
Always stuck in my head

Now I'm on my own
I just dance alone to our greatest hits
Now you've got someone
I can't fool myself that we still exist
You meant more to me than anyone
I guess I never was your number one
Now I'm on my own
I just dance alone to our greatest hits
(Our greatest hits)

I don't remember how it all went wrong
Maybe if I could I would be moving on
'Cause I still play the records that we used to play
I still sing along but they don't sound the same

Why do all of the good memories feel so bad?
Just a beautiful dream is all I really had
You're like all of the good songs I can't forget
Always stuck in my head

Now I'm on my own
I just dance alone to our greatest hits
Now you've got someone
I can't fool myself that we still exist
You meant more to me than anyone
I guess I never was your number one
Now I'm on my own
I just dance alone to our greatest hits
(Our greatest hits)

Oh whoa oh oh
Our greatest hits
Oh whoa oh oh

Now I'm on my own
I just dance alone to our greatest hits
Now you've got someone
I can't fool myself that we still exist
You meant more to me than anyone
I guess I never was your number one
Now I'm on my own
I just dance alone to our greatest hits

Wherever you are
(Do you remember all those wild nights?)
Wherever you are
('Cause I've been flicking through the highlights)
I hope that you're dancing too (to when you said)
(You love me for the first time)
I hope that you're dancing too
Our greatest hits
