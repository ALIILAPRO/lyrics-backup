		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm living life on a fault line
While you deconstruct my grief
And I think over and over
Why was it him instead of me
Now I have everything to lose
Or is it everything to prove
You won't be happy either way
Cause I was born to lose


I'm born to lose
My gloom's a shadow over you
You don't see I see it too?
Yeah you know I'm born to lose


You can pull apart my words
And question everything I say
It doesn't change the fact that I
Miss my friend more every day
Now I have everything to lose
Or is it everything to prove
You won't be happy either way
Cause I was born to lose


Come now deconstruct my grief
Yeah you can tell me what to think
Come now deconstruct my grief
Don't fucking tell me what to think
Cause I'm born to lose


You are here to salt the earth
You will get what you deserve


I'm born to lose
My gloom's a shadow over you
You don't see I see it too?
Yeah you know I'm born to lose
