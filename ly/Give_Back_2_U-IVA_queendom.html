		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know where your silence comes from
The shame and guilty conscience
I know you're not dead or numb
But are you hurting from our nonsense?

If I could bring you back
I guess, I'd wish the person you'd become
Learning every lesson from our break
A rewarding mistake

So could you forgive me
Know what you give me
Would give back to you
My dear dear friend

So could you forgive me
Know what you give me
Would give back to you
My dear dear friend

Uhhhhh
I could give back to you
Give back to you
Uhhhhh
I could give back to you
Give back to you

I'm sorry if I held your feelings against you
I know it wouldn't bring you back
My friends keep on telling me to move on
But they don't know you like that
If you make your peace someday
You'll find me in that space
Learning every lesson from our break
A rewarding mistake


So could you forgive me
Know what you give me
Would give back to you
my dear dear friend

So could you forgive me
Know what you give me
Would give back to you
my dear dear friend

Uhhhhh
I could give back to you
Give back to you
Uhhhhh
I could give back to you
Give back to you

Oh, sometimes
I think of you
Are you alone?
What you going through?
I know, I'm sentimental

So could you forgive me
Know what you give me
Would give back to you
My dear dear friend

Could you forgive me
Know what you give me
Would give back to you
My dear dear friend

Uhhhhh
I could give back to you
Give back to you
Uhhhhh
I could give back to you
Give back to you
