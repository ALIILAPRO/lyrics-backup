		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Go

We bleed like an open wound
The stitches are of no use
Nothing will satisfy
We're suffering the classic symptoms of a broken spirit
You wanna push us to the fucking limit?
This is how we keep a tiger tame

Nothing worth fighting for?
Just step outside your door
They all say revelation's on its way
So be very afraid
Revelation's on its way

Waiting for the world to burn
Living but we never learn
Sorry, it don't look good
We're suffering the classic symptoms of a broken spirit
You wanna push us to the fucking limit?
This is how we keep a tiger tame

Nothing worth fighting for?
Just step outside your door
They all say revelation's on its way

If Armageddon can't eclipse our pain
Every action left will be in vain
It's like boiling the ocean
Nothing left to do but to bottle the emotion

'Cause we're all players and the world's a stage
We'll give a fuck so long as we get paid
It's like boiling the ocean
Nothing left to do but to bottle the emotion

Be very afraid
It's like boiling the ocean
Everything we love lays resting on a broken spirit
You wanna push us to the fucking limit?
These are the symptoms of a broken spirit
You wanna push us to the fucking limit?
The classic symptoms of a broken spirit

You wanna push us to the fucking limit?
This is how we keep a tiger tame
Nothing worth fighting for?
Just step outside your door
They all say revelation's on its way

They all say revelation's on its way
Be very afraid
Let's all be very afraid
'Cause they all say revelation's on its way
