		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can feel you light me up in the darkness
I can hear you breathing silently next to me
It's like you take away my past, all my problems
Yeah, I got none

'Cause I got you (ooh)
Like the ocean got the moon, yeah, I got you (ooh)
They say nothing last forever but it's cool (ooh)
Yeah, as long as I got air to breathe
Swear I don't need anything, 'cause

I got, I got you (yeah, yeah)
Like the ocean got the moon, yeah, I got you (yeah, yeah)
They say nothing last forever but it's cool (yeah, yeah)
Yeah, as long as I've got air to breathe
Swear I don't need anything, 'cause

I got, I got you
I got you
I got, I got you (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I got you (yeah, yeah)

Floating high, no gravity, it's like we're weightless
Close my eyes and slip away, you're like my therapy
Ain't no sense in time 'cause I'm stuck in this moment
Every moment

'Cause I got you (ooh)
Like the ocean got the moon, yeah, I got you (ooh)
They say nothing last forever but it's cool (ooh)
Yeah, as long as I got air to breathe
Swear I don't need anything, 'cause

I got, I got you
I got you
I got, I got you (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I got you (yeah, yeah)

I got, I got you (ooh)
Like the ocean got the moon, yeah, I got you (ooh)
They say nothing last forever but it's cool (ooh)
Yeah, as long as I got air to breathe
Swear I don't need anything, 'cause
I got, I got you

I got you
If you got me, I got you
I got you
If you got me, I got you
I got you
If you got me, I got you
I got you

I got, I got you (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I got you (yeah, yeah)
I got, I got you (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I got you (yeah)
I got, I got you

I got, I got you (ooh)
Like the ocean got the moon, yeah, I got you (ooh)
They say nothing last forever but it's cool (ooh)
Yeah, as long as I got air to breathe
Swear I don't need anything, 'cause
I got, I got you (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I got you (yeah, yeah)
I got, I got you
