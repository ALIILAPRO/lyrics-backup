		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I miss you so much, I can't stand it
Seems like my heart is breaking in two
My head says no but my soul demands it
Everything I do reminds me of you

I miss you so much in this house full of shadows
While the rain keeps pouring down my window too
When will the pain recede to the darkness?
From whence it has come, and I'm feeling so blue

Ain't goin' down no more to the well
Sometimes it feels like I'm going to hell
Sometimes I'm knockin' on your front door
But I don't have nothing to sell no more

Seems like the spirit is pushing me onwards
I'm able to see where I tripped and went wrong
I'll just have to guess where my soul will find comfort
And I miss you so much when I'm singing my song

Ain't goin' down no more to the well 
It's that sometimes it seems I'm going to hell
You'll find me knocking on your front door
But I don't have nothing to sell no more

Seems like my spirit is pushing me onwards
Though I'm able to see where I tripped when I went wrong
I'll just have to guess where my soul will get comfort
I miss you so much when I'm singing my song

I miss you so much I can't stand it
Seems like my heart is breaking in two
My head says go, but my soul demands it
And everything I do reminds me of you
Everything I do reminds me of you
Everything I do reminds me of you
