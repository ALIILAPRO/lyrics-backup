		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, jumped in my bag, let's go
I got a stick in the passenger in my car
She ride on the dick with no handlebars
Came a long way from poppin' them Xanax bars
I was going hard, but I'm going harder
I went far, but I'm going farther
I turned up to superstardom
Yeah, if I hold that bitch up, I won't drop her
I like to pour up, I watch the codeine fall from all this syrup dropping
I don't go to the mall, I got associated everywhere I'm shopping
Yeah, I'm a look killer, I'm watchin' the bodies fall from the swag I'm dropping

Baby, I'm a trending topic
If you the shit, then pop it, yeah
Neck on wave tropics
Boy, you don't get paid, stop it
Shawty come through and clean, yeah, yeah, she mopped it
I had to go get paid, yeah, I ain't even had no option
These niggas wanna steal my moves, tell him watch this
I'm walking off with your boo, young nigga, watch this

My life is a movie, and they watching
I'm comin' through with that shit on rude
Baby, I'm showstoppin', all my money so God damn blue
It change her mood, I take a flight, I switch my mood up
I've been focusing on what I'm doing, I don't even know what these niggas doing
My diamonds look like Sprite, I'm sipping on codeine, and that's all I'm doing
I've been ballin' so hard, I need some kicks, yeah, call me Lonely Ewing

Yeah, with the fashion, I'm so fluent
With this money, I'm so fluent
Her pussy so wet, I'm in all fluids
And they don't wanna do it till I do it
If I'm outside and see an opp, I'll shoot him
And every single one of my thots flies too
Every single one of my flights first class
I came through, and I got a bag
Check on my drip, European swag
Check out my fit, it cost a paper tag

On a brought a brand new whip (Yeah)
I got a brand new whip, it's fast
And I'm driving to your bitch (Yeah)
I'm finna pick her up right now, she can suck my dick
After this, baby, I got to go
'Cause I got money to get
I got shows to do, I'm on the road again and again
And my real life's so turnt, baby, I don't post no pics
I ain't even got to say much, I'm just holding my wrist
I ain't even tryna flirt, baby, I just look like this
I ain't even tryna change your mind
Just tryna change your life, that's it
I'm the young nigga that gets more checks than every Nike kick, yeah
I paved the way, I changed the game for these niggas, that's all I did

Yeah, jumped in my bag, let's go
I got a stick in the passenger in my car
She ride on the dick with no handlebars
Came a long way from poppin' them Xanax bars
I was going hard, but I'm going harder
I went far, but I'm going farther
I turned up to superstardom
Yeah, if I hold that bitch up, I won't drop her
I like to pour up, I watch the codeine fall from all this syrup dropping
I don't go to the mall, I got associated everywhere I'm shopping
Yeah, I'm a look killer, I'm watchin' the bodies fall from the swag I'm dropping
