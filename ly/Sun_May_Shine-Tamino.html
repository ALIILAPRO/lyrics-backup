		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Early spring arrived
Somber, light grey sky
Sun may shine, sun may shine
Just right now it won't rise
In your sullen gaze
I see no care for this place

And still somehow
You may find your heart here
Right here

Soon our love will flow over the gloom
Yeah, it's getting closer to you
Over your shoulder, yeah
Soon our love will flow over the gloom

Troubled by a sound
Vile and yet devout
In your eyes, in your eyes
There lies no caress
They could not shine less

Soon our love will flow over the gloom
Yeah, it's getting closer to you
Over your shoulder, yeah
Soon our love will flow over the gloom
Yeah, it's getting closer to you
Over your shoulder, yeah
Soon our love will flow over the gloom
Our love will flow over
Our love will flow over the gloom
Our love will flow over the gloom
