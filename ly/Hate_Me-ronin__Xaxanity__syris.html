		<p>
		  [Xaxanity]
I've been going crazy
Baby will you save me
I'm sorry that I did that
I don't want you to hate me
Hate me
Crying in the back of the club
Fucking myself up
The devil got a hold of me I think of giving up
Tick tock on the clock baby I don't wanna stop
Tick tock on the clock baby I don't wanna stop

[Syris]
Stupid slut on my cock and she really wanna fuck
All these hoes wanna talk, I can't ever get enough
And you said you love me once
Posted with a gun
Dirty drugs pour it up got me leanin' off the mud
Off the mud

[Xaxanity]
I been off the drugs
I can't get enough
Ya u said u luv me once
But bitch I'm calling bluff
Ooohhh
No-one knows me
No-one knows me ~


[Ronin]
You and your nose ring
I see it all in my drеams
I’ll give u anything
Only if u show me
Baby show me
Baby fuckin show mе
All up in my nose
I think I got a nosebleed
They all hate me
But at least they all know me
Thought I was coked up
The way she wanna blow me
Plug me in baby
Like a fuckin' Sony
Chop me up
Blood all on my Abercrombie

[Xaxanity]
I been going crazy
Baby will you save me
Sorry that I did that
I don't want you to hate me
Hate me
Crying in the back of the club
Fucking myself up
The devil got a hold of me I think of giving up
Tick tock on the clock baby I don't wanna stop
Tick tock on the clock baby I don't wanna stop

[Syris]
Stupid slut on my cock and she really wanna fuck
All these hoes wanna talk, I can't ever get enough
