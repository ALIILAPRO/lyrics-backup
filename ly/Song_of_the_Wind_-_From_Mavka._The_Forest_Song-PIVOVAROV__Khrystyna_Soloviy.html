		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wonder!
I pray! The Star you trace
Here is our Land
Only tightly hold my hand
 
Ask me n' I'll tell
(how) in love I fell
Flying, flying
Keep flying with me
 
My world  your world
No we do not need no words
Two hearts but one history 
Always beat in harmony
 
My world  your world
Flash of everlasting love
Two hearts but one history
Always beat in harmony

Talking, talking, talking to the wind
Talking, talking, talking to the wind
Talking, talking, talking to the wind 
 
Learn the language
Of wind and rain
Listen! Listen!
To know me well
 
Cherish your will
Your song, your magic skill
Keep flying with me
 
Refrain
My world  your world
No we do not need no words
Two hearts but one history
Always beat in harmony
 
My world  your world
Flash of everlasting love
Two hearts but one history 
Always beat in harmony

Talking, talking, talking to the wind
Talking, talking, talking to the wind
Talking, talking, talking to the wind
