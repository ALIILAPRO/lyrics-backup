		  Listen up
What's the time said today
I'm gonna speak my mind
Take me up to the top of the world
I want to see my crime

Day by day
There's a man in a suit
Who's gonna make you pay
For the thoughts that you think
And the words they won't let you say

One fine day
Gonna leave you all behind
It wouldn't be so bad
If I had more time

Sailing down a river alone
I've been tryin' to find my way back home
But I don't believe in magic
Life is automatic
But I don't mind being on my own
No I don't mind being on my own

Listen up
What's the time said today
I'm gonna speak my mind
Take me up to the top of the world
I want to see my crime

Day by day
There's a man in a suit
Who's gonna make you pay
For the thoughts that you think
And the words they won't let you say

Gonna leave you all behind
Wouldn't be so bad
If I had more time

Sailing down a river alone
I've been tryin' to find my way back home
But I don't believe in magic
Life is automatic
But I don't mind being on my own
No I don't mind being on my own
No I don't mind being on my own
I said that I don't mind being on my own

Sailing down a river alone
I've been tryin' to find my way back home
But I don't believe in magic
Life is automatic
But I don't mind being on my own
I said that I don't mind being on my own
No I don't mind being on my own
I said that I don't mind being on my own
No I don't mind being on my own
I said that I don't mind being on my own
