		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Where has it gone, that fire
That from the darkn ess kept us
Where all the righteous souls
With flames in their eyes

Yet in the end
The gilded tongues
Yes, in the end
They burrowed in spines

Yet in the end, the gilded tongues
They were serpentine

Step forward, lost seeker 
Read the signs of silence
Come close, turn the last stone
Truth lies in violence

See the limbs of chilling mist
Creeping these desolate halls
Searching, it seems for solace
For some haven 
From this terrible cold

Yet in the end, the gilded tongues
They were serpentine
Yes, in the end, the gilded ones
They were serpentine
