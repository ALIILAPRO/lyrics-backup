		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yo, I'm a dark Abyss
Apocalypse in my esophagus
Breathing phosphorous while
Kamikazes spit on top of it
Stomp the continents in consequence
Of your incompetence my consciousness
Emit's the kind of cognac that you vomit with
I'm kind of sick
Comets hit with less of confidence
So common is devoured galaxies
In lines of optimus
Galactus of the brain waves
Captain of the mayday if God required 7
Than I conquered on the 8th day
My Dragons reign is red pain
Blood Pumping through dead veins
Entire mind's my left brain
Creation caused my membranes
I post apocalyptic vision of
Warlocks and witches
With wisdom placed from incisions
Of surgically gifted children
My intensities strike heaven's peace down
To the guts of centipedes
And dead MC's who stepped to the
Rivers who scorched the seven seas

No More games
Set the world on fire screaming no more rain
No More games
Rip your knees from your cartilage
And bow to the king no More games
Set the world on fire screaming no more rain
No More games
Rip your knees from your cartilage
And bow to the king

57th passenger, fouler than your pastor is
My mind's arachnid, masterful
Weave a web of massacres
Ambassador of cracking wigs
Casket full of captured pigs
I rap to the percussion of
Crushed skulls and snapped ribs
The fact is I'm brutal
My backyard's like Lebanon
A lexicon drinking cherub's blood
From a devil's horn peddle porn, dope
Soap & hope like it's a telethon
The metal drawn precise like
A draftsman-accurate-shred velours
And level all in radius
My razor rips with gracefulness
I'll split your face, the stage & pavement
Lift the blade then shred the skies
Everything alive is jeopardized when
I've been weaponized
I specialize in genocide
Seven lives beyond death
My conquest stretches from Asgard
To the Throggs Neck
Mosh pit symphonies, center of the chaos
A marksman
Shoot you out of the circle of your seance
Fuck fortune you play the odds or lay
Your cards and forfeit, ahh

No More games
Set the world on fire screaming no more rain
No More games
Rip your knees from your cartilage
And bow to the king no More games
Set the world on fire screaming no more rain
No More games
Rip your knees from your cartilage
And bow to the king

You think that sleeps an option?
But sleep to me is like a lethal toxin
I walk the street looking for meat
So I can feed the goblin
It takes a god's philosophy
To conquer these concoctions
Telekinesis between dolphins in
The deepest cauldron
Failure is never in my mind
It couldn't be an option
I went to Kashmir to see
Inside the Jesus coffin
It's either heat or boxin
Because the beast is watching
Nobody ever wanted you
You had to seek adoption
I have a lust for blood and
That isn't a recent problem
I have a lust for drugs
And not to mention drinking problems
I put em in the motherfuckin'
Trash cause he a opossum
I pull the stainless
Make them shameless like if he was Rossum
It's time to bring the fucking pain
This is a demons doctrine
I take the ox and slice you up
Like it was Dietz & Watzon
Every rhyme I write is heroin
You need Suboxone rest in peace
BLOCKA BLOCKA now you meeting Cochran

No More games
Set the world on fire screaming no more rain
No More games
Rip your knees from your cartilage
And bow to the king no More games
Set the world on fire screaming no more rain
No More games
Rip your knees from your cartilage
And bow to the king
