		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  After all
She said
I lost the will to make it work
No sense
Just emptiness
You whittle away my love until it's apathy

Triggers implode
I want to be alone
Peace disrupt in public as we're
Walking by a roadside, screaming
"You never gave a shit about any of it"

Every time I look around
I never know what I will see
Every time I look down
I never hear those words to help me
No I don't
Where are we tomorrow
You don't feel
You don't have the love to let me in

She said
"Don't go
Without you how can I resume?"
Look at her
So unsure
Perfect for a moment then she's gone

Every time I look around
I never know what I will see
Every time I look down
I never hear those words to help me
No I don't
Oh you don't see
You don't feel
You don't have the love to let me in

Every time I look around
I never know what I will see
Every time I look down
I never hear those words to help me
No I don't
Where are we tomorrow?
Tell me why
Tell me once
What did I mean to you?
