		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Your gentle voice I hear
Your words echo inside me
You said "You long for me, that you love me"
And I want to see you too, feels just like I'm falling
Is there nothing I can do, wonder if you hear my calling

I'm here and waiting for you
Where are you, I can't find you
I'm here and waiting for you
I'll wait forever for you

Mom's gone to Heaven now
Why won't she come back down
Does she have someone she loves more than me
I thought I could love you better, we were always together
If we took some time apart you would finally know my heart

I'm here and waiting for you
Where are you, I can't find you
I'm here and waiting for you
I'll wait forever for you

I fell in Love with you and now you're gone
There's nothing left within my lonely room without you

I'm here and waiting for you
Where are you, I can't find you
I'm here and waiting for you
I'll wait forever for you
