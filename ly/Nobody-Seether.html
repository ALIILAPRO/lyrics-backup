		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I’m trying to find a reason to mend my ways
But this hesitation, well it slows me down
And it feels like I have lost you along the way, yeah
No ventilation, well it chokes me out

Confront it
If you keep talking that way ( To get some attention )
Nobody’s gonna find it hard
If you keep passing the blame, yeah ( You'll need an intervention )
You die with a lonely heart

I am filled with reservation and you with shame
A compulsive nature and a hurtful mouth
Now I make this observation to clear my name, yeah
You’re a black constellation with the stars burnt out

Confront it
If you keep talking that way ( To get some attention )
Nobody’s gonna find it hard
If you keep passing the blame, yeah ( You'll need an intervention )
You die with a lonely heart

You can’t make me stay, yeah ( Tell me can you take it? )
Can’t make me stay, yeah ( Tell me can you take it? )
Can’t make me stay, yeah ( Well tell me can you take it? )
Can’t make me stay

Confront it
If you keep talking that way ( To get some attention )
Nobody’s gonna find it hard
If you keep passing the blame, yeah ( You'll need an intervention )
You die with a lonely heart

You can’t make me stay, yeah ( Tell me can you take it? )
Can’t make me stay, yeah ( Tell me can you take it? )
Can’t make me stay, yeah ( Well tell me can you take it? )
Can’t make me stay
