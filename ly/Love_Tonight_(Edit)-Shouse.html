		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh

When you're tired
When you're lonely
Can just reach out an arm
Know I'll be there
I'll help you weather the storm
Us together
Nothing's ever felt more like home
Know I'll be there
You will never be alone

All I need is your love tonight
All I need is your love tonight
All I need is your love tonight (it's all I need)
All I need is your love tonight (tonight, tonight, ooh)

Ooh (love tonight)

In that moment
When you're feeling like there's nothing at all
Reach out to me
Know that I'll answer the call
Us together
Nothing's ever felt more like home
Know I'll be there
You will never be alone

All I need is your love tonight
All I need is your love tonight
All I need is your love tonight
All I need is your love tonight
All I need is your love tonight
All I need is your love tonight
All I need is your love tonight
All I need is your love tonight
All I need is your love tonight
All I need is your love tonight
