		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Waiting and waiting
For something that ain't too complicated
When I should've looked in
I guess I've been looking
In all the wrong places

Until I said "Hey, how you doing?
Yeah, I hope I'm well"
Time to put that love on myself
Before I give it back to someone else
I need to, I need to, put that

Love on myself
I need to put the love on myself
Before I give it to someone else, yeah
Love on myself
Love on myself

Waiting and waiting
I know that you had to be patient
Man I'm sorry for taking
Your time up and wasting
In all the wrong places

Until I said "Hey, how you doing?
Yeah, I hope you're well"
'Cause I've been putting love on myself
Now I can give it back to someone else
I need to, I need to, put that

Love on myself
I need to put the love on myself
Before I give it to someone else, yeah
Love on myself
Love on myself

When I'm alone with the air that I breathe
Breathing it in and you're all I can see
Don't nothing matter when you're home with me
When you're home with me
Oh, I couldn't be who I wanted to be
Being myself was a struggle for me
But falling in love, yeah, was all that I need
Is all that I need

Hey, how you doing? Yeah, I hope you're well
Hey, how you doing? Yeah, I hope you're well
Love on myself
Hey, how you doing? Yeah, I hope you're well
Love on myself
Hey, how you doing? Yeah, I hope you're well
Love on myself, love on myself
