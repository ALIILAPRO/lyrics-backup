Emotion  is my middle name 
I lay in bed and listen to the rain 
Put happy thoughts in to my head 
But I find instead the hurting words you said 
Why won't you believe me 
When I tell you the things that I see? 
And I'll still see you tomorrow  at the show 
It's been a long winded  long time 
I wish I'd never met you 
I wish I could forget you 
And what you said 
You're directing your complaints to me 
I should walk away, I could easily 
Never hear a word you say 
I'm not your robot or your slave 
I won't behave, I'm not your toy 
Go on go bury me with self righteousness 
I confess, I'm just a boy
