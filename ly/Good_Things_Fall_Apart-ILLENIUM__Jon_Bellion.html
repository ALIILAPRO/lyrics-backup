		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Did I say something wrong? Did you hear what I was thinking?
Did I talk way too long when I told you all my feelings that night?
Is it you? Is it me? Did you find somebody better?
Someone who isn't me, 'cause I know that I was never your type
Never really your type

Overthinking's got me drinking
Messing with my head, whoa

Tell me what you hate about me
Whatever it is, I'm sorry
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I know I can be dramatic
But everybody said we had it
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm coming to terms with a broken heart
I guess that sometimes good things fall apart

When you said it was real, guess I really did believe you
Did you fake how you feel when we parked down by the river that night? 
That night?
That night when we fogged up the windows in your best friend's car
'Cause we couldn't leave the windows down in December
Whoa

Tell me what you hate about me
Whatever it is, I'm sorry
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I know I can be dramatic
But everybody said we had it
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm coming to terms with a broken heart
I guess that sometimes good things fall apart

Overthinking's got me drinking
Messing with my head, oh

Tell me what you hate about me (about me)
Whatever it is, I'm sorry (oh, I'm sorry)
Yeah, yeah, yeah (oh, I'm sorry), yeah, yeah, yeah
I know I can be dramatic (I know I can be)
Everybody said we had it
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm coming to terms with a broken heart
I guess that sometimes good things fall apart
