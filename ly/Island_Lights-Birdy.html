		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Somehow
We have to make a start
To make it back before the dark

And somehow
We have to go on apart
The island lights are turning on

We have to move forwards
And fight our tears
We have to keep going
Or stay right here
We'll be right here
Till the morning comes
Oh, we'll be right here
Till the morning comes

You are my song and my silence
The only one I confide in
You are my sun and this winter never thaws
Nothing seems to grow here
Nothing seems to grow here anymore

Right now
Standing the way we are
The island lights look just like stars

Some day
When someone else has your love
We won't come here anymore

We have to move forwards
And fight our fears
We have to keep going
Or stay right here
We'll stay right here
Till the morning comes
Oh, we'll be right here
Till the morning comes

You are my song and my silence
The only one I confide in
You are my sun and this winter never thaws
And nothing seems to grow here
Nothing seems to grow here

Blame it on those cold and lonely winter days
Blame it on the clouds for always bringing rain
Blame it on the sky for why I feel this way
It's funny how the season never seems to change

But you are my song and my silence
The only one I confide in
You are my sun and this winter never thaws
Nothing seems to grow here anymore
Nothing seems to grow here anymore
