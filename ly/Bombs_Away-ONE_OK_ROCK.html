		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is the end of you and me
And I'm never going back
Before my broken soul begins to fade to black
And if I could show you now
Let you see the future
Burning out, burning out
This is confirmation

The higher up I get (the higher up I get)
I bury it, bury it
The higher up I get (the higher up I get)

Tick tick tock and it's bombs away
Come on, it's the only way
Save yourself for a better day
No, no, we are falling down
I know, you know this is over
Tick tick tock and it's bombs away
Now we're falling
Now we're falling down

Can you open up my eyes, let me see what I've become
Can you cover up my scars, every one
And if I could show you now, all the pain you're to blame
Burning out, burning out
This is confirmation

The higher up I get (the higher up I get)
I bury it, bury it
The higher up I get (the higher up I get)

Tick tick tock and it's bombs away
Come on, it's the only way
Save yourself for a better day
No, no, we are falling down
I know, you know this is over
Tick tick tock and it's bombs away
Now we're falling
Now we're falling down

Singing loud so I can hear in my head, in my head
I'm feeling restless
Hanging by a broken thread in my head, in my head, in my head, yeah
Singing loud so I can hear in my head, in my head
I'm feeling restless
Hanging by a broken thread in my head, in my head, in my head, yeah

Tick tick tock and it's bombs away
Come on, it's the only way
Save yourself for a better day
No, no, we are falling down
I know, you know this is over
Tick tick tock and it's bombs away
Now we're falling
Now we're falling down
Tick tick tock and it's bombs away
Tick tick tock and it's bombs away
Tick tick tock and it's bombs away
