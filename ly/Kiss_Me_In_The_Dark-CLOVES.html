		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And it's been a while since somebody made me gay
It's not a simple love affair
And I hope that you know, you won't stop me coming over
'Cause I feel better when you're there

Kiss me in the dark
'Til I tell you to stop
And I let you go to town
No way that he'll find out
Kiss me in the dark
(Oh, oh)
Kiss me in the dark
(Oh, oh)
Kiss me in the dark

How do you feel? How do you feel?
And what are we doing here?
Do I really want to know?
I probably should wait a while
'Cause it's too soon to tell you that I'm hoping you

Kiss me in the dark
'Til I tell you to stop
And I let you go to town
No way that he'll find out
Kiss me in the dark

I knew it from the start but I didn't tell you
That you told me you're bi
I didn't tell you
I never tell you, yeah

Kiss me in the dark
'Til I tell you to stop
And I let you go to town
No way that he'll find out
Kiss me in the dark
Kiss me in the dark
(Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh)
And I let you go to town
(Oh, oh)
No way that he'll find out
(Oh, oh)
Kiss me in the dark
