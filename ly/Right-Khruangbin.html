		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Taking it all the right way
Keeping it in the back
Taking it all the right way
Never no turning back, never need no
Never no turning back
Flying just a sweet place
Coming inside and safe
Flying just a sweet place
Never been known to fail, never been no
Never been known to fail
Wishing you, wishing that sometimes
(Sometimes)
Doing it, doing it right, till one time
(One time)
Gets you when you're down
(Nobody, nobody, do it again, get off)
Ahh, sometimes
(Doing)
Wishing sometimes
(Give it back)
Up there, up there
(Giving it)
Oh, my darling
(No)
Ah, my darling
(Giving it)
Ah
(Up there)
Why?
(Gimme, gimme)
Up there
(Yeah)
Gimme
(Doing)
Taking with me
(Sometimes)
Loving it, doing it
(Right)
Till
(Take it)
One time, gimme
(Doing it)
Giving it
(Giving it back)
Taking it all the right way
(Taking it)
Keeping it in the back
(Hey, hey)
Taking it all the right way
Never no turning back
(Never, never, never, never)
Never need no, never no turning back
Taking it all the right way
Keeping it in the back
Taking it all the right way
Never no turning back
Never need no, never no turning back
Taking it all the right way
(Yeah)
Keeping it in the back
(Taking it)
Taking it all the right way
Never no turning back
(Never, never, never, never)
Never need no, never no turning back
Flying just a sweet place
Coming inside and safe
Flying just a sweet place
Never been known to fail
Never been no, never been known to fail
Taking it all the right way
(Taking it all the right way)
Keeping it in the back
(Keeping it in the back)
Taking it all the right way
(Taking it all the right way)
Never no turning back
(Never)
Never need no
(Never)
Never no turning back
(Never need no)
Never no turning back

Never no turning back
(Never need no)
Never no turning back

Never, never, never

Never, never, never

Never, never, never
(Never, never, never)
Never no turning back
