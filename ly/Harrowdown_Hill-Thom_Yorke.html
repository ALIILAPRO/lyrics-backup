		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't walk the plank like I did
You will be dispensed with
When you've become
Inconvenient
Up on Harrowdown Hill
Near where you used to go to school
That's where I
That's where I am lying down
Did I fall or was I pushed?
Did I fall or was I pushed?
Then where's the blood?
Then where's the blood?

But I'm coming home, I'm coming home
To make it alright, so dry your eyes
We think the same things at the same time
We just can't do anything about it

We think the same things at the same time
We just can't do anything about it

So don't ask me, ask the ministry
Don't ask me, ask the ministry
We think the same things at the same time
There are so many of us, so you can't count

We think the same things at the same time
There are so many of us, so you can't count

Can you see me when I'm running?
Can you see me when I'm running?
Away from there
Away from there
I can't take the pressure
No one cares if you live or die
They just want me gone
They want me gone

But I'm coming home, I'm coming home
To make it alright, so dry your eyes
We think the same things at the same time
We just can't do anything about it

We think the same things at the same time
There are too many of us, so you can't
There are too many of us, so you can't count

It was me lead onto the back of Harrowdown Hill
It was me lead onto the back of Harrowdown Hill
It was a slippery, slippery, slippery slope
It was a slippery, slippery, slippery slope
I feel me slipping in and out of consciousness
I feel me slipping in and out of consciousness
I feel me
