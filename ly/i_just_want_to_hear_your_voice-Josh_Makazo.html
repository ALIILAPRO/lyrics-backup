		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Verse 01:
I know I lost hold of the moment,
If you would just listen I take it back

Verse 02:
And all of these years I didn't show it,
All of these feelings I'm holding back,
I've never been fair to you

Pre-Chorus:
Cause I know that I had a choice,
I just wanna hear your voice again,
Again

Chorus:
Cause I know that I had a choice,
I just wanna hear your voice again,
With everything that I have done (Oh)

I know that I had a choice,
I just wanna hear your voice again,
Just know I hate what I've become,
With all these all these, all these, things I've done

Post-Chorus:
And I swear to you,
I've been wrong but I'll be back,
But if I care for you,
Yea I know I can never ask,

Baby I swear to you,
In my heart you'll always last,
Oh you've been the crash the crash the crash

Bridge:
And baby there's nobody else who could top this,
I'm feeling too nauseous,
I promise I've been keeping my promise,
Forever means whenever regardless

Regardless I've lost us,
I hate that I still love you without us,
The love that I gave made me heartless,
I'm heartless, I'm heartless, I'm heart-

Outro:
Cause you'll still have my heart the most,
I just want to hear your voice again,
Again
