		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tonight, oh 
This is the night you'll see the light 
Tonight, oh 
This is the night you'll see the light 

My 16th birthday I was so shy 
Not yet a man but ready to try 
Music playing people saying 
I looked around she caught my eye 
Walked into the room I couldn't hardly see 
There she was moving closer to me 
She told me her name before I could speak 
Took my hand and then she said these words to me 

Tonight, oh 
This is the night you'll see the light 
Tonight, oh 
This is the night you'll see the light 

Hey beautiful girl so lovely tonight 
Show me the way show me the light 
Music playing people swaying 
Next thing I knew we started to groove 
Dancing and dancing moving so free 
A feeling of love had come over me 
I held her close and knew it was right 
What a perfect surprise I had finally seen the light 

Tonight, you will finally see the light baby 
Tonight, you will finally see the light baby 
Tonight, you will finally see the light 
You will see, ooh you will see the light 
Tonight you will finally see the light 
Oh yeah 

Tonight, you will finally see the light baby 
Tonight, you will finally see the light baby 
Tonight, you will finally see the light 
You will see, ooh you will see the light 
Tonight you will finally see the light 
Oh yeah 

Oh come on I want to dance with you 
Oh come on I want to dance 
Oh come on I want to dance with you 
Oh come on I want to dance with you
