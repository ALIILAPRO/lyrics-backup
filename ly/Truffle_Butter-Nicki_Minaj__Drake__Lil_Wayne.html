		  (You know, yeah)
(Touchin', yeah)
(Night of)
(You know, yeah)
(Touchin', yeah)
(Night of)

Uh, thinkin' out loud
I must have a quarter million on me right now
Hard to make a song 'bout somethin' other than the money
Two things I'm about is talkin' blunt and staying blunted
Pretty women, are you here? Are you here right now, huh?
We should all disappear right now
Look, you're gettin' all your friends and you're gettin' in the car
And you're comin' to the house, are we clear right now, huh?
You see the fleet of all the new things
Cop cars with the loose change
All white like I move things
Niggas see me rollin' and their mood change
Like a motherfucker
New flow, I got a dozen of 'em
I don't trust you, you are undercover
I could probably make some step-sisters fuck each other, woo
Talkin' filets with the truffle butter
Fresh sheets and towels, man, she gotta love it
Yeah, they all get what they desire from it
What? Tell them niggas we ain't hidin' from it

(You know, yeah)
(Touchin', yeah)
(Night of)
(You know, yeah)
(Touchin', yeah)
(Night of)

Yo, thinkin' out loud
I must have about a mili' on me right now
And I ain't talkin' 'bout that Lil Wayne record
I'm still the highest sellin' female rapper, for the record
Man, this the sixty-five million singles sold
I ain't gotta compete with a single soul
I'm good with the ballpoint game, finger roll
Ask me how to do it, I don't tell a single soul
Pretty women, wassup? Is you here right now?
You a stand-up or is you in your chair, right now uh?
Do you hear me?
I can't let a wack nigga get near me
I might kiss the baddest bitch, if you dare me
I ain't never need a man, to take care of me
Yo, I'm in that big boy, bitches can't rent this
I floss every day, but I ain't a dentist
Your whole style and approach, I invented
And I ain't takin' that back, 'cause I meant it, yeah

(You know, yeah)
(Touchin', yeah)
(Night of)
(You know, yeah)
(Touchin', yeah)
(Night of)

Uh, thinkin' out loud
I could be broke and keep a million dollar smile
Lol to the bank checkin' my account
Bank teller flirtin' after checkin' my account
Pretty ladies, are you here?
Truffle butter on your pussy
Cuddle buddies on the low
You ain't gotta tell your friend
That I eat it in the morning
'Cause she gonna say, "I know"
Can I hit it in the bathroom?
Put your hands on the toilet
I'll put one leg on the tub
Girl, this my new dance move
I just don't know what to call it
But bitch you dancing with the stars
I ain't nothin' like your last dude
What's his name? Not important
I bought some Cocaine, if you snortin'
She became a vacuum
Put it on my dick like carpet
Suck the white off, white chocolate
I'm so heartless, thoughtless, lawless and flawless
Smallest regardless, largest in charge
And born in New Orleans, get killed for Jordans
Skateboard, I'm gnarly, Drake, Tunechi and Barbie you know

(You know, yeah)
(Touchin', yeah)
(Night of)
(You know, yeah)
(Touchin', yeah)
(Night of)
