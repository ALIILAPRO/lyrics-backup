		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, mama and papa told me
I was crazy to stay
I was gay in New York
Just a fag in L.A.
So I saved my money
And I took a plane
Wherever I go they treat me the same

When the whip comes down
When the whip comes down
When the whip comes down
When the whip comes down, yeah

Yeah I'm going down fifty-third street
And they spit in my face
I'm learning the ropes
Yeah I'm learning a trade
The East River truckers
Are churning with trash
I've got so much money
That I spend so fast

When the whip comes down, yeah
When the whip comes down
When the whip comes down
When the whip comes down

When the shit hits the fan
I'll be sitting on the can
When the whip comes down

Yeah, some called me garbage
When I was sleeping on the street
I never roll
Oh I never cheat
And I'm filling a need, yeah
I'm plugging a hole
My mama's so glad
I ain't on the dole

When the whip comes down, yeah
When the whip comes down, yeah
When the shit hits the fan
I'll be sitting on the can
When the whip comes down
When the whip comes down

When the whip comes down
When the whip comes down
When the whip comes down
When the whip comes down

(Yeah, go ahead check it out)

Yeah, baby, when the whip comes down
When the whip comes down, yeah
(I'll be running this town, I'll tell you)
When the shit hits the fan
I'll be sittin on the can
When the whip comes down, yeah

Yeah when the whip comes down
When the whip comes down
When the whip comes down, yeah
