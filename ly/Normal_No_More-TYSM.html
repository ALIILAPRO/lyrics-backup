		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't wanna be normal no more
I don't wanna take drugs in the club
I don't wanna pretend I'm in love
Don't wanna put out just for fun
I don't wanna be normal no more
I don't wanna take drugs in the club
I don't wanna pretend I'm in love
Don't wanna put out just for fun

Sober when I'm faded
Permanent vacation
Don't care if I'm jaded
Done with all this faking

I don't wanna have to try, no
I could walk a perfect line now
I don't want no alibi, no
Don't lose any sleep at night, no

I don't wanna be normal no more
I don't wanna take drugs in the club
I don't wanna pretend I'm in love
Don't wanna put out just for fun
I don't wanna be normal no more
I don't wanna take drugs in the club
I don't wanna pretend I'm in love
Don't wanna put out just for fun

Drinking from the bottle 
But it's just Pellegrino
Getting fucked up got real boring
So it's Grino for placebo

I don't wanna have to try, no
I could walk a perfect line now
I don't want no alibi, no
Don't lose any sleep at night, no

I don't wanna be normal no more
I don't wanna take drugs in the club
I don't wanna pretend I'm in love
Don't wanna put out just for fun
I don't wanna be normal no more
I don't wanna take drugs in the club
I don't wanna pretend I'm in love
Don't wanna put out just for fun

I don't wanna be normal no more
I don't wanna be normal no more
I don't wanna be normal no more

I don't wanna be normal no more
