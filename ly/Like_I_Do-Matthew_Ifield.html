		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's sunshine in her smile
She acts like she's a child, me too
She's pretty in her dress
But she's pretty nonetheless, it's true

If her heart would break in two
I would stay to see her through
And I like her I wish she knew
I hope she likes me like I do

Slow dancing in the rain
Or traveling to Spain with you
I'm desperate for her touch
But would she think it's too much, would you?

If her heart would break in two
I would stay to see her through
And I like her I wish she knew
Cause no one likes her like I do

I wish for love from her
I cross my fingers in the hopes that she wishes for same
Oh but why can't she move on to someone else
Someone like me

If her heart would break in two
I would stay to see her through
And I like her I wish she knew
I hope she loves me like I do

And if her heart would break in two
Just tell me,
Oh, tell me,
Oh, please tell me that you love me too
And I love her I wish she knew
Cause no one loves her like I do

Oh
