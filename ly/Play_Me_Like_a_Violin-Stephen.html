		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This fire in my head's got me on edge
I'm going out tonight
Faded on a thread, don't know what's next
I wanna feel alive

I kissed a stranger in a white dress
She put a crown on a top on my head
Said every king needs a queen in his bed

I said, "Hey girl, hey girl
I'd like to stay here for a while
Just you and I
Far from the places we can't get away from"

She said, "Hey boy, hey boy
I like your style
I'll let you play me for a while
Play me 'til the sun rises
Play me like a violin"

I'm here with you now, not coming down
Leave my insanity
Up here in the clouds, look what we found
Oxygen we can breathe

Let the madness slowly undress
Rip the mask off over our heads
We can dive down deeper instead

I said, "Hey girl, hey girl
I'd like to stay here for a while
Just you and I
Far from the places we can't get away from"

She said, "Hey boy, hey boy
I like your style
I'll let you play me for a while
Play me 'til the sun rises
Play me like a violin"

Play me 'til the sun rises
Play me 'til your hands give in
Play me like a violin

Play me 'til the sun rises
Play me 'til you can't hide it
Play me like a violin

Play me 'til the sun rises
Play me 'til your hands give in
Play me like a violin

Play me 'til the sun rises
Play me 'til you can't hide it
Play me like a violin
