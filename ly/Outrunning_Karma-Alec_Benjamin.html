		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Outrunning karma, that boy
He's such a charmer, all the
Bugs and their larva follow
Him out to Colorado
Ten-dozen hearts in a bag
Their bodies lyin', he'll drag
Them down to Colorado
A modern desperado

And he'll race for miles through the night
He runs because he knows he cannot hide

He's never gonna make it, all the
Poor people he's forsaken, karma
Is always gonna chase him for his lies
It's just a game of waiting from the
Church steeple down to Satan karma
There's really no escape until he dies

Outrunning karma, that boy
Can't run no farther, it's the
Last days of Sparta, follow
Him down to meet Apollo

And he'll brace for battle in the night
He'll fight because he knows he cannot hide

He's never gonna make it, all the
Poor people he's forsaken, karma
Is always gonna chase him for his lies
It's just a game of waiting from the
Church steeple down to Satan karma
There's really no escape until he dies

La-la-la, la la, la-la-la, la la
La-la-la, la la, la la
La-la-la, la la, la-la-la, la la
La-la-la, la la, la la

He's never gonna make it, all the
Poor people he's forsaken, karma
Is always gonna chase him for his lies
It's just a game of waiting from the
Church steeple down to Satan karma
There's really no escape until he dies

La-la-la, la la, la-la-la, la la
La-la-la, la la, la la
