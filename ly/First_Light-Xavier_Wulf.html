		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  4 AM, I'm out here smokin' on that noodie
I see the sun rise now it's
Time to keep it movin'
You niggas ain't a threat who
You thought you was behoovin'
I'm riding through the county on
Me bumpin' old music
I pulled up on my momma just
To see what they was doin'
I'm headed out to eat
I jus ate but I'm hungry
I ain't finna play wit none of
You niggas or ya homies
He said he wouldn't run
Found out that was bologna bitch

Yea nigga, hell yea, send him off a cliff
She said I drove her crazy told
That bitch to get a grip
I got the F80 just to add it to the whips
I pull up to the car me smokin' on a fifth
If I let you slide then consider that a gift
If I'm fuckin' with her let
Her book a lil trip
Ion remember nothin' but I bet I wont forget
If he run up on me let that old boat rip
They thought I was sketchy why
His hand on his hip?
Stage 2 tuned hit the pop when I dip
Imma raise a cup for the hood and take a sip
Imma have a fucking blast crash the event
Imma tell it to the class
He ain't really rich
Piccadilly eating ass niggas talking shit
They was in the club smokin' only one skimp

When I get a steak I need
A side of grilled shrimp
Or go get the crab legs, butter up the bitch
I ain't even flex I will
Butter off the bitch
She wanna pull up jus cuz' the accent
Ion give a fuck don't give me ya two cents
Imma give it to a junkie like he needed it
She looked up at me and
Said "you so conceited-ed"
He said he was comin' but
I'm not believin' it you bitch
