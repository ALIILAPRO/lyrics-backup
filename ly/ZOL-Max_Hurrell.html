		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When people zol
Eh and then they share that zol
When people zol (eh, eh, eh, eh)
And then they share that zol (eh, eh, eh, eh)

When it comes to cigarettes, tobacco products
And related
That we should not open up the sealed products
And the reason are health related
Eh but also when people zol
They put saliva on the paper
And then they share that zol
It means they are also sharing

If when people zol
They put saliva on the paper
And then they share that zol
But also they are moving saliva 
From one to the
From one to the
From one to the
From one to the other

Eh, and then they share that zol

When people zol
And then they share that zol

Eh, when it comes to cigarettes, tobacco products
And related
That we should not open up the sealed products
And the reason are health related
Eh but also when people zol
They put saliva on the paper
And then they share that zol
It means they are also sharing

If when people zol
They put saliva on the paper
And then they share that zol

"We announce that"

When people zol
They put saliva on the paper
And then they share that zol
It means they are also sharing

If when people zol
They put saliva on the paper
And then they share that zol
