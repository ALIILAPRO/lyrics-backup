		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Lovin' you is easy, loving you is easy)
(Lovin' you, loving you, loving you)

You take slow and sweet like honey
You don't seem to care about the money
I don't know any other way to say it
Life's a drum and I like the way you play it

'Cause you got somethin' I ain't ever seen
A spark of light in a dark sky, honey
You take a wish from my wildest dreams and you make it true
That's what you do

You got the spark of light
You don't even have to try
You got the spark of light
Lovin' you is easy (lovin' you is easy)

You walk in and the room gets brighter
Somehow the weight of the world gets lighter
I don't know any other way to say it 
Life's a drum and I like the way you play it

'Cause you got something that I ain't ever seen
A spark of light in a dark sky, honey
You take a wish from my wildest dreams and you make it true
That's what you do

You got the spark of light
You don't even have to try
You got the spark of light
Lovin' you is easy (lovin' you is easy)

You got the spark of light
You don't even have to try
You got the spark of light
Lovin' you is easy (lovin' you is easy)

Everywhere you go it's like you got the sound of music in you
The way you're moving though you've never seem to lose do you
I love the spark in your eyes
You remind me of everything good in my life

The spark of light (the spark of light)
You don't even have to try (you don't have to try)
You got the spark of light
Lovin' you is easy (lovin' you is easy)

You got the spark of light (you the spark of light)
You don't even have to try (you don't have to try)
You got the spark of light (spark of light)
Lovin' you is easy (lovin' you is easy)

Know you got the spark of light
You got the spark, honey
You got the spark of light
