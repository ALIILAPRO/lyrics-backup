		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I called you again
I don't know why I keep on
Thinking that we're friends
'Cause we don't really talk anymore
And I'm sorry for that
Honestly, I never really loved you that bad

And that could be the end of it
But I never know when to stop talking
So I'll make my bed and sleep in it alone
'Cause I never know when we're done talking
If I don't love you, then why?

Did I call you again?
I think that I was lonely
And I missed having friends
Now we don't really talk anymore
And it's good for us both
'Cause I know you love me the most

And that should be the end of it
But I never know when to stop talking
So I'll make my bed and sleep in it alone
'Cause I never know when we're done talking (oh)
And that should be the end of it
But I never know when to stop talking (when to stop talking)
So I'll make my bed and sleep in it alone
'Cause I never know when we're done talking
You're better off on your own

But you called me again
I don't know why it never seems to end
No, we don't really talk anymore
And it makes sense
'Cause all I do is hurt you
All I do is hurt you
All I do is cause you pain

'Cause I called you again
