		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I still look for you in everyone 
but I'll never find

You, ooh
Oh, there'll never be another one of you
You, ooh
Oh, there'll never be another one of you

Thought I'd never have a reason to breathe past seventeen
'til you came in and everything became the silver screen

I still look for you in everyone but I'll never find

You, ooh
Oh, there'll never be another one of you
You, ooh
Oh, there'll never be another one of you

Oh, I just wanna hold you by the coast
But you're slipping through my fingers like a ghost
We'll watch as the days become years
'Cause they'll move on but I'll still be here
I'll still be here for you

I still look for you in everyone but I'll never find

You, ooh
Oh, there'll never be another one of you
You, ooh
Oh, there'll never be another one of you
