		  Better Walk Alone
Lyrics & Melodies: Kent Hilli Music: Kent Hilli , Rolf Nordström, Leif Ehlin, Fredrik Forsberg, Mats Byström

So damn good
When we make love you know it's all understood 
but i'm so damn tired
you cross all the lines 
And put our love on a trial

You know that it's almost gone
It's just not enough you leave me hanging alone
Cause all of these lonely nights
U know i've been blind so keep your love on the side

So Tell me baby is it someone i know
Or just an old hard habit to break

Now
You better walk alone
You better be in hurry
Go back where you belong
I'm Better safe then sorry
you better walk alone
Now u better walk alone
Aah, You better walk alone baby

it's understood 
When we say goodbye you know  
This love aint no good
Cause all of these lonely nights
U say you're in love but there's some things u cant hide

Brygga:
So tell me baby is it someone i know
Or just an old hard habit to break

Now
You better walk alone
You better be in hurry
Go back where you belong
I'm Better safe then sorry
you better walk alone

I'll never tell u i'm sorry
 Its much too late
You better leave in a hurry
Cause It's all a mistake
Oh yeah
woooah Come on

You're so damn good
You're so damn tiring
Everyone who knows me saying , you're crossing all the lines

Now
You better walk alone
You better be in hurry
Go back where you belong
I'm Better safe then sorry
Now you better walk alone
You better be in hurry
Go back where you belong
I'm Better safe then sorry
Now You better walk alone
Aah, You better walk alone baby
You better walk alone
You better walk alone
