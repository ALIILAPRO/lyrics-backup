		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Rolling on this boat there's no devotion for the rotation 
Take control don't let this boat take over your emotion 
No (ohh) 

I dont like class For the rap 
Or the hoes who will clap 
Without knowing The flows of the stacked 
I devote my emotion attached to the roll 
And I roll to the show to attack (Eyy) 

Re-up the mass 
Make that shit that don't pass 
Hand over the cash 
Feet stand over the pack 

Man crying like a little bitch 
Like a Morty
If I cant afford it, I be like rich
On a little forty
Living to flow, until I've written the story

Re-up the mass 
Make the shit that don't pass
We up, we don't need to get to class 
He up, he don't see a get up fast

Walking, flossing, no talking 'cause often 
Walking, flossing, no talking 'cause often 
No talking 'cause often 
No talking 'cause often 
No talking 'cause often 
I'm working on my options

I'm working on my options
Walking, flossing, no talking 'cause often 
No talking 'cause often 
No talking 'cause often 
No talking 'cause often 
No talking 'cause often 
No talking 'cause often 
I'm working on my options

Walking, flossing, no talking 'cause often 
Walking, flossing, no talking 'cause often 
No talking 'cause often 
No talking 'cause often 
No talking 'cause often 
I'm working on my options

Rolling on this boat there's no devotion for the rotation 
Take control don't let this boat take over your emotion 
No (ohh) 

No talking 'cause often 
No talking 'cause often 
No talking 'cause often 
I'm working on my options

I'm working on my options
