		  Everybody *wooh*
Rock your body
Everybody
Rock your body right
Little Big, alright

Oh my God, we're back again (we're back again, we're back again)
Brothers, sisters, everybody sing (everybody sing, everybody sing)
Gonna bring the flavor, show you how (show you how, show you how)
Got a question for you, better answer now

Am I original? *Baa!*
Am I the only one? *Baa!*
Am I sexual? *Baa!*
Am I everything you need? You better rock your body now

Everybody *Baa!*
Rock your body *Baa!*
Everybody
Rock your body right
Little Big, alright
Alright

Now throw your hands up in the air
Wave them around like you just don't care
If you wanna party, let me hear you yell
'Cause we got it going on again, yeah

Am I original? *Baa!*
Am I the only one? *Baa!*
Am I sexual? *Baa!*
Am I everything you need? You better rock your body now

Everybody *Baa!*
Rock your body *Baa!*
Everybody
Rock your body right
Little Big, alright
Alright
Alright
