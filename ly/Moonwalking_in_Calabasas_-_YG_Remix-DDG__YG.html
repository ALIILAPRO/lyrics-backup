		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ballin' since I was jit
Way before Oakland and filmin' the skits
I had a goal to get rich
Mama was strugglin' paying the rent
I couldn't help her with shit
Hate that I'm feelin' so stuck in this bitch (Devo this shit hard)
Car broke down, can't fix that shit
I cried at night, I'll admit that shit
O2, old, I'll whip that bitch
She left me 'lone but I miss that bitch
If she text right now, I'll hit that bitch
Old friends like, "How you get that lit?"
Same old me but they think I switched
Fuck old friends I don't know that bitch
Racks too big, can't fold that shit
I ain't get none when I owned that shit
Mama I told you we gon' be okay
Whippin' that Benz and she live in L.A
Tryna thank God but don't know what to say

Don't call that lil' ass place no estate
Unless it came with a pool and a gate (gate)
Check the rear before I pull in the gate (hey)
All my watches flooded just like a lake (wave)
Lately I've been showing up extra late (late)
Rich nigga take her on a cheap date (ooh)
'4 for 4' Wendy's get her a plate (plate)
Love when these nuts all up in her face
She say, "Wow" (wow), never met a nigga with dick in her house
Spit in her mouth, diggin' her out with the choppa
In the couch for a rat or a mouse

Mm, I feel like Michael Jackson
Moonwalkin' through the Calabasas
Louis bag gotta hold the ratchet
Just in case a nigga want some action
Mm, got some millions but it's just a fraction
Spendin' money for my satisfaction
Benjamin's, we don't fuck with Jackson's

Bet when I dropped, they don't post that shit (yeah, yeah, yeah)
All good though, I'ma note that shit
When I blow you'll owe me bitch
Humble ass nigga but I know I'm rich (yeah, rich ass fuck)
Fuck that shit I know I'm lit
If we beef I fuck your bitch
All of the niggas I beef on the internet
I hit up all of they bitches and get 'em wet
Call her a Uber, I hit 'em and send 'em back
Do it in silence cause players' ain't into that
No, oh, I hit his bitch on the low, oh
She said your dick game was so-so
And she had told me you're broke (that's tough)

That's tough, that's tough
Blueface and DDG, hoes at the 'BnB
Watching a DVD, giving her DVD
2020 Wagon, A-B-C-D-E-F-G
Get too close, it go bee-bee-bee-bee-bee
Road runner all he heard was me-me-me
Yerr, seven-fifty in the horse
Hopped out the Porsche then I crashed the Porsche
Hop out the bed and I smash the whore
Knock-knock, guess who's at the door
Oops, forgot I ordered that Dior (bop)
Came in straight from Europe (bop)

Spent four hunnid on beanies, easy
She want dick, she needy, freaky
I like Wraiths, no Lamborghini
She off X, she sleepy, sleepy, yeah
Make me a wish no genie, genie
Vanish on niggas just like Houdini

Mm, I feel like Michael Jackson
Moonwalkin' through the Calabasas
Louis bag gotta hold the ratchet
Just in case a nigga want some action
Mm, got some millions but it's just a fraction
Spendin' money for my satisfaction
Benjamin's, we don't fuck with Jackson's

Benjamin's, we don't fuck with Jackson's (wow)
I feel like Michael Jackson
Moonwalkin' through the Calabasas
