		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What if you never parked your car in that parking lot?
Took out the keys from the ignition
Or just found a different parking spot
If my friends had never called to go to the shopping mall
And I never walked through those main doors
Where you were standing by the dollar store

Asked me my name with those eyes
What if I had just thought twice?
What if I walked away?
Would you still have my heart today?
One, two, three, four

Do I think of you now and then?
Do I defend you to my friends?
Do I tell your mom and dad that things turned out for the best?
Do I look fondly through our texts?
Still have your picture on my desk?
Would I do it all again?
No, I hate you and I never want to see your face again

What if you never asked me out
To go to the after party
Only to leave me in the living room where I didn't know nobody
What if you treated me with the kindness and the respect I deserve (what?)
Maybe I'd have stayed with you
For years with a sociopathic lying piece of shit

Do I think of you now and then?
Do I defend you to my friends?
Do I tell your mom and dad that things turned out for the best?
Do I look fondly through our texts?
Still have your picture on my desk?
Would I do it all again?
No, I hate you and I never want to see your face again

Do I think of you now and then?
Do I defend you to my friends?
Do I tell your mom and dad that things turned out for the best?
Do I look fondly through our texts?
Still have your picture on my desk?
Would I do it all again?
No, I hate you and I never want to see your face again
See your face again

And I deleted all our photos
And I love it 'cause it's like we never met
Like, you never parked your car in that parking lot
