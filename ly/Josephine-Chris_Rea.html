		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's rain on my window
But I'm thinking of you
Tears on my pillow
But I will come through
Josephine, I'll send you all my love
And every single step I take
I take for you
Josephine

There's a storm on my radar
But I can still fly
And you are the reason
The blue in my sky
Josephine

A life without meaning
I was walking away
In the coldest of winters
Night becomes day
Josephine, I'll send you all my love
And every single step I take
I take for you
Josephine
