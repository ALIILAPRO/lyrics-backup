		  Help
Oh, well
Everybody going up, but I'm going to hell
I don't even give a fuck what I'm doing, who cares
I be thinking that I'm nuts, but who isn't?
I stare, I stare screaming
Help
Oh, well
Everybody going up, but I'm going to hell
I don't even give a fuck what I'm doing, who cares
I be thinking that I'm nuts, but who isn't?
I stare, I stare screaming

It started on a Sunday, and I was just doing nothing but partying it up with some people I knew enough, um
I'm just looking at things
The sweaty bodies go on scheming
They be praising me, I'm dreaming
'Cause I made it now, I'm something, at least
I think I am? That's what they say I am? Not playing, man
I'm just doing everything that I fucking can
I don't even know what's just going on but they thinking
Looking at me like I am money
Shut up
And now they speaking
Fake, so I'll be
Drinking it up and then some
Hinting I'm done, they nincom-
Poops who keep talking, I'm hostage
"But sponsors?"
Paid my ransom
I'm just an artist astonished by all the offers that coming
But if I'm honest, now harder to start a fucking convo
Am I having fun? Yes, but, damn, I'm also not
Jeez, people going on and thinking that fames nothing but ducking problems
Assuming some wealth, but they summon dozens of crummy demons
They done and gon' fuck themselves as they come up screaming

Help
Oh, well
Everybody going up, but I'm going to hell
I don't even give a fuck what I'm doing, who cares
I be thinking that I'm nuts, but who isn't?
I stare, I stare screaming
Help
Oh, well
Everybody going up, but I'm going to hell
I don't even give a fuck what I'm doing, who cares
I be thinking that I'm nuts, but who isn't?
I stare, I stare screaming

"Friends are coming someday", I said
Fame hits
Gained some, dummy I am, lost them
Oh, shit
All alone I ponder, wonder if I'm ever gonna find some
Never thought it could get harder, happens when your evil
"Hello, can I be your friend-O?"
"Adam, you're great, you fucking make me want to explode!"
"Hey, since I got you, shout me out and then help me grow"
"Wait, what the fuck did you just tell me? Fucking heck no? Bitch, go!"
"Hello, can I be your friend-O?"
Everybody looking at me making this joke
I'm getting sick of it, I think I'm going mental
Can't even make some friends who sinking in the same boat
Ah, no!

Angry, mad at the world!
I'm freaking
I know it's absurd, but these are the things that keeping me up
My demons
I'm pushing most people away
Despiting the fact that some grate
Just used to an industry of manipulate
Every time, I'm doing it often
Then often find myself huffing and puffing, I'm fussing
My eyes are blinking
Pretty immature
Need to try out something different
I'm missing when things were simple, but hear me listen
I'll never stop pursuing what I fucking love, I'm doing everything I can
I'm making sure I rise above, but sometimes I feel like it's often going off the wall
But, huh
I'm just a youngin, built this stuff alone
Edge double sword, I think I'm holding screaming

Help
Oh, well
Everybody going up, but I'm going to hell
I don't even give a fuck what I'm doing, who cares
I be thinking that I'm nuts, but who isn't?
I stare, I stare screaming
Help
Oh, well
Everybody going up, but I'm going to hell
I don't even give a fuck what I'm doing, who cares
I be thinking that I'm nuts, but who isn't?
I stare, I stare screaming

Help!
Oh I need help!
Help!
Oh I need! I need! I need!
HELP!!!
