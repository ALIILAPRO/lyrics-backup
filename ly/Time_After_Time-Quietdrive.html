		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lying in my bed, I hear the clock tick, and think of you
Caught up in circles confusion is nothing new
You say go slow; I fall behind
The second hand unwinds

If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you; I'll be waiting
Time after time

Time after time
Time after time

Sometimes you picture me; I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me; I can't hear just what you've said
You say go slow; I fall behind
The second hand unwinds

If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you; I'll be waiting
Time after time

After my picture fades and darkness has turned to gray
Watching through windows, you're wondering if I'm okay
But you say go slow; I fall behind
The drum beats out of time

If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you; I'll be waiting
Time after time

If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you; I'll be waiting
(I'll always be waiting)
Time after time
Time after time
Time after time
