		  (Whoa-whoa)

You can tell ya girlfriends 'bout me
It's about time to get dirty
Know I wanna work that body
Come work it over here
You can be my brown eyed beauty
And I bet you see right through me
You can do anything to me
Oh-oh

Your so beautiful tonight anything is possible
But you know I just can't get enough
Of your love.. so give it up

[Chorus:]
Got my eyes on you
Won't you bring that back to me
Got my eyes on you
You know where I'm gonna be
Got my eyes on you
And I see you checkin' me
Got my eyes on you
Ooh-ooh
And I like what I see

Hold on...
Hold on...

You can tell anyone about it
Though we don't have to hide it
Come and get a little bit excited
Excited over here
Don't stop baby no don't stop
I know you really like it when your on top
Don't be shy just give it up
C'mon girl..

Your so beautiful tonight anything is possible
But you know I just can't get enough
Of your love... so give it up

[Chorus]

Hold on...

Oh-oh, Oh-oh
Your body's whining
(Oh-oh, Oh-oh)
Bumpin' and grindin'
(Oh-oh, Oh-oh)
Stop and rewindin'
(Oh-oh, Oh-oh)
Hold on...
(Oh-oh, Oh-oh)
Gettin' you hot now
(Oh-oh, Oh-oh)
Baby don't stop now
(Oh-oh, Oh-oh)
Got you all hot now
(Oh-oh, Oh-oh)
Hold on...

[Chorus]
