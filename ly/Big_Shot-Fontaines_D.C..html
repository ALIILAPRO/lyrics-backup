		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You've been through the war
But you've nothing to show
I traveled to space
Found the moon too small
And home is a pin
Rusting through a map
I go there to pray
Do my resting at mass

Everybody gets a big shot, baby
Everybody gets a big shot lately
Everybody gets a big shot, baby

You choose to show when you know
No one's watching how you spread
Empty scum, forget their name
Nothing scratches off your blame

I've been leaving it all
I've been living it all
I've been leaving it all
I've been living it all
I've been leaving it all
I've been living it all
I've been leaving it all

Everybody gets a big shot, baby
Everybody gets a big shot lately
Everybody gets
Everybody gets
