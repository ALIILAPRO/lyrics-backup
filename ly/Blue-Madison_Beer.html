		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was always blue behind the red blood stain on my lips
You were always green with envy
Saw right through the tenderness
We were like a California sunset
Faded to die any minute
Getting rid of you might be the best thing I ever did

And I was seeing us in a silent movie
Taking off our gloves like a violent crime scene
Diamonds in the cut always know how to fool me
Oh honey

But I know when to run, run, run
I know when to run, run, run
I know when to run, run, run
When my makeup does
When my makeup does

And I know when to run, run, run
I know when to run, run
And I know when to run, run, run
When my makeup does
When my makeup does

I was always blue behind the black mascara
That I cry
You could be as sweet as honey
But I knew the darkness in your mind

We were like a gorgeous bed of roses
Ready to die any minute
Getting rid of you might be the best thing I ever did

And I was seeing us in a silent movie
Taking off our gloves like a violent crime scene
Diamonds in the cut always know how to fool me
Oh honey

But I know when to run, run, run
I know when to run, run, run
I know when to run, run, run
When my makeup does
When my makeup does

And I know when to run, run, run
I know when to run, run
And I know when to run, run, run
When my makeup does
When my makeup does

And I know when to run, run, run
I know when to run, run, run
I know when to run, run
When my makeup does
When my makeup does
