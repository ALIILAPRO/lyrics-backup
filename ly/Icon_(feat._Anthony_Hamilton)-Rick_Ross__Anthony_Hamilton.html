		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Yeah, oh)
(Down here in the ghetto)
I can't see 'em running down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
(This is where dreams are made)
I can't see 'em running down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry

I just came to get the millions
I just came for the millions
Young Hov, I see you nigga
I got the Blueprint in my back pocket nigga
I did what you told me nigga
Look at me nigga, I got so much fucking money
Too many bitches, the homies could fuck 'em for me
Winning in real estate, opening restaurants
And I really don't give a fuck who rolling the next blunt
Check, real nigga born, Carol city raised
See you niggas scorn, I wasn't phased
It was a phase, look at my face
I wanna race, I set a pace
As a fat boy, I had to catch my wind
Get my laps on, double back when rappers spit
Them niggas know what's up, they throwing peace signs
Fuck that, I'm holding up an East sign
Get in my way of my money, you know what happens
Niggas finding you funny and then they clapping
Round of applause, you looking at an icon
Snatch a bottle off ice, now pour when I'm gone

One day I'm gonna be
(One day I'm gonna be)
Getting up out of these slums
Then they gonna see
(One day they gonna see me)
All that I can become
All eyes on me
(All eyes are watching)
Just a young buck tryna come up
I can be a nice one, I can be a rude one
I can be an icon
Living the life of a dreamer
Living out the life of a dreamer
Yeah

I'm very persuasive
I know a few masons
Crack dealers need me as their motivation
Started at the bottom, blind leading the blind
I did it by myself so it took me some time
No Dr. Dres, no Eminems, no Neptunes, no Timbalands
Just doing him, and I'd do it again
Self made real niggas feeling him
God forgives and I don't is what the streets said
You and I know it's on till the beef dead
Rest in peace hater, as I get a massage
No longer a Don, a fucking icon

One day I'm gonna be
(One day I'm gonna be)
A fucking Icon
Getting up out of these slums
A motherfucking Icon
Then they gonna see
(One day they gonna see me)
All that I can become
All eyes on me
(All eyes are watching)
Just a young buck tryna come up
I can be a nice one, I can be a rude one
I can be an icon
Living the life of a dreamer
Living out the life of a dreamer
Yeah

Damn you really go
Oh, this is where our dreams are made
Oh, searching for a hero
Oh, this is where success is made
Oh, down in the ghetto
Oh, this is where success is made
Oh, searching for a hero
This is where the icon
The icon, the hero, lays
