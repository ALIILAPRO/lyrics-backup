		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's TYO, yeah
And I'm balling with the (plug)
Ooh, skrrt, uh

Good gas in my blunt, she got them Yeezys on (skrrt, skrrt)
Yeah, she geekin', she know all the words to my songs (sauce)
I told plug send her packing, know the shit I'm on
I want that fire, I'm off that gas, shit, I'm all alone (yeah)
And my new chick, yeah, a model so her legs long (ooh)
Big gas in the morning, nothing could go wrong (yeah)
Is the coupe clean? (Yeah), exotic green (yeah)
Got a Tesla, I don't put no gas in it (skrrt)
And she rock designer, yeah, in all Venice
I drop racks up on my 'Gram, made my money back (racks)
And yep I hit it from the back and had her runnin' back (runnin' back, ooh)
And if I show you how to make it, can you triple that? (Sauce)
Yeah them niggas lame, ooh they talk behind your back (ooh)
The same bitches that they fuckin' listen to my raps
OG sound, yeah, uh, we're so underground (ay)
Yeah, I came up, ooh, 'cause I hold it down
Like a freak jawn, tell me what you fuckin' like
Know you see me getting money and I'm on them flights (skrrt, skrrt)
Living real good, uh, I don't need the hype, uh
I'm a good looking rapper, I'm yo' mama type (type)
And the neighbor started trippin', thought of selling drugs (ooh)
The way I got the pack and linked up with the fucking plug
See I remember when they capping, they ain't show no love (no)
And now when they pull up I hit them with the dub (skrrt, skrrt)
Versace robe on, hopping out the tub, uh-huh
Your nigga could never, he a scrub, uh-huh
They hate on me but I still show love, uh-huh
When you on the top, don't give a fuck, uh-huh

No Milwaukee but I'm runnin' up my bucks, uh-huh
Man, these niggas know I'm not the one
Really my goat, put a stick out the truck
We got gas, what you want?
My brothers got bags, he busting the juggs
He stealing my swag, but it's cool though
Bad bitch, tell her pull up to the studio
Call her to tell her we could make a move though
Really might play a nigga like some Yu-Gi-Oh
Really might play a nigga like a game
When I walk in the function they sayin' my name
I hang with the OGs, they high rank
Catch us out no ways, can't fuck with the gang
I'ma always show love 'cause I been through pain
Only rock with the day ones, you know I can't change (gang)

With the same gang I started with
We're the same gang, can't tell us apart
Yeah, that my twin you can't tell us apart
We'll kill your man and it's dearly departed
Damn, smoking a opp
I ran the racks to the tippity top
Can't serve you 'cause you look like a cop
Boy, don't ask me what's in my cup, double cup (drink, drink)
Know it's full with mighty stuff, lean crushed (drink)
You know I like my ice crushed, I just fucked his crush
I know that I left him crushed, ooh, that's tough
Ooh, yeah, take any ho your city you know that's us (that's us)
I gotta shit on you haters and that is a must (that is a must)
I have all this money for real so I'm calling your bluff (calling your bluff)
I just be fucking your bitch and you falling in love
