		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Yo Cochise, a weh dem a seh?) yeah, uh

Had to get out my feelings and get me a check
I got a chop on that boy, like a TEC
Ain't talkin' runnin, boy, I'm gettin' wet
If you coming my way, better come up correct
Uh wait, give me a second
I'm on the block, beat a check
Pushin' him out, like a peck
Got that and he sip
Uh, that boy, he talkin' a lot
I can't trust him, he cool with the opps
I go hard for my team, like a rock
Heard that boy want the smoke like it's Pop
Catch you slippin', I mop with the mop
Heard he dipped and I'm out with a lot
I've been hurtin', I'm prayin' a lot
You get scared and you callin' the cops, uh
Money elastic mr fantastic, uh
I am a addict, uh i gotta have it, yeah
That boy he movin' so goofy, huh
Hit that boy up with the two-piece, uh
Heard that boy just wanna shoot me, uh
Bitch, this real life, not a movie, uh
Stretching the bread, like I'm Luffy, uh
Spit on that beat, like a loogie, uh
Kicks on my feet, like I'm Bruce Lee, uh
Fruit of the Loom with the Ksubis, uh
Cat (Cat) , cat, cat, cat he with the cats
I'm in the back heard he a rat
Gun on my back we never lack, yeah
That boy he talkin', I don't really know
I got 40's and 20's, I shop at the store
I don't know anybody that
I I ain't talkin' 'bout Moe's
Huh, yeah, I'm finna geek
Huh, plus that's on Ehren McGhehey
Huh, I got some money this week
Huh, no you can't come in my Jeep

Yessir (yeah) , yessir (yeah) , yessir (yeah) , yessir (yeah)

I wanna cop me a Tesla i wanna cop me a, uh
