		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Roll down the window my man froze
Compose strike me a pose 
You best do dash ten toes ten toes
You don’t want to get lit by the end of this (rahh)
Roll down the window my man froze 
Compose strike me a pose
You best do dash ten toes ten toes
You don’t want to get lit by the end of this nose 

Batch got serious malis not the malis that run with the dargies
OTP got smoke for your chargie for your chargie we don’t talk to the rally 
I just spot me a Ute from far g
Now I’m trying to take shots like vardy
Opp boy pack come green like khaki
And it might be one of your dargies 

I don’t know what there on but they know what I’m in they know what I’m on so they know it’s long 
To the opps we done so much wrong
Half the s*** can’t rap on this song
On the shotty kickback come hefty
So I gotta hold strong and steady
Got murder on my mind like melly
For the opps got corn it’s Shelly 

He backed his chetty
I back my Rambo
Tryna get chetty my man ran though
Buck my man on the road of my bando
Got ducked off the road of my bando
Can’t come to my hood where I hangdo
U best be ready no time for tango
No tango when I aim for ur mango no tango when I aim for ur mango 

Got kicked out of colly 
Mum I’m sorry I’m in the bando with olly 
Pushing them packs I don’t need no trolley 
Bros ot with the white and the molly
Shipping them goods and it ain’t in a lorry
Can’t talk to hot I’m sorry give me the cash for the rest don’t worry lean In my cup come sweet with the jolly

U won’t know me like hanna Montana 
Didn’t go to school with a book or a planner
Got the tool on me no spanner
Black bandana grab on my dagger waps come plenty ain’t got few of them bro just sent me now we got 2 of them 
With the corner of my eye I’m screwing them
Any opp I see I’m shooting em 

He knows he’s pissed if I onsight my man
With my right hand jump out and fry man 
Like a sideman get hit on the sideline
Take a flight bake off in Thailand
Back wheel drive it might just skid off
Don’t dance you might get wigged off
No TikTok bro came with the big glock
Have ur name engraved on a big rock 

OTP still mopping the ends
Quick drive by we stop in your ends
Skid skrr when we take them bends
Their seeing my batch and there leaving their friends
Hence why ** got put in a Benz 
He got put in a spliff then drawed to my friends
On the toy got the clip with the fully extend
Got teeth that bite like a bully xl 

Roll down the window my man froze
Compose strike me a pose 
You best do dash ten toes ten toes
You don’t want to get lit by the end of this (rahh)
Roll down the window my man froze 
Compose strike me a pose
You best do dash ten toes ten toes
You don’t want to get lit by the end of this
