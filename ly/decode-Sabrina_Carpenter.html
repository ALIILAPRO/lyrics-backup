		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're good at the falling, not the staying there
You're good at the giving too much then getting scared
You're good at impersonating someone who cares
And you had me for a minute there

But now I wonder why
I let your confusion keep me up at night
I'm so tired
Re-read every single undertone and I

Over analyzed it
Front, back and beside it
Where else can we go?
There's nothing left here to decode
Done lookin' for signs in
The gaps and the silence
It's just getting old
There's nothing left here to decode

Mmh

There's a weight off my shoulders now that I don't chase you
Being myself, did that emasculate you?
Learning from you that I can walk away too
And you had me for a minute too

But now I wonder why
I let your indecision keep me up at night
I'm so tired
Unpacked every single word you wrote and I

Over analyzed it
Front back and beside it
Where else can we go?
There's nothing left here to decode
Done lookin' for signs in
The gaps and the silence
It's just getting old
There's nothing left here to decode

Mmh
There's nothing left here to decode
Mmh

Now I wonder why
I let your confusion keep me up at night
I'm so tired
Re-read every single undertone and I

Over analyzed it
Front, back and beside it
Where else can I go?
There's nothing left here to decode
Done lookin' for signs in
The gaps and the silence
It's just getting old
There's nothing left here to decode

There's nothing, there's nothing
There's nothing
There's nothing left here to decode
There's nothing, there's nothing
There's nothing
There's nothing left here to decode

I wanna make a video to our future selves
