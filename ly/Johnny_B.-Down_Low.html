		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Check it out
It's eleven-thirty my hand is getting dirty
Snatchin' up things that probably can't be worth it
Now this is a vision of a violent life
Livin' by a gun and totem of the night
I'm slammin' doors 2-4-5 'n pullin' the keys
Now these are the traged valuable luxuries to me
At the early dawn before you yawn
I've been there swiped you and then I'm gone
Now it's six-o-clock my heart tic-tacs
A black satin bag full of bad ass rocks
My identity has to be exposed
Stealing from the spot that I truly chosed
I lose and enfuse my choice to chose
Now I'm fix and I'm fallin' deeper in the mix
There's no hope for me see
My path has been chosen I'm Johnny be	

[CHORUS:]
Johnny be	 how much there is to see
Just open your eyes and listen to me
Straight ahead a green light turns to red
Ooh why can't you see ooh Johnny be	

[CHORUS.]
The situation's tight
You are billin' by the night
Can't choose between the wrongs and the rights
I'm searchin' for the clues yo-what am I gotta do
I got the habit to take valuable things from you
Here I stand and I'm physically trapped by my tent
Drifting northern breeze triumphal is this adman
A lonely path when I stand alone
A round mothern flexion abonded by my own
Here I lay down into certain dephts
Two spirits calls grabs my very last breath
Sometimes I wish reveseness in my path
A simple gesture or a simple laugh
But I'm evil dirty and mean
Two pounds blood pass through my bloodstream
Frightened huh you should be
Who am I I'm Johnny be	

[CHORUS.]
Here we go here we go now check the flow
Here we go Johnny be	 is in control
[REPEAT]

It's a sleepless night he's callin' your name
It's a lonely ride I know how you saw him
Again and again he's dressin' his dreams
Yeah Johnny my friend it's not what it seems

[REPEAT CHORUS TWICE]
