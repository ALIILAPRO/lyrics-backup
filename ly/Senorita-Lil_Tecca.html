Lately niggas been worried 'bout Tecca, nigga
You want me, how you gonna do better, nigga?
Bet on myself, how the fuck I'm a better, nigga?
They got me feeling like shit like I'm just a nigga
Talk about me, how the fuck I'ma let a nigga?
He took a shower, yeah, that TEC had to wet a nigga
And shawty left him, yeah, she seen I'm the better nigga
I evolve from human to gold, like caterpillar
Yeah, why you be worried about me? (Yeah)
You hit me, I leave 'em on seen (yeah)
He a junkie, he be off the codeine (yeah)
They look up to me, I'm only sixteen (yeah)
I got a TEC, it go, "Bap, bap, bap" (yeah)
They hit on my bitch and they snap and they clap (yeah)
I feel like Chris Brown, I'm on top when I dance (yeah)
She want me inside, like a crease in her pants

I'm never hot 'cause I got a lot of fans
Best fans, Tecca stans
Sold out stands, Tecca stans

I got a bad lil' eater
Don't know her, call her senorita
McDonald's, can't five star feed her (yeah)

Lately niggas been worried 'bout Tecca, nigga

He talkin' on 'Gram but, no, he can't face me
His bitch can face me, bitch can taste me
Laced the nigga, gave him rabies
Ketamine, I got lazy
