		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  These four walls keep on closing in on me
It's hard to breathe when there's no one else here to see

Friends keep calling to check I'm okay 
They don't know I've been falling for days now
These four walls keep on closing in, no release, no release

Singing
Sad songs on my own
It's hard to get high when you feel so low now
My heart needs some love
I'm crying out for some human touch now 
Now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now
I'm crying out for some human touch now

Oh, oh
I'm crying out for some human touch
Oh, oh
I'm crying out for some human touch

Been so long since I've felt someone close as you (as you)
When time stands still you're the only one pulls me through (yeah)

Friends keep calling but I'm all okay 'cause
Now you found me, yeah, I found my place
Been so long since I've felt someone close as you
Now I'm through

Singing
Sad songs on my own
It's hard to get high when you feel so low now
My heart needs some love
I'm crying out for some human touch

Singing
Sad songs on my own
It's hard to get high when you feel so low now
My heart needs some love
I'm crying out for some human touch now

Oh, oh
I'm crying out for some human touch
Oh, oh
I'm crying out for some human touch
