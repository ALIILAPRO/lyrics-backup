		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sailing the Sunset Strip, I'm a bit of a king
Granny would take a trip, I've been bending the strings
Got hammers in both my hands, such a delicate touch
They say I'm from Amsterdam, does that make me Dutch?

Please don't remember me for what I did last night, oh
Please don't remember me
Lord and children
Please don't remember me, it's only 1980
It's only 1983

Smoking the reefer, feeling my own light
My brother's a keeper, I married a TV wife
The devil's Camaro, parked in the high school lot
A little sombrero 'cause teacher was way too hot

Please don't remember me for what I did last night, oh
Please don't remember me
Listen Lord now
Please don't remember me, it's only 1980
It's only 1983

Tell my love "But leave me never"
Can't complain about the weather
Snowing at the rainbow, have a ball
Cut my teeth down at the Whiskey
GTO's tried to kiss me
One more song, they have seen it all

Please don't remember me for what I did last night, oh
Please don't remember me
What'd I say Lord?
Please don't remember me, it's only 1980
It's only 1983

Please don't remember me for what I did with David
You know I'm talkin' David Lee
Am I ready?
Please don't remember me, for what I did last night, oh
I guess I played a flying V
