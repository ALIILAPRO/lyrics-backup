		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  East of the sun and west of the moon
We'll build a dream house of love, dear
Close to the sun in the day
Near to the moon at night
We'll live in a lovely way, dear
Sharing our love in the pale moonlight

Just you and I, forever and a day
Love will not die; we'll keep it that way
Up among the stars we'll find a harmony of life to a lovely tune
East of the sun and west of the moon, dear
East of the sun and west of the moon

East of the sun and west of the moon
We'll build a dream house of love, dear
Close to the sun in the day
Near to the moon at night
We'll live in a lovely way, dear
Sharing our love in the pale moonlight

Just you and I, forever and a day
Love will not die; we'll keep it that way
Up among the stars we'll find a harmony of life to a lovely tune
East of the sun and west of the moon, dear
East of the sun and west of the moon
