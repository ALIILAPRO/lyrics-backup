		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Deeper and deeper, I'm falling in love with you
My life grows sweeter every day
There must be something in the things you do
That makes me love you in a helpless way

You're my joy, my all in all,
A fountain of love that keeps me falling

Deeper and deeper
In love with you
Each day gets sweeter and sweeter
Just being with you
I'm so in love with you

Stronger and stronger, my heart beats for you
You give me a feeling that I can't explain
And every day, you prove your love is true
You give me comfort like no one else can

You're my dream, my one desire
You're the hope that lifts me higher

I'm deeper and deeper
In love with you
Each day gets sweeter and sweeter
Just being with you

Each day gets sweeter, so much sweeter,
Just being with you
I'm falling deeper and deeper
In love with you
