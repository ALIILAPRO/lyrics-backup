		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I make money online
I make money on time
I make money online
All my niggas got me makin' money online
I make money on time
Shawty wanna fuck but I give her no time

Wanna make a mil', 9-5 weren't an option
In the field you're gonna run outta options
She always complain like she nah see me often
But often I be OT tourin'
Gyal don't worry I'll be yard in the mornin'
Use to move like I got nothin' to lose
Mixed the Off-White with the Goose
Rollin' with like 10 of the goons

Money callin', money talkin'
Trap phone goin' ring ring
Trap phone buy me bling-bling, yeah
Where was you way back then?
I was doing stick up with my bad friends
Police had us twist up on the landin'
Every other time mixed up in violence

Not just because of the buss down
But I'm on the grind 'till I'm up now
Hustle in the blood, I'm a hustler
Top striker call me Costa
And my line ringin' from qway
Trap line ringin' all day
And my line ringin' from qway
Trap line singin' all day

Wanna make a mil', 9-5 weren't an option
In the field you're gonna run outta options
She always complain like she nah see me often
But often I be OT tourin'
Gyal don't worry I'll be yard in the mornin'
Use to move like I got nothin' to lose
Mixed the Off-White with the Goose
Rollin' with like 10 of the goons

Stylish, LV drop, man I rock it with sliders
Shopping abroad first day I'm off-license
Came fresh home first thing I done, diamonds
All about timin', wrist so blindin'
Cuz she's all Boo'd up, man she got haters
We don't fly Europe, we just go Vegas
Man try draws her, she don't do strangers, fuck about status, uh
'Bout Corsa, put her in a Porshe
Eyebrow sharpish, lookin' like my borer
Come a long way from chillin' on a corner
Fat arse body, oh that's torture
I ain't getting poorer
Always complain that she can't see me often
I just keep it real, I can't run out of option
I can see you're stressed out and you keep callin'
Gyal don't worry I'll be out in the mornin'

Wanna make a mil', 9-5 weren't an option
In the field you're gonna run outta options
She always complain like she nah see me often
But often I be OT tourin'
Gyal don't worry I'll be yard in the mornin'
Use to move like I got nothin' to lose
Mixed the Off-White with the Goose
Rollin' with like 10 of the goons

Amazing, all of this money I'm making
Nights on the back roads, didn't phase me
Did it for the culture where they raised me
About to make a move
Might have to sell food
Do what she gotta do
And tell the judge, "free the goons"

With a loud pack in my loud pack
And I'm takin' it qway, plus all of the gang
Baby girl you look familiar, convo start and we wan' fi get familiar
Girl I'm a trendy yute
Lemme put you in them new Fendi shoes
Guys only hate when they wanna be you
Guys only hate when they wanna be you
I can never be you, nah nah

Wanna make a mil', 9-5 weren't an option
In the field you're gonna run outta options
She always complain like she nah see me often
But often I be OT tourin'
Gyal don't worry I'll be yard in the mornin'
Use to move like I got nothin' to lose
Mixed the Off-White with the Goose
Rollin' with like 10 of the goons

Makin' money
She said, "nigga, you don't make no time for me"
Because I trap, trap 'til the early mornin'
And now they pray on the downfall of me
You can't take my shine
This shine makin' niggas close blinds
There's no stoppin' this grind
Fuck around I'll take your bitch to the shrine
