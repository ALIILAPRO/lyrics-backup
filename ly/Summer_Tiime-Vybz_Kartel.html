		  Johnny Cool a guh love dis enuh
Pool Party
If a even the beach mi haffi reach
A summertime
Oh Oh

Every massive haffi come along
Go fi ya sun tan inna da summa sun
If ya a bleacher poppa corn
Go fi ya umbrella 'cause the sun a bun
De hot gyal dem bring it on a
In ah bikini dem in a pretty thong
Ya nuh fi shy gal bring ya come, 
If you have a fool fool man, give de bun
Portmore me come from ya noe
Pretty gal jus a pose like dominoe
And the thugs dem a rub dem down
Ya know, Inna the shade street vybz rum ya noe
Uptown full a fun ya know (Norbrook)
Ati we a go ya noe (cherry garden) 
Dream weekend a come ya know (Queensboro, Jacks Hill)
So much a ga dun ya know

Oh, oh, here we go
Summer time is here you know
It's a holiday, school is closed
We feel the vibes ya noe
Summer time in a Portmore
Summer time in a Kingston
Summer time in the country
Summer time inna my scheme

Pool party
If ah even the beach me haffi reach
Ah summer time

90 degrees inna the shade, temperature tun up
Whitey ah tan till skin bun up
Black gal ah rub till vein come up
Tattoo time, coloring book tun up
Man ah roll out bicycle, bike ya noe see it
Man ah roll out car and the truck and the jeep
Me wan foot thugs dem strolling up
Grab a gal by the hand start rolling up
Party ah go all night long all thru the day
Me jus' see a pretty gyal gone with Deniro & TJ

Oh, oh, here we go
Summer time is here you know
It's a holiday, school is closed
We feel the vibes ya noe
Summer time in a Portmore
Summer time in a Kingston
Summer time in the country
Summer time inna my scheme

Pool party
If ah even the beach me haffi reach
Ah summer time

Oh, oh, here we go
Summer time is here you know
It's a holiday, school is closed
We feel the vibes ya noe
Summer time in a Portmore
Summer time in a Kingston
Summer time in the country
Summer time inna my scheme
