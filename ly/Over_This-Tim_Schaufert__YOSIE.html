		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I remember every word you said to me
I can hear them on repeat
I regret the things I never dared to say
So I text them, did you read them baby
Oh why do you keep coming back
Oh why can’t I let go
And I thought we were over this
And I thought we could handle it
Mhh
And I thought you were over this
And I thought we could deal with it
Mhh
And I thought you are better off
That you fell out of our love
And you said that we’re better off
But we’re still not over this love
I’m replaying every moment in my head
Will that help me to regret
Every way I touched and held onto your body
Let me go, let it be
Oh why do you keep coming back
Oh why can’t I let go
And I thought we were over this
And I thought we could handle it
Mhh
And I thought you were over this
And I thought we could deal with it
Mhh
You know you’re my favorite one
I know you can’t wait for some thing
To change
You know you’re my favorite one
I know you can’t wait for some thing
To change
Over this
Over this
And I thought we were over this
