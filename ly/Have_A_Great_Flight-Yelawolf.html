		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Where's my calling angel?
At the coffin
Where's my blue sky?
At the coffin
A pretty bouquet and a red rose
At the coffin
Darling, don't cry
At the coffin
Over my soul

I will take your favorite books
And put them in a row
I remember how you like them
I know where they go
Your mama will be waiting there
For you to hold
I know that she misses you
Misses you so

So have a great flight
Have a great flight outta here, I suppose
I know you raised me right
But you must go, I suppose

Have a great flight
Have a great flight outta here, I suppose
I know you raised me right
But you must go, I suppose

I will keep the memories
That always make me smile
But letting you go honestly
I'm having a tough time
But I promise I'll be strong for you, like you said
And hold it in the road
But I'll be down here missing you
Missing you so

So have a great flight
Have a great flight outta here, I suppose
You know you raised me right
But you must go, I suppose

And nothing ever did feel so real but this time
My time, my mind is gone, turn the lights back on
Baby I'm in the next room but is it gonna be long
'Til I see you again

And nothing ever did feel so real but this time
My time, my mind is gone, turn the lights back on
Baby I'm in the next room but is it gonna be long
'Til I see you again

And nothing ever did feel so real but this time
My time, my mind is gone, turn the lights back on
Baby I'm in the next room but is it gonna be long
'Til I see you again

And nothing ever did feel so real but this time
My time, my mind is gone, turn the lights back on
Baby I'm in the next room but is it gonna be long
'Til I see you again

And nothing ever did feel so real but this time
My time, my mind is gone, turn the lights back on
Baby I'm in the next room but is it gonna be long
'Til I see you again

And nothing ever did feel so real but this time
My time, my mind is gone, turn the lights back on
Baby I'm in the next room but is it gonna be long
'Til I see you again

And nothing ever did feel so real but this time
My time, my mind is gone, turn the lights back on
Baby I'm in the next room but is it gonna be long
'Til I see you again

And nothing ever did feel so real but this time
My time, my mind is gone, turn the lights back on
Baby I'm in the next room but is it gonna be long
'Til I see you again
