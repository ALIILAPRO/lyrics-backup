		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell, me should a real nigga feel this way?
'Cause I've been already gone, baby
Smokin' and I'm drinkin' strong, baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah)

I try to play numb to shit like this
But I'm cool, 'cause this isn't love (yeah, yeah, yeah)
We all have obsessions
Oh, sometimes, sometimes 

'Cause when I'm on the road, I be on the road (check it)
I mean you can hold me down, but I'm not to hold (we flexin')
Ridin' with my niggas we the ones they chose
Runnin' through the city like, "I know you know" (yeah)
Yeah, my name is PARTY and the trigger finger function (yeah)
Silly nigga might lose his life on assumption (yeah, yeah)
Young nigga from the city
Ain't shit pretty, but my bitch and my mama
Anyone can get the drama (The Dalai Lama)
Strippers in the club and my cup's half empty (I know you wanna)

Ridin' with my niggas, 'cause my niggas understand me
Still on plan A, pussy niggas on plan B
Just a young rich nigga, you don't have to understand me forever (yeah)
'Cause when I'm on the road, I be on the road (check it)
I mean you can hold me down, but I'm not to hold (we flexin')
Ridin' with my niggas we the ones they chose
Runnin' through the city like, "I know you know" (yeah)
Yeah, my name is PARTY and the trigger finger function (yeah)
Silly nigga might lose his life on assumption (yeah, yeah)
Young nigga from the city
Ain't shit pretty but my bitch and my mama
Anyone can get the drama (The Dalai Lama)

Strippers in the club and my cup's half empty (I know you wanna)
Ridin' with my niggas, 'cause my niggas understand me
Still on plan A, pussy niggas on plan B
Just a young rich nigga, you don't have to understand me forever (yeah)

(Ooh, yeah) 
Forever (yeah)
Baby, can you hear that?
This story that you goin' with tonight
You gone tell that shit for life
I don't want it just tonight, I want forever (yeah, yeah)
I don't only want that shit tonight, I want that shit forever (yeah, yeah)
You can make the story better, make it last forever 
I ain't only wanna fuck tonight, baby, it's whatever (yeah, yeah, yeah)

Tell me baby if I fuck you right, can I fuck forever?
Tell me, should a real nigga feel this way?
Tell me, doesn't anyone feel this way?
I be in my feelings as of late, okay
Tell me, should a real nigga feel this way?
Let me know when he gone, baby
Smokin' and I'm drinkin' strong, baby
Leanin' and I'm livin' long, baby
'Cause niggas only singin' songs, baby
I'm true to you, I'm true to these words
Baby, get it through to you
How I'm gettin' through 'cause I'm concerned, baby
Is it true to you? How's it feel with me?
Thug story that you goin' with tonight
You gon' tell that shit for life
I don't want it just tonight, I want forever

Strippers in the club and my cup's half empty
You know I'm ridin' with my niggas, 'cause my niggas understand me
You know I'm still on plan A, pussy niggas on plan B
And I'm just a young rich nigga, you don't have to understand me forever (party life)
