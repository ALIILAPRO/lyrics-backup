		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Make a wish,
Make it hurt,
With my hand,
Up your skirt, tonight!

Signal-directional,
Institute-correctional,
File me alphabetical,
Ha-ha-ha-hypothetical

[Chorus]
It's animal, it's animal,
It's animal, unbelievable, woo!
It's animal, it's animal,
It's animal, unbelievable, woo!
It's animal, it's animal,
It's animal, un-buh-leev-uh...bull!
Tonight

Signal-directional,
Institute-correctional,
File it alphabetical,
Ha-ha-hypothetical,
With my guns,
On the floor,
And the fans,
At the door, tonight!

Signal-directional,
Institute-correctional,
File it alphabetical,
Ha-ha-hypothetical

[Chorus]

Oh no, not me!
Pissed off, ripped off, repeat (tonight)
Oh no, not me!
What's my excuse this time? 
Suffer it

Unbelievable, woo!
It's animal, it's animal,
It's animal, unbelievable,
It's animal, it's animal,
It's animal, un-buh-leev-a bull!
Tonight

Signal-directional,
Institute-correctional,
File it alphabetical,
Ha-ha-hypothetical, (tonight)
Fuckin' incredible,
Non-conceptual,
I be the medical drug,
The theoretical
Tonight!
