		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Give it a rest and then try it again with more soul
Until you learn that clearing your heads'
The same as losing control in this space
Don't let it drive you crazy
Don't let it drive you insane there's no point
Because you just keep turning us on and turning us off
And on and off and on
Until we're light as a feather and we're stiff as a board
Light as a feather and we're stiff as a board
Give it a break cause if you try it again you'll get bored
Because you don't really know where it starts
But you know that it ends with no friends
Cause even this is a test and I'm sorry if it breaks your bubble
But you still need some rest because it's gonna go
It's gonna go
On and on and on, on and on and on, on and on and on
Until it hurts
We will go
On and on and on, on and on and on, on and and on
Until it hurts

keep turning us on, and turning us off
You keep turning us on and turning us off (x5)
