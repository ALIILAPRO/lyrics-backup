		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you want me too
We can do it all night
No one else will do
Like it was the first time

You, got me feeling something, it's true
You
You, get me feeling more than I knew
You

If you want me too
We can do it all night, like it was the first time
No one else will do
We can do it all night, like it was the first time

You, got me feeling something, it's true
You
You, get me feeling more than I knew
We can do it all night, like it was the first time

Like it was the first time

We can do it all night
Like it was the first time

If you want me too
We can do it all night
No one else will do
Like it was the first time

You, got me feeling something, it's true
You
You, get me feeling more than I knew
We can do it all night, like it was the first time

Like it was the first time

We can do it all night, like it was the first time

You, got me feeling something, it's true
You

If you want me too
We can do it all night, like it was the first time
No one else will do
We can do it all night, like it was the first time

Like it was the first time

We can do it all night, like it was the first time

No one else will do
We can do it all night, like it was the first time
