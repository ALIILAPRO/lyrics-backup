		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I never fear that I’m gonna’ lose ya
Not like those guys you was fuckin’ with
It’s not the pride that’s just how I’ve been
I ain’t no saint see I too have sinned
Lot of friction you’re cutting close now
Bad eye shit is cut throat now
Told you straight it ain’t one of those now
If I leave it’ll be set in stone
Truth is I’ve been, hurting inside
Wanna’ give my all to you but I'm tied
I know you’ve opened your heart to mine
I’m also restless in ways I can’t describe
Meet me in the middle
Meet me at that place
Leave your temperaments on hold or else we’ll fade
Meet me in the middle
Meet me at that place
Heaven knows how much I’ve given for our sake
Why you holdin’ back from me like we ain’t been through something
Causing issues being pretentious with your new intensions
When I walk out on your bullshit you think I'm just bluffing
Till’ you feel it in that spot in your heart you’ll start tripping
I know you’re not accustomed to this
You’re just built to make excuses
Can’t you stop hurting yourself myself no more
Meet me in the middle
Meet me at that place
Leave your temperaments on hold or else we’ll fade
Meet me in the middle
Meet me at that place
Heaven knows how much I’ve given for our sake
