		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Written in these walls are the stories that I can't explain
I leave my heart open but it stays right here empty for days

She told me in the morning
She don't feel the same about us in her bones
It seems to me that when I die
These words will be written on my stone

And I'll be gone, gone tonight
The ground beneath my feet is open wide
The way that I've been holdin' on too tight
With nothing in between

The story of my life, I take her home
I drive all night to keep her warm and time
Is frozen (the story of, the story of)
The story of my life, I give her hope
I spend her love until she's broke, inside
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)

Written on these walls are
The colors that I can't change
Leave my heart open
But it stays right here in it's cage

I know that in the morning now
I see us in the light upon a hill
Although I am broken, my heart is untamed, still

And I'll be gone, gone tonight
The fire beneath my feet is burning bright
The way that I've been holdin' on so tight
With nothing in between

The story of my life, I'll take her home
I drive all night to keep her warm and time
Is frozen (the story of, the story of)
The story of my life, I give her hope
I spend her love until she's broke, inside
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)

And I've been waiting for this time to come around
But baby running after you is like chasing the clouds

The story of my life
I take her home
I drive all night
To keep her warm and time
Is frozen

The story of my life I give her hope (give her hope)
I spend her love until she's broke (until she's broke inside)
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)

The story of my life
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)
The story of my life
