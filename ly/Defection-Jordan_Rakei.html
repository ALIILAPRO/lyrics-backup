		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Gold survives the fire
You curse it with your charm
I keep you underneath my arm
I owe you peace of mind
I'll keep you safe from harm
No reason to sound the alarms

The blessing of the saint
He cursed you with his soul
And now it seems you've lost control
And though a different age
It still lies in the soil
In time to quantify

Ooh, the wheel it keeps on turning
While the world around us keeps on burning

You see the moon and stars
Though we heavily fall apart
I was hoping to leave this for a brighter star
But now with you as my witness
Let's set off to the stars
Hope that we find the special place within our hearts

Gold survives the rain
Under the oath I swear
It's taken time for me to care
But blessed it is the name
Of yours I take to bear
I watch your soul slowly appear

Ooh, the wheel it keeps on turning
While the world around us keeps on burning

You see the moon and stars
Though we heavily fall apart
I was hoping to leave this for a brighter star
But now with you as my witness

Let's set off to the stars
Hope that we find the special place
Within our hearts
Within our hearts

Ooh, the wheel it keeps on turning
While the world around just keeps on burning
Ooh, the wheel it keeps on turning
While the world around just keeps on burning

You see the moon and stars
Though we heavily fall apart
I was hoping to leave this for a brighter star
But now with you as my witness
Let's set off to the stars
Hope that we find the special place within our hearts
