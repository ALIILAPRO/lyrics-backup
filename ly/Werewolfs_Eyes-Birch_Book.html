		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When the full moon bathes the meadow in its bright and silky dress
Why do I feel depressed my love?
When the curtains wave their shadows across your white and milky breast
Why do I feel unrest, my love?
Do the hollows of the night prepare in me this fright of our parting?

Then at the break of day, my love, where have you gone away
With not one word to say of goodbye?
Why would you not have stayed, my love, oh say you're not afraid
Of the promise that we made, 
Oh why do the willows in the wind run shivers down my skin of sorrow?

I have gone to where the wind may not blow upon my skin
Where the stars may not shine upon my name
I shall soon enough return to where I long and I yearn
And I swear that I will be the same

Do the leaves in the trees still whisper in the breeze "Where are you?"

I have gone to face the beast and to drivel at his feast
May the two of us never be seen
And my love, may you sleep as the ocean fall deep
And I swear I won't tell you where I've been

Sunset is upon me now, and evening's drawing near
And still you are not here, my love
I thought you called my name so clear, but howls are all I hear
They are not yours my dear, my love

Yet that shadow in disguise who stares through werewolf's eyes, who are you?

You must not be afraid of the changes that I've made
I have come now to bring you away
To our bed that I have made with the seven stones I've laid
And covered in the finest of clay

Lay your head upon the ground, you shall never be found
I will guard against dangers that be
Until dawn comes around you must not make a sound
And I swear you will forever be with me
And I swear you will forever be with me
