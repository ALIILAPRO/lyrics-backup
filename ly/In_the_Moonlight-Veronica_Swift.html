		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wrote you a love song on one sunny day
You said I could do you no wrong, but then you turned me away
You were all I ever wanted - and no one else will do
Now I lay my head on my lonely bed just thinking of you

Is there something more I'm living for?
Tell me what's in store if I open this door
Will you make me yours?  Cause we've been here before in the moonlight 

I could weigh down the sky with the burdens that I bear
I could tell the truth 1000 times, oh, but you don't seem to care
And if there is but a moment that you should feel alone
There's no need to hide, I'll run to your side and I'll bring you back home

Is there something else you might have felt? 
Tell me what is this spell that has cast me to Hell?
Oh it's so hard to tell now I'm by myself in the moonlight

Over and over and over again
You were my one and only friend
Tell me, could this be the end?  
Why couldn't we just pretend?
That everything's alright - that we never had to fight
Oh, tell me honey, what can I do to make it right?
Cause I can't take it, I can't make it through the night without you
In the moonlight

And even though I wanna hate you these feelings all feel the same
It's a sign from above that my only love will forever bear your name

Is there something I can do to try?
Tell me why, oh why, do you deny this love of mine?
Cause you know I'd rather die than to hear you say goodbye in the moonlight
