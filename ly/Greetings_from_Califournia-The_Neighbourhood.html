		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh, I know once you come to California
You will never look back
Ooh, just a little bit can make you wonder
You got it in

Hands up it's a stick up
Nobody's leaving this room for a minute
Everyones breathing these fumes
That are in it
Sick of the people who make the decisions

Put your hands up it's a stick up
Hopefully God is still down to forgive us
Nobody's breathing
Who let the evil in?

What's in the water?
Are you bothered?
What's the problem here?

Ooh, I know once you come to California
You will never look back
Ooh, just a little bit can make you wonder
You got it in

I can feel it go down
I will feel it go down all the way
All the way
Give it to me slow now
Give it to me slow then wash away
It comes and comes

Ooh, I know once you come to California
You will never look back
Ooh, just a little bit can make you wonder

Handcuffed and I thought of you
I made love and I thought of you
My daddy died, I just thought of you
My sister cried and my mama too
I got a place and I thought of you
I tried to decorate and I thought of you
I'm seeing red but I'm singing blue
I never knew that black and white would fit you too

Anybody, somebody, please
I'm begging
I'm even on my knees
I've got a dozen insecurities
But I don't think you should be worried for me
No I don't think you should be worried for me

Ooh, I know once you come to California
You will never look back
Ooh, just a little bit can make you wonder
You got it in
