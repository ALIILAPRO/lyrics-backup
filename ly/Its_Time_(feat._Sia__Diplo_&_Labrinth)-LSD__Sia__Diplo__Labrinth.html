		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The roses on Valentine's
Oh, those lying on great vines
Your love washes over me like cheap red wine
But you feel [?] they leave me dry
I live on a broken Earth
Screamin' boy you shot me first
Your blood washes over me like cheap red wine
Your words are like bullets, leave me to die

When you don't love me
When you don't need me
When you don't want me
Darlin', it's time
When you don't love me
When you don't need me
When you don't want me
Darlin', it's time

Won't stay when I'm not welcomed
Swarms in and I have been stung
Your love washes over me like gin and lime
Your words are so cold, leave me with frostbite
Do I need truth or healing? (Get up)
Down your neck, I'm breathing (get up)
I need to feel needed (get up)
This doesn't justify, yeah

When you don't love me (when you don't love me)
When you don't need me (when you don't need me)
When you don't want me (when you don't want me)
Darlin', it's time (darlin', it's time)
When you don't love me (when you don't love)
When you don't need me (oh)
When you don't want me
Darlin' it's time
