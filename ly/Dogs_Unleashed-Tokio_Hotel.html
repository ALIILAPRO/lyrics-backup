		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't wanna run on your command
Don't wanna keep on coming back
Don't wanna swallow all your lies
Wanna feel alive.

Don't wanna hold on to your truth
Don't wanna keep on loving you
Don't wanna look through jaded eyes
Wanna feel alive.

We are dogs unleashed (You and I)
We are dogs unleashed (You and I)
We are dogs unleashed, out of control
Full of dreams nobody knows
Unleashed, dying to escape
We don't wanna suffocate
We are dogs unleashed
We are dogs unleashed
We are dogs unleashed
Tonight, tonight.

We gonna scratch, We gonna bite
We turn your game into a fight
We're howling to the moon and night
Tonight.

We are dogs unleashed (You and I)
We are dogs unleashed (You and I)
We are dogs unleashed, Out of control
Full of dreams nobody knows
Unleashed, dying to escape
We don't wanna suffocate
We are dogs unleashed
We are dogs unleashed
We are dogs unleashed.

Touch me, Treat me
Love me, Feed me
Touch me, Treat me
Love me, Feed me
Touch me, Treat me 
Love me, Feed me. 

Tonight, We are dogs unleashed
Out of control
Full of dreams nobody knows
Unleashed, dying to escape
We don't wanna suffocate
We are dogs unleashed (Save me)
We are dogs unleashed (Save me)
We are dogs unleashed
Tonight, tonight.
