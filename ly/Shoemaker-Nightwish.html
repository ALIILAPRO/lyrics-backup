		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now you`ve been tucked in
For eternal earthrise and wonder
A sailor through aeons
Story unheard
Howling at the Earth
Yours the whole graveyard of heavens
A ship that sailed home

You`re with us, face of the night
Singing through the morn for mankind
I want to sing with you
You`re home now, outward urge
As with every dreaming creature
We want to come with you

Here I came to be
Your reach into the far
On the stellar sea
Cut in little stars

We all wait the due night
Beauty which is worth the hurting
We`re coming to join you
Hope revived for a lifetime
To rekindle the human spark
In love with the night

Now you`ve been tucked in
For eternal earthrise and wonder
A sailor through aeons
Story now heard
Howling at the Earth
Yours is the whole starmap of heavens
Of myriad endings

We came here to be
A waypoint to the far
On the stellar sea
Cut into little
Stars calling with the sound
Of a dreamlike dulcimer
We came here to stay
With your guiding light


“And when he shall die
Take him and cut him out in little stars
And he will make the face of heaven so fine
That all the world
Will be in love with the night
And pay no worship to the garish sun”

- W. Shakespeare / Romeo And Juliet
