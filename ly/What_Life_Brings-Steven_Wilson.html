		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Were you standing in the haze?
The oscillating sunset fades 
In the autumn past
Knowing it won't last
Gone but that's just too bad
'Cause that's what life brings

Were you a bird that fell to earth
Or just a tremor in my nerves
That will soon pass on?
When the shadows grow long
There's no need to be strong
When you're lost in dream fog

Were you standing in the haze?
The oscillating sunset fades
In the autumn past 
(Soon pass)
Knowing it won't last
(Won't last)
Gone but that's just too bad
'Cause that's what life brings

Love it all
Love it all and hold it in your hands
Love it all (love it all, love it all)
Love it all and hold it in your hands
Love it all (love it all, love it all)
Love it all, yeah, and hold it in your hands
