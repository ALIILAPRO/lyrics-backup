		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I see the place that we belong together, together
Like we were something more
And it felt like maybe we could last forever, forever
But you led them to our hideout
Forced their way inside now
They want us to surrender, us to surrender

But I could go all night
Right here between their crossfire
We'll send them up a message, 
I'll send a message saying
Give it up give it up

We've got no place to go
Caught up in a rodeo
Oh no please god tell me we're dreaming
We've got nowhere to run
They've all got loaded guns
Oh no please god tell me we're dreaming
Oh oh oh, Ah ah ah
Please God tell me we're dreaming

Wait for the dust to settle down around us, Around us
And stick to what we know
I think the air is finally safe to breathe again, To breathe again
The world is in your palm now
So take a breath and calm down
Cause you have been selected
You've been selected

A few will ever find out 
and If you don't see why
Well At least you got your nest egg
You've got your nest egg
So live it up, Live it up

We've got no place to go
Caught up in a rodeo
Oh no please god tell me we're dreaming
We've got nowhere to run
They've all got loaded guns
Oh no please god tell me we're dreaming
Oh oh oh, Ah ah ah
Please God tell me we're dreaming
Oh oh oh, Ah ah ah
Please God tell me we're dreaming

Well then give it up give it up

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

But you led them to our hideout
Forced their way inside now
They want us to surrender, us to surrender

But I could go all night 
right here between their crossfire
We'll send them up a message, 
I'll send a message saying
Give it up give it up

We've got no place to go
Caught up in a rodeo
Oh no please god tell me we're dreaming
We've got no where to run
They've all got loaded guns
Oh no please god tell me we're dreaming
Oh oh oh, Ah ah ah
Please God tell me we're dreaming
Oh oh oh, Ah ah ah
Please God tell me we're dreaming
