		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tugged the moon into the ground
Turned this bedroom upside down tonight
Took my faith and I breathed it out
Then walked right through a cloud of flashing lights, bright lies.

Pain takes my heart's place
The love we made, we cant erase it, don't wanna face it

Pitter pat, the angel on my shoulder
Is haunting me tonight
Tick tock, the clock is getting louder
Ready for me to decide

I've lost my sense of right and wrong
Well-justified my soul to carry on
It feels so damn good to write off the rules
But when a new day breaks, I'm left a fool I'm such a fool

Pain takes my heart's place
But your sweet sweet love,
Oh I can taste it but still can't face it

Pitter pat, the angel on my shoulder
Is haunting me tonight
Tick tock the clock is getting louder
Ready for me to decide
Come on angel (Repeat x2)

The sun is coming down on me
Could fate be so unkind?

Pain takes my heart's place
The love we made remains
