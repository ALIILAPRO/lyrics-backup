		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Waking is painful!
Dismiss the program, identify your enemy
You´re not of interested in your well-being
Taking advantage, destroy, control
Pushing your boundaries, heads will roll

How will you pay what you ignore today?

We are headed at last to the destination
Will you choose freedom or throw it away?
We’ve come so far from where we started - where we started
And the destination can open your mind or make you a slave
Only you can set you free

Last to the table!
Pieces of silver, fill up your belly, lick your plate clean
They have to understand that they needs to release
To keep freedom
The choice is ours, what do you say?

How will you pay what you ignore today?

We are headed at last to the destination
Will you choose freedom or throw it away?
We’ve come so far from where we started - where we started
And the destination can open your mind or make you a slave
Only you can set you free

Barely surviving, simply existing this thing, you call life?
Painfully clear Tongue, it can’t talk while you’re taking a walk on the edge of a knife - on the edge
of a knife

Painfully clear
It’s shameful! It’s shameful!
How will you pay? How will you pay? How will you pay?

We are headed at last to the destination
Will you choose freedom or throw it away?
We’ve come so far from where we started
