		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All the lonely nights are full of shadows. Cause you went away.
I walk alone a million miles.
And I nearly died cause my lucky star is gonna fade to gray.
I feel alone a million times.
And you push me down
on the floor.

Show me the way back away from the past.
Back to the future. The way out of the dark.
Show me the way and how long it might last.
I'll keep on searching the door to you heart.
Anywhere you go, I'll be waiting for you.
Anywhere you stay. I will build up a dream.
A life toned of love made of thousands of stars.
Don't let me live in the past.

We're running fast and playing our games. Faster all the time.
You're such a mystery to me.
And the wind that blows becomes a storm. Gonna make me lose my mind.
You're full of sensuality.
Oh I want you here
by my side.

Show me the way back away from the past.
Back to the future. The way out of the dark.
Show me the way and how long it might last.
I'll keep on searching the door to you heart.
Anywhere you go, I'll be waiting for you.
Anywhere you stay. I will build up a dream.
A life toned of love made of thousands of stars.
Don't let me live in the past.

Oh I want you here
by my side

Show me the way back away from the past.
Back to the future. The way out of the dark.
Show me the way and how long it might last.
I'll keep on searching the door to you heart.
Anywhere you go, I'll be waiting for you.
Anywhere you stay. I will build up a dream.
A life toned of love made of thousands of stars.
Don't let me live in the past.

Show me the way back away from the past.
Back to the future. The way out of the dark.
Show me the way and how long it might last.
I'll keep on searching the door to you heart.
