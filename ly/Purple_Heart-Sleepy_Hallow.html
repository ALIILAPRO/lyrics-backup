		<p>
		  Great John on the beat by the way

Ayy, I should have a purple heart for all the shit I been through
I love you 'cause you different, that's the type of shit I'm into
Lil' bro get to drawin' weapons, he don't need a pencil
Baby, I'm a one of one, know I'm too official
Uh, baby, I got issues
Swear this shit been fuckin' with my mental, uh
I can't tell nobody if I miss you, uh
Please, don't tell nobody if I kiss you
If I, uh

Wipe my tears with money, fuck a tissue, uh
I can't walk with you, they say you ran through, uh
Bad vibes put me in a bad mood, uh
Mob ties, I be with the gang too, uh
How he Supa Crip, he leavin' bitches on read? Uh
I feel like Lil Uzi, all my friends dead
And I can't get you out my head
No, I can't get you out my head
That's the money callin'
And we don't make mistakes, we makin' money often
They only care about you when you in a coffin
Or when you up in jail, I hope my bro get bail
I'm screamin', "Free my dawgs and R.I.P. who not here"

Ayy, I should have a purple heart for all the shit I been through
I love you 'cause you different, that's the type of shit I'm into
Lil' bro get to drawin' weapons, he don't need a pencil
Baby, I'm a one of one, know I'm too official
Uh, baby, I got issues
Swear this shit been fuckin' with my mental, uh
I can't tell nobody if I miss you, uh
Please, don't tell nobody if I kiss you
If I
