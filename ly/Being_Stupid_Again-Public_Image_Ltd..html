		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh no
You're being stupid again
Well done
It's the students again
So sloganed again
Verbatim again
You're being students again
Oh no

Ban the bomb
Save the whale
Give peace a chance

You're being sponges again
You're being minges again
Full to the brim
All Marx and Lenin again
Oh no

Pretending again
You're being students again
Being stupid again
Well done, it's students again

Ban the bomb
Save the whale
Give peace a chance

Men into women
And back into men
Again and again
All banning all men
You're being stupid again
Happy hippy drippy shit
You're being students again

All maths is racist
Pretending again
Passive-aggressive
Again and again
All accepters are deads
You're all stupid again
All stupid again

Well, here's a question again
Does that make me racist again?

How much money for that education?
I'm not paying for that
I'm not gonna be stupid again

Ban the bomb
Save the whale
Give peace a chance
