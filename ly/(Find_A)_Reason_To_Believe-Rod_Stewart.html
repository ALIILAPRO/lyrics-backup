		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I listened long enough to you
I'd find a way to believe that it's all true
Knowing that you lied, straight-faced while I cried
Still I look to find a reason to believe

Someone like you makes it hard to live without
Somebody else
Someone like you makes it easy to give
Never think about myself

If I gave you time to change my mind
I'd find a way just to leave the past behind
Knowing that you lied, straight-faced while I cried
Still I look to find a reason to believe

If I listened long enough to you
I'd find a way to believe that it's all true
Knowing that you lied, straight-faced while I cried
Still I look to find a reason to believe

Someone like you makes it hard to live without
Somebody else
Someone like you makes it easy to give
Never think about myself

Someone like you makes it hard to live without
Somebody else
Someone like you makes it easy to give
Never think about myself, woo

Someone like you makes it hard to live without
Somebody else
Someone like you makes it easy to give
Never think about myself

Someone like you makes it hard to live without
Somebody else
