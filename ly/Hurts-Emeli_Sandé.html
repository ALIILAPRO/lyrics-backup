		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby, I'm not made of stone, it hurts
Loving you the way I do, it hurts

Hold tight, it's a sing-along
I'm alright, I'm alright, but I could be wrong, baby
I know you remember me
'53 in the back of the lavory, come on
You could at least try and look at me
Oh man, oh man, what a tragedy, haha
Bang, bang, there goes paradise
I chill why we always had to roll the dice, la la
Heartbeat in the regular
Two seats in the back of the cinema, hazy
Ah yeah, you're forgettin' it
And all the mad shit we did after that, crazy
Your heart, come on, baby
I swear you're giving me shivers, shivers

Baby, I'm not made of stone, it hurts
Loving you the way I do, it hurts
When all that's left to do is watch it burn
Oh baby, I'm not made of stone, it hurts

Hold on, it's a marathon
Run fast, run fast like the rivers run, goddamn
Never seen in the restaurant
I took a minute till the penny dropped, you know
My tears don't fall too often
But your knife is cuttin' me deep
Deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep

Baby, I'm not made of stone, it hurts yeah
Loving you the way I do, it hurts
When all that's left to do is watch it burn
Oh yeah yeah baby, I'm not made of stone, it hurts

It hurts the way that you pretend you don't remember
It hurts the way that you forget our times together
Like the time laid in bed when you said it's forever, baby
I can't, I can't explain no more

Baby, I'm not made of stone, it hurts
Loving you the way I do, it hurts
When all that's left to do is watch it burn
Oh baby, I'm not made of stone, it hurts

Oh baby, I'm not made of stone, it hurts
And loving you the way I do, it hurts
