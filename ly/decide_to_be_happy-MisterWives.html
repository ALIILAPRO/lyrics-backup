		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Music it saved me
But it drives me crazy
'Cause it forces my eyes to take a look and see
Got to decide to be happy
'Cause it don't always come naturally
Been feelin' like a stranger in my body
I haven't been myself in a while, I'm sorry
Got to decide to be happy
'Cause it don't always come naturally

'Cause flowers don't grow without the rain
And goodness don't grow without the pain
Flowers don't grow without the rain
Goodness don't grow without the pain

I've been down on my knees
Prayin' for things I don't believe
Hopin' that it'll save me
So I decide to be happy
I've been down on my knees
Prayin' for things I don't believe
Hopin' that it'll save me
So I decide to be happy
(So I decide to be happy)

My mind it can be a scary place at times
So I hide under my bed and close all the blinds
And I cry and I cry
Waste the day away so I turn on the lights
And I search for a sign or a rhyme or a reason
Why I'm unsteady as the seasons?

'Cause flowers don't grow without the rain
And goodness don't grow without the pain
Flowers don't grow without the rain
Goodness don't grow without the pain

I've been down on my knees
Prayin' for things I don't believe
Hopin' that it'll save me
So I decide to be happy
I've been down on my knees
Prayin' for things I don't believe
Hopin' that it'll save me
So I decide to be happy
(So I decide to be happy)

If you're happy and you know it, clap your hands
If you're sad and you know it, well now's your chance to dance
If you're happy and you know it, clap your hands
If you're sad and you know it, well now's your chance to dance
Well now's your chance to dance, now's your chance to dance (now's your chance to dance)

I've been down on my knees
Prayin' for things I don't believe
Hopin' that it'll save me
So I decide to be happy
I've been down on my knees
Prayin' for things I don't believe
Hopin' that it'll save me
So I decide to be happy
