		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Said play with my pussy
But don't play with my emotions (emotions)
If you spend some money
Then maybe I just might fuck ya (fuck ya)
When I shake that ass
I'ma do that shit in slow motion (motion)
You got a whole lotta cash
And, nigga, you know I want it (want it)
Play with my pussy
But don't play with my emotions (emotions, yeah)
If you spend some money
Then maybe I just might fuck ya (fuck ya, yeah, yeah)
When I shake that ass
I'ma do that shit in slow motion (motion, slow motion, yeah)
You got a whole lotta cash
And, nigga, you know I want it (you know I want it)

Break some bread up, nigga, that butter my biscuit (ha)
You ain't talk money, then really, that's none of my business (that's none of my biz)
I don't even need these lenses (yeah)
20 on 20 my vision (woo)
Bad yellow bitch with her eye on the prize
But nigga, I ain't no minion (yeah, yeah)
Millions, thousands, billions (trillions)
Bobs on me like Dylan, blondes on me like Hilton
Wendys on me like Williams, shouting, digging
Look at me like I'm alien
Bitch, I'm fucking reptilian
Bitch, bitch, ah
All y'all bitches was wrong
Talkin' 'bout I fell off (off)
You ain't even get on (on)
Bitch, bitch, yeah (yeah)
All y'all bitches is precious (yeah)
Wait, I meant to say jealous (jealous)
All y'all bitches is jealous (jealous)
Bitch, bitch

Said play with my pussy
But don't play with my emotions (emotions)
If you spend some money
Then maybe I just might fuck ya (fuck ya)
When I shake that ass
I'ma do that shit in slow motion (motion)
You got a whole lotta cash
And, nigga, you know I want it (want it)
Play with my pussy
But don't play with my emotions (emotions, yeah)
If you spend some money
Then maybe I just might fuck ya (fuck ya, yeah, yeah)
When I shake that ass
I'ma do that shit in slow motion (motion, slow motion, yeah)
You got a whole lotta cash
And, nigga, you know I want it

(And now you playin' with my emotions)
Nigga, don't do it, you blew it
You tryna cast spells on a bitch with potions
Nigga, I need devotion (devotion)
(I'm leaving you with that lotion)
Telling me this and that, the third
That shit for the birds, I'm ghosting
If you don't dive in that pussy like dolphins
If you don't dive in that pussy like oceans
Twins look identically like Olsens
Nigga, don't hide from the pussy, be open
Nigga, wanna spy-on the pussy like Austin
(Do I make you horny, baby?)
That's my ego that you stroking
Nigga, don't laugh 'cause the pussy ain't joking
Nigga, don't splash when the pussy be soaking (yeah)
Where that nigga who don't play mind games at?
You got a fake gold chain on, change that
Try to spit game while I'm on my way out, laters
Where that nigga, man? Where he at? Where he at?

Said play with my pussy
But don't play with my emotions (emotions)
If you spend some money
Then maybe I just might fuck ya (fuck ya)
When I shake that ass
I'ma do that shit in slow motion (motion)
You got a whole lotta cash
And, nigga, you know I want it (want it)
Play with my pussy
But don't play with my emotions (emotions, yeah)
If you spend some money
Then maybe I just might fuck ya (fuck ya, yeah, yeah)
When I shake that ass
I'ma do that shit in slow motion (motion, slow motion, yeah)
You got a whole lotta cash
And, nigga, you know I want it (you know I want it)
