		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What am I supposed to say?
An old love called me yesterday
And she sounds so sweet
Why she sound so sweet

Drill me to the floor
This hurts even more than I expected it to do
Oooooo
Oooooo
(Ayyyepp)
Drill me to the floor
This hurts even more than I expected it to do

Like the moon says to the dark, we will never be apart
We'll never be alone again
Cause it was you who call me out
When I couldn't shut my mouth
About the last love that did me in
I couldn't sleep you said just sleep with me
I couldn't speak you said I'm listening
And if it breaks me down I'll be around
Until it's you love you're my new love

Drill me to the floor this hurts even more than I expected it to do
Ooooo
Ooooo
Drill me to the floor this hurts even more than I expected it to do
Ooooo
Ooooo

Old love
It's been so long
Why you gotta call
And hurt me hurt me [x3]

And I love you still
Why I love you
