		  I Wanna Love Somebody

Chorus 
I think I'm gonna die alone 
All I get to wear is funeral clothes
Watch me while I decompose
It's sad, but true you know I'm gonna die alone

Verse 1 
I figured it out while I'm in the ground there's no kinda lining
Just laying around and counting the cracks all in the ceiling
Just fooling around and breaking it down to find a meaning

I opened my mouth and you shut me down you said you were leaving
Two and two-you're an ass, see I can do math it's not appealing
Didn't think this would last no longer than that you need your sleeping

Chorus
I think I'm gonna die alone
All I get to wear is funeral clothes
Watch me while I decompose
It's sad, but true you know I'm gonna die alone

Post Chorus
I wanna love somebody
I wanna love somebody
I wanna love somebody
I wanna love somebody
I wanna love somebody
I wanna love somebody
I wanna love somebody
I wanna love somebody

Verse 2 
It's getting bad I'm stressing a tad, I don't take it lightly
Two dates were at I'm calling your dad I said it politely
But it made you mad, you said it was fast yeah, maybe just slightly

Yeah, she's coming to me looking right through me I feel it too often
But honestly I just wanna give up and get in my coffin
Put on my suit, don't bear any fruit and be forgotten

Chorus
I think I'm gonna die alone
All I get to wear is funeral clothes
Watch me while I decompose
It's sad, but true you know I'm gonna die alone
Just leave the flowers there on my tombstone
I'm losing feeling in my toes
It's sad, but true you know I'm gonna die alone

Post Chorus
I wanna love somebody
I wanna love somebody
I wanna love somebody
I wanna love somebody
I wanna love somebody
I wanna love somebody
I wanna love somebody
I wanna love somebody

Bridge
I wear a little way too much cologne
To try and cover the smell of me alone
But I don't see a reason to postpone

I wear a little way too much cologne
To try and cover the smell of me alone
But I don't see a reason to postpone

Chorus
I think I'm gonna die alone
All I get to wear is funeral clothes
Watch me while I decompose
It's sad, but true you know I'm gonna die alone

Post Chorus
I wanna love somebody
I wanna love somebody
I wanna love somebody
I wanna love somebody
I wanna love somebody
I wanna love somebody
I wanna love somebody
I wanna love somebody (x2)

Alone
