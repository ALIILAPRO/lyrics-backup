		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Grace - in a perfect world
On shines the light
Praise - an angelic song
But there's another side you'll see
Now hide
Salvation easily denied

Reigns - Down with misery
Life's not always what it seems
False hope
Written in the testament of old

Take heed
Stop believing everyword you read
Truth inconsistencies
Distorts the lie

False imprisonment
Forever lost inside your mind
Fates door
Just be careful what you wish for

Death's door
Just be careful what you wish for

Peace of mind I can't find
Don't be blind take the ride

Hey... we live in a fucked up world
Walking on through the demise
We step into the unknown
Your better save yourself...

Hey... we live in a fucked up world
Hiding behind the disguise
Never let your feelings show
Why can't you be yourself...

We live in a fucked up world
Walking on through the demise
We step into the unknown
Your better save yourself...
