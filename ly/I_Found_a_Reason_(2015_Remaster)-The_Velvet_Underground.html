		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ba-ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba-ba
 Ba-ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba-ba

 I found a reason to keep livin'
 Oh, and the reason dear is you
 I found a reason to keep singin'
 Wow-woh, and the reason dear is you

 Oh, I do believe
 if you don't like things you leave
 For someplace you've never
 gone before

 Ba-ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba-ba
 Ba-ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba-ba

 Honey, I found a reason to keep livin'
 And you know the reason dear it's you
 And I've walked down life's lonely highways
 hand in hand with myself
 And I realize
 how many paths have crossed between us

 Oh, I do believe
 you are what you perceive
 What comes is better than what
 came before

 Oh, I do believe
 you are what you perceive
 What comes is better than what
 came before

 Ba-ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba-ba
 Ba-ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba-ba

 And you better come
 come-come, come to me
 come-come, come to me, better come
 Come-come, come to me
 Ba-ba-ba-ba
 Ba
