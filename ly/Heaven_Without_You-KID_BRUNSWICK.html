		  Da Da Da Da, Da
Da Da Da Da, Da
Da Da Da Da, Da
Da Da Da Da Da Da (x2)

I’m sure it’s worse when I’m gone,
And I bet the pain won’t go away
I know that things went wrong,
But I underestimated what you did to me

And I believe this is a nightmare,
I’m naive, but for a while it was ecstasy,
I never thought we were meant to be,
You’ll never know what you meant to me

But I wish you well
And I wish I could tell you
That it Hurts Like Hell
But it’s Heaven Without You

Da Da Da Da, Da
Da Da Da Da, Da
Da Da Da Da, Da
Da Da Da Da Da Da
Da Da Da Da, Da
Da Da Da Da, Da
That it Hurts Like Hell
But it’s Heaven Without You -

I’m sure it’s worse when I’m gone,
And I bet the pain won’t go away
I know that things went wrong,
But I underestimated what you did to me

And I believe this is a nightmare,
I’m naive, but for a while it was ecstasy,
I never thought we were meant to be,
You’ll never know what you meant to me

But I wish you well
And I wish I could tell you
That it Hurts Like Hell
But it’s Heaven Without You

Da Da Da Da, Da
Da Da Da Da, Da
Da Da Da Da, Da
Da Da Da Da Da Da

I can’t do this,
I can’t do this without you
I can’t do this,
Again, no I can’t to this,
Again, Again, I can’t do this

And I believe this is a nightmare,
I’m naive, but for a while it was ecstasy,
I never thought we were meant to be,
You’ll never know what you meant to me

But I wish you well
And I wish I could tell you
That it Hurts Like Hell
But it’s Heaven Without You

No I can’t do this,
I can’t do this
No I can’t do this
Yeah it Hurts Like Hell
But it’s Heaven Without You.
