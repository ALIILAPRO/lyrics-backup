		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's so hot in here

Oh, it's so hot and I need some air
Oh boy, don't stop 'cause I'm halfway there
It's not complicated, we're just syncopated
We can read each others minds
One love united two bodies synchronizing
Don't even need to touch me baby, just

Breathe on me, yeah, oh
Baby just, breathe on me
We don't need to touch, just
Breathe, oh, yeah

Oh, this is way beyond the physical
(It's a way beyond the physical)
Tonight, my senses don't make sense at all
Our imagination, taking us to places
We have never been before take me in, let it out
Don't even need to touch me baby, just

Breathe on me, yeah, oh baby
Just, breathe on me
We don't need to touch, just
Breathe (breathe) on, (on) me,(me), oh baby
Just, breathe (breathe) on, (on) me, (me)
We don't need to touch, just breathe

Monogamy is the way to go
Just put your lips together and blow
Breathe, breathe, oh

Breathe on me (oh, oh) oh
Baby just, breathe on me (on me)
We don't need to touch, just
Breathe (breathe) on (on) me, (me) oh
Baby just, breathe (breathe) on, (on) me, (me)
We don't need to touch, just
