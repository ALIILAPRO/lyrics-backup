		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's only when I lose myself with someone else
That I find myself
I find myself
It's only when I lose myself with someone else
That I find myself
I find myself

Something beautiful is happening inside for me
Something sensual, it's full of fire and mystery
I feel hypnotized, I feel paralyzed
I have found heaven
There's a thousand reasons
Why I shouldn't spend my time with you
For every reason not to be here I can think of two
To keep me hanging on
Feeling nothing's wrong
Inside your heaven

It's only when I lose myself with someone else
That I find myself
I find myself
It's only when I lose myself with someone else
That I find myself
I find myself

I can feel the emptiness inside me fade and disappear
There's a feeling of contentment now that you are here
I feel satisfied
I belong inside
Your velvet heaven

Did I need to sell my soul
For pleasure like this?

Did I have to lose control
To treasure your kiss?

Did I need to place my heart
In the palm of your hand

Before I could even start
To understand?

It's only when I lose myself with someone else
That I find myself
I find myself
It's only when I lose myself with someone else
That I find myself
I find myself
It's only when I lose myself with someone else
That I find myself
I find myself
It's only when I lose myself with someone else
That I find myself
I find myself
