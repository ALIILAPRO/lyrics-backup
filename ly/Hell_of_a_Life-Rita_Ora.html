		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Black days
No headlights on the freeway
Fuck everything and run, run, run
It's just a shadow way
So blurry
Why is everybody worried?
'Cause I'm just havin' fun, fun, fun
There's nothin' wrong with me (ayy, yo)

You look like you'd be heaven for a night (for the night)
Make me wanna die (it's a hell of a—)
You look like money, money, dollar signs
My ticket to the ride (it's a hell of a life)

It's a hell of a life (ayy, yo, ayy, yo, ayy, yo)
It's a hell of a life

Dreamer
Or maybe I'm a make-believer
Or a fighter in the storm, cold war
Against the color grey
It gets heavy
Tryna take it slow and steady
Oh, I could use a quick fix, but hey
There's nothin' wrong with me (ayy, yo)

You look like you'd be heaven for a night (for the night)
Make me wanna die (it's a hell of a—)
You look like money, money, dollar signs
My ticket to the ride (it's a hell of a life)

It's a hell of a life (ayy, yo, ayy, yo, ayy, yo)
It's a hell of a life

Naked and unafraid
Washin' it all away
Come pick me up (Oh, what you waitin' for?)
Burnin' another day
Wasted and feeling great
Come get me now (Oh, what you waitin' for?)

You look like you'd be heaven for a night (for the night)
Make me wanna die (it's a hell of a—)
You look like money, money, dollar signs
My ticket to the ride (it's a hell of a life)

It's a hell of a life (ayy, yo, ayy, yo, ayy, yo)
It's a hell of a life
It's a hell of a life
It's a hell of a life

(It's a hell of a life)
