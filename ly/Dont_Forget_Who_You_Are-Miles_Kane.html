		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The finest clothes that you can find
Dressed in my coats, I'm feeling fine
I wanna shine

I'll shine so hard, I'll stand up high
These foolish ways, I know my place
My time is now, my time is now

Although we're tongue-tied and breathless
We won't let our worries dictate who we are
Throw out the old towels,
We won't let our worries dictate who we are
La la la, la la la la la la
Don't forget who you are

Don't build me up, make up your mind
Then keep the faith, I'll keep the faith
I like your style, you make me smile

Although we're tongue-tied and breathless
We won't let our worries dictate who we are
So let's throw out the old towels,
We won't let our worries dictate who we are
La la la, la la la la la la
Don't forget who you are

Darling close your eyes
And wish for more
Away in our dreams 'til we're ready for more

When we're tongue-tied and breathless
We won't let our worries dictate who we are
So let's throw out the old towels,
We won't let our worries dictate who we are
La la la, la la la la la la
Don't forget who you are
La la la, la la la la la la
Don't forget who you are
La la la, la la la la la la
Don't forget who you are
La la la, la la la la la la
