		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh no, baby, oh no
You never took the time to phone home
You never took a vow to not go
I'm loving you a little like slow mo
Baby, oh, no, baby, oh, wait
Even when you want to sleep late
Even when your eyes can't see straight
I need to find another one (another one), another one (another one)

I'm not goin' to bed because you want me to 
Tell me why you allow alcohol get to you 
I never wanted to end this book, this fairytale (fairytale)
Not another drink this week, I just wanna feel complete

I guess, I never knew you very well (knew you very well)
I guess, I never knew you very well (knew you very well)
I guess, I never knew you very well (knew you very well)
I guess, I never knew you very well 

Don't say that I'm gettin' you wrong
Money came today, and so you'll get what you want
I wish that it would end when it stopped bein' fun
"He's not feeling well", is what I tell everyone
Yesterday I took a sip of your rum
I don't think today I'll face anyone
I can't imagine feelin' that every day
You'll buy another bottle, drink it all anyway, so

I guess, I never knew you very well (knew you very well)
I guess, I never knew you very well (knew you very well)
I guess, I never knew you very well (knew you very well)
I guess, I never knew you very well (knew you very well)

I just wanna feel complete
