		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's a hole in the bottom of my brain
But when I party, the hole goes away
But the party I throw needs a picture to post
So the world knows the party was great
There's a hole in the bottom of my brain
But when you like me, the hole goes away
So there's likes and 'hello's on a post on my phone
Of a party I throw
In the hole in the bottom of my brain
(This is how you do it right)

Heads-up, I'm sorry to be that guy
Heads-up, I'm lookin' to just get by
Let's just say
Let's just say we're fine

There's a hole in the bottom of my brain
But when you love me, the hole goes away
And the likes on my phone, yeah, they'll start to explode
If I go and explode in L.A.
There's a hole in the bottom of my brain
If I make money, the hole goes away
Now, there's a thing made of gold in a home that I own
From a song that I wrote about likes and 'hello's
On a post on my phone of a party I throw
In the hole in the bottom of my brain
(This is how you do it right)

Heads-up, I'm sorry to be that guy
Heads-up, I'm lookin' to just get by
Let's just say
Let's just say we're fine
Let's just say
Let's just say we're fine

There's a hole in the bottom of my brain
When I spend money, the hole goes away
If I finally get clothes that are fancily sewn
I could finally be ready for fame

There's a hole in the bottom of your brain
When you get famous, the hole goes away
Now, there's coke on the nose of a bro I don't know
In a showroom of clothes that were fancily sewn
In a town that I loathe on a coast that gets stoked
On the thing made of gold in a home that I own
From a song that I wrote about likes and 'hello's
On a post on my phone of a party I throw
But I know I'm alone, no, I know I'm alone
In the hole in the bottom of my brain
