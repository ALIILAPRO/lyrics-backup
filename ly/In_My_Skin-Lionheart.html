		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I die...bury me at sea. Bury me far away, so I can rest in peace. 
And maybe one day I can finally be free from this disease.
Depression is killing me. I can’t shake these demons that keep on haunting me.
Confession, I know I’ll never change. But maybe I don’t want to, maybe I love the
pain. Living life with a gun in my mouth, pull the trigger, spit the bullet back out.
Drawn to the flame, stomach burning w/ desire. I just wanna feel the fire.
Standing in the rain, thunder singin like a choir. I just wanna feel the fire. Dear god,
it’s me again. Devil at my door, and I ain’t tryna let him in. Demons in my body, I can
feel em in my skin. I can feel em in my skin. Been taking these same pills since I was a kid.
