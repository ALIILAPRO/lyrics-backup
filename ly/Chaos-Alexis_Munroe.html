		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Self destruction
A far left princess
Chaos
All that we know
All that we know is chaos
All that we know is chaos
All that we know is chaos
All that we know is chaos
All that we know is chaos
All that we know is chaos
All that we know is chaos
All that we know
Creator of my own
Mass destruction
I fall apart when i'm alone
Self destruction
A far left princess
Hard to clean up all the mess
So I set it all on fire
And I watched it burn
You destroy me
So I destroyed everything
You destroy me
Destroy
All that we know is chaos
All that we know is chaos
All that we know is chaos
All that we know is chaos
All that we know is chaos
All that we know is chaos
All that we know is chaos
All that we know
You destroy me
So I destroyed everything
You destroy me
Destroy
