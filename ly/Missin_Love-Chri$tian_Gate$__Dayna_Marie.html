		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I gave you the world and you bit my hand
You're making me crazy with the way that you played me
I could be your girl but you lost your chance
You're makin' me crazy you still be my baby

Yeah I want you to mean something special to me
I want you to know that I got what you need
I want you for all the days that we have
And if you fall in love baby that's my bad

I know your missing love, missing love, missing love
And I'm missing your touch, your touch, your touch
And I'm losing myself in those eyes and those lips
Baby you're not average
I found your light and my shadow is gone
I'll take your hand if you like holding on
If you're with me don't worry bout whats wrong
I'll take your hand and we'll start moving on

Yeah I want you to mean something special to me
I want you to know that I got what you need
I want you for all the days that we have
And if you fall in love baby that's my bad

Yeah I want you to mean something special to me
I want you to know that I got what you need
I want you for all the days that we have
And if you fall in love baby that's my bad
