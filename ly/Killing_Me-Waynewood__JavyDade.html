		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can write all about you like a journalist
Tell me how ya feel when you notice this
Just know when I love that is permanent
And yea i let you win every argument
But you had to fuck it up
Randomly switching up
Can't find the remedy for the shit that you've done
I been intoxicated got me feeling numb
I been isolated you left me with none
To you I was just another
To me you was like no other
Still got the love but its fuck ya
I'll murder whoever touch ya
But do ya thing, It's no pressure
Good luck on you finding better
I'll hit you back for my sweater
DADE
Cause my soul is broke
And I lost all hope
I got Jack in my cup
I want to drink it up
Need to numb the pain
Fuck the personal gain
I got drugs in my veins
I got to suck it up
Please don't hit me up cause I'm not picking up
Used to be about us now you're outta luck
Girl I'm killing me trying to kill you
I'm a need another cup, I'm drinking till I'm feeling numb
Drink my demons away
Pour it up, Pour it up
Drown my sorrows
I'm a leave you now, I can't be stuck
Chasing tomorrows
Feels like I'm free falling
I hear the devil calling
Cause my soul is broke
And I lost all hope
I got Jack in my cup
I want to drink it up
Need to numb the pain
Fuck the personal gain
I got drugs in my veins
I got to suck it up
Please don't hit me up cause I'm not picking up
Used to be about us now you're outta luck
Girl I'm killing me trying to kill you
I'm a need another cup, I'm drinking till I'm feeling numb
Please don't hit me up cause I'm not picking up
Used to be about us now you're outta luck
Girl I'm killing me trying to kill you
I'm a need another cup, I'm drinking till I'm feeling numb
