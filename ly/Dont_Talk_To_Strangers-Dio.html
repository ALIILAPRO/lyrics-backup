		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Don't talk to strangers)

Don't talk to strangers
'Cause they're only there to do you harm
Don't write in starlight
'Cause the words may come out real

Don't hide in doorways
You may find the key that opens up your soul
Don't go to heaven
'Cause it's really only Hell

Don't smell the flowers
They're an evil drug to make you lose your mind
Don't dream of women
'Cause they'll only bring you down

Hey you, you know me, you've touched me, I'm real
I'm forever the one that lets you look and see
And feel me
I'm danger, I'm the stranger

And I, I'm darkness, I'm anger, I'm pain
I, I'm master
The evil song you sing inside your brain
Drive you insane

Don't talk
Don't let them inside your mind, yeah
Run away, run away, go

No, no
Don't let them in your mind
Protect your soul

Don't dance in darkness
You may stumble and you're sure to fall
Don't write in starlight
'Cause the words may come out real

Don't talk to strangers (don't talk to strangers)
'Cause they're only there to make you sad
Don't dream of women
'Cause they'll only bring you down, yeah

Run, run, run, run away
