		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Scenery seasonal
Fixed and falling into place
The worst parts stay the same

I say it's alright
It's alright
It’s gonna get better
Promise that I’ll try
That I’ll try
(Keep you waiting)
I just need a minute, I just need to cry
Get like that sometimes
Get like that sometimes

Scenery seasonal
Fixed and falling into

I say it's alright
It's alright
It’s gonna get better
Promise that I’ll try
That I’ll try
I just need a minute, I just need to cry
Get like that sometimes
Get like that sometimes

I say it's alright
It's alright
I say it's alright
It's alright
I just need a minute, I just need to cry
Get like that sometimes
Get like that sometimes
