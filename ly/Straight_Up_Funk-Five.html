		  Straight up funk in your ear
If you really want it
[Repeat: 2X]
It's over here 

And yo it's mad funkiness and we be blowing up blough
Tell me what you want boo and I'm a do it now its my turn da
Boss, baby, time to set it off be all up in your action with passion of course
Level with your mental, funk I get into
All of the things that you need to get into
Rock the set, straight up the concept cause we be going down 
Diggy diggy, down, diggy down check

[Chorus: ]
I know that you want something from me (yeah)
Well I've got something I know you need
From the east to the west everybody get up now
(Get on up, Get on up)
'Cause this here's a party and we gotta get on down
(Break it down, Break it down)

Ah yes you'll check me out rugged and raw
It's all I can stand and I can't stand no more
I'm bugging, renegade hooligan damn
5 bad boys got my back hear the plan
never have you ever seen or never will you chec
a fly human being I'm as funky as it gets
so step back relax the wax is boom diggy
watch the boys breaking it down city to city

[Chorus: ]

It's over just like a wack track you can't get with this
so you gotta get with that no doubt in my mind
the base so phatt baby let me bring it on wiggy wack
