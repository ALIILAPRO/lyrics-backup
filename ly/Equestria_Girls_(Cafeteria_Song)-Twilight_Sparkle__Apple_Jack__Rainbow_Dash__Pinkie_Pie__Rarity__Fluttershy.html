		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey, hey everybody
We've got something to say
We may seem as different as the night is from day
But you look a little deeper and you will see
That I'm just like you and you're just like me, yeah

Hey, hey everybody, we're here to shout
That the magic of friendship is what it's all about
Yeah, we thought we were different as the night is from the day
Until Twilight Sparkle helped us see another way

So get up, get down if you're gonna come around
We can work together, helping Twilight win the crown
So get up, get down 'cause it's gonna make a sound
If we work together, helping Twilight Sparkle win the crown

Hey, hey, hands up now
We're sending a message to the crowd
Hands wave up, then come down
We party together all around
Generous, honesty, laughter, kindness, loyalty
Twilight helped us each to see all that we can be

So get up, get down if you're gonna come around
We can work together, helping Twilight win the crown
So get up, get down 'cause it's gonna make a sound
If we work together, helping Twilight Sparkle win the crown

I'm gonna be myself, no matter what I do
And if we're different, yeah, I want you to be true to you
If you follow me, we'll put our differences aside
We'll stick together and start working on that school pride

Jump up, make a sound (hey)
Stomp your hooves, turn around
Start now, make a change, gonna come around
Jump up, make a sound (hey)
Stomp your hooves, turn around
Canterlot Wondercolts, help her win the crown

Jump up, make a sound (hey)
Stomp your hooves, turn around
Start now, make a change, gonna come around
Jump up, make a sound (hey)
Stomp your hooves, turn around
Canterlot Wondercolts, help her win the crown

Jump up, make a sound (hey)
Stomp your hooves, turn around
Start now, make a change, gonna come around
Jump up, make a sound (hey)
Stomp your hooves, turn around
Canterlot Wondercolts, help her win the crown (yeah)
