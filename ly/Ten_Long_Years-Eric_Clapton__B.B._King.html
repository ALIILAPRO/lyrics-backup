		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, I had a woman
She was nice and loving to me in every way
Oh, I had a woman
She was nice and loving to me in every way
Oh, she used to love me
Bring my breakfast to the bed every day

Oh, for ten long years
Yes, she was my pride and joy
Oh, for ten long years
She was my pride and joy
Well, I used to call her my little girl
And she used to call me her little boy

Oh, mercy
Ow
Yeah

Well, it's all over, baby
Girl, you know I'm all alone
Well, it's all over, baby
Babe you know I'm all alone
Well, the reason I sing these blues
Yes, you know my baby's gone
