		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We've spent years awaiting our judgement
Our hands aligned, intrinsically entwined

But in the blink of an eye, you kissed me goodbye
And the taste of your lips left me mortified
They were cold, full of spite and under a guise
You promised we'd both be dead that night

I'm breaking down, breaking down at the thought of you
I keep breaking down, breaking down over you again
I can't face, can't face that you're happier
And so, I'm stuck rotting six feet under

We've spent years awaiting our judgement
Our hands aligned, intrinsically entwined

But in the blink of an eye, you kissed me goodbye
And I reminisced of a better time
You were warm, full of life and under a cry
You promised we'd both crawl out that night

But in the blink of an eye (you left me here)
You kissed me goodbye (you left me here)
And the taste of your lips (you left me here)
Left me mortified (you left me here)
They were cold, full of spite (you left me here)
And under a guise (you left me here)
You promised we'd both (you left me here)
Be dead that night (to die that night)

I'm breaking down, breaking down at the thought of you
I keep breaking down, breaking down over you again
I can't face, can't face that you're happier
And so, I'm stuck rotting six feet under

I'm breaking down, breaking down at the thought of you
I keep breaking down, breaking down, breaking through again
But I can't face, can't face that I miss what we were
So, I'm stuck rotting six feet under

I'm breaking down, brea-
Down at the thought of you
I keep breaking down, breaking down over you again
I can't face, can't face that you're happier
And fuck, I'm stuck rotting six feet under

I'm breaking down, breaking down (at the thought of you)
(I keep breaking down, breaking down over you again
I can't face, can't face that you're happier
And so, I'm stuck rotting six feet under)

I'll crawl out
And drag you down with me
It's only fair
I see you never cared
