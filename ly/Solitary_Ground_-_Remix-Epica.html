		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Living at different places
Evading into various spaces
My compass has broken; I'm losing the way
An ongoing madness has led me astray

My past breathes down my neck
And it seems now that all I can do is
Go back to beginnings when all lay ahead
A fading illusion now plagues me instead

In me there's still a place that fulfils me
A sanctity here that I call home and run to when winter descends
If I try can I find solid ground

I follow elusive paths
Oh it seems they've been written in stone
And the door to a new life is closing so fast
Burning the bridges will not bring me back

In me there's still a place that fulfils me
A sanctity here that I call home and run to
When winter descends,
If I try can I find solid ground

I know that in me there still a place that fulfils me
A sanctity here, that I call home and run to
When winter descends
If I try can I find solid ground

Or am I just wasting time?
