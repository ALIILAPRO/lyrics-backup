		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know that you are impatient
I guess it's five after nine o'clock
Another day that I've wasted
It's better if you fight it off

Is it not what you came for?
I never know what I want
Could you come back tomorrow?

You shake it off but keep it in
Do it the same way you always did
I wonder how you bend
You say forgive and then forget

Is it not what you came for?
I know it's getting late
Could you want me tomorrow?
Or is it gone?
Is it gone?

I'm living in between feelings
Climb a wall, keep falling down
Hoping it would be different
Where's your hand? Now pull me out

What if I'm not what you came for
Tell me it's not too late
Could you love me tomorrow?
Or is it gone?
Is it gone?
Is it gone?
Is it gone?

I'll love you only in time
I'll love you only in time
I'll love you only in time
