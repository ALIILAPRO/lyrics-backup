		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  whooah bite! whooah bite!
release the bats. release the bats
don't tell me that it doesn't hurt.
a hundred fluttering in your skirt
(don't tell me that it doesn't hurt) 

my baby is alright
she doesn't mind a bit of dirt
she says 'horror vampire bat bite'
she says 'horror vampire
how I wish those bats would bite'
whooah bite! bite! 

release the bats! release the bats!
pump them up and explode the things
her legs are chafed by sticky wings
(sticky sticky little things). 

my baby is a cool machine
she moves to the pulse of her generator
says damn that sex supreme.
she says damn that horror bat
sex vampire, cool machine 

release the bats! release the bats!
release them! 

baby is a cool machine
she moves to the pulse of her generator
says damn that sex supreme.
she says, she says damn that horror bat
sex horror sex bat sex sex horror sex vampire
sex bat horror vampire sex
cool machine
horror bat. bite!
cool machine. bite!
sex vampire. bite!
