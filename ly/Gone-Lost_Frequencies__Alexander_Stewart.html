		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I'm gone, you're still in my songs
'Cause I still need you
I'm gone
You're safe in my mind
'Cause I still need you, I'm

Well, it definitely hurt me to go
We always said it would be worth it, and so
I hope I never let your light get too low
'Cause I still need you, I'm
Well, you never want your demons to show
Better running from a fear that you know
Hope I never let your light get too low
'Cause I still need you, I'm (I still need you, I'm)

(I still need you, I'm)
(When I'm gone)
(I still need you, I'm)
(When I'm-)

I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll hold back
Tell inhibitions fall back
Ditched all that shit involved
Took all the love I know
See, I stayed, I prayed for all that
I stay with soul still intact
Through every night alone
For every scar is shown

You know I'm all any given time (given time)
You know I hate to have say goodbye
The color crimson, how it cut the sky
Hope I don't forget that night

When I'm gone, you're still in my songs
'Cause I still need you
I'm gone
You're safe in my mind
'Cause I still need you, I'm

Well, it definitely hurt me to go
We always said it would be worth it, and so
I hope I never let your light get too low
'Cause I still need you, I'm
Well, you never want your demons to show
Better running from a fear that you know
Hope I never let your light get too low
'Cause I still need you, I'm (gone)

(I still need you, I'm)
(When I'm gone)
(I still need you, I'm)
'Cause I need you, I'm
(Oh-oh, oh)
'Cause I need you, I'm

Well, I still need you, I'm
Safe in my, you're safe in my mind
Well, I still need you, I'm
Safe in my, you're safe in my mind (yeah)

When I'm gone, you're still in my songs
'Cause I still need you
I'm gone
You're safe in my mind
'Cause I still need you, I'm

Well, it definitely hurt me to go
We always said it would be worth it, and so
I hope I never let your light get too low
'Cause I still need you, I'm
Well, you never want your demons to show
Better running from a fear that you know
Hope I never let your light get too low
'Cause I still need you, I'm
