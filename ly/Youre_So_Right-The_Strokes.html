		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell me what happened
Tell me what happened
Tell me what happened, if you like
Get off on the same floor
Get off on the same floor
Get off on the same floor, every night

What are the reasons
What are the reasons
What are the reasons to find more
I wanna tell you
I wanna tell you
I wanna tell you nothing more

In my mind, gave a hand
Never once gave a damn

I'm done with the office
I'm done with the office
I'm done with the office, hello, forest

I still want to ask you
I still want to ask you
I still want to ask you something more

In my mind, gave a hand
Never once gave a damn

I don't want to fight
Don't wanna beg you any-
I don't want to fight
Don't wanna beg you any-
I don't want to fight
Don't wanna beg you any-
Why?

I don't wanna argue
I don't wanna argue
I don't wanna argue, think you would
I wouldn't hurt you
I wouldn't hurt you
Maybe I'd hurt you if I could
