		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm anxious, pacin'
Thoughts are racin'
Is this over?
Why won't you call my number?

You said I'll be alright
I knew by the look in your eyes
But anytime you want, you know I'll be the one
Do you feel the same or was it just for fun?

'Cause summer's gone, I'm alone wishin'
For your call, starting to freak
I'm not sure if he's coming over
For the night, quarterback's fine
Summer's gone, I'm alone wishin'
For your call, starting to freak
I'm not sure if he's coming over
For the night, quarterback's fine

Spotlights, burned out
I'm left with my doubts
Yeah, we're done, but what for?
I don't play for a team sport

You said I'll be alright
I knew by the look in your eyes
But anytime you want, you know I'll be the one
Racing to your door even against the odds

But now summer's gone, I'm alone wishin'
For your call, starting to freak
I'm not sure if he's coming over
For the night, quarterback's fine
Summer's gone, I'm alone wishin'
For your call, starting to freak
I'm not sure if he's coming over
For the night, quarterback's fine
