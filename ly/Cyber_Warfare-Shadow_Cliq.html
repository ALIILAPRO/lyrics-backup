		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Welcome to my own personal hell
I've become a ghost of myself
I've become a ghost of myself
I'm this close to breaking out

This body is just a shell
I'm this close to breaking out
I'm just a ghost of myself
The violence is bleeding out

You symbolize all that I hate
Not gonna do what you say
Need everybody to go away
Don't want this feeling to go to waste

Inject poison into my veins
Convincing me that I'm insane
I need you you to feel my pain
I'm not just a pawn in your game

Cyber warfare
Mastermind
I can feel you 
Behind my eyes

clways watching
Creep inside
Feed me lies, feed me lies

It's over now
I'm waking up 
This is the revolution 
The only solution
It's time to die
Burn down this hive
Burn down this hive
I'm not just a pawn in your game

Poison, through my own bleeding veins
cnd i'll never bleed the same
No i'll never bleed the same
I've become my worst enemy

This body is just a clone
When i'm caught under your control
I'm just a ghost of myself
The violence is bleeding out

You symbolize all that I hate
Not gonna do what you say
Need everybody to go away
Don't want this feeling to go to waste

Inject poison into my brain
Convincing me that I'm insane
I need you to feel my pain
I'm not just a pawn in your game

Cyber warfare
Mastermind
I can feel you 
Behind my eyes

clways watching
Creep inside
Feed me lies, feed me lies

It's over now
I'm waking up 
This is the revolution 
The only solution
It's time to die
Burn down this hive
Burn down this hive
I'm not just a pawn in your game

Fuck!
I'm not just a pawn in your game
I'm not just a pawn in your game
I'm not just a pawn in your game

Suffocate me
Why'd you break me
Save me
Breed me
Feed me
Hate me

Oh you already now
This is the ending
No more pretending
It's already over
Don't come to the show
This is a prison
They sold your soul

The violence is bleeding out
It's already over
I'm just a ghost
I'm this close to breaking out
It's already over
The violence is bleeding out
I'm just a ghost
I'm this close to breaking out
