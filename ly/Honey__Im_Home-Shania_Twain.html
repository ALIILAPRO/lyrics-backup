		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Hit us, mm, ah ah)

The car won't start, it's falling apart
I was late for work and the boss got smart
My panty line shows, got a run in my hose
My hair went flat, man, I hate that (hate that)
Oh

Just when I thought things couldn't get worse
I realized I forgot my purse
With all this stress, I must confess
This could be worse than PMS

This job ain't worth the pay
Can't wait 'til the end of the day
H-Hey honey, I'm on my way
Hey (hey), hey (hey), hey, hey

Honey, I'm home and I had a hard day
Pour me a cold one and oh, by the way
Hey, rub my feet, gimme something to eat
Fix me up my favorite treat
Honey, I'm back, my head's killing me
I need to relax and watch TV
Get off the phone, give the dog a bone
Hey (hey), hey, honey, I'm home

I broke a nail opening the mail
I cursed out loud 'cause it hurt like hell
This job's a pain, it's so mundane
It sure don't stimulate my brain

This job ain't worth the pay
Can't wait 'til the end of the day
Hey honey, I'm on my way
Hey (hey), hey (hey), hey, hey

Honey, I'm home and I had a hard day
Pour me a cold one and oh, by the way
Hey, rub my feet, gimme something to eat
And fix me up my favorite treat
Honey, I'm back, my head's killing me
I need to relax and watch TV
Get off the phone, give the dog a bone
Hey (hey), hey, honey, I'm home

Oh, rub my neck will you, yeah, woo
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

Honey, I'm home and I had a hard day
Pour me a cold one and oh, by the way
Hey, rub my feet, gimme something to eat
Fix me up my favorite treat
Honey, I'm back, my head's killing me
I need to relax and watch TV
Get off the phone, give the dog a bone
Hey (hey), hey, honey, I'm home, mm

I'm home, oh, uh, that feels much better
