		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Waaah, Blah Blah Blaaah
Waaah, Blah Blah Blaaah
Not a sweet boy
You're an Eton mess
Go home puddin’
You couldn’t care less
For the people you're hurting
There's no excuse
No matter who can see you, who you wanna seduce
Not a sweet boy
You're an Eton mess
Go home puddin’
You couldn’t care less
For the people you're hurting
There's no excuse
No matter who can see you, who you wanna seduce
Waaah, Blah Blah Blaaah
Waaah, Blah Blah Blaaah
Get out of there
You don't deserve that chair
Take a seat elsewhere
You don’t deserve that chair
You’ve ruined the colour blue for me
I'm surrounded by a deep dark sea
You've lied to us and honestly
You've ruined the colour blue for me
You’ve ruined the colour blue for me
I'm surrounded by a deep dark sea
You've lied to us and honestly
You've ruined the colour blue for me
Waaah, Blah Blah Blaaah
Waaah, Blah Blah Blaaah
Wah Wah Wah
Wah Blah Blah
Blah Wah Wah
Wah Blah Blah
Waaah, Blah Blah Blaaah
Waaah, Blah Blah Blaaah
You’ve ruined the colour blue for me
I'm surrounded by a deep dark sea
You've lied to us and honestly
You've ruined the colour blue for me
You’ve ruined the colour blue for me
I'm surrounded by a deep dark sea
You've lied to us and honestly
You've ruined the colour blue for me
