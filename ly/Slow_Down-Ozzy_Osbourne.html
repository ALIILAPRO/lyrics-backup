		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'll never bother keeping up with you
Burning the candle at both at both ends it's true
You know the writings on the wall why do you ride to take a fall

Slow down your moving way to fast
Slow down you know you'll never last
Slow down your haste is making waste
Slow down and join the human race

I tried to tell you time and time again
You know you'll have to pay the consequence
Now your obsessed with such a pace
But slow and steady wins the race

Slow down your moving way to fast
Slow down you know you'll never last
Slow down your haste is making waste
Slow down and join the human race

You seem to run around and round in vain
People are saying that you've gone insane
Tell me just what you're running from
One day you're here and the next you're gone

Slow down you're moving way to fast
Slow down you know you'll never last
Slow down your haste is making waste
Slow down and join the human race
