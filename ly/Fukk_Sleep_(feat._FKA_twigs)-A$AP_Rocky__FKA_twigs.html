		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, yeah
Ahh

Fuck home, fuck sleep, come clean, zonin'
Can't forget that I'm golden, can't forget where I'm going
Fuck popo, police, enemies, fake homies
Can't forget that I'm a OG, better act like you know it (oh, yeah)

Blunt smoke, smoke weed, codeine, cough
Tell that bitch that I'm awesome, better back the fuck up off me
Coco, Celine, Tiffany, she flossy (ahh)
Ain't concerned with who bought these
Can't forget that she bossy

When y'all was buying surfboards tryna ride the wave
I was cooking up another fucking tidal wave (brr)
Had to get entitled motherfuckers out the way
Had to take another title, sorry for the wait
Barely ever took a break on fashion like my time
Need more hours in a day, I apologize if I'm late
Tap the vein, whoa
Barley look like I'm awake
Darker shades, bluer veins, bluer money in the bankroll

Fuck home, fuck sleep, come clean, zonin'
Can't forget that I'm golden, can't forget where I'm going
Fuck popo, police, enemies, fake homies
Can't forget that I'm a OG, better act like you know it

I remember I was poor, when I was young and living homeless
Now I rock the Ricky Owens, eyes looking like he rolling
Got new bags under my eyelids, new bags up in my closets
New bags like I went shoppin', new bags on new bags
Minds better at seeing two now, needing up on my downtime
Hit the waves with a new sound
House tunes but it's screwed down
That's dope (sauce)
Take a sec to thank the Lord
'Nother one to call my folks
Hit my momma on the phone
She like, "Son, you the boss"
Focus, don't get caught up in the moment
Can't forget that I'm golden
Don't forget that I'm chosen

Fuck home, fuck sleep, come clean, zonin'
Can't forget that I'm golden, can't forget where I'm going
Fuck popo, police, enemies, fake homies
Can't forget that I'm a OG, better act like you know it

They called me a bitch
Burned me like saffron, my matter is golden
A child of the Odyssey
My touch is righteous, like virus my Midas
I'm golden
He told me when I'm present
Chosen
So hold me tight, I swear
I'm golden

Fuck home, fuck sleep, come clean, zonin' (golden)
Can't forget that I'm golden, can't forget where I'm going
Fuck popo (golden), police, enemies, fake homies
Can't forget that I'm a OG, better act like you know it
