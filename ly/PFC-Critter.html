		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Walk around like I got a secret
And you think you know it
But there's nothing trapped in my teeth and
You like to think that I got a weakness
And won't ever show it
But honey I'm out in the open

I won't apologize
For how you see things through your eyes
Your loss, you won't realize
It's good to get me on your side

I'm not that pretty
But I'm pretty fucking cool
So fuck it
You wanna know me
And I just need something to do
So fuck it

You waste your energy telling stories
Nights full of glory
Beautiful faces and bodies
But what's the point of envying something
If it's that damn boring
And you just run back every morning

I won't apologize
For how you see things through your eyes
Your loss, you won't realize
It's good to get me on your side

I'm not that pretty
But I'm pretty fucking cool
So fuck it
You wanna know me
And I just need something to do
So fuck it
I'm not that pretty
But I'm pretty fucking cool
I love it
You wanna know me
And I just need something to do
So touch it

I'm not that pretty
But I'm pretty fucking cool
So fuck it
You wanna know me
And I just need something to do
So fuck it
I'm not that pretty
But I'm pretty fucking cool
I love it
You wanna know me
And I just need something to do
So touch it
