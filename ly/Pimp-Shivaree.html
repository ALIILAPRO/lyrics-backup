		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Look who's pulling up outside
With a trunk full of fun and a European ride
Heard that you were going far away
And we are all so happy son
That we were on the way

You're a back stabbing Hollywood pimp
Microphone, silver tone, cellular phone
We know that you're working for the devil
Bitch slap, star map dinner at Jones

Stood in line to get burned
Hey baby doll
Your reservation is confirmed
Tell the boss I've got her on the way
And he said with a smile
That's the seventh one today

You're a back stabbing Hollywood pimp
Microphone, silver tone, cellular phone
We know that you're working for the devil
Bitch slap, star map dinner at Jones

How'd you get so mean and nasty
I didn't want you to come to my party anyway

He's going to play you a dream
Dress you up in chocolate
And finish you with cream
Squeeze you till you're warm and woozy
And then pop you on the saddle of a silver moto guzzi

You're a back stabbing Hollywood pimp
Microphone, silver tone, cellular phone
We know that you're working for the devil
Bitch slap, star map dinner at Jones
