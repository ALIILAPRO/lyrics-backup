		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've found heaven in a world so cold
When hell rains, people turn to letting go
And if you've fallen on your knees
I will stitch your cuts that bleed
No rush, love, we can take this slow

If you walk with me
We can take small steps
Through these troubled streets
We'll be hand in hand
I'm not giving up
'Cause I've found heaven in a world so cold
If you walk with me 
We can take small steps
I'm not giving up

Wo-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm not giving up
Wo-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I'll fight for you when your hands are tied
Keep calm, you'll never be left behind
I know that it's hard to take a leap of faith sometimes
But it all starts with one foot at a time

I would wait a lifetime for you
Never givin' up, oh no-oh
No rush, love, we can take this slow

If you walk with me
We can take small steps
Through these troubled streets
We'll be hand in hand
I'm not giving up
Cause I've found heaven in a world so cold
If you walk with me 
We can take small steps

If you wanna walk with me
If you wanna walk with me
Oh if you wanna walk with me
If you wanna walk

If you wanna walk with me (take small steps)
If you wanna walk with me (take small steps)
Oh if you wanna walk with me (take small steps)
If you wanna walk
If you wanna walk

If you walk with me
We can take small steps
Through these troubled streets
We'll be hand in hand
I'm not giving up
Cause I've found heaven in a world so cold
If you walk with me 
We can take small steps
I'm not giving up

Wo-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm not giving up
Wo-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
