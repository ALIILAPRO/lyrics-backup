		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, ho
Yeah, ho
Yeah, ho
Yeah, ho

And you know I got a thing for a curly headed chick
When I'm eatin' out in Taboo in Miami
'Cause you know I gotta pull up in that wide body thang
You can't park me by no Range
'Cause I pull up with that double parkin'
You know I gotta keep the fire on me
In the side pocket, shawty
Got the light saber on me like I'm skywalkin'
You know I gotta walk inside the spot like the man tonight
Bad bitches catch it with their hands tight

Yeah, ayy
I could throw this dick for days
Girl, you know you got it, you could post this pic for days
Out of town, girl, I know you goin' different ways
Pretty sweet face, she got rolled, dipped in glaze, ayy
Bitch don't bang on me, go to chase
Bitch, don't touch my cheese, go to blaze
Someone gotta call on God for the scripture
Every girl that hop inside my car take a picture

Sheesh, she's feelin' free so she let her curls out
Out the house and she finally got the girls out
Go and poke it out, shawty, let it twirl out
Out the house and she finally got it

And you know I got a thing for a curly headed chick
When I'm eatin' out in Taboo in Miami
'Cause you know I gotta pull up in that wide body thang
You can't park me by no Range
'Cause I pull up with that double parkin'
You know I gotta keep the fire on me
In the side pocket, shawty
Got the light saber on me like I'm skywalkin'
You know I gotta walk inside the spot like the man tonight
Bad bitches catch it with their hands tight

Yeah, ayy, ayy
Shot o'clock, ayy, shot o'clock
Bitch, shot o'clock, ayy
How many licks do it take to make a thotty stop?
Lil' Wayne Lanez, tell her, "Lick me like a lollipop"
I am doin' way better than my ex and I know
Them frozen nights slippin' on the chain like snow
I don't like to get mixy with your friends, you know
I love a curly headed bitch that meet me up alone

Sheesh, she's feelin' free so she let her curls out
Out the house and she finally got the girls out
Go and poke it out, shawty, let it twirl out
Out the house and she finally got it

You know I got a thing for a curly headed chick
When I'm eatin' out in Taboo in Miami
'Cause you know I gotta pull up in that wide body thang
You can't park me by no Range
'Cause I pull up with that double parkin'
You know I gotta keep the fire on me
In the side pocket, shawty
Got the light saber on me like I'm skywalkin'
You know I gotta walk inside the spot like the man tonight
Bad bitches catch it with their hands tight, yeah

Yeah, ho
Yeah, ho
Yeah, ho
