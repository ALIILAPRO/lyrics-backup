		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm a big big girl
In a big big world
It's not a big big thing if you leave me
But I do do feel
That I do do will
Miss you much
Miss you much

I can see the first leaf falling
It's all yellow and nice
It's so very cold outside
Like the way I'm feeling inside

I'm a big big girl
In a big big world
It's not a big big thing if you leave me
But I do do feel
That I do do will
Miss you much
Miss you much

Outside it's now raining
And tears are falling from my eyes
Why did it have to happen?
Why did it all have to end?

I'm a big big girl
In a big big world
It's not a big big thing if you leave me
But I do do feel
That I do do will
Miss you much
Miss you much

I have your arms around me
Warm like fire
But when I open my eyes
You're gone

I'm a big big girl
In a big big world
It's not a big big thing if you leave me
But I do do feel
That I do do will
Miss you much
Miss you much

I'm a big big girl
In a big big world
It's not a big big thing if you leave me
But I do feel
I will
Miss you much
Miss you much
