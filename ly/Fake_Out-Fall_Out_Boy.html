		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take a knife and cut through the darkness
Castle temp, red wine
But I make no plans and none can be broken
No plans and none can be broken
Remember us just like this forever
But this can't last, won't last
So make no plans and none can be broken
No plans and none can be broken

Do you laugh about me whenever I leave?
Or do I just need more therapy?

Love is in the air
I just gotta figure out a window to break out
Buried alive inside my dreams
But it was all a fake out
And I don't care
I just gotta figure out a window to break out
Buried alive inside my dreams
But it was all a fake out, fake out

My mood board is just pictures of you
But I'm not sad anymore
So make no plans and none can be broken
No plans and none can be broken
But I didn't take the love when I had the chance
But I swear I'm not sad anymore
So make no plans and none can be broken
No plans and none can be broken

Do you laugh about me whenever I leave?
Or do I still need more therapy?

Love is in the air
I just gotta figure out a window to break out
Buried alive inside my dreams
But it was all a fake out
And I don't care
I just gotta figure out a window to break out
Buried alive inside my dreams
But it was all a fake out, fake out

Oh-oh, we all started off as shiny dimes
But we all got flipped too many times
We did it for futures that never came
And for pasts that we're never gonna change

Love is in the air
I just gotta figure out a window to break out
Buried alive inside my dreams
But it was all a fake out
And I don't care
I just gotta figure out a window to break out
Buried alive inside my dreams
But it was all a fake out, fake out
