		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Car chase, got the Devil on me
Can't see, got nothing but a twenty on me, on me
Nothing ever comes for free
You can pay what you want
But you're never gonna own me
Stargaze while I'm rollin' on trees
Comes cheap, got nothing but a twenty on me, on me
Nothing ever comes for free
You can pay what you want
But you're never gonna own me
(Never gonna, never gonna)
You can pay what you want
But you're never gonna own me
(Never gonna, never gonna)
You can pay what you want
But you're never gonna own me

Let it slide for the very last time
See the fear when I look into your eyes
Hear my voice while you slippin' that night
You keep flexing, I keep working
Checkmate, get you outta that crown
Change guard, everybody bow down
Last words blowing outta your mouth
You keep talking, I keep working

Car chase, got the Devil on me
Can't see, got nothing but a twenty on me, on me
Nothing ever comes for free
You can pay what you want
But you're never gonna own me
Stargaze while I'm rollin' on trees
Comes cheap, got nothing but a twenty on me, on me
Nothing ever comes for free
You can pay what you want
But you're never gonna own me
(Never gonna, never gonna)
You can pay what you want
But you're never gonna own me
(Never gonna, never gonna)
You can pay what you want
But you're never gonna own me

Try to push me
I'ma let you push right through me
Turn into a ghost, can't touch me
I'ma make you swear (I'ma make you swear)
You say you got a plan for me
That you always wanna stand with me
Say you better tread carefully, yeah
Wish that you could just abandon me
You can pay what you want
But you're never gonna own me

Car chase, got the Devil on me
Can't see, got nothing but a twenty on me, on me
Nothing ever comes for free
You can pay what you want
But you're never gonna own me
Stargaze while I'm rollin' on trees
Comes cheap, got nothing but a twenty on me, on me
Nothing ever comes for free
You can pay what you want
But you're never gonna own me
(Never gonna, never gonna)
You can pay what you want
But you're never gonna own me
(Never gonna, never gonna)
You can pay what you want
But you're never gonna own me

I know that you probably wish
That I would just back down
Would that make you happy?
But you should know that
I would rather die
Than to watch you have that finale
'Cause like, you love having the power
You think I'm such a flower
My petals are poison that you smoke on 'em
Fuck that, let you choke on 'em
Make you learn from 'em
I hope you grow from this
More than a little bit
But it ain't the last one

Car chase, got the Devil on me
Can't see, got nothing but a twenty on me, on me
Nothing ever comes for free
You can pay what you want
But you're never gonna own me
Stargaze while I'm rollin' on trees
Comes cheap, got nothing but a twenty on me, on me
Nothing ever comes for free
You can pay what you want
But you're never gonna own me
(Never gonna, never gonna)
You can pay what you want
But you're never gonna own me
(Never gonna, never gonna)
You can pay what you want
But you're never gonna own me
