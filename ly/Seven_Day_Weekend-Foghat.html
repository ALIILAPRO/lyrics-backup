Oh yeah! Alright!

I had myself a good job in the city,
Pushin' a pen and talkin' on the phone.
The money was good but the work was such a big drag,
I thought that my brain would turn to stone.

But I ain't gonna work no more, I've got better things to do, I do,
I need a seven day weekend, spend some time with you, mmm hmm.

They told me if I stayed on for a lifetime,
I'd be an office manager some day.
But my heart was never in the right place,
I only went there for the pay.

But I ain't gonna work no more, I've got better things to do, mmm hmm,
I need a seven day weekend, spend some time with you, Oh yeah.

Well on Friday, the weekend rolls around,
Saturday, I'm gonna rock this town.
On Sunday, won't have to worry no more,
'Cause Monday ain't so bad when there's no work in store.

I guess the money comes in handy,
It helps me pay the bills and rent.
But if I stay too long on this job,
I'll wonder where my time all went.

But I ain't gonna work no more, I've got better things to do, doo-bah-doo.
I need a seven day weekend, spend some time with you. Oh come on!

{Erik/Paul Butterfield - Solo}
Whoo!

Well Tuesday, I'll hang out the beach,
Wednesday, this boy can not be reached.
Thursday, I'll stand out in the rain,
When Friday comes, I'll start all over again.

But I ain't gonna work no more, I've got better things to do, you know I do!
I need a seven day weekend, spend some time with you, mmm hmm.
I need a seven day weekend, spend some time with you.
I need a seven day weekend, spend some time with you, oh yeah!
