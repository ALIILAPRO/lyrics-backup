		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Get in my car, I'll drive you through the canyon 
breathe in Topanga for the day 
And when we reach the ocean, and we can't go further west 
we'll keep driving anyway

I'll take you down to Dollymount
And we'll fuck behind the dunes
I'll kiss your mouth all whiskey breath
and then I'll leave your heart in ruins

Maybe we should meet in the middle 
Maybe we could find a little city no one knows 
And if we just gave us a minute on our own
Maybe we could call it home

Forget the stars of Hollywood 
or big old houses in Bel Air
I can introduce you to the angels of my city 
but we'll find them anywhere 

I'll drag you round town by your ear
Still wringing from the rain
I'll buy you chips and tea and beer
And then I'll crush your heart again

Maybe we should meet in the middle 
Maybe we could find a little city no one knows 
And if we just gave us a minute on our own
a minute on our own
Maybe we could call it home
Maybe we could call it home
Maybe we could call it home
