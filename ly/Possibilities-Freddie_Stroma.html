		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't break my heart before I give it to you
Don't tell me no before I ask you to
Don't say it doesn't fit before you try it on
There's too much to lose to be wrong

And it feels like there's something here
But I wanna see it before it disappears
And if there's something real between me and you
Well are we both open to

All these possibilities
So many little possibilities
Right in front of us
Close enough to touch
And far enough to have some time to see

All these possibilities
Oh these possibilities
Are written in the stars
We are who we are baby
And I can't help but think that possibly
There's possibility
