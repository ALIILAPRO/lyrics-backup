		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One of us was married
To an ex-marine with a blonde down the block
He said commitment's scary
Then he left her alone with a house and a dog so
So she ran to daddy
And he said, "That man's a loser, call your friends up"
And we pulled a chair up

Oh, pass your phone to the right (to the right)
Text an ex-love "goodbye"

It's another sad girl summer
Flowers on the side of the road
Traveling beside each other
No one has to dance on their own
Oh-oh, so
Take my hand and
Lose his number
You don't have to have another
Sad girl summer
Raise your glass, let it go

One of us is messy
She got dumped by he-who-won't-be-mentioned
She's vodka Coke unsteady
So we're secretly staging an intervention
Change your shoes, get ready
That boy is such a loser
Put your hair up
And she pulls a chair up

Oh, pass your phone to the right (to the right)
Text an ex-love "goodbye"

It's another sad girl summer
Flowers on the side of the road
Traveling beside each other
No one has to dance on their own, oh-oh, so
Take my hand and lose his number
You don't have to have another
Sad girl summer
Raise your glass, let it go

Find your lip gloss
Blow a kiss
Forget the boy
Ever existed
Find your lip gloss
Blow a kiss
Forget the boy
Ever existed

Pass your phone to the right (to the right)
Text an ex-love "goodbye"

It's another sad girl summer
Flowers on the side of the road
Traveling beside each other
No one has to dance on their own, oh-oh, so
Take my hand (take my hand)
And lose his number (lose his number)
You don't have to have another
Sad girl summer
Raise your glass, let it go

Let it go
