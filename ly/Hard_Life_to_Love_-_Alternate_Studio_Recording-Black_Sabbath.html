		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Livin' in the fast lane is easy
Till you run out of road
Friends will turn to strangers
When you're out of control
A slip of the tongue when
It's done, is often hard to
See it through
So never let your words be lies
Or they'll come looking for you

It's a hard life to love

For the price of glory you left
And threw your fortunes away
Never really cared too much for
The job or the pay

You're standing in the rain with
No cover but you never complain
You're an angry young man face to
Face but your mirrors insane
It's a hard life to love

I'm simply refusing a part in your world
And I see how it burns
See how it burns
And you're simply denying the fact
That you're blind and I see no more
I see red - I only see red

Think of all the times I was
Hurting but you felt no pain
Think of all the lies you told me
Again and again
And still you see the truth
From those who continue to lie
And now you're seeking life
From those who are living to die
It's a hard life to love

I'm simply refusing a part in your world
And I see how it burns
See how it burns
And you're simply denying the fact
That you're blind and I see no more
I see red - I only see red

Livin' in the fast lane ain't easy
When you run out of road
Friends will turn to strangers
When you've nowhere to go
Don't give a damn when you're lost
Cause you'll die from it all
Laws were made to be broken
And you do it for the thrill of it all
It's a hard life to love
It's a hard life to love
