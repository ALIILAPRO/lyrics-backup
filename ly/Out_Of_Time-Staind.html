		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I could rewrite the story without all the glory
Would you still see the ending?
Was something under the surface 
That serves me no purpose?
I need a break from the bending

Blinded by the madness
No point getting past it
Penance for my crimes
Don't wanna fade off in the distance
Push me passed the limits
Am I out of-
Am I out of time?

I take it all as an omen, the pages feel broken
We still can change how it's written
Is it hopeless, too out of focus
To see through the past?

Blinded by the madness
No point getting past it
Penance for my crimes
Don't wanna fade off in the distance
Push me passed the limits
Am I out of-
Am I out of time?

Is it hopeless, too out of focus
To see through the past

Blinded by the madness
No point getting past it
Penance for my crimes
Don't wanna fade off in the distance
Push me passed the limits
Am I out of-
Am I out of time?

Blinded by the madness
No point getting past it
Penance for my crimes
Don't wanna fade off in the distance
Push me passed the limits
Am I out of-
Am I out of time?
