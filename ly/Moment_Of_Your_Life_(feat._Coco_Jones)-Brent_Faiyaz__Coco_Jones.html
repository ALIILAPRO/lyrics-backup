		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You looking better than you ever did
If you told me the secret, I would spread that shit
To every girl that I meet
So they would know how to be

That shit tastes fresher than a peppermint
If you want me to kiss it, I'm not hesitant
I know you're kissing me back
Just like that

And I got every other thing that I need and want but you
And I've been wanting you, so what you wanna do
Tonight?
Make this the moment of your life
And I got every other thing that I need and want, but you
And I've been wanting you, so what you wanna do
Tonight?
Make this the moment of your life

Tonight, babe
Boy, you look better than you ever did
I'll show you my secrets, can you handle it?
I don't wanna hide
Always been a good girl, but I got a bad side
Can I show you, baby?
I'ma guarantee you won't forget
I don't wanna taste, I want the whole damn thing
I don't wanna fight
How I feel with you, it feel right
What you on for the night, baby?

And I got every other thing that I need and want but you (you)
And I've been wanting you, so what you wanna do (what you wanna do?)
Tonight?
Make this the moment of your life (life)
And I got every other thing that I need and want from you (baby)
And I've been wanting you, so what you wanna do (baby)
Tonight?
I'll make this the moment of your life

Do you right, there's nothing like you and I
Boy, do me right, and if you like, stay the night
If you don't mind, you should try to stay the night
Boy, I don't mind, and if you like, stay the night

And I got every other thing that I need and want but you
And I've been wanting you (now what you wanna do?)
So what you wanna do 
Tonight?
(You know what I wanna do)
Make this the moment of your life (make this the moment, baby)
I got every other thing that I need and want but you (yeah, yeah, yeah)
And I've been wanting you, so what you wanna do (yeah)
Tonight?
Make this the moment of your life
