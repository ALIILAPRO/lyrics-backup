		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  These days, I'm not goin'
See, the comfort I tried to shake's only growin'
I don't know which way to play these card I'm always holdin'
Well, I thought by givin' my hand a break, I would know then

Burn me once, shame on you
Burn me twice and the blame walks for you
He thought it'd be nice to hold the eyes I can't see
And if you burn me three times, then the blame's on me

You see, my heart's been open
What once was a place for all those fickle boys to leave a hole in
But I've met a good man and all I want is to hold him
Close to my chest, much like these cards, it feels like I'm foldin'

Burn me once, shame on you
Burn me twice and the blame walks for you
He thought it'd be nice to hold the eyes I can't see
And if you burn me three times, then the blame's on me
Burn me once, shame on you
Burn me twice and the blame walks for you
He thought it'd be nice to hold the eyes I can't see
And if you burn me three times, then the blame's on me
And if you burn me three times, then the blame's on me
