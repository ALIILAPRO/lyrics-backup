		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't you fall for me, girl
I'm not the right kind
I'm a bad man
I will do all I can to keep you by my side
Just 'cause I know it feels right

Explain every story
Not boring
Girl, I'll be the only thing up when you're dropping
From purpose
Present and future
Hi Mr. President, a pleasure to meet you
Hoping for my presence 'cause it's making a feature
Working on instinct like an extinct creature
Hair's all dark and the ends got bleaches
Street lamps lit like they're trying to teach us

I've seen this scene before, real life
The nature wrote the score, my lines
Look into your eyes and

I'm not a good guy
I'm not a good guy
But I know you're mine (bang)
But I know you're mine (bang bang)
I'm not a good guy
I'm not a good guy
But I know you're mine (bang)
But I know you're mine (bang bang)
