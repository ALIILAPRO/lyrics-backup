		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Have you ever done anything like this before?
Have you ever done anything like this before?
If you've never done anything like this before
Then you haven't been alive

Have you ever shut all the open doors?
Have you ever just walked on out on your own?
Have you ever just lost your mind when you try to unwind
Or are you coming right back for more?

I'm here tonight
Promise me you'll hold me 'til I die
I'm by your side
Promise me it's gonna
Promise me it's gonna be alright

Ah-oh, ah-oh, ah-oh, ah-oh-oh-oh
Promise me it's gonna be alright
Ah-oh, ah-oh, ah-oh, ah-oh-oh-oh
Promise me it's gonna be alright
(Promise me it's gonna be alright)

Have you ever been alone too much?
Have you ever prayed for human touch?
Have you ever just lost a little part of you
To find a little something new?

Cross my heart
'Til the sky turns red in the sunrise
Since you told me everything's alright
Ah-oh, ah-oh, ah-oh, ah-oh-oh-oh
Since you told me everything's alright
Ah-oh, ah-oh, ah-oh, ah-oh-oh-oh
Promise me it's gonna be alright

I'm here tonight
Promise me you'll hold me till I die
I'm by your side
Promise me it's gonna
Promise me it's gonna
Promise me it's gonna be alright

Alright
Cross my heart
'Til the sky turns red in the sunrise
Promise me it's gonna be alright
(Be alright)

Alright
