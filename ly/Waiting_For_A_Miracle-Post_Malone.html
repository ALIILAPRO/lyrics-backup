		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh my God
Just take the firearm from me
Holy fuck
I understand that I'm too weak

Oh my God
Just shut me up for heaven's sake
So I load one round
I'm scared to die while I'm awake

So I close my eyes
And wait for a miracle

And everything done for the dead 
After they're dead 
Is for the living
And everything done while they're dead 
Goddammit 
That's our decision
I kept my eyes closed, it was easy 
Now I see it with perfect vision
And everything done for the dead 
After they're dead 
Is for the living

Fuck me up
Fuck it, get fucked up, hey
Fuck me up, yeah
And stay fucked up
