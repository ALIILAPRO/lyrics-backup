		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I’ve been thinking about all that we are
And what you mean to me
Little spaces in my heart 
Where I find you underneath 
But I hope that time can change
How you’re leaving this way
But I know that it’s for the best
But I wish I could start again
 
Slow-motion heartache
Hate to feel like this
When it feels like this darling
Slow-motion heartache
Hate to feel like this
When it feels like this darling
 
I’ve been dreaming about us in the light
Of what we used to be
All these pictures in my mind
That never seem to leave  
But there’s nowhere I can go
That makes it easier
But I know when I fall asleep
That you’ll be there here with me
 
Slow motion heartache
Hate to feel like this
When it feels like this darling
Slow motion heartache
Hate to feel like this
When it feels like this darling
 
I wanna go wherever you go
Following you through this
I wanna feel the way that you feel
Rolling through thunder
 
Slow motion heartache
Hate to feel like this
When it feels like this darling
Slow motion heartache
Hate to feel like this
When it feels like this darling
