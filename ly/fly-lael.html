		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Left me in the dark
Can't find my way
Why's it so hard
For you to stay?
Didn't mean to be a bother
Did I?
Please just hold me close and we'll fly
I don't want to hurt you I'd die
Or did I?
Can we just fly?
Fly away to Vegas
We can take the spaceship
Up and over hills and far away
I could just die
Without you up in my arms
I will do you no harm
Come down with me and stay
Stay
Stay
Free for all I'm free falling
Won't be here in the morning
Didn't mean to be a bother
Did I?
Please just hold me close and we'll fly
I don't want to hurt you I'd die
Or did I?
Can we just fly?
Fly away to Vegas
We can take the spaceship
Up and over hills and far away
I could just die
Without you up in my arms
I will do you no harm
Come down with me and stay
Stay
Stay
Don't you fly away
Don't you fly away from me
Don't you fly away from me
