		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby Gravy drip too much the weather rainy yeah
Only find me whippin' in a pink Mercedes yeah
Girly came to study 'cause I know she brainy yeah
Seven tracks a week bitch I'm workin' daily yeah

Where's my horse
I can't find my horse, yeah

Ayy
Booty thicker than a landfill
Head game stupid so I gave that bitch an Advil
Aye then I smash it like a anvil
Got too many bands change my address to Bandsville

Baby gravy back
We never left
Gucci on my backpack momma think I'm blessed
Bitch we fuckin' back
We never left
Cartier glass got some diamonds on my specs

We fuckin' spazzin' baby
Spazz Pizzazz
Razzmatazz
I'ma fuck Cameron Diaz baby

Dazzle dazzle shine
These jewels on me shaky yeah
Bitch I'm doin' fine
Bank statements so healthy yeah
Sussy boy you must be trippin' how you think I'm lazy
Got my money up and saved that shit
I did it all so safely yeah

Baby did it safely
But I'm Gravy
You know what that mean
Bitch it's fuck you, pay me
I don't want Mercedes
I don't want your ladies
You ain't fuckin' ready part 2 Baby Gravy

Baby gravy back
We never left
Gucci on my backpack momma think I'm blessed
Bitch we fuckin' back
We never left
Cartier glasses got some diamonds on my specks
