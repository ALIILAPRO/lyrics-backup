		  (FBeat producing all the heat)
Blueface baby, yeah, aight

First class what I spent on the shoes
Baguettes guaranteed I'm getting this boo
Ooh ooh, baby blow it like soup
I'm so hot I get paid to be cool
First class what I spent on the shoes
Baguettes guaranteed I'm getting this boo
Ooh ooh, baby blow it like soup
I'm so hot I get paid to be cool

You not from my set then get out my section
Fuck your birthday, my presence is a present
What's a dollar to a nigga with a million?
Bought it just to compensate for her feelings
Broken hearts, Gucci heels just to heal it
She gon' have to deal with whoever I deal with
They say it's cheaper to keep her
I'm too rich for a commitment
I'm a man with a mansion
Can't forget to mention handsome
Never ran with a random
My pinky ring look like a Samsung
My only outcome is income
You fucked my bitch, nigga which one?
Huh? Which one?
Huh? Which one? (Yeah, 'aight)

First class what I spent on the shoes
Baguettes guaranteed I'm getting this boo
Ooh ooh, baby blow it like soup
I'm so hot I get paid to be cool
First class what I spent on the shoes
Baguettes guaranteed I'm getting this boo
Ooh ooh, baby blow it like soup
I'm so hot I get paid to be cool

I love the drip, I get paid to be cool
She love to strip, make it shake for the blues
My car drop, it ain't come with a roof
Porsche socks and it came with the coupe
I fucked her last night, she was the truth
First class flight, I flew out your boo
Her head right but that pussy was loose
Told her hitchhike when I bought her some boots
Rich nigga, we been eatin' at Ruth's
Five-star dinner for the mu-fuckin' crew
That's a rental, that's why ain't nobody fooled
Shot your Sprinter up, you know how we do
Southside nigga and the color is blue
One on one, I ain't come here to lose
Gunna Gunna bought a new Jimmy Choo
In the penthouse fuckin' hoes by the twos
Told 'em get out, called a whole 'nother group
I brought the mic out, I ain't go in the booth
Ain't tryna fight it out, I'ma just shoot
Three thousand dollars what I spent on the shoes

First class what I spent on the shoes
Baguettes guaranteed I'm getting this boo
Ooh ooh, baby blow it like soup
I'm so hot I get paid to be cool
First class what I spent on the shoes
Baguettes guaranteed I'm getting this boo
Ooh ooh, baby blow it like soup
I'm so hot I get paid to be cool

I'm so hot I get paid to be cool
20 or better just for me to walk through
Red bottoms but I'm painting them blue
These ain't Louis Vuitton's, these Christian Loub's
Bar Mitzvah on me, nothin' but jewels
Baguettes guaranteed I'm getting this boo
Baby blowin' dick just like a flute
Mmm, mmm, mmm, ooh, ooh
Play with the dick just like peek-a-boo
Walk in the club and I pick a boo
Fuck 'em both 'cause I don't wanna choose
They gon' holla for a dollar
Fuck it, I'm rich, bitch
I bought the ugly Balenciagas
Prada always fix the problem
Glock knock him out, designer

First class what I spent on the shoes
Baguettes guaranteed I'm getting this boo
Ooh ooh, baby blow it like soup
I'm so hot I get paid to be cool
First class what I spent on the shoes
Baguettes guaranteed I'm getting this boo
Ooh ooh, baby blow it like soup
I'm so hot I get paid to be cool

FBeat producing all the heat
