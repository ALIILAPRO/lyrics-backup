		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I ask myself, "Is this shit real?"
I contemplate 'bout how I feel
But you make it way too hard to think
That this could be what true love is

I don't want wait another minute for ya
Oh, you got me fallin' from the ceilin' for ya
Knew right from the start there was no limit to ya
And I'm catchin' feelin's, baby

You give me feels and I
Know that I know, that I know that it's real
You give me, you give me feels
You give me feels and I
Know that I know, that I know that it's real
You give me, you give me feels

It took a lot of hard shit just to learn
How not to break down and stop, baby
No matter what I seen in the past
I won't let it impact how we grow now, baby
I can't let it slip away or drift away
Can't go to waste, go to waste, uh
I say it straight, straight to your face
Won't contemplate, yeah, contemplate that, baby

I don't want wait another minute for ya (no, no)
Oh, you got me fallin' from the ceilin' for ya (oh, yeah)
Knew right from the start there was no limit for me
And I'm catchin' feelin's, baby

You give me feels and I (yeah)
Know that I know, that I know that it's real (that it's real)
You give me, you give me feels (feels)
You give me feels and I
Know that I know, that I know that it's real
You give me, you give me feels (oh)

You give me feels (you give me feels)
You give me feels (feels), you give me feels
You give me feels (you, you, you, you, you, you, uh)
You give me feels (feels), you give me feels

You give me feels and I (oh)
Know that I know, that I know that it's real (that it's real)
You give me, you give me feels
You give me feels and I
Know that I know, that I know that it's real (know that it's real)
You give me, you give me feels (oh)
You give me feels
