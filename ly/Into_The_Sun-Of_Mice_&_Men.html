		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It called
You answered
And it took you far away from me, here

Turning another page
Brings us closer to the ending
You're further and further away
And it feels just like

Like walking into the sun
Like walking into the sun
Every step I take without you

Hands pressed against the glass
Of the infinite divide
Feeling like I'm trapped
On the other side

Turning another page
Brings us closer to the ending
You're further and further away
And it feels just like

Like walking into the sun
Like walking into the sun
Every step I take without you
Takes me further and further away
And it feels just like
Like walking into the sun

Every step I take without you
(Every step I take without you) oh

Hands pressed against the glass
Of the infinite divide
Feeling like I'm trapped
On the other side

Turning another page
Brings us closer to the ending
You're further and further away
And it feels just like

Like walking into the sun
Like walking into the sun
Every step I take without you
Takes me further and further away
And it feels just like
Like walking into the sun

Every step I take without you
(Every step I take without you)
