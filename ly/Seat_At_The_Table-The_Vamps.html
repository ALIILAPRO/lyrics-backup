		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A forever flame that's burnin'
A candle that won't go out
Nothing ever changes
In this town
Step off the train station
The pubs are all spillin' out
Seein' all the same old faces
In this town

And I get so nostalgic
Caught up in all this magic

So let's raise a glass
To future and past
To cheers to love lost
A smile for every teardrop
A flicker of light
On these Christmas nights
It's like you're here still
We'll always keep a seat at the table, mm

I can still see your footprints
Outside in the snow
It's like they almost tell me
That you're home
And we play the same old songs but
We only play them once a year
Even though it's been so long
It's like you're still here

And I get so nostalgic
Caught up in all this magic

So let's raise a glass
To future and past
To cheers to love lost
A smile for every teardrop
The brothers still fight
On these Christmas nights
It's like you're here still
We'll always keep a seat at the table, mm

Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh
We'll always keep a seat at-

So let's raise a glass
To future and past
To cheers to love lost
A smile for every teardrop
You're here with us
Cigarettes, and no trust
In broadsheet papers
I'm all about the decorations
An old soul never changin'
Who'll always keep a seat at the table, mm
