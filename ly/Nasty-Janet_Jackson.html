		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Gimme a beat

Sittin' in the movie show, thinkin' nasty thoughts, huh
Better be a gentleman, or you turn me off, huh
That's right
A-let me tell it

Nasty, nasty boys, don't mean a thing, huh
Oh, you nasty boys
Nasty, nasty boys, don't ever change, huh
Oh, you nasty boys

I don't like no nasty car, I don't like a nasty food, huh (ooh, ooh, yeah)
The only nasty thing I like is the nasty groove, huh
Will this one do?
Uh-huh, I know, sing

Nasty, nasty boys, don't mean a thing, huh
Oh, you nasty boys
Nasty, nasty boys, don't ever change, huh
Oh, you nasty boys
Nasty, nasty boys, give me your nasty groove, huh
Oh, you nasty boys
Nasty, nasty boys, let me see your nasty body move, huh
Oh, you nasty boys

I could learn to like this
Listen up

I'm not a prude (no)
I just want some respect (that's right)
So close the door if you want me to respond (ooh, ooh, yeah)
'Cause privacy is my middle name
My last name is Control
No, my first name ain't baby
It's Janet, Miss Jackson if you're nasty

Nasty, nasty boys, don't mean a thing
Oh, you nasty boys
Nasty, nasty boys, don't ever change, huh
Oh, you nasty boys

Nasty boys don't mean a thing
Oh, you nasty boys
Don't mean a thing to me, uh
Nasty, don't mean a thing, uh
Oh, you nasty boys, uh

I love this part

Hey
Who's that thinkin' nasty thoughts? (Nasty boys)
Who's that in that nasty car? (Nasty boys)
Who's that eating that nasty food? (Nasty boys)
Who's jamming to my nasty groove? (Nasty boys)

Ladies?
Nasty boys
Don't mean a thing
Oh, you nasty boys
