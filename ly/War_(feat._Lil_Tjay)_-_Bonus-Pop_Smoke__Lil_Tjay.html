		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Woo!) if I want it, I'ma grab it (blaow!)
If I want it, I'ma have it (woo! Woo!)
Christian Dior, Christian Dior
I'm up in all this lust

I make a call (woo! Woo!)
I make a call, it's war
And nigga you can check the score
We up on the board (woo! Woo!)
And we all living lavish
If I want it I'ma have it
I make a call (woo! Woo!)
I make a call, it's war
And nigga you can check the score
We up on the board (woo! Woo!)
And we all living lavish
If I want it, I'ma have it

My niggas wit' it
Money floor, run up them digits
I know niggas mad that we did it
Say it, we live it
Morals, we'll never forget it
I ever get booked, I'ma cricket
Get it and flip it
Henny right here, I'ma sip it
You try me it's shots at your biscuit
24 hip it
I'ma just 24 hip it 'cause bro said, "Don't ever forget it"
Gang with me, anywhere I pop out know the thang with me
Every nigga here with me gon' bang with me
Try your luck and bro goin' insane with me
Bodies dropping that shit ain't a thing to me
Smokin' deadies, I'm rollin' up lame niggas
Couple niggas here with me done changed niggas
Clean the mess, we leave the remains, nigga
Surely business ain't playin' no games
Fuck all this fame, nigga
You will get flamed, nigga
Don't you front, I got aim, nigga
I saw homis that fuck with my brain, nigga
I be feelin' like goin' insane, nigga
I just got me a check, now my chain bigger
You gon' die for the stain, nigga
When you sent me the addy', I came, nigga
Only me and my main niggas
You ain't really for static don't play, nigga
We could hit you today, nigga
If you makin' your bed better lay, nigga
There ain't too much to say, nigga

I make a call (woo! Woo!)
I make a call, it's war
And nigga you can check the score
We up on the board (woo! Woo!)
And we all living lavish
If I want it I'ma have it
I make a call (woo! Woo!)
I make a call, it's war
And nigga you can check the score
We up on the board (woo! Woo!)
And we all living lavish
If I want it I'ma have it (look)

I got 30 shots for any nigga who want it (flex)
Me and Tjay we be huntin' (woo!)
I don't talk much 'cause niggas know how we comin' (bah)
Niggas know I be dumpin' (grra)
Glock 9, dumpin' (dumpin')
Run Ricky, runnin' (runnin')
Blue face, hunnids (hunnids)
Know I'm the bill collector (woo!)
Pull up, what's crackin'? Go get to blastin'
Talk on my name and we wildin' out
All the opps in the spliff, ashin' (ashin')
Puff, puff, ain't no passin' (passin')
You gon' end up in a casket (casket)
'Cause niggas know what we into
I get to drillin', I'm sittin', I'm killin'
I'm sittin' if I get the feelin' (you will be dead)
I call Trav war bet he clap 2s (oh)
Sip Remy like he Papoose
Have him stay still like a statue (statue)
Have him inked in like a tattoo
If I run down, he a goner
Headshot, no warnin' (know we run down, little nigga)
It's a man down when it's pourin' (right now)
Gang spinnin', early mornin'
I don't get mad, I get money (flex)
What you lookin' at? Little dummy (what you lookin' at?)
I'll still buck your teeth like I'm Bunny (blaow!)
And I backed the Wraith off of nothin'

I make a call (woo! Woo!)
I make a call, it's war
And nigga you can check the score
We up on the board (woo! Woo!)
And we all living lavish
If I want it I'ma have it
I make a call (woo! Woo!)
I make a call, it's war
And nigga you can check the score
We up on the board (woo! Woo!)
And we all living lavish
If I want it I'ma have it
