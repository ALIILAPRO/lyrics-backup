		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well I'm not a vampire but I feel like one
Sometimes I sleep all day
'Cause I hate the sun-light
My hands are always shaking
Body's always aching and the dark is when I feed

Well I can lure any woman that I want to in my bed
With me and whiskey seems to be my holy water
And mothers better lock your doors and hide your daughters

'Cause I'm insane
I can feel it in my bones
Coursing through my veins
When did I become so cold?
For goodness sakes
Where is my self control?
If home is where my heart is
Then my heart has lost all hope

Well I'm not a zombie but I feel like one today
Self induced comatose, chemical daze
My head is always spinning from this dizzy, blurry vision
And my stomach has had enough
I feel like a lady that is pregnant with a baby
'Cause I'm always throwing up

Hi, My name is Ronnie
I'm an addict
And daddy should've never raised me on Black Sabbath

I'm insane
I can feel it in my bones
Coursing through my veins
When did I become so cold?
For goodness sakes
Where is my self control?
If home is where my heart is
Then my heart has lost all hope

When will you mortals believe? (He's not a vampire)
I just want the world to bleed (he's not a vampire)
Lust at the sight of your blood (he's not a vampire)
I swear to God, I am not a (he is not a)

(He is not a)
 
So God bless all of you now
'Cause I'm going straight to Hell (straight to Hell)
And I'm taking you down with me
Because you know damn well

So I sharpen my teeth 'cause I love the way it feels
When I sink into your skin and draw the only thing that's real
You don't believe me
Should I write it in blood?
You better drive that fucking stake right down my heart and try to run
Motherfucker, I'm a vampire!
 
And I'm insane
I can feel it in my bones
Coursing through my veins, when did I become so cold?
For goodness sakes, where is my self-control?
If home is where my heart is, then my heart has lost all
Heart has fucking lost all
Heart has lost all hope
(He's lost all hope)
(He's lost all hope) All hope
(He's lost all hope)
My heart has lost all hope
