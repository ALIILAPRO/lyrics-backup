		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I fall in love
I usually take my time
Hoping it gets better
Swipe left, swipe right
To fill all of these lonely nights
It's just empty pleasure

Drunk text to come over
But we don't talk when were sober
The fairy tale I can live without
The white dress and the alter
That diamond in your ring
That's all anyone cares about

Drunk text to come over
But we don't talk when were sober
The fairy tale I can live without
The white dress and the alter
That diamond in your ring
That's all anyone cares about, yeah

Loving you, you, you
Loving you, you, you
Loving you, you, you
Loving you, you, you
Loving you, you, you
Loving you, you, you
Loving you, you, you
Loving you, you, you

When I fall in love
I usually lose my mind
Hoping it gets better
Swipe left, swipe right
Even people who ain't my type
It's just empty pleasure

Drunk text to come over
But we don't talk when were sober
The fairy tale I can live without
The white dress and the alter
That diamond in your ring
That's all anyone cares about, yeah

Loving you, you, you
Loving you, you, you
Loving you, you, you
Loving you, you, you
Loving you, you, you
Loving you, you, you
Loving you, you, you
Loving you, you, you

When I fall in love
I usually change my mind
Never understanding
White lies, face times
Is there someone else on your mind?
Always end up stranded
Playing with our emotions
Heartbroken we're frozen
A fairy tale I can live without
White fence and a real job
We waste away in the suburbs
That's all anyone else cares about (that's all anyone else cares about)

Drunk text to come over
But we don't talk when were sober
The fairy tale I can live without
The white dress and the alter
That diamond in your ring
That's all anyone else cares about (that's all anyone else cares about)

And I don't need love
I just need us
I don't need love
I just need us

Loving you, you, you
Loving you, you, you
Loving you, you, you
Loving you, you, you
Loving you, you, you
Loving you, you, you
Loving you, you, you
Loving you, you, you
