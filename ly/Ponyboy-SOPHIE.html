		  Ponyboy
Pony (pony) boy (boy, boy)
Pony (pony) boy (boy) boy

Lock up the door
Put the pony on all fours
Crack down the whip
Make the pony bite the bit
Spit on my face
Put the pony in his place
I am your toy
Just a little ponyboy

Pony (pony) boy (boy)
You can call me ponyboy (boy)
Pony (pony) boy (boy)
Just a little ponyboy (boy)
Pony (pony) boy (boy)
You can call me ponyboy (boy)
Pony (pony) boy (boy)
Just a little ponyboy (boy)

Step on my clutch
Can you feel the hot blood rush?
Switch out the light
Make the pony trot two times
Pull up the reins
Make the pony grease his mane
Harness your toy
Just a little ponyboy
(Now gimme that-that)

Pony (pony) boy (boy)
He's my little ponyboy (boy)
Pony (pony) boy (boy)
So I treat him like a ponyboy (boy)
Pony (pony) boy (boy)
He's my little ponyboy (boy)
Pony (pony) boy (boy)
So I treat him like a ponyboy (boy)

Oh-oh, oh-oh
Pony-ponyboy
It's the one then he did it
Mm-mm-mm
Oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh
Pony-ponyboy
My baby boy, ponyboy
He is just a pony
She is just a pony
They is just a pony
Pony-ponyboy

Pony (pony) boy (boy)
He's my little ponyboy
Pony (pony) boy (boy)
So I treat him like a ponyboy (boy)
Pony (pony) boy (boy)
He's my little ponyboy (boy)
Pony (pony) boy (boy)
So I treat him like a ponyboy (boy)
Ponyboy, boy
Ponyboy, boy
Ponyboy, boy
Ponyboy, boy
