		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  Blue
Strange colour blue
Sixteen tons on the move
Blue
Strange colour blue
Coming back to you
Pushing through
Pouring rain
Nearly there
Nearly there
Oh blue 

Blue
Strange colour blue
Sixteen tons on the move
Hey little mister driver man
Keep your head up
We are nearly there
I am racing
Outside and below myself
Nearly forgot myself there
Nearly there, yeah

Oh everybody's sleeping now
An industrial silence, and
And the rain, it will keep hammering down from overhead
Now there's a blue, blue strange colour blue
Let me dream of me and you
Oh while the rain keeps coming down
Hard
Oh running down the window
Like a vein on my arm
Oh running down the window
Like a vein on my arm, yeah

This is how we do it
This is how we do it
This is how we do it
Nearly there
This is how we do it
This is how we do it
This is how we do it
Nearly there

Oh blue
Strange colour, a colour blue
Yeah a colour blue
Oh blue, blue, blue, yeah
Strange colour, a colour blue
Yeah, a colour blue

Oh blue, blue, blue, yeah
Strange colour, a colour blue
Oh, a colour blue

Hey little mister driver man
Keep your head up
We are nearly there
Nearly there
