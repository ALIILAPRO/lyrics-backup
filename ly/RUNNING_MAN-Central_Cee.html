		  Running man (doin' ? fitness)
Running man, running man
Running man, running man
Running man, running man, yeah
Running man, running man

I want the money a big bit
You want the money a little bit
And my lil' woe got her nipple pierced
I'm wondering how to deal with it
Now I'm living my movie I'm living it
I dive in the pussy and swim in it
Don't fuck with the eye on the pyramid
Don't fuck with the eye on the pyramid

Don't you know man
She want a big man
Not a little boy
Don't you understand?
Get the pack and do the running man
Get the pack and do the running man (running man, running man)
Get the pack and do the running man (running man, running man)
Get the pack and do the running man (running man, running man)
Get the pack and do the running man (running man, running man)
Get the pack and do the running man

Fuck your bitch and do the running man
Hit a lick go meet the ganja man
I'm in the pit with a bunch of man (yeah)
No point in thinking 'bout touching man
Let her meet the plug
Now she thinking about cuffing man
I'm sorry how many's done for that
I'll leave that shit for another man

Get the pack and do the running man (running man, running man)
Get the pack and do the running man (running man, running man)
Get the pack and do the running man (running man, running man)
Get the pack and do the running man (running man, running man)
Get the pack and do the running man (running man, running man)
Get the pack and do the running man (running man, running man)
Get the pack and do the running man (running man, running man)
Get the pack and do the running man

I can't show love to a ho
Definite no
I just got paid for a show
I did this all on my own
Shout out my bros
It was just us in the cold
Talk on my name and get smoked
Look at our boys on the road
This ain't a joke
825 for the coke
I'm fit for the roads
I'm fit for the storm and the snow

Just like my jewels, she cold and fancy
Bitch, I'm bold and bossy
Don't act a fool
My killers are active, yeah
Don't get to splashing
Leaving the school
Getting my cash in
Good with the numbers and maths
Don't know about you
I grind with a passion
If I see jakes do the dash

Get the pack and do the running man (yeah)
Get the pack and do the running man (running man, running man)
Get the pack and do the running man (running man, running man)
Get the pack and do the running man (running man, running man)
Get the pack and do the running man (I'm running, I'm running, I'm)
Get the pack and do the running man (running man, running man)
Get the pack and do the running man (running man, running man)
Get the pack and do the running man

Ain't got intentions for running back
I only run from the bully van
I heard them boys that they onto me
I'm here in real life not a hologram
Nah, you still ain't done shit
LYM we run shit
Now all the hotties wan' holla man
Now all the hotties wan' holla man
Generally don't give a fuck
Careful all over the house
You staying in anyone's house
Leave something dead in the house
Smell like something dead in the house
Bando where comes to bed, Martin G's
This ain't no regular amount
As soon as they come with their army
We airing them out
Trust me, we airing them out, we airing them out

(Get the pack and do the running man)
(Get the pack and do the running man)
(Get the pack and do the running man)
(Get the pack and do the running man)
(Get the pack and do the running man)
(Get the pack and do the running man)
(Get the pack and do the running man)
(Get the pack and do the running man)

Get the pack and do the running man (running man, running man)
Get the pack and do the running man (running man, running man)
Get the pack and do the running man (running man, running man)
Get the pack and do the running man (running man, running man)
Get the pack and do the running man (I'm running, I'm running, I'm)
Get the pack and do the running man (running man, running man)
Get the pack and do the running man (running man, running man)
Get the pack and do the running man
