		  Out

I been livin' a lie
They told me to never give in and
Fight for whatever you want in life
But what I really really want is a one way
Free ride right into the next
Life with the next knife
I see anywhere near me or in my vicinity
Count down the days

Out

I been livin' a lie
They told me to never give in and
Fight for whatever you want in life
But what I really really want is a one way
Free ride right into the next
Life with the next knife
I see anywhere near me or in my vicinity
Count down the days

(So many promises)
