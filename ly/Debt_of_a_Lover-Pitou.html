		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  for the
fi
rst time
I've not picked a side yet
within one week I've not yet decided
I am still waiting
waiting on blue
couldn't deny
he is taking good care
asking the questions
but I won't answer
shouldn't have to diminish
to increase the light
go back into the dark
so I can try
over and over and over
I have learned just to love
and not to slice
open oh open oh open
go back into the dark
so I can try
over and over and over
they all speak of another half
I've just started to see that I am one, and
I don't need someone to grow older
go back into the dark
so I can try
over and over and over
I have learned just to love
and not to slice
open oh open oh open
go back into the dark
so I can try
over and over and over
don’t just give me your heart
expecting mine
saying it’s the debt of a lover
saying it’s the debt of a lover
