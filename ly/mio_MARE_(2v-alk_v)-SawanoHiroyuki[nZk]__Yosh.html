		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey, what's up? My old hometown
Well... I'm doin' okay
but not very well, not so well
My life isn't the way
I hoped nor I planned for myself
Cannot say, but I have to say
Cannot save,
what I have had saved
for all my time
I never make it right
without you
Home sweet home
How do I look like through
your eyes?
Am I grown up enough?
Spread my wings,
put my soul in them cautiously
My dearest childhood won't lie,
I know that obviously
Now I'm feeling so smooth
Like as I can fly,
reachin' for the sky
Open my eyes, see my world
Hum some melodies
Hear my heart beating so loud
'cause of memories
How many smiles can I get?
While I spend my life
even myself out of breath?
By the way, my old hometown
Don't you know how she has been?
She alright? Is she right?
I know she's a tough girl,
but she has a fragile heart too
She might say,
what I have to say
Wanna save
what I could have saved
for all my time
You taught us we can live
how we are
Home sweet home
How do I look like through
your eyes?
Am I grown up enough?
Spread my wings,
put my soul in them cautiously
My dearest childhood won't lie,
I know that obviously
Now I'm feeling so smooth
Like as I can fly,
reachin' for the sky
Open my eyes, see my world
Hum some melodies
Hear my heart beating so loud
'cause of memories
How many smiles can I get?
While I spend my life
even myself out of breath?
You know, it's not a miracle
but meant to be
No, I can't stop cryin'
in joy or by nostalgia
But I don't care
So don't laugh at me, babe
II mio mare, ma che bel futuro
I swear, keep tryin' so
Won't give up anyway
Spread my wings,
put my soul in them cautiously
My dearest childhood won't lie,
I know that obviously
Now I'm feeling so smooth
Like as I can fly,
reachin' for the sky
Open my eyes, see my world
Hum some melodies
Hear my heart beating so loud
'cause of memories
How many smiles can I get?
While I spend my life
even myself out of breath?
You know, it's not a miracle
but meant to be
No, I can't stop cryin'
in joy or by nostalgia
But I don't care
So don't laugh at me, babe
