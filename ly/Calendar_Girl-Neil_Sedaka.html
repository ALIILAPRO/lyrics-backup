		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I love, I love, I love my calender girl
Yeah, sweet calender girl
I love, I love, I love my calender girl
On each and every day of the year

(January) you start the year off fine
(February) You're my little valentine
(March) I'm gonna march you down the aisle
(April) you're the Easter Bunny when you smile
Yeah, yeah, my heart's in a whirl
I love, I love, I love my little calender girl
Every day (every day), every day (every day) of the year
(Every day of the year)

(May) maybe if I ask your dad and mom
(June) they'll let me take you to the Junior Prom
(July) like a firecracker all aglow
(August) when you're on the beach you steal the show

Yeah, yeah, my heart's in a whirl
I love, I love, I love my little calendar girl
Every day (every day), every day (every day) of the year
(Every day of the year)
Ooh!

Yeah, yeah, my heart's in a whirl
I love, I love, I love my little calender girl
Every day (every day), every day (every day) of the year
Every day of the year
(September) I light the candles at your sweet sixteen
(October) Romeo and Juliet on Halloween
(November) I'll give thanks that you belong to me
(December) you're the present 'neath my Christmas tree

Yeah, yeah, my heart's in a whirl
I love, I love, I love my little calender girl
Every day (every day), every day (every day) of the year
(Every day of the year)
I love, I love, I love my calender girl
Yeah, sweet calendar girl
I love, I love, I love my calender girl
Yeah, sweet calendar girl
