		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Heart and soul took control
Took control of me
Paid my dues, spread the news
Hands across the sea

Put me down, turned me round
Turned me 'round to see
Marble halls, open doors
Someone found the key

And it's only what you do
That keeps coming back on you
And it's only what you say
That can give yourself away

Underground sight and sound
Human symphony
Heard the voice, had no choice
Needed to be free

Fly me high, touch the sky
Left the earth below
Heard the line, saw the sign
Knew which way to go

'cause it's easier to try
Than to prove it can't be done
And it's easier to stay
Than to turn around and run

It's a blue world
It takes somebody to help somebody
Oh, it's a blue world
It's a new world

It needs somebody to love somebody
Oh, it's a blue world

Heart and soul took control
Took control of me
Paid my dues, spread the news
Hands across the sea

Put me down, turned me round
Turned me round to see
Marble halls, open doors
Someone found the key

And it's only what you do
That keeps coming back on you
And it's only what you say
That can give yourself away

'cause it's easier to try
Than to prove it can't be done
And it's easier to stay
Than to turn around and run

It's a blue world
It takes somebody to help somebody
Oh, it's a blue world
It's a new world

It needs somebody to love somebody
Oh, it's a blue world
It's a blue world
It takes somebody to help somebody

Oh, it's a blue world
It's a new world
It needs somebody to love somebody
Oh, it's a blue world
