		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You know that some things were just always meant to be
Don't ask the other girls
Don't ask the other guys

Sometimes I wonder if you're ever gonna see
I'm not like the other girls
You're not like the other guys

I tell you I want you, but you don't listen to me
I guess all I can do is whisper in your ear
Ooh, your kisses taste so sweet
Can't resist it, stay with me
And promise not to wake me if it's all part of a dream
'Cause baby, it feels like heaven, mon cheri

Bonsoir, enchantée
Your hands-on my face
Embrasse-moi, mon soleil
Say you'd die for me, baby

Read my messages if you want I don't mind
I'm not like the other girls
You're not like the other guys
Hold me close 'cause it's too soon to say goodbye
You're some kind of beautiful
And you've got me in the sky

I tell you I want you but you don't listen to me
I guess all I can do is whisper in your ear
Ooh, your kisses taste so sweet
Can't resist it, stay with me
And promise not to wake me if it's all part of a dream
'Cause baby, it feels like heaven, mon chéri

Bonsoir, enchantée
Your hands-on my face
Embrasse-moi mon soleil
Say you'd die for me, baby

So long, la vie en rose
Even with the Midas touch
The things we love don't always turn to gold
But if we never try we'll never know
What we could be

Bonsoir, enchantée
Your hands on my face
Embrasse-moi mon soleil
Say you'd die for me, baby
