		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell me its okay
I think I just need to get away
Cause without you girl I've been MIA
Cause without you girl its just not the same
But Who's to blame
Damn

Kept the Molly in my pocket cause I can
This some big body shit this ain't no sedan
If our struggling to find out who I am
I flew to Europe just to find the fucking plan
Damn
I went up ten
When I bought the benz
Chilling with your foriegn friends
Oh she likes to spend
Being broke intolerant
Tryna show my dominance
Agh
I can bless ya
Tryna steal my image
Maybe they just see the picture
What you talking about girl
Don't ask for my insta
Haha
On my own
Fill this space
You can't hide
Babe I listen when you

Tell me its okay
I think I just need to get away
Cause without you girl I've been MIA
Cause without you girl its just not the same
But Who's to blame

Them numbers on the paper ain't enough
better raise it higher cause I know Im about to go
Funny cause they never showed
They ain't never showed no love
Not the type to go apologies
She the type to leave you on read before you comprimise
Type to get up all in your head
Then make you pick a side
Make you contradict what you said
With them pretty eyes
Damn
Apply the plan
Got that shit in motion
Im a different type of man
Don't get this shit twisted
Girl I know you just a fan
Still call you my misses
Baby tell me

Tell me its okay
I think I just need to get away
Cause without you girl I've been MIA
Cause without you girl its just not the same
But Who's to blame
Damn
