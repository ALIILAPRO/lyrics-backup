		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, how could you ever leave me without a chance to try?
How can I be sorry if I don't know the crime?
I should be mad 'cause you never told me why (told me why)
Still I can't seem to say goodbye

Ooh, yeah
When I try to fall back, I fall back to you (yeah)
When I talk to my friends I talk about you (yeah)
When the Hennessy's strong, all I see is you
Is you, is you

I'm good at overthinking, but I haven't even got this far
All I know is that my mind is in the back seat of your Corvette car
You got me at my baddest and you got me 'round your fingertip
Should be fed up with your bullshit, but everything about you, no, I can't resist

How could you ever leave me without a chance to try?
How can I be sorry if I don't know the crime?
I should be mad that you never told me why
Still I can't seem to say goodbye

Ooh, yeah
When I try to fall back, I fall back to you (yeah)
When I talk to my friends I talk about you (yeah)
When the jealousy's strong, all I see is you
Is you, is you, oh you, yeah
Ooh, yeah
No I haven't moved on but trust me I've tried (yeah)
If I give you a call don't hang up the line (yeah)
And when the Hennessy's strong, all I see is you
Is you, is you, oh you, yeah

When I try to fall back, I fall back to you 
When I talk to my friends I talk about you 
When the Hennessy's strong, all I see is you
Is you, oh

I see your face in every stranger, everywhere I go 
I hear your voice and conversations, every word you spoke 
Nearly blocked you on my phone about a thousand times
Yeah, I know I should say goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
Yeah, I know I should say goodbye

Ooh, yeah
When I try to fall back, I fall back to you (yeah)
When I talk to my friends I talk about you (yeah) 
When the Hennessy's strong, all I see is you
Is you, is you, oh you, yeah
Ooh, yeah
No I haven't moved on but trust me I've tried (yeah)
If I give you a call don't hang up the line (yeah)
When the Hennessy's strong, all I see is you
Is you, is you, oh you, yeah
