		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I told you, I'm in the studio
How many times you gon' call me?
Goddamn, this bitch trippin' (skrrt, skrrt)
(94 don't need no brakes, yeah)

Coco (Coco) Chanel (Chanel), you ain't really 'bout it, I can tell
Coco (Coco) Chanel (Chanel), can you keep your hands to yourself?
Coco (Coco) Chanel (Chanel), double C lock on the belt
Coco (Coco) Chanel (Chanel), Coco Chanel

Oh my God, why is shawty tryna text me?
Too turnt up, in the back of the jetstream (yeah)
Can't be cuffed, but she tryin' to arrest me
Lyin' to impress me, dyin' to forget me
I can't keep singin' all my songs for ya'
You keep on ringin' me, goes on and on
Can't seem to figure out what's wrong with ya' (woah)
Checkin' your temperature, thermometer

Seems like lately
You're Coco crazy

Coco (Coco) Chanel (Chanel), you ain't really 'bout it, I can tell (tell)
Coco (Coco) Chanel (Chanel), can you keep your hands to yourself? (To yourself)
Coco (Coco) Chanel (Chanel), double C lock on the belt (lock, lock, lock)
Coco (Coco) Chanel (Chanel), Coco Chanel

Coco, no Chanel (woo)
Super pretty chocolate nigga, she say she can tell
Make her feel like I'm from heaven but I still put her through hell
They wasn't 'bout what I was 'bout
Them niggas ain't rock the way that I rock
I realized, they ain't mean me well (let's go!)
Told her don't call my phone with all that nice shit (oh no)
Double C's on the belt correlate the ice hit (bling, bling)
Gettin' to know me right now, it's highly unlikely
'Cause I still remember the days when people like you didn't like me

Seems like lately (but fuck that, you know)
You're Coco crazy (I ain't even trippin', you know what I mean? I'm doin' good without you)

Go!

Coco (Coco) Chanel (Chanel), you ain't really 'bout it, I can tell (tell)
Coco (Coco) Chanel (Chanel), can you keep your hands to yourself? (To yourself)
Coco (Coco) Chanel (Chanel), double C lock on the belt (lock, lock, lock)
Coco (Coco) Chanel (Chanel), Coco Chanel
