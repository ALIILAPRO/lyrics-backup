		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let's take a step into my red room
This ain't no ordinary bedroom
Just let the energy affect you
Carry on (4x)
Just take a step into my red room
This ain't no ordinary bedroom
Just let the energy affect you
Carry on (6x)

She look so fine up in that red room
Her silhouette against the red hue
I swear to god this is the best view
Someone up top they must've blessed you

She got that look, yeah she got that attitude
She don't play by the book, no she do what she have to do
She a bad little bitch all black with some tattoos
She always down for a risk, always down for the taboo

Let's take a step into my red room
This ain't no ordinary bedroom
Just let the energy affect you
Carry on (4x)
Just take a step into my red room
This ain't no ordinary bedroom
Just let the energy affect you
Carry on (6x)

Yeah she liking that show in the mirrors on the walls
Got the one on the ceiling, hope that shit don't fall
When he breaking her back
Damn she like that
Head board shaking with the music full blast
Yeah they never hold back
Two souls on the mat
Switching they positions till they feel the climax 

Yeah he know what she likes
He know what she needs
She open her mouth, he know just what to feed
Baby look good when she down on her knees
But she look even better when she up underneath
He makes her feel free
To be naughty
She likes when he acts just a little cocky
They own this room, yeah they do what they please..

Let's take a step into my red room
This ain't no ordinary bedroom
Just let the energy affect you
Carry on (4x)
Just take a step into my red room
This ain't no ordinary bedroom
Just let the energy affect you
Carry on (6x)
