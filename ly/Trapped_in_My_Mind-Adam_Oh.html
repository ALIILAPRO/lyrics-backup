		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yung Ting, you going crazy
Oh no, no (King, this shit fuego)
Can't breathe in toxic skies
Pollute me with your lies
I thought that I died (Woah, woah)
I cannot breathe through toxic skies
You pollute me with your lies
Thought I died 'long with my sense of time
And I'm not alright feel trapped in my mind
I can't escape even if I tried
Too little too late too weak and too kind
My heart is on fire and I'm burnin' alive
So I guess I'm not fine still trapped in my mind
I don't know the date been in my mind for days
Wish I could get away
You know it isn't safe for me to be in this headspace
(Ayy, yeah, yeah)
Drunk and I miss you unless I'm just drunk
Told me to swim then you watched as I sunk
I can't forgive you no I'm not that dumb
Paranoid I gotta run
I cannot breathe through toxic skies
You pollute me with your lies
Thought I died 'long with my sense of time
And I'm not alright feel trapped in my mind
I can't escape even if I tried
Too little too late too weak and too kind
My heart is on fire and I'm burnin' alive
So I guess I'm not fine still trapped in my mind
Once upon a time I used to hold you close
Now the only thing I'm holdin' is a broken soul
Knocked me down and I'm still falling like some domino's
Oh no I'm trapped I can't get out no more
Back to the basics you crazy as hell
And I can't bring to myself to say I wish you well
Tryna be tough in a world that's ablaze
You told me that you would stay
I cannot breathe through toxic skies
You pollute me with your lies
Thought I died 'long with my sense of time
And I'm not alright feel trapped in my mind
I can't escape even if I tried
Too little too late too weak and too kind
My heart is on fire and I'm burnin' alive
So I guess I'm not fine still trapped in my mind
Singing why, oh why
You lie, you lie
Everytime, everytime
I die a little inside
I'm like bye, baby baby bye bye
Gotta move on with my life
Well at least I'm gon' try
Don't you hit me in the night
Cause I'm probably home cryin'
Don't you know that I'm
Still trapped in my mind
I cannot breathe through toxic skies
You pollute me with your lies
Thought I died 'long with my sense of time
And I'm not alright feel trapped in my mind
I can't escape even if I tried
Too little too late too weak and too kind
My heart is on fire and I'm burnin' alive
So I guess I'm not fine still trapped in my mind
Can't breathe in toxic skies
Pollute me with your lies
I thought that I died (Woah, woah)
Oh no, no
