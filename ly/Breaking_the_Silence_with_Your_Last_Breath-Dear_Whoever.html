		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  

Was that you saying something. I probably heard wrong. You couldn't have spoken more clearly to help me along but now it seems complicated, lacked simplicity, and it all will finally it will finally be over. I could have believed in anything that you could have told me. But I couldn't even understand what was under your breath. I would have believed anything you told me. But you couldn't speak at all. All I heard was the sound of breathing, your attempt to stall. Silence means nothing, silence is nothing, silence be nothing, so we could be alright. Silence means nothing, silence be nothing, silence means nothing. I could have believed in anything that you could have told me. But I couldn't even understand what was under your breath. Take this for what you're worth, your day is over and you never knew in the ways that I tried showing you, I tried showing you.
