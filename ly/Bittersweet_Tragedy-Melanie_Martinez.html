		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sweet, boy, straight out of the movie screen
Candy hearts and chocolate dreams
I, met, my prince upon a popcorn bowl
He held my heart and let it go
Ice cream, upon a summer's day
Beginning sweetness never stays

Melting through the cracks in my hands
I guess I held on for too long

I'm done with your bittersweet, bittersweet tragedy
It's no fun, when I'm sitting all alone
You're right in front of me
And I'm done with your bittersweet, bittersweet tragedy
It's no fun when I'm sitting all alone
You're right in front of me (you're right in front of me)

You, speak, sour lemonade to me
The bitter taste won't let me be
One, kiss, was supposed to be so sweet
But I found grapefruit in your teeth
Old, gum, is all you'll ever be to me
I spit you out and brush my teeth

Melting through the cracks in my hands
I guess I held on for too long

I'm done with your bittersweet, bittersweet tragedy
It's no fun, when I'm sitting all alone
You're right in front of me
And I'm done with your bittersweet, bittersweet tragedy
It's no fun when I'm sitting all alone
You're right in front of me (you're right in front of me)

Enough of your bittersweet
Your sugar rots my teeth
Clogs up my arteries
Your bittersweet shares a tragedy

I'm done with your bittersweet, bittersweet tragedy
It's no fun, when I'm sitting all alone
You're right in front of me
And I'm done with you bittersweet, bittersweet tragedy
It's no fun when I'm sitting all alone
You're right in front of me (you're right in front of me, you're right in front of me)
