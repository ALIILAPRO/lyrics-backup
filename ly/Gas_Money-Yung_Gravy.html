		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Countin' up that cash money, fast money, all up in your ass money
I whip a Tesla, still got gas money
I ain't a bitch, yes sir, I keep cash on me
You could get your face smacked if you act funny
Cash money, fast money, I evade tax money
I got dough, bitch, you broke like some glass money
Racked up, I'm the young Johnny Cash, money
Make gas, motherfucker, that's gas money (ayy, woo, ayy)

I think I'm Jack-in-the-Box 'cause I stay up in them buns
And your ex got that box, rated E for everyone
Ooh, damn girl, that's nasty
I hit the spin move when she tried to harass me
Tryna live but I'm dodgin' these thots
To the right and the left, like I'm playin' Hopscotch
And I'm countin' my bread up, nonstop
Gas money, fuck a stopwatch, shit don't ever stop
Fuck a P.O., fuck a piss test
Y'all racist, stay lovin' incest (fuckin' pussies)
Drive-by, get sprayed with the Windex
'Cause y'all nasty, boofin' them cigarettes (woo, ayy)
And it's Gravy, eternally talkin' my shit
Your girl eternally jockin' my dick
And I could die today (ayy, ayy)
But my gang'll stay eternally paid (ooh, yeah)

They'll be countin' up that cash money, fast money, all up in your ass money
I whip a Tesla, still got gas money
I ain't a bitch, yes sir, I keep cash on me
You could get your face smacked if you act funny
Cash money, fast money, I evade tax money
I got dough, bitch, you broke like some glass money
Racked up, I'm the young Johnny Cash, money
Make gas, motherfucker, that's gas money

I hit the pick-six straight into the endzone (yeah, yeah)
Make your bitch flip, now you in the friendzone (friendzone)
Backshots, then she let me drive the Benz home
Hit Atlanta and I'm sellin' out the Benz dome (ayy, ayy)
That's a quickie bag, cop a Jag', Gucci backpack
I'ma flip it fast in the cash like it's Blackjack
I'm the Sammy Davis Jr. Jr. from the Rat Pack
Gravy fuck your bitch and disappear like I'm a Snapchat

That's that gas money
Bitch, I deserve a plaque, money, mm
Daddy flapjacks, how I stack money, ayy

Countin' up that cash money, fast money, all up in your ass money
I whip a Tesla, still got gas money
I ain't a bitch, yes sir, I keep cash on me
You could get your face smacked if you act funny
Cash money, fast money, I evade tax money
I got dough, bitch, you broke like some glass money
Racked up, I'm the young Johnny Cash, money
Make gas, motherfucker, that's gas money
