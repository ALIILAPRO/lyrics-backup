		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I think about it
I don't even know
How it got to be this way
How it got to be so good
How it got to be

When I think about it
I don't even know
Am I saying thank you?
Am I enjoying it too?
Am I taking it for granted?
지금이야, 지금이야
지금이야, 지금이야
지금이야, 지금이야
지금이야, 지금이야

When I think about it
I don't even know
How it got to be this way
How it got to be so good
How it got to be

When I think about it
I don't even know
Am I saying thank you?
Am I enjoying it too?
Am I taking it for granted? Granted 
지금이야, 지금이야
지금이야, 지금이야
지금이야, 지금이야
지금이야, 지금이야

When I sit with myself
Do I feel it now?
How it got to be this way
How it got to be so good
How it got to be

When I sit with myself
Do I feel it now?
Am I saying thank you?
Am I enjoying it too?
Am I taking it for granted? Granted

When I think about it
I don't even know
So I stopped the thinking
Let it rest and I'll flow

Let it flow
Let it flow and I'll see
Let it go and I'll feel
Let it know and I'll be
Let it flow and I'll see
