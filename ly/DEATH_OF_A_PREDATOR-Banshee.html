		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Heard you bit the dust
Wish the rest would follow suit
Least I dont gotta worry bout you now
I dont gotta worry bout you

We were in the basement
Sitting on the couch
When you couldnt understand
What was probably your first word
'No'

Least I dont gotta worry bout you now
I dont gotta worry bout you

Heard you bit the dust
Wish the rest would follow suit
Least I dont gotta worry bout you now
I dont gotta worry bout you

We were in the basement
Sitting on the couch
When you couldn't understand
What was everybody's first word
'No'

Then I found out that you died on the couch
Then I found out that you died on the couch

I'm not saying he deserved it
Just kidding
I'm absolutely saying he deserved it

You choked on your lasts breath
Poetic justice
That's hilarious bitch
That's hilarious

May the void swallow you whole
Just as you forced me to swallow your foam
Poetic justice
Choked on his last breaths
That's hilarious bitch
That's hilarious

Heard you bit the dust
Wish the rest would follow suit
Least I dont gotta worry bout you now
I dont gotta worry bout you

We were in the basement
Sitting on the couch
When you couldnt understand
What was everybody's first word
'No'

Least I dont gotta worry bout you now
I dont gotta worry bout you

Heard you bit the dust
Wish the rest would follow suit
Least I dont gotta worry bout you now
I dont gotta worry bout you

We were in the basement
Sitting on the couch
When you couldnt understand
What was probably your first word
'No'

Then you fuckin died on the couch
Now that's one less to worry about
