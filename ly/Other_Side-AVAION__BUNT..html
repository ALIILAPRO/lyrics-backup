		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've got a feeling then I'm drowning, I'm by your side
My mind gets numb from the pain that was left behind
So when you feel the same, will you take my hand?
So when you hear this, babe, can we please pretend?

So take away what's left behind
So you can feel the rain from the other side

So take away what's left behind
So you can feel the rain from the other side

I've got a feeling then I'm drowning, I'm by your side
The mind gets numb from the pain that was left behind
So when you feel the same, will you take my hand?
So when you hear this, babe, can we please pretend?

So take away what's left behind
So you can feel the rain from the other side
So take away what's left behind
So you can feel the rain from the other side

So take away what's left behind
So you can feel the rain from the other side
