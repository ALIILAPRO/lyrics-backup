		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Driving just to hear the preferable songs
You loop with every passing day 
Taking note of every temp you're on 
The blinker lights will fall in phase
They'll fall in phase

The sun won't set for a long time
Golden hour
Never far 
The moon results in a strong tide
Fewer stars

Sometimes I know love gets hard to find 
In a flyover state
That's just a state of mind
Out late several hours in the night 
So whenever you call 
Remember Central Time

Righting of the indefensible wrongs
Accrued with every passing day 
Chanting with the insurrectional throngs
And hoping things will fall in place 
They'll fall in place 

The sun won't set for a long time
Golden hour
Never far 
The moon revolves in a strange line
Where we are 

Sometimes I know love gets hard to find 
In a flyover state
That's just a state of mind
Out late several hours in the night 
So whenever you call 
Remember Central Time

Sometimes I know love gets hard to find 
In a flyover state
That's just a state of mind
Out late several hours in the night 
So whenever you call 
Remember Central Time

And ain't no way around it 
Since this time zone shit been founded 
Stretched my pockets, switched accountants
Postal if I'm not next to you 
Bi-coastal I'm just one flight away 
I just pray the plane never tidal wave
Pray you never crash when you type my name 
Well fuck a text message just call me back I need to FaceTime
Two hours ahead don't waste time
Speed racer she don't need to break lines
Just a payphone
Meet up on my hotline sixty minutes we be actin' like it's Dateline
Take that shit straight into a date night
Take all night we get home late night 
Then I take a redeye now I'm sitting stateside
And I can only think about what a great night

And I can only think about what your face like 
And I can only think about when you call mle
Baby take time
Baby make time 
Baby make time
