		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Driving through the fog 
I couldn't tell which way was down
Three rabbits on the road 
A message from a different realm 

The hum of something new 
The sharp metallic blue

And yes you know I love it 
When we are both looking straight at me
But I'm feeling multiplied 
Feeling far away from what I need 

What is sick 
What is part of it 
I want to be the color of the pool 
I want to hold
The fire part of fuel 

And I can't see a place where I wouldn't let it follow me 
Moving currents in in the air sensing shifting energy
The moment before a crash 
The sound of breaking glass
