		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let's keep dirty dancing
Right here till the sunrise
Are we everlasting
Or is it the last, is it the last time?

We're bringing the 80s to life
I'll be your baby tonight
Nobody else by my side
But your hungry eyes, hungry eyes
You got your hand on my jeans
Spinning around, Billie Jean
What are you doing to me
With your hungry eyes, hungry eyes

I can feel it coming
Baby you're the one
Old school kinda loving
That's all that I want
I can feel it coming (uh, Baby you're the one)
Baby you're the one
Together in five, six, seven, eight

Let's keep dirty dancing
Right here till the sunrise
Are we everlasting
Or is it the last, is it the last time?

Let's keep dirty dancing (ooh-oh, oh)
Ain't no good in good night (ain't no good in good night)
I don't know a damn thing
Say is it the last, is it the last time?

You lift me up in the air (the air)
I know that nothing compares (compares)
This kinda feeling is rare
Can't get enough, can't get enough (oh, oh)

Everyone looking, so what
Don't even care if they judge
I love a classic like us
Can't get enough, can't get enough

I can feel it coming
Baby you're the one
Old school kinda loving (loving, oh)
That's all that I want (ooh, oh)
I can feel it coming
Baby you're the one
Together in five, six, seven, eight

Let's keep dirty dancing
Right here till the sunrise
Are we everlasting
Or is it the last, is it the last time?

Let's keep dirty dancing (ooh, let's keep dirty dancing)
Ain't no good in good night (ain't no good in good night)
I don't know a damn thing
Say is it the last, is it the last time?

Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da (let's keep dirty dancing)
Da-da-ra-da, da-da-da-da-ra (hey, let's keep dirty dancing)
Da-da-ra-da, da-da-da-da-ra (let's keep dirty dancing)
Da-da-ra-da, da-da-da-da-ra (dirty dancing, ooh)
