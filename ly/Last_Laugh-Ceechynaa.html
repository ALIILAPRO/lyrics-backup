		  And emergency medical services will be unavailable
Until tomorrow morning at 7 a.M. When The Purge concludes
Blessed be our New Founding Fathers and America, a nation reborn
May God be with you all (oi, mate)

All you do is chill on your block smoke weed
Ap about ops that you don't even have (uh)
These bitch boys come too neeky
Lyin' on a bitch that they can't even have
I said suck my pussy, the fuck is you takin' the dick out your pants? 
(Suck it, suck it)
Like bitch, that wasn't a part of the fuckin' plan (yeah, Revilo on it)
Broke boys say I'm a ho and it don't make sense 'cause I'm way too boujee (what?)
Talkin' on my name that you fucked 
But none of you rats ain't ever been through me
Bottom of the barrel scraps
That's what I call them 'cause they're real dirty
And these niggas keep dyin' for breast
That's how I got the name Chynaa's milkies

I never fucked with these hood rats, every man I link has a wealthy aura
The mandem are getting scammed, they think I can heal their childhood trauma
"Chynaa, why did you scam me?" 'Cause I only wanted your money
Send a nigga back in the cab, you don't get pussy, you must be funny
They're runnin' out of things to say, now they wanna talk 'bout my future kids
I did what I did for the money, if you don't like it then it is what it is (bitch)
My family all seen the pics and I promise you, niggas, I don't give a shit
And my sons will never complain cah they know their mum didn't raised no bitch
Everyone calling me an internet thot, tell them niggas I fuckin' love it
I made so much last week just to act like a thot, tell me what you know about profit
I never had to fuck for the bag, so cool, now just stop it
And I made twelve racks on cammin' to sit on the bed and just do nothing
They all wanna lie on dicks, I swear these men wanna lick my arse (ah)
Didn't wanna know back then, now they all beg me to give 'em a chance
I got to money to play with these niggas and I make that shit times ten
Who would've thought last year that I'd make so much to degrade these men?
I got ten men on my line tryna fuck me and your daddy's the biggest spender (mwah)
I'm takin' advantage of men 'cause these dumb little niggas ain't got composure
When I turned nineteen this year, should've seen the way they were dyin' for nyash
They were laughin' at Legal Baby but most of them usin' my titties to bash

All you do is chill on your block smoke weed
Ap about ops that you don't even have (uh)
These bitch boys come too neeky
Lyin' on a bitch that they can't even have
I said suck my pussy, the fuck is you takin' the dick out your pants? 
(Suck it, suck it)
Like bitch, that wasn't a part of the fuckin' plan
Broke boys say I'm a ho and it don't make sense 'cause I'm way too boujee (what?)
Talkin' on my name that you fucked 
But none of you rats ain't ever been through me
Bottom of the barrel scraps
That's what I call them 'cause they're real dirty
And these niggas keep dyin' for breast
That's how I got the name Chynaa's milkies

When they said the OG Niki, I thought they were talkin' 'bout Nicki Minaj
I typed your name on Google, the only thing that came up was Nicki Minaj
I get paid to rap 'bout the things that this dumb little bitch is doin' for cheap
What kinda bitch let six men hit? 
I run on her pussy and does it free (yeah, Revilo on it)
They said I should keep my cool but I watched how all of you dragged me
I'm rinsin' your fathers' wallets, who the fuck gave these niggas audacity?
Walkin' around with coppers, they should be worried 'bout feeding their family
And they're callin' me out of my name so tell me why the fuck am I keepin' it classy?
