		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This aint working think it's time to call it quits
But I'm hoping we can find a way to co exist
Baby when I hit you tonight
I'll be there with a shoulder to cry on

And you'll need some therapy
Cause it'll take years to come around
I know I'm a rarity
So when you're ready I'm ready

For you to be sad be sad be sad
And put up a fight to get me back
There must be something wrong with your emotions
It shouldn't take this long
Why aren't you broken
You should be sad

Ah oo no no
Ah oo yeah you should be sad 
Ah oo no no
Ah oo yeah you should be 

Maybe I'm the only one who ever called
But remember I was still the one to call it off
I know it was you and not me 
You're lucky that I gave you 3 months

And you'll need some therapy
Cause it'll take years to come around
I know I'm a rarity
So when you're ready I'm ready

For you to be sad be sad be sad
And put up a fight to get me back
There must be something wrong with your emotions
It shouldn't take this long
Why aren't you broken
You should be 

Crying on the bathroom floor
Screaming you can't take no more
Say you been dying since I left
We both know that I'm the best you had
You had

You should be sad be sad be sad
And put up a fight to get me back
There must be something wrong with your emotions
It shouldn't take this long
Why aren't you broken
You should be sad

Ah oo no no
Ah oo yeah you should be sad 
Ah oo no no
Ah oo yeah you should be
