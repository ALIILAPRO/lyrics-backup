		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Crazy to think that a man can't hurt
Love takes its toll every time it don't work, yeah
One door closes and another opens
But it's hard to let go when your heart's broken
I'll give you my trust, can you give me your word?

Come take my heart of glass
And give me your love
I hope you'll still be there
To pick the pieces up
'Cause baby I'm fragile, fragile, fragile
'Cause baby I'm fragile, fragile, fragile

After he left you in ten times ten
Could I put you back together again? Yeah
One door closes and another opens
But I won't let go 'cause I'm not like him
Baby just say the words, let the love begin

Come take my heart of glass
And give me your love
I hope you'll still be there
To pick the pieces up
'Cause baby I'm fragile, fragile, fragile
'Cause baby I'm fragile, fragile, fragile

Oh oh hey
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh, say love, say love
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh, say love, say love
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh, say love, say love
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh, say love, say love

Yeah, you will take yours and mine
I got your heart of glass
You've got my love
I know we'll still be there
To pick the pieces up
'Cause baby we're fragile, fragile, fragile
'Cause baby we're fragile, fragile, fragile

Oh oh hey
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh, say love, say love
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh, say love, say love
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh, say love, say love
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh, say love, say love

Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
