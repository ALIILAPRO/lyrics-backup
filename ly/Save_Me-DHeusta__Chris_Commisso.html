		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Too late to hide away
Too soon for one to repay
Why don't you see what's comin
I can not stop what's comin
There is no point in tryin
Please read my mind, can't decide when I'm broken
Every whisper is turning to voices 
that I only begin to discern in noises

Somebody save
Somebody save
Somebody save me
Somebody save
Somebody save
Somebody save me

Let others aggravate you
Ignore the pain of what they do to you
Why do they point a difference
Why can't I see the difference
What is this voice indifferent
Never collide with the thoughts ignorant
Every whisper is turning to voices 
That I only begin to discern in noises 

Somebody save
Somebody save
Somebody save me
Somebody save
Somebody save
Somebody save me!

Save me, save me
Save me
Save me, save me
Save
Save me

Somebody save
Somebody save
Somebody save me
Somebody save
Somebody save
Somebody save me
