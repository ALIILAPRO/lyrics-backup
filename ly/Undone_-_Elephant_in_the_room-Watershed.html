		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How long
Till I'm done
Hiding from the outside?
How long
Till I'm done?

How long
Will it take
To end this heartbreak?
How long till I'm done?

Who's got me sitting on the sofa
Just tryna keep my hands warm?

And I wonder how the music plays when everything is wrong
And I wonder where the children meet when friends don't seem to come
And I wonder where the old man goes to light it up the world
'Cause that's what we're living for
I'm undone
Oh, oh

How long
Does it leave?
Or is it just s lonely day
To be free?
Is it me?

Oh, how long
Till the sun
Burns up the enemy?
How long til I'm gone?

Who's got me hiding on my loved ones
And trying to keep a smile on?

And I wonder why in the midnight sky the stars no longer shine
And I wonder when the governments are left outside to dry
And I wonder how the world will turn when everything is burned
And we're holding up the earth
I'm undone
Oh, oh
I'm undone
Oh, oh

Oh then
What about then?
Oh, our world
Is caving in

And I wonder where the lovers meet when time is spent alone
And I wonder why we learned to fly if we all rolled into one
And I wonder where the old man goes to light it up the world
And I smile up at the sun
I'm undone
Oh, oh
I'm undone
Oh, oh
I'm undone
