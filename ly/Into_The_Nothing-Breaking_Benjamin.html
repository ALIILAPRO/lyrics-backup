		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Screaming on the inside
I am frail and withered
Cover up the wounds
That I can't hide
Walls that lie between us
The saint within the sinner
I have lost the nerve
But it's all right
Carry the wounded and shut your eyes
All will be forgiven
None will rise
Bury the fallen and lead the blind
I will fight the loss
Dead inside

Into the nothing
Faded and weary
I won't leave and let you fall behind
Live for the dying
Heaven hear me
I know we can make it out alive

Leave me at the bottom
I am lost forever
Letters from the dead
Say goodbye
Sorrow falls upon us
This will be the last time
Days begin to end
But I'll get by
Follow the hopeless
And shut your eyes

All will be abandoned
None will shine
Gather the broken and leave this life
Lying in the earth
Side by side

Into the nothing
Faded and weary
I won't leave and let him fall behind
Live for the dying
Heaven hear me
I know we can make it out alive

I'll keep you inside
Where I lead you cannot follow
Straight into the light
As my breath grows still and shallow

Into the nothing
Faded and weary
I won't leave and let you fall behind
Live for the dying
Heaven hear me
I know we can make it out alive

Stay with me
You're all I have left
I know we can make it out alive
Stay with me
You're all I have left
I know we can make it out alive
