		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I remember black mascara painting your face
I remember dark sunglasses when clouds were grey
Remember silence
Remember tears
Remember still
I remember black cars pulling up to take you away
The smell of the fall and the endless rain
Remember shivers
Remember cold
Remember still
Now I hesitate
Levitate between memories
Elevate, was it hate?
That got through to me
My mistake, was it fate that brought you to me?
Now I'm losing

Why can't I see any color at all
When I dream about those days?
How did I let these images drain away
When all I do is suffer?
No color
Why can't I see any color at all?
Why can't I see any color at all?
Why can't I see any color at all?
No color

I remember black clouds blooming
As I shouldered the blame
The gunmetal grey on that trembling day
Remember thunder
Remember fear
Remember still
I remember biting my lip to stifle a laugh
I tried to say your name
But all that came out was a whisper
"Hell is empty, the devil's here"
Now you disintegrate
Levitate into memory
Elevate, was it hate that got you to see?
My mistake, it was fate that brought you to me?
Now I'm losing

Why can't I see any color at all
When I dream about those days?
How did I let these images drain away
When all I do is suffer?
No color
Why can't I see any color at all?
Why can't I see any color at all?
Why can't I see any color at all?
No color

I think I thought but I forgot
I think I think too much
I have a problem for every answer
Striking at the ocean with a broken hammer
I think I think too much
I think I think too much

Why can't I see any color at all
When I dream about those days?
How did I let these images drain away
When all I do is suffer?
No color
Why can't I see any color at all?
Why can't I see any color at all?
Why can't I see any color at all?
No color
We can break apart like stars
And throw ourselves against the sky
