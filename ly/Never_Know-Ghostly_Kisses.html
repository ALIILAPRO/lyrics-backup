		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Is time a perception of space? 
Or just a concept to scare us all 
Or to make us prisoners
From the edge I see 
A glimpse of our past 

Don't let me go 
Don't let me go 

This is beyond my imagination 
You never know 
Now we rest with today's memories 
Trapped, season after season 
It is just an undefined circle 

Don't let me go 
Don't let me go
