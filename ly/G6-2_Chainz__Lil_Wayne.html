Yup

Lit, bitch, I'm the shit
I'm a real walkin' lick, spent a brick on my fit
I show up in this bitch, sick as throw up in this bitch
Lookin' like I wore a fuckin' jewelry store up in this bitch
Wait, Sqad Up, that's my fuckin' skate team, nigga (the gang)
You don't want that real smoke, you vaping, nigga (no way)
To be safe, none of my guns on safety, nigga
Who the fuck I look like? Ed Reed, nigga?
Coupe on ultraviolet (yeah)
Tunechi on narcotics, so my pupils always hidin'
All those Bugle Boys you wearing, are you stupid? These designer
Sippin' soup up out the Styro', drippin' too hard for Poseidon
And my semi-automatic, and my drip on autopilot
And my jewelry on sarcastic, my money on plastic
When it comes to dead presidents, I'm a bastard
And all my bitches passive, and all my hoes erotic
And my dick on automatic, and my drip on autopilot (yeah)
Drippin' so hard, might go on a water diet (diet)
Diamonds on her tongue 'cause she geekin' off the molly (molly)
Don't bring me no ones, I blow funds on her body (body)
Blow funds on her body, bitch, my drip on autopilot

So you know, another guest just walked into Nicki Minaj TV
And I just asked him what, what's that fragrance that he had on
And he had to get real cocky and pop his collar
So let him do it on, on TV

Toni
You probably seen me with a double-cup glued to my hand
Baby, ask your friend what she gon' do for this band
I'm the realest one in here, I'ma tell you in advance
Take this G6, she might wake up in Japan
Yeah, probably seen me with a double-cup in my hand
Baby, ask your friend what she gon' do for this band
I'm the realest one in here, I'ma tell you in advance
Take this G6, she might wake up in Japan

Got this city on my back, I might need shoulder pads (ayy, ayy)
Tried to DM me, now sit in my shoes and photograph
Difference between my watch and yours is the chronograph
Quarter-half, hoes face, alpha diamonds gon' toe ring
Say she love my protein, money pull my pants down
I'ma need a drawstring
Ask me, did I have anything to eat? I told her, "Cocaine"
Big flames out the muzzle, custom mods will often puzzle
After the fact that I was humble
They say, "Life a bitch," I'ma smut her, need a couple rubbers
Had a girl named Nina, all we used to do was smoke and cuddle
You already know, I need a couple million on the double
Anybody seen my ceiling? (Well)
My nigga got locked up and started sellin' dope in prison (yeah, fuck you talkin' 'bout?)
Yeah, the truth my religion (south side)
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
Yeah, the truth my religion
Turn up

You probably seen me with a double-cup glued to my hand (yeah)
Baby, ask your friend what she gon' do for this band (fuck that shit)
I'm the realest one in here, I'ma tell you in advance (print this money)
Take this G6, she might wake up in Japan, yeah (woo)
