		  (Let the band play)
Glizzock
Yeah

Ayy
These bitches playin' games like Nintendo
I can't trust a thing but that man in the mirror
I'm scared to fall in love, baby girl, I just can't go (uh-uh)
These diamonds on me dancin', I see why she tryin' to tango
But I can't trust these bitches, switch my hoes more than I change clothes (yeah)
My pinky ring just hittin' (ice), glistenin', lookin' like a rainbow (Yeah)
These niggas talkin' down up on the kid, I'ma up that banger (bah)
Yeah, real recognize real, grandma said, "Boy, don't ever fuck with strangers" (uh-uh)
On gang, bruh (gang)

Yep, I keep that flame tucked (bah)
Yeah, these rappers 'til they get caught then they to singers (yeah)
Yeah, all these bitches thots 'til they get caught then turn to angels
(Yeah, all these bitches thots 'til they get caught then turn to angels, the fuck?)
Yeah, I just left off the block, they like, "Glock stay dangerous"
Yep, I got money in the vault and money on my cranium
Yep, money all I think about, don't give a fuck what they think of me (uh-uh)
(Yep, money all I think about, don't give a fuck what they think of me, ayy, yeah)

These bitches playin' games like Nintendo
I can't trust a thing but that man in the mirror
I'm scared to fall in love, baby girl, I just can't go (uh-uh)
These diamonds on me dancin', I see why she tryin' to tango
But I can't trust these bitches, switch my hoes more than I change clothes (yeah)
My pinky ring just hittin' (bling), glistenin', lookin' like a rainbow (yeah)
These niggas talkin' down up on the kid, I'ma up that banger (bah)
Yeah, real recognize real, grandma said, "Boy, don't ever fuck with strangers" 
On gang, bruh (gang)

These niggas thinkin' they fuckin' with the kid, they can hang it up (uh-uh)
Yep, I've been flexin' harder, I see all my opps been gangin' up
Them niggas nothin' but bitches, tell them pussies pull they panties up
Call me Mister Glock or Master Key, I get big bucks, no games boy

Diamonds fightin' like Mike and Roy, I'll slam your bitch like Randy Orton (yeah)
I be drippin on them boys, Gucci, Louis, Michael Jordans (yeah)
I'll never beef about a whore, I told you that bitch wasn't yours (yeah, haha)

These bitches playin' games like Nintendo (haha)
I can't trust a thing but that man in the mirror (yeah)
I'm scared to fall in love, baby girl, I just can't go (uh-uh)
These diamonds on me dancin', I see why she tryin' to tango
But I can't trust these bitches, switch my hoes more than I change clothes (yeah)
My pinky ring just hittin' (bling), glistenin', lookin' like a rainbow 
These niggas talkin' down up on the kid, I'ma up that banger (bah)
Yeah, real recognize real, grandma said, "Boy, don't ever fuck with strangers"
