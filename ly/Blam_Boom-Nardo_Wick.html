		  (Flexing on that bitch, hold up)
(Forever Rolling)

Blam-boom
Tryna put a nigga on the damn news
Postin' switches on the internet 
That boy a damn fool
Bought a purse, he still ain't hit it yet
That boy a damn fool
Bought a Perc', he barely know the plug 
That boy a damn fool
Blam-boom
You see all these diamonds on me hittin'
Blam-boom
Plenty hoes, I ain't trippin' 'bout no bitches
Blam-boom
Ant bite, trigger finger itchin'
Blam-boom
I paid to get 'em gone
I'ma kill the triger

(Blam-boom)
If he speak on a murder, that's a red flag 
(Blam-boom)
He pillow talk to bitches? That's a red flag 
(Blam-boom)
That Perc' too cheap? That's a red flag 
(Blam-boom)
If I'm in that backseat, throw the white flag 

Blam-boom, blam-boom, blam-boom
Tryna blam you
Blam-boom, blam-boom, blam-boom
Man down you
Blam-boom, blam-boom, blam-boom
Jump out and I
Blam-boom, blam-boom, blam-boom, blam-boom

Blam-boom
You can't label me as no rap nigga (nah)
'Cause I'm who the rappers rap about
Call us R-O-A-G (Round Of Applause Gang)
'Cause me and all these niggas clap a lot (mm, mm, mm)
They say, "Nardo be in black a lot" (mm, mm, mm)
They say, "Lil' nigga keep that strap a lot" (mm, mm, mm)
He say he gang, I say, "No, you not" (mm, mm, mm)
She said, "I can't fuck" 
She came on her dot (mm, mm)
I done see a lot of crazy things
Lotta brutal images in my brain (mm, mm)
That lil' nigga there be tweakin'
That's an understatement, I'm insane

Blam-boom, blam-boom, blam-boom
Tryna blam you
Blam-boom, blam-boom, blam-boom
Man down you
Blam-boom, blam-boom, blam-boom
Jump out and I
Blam-boom, blam-boom, blam-boom, blam-boom

Blam-boom
All these chains, this shit makin' me hot
Tissue for my wrist big boogers in the watch
Come on let's squash this, I think not
How you left him when you saw him? I think shot
Opps tryna keep they kids 'cause they know we gon' spam
Opps went and got they kids, the only time we gon' spam
And this mask shit ain't new, I used to always wear 'em
Broke and still rock my jeans, used to always share 'em
And that slime shit ain't nothin', used to always do it
I ain't never drove shit, used to always shoot it
I ain't ever waste my beam, used to always use it
Glock loud, don't matter used to always mute it

Blam-boom
You see all these diamonds on me hittin'
Blam-boom
Plenty hoes, I ain't trippin' 'bout no bitches
Blam-boom
Ant bite, trigger finger itchin'
Blam-boom
I paid to get 'em gone
I'ma kill the trigger

Blam-boom, blam-boom, blam-boom
Tryna blam you
Blam-boom, blam-boom, blam-boom
Man down you
Blam-boom, blam-boom, blam-boom
Jump out and I
Blam-boom, blam-boom, blam-boom, blam-boom
Blam-boom
