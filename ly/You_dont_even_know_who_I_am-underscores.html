		  Everybody has bad days
Don't worry, it's not the end of the world
There's always tomorrow
I'm ready to support your next
I'm always here for you

Everybody has bad days
Don't worry, it's not the end of the world
There's always tomorrow
I'm ready to support your next
I'm always here for you

Everybody has bad days
Don't worry, it's not the end of the world
There's always tomorrow
I'm ready to support your next
I'm always here for you

Everybody has bad
Don't worry, it's not the end of the world
There's always tomorrow
I'm ready to support your next
I'm always here for you

I know where you came from
And I know who your best friends are
And you don't even know who I am
You don't even know who I am
You don't even know who I am

I know where your house is
And I know who your siblings are
But you don't even know who I am
You don't even know who I am
You don't even know who I am

Today is the worst day of my life
I think I'm in love with the cards you were dealt
How you felt, why you're wiser than me
And it hurts that I'm not like you

I know what you're scared of
And I know what your blood type is
But you don't even know who I am
You don't even know who I am
You don't even know who I am

I know all your habits
Keep the window open when you're asleep
And you don't even know who I am
You don't even know who I am
You don't even know who I am

I know when your Mom leaves
She goes to work at the crack of dawn
And you don't even know who I am
You don't even know who I am
You don't even know who I am

Today is the best day of my life
I invited myself in and wore your clothes
Took your pills, cried your makeup off
And for once I felt just like you

I know that I scare you
But I'm nowhere near the worst you've seen
And you don't even know who I am
You don't even know who I am
You don't even know who I am

Everybody has bad days
Don't worry, it's not the end of the world
There's always tomorrow
I'm ready to support your next
I'm always here for you
