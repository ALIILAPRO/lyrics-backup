		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Unlock your door
Yeah that was your first mistake
Dropped your keys on the floor
Left them there for me to take

Trail behind her in my car
Notice me in the rear view mirror
She tries not to let me know
Then I pull right up beside her
Thrilled that I can finally ask the
Question I'm desperate to know

Do you remember me?
Do you remember me?
I'll reject all sense for you until i bleed
Oh
Do you remember me?

I called you for
The very first time last night
To tell you that you're
Always and forever mine

Trail behind her in my car
Notice me in the rear view mirror
She tries not to let me know
Then I pull right up beside her
Thrilled that I can finally ask the
Question I'm desperate to know

Do you remember me?
Do you remember me?
I'll reject all sense for you until I bleed
Oh
Do you remember me?

I just wanna keep you safe
Promise me you'll stay
And you'll remember me
