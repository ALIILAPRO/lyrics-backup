		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Something bad
Coming this way darling
Don't look back
With every fucker
Keep your eye on the path
Or it'll drive you mad

The world goes around
Makes me dizzy but I
Hold my ground
When I get nauseous I just
Gag it down
Pound for pound
I gag it down
I gag it down

Oh, hit me, hit me with that super pain
'Cause a hit feels like I'm dancing in the rain
Give me that beat
There's no need to cry
It's just a black eye, yeah
Hit me, hit me with that super bass
'Cause I want tonight to slap me in the face
Give me that beat
There's no need to cry
It's just a black eye, yeah

Something bad
Already happened
Does that make you sad?
I'm gonna burn it
'Cause I don't get mad
I'm a modern dog

Collar crime
Year on a leash
It makes a nasty mind
I'm sorry Mr. Fister
If I bite
It's just spite
I will bite
I will bite

Oh, hit me, hit me with that super pain
'Cause a hit feels like I'm dancing in the rain
Give me that beat
There's no need to cry
It's just a black eye, yeah
Hit me, hit me with that super bass
'Cause I want tonight to slap me in the face
Give me that beat
There's no need to cry
It's just a black eye, yeah

Oh, yeah
No need to cry
It's just a black eye

Oh, oh
There's no need to cry
It's just a black eye

Black, black, black eye

Give me a black eye

Just a black eye

Little baby just dry your tears and say
A black eye never goes away
Little baby just dry your tears and say
A black eye never goes away
