		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take me home
Tell me all you know
Just let it stay the same
As it was before I came
You were never meant to know
Close your eyes
Can I make you cry
See the blood on your chair
Your hands run through my hair
And this time you can't let me go
Catch the rain
Can I make some mistakes
Will it be like this again
Will we be here again
Because this time I'll just let you go
Take me home
Tell me all you know
Just let it stay the same
And you lean over and say
You were never meant to know
