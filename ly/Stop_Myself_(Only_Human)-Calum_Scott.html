		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Driven to the fire
Take it back to where we started
Till we crash and burn again
Now I got it to a science
All this sabotage between us
Dancing on a razor's edge

Where does it start, where does it end
Two nights ago my broken heart was on the mend
Know I should go but it's so hard when you walk in
I'm not myself when we're apart, I can't pretend

Oh but I
I'm only human
How am I supposed to stop myself
From loving you, loving you, yeah

I'm only human
I'm about to do the thing I know
I shouldn't do, shouldn't do, yeah

We don't know how the story's gonna end
But I know you're gonna break my heart again
I'm only human, how am I supposed to stop myself
From loving you, loving you, yeah

Having a disaster
In the middle of the madness
Hard to tell which one is which
Always caught up the morning after
When I'm reaching out to hold ya
Nothing on my fingertips

Where does it start, where does it end
Two nights ago my broken heart was on the mend
Know I should go but it's so hard when you walk in
I'm not myself when we're apart, I can't pretend

Oh but I
I'm only human
How am I supposed to stop myself
From loving you, loving you, yeah

I'm only human
I'm about to do the thing I know
I shouldn't do, shouldn't do, yeah

We don't know how the story's gonna end
But I know you're gonna break my heart again
I'm only human, how am I supposed to stop myself
From loving you, loving you, yeah

Look like an angel
Palms on your halo
Look like an angel
And I'm drowning in your lie

Oh but I
I'm only human
How am I supposed to stop myself
From loving you

I'm only human
I'm about to do the thing I know
I shouldn't do, shouldn't do, yeah

We don't know how the story's gonna end
But I know you're gonna break my heart again
I'm only human, how am I supposed to stop myself
From loving you, loving you, yeah
