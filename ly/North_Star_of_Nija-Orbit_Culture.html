		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Combust, the opulence of all the human faults in flames
You've killed, but you see yourself for real in here

The serpent
Black god
The north star of Nija

Don't cry, you'll see what you want to see

Charcoal crown, the leviathan of all the things we thought we heard 
Of all there is to see

Don't cry, you are here where you need to be
Don't cry, you'll be the one that you need to kill

You'll follow me

To the somewhere between, in the darkest of nights
There's something to see, in the circles of the light
In the deepest of dreams, I can see the flash coming down on thee

Cause the weight of this world, now won't slow us down
But I don't know how long, so you better go now
Before I'll show you what's coming

Adjust the ornament, to fit the true king of our realm 
You bow to a darker power that's real in here
 
The serpent
The black god
The north star of Nija

I've lived through some grey days
But I've never really given it a thought
How I live, how it's feasting on me
How it's taking me

Don't cry, you are here where you need to be
Don't cry, you'll be the one that you need to kill

You'll follow me.

To the somewhere between, in the darkest of nights
There's something to see, in the circles of the light
In the deepest of dreams, I can see the flash coming down on thee

Cause the weight of this world, now won't slow us down
But I don't know how long, so you better go now
Before I'll show you what's coming

I'm the leader of all that's dead
I'm the crows that you witness next
I'm the leech that steals from the mother's breast
I'm the serpent in hell

Fighting, surviving for life
No one will ever see the truth
Leaving the world to die
No one will ever see the truth

Fighting, surviving for life
No one will ever see the truth
Leaving the world to die
No one will ever see the truth

You'll stay here for a long time
You'll dry your tears from off your face, but you can't look back now

You'll fade away

I'm the reason for all that's been
I'm the cross-bearer of all of human race
I'm the kingpin of all your hate
I'm the serpent in hell

I'm the serpent of all
A serpent of all

I've sent down the crows to hell
To gather the bones of you
I've given the piece of skin
To the gods of the broken man
I am complete

I've sent down the crows to hell
To gather the bones of you
I've given the piece of skin
To the gods of the broken man
