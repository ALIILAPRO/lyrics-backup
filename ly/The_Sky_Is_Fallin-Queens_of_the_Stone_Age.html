		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The sky is falling
Human race that we run
Has left me crawling
Staring straight at the sun
Oh, in a moment I notice
Every dog has his day
I paid attention
Cost me so much to hate

For so long
I saw only wrong
But now to remind
It's a waste of time

Close your eyes and see the skies are falling
Close your eyes and see the skies are falling

I wanted something
Nothing blank I don't know
It's all deflecting
Stones are easy to throw
Oh, in a moment I've noticed
Hours, days left behind
Of wasted, useless
Selfless, none of a kind

For so long
I saw only wrong
But now to remind
Not to go back to the low

That has drained my life so low
That has drained my life so low
That has drained my life so low
That has drained my

Close your eyes and see the skies are falling
Close your eyes and see the skies are falling
Close your eyes and see the skies are falling
Close your eyes and see the skies are falling

Close your eyes and see the skies are falling
Close your eyes and see the skies are falling
Close your eyes and see the skies are falling
Close your eyes and see the skies are falling

Krdl, KRDL 109
We spoil music for everyone
Shut up, you little brat
Krdl, the KRDL
Elastic Ass with ya here in Chino Hills, the last frontier
That's where we're at

Uh, word, KOOL
You know what it spells and you know how we do
Live and direct coming at you from the middle of nowhere
The centre of everywhere
Ya gotta check this band, Queens Of The Stone Age
If you not knowin' them, here I'm letting ya know
Giving it my stamp of approval, you know what I'm saying? 
So pick this up

And we're gonna spoil the music for ya
This is, um Millionare
Queens of the Stone Age
Um, a song about something they'll never be

All death metal, all the time (all the time)
