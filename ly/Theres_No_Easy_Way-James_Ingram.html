		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I held her close to me
'Cause I know she breaks so easily
And then I told her
But I knew no matter how I tried to console her
She'd just do the best she could
But there are times the best is no damn good
And no matter how you try to be kind
There's always still a part of you you leave behind
When it falls apart

There's no easy way to break somebody's heart

I lied and told her she'd be fine
Though we both knew it was just a line 
I had to do it
'Cause I'd a' said anything to help me get through it

Then she reached out for my hand
And her simple touch was more than I could stand
And I had to turn away
'Cause I knew all the hurt
That she was feeling I was feeling too
'Cause when it falls apart

There's no easy way to break somebody's heart

She could've gotten angry
And made me feel like a guilty child
But I realized that never was her style
I wanted her to hurt me
And not treat me like a friend
I wanted her to say there'd be someday
I'd come crawling on my knees to ask her back again
But she acted like a lady 'til the end
Oh, what a lady

I thought that she'd break down
But she smiled at me and never made a sound
And I guess she understood in her way
'Cause her silence told me everything she could not say
When it falls apart
There's just no easy way

There's just no easy way
There's no easy way to break somebody's heart.
