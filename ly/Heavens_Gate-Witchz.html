		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Give me just a second to breath
I been running wild and
I’m high as could be
Spend a lotta time
In my mind it’s bleak
Fuck your 9 to 5 I’m about to peak
Welcome to the fire my friends
Take your ass ransom
Innocent
Gives me life
Your sin
Kill em all dancing
Oh lord I done been through it all
And I’m just trying to find my way
Before I get to heavens gate
You should put your bitch on a leash
Got my mind on money
Cus these bitches ain’t free
Not too many rivals ain’t no one in my league
Put your fuckin hands where my eyes can see
Welcome to the fire my friends
Take your ass ransom
Innocent
Gives me life
Your sins
Kill em all dancing
Welcome to the fire my friends
Take your ass ransom
Innocent
Gives me life
Your sins
Kill em all dancing
Hanging by a thread
You fuck around
I put a round all through your head
Hanging by a thread
You fuck around
I put a round all through your head
Oh lord
I done been through it all
And I’m just trying to find my way
Before I get to heavens gate
Oh lord
I done been through it all
And I’m just trying to find my way
Before I get to heavens gate
