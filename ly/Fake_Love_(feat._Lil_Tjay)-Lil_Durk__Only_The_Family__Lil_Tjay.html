		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This shit gotta be bigger than big
Know what I'm sayin', no lil' boy shit
Everything gotta be extravagant
(Boy)
(I just taught Rich to get rich)

Introduce you to designer, moved you to Atlanta
How y'all gon' trade on me?
How the fuck you gon' change up, you said, "You can't claim us"
How you gon' play with me?
How the fuck you call me fake and then don't be around?
How the fuck you say you love me, but then don't see about it
All this fake love, this fake love, this fake love
All this fake love, this fake love, this fake love
This fake love, this fake love

I held a fake grudge, I gave you fake hugs
Handshake was no love, 'fore y'all had fake stubs
They said we can't come, had thoughts to snake 'em
That nigga shake some, tell that nigga, "Take some"
And they never support us, and they never take orders
I give 'em my daughter, had lean in my organs
These niggas ain't got no morals, I'm off X in Florida
They tryna tax for quarters, like they don't know my story
Ain't talk to my cousin Corey, say I got too rich and important
I miss jail calls, of course, 'cause I'm in this bitch recordin'
And when they see me shinin', they say the need me more
I gave you twenty, on God, just what you need it for?
I regret tellin' the whole world all love for 'em
I regret tellin' old girl I love her
I regret lettin' them niggas fall in my circle, whoa
I regret, kept sayin', "Yeah", even though they burned me up
Wakin' up to ASAP texts, he tell me, "Pour it up"
And he kept tellin' me, "These niggas, they don't fuck with us"
Oh yeah, he said they was hatin' on the low with us
If they ain't tour with you, that means it's both of us, yeah

Introduce you to designer, moved you to Atlanta
How y'all gon' trade on me?
How the fuck you gon' change up, you said, "You can't claim us"
How you gon' play with me?
How the fuck you call me fake and then don't be around?
How the fuck you say you love me, but then don't see about it
All this fake love, this fake love, this fake love
All this fake love, this fake love, this fake love, his fake love, this

And I ain't playin' 'round, swear I lay 'em down
Bro, don't say a sound
Free the guys, ain't got the gang around
Locked up in the pound
I got niggas in the cell, said indictment, ain't no bail
Forty-eight, I'm never tellin'
Come home, we raisin' hell
And I cut loss for all my guys, sendin' kites, I hear their cries
Snitchin', tellin' lies, it won't be long until he die
I done seen a homicide, guess that's why I'm traumatized
But I got Smelly by my side, we screamin' Easy when we drop
Niggas talk but never slide, imagine how I feel inside
But bro, I never took the stand, I had to see his momma cry
But now I'm hurt, see me shootin' first, someone gettin' murdered
But now I'm hurt, see me shootin' first, someone gettin' murdered

Introduce you to designer, moved you to Atlanta

How the fuck you gon' change up, you said, "You can't claim us"
How you gon' play with me?
How the fuck you call me fake and then don't be around?
How the fuck you say you love me, but then don't see about it
All this fake love, this fake love, this fake love
All this fake love, this fake love, this fake love
This fake love, this fake love
