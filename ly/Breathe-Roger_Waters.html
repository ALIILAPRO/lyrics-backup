		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Breathe in the air
Make for the meadow and savor the grass, while it lasts
By and by
Spidery fingers of industry reach for the sky
Brick upon brick, stone upon stone, they grow
Choking the atmosphere, oh, so incredibly slowly
Sulphur and carbon and hydrogen sulphide and lime
Fever, corrosion, and cover your cities with grime

Something is killing the land before your eyes
And the sunshine
Is not to blame
Could be the insane, inhumane games we play
Day by day

Riddle and fool
Mushrooming home in a crowd, I'm alone
Close your eyes, lie still
You are a mountain stream and I am a hill
Far, far away
There is a field of blossom and bees and new mown hay

Breathe in the air (Repeat 4X)
