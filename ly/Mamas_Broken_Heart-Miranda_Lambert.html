		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I cut my bangs with some rusty kitchen scissors
I screamed his name 'til the neighbors called the cops
I numbed the pain at the expense of my liver
Don't know what I did next all I know, I couldn't stop

Word got around to the barflies and the Baptists
My mama's phone started ringin' off the hook
I can hear her now sayin' she ain't gonna have it
Don't matter how you feel, it only matters how you look

Go and fix your make up girl it's, just a break up run an'
Hide your crazy and start actin' like a lady 'cause I
Raised ya better, gotta keep it together even when you fall apart
But this ain't my mama's broken heart

I wish I could be just a little less dramatic like a
Kennedy when Camelot went down in flames
Leave it to me to be holdin' the matches
When the fire trucks show up and there's nobody else to blame

Can't get revenge and keep a spotless reputation
Sometimes revenge is a choice you gotta make
My mama came from a softer generation
Where you get a grip and bite your lip just to save a little face

Go and fix your make up girl it's, just a break up run an'
Hide your crazy and start actin' like a lady 'cause I
Raised ya better, gotta keep it together even when you fall apart
But this ain't my mama's broken heart

Powder your nose, paint your toes line your lips and keep 'em closed
Cross your legs, dot your I's and never let 'em see you cry

Go and fix your make up well it's, just a break up run an'
Hide your crazy and start actin' like a lady 'cause I
Raised ya better, gotta keep it together even when you fall apart
But this ain't my mama's broken heart
