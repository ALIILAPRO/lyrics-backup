		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Alright, we smooth, go through
You know, you know how I like my shit, John, perfect, hold on
Huh, I could be gone by the mornin', huh
So I'm keepin' it on me
(Great John on the beat, by the way)
Look, look 

Look, I could be gone by the mornin', huh, so I'm keepin' it on me
She said she don't love nobody, I told her I was heartless
She said she just wanna party, uh, she fuck with bosses
Boy, just watch how you be talkin', you know lil' bro gon' spark it, hey

Pull out your camera, record it, huh
Flexin', I do this shit often
'Member back then, ain't have no money, huh
Now I got racks in my pocket
She think I'm buyin' her bags 'cause she gorgeous
She want Dior, I know she adore it
Take no checks, know bro gon' floor it
When you got a check, your life ain't borin'
Hold on, ballin', I feel like I'm Jordan
But this a different type of scorin'
They ain't want me, now they say I'm important
They painted my brother a portrait
I need a couple K for the walk-in
No regular whip, this a foreign
I cannot fuck her if she gon' be stalkin'
Like, Sleepy, why we never talkin'?

Look, I could be gone by the mornin', huh, so I'm keepin' it on me
She said she don't love nobody, I told her I was heartless
She said she just wanna party, uh, she fuck with bosses
Boy, just watch how you be talkin', you know lil' bro gon' spark it

Uh, they know I do what I want, I don't care how it seem
They say they love me but lately don't know what it mean
Sent a message to God and He left it on seen
But only to show me shit don't go as planned, huh
Told you, you was gon' be the man
Now I done spent bricks on shit way back, couldn't afford this, look, huh
I done lost racks, made it back in the back of apartments, look
We don't forgive and forget
We live life, here's your ass if you caught slippin', huh
I remember days we was trappin' out
Police outside, to the back, we out
Be the crack of dawn, nigga

Look, I could be gone by the mornin', huh, so I'm keepin' it on me
She said she don't love nobody, I told her I was heartless
She said she just wanna party, uh, she fuck with bosses
Boy, just watch how you be talkin', you know lil' bro gon' spark it
Look, I could be gone by the mornin', huh, so I'm keepin' it on me
She said she don't love nobody, I told her I was heartless
She said she just wanna party, uh, she fuck with bosses
Boy, just watch how you be talkin', you know lil' bro gon' spark it, hey
