		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, it's Dolph
Hey, bring me some Backwoods up outta there, homie and a cup of ice
And some rubber bands up outta there too, homie, yeah
It's 3 PM, 80 degrees outside
I'm in somethin' that go real fast, sittin' outside the cornerstore
Six figure client got no business in this area

If it ain't one thing, it's a motherfuckin' 'nother (goddamn)
We trapped together than that's my motherfuckin' brother (that's my dog)
I pay her bills and buy her designer but I don't love her (hey, what you need, lil' mama?)
She just play her part when it's time to smug her (ayy, you ready?)
I pull up, pick up that bag, and burn rubber (skrrt)
I got a sweet tooth but I stay away from suckers (for real though)
Nobu in Malibu was my last supper (we eatin' good)
I fucked her in rush hour traffic, Chris Tucker (haha, yeah)
Everybody screamin' gang, gang, gang (gang)
Them folks come and get you, you gon' tell on the whole gang (gang)
She said can she fuck me with my diamond chains?
If I ain't in the bank, then I'm on the plane (yeah, hey)
'Bout to go get some money or go spend some money (yeah)
They stopped me in the airport, had too many Benjis on me (Franklins)
They don't want you to live, they don't want you to ball
Them pussies smile in your face, yeah, then they pray for you to fall, hey
Young nigga stay focused (yeah)
But I really want to crash (damn)
Think about where you at (okay)
Then think about your past (you right)
Yeah, I really came from shit (yeah)
But I won't change for shit (nah)
My bitch say I'm stuck in my ways (yeah)
My wrist say I been getting paid (yeah)

A hunnid shots, a hunnid shots
Me and my niggas pull up in a hunnid drops (skrrt)
My role model used to get a hunnid blocks (hey, hey)
Street niggas in a tuxedo, we the mob (yeah)

She looked at my watch too long, now she see stars (blaow, blaow)
I got so high last night I did a show on Mars (woo)
Yo' bitch ate my dick, I caught her on them bars (Xanax)
My pinky ring extra large (yeah)
Foreigns all in the garage
Remember my first m√©nage (yeah)
Yeah, Toya and Brittany (yup)
I'm shoppin' for diamonds at Tiffany's (Tiffany's)
Nah, I don't got no sympathy (nah)
She blew my whistle like a referee (wet)
Broke black nigga, remember me? (Hey)
Until I found out that recipe (yeah, woo)
Started gettin' 'bout ten a week (yeah)
Finger on the trigger when I sleep (yup)
Yeah, nigga, I rather you than me (yeah)
Backseat, smokin' good weed (Gelato)

A hunnid shots (a hunnid shots), a hunnid shots (a hunnid shots)
How the fuck you miss a whole hunnid shots?

You not welcome at my trap if you don't shop (ayy, get out, bruh)
Before you come through that back door you better knock (ayy, get the door)
They been waitin' on this gangster shit to drop (bulletproof)
Even them fuck niggas that wish I could be stopped (yeah, hey, hey)
How many dicks you sucked to get that couple million? (Hahaha)
Self made millionaire, oh what a feelin' (yeah, yeah)
My niggas came from dealin' (ayy)
Fuck nigga get out your feelings (ayy)
Your bitch gave me sexual healin' (woo)
Guess who just walked in the buildin'? (It's Dolph)
Came out with six bitches (wet)
My uncle said, "That's pimpin'"
My diamonds always hittin' (uh)
You lookin' for your bitch, she with me nigga, she ain't missin' (nah)
I told you fuck niggas stay out my way, but you didn't listen (stupid ass niggas, yeah)
Big rocks (hey, hey), in my watch (in my watch)
And we put extensions in all of the Glocks (haha)

A hunnid shots (a hunnid shots), a hunnid shots (a hunnid shots)
How the fuck you miss a whole hunnid shots?
Yeah, it's Dolph
How the fuck you miss a whole hunnid shots?
