		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Been a hell of a week, but we made it
Yeah, we made it
Yeah, the bar's shutting down, but we staying
Yeah, we staying

Only got so long 'til the morning comes
And life is too short to be wasted

So light me up
Twist me something good, make it strong enough
Last long enough
Before the night is up
Just give me something good, pour me all your love
Make it strong enough
I'm never coming down
Make it strong enough
I'm never coming down

Always say what I want when I'm faded
And I'm faded, oh
Put it on, play our song 'til we break it
'Til we break it

Only got so long 'til the morning comes
And life is too short to be wasted

So light me up (light me up)
Twist me something good, make it strong enough
Last long enough
Before the night is up (the night is up)
Just give me something good, pour me all your love
Make it strong enough
I'm never coming down (never coming down)
Make it strong enough, I'm never coming down
(Strong enough, make it strong enough)
(Make it strong enough, make it strong enough)
I'm never coming down

Never coming down
Never coming down, yeah
Never coming down
Never coming down
Never coming down

So light me up
Twist me something good, make it strong enough
Last long enough
Before the night is up
Just give me something good, pour me all your love
Make it strong enough
I'm never coming down
(Strong enough, make it strong enough)
(Make it strong enough, make it strong enough)
I'm never coming down
Never coming down 
(Make it strong enough, make it strong enough)
I'm never coming down
