		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A heart of gold
But it lost it's pride
Beautiful veins
And bloodshot eyes
I see your face
In another light

Why'd you have to go
And let it die
Why'd you have to go
And let it die
Why'd you have to go
And let it die
In too deep
And out of time
Why'd you have to go
And let it die

A simple man
And his blushing bride
(Why'd you have to go)
(And let it die)
Intravenous
Intertwined
(Why'd you have to go)
(And let it die)
Hearts gone cold
Your hands were tied
(Why'd you have to go)
(And let it die)

Why'd you have to go
And let it die
(Why'd you have to go)
(And let it die)
Why'd you have to go
And let it die
Why'd you have to go
And let it die
In too deep
And out of time
Why'd you have to go
And let it die

Do you ever think of me
You're so considerate
Did you ever think of me
Oh, so considerate

In too deep
And lost in time
Why'd you have to go
And let it die
Beautiful veins
And bloodshot eyes
Why'd you have to go
And let it die
Hearts gone cold
And hands are tied
Why'd you have to go
And let it die
Why'd you have to go
And let it die

Do you ever think of me
You're so considerate
Did you ever think of me
Oh, so considerate

In too deep
And lost in time
Why'd you have to go
And let it die
Beautiful veins
And bloodshot eyes
Why'd you have to go
And let it die
Hearts gone cold
And hands are tied
Why'd you have to go
And let it die
Why'd you have to go
And let this die
Why'd you have to go
And let this die
Why'd you have to go
And let this die
Why'd you have to go
And let this die
Why'd you have to go
And let it die
