		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The beauty of death
I want you to know I will remember you

The beauty of death
I want you to know I will remember you

Can’t you say another word
Can’t you stay a little longer
Can’t you see that I am hurt
I can’t let you go

Seems like you're blessed with this curse
Fade into another world
Where there’s nothing left to fear
Can I let you go?

The beauty of death
I want you to know I will remember you

The beauty of death
I want you to know I will remember you

The beauty of death
I’m letting you go
Cause our time has come to an end

The beauty of death
I want you to know
We will meet again under the earth

I’m the witness you're the stolen
Darkness grabbed you by the sole
Bring the light so I can see
When I let you go

When everything is broken
Nothing matters anymore
Promise me to set me free
When I let you go

The beauty of death
I want you to know I will remember you

The beauty of death
I want you to know I will remember you

The beauty of death
I’m letting you go
Cause our time has come to an end

The beauty of death
I want you to know
We will meet again under the earth

Rain on my face I’m choking 
No sign no trace I’m broken
No track to chase 
But in my mind you’ll stay with me

The beauty of death
I’m letting you go
Cause our time has come to an end

The beauty of death
I want you to know
We will meet again under the earth
