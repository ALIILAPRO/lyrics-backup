		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Self medicate
While they sleep, we let the night chase
Evil things away
And we're like animals homesick from shows
We've got to kill everything before the night gets wasted

Maybe it's seem so strange
But we don't even stress at all
'Cause we've got poisons in our wall
(Poisons in our wall)

Come at me with everything you've got.

Burst into flames, scream in the dark
I'm gonna light up this place
And die in beautiful stars tonight

Does it even make a difference?
When I'm sober, I feel pain
'Cause we run under the stars through cemetery backyards,
Celebrate the way the night hides scars.

So dance!
If it moves you
Jump in the fire
If it burns you
I'll throw my arms around you darling
And we'll turn to ashes drowning in the flame

Scream in the dark
I'm gonna light up this place and die in beautiful stars!

What if these demons keep falling from the sky?
Sometimes I love the way you swing the flame and everything inside!

Separate me from my own two hands, I've killed so many times,
But I can't save the world from the creatures that don't die.

I kinda like the way you tell me, "baby, please come home,
I need you here right now,
I'm crying in the water so you don't hear the sound"

Burst into flames, scream in the dark!
I'm gonna light up this place oh oh oh yeah!

And I will be the only light
I'll be the only light
