		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Saying, "I'll come back" might make it easier to leave
Need to run free for a while, I need some time to breathe
I see years go by and it scares me sometimes
I'm so afraid to live wrong and end up being on my own

What do you do when you love someone
But feel like you can't go on, oh you can't go on?
What do you do when you love so hard
That you just, you float apart and you're falling apart inside?

Maybe I ain't someone I used to be
Babe, something has changed in the way you look at me
There's something in your eyes, you seem unsure somehow
And so do I, but I could never lie to you, no
No, I don't want to lie

Just tell me what do you do when you love someone
But feel like you can't go on, oh you can't go on?
What do you do when you love so hard
That you just, you float apart and you're falling apart inside?

And I, I've been running all my life
And I could go for miles and miles and miles
I could go for miles and miles and miles
And I could keep on telling lies
Say everything's gonna be alright
But I think it's fair to say we've tried
I think it's fair to say we've tried

What do you do when you love someone
But feel like you can't go on, oh you can't go on?
What do you do when you love so hard
That you just, you float apart and you're falling apart inside?

What do you do when you love someone
But feel like you can't go on, oh, no you can't go on?
What do you do when you love so hard
That you just, you float apart and you're falling apart
You fall apart, yeah, you fall apart
