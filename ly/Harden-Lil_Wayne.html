		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No cap

She love me or leave me
I gave her a reason
She don't want a reason, she don't wanna see me
She don't wan' believe me
I tell her that's cold, I'm already freezin'
My heart ain't even beatin'
Just talked to the Reaper, he put me on speaker
He told me to keep you

I know I ain't perfect, I shouldn't need to work on it
A nigga been workin', I know you uncertain
You ride for me and I drive you crazy
I know I've been swervin', I know you've been nervous
I know I've been reckless, now you all heartless
And I was all worthless, I don't deserve it
You don't deserve this, I turned a blessin' into a burden
I'm really sorry, I know it don't fix it
A nigga been wishin', that I could reverse it
I know it don't help it, I know I look selfish
And looks are deceiving, but you lookin' further
And you lookin' past me, I'm just a has been
How did this happen? What is the current?
Where's your endurance?
You actin' like you've never been in love, like you just a tourist
Shit was the purest, 'til you got curious
You know that love don't come with insurance
I blame the juries who put me on trial
They was sick of your smile, now we just cured 'em
That got me furious, people that knew of us
Tell me "They sorry", I said "That made two of us"
Wonder what ruined 'em
Wonder how beautiful you look at your wedding when I'm at my funeral
Goddamn

(Love me or leave me)
Love me or leave me
(Let me go my own way)

She love me or leave me
I gave her a reason
She don't want a reason, she don't wanna see me
She don't wan' believe me
I tell her that's cold, I'm already freezin'
My heart ain't even beatin'
Just talked to the Reaper, he put me on speaker
He told me to keep you

I tried to call, but I couldn't reach you
You blocked my number
I feel like, James Harden, you block my jumper, goddamn

Who you lovin', who you wanna be fuckin'?
Since it ain't me, just tell that homie he lucky
I'm lonely for nothing', I'm starin'' at the phone and the button
To call em' to come in
I'm starin' at the walls I been punchin' these walls, did me nothin'
I'm thinkin' 'bout the ball I've been fumblin'
When stars were abundant
This shit happened and all of the sudden
The toilet start flushin'
Try to avoid the confrontin', the joy, the consumption
Where outside noises seduction, it's harder to function
Look up at the angels, they hoverin', they show me the light
They told me that I know that I'm wrong, but I don't know what's right
Goddamn

(Love me) You must hate me (or leave me)
Love me or leave me
(Let me go my own way)

She love me or leave me
I gave her a reason
She don't want a reason, she don't wanna see me
She don't wan' believe me
I tell her that's cold, I'm already freezin'
My heart ain't even beatin'
Just talked to the Reaper, he put me on speaker
He told me to keep you

So I tried to call, but I couldn't reach ya
You blocked my number
I feel like, James Harden, you block my jumper, goddamn
