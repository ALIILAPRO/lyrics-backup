		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My God
The angels talking
The demons in his body got him walking rotten
Can't stop
The mind from plotting
The second that he get it
Going on and on and
On we're gone and on and on
We faded
On we're gone and on and on
We faded
On we're gone and on and on
We faded
On we're gone and on and on
We faded
Oh my God
Have I faded waited
Took my life
To find why I hate it
These bright lights
Advice I debated
These white knives
Are why I'm sedated
On we're gone and on and on
We faded
On we're gone and on and on
We faded
On we're gone and on and on
We faded
On we're gone and on and on
We faded
I'm better numb
Only a loaded gun could tell me when the devil won
You better run
Cuz all the voices in my head have painted my eyes red
Sick kid live it up
Pitted in mud
Bid it giving it love but its numb now
Hit it til you up
Scripted little punk
Wicked giving it none so its numb now
I been feeling that noose again
What a million dollars couldn't really do to end
Had a million problems drowning in the booze again
Cutting loose all the ties that I used to sin
My God
The angels talking
The demons in his body got him walking rotten
Can't stop
The mind from plotting
The second that he get it
Going on and on and
On we're gone and on and on
We faded
On we're gone and on and on
We faded
On we're gone and on and on
We faded
On we're gone and on and on
We faded
Oh my God
Have I faded waited
Took my life
To find why I hate it
These bright lights
Advice I debated
These white knives
Are why I'm sedated
On we're gone and on and on
We faded
On we're gone and on and on
We faded
On we're gone and on and on
We faded
On we're gone and on and on
We faded
Same vein
The bullets and crosses
The marry go around they proud the melody profits
Same hate
The sonnets of monsters
The voices in my head have gotten fucking obnoxious
I don't feel
Like I wanna leave
I'm a wanna be
Cuz I wanna breath
I don't steal
Cuz I don't believe
In the cult of thieves
And a bolt of greed
And if you do to
I don't need you who
Wanna see voodoo
To myself with the help
of the few who view
Me as true blue too
What a fee for you
Just to bleed with me
My God
The angels talking
The demons in his body got him walking rotten
Can't stop
The mind from plotting
The second that he get it
Going on and on and
On we're gone and on and on
We faded
On we're gone and on and on
We faded
On we're gone and on and on
We faded
On we're gone and on and on
We faded
Oh my God
Have I faded waited
Took my life
To find why I hate it
These bright lights
Advice I debated
These white knives
Are why I'm sedated
On we're gone and on and on
We faded
On we're gone and on and on
We faded
On we're gone and on and on
We faded
On we're gone and on and on
We faded
