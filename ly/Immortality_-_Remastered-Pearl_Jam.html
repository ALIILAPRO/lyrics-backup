		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Vacate is the word
Vengeance has no place so near to her
Cannot find the comfort in this world

Artificial tear
Vessel stabbed, next up, volunteer?
Vulnerable wisdom can't adhere

A truant finds home
And I wish to hold on
But there's a trapdoor in the sun

Immortality

As privileged as a whore
Victims in demand for public show
Swept out through the cracks beneath the door

Holier than thou, how?
Surrendered, executed, anyhow
Scrawl dissolved, cigar box on the floor

A truant finds home 
And I wish to hold on, too
But saw the trapdoor in the sun

Immortality

I cannot stop the thought
I'm running in the dark
Coming up a which way sign
All good truants must decide

Oh, stripped and sold mom
Auctioned forearm
And whiskers in the sink

Truants move on 
Cannot stay long
Some die just to live
