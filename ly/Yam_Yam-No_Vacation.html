		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Why don't you take off your red shoes
So we can end our night well spent?
And why don't you say what's on your mind?
I won't run away

I won't turn away, won't turn away
Won't turn away
I won't turn away, won't turn away
Won't turn away

When morning comes our way, I'll be here to stay
When morning comes our way, I'll be here to stay
When morning comes our way, I'll be here to stay
When morning comes our way, I'll be here to stay

Starin' at a distance, this warmth is hard to find
Sittin' in the silence, I gave my best, I tried
Simply a distraction I didn't hope to find
Sittin' by my side, I hope you're here to stay

I won't turn away, won't turn away
Won't turn away
I won't turn away, won't turn away
Won't turn away

When morning comes our way, I'll be here to stay
When morning comes our way, I'll be here to stay
When morning comes our way, I'll be here to stay
When morning comes our way, I'll be here to stay
