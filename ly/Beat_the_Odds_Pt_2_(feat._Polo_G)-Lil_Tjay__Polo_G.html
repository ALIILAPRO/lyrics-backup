		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Grateful for the shit I got 'cause I come from a hard life
Demons on my mental, saw some shit I wanna archive
Feds lurkin' now, tryna bring a nigga down
Just thinkin' 'bout the possibility, I frown
Far out in that water, Father, don't let me drown
I can hear my grandma sayin', "Don't let me down"
People wanna kill me, always keep my gun 'round
Pray I squeeze first, I can't lose the millies I found

Uh, more beefs, so we got more choppers
Clean sweep, we hit 'em so proper
Knee deep, been on that road, mama
And my new nina'll sing like a soap opera
For the gang that's how I bleed, don't need no doctor
I can't see us lose, it's safe to say we got a cold roster
Glock work, I travel with that rock like I'm a Globetrotter
He ain't never post up or trap to get his own dollars
Can't trust a ho, 'cause all them lies she told a whole lot of
Now she turn to somethin' I pass on
Got a pretty bitch down in Philly, she a bad jawn
Like "Slow it down, I can't fuck you to no fast song"
A trip to Miami, had the doctor put her ass on
My prayers weren't answered like I'm talkin' to the skies wrong
Ditch to hit the block, I used to hate to be in class long
Jim Carrey, I'm a different person with that mask on
You don't wanna be the one that we hop out and spazz on, uh

Grateful for the shit I got 'cause I come from a hard life
Demons on my mental, saw some shit I wanna archive
Feds lurkin' now, tryna bring a nigga down
Just thinkin' 'bout the possibility, I frown
Far out in that water, Father, don't let me drown
I can hear my grandma sayin', "Don't let me down"
People wanna kill me, always keep my gun 'round
Pray I squeeze first, I can't lose the millies I found

Bussin' off the stoinky wishin' I was off a bean, no stalk
I was hungry for that money like a fiend
Too deep in that water, my life ain't have no order
Melodic blue stories, I'm feelin' like Baby Keem
I ain't Dr. Seuss but I keep two things
Nina pop, never got time to record, but she sing
They run track, I know I will be a dummy if I lack
Brodie never been nowhere, but still he always tryna pack
And subtract, I'm rich but now I'm tryna get richer
Been flyin' private lately, TSA been dyin' for pictures
I do my own thing, ain't the biggest artist yet, no shame
Writin' bars 'til they sink in, got me so drained
Flow Wayne, I don't give a fuck about no ceiling
Catch a opp and we gon' send him to the sky
They be like, "Tjay, why do you move around with all them fuckin' guns?"
I just tell 'em that's 'cause I don't wanna die
And trust me, I don't lie, can't fuck up, I'm a star right now
If I wasn't quick to blow, I would be in the stars right now
Big ol' chains, I could buy like seven cars right now
Never count me out, I won't let the bars pipe down
Off a deuce, like I'm tryna go to Mars right now
Really live this life, it ain't just no fa√ßades I found
I see a opp, that's on bro, he better dodge my round
My last killer get like Nicki Minaj in the gown
I'm so-

Grateful for the shit I got 'cause I come from a hard life
Demons on my mental, saw some shit I wanna archive
Feds lurkin' now, tryna bring a nigga down
Just thinkin' 'bout the possibility, I frown
Far out in that water, Father, don't let me drown
I can hear my grandma sayin', "Don't let me down"
People wanna kill me, always keep my gun 'round
Pray I squeeze first, I can't lose the millies I found
