		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Remember when I took you
Up to the top of the hill?
We had our knives drawn

They were as sharp
As we were in love
If god crossed us
We'd take all his drugs
Burn his money
And his house down
And wait for the fire to spread

Sometimes hate is not enough
To turn this all to ashes
Together as one
Against all others
Break all of our wings
And make sure it crashes

We're running to the
Edge of the world
Running, running away
We're running to the edge of the world
I don't know if the world will end today

I had no choice
To erase the debt of our families
Let you say goodbye
With lips like dynamite
And everyone
Turned their backs
Because they knew
When we held on tight
To each other
We were something fatal
That fell into the wrong hands

Sometimes hate is not enough
To turn this all to ashes
Together as one
Against all others
Break all of your wings
And make sure it crashes

We're running to the edge of the world
Running, running away
We're running to the edge of the world
I don't know if the world will end today

We don't see death, we see destruction
Death, we see destruction

We don't see death, we see destruction
Death, we see destruction

We're running to the edge of the world
Running, running away
We're running to the edge of the world
But I don't know if the world will end today

We're running to the edge of the world
Running, running away
We're running to the edge of the world
Don't know if the world will end today

See a new beginning rise behind the sun
We can never catch up to them as fast as we run
See a new beginning rise behind the sun
We can never catch up to them as fast as we run
See a new beginning rise behind the sun
We can never catch up to them as fast as we run
See a new beginning rise behind the sun
We can never catch up to them as fast as we run
