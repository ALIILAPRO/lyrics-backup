		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I keep falling backward and it never ends
but it's cool
as long as your next to me

feel love in lightyears
in the summer air
and it's cool
the way you're affecting me

cut me out and let me feel the pain
make me never wanna live again
try to tell me who I wanna be
my real friends are my enemies
things are never gonna feel the same
the dead of night will now become the day
try to tell me who I wanna be
I just wanna be
alone

I keep counting forwards
till the ticker melts
but it's cool
as long as you're next to me
your kiss keeps leaving bruises on my heavy heart
but it's cool
the way you're affecting me

cut me out and let me feel the pain
make me never w hi anna live again
try to tell me who I wanna be
my real friends are my enemies
things are never gonna feel the same
the dead of night will now become the day
try to tell me who I wanna be
I just wanna be
alone

simmer down
you won't make sound
I keep on drowning
You're holding me down
