		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was at a funeral the day I realized
I wanted to spend my life with you
Sitting doen on the steps at the old post office
The flag was flying at half-mast
And I was thinkin' 'bout how everyone is dying
And maybe it's time to live

I don't know where we're going
I don't know what we'll do

Walked in to the Thrif-tee
Saw the man with the hollow eyes who didn't give me all the change
But it didn't bother me this time 'cause I know I've only got this moment
I went to the gas station
Old woman honked her horn
Waiting for me to fix her car

I don't know where we're going
I don't know what we'll do

Laying in bed tonight I was thinking
And listening to all the dogs
And the sirens and the shots
And how a careful man tries
To dodge the bullets
While a happy man takes a walk

And maybe it's time to live
