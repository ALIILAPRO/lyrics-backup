		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Go on and take your best shot
Blow them away

I don't know why
And lately I don't understand 
Why the world's so blind
And no one seems to give a damn

Don't let them say 
That you can't be the things that you
Don't believe them

You gotta take your best shot
Blow them away

I don't know why
Everything's not okay
Try before you die
'Cause that just might be today

Don't let them say 
That you can't be the things that you want
Just believe in yourself

And take your best shot
Blow them away

This is your life
What are you gonna do
