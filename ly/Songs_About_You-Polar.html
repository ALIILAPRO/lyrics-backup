		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How'd you do if you knew
All my songs are 'bout you?
Making me feel like a fool
'Cause you don't look at me
The way you used to do
Splitting my heart in two
Baby tell me how you feel
When you hear that song I wrote you
Back when we were seventeen
Did you even keep the CD?
I remember every verse, every line and every word
You been my world, so absurd

I'm so tired of writing songs about you
But there's no one else leaving me so blue
Sick and tired of writing songs about you
But nobody else thrills me like you do

Sitting here wondering why
None else blows my mind
So I keep on holding the line
I'm so stuck, stuck on us
Make the move, please hang up
Hands down I'll never give us up
Baby tell me how you feel
When you hear that song I wrote you
Back when we were seventeen
Did you even keep the CD?
I remember every verse, every line and every word
You been my world, so absurd

I'm so tired of writing songs about you
But there's no one else leaving me so blue
Sick and tired of writing songs about you
But nobody else thrills me like you do

I'm so wasted
You erased me
You don't face me like you used to do
I'm so sick of
Writing songs of
All the memories we been going through

I'm so tired of writing songs about you
But there's no one else leaving me so blue
Sick and tired of writing songs about you
But nobody else thrills me like you do

I'm so wasted
You erased me
You don't face me like you used to do
I'm so sick of
Writing songs of
All the memories we been going through
