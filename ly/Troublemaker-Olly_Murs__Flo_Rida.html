		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're a troublemaker (you're a troublemaker)

Ha
You ain't nothing but a troublemaker, girl

You had me hooked again from the minute you sat down
The way you bite your lip
Got my head spinnin' around
After a drink or two
I was putty in your hands
I don't know if I'll have the strength to stand

Oh whoa, trouble, troublemaker, yeah
That's your middle name, oh whoa
I know you're no good but you're stuck in my brain

And I wanna know, why does it feel so good but hurt so bad?
Whoa, my mind keeps saying, "Run as fast as you can"
I say I'm done but then you pull me back
Whoa, I swear you're giving me a heart attack, troublemaker

It's like you're always there in the corners of my mind
I see a silhouette every time I close my eyes
There must be poison in those finger tips of yours
'Cause I keep comin' back again for more

Oh whoa, trouble, troublemaker, yeah
That's your middle name, oh whoa
I know you're no good but you're stuck in my brain

And I wanna know, why does it feel so good but hurt so bad?
Whoa, my mind keeps saying, "Run as fast as you can"
I say I'm done but then you pull me back
Whoa, I swear you're giving me a heart attack, troublemaker

Why does it feel so good but hurt so bad? (Hurt so bad, yeah)
Whoa, my mind keeps saying, "Run as fast as you can" (troublemaker)
I say I'm done but then you pull me back
Whoa, I swear you're giving me a heart attack, troublemaker (yeah)

Maybe I'm insane
'Cause I keep doing the same damn thing
Thinkin' one day we gon' change
But you know just how to work that back
And make me forget my name
What the hell you do I won't remember
I'll be gone until November
And you'll show up again next summer, yeah
Typical middle name is Prada
Fit you like a glove, girl, I'm sick of the drama 
You're a troublemaker
But, damn, girl, it's like I love the trouble
And I can't even explain (yeah) why 

Why does it feel so good but hurt so bad?
Whoa (whoa), my mind keeps saying, "Run as fast as you can" (troublemaker)
(Yeah) I say I'm done but then you pull me back
Whoa, I swear you're giving me a heart attack, troublemaker

Why does it feel so good (oh) but hurt so bad? (And I can't even explain why)
Whoa, my mind keeps saying, "Run as fast as you can" (troublemaker)
I say I'm done but then you pull me back
Whoa, I swear you're giving me a heart attack, troublemaker
