		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I had a dream
This one I feel the need to mention
I was happy for a while and I stopped being scared
And ashamed to say what's on my mind
But you thought I'd change after a while
And said you better treat me different or else
Or else seems like a stupid fucking thing to say to someone like me
Someone like me

Wow,
Wow,
Wow,
Wo-wo-wo-wo-wo 
Wow

Don't be surprised I can look you in the eye
It's hard to take you serious when you take me Inside
Don't be surprised I can look you in the eye
It's hard to take you serious when you take me Inside
I'm worse than what you think you'd catch from me
Complicateds understated did you stop and take a look at who you fell in love with?
At who you fell in love with?
Does it matter how many times I say it?
It never gets old thats why I have to say

Wow,
Wow,
Wow,
Wo-wo-wo-wo-wo-wo-wo

Don't be surprised I can look you in the eye
It's hard to take you serious when you take me Inside
Don't be surprised I can look you in the eye
It's hard to take you serious when you take me Inside
It doesn't matter if you're going to come or just going
I never wanted you to come here anyway
There's a word thats like you 
Because it can be a noun a verb a exclamation or the thing I say
When something is unbelievable when 
I'm not able to believe how unbelievably unbelievable
That you believe you could not believable
That's when I have to say

Wow,
Wow,
Wow,
Wo-wo-wo-wo-wo-wo-wo
Wow

Don't be surprised I can look you in the eye
It's hard to take you serious when you take me Inside
Don't be surprised I can look you in the eye
It's hard to take you serious when you take me Inside
It doesn't matter how many times I say it
It never gets old
That's why I have to say

Wow
