		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Some will tell you that you're wrong
You do it all the wrong way
Some will tell you that you're wrong
That you don't know the way

They enjoy cheapness
Don't show your weakness
Don't let them bother you, no
They enjoy cheapness
Don't show your weakness
Oh no, no

It's no use sitting down
Don't walk 'round with a frown
Oh no, keep looking
It's no use sitting around
With your head in your hands
Oh no keep looking

Oh, la-la-la
Say let my life alone
La, la-la-la-la
Ooh-ooh, da-da

Some will tell you that you're wrong
You do it all the wrong way
Some will tell you that you're wrong
That you don't know the way

They enjoy cheapness
Don't show your weakness
Don't let them bother you, no
They enjoy cheapness
Don't show your weakness
Oh no, no

It's no use sitting down
Don't walk 'round with a frown
Oh no, keep looking
It's no use sitting around
With your head in your hands
Oh no, keep looking

Oh, oh
Keep looking
Oh, oh
Keep looking

Don't lay awake at night
Thinking about your worries
Thinking about your problems
Don't lay awake at night
Thinking about your worries
Keep looking
Don't lay awake at night
Thinking about your problems
Thinking about your troubles
Don't lay awake at night
Thinking about your problems
Keep looking

Keep looking

If you never let it show
They're never gonna know, oh (oh)
Keep looking

If you never let it show
They're never gonna know, oh (oh)
Keep looking

Oh no, keep looking
Keep looking
Keep looking
