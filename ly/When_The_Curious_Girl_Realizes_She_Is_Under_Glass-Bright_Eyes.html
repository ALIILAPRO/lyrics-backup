		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tomorrow when I wake up I'm finding my brother
And making him take me back down to the water
That lake where we sailed and laughed with our father
I will not desert him, I will not desert him

No matter how I may wish for a coffin so clean
Or these trees to undress all their leaves onto me
I put my face in the dirt and then finally I see
The sky that has been avoiding me

(You shine)
(Cool)
(Know who I am?)
That is exactly how I feel
This looks like "Blues 101"

I started this letter, I'm going to send it to Ruba
It will be blessed by her eyes on the gulf coast of Florida
With her feet in the sand and one hand on her swimsuit
She will recite the prayer of my pen

Saying, "Time take us forward, relief from this longing"
"They can land that plane on my heart, I don't care"
"Just give me November, the warmth of a whisper"
"In the freezing darkness of my room""

But no matter what I would do in an attempt to replace
All the pills that I take trying to balance my brain
I have seen the curious girl with that look on her face
So surprised she stares out from her display case
