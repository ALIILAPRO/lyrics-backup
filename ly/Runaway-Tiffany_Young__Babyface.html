		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm in love with you, ain't gon' tell no lie
They don't want me to, say I'm not your type
What I'm born to do, you stay on my mind
Every second of a minute, every day and night, oh

Boy, they don't know nothin', they hatin' cause I'm into you
If I had a dollar for each time they say things that ain't true
I'd be a billionairess, no Pérignon or Paris
Rich in the sense of our love (Oh)

Let's just run away, let's just run away now
We can find a way, I don't really care how
You just name the place I'll be on my way 'round (Way 'round)
You call my name, I'll be there waitin'
Let's just run away, can't we run away now?
Hear me when I say I don't wanna
Waste another day with you away from me
So, let's just run away right now

Run away now, run away now, run away (Shoo, shoo)
Run away now, run away now, run away (Shoo, shoo)
Run away now, run away now, run away (Shoo, shoo)
Run away, run, run away right now (Shoo, shoo)

I can't help the way I feel each day (You don't have to explain, boy)
I've never felt this way (I know, I feel the same)
So glad that you do (Shoo, shoo)
You know I'm crazy about you, baby (Shoo, shoo)
Woah

Boy, I'm so glad you got me and I got you (Got you)
If I had a dollar for each second that I think of you
I'd be a billionairess, no Pérignon or Paris
Rich in the scent of our love

Let's just run away, let's just run away now
We can find a way, I don't really care how (No)
You just name the place I'll be on my way 'round (Way 'round)
You call my name, I'll be there waitin'
Let's just run away, can't we run away now?
Hear me when I say I don't wanna
Waste another day with you away from me
So, let's just run away right now

Girl, I'll be there
Boy, I'll be there for you (For you)
To love and care for you (To love and care for you)
And I won't change, boy
It don't matter what they say 'bout you, boy
Let's just get away
So let's just run away right now

Let's just run away, let's just run away now
We can find a way, I don't really care how (Really care how)
You just name the place I'll be on my way 'round (Oh)
You call my name, I'll be there waitin' (Let's just run away)
Let's just run away, can't we run away now?
Hear me when I say I don't wanna
Waste another day with you away from me
So, let's just run away right now (Let's just run away)

Let's just run away, let's just run away now
We can find a way, I don't really care how (Really care how)
You just name the place I'll be on my way 'round
You call my name, I'll be there waitin' (Let's just run away)
Let's just run away, can't we run away now?
Hear me when I say I don't wanna
Waste another day with you away from me
So, let's just run away right now (Run away)
