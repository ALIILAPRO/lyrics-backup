		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I met you in the restaurant
You could tell I was no debutante
You asked me what's my pleasure
"A movie or a measure?"
I'll have a cup of tea
And tell you of my

Dreamin', dreamin' is free
Dreamin', dreamin' is free

I don't want to live on charity
Pleasure's real or is it fantasy?
Reel to reel is living rarity
People stop and stare at me
We just walk on by
We just keep on dreamin'

Beat feet, walking a two-mile
Meet me, meet me at the turnstile
I never met him, I'll never forget him
Dream, dream, even for a little while
Dream, dream, filling up an idle hour
Fade away (woo), radiate

I sit by and watch the river flow
I sit by and watch the traffic go
Imagine something of your very own
Something you can have and hold
I'd build a road in gold just to have some

Dreamin', dreamin' is free
Dreamin', dreamin' is free

Dreamin', (dream) dreamin' is free
(Dream) dreamin' is free
