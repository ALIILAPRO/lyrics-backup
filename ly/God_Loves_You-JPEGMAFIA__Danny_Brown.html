		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lift me up, turn me around now
Turn me around, lift my feet, yeah
Lift my feet off solid ground (da-damn, Peggy, what? Hahahaha)
Off solid ground, lift my feet, yeah
Lift my feet, off solid ground
Turn me around, lift my feet, yeah
Lift my feet, off solid ground
Off solid ground

Check
That pussy on my face, I'ma talk in tongues
Legs in the air, scream hallelujah
Make her squirt that Holy Water
Drinkin' on wine but no communion
Only my dick she is consumin'
On her knees, said, "Oh my God"
Pull the camera out, let's make a movie
Pussy wet like Noah's Ark
Go 'head, girl, just bless me
If you on your period, call me Moses
'Cause I'm about to split that red sea
Gimme that head like you're breakin' bread
I'm about to fuck you like the Twelve Disciples
Hold my balls like you do with your cross
Nut's on your back but I know ya like that
Her with my dick like David and Goliath
Take you thong off, flick it at me like a slingshot
Might give her cock on a mountaintop
Drop, drop, get it, get it, don't stop
We like Adam and Eve but I'ma eat that apple bottom
Snake in the grass, gon' shake that ass
Like Keith Sweat, I'ma make it last
When I ate that pussy, I broke my fast, hahaha

Uh
Now how many times I gotta tell you
When I get to that money, better shake that ass? (Great)
How many times I gotta tell you
When I get to that money, better come back fast?
Now how many times I gotta tell you
When I get to that money, better shake that shit?
Now many times, when I lace you with how many rhymes?
When I tell you somethin' that deep
And you come back and tell me it's fine?
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it
How many times I gotta tell you
When I get to that money, better shake that ass?

That pussy like baptist
To find my sauce, need a at-

Lift me up, turn me around now
Turn me around, lift my feet, yeah
Lift my feet, off solid ground
Off solid ground, lift my feet, yeah
Lift my feet, off solid ground
Turn me around, lift my feet, yeah
Lift my feet, off solid ground
Off solid ground
