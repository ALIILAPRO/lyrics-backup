		<p>
		  Hahaha, Nick, you're stupid

It's like every time I pick myself up, something brings me back down
I need you to get away from me
Look at all the drugs and the pain in me
Every time you look into my face you'll see
What you did to me, I've had enough
Over time everything's adding up
I want things to get better, I don't wanna break up
I don't wanna fight, I just wanna make up

I think you look better without all the makeup
I don't wanna fuck, girl, I wanna make love
I just wanna taste, you just wanna take drugs, ah
I don't need hate, just a little more love
It's like everything is better when it's only just us
I don't wanna fight, girl, I don't wanna fuss
I just want the right girl, it's like I'm outta luck
You just caught up in the hype, girl, you don't know what's up

It's like every time I pick myself up, something brings me back down
I need you to get away from me
Look at all the drugs and the pain in me
Every time you look into my face you'll see
What you did to me, I've had enough
Over time everything's adding up
I want things to get better, I don't wanna break up
I don't wanna fight, I just wanna make up

It's like every time I pick myself up, something brings me back down
I need you to get away from me
Look at all the drugs and the pain in me
Every time you look into my face you'll see
What you did to me, I've had enough
Over time everything's adding up
I want things to get better, I don't wanna break up
I don't wanna fight, I just wanna make up
