		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No one on the streets and the city is quiet
I should be asleep by the heat of the fire
But I'm on my way out
And I'm gonna stay out
I can feel the pulse as I walk in the door
Take me through the crowd, to the middle of the floor
The red and the green lights
Are hitting me just right

Nothing more, nothing less
I got one request

DJ, play a Christmas song
I wanna be dancing all night long
It's cold outside, but it's warm in here
And that's the only thing I want this year
DJ, play a Christmas song
I wanna be dancing all night long
It's tough outside, but it's love in here
And that's the only thing I want this year

Everybody here must be feeling the same
Need a little joy and a little escape
Feeling a spirit (feeling a spirit)
You just wanna hear it

Nothing more, nothing less
I got one request

DJ, play a Christmas song
I wanna be dancing all night long
It's cold outside, but it's warm in here
And that's the only thing I want this year
DJ, play a Christmas song
I wanna be dancing all night long
It's tough outside, but it's love in here
And that's the only thing I want this year

That's the only thing I want this year
That's the only thing I want this year
That's the only thing I want this year
That's the only thing I want this year

DJ, play a Christmas song
I wanna be dancing, dancing all night long

DJ, play a Christmas song
I wanna be dancing all night long
It's cold outside, but it's warm in here
And that's the only thing I want this year
DJ, play a Christmas song
I wanna be dancing all night long
It's tough outside, but it's love in here
And that's the only thing I want this year

That's the only thing I want this year (DJ, play a Christmas song)
That's the only thing I want this year (I wanna be dancing all night long)
That's the only thing I want this year (it's cold outside, but it's warm in here)
And that's the only thing I want this year
