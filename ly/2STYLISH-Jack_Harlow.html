		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Too stylish (bae), she too fly
Make me lose balance, back it up
Like we taking over for the '99 and the 2000's
The city, that's mine
I need a new challenge
I can't tell if you 'bout it

I doubt it
Baddies at the club and they got ya boy surrounded
She want me to pound it
Said she want my kids but they grounded
I been staying focused, got me celibate
I could be selling dick
Now I'm in my element
Y'all boys irrelevant
Me and Jenius we got hella hits
I don't know what jealous is
'Cause I ain't never felt the shit
Feeling like myself again
Feeling like the man, ooh
I got some stories I can tell my kids
You got some stories you can tell your friends
About my grace and my elegance

Too stylish, she too fly
Make me lose balance, back it up
Like we taking over for the '99 and the 2000's
The city that's mine I need a new challenge
I can't tell if you 'bout it

She on that Smirnoff Ice
Get right to it we don't turn off lights
She done got some money now she wear Off White
Off of the white, got her turnt all night
All right, them boys said on sight, it's all lies
Big dog to these small fries, yeah
10s with me, you got all 5s, yeah
I might be the greatest all time

Too stylish, she too fly
Make me lose balance, back it up
Like we taking over for the '99 and the 2000's
The city that's mine I need a new challenge
I can't tell if you 'bout it

Too stylish, she too fly
Make me lose balance, back it up
Like we taking over for the '99 and the 2000's
The city that's mine I need a new challenge
I can't tell if you 'bout it
