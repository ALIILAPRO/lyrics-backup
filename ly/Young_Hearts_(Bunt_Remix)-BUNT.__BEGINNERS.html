		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Young hearts just learning to walk
For the first time
Lovers on lock with a cross of the heart
Hoping not to die

Ask anyone
Life goes fast, faster when you're older
So don't close your eyes and
Come back when it's over
Young hearts leave it all
Leave it all behind
And I already told ya, I'm here to stay
Hell or high water, I'll find a way
And I won't give up if I don't get paid
And I'll do it my way

Young hearts on fire, rebel runaways
Burning with desire, chasing time away
Young hearts on fire, you know they say
Better to go up in flames than fade away

Young hearts once broken apart
Coming back to life
Tangled in knots, what a way to get caught
It was worth the ride

Ask anyone
Life goes fast, faster when you're older
So don't pay no mind
Keep marching like a soldier
Young hearts put it on, put it on the line
And I already told ya, I'm here to stay
Hell or high water, I'll find a way
And I won't give up if I don't get paid
And I'll do it my way

Young hearts on fire, rebel runaways
Burning with desire, chasing time away
Young hearts on fire, you know they say
Better to go up in flames than fade away
Than fade away
