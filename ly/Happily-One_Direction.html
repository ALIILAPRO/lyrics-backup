		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You don't understand, you don't understand
What you do to me when you hold his hand
We were meant to be but a twist of fate
Made it so you had to walk away

'Cause we're on fire
We are on fire
We're on fire now
Yeah, we're on fire
We are on fire
We're on fire now

I don't care what people say when we're together
You know I wanna be the one to hold you when you sleep
I just want it to be you and I forever
I know you wanna leave
So c'mon baby be with me
So happily

It's four a.m. and I know that you're with him
I wonder if he knows that I touched your skin
And if he feels my traces in your hair
Sorry, love, but I don't really care

'Cause we're on fire
We are on fire
We're on fire now
Yeah, we're on fire
We are on fire
We're on fire now

I don't care what people say when we're together
You know I wanna be the one to hold you when you sleep
I just want it to be you and I forever
I know you wanna leave
So c'mon baby be with me
So happily

So happily
One, two, three, four!

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
We're on fire now
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
We're on fire now (we're on fire)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
We're on fire now

I don't care what people say when we're together
You know I wanna be the one to hold you when you sleep
I just want it to be you and I forever
I know you wanna leave
So c'mon baby be with me
So happily

I don't care what people say when we're together
You know I wanna be the one to hold you when you sleep
I just want it to be you and I forever
I know you wanna leave
So c'mon baby be with me
So happily
