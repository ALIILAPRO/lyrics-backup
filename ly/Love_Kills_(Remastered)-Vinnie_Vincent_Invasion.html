		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So long since I've waited
To live again
You've brought my world to an end
Love takes its victim and leaves its remains
My broken heart has died in vain
Tell me why have we forsaken the dreams we had
The pain makes it so hard to understand
You're a lifetime ago but a memory away
And I'll love you till my resurrection day
Love kills the fire's gone
Dying embers still remain
Love kills and now you're gone
Girl, I'll never be the same again
Without your love, seems so dead and unreal
And now there's nothing left to feel
Someday we'll meet again, girl that much I know
At heaven's gate we'll say hello
Now I hear the wind is calling my lonely,
Lonely soul
For sorrow's trembling hands please let me go
Love's dying sin is just dust in the wind
I face the other side of no tomorrow
Love kills the fire's gone
Dying ember still remains
Love kills and now you're gone
Girl I'll never be the same
Love kills and love is just a dying ember in the rain
Love kills a heart betrayed, Lord please, please
Please ease my pain, love kills
Girl I need your love
Love kills with all its heart
