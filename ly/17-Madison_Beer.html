		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Seventeen, I can't recall a thing
A cry for help, but no one's ever listening
My life moved faster than the speed of sound
Wish I could go there now
And slow down

Ain't it strange, how people tend to change?
I hope she knows that I would never blame her
'Cause all she did was all she knew

Oh, is it too late now, to slow down?

All my life I've never had the chance
To stop and smell the flowers (flowers)
All this time, I never got to sit
And dream away the hours

My memories, like black and white TV
And everybody says it'll be okay
Like life is just a game
But I don't wanna play

Twenty-one, it should've been so fun
Cherry red, I wish I had more time
This summer skin, it fades too quick somehow

Oh, is it too late now, to slow down?

All my life I've never had the chance
To stop and smell the flowers (flowers)
All this time, I never got to sit
And dream away the hours

My memories, like black and white TV
And everybody says it'll be okay
Like life is just a game
But I don't wanna play

Ooh, ooh, ooh
I don't wanna
Ooh, ooh, ooh
I don't wanna
