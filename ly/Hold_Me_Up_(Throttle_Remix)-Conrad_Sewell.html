		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In a minute you can realize you lost it all
In a second you were always there to break my fall
Till you came and saved my life
In the lonely hour
In the lonely hour
Oh I'm praying for some help

I can't do it by myself, need you now
Need you right now
You know there ain't nobody else
Who can save me from this hell
Need you now, I need you right now

So hold me up, oh
I know you'll never let me down
Need you to hold me up, I
I need someone like you around
So hold me up, oh
Hold me up, no
I know you'll never let me down
Said hold me up, oh
Hold me up, no
I need someone like you around
Can you hold me up

I wanna tell you secrets no ones ever heard before
I wanna give you everything, all of my heart and more
'Cause you came and saved my life
In the lonely hour
In the lonely hour
Oh praying for some help

I can't do it by myself, need you now
Need you right now
So hold me up, oh
I know you'll never let me down

Need you to hold me up, I
I need someone like you around
So hold me up, oh
Hold me up, no
I know you'll never let me down
Said hold me up, oh
Hold me up, no
I need someone like you around
Can you hold me up

So hold me up
(Don't ever let me go go go)
(Don't ever let me go go go)
(Don't ever let me go go go)
So hold me up
Hold me up

Don't ever let me go go go
Don't ever let me go go go
So hold me up
Hold me up
(Don't ever let me go go go)
(Don't ever let me go go go)
So hold me up, oh
Hold me up, yeah
I know you'll never let me down
Said hold me up, oh
Hold me up, no
I need someone like you around
So can you hold me up
Oh baby
Oh baby
So hold me up now
I know you'll never let me down

Hold me up
