		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't wanna be
Sitting in the mezzanine
I'm tryna make it up to us
She with me but I could not
See herself on open eyes
Tryna make it home tonight
Inside my head its someone else
I could let you
Stay tonight
By my side
I would end holding my breath
If I could let you live in me
Closed my eyes
I see you crying
Misery or is my way
Am I tryna heal the pain
If I had something that I could-not hide
It's hurting me enough to say that
If I had something that I could-not hide
It's hurting me enough to say
I miss you
