		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is the ressistance movement
A new life for the executed
The blackusted soul recruitment, brainwashed
Turn it off, turn it off, turn it off

We're spilling our guts, we're spitting out blood
Who's first in the river?
Stop struggling, struggling
You'll only sink further in
They're throwing you in a lifeline, down to hell

They'll sing mislead, mislead, drain us of our
Differences keep the freedom of life
Under the gun they'll take our rights
We'll take them back again

This is a death race, just another world trait of a broken system
It's like the blind lead the bund to the wrong decisions
Possessed by the pace of life, we'll burn a living
They're running out of plots to burn
The casualties, out of sight, out of mind

Mislead, mislead, drain us of our differences
Keep the freedom of life under the gun
They'll take our rights, we'll take them back again

We won't fail, we'll find a way
We won't fail, we'll fucking find a way

Tell us how to think, tell us what we need
Tell us how to live, show us who to be
Another product of the system
Turn it off, turn it off, turn it off
We're being brainwashed
