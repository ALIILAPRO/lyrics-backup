		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  cy, spin with my dawg never step alone
I got the key like I'm never home
Standin on business, slide with the quickness
Spin on yo block til I'm dead and gone
I talk to God through a megaphone
Hoo hoo
I was a gremlin, I was a villain
That's just the path I was headed on

It's some treacherous waters I treaded on
Paid the price on that block when I bled alone
Livin fast cause we don't know who next to go
I got God in my blood my genetics strong
Me and twin gone pop out with some pressure on
Holy water I can't live by bread alone
Lost my dawg to a bullet I'm hella cold
Now I'm building my family a better home
Heaven knows that I came from the grief and hurt
With demons lurkin that's all that we ever known
Let it go, if you want me to teach a verse or preach a sermon
Then turn on a separate song
I just black out and hop on these tracks back to back
With more gas than a Gresham road Texaco and let em know
cll my problems lookin microscopic when I take off in my rocket
I got the industry panicking, cookin these beats in a pan again
I'll turn a man to a mannequin, for a band I might abandon him
Get the van and we gon vanish him, no no no
In His will I'm in His plan again, bury rappers like I planted them
They will never understand, why I stand the way I stand
Cause I step where they never go

Spin with my dawg never step alone
I got the key like I'm never home
Standin on business, slide with the quickness
Spin on yo block til I'm dead and gone
I talk to God through a megaphone
Hoo hoo
I was a gremlin, I was a villain
That's just the path I was headed on

Check the flow when I hop in the booth with Messiah
I break up the truth from the liar (okay)
Never folded just look at my pedigree
I'm a big dog and I bet yo pet agree 
I'm a rider
Why would I need Zeus or Poseidon 
When I got Jerusalem's Lion? (okay)
I got heavenly wealth in a treasury
When you step with the real ain't no treachery
It be the main people claiming they're spiritual
That throw a spear at you
I don't stress em they go in my mirror view
Gotta keep steering through
Long as I got this light I'ma let it show
You can't trust everybody that cheer for you
They might be smearing you
Put my faith in the one who put fear in you
My life a miracle
Demon run up, we spray him like pest control (bdrrrrr)

Spin with my dawg never step alone
I got the key like I'm never home
Standin on business, slide with the quickness
Spin on yo block til I'm dead and gone
I talk to God through a megaphone
Hoo hoo
I was a gremlin, I was a villain
That's just the path I was headed on
