		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All the things that are in your mind, now fade
All the things that you felt inside
That was me
All these things that you thought billowed to your own life
Are drifting away again and I just might
Kill you, what if I must leave you behind
Follow, follow, wake up

I see only the pain inside living in fantasy
Drift away again
My fault
I should never have left you in charge of my life
Kill me, you kill yourself, wake up

All the pressure inside my mind, it builds up in time
I can't seem to focus when you are, follow me
All these things that you thought billowed to my own life
Are taken away again and I just might
Follow why you think he suffers for you
But I know you follow; I know I'll wake up

I see only the pain inside living in fantasy
Drift away again
My fault
I should never have left you in charge of my mind
Kill me, you kill yourself, wake up

Oh hey
People why can't you see everything that you kill
You take away from me
Take the blood from my vein
Always in vain
Only your pain
My fault
My fault (my fault)

Wake up!
I see only the pain inside living in fantasy
Drift away again
My fault
I should never have left you in charge of my life
Kill me, you kill yourself, wake up

I see no other way now
This still will you have me
Take it away again
My fault
I should never have left you in charge of your lives
Kill me, you kill yourself, wake up
