		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Great John on the beat, by the way)

When you down and you out, they ain't showin' up
Elevated gang, how we goin' up
Too fast, I ain't never think of slowin' up
Only time I lean on you when I'm pourin' up
I bet they ain't believe you, yeah
Bet they ain't wanna see you, yeah-yeah
I bet they treat you like you see-through, uh
Me and you was never equal

Turn that pain into fame, I ain't did that, uh
I bet they wonder where he live at
Hundred chops inside the crib, get your wig cracked
If that bitch get up on me, she get her ribs cracked
Took the gang to Miami
We kept them choppers around, might tell your boy to sit down
'Cause I know niggas can't stand me, uh
And I don't want you around, 'cause you ain't holdin' me down
You ain't a part of the family
Want smoke, then we steamin' like Stanley
I used to want the Porsche 'til I hopped in the AMG
Uh, I'm like, "Fuck it, I still might"
I got my gun, I ain't pussy, I still fight
But we can't go back
Seen a lot of pain, I done seen a lot of racks
All part of the game, I'm just tellin' you the facts
I'm a big dog, said she want me all up in her cat
How your gettin' cheese and you ain't never runnin' racks
Know they mad, got them ready to attack me
A-B-C, she want D in the backseat
She was on E, F'd up when she met G
I mean when she met me
It get lonely at the top, the bottom too crowded (mm-hmm)
Said they feelin' me, but I ain't feelin' nobody

When you down and you out, they ain't showin' up
Elevated gang, how we goin' up
Too fast, I ain't never think of slowin' up
Only time I lean on you when I'm pourin' up
I bet they ain't believe you, yeah
Bet they ain't wanna see you, yeah-yeah
I bet they treat you like you see-through, uh
Me and you was never equal

Me and you are not the same, no, no
You a pistol, I'm a Draco, huh
I could turn you to a John Doe
All these snakes, all I needed was a lawn mow
You ain't gotta act like you love (yeah-yeah)
Know I feel better with drugs (yeah-yeah)
Told my self I'd get better, I was
I told them I make it, it is what it was
And I stand on that shit like no seats in this club
It's hot, how we freezin' 'em up?
All this ice, I ain't keepin' it tucked
And I stay with my Glock, it's a must
Gotta watch 'em, you know I don't trust
I hopped in my whip, used to hop on the bus

When you down and you out, they ain't showin' up
Elevated gang, how we goin' up
Too fast, I ain't never think of slowin' up
Only time I lean on you when I'm pourin' up
I bet they ain't believe you, yeah
Bet they ain't wanna see you, yeah-yeah
I bet they treat you like you see-through, uh
Me and you was never equal
