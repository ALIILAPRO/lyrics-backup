		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up 
(Outby16, or dead on the scene, but together)
Fuck it-fuck it-fuck it up (for fucking ever)
Fuck it up, fuck it up
Fuck it-fuck it-fuck it up (ayy, ayy)
Oh my God (ayy, ayy)
Leave it off, it sounds like shit (ayy, ayy)
Shut the fuck up (ayy, ayy)
Jesus fuckin' Christ (ayy, ayy)
You're fuckin' up my day (ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy (ayy, ayy)

Fuckin' up my day, all these wack bitch niggas wanna test me (yeah)
Can't believe that I become the problem for these mini-mes (goddamn)
All you niggas babies, hope you find a bitch that breastfeed (yeah)
Thought they was gon' check me, them niggas got cold feet (ayy)
Fuck it (fuck it), fuck it (fuck it)
all my niggas fuck it up (ah, shit)
slidin' with the mafia (ayy) and we came to fuck it up (ayy, ayy, yeah)
They came tryna buck up and got they ass fucked up (fuck it)
Like a paint chip, we gon' get your ass touched up (drop)
I want all the money that you owe me, nothing lesser (less)
That bitch say she learned to lie from me, I'm a professor (professor)
Ten bitches on top of one another, double-decker (yeah)
Don't give (yeah) a fuck about your nigga, I'm a homewrecker, yeah

You don't ever see me 'cause I never go outside
Crazy bitch at the crib said she want her hands tied
It's asinine to try this team of mine
We'll blow your ass back to '09, back to back in time, yeah
Nigga, just know your place (yeah)
I got it all, the money, the cars, and clothes
Shit, I can never forget the hoes
Bitch, that shit can make you fold (yeah)
You say you wanna see me, better hope that you can keep me
I dick her down so well, that's why she'll never fuckin' leave me

Ayy, ayy, ayy (stupid bitch)

They say I'm that nigga (nigga)
they know nothing bigger (bigger)
Inside my cherry pick-up (yeah)
Life is getting tricky, but you bitches can't trick me (ayy)
You was actin' stupid, so it got you in a sticky (ayy, ayy)
Used to like 'em slim, but I want a bitch thicker (ayy)
That bitch pussy tight, it got my fuckin' dick gripped (gripped tight)
Extendo clip, forty deep, pullin' up, sticks tucked (pow, pow)
Don't pull up to my crib, zuzu leave your ass picked, ah
Talkin' 'bout my family get you lit up like a candle (candle)
You niggas started shit I know for sure that you can't handle (yeah)
You think we can't find you, but we drivin' 'round the city
'Til the sun up, sun up, sun up, sun up, sun up, yeah
Please don't underestimate me (okay), you can't recreate me (okay, yeah)
I've been fucked up since a kid and you can't save me (yeah)
You can tell me that you love me, but you can't date me (yeah)
Regardless, all the shit I've been through, this shit shape me, bitch
