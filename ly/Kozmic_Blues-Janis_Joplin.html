		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Time keeps moving on
Friends they turn away
I keep moving on
But I never found out why
I keep pushing too hard and babe
I keep trying to make it right
Through another lonely day, ooh-whoa

Dawn has come at last
Twenty-five years, honey, just one night, oh yeah
Well, I'm twenty-five years older now
So I know it can't be right
And I'm no better, babe, and I can't help you no more
Than I did when just a girl

Oh, but it don't make no difference babe, no, no
And I know that I could always try
It don't make no difference, babe, yeah
I better hold it now
I better need it, yeah
I better use it 'til the day I die, whoa

Don't expect any answers, dear
For I know that they don't come with age, no, no
I ain't never gonna love you any better, babe
And I'm never gonna love you right
So you better take it now, right now, oh

Well, it don't make no difference, babe
And I know that I can always try
Well, there's a fire inside of every one of us
You better need it now
I get to hold it, yeah
I better use it 'til the day I die

Don't make no difference, babe, no, no, no
And it never ever will, eh
I wanna talk about a little bit of loving, yeah
I get to hold it, baby
I'm gonna need it now
I better use it, say, ah

Don't make no difference, babe, yeah
Ah honey, I'd hate to be the one
I said you're gonna live your life
And you better love your life
Oh, babe, someday you're gonna have to cry
Yes, indeed, yes, indeed, yes, indeed
Oh, baby, yes, indeed

I said you, they're always gonna hurt you
I said they're always gonna let you down
I said everywhere, every day, every day
And every way, every way
Oh, honey, won't you hold on to what's gonna move
I said it's gonna disappear when you turn your back
I said you know it ain't gonna be there
When you wanna reach out and grab on

Whoa, babe
Whoa, babe
Whoa, babe
Oh, but keep truckin' on
Whoa, yeah
Whoa, yeah
Whoa, yeah
Whoa
Whoa
Whoa
Whoa
Whoa
