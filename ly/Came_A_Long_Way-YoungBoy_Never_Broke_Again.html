(Daytrip took it to ten, hey)

I done came a long way from up the road
Daddy up in jail, long ways up the road
I'm from the streets, my nigga, but my son won't be from there
Spent half my life inside the streets, I still don't even care
'Cause I stacked that money high
I gotta thank God that I made a way
I could've messed up my life
Spent hours late through the night
It could be worse, I'm thanking God I'm the one who was saved

I done did jail time in the Northside, ducking from that fire
I even rode the city bus with moms as a child
Remember times I sit there hotboxin', just me and them slimes
Now in my Maybach or that Rolls where we smoke all night
Now I be screamin', "I'm a real top shotta"
Jail, I slept with lifers, depend on how my life goes
Don't wanna see the pen' again
I am not a writer, they cannot take my title
It all come from my heart and dome
Had to run up all this money for my kids, I'm suicidal
All these dead men be speaking to me saying, "Go get some more"
I keep hearing a voice, I think it's Dave saying, "Keep my pole"
I keep hearing a voice, I think it's Dump, keep saying, "Don't trust these hoes"

I done came a long way from up the road (long way)
Daddy up in jail, long ways up the road (yeah)
I'm from the streets, my nigga, but my son won't be from there
Spent half my life inside the streets, I still don't even care (I don't)
'Cause I stacked that money high
I gotta thank God that I made a way
I could've messed up my life
Spent hours late through the night
It could be worse, I'm thanking God I'm the one who was saved

Used to go half on a blunt, just me and Tony
Used to be with Jordan and then some shit go wrong, he end up dumpin'
That's my twin with the twins, Trey know nothin' but get the money
Have a fight inside the hood, I lose or win, that shit ain't nothin'
All I know is go again, don't give a fuck 'cause I was thuggin'
Started clutchin', never slippin', I was tryna stretch me somethin'
Had a shootout right on side, I blew, my gun jammed, I start runnin'
Remember Tom was right, he showed me how to work the motherfucker
Say he been in this section years, he grew up with my mom and uncle
I watched my nigga trap off powder, less than all, he still ain't fumble
I know my X was laced with fentanyl, I grew wise and still ain't crumble
They'll tell you I'm the king of the jungle like Mutombo, my nigga

I done came a long ways from up the road
Daddy up in jail long ways down the road
I'm from the streets, my nigga, but my son won't be from there
Spent half my life inside the streets, I still don't even care
'Cause I stacked that money high
I gotta thank God that I made a way
I could've messed up my life
Spent hours late through the night
It could be worse, I'm thanking God I'm the one who was saved

(Daytrip took it to ten, hey)
From the streets, my nigga, but my son won't be from there
(Mario)
I still don't even care
