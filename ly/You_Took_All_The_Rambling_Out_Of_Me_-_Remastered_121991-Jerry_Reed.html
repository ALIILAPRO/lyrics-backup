		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You took all the ramblin' out of me, girl
With the finest lovin' I ever done seen
Now all I wanna do is sit home and play my little guitar
And sing songs about all the places that I've seen

Your country loving and your country cooking
Done blowed my mind and set me free
You took away all my urge to roam
All I wanna do is just hang around home
'Cause you took all the ramblin' out of me

How I wound up down here in Monroe
Is somethin' I'm never gonna figure out it's true
But your sweet love settled me down
Made me quit all my ramblin' around
Now all I wanna do is sit home and grow old with you

Last night I heard a freight train through my window
And I couldn't help thinkin' as I heard that whistle scream
How that old lonesome sound don't make me itch and want to move around
Because you took all the ramblin' out of me, yeah

You took all the ramblin' out of me, girl
With the finest lovin' I ever done seen
Now all I wanna do is sit home and play my little guitar
And sing songs about all the places that I've seen

Your country loving and your country cooking
Done blowed my mind and set me free
You took away all my urge to roam
All I wanna do is just hang around home
'Cause you took all the ramblin' out of me (one more time, sing it)

You took all the ramblin' out of me, girl
With the finest lovin' I ever done seen
Now all I wanna do is sit home and play my little guitar
