		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't wanna move when I'm in her hands
There's nothing I can do or say
Put everything on hold, cancel all of my plans
Everybody I'm away, hey
She may be bad but she feels so good
I'll give her anything she wants

She's trouble, I know it
She only needs to touch me
I'm in trouble, I know it, hee
She's trouble, I love it 
I know that when she's does it 
I'm in trouble, I know it, ooh

I never know what's running through her mind
No telling what she's gonna do
Her every move is like a danger sign 
Daring me to come on through, hey
She may be bad but she feels so good
I'll give her anything she want

She's trouble, I know it
She only needs to touch me
I'm in trouble, I know it, hee
Oh, she's trouble, I love it 
I know that when she's does it 
I'm in trouble, I know it

She's trouble
She knows what I like
I got a feeling I'm falling (you're in trouble)
Trouble
There's no hope inside
I'm in way over my head

She's trouble, I know it
She only needs to touch me
I'm in trouble, I know it, ooh
She's trouble, I love it 
I know that when she's does it 
I'm in trouble, I know it, ooh

She's trouble, I know it
only needs to
I know it

(So good, baby)

I love it (hee)
I know it (ooh)
I know it (ooh)
I know it
I love it (hee, so good, baby)
I know it
I know it (ooh)
I know it
I love it (hee)
I know it
I know it (hee)
I know it (talking 'bout baby)
I love it (ooh)
I know it (talking 'bout baby)
I know it
I know it (hee)
I love it 
I know it
I know it (ooh)
I know it
I love it (hee)
I know it
