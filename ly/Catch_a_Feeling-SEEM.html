		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's two of you and one of me
The three of us in the backseat
Wind in your hair and I can't see
Moonlight shining like a Marquee
Dollar drinks and we're taking them to go
Let's find a
Dance floor I don't wanna go home
Don't wanna
Swerving down Madison, empty streets
Green lights the whole way, meant to be

Not allowed to catch a feeling, but I feel it coming
Smokey room I'm barely breathing, now we're on to something
Not allow to catch a feeling
You can get it if you want to, if you really want to

If you want to runaway, we can ride into the sunset we can go away
Got expensive taste
If you're going my way you can go if you want to
if you really want to

Not allowed to catch a feeling, but I feel it coming
Smokey room I'm barely breathing, now we're on to something
Not allow to catch a feeling
You can get it if you want to, if you really want to

Not allowed to catch a feeling, but I feel it coming
Smokey room I'm barely breathing, now we're on to something
Not allow to catch a feeling
You can get it if you want to, if you really want to

If you want to runaway, we can ride into the sunset we can go away
Got expensive taste
If you're going my way you can go if you want to
if you really want to
