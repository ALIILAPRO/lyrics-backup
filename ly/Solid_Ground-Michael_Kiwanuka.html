		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How does it feel when it's quiet and calm?
And will I be denied?
How will it feel when it's time to move on?
Mother says kneel and pray
When it gets hard, I will roll those sleeves
Life can be so unkind
I will be found on the edge of the world
Where there'll be no one around

Oh, solid ground
Solid ground
Solid ground
Solid ground

How does it feel to be on your own?
No one to understand
I know I'm here and I don't belong
I'm on my knees today
When it gets dark, I will know no fear
Life can be so unkind
Hanging around on the edge of the world
Finally no one around

Oh, would you help me?
I don't understand
Is it over?
Am I losing solid ground?

Solid ground
Solid ground
Solid ground
Solid ground
Solid ground
Solid ground
Solid ground
Solid ground
