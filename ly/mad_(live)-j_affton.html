		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know you don't like me when I'm mad
Yeah I know you don't like me when I'm mad

I know the truth and all the facts
I know every day you tried to act in a way that you always thought would do the most right
And that casts my life in a whole new light
Fills me up with something that tastes a lot like spite
Even though I know it's not right
I can't tell you I love you, cause I'm still mad

And I know you don't like me when I'm mad
Yeah I know you don't like me when I'm mad

Dear Dad, I  know you love it when I sing
My singing doesn't mean a fucking thing
If you look at the word that I'm in
Say what's the problem
And it's that, you don't even try to recognise other thoughts I've got
You think the world has only got one plot cause you wrote it
And I note, there are things that you know that I don't
But I can see this apple's rolling, father, uphill from its tree

And I know you don't like me when I'm mad
Yeah I know you don't like me when I'm mad

Dear Mom, I know you hate it when I swear
And you know I don't really fucking care
Cause I'm too broke to ever live on my own
And I'm too worried about which one of my friends will be next to cut up their arm
I'm stuck livin' in your house, cause I'm up to my neck in debt
But you just bought a Corvette
Now you're makin' me mad

Yeah I know you don't like me when I'm mad
Yeah you're makin' me mad
Yeah I know you don't like me when I'm mad
