		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, well, well
Whoa, whoa

Hit and run
You were just out for fun
I thought I was the only one
Who turned you on
But I was wrong

Hit and run
Girl, you played your game so well
You really made it hard to tell
That all you were was
A one night stand

Yeah, yeah, yeah

The stage was set the day we met
I thought I had the leading part
But you lied to me and led me to believe
That no one else could steal your heart

But you said you would love me good
And I thought that you were here to stay
You held me tight, it felt so right
Then you up and ran away

Oh, hit and run
You were just having fun
Girl, I thought I was the only one
Who turned you on
But I was wrong

Hit and run
Girl, you played your game so well
You really made it hard to tell
That all you were was
A one night stand

Well, well, well
Woo, woo, woo, woo
Yeah

I bet you know I wanted you so
But love was never on your mind
No chance for me 'cause you had to leave
For a love of a different kind

Girl, you lied to me, led me to believe
You were gonna be here to stay
I never understood, never thought you would
Turn your back and run away

Oh, hit and run
Girl, you were just out for fun
I thought I was the only one
Who turned you on
But I was wrong

Hit and run
Girl, you played your game so well
Girl, you really made it hard to tell, oh yeah
That all you were was a one night stand

Hey, hey
Well
Woo, woo, woo

Hit and run, just for fun, ooh
Hit and run, just for fun on me
Hit and run, just for fun
