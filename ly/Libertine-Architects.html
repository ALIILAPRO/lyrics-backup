		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We are the rust worshipping the rain

Can I believe in anything?
I've got a doubters mind
But that don't give me the rope
It's not enough
So call the cavalry
The cavalry
God give me some hope
'Cause I've been living in a deficit
For so long

Don't turn the page 'cause your blood'll run cold
Parting the seas isn't free and it's getting old
You're gonna choke when you drink from the fountain
We are the rust worshipping the rain
I've got a Band-aid on a bullet wound
If I refuse to break through, I can never lose
There's a trap at the peak of the mountain
We are the rust worshipping the rain

I'm so afraid of everything
I think my courage died
This is a slippery slope
So lock the cuffs
Because I'm powerless
So powerless
I just can't cope
'Cause I've been living in a deficit

A libertine
Stole the keys
And drove this machine
Without me

Don't turn the page 'cause your blood'll run cold
Parting the seas isn't free and it's getting old
You're gonna choke when you drink from the fountain
We are the rust worshipping the rain
I've got a Band-aid on a bullet wound
If I refuse to break through, I can never lose
There's a trap at the peak of the mountain
We are the rust worshipping the rain

(Oh-oh-oh)
(oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
(oh-oh-oh)
(oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)

A libertine
Stole the keys
And drove this machine
Without me

It's too much, but it's not enough
So cold, but I'm burning up
I'm trying to swim
But I'm treading water

It's unclear, but it's obvious
Three cheers for this emptiness
I'm trying to swim
Yeah, I'm trying
I'm trying
I'm trying

I'm treading water (treading water)
'Cause I've been living in a deficit

Don't turn the page 'cause your blood'll run cold
Parting the seas isn't free and it's getting old
You're gonna choke when you drink from the fountain
We are the rust worshipping the rain

We are the rust worshipping the rain
