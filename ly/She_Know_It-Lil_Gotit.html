		  (2GlocckTopp)
Yeah, just like, bein' playa, like
You gotta be playa all situations
(In this situation, that's pushin' P)
Can't be half steppin', half layin'
(No kizzy) gotta be playa all situations

Yeah, I'm playa, she know it (Top chef)
Bitch in the hills, she gone off that boy
(Babygirl)
I treat the stick in my hand like a wand
(Brr) poof, if I get to sparkin', he gone
Whenever she meetin' up with player, yeah
She goin' holdin' up my Rollie Skydweller
Match the sun
Beat down the block with some Air Force 1's
(Air Force 1's)

I ain't rockin' Cartier, Gotit got on CD's
(Gotit) beat it from the back
She throw it back like a frisbee (Ha, sure)
Nigga had dropped out, yeah, I be Wock'd out
(Wock'd out) bitch so bad, yeah
She suckin' out the lean-ni (Hoodbaby)
Burn and then diss ya, send ya ass ten feet
Awful lot of slimes and print
Them on my Dickie's (Shout out Jessie
You know what I'm sayin')
Hop out broad day, hit a 360
Hoppin' out of beyblades
Spinnin' 'til you dizzy
Spinnin' like an arson and
Walkin' out the booth (Hot)
Yeah, I'm drippin' on some off shit
Walkin' in the room
Get to poppin' on a broke bitch
Neck typhoon
On some all we on go shit, niggas on shrooms
(On slime) black, bought a box of chocolates
'cause I'm not a wrestler
So many bitches despite I'm a bachelor
38 special, one shot, that's a caliber
(Grrah)
Givin' APD, hell Demons and Challengers
(Ah ah) lit nigga, hot coupe, lit nigga hot
Fuckin' with my spirit's
I'ma put 'em in a pot
London rocking shows, damn
My pocket got a knot
Fuckin' on the baddest, yeah
I'm pickin' out the ripe (yeah)
Ten service, fire my mink's on the line
Yeah, you want a purse
Bitch talkin' like I'm blind
You ain't set Franklins, mane, never been by
Shooter in Vegas accept payments, no lie

Yeah, I'm playa, she know it (Playa)
Bitch in the hills, she gone off that boy
I treat the stick in my hand like a wand
(Touch it, slime)
Poof, if I get to sparkin', he gone
Whenever she meetin' up with player, yeah
She goin' holdin' up my Rollie Skydweller
Match the sun
Beat down the block with some Air Force 1's

Get off a pack at the spot, let 'em go at it
Forgiattos, Moscatos
That's just what I'm on (Swervin' off)
That money the model, gon' fuck with a dime
(Money the model)
Thugger Thugger livin' So Much Fun (Slime)
What you want for that P, it's a problem
'Cause you know ain't none
Free in this life, bro (I'm a playa)
Turn the channel, I ain't never been light
(Uh, uh)
I'm a player, I'm a freak, yeah, 'ight
Bein' 'bout your business, babygirl
Keep your head on break the bank
Stripper shake it down 'til your bread gone
Block got hot, had to switch it
Took the bag on 'em
Stick in the bookbag, shawty got a leg on her
Yeah, shawty got a leg on her
Fasho, that's a leg on her
For the right price, I'll put my mans on her
(Fire) break me off then go and
Put them bands on you (My slime)
Don't tolerate disrespect
We put them hands on him (No bap)
Bullseye, yeah
Them bullets gonna land on him (Ten feet)
How the fuck you gon' fuck up a check when
You constantly out here just
Worryin' 'bout the net? (Huh?)
Life a gamble, I'm placin' the bet
(Can't be bet)
Real shit, you gotta hold down and say it
(Whatever you do, just keep it P)

Yeah, I'm playa, she know it
Bitch in the hills, she gone off that boy
I treat the stick in my hand like a wand
Poof, if I get to sparkin', he gone
Whenever she meetin' up with player, yeah
She goin' holdin' up my Rollie Skydweller
Match the sun
Beat down the block with some Air Force 1's
