		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Shout out my nigga Synco)
Uh (Tuned up)

Copped a BMW, new deposit, I picked up another bag
Like, "Fuck it, I'ma count while I'm in it"
I hear planes flyin', crowds screamin', money counters, chains clangin'
Shit, I guess that's how it sound when you winnin'
I ain't jokin', do it sound like I'm kiddin'?
I've been makin' like two thousand a minute
So high up through the clouds, I was swimmin'
I'm probably gon' drown when I'm in it
I bet she gon' get loud when I'm in it
And we might have a child when I'm finished

Uh, I won't love a ho, after we fuck she can't get near me
Only bitch I give a conversation to is Siri
My pants Amiri, yes, I'm winnin', clearly
I'm the chosen one, seen my potential so they fear me
Lately, I've been prayin', God, I wonder, can you hear me?
Thinkin' 'bout the old me, I swear I miss you dearly
Stay down 'til you come up, I've been stickin' to that theory
Every day a battle, I'm exhausted and I'm weary
Make sure I smile in public, when alone, my eyes teary
I fought through it all, but that shit hurt me severely
I've been gettin' high to hide behind my insecurities
Takin' different pills but I know it ain't gon'

Uh, copped a BMW, new deposit, I picked up another bag
Like, "Fuck it, I'ma count while I'm in it"
I hear planes flyin', crowds screamin', money counters, chains clangin'
Shit, I guess that's how it sound when you winnin'
I ain't jokin', do it sound like I'm kiddin'?
I've been makin' like two thousand a minute
So high up through the clouds, I was swimmin'
I'm probably gon' drown when I'm in it
I bet she gon' get loud when I'm in it (uh, uh)
And we might have a child when I'm finished

They say I'm Pac rebirth, never put out a weak verse
Homicides when we lurk, I'ma step 'til my feet hurt
Been puttin' them streets first
White tees turned burgundy T-shirts
Lookin' for somethin' real, he stuck in a deep search
Anxiety killin' me, I just wanna leave Earth
When they ask if I'm okay, it just make everything seem worse
Tryna explain your feelings sound like something you rehearsed
Stabbed me in my back with a clean smirk
Lookin' so deep into your eyes, I can read your thoughts, so
Shut the fuck, I mean, please don't talk
I done been through too much and I don't need another loss
Put that on every war scar, for every battle I fought

Uh, copped a BMW, new deposit, I picked up another bag
Like, "Fuck it, I'ma count while I'm in it"
I hear planes flyin', crowds screamin', money counters, chains clangin'
Shit, I guess that's how it sound when you winnin'
I ain't jokin', do it sound like I'm kiddin'?
I've been makin' like two thousand a minute
So high up through the clouds, I was swimmin'
I'm probably gon' drown when I'm in it
I bet she gon' get loud when I'm in it
And we might have a child when I'm finished

When I'm finished
When I'm finished
