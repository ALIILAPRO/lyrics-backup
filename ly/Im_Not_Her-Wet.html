		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm not her
You must be mistaken
Oh, I'm not her
I guess my place was taken
Long before
Before I was ever faced with
This lonely man
I call my baby

Did you leave you in the kitchen
Just standing at the door
Was there something that was missing?
You know I always wanted more
Back outside, I'm in ribbons
Was I always such a bore?
Oh, I wish I could convince myself
That I was more than just here to help
You get over someone else
But that was never me

I'm not her
You must be mistaken
Oh, I'm not her
I guess my place was taken
Long before
Before I was ever faced with
This lonely man
I call my baby

This lonely man
I call my baby
