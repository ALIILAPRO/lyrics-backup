		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Little mama get up on me
Let me see you drop it rotate on this dick
And grip these nuts just
Like a fucking socket pocket locket
If you talking then I'm gon get to hoping
Twist it, pull her hair
I hit it hard just like we're playing bop it
Lost in a maze blind from the haze
Bitch I shoot clean he dead Billy Mays
Fuck what you say head out the rave
Hot like summer this heat shoot rays
Fuck you they don't even know your friends
Cause they disgusting she like it dirty
She like it rough just like it's rugby
Your boy a rookie
He look like a bitch and he tubby
Deep inside that bitch until she
Screaming that she cumming
Hold up bitch wait
Shake it like a shake weight
Bend that thing over
Let me slide up in your home base
Old girl hell no baby arch your backbone
She give tail fast like
A motherfucking tadpole

Shut the fuck up pick your boy up aye
Shut the fuck up pick your boy up aye
Shut the fuck up pick your boy up aye
He a lame bitch you a dumb cunt aye
Shut the fuck up pick your boy up aye
Shut the fuck up pick your boy up aye
Shut the fuck up pick your boy up aye
He a lame bitch you a dumb cunt aye

Shut the fuck up pick your boy up aye
Shut the fuck up pick your boy up aye
Shut the fuck up pick your boy up aye
He a lame bitch you a dumb cunt aye
Shut the fuck up pick your boy up aye
Shut the fuck up pick your boy up aye
Shut the fuck up pick your boy up aye
He a lame bitch you a dumb cunt aye
