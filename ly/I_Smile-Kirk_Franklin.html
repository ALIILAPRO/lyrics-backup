		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I dedicate this song to recession
Depression and unemployment
This song's for you

Today's a new day, but there is no sunshine
Nothing but clouds, and it's dark in my heart
And it feels like a cold night
Today's a new day, where are my blue skies
Where is the love and the joy that you promised me
Tell me it's alright

(I'll be honest with you)
I almost gave up, but a power that I can't explain
Fell from heaven like a shower

(When I think how much better I'm gonna be when this is over)
I smile, even though I hurt see I smile
I know God is working so I smile
Even though I've been here for a while
I smile, smile
It's so hard to look up when you been down
Sure would hate to see you give up now
You look so much better when you smile, so smile

Today's a new day, but there is no sunshine
Nothing but clouds and it's dark in my heart
And it feels like a cold night
Today's a new day, tell me where are my blue skies
Where is the love and the joy that you promised me
Tell me it's alright

(The truth is)
I almost gave up, but a power that I can't explain
Fell from heaven like a shower now

I smile, even though I hurt see I smile
I know God is working so I smile
Even though I've been here for a while
I smile, smile
It's so hard to look up when you been down
Sure would hate to see you give up now
You look so much better when you smile

Smile for me
Can you just smile for me
Smile for me
Can you just smile for me

Oh oh oh you look so much better when you
Oh oh oh you look so much better when you
Oh oh oh you look so much better when you
Oh oh oh you look so much better when you
Oh oh oh you look so much better when you

(And while you're waiting)
Oh oh oh you look so much better when you
(And while you're praying)
Oh oh oh you look so much better when you
(Look in the mirror)
Oh oh oh you look so much better when you
(Always remember)
You look so much better when you smile, come on

I almost gave up, but a power that I can't explain
Fell from heaven like a shower now

I smile, even though I hurt see I smile
I know God is working so I smile
Even though I've been here for a while
I smile, smile
It's so hard to look up when you been down
Sure would hate to see you give up now
You look so much better when you smile, so smile

Oh oh oh you look so much better when you
Oh oh oh you look so much better when you
Oh oh oh you look so much better when you
Oh oh oh you look so much better when you
Oh oh oh you look so much better when you
Oh oh oh you look so much better when you
Oh oh oh you look so much better when you
Oh oh oh you look so much better when you

Smile

See I just want don't you to be happy
'Cause then you have to have something you haven't been
I want you to have joy 'cause can't nobody
Take that away from you
I see you smile
