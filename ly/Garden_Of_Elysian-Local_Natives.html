		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In the time before we needed forgiveness
You said, "Meet me after school at the top of Elysian"
Sharing headphones and a plastic bottle of vodka
In the distance, the crowd goin' wild in the stadium

Orchestra playing under the bandshell
Swaying together like cathedral bells
They ring and ring and ring and ring and ring
And I could only hear you singing

'Cause she said, "When do you think we'll stop feeling like children?
'Cause the last time I asked my mom she said she still did"
As we pass, the cell towers disguise like palm trees
She laid out across my lap and we kept driving

Orchestra playing under the bandshell
Swaying together like cathedral bells
They ring and ring and ring and ring and ring
And I could only hear you singing

Mary in Harlem sitting quiet
Imagine if we had stayed
Tourniquet stems are blushing tide
Love isn't worship, love is change

Orchestra playing under the bandshell
Swaying together like cathedral bells
They ring and ring and ring and ring and ring
And I could only hear you singing
Orchestra playing under the bandshell
Swaying together like cathedral bells
They ring and ring and ring and ring and ring
And I could only hear you singing
