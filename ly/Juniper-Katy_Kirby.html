		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You don't need a gardener to know
Which way it is the blossom's going to float and
You don't need anyone else to tell you
What's gonna grow, you're on your own
You're on your own, you're on your own

True blue, Juniper
Never got around to asking her
The difference between weeds and herbs and flowers

You don't need a reprimand to know
Just when a vengeful God will strike her blow, there's a
Bad weather warning on the radio
Get in before they lock their doors
You're on your own, you're on your own

True blue, Juniper
She's a stormfront with a vicious curve
The difference between lightning, rain, and thunder
And thunder

You don't need to wait around and see
Whichever promises she's gonna keep, oh
Even distilled it's still an evergreen, oh
It never leaves, it never leaves
It never leaves, it never leaves, oh

True blue, Juniper
Never got around to asking her
The difference between weeds and herbs and flowers
