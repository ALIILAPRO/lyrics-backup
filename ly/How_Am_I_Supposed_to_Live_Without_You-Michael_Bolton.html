		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I could hardly believe it
When I heard the news today
I had to come and get it straight from you
They said you were leavin'
Someone's swept your heart away
From that look upon your face, I see it's true

So tell me all about it
Tell me 'bout the plans you're makin'
Oh, tell me one thing more before I go

Tell me how am I supposed to live without you?
Now that I've been lovin' you so long
How am I supposed to live without you?
And how am I supposed to carry on?
When all that I've been livin' for is gone

Too proud for cryin'
Didn't come here to break down
It's just a dream of mine is coming to an end
And how can I blame you
When I built my world around
The hope that one day
We'd be so much more than friends
I don't wanna know the price I'm gonna pay for dreaming
Oh, even now it's more than I can take

Tell me how am I supposed to live without you?
Now that I've been lovin' you so long
How am I supposed to live without you?
And how am I supposed to carry on?
When all that I've been livin' for is gone

Now I don't wanna know the price I'm gonna pay for dreaming
Oh, now that your dream has come true

Tell me how am I supposed to live without you?
Now that I've been lovin' you so long
How am I supposed to live without you?
And how am I supposed to carry on?
When all that I've been livin' for is gone
