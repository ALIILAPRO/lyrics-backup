		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I could spend a lifetime, stare at those eyes
You set it off, fire burning inside
If you really love me, then baby, don't lie
If you really love me, then baby, let's ride
I could spend a lifetime, stare at those eyes
You set it off, fire burning inside
If you really love me, then baby, don't lie
If you really love me, then baby, let's ride (Let's ride)
If you really love me, just say you know the vibe
I'll see you around in five 'cause you know I'll make the time for you (Yeah)
You know I'll make the time
I'll lay here by your side 'cause you know I'm only down for you
Oh we could do some things or we could take it slow
Just let me hit the brakes so I can let 'em go (Oh)
Want you to let me know, woah, yeah
Pour another drink and let the liquor flow (Let it flow)
Pulling all the drapes so we can set it low (We can set it low)
Like ain't nobody home (Like ain't nobody home)
I could spend a lifetime, stare at those eyes
You set it off, fire burning inside
If you really love me, then baby, don't lie
If you really love me, then baby, let's ride
I could spend a lifetime, stare at those eyes (Ooh, oh yeah)
You set it off, fire burning inside (Oh)
If you really love me, then baby, don't lie
If you really love me, then baby, let's ride (Let's ride)
I could tell you all the little things (The little things)
That you do to help me ease the pain (The pain, yeah)
But if you think it's time to raise the stakes (To raise the stakes, yeah)
Well, baby, that can be arranged (Ooh yeah)
Oh we could do some things or we could take it slow
I'll let you set the pace so I can let it go (Oh)
Want you to let me know, woah, yeah
Pour another drink and let the liquor flow (Let it flow)
Pulling all the drapes so we can set it low (We can set it low)
Like ain't nobody home (Like ain't nobody home)
I could spend a lifetime, stare at those eyes (Ooh, oh yeah)
You set it off, fire burning inside (Inside, yeah)
If you really love me, then baby, don't lie (Hey, yeah)
If you really love me, then baby, let's ride
I could spend a lifetime, stare at those eyes (Ooh, oh)
You set it off, fire burning inside (Hey, yeah)
If you really love me, then baby, don't lie
If you really love me, then baby, let's ride (Let's ride)
Ooh ooh, I could spend a lifetime, yeah
Oh yeah, I could spend a lifetime, yeah
Ooh, ooh (I could spend a lifetime)
