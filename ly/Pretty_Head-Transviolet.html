		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My pretty head i think I'm dead
Everyone's dumb and I'm no better
Ridiciously obscene keeping the peace
You could be like me but I'm no better

Dress my soul up like a girl
'Cause after all I'm just a girl
And I'm so happy
'Cause aren't all the pretty girls happy?

Right, right, right right, right, right
Right, right don't they say
I'm so happy
'Cause aren't all the pretty girls happy?

My pretty head what did you expect
Of the weaker sex i should know better
You tell me I'm hot that's what I want
I've already lost i should know better

Dress my soul up like a girl
'Cause after all I'm just a girl
And I'm so happy
'Cause aren't all the pretty girls happy?

Right, right, right right, right, right
Right, right oh, don't they say
I'm so happy
'Cause aren't all the pretty girls happy?

Don't they all love a show
Don't you dare forget it
Don't they all love a show
Don't you dare forget it
Don't they all love a show
Don't you dare forget it
Don't they all love a show
Don't you dare forget it
Don't they all love a show
Don't you dare forget it

I'm so happy, I'm so happy
'Cause aren't all the pretty girls happy?
