		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I met her when I was still with my ex, but
Her lipstick was blood red, she wore her hair messed up
She was my best friend when I had a boyfriend
But she was on my mind when I was in his bed

So we kept in touch 'cause I wanted to touch her
I got kinda drunk and told her that I liked her
She said, "You're the best" 
This girl has got me all messed up
Up, up
'Cause

When she bites her lip, looks at me like that
I wanna be more than a friend, more than a friend
Does she feel the same? Does she want me back?
I wanna be more than a friend, more than a friend
I have you close but I want more
I want your t-shirt on the floor
When you bite your lip, look at me like that
I wanna be more than a friend, more than a friend
(More than a friend)

So fucking confusing the way that she texts me
Keeps saying, "I love you" 
Wish she really meant it (hey, I love you)
Sometimes she comes over, we call it a girl's night
When she takes her clothes off, I know that she's my type (oh my god)

So we kept in touch 'cause I wanted to touch her
I got kinda drunk and told her that I liked her
She said, "You're the best" 
This girl has got me all messed up
(All messed up in my mind)
Up, up
'Cause

When she bites her lip, looks at me like that
I wanna be more than a friend, more than a friend
Does she feel the same? Does she want me back?
I wanna be more than a friend, more than a friend
I have you close but I want more
I want your t-shirt on the floor
When you bite your lip, look at me like that
I wanna be more than a friend, more than a friend

My hands 'round her body
Her perfume left on me
On top of the dresser
I wanna undress her
My hands 'round her body
Her perfume left on me
This girl's got me all messed up

When she bites her lip, looks at me like that
I wanna be more than a friend, more than a friend
Does she feel the same? Does she want me back?
I wanna be more than a friend, more than a friend
I have you close but I want more
I want your t-shirt on my floor
When you bite your lip, look at me like that
I wanna be more than a friend, more than a friend
