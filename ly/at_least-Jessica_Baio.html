		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sometimes I lose my composure
My thoughts are bipolar
Push you out, then pull you close
Inside are bottled up feelings
Silently screaming
But when I lose control

You hold me in your arms and say
That everything will be ok
And when I’m left with nothing, babe
I know I still have everything
And they all say the spark will fade
But you still take my breath away

When I’m hanging by a thread
Drawing my last breath
At least I’ll share the air with you (at least I’ll share the air with you)
When the world’s falling apart
And we’re left in the dark
At least I’m holding onto you (at least I’m holding onto you)
At least I’m holding onto you

When you showed up for no reason
And said you’re never leaving
Put your heart in a box
You said I could keep it
You’re more steady than my shadow
You follow me and no matter how deep I go

You take me by the hand and say
That we will always find a way
And even if the sun burned out
We’d build a shelter underground
And they all say the spark will fade
But you still take my breath away

When I’m hanging by a thread
Drawing my last breath
At least I’ll share the air with you (at least I’ll share the air with you)
When the world’s falling apart
And we’re left in the dark
At least I’m holding onto you (at least I’m holding onto you)
At least I’m holding onto you
(at least I’m holding on)
(at least I’m holding on)
(at least I’m holding on)
At least I’m holding onto you (at least I’m holding on)
(at least I’m holding on)
(at least I’m holding on)
(at least I’m holding on)
At least I’m holding onto you (at least I’m holding on)
At least I’m holding onto you
