		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Our love story could be kind of gory, far from boring
We'd meet at a post-apocalypse
Yeah, I'd be slowly walking in a group stalking you
You'd be the only man alive that I could not resist
I tread through all this rubble and dirt
Wondering if I'm the last man on earth
Even though the whole fucking world is cursed
I've been thinking of you and ways we might work
Tryna find a cure, I've been doing research
On how these effects might get reversed
Now maybe that is wishful thinking
But I swear my spider-sense is tingling
She's a freak and she's so bloodthirsty
All I can say is Lord have mercy...
If you were a zombie there'd be no lovebites
Cus in 10 minutes I know what I'd look like
Yeah, it's the god damn apocalypse
Every city is a fallen metropolis
Unfortunately, there's no rocket ships
It's inevitable, there's no stopping this
If I were a zombie, I'd never eat your brain
I'd just want your heart, yeah, I'd want your heart
I'd just want your heart, yeah
Oh, if I were a zombie, I'd never eat your brain
I'd just want your heart, yeah, I'd want your heart
I'd just want your heart, 'cause I want you
If I were a zombie I'd never eat your brain
Even though I know how good you'd taste
I would get addicted just like cocaine
I would drain every drop of blood from your veins
So fuck that, I can't be getting infected
I'm covered in guts so I won't be detected
Looking for a cure so that we can inject it
And one day, finally be reconnected!
Until then I'm just trying to survive
Taking off heads with an old samurai
Dismemberment from the left to right
I'm making blood rain down from the sky
Surrounded by red mist and rotten flesh
I double tap every time I stop and check
It's necessary to be cautious
Protecting my heart from the darkest forces!
If I were a zombie, I'd never eat your brain
I'd just want your heart, yeah, I'd want your heart
I'd just want your heart, yeah
Oh, if I were a zombie, I'd never eat your brain
I'd just want your heart, yeah, I'd want your heart
I'd just want your heart, 'cause I want you
You'd be hiding in a second floor apartment
Knocking all the stairs down
To save your life from the undead
Double barrel shotgun taking out the slow ones
Then you'd see the passion burning in my eye
And I'd keep my head...
If I were a zombie, I'd never eat your brain
I'd just want your heart, yeah, I'd want your heart
I'd just want your heart, yeah
Oh, if I were a zombie, I'd never eat your brain
I'd just want your heart, yeah, I'd want your heart
I'd just want your heart, 'cause I want you
