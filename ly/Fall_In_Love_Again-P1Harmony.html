		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take a chance, baby, let's take a chance
Yeah, I know he did you wrong but we're not all bad
Don't hold back, baby, don't hold back
And I promise you can fall in love again

I know you I can give you everything you asked for, whoa
But I get the feeling you think I'm gassed up, whoa
That's because everybody else lets you down
But I'm not everyone else
I can tell that you don't trust me 'cause they messed up, whoa
But can't you tell I don't move the way the rest does, whoa?
I might be young but I'm just sayin' I can hold you down, yeah
You don't need anyone else

'Cause good guys are a blessing
If it feels right, then just let it
Look in my eyes, I can tell you see
You should be ridin' with me

Take a chance, baby, let's take a chance
Yeah, I know he did you wrong but we're not all bad
Don't hold back, baby, don't hold back
And I promise you can fall in love again
Take a chance, baby, let's take a chance
Yeah, I know he did you wrong but we're not all bad
Don't hold back, baby, don't hold back
And I promise you can fall in love again

Yeah 까칠한 너의 말투
괜히 한번 헛기침
말해 줘 너의 마음도
Baby, time is tickin' (tickin')
넘어와 줘 그냥 빨리 (빨리)
먹으러 가자 Italian
너도 날 원한다면
Take a chance 만약에 말이야
And I won't ever change, when I'm old and I'm grey
I promise to hold you the same way
Keepin' you close the way I do today
That's all that I'm gonna do

'Cause good guys are a blessing
If it feels right, then just let it
Look in my eyes, I can tell you see
You should be ridin' with me

Take a chance, baby, let's take a chance
Yeah, I know he did you wrong but we're not all bad
Don't hold back, baby, don't hold back
And I promise you can fall in love again
Take a chance, baby, let's take a chance
Yeah, I know he did you wrong but we're not all bad
Don't hold back, baby, don't hold back
And I promise you can fall in love again

사랑이 빠진 채로 너에게 사랑에 빠진
너는 모르게 더 깊게 심해 마음을 닫아 굳게
Alright 넌 참 널 너무 잘 몰라 걷자
여차하면 날 좋을 때 조만간 나와 걷자
Let's kick it, pick up the phone, bae
저 뜨거운 태양 아래로 달려
바람을 갈라 시원한 바람이 불어
휘, 휘, 휘, 휘
다 가진 네가 뭐가 아쉬워 다 (다, 다, 다)
다 잊고 나와 we can dance all night
You should be ridin' with me

Take a chance, baby, let's take a chance
Yeah, I know he did you wrong but we're not all bad (not all bad)
Don't hold back, baby, don't hold back
And I promise you can fall in love again (you can fall in love again)
Take a chance, baby, let's take a chance
Yeah, I know he did you wrong but we're not all bad
Don't hold back, baby, don't hold back
And I promise you can fall in love again
