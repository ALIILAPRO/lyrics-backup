		  (We'll be singing, when we're winning, we'll be singing)

I get knocked down, but I get up again
You are never gonna keep me down
I get knocked down, but I get up again
You are never gonna keep me down
I get knocked down, but I get up again
You are never gonna keep me down
I get knocked down, but I get up again
You are never gonna keep me down

(Pissing the night away, pissing the night away)
He drinks a Whiskey drink, he drinks a Vodka drink
He drinks a Lager drink, he drinks a Cider drink
He sings the songs that remind him of the good times
He sings the songs that remind him of the better times
(Oh Danny Boy, Danny Boy, Danny Boy)

I get knocked down, but I get up again
You are never gonna keep me down
I get knocked down, but I get up again
You are never gonna keep me down
I get knocked down, but I get up again
You are never gonna keep me down
I get knocked down, but I get up again
You are never gonna keep me down

(Pissing the night away, pissing the night away)
He drinks a Whiskey drink, he drinks a Vodka drink
He drinks a Lager drink, he drinks a Cider drink
He sings the songs that remind him of the good times
He sings the songs that remind him of the better times
(Don't cry for me, next door neighbor)

I get knocked down, but I get up again
You are never gonna keep me down
I get knocked down, but I get up again
You are never gonna keep me down
I get knocked down, but I get up again
You are never gonna keep me down
I get knocked down, but I get up again
You are never gonna keep me down

I get knocked down (we'll be singing)
But I get up again
You are never gonna keep me down (when we're winning)

I get knocked down (we'll be singing)
But I get up again
You are never gonna keep me down (ooh)

I get knocked down (we'll be singing)
But I get up again
You are never gonna keep me down (when we're winning)

I get knocked down (we'll be singing)
But I get up again
You are never gonna keep me down (ooh)

I get knocked down (we'll be singing)
But I get up again (pissing the night away)
You are never gonna keep me down (when we're winning)

I get knocked down (we'll be singing)
But I get up again (pissing the night away)
You are never gonna keep me down (ooh)

I get knocked down (we'll be singing)
But I get up again (pissing the night away)
You are never gonna keep me down (when we're winning)

I get knocked down (we'll be singing)
But I get up again (pissing the night away)
You are never gonna keep me down (ooh)

I get knocked down (we'll be singing)
But I get up again (pissing the night away)
You are never gonna keep me down (when we're winning)
