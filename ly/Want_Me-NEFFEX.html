		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let's go, yeah

No class but all sass
Grew fast with no dad
She a tall glass better fall back
I want all that i want all that
Heart attack give my heart back
Dark eyes,  and a dark past
White lies and a heavy cast
Pain inside like tar it's black uh
Silent tragedies
At night when she's sleeping
Can't control her little mind
In the evening so she passes all her time
By just pleasing
Others who aren’t worth her time
Till she’s dreaming

I want you to want me
Pupils dilate as you move in closely
Whispered to me softly
Tell me everything is gonna be fine save me
And you don't even know me
Hidden deep inside is a monster baby
So tell me that you want me
I only feel alive when my heart beats racing

Got red eyes we fixate
Blood shot can't escape
These thoughts it’s mind rape
And my fate is your taste
Obsessed with foreplay undress my poor brain
I just want more pain
Give me drugs ignore fame
The skin is soft but shes rough on the inside
I cannot stop and she's got nowhere to hide
I’m getting lost in my thoughts
And in her mind sometimes I think that I’m a
Fraud stealing her time

I want you to want me
Pupils dilate as you move in closely
Whispered to me softly
Tell me everything is gonna be fine save me
And you don't even know me
Hidden deep inside is a monster baby
So tell me that you want me
I only feel alive when my heart beats racing
