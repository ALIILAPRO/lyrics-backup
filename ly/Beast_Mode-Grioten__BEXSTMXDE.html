		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bitch you just make me fucking laugh
I empty up a clip when you're telling to pass
Why you talking shit when your bitch is on my lap
I don't got time for these tricks, I'm off the map

Yeah, I've been on beast mode, and I don't give a fuck
I got a bitch so bad, can't keep it tuck
Motherfuckers wanna hate, but don't want to front
I be talking all my shit while you be looking me up
My bad, I ain't even want to flex like that
Telling me to relax, bitch you're making me laugh
I got no time for your shit, I empty up a clip
Until your fucking brain go splat

Yeah, give me one more chance, I'll fight, I don't need no knife
Ima fine dine on your face, bitch hit me back
I'ma shoot you with a motherfucking tac
Like, I don't give a fuck about a pack
I'm the king of the strap like damn
I don't got time for a bitch, damn
I don't wanna be your bitch, damn
I just wanna do my shit sike
I just found a big tit bitch like
Left, right, up, down, my feelings for you go round and round
When you send me a text got looking like a clown
I'm in love with your step when you turn around
I've been looking at your Insta every fucking day
Don't tell me that I'm weird bitch go away
Why you shouting to me girl? There's a time and a place
I don't wanna take a test, I just came here to play
Yeah, I've been on beast mode, and I don't give a fuck
I got a bitch so bad, can't keep it tuck
Motherfuckers wanna hate, but don't want to front
I be talking all my shit while you be looking me up
My bad, I ain't even want to flex like that
Telling me to relax, bitch you're making me laugh
I got no time for your shit, I empty up a clip
Until your fucking brain go splat

Bitch you just make me fucking laugh
I empty up a clip when you're telling to pass
Why you talking shit when your bitch is on my lap?
I don't got time for these tricks, I'm off the map
