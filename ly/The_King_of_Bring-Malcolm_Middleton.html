		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm halfway between useless and potential.
I'm all the way travelled from hope.
There's no one leading me down this road.
All the wrong turns have been my own.

Did you know that I'm telepathetic?
When I walk in the room, I know.
All eyes turn towards me, everyone wants me to go.

I'm only happy when I'm sad and my good times are all bad.
And my best years have all left me along with you.
When I'm up, I'm still down, and my smile is my frown.
I'm a clown, I'm still falling away from you.

My hallway is fraught with dangers,
It's peopled by memories and ghosts.
An apparition sits on my laundry,
Laughing and eating my toast.

I don't lock the door at night anymore,
I've no one to keep safe.
Pancakes gone, kissing gone, along with the smile on my face.

I'm only happy when I'm sad and my good times are all bad.
And my best years have all left me along with you.
When I'm up, I'm still down, and my smile is my frown.
I'm a clown, I'm still falling away from you.

I regret all my regrets.
I forget I forget.
I forget all my regrets.
I regret all I forget.

I'm just like a bad actor falling,
Falling in love with you.
You know I'd do anything for you,
What do you want me to do?

I've burnt all my bridges and I'm stranded,
I'm joking on my own.
I'm wider than the Atlantic, the distance between us grows.

I'm only happy when I'm sad and my good times are all bad.
And my best years have all left me along with you.
When I'm up, I'm still down, and my smile is my frown.
I'm a clown, I'm still falling away from you.
