		  Take the heat off me
Please take the heat off me
Yes, I'm burning
If you'd really lie and cheat
I don't want to meet your kind of terms no more

So take the heat off me
Please take the heat off me
Yes, I'm burning
Don't believe you're trying to make it
And I just can't keep on taking it no more

Don't mean to say you double-crossed me
But somehow I think that you've lost me
Maybe you weren't even trying to see
Where I was or where I should be
And if you're just faking
We'd better start breaking away tonight
So take this fire from my heart tonight

So take the heat off me
Please take the heat off me
Yes, I'm burning
Don't believe you're trying to make it
And I just can't keep on taking it no more

Take the heat off me
Please take the heat off me
Yes, I'm burning
If you'd really lie and cheat
I don't want to meet your kind of terms no more

Don't mean to say you double-crossed me
But somehow I think that you've lost me
Maybe you weren't even trying to see
Where I was or where I should be
And if you're just faking
We'd better start breaking away tonight
So take this fire from my heart tonight

So take the heat off me
Please take the heat off me
Take the heat off me
Please take the heat off me
Take the heat off me
Yes, I'm burning
If you'd really lie and cheat
I don't want to meet your kind of terms no more

So take the heat off me
Please take the heat off me
Take the heat off me
Please take the heat off me
Take the heat off me
Yes, I'm burning
If you really lie and cheat
I don't want to meet your kind of terms no more

So take the heat off me
Please take the heat off me
Take the heat off me
Please take the heat off me
Take the heat off me
Yes, I'm burning
If you'd really lie and cheat
I don't want to meet your kind of terms no more

So take the heat off me
Please take the heat off me
Take the heat off me
Please take the heat off me
Take the heat off me
Yes, I'm burning
If you'd really lie and cheat
I don't want to meet your kind of terms no more
