		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wading in your waters
Lust to me ain’t foreign
But with you it’s different can’t explain it
I’m keeping up with discretion
Private flights coming for seconds
Screaming your name to the heavens in the late night


Longing for all of the games we’ll play
Giving into your fantasies
Bet it feels good to get release from me
Got me all on my knees for it
You know I’m such a tease with it
Do anything to please you babe, oh yeah


 I’ll let you decide to your place or mine?
Not going quick with it you ain’t leaving til you finish least a couple times
Look into my eyes
Taste you sweet as wine
Baby boy where you been at?
All nasty since you sent that
Pleasure so divine


Edging your intentions
Hands up and surrender
Let’s speed up the tempo til you’re sweating
Give me a list of directions
I wanna see your expressions
Mirror to see our reflections, make a movie


Longing for all of the games we’ll play
Giving into your fantasies
Bet it feels good to get release from me
Got me all on my knees for it
You know I’m such a tease with it
Do anything to please you babe, oh yeah


I’ll let you decide to your place or mine?
Not going quick with it you ain’t leaving til you finish least a couple times
Look into my eyes
Taste you sweet as wine
Baby boy where you been at?
All nasty since you sent that
Pleasure so divine
