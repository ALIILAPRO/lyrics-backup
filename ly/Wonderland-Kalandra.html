		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Far out, away from man
I find my wonderland
I fall asleep beneath the trees
Close my eyes as if to leave

And if you wonder where I've been
I have retreated to scale the mountain
Don't worry bout me or where I am
I'm in my wonderland, in my wonderland

Deep down I am at ease
Past the edge of my believes
There's no story without me
I paint I write, I set them free

So if you wonder where I've been
I've retreated to scale the mountain
Don't worry bout me or where I am
I'm in my wonderland, in my wonderland

Inside my mind
I leave it all behind

But if you wonder where I've been
I have retreated to scale the mountain
Don't worry bout me or where I am
I'm in my wonderland, in my wonderland

So don't you wonder where I've been
I have ascended, I've scaled the mountain
Don't worry bout me or where I am
I'm in my wonderland, this is my wonderland
