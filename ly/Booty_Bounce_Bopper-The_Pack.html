		  Up all night
Da pack is in da house
What y'all make the girls do?

Wolf pack make ya booty bounce bopper
Bend breathe stretch bitch let it go
Let it go
Wolf pack make ya booty bounce bopper
Bend breathe stretch bitch let it go
Let it go
Yeah do that
Let it go
With no hands
Let it go
Pussy poppin on a handstand
Let it go
Yeah 
Off top

Where I come from booty bounce
Dollar signs
Trees spark
Niggas ain't trippin off yo breeze
Get a crew 
On they knees
Its okay to be a freak
Let it go
Let it ride
If you a rip then let it slide
I jus wanna see that apple pie
Twirk that ass
Roll them eyes
Girl you know I'm on it good
Classy nigga
From the hood
Put yo goodies in a bag
Big booty
I'm hoppin
Lettin all the ppl watch me
Coca-cola shake that body
Bitch you know that you'z a hotty here we go

Wolf pack make ya booty bounce bopper
Bend breathe stretch bitch let it go
Let it go
Wolf pack make ya booty bounce bopper
Bend breathe stretch bitch let it go
Let it go
Yeah do that
Let it go
With no hands
Let it go
Pussy poppin on a handstand
Let it go
Yeah 
Off top

What's up wit it ma
I'm tryna come through
And show you you beezy how I do
Ssb derby and mcgee
Where these niggas go dumb on squares for free
Put that on her
Crack that back
Don't care if you white don't care if you black
I dugged up the purp
Sittin on shack
Young l on the beat so you know that it slap

You're now rockin wit da best wolf pack
Bounce it for a min then throw dat shit back
Its pack shit so you know all about the ...
So girl shake ya booty till yo back give out
Take it to the floor
Hoe dip it low
I ain't lil jon
Hoe get low
Make that shit clap
Give me a pause 
Ass all on my lap like santa clause ay

Wolf pack make ya booty bounce bopper
Bend breathe stretch bitch let it go
Let it go
Wolf pack make ya booty bounce bopper
Bend breathe stretch bitch let it go
Let it go
Yeah do that
Let it go
With no hands
Let it go
Pussy poppin on a handstand
Let it go
Yeah 
Off top

Cakey booty
Dummy donkey
Big ass titties all in my face
Niggas know that I don't play
Magnum girl
In my hand
Pack click we run this man
Stunna dude
Popped it hoe
Thizz that
Dumb tack
Pierce her butt like thumb tacks
Remy red
In my cup
Sip it till I'm on lean
Put these stars up on line
Track stars
Work them legs
Party freaks
Let em out
See who could
Freak the best
I ain't tryna see ya chest
I'm jus tryna see that ripped undress
And follow me
