		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't help but be destructive right now
It's been weeks since I saw your outline
In my room is a silence so loud
This is what losing hope might sound like

Put me down so I'm in my place
Say it's over for breathing space
All I was was a route to change
Is this just growing up?

I might seem too distracted right now
It's been so long I've been the punchline
I stand naked while these clothes dry out
Leave me drowning to edit the runtime

Put me down so I'm in my place
Say it's over for breathing space
All I was was a route to change
Is this just growing up?

All this love could not seal my fate
Low is all that I've been of late
Caught in webs I wove with my mistakes
But this is growing up

I can't help it but I love you so
I can't take this letting go
I still feel that we could work it out or something
All I am is only flesh and bone
Why's your heart so freezing cold?
Don't you leave your weight on me, on me (hey)

I can't help it but I love you so
I can't take this letting go
I still feel that we could work it out or something
All I am is only flesh and bone
Why's your heart so freezing cold?
Don't you leave your weight on me, on me (no, I can't help it, no)

I can't help it, but I love you so (no, I can't help it, no)
I can't take this lettin' go (I will never let you go)
I still feel that we could work it out or somethin' (I will never let you go)
(No, I can't help it, no)
All I am is only flesh and bone (no, I can't help it, no)
Why's your heart so freezin' cold? (I will never let you go)
Don't you leave your weight on me, on me (I will never let you go)
