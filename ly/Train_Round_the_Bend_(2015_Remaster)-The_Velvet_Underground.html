		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Train round the bend
Takin me away from my country
I'm sick of the trees
Take me to the city
Train comin' round the bend
Oh train comin' round the bend

Been in the country 
Oh much too long
Trying to be a farmer
But nothing that I planted 
Never seems to grow
Train comin' round the bend
Train comin' round the bend

Hey I am just a city boy
And really not the country kind
Oh I need the city streets 
And I need your light
To see bend comin' round the bend
The train comin' round the bend

Alright
Ooh Ohh 

Once
She's going twice
She's going to the loop 
Up and down
She's going twice
She's going the train 
Comin' round the bend
You know the train 
Comin' round the bend

And I'm out of nowhere
Takin' me back where I belong
I've been here once 
And I don't take it tonight
For the train comin' round the bend
The train comin' round the bend
Oh alright!
