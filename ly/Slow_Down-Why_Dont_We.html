		  (Hey)
Ohh-oh, ohh-ohh
Ohh-oh

Oh, I've been lying to myself
And I might know why
I miss the way you looked at me before
You left New York (hey)
I've been tryin' to find help
'Cause I can't deny
The way that I feel when I'm with you
Oh, I'd do anything to save ya

I think we need a little Californiacation
We took a shot at this but maybe we're too wasted
It's hard to swallow but I know we gotta chase it, oh

Slow down
I think that we just need to slow down, slow down 
Turn around
Things were so simple, we were fallin', fallin'

See ya, I wanna see ya, ah
I wish you weren't so far so I could see ya, ah
See the light, I wanna see the
We were comfortable, we didn't understand but now we know

I think we need a little Californiacation
We took a shot at this but maybe we're too wasted
It's hard to swallow but I know we gotta chase it, oh

Slow down
I think that we just need to slow down, slow down
Turn around
Things were so simple, we were fallin', fallin'

Slow down
I think that we just need to slow down, slow down (woah)
Turn around
Things were so simple, we were fallin', fallin'

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ohh, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh-oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh-oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa
