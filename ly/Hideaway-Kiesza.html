		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Taking me higher than I've ever been before
I'm holding it back, just want to shout out, give me more
You're just a hideaway, you're just a feeling
You let my heart escape, beyond the meaning
Not even I can't find a way to stop the storm
Oh, baby, it's out of my control, what's going on?
But you're just a chance I take to keep on dreaming
You're just another day that keeps me breathing

Baby, I love the way that there's nothing sure
Baby, don't stop me, hideaway with me some more

(Mash it)

Ooh, ah, ah, ooh
Ooh, ah, ah, ooh
Ooh, ah, ah, ooh
Ooh, ah, ah, ooh

You're sending a shiver up my spine, might overboard
You're bringing me closer to the edge of letting go (oh, oh)
But you're just a hideaway, you're just a feeling
You let my heart escape, beyond the meaning
Pulling my head into the clouds, I'm floating off
When you can be going, I can't find a way to stop (oh, oh)
But you're just a chance I take to keep on dreaming
You're just another day that keeps me breathing

Ooh, ah, ah, ooh
Ooh, ah, ah, ooh
Baby (ooh), I love the way (ah) that there's nothing sure
Baby (ah), don't stop me, hideaway (ooh) with me some more
(Ooh) oh, oh, oh
(Ah, ah) ah, ah
Hideaway (ooh) with me some more

Bringing me higher than I've ever been before
I'm holding it back, just want to shout out, give me more
But you're just a hideaway, you're just a feeling
You let my heart escape beyond the meaning
Not even I can find a way to stop the storm
Oh, baby, it's out of my control, what's going on?
You're just a chance I take to keep on dreaming
You're just another day that keeps me breathing

Ah, ah, ah, yeah
You're a day that keeps me dreaming

(Mash it)

Ooh, ah, ah, ooh
Ooh, ah, ah, ooh
Baby (ooh), I love the way (ah) that there's nothing sure
Baby (ah), don't stop me, hideaway (ooh) with me some more
(Ooh) oh, oh, oh
(Ah, ah) ah, ah
Hideaway (ooh) with me some more
