		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I pay.
I live to fight.
Homicide for a Lie.
I Feel the Anger.

I Feel the Pain,
Smashing in his Brain.
Feel the pressure,
Feel the Gun,

Shoot him 'cause he's only got
One.
Run Through Eternity,
You can think about in Hell.

Down on your Knees.
Piss on your Peace!
Now! Right away.
From Homicide.

Fuck all your Politics
Piss on your own.
I am the Law
Now hear Me.

Rags to riches you become the Corpse,
That is the Reward
Pray to your God while you still have some 
Time.

Death is so near,
Leave your life.
Victims of violence 
Are the ultimate

Victims
A death by the Killing.
Down on your Knees.
Piss on your Peace

Now! Right away.
From Homicide...
