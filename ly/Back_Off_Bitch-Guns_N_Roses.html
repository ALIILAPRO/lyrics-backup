		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh baby, pretty baby
Oh honey, you let me down honey
I ain't playin' childhood games no more
I said it's time for me
To even the score
So stake your claim
Your claim to fame
But baby call another name
When you feel the fire
And taste the flame

Back off, back off bitch
Down in the gutter dyin' in the ditch
You better back off, back off bitch
Face of an angel with the love of a witch
Back off, back off bitch
Back off, back off bitch
Oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh 

Makin' love
Cheap heartbreaker, broken backed
Nasty ballbreaker, stay out of my bed, outta my head
If it's lovin' you
I'm better off dead

Back off, back off bitch
Down in the gutter dyin' in the ditch
You better back off, back off bitch
Face of an angel with the love of a witch
Back off, back off bitch
Back off, back off bitch

Oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh

Emotions ripped, gone on a binge
Life lipped, I said you're off the hinge
Tellin' lies of such fame and glory
I don't even want to hear your story

Back off, back off bitch
Down in the gutter dyin' in the ditch
You better back off, back off bitch
Face of an angel with the love of a witch
Back off, back off bitch
It's such a pity that you're such a bitch

Back off, back off bitch
It's time to burn, burn the witch
Back off, back off bitch
Back off, back off bitch
Back off, back off bitch
Back off, back off bitch, bitch
Bitch, bitch, bitch
Hey wha'd'ya think he's tryin' to say there, anyway?
I think it's something each person's s'posed to take in their own special way
Fucking bitch
