		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The beast in me
Is caged by frail and fragile bonds
Restless by day
And by night, rants and rages at the stars

God help, the beast in me
The beast in me
Has had to learn to live with pain
And how to shelter from the rain

And in the twinkling of an eye
Might have to be restrained
God help the beast in me

Sometimes 
It tries to kid me that it's just a teddy bear
Or even somehow managed 
To vanish in the air

And that is when I must beware 
Of the beast in me
That everybody knows
They've seen him out dressed in my clothes

Patently unclear
If it's New York or New Year
God help the beast in me
The beast in me
