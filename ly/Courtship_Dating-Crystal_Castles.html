		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How do I feel for thee?
Your smile brings disease
'Cause we're young, willing from the start
When your skin is shed
Find a pile of your head
Now then, I'll look so smart

Stove burn on my hands
Show them to my friends
Make you participate
Eyes roll back around
Limbs fall to the ground
Seasoned to procreate

The first to interfere
Are culled before the deer
When they wander into the cage
Stuff their arms and thighs
Then they roll their cardboard eyes
Their skin will never age

Stove burn on my hands
Show them to my friends
Make you participate
Eyes roll back around
Limbs fall to the ground
Seasoned to procreate

Stove burn on my hands
Show them to my friends
Make you participate
Eyes roll back around
Limbs fall to the ground
Seasoned to procreate

Stove burn on my hands
Show them to my friends
Make you participate
Eyes roll back around
Limbs fall to the ground
Seasoned to procreate

Stove burn on my hands
Show them to my friends
Make you participate

Make you participate
