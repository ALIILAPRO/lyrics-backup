		<p>
		  Uh, bbno$
Yo, wassup, baby?
Skrr, skrr
Man, downtime your mother
Crazy guy, crazy
Skrr

Foreign clothes, foreign show, need a foreign ho (ho, ho, ho)
Foreign money, foreign honey, sippin' foreign pho (true)
Born show, born to glow, never said that (skrr, skrr)
Stayin' low on my toes, I'ma get that (get it)
It's gettin' serious
Make a bitch delirious
Bitches on my dick cause a boy so mysterious (woah)
That's a mystery
Thots makin' history
Wrist keep spinnin' like a fuckin' rotisserie (skrr)

David letterman, I said it man, I'm better, man (better)
She wrap me up, she wrap me up, just like the Santa man (woo)
I love my candy, tryna be a little sweeter man (sweet)
I'm after money, need my money, I'm a greedy man
Money on my grave, I'll run it up until I die (die)
Got some eyes on every spot, I'm flexin' like a fly (fly)
I never hurt a fly, I never cause a homicide (nah)
If you playin' with me, I'ma use some pesticide (skrr)
Baby

Foreign clothes, foreign show, need a foreign ho (ho, ho, ho)
Foreign money, foreign honey, sippin' foreign pho (true)
Born show, born to glow, never said that (skrr, skrr)
Stayin' low on my toes, I'ma get that (skrrr)
It's getting serious
Make a bitch delirious
Bitches on my dick 'cause a boy so mysterious (woah)
That's a mystery
Thots makin' history
Wrist keep spinnin' like a fuckin' rotisserie (skrr)

Got my wrist whippin' (whippin')
Lookin' like a chef (chef)
Oregano in my right, .30 on my left (yeah)
Pull up with the set, got the kitchen all wet
And the cream team comin' for your neck (lil' bitch, ooh)
I don't do shit, but my bitch got tits (tits)
Gravy walk around lookin' like a fuckin' lick (lick)
Side bitch thick and my main bitch thick
And my oatmeal thick, bitch, I can't even pick (woo)
Gravy be finnesin', it's a blessin' when I'm on the block
Teach your boy a lesson 'bout the flexin', bitches on my jock
Wrist so reflective, it's aggressive for a fuckin' clock
I been pourin' dressin' and caressin' on your fuckin' thot
(Holy shit)

Foreign clothes, foreign show, need a foreign ho
Foreign money, foreign honey, sippin' foreign pho
Born show, born to glow, never said that
Stayin' low on my toes, I'ma get that

Get it how I like
Get a ho I like, yeah
Cash out how I like 
Cash out how I like, yeah
Thotty ain't my type
Yeah, she ain't my type, yeah
Forty on my wrist
What a damn life, yeah
