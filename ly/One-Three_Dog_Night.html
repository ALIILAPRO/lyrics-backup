		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One is the loneliest number that you'll ever do
Two can be as bad as one
It's the loneliest number since the number one

No is the saddest experience you'll ever know
Yes, it's the saddest experience you'll ever know

'Cause one is the loneliest number that you'll ever do
One is the loneliest number, whoa, worse than two

It's just no good anymore since you went away
Now I spend my time just making rhymes of yesterday

One is the loneliest number
One is the loneliest number
One is the loneliest number that you'll ever do

One is the loneliest
One is the loneliest
One is the loneliest number that you'll ever do

It's just no good anymore since you went away

(Number)
One is the loneliest (number)
One is the loneliest (number)
One is the loneliest number that you'll ever do

(Number)
One is the loneliest (number)
One is the loneliest (number)
One is the loneliest number that you'll ever do

(Number)
One (one is the loneliest number that you'll ever do)
(Number)
One is the loneliest number that you'll ever do
(Number)
One is the loneliest number that you'll ever do
