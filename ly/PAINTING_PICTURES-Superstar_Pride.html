		  Mm-mm-mm
(GlobalKnockz got the recipe)
Just thinkin' 'bout the way you make me feel
It's so, it's so real

2 AM, the night still young
You live by the gun, you gon' die by the gun
Ain't no handouts for nobody
When I ain't had shit, they ain't offer me nothin'
When I'm quiet, I be thinkin' 'bout killings
A lot of niggas bitch-made, stay in they feelings
Savin' these hoes, this shit here pitiful
All these lil' bitty bitches my chillens, ooh
And mama, don't worry
You raised a gangster, I'm a survivor
It hurt me not bein' able to give you what you want
Since I was a toddler
Shoutout to my pops for all the free game
Everything you ever told me, it stuck in my brain
Real OG status, sheddin' light to make a change
Shedded tears writin' this, in so much pain

All the sheisty shit that I've done
Blessed to not be in no chains
Uncle kept with me when I was young
Mama blessed the boy with the cocaine
Growin' up, I ain't have no daddy
My mama played both roles
Been hard on a nigga since I came out the womb
Yeah, the pussy hole
I was taught to trust none
Face your problems, never run
Lil' bitch hollin' she pregnant
You a lil' gnat-gnat, that ain't my son
Tryna trap me, know I had a glove
Fuck them feelings, slatt, I'm a thug
You a lil' dusty ho, you're the rug
Ayy, and it's still fuck love

2 AM, the night still young
You live by the gun, you gon' die by the gun
Ain't no handouts for nobody
When I ain't had shit, they ain't offer me nothin'
When I'm quiet, I be thinkin' 'bout killings
A lot of niggas bitch-made, stay in they feelings
Savin' these hoes, this shit here pitiful
All these lil' bitty bitches my chillens, ooh
And mama, don't worry
You raised a gangster, I'm a survivor
It hurt me not bein' able to give you what you want
Since I was a toddler
Shoutout to my pops for all the free game
Everything you ever told me, it stuck in my brain
Real OG status, sheddin' light to make a change
Shedded tears writin' this, in so much pain
