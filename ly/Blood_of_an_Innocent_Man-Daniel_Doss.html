		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, what's the cost for Jesus' head?
Will thirty pieces get Him dead?
Be careful when the sun goes down
There's some fellas comin' 'round
Pilate thought his hands were clean
He blamed it on the Pharisees
Even a Roman guard could see
They should've set Him free

You got the blood of an innocent man
On your hands, on your hands
You got the blood of an innocent man
On your hands

Don't be quick to blame the dead
The same of you could be said
Don't you know the role you played?
Child, you werе there that day
'Cause your еvery sin and every wrong
Held the nails and hammered strong
Smashed the thorns into His brow
And mocked the Savior's crown

You got the blood of an innocent man
On your hands, on your hands
You got the blood of an innocent man
On your hands
You got the blood of an innocent man
On your hands, on your hands
You got the blood of an innocent man
On your hands

Mm, don't be so naive to think
He could not walk right off that tree
But He chose the cross to set us free
While we were still enemies
So if you call on Jesus' name
Confess that He took all your blame
When you stand on Judgment Day
With open arms, the Father will look down on you and say

You got the blood of an innocent man
On your hands, on your hands
You got the blood of an innocent man
On your hands
Come on in
You got the blood of an innocent man
On your hands, on your hands
You got the blood of an innocent man
Oh

Hallelujah, hallelujah
The blood of the innocent man covers me, yeah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
The blood of the innocent man covers me, yeah oh
What can wash away my sin?
What can make me whole again?
Nothing but the blood of the innocent

Yeah, the Lamb
The blood of the Lamb
The blood of the Lamb, yeah
Nothing but the blood of the innocent Lamb, hallelujah
(The blood of the Lamb) Hey yeah
(The blood of the Lamb)
Oh, nothing but the blood of the innocent Lamb (Lamb)
