		  Look

You know

When they see me in the street, they be callin' out my name (East)
Back the fuck up, you keep foggin' up my frame (yeah)
She gon' act the fuck up when it's time to do my thang (I know) 
Flat the fuck out with this money in your mouth (niggas can't)
They can't shut me up (yeah), they can't shut me up (yeah)
They can't shut me up (yeah), I talk big and back it up (okay)
They can't shut me up (yeah), they can't shut me up (yeah)
They can't shut me up (yeah), I talk big and back it up (okay)

Look, I do it so big, you would've thought I signed with Diddy (baby)
Only hit it once and she got Pablo on her titties (one time)
Flowers by the unit, I'm like Ralo in my city (Ralo)
If she swallow, I might I follow, I got hallows in this semis (brrt)
Posted in my section, I'm too hot for all them pictures (too hot)
Why you keep tryna talk to me, nigga, you don't see all these bitches? (Why?)
FNs with switches, in my pockets got two midgets
Couple Ps just came 'round, can't break down, I'm too busy (wake up)

When they see me in the street, they be callin' out my name (East)
Back the fuck up, you keep foggin' up my frame (yeah)
She gon' act the fuck up when it's time to do my thang (huh)
Flat the fuck out with this money in your mouth (niggas can't) 
They can't shut me up (at all, ayy), they can't shut me up (never, yeah)
They can't shut me up (yeah), I talk big and back it up (yeah)
They can't shut me up (yeah), they can't shut me up (yeah)
They can't shut me up (yeah), I talk big and back it up (yeah)

I love the sound of (I love the sound of), the money counter (the money counter) 
Ain't too many (ain't too many), I can count on (I can count on), ayy
Wealthy problems (ayy, ayy), you ain't got 'em (you ain't got 'em)
Your bitch fallin' (ayy), I call her autumn (yee), yeah
Karats, baguettes (ooh), I'm there to collect (ooh)
We fly overseas (ooh), I Paris the jet (for real)
She fuckin' a rapper (ayy), her parents upset (you know)
She lie to her man, she still got me on her breath, ayy
If I want a bad one, get a bad bitch pronto (pronto)
If she actin' up, she not the only bitch that I know (no)
Yeah, I got a bitch, my bottom bitch a top model (fact)
If I'm talkin' big, I back it up 'cause that's the motto (yee)

When they see me in the street, they be callin' out my name (East)
Back the fuck up, you keep foggin' up my frame (yeah)
She gon' act the fuck up when it's time to do my thang (huh)
Flat the fuck out with this money in your mouth (niggas can't) 
They can't shut me up (at all), they can't shut me up (never)
They can't shut me up (yeah), I talk big and back it up (yeah)
They can't shut me up (yeah), they can't shut me up (yeah)
They can't shut me up (no), I talk big and back it up (no, no)
