		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Up all night cant get you outta my head
Good or bad I'll take whatever it is
I had a feeling the moment we met
That my life was about to get more complicated

You're playing it cool
Is that for your own protection
I'm playing the fool
So this is my only question

What you want with my head
You got my attention
It's starting to get
A little invasive now
But go ahead
Keeping me guessing
You love the obsession
I don't have exit plan
In my head I'm rounding the bases
Whatever comes next
I'm ready to face it now
I'm on edge
You're making me walk it
When I end up falling
You'll have to carry me out

How many times do you come over at two
Said the party was dumb you needed something to do
How many nights will you ask me to stay (ask me to stay)
Then pretend like were just casually making mistakes

You're playing it cool
Is that for your own protection
I'm playing the fool
So this is my only question

So what you want with my head
You got my attention
It's starting to get
A little invasive now
But go head
Keeping me guessing
You love the obsession
I don't have exit plan
In my head I'm rounding the bases
Whatever comes next
I'm ready to face it now
I'm on edge
You're making me walk it
When I end up falling
You'll have to carry me out
