		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The skin on my bones is leather cold
Poisoned my heart beats slow
Fear of crashing and not coming back
I'm a curse to my friends, to be condemned
Mistakes I made and won't mend
Fear of crashing and not coming back

I dream of death, its violent breath
I'm caught with my maker in step
Fear of crashing and not coming back
I could bleach clean my soul but he knows I know I'm coming to dine in his hole
Fear of crashing and not coming back

Visions of a life
Where I was satisfied
Feed my hungry mind
Where are you when I close my eyes?

I left this world behind
For the world I'd built inside
Feed my hungry mind
Where are you when I close my eyes?

Why do I feel so strange?
A nuclear family and friends my own age
I follow the rules, do what it says on the tin
But I'm still on the outside still looking in

Why was I born with itchy feet?
And why do I hate all the people I meet?
People's ideals give me the chills to the bone
I got one thousandmillion friends and I feel so alone

Stay as you are
Everybody likes you
Everybody cares
There's some insight for you
I'll get my coat
I'll be the bitch
I heard that journeys end in lovers meeting
But my journey ends when my heart stops beating
I'm leaving

Stay as you are
Everybody loves you
Everybody cares
There's some insight for you
I'll get my coat
I'll be the bitch
I heard that journeys end in lovers meeting
But my journey ends when my heart stops beating
I'm leaving

Human heart in my hand
Heart in my, human heart in my hand
Taking it back, eyes straight ahead
Cut it in half, better than dead
Human heart in my hand
Heart in my, human heart in my hand
Taking it back, eyes straight ahead
Cut it in half, better than dead
Human heart in my hand
Heart in my, human heart in my hand
Taking it back, eyes straight ahead
Cut it in half, better than dead
