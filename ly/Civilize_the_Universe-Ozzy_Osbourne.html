		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Found exploding, and tears are growing
Chasing rockets and grasping my head
They can call it justice, a retribution
But the reasons are never clear

Freedom is just mans' invention
And a soldier is just a slave
Self inflicted
So addicted
Our habits are hard to break

[Chorus:]
I'm alive
Watching better turn to worse
(Watching better turn to worse)
One more time
Try to civilize the universe
(Civilize the universe)

Without the righteous
Without the faithful
We would never accept the obscene

A false confession, and priest's obsession
Is the demon the light to be seen
Burn the witch and hang his head as
There's only one choice to be made
With thought restricted
And heart afflicted
The truth be so hard to take

[Chorus]

The righteous and the faithful
Give the good man to the blind
The world full of confusion
From every disease confined

[Chorus x2]

Try to civilize the universe
(Civilize the universe)
