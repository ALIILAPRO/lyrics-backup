		  These girls fall like dominoes, dominoes (J.R.)
These girls fall like dominoes, d-d-dominoes
These girls fall like dominoes, dominoes
These girls fall like dominoes, d-d-dominoes
Dominoes, d-d-dominoes (uh-huh, yo, ayo)

Ayo, I'ma need sixtey-nine real bad girls for my tour bus
Somebody get security to escort us
They go the long way but we take the shortcut
Give me the blonde hair, long weave, short cut
You know the flow sick, came in on the small bus
So give the S-cup, C-cup, small bust
They judge me like the girl's on trial
But every time that I come out it's just girls gone wild
Got the domino effect in the front row passing out
With little bikini tops, they got they asses hanging out
Say my shoe game nuts, so I call 'em cashews
Every other city it's another Nicki tattoo
Steal Wayne girls, I steal Drake girls
You know the real bitches love me, fuck the fake girls
So if you pretty I sign titties
I got the key to every mothafucking city, k'yeah

These girls fall like dominoes, dominoes
These girls fall like dominoes, d-d-dominoes
These girls fall like dominoes, dominoes
These girls fall like dominoes, d-d-dominoes
Dominoes, d-d-dominoes

Okay so when I'm in the Hills, I hang with Kristin Cavallari
And when I'm in Miami, I'm with Kourtney, Kim and Khloe
And when I'm in the A, I'm with Ciara or it's Keri
I'm feeling like a diva then I hit Mariah Carey
I'm in the UK, I'ma see MIA
Super hero by night, rapper by day
And if I just wanna talk I'ma hit up Monique
If I need a bad bitch Angelina Jolie (woo)
Material girls like Madonna, models for Donatella
Ain't nothing you can tell her, 'cause she get the Mozzarella
She look just like Rihanna
She work with Wilhelmina, only rocking Galliano
She might be Filipino, be sipping Pellegrino
Be watching Al Pacino, she could probably sniff a kilo
Anyway yo, hit up Grace Jones and tell her I said Strangé
I'm out in Paris motherfucker with Beyoncé

These girls fall like dominoes, dominoes
These girls fall like dominoes, d-d-dominoes
These girls fall like dominoes, dominoes
These girls fall like dominoes, d-d-dominoes
Dominoes, d-d-dominoes

Girls, girls every day from London, Canada and the USA
Girls, girls every day from London, Canada and the USA
Girls, girls every day from London, Canada and the USA
Girls, girls every day from London, Canada and the USA

Where my westside girls at?
And where my eastside girls at?
Yo, where my North side girls at?
And where my down south girls at?
Yo, where my westside girls at?
Yo, where my eastside girls at?
Where my up North side girls at?
Now where my down south girls at?

These girls fall like dominoes, dominoes
These girls fall like dominoes, d-d-dominoes
These girls fall like dominoes, dominoes
These girls fall like dominoes, d-d-dominoes
Dominoes, d-d-dominoes
