		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oceans in between us couldn't keep us apart
Mountains in the distance couldn't bury our love
I would search forever, swim up
Every single river 'cause I know how it feels
And it's real

Must be something in my heart that beats for you
And when it gets dark, it guides me through
Even when I'm lost, the magnets show me where you are
'Cause I've got a compass heart

Oh, I've got a compass heart
And in the dark
Yeah, it shows me where you are

Oh, I've got a compass heart
And in the dark
Yeah, it shows me where you are

Closer than my skin, it's flowing in my veins
In the oxygen in every breathe I take
Signals never fading like a flare, when I'm in danger
Always saving me endlessly

'Cause there's something in my heart that beats for you
And when it gets dark, it guides me through
Even when I'm lost, the magnets show me where you are
'Cause I've got a compass heart

Oh, I've got a compass heart
And in the dark
Yeah, it shows me where you are

Oh, I've got a compass heart
And in the dark
Yeah, it shows me where you are

No matter how long it takes, no matter how far away
No matter how long it takes, no matter how far away
No matter how long it takes, it takes, it takes, it takes

Oh, I've got a compass heart

No matter how long it takes, no matter how far away
I will always get to ya
No matter how long it takes, just know that I'll find a way
'Cause I've got a compass heart
