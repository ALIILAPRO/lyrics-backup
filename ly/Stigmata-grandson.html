		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How do you get in the mind-state to kill?
How do you get in the mind-state to kill?
I need a fill
Of violence to bust up the silence for real
Traumatized, ain't gonna hide how I feel
The truth is alive and well
It's underground living on the Wi-Fi still
Don't buy all the lies they sell
When the Black Hawk flies head right for the hills

They put a hole in the back of my head, called it suicide
Woke up with these holes in my hands from the day I was crucified
You decide if you wanna ride, can't stop us when we unified
I woke up with these holes in my hands from the day I was crucified
Stigmata!
(Stigmata)

There ain't no hero to save the day
Figure to pave the way quicker
To stave another day
Away before we gotta pay the gravedigger
It's all up to us to deliver
I walk through the valley where the snakes, they slither
Where the rain gets thicker and the pain disfigures
Who's gonna rise when saints pray to sinners?
The truth won't die when they pull that trigger

They put a hole in the back of my head, called it suicide
Woke up with these holes in my hands from the day I was crucified
You decide if you wanna ride, can't stop us when we unified
I woke up with these holes in my hands from the day I was crucified
Stigmata!
(Stigmata)

Burn me down, strip me bare
Watch me drown, I don't care
Drag your nails across my mind
Still I walk, sanctified

(The truth won't die when they pull that trigger!)
(Stigmata)
(The truth won't die when they pull that trigger!)

They put a hole in the back of my head, called it suicide
I woke up with these holes in my hands from the day I was crucified
You decide if you wanna ride, can't stop us when we unified
They put a hole in the back of my head, called it suicide
Stigmata!
