		  Hot thing, hot thing
Hot thing (hot thing)
Hot thing (hot thing)
Hot thing (hot thing)
Hot thing (hot thing)
(Hot thing) What's up with it
(Hot thing) What's up with it
(Hot thing) What's up with it
(Hot thing) What's up with it

Shorty got a body that jeans can't hold
And she moving like she learned everything from the pole
And she loves to party, number one hobby
Out till the morning better ask somebody

Yo, talk to the girl walk here's the round (yo)
Watch what happen to you when she hear the sound (yo)
Tell her shake it up, tell her hit the ground (yo)
Gonna face time see if she's down (yeah)

She's a girl from the future 
Says she's sick and tired of the old
So all that old shit can hit the road
Man you only know if you know 'cause she's

A hot thing (hot thing)
Hot thing (hot thing)
Hot thing (hot thing)
Hot thing (hot thing)
(Hot thing) What's up with it
(Hot thing) What's up with it (oh damn)
(Hot thing) What's up with it
(Hot thing) What's up with it (she's so bubblicious)

Seen her amazing she stopped and pose
When she seen the green one she just go, go, go
Like a stolen Bugatti, got money in your pocket
That makes you a Willy Parker pop up when he got a body

Yo, talk to the girl walk here's your round (yeah)
Watch what will happen to you when she hear the sound
Tell her shake it up, tell her hit the ground
(Yo) gonna face time, see if she's down

She said you must have money in your wallet till the thing don't fall
And this is credit cards black not gold
Now you only know if you know

For real she's a hot thing (hot thing)
Hot thing (hot thing) (she's a)
Hot thing (hot thing)
Hot thing (hot thing) (she's a)
(Hot thing) What's up with it
(Hot thing) What's up with it (oh damn)
(Hot thing) What's up with it (oh it's better)
(Hot thing) What's up with it (when she bubblicious)

Fly young hot thing girl lemme cool off
G-Q status wouldn't fuck me with my suit on
She a fashion killer and you know 
I am a shoe hog Christian Louis Vuitton red bottoms
Gives me blue balls
She fuck me like she know me, and fuck me like she owe me
She told me the she showed me, then she cuddle like she lonely
All for the love, for the Holy Matrimony
But I'm pretty like Tony and I'm pimping like Goldie

How ya, how ya, how ya doing, I'm the motherfucking man
True hot boy catch me running with the flame
She a hot girl so she's running with the name
Drop it like it's hot on my motherfucking thing
Mommy like a lotta, Papi like the Murcielago
Grido riding down Mercer go Nicki Minaj flow
When I hit the verse-uh, if you let me menage
I'll take you to see Usher

Yo, talk to the girl walk here's your round (gotta talk to a man)
Watch what will happen to you when she hear the sound (hey when she hear the sound)
Tell her shake it up, tell hit the ground (yo) (shake it up)
(Lemme see it drop it down low) Gonna face time see if she's down

She said it don't really take to much to get me out of control
Baby, you stop this my show
Just take a little and I'm good to go (yeah man)

You with a hot thing (hot thing)
Hot thing (hot thing)
Hot thing (hot thing)
Hot thing (hot thing)
(Hot thing) What's up with it (I like them girls with the bubblicious)
(Hot thing) What's up with it (without a man)
(Hot thing) What's up with it (ain't gotta have a lot)
(Hot thing) What's up with it (just enough for me to hold on to)
