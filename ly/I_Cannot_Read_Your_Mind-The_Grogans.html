		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I think it every day, will you come back my way, my way. 
You never thought I cared, you never thought I cared about you. 
But I do.
I cannot read your mind.
I cannot read your mind.

You take a piece of my life.
Every time I see your face I pull through, I pull through.
You never thought I cared, you never thought I cared about you. 
But I do.
I cannot read your mind.
I cannot read your mind.
I cannot read your mind.
I cannot read your mind.

Your mind baby, read your mind I can't, read your mind, read your mind I can't.
Read your mind, read your mind I can't.
Read your mind, read your mind I can't.
Read your mind, read your mind I can't.
Read your mind, read your mind I can't.
Read your mind, read your mind I can't.
Read your mind, read your mind I can't.
