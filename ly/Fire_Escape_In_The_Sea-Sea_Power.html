		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well it wasn't good but it was ok
Now I think I'll leave by the fire escape
The night is almost over now
I don't want the day to find out how
 
We're up against it
What you here for are you here for again?
What you here for are you here for again?
 
To rub against it
 
Deserted streets and neural networks lead
Me home to you you home to me
It's obvious yeah it's oh so clear
It's beautiful when you are near
 
We're up against it
So what you here for are you here for again?
What you here for are you here for again?
So what you here for are you here for again?
What you here for are you here for again?
 
To rub against it
To rub against it
