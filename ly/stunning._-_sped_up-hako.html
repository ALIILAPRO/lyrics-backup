		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I like money
Like diamonds
Look stunning
Like you
Big bag, 400
Locked up, all cool
Running the show with the guys
If they don't pull up, ain't no fun in the stu'
Having some fun with your bitch
If she don't pull up, I ain't pulling the coupe'

Pull out the G63 and i'm 16 little bitch, so what?
Running my mind like a boss, lil bitch, lil pussy, I could do what I want
Double C all on my bag, we bought him a tag, than bought some 1's
He thought he funny lil bitch, lil bitch, lil bitch, we fucking her cunt

Yeah
She brought me down but i'm living so high
I cannot feel my legs
Can't feel my lips
Can't feel my spine
Trying to count all my bread, i'm born so rich, like oh my God
What is the reason for lies?
Move 'round the city with fire

I like money
Like diamonds
Look stunning
Like you
Big bag, 400
Locked up, all cool
Running the show with the guys
If they don't pull up, ain't no fun in the stu'
Having some fun with your bitch
If she don't pull up, I ain't pulling the coupe'
Pull out the G63 and i'm 16 little bitch, so what?
