		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't need drugs
I'm already six feet low
Wasted on you
Waiting for a miracle
I can't move on
Feels like we're frozen in time
I'm wasted on you
Just pass me the bitter truth

Love, don't you remember?
We were the ones
Nothing could ever change and love
It's easier not to believe we have broken everything
But here we are
Numb my head till I can't think anymore
But I still feel the pain

I don't need drugs
I'm already six feet low
Wasted on you
Waiting for a miracle
I can't move on
Feels like we're frozen in time
I'm wasted on you
Just pass me the bitter truth

Once this was a garden
This was our world
All of the nightmares stayed in the dark
A little too much time by yourself
And you become the enemy
Just look at us now
Drowning slowly, just to stay true

I don't need drugs
I'm already six feet low
Wasted on you
Waiting for a miracle
I can't move on
I feel like we're frozen in time
I'm wasted on you
Just pass me the bitter truth

Will I ever be the same?
Am I strong enough to change?
Is it in my blood?
Shield my eyes to face the day
Come too far to slip away
But it's killing me to go on without you

I don't need drugs
I'm already six feet low
I'm wasted on you
Waiting for a miracle
I can't move on
Like we're frozen in time
I'm wasted on you
Just pass me the bitter truth
