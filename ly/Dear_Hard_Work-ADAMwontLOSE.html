		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dear hard work
I used to hate you
When you called my name
I heard it but ran away from you
When I knew you were coming
I used to hide from you
When you influenced others to talk to me
I quickly made excuses to get away from you

Afraid of the pain because I didn't want to get hurt
Afraid to fall so I didn't even try
Afraid of the shame that you might put me through
And afraid of your name
Because of what you have done to others
Who do you think you are?
Making me so afraid of who you are?

Reflection in the mirror
Shadow behind me
I take one step and you're still ahead of me

Sweat on my face
Tears in my eyes
I keep on going
I heard you tell no lies
You turn the poor to rich
F to A's
Is there anything that you can't do?

Now look at me
You made me who I am today
And because of you
I have this never losing
Never giving up attitude

Quitting?
That's not in my vocabulary
When they quit
I keep going
When they sleep
I work harder
When they say that I can't and count me out
I show them that I can
When I tell them about my dreams
And they laugh
I make sure I laugh last

I'm a dream chaser
That means I chase my dreams
And not no one else's
Only I can defeat me
It's me against this work you put in front of me
There is no losing
I will not lose
I came this far and I'm not stopping now

O Hard work
My dad was right about you
You do pay off and because of that I love you
How can I not?
I'm no longer hiding from you
I'm waiting for you
Matter of fact where are you?
I need you
Because in hard work I trust!
