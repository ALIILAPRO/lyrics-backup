		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We live our lives in fever
In a choking sweat of fear
In the heat of the night you can feel so much
In the heat of the night I scream
Don't touch

I remember a time when we used and abused
And fought all our battles in vain
I remember a time we thought that passion was free
In the heart of the night, bodies aflame

We live in fever

I hear your secret heartbeat
I can hear your silent cries
The kids have lost their freedom
And nobody cares till somebody famous dies

I remember a time when we used and abused
And fought all our battles in vain
I remember a time we thought that passion was free
In the heart of the night, bodies aflame

We live in fever
We live in fever

Now we live, in a world of uncertainty
Fear is the key, to what you want to be
You don't get a say 
The majority gets its way
You're outnumbered by the bastards
'Til the day you die

I hear your silent heartbeat
I hear your silent cries
Oh your just in lies, lies and lies

The kids have lost their freedom
And nobody cares 'til somebody famous dies
Keep telling lies and lies and lies and lies and lies and lies and lies and lies and lies and lies
Ah, ah, ah 

I remember the time when we used and abused
Ah, it was just lies
I remember the time we thought that passion was free
Ah, it was just lies and lies and lies and lies and lies and lies and lies

Hear the night, oh 
We live in fever
We live in fever
We live in fever

Now we live in a world of insanity
Fear is the key to what you want to be
You don't get a say the majority gets it's way
You're outnumbered by the bastards 'til the day you die
