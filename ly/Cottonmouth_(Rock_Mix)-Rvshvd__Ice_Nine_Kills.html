		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (It's Rvshvd)

Same side of the tracks
Same man on the dash
Same smoke out the sack
Back when you had my back, yeah
Yeah, we used to be good
Made it out the woods
I got a different truck
But you the one that done switched up

And I go back
Down them old back roads
I keep my grass cut low
So them snake eyes show

You were supposed to ride with me
Day one, play none, shotgun
Straight sippin' on rye whiskey
Damn, why you had to do me like that? Mm
Y'all best be watching out
'Cause word 'round town is a cottonmouth runnin' 'round
That's why I keep my forty five with me, mm

(Yeah)

Don't cross that county line
That's a "Don't come back, not welcome" sign
That field, that creek, that bar is mine, yeah
Clean break, cut ties

You were supposed to ride with me
Day one, play none, shotgun
Straight sippin' on rye whiskey
Damn, why you had to do me like that? Mm
Y'all best be watching out
'Cause word 'round town is a cottonmouth runnin' 'round
That's why I keep my forty-five with me (yeah)

You were supposed to ride with me

When I go back, down them old back roads
I keep my grass cut low, so them snake eyes show

You were supposed to ride with me
Day one, play none, shotgun
Straight sippin' on rye whiskey
Damn, why you had to do me like that? Mm
Y'all best be watching out
'Cause word 'round town is a cottonmouth runnin' 'round
That's why I keep my forty-five with me, mm

You were supposed to ride with me, mm
You were supposed to ride with me
