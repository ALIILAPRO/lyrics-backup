		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Looking through the telescope, will I get a visit?
Looking at my phone stuck going through the images
Looking in the mirror I can see a limit
I can see a body, I can feel a difference
A thing called time, yeah, I track it with the digits
Satellite business, I was in a space
Communication with the energy for forgiveness
Communication with the energy disappearing
Communication with a memory reappearing
The love and the care and the words I was given
The memory is fading like a dream
But I'm carried by a spirit then I'm back living in it
Through the eyes of my child, I can see an inner-vision
Through the eyes of my child, I can see you in my vision
Through the eyes of my child, I can see an inner-vision
Through the eyes of my child, I can see you in my vision

Thinking maybe there's no ends
Maybe just infinity
Maybe no beginnings
Maybe just bridges, think, uh
Thinking maybe there's no ends
Maybe just infinity
Maybe no beginnings
Maybe just bridges, may-
