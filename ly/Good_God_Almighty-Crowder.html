		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't count the times I've called Your name some broken night
And You showed up and patched me up like You do every time

I get amnesia
I forget that You keep coming around
Yeah, ain't no way You'll ever let me down

Good God Almighty
I hope You'll find me
Praising Your name no matter what comes

'Cause I know where I'd be
Without Your mercy
So I keep praising Your name at the top of my lungs

Tell me, is He good? (He's good)
Tell me, is He God? (He's God)
He is, Good God Almighty

You say Your love goes on forever, that Your mercy never stops
So why would I assume You'd be somebody that You're not?

Like sun in the morning
I know You're gonna be there every day
So what on earth could make me be afraid?

Good God Almighty
I hope You'll find me
Praising Your name no matter what comes

'Cause I know where I'd be
Without Your mercy
So I keep praising Your name at the top of my lungs

Tell me is He good? (He's good)
Tell me is He God? (He's God)
He is, Good God Almighty

Praise Him in the morning
Praise Him in the noon time
Praise Him when the Sun goes down

Love Him in the morning
Love Him in the noon time
Love Him when the Sun goes down

Good God Almighty
I hope You'll find me (I hope You'll find me)
Praising Your Name no matter what comes (no matter what comes)

'Cause I know where I'd be
Without Your mercy
So I keep praising Your name at the top of my lungs

Tell me is He good? (He's good)
Tell me is He God? (He's God)
He is, Good God Almighty

Jesus in the morning
Jesus in the noon time
Jesus when the Sun goes down

Jesus in the morning
Jesus in the noon time
Jesus when the Sun goes down
