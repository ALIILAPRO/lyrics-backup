		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't know how I got here
But we cannot get out
I'm surrounded by strangers
As the music starts to pound
I see the bodies slowly swayin'
Movin' side to side
I feel the animal is rising
As I slowly come alive

So everybody starts to move now
I wanna see you all give way
I wanna tear this place apart tonight
And have you thank me for my rage
Tell me what you came for
Can I give you just a taste?
I wanna see you lose your fucking minds
And rip apart this place

Let me see you move your bodies
(Let me see you move your bodies)
Let me see you move your bodies

I'll tear you apart
I'll feed off your heart
I wanna see your bodies grinding just for me
I'm just what you need, the perfect disease
Don't you wanna turn the beauty into the beast?

Into the beast
(Into the beast)

Endorphins start to swell now
As I step up to my throne
I feel the monster caged inside of me
Screaming through my bones
I wanna see you start to sweat now
I wanna see you lose your minds
I wanna feel you all from deep within
Swayin' back and forth all night

Let me see you move your bodies
(Let me see you move your bodies)
Let me see you move your bodies

I'll tear you apart
I'll feed off your heart
I wanna see your bodies grinding just for me
I'm just what you need, the perfect disease
Don't you wanna turn the beauty into the beast?
(Into the beast)

Let me see you bleed
Let me hear you scream
"Hey oh, hey oh"
Let me see you move
Let me hear you say, hear you say

I see the bodies slowly swayin'
Movin' side to side
I feel the animal is rising

I'll tear you apart
I'll feed off your heart
I wanna see your bodies grinding just for me
I'm just what you need, the perfect disease
Don't you wanna turn the beauty into the beast?

I'll tear you apart
I'll feed off your heart

I'm just what you need, the perfect disease
Don't you wanna turn the beauty into the beast?
Into the beast

The beauty in me, the beauty in me
The beauty's the beast
