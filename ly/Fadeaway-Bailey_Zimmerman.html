		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  That flame blew out in a cross fade wind
And I don't know if it'll get lit again
Watched your taillights fade in a red sunset
And now I'm trying like hell to try and forget
That

It's broken, you're long gone
Everything that coulda been went wrong and
I tried, my best
To hold on to what I could but you just slipped
Right outta my fingertips
Right off of my lips
Swore everything would be okay
And you would never leave, you'd always stay
Then I watched you fade away

Nothing hurts worse than stovetop burn
After the first time, you'd think I'd learn
That it was always gonna end like this
With a fell short wish
And it can't be fixed 'cause

It's broken, you're long gone
Everything that coulda been went wrong and
I tried my best
To hold on to what I could but you just slipped
Right outta my fingertips
Right off of my lips
Swore everything would be okay
And you would never leave, you'd always stay
Then I watched you fade away
And then I watched you fade away

Yeah, it was always gonna end like this
With a fell short wish
And it can't be fixed 'cause

It's broken, you're long gone
Everything that coulda been went wrong and
I tried my best
To hold on to what I could but you just slipped
Right outta my fingertips
Right off of my lips
Swore everything would be okay
And you would never leave, you'd always stay
Then I watched you fade away
But then I watched you fade away

Yeah, it's broken, you're long gone
