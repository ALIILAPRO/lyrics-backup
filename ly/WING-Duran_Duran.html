		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She'll never know what's eating me alive
A hungry demi-god that will not be denied
I am foundering on the absence
Of desire meant for me
Laid bare, imagination for all to see

Where does she sleep?
And where does sleep find she?
Maybe I want my bitter visions to come real
On a pilgrimage of lusting
That should've come my way
But my mind, it is a jail called Jealousy

On a wing of innocence, fly me out of here
Surrendered faith but I'm holding dread
And I pray to consequence if my voice you hear
For a better man to be in my head

I'll never show the knife that's deep inside
How with its twist the more it cuts away at pride
Like a rabid dog at communion
That we could not hide away
The family's secret bloodstained history

On a wing of innocence, fly me out of here
I surrender faith but I'm holding dread
And I pray to consequence if my voice you hear
For a better man to be in my head

On a wing of innocence, fly me out of here
I surrender faith but I'm holding dread
And I pray to consequence if my voice you hear
For a better man to be in my head

Surrendered faith but I'm holding dread
For a better man to be in my head
