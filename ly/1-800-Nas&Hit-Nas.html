		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No, my brother, you've got to buy your own
Yeah
Yeah, woo

Yo, it's like the box sets
Star Wars, Fast and Furious franchises
Six projects, six sagas, it's hood science
4 A.M. Infomercials tellin' you where to buy it
1-800-Nas&Hit, all six like a greatest hits
No, my brother, you got to cop your own
Whether we did diamond or hardly sold
We did it for our soul
Hop out the V and park by Neiman Marcus
Hope I don't see a snatch and grab
They shop for free, I pay the charges
Straight up
If Huey was a rapper, he would say some wild things over a sample
Think about it
Shh
If Malcolm was a rapper, he would say some shit over the breaks
Come out with neck snappers, I promise
Shh
They would be singin' the same song as me
Probably not killed by the CIA or the industry
Know where black hands be on black Glocks
No back stabs or sad plots, we let them rot

1-800-Nas&Hit, don't call us with no politics
And when you talk to us make sure you talk to us with common sense
This one is goliath, big, leaped over a giant bridge
Called my counterparts, I told 'em they gotta try this shit

Let's win
Let's win
Let's win
Let's win

Finally killed the King's Disease, I see what a genius see
Unclutter your mind for once, let me set the scenery
Put down the diamonds and blunts, put down the wine and the cups
Put your ideas in play, it ain't what it seem to be
Don't get stuck in the Hollywood shuffles
Did a show they snuck in the trailer and stole the duffle
You thinkin' major, they thinkin' tiny, they tried to Deebo
Please don't remind me the reason I bought these Desert Eagles
Got Ron Isley age difference on my missus wishes
Hit a store the receipt look like a Christmas wish list
Cougars waist trainin', salute, amazin' ain't it?
Health, I praise the single mom life, casual datin'
I can put a love story on the silver screen
Then put the song in the trailer, you see it in-between
The nightly news and the shows you be watchin' on the sofa
She text me, "Come over, let's play your discography"
She in disbelief just from my 2020's run
I'm the inspiration, I ain't gotta look for none
This one is goliath, big, leaped over a giant bridge
Called my counterparts, I told 'em they gotta try this shit

We holdin' leadership conferences
Ha, yeah
For the hood, for the kids
Let's win
Let's win
Let's win
Let's win

Credits Roll
Six albums, in how many years?
We havin' fun
A crazy run
Time flies
Dial the number
1-800-Nas&Hit
That's 1-800-Nas&Hit
Leave us a message
Let us know when ya'll want us back again
We'll spin the block to be there for you
Nothin' but love
Hit-boy on the boards
Your man, the maestro himself, Mr Jones
It's just natural like
That's what it gotta be
Shout the engineer, David Kim
I know we been drivin' you crazy, you like, "What? Again?
Another one, you just, when do y'all take a break?
Shoutout to Gabe, Big Double, Peter
My man Ant Saleh
Did you ever imagine?
Aye yo
Shout out to my man Big Hit, just came home
He already takin' over the whole shit, ya know
Shoutout to C3
That's third generation
You be in here goin' crazy in the studio, havin' fun watchin' cartoons
Playin' video games while we recordin', vocalin'
That's my man
Shout out Big Des and Knight
It's all about the next generation
That's what we here for
The next generation
Of course to Jung, the crew, the family
