		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Knowing you five years, going on six
Feelings that we've had always dismissed
Some just tap into it for the hell of it
But we found a way to resist
Cause it could get personal and flip
And I ain't tryna deal with all that shit
So we just keep it down on the low
And keep it at a friendship level that's it

Now I'm suppressing what's on my mind
You should bring talks to me one more time
And maybe, we'll get caught up in the moment, and
Come out the closet, you and I
Live and learn, that's what it's about
But in the back of the mind there's always some doubt
But we're alone in here and the music's blaring
Are you hearing what I'm saying? Is

I don't really want to compromise our
Our friendship, but I got a thing for you, yeah, and
And I don't really want to cross the line, but, I
I'm kinda really hoping that we do

Low-key
We be keeping it low, but to keep it real
Low-key
I've been thinking about showing you how I feel
Low-key
Baby, don't resist it's alright to be
Low-key
If the thought is there, I really think we should roll with it
Low-key
We be keeping it low, but to keep it real
Low-key
I've been thinking about showing you how I feel
Low-key
Baby, don't resist it's alright to be
Low-key
If the thought is there, I really think we should roll with it

Playing off on this creeping
Got me secretly wanting more of you
And I know you feel it too
So, tell me what's with all this hiding
Forget what they say we vibing
Outta the darkness to light and
It's been a long time coming
Only one thing stopping me ('cause you know I don't wanna)

I don't really want to compromise our
Our friendship, but I got a thing for you, yeah, and
And I don't really want to cross the line, but, I
I'm kinda really hoping that we do

Low-key
We be keeping it low, but to keep it real
Low-key
I've been thinking about showing you how I feel
Low-key
Baby, don't resist it's alright to be
Low-key
If the thought is there, I really think we should roll with it
Low-key
We be keeping it low, but to keep it real
Low-key
I've been thinking about showing you how I feel
Low-key
Baby, don't resist it's alright to be
Low-key
If the thought is there, I really think we should roll with it

I really think we should roll with it
I really think we should roll with it
I really think we should roll with it
(I think we should roll) I really think we should roll with it
Low-key, low-key, keep it low for me
Baby
