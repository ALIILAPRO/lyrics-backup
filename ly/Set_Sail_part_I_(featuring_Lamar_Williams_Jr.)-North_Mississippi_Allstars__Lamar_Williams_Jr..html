		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The water may rise
The water may rise again
But we shall set sail
We may have to move again
But we shall prevail
The water may rise again
But we shall set sail

The water may rise
The water may rise

Forefathers and mothers we never forget
Still fighting the fight, we're not giving up yet
Be it the cool moonlight, or the heat of the sun
We working together 'til the job is done
Ah yes, we working
Yes, we working

The water may rise
The water may rise

The water may rise
The water may rise again
But we shall set sail
We may have to move again
But we shall prevail
The water may rise again
But we shall set sail

The water may rise
The water may rise

We will meet in the dark
And fellowship in the light of day
We will keep on keeping on
We won't be persuaded
We won't be led astray
We won't lose our way
We won't be persuaded
We won't be led astray
We won't lose our way

There's no horizon in sight for the sailor and the sea
The ghost ship of progress sails eternity
Have to pay the price, keep our end of the deal
Sacrifice to the musical wheel within a wheel

The water may rise
The water may rise

The water may rise
The water may rise again
But we shall set sail
We may have to move again
But we shall prevail
The water may rise again
But we shall set sail

The water may rise
The water may rise
The water may rise
