		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Swimming with a Pisces every night
Ain't really that deep, but he deep inside
Head like a Scorpio
Shy like a Cancer, water all in them planets

He said, "I wanna undress you
I wanna impress you, but I ain't gon' press you
I wanna undo the things I said before"

Damn, I ain't been this wet in years
Water, water
Water, water
Water, water
Water, water

It's the way you drink it all like you're thirsty
Tie me up, pin me down, show no mercy (ah-ah)
Nibble on it, kissing it like a Hershey (muah)
You could be the boss, I'll let you work me
I'll let you finish on the tat', it says tsunami
Bust down on your future baby mommy (bust down)
Uh, fuckin' in the whip, top off (ayy)
Do a quick dick drop off (drop off)
Guess your old bitch is all talk
I ain't never seen it on soft

Goddamn, I wanna undress you
I wanna impress you, but I ain't gon' stress you
I wanna undo the things I said before

Damn, I ain't been this wet in years
Water, water (ooh, water)
Water (water), water
Water (like), water (like water)
Water (uh-huh), water

Water, water
Water, water
Water, water
Water, water
