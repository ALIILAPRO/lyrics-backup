		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She's shaking down
I'm absent and numb from shock
Reachin' around
For the hands of the clock
Sugar light

Lip me up, it's my lie
Sugar, lip me up, it's my lie
Sugar, lip me up, it's my lie
Sugar, lip me up

Cupid's trick
Comes down to shake and deal
A stupid kick
That makes me reel
Sugar light

Lip me up, it's my lie
Sugar, lip me up, it's my lie
Sugar, lip me up, it's my lie
Sugar, lip me up

She's shaking down
It's never over and done
So kick me, cave me in
I'm no one

Lip me up, it's my lie
Sugar, lip me up, it's my lie
Sugar, lip me up, it's my lie
Sugar, lip me up
