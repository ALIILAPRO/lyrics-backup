		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Get your hands off my neck, I'm trying to breathe
Peel my skin to the bone, half man and half machine
See the ashes and smoke, we black out the sky
We're born into fire, slaves 'til we die
A mouth filled with worms, a head filled with dirt
We consume and consume, it's ourselves that we hurt
We're destroying the world, pick the scab 'til it bleeds
We laugh in their face, it's the American dream

Let my sins wash over me
I'm guilty by design

We're all part of the system, we all want to be blind
We scream in defiance, we poison our minds
In this desert of silence, we'll be buried alive
We bathe in the violence one soul at a time

Torn from inside, a head filled with lies
We ache 'til we break, we see through hollowed eyes
The poison is there right under the skin
It's not complicated, they won't let us win

Let my sins wash over me
I'm guilty by design

We're all part of the system, we all want to be blind
We scream in defiance, we poison our minds
In this desert of silence, we'll be buried alive
We bathe in the violence, one soul at a time

There's blood in the alleys, there's blood in the streets
We walk on the dead, we prey on the weak
This desert of silence, we're barely alive
As we bathe in the violence, we stand on the shoulders of tyrants

Fuck

Let my sins wash over me
I'm guilty by design
Guilty by, guilty by
Guilty by design

We're all part of the system, we all want to be blind
We scream in defiance, we poison our minds
In this desert of silence (desert of silence), we'll be buried alive
We bathe in the violence (the violence), one soul at a time

We pray on the dead, we prey on the weak
There's blood in the alleys, there's blood in the streets
We pray on the dead, we prey on the weak
We're guilty by design
