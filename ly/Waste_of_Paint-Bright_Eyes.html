		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I have a friend, he's mostly made of paint
And he wakes up, drives to work and straight back home again
He once cut one of my nightmares out of paper
I thought it was beautiful, I put it on a record cover
And I tried to tell him that he had a sense
Of color and composition so magnificent
And he said, "Thank you, please, but your flattery
Is truly not becoming me
Your eyes are poor, you're blind, you see
No beautycould have come from me
I'm a waste
Of breath, of space, of time"

I knew a woman, she was dignified and true
And her love for her man was one of her many virtues
Until one day, she found out that he had lied
And she decided the rest of her life
From that point on would be a lie
But she was grateful for everything that had happened
And she was anxious for all that would come next
But then she wept, what did you expect
In that big old house with the cars she kept
And such is life, she often said
With one day leading to the next
You get a little closer to your death
Which was fine with her, she never got upset
And with all the days she may have left
She would never clean another mess 
Or fold his shirts, or look her best 
She was free
To waste away alone

Last night my brother, he got drunk and drove
And this cop, he pulled him off to the side of the road
And he said, "Officer, officer, you've got the wrong man
No, no, I'm a student of medicine
A son of a banker, you don't understand"
The cop said, "No one got hurt, you should be thankful
And your carelessness, it is something awful
And no, I can't just let you go
And though your father's name is known
Your decisions now are yours alone
You're nothing but a stepping stone on a path
To debt, to loss, to shame"

The last few months I've been living with this couple
Yeah, you know the kind who buy everything in doubles
Oh, they fit together like a puzzle
And I love their love and I am thankful
That someone actually receives the prize that was promised
By all those fairy tales that drugged us
And they still do me, I'm sick, lonely
No laurel tree, just green envy
Will my number come up eventually
Like love's some kind of lottery
Where you scratch and see what's underneath
It's sorry
Just one cherry
I'll play again, get lucky

So I've been hangin' out down by the train's depot
No, I don't ride, I just sit and watch the people there
And they remind me of wind-up cars in motion
They way they spin and turn and jockey for positions
And I want to scream out that it all is nonsense
Oh, your life's one track, can't you see it's pointless? 
But just then my knees give under me
My head feels weak and suddenly 
It's clear to see, it's not them, but me
Who's lost my self-identity
As I hide behind these books I read
While scribbling my poetry 
Like art could save a wretch like me 
With some ideal ideology
That no one could hope to achieve
And I'm never real, it's just a sketch in me 
And everything I've made is trite and cheap and a waste
Of paint
Of tape
Of time

So now I park my car down by the cathedral
Where the floodlights point up at the steeples
Choir practice was filling up with people
I can hear the sound escaping as an echo
Sloping off the ceiling at an angle
And when the voices blend they sound like angels
I hope there's some room still in the middle
But when I lift my voice up now to reach them
The range is too high way up in heaven
And so I hold my tongue, forget the song 
Tie my shoes, start walking off 
And try to just keep moving on
With my broken heart and my absent god
And I have no faith but it's all I want
To be loved
And believe
In my soul, in my soul
In my soul, in my soul
