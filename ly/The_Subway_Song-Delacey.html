		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Made me want to cry on the subway home
Made me want to die twenty feet below
Even when we're drunk we have nothing to say
So, baby what's the point when I'm back in LA?
I'm Brooklyn bound, and you're not here now

Take me home, I feel homesick
I don't know where I'm going
Too many faces, but none I know
And I'm alone on the subway home
On the subway home

I thought you'd be proud of me chasing a dream
I gave you a kiss and you let me leave
Many broken hearts are riding this train
They'll get on and off, and they'll never say
Hello, goodbye
Give me one more try

Take me home, I feel homesick
I don't know where I'm going
Too many faces, but none I know
And I'm alone on the subway home
On the subway home

Where are you now?
Are you thinking about taking that girl out that you met at the bar?
Where are you now?
Does your mom still call and ask if you're still in love anymore?
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Where are you now?

Take me home, I feel homesick
I don't know where my home is
Too many faces, but none I know
And I'm alone on the subway home
On the subway home
On the subway home
On the subway home
On the subway home
