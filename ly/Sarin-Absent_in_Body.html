		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  .a day of death in life. 
Kind at heart. 
The last to start. 
My worst fear. 
You nowhere near. 
Nothing to fear. 
Ever grateful. 
Never here. 
Heal and regress but breathe no less. 
The locusts arrive at night. 
Ever onwards. 
Towards the light. 
Like sarin sleeps in my lungs tonight. 
Flourish like gaping wounds. 
Allow no truce. 
Wage war on you. 
The world is in pain. 
Dying in vain. 
Your sons are out of line. 
But their lives give purpose to mine. 
There is nothing to see here. 
But blind rage in an empty cage. 
There is nothing to hold dear.

You prayed for night. 
Borrowed blood. 
Now beg for light. 
Shed tears in the temple. 
Face the hollow of the shrine. 
Forgive me. 
I can't hear this. 
Can't face it. 
The end of time. 
No god on earth would accept this. 
Your sons are out of line. 
This scream is mine. 
So loud. 
But no one came. 
A funeral pyre. 
Flames so high they'll burn the sky. 
The awful pain. 
Everywhere. 
On gods domain. 
The coming rain. 
I will swallow everything. 
It never ended. 
I looked down as I ascended. 
From its deathbed. 
The earth bled. 
The black-ened blood divine.  
The earth bled. 
To witness the divine. 
The ceremony reigns.
Gods domain is everything. 
The devils name is cancer. 
The holy man is dead. 
A masquerade of laughter. 
No time to catch your breath. 
In all your lies. 
A thousand eyes of snakes. 
I shaved for burial. 
Your sons are out of line. 
You are out of line.
