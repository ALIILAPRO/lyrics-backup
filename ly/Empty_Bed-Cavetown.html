		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was eight years old with a furry animal
Oh-oh
Had to say goodbye to the fuzzy little guy
Oh no

Asked my neighbors
"Would you please take care of him for me?"
Don't let him know we're goin'
Take care of him for me
Take care of him for me

I was thirteen years old with a heart made of gold
Oh-oh
Tried to make some friends almost killed myself instead
Oh no

They said the meds will
Take care of things for me
I don't think they were working
Take care of things for me
Take care of things for me

Today I felt scared
Thinking about your empty bed
Oh-oh
But I know you'll be fine
Yeah, you've got to stay alive
Oh-oh

Just don't forget to
Take care of you for me
I've been where you are goin'
Take care of you for me
Take care of you for me
