		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Wells) where's Mental?
(Wells) yeah, yeah, okay, yeah
(Tears)

Thinkin' 'bout callin' it quit's
You hate me, I don't give a shit
Each day the same
I'm just praying that soon I'll wake
Up facedown dead in a ditch
Don't fucking touch me, it hurts
Come here, you'll leave in a hearse
Multiple daggers affixed to my
Jacket, you scuff me
I'll leave you way worse

I think you suck
Want bad things to happen to you
I'd do it myself but I'm
Stuck here in the bathroom
Bleeding from these holes in my
Body that you left
When you cracked open my skull and
Then laid me down to rest

Talk to more than myself
I'm talking out from hell
Nothing you do could help
I'm fine all by myself
I'm fine, I'm barely thinking
So tired of my demons
You wanna leave? then leave then
Then leave then, oh oh
Fine, let me wither away
Just know that you won't be safe
I'm coming out where you stay
I'll kill you, lead to your face
Kill everything you love one and only above
I think we've had enough i hope I was enough

Thinkin' 'bout callin' it quit's
You hate me, I don't give a shit
Each day the same
I'm just praying that soon I'll wake
Up facedown dead in a ditch
Don't fucking touch me, it hurts
Come here, you'll leave in a hearse
Multiple daggers affixed to my
Jacket, you scuff me, i'll leave you
Thinkin' 'bout callin' it quit's
You hate me, I don't give a shit
Each day the same
I'm just praying that soon I'll wake
Up facedown dead in a ditch
Don't fucking touch me, it hurts
Come here, you'll leave in a hearse
Multiple daggers affixed to my
Jacket, you scuff me
I'll leave you way worse

I'd rather die than to spend
One moment with you i'm so fucking wired
Hope a bullet slows me down soon
Nothing in my veins but I'm batshit crazy
Nuts still, at least I'm not depressed
Swimming laps in my own blood
