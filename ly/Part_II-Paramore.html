		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What a shame, what a shame we all remain
Such fragile, broken things
A beauty half-betrayed, butterflies with punctured wings
Still there are darkened places deep in my heart
What once was blazing light now there's a tiny spark

Oh glory, come and find me
Oh glory, come and find me

Dancing all alone
To the sound of an enemy's song
I'll be lost until you find me
Fighting on my own
In a war that's already been won
I'll be lost until you come and find me here, oh glory
Here

What a mess, what a mystery we've made
Of love and other simple things
Learning to forgive
Even when it wasn't our mistake
I question every human, who won't look in my eyes
Scars left on my heart formed patterns in my mind

Oh glory, you will find me

Dancing all alone
To the sound of an enemy's song
I'll be lost until you find me
Fighting on my own
In a war that's already been won
I'll be lost until you come and find me here, oh glory

Like the moon, we borrow our light
I am nothing but a shadow in the night
So if you let me, I will catch fire
To let your glory and mercy shine
