		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can I drive you home, 
Can I crash into your life?
Can you fix my soul, 
Can you break my heart tonight?

Some angels don't cry, 
And we are, and we are, 
Just two of them, 
And we're falling through the sky.
And tonight... 

I'll get down on you, get down on you, 
Blessed kisses waiting.
I'll get down on you, get down on you, 
Foreign wishes fading.
Running till your arms drop, 
Dreams it's a point of view, 
I'll get down down down to get up on you, 
I'll get down on you, get down on you.

Can I fill you up
With my emptiness tonight?
Can I hold your hand
As we slip into the night?
Cause angels fall down, 
And we are, and we are, 
Just two damaged souls, 
But it's heaven where we lie.
And tonight... 

I'll get down on you, get down on you, 
Blessed kisses waiting.
I'll get down on you, get down on you, 
Foreign wishes fading.
Running till your arms drop, 
Dreams it's a point of view, 
I'll get down down down to get up on you, 
I'll get down on you, get down on you.

We are, we are, 
Angels, angels don't cry.
(We are, we are.)
Two souls collide, 
(We are, we are.)
Come into night.

I'll get down on you, get down on you, 
Blessed kisses waiting.
I'll get down on you, get down on you, 
Foreign wishes fading.
Running till your arms drop, 
Dreams it's a point of view, 
I'll get down down down to get up on you, 
I'll get down on you, get down on you.

Can I drive you home, 
Can I crash into your life?
Can you fix my soul, 
Can you break my heart tonight?
