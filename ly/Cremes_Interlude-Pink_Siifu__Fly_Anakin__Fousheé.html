		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't know if it's in the record store yet
But I wanna pick it up
So, what's up?

It don't feel right (it don't, it don't)
It don't feel right (ooh)
It's all in the stars
By ways of Mars
With my dark
With my dark

Always standing on
Betting on my fault
Monetary Gods
Never shoot your guards
Power
You do anything for power
Our presence with the Lords
Infiltrate our Gods
We blame it what we are
This is ours
No don't you cry no more
Had to be made 'cause the pain
Ooh whoa
Try to stay sane

Man
Aye man, I'm tryna go to this record shop, man. Call this nigga
I know these niggas there, we gotta call 'em right now, call 'em
Aight Aight, we'll call 'em right now
Ah where these niggas at though?
Come on, Pink Siifu, Fly Anakin, I know you're there
You're not doing anything, it's a record shop
You're fucking sitting there collecting dust
Ain't nobody there
Ain't nobody fucking there
These niggas too cool
And bye
