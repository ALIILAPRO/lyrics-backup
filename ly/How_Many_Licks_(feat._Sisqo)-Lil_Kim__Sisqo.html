		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hold up
So what you're saying is
(Niggas got me pissed like Lil' Kim)
You want to get freaky again? Aight
A-ooh-ah-ooh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I been a lot of places, seen a lot of faces (uh-huh)
Ah hell, I even fuck with different races
A white dude, his name was John
He had a Queen Bee Rules tattoo on his arm, uh
He asked me if I'd be his date for the prom
And he'd buy me a horse, a Porsche and a farm
Dan, my nigga from Down South
Used to like me to spank him and cum in his mouth
And Tony he was Italian (uh-huh)
And he didn't give a fuck (uh-huh)
That's what I liked about him
He ate my pussy from dark 'til the morning
Called his girl up and told her we was bonin'
Puerto Rican papi, used to be a Deacon
But now he be suckin' me off on the weekend
And this black dude, I call King Kong
He had a big ass dick and a hurricane tongue

So, how many licks does it take 'til you get to the center of the?
('Cause I've got to know)
How many licks does it take 'til you get to the center of the?
(Tell me)
How many licks does it take 'til you get to the center of the?
(Oh, oh)
How many licks does it take 'til you get to the center of the?
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

This verse goes out to my niggas in jail
Beatin' they dicks to the XXL Magazine (uh)
You like how I look in the aqua green? Get your Vaseline
Roll some weed with some tissue and close your eyes
Then imagine your tongue in between my thighs (baby, oh, yes oh)
Jailer, open up, cell block eight
All right, nigga, that's enough
Stop, look and listen, get back to your position
Kim got your dick hard, startin' fights in the yard
Hotter than a Pop Tart fresh out of the toaster
Niggas do anything for a Lil' Kim poster
Eses, Bloods, Crips, all the thugs
Up North in the hole, they all wanna know

How many licks does it take 'til you get to the center of the?
(Tell me, ha)
How many licks does it take 'til you get to the center of the?
(Tell me, oh yeah)
How many licks does it take 'til you get to the center of the?
(Oh, oh)
How many licks does it take 'til you get to the center of the?
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)

If you drivin' in the street, hold on to your seat
Niggas, grab your meat while I ride the beat
And if you see a shiny black Lamborghini fly by ya (shoom) 
That's me, the Knight Rider
Dressed in all black with the gat in the lap
Lunatics in the street, gotta keep the heat
Sixty on the bezel, a hundred on the rings
Sittin' pretty, baby, with a Cash Money bling
12 AM, I'm on my way to club
After three bottles I'll be ready to fuck
Some niggas even put me on their grocery lists
Right next to the whip cream and box of chocolates
Designer pussy, my shit come in flavors
High-class taste, niggas got to spend paper
Lick it right the first time or you gotta do it over
Like it's rehearsal for a Tootsie commercial

How many licks does it take 'til you get to the center of the?
(Still gonna try, girl, baby)
How many licks does it take 'til you get to the center of the?
(Tell me)
How many licks does it take 'til you get to the center of the?
(Oh, oh)
How many licks does it take 'til you get to the center of the?
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
How many licks does it take 'til you get to the center of the?
(Tell me)
How many licks does it take 'til you get to the center of the?
(Let me know, let me know)
How many licks does it take 'til you get to the center of the?
(Oh, oh)
How many licks does it take 'til you get to the center of the?
(Oh, oh yeah)
How many licks does it take 'til you get to the center of the?
(Yeah)
How many licks does it take 'til you get to the center of the?
How many licks does it take 'til you get to the center of the?
(Oh, oh)
How many licks does it take 'til you get to the center of the?
(Baby, tell me)
How many licks does it take 'til you get to the center of the?
(Oh, oh, oh)
How many licks does it take 'til you get to the center of the?
