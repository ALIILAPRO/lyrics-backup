		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been crying (ooh, ooh)
'Cause I'm lonely (for you)
Smiles have all turned (to tears)
But tears won't wash away the fears
That you're never ever gonna return
To ease the fire that within me burns

It keeps me crying, baby, for you
Keeps me sighin', baby, for you
So won't you hurry
Come on boy, see about me (come see about me)
See about your baby (come see about me)

I've given up my friends just (for you)
My friends are gone and you have too
No peace shall I find
Until you come back and be mine
No matter what you do or say
I'm gonna love you anyway

Keep on crying, baby, for you
I'm gonna keep sighin', baby, for you
So come on hurry
Come on and see about me (come see about me)
See about your baby (come see about me)

Sometime's up (up, ooh ooh)
Sometime's down
My life's so uncertain
With you not around
From my arms you may be out of reach
But my heart says you're here to keep

Keeps me crying, baby, for you
Keep on, keep on crying, baby, for you
So won't you hurry
Come on boy, see about me (come see about me)
See about your baby (come see about me)
You know I'm so lonely (come see about me)
I love you only (come see about me)
See about your baby (come see about me)
Hurry, hurry (come see about me)
