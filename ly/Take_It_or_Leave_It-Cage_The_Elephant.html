		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby you should know by now that I'm right, for you
But every time I step to you, you change your tune
Sweet wheel of death keeps us holding our breathe
I step to the right, you move to the left
Unless no one else
I'd rather die to myself

Oh why, won't you make up your mind?
I think I must confess
I'm starting to unwind
I been trippin' over you
So tell me something new
Take it or leave it

Maybe I should pack my things and move on?
Maybe I'm foolin' myself and you're already gone?
Watching the flames wither and fade
Trying to make sense of the look on your face
I'm down, I'm an itch
Just playin' that I can hold on

Oh why, won't you make up your mind?
I think I must confess
I'm learning to unwind
I've been trippin' over you
So tell me something new
Take it or leave it

Baby please
Oh baby please
Stay with me or cut me free
Its all of me
Oh why, wont you make up your mind?
I think I must confess
I'm starting to unwind
I been trippin' over you
So tell me something new
Take it or leave it
Take it or leave it
