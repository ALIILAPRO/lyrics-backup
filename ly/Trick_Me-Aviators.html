		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Betwixt the carnival angels
You rose from a strange hell
And entered the stage
Took souls wherever your eyes met
But you've not begun yet
The true masquerade

I've never seen an enigma such as you
Took my heart with a spell
And now I'm doomed
Stuck in trance with a wicked force exhumed

Fearless dancer veiled in dark
Paraded by your mystеry with no answer
I'm bewitched
You'vе got the moves to trick me

Like an omen of the end times
The devil's own part-time cursed paramour
What could one want with a lowlife
Brought close to the hot knife
Deep in the obscure

I've never seen an enigma such as you
Took my heart with a spell
And now I'm doomed
Stuck in trance with a wicked force exhumed

Fearless dancer veiled in dark
Paraded by your mystery with no answer
I'm bewitched
You've got the moves to trick me

You took a risk for me
I'll solve your mystery
You've made the watchers in
The background fade away
Surround me with your thorns
Show me unholy scorn
Up from a standstill to a hedonist buffet
I don't think you scare me in this place
So are you gonna dare me kick the pace
Up to a fevered tempo to embrace
The magic as we let go for a deathblow

'Cause you're a fearless dancer
Veiled in dark paraded by your mystery
With no answer i'm bewitched
You've got the moves to trick me

Fearless dancer veiled in dark
Paraded by your mystery with no answer
I'm bewitched
You've got the moves to trick me

You've got the moves to trick me
You've got the moves to trick me
