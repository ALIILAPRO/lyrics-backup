		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Love don't give no compensation, love don't pay no bills
Love don't give no indication, love just won't stand still
Love kills, drills you through your heart
Love kills, scars you from the start
It's just a living pastime, ruining your Hartline
Stays for a lifetime, won't let you go
'Cause love, love, love won't leave you alone

Love won't take no reservations, love is no square deal
Love don't give no justification, it strikes like cold steel
Love kills, drills you through your heart
Love kills, scars you from the start
It's just a living pastime, burning your lifeline
Gives you a hard time won't let you go
'Cause love, love, love won't leave you alone
'Cause love, love, love won't leave you alone

Love can play with your emotions
Open invitation to your heart
Love can Play with your emotions
Open invitation to your heart (love kills)
Love can play with your emotions
Open invitation to your heart
Love kills, love kills, love love, love, love

Love kills, drills you through your heart
Love kills, scars you from the start
It's just a living pastime, ruining your lifeline
Won't let you go
Love kills, hey, drills you through your heart
Love kills, tears you right apart
It won't let go, it won't let go
Love kills, yeah
