		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't really, uh, play the guitar very well, um, or sing
So you know, apologies

Stunning 8K-resolution meditation app
In honor of the revolution, it's half-off at the Gap
Deadpool's self-awareness, loving parents, harmless fun
The backlash to the backlash to the thing that's just begun

There it is again, that funny feeling
That funny feeling
There it is again, that funny feeling
That funny feeling

The surgeon general's pop-up shop, Robert Iger's face
Discount Etsy agitprop, Bugles' take on race
Female Colonel Sanders, easy answers, civil war
The whole world at your fingertips, the ocean at your door
The live-action Lion King, the Pepsi Halftime Show
Twenty-thousand years of this, seven more to go
Carpool Karaoke, Steve Aoki, Logan Paul
A gift shop at the gun range, a mass shooting at the mall

There it is again, that funny feeling
That funny feeling
There it is again, that funny feeling
That funny feeling

Reading Pornhub's terms of service, going for a drive
And obeying all the traffic laws in Grand Theft Auto V
Full agoraphobic, losing focus, cover blown
A book on getting better hand-delivered by a drone
Total disassociation, fully out your mind
Googling "derealization", hating what you find
That unapparent summer air in early fall
The quiet comprehending of the ending of it all

There it is again, that funny feeling
That funny feeling
There it is again, that funny feeling
That funny feeling

Hey, what can you say? We were overdue
But it'll be over soon, you wait
Hey, what can you say? We were overdue
But it'll be over soon, just wait 
Ba-da-da, ba-da-da, ba-da-da-da-dum
Hey, what can you say? We were overdue
But it'll be over soon, you wait
Ba-da-da, ba-da-da, ba-da-da-da-dum
Hey, what can you say? We were overdue
But it'll be over soon, you wait
Ba-da-da, ba-da-da, ba-da
Hey, what can you say? We were overdue
But it'll be over soon, you wait
Ba-da-da, ba-da-da, ba-da-da-da-dum
Hey
