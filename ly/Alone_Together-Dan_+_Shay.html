		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I couldn't help but notice 
You were sitting by yourself
Dropping limes in a Corona 
Like you're trying to get over somebody else
It's funny how your story sounds a little like mine
Oh, cause' I've been at a table 
With a bottle peeling labels to pass the time

We can be blue as a neon light
Singing them sad up songs all night
We can say goodbye, just head home
But, if we're going to be alone

We should be alone together
Kissing over there in the corner 
Where nobody else can see
Keeping each other company
We should be alone together
Leaning up against my car door 
Parked outside on the street
Where it's just you and me
We should be alone together

I couldn't help but notice 
You could use another drink
Yeah, I don't wanna leave ya
And it's two for one Tequila so what you think?

We can be blue as a neon light
Singing them sad up songs all night
We can say goodbye, just head home
But, if we're going to be alone

We should be alone together
Kissing over there in the corner 
Where nobody else can see
Keeping each other company
We should be alone together
Leaning up against my car door 
Parked outside on the street
Where it's just you and me
We should be alone together
We should be alone together
We should be alone together, oh yeah

We should be alone together
Over there in the corner 
Where nobody else can see

We should be alone together
Kissing over there in the corner
Where nobody else can see
Keeping each other company
We should be alone together
Leaning up against my car door
Parked outside on the street
Where it's just you and me
We should be alone together
We should be alone together
We should be alone together, oh yeah
We should be alone together
