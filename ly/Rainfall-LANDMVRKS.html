		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  BORN TO FALL
But I'll find a way, I aint giving up
I'VE BEEN SO WRONG
Got a pain in my chest I'm gonna lose control

It's just a rainfall, but it feels like storm.
Cause every night, I see the devil in a different form

Can't you see all the damage you've done?

Give me a break
I don't feel anything
I know you feel the same.
Because you're the one who broke me.

Take a look at my face
I don't need to pretend...
You can see my body shaking, too.
I'm not gonna fake it.

No, I'm not gonna fake it.

I take a deep breath until my head
Stops spinning and starts again

Everyday is a waste of time
It's too late I've got hatred for everyone

Following every trace of you
I can't see your face but I see right through you.

BORN TO FALL
But I'll find a way, I ain't giving up
I'VE BEEN SO WRONG
Got a pain in my chest I'm gonna lose control

I see the rainfall!

You're just the devil in a different form

WATCH ME SCRATCH MY SKIN
Until I find out what's underneath.

I see the devil in you

And I've been stuck beneath the surface
Echoes of this pain, Hit me hard again.

Don't wake me up until the rain stops.
Until it fades away
Nothing will ever stop this fire
This life has taken a wrong turn.
