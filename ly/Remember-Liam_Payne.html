		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How do you love someone?
How do you love someone so much it makes you hate them?
Because you can't replace 'em
Why do I still hold on?
Why do I still hold on to feelings when they're wasted?
Maybe I misplaced them, mm

I still can't see the light at the end of the tunnel
Just see those hometown lights we were both playing under
Wish I could press reset, but it's not that easy
How can I forget someone who gave me so much to remember?

You gave me so much to remember
You got me stuck inside my mind
Everything's a reminder
How can I forget someone who gave me so much to remember?

How do you know someone so well and then it changes?
All of a sudden you're strangers
Thinkin' back on us dancing
When you put your feet on top of mine on the living room floor
Well, tell me what was it for? Oh

I still can't see the light at the end of the tunnel
Just see those hometown lights we were both playing under
Wish I could press reset, but it's not that easy
How can I forget someone who gave me so much to remember?

You gave me so much to remember
You got me stuck inside my mind
Everything's a reminder
How can I forget someone who gave me so much to remember?

I just wanna know, just wanna know do you still
Think about us, think about us and get chills?
I could say I won't, could say I won't, but I will
How can I forget someone who gave me so much to remember?

You gave me so much to remember
You got me stuck inside my mind
Everything's a reminder
How can I forget someone who gave me so much to remember?
You gave me so much to remember (all of the nights, all of the time)
You got me stuck inside my mind
Everything's a reminder (everything)
How can I forget someone who gave me so much to remember?

I just wanna know, just wanna know, do you still
Think about us, think about us and get chills?
I could say I won't, could say I won't, but I will
How can I forget someone who gave me so much to remember?
