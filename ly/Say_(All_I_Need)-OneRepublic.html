		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do you know where your heart is
Do you think you can find it
Did you trade it for something, somewhere
Better just to have it

Do you know where your love is
Do you think that you lost it
You felt it so strong but nothings
Turned out how you want it

Well bless my soul
You're a lonely soul
Cause you wont let go
Of anything you hold

Well all I need is the air I breathe
And a place to rest my head

Do you know what your fate is
And are you trying to shake it
You're doing your best and
You're best look
You're praying that you'll make it

Well bless my soul
You're a lonely soul
Cause you wont let go
Of anything you hold

Well all I need is the air I breathe
And a place to rest my head
Said all I need is the air I breathe
And a place to rest my head
Do you think you can find it
Do you think you can find it
Do you think you can find it
Better than you have it
Do you think you can find it
Do you think you can find it
Do you think you can find it
Better than you have it
Better than you have it

Said all I need is the air I breathe
And a place to rest my head
Said all I need is the air I breathe
And a place to rest my head

Do you know where the end is
Do you think you can see it
Until you get there
Go on
Go ahead and scream it
Just say?
