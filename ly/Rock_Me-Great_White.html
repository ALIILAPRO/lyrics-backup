		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sweet little baby, 
You don't have to go
Little baby
Tell me you won't go
We'd be so good together if we had the time
Bein' alone's a nowhere state of mind
Lovin' ain't no crime, oh no
I see your man ain't here
He don't care
The way of the night has gone
We'll move on
Got to find a way
To face another day

I search the world
For someone I'll never find
Someone who ain't
The hurtin' kind
If you stay the night
We'll make the wrong seem right
So come on now

Rock me
Rock me
Roll me through the night

Rock me
Rock me
Roll me through the night

Rock me
Rock me
Roll me through the night

We'll burn in love tonight

Sweet little baby
Oh don't you go
You ain't so innocent, I know
I know your heart's like mine, oh yeah
And I will find the time
To make you mine
And if your love goes bad
If it makes you sad
I'll be back for more
At your door

Rock me
Rock me
Roll me through the night

Rock me
Rock me
Roll me through the night

Rock me
Rock me
Roll me through the night

Before the mornin' light
We'll burn with love tonight

And when your man don't care
I will be there
Still be lovin' real good love

So baby now

Rock me
Rock me
Roll me through the night

Rock me
Rock me
Roll me through the night

Rock me
Rock me
Roll me through the night

There is no wrong or right
We'll burn with love

Rock me
Rock me
Roll me through the night

Rock me
Rock me
Roll me through the night

Rock me
Rock me
Roll me through the night

There is nothing left to do
But make sweet love to you

Come on and Rock me
