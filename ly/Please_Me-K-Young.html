		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I, I , I've been missing you all week
I, I , I've been missing you all week

My, my moon is so complete

I, I , I've been missing you all week
I, I , I've been missing you all week

My, my moon is so complete

I got a light on a my mind
I got to get where I 'm supposed to be
I think I'm running out of time
My baby, girls ain't for me
She said
Don't you worry about a thing
Tonight
I'm (gon')a ease your pain
Tonight
Once she gives her head on me
I know I'll be feeling alright
So I am on my way
Girl what you've got
What I want
And I can't wait
So I am on my way

Tell

Girl you've got
What I need
And I've seen your face
You know what's up
Baby, I am on my way

I've been missing you all week

I know, you know
How to please me

Is so unique

You know what to do
To please me

Tonight I hit the door
Hot girl's already in the mood,
Yeah,
She doesn't have to say a word
She just stands there in the door
She said, baby, am I hurt you
Tonight, just relax,
Let me work you
Tonight
The way she put her thing on me
I was so ready to take flight
And I wasn't ready
You have got
No, I wasn't ready to porn
And I can't wait,
Can't wait
So I'm on my way
I am on my way
You have got
What I need
Girl you've got
And I've seen your face
What I need
Baby, I'm on my way ?
My moon is so complete
I know, you know
How to please me

You know what to do
To please me

You're my undercover lover
Nobody knows what we do
We got to keep this sound ?
Because if they knew about us
It would probably crowd around us
With our business in the streets
Let's keep this bit between you and me

You know, she got class,, a big oh-ass
I loose my mind, every time she walks pass
My voice talks stress
May be saying

Behind closed doors

Did you know, I produced this crap
I get major respect from American asses
I go to California
And I make my way back

It's a bossmo world
It's the bosses here
I'm taking over here
It's the bosses

My name is Mike Jones
From Paris to Rom, but Hamburg is phony

I've been missing you all week

I know, you know
How to please me

Is so unique

You know what to do
To please me

I, I , I've been missing you all week

All week Baby

My, my moon is so complete

I, I , I've been missing you all week

My, my moon is so complete
