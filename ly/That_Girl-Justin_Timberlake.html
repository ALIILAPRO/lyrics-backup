		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hi, how ya'll feeling tonight?
Thank ya'll for coming out to the wise underground club
Our first act up
All the way from Memphis, Tennesse
Show him some southern love
JT and the Tennessee Kids
Come on! Give it up!

Thank you for having us out tonight
We're JT and the Tennessee Kids

Mmm, yeah yeah yeah
Think I'm in love with you

Didn't have to run, I knew it was love from a mile away
But I had to catch you, running through my mind all day baby
They all say I'm crazy, cause anybody even when your father say
That I can't be with you, I don't hear what they say

Cause I'm in love with that girl
So don't be mad at me
Cause I'm in love with that girl
So don't be mad at me
So what you're from the other side of the tracks
So what if the world don't think we match
I'll put it down like my love's on wax, guess what
I'm in love with that girl
And she told me, she's in love with me

Now we didn't have to fall, but fell in love to the bottom babe
No one's there to catch us when we fell from heaven that day
People always staring, but I don't care nothing about it babe
Since I saw your face, I've been staring just the same

I'm in love with that girl
So don't be mad at me
Cause I'm in love with that girl
So don't be mad at me
So what you're from the other side of the tracks
So what if the world don't think we match
I'll put it down like my love's on wax, guess what
I'm in love with that girl
And she told me, she's in love with me

My pretty lady
You'll always be my baby, baby, baby
It's so amazing
How you became my baby, baby, baby
My little daisy
Come here let me rock you like a baby, baby, baby
Pretty lady
Don't you know, you'll always be my baby, baby, baby

Now don't it seem like these days
That everybody's got something to say
But I don't pay attention to the talk baby
And I don't really care if they stop and stare
Because they see my number one
My number one girl

I told you I'm in love with that girl
So don't be mad at me
I'm in love with that girl
So don't be mad at me
I don't care
So what you're from the other side of the tracks
So what if the world don't think we match
I'll put it down like my love's on wax, guess what
I'm in love with that girl
She already told me, that she's in love with me

I'm in love, I'm in love with that girl
I don't care what people say, people say
Cause I'm in love with that girl
