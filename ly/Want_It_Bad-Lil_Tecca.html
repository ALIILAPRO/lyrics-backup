		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Dystinkt Beats)

She said it's over, I ain't need her
I just hope she sober, I ain't seen her
You was tryna show love, I ain't see ya
Nowadays, we gettin' more bucks, gettin' cleaner
I ain't even get my top fly on the meter
Tried to tell 'em we was top five, ain't believe us
I ain't ever tried to do the most to make 'em see us
I ain't ever tried to slow it down, to let 'em keep up

She runnin' back, she want it too
She hit me up like, "Baby, yeah, I got you"
She want it bad, I want it too
She hit me up like, "Baby, yeah, I want you"
No, I ain't mad, I play it smooth
I run it up 'cause everyday I got to
Let me see how long all them bands will last you
They gon' see it's real when we roll past you

It ain't really shit, cut 'em off (yeah, yeah)
We don't really miss when we ball out, yeah
They gon' copy that, copy this (yeah, yeah)
If I'm going out, I'm going all out (yeah)
Ain't thinking 'bout' tomorrow, I ain't promised that
I just got a call and I ain't callin' back
Told me that my problem was I'm too laid back
Could've said I'm mad, because you ain't mad

She said it's over, I ain't need her
I just hope she sober, I ain't seen her
You was tryna show love, I ain't see ya
Nowadays, we gettin' more bucks, gettin' cleaner
I ain't even get my top fly on the meter
Tried to tell 'em we was top five, ain't believe us
I ain't ever tried to do the most to make 'em see us
I ain't ever tried to slow it down to let 'em keep up

She runnin' back, she want it too
She hit me up like, "Baby, yeah, I got you"
She want it bad, I want it too
She hit me up like, "Baby, yeah, I want you"
No, I ain't mad, I play it smooth
I run it up 'cause everyday I got to
Let me see how long all them bands will last you
They gon' see it's real when we roll past you

She runnin' back, she want it too
She hit me up like, "Baby, yeah, I got you"
She want it bad, I want it too
She hit me up like, "Baby, yeah, I want you"
She runnin' back, she want it too
She hit me up like, "Baby, yeah, I got you"
She want it bad, I want it too
She hit me up like, "Baby, yeah, I want you"
