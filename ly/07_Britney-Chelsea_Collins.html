		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I'm gonna break down
I'ma break down pretty
Yeah, I love myself but I hate this city
Oh, why?
I'm running out of crazy
Are you entertained yet?

Drown myself in champagne tears
Yeah, I know too much at 19 years
They took my soul as a souvenir
But the show goes on
Beach blonde hair on the bathroom floor
'Cause I don't wanna be her no more
But they keep banging on the hotel door
So the show goes on

If I'm gonna break down
I'ma break down pretty
Yeah, I love myself but I hate this city
Oh, why?
I'm running out of crazy
Are you entertained yet?
If I'm gonna break down
I'ma break down pretty
Yeah, all eyes on me like I'm 07 Britney
Oh, why?
I'm running out of crazy
Are you entertained yet?

Take what's left of my confidence
And I hold it high even though I'm spending
Surrounded by people building me up
10,000 feet, just to watch me fall off
You're damned if you do
You're damned if you don't
You're damned if you will
You're damned if you won't
But the show goes on

If I'm gonna break down
I'ma break down pretty
Yeah, I love myself but I hate this city
Oh, why?
I'm running out of crazy
Are you entertained yet?
If I'm gonna break down
I'ma break down pretty
Yeah, all eyes on me like I'm 07 Britney
Oh, why?
I'm running out of crazy
Are you entertained yet?

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

If I'm gonna break down
I'ma break down pretty
Make the Hall of Shame
Are you coming with me?
Oh, why?
I'm running out of crazy
Are you entertained yet? (Haha)

If I'm gonna break down
I'ma break down pretty
Yeah, I love myself but I hate this city
Oh, why?
I'm running out of crazy
Are you entertained yet?
If I'm gonna break down
I'ma break down pretty
Yeah, all eyes on me like I'm 07 Britney
Oh, why?
I'm running out of crazy
Are you entertained yet?

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh (he show goes on)
