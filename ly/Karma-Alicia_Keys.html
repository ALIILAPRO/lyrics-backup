		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Weren't you the one that said
That you don't want me anymore
And how you need your space
And give the keys back to your door
And how I cried and tried
And tried to make you stay with me
But still you said the love was gone
And that I had to leave

(Now you) talkin' bout a family
(Now you) sayin' I complete your dream, ooh
(Now you) sayin' I'm your everything
You're confusing me, what you say to me
Don't play with me, don't play with me, 'cause

(What goes around, comes around)
(What goes up, must come down)
Now who's cryin', desirin' to come back to me
(What goes around, comes around)
(What goes up, must come down)
Now who's cryin', desirin' to come back

I remember when I was sittin' home alone
Waiting for you 'til three o'clock in the morn'

And when you came home
You'd always have some sorry excuse
Half explaining to me
Like I'm just some kind of a fool
I sacrificed the things I want
Just to do things for you
But when it's time to do for me
You never come through

(Now you) wanna be up under me, ayy
(Now you) have so much to say to me, hey
(Now you) wanna make time for me
What you do to me, you're confusing me
Don't play with me, don't play with me, 'cause

(What goes around, comes around)
(What goes up, must come down)
Now who's cryin', desirin' to come back to me
(What goes around, comes around
What goes up, must come down)
Now who's cryin', desirin' to come back

I remember when I was sittin' home alone
Waiting for you 'til three o'clock in the morn'
Night after night, knowing somethin' goin' on
Wasn't long before I be g-g-gone
Lord knows it wasn't easy, believe me
Never thought you'd be the one that would deceive me
And never do what you supposed to do
No need to approach me boo, 'cause I'm over you

(What goes around, comes around)
(What goes up, must come down)
Now who's cryin', desirin' to come back to me
(What goes around, comes around
What goes up, must come down)
Gotta stop cryin', to come back to me

(What goes around, comes around
What goes up, must come down)
It's called Karma baby and it goes around
(What goes around, comes around) around
(What goes up, must come down)
Now who's cryin', desirin' to come back to me
