		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  He whispered in my ear
And he pulled me oh so close
He covered up my face
He said I wanna let you know
Don't let the sun kiss you before I do
You know the sun sets every evening
But I'll never leave you
Yeah don't let the sun kiss you before I do
Yeah the sun sets every evening
But I'll never leave you
You say I'm not the jealous kind
But I'd like to be your favorite wine
That's with you when you feel alone at night
I'd like to be your lullaby
The white noise you hear when you close your eyes
The sun on your lips just don't feel right (Don't feel right)
Don't let the sun kiss you before I do
Yeah the sun sets every evening
But I'll never leave you
Oh don't let the sun kiss you before I do
Yeah the sun sets every evening
But I'll never leave you
You're like the rain in the morning the way you clear all my worries
You're like the drugs I'm prescribed, I need to be with you daily
A silver lining the sky
A holiday in my mind
A reason for me to try
You're like the moon, I'm the tide
I'm far away but you're pulling
Gravity's losing its mind
The way you lift all my feelings
Can't find the words to describe
But with you everything's right
Don't let the sun kiss you before I do
Yeah the sun sets every evening
But I'll never leave you
Oh don't let the sun kiss you before I do
Yeah the sun sets every evening
But I'll never leave you
