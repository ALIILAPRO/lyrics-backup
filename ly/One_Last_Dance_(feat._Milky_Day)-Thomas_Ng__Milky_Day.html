		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't know what our day is like tomorrow
But I feel like you're packing away to leave
To somewhere far from me
Yeah, yeah, yeah

And I'm scared that you'll find somebody better
Just your type and without the anxiety
'Cause how could I compete?

Do you mind
If we dance?
Follow me, feel the beat
Take my hand
For one last dance
For one last dance

Sleepless nights, pointless fights just end with heartache
You know I try, so don't know why you'd rather walk away
I'm begging you to stay (stay with me)

And I know you just need some more love and attention
For you, I shall give you my all
So, baby, take my hand I'll take you for a dance

So do you mind
If we dance?
Follow me, feel the beat
Take my hand
For one last dance
For one last dance

If you left and move on would act like never met?
Would it hurt less if we just forget?

So would you mind (would you mind)
If we dance? (If we dance)
Follow me, feel the beat
Take my hand
For one last dance
For one last dance

So would you mind
If we danced?
Follow me, feel the beat
Take my hand
For one last dance (one last dance)
One last dance, yeah, yeah, yeah
One last dance, oh

Thank you
