		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey

Seen nothing like that shorty with the fat back movin' to the vibes (vibes)
Say, I'm just up in my habitat, play a little Ratatat
Kick it with my tribe (right)
I'm sayin' it's a known fact, show 'em, nigga, no ask
Sucker fall in line (yeah)
I'm 'bout to get mine, whoa, whoa, niggas seein' me shine, bright
Catch me baked outside, wanderin' daily, why, why?
Would you let me get behind? Baby, just close your eyes (eyes)
You see we takin' off, leave the stress, no time (bye)
This ain't televised, see I'm her surprise, I

Ooh-ooh, ooh, that vibe
Ooh-ooh, ooh, that vibe
Ooh-ooh, I need those fuckin' vibes
Doo-doo-doo-doo, and we ragin' 'til daylight
Things are getting gnarly, got my whiskey by my side
Soarin' through my world and I'm 'bout to take a dive
This is a just a sadness in me, sad times
Just another evening and I'm leanin', oh (let's get it)

Ready, go, set, we won't hold you neither (uh)
Salute when you see that nigga (yeah)
Tell 'em, "Go off," when you see him, greet him (mmh)
Talkin' shit, fuck ya, legend of the cold one nice
This my life, all my nights
Walkin' like a disco ball, all this ice, aye

(Ayy, ayy, ayy)
This the story (ayy)
(Ayy, ayy, ayy, woo)
Of a man (ayy)
(Ayy, ayy, ayy, woo)
And you know it (ayy)
(Ayy, ayy, ayy, boom, boom)

Catch the show
Slightly paranoid, can't believe 'em simply (yeah)
Nah, bullshit, miss me (nah, nah)
Call it what it is then, lies
This my fantasy high, sayin' goodbye (hmm)
I lay at night, it intensifies
