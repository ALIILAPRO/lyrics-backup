		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
Yeah

Hunt you like a savage, savage
That turns all to ashes, ashes
The things that I imagine, imagine
Like taking my hands off the wheel
And I drive myself crazy

And just because I'm laughing, laughing
Don't mean that I ain't havin', havin'
These dark thoughts
These dark thoughts
Come put 'em in a box
And check me off
With these dark thoughts
These dark thoughts

You could call it madness, madness
I got dirty habits, habits
The things that I imagine, imagine
Like it overthinkin' 'bout you with someone else
Yeah, I go crazy

And just because I'm laughing, laughing
Don't mean that I ain't havin', havin'
These dark thoughts
These dark thoughts
Come put 'em in a box
And check me off
With these dark thoughts
These dark thoughts

Oh
Even when I'm up, yeah I'm feeling down
The devil in my ear, I can hear him now
Oh
Even when I'm up, yeah I'm feeling down
I'm walking on a cloud, but I'm hell-bound

These dark thoughts
Come put 'em in a box
And check me off
With these dark thoughts
These dark thoughts
These dark thoughts

These dark thoughts

Oh
Even when I'm up, yeah I'm feeling down
The devil in my ear, I can hear him now
Oh
Even when I'm up, yeah I'm feeling down
I'm walking on a cloud, but I'm hell-bound
Yeah

These dark thoughts
These dark thoughts
