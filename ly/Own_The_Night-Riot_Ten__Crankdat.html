		  What's up brother, alright let me see if I can explain this a little bit better

You know we own the night
Hit me with the dirty bass and I’m ready to bite

You know we own the night
Hit me with the dirty bass and I’m ready to bite

Cuz you know we own the night
Cuz you know we own the night
Cuz you know we own the night
Cuz you know we own the night
Come and get some of this
Break it down

Cuz you know we own the night
Got a handful of hoes sipping dirty sprite 
Gotta flex on the beat when I'm on the mic

Cuz you know we own the night
Cuz you know we own the night
Cuz you know we own the night
Cuz you know we own the night
Come and get some of this
Get some of this

Cuz you know we own the night
Got a handful of hoes sipping dirty sprite 
Gotta flex on the beat when I'm on the mic

You know we own the night
Hit me with the dirty bass and I’m ready to bite

Yeah, you know we own the night
Hit me with the dirty bass and I’m ready to bite
Hit me with the dirty bass and I’m ready to bite

Cuz you know we own the night
Cuz you know we own the night
Cuz you know we own the night
Cuz you know we own the night
Come and get some of this

You know we own the night
Got a handful of hoes sipping dirty sprite 
Gotta flex on the beat when I'm on the mic

Alright so my, my sound, like the long, the long growl sound as soon as the drop hit, right is the werrrrr
And then your new sound is like the bachooooo
