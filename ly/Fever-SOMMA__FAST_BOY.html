		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Something inside me is killing me slow
Why don't you come over? I need you to know
Turn me up, yeah, yeah
You turn me up, hmm-mm

And I show you places that you've never seen
I need you tonight like the air that I breathe
I can't get enough, baby
And I don't wanna stop, mm-mm

Don't you know I'm lonely?
Oh, you know that you can own me
Oh, just control me
Don't you know that you control me?

'Cause I'm addicted to your love
And I get sick without your touch
You give me fever, I can't stop
You're like my drug, you're like my drug

'Cause I'm addicted to your love
And I get sick without your touch
You give me fever, I can't stop
You're like my drug, you're like my drug

You've got me shaking, you're stuck in my bones
And I try to scream but I don't make no sound
Turn me up, baby
You turn me up, mm-mm

You spin in my head with your every move
I'm lost in your eyes and the things that you do
I can't get enough, baby
And I don't wanna stop, mm-mm

Don't you know I'm lonely?
Oh, you know that you can own me
Oh, just control me
Don't you know that you control me?

'Cause I'm addicted to your love (addicted to your love)
And I get sick without your touch
You give me fever, I can't stop
You're like my drug (my drug), you're like my drug (my drug)

'Cause I'm addicted to your love (ah)
And I get sick without your touch
You give me fever, I can't stop (ah)
You're like my drug (my drug), you're like my drug (my drug)

'Cause I'm addicted to your love
