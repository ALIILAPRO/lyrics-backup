		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You know everybody's seen
The way you've waged this war against me
You thought that you'd be free
Looking back you lost what you need

These walls that you've built up
You knew, they'd all come collapsing
Around you

And I know
The suffering, it feeds away at your soul

The poison seeping deep within
You drink it down but it comes up again
The lie takes a hold onto
Don't know where it ends or begins with you

And I know
The suffering keeps feeding away at your soul
And it grows
This pain you feel will be the only thing left you know

It's all changing
It's all infecting
It's all collapsing

And it grows
This pain that you feel
The only place left to go
'Cause I know
The suffering keeps feeding away at your soul
Where it grows
The pain you feel will be the only thing left when you go
