		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Is this place where I belong?
Lately I've been thinkin' on the last train home
That all my dreams have come and gone
Is this fate, a twisted game
'Cause I've been tradin' high for heart
For high for life that means nothing
I won't live and die
Under these same skies

So don't stay, just turn away
And leave all these worn out streets and broken homes
Suburban dreams are all we've known
Go, it's all the same
Maybe we should find a place where no one knows our name
And we can start again
Oh, oh
And we can start again
Oh, oh

All these things, I haven't done
I just wanna steal a heart and fall in love
Watch it fall apart and stitch it up
It's been the same old story
Since we were young
We'd spend our nights
Tryin' to chase the sun
It might take some time
To change the tides
But I'd walk for miles

So don't stay, just turn away
And leave all these worn out streets and broken homes
Suburban dreams are all we've known
Go, it's all the same
Maybe we should find a place where no one knows our name
So we can start again
Oh
So we can start again
Oh
So we can start again
Oh
Start again
Oh

So we can start again
So we can start again
So we can start again
So we can start again
Can we start again
