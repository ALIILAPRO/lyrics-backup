		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  As the cheerless towns pass my window
I can see a washed out moon through the fog
And then a voice inside my head breaks the analogue
And says

"Follow me down to the valley below
You know
Moonlight is bleeding from out of your soul"

I survived against the will of my twisted folk
But in the deafness of my world the silence broke
And said

"Follow me down to the valley below
You know
Moonlight is bleeding from out of your soul
Follow me down to the valley below
You know
Moonlight is bleeding from out of your soul"

My David don't you worry
This cold world is not for you
So rest your head upon me
I have strength to carry you

(Ghosts of the twenties rising)
(Golden summers just holding you)

Follow me down to the valley below
(Follow me follow me down)
You know
Moonlight is bleeding from out of your soul
Follow me down to the valley below
(Follow me follow me down)
You know
Moonlight is bleeding from out of your soul

Come to us
Lazarus
It's time 
For you to go
