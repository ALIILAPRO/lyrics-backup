		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She knows she's powerful
She's got your time in her hands
She moves so incredible
And everybody stares when she starts to dance

She's a real good girl
'Til the sun goes down on her night
Got her lipstick on
And she's singing that song
'Cause she really wants a piece of that life

She's got the tricks
She's got the hits
Sees her name in the lights
Heard it before
She's out the door
Can't waste any more time

Say goodnight
Angel eyes
You could be
Out of time
I'm out, out, out of time

Check the number, write the name down on the wall
She found heaven at the club in the bathroom stall
Two more minutes, three more hours 'til she lose it all
Got no one left to call

No one notices, makeup runs from her eyes
She walks in, "Oh goddamn," he could get it tonight
She hates herself, but if they all love her then she don't mind
Better hurry up, I'm out out out of time

Say goodnight
Angel eyes
You could be
Out of time
I'm out, out, out of time

Better say goodnight, better say goodnight
Feels like you could die in the city lights
Better say goodnight, kiss it all goodbye

Say goodnight
Angel eyes
You could be
Out of time
I'm out out out of time

Better say goodnight
I'm out, out, out of time

Say goodnight
Angel eyes
You could be (you're under pressure, baby)
Out of time (ooh, out, out, out, of time)
Say goodnight (ooh, baby)
Angel eyes
You could be (you could be there, baby)
Out of time
Out, out, out of time
