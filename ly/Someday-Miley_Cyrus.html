		  Someday, someday, someday, oh
Someday, someday, someday, oh
Someday, someday, someday, oh
Someday, someday, someday

No boy, don't call me feisty
I worked too hard for this, oh oh oh
No boy, No boy
Can find me easy to resist
But you boy, you boy
I know somewhere you exist
Yeah, I'm gonna find you
Someday, Someday
(someday, someday,someday, someday)

I ain't gonna find you running in Rome
Ain't gonna find you staying at home
Ain't gonna find you on the dance floor
Ain't gonna find you there for sure
I'm gonna find you
If I keep living, someday
(someday, someday, someday, someday)

Hey world, are you listening? (listening)
I got so much to say
I know it is a small world, small world
But sometimes I can't find my way (my way)
And I know, I know oh
It could happen any day
Just around the corner (just around the corner)
I'm gonna find you, someday
(someday, someday, someday, someday)

I ain't gonna find you running in Rome
Ain't gonna find you staying at home
Ain't gonna find you on the dance floor
Ain't gonna find you there for sure
I'm gonna find you
If I keep living, someday
(someday, someday, someday, someday)

Oh oh, I'm gonna find you
I'm gonna find you
(someday, someday, someday, someday)

I ain't gonna find you running in Rome
Ain't gonna find you staying at home
Ain't gonna find you on the dance floor
Ain't gonna find you there for sure
I'm gonna find you
If I keep living, someday
(someday, someday, someday, someday)

I know I'm gonna find you, someday
I'm gonna find you, someday
(someday, someday, someday, someday)
