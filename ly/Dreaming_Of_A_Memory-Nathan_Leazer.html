		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been fighting these memories
Re-living a dream of a life
Meaning nothing to me
I Can't keep hoping for a love that's broken
When the devil is holding the key
All these years gone by
Not a tear left to cry
I just wanted to believe
Every moment with you I spent
Came to a bitter end
Now you're just a memory
Holding on to you
Knowing you don't belong with me
That's the cold and honest truth
But it won't steal my destiny
Cause' I know that I've been down
Beaten up and drug around
The place that I call home
Just isn't for me
I'm packing my bag
Of loneliness and sad
I'm heading down the road to fulfill this dream
Smoking my fears away
Another high
Another day
When will I escape from this prison I've built
This anxiety inside of me
Creates a home of vacancy
In my mind I try to find a reason to heal
Holding on to you
Knowing you don't belong with me
That's the cold and honest truth
But it won't steal my destiny
Cause' I know that I've been down
Beaten up and drug around
The place that I call home
Just isn't for me
I'm packing my bag
Of loneliness and sad
I'm heading down the road to fulfill this dream
Holding on to you
Knowing you don't belong with me
That's the cold and honest truth
But it won't steal my destiny
Cause' I know that I've been down
Beaten up and drug around
The place that I call home
Just isn't for me
I'm packing my bag
Of loneliness and sad
I'm heading down the road to fulfill this dream
