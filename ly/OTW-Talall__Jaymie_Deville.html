		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm on the way
Know where you stay
Right off the plane
Straight to your place
Everything fades
When I see your face
I know you need it
Sleep, fuck, repeat it
You say you love me, girl
But you don't mean it, no
And that's alright
Cuz' I don't either
No need to lie
I'm not your keeper, girl
You can call me when he's gone
Christian Louboutin
Red bottoms on your feet
While I hit it raw
Anything you want, I can do it all
Girl I do you right, while you do him wrong
I'll take the blame baby, I don't care
It's all a game, I don't play it fair
I'm on the way
I'm on the way yeah
I'll be on the way, on the way
I know you been waiting all night long
I'll be on the way, on the way
Baby I been waiting for so long
I'll be on the way, on the way
I don't wanna wait wanna wait no
I'll be on the way, on the way
I don't wanna wait no more
She got a foreign name
She do whatever I say
She be trying to change my ways
But she know I can't stay
Got too much money to make
Got two girls, other ones waiting
But I need you whenever I'm faded
Oh, oh
Another rendezvous
Let's take it to the room
She feels so familiar
But this ain't Deja vu
Lipstick stains
Valium in my veins
Won't heal my pain
But you can try to baby, oh
I'll be on the way, on the way
I know you been waiting all night long
I'll be on the way, on the way
Baby I been waiting for so long
I'll be on the way, on the way
I don't wanna wait wanna wait no
I'll be on the way, on the way
I don't wanna wait no more
I don't trust you anyways
Girl you're the type to stay away from
But I don't listen to my brain
I think I want you in my system
I'll be on the way, on the way
I know you been waiting all night long
I'll be on the way, on the way
Baby I been waiting for so long
I'll be on the way, on the way
I don't wanna wait wanna wait no
I'll be on the way, on the way
I don't wanna wait no more
