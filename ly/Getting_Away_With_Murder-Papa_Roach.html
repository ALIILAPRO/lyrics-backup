		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Somewhere beyond happiness and sadness
I need to calculate
What creates my own madness
And I'm addicted to your punishments
And you're the master
And I am waiting for disaster

I feel irrational
So confrontational
To tell the truth I am 
Getting away with murder
It is impossible
To never tell the truth
But the reality is 
I'm getting away with murder
(Getting away, getting away, getting away)

I drink my drink and I don't even want to
I think my thoughts when I don't even need to
I never look back 'cause I don't even want to
And I don't need to
Because I'm getting away with murder

I feel irrational
So confrontational
To tell the truth I am 
Getting away with murder
It is impossible
To never tell the truth
But the reality is 
I'm getting away with murder
(Getting away, getting away, getting away, getting away)
(Getting away, getting away, getting away, getting away, getting away with murder)

Somewhere beyond happiness and sadness
I need to calculate
What creates my own madness
And I'm addicted to your punishments
And you're the master 
And I'm craving this disaster

I feel irrational
So confrontational
To tell the truth I am 
Getting away with murder
It is impossible
To never tell the truth
But the reality is 
I'm getting away with murder
(Getting away, getting away, getting away)

I feel irrational
So confrontational
To tell the truth I am 
Getting away with murder
It is impossible
To never tell the truth
But the reality is 
I'm getting away with murder
