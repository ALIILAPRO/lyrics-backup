		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's comin' on Christmas
They're cuttin' down trees
They're puttin' up reindeer
And singin' songs of joy and peace
Oh, I wish I had a river I could skate away on
But it don't snow here
It stays pretty green
I'm gonna make a lot of money
Then I'm gonna quit this crazy scene
Oh, I wish I had a river I could skate away on

I wish I had a river so long
I would teach my feet to fly
Oh, I wish I had a river I could skate away on
I made my baby cry

He tried hard to help me
You know, he put me at ease
And he loved me so naughty
Made me so weak in the knees
Oh, I wish I had a river I could skate away on
I'm so hard to handle
I'm selfish and I'm sad
Now I've gone and lost the best baby
That I ever had
Oh, I wish I had a river I could skate away on

Oh, I wish I had a river so long
I would teach my feet to fly
I wish I had a river I could skate away on
I made my baby say goodbye

It's comin' on Christmas
They're cuttin' down trees
They're puttin' up reindeer
And singin' songs of joy and peace
Oh, I wish I had a river I could skate away on
