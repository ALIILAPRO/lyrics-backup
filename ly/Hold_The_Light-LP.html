		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's a tired drumbeat in my chest
I left all the ones I loved the best
Loneliness was stripping off her dress
But that's alright

I was getting used to cutting ties
And rubbing out your crayon drawing eyes
Said you didn't wanna stay the night
But that's alright (but that's alright)

When it gets colder, it's alright
We're lonely soldiers in the deep dark night
I wanted to know you
I wanted to fight
Don't have to be over
Oh-oh-oh, just hold the light
Hold the light
Oh-oh-oh, just hold the light
Hold the light
Ooh-ooh-ooh

A comedy is crying in my head
Sinking while I'm filling up with dread
Try sometimes to save you from my bed
'Cause I'm a lie

I'm terrified you've seen my fake machine
'Cause skin is only fleeting velveteen
Bouncing on the stormiest of seas
'Til morning light

When it gets colder, it's alright
We're lonely soldiers in the deep dark night
I wanted to know you
I wanted to fight
Don't have to be over
Oh-oh-oh, just hold the light
Hold the light
Oh-oh-oh, just hold the light
Hold the light (hold the light)

When it gets colder, it's alright
We're lonely soldiers in the deep dark night
I wanted to know you
I wanted to fight
Don't have to be over
Oh-oh-oh, just hold the light (hold the light)
Hold the light
Oh-oh-oh, just hold the light (hold the light)
Hold the light
