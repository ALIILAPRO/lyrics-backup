		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  (M-M-M-Murda)

I had a Benz when you had a bike
Uh, all this cocaine got me actin' white
You could ask Jada Pinkett, nigga, I'm a legend
You could ask Chrissy Teigen, ask John Legend

She say I got a vanilla aftertaste
Cut his face, let him use his blood for his aftershave
Harrell Park, it ain't nothin' like South Park
Pistol whip you 'til you know the serial number by heart
Sit the chop on top your nose, if you sneeze, I squeeze
Got them extra extendos, call them Eazy-Es
Uzi, .223s, Tecs, semi-automatic, reflex
Bullet ain't got no name, but these no names ain't got no respect
Put some respect on my name, don't know where I got that from
Mad scientist in this bitch, don't even know what I'm mad for
Whoo, 'cause it's hard to ignore the bullshit when it can't flush
Whoo, tryna Donald Duck, but you can't duck, nigga, blaow

Stunt, stunt, real deal
Had the MAC-11, real, real
Had to send your ass, the real deal
Had to send your ass, the real deal
I had to line 'em up, line 'em up
You niggas quack me up
Daffy, Donald Duck
Stunt, stunt, real deal
Had the MAC-11, real, real
Had to send your ass the real deal
Had to send your ass the real deal
I had to line 'em up, I'm anonymous
You niggas quack me up, brah
You better Donald Duck

Gas 'em up, I'ma fire 'em up
Yeah, pack 'em up, I'ma pile 'em up
Yeah, line 'em up, yeah, sign 'em up
Yeah, line 'em up, I'm anonymous
Leave out the bitch, comin' back with the dogs
I'm comin' back with the dogs
Go at my neck, I come back at your skull
I'm comin' back with her drawers
Come back with the bag, the package and all
Yeah, I put the stash in the wall
30-round dick, I'm jackin' it off, yeah
To eighty more jacks in the cards
Aces and Kings, blackest of hearts
I played the hands I was taught
Family man, your family involved, damn
Family tree, branches gon' fall
Actin' an ass, no actin' at all, no
All of the cameras is off
You fucked up the deal, look back at the mall
We dunk on 'em back at the forum

I had a Benz when you had a bike
Uh, all this cocaine got me actin' white
Ask Jada Pinkett, I'm a legend
You could ask Chrissy Teigen, ask John Legend

Stunt, stunt, real deal
Had the MAC-11, real, real
Had to send your ass the real deal
Had to send your ass the real deal
I had to line 'em up, yeah, sign 'em up
These niggas quack me up
Better Donald Duck

Line 'em up, sign 'em up
I'ma grind 'em up, I'ma fire 'em up
Smoke, smoke (gas 'em up), smoke, smoke (pile 'em up)
Smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke
Huh, huh
Line 'em up, yeah, blaow
Smoke, Donald Duck
I see you backin' up
You better Donald Duck
You niggas quack me up
You better Donald Duck, blaow, blaow
Line 'em up, you better Donald Duck
Gas 'em up, and I'ma fire 'em up, yeah
Pack 'em up, and I'ma pile 'em up
Smoke, Funeral
