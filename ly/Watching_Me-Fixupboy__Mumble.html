		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It gets hard to look out of my window
I feel like your watching me
I fell inside her trap
She ain't going to let me leave
It gets hard to look out of my window
I feel like your watching me
Baby your watching me
Baby please stop watching me
Can you please stop watching me
Your watching me
Bae I know your watching me
Baby please stop watching me
I won't talk to you
I don't want to talk to you right now
Girl you got me upside down
I get this feeling when your around
When your around
When your around
When your around
Baby call me when your all alone
Cause darling I don't want to be waiting for you all night long
Take back what you said on the phone
We go way back did it all on our own
It's a one way ticket to death
Another fall out girl your causing me stress
Girl I don't believe it you did this shit again
Now I'm picking up the pieces I'm calling on you
When and got the benz out that shit be swerving
Now we got to pretend now that shit be hurting me
That shit happened so suddenly
I think I find it hard to breath now
You swept me off my feet now
It gets hard to look out of my window
I feel like your watching me
I fell inside her trap
She ain't going to let me leave
It gets hard to look out of my window
I feel like your watching me
Baby your watching me
Baby please stop watching me
Can you please stop watching me
Your watching me
Bae I know your watching me
Baby please stop watching me
I won't talk to you
Baby call me when your all alone
Cause darling I don't want to be waiting for you all night long
Take back what you said on the phone
We go way back did it all on our own
I don't wanna talk to you
Right now right now right now
I don't wanna talk to you
Talk to you
