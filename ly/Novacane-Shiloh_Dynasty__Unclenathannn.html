		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Something isn't right with us
(Look ask yourself in every relationship you're in what's the cost for being in this relationship, and you'll see real Quick whether it's worth the price or whether it's not)
I've been losing the attention
You don't listen, you've been givin', you've been spending all your time out there lying
(Does this relationship bring me energy or drain my energy most of the time) 
Poison in my brain, novacane 
You're like novacane, novacane
Something isn't right with us
I've been losing the attention
You don't listen, you've been givin', you've been spending all your time out there lying 
Poison in my brain, novacane
Poison in my brain, novacane
You're like novacane, novacane
Something isn't right with us
I've been losing the attention
You don't listen, you've been givin', you've been spending all your time out there lying 
Poison in my brain, novacane
Poison in my brain, novacane
You're like novacane, novacane
Something isn't right with us
I've been losing the attention
You don't listen, you've been givin', you've been spending all your time out there lying
