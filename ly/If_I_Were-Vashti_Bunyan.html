		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I were to go away
Would you follow me /to ends of the earth
To show me what /Your love is worth
Or would you go and buy a car
Shrug your shoulders /Say there you are
She didn't love me /anyway
If she had /she would have stayed

If I were to go away
Would I always look /for your beautiful face
In every crowd /every place
Or would I turn /and buy a hat
Turn my shoulders /say that is that
He didn't love me /now its clear
If he had /he would be here
