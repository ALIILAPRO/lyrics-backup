		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'ma tell y'all niggas like this shit right
Its 2003 my nigga
All that yappin at the mouth shit my nigga, ah
Man niggas ain't with that shit my nigga
I don't play that shit no more man
As soon as a nigga start talking that shit
Man, you on the floor son

Yeah
Yeah 
Yeah

Watch a nigga get sword on, for talking that shit 
Watch a bitch get rode on, for talking that shit 
Watch that nigga get laid out, for talking that shit
Watch them bitches get drugged out, for talking that shit
You don't want none nigga you don't want none
You don't want none bitch you don't want none
You don't want none nigga you don't want none
You don't want none bitch you don't want none

You don't like me, yeah
I don't like you, yeah
You want to fight me, yeah
I want to fight you, yeah
Put your hands up, nigga
Put your hands up, bitch
Put your hands up, hoe
Put your hands up, trick
Fuck these rental cars
They don't run shit
Who run this shit
We run this bitch

Put your hands up, nigga
Put your hands up, bitch
Put your hands up, hoe
Put your hands, trick
My back ain't dead, yeah
My lip ain't swoll, yeah
My head ain't bust, yeah
My nuts ain't grey, yeah
Put your hands up nigga
Put your hands up bitch
Put your hands up hoe
Put your hands up trick

I'm from a small town called woop a niggas ass
And I mean well woop a nigga ass
I mean well beat a bitch to death
And I mean well came all the way there
Taka nigga down a dirt path to a junk yard where it stankin' at, aha
Put his ass in a plastic bag, but just a home where you blast him at
I'm talkin' bout
Tie it up with a shoe string, and a picture hook stuck in the thang
Layin' on empty cans and recylin' bags with some bitchass gatorade
I own a switchblade
Well cut butter to put in tha damn microwave
Better get you a sharpener baby, 'cause that thang only gonna get me aggrivated
You look hard
But you really soft, you cotton soft
You try to make me mad, mad
But you just piss me off, you piss me off
Shit I ain't scared of you nigga
And I ain't scared of them hoes
And I definitely ain't scared of that tank t-shirt ass nigga thankin he swoe

Watch a nigga get sword on, for talking that shit
Watch a bitch get rode on, for talking that shit
Watch that nigga get laid out, for talking that shit
Watch them bitches get drugged out, for talking that shit
You don't want none nigga you don't want none
You don't want none bitch you don't want none
You don't want none nigga you don't want none
You don't want none bitch you don't want none

[petey pablo:]
Swear to god motherfucker we be slayin em up 
Have one of these niggas, I tear him up ....have women eatin niggas
Havin him sayin that country boy was bad as fuck
Came hit him with a heater, ain't have to bust
Take the bullets from a gun nigga, add them up
Put them right back in it before I put it up ?
I'm saying this game ain't changing much
Still the same motherfuckers used to sell the drugs 
Them same ones
That used to come to the club see a nigga leave a nigga in a thang of blood
In a car with a browd when the police come 
Gone...before they find out what the hell itwas fo
Dead wrong, you don't hear me tho ?
But it ain't nothing that nigga ain't done before
It ain't nothing thata nigga won't try again
But are'member, that suckas already killed a man ?
Gone craig, gone craig
Still froggin and go ahead and leap but when you jump over here, jump over here
Try and remember what the fuck I said, 'cause I mean
[lil john:]
Watch a nigga get sword on, for talking that shit 
Watch a bitch get rode on, for talking that shit 
Watch that nigga get laid out, for talking that shit
Watch them bitches get drugged out, for talking that shit
You don't want none nigga you don't want none
You don't want none bitch you don't want none
You don't want none nigga you don't want none
You don't want none bitch you don't want none
