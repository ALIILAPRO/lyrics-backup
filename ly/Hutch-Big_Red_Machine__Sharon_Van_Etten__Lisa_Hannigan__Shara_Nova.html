		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You were alive
And you were unafraid
Of how much the world could take from you
So how did you lose your way?
And what can you tell me now?
How are you these days?
I want to know everything
How hard are times out there?
These are the things
That I wish I could've said to you

So I can relate
With the action of need to erase me
I know you weren't faking or making it up
How did it get that bad?
Did you even hesitate?
You go out so far to escape
To try and replace your fate, so you say
There's no need to contemplate
Like we all end up dead anyway
And there are no remedies ready
But I swear there are many
But I swear there are many
And if I could, I would pick you back up to the top
