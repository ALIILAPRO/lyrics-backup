		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They came for him one winter's night
Arrested, he was bound
They said there'd been a robbery
His pistol had been found

They marched him to the station house
He waited for the dawn
And as they led him to the dock
He knew that he'd been wronged
"You stand accused of robbery"
He heard the bailiff say
He knew without an alibi
Tomorrow's light would mourn his freedom

Over the hills and far away
For ten long years he'll count the days
Over the mountains and the seas
A prisoner's life for him there'll be

He knew that it would cost him dear
But yet he dare not say
Where he had been that fateful night
A secret it must stay
He had to fight back tears of rage
His heart beat like a drum
For with the wife of his best friend
He spent his final night of freedom

Over the hills and far away
He swears he will return one day
Far from the mountains and the seas
Back in her arms is where he'll be
Over the hills and far away

Over the hills and
Over the hills and
Over the hills and far away

Each night within his prison cell
He looks out through the bars
He reads the letters that she wrote
One day he'll know the taste of freedom

Over the hills and far away
She prays he will return one day
As sure as the rivers reach the seas
Back in his arms he swear she'll be

Over the hills and far away
He swears he will return one day
Far from the mountains and the seas
Back in her arms is where he'll be

Over the hills and far away
She prays he will return one day
As sure as the rivers reach the seas
Back in his arms is where she'll be

Over the hills (over the hills)
Over the hills and far away

Over the hills (over the hills)
Over the hills and far away
