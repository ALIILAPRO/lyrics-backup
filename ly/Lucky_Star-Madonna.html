		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You must be my lucky star
'Cause you shine on me wherever you are
I just think of you and I start to glow
And I need your light
And baby, you know

Starlight, star bright, first star I see tonight
Starlight, (star bright) make everything alright
Starlight, star bright, first star I see tonight
Starlight, (star bright) yeah

You must be my lucky star
'Cause you make the darkness seem so far
And when I'm lost, you'll be my guide
I just turn around and you're by my side

Starlight, star bright, first star I see tonight
Starlight, (star bright) make everything alright
Starlight, star bright, first star I see tonight
Starlight, (star bright) yeah

Come on, shine your heavenly body tonight
'Cause I know you're gonna make everything alright
Mmm, come on, shine your heavenly body tonight
'Cause I know you're gonna make everything alright

You may be my lucky star
But I'm the luckiest by far
You may be my lucky star
But I'm the luckiest by far

Starlight, star bright, first star I see tonight
Starlight, (star bright) make everything alright
Starlight, star bright, first star I see tonight
Starlight, (star bright) ooh yeah

Come on, shine your heavenly body tonight
'Cause I know you're gonna make everything alright
Come on, shine your heavenly body tonight
'Cause I know you're gonna make everything alright

You may be my lucky star
I'm the luckiest by far
You may be my lucky star
I'm the luckiest by far

(You may be my lucky star) you may be my lucky star
(But I'm the luckiest by far) what you do to me, baby?
(You may be my lucky star) you know 
(But I'm the luckiest by far) I'm the luckiest by far

Starlight, star bright, first star I see tonight
Starlight, (star bright) make everything alright
Starlight, star bright, first star I see tonight
Starlight (star bright)

Starlight, star bright, you make everything alright
What you do to me, baby
You better stay by my side tonight

Starlight, star bright
Starlight, star bright
Starlight, star bright
Starlight, star bright

Starlight, star bright, baby
Starlight, star bright
Stay by my side tonight
What you do to me, baby
What you do, what you do to me, baby
Stay by my side tonight
You may be my lucky star
