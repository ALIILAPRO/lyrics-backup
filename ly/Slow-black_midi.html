		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Time winding down
Slowly
Slowly

Just one more try
Slowly
Slowly

I'm almost on my way
Cracking, snapping, little footsteps
Beaks all break

Slowly
Slowly

Searching
Still searching
Slowly it falls and slowly it dies
Slowly it crumbles right under my eyes
And takes so long

And I wonder
Just how long it took
To get there
To get there
I guess I'll wait

How much longer?
Any day
How much further
Must I wake?
I guess I'll wait

I guess I'll wait

I guess I'll wait
I guess I'll wait

Slowly falls, and slowly dies
Slowly crumbles right under my eyes
Slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly
Slowly

Stood up, shot
Between the eyes
Just consolation

Slowly
Slowly
Slowly
Slowly
Slowly
Slowly
Slowly
Slowly
Slowly
Slowly
