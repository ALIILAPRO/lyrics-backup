		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been a man of brutal means
Dealing out my business, it's so obscene
I'm not crossed, just recognized
As the son of a bitch that pulled it right between your eyes
An unexploded ordinance
Variate the deviance
A Glasgow Kiss or a Molotov
I'm about to blow it all
Countless, broken by the horror
A heroes end is still the end
My kind won't be seen again
Let the right one in
Ya gotta go with the devil you know
It's a goddamn sin
Ya gotta go with the devil you know
I'm ready, ready to begin
You bastard
Let the right one in
Ya gotta go with the devil that you know
What goes around comes around
And what comes around is gonna get beat down
I don't let anything go to waste after the cold reveal of my murder face
Another right that I made wrong
Another place I don't belong
Of all the thing I said that stick
Nothing good can ever come of this
Countless, broken by the horror
A heroes end is still the end
My kind won't be seen again
And if ya don't know, now you know
Let the right one in
Ya gotta go with the devil you know
It's a goddamn sin
Ya gotta go with the devil you know
I'm ready, ready to begin
You bastard
Let the right one in
Ya gotta go with the devil that you know
It's just the devil in me
There's no hypocrisy
What you see is what you see
What you get is what you get
It's just the devil in me
There's no hypocrisy
What you see is what you see
What you get is what you get
Let the right one in
It's a goddamn sin
I'm ready, ready to begin
Let the right one in
Let the right one in
Ya gotta go with the devil you know
It's a goddamn sin
Ya gotta go with the devil you know
I'm ready, ready to begin
You bastard
Let the right one in
Ya gotta go, yagotta go
Let the right one in
Ya gotta go with the devil you know
It's a goddamn sin
Ya gotta go with the devil you know
I'm ready, I'm ready
You bastard
Let the right one in
Ya gotta go with the devil that you know
