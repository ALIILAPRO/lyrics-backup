		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I were a minstrel, I'd sing you six love songs
To tell all the world, of the love that we share
If I were a merchant, I'd bring you six diamonds
With six blood red roses, for my love to wear
But I am a simple man, a poor common farmer
So take these six ribbons, to tie back your hair

Yellow and brown, blue as the sky
Red as my blood, green as your eye

If I were a nobleman, I'd bring you six carriages 
With six snow white horses, to take you anywhere 
If I were the emperor (yellow and brown)
I'd build you six palaces (blue as the sky)
With six hundred servants (red as my blood) 
For comforting fare (green as your eyes)
But I am a simple man, a poor common farmer
So take these six ribbons, to tie back your hair

If I were a minstrel, I'd sing you six love songs
To tell all the world, of the love that we share
So be not afraid my love, you're never alone love
While you wear my ribbons, tyin' back your hair
Once I was a simple man, a poor common farmer
I gave you six ribbons, to tie back your hair

Tooralee, tooralie, all I can share
Is only six ribbons, to tie back your hair
Tooralee, tooralie, all I can share
I gave you six ribbons, to tie back your hair
