		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I left a mark on your neck
I know that you won't forget
Yeah, I know, yeah, I know, I'm the best you've ever had
Yeah 'cause I'm sweet like that
Yeah, you know, yeah, you know
Playing with my fingertips
Sitting there biting your lip
Trying to kiss, who are you trying to trick?
Why don't you just cut the shit?

'Cause baby, you know that you got it
Girl, yeah, you know that you want it
Girl, why can't you just be honest?
With yourself

I know every day you're thinking of me (thinking of me)
I make it better when you're feeling lonely (feeling lonely)
You say that no one will understand
You wish you could but you just can't so
How many days, how many nights
'Til you realize he'll never love you like me?
He'll never love you like me

Talking until 3 A.M
Giving me that look again
Yeah, I know, yeah, I know, I'm the drug you never did
Higher than you've ever been
Yeah, you know, yeah, you know
Took me like I was a hit
Addicted but trying to quit
Get over it
Act like you already did
So thirsty, you're drowning in it

'Cause baby, you know that you got it
Girl, yeah, you know that you want it
Girl, why can't you just be honest?
With yourself

I know every day you're thinking of me (thinking of me)
I make it better when you're feeling lonely (feeling lonely)
You say that no one will understand
You wish you could but you just can't so
How many days, how many nights
'Til you realize he'll never love you like me?
He'll never love you like me
'Cause he'll never love you like me
He'll never, never, never, never, never, never (ya boy)
He'll never, never, never, never, never, never (ya boy)

Hold on, you tell me that I'm not the one but
You know what is right, you say is wrong
Playing with my fingertips
Sitting there biting your lip
Trying to kiss, who are you trying to trick?
Why don't you just cut the shit?

'Cause he'll never love you like me
He'll never, never, never, never, never, never
He'll never love you like me
He'll never, never, never, never, never, never
'Cause he'll never love you like me
He'll never, never, never, never, never, never
He'll never love you like me
He'll never, never, never, never, never, never

I know every day you're thinking of me
I make it better when you're feeling lonely
You say that no one will understand
You wish you could but you just can't so
How many days, how many nights
'Til you realize he'll never love you like me?
