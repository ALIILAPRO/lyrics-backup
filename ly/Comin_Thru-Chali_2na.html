		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Welcome to Terrordome
I am your host
the friendly neighborhood baritone.
Vocals channel
the Spirit of old poets.
I don't drink. My glass never
will hold MoÃ«t
Similar to Paul Laurence Dunbar
From the crew you thought was just all chorus and one star
I'm one sixth
of a click that run shit
while commercial counterparts are in constant conflict I'm...

Comin Thru 2Day

A lot of details.
On my body be scales.
I am from Ida B Wells.
Middle seat feeling good times since like 11
With a widows peak
militant mind like Michael Evans.
Every posse recline
and watch me get applause. Pouring reservoirs
on your Desert Shores.
You're witnessing mental
and verbal fitness friend.
Tunafish a descendent
from Lake Michigan.

Comin Thru 2Day

You got work to do
Chali 2-N-A
Bringing it straight to you
Comin Thru 2Day
You can't pass it by
Chali 2-N-A
Coming straight from Chi!

All day when I say that
I am much more
than just some backpack crap, intelligent rap act
or militant black cat
I'm
Killing you venomous
platinum plaque Macks
By forever spitting
Relevant facts
and that's that
Ain't how you play the game, it's how the game plays you.
Way true, cadence is wild style like Phase 2
Touring without rest and blessed
My skull's laced
wit titanium plates
that pass metal detection
YES!
Instant vintage.
Deep in the trenches.
Every sentence can leave speakers defenseless.
Peeking through fences
And speaking
Bleeker than Memphis
Keeping your interest
with heat seeking intentions

Comin Thru 2Day

You got work to do
Chali 2-N-A
Bringing it straight to you
Comin Thru 2Day
You can't pass it by
Chali 2-N-A
Coming straight from Chi!

Comin Thru 2Day

I'm from the city where they buried AL Capone,
House music was born,
Robert Kelly performed, and heavy styles were shown
I made Hidjra
and settled miles from home
Coast to coast. LA from Chicago
Witty Apostle
spitting this gritty gospel
The ghetto diplomat
apocalyptic rap
I'm gifted
come to grips with that fact
(Hey wait a minute)
You're learning while the turn tables turning. People should know me more than for just the verbal Herman monster
