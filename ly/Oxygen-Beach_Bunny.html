		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Back me out of this mess, I can't help from
Constantly hiding all the feelings I'm finding within
Word's out on the carpet and everybody's watching me
Wait for the pitfall, hit my face on a brick wall

They don't wanna see you the way I do
But life looks better through my worldview
Suddenly, everything is easy
I've never felt something so deeply

'Cause with you, with you, I breathe again
Baby, you're my oxygen
Oh, oh, oh

Help me out of this place, I'm stuck inside a wave
Of confusion over what's the solution with my life
Mostly, I'm okay with having a few bad days
Locked in my bedroom with my heart out on display

But they don't wanna view you the way I do
And life looks better when it's with you
Suddenly, everything is easy
I've never felt something so deeply

'Cause with you, with you, I breathe again
Baby, you're my oxygen
Oh, oh, oh

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

Suddenly, everything is easy
I've never felt something so deeply
'Cause with you, with you, I breathe again
Baby, you're my oxygen
Oh, baby, you're my oxygen
Oh, oh, oh
