I beg you babe, I beg you babe
I beg you baby kick it to the left now
If you wanna eat it no pressure
I only do Range, no Tesla
Balmain drippin', umbrella
I'm tryna love you like a gangsta
Baby would you answer?
I give you love, make her give it to you faster
'Cause you're fuckin' with a gangsta

Oh my days
I'm tryna give it to you, come my way
You know I'm a bad girl, I show you my ways
Send the location, I'll put it in Waze
Forever, forever (forever)
I want you my Genna (my Genna)
I'm like "Hey, you know" (hey, you know)
Aye you're looking kinda nice you know (nice you know)
Got me feeling your vibe you know (vibe you know)
Baby don't be shy you know
I'm like "Hey, you know" (hey, you know)
Aye you're looking kinda nice you know (nice you know)
Got me feeling your vibe you know (vibe you know)
Baby don't be shy you know

You see my dark shades on like I can't see you (they know I'm an anti yute)
Used to have the all black Range tinted windows (now I'm in the AMG Coupe)
Gyal take control
Whine up your waist in your two piece
Saw bae but I'm choosy
Na na naiii
Look at the face that's beauty
Baby your waist is cutie
Darling I'm getting money, I'm a hustler
Rolling with me, you go prosper
I'll be your sponsor, tell me what you want love
No more Indomie, now it's steak & lobster
Oh na na na na, na na
Love you like a king but I'll fuck you like a mobster
Oh na na na na
No she will never let go nah
'Cause I got that special love

I beg you babe, I beg you babe
I beg you baby kick it to the left now
If you wanna eat it no pressure

Balmain drippin, umbrella
