		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was dreaming of the past
And my heart was beating fast
I began to lose control
I began to lose control
I didn't mean to hurt you 
I'm sorry that I made you cry
I didn't mean to hurt you 
I'm just a jealous guy

I was feeling insecure, you might not love me anymore
I was shivering inside
Oh I was shivering inside

I didn't mean to hurt you 
I'm sorry that I made you cry
I didn't want to hurt you 
I'm just a jealous guy

I was trying to catch your eye
I thought that you was trying to hide
I was swallowing my pain
Oh I was swallowing my pain

I didn't mean to hurt you
I'm sorry that I made you cry
I didn't want to hurt you 
I'm just a jealous guy
