		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh 

Days we were young
We took photographs of everything we could see
We knew we were
Impervious no matter how we'd bleed
We never fought for breath
Priest and prophetess
We were nothing we would defy

Invincible skin
It's how we all begin

Oh oh 
Awake, awake
This is a dream state
Oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh though we were wide awake
This is a dream state
Oh oh though we were wide awake
This is a dream state

Will we survive in this, our new wilderness?
We have nothing on our feet
We had to run from it
Priest and prophetess
We were nothing we would deny

Invisible skin
Where is the world within?
Invincible skin
It's how we all begin

Oh oh 
Awake, awake
Oh oh this is a dream state
Oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh
This is a dream state
Oh oh though we were wide awake

Out of the dark day, into the brighter night
Out of the dark day, into the brighter night
Out of the dark day, into the brighter night
Out of the dark day, into the brighter night
Out of the dark day, into the brighter night

How do we feel? (oh oh oh)
How do we feel in that photograph
And how do we feel it again?
How do we feel? (oh oh oh)
How do we feel in that photograph
And how do we feel it again?

Days we were young
We took photographs of everything we could be
