		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You will never love me
Cause you don't even know my name
Living in deceit 
All I know is nothing ever lasts forever
So come on down and I'll see you in hell
She's come 'round with a combination
Locking out the world for none to see
A cold heart with an invitation
To the never ending fantasy
She'll make you feel a little satisfaction 
Closing all the doors keeping you asleep
I fell in love with her isolation 
Waiting for her words calling up to say
"Hello, it's me
You want it all
Come now, take me"
You will never love me
Cause you don't even know my name
Living in deceit 
All I know is nothing ever lasts forever
So come on down and I'll see you in hell
Ridden of your spell
Eliminate my final demons when I'm dreaming 
I'm waking up into the other side
She'll lure you into another temptation
Look into her soul what do you see?
Eyes fit for illumination
Lighting up the room with her LEDs
She'll lock you up in a simulation
Play another game of hide and seek
It was a lie and I cannot deny
That you would never love me
Cause you don't even know my name
Living in deceit
All I know is nothing ever lasts forever
So come on down and I'll see you in hell
Ridden of your spell
Eliminate my final demons when I'm dreaming 
I'm waking up into the other side 
Come and turn me on
Come and turn me on
Come and turn me on
Come and turn me
"Hello, it's me
You want it all
Come now, take me"
You will never love me
Cause you don't even know my name
Living in deceit
All I know is nothing ever lasts forever
So come on down and I'll see you in hell
Ridden of your spell
Eliminate my final demons when I'm dreaming 
I'm waking up into the other side
Fight my demons when I'm dreaming
I'm waking up into the other side
