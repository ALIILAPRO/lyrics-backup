		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You take great pride in never having lived up to anything 
Lie, steal, cheat and kill, a real bad guy 
Your daddy is a wino and you mommy's quite insane 
From altar boy to sewer rat, you don't give a damn 
You're sister is a junkie, gets "it" any way she can 
Your brother's a gay singer in a stud leather band 
Your girlfriend's got herpes to go with your Hep and AIDS 
There ain't one person you know you ain't ripped off yet 
Look deep in the mirror, look deep into its eye 
Your face is replaced, as creature you despise 
But I know what you're made of, it ain't much I'm afraid 
I know you'll be lying until your dying day 
Make up your stories, the truth's so hard to say 
Brain is numb and your tongue will surely dig your grave 
Your mind is sickly from Alzheimer's disease 
And decadence and debauchery killed your memories 
You're a liar, liar, liar, everyone can see 
Liar, liar, it's all you'll ever be 
Liar, liar, liar, it's what you mean to me 
Liar, liar, lies... 
Start trouble, spread pain 
Piss and venom in your veins 
Talk nasty, breathe fire 
Smell rotten, you're a liar 
Sweat liquor, breathe snot 
Eat garbage, spit blood 
Diseased, health hazard 
Scum bag, filthy bastard 
Greasy face, teeth decay 
Hair matted, drunk all day 
Absessed, sunken veins 
Rot gut, scrambled brain 
Steal money, crash cars 
Rob jewelry, hock guitars 
Rot in Hell, it's time you know 
To your master, off you go 
You're a liar, a fucking liar! 
Filthy liar, liar! 
You fucking liar, liar!
