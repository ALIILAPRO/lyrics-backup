		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ay-ay-ay-ay
Ay-ay-ay-ay

You, ooh
You, ooh

You nurture me, ay
Losing touch with you, ain't nothing worse than that
You would finish my sentence, connect the words for me
Red-eye to tokyo, I took that personally, you're on
Your selection
Playing them songs for my affection
You don't mind to fuck my intellection
You always keep me in your selection

That's my shorty, that's my rider, my selecta
You, you
That's my shorty, that's my rider, my selecta
You, you
That's my shorty, that's my ride
(Now my selecta)

I select you
Oh, make me make my imprint on you
I select you
Oh, make me make my imprint on you

Dj, pull up the tune, burn up the room, straight to the moon again
Primadonna, pre me
Act like a fool and me and you breaking the rules again
Could never see you as just a friend
Would you take your time?
I put the key inside
And put the p in drive
Dnd replied
But I looked you in your eye
My reminder, my selecta

You, you (selecta, selecta)
That's my shorty, that's my rider, my selecta
You, you
That's my shorty, that's my ride
(Now my selecta)

I select you
Oh, make me make my imprint on you
I select you
Oh, make me make my
(Now my selecta)

Ay-ay-ay-ay
Ay-ay-ay-ay
Ay-ay-ay-ay
Ay-ay-ay-ay

I select you
Oh, make me make my imprint on you
I select you
That's my shorty, that's my rider, my selecta
You, ooh
That's my shorty, that's my rider, my selecta
