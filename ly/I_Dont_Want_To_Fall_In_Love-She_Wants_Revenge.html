		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I would like to tell you
I would like to say
That I knew that this would happen
That things would go this way

But I cannot deceive you
This was never planned
I know that you're the right girl
But do you think that I am the right man?

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7

Right face wrong time, she's sweet
(But I don't wanna fall in love)
Too late, so deep, better run 'cause
(I don't wanna fall in love)
Can't sleep, can't eat, can't think straight
(I don't wanna)

You say it's not a problem
You say it's meant to be
But love is not an option
Our love is never free

And things are not so easy
So cold and we've been burned
I know that I'll have regrets
But that's the price of one more lesson learned

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7

Right face wrong time, she's sweet
(But I don't wanna fall in love)
Too late, so deep, better run 'cause
(I don't wanna fall in love)

Right face wrong time, she's sweet
(But I don't wanna fall in love)
Can't sleep, can't eat, can't think straight
(I don't wanna)

Right face wrong time, she's sweet
(But I don't wanna fall in love)
Too late, so deep, better run 'cause
(I don't wanna fall in love)

Right face wrong time, she's sweet
(But I don't wanna fall in love)
Can't sleep, can't eat, can't think straight
(I don't wanna fall in love)

Right face wrong time, she's sweet
(But I don't wanna fall in love)
Too late, so deep, better run 'cause
(I don't wanna fall in love)

Right face wrong time, she's sweet
(But I don't wanna fall in love)
Can't sleep, can't eat, can't think straight
(I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna)
