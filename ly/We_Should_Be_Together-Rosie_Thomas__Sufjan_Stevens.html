		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Man, why did I let you
Leave me alone in summer
I should have known by fall
I'd finally finish your sweater
And now it’s lying here on my bed
At night I wrap the arms around my waist
Pretend it’s you instead
And cry into the shoulder

We’ve pulled this thread for so long
To let it come undone now i still believe
We still belong someway somehow so

I’ll be home for Christmas time
(Whatever the weather)
You be home for Christmas too
(Wе should be together)

Man why did I lеt my feet get cold and bitter
Too scared insecure
Unsure if you were unsure
The pieces wouldn’t fit
Not a tight enough knit for us
To make it through the winter

We’ve pulled this thread for so long
To let it come undone now i still believe
We still belong someway somehow so

I’ll be home for Christmas time
(Whatever the weather)
You be home for Christmas too
(We should be together)

We should be together
(We should be together)
(We should be together)
(We should be together)
(We should be together)
(We should be together)
