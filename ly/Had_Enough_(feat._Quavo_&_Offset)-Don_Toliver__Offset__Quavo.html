		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know
I know you had enough
I know you had enough of me
But stay a while
I know you had enough of me

Get on down if you bad enough (bad enough)
You and all your friends hopped out that Bentley truck (yeah)
You doing your thing, baby live it up (live it up)
You showin' out and you don't give a fuck (yeah)
It's the rodeo, gon' and touch your toes (touch your toes)
I might hit you from the back and that's as far as it goes (goes)
I done knocked 'em all down like some dominoes (dominoes)
She get money off that pussy and she climb the pole (yeah)
You got two choices, either Heaven or Hell, huh (you got two choices)
Meanwhile put that dope on the scale (brick or a bale), yeah
Meanwhile, bitch, I'm watching for twelve (uh, huh)
Prayin' to my God, I ain't goin' to jail

I know you had enough
I know you had enough of me
But stay a while
I know you had enough of me

Hey
Know you had enough (what?)
Lookin' like, "What the fuck?" (Who?)
You can't trust, you think I'm in love with lust
She look possessed, gon' get it off your chest (hey)
She asked to read my texts (texts)
Lookin' in her eyes, she stressed (she stressed)
Shawty get wet like baguettes (baguettes)
Take off your gown and your dress (take it off)
She got C-cup, D-cup breast (D-cup)
She bird and she live in a nest (brrr)
I'ma swerve and get off at the exit (swerve)
The rock on her finger dyslexic (stupid)
Still get the money, I gotta protect it (protect it)
Bumped my head, but I never regret shit
All these bitches lying, wanna sex me (sex)
Eat it up tryna catch me (eat it up)
They want the dressing and the recipe (recipe)
I want the buns like the sesame (sesame, yeah)

And I can really tell that she love me (yup)
Overload on Chanel and make her weep (make her weep)
Know you had enough of the side piece (side)
Know you had enough, we drink like Vikings (purple)
Spike Lee, do the right thing (right)
But she can't get enough of the piping (pipe)

I know you had enough
Of me
But stay a while, girl
I know you had enough
Of me
