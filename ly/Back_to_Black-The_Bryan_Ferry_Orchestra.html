		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I left no time to regret
Kept my lips wet
As yours same old safe bet
You and your head high
And your tears dry
Get on without you guy
I went back to what I knew
So far removed from all that we went through
And you tread a troubled track
Your odds are stacked
And you go back to black

You only said goodbye with words
You died a hundred times
And that go back to her
And you go back to
And you go back to black

I, I knew you much
It's not enough
I love blow and you love puff
And life is like a pipe
And I'm a tiny penny rolling up the walls inside

We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back to

You only said goodbye with words
You died a hundred times
And that go back to her
And you go back to

You only said goodbye with words
You died a hundred times
And that go back to her
And you go back to
And you go back to black
