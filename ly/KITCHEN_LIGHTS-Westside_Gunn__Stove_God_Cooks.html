		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ayo, Ayo
Ayo, Ayo

Ayo, you ever have to watch your moms get beat?
Roaches crawling, crackpipe on the bathroom seat
You need to bank out the speakers
Gold frame on the black Jesus
Eating grilled government cheeses
Bottega weaved suit
23 thousand, war tore visit
Had my name ringing through the mountains
Estopa tupperware
Chrome heart tips at the showers
Must the Virgil forces on the rec yard
Co threw up in the tower with Dan Cook
That's when shit got sour
Told 'em, if you sniff powder don't sell powder
Louis V patchwork
'Bout 50 for the shirt
'Bout 50 for the pants
Made the Pyrex dance low
Gas stove romance live out the Waldorf
Gave a hundred to the doorman, Comme Des Garcons Vans
The Dolce robe match the stove
The Dolce stove match the refrigerator
It's super FLYGOD, let me reiterate it
Air holes on the TEC, don't get humiliated
With like three chains, five tennis bracelets
We old school, got em' baggin' with their titties hangin'

Kitchen lights, kitchen lights
Kitchen li-I-I-ights
The bricks shine different under them kitchen lights
That money look bluer under them kitchen lights
Never seen a Richard Mille under kitchen lights
We don't lease, we buy the whole thing
I ain't selling nothing but the whole thing (I ain't selling nothing but the whole thing)
Kitchen lights
Kitchen li-I-I-ights

You ever had to watch the work disappear?
Water turn from foggy to clear, you just stand there and stare
Tec and the Fear of God sweats, he gon' air shit
Telling niggas they can't mirror this
Everything I whip is, like my wrist is, way ahead of its time
Food for thought and the dishes like Pete Maravich's
Got in the kitchen, they shoulda listened
They couldn't see my vision
I had Chanel dreams and yayo wishes
I had to dodge the ringer with seven bricks in the carseat like an infant
I'ma cook indefinite, I'm heaven sent
Shit get dirtier than Bill Laimbeer with the Pistons
I dropped a tear for my dog, they gave him twenty
When he touch back down, his baby gon' be twenty
Hold your head, we gon' build a bassinet out of hunnid's
He said his bunky is a nigga from my town 
That owe me money for an ounce I threw him 
Back when they was doin' the dougie
They can't stop me, can't take this from me
The ones prayin' that I fall the ones that say they love me
We had a hunnid bricks on the couch, it felt so good I wanted to die there
So many kilos piled up, I could've climbed here
I mean to this level we had filled the allure
You talkin' to a nigga that counted a half a million cash 
With cocaine under his fingernails before
The plug told me it move faster when you take your time
I ain't understand him then, but it all made sense in due time
Nine hour Paris flight reminiscing on life

Kitchen lights, kitchen lights (hang my jersey in the kitchen lights)
Them bricks shine different under them kitchen lights
That money look bluer under them kitchen lights
Never seen a Richard Mille under kitchen lights
We don't lease, we buy the whole thing
I ain't selling nothing but the whole thing
Kitchen lights
Kitchen lights
