		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fireworks in Manhattan
We're dancing and laughing
Like this isn't the end
Wear me over your shoulder
As the evening gets colder
Like we meant what we said

We both know this isn't right
Love isn't supposed to keep you up at night
We both know good things can end
I just don't wanna have to let you go yet

Don't wanna crash
My body is shaking
Did you think we could make it
Something better than this?
Is your mind made up?
Tell me, does it falter?
Can this get any harder
Than it already is?

We both know this isn't right
Love isn't supposed to keep you up at night
We both know good things can end
I just don't wanna have to let you go yet

These hearts weren't made for bending
So hold me while it's ending
It's easier pretending
So hold me while it's ending
These hearts weren't made for bending (oh)
So hold me while it's ending (so hold me, hold me)
It's easier pretending
So hold me while it's ending (oh, yeah)

We both know this isn't right
Love isn't supposed to keep you up at night
We both know good things can end
I just don't wanna have to let you go yet
