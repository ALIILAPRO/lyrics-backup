		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Are you fuckin' with that, F1LTH?
(Wake up, F1LTHY)
To Poland

I took the Wock' to Poland
I took the Wock' to Poland
I took the Wock' to Poland

Uh, psh
I've been fiendin', like I'm Keenan
Ride around with a Kel-Tec
If you mean it, baby girl, do you mean it?
I've been leaning, baby girl, I've been leaning
Phew, phew, phew (Wock')
Phone still ringin', battlin' all my demons
I've been fiending, baby girl, I've been fiending
Hope you love me, baby, I hope you mean it

I took the Wock' to Poland
I took the Wock' to Poland
I took the Wock' to Poland
