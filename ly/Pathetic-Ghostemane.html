		<p>
		  Why am I in pieces over everything you say?
I'm following the creases on this paper note you gave
Why do I still keep it?
I guess I'm scared of change
But I don't want to keep it
I just wanna change

You're pathetic, you know?
Why do I have to... remind myself of that?
I don't know...
I'm pathetic I know
But I don't have to... hurt you to pretend that it's not true
You're pathetic, you know?
Why do I have to... remind myself of that?
I don't know...
I'm pathetic I know
But I don't have to... hurt you to pretend that it's not true
