		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  "Oh, you think you're fancy now with that, uh
What is that on your wrist there 
That a Rolex?"
(Git, git, git, git, git, git)

Bust down (bust down), Rollie (Rollie), Audemars (uh), plain jane (plain jane)
Blow dank, pour drank, everyday same thing (same thing, same thing, same thing, same thing)
'Cause we just out here tryna maintain (same thing, same thing, same thing, same thing)
'Cause we just out here tryna maintain 
Bust down (bust down), Rollie (Rollie), Audemars (uh), plain jane (plain jane)
Blow dank, pour drank, everyday same thing (same thing, same thing, same thing, same thing)
'Cause we just out here tryna maintain (same thing, same thing, same thing, same thing)
'Cause we just out here tryna (same thing, same thing, same thing, same thing)

We all dealin' with the same pain
My dogs bleed from the same veins
Don't come around if you can't hang
I'm everything that you lames ain't
A little change can't change me, twenty years with the same gang
Twenty years, no off days, no days off, and I maintain
Ballin' crazy with the hang time (swish, swish), same time
Way back before Maybachs (skrrt, skrrt), I swear I always had the same drive (woo)
Pumpin' stucco off the mud, bucks pour up by the landslide
You ain't fly, you on standby, I got something that you can't buy
My older brother, call him rider man, my little brother had the vitamins
My baby brother, he been spazzin' lately (woo)
My mama happy, she been laughin' lately
First class (first class), two tones (two tones), my queen need two thrones (two thrones)
Almost wound up in a group home (yeah), who's this? New phone

Bust down (bust down), Rollie (Rollie), Audemars (uh), plain jane (plain jane)
Blow dank, pour drank, everyday same thing (same thing, same thing, same thing, same thing)
'Cause we just out here tryna maintain (same thing, same thing, same thing, same thing)
'Cause we just out here tryna maintain 
Bust down (bust down), Rollie (Rollie), Audemars (uh), plain jane (plain jane)
Blow dank, pour drank, everyday same thing (same thing, same thing, same thing, same thing)
'Cause we just out here tryna maintain (same thing, same thing, same thing, same thing) (hey, look)
'Cause we just out here tryna (same thing, same thing, same thing, same thing) 

AP, bust down Rollie, plain jane
Me and Belly, XO, same team, same gang (whoa)
Let my nuts and my chain hang (whoa)
In the Mulsanne havin' mood swings
Thirty millimetres ain't nothing 
Watch how my wrist and my neck bling
Stackin' up, countin' my blessings
Wedding bands ain't got no wedding (whoa, yeah)
I just spent a cool sixty on my wrist-wear (yeah)
Man, I want ten plain janes, wanna be like Ric Flair (woo)
My blood diamonds cost me blood and sweat and tears (woo)
Now my mind and all my stones are crystal clear (yeah)
Fake Watch Buster, ain't never bustin' me (nope)
Everyone of my jewelers get paid, they trust in me (yeah)
Took a lean nap, had a dream 'bout a custom piece
I hit up Elliot, he said that he gon' get it done for me

Bust down (bust down), Rollie (Rollie), Audemars (uh), plain jane (plain jane)
Blow dank, pour drank, everyday same thing (same thing, same thing, same thing, same thing)
'Cause we just out here tryna maintain (same thing, same thing, same thing, same thing)
Bust down (bust down), Rollie (Rollie), Audemars (uh), plain jane (plain jane)
Blow dank, pour drank, everyday same thing (same thing, same thing, same thing, same thing)
'Cause we just out here tryna maintain (same thing, same thing, same thing, same thing)

Yeah, yeah
