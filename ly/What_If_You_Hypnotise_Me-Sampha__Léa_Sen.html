		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you could gift my feelings language
Speech is a necessary magic sometimes
Please articulate my anguish
Please explain to me why these raindrops accompany better times, yeah

If you could make all the
If you could make the
What if, what if, what ifs
Just fly away for a minute, mmh
If you could make all the
If you could make the
What if, what if, what ifs
Just fly away for a minute, mmh

(I remember) angels weeping at my bad habits
(I remember) swan matches and smoke, dancing on the window pane
(Expand on that, that's interesting, man, what else do you remember?)
(I remember) thinking until my thoughts got damaged
(I remember) someone said you could help find my thoughts a name
(Psychoana-, hypnothera-, could you find my thoughts?)

Is it that I need some love
Love of the selfish kind?
Is it that I need to know
What's in the depth of mind?
Indeed if I do find out
Would I just stay confined?
Wishful thinking games
Wait 'til the stars align
Is it 'cause memories break
Why I feel lost in time?
Is it 'cause I've made mistakes?
Karma taking flight?
But if you could hypnotize me
Then maybe, then peace would find me
Oh, if you could hypnotize me
Then maybe, then peace would find

If you could make all the
If you could make the
What if, what if, what ifs
Just fly away for a minute, mmh
If you could make all the
If you could make the
What if, what if, what ifs
Just fly away for a minute, mmh

(Fly away)

Quiet storms dwelling on what you're not
I'll help you find a way out
Easily swayed, you're not cautious enough
Who made you this way?
Traveling inside your confine
Traffic in your heart and your mind
The spirit of your memory's gone blind
There's answers in your body entwined
