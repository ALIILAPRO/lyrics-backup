		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let's go
Rain drums at the side of the window
Pitter patter it's a perfect crescendo
With the charm and the beauty of a young girl
Marilyn Monroe

Makes me wonder
Is there peace to be found in the gutter?
A release in the sound of thunder?
Sensations mine to plunder
I grow fonder of this

Beauty beauty is found in time and space
I've lost my mind but
I've re-found my faith
A faith in this life to breathe again
I guess there is hope to be found in the end

And Uh my mind is on fire, on fire
Fires burning taking me higher, me higher
And I can't sleep
I'm feeling wired, so wired
Bruises left me feeling inspired, inspired
Yeah

Let's go
The pitter patter, it be thumping like techno
And the rumble of the thunder like an echo
Feeling manic close to panic
I will shake the frickin'
Planet with this fire so volcanic in me
Breathe in
I will rock from the floors to the ceiling
Inspiration, it fills me with healing
Oh this life never felt so appealing
Oh what a feeling

Oh this beauty
Beauty is found in time and space
I've lost my mind but
I've re-found my faith
A faith in this life to breathe again
I guess there is hope to
Be found in my friends

Uh my mind is on fire, on fire
Fires burning taking me higher, me higher
And I can't sleep
I'm feeling wired, so wired
Bruises left me feeling inspired, inspired
Yeah

Oh fate left me quite tired, quite tired
This moment is my messiah, messiah
All these omens point to desire, desire
And the ocean sings to me silently
It's singing out

Ye-e-e eh Yeah Yeah Yeah
Ye-e-e eh Yeah Yeah Yeah
Ye-e-e eh Yeah Yeah Yeah
Ye-e-e eh Yeah Yeah Yeah
Ye-e-e eh Yeah Yeah Yeah
Ye-e-e eh Yeah Yeah Yeah
Ye-e-e eh Yeah Yeah Yeah ye-e-e eh

Uh my mind is on fire, on fire
Fires burning taking me higher, me higher
And I can't sleep
I'm feeling wired, so wired
Bruises left me feeling inspired, inspired
Yeah

Oh fate left me quite tired, quite tired
Yeah this moment is my messiah, messiah
All these omens point to desire, desire
And the ocean sings to me silently
It's singing out
