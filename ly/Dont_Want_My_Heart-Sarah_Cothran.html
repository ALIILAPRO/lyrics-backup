		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't need to hear explaining
We done come out and say it
How could you say bye and be alright
after our evenings in July
But now you're gone and ghosting
You'd stick around I was hoping
Coping through nights under lights to keep from feeling inside
Rebound, get out
Shames hitting me now
But it subsides and I'm right back out to get me
A wreck, a mess
Since the moment you left
And so it seems you're better off without me
Somebody's broken my heart now it doesn't work like before
With all these people around the pain is still hard to ignore
Hate this
My heart won't quit aching
Someone won't you take it
Where it will not hurt me don't concern me no more
It's only bringing me down I don't want my heart anymore
I guess I've learned my lesson
Now on I'm cold and defensive, distant
Become a little numb better than losing love
They say that I'm cruel inside I'm only just protecting myself
Unemotional, well I've tried being heartfelt
It's better to have never loved than love and lose to somebody else
Somebody's broken my heart now it doesn't work like before
With all these people around the pain is still hard to ignore
Hate this
My heart won't quit aching
Someone won't you take it
Where it will not hurt me don't concern me no more
It's only bringing me down I don't want my heart anymore
A wreck, a mess
Since the moment you left
And so it seems you're better off without me
Hate this
My heart won't quit aching
Someone won't you take it
Where it will not hurt me don't concern me no more
It's only bringing me down I don't want my heart anymore
Hate this
Aching
Take it
It's only bringing me down I don't want my heart anymore
