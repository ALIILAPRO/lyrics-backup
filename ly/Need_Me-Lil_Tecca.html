		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I, I'm sorry that you
Seem to be confused
He belongs to me
The boy is-
(Ayy, Ronio, run it up)

I keep my day goin', I keep my bitch right
Say that she want Casamigos, it's a lit night
The whole hood tryna slide, so the list tight
She bad, so she get by easy
She said she don't need you, she said that she need me
I can make it splash, yeah, that's that water, Fiji
Eye for an eye, I could treat you how he treat me
Lie for a lie, I could show you it get beasty

New lane, cuttin' it, Usain, runnin' it
Big blunt, bunnin' it, lifestyle, covered it
I was on my shit and you actin' like you ain't noticed
I was makin' moves and you actin' like you ain't showed this, yeah
I ain't with the drama, tell me who we cuttin' off
The same ho you beefin' 'bout, yeah, she got nothin' on
And no, you not my girl, so I ain't seein' nothin' wrong
At all, these niggas know what I been on
Slide on my lonely, gas by the OZ
I don't got no OG, nowadays I'm OT
Oh, you say you like that, oh, you gotta show me
Tired of bitches actin' like they know me
Movin' like Montana, might as well call Tony
I got two hoes, might as well call brodie
She said, "Tryna ski with me?" No, I don't get nosey
Keep a couple B's with me, how I'm movin' mostly

I keep my day goin', I keep my bitch right
Say that she want Casamigos, it's a lit night
The whole hood tryna slide, so the list tight
She bad, so she get by easy
She said she don't need you, she said that she need me
I can make it splash, yeah, that's that water, Fiji
Eye for an eye, I could treat you how he treat me
Lie for a lie, I could show you it get beasty
I keep my day goin', I keep my bitch right
Say that she want Casamigos, it's a lit night
The whole hood tryna slide, so the list tight
She bad, so she get by easy
She said she don't need you, she said that she need me
I can make it splash, yeah, that's that water, Fiji
Eye for an eye, I could treat you how he treat me
Lie for a lie, I could show you it get beasty

She said she don't need you
I can make it splash, yeah, that's that water, Fiji
She said she don't need you
Lie for a lie, I could show you it get beasty
She said she don't need you
I can make it splash, yeah, that's that water, Fiji
She said she don't need you
Lie for a lie, I could show you it get beasty
