		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All alone
All alone
All alone
All alone

I got something to tell you but don't know how I'ma say it
I guess that I could only say one thing
Girl I been bad again
Girl I been bad again
'Cause with this money comes problems
And with these problems comes solutions
And I use 'em
When I'm faded I forget
Forget what you mean to me
Hope you know what you mean to me

Pick up your phone
The party's finished and I want you to know
I'm all alone
I'm feelin' everything before I got up

I always want you when I'm coming down
I always want you when I'm coming down (ay)
I always want you when I'm coming down (oh-ooh)
I always want you when I'm coming down (ay)
I always want you when I'm coming down (ay)
I always want you when I'm coming down (ooh)
I always want you when I'm coming down (oh yeah)
I always want you when I'm coming down 

Poppin' again, I tried to quit again
I'm always tight with something I begin
That's why my niggas got me to the end
Supply what I take, I take what I spend baby
I ain't lied to nobody but me
And you, and me
But you especially

Pick up your phone (oh-ooh)
The party's finished and I want you to know
I'm all alone
I'm feelin' everything before I got up

I always want you when I'm coming down (oh-oh)
I always want you when I'm coming down (when I'm coming down)
I always want you when I'm coming down (right down)
I always want you when I'm coming down (right down, right down, oh)
I always want you when I'm coming down (oh)
I always want you when I'm coming down (oh)
I always want you when I'm coming down (right down)
I always want you when I'm coming down

Ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Oh, oh-oh

Pick (pick) up your phone
I'm all alone

I always want you when I'm coming down
I always want you when I'm coming down
I always want you when I'm coming down
I always want you when I'm coming down
I always want you when I'm coming down
I always want you when I'm coming down
I always want you when I'm coming down
I always want you when I'm coming down
