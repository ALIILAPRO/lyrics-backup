		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One minute I'm happy, then I'm sad
I get angry, then relax
I go from chaos into self-control
It's one of my side effects (ha)

And you seem like a real nice guy
And I don't wanna treat you bad
So before you get a taste of me
Let me hit you with the recipe, yeah, yeah

I go a little OTT with the OCD
All my exes say that I'm crazy
I'ma check your phone while you half asleep
Maybe God was high when he made me
'Cause I OD on the jealousy
Got a PhD in anxiety
So, before you get in too deep
There's a couple things you should know about me

I'm cuckoo, cuckoo
A little cuckoo, cuckoo
Feel a little cuckoo, cuckoo
There's a couple things you should-

A little bit of this, a bit of that
I'm just laying down the facts
I'll give it all, I'll give you everything
But you better watch your back
(But you better watch your back)

And you seem like a real nice guy
And I don't wanna treat you bad
So before you get a taste of me
Let me hit you with the recipe, yeah, yeah

I go a little OTT with the OCD
All my exes say that I'm crazy
I'ma check your phone while you half asleep
Maybe God was high when he made me
'Cause I OD on the jealousy
Got a PhD in anxiety
So, before you get in too deep
There's a couple things you should know about me

I'm cuckoo, cuckoo
A little cuckoo, cuckoo
Feel a little cuckoo, cuckoo
There's a couple things you should know about, know about me
There's a couple things you should know about me, I'm-
There's a couple things you should know about me
