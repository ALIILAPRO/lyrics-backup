		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh, I'm startin' over
Stackin' it, it was the top, now you alright? (I'm startin' over)
I'm quite alright, damn, my money's right
Yeah, ayy, yeah, it's quite alright

I wake up in the morning, then I'm gettin' back to it (back to it)
Yeah, yeah, I'm gettin' back to it
You ain't show me no love, so I turned my back to you, yeah, yeah
I can't give no racks to you (8)

I don't really care 'cause I'm done
On the real, our love is not fun
There's no emotion on my face 'cause I'm numb
You see me everywhere you look, no, you can't hide or run (yeah, Lil Uzi, whoa)
Everything I said
Messing with your head
Messing with your head
I said, everything I said
Messing with your head
Messing with your head, whoa
Messing with your head, whoa

I been textin' her all night (night)
She know I was goin' wrong (yeah)
She left me right on read now
I'm walkin' with my head down
I gotta keep my head high
I got a whole 'nother check, not talkin' verified (okay)
Rest in peace my dead guys
I am no hater, yeah, we in the same whip
The only difference is that you do not own it (skrrt)
I can just tell by the way that you drivin' it
I pull up in that car just like it's stolen, yeah
Came a long way, came from the hallway
I can't stop, keep goin'
Yes, my life just feel like one long day
I just live in the moment (whoa)
Ooh, comin' out just when the sun down
My boys, they roofless like coupes and they really rundown
I got paper cuts from money, dollar bills covered in bust downs
Countin' with my thumb now, money make me numb now

I don't really care 'cause I'm done
On the real, our love is not fun (yeah)
There's no emotion on my face 'cause I'm numb
You see me everywhere you look, no, you can't hide or run
Yeah, everything I said
Messing with your head
Messing with your head
I said, everything I said
Messing with your head
Messing with your head, whoa
Messing with your head, whoa

I just got richer overseas, yeah
Lookin' at my watch and it's a Richard and it's green, yeah
I'm still smokin' on that good, know I'm blowin' out the steam, yeah
You wouldn't even believe the numbers stuffed up in my jeans, yeah
Tell that girl to back-back, gotta stack racks (hey)
No, I can't go out sad, can't go out bad, yeah
I told that girl I'm not no duck, this ain't Aflac, yeah
I don't wanna get older, I'm still livin' in my last year
All my life just keep goin', don't worry 'bout that
Just tighten up and keep flowin', cowabunga
'Cause she gon' ride me like wakeboard (yeah)
I'm lickin' on her body until she don't make noise, yeah

I don't really care 'cause I'm done
On the real (real), our love is not fun
There's no emotion on my face 'cause I'm numb
You see me everywhere you look, no, you can't hide or run (yeah, yeah, whoa)
Everything I said
Messing with your head
Messing with your head
I said, everything I said
Messing with your head
Messing with your head, whoa
Messing with your head, whoa

Whoa
I said, messing with your head, whoa
Messing with your head
Yeah
Thank you
No, really, thank you
You're far too kind
You, and you, and you
Experience of a lifetime
I see all of you (yeah), yeah
I really appreciate you
