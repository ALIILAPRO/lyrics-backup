		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  Dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance

I feel like the DJ is my bodyguard
You see the way he keeps me safe
With the treble and that bass
I feel free enough to party hard
This dress won't go to waste
Feels like I own the place, yeah
VIP to be the boss
You see the way these people stare
Watching how I fling my hair
I'm a dance floor lover
Baby there's no other
Who do it like I do it yeah

From here on out
I'll be your commander
No fear no doubt
I'll provide the answer
Right now I command you to dance
I'll be your commander
Now I command you to dance
I'll be your commander
Now I command you to

I I'll be your commander
I'll provide the answer

Ain't no reason to celebrate
But you know we gon' have a ball
Champagne spillin' from the wall
And I'll be partying till hella' late
But I ain't worried not at all
I just give my driver a call
Yeah pick me up at 8am
No we ain't stoppin' right here
We'll take the party to the crib
Let's go all night baby
You won't find no lady
Who does it like I does it yeah

From here on out
I'll be your commander
No fear no doubt
I'll provide the answer
Right now I command you to dance
I'll be your commander
Now I command you to dance
I'll be your commander
Right now I command you to

It's jam packed
So DJ where you at?
I know you got my back
So make that bass attack
Let's make these people move
You know I need some room, to
Do what I do, I'm 'bout to act a fool
Turn the lights on

From here on out
I'll be your commander
No fear no doubt
I'll provide the answer
Right now I command you to dance
I'll be your commander
Now I command you to dance
I'll be your commander
Right now I command you to dance

Dance
I-I'll be your commander
Dance, dance, dance
I'll provide the answer
Dance, dance, dance
