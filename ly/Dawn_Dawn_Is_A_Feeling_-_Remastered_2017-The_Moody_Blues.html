		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dawn is a feeling, a beautiful ceiling,
The smell of grass just makes you pass into a dream.
You're here today, no future fears,
This day will last a thousand years.
If you want it to.
You look around you, things they astound you,
So breathe in deep, you're not asleep open your mind.
You're here today, no future fears,
This day will last a thousand years,
If you want it to.
Do you understand that all over this land there's a feeling?
In minds far and near, things are becoming clear with a meaning.
Now that you're knowing, pleasure starts flowing,
It's true life flies, faster than eyes could ever see.
You're here today, no future fears,
This day will last a thousand years,
If you want it to.
