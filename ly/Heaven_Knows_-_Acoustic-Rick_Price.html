		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She's always on my mind
From the time I wake up 'til I close my eyes
She's everywhere I go
She's all I know

And though she's so far away
It just keeps gettin' stronger, every day
And even now she's gone
I'm still holding on
So tell me where do I start
'Cause it's breakin' my heart
Don't want to let her go

Maybe my love will come back some day
Only heaven knows
And maybe our hearts will find a way
Only heaven knows
And all I can do is hope and pray
'Cause heaven knows

My friends keep tellin' me
That if you really love her
You've gotta set her free
if she returns in kind
I'll know she's mine
But tell me where do I start
'Cause it's breakin' my heart
Don't want to let her go

Maybe my love will come back some day
Only heaven knows
And maybe our hearts will find a way
But only heaven knows
And all I can do is hope and pray
'Cause heaven knows

Why I live in despair
'Cause wide awake or dreaming
I know she's never there
And all the time I act so brave
I'm shaking inside
Why does it hurt me so

Maybe my love will come back some day
Only heaven knows
And maybe our hearts will find a way
But only heaven knows
And all I can do is hope and pray
'Cause heaven knows

Heaven knows
Heaven knows
