		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't mess this up, I'm warning you
Got a lot of options wishing they were you
Don't be the guy that walked away
That's a mistake you shouldn't make, go

Go easy
Don't act like you don't need me now
You're so busy
But don't act like you don't see me now
Don't be greedy
And jump on the next thing you see now
You see now

Ooh, don't you leave me for the girl next door
Ooh, don't you leave me for the girl next door
Girl next door, girl next door
Girl next door, girl next door
Girl next door
Don't you leave me for the girl next door (yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah)

Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye for that girl you seen outside
You know her loving ain't gonna be better than mine
And you know I won't waste no time, I can have another you by nine
You know it's you, why lie?
So you better just take your time
I'm just saying

Go easy
Don't act like you don't need me now
You're so busy
But don't act like you don't see me now
Don't be greedy
And jump on the next thing you see now
You see now

Ooh, don't you leave me for the girl next door
Ooh, don't you leave me for the girl next door
Girl next door, girl next door
Girl next door, girl next door
Girl next door
Don't you leave me for the girl next door
Girl next door, girl next door
Girl next door, girl next door
Girl next door
Don't you leave me for the girl next door
