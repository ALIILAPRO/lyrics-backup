		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't know what to call you
I don't know how you've been 'til now
To where we are now
You are no strange to me
You are still warm to me
Oh, why? That look on your face, hmm

Stare into space
'Cause of your glances
Now I feel blue somehow

"You have to live through this life"
Your voice makes my heart goes through
"Someday, we will meet again", hmm
Yeah, we'll meet again, some day

La-la-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la, la
La-la-la-la, la, la-la

Although I can't see you now
I lost in my eyes
Because the wind shades my eyes
Yet don't know what to say
You are still warm to me
Oh, why? That look on your face, hmm

Stare into space
'Cause of your glances
Now I feel blue somehow

"You have to live through this life"
Your voice makes my heart goes through
"Someday, we will meet again", hmm
Yeah, we'll meet again, some day

La-la-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la, la
La-la-la-la, la, la-la

Now I know
You left me here alone, gone away
Now I know
You're roaming somewhere, hmm
Waiting for you to come back
I'll wait for you, endlessly
