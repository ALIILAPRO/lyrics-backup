		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't bag-ah your love
No, no, no
I can't bag-ah your love
No, no, no
I can't bag-ah your love
No, no, no
Put it in a bag
Put it in a bag
Squeeze it 'til you sag
Baby in a bag
Baby in a bag
'Cause I don't have any sacks that are strong enough
And I don't have any liners that are long enough
And I don't have any baggies that are big enough
To bag your love
No, no, no
I can't bag-ah your love
No, no, no
I can't bag-ah your love
No, no, no
I can't bag-ah your love
No, no, no
Put it in a bag
Put it in a bag
Squeeze it 'til you sag
Baby in a bag
Baby in a bag
'Cause I don't have any sacks that are strong enough
And I don't have any liners that are long enough
And I don't have any baggies that are big enough
To bag your love
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
