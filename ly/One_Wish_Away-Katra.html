		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Once upon a time
Little girl, ancient light
Had wings so that she could fly
She wished upon a star
Give me safe and guard
I won't wake if I go too far

Can't you see what I see?
I felt so alive
When all my dreams
Were just one wish away

Can't you see what I see?
I felt so alive
When all my dreams
Were just one wish away

Some where above
They speak of love
They'll hurry unharmed,
Unharmed

By closing her eyes
She could easily fly
And leave all the tears behind

Wonder why I can no longer fly
Away from the pain I feel

Can't you see what I see?
I felt so alive
When all my dreams
Were just one wish away

Can't you see what I see?
I felt so alive
When all my dreams
Were just one wish away

No where to run
Wish she could fly
Eyes of a child will heal
Inside

Can't you see what I see?
I felt so alive
When all my dreams
Were just one wish away

Can't you see what I see?
I felt so alive
When all my dreams
Were just one wish away
