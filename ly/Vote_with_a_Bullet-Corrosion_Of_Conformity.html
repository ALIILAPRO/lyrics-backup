		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The number in nations
The god in their hearts
The justice in swine
The devil in god

Vote
This long hand that breaks our back
Still casting shadows on all that we see
Unjustified, mercy killing is just a feeling
To keep our numbers from being free

Prison for praise is not worth thinking
Sin is still in and our ballots are shrinking
So unleash the dogs - the only solution
Forgive and forget, fuck no
I'm talking about a revolution

The prophet man's got a needle in his hand
Draws his dreams from your soul - bleeding minds into sand
The year of the fear has arrived decades too late
And our right to stand and fight is now solely sealed in fate

Prison for praise is not worth thinking
Sin is still in and our ballots are shrinking
So unleash the dogs - the only solution
Forgive and forget, fuck no
I'm talking about a revolution

One last chance mission with a vision
'Cause our lives are just cards in their stack
Our time is short but theirs is shorter
How much longer can they hold us back

Prison for praise, the obvious answer
Once had power mad, living disaster
Don't fuck with me 'cause I'm on the freedom train
That bears no name, this time
I'm voting with a bullet

The view they once knew made our nooses too tight
This justice in swine
The devil in god

So god bless my soul, I've got total control
And the crosshairs lined up dead in my sight

I'm voting with a bullet
