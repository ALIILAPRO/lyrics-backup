		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Paint the town red
And paint me in blue
Shower me in lilac
The color purple always suited you
Violets and lavender
You'd promised those too
I never noticed how
You'd say you loved me with a twisted brow
And hand me roses Full of stinging thorns
And watch me smile as my heart was torn
I paint my lips red
my heart bleeds blue
I put your favorite record on
Will this music make your heart ring true?
Love and happy endings, babe, you'd promised those too
I've always known deep down
Your hands of roses swept
Across the town but I
I wanted to believe so bad
That you were my woman
Oh you make me sad
I always tried so hard
To make you stay and wipe my tears away
And beg for one more thorny rose bouquet
I thought my bleeding hands would make you feel some way
Baby please share your fire with me
I can be all things dark and rosy
Wear a crown made of thorns for you
Pick you violets and roses too
I come alive only when you're near
Awe you with one thousand tender fears
I can't make it out here on my own
To me, your love is like
A precious stone
I dye my hair a deep ruby red
I need your lips that seem on roses fed
Curly locks cover foolish brains
Caressed by your endless flames
I'll soothe your burning fever
Thaw your frozen heart
Breathe you in my lungs
Babe, I've been here from the start
I'll be your queen of delights
Your warmth on winter nights
I won"t go anywhere
Baby please just
Stay
They all say i'm doomed if I stay with you
But
You're
The
Air
I breathe
Baby please
Please don't leave
