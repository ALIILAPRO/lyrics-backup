		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I hoped, you'd stay, just a little bit longer
And I hoped you'd keep calling

With every single day I have to face
I wonder why our love was stolen away
With every single breath I have to waste

I'm burning like a fire, will someone help my pain?
I'm drowning above the water, oh, help me breathe again
And I, I can't let you go, so when you're ready, come back home

I'd like to say, I'm sorry
And I thought you'd stay (you'd stay)

With every single night I'd have to face
With every single dream I'd have to chase
I wonder if our love's in the same place

I'm burning like a fire, will someone help my pain?
I'm drowning above the water, oh, help me breathe again
And I, I can't let you go, so when you're ready, come back home, yeah

I would try and be the man that I said I would
Just come back home
And I'll try, I'll try 'cause I said I would
Just come back home
I will try and be the man that I said I would
Just come back home
And I'll try, and I'll try, and I'll try
Come back home, please come back home

I'm burning like a fire, will someone help my pain?
I'm drowning above the water, oh, help me breathe again
Oh ah and I, I can't let you go, so when you're ready, come back home
