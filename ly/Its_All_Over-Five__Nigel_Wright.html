		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  [Chorus]
Girl (It's all over)
This time (It's all over)
I swear (It's all over)
on my name (Yes it's all over)
believe (It's all over)
that baby it's all over now

(It's all over, this time)
Thought I was made for you
and you believed in me
I thought this was how love was meant to be
didn't know it
but you were foolin' me around, oh

You had a hold on me
I was too blind to see
Could've been yours for eternity

Didn't see it
`til it was all up in my face, ah no-no
Do you recall the times that we shared
moments alone and your promises but
now the days are gone
now you're on your own tonight
never again 'cause

[Chorus]

Now I know the truth
It really hurts inside
'cause every lie just twists the knife
the way I'm feelin'
there's just no remedy

Do you recall the times that we shared
moments alone and your promises but
now the days are gone
now you're on your own tonight
never again 'cause

[Chorus]
Ya hit me with the truth
hit me with the raw fact
put me on my back what you gotta say to that
You got me with your lies
I was thinking we were set
counting every second every day since we met
Remember in the times when we used to have it all
but then came the fall feeling like we hit a brick wall
Now You can keep it the lies in my ears
You're gonna shed tears as your man disappears

Yo! Sit back and let me do my thing
Laced with the click with the 5 on the swing
I'm not the one who's gonna be plagued by your kind
24-7 girl it's time to rewind
It's over just like a wack track you can't get with this
so you gotta get with that
No doubt in my mind the base so phatt
baby let me bring it on wiggy wack now

[Chorus]
