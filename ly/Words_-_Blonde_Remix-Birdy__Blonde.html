		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Waiting on you
Trying to keep your head strong
With nothing to lose
You raise your voice with something to prove
And all the things you say to me
I can't forget them
You don't leave
But you tell me with your eyes what you need
Oh, please
Do you think that I don't know what it means?

All the things you hide for me
I accept them
But I need you next to me

If I can't hold you now
Keep thinking that you might not come around
I have no words, I have no words to say
If I can't change your mind
Keep thinking, is this our last goodbye?
You say it first, you say it first to me

You're in the clear
While I'm waking up to nothing but tears
And you say they've said
That I'm the only one that needed to change

You know the things you've said to me
Do you regret them?
I just need you next to me

If I can't hold you now
Keep thinking that you might not come around
I have no words, I have no words to say
If I can't change your mind
Keep thinking, is this our last goodbye?
You say it first, you say it first to me

So I can't just forget you, just forget you
Can't just forget you, just forget you

And If I can't hold you now
Keep thinking how you might not come around
And I have no words, I have no words to say
If I can't change your mind
Keep thinking, is this our last goodbye?
You say it first, you say it first to me

If I can't hold you now (if I can't hold you now)
Keep thinking that you might not come around (might not come around)
I have no words, I have no words to say
If I can't change your mind (if I can't change your mind)
Keep thinking, is this our last goodbye? (our last goodbye?)
You say it first, you say it first to me
