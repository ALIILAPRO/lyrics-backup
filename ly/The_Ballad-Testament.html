		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm not one to say
Where my feelings are going when they wither away
Oh I pray to see another day
My heart's feeling like a needle lost in the hay
Restrained to meet again
Oh my friend do you think that we ever will?
Oh, I know we are free

The games are played with your life on the line
Some lose, you win if you keep on trying
I don't mind doing the time, I'm happier being alive
Now I know the means of my oppression were all lies
The only truth is your own
Most sacred lesson I'd ever learn
Oh, I know we are free

Yeah, yeah
Don't go, no
Don't look back
Just realize

I've been robbed, I've been fooled
I intend now to make my own rules
Dagger's edge cut the line
I've been down that road too many times

What's to fear? Fear no more
Show my conscience what fear's for
Now I know this is so real
What's done is done, so do as you will

I'm keeping alive, go on, no, don't look back
Just realize where you've gone
Where are you going to? No, life's not done with you
You've only just begun to live your life for you
