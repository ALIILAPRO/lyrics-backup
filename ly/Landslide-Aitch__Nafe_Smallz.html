		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Go, go, go, go)
Up the score by a landslide
I'm from North Manny, 'nough gang signs, like (yeah)
(Go, go, go, go)
Shorty said she on her period, I might put it all in her backside

I've had trap money, had rap money, had labels on me, had cats on me
Them pussios ain't got chat for me
Talk on my name, but that's blasphemy
Been top five for like six years
Young OG, I'm still twenty-three
Just can't keep me out your chick's ear
She don't love you, she still bellin' me, lil' bitch (woo)
Got it locked from North to the South (yeah)
Shorty said she on her period, I might put it all in her mouth (all in her mouth)
I just made some more Queen Liz, I might put it all in her house (yeah)
She sucked me off and then filmed it, a bitch done it all for the clout (yeah, yeah)
Woke up and I Milly Rocked, but, before the millis, man been a boss
Jewellery on in this Hellcat, I don't sell crack, I got bigger rocks
Quarter spent on some cool shit
Got a new crib with a cinema
Shorty titties ain't too big, but, that booty's from Dominica

(Go, go), yeah (go)
Up the score by a landslide
I'm from North Manny, 'nough gang signs, like (yeah)
(Go, glee, glee, glee)
Shorty said she on her period, I might put it all in her backside

What you drinkin' on? Yeah
What you smokin' on? Yeah
What you drinkin' on? Uh
What you smokin' on? Yeah
What you drinkin' on? Yeah

What you drinkin' on? Yeah
What you smokin' on? Yeah
What you drinkin' on? Yeah
What you smokin' on? Yeah

Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet
We come from from LA, she from the Middle East
We don't hit the party, we just hit the suite
I book out the floor, the party comes to me
Glass down, she can see that I'm on, yeah (I'm on)
Sloppy down in the back of the Rolls, yeah (Rolls, yeah, yeah)
Fuck her phone, sellin' bricks out my home (yeah)
Light this blunt, shit, I'm back in the zone (smoke)
Pour a liter, double up Styrofoam (glee, yeah, yeah)
Coliseum, she landed in Rome
Weed and alcohol, I'm gone (I'm gone)
Back to the hills (yeah), honey, I'm home

(Go, go, go, go)
Up the score by a landslide
I'm from North Manny, 'nough gang signs, like (yeah)
(Go, go, yeah, go, go)
Shorty said she on her period, I might put it all in her backside

What you drinkin' on? Yeah
What you smokin' on? Yeah
What you drinkin' on? Uh
What you smokin' on? Yeah
What you drinkin' on? Yeah
What you smokin' on? Yeah
What you drinkin' on? Yeah
What you smokin' on? Yeah
What you drinkin' on? Yeah
What you smokin' on? Yeah
What you drinkin' on? Yeah
What you smokin' on? Yeah
What you drinkin' on? Yeah
What you smokin' on? Yeah
What you drinkin' on? Yeah
