		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I never used to be the one to lose control
Paranoid thoughts when I'm on my own
I don't wanna be the one to check your phone
But lately I
I can only sleep when my bags are packed
Only feel myself when I overreact
Why am I safer when I'm feeling sad

It's like I keep on hurting people just to stop them hurting me back
I keep on sabotaging myself till I'm all that I have

Oh, I wish there was something you could say
But I've seen how love is made
All the beauty and the pain
I'm still wearing my bulletproof vest
On the inside of my chest
Oh I hate that I'm this way
But I've seen how love can change
That's why I keep on building fire escapes
That's why I keep on building fire escapes

I keep on misreading your undertones
Always second guessing when I'm alone
Keep my feelings hidden 'til they overflow
Almost like I've
Forgotten how it feels to be vulnerable
Never let myself get too comfortable
Never been good at letting go

It's like I keep on hurting people just to stop them hurting me back
I keep on sabotaging myself 'til I'm all that I have

Oh, I wish there was something you could say
But I've seen how love is made
All the beauty and the pain
I'm still wearing my bulletproof vest
On the inside of my chest
Oh I hate that I'm this way
But I've seen how love can change
That's why I keep on building fire escapes

So I how do I, how do I
Get out of this, get out of this, this time?
So I how do I, how do I
Get out of this, get out of this, this time?
That's why I keep on building fire escapes
