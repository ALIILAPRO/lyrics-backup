		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm so bored
I think I'll burn all my clothes
Standing in the bathroom, singing alone
I don't even like this song
Rolling up, getting comfortable
I've been drinking kitchen
Table coffee alone can never get high enough

Paint dries like my tired eyes
Rain cries i don't wanna go outside

Can’t think of other ways I
Wanna waste my time
All I do is fuck around with words that rhyme
I wish I didn't wonder why, I wonder why
Why I
It doesn't even matter all the things I say
When nobody is listening to me anyway
I don't even like my friends tonight
I must be out of my mind
I don't wanna go outside

I walk my dog, but never too far from home
'Cause I need to make it back
To watch That '70s Show
I lay around on the floor i hate my phone
'Cause it reminds me that I'm alone
I got people calling me
But I let them know that I'm unavailable

Paint dries like my tired eyes
Rain cries i don't wanna go outside

Can’t think of other ways I
Wanna waste my time
All I do is fuck around with words that rhyme
I wish I didn't wonder why, I wonder why
Why I
It doesn't even matter all the things I say
When nobody is listening to me anyway
I don't even like my friends tonight
I must be out of my mind

I might be standing still as I can be
But my mind keeps running and
Running in circles around me
I might be waiting an eternity
While my mind keeps running and
Running in circles around me

Can’t think of other ways I
Wanna waste my time
All I do is fuck around with words that rhyme
I wish I didn't wonder why, I wonder why
Why I
It doesn't even matter all the things I say
When nobody is listening to me anyway
I don't even like my friends tonight
I must be out of my mind

I might be standing still as I can be
But my mind keeps running and
Running in circles around me
