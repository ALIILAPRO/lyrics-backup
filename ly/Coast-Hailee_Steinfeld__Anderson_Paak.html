		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Coast)

You're the wave upon the ocean
Poundin' rhythm and motion
It's a full moon kind of night, yeah
I don't wanna go home yet
You can question my devotion
Wear my heart on my shoulder
Just relax and let the riptide pull you close

(Ah)
Baby, all I wanna do is coast (coast)
With you (with you)
Energy, the body flows
(Ah)
Baby, all I wanna do is coast (coast)
With you (with you)
Frequency of all we know (uh)

Feelin' like I caught a wave with ya
I been dealin' with a lot of changes
And all the people that I like to hang with
They all been sayin' that I ain't the same
Listen, I been chillin' with you for a couple days
If you ain't afraid, me and you should rage (hey)
In the sun rays, come on out the cage 
Don't wanna tame, live it your way (hey)
Body go for days, got me in a daze 
Parties in LA feel like holidays 
Hit the PCH and we on the way
To a place I was born and raised
You live on the screen and the stage
I wanna fit in between your legs
Let's pick a day, everything could wait
Words can't relate, but it's givin' fate

(Ah)
Baby, all I wanna do is coast (coast)
With you (with you)
Energy, the body flows
(Ah)
Baby, all I wanna do is coast (coast)
With you (with you)
Frequency of all we know 

'Cause nothin' feels as real when we're connected
Relax and let the riptide pull you close
(Ah)
Baby, all I wanna do is coast (coast)
With you (with you)
Frequency of all we know

The stars come down, you drown 'em out
I'm sinkin' deeper into you
I'll breathe you in, I'll breathe you out
I'm sinkin' deeper into (hey)

(Ah)
Baby, all I wanna do is coast (coast)
With you (with you)
Energy, the body flows (we could cruise with the moves, like)
(Catch a wave in the moonlight)
Baby, all I wanna do is coast (coast)
With you (with you)
Frequency of all we know

'Cause nothin' feels as real when we're connected (coast)
Relax and let the riptide pull you close
(Ah)
Baby, all I wanna do is coast (coast)
With you (with you)
Frequency of all we know
