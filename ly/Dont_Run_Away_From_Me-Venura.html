		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know it's hard to deal
To cry yourself to sleep
To run away from me
And to hide yourself in fear
But you should know that I care and I’m trying to help
You should know that I'm here, always around and near
I’ll be the hunter to kill all the monsters
I promise not to leave you but I’ll stay away
I’ll be by your side when you have no one to call
I’ll be your bright light, that shines through the dark
Call my name at night
When the darkness fills your mind
When you’re stuck in your own hell
And the pain won’t go away
You should know that I care and I’m trying to help
You should know that I'm here, always around and near
I’ll be the hunter to kill all the monsters
I promise not to leave you but I’ll stay away
I’ll be by your side when you have no one to call
I’ll be your bright light, that shines through the dark
