		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Every night every day
I tell my heart to forget you and to move away
Not to break anymore
But, oh, no matter
What I say
You're so deep in my mind
There's no way to leave this love behind

It used to be
I believe I could go on and find someone to
Rest upon anyone, anyone
Soon I found
There was no other
There you are
Framed against the sky
You are my life and I pray for when
You will be mine
To love again

I see the rain in the sky
And I see your face
Through every tear that I cry
With every breath and every sound
I can hear another voice and swear that you're around
And every word is clear
'Cause I know
The memory won't let go
Until you're mine
To love again

Who's to say what lives in the past
Who's to say that love won't last
Time's been standing still
Waiting so patiently until
Until that one day when
When I will have you
To love again

And there you are
Framed against the sky
You are my life
And I pray for when
You will be mine
To love again
