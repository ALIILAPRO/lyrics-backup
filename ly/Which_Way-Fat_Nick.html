		  [Intro]
MTM, hit 'em with the heat

[Chorus]
Okay, okay, okay, diamonds blinking, shining bright way
Okay, okay, okay, Uzi loaded, don't look my way
Which way? What way? Your bitch come to my way
Which way? What way? Your bitch come to my way
Okay, okay, okay, diamonds blinking, shining bright way
Okay, okay, okay, Uzi loaded, don't look my way
Which way? What way? Your bitch come to my way
Which way? What way? Your bitch come to my way

[Verse]
Goyard dressed, sauced up, watch my diamonds pop
Uzi tucked, let it rock, watch a mark drop
Designer only all on me, get your mans hot
Dropped out, fucked up, I don't give a fuck
Stunt, flex, Beamer on my neck
Your MCM broke as fuck, GG's lookin' stressed
I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't touch a bum bitch
I can't love her, ima stick it in her throat, bitch
Rollie on me, tick tock, through them ice blocks
You hatin' on me, but you know I got your bitch hot
Flex a Ford Focus, bitch, I push a drop top
Think you hard, but just fruity like a Poptart
All my bankrolls fat, I told these labels run it back
[?] bitch, your pussy [?] wetland shit
20 on me, 30 on me, keep my neck frosty
Now my wrist jump like Bieber, turnin' up the party


[Chorus]
Okay, okay, okay, diamonds blinking, shining bright way
Okay, okay, okay, Uzi loaded, don't look my way
Which way? What way? Your bitch come to my way
Which way? What way? Your bitch come to my way
Okay, okay, okay, diamonds blinking, shining bright way
Okay, okay, okay, Uzi loaded, don't look my way
Which way? What way? Your bitch come to my way
Which way? What way? Your bitch come to my way
