		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't be mistaken
Your bloody time's up
This ain't no game
We're not here to entertain you

Don't be mistaken
Your bloody time's up
This ain't no game
We're not here to entertain you

Get your fix sitting on your throne
Want it all and the price it doesn't matter
The world is yours and you think you know that we don't

I know that smile so I should've known
You sold me out for a reckless bet, you burned me
Of the ground now won't back down anymore
No, you didn't have to burn me

You think you own me but I wouldn't be so sure
You won the battle but you're gonna lose a war

Go to hell, I'm not here to entertain you
Just walk away or face the showdown
I won't bow, I don't care about the bleeding
'Cause my freedom's undefeated

My soul on fire, burning desire
Make no mistake 'cause the stakes are getting higher
Go to hell, I'm not here to entertain you
I'm not here to entertain you
(I'm not here to entertain you)

Don't be mistaken
Your bloody time's up
This ain't no game
(We're not here to entertain you)

You pull your face like you didn't know
Like you cared and we'd buy your sorry story
Who's the fool? Now you're out of stones, yeah you know

Blame the sea, blame the moon for all
Don't you see, we're the ones with the redemption
Yeah the time keeps turning round, turning round
Now the time is gone you're going down

You think you own me but I wouldn't be so sure

Go to hell, I'm not here to entertain you
Just walk away or face the showdown
I won't bow, I don't care about the bleeding
'Cause my freedom's undefeated

My soul on fire (fire), burning desire (desire)
Make no mistake 'cause the stakes are getting higher
Go to hell, I'm not here to entertain you
I'm not here to entertain you

Yeah, in your mind you deny all the suffering
You've taken sides 'cause you lost it, ain't your fight now
And you don't care anymore 'cause you lost the crown now
We're not here to entertain you
No, we're not here to entertain you

(I'm not here to entertain you)

Don't be mistaken
Your bloody time's up
This ain't no game
We're not here to entertain you
