		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm on my champion shit yeah

Yeah hit VIP like I got 20k
Feeling fresh to death
Bottles on the way
Niggas salty I'm extra pepper
Always bring the space
When I spit a record
And I'm a say
This just for the record
I'm going for the crown
Like it's chess and checkers
Screwed her last night call that
Black and decker
She ride like a model
But you've never met her
Don't care about a hater
Because I'm getting paper
So its see you later
To these brothers claiming
They a player you a faker
Jack moves then you get
The razor
The star finish wars
Like I hang with Vader
Trizzy style you know sound
Incredible
Whack emcees sound like they
Ain't credible
They say they ain't
Got ghostwriters I say that
Shit is bull i've been at this
For a while man who you
Trying to fool
Scotch on the rocks
On the dance floor
While she twerking
Love to see that fucking body
Bop make it pop
Paid 4 grand just to rock the spot
Put the bands in the briefcase
Make that money drop
Make that money drop
JT on my suit and tie
No mediocre shout out
Iggy, TI
If you ain't crew
Mind your own damn BI
Fourth ward till I die
Always claim MI

Yeah I'm flexing baby
Shorty pouring MoÃ«t
No more living in debt
Hennessey on deck
With the team I rep
Make the shot get the change
Dog it's all about net
Yeah team hit the bank deep
Depositing checks
Or invest
Got a double check all assets
Yeah yeah
Claiming they got me
But they never see me
Disappear like an owl bitch Houdini
Do you know this kid
From the north he's getting
Colder
Old school but razor sharp
Like a Motorola
Niggas say I'm fake
But I never flake
So niggas always try to call
My bluff like it's Texas Hold Em
Hit the club on my Keith Sweat
Bad chicks eyeing me
Take her to the pad
Get that kitty wet
Baby do you got a man though
Because I swear
You got me hypnotized
By the way you move
That ass slow
I've gotten where I need to be
Work ethic 'Pac level
Yeah that's how it need to be
Dunk hits just like Derrick Rose
Man it's happening
If rap was NBA I would have
Like seven rings
Bentley beamers raris
After parties chilling with Ari
And my boy Billy faded
Off Bacardi that's it how it go
Haters can't tread
On my plateau
Like before I told y'all
There's no place that I can't go
Yeah
