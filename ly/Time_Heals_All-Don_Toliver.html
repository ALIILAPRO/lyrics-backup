		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You know time heals all, are you sweatin' (yeah)
I'ma beat it up between breakfast
Lookin' in the mirror, no flexin'
Swervin' through LA, my private dancer

Shawty got me in her room (mm) 
Knowin' that I'm in the mood (in the mood)
I be showin' you a thing or two (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Is your life a whirl?
Drop and dance on the pole, it be cool then I let you go-o-o-o
For the Rodeo, ooh-ooh-ooh

Show me how you do that, need tutorials (ooh)
The way you dancin' on that pole, it's choreo (ooh)
A work of art, the silhouette it's like memorial (uh-uh)
I'll work your back and work your heart, just how the story goes
And, you said you would never soul, but you're breakin' your promise
And breakin' your code
Want me to creep around and keep around?
You gotta be on your toes
Said you love me for show (show)
You were backstage at my shows
I want you back in your role
And, now the phone rings both ways
Fuck around and call you first 'cause you're special, bae (uh-uh)
And the way I put it up drive you crazy
You feelin' like you with this 'cause I let you, baby

Shawty got me in her room (mm)
Knowin' that I'm in the mood (in the mood)
I be showin' you a thing or two (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Is your life a whirl?
Drop and dance on the pole, it be cool then I let you go-o-o-o
For the Rodeo, ooh-ooh-ooh

You know time heals all, are you sweatin' (yeah)
I'ma beat it up between breakfast
Lookin' in the mirror, no flexin'
Swervin' through LA, my private dancer

Shawty got me in, shawty doesn't know
(Shawty got me in)
Shawty got me in, shawty doesn't know (yeah)
One, I gotta un shh
Smell like Saint Laurent
Nothing overseas, speed on the autobahn
Shawty one on one, yeah, shawty one on
I wanna get loud with somebody
I wanna feel the heat between your body (feel the heat)
Knowin' I'm really lovin' your body, I be wantin' your body
Knowin' I got your

Shawty got me in her room (mm) 
Knowin' that I'm in the mood (in the mood)
I be showin' you a thing or two (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Is your life a whirl?
Drop and dance on the pole, it be cool then I let you go-o-o-o
For the Rodeo, ooh-ooh-ooh
