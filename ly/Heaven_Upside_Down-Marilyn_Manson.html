		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can hear the scream of trumpets
Smell the ash and sulfur
Talons of battalion scratch out the sky
Like black feathers, scorpion eyes

I don't attract what I want, I attract what I am
Dead as the bees buzzing inside my head

Hold my hand and spin around
Hold my hand and spin around
Hold my hand and spin around
This is heaven upside down

When I try to look inside you
I ended up looking through you
Now you're trying to tell me
You're not a ghost

When I try to look inside you
I ended up looking through you
Now you're trying to tell me
You're not a ghost

I don't attract what I want, I attract what I am
Dead as the bees buzzing inside my head

When I try to look inside you
I ended up looking through you
Now you're trying to tell me
You're not a ghost, you're not a ghost

Not a ghost
Not a ghost
Not a ghost
Not a ghost

Hold my hand, spin around
Hold my hand, spin around
Hold my hand and spin around
This is heaven upside down

Hold my hand, spin around
This is heaven upside down
Hold my hand, spin 'round
This is heaven upside down

When I try to look inside you
I ended up looking through you
Now you're trying to tell me
You're not a ghost

When I try to look inside you
I ended up looking through you
Now you're trying to tell me
You're not a ghost, you're not a ghost

Not a ghost
Not a ghost
Not a ghost
Not a ghost

Not a ghost
Not a ghost
Not a ghost
Not a ghost
