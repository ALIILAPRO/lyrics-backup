		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She's like a frostfern in my head 
The lamplight burns my eyes and then she fades away 
My pencil's frozen in my hand 
And the letter I can't write, it seems to be a desert without end 

I woke up late at night 
She called me up then disappeared 
And the echo of her voice filled the empty places in my dreams 
With the silent tide 

She fades away 
Again 
She fades away 
She fades away again, 

Don't go now, please stay 
My senses are cruising through a void 
As pale reflections play on the deserted road 
I hear a humming of machines 

A distant sound like thunder 
Crawling through the cold 
There's no escape, I know, 
I run around in circles without end 

And the more the memory grows 
Dissolving from reality 
With the silent tide 
She fades away... 

... don't make me cry 
This time, I've got to learn 
I know, she won't return
