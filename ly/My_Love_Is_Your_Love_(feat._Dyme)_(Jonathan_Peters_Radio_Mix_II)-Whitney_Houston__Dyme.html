		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If tomorrow is judgment day
And I'm standing on the front line
And the Lord asks me what I did with my life
I will say I spent it with you

If I wake up in World War III (World War III)
I see destruction and poverty
And I feel like I want to go home
It's okay if you're coming with me

'Cause your love is my love 
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us
'Cause your love is my love 
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us

If I lose my fame and fortune (really don't matter)
And I'm homeless on the street (on the street oh Lord)
And I'm sleeping in Grand Central Station (okay)
It's okay if you're sleeping with me

As the years they pass us by (the years, the years, the years, the years, the years)
We stay young through each other's eyes (each other's eyes)
And no matter how old we get
It's okay as long as I got you baby

'Cause your love is my love 
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us
'Cause your love is my love 
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us

If I should die this very day (very very very day)
Don't cry (don't cry), 'cause on Earth we weren't meant to stay
And no matter what the people say (really don't matter)
I'll be waiting for you after the judgment day

'Cause your love is my love 
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us
'Cause your love is my love 
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us
