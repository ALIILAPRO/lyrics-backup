		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What's the worst thing that could happen to you?
Take a chance tonight and try something new
You're getting boring, you're oh-so boring
And I don't recognize the zombie you turn into

Don't worry 'cause tonight I got you
You can take a seat, do what you normally do
I'm about to let you see
(This is) this is what'll happen if you ain't givin' your girl what she needs

Leave you, move on to a perfect stranger
You talk, I walk, wanna feel the danger
See me with him and it's turning you on
It's got me saying
Getting me back at the end of this song

Get outta my (hey)
Get outta my way
Got no more to say (hey)
He's taken your place
Get outta my way
Way outta my way
Got no more to say (hey)
He's taken your place
Get outta my way

Now I gotta taste, I wanna explore
Ain't going to waste, no, not anymore
You goin' hard now to win my heart, but
Too many times now you've been calling her

Don't worry 'cause tonight I got you
You can take a seat, do what you normally do
I'm about to let you see (let you see)
This is what'll happen if you ain't givin' your girl what she needs

Leave you, move on to a perfect stranger
You talk, I walk, wanna feel the danger
See me with him and it's turning you on
It's got me saying
Getting me back at the end of this song

Get outta my (hey)
Get outta my way
Got no more to say (hey)
He's taken your place
Get outta my way
Way outta my way (hey)
Got no more to say (hey)
He's taken your place
Get outta my

And, no, I ain't goin' home 'cause I wanna stay
But I won't be alone, no how, no way
Now I've showed you what I'm made of (made of)
This is what'll happen if you ain't givin' your girl what she needs

Leave you, move on to a perfect stranger
You talk, I walk, wanna feel the danger
See me with him and it's turning you on
It's got me saying
Getting me back at the end of this song

Get outta my (hey)
Get outta my way (hey)
Got no more to say (hey)
He's taken your place
Get outta my (hey)
Way outta my way (hey)
Got no more to say (hey)
He's taken your place
Get outta my way

No, I ain't goin' home (uhuh uhuh uhuh)
But I won't be alone (uhuh uhuh uhuh)
Now I've showed you what I'm made of (uhuh uhuh uhuh)
Now I've showed you what I'm made of (uhuh uhuh uhuh ah)
