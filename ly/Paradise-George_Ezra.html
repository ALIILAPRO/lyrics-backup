		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My love (my love)
My lover, lover, lover
I'm in paradise whenever I'm with you
My mind (my mind)
My m-m-m-m-mind well, it's a paradise whenever I'm with you
Ride on (ride on)
I will ride on down the road
I will find you, I will hold you, I'll be there
It's long (how long?)
Well, it's a mighty long road but
I'll find you, I will hold you and I'll be there

I know you heard it from those other boys
But this time it's real
It's something that I feel and
I know you heard it from those other boys
But this time it's real
It's something that I feel and

If it feels like paradise running through your bloody veins
You know it's love heading your way
If it feels like paradise running through your bloody veins
You know it's love heading your way

My time (my time)
My t-t-t-t-time well, it's a never ending helter-skelter
We'll be out whatever the weather
My heart (my heart)
My boom-boom heart
It's a beat and its a thumping
And I'm alive

I know you heard it from those other boys
But this time it's real
It's something that I feel and
I know you heard it from those other boys
But this time it's real
It's something that I feel and

If it feels like paradise running through your bloody veins
You know it's love heading your way
If it feels like paradise running through your bloody veins
You know it's love heading your way

Paradise, hold on, hold on
Meet me there, hold on, hold on
Paradise, hold on, hold on
Meet me there, hold on, hold on
Paradise, hold on, hold on
Meet me there, hold on, hold on
Paradise, hold on, hold on
Meet me there, hold on, hold on
Paradise, hold on, hold on
Meet me there, hold on, hold on
Paradise, hold on, hold on
Meet me there, hold on, hold on

If it feels like paradise running through your bloody veins
You know it's love heading your way
If it feels like paradise running through your bloody veins
You know it's love heading your way

I know you heard it from those other boys
But this time it's real
It's something that I feel and
I know you heard it from those other boys
But this time it's real
It's something that I feel and

If it feels like paradise running through your bloody veins
You know it's love heading your way
If it feels like paradise running through your bloody veins
You know it's love heading your way
If it feels like paradise running through your bloody veins
You know it's love heading your way
If it feels like paradise running through your bloody veins
You know it's love heading your way
