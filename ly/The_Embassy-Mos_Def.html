		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mentioned that he worked for the embassy
People seem to find that interesting
High status, intrigue and mystery
Special code name on the hotel registry
I love it when they say
Enjoy your stay
They say it how they mean it
'Cause that's how they been trained
Show you to your room
A suite with a view
Well if anything at all
Do not hesitate to call
Nice the greatest the greatest
Compliments, tooth brush, tooth paste, razors
A bible, a Quran in a drawer
Or depending where you are
Tend to whisper through the walls
She was calling on God
The greatest the greatest
Salutations, congratulations
Reservations, exclusive arrangements
Dinner with the patrons
The scenery is amazing
It's so outrageous
They whisper when they say it
When it's really real it's even realer than the matrix
Classic modern ancient flagrant
Get a special thrill every time they get to say it
Peace
I work with the embassy
On behalf of imagination industry
I come visit
You come visit
Such a pleasure
Official business
