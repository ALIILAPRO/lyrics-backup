		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I didn't know that I was capable of being happy right now
But you showed me how
I didn't know that you were right in front of me
Until I looked out

You make me wanna cry in a good way
You make me wanna cry in a good way
You make me wanna cry in a good way
You make me wanna cry in a good way

You weigh just as much as me, don't you?
I can feel it when we touch
I know you been having nightmares lately
And I'm sorry I fall asleep first

You make me wanna cry in a good way
You make me wanna cry in a good way
You make me wanna cry in a good way
You make me wanna cry in a good way

I didn't know that I was capable of being happy right now
But you showed me how
I didn't know that you were right in front of me
Until I looked out
