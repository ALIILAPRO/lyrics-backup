		  (Monthly, weekly, nightly and daily)
(If I'm falling, baby, don't blame me)
(If I'm falling, baby, don't blame me)

Six months just gone
First words on the tip of my tongue
Hello, where you from?
It's some joke that you do, it's so dumb
Oh my god, I've been missing you, like
Oh my god, I've been wishing that I could go back

Throw your body on mine
Throw your body on mine, now
Out of my hands, out of my hands
Out of my hands

Can you blame me?
For thinking 'bout, thinking 'bout, thinking 'bout, thinking 'bout you
Naked
Look at you, look at you, look at you, looking like a
Daydream
On my mind, on my mind, on my mind, on my mind

Monthly, weekly, nightly and daily
If I'm falling, baby, don't blame me
If I'm falling, baby, don't blame me

New place, you moved on
And moved in, tell me, baby, don't call (don't call)
But still text, like your not
A next phone, you thinkin' 'bout your bedside 
Fall straight down, you ain't taking a risk
You know damn well that there's always a chance, we go back

Throw your body on mine
Throw your body on mine, now
Out of my hands, out of my hands
Out of my hands

Can you blame me?
For thinking 'bout, thinking 'bout, thinking 'bout, thinking 'bout you
Naked
Look at you, look at you, look at you, looking like a
Daydream
On my mind, on my mind, on my mind, on my mind

Monthly, weekly, nightly and daily
If I'm falling, baby, don't blame me
If I'm falling, baby, don't blame me
Monthly, weekly, nightly and daily
If I'm falling, baby, don't blame me

Blame me?
For thinking 'bout, thinking 'bout, thinking 'bout, thinking 'bout you
Naked
Look at you, look at you, look at you, looking like a
Daydream
On my mind, on my mind, on my mind, on my mind

Monthly, weekly, nightly and daily
If I'm falling, baby, don't blame me
