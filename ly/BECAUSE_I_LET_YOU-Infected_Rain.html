		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Feeling lost again, I'm feeling down
I'm suffocating while you watch me drown
Like a candle, flickering weak
It's hard to breathe, it's hard to speak

Love! A thorny rose with petals red
It feels so good, it hurts so bad
Love! A thorny rose with petals red
It feels so good, it hurts so bad

Trapped in a cycle of pain profound
You are so deaf to my moanful sound
I had a feeling, I just knew
This is my doing, I just let you

A curse that brings happiness and sorrow
A light that shines today but fades tomorrow

We trust and give our hearts away
To those who ignore our needs everyday

Love! A thorny rose with petals red
It feels so good, it hurts so bad
Love! A thorny rose with petals red
It feels so good, it hurts so bad

Cut me open and see
The raw version of me
Cut me open and see
The raw version of me

Love! A thorny rose with petals red
It feels so good, it hurts so bad
Like a double-ended sword
So much work with no reward

Cut me open and see the shades of blue
A reflection of the pain I've been through
The pain I've been through, see the shades of blue

I had a feeling, I just knew
This is my doing, I just let you
This is my doing, I just let you

Love! A thorny rose with petals red
It feels so good, it hurts so bad
Like a double-ended sword
So much work with no reward
Love! A thorny rose with petals red
It feels so good, it hurts so bad
Like a double-ended sword
So much work with no reward
