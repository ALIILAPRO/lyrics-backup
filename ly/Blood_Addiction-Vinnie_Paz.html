		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I slaughtered and slaughtered, then fathered the father of Hiram
Enhance him, I'm Brody and all of the strongest of gaijin
I walk on the water and fall in the Czarkham asylum
Mind of Einstein combined with the heart of a lion
How you think the social media equal to grinding?
I ain't playing with you people, 'cause people is dying
Leave this motherfucker leaking, don't even revive him
Not standing for truth, cause the e-equal is lying
Refer to the murder of herd as no longer adjacent
I'll turn this gray man cave to a burgundy basement
Refer to the word of the Earth as the perfect displacement
Chief black Thunderbird is no longer a Mason
How you call yourself God when you talk like a vagrant?
Put your hand on the Qur'an and then alter your statement
Rhyme cheetah, swine eater, he calling for bacon
I be in Saks Fifth, having this all for the taking

I keep a couple ratchets in the Louis duffle
I keep a hundred rats inside the Louis duffle
I run inside of Saks and got the Louis duffle
The Book of Law, .44 in the Louis duffle

You keep the truth from a thinker and he find it regardless
The only son of Osiris was resigned to the Godless
The master was teacher and teacher, the father of time
You know what happened to the seven MCs in the line?
You could call it proficiency or call it design
You could call it a gift in me or call it a shrine
You could call it malignancy, the thought of you dying
I pray to God that he christen me and offer the wine
The mental, the father, supporter that follow the craft
The end of the honor, the order of Solomon's wrath
The sender, the armor, the slaughter, the fall of Shahbaz
The lender, the ender, the fallen, the fall of the crash
He knew that he would be murdered, so he went to Tibet
They hid a personal word in the T-Temple Aset
There's an unholy clutch in the fifth and the four
Superhuman intelligent prediction of war

I keep a couple ratchets in the Louis duffle
I keep a hundred ratchets outside the Louis duffle
I run inside of Saks and got the Louis duffle
The book of Law, .44 in the Louis duffle

Die motherfucker die, die motherfucker die
Die motherfucker die, die motherfucker die
Yeah, yeah, listen
I will utter the things
Which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world
There is nothing buried that will not be raised up
I am God, I am the monster
My son is the father and the father is my son
Marciano, Raise the gates
