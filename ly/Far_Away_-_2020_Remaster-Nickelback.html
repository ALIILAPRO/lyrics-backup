		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This time, this place, misused, mistakes
Too long, too late, who was I to make you wait?
Just one chance, just one breath
Just in case there's just one left
'Cause you know, you know, you know

I love you, I have loved you all along and I miss you
Been far away for far too long
I keep dreaming you'll be with me and you'll never go
Stop breathing if I don't see you anymore

On my knees, I'll ask, "Last chance for one last dance?"
'Cause with you, I'd withstand
All of hell to hold your hand
I'd give it all I'd give for us
Give anything, but I won't give up
'Cause you know you know, you know

I love you, I have loved you all along and I miss you
Been far away for far too long
I keep dreaming you'll be with me and you'll never go
Stop breathing if I don't see you anymore

So far away, so far away
Been far away for far too long
So far away, so far away
Been far away for far too long
But you know, you know, you know

I wanted, I wanted you to stay
'Cause I needed, I need to hear you say
I love you (I love you), I have loved you all along
And I forgive you (I forgive you) for being away for far too long

So keep breathing, 'cause I'm not leaving you anymore
Believe it, hold on to me and never let me go
Keep breathing, 'cause I'm not leaving you anymore
Believe it, hold on to me and never let me go
Keep breathing
Hold on to me and never let me go 
Keep breathing
Hold on to me and never let me go
