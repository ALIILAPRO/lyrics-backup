		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My girl's like candy, a candy treat
She knocks me right up off my feet
She's so fine as can be
It's like a perfect harmony

Candy girl
You are my world
You look so sweet
Come back to me
All I know
When I'm with her

You got the right stuff, baby
Love the way you turn me on (oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)
You got the right stuff, baby
You're the reason why I sing this song

You're all I ever wanted (baby, you're all) 
You're all I ever needed, yeah
So tell me what to do now
When I want (I want you) you back

Doom, doom, doom, da-dab
Doom, doom, doom, da-dab
Hey, yeah-yeah-yeah-dab
Da-dab
BroZone's back, alright!

Whether you're a mother or whether you're a brother
You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Feel the city breakin' and everybody shakin'
People stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ah, ah, ah (BroZone's really back again)
Stayin' alive, stayin' alive

Doom, doom, doom, da-dab
Doom, doom, doom, da-dab
I want you back
