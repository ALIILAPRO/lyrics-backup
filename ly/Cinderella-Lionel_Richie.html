		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  As I was walking down a
Path in the woods one day I
Came across a vision that 
Caught my eye

There was a lady standing
Right there beside a well
And I heard her whisper
What you wish for you can have

Then the vision went away
I thought that I had lost her
The girl I had been waiting for
I can't believe I just saw her
She is the finest thing, I ever could imagine
Now I want her next to me, 'cause I want, 'cause I want more
Whoah

Come to me my Cinderella 
Straight to my wishing well and
You're the one I'll always cherish
I ya ya ya ya ya
Come to me my Cinderella
Straight to my wishing well and
You're the one I'll love forever
I ya ya ya ya ya 

She is a gentle flower, she is the sun and rain and
She could be the reason for my joy and my pain
The first thing I see each morning, last thing I see at night
You know if I could have all that
That's all I wish for in my life

Why did she have to go
What do I say to find her
This girl is the only one
I just cannot deny her
She's making love to my mind
And I can't forget this feeling
It's her voice that's calling
It's her voice I need
Whoahhh

Come to me my Cinderella 
Straight to my wishing well and
You're the one I'll always cherish
I ya ya ya ya ya
Come to me my Cinderella
Straight to my wishing well and
You're the one I'll love forever
I ya ya ya ya ya 

Oh Cinderella
Oh Cinderella
Oh Cinderella
You're all that I want
You're all that I need
Come back to me now
Cinderella, Cinderalla, oh, oh yeah

Come to me my Cinderella 
Straight to my wishing well and
You're the one I'll always cherish
I ya ya ya ya ya
Come to me my Cinderella
Straight to my wishing well and
You're the one I'll love forever
I ya ya ya ya ya
Come to me my Cinderella 
Straight to my wishing well and
You're the one I'll always cherish
I ya ya ya ya ya
Come to me my Cinderella
Straight to my wishing well and
You're the one I'll love forever
I ya ya ya ya ya
