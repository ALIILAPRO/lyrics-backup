		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There are times when I've wondered
And times when I've cried
When my prayers they were answered
At times when I've lied
But if you asked me a question
Would I tell you the truth?
Now there's something to bet on
You've got nothing to lose, yeah

When I've sat by the window
And gazed at the rain
With an ache in my heart
But never feeling the pain
If you would tell me
Just what my life means
Walking a long road
Never reaching the end

God, give me the answer to my life
God, give me the answer to my dreams
God, give me the answer to my prayers
God, give me the answer to my being
