		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I never thought that you'd explode through my eyes 
I never ever was amused, deliver down on your knees 
I never wanted to be alone
Good God, I'd love to, well, I had to

I never thought that you'd implode trough my mind 
I always wanted to be abused
I lied psychic spy, I never wanted to be alone
Good God, I'd love to, well, I had to

You are real sometimes, you are unreal
Ceilings peel sometimes

I never thought that you'd explode through my eyes 
I never ever was amused
I lied psychic spy, I never wanted to be alone
I'd love to, well, I had to
