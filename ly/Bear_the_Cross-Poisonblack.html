		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  ""\""Carpe Diem?\""  Lame spirits beaten by this love Countless times have given in surrendered Worthlessness weights heavy on the hearts And pleas for life to wake up seem to echo in vain And slowly we bury our pain  Bear this cross for the rest of our time With trust forsaking us Blame is braking us Is this all truly worth of our lies? Together we stand alone  Bear this cross for the rest of these lives We both know we're coming back Yeah we're coming back Is this all truly worth of our cries? Together we die alone  Moaning in this pseudo-happiness Where the shit stained teeth fake a smile Keeping everything locked within When true tears are reliving And the warmth of an embrace not a threat And slowly we bury our dead  Bear this cross for the rest of our time With trust forsaking us Blame is braking us Is this all truly worth of our lies? Together we stand alone  Bear this cross for the rest of these lives We both know we're coming back Yeah we're coming back Is this all truly worth of our cries? Together we die alone  (Bear this cross for the rest of our time)  Bear this cross for the rest of our time With trust forsaking us Blame is braking us Is this all truly worth of our lies? Together we stand alone  Bear this cross for the rest of these lives We both know we're coming back Yeah we're coming back Is this all truly worth of our cries? Together we die alone""
