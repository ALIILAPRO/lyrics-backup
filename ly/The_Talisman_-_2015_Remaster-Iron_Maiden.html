		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I stand and look about the port
And contemplate my life
Will I ever see my countrymen again?

As the captain calls us on the deck
I take my things and walk to the harborside
I glance back one last time

Fleeing our nation
Our problems we leave behind
Ships by the tenfold sail out on the tide
We are pleased to be out and embracing the open sea
Free from our troubles and more free from thee

Inheritors unfulfilled reason behind us
We flee from what is not what is will be
We flee the earth and face our harsh reality
Will death be low mist that hangs on the sea?

We run from the evil tongues
Rash judgements, selfish men
Never to be seen on these shores again

As we sail into ocean size
And lose sight of land
A face of contentment around in the air
We're off now to seek all our fortunes
To the land of our dreams

Riding the waves and the storm is upon us
The winds lash the sails
But the ropes keep them tight
Off in the distance a dark cloud approaching
None could imagine what there was to come

No, there's no one going back
No, there's not a second chance
As we strap onto the side
We pray to God that we won't die

As we ride the rough seas
As we soak from the ocean waves
I just hope for all our lives
And pray that I survive

Four ships are lost in the stormy conditions
The spirits of the sunken crews
Their phantoms follow us

Spirits sails, they drive us on
Through the all consuming waves
Cold mortality, no weapon
Against these ever raging seas

Four leagues and ten and we hit storms again
We just can't get away from the eye of the storm
The birds outsoar the raging storm
But we cannot escape it
Abandoned earth, that we now crave
Is many leagues from safe

Holding on for our dear lives
And we're praying once again
Rotten luck or just jonahed?
The talisman is in my hand

Limbs fatigues, trembling with cold
Blinded from the sea spray salt
Clasping anything we can hold
Heaven's rain upon us falls

Twenty days without a meal
And ten without fresh water still
Those that didn't die in storms
The scurvy rest did slaughter

Westwards the tide
Westwards we sail on
Westwards the tide
Sail by the talisman

We approach the other side
Of the ocean with the tide
In our favor just for once
Welcome greeting our new land
The elation in our hearts
The excitement in our veins
As we sail towards the coastline
Of our golden promised land

Weary limbs fatigued away
I have no life left in me
No more strength and nothing left to give
Must find the will to live

Never thought that we could make it
Truly sight of shores divine
The sickness I am dying from
Never wanted it to end this way

Westwards the tide
Westwards we sail on
Westwards the tide
Sail by the talisman

Westwards the tide
Westwards we sail
Westwards the tide
Sail by the talisman
