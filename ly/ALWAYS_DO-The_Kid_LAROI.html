		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Said I wouldn't drink, but I did, same day
Shit, I lied to your face like I always do
Said I was gon' change, both know that I can't
Shit, I'd rather take the blame like I always do
I been the same ever since the first day
Now you actin' surprised, but bitch, you always knew
Maybe it's time for me to find somebody else
Like I always do

I know you can't believe me 'cause I never tell the truth but, oh
I wish that you could just see that it's only to protect you, no
How many times can somebody want the same pain?
When the pressure put on me, then I change lanes
And every time that I run, I know you gon' chase
We always end up right back in the same place

You, wastin' all my time with you
Wishin' I was someone new
Stuck up in my ways and
You say that you hate it, but you always knew

Said I wouldn't drink, but I did, same day
Shit, I lied to your face like I always do
Said I was gon' change, both know that I can't
Shit, I'd rather take the blame like I always do
I been the same ever since the first day
Now you actin' surprised, but bitch, you always knew
Maybe it's time for me to find somebody else
Like I always do

Do, do, do, do, do, uh, like I always
Do, do, do, do, do, do, like I always do

I'm sorry, I can't be the me you wanted
I'm about to fall, and you're all in
I'm not the one to solve your problems
'Cause I'm fucked up too

Wastin' all my time with you
Wishin' I was someone new
Stuck up in my ways and
You say that you hate it, but you always knew

Said I wouldn't drink, but I did, same day
Shit, I lied to your face like I always do
Said I was gon' change, both know that I can't
Shit, I'd rather take the blame like I always do
I've been the same ever since the first day
Now you actin' surprised, but bitch, you always knew
Maybe it's time for me to find somebody else
Like I always do

Do, do, do, do, do, uh, like I always
Do, do, do, do, do, do, like I always do
