		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The greatest love stories start with two lines on a stick in a bathroom
No one can take the feeling I felt when I first learned about you
Now my heart has a hole the size of your handprint, that I can't wait to hold

I would've given up everything
I would've taken your wings
And Ill pray to God to send you back just one more time

You are the smallest thing I've loved but the biggest heartbreak
My little angel from above, and it makes my heart ache
But I can't wait to hold

I would've given up everything
I would've taken your wings
And Ill pray to God to send you back just one more time

I would've given up everything
I would've taken your wings
And Ill pray to God to send you back one more time

I would've given up everything
I would've taken your wings
And Ill beg to God to give you back just one more time.
