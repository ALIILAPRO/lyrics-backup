		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I miss driving in the HOV just you and me, don't hurry
I miss dinners that we wouldn't eat cause it wasn't cheap, don't worry
I miss all the little things that we did but didn't notice
You never know a good thing until it's gone
I miss driving in the HOV now life moves somewhat slowly
Thinking back on the day when we packed the Jetta
Drove to the unknown we don't know no better
You and me against the world that's the new vendetta
Was the only thing sane to do
Type of mood swing that could change the weather
Hot cold, hot cold, sweating through my sweater
Back and forth, back and forth, how a tie get severed
Was the only way to cut you lose
No U-turns
My fault that I put you first
Broken heart, you took two thirds
Guess that makes me the loser huh
Zero Mileage
Brand new speakers driving
Still I sit in silence
Thinking about you
I miss driving in the HOV just you and me, don't hurry
I miss dinners that we wouldn't eat cause it wasn't cheap, don't worry
I miss all the little things that we did but didn't notice
You never know a good thing until it's gone
I miss driving in the HOV now life moves somewhat slowly
I remember the day I said I loved you and you said it back
I guess you're happy now, how could I be upset with that
Go from talking every day to no message back
How you go from letting me pay to a separate tab
You even met my parents before you flew the coup
You made me think of marriage just like the movies do
My momma said I got a good one
My pops said it too
I told them bout the one that got away
But never told them it was you, you, you
All that time yeah it was you, you, you
I miss driving in the HOV just you and me, don't hurry
I miss dinners that we wouldn't eat cause it wasn't cheap, don't worry
I miss all the little things that we did but didn't notice
You never know a good thing until it's gone
I miss driving in the HOV now life moves somewhat slowly
