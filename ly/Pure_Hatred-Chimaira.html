		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I have told you things need to change
You never listened or came to my aid
The vicious cycle has not changed
My times spent rearranged

Mother fuck it all
I can't stand this
Remember then I said
Everyone makes me sick
Well nothing has changed

I hate everyone

The vicious cycle still remains
Constant cluster fuck, bloodstains
Ignorance, you kill for God
Expression not allowed

You fucked it up
With your motherfucking games
Remember when I said
I was so ashamed
Well nothing has changed

You have to
Pick and choose your fights
You have to
Come out of this alive

I have told you things need to change
You never listened, never came to my aid
The vicious cycle still not changed
My judgment fades away

You'll never change me
Remember we are through
I am staying here
To betray all of you
And nothing will change
