		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I swear it is true
The past isn't dead
It's alive, it is happening
In the back of my head

No future, no past
No laws of time
Can undo what is happening
When I close my eyes
With the stars and the moon
I woke up in the night

In the same place, no
It's sailing before my eyes
It's happening, it's happening, it's happening
It's happening, it's happening, yeah

It's happening, it's happening, it's happening
It's happening, it's happening, yeah

I took a day or two 
To exile from the light 
To unfold that prisoner
They call a mind

And for a brief moment
We could stop the time
But with the stars and the moon
I woke up in the night

In the same place, no
It's sailing before my eyes
It's happening, it's happening, it's happening
It's happening, it's happening, it's happening, it's happening, it's happening
