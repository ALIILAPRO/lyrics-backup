		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And I wanna wake up in your white, white sun
And I wanna wake up in your world with no pain
But I'll just suffer in a hope to die someday
While you are numb all of the way

When I hate it, I know I can feel
But when you love, you know it's not real, no
When I hate it, I know I can feel
But when you love, you know it's not real

And I'm resigned to this wicked fucking world
On its way to hell
Living are dead and I hope to join them too
I know what to do and I do it well

When I hate it, I know I can feel
But when you love, you know it's not real, no
When I hate it, I know I can feel
But when you love, you know it's not real, wow

Shoot myself to love you
If I loved myself, I'd be shooting you
Yeah, shoot myself to love you
If I loved myself, I'd be shooting you
Yeah, shoot myself to love you
If I loved myself, I'd be shooting you
Yeah, shoot myself to love you
If I loved myself, I'd be shooting you
If I loved myself, I'd be shooting you
Yeah, shoot myself to love you
If I loved myself, I'd be shooting you
Yeah, shoot myself to love you
If I loved myself, I'd be shooting you
Yeah, shoot myself to love you
