		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Cook that shit up, Quay

I'm back on
I invested in myself, that mean I'm black owned
I dig this from out the trenches, that's my backbone
Free lil' bro he gone again, he just came back home
Make my money match my outfit, I got racks on
Had to cut off all the leeches tryna latch on
Watch my man run up 200 off a trap phone
Let my dogs handle the business, I'ma rap on
We put this inside our glizzys, call 'em strap ons
If you ever disrespecting, you get slapped on
I done really ran my check up off of rap songs
Everything I say no cap even with my hat on
Got caught up in a brawl, I was with a redbone
Then I plead the fifth, put on my headphones
Looking at my bitch I know I'm dead wrong
I'ma keep this pimpin' 'til my headstone
Still talking in codes on the jail phone
Tryna say lil' bruh a rat but who we tell on
It's whatever, with whoever how we gon' come
We don't play in no band but we got sticks and drums, they go dun-dun-dun

Hopping out the Bentley truck, we known for acting stupid
Yesterday went 4x4, today I'm feeling coupe
I put diamonds on my neck and wrist, and even on my tooth
Got the penthouse at the top, the helicopter on the roof
Told lil' bruh don't take his ski mask off, he just might have to shoot
I ain't fucking with these rappers lowkey niggas really groupie
Told lil' bruh don't take his ski mask off, he just might have to shoot
I ain't fucking with these rappers lowkey niggas really groupie

I can't have my way with one I rather hit 'em in a group
I know niggas who bang red and know I'm standing on what's blue
You remember we was stuck, we had to come up on the move
You remember with Lil' Dugg and we had came up on the news
Five lines said she love me, I lied back "I love you too"
She want money for her pussy, no complaints is what I do
Why you tripping in your feelings? Really you a prostitute
No back and forth, I'm blocking you
Find me something else to do
I'm in Calabasas having dinner with my actress boo
I got superstars texting talking 'bout "I'm mad at you"
And my other vibe say my other vibe subbin' her
She ain't even stunt her, she can't even compare to her, yeah

Hopping out the Bentley truck, we known for acting stupid
Yesterday went 4x4, today I'm feeling coupe
I put diamonds on my neck and wrist, and even on my tooth
Got the penthouse at the top, the helicopter on the roof
Told lil' bruh don't take his ski mask off, he just might have to shoot
I ain't fucking with these rappers lowkey niggas really groupie
Told lil' bruh don't take his ski mask off, he just might have to shoot
I ain't fucking with these rappers lowkey niggas really groupie, yeah
