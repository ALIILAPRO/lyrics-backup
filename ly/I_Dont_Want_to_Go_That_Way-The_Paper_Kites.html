		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't want to go that way anymore
I don't want to go that way anymore
There's a darkness coming down
Waiting at my door
I don't want to go that way anymore

I don't want to walk that road anymore
I don't want to walk that road anymore
I don't see no lights
I don't hear no call
I don't want to walk that road anymore

Turn me to your song
Turn me to your door
I don't want to go that way anymore
Yeah, yeah
