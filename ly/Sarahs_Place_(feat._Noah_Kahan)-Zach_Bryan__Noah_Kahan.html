		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Road dogs are built for sleepin' in
I've been up since 4 AM
At your worst, you're better than my better days
There ain't been no sun in LA
Since you moved out of Sarah's place

I love your mother's stories 'bout you as a kid
I heard you scored a job in the east village
While working for some folks who don't know your name
Well, ain't you gonna miss all of them wasted days?
We'd sit around, drinkin' out at Sarah's place

Don't come back lover, I'm proud you're under the skyline
We always knew you were the better half of our good times
Those backyard lights don't shine as bright without your face
Out at Sarah's Place

And you called to talk just last week
I'm still fallin' apart like I'll always be
And your picnic chair is still sittin' there in the yard
And I had to sell my old guitar

But don't come back lover, I'm proud you're under the skyline
We always knew you were the better half of our good times
Those backyard lights don't shine as bright without your face
Out at Sarah's Place

You'll always be a piece of mine, a piece of mine
We drove that road we know at least a million times
I'm so damn tired of seeing that empty drive
Out at Sarah's Place

Don't come back lover, I'm proud you're under the skyline
We always knew you were the better half of our good times
Those backyard lights don't shine as bright without your face
Out at Sarah's Place

Hey

Plane tickets have gotten awfully expensive
But I got mine for the price of a Gibson
