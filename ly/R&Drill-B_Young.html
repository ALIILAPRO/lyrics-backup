		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby suttin' ain't right
Always tryna hit the brake light
Saying fuck love you wana waste time
But when you're waved you hit my main line
Hmm 
Girl you know I'll always make time
When you wanna smoke and get high 
Anytime you hit the Face Time,
I'll roll one we can catch the same flight 
Hmm 

Don't be afraid to say that you love me 
Girl it's okay you don't have to be low key, Don't be ashamed to say that you need me 
Show me your pain girl I'll raise you up quickly 
Don't be afraid to say that you love me 
Girl it's okay you don't have to be low key  Don't be ashamed to say that you need me 
Show me your pain girl I'll raise you up quickly 
You know 

You say you've seen some better days but all that changed when I'm with you 
Baby tell me how you feeling 
Hmm 
Is shit the same when I'm with you?
So baby hit me when you get the chance 
When you need love come take mine
Been around and I've seen shit 
Trust me girl we on the same side 
Trust me girl we on the same time 
Hit me up we'll exchange minds 
You can hit me on that late night 
I don't mind losing some sleep keep me energised 
Girl there's more meets the eye, no need to lie 
We both know you're a freak you just in disguise 

Don't be afraid to say that you love me 
Girl it's okay you don't have to be low key Don't be ashamed to say that you need me 
Show me your pain girl I'll raise you up quickly 
Don't be afraid to say that you love me 
Girl it's okay you don't have to be low key  Don't be ashamed to say that you need me 
Show me your pain girl I'll raise you up quickly 

Baby suttin' ain't right
Always trying to hit the brake light  
Saying fuck love you wana waste time
But when you're waved you hit my main line
Hmm 
Girl you know I'll always make time
When you wanna smoke and get high 
Anytime you hit the face time,
I'll roll one we can catch the same flight 
Hmm
