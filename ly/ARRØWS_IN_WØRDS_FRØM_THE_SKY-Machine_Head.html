		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Break the silence
The clouds liftin' the dawn inside my mind
Is the darkness casting a reflection?
Staring at a broken mirror wanting
Can't ever realize
You say that you believe
But do you know the reason why?
Centuries of pain, under a paper sword
Arrows in words from the sky

Breaking dawn, I am reborn
Right the wrong, the ark of justice
Holding on, by a thread I'll
Carry on, and rise above this pain

How you gently strip my confidence away
How your sweet caress is black and blue and gray
Archers at the ready, bows drawn aiming high
Arrows in words from the sky

Buried songs
Anthems to a frozen sun
Her cold will strengthen
Fighting on (this war, no more)
Lift up your brother
Night is long (my heart, so dark)
Keep pushing through this pain

How you gently strip my confidence away
How your sweet caress is black and blue and gray
Archers at the ready, bows drawn aiming high
Arrows in words from the sky

The sky is darkest just before the dawn, so keep the faith
And wipe away your tears and I'll wipe the spit off of your face
A spirit's buried inside, you were meant to shine a light
Glow incandescent, let them fear the fire burning bright

Shine, burn your fire
Bright, burn away the pain

How you gently strip my confidence away
How your sweet caress is black and blue and gray
Archers at the ready, bows drawn aiming high
Arrows, pain

How you gently strip my confidence away
How your sweet caress is black and blue and gray
Archers at the ready, bows drawn aiming high
Arrows in words from the sky
