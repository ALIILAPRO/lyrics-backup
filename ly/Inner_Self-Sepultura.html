		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Walking these dirty streets
With hate in my mind
Feeling the scorn of the world
I won't follow rules

Blame and lies, contradictions arise
Blame and lies, contradictions arise

Nonconformity in my inner self
Only I guide my inner self

I won't change my way
It has to be this way
I live my life for myself
Forget your filthy ways

Blame and lies, contradictions arise
Blame and lies, contradictions arise

Nobody will change my way
Life betrays, but I keep on going
There's no light, but there is hope
Crushing oppression, I win

Betraying, playing dirty, you think you'll win
But someday you'll fall, and I'll be waiting

Laughs of an insane man, you'll hear
Personality is my weapon against your envy

Walking these dirty streets
With hate in my mind
Feeling all the scorn of the world
I won't follow your rules

Nonconformity in my inner self
Only I guide my inner self
