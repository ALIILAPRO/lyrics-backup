		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And when the lights come down
I wanna feel you standing next to me
And can you hear me out?
There's a lifetime in front of me
And when my time runs out
I wanna feel you standing next to me

Baby, I knew this time would arrive
I knew this time would come
Ever since I first looked in your eyes
I said, "You're the one"
Oh my God, oh my God
Tell me I'm the one
Oh my God, oh my God

I wanna feel you standing next to me

Late in the evening when the sun comes down
Under the starlight as the birds fly by
I see the dust fill the twilight skies
I feel the warmth of your hand in mine
It's in the air, it's in the air
It's in the air we breathe
It's all around, it's all around us now

And when the lights come down
I wanna feel you standing next to me
And can you hear me out?
There's a lifetime in front of me
And when my time runs out
I wanna feel you standing next to me

Baby, I knew this time would arrive
I knew this time would come
Ever since I first looked in your eyes
I said, "You're the one"
Oh my God, oh my God
Tell me I'm the one
Oh my God, oh my God

I wanna feel you standing next to me

And when the lights come down
I wanna feel you standing next to me
