		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lady
I'm your knight in shining armor, and I love you
You have made me what I am, and I'm yours
My love
There's so many ways I want to say I love you
Let me hold you in my arms forever more

You have gone, and made me search a fool
I'm so lost in your love
And oh, we belong together
But won't you believe in my song
(In my song)

Lady
For so many years I thought I'd never find you
You have come into my life, and changed me more
Forever
Let me wait to see you each and every morning
Let me hear you whisper something in my ear

In my eyes, I see no one else but you
There's no other love like my love
And yes
I'll always want you near me
I've waited for you for so long
(For so long)

Lady
Your love's the only love I need
And beside me
Is where I want you to be
(Want you to be)
'Cause my love
(My love)
There's something I want you to know
(want you to know)
You're the love of my life
You're my lady

Lady
Your love's the only love I need
And beside me
Is where I want you to be.
