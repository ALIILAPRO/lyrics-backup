		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I just want to pick you up, can it go down?
Hit you in the backseat, can it go down?
I just want to pick you up, can it go down?
Hit you in the backseat, can it go down?
Can it go down, baby, can it go down?
Girl, you a dixie when it go down
Hit you in the backseat, when it went down
When it goes down

In the back of that Rolls Royce, yeah, I been talkin' less (hey)
Okay, he say, and she say, but that's all for the flex
Okay, she saves my keepsakes, but that's all for the sex
And then ran into homegirl, like, "God damn, what's next?"
Went and turned around back in the crib 'cause she didn't read my text
I know there's something there about you baby, but you couldn't clean my mess
So I walked out with my hoodie on, and I'm lowkey in that Lex'
And I couldn't be your favorite, baby, now I'm new and I'm your best
Baby, take my hand
I wanna be your man
I need you to understand
Show you I can, show you I can
(Can it go down?)

I just want to pick you up, can it go down?
Hit you in the backseat, can it go down?
I just want to pick you up, can it go down?
Hit you in the backseat, can it go down?
Can it go down, baby, can it go down?
Girl, you a dixie when it go down
Hit you in the backseat, when it went down
When it goes down

Twenty-five, to life a certified lover
Keep me cool, she keep me cool undercover
Backseat, I never ever used a rubber
I'm in H-Town, it's goin' down, sip the syrup tonight
And I wanna be here for the rest of my life
And I pray to God it's here just for one night
You know I beat it when you call me, I'll ride
You know I wanna ride up springers tonight
For the rest of my life
I'm on the southside, need it tonight
It'll be one hell of a night
(Can it go down?)

Hey
You know you got it, I love that shit
You know I want it, no lying
I can fuck you in the backseat, backseat, backseat
I can fuck you in the backseat, backseat, backseat
You know you got it
Woah, is it something that I need to know?
We been' sippin', screwin', movin' slow
Shawty in here callin' my name
Got my ice and my jewels on, I'll fuck you all night long
Lonely, I been waiting, you finna have my baby
Don't touch my hand, baby
I can do it on my own
lay you on the mattress and get tragic
Can fuck you in the backseat
Can fuck you in the backseat
I can fuck you in the backseat, backseat, backseat
I can fuck you in the backseat, backseat, backseat
(Can it go down?)
