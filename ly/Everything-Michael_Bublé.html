		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're a falling star, you're the getaway car
You're the line in the sand when I go too far
You're the swimming pool on an August day
And you're the perfect thing to say

And you play it coy, but it's kinda cute
Oh, when you smile at me, you know exactly what you do
Baby, don't pretend that you don't know it's true
'Cause you can see it when I look at you

And in this crazy life
And through these crazy times
It's you, it's you, you make me sing
You're every line, you're every word
You're everything

You're a carousel, you're a wishing well
And you light me up when you ring my bell
You're a mystery, you're from outer space
You're every minute of my every day

And I can't believe, uh, that I'm your man
And I get to kiss you, baby, just because I can
Whatever comes our way, oh, we'll see it through
And you know that's what our love can do

And in this crazy life
And through these crazy times
It's you, it's you, you make me sing
You're every line, you're every word
You're everything

So, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
So, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

And in this crazy life
And through these crazy times
It's you, it's you, you make me sing
You're every line, you're every word
You're everything

You're every song, and I sing along
'Cause you're my everything
Yeah, yeah

So, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
So, la, la, la, la, la, la-la-la, la-la-la
