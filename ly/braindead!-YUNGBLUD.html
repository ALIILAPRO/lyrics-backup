		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I just wanna be pretty brain-dead
I just wanna be pretty brain-dead
I just wanna be pretty brain-dead
I just wanna be, pretty brain dead!
I just wanna be pretty brain-dead
I just wanna be pretty brain-dead
I just wanna be pretty brain-dead
I just wanna be, pretty brain dead!

You lock me out, you lock me in
You smoke my soul and I can't win
It's over now, before it begins
Just suck this salt to cleanse your sins
If I can't speak about the things
That make me sad, then I am weak
But I'm not strong either
I'm just a kid with a cold pretendin' it's a fever

I just wanna be pretty brain-dead
I just wanna be pretty brain-dead
I just wanna be pretty brain-dead
I just wanna be, pretty brain dead!

The mystery is not that hard
When you can read between the bars
Tongue trip's over, your fickle cheek
With the lies you tell and the shit you speak
I think you should clean your teeth
With guilty truths and liar's bleach
Adjusting the lighting
So I can't see the scars on your face fucking hiding

They find it hard to love you, no matter what they say
They're tryna get above you while laughing in your face
They find it hard to love you, no matter what they say
They're tryna get above you while laughing in your face

I just wanna be pretty brain-dead
I just wanna be pretty brain-dead
I just wanna be pretty brain-dead
I just wanna be, pretty brain dead!
I just wanna be pretty brain-dead
I just wanna be pretty brain-dead
I just wanna be pretty brain-dead
I just wanna be, pretty brain dead!
