		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh, ooh

It's been the longest winter without you
I didn't know where to turn to (ooh, ooh-oh)
See somehow I can't forget you
After all that we've been through (ooh, ooh-oh)

Going, coming
Thought I heard a knock (whose there? no one)
Thinking that (I deserve it)
And now I realize that I really didn't know (oh-ooh)

If you didn't notice
You mean everything (quickly, I'm learning)
To love again (all I know is)
I'ma be okay (oh ooh-oh)

Thought I couldn't live without you
It's gonna hurt when it heals too
Oh yeah (it'll all get better in time)
Even though I really love you
I'm gonna smile 'cause I deserve too
Ooh-ooh (it'll all get better in time)

How could I turn on the TV? (no, ooh-oh)
Without somethin' that'll remind me (ooh, ooh-oh)
Was it all that easy? (ooh, ooh-oh)
To just put aside your feelings (ooh, ooh-oh)
If I'm dreamin'
Don't want to let it (hurt my feelings)
But that's the past (I believe it)
And I know that, time will heal it (ooh, ooh-oh)

If you didn't notice
Well you mean everything (quickly I'm learning)
Ooh, to love again (all I know is)
I'ma be okay (ooh, ooh-oh)

Thought I couldn't live without you
It's gonna hurt when it heals, too
Oh yeah (it'll all get better in time)
Even though I really love you
I'm gonna smile 'cause I deserve too
Oh (it'll all get better in time)

Since there's no more you and me (no more you and me)
It's time I let you go so I can be free (ooh, ooh-oh)
And live my life how it should be (no no no, no no no)
No matter how hard it is, I'll be fine without you
Yes I will

Thought I couldn't live without you
It's gonna hurt when it heals, too
Oh, ooh-oh (it'll all get better in time)
Even though I really love you
I'm gonna smile 'cause I deserve too (yes I do)
(It'll all get better in time)

Thought I couldn't live without you
It's gonna hurt when it heals, too
Yes (it'll all get better in time)
Even though I really love you (ooh, ooh, ooh)
I'm gonna smile 'cause I deserve too
Oh (it'll all get better in time)
