		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I feel you like a sawed-off aimin' at my back 
So I take a walk and fight to turn my head 
Just one look and I'll remember too much 
I won't barely know how good it was 

But it's been so long 
Yeah, and I still get a feelin' 
So strong! 

You know you can't be mine! 
The story as the flames go wild 
Look at what a spark ignited, baby 
You got me playing with You got me playing with fire
Aye y-ya y-ya y-yeah You got me playing with 
You got me playing with fire, aye y-ya y-ya y-yeah 
 
Oh, you know the feeling 
When you love someone nothing good comes up
Yeah Oh, you're such a drug to me, 
Feels like ecstasy Followed by misery 

(Oh, but when we cross that line Yeah, it feels so right! 

You know you can't be mine! 
The story as the flames go wild Look at what a spark ignited
Baby You got me playing with You got me playing with fire
Aye y-ya y-ya y-yeah You got me playing with you got me playing with fire
Aye y-ya y-ya y-yeah 

I feel like a sawed-off aimin' 
At my back You pull the trigger
Put a bullet through my chest Girl
Your love is killing me slowly Pulling me so deep
Got me so lonely, baby 

You know you can't be mine
The story as the flames go wild Look at what a spark ignited
Baby You got me playing with You got me playing with fire
Aye y-ya y-ya y-yeah You got me playing with 
You got me playing with fire
Aye y-ya y-ya y-yeah
