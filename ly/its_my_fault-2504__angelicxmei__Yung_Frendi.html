		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (2504)
Tired of my heart
Demons in my head
I don't understand
How bad is it
Been gettin' hurt
Lying in the dirt
I guess I suck
I fucked up
Ain’t scared of dyin, but scared of livin
Can't forgive myself, someday I'll burn in hell (burn in hell…in hell)
Made countless stupid mistakes
Don't wanna get up again
It’s my fault, I’ll take that blame
(Yung Frendi)
i'll take the blame
baby you think it's a game
i might just swerve in the lot
gucci and louis, i bought 4 u
in my head, i got some thoughts of u
hop in my bed, girl it's room for two
i fw you girl, cuz u is so cool
you ask if I love you, baby yes I do
me and twintee on the track
baby I jus want chu back
why tf you had to leave though
i shoot my shot jus like a free throw
get to the money, casino
i went up in Saks, and copped me a mink coat
the bih is so bad but she for the team bro
you stealing my lingo, amigo
(2504)
Tired of my heart
Demons in my head
I don't understand
How bad is it
Been gettin' hurt
Lying in the dirt
I guess I suck
I fucked up
Ain’t scared of dyin, but scared of livin
Can't forgive myself, someday I'll burn in hell (burn in hell…in hell)
Made countless stupid mistakes
Don't wanna get up again
It’s my fault, I’ll take that blame
(angelicxmei)
is it really all my fault
i dont know but im steppin
i be slowly movin on
i be slowly recoverin
really wish i would be alright
really wish i could be online
baby im crying like all night
i need a ressurect
its just a mess i cannot doubt it
it doesnt make a sense, i cant fight it
im hollow and i thought that you would follow
sorrow, all i feel is just a sorrow
