		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fell in love with my lover
In the morning
Or maybe I fell
Long before you
Now I wonder
What lovers are missing
And how the name seems to
Mean passing through
It's a sad but maybe
A self-caused trouble
Perhaps I've been sad
Longer than you
I might have been
Fooling my lover
You have always been
So much more to me
I ain't got the heart babe
I ain't got the heart
Go with the morning
I'll stay with my heart
You know I was sent
For that morning
Or maybe it was the night
That threw me out
I ain't got the heart babe
I ain't got the heart
Go with the morning
I'll stay with my heart
