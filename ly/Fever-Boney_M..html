		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Never know how much I love you
Never know how much I care
When you put your arms around me
I get a fever, that's so hard to bear

You give me fever, when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever, in the morning
Fever all through the night

Sun lights up the daytime
Moon lights up the night
I light up when you call my name
And I know I'm gonna treat you right

You give me fever, when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever, in the morning
Fever all through the night

Everybody gots the fever [should be "everybody's got..."]
That is something you all know
Fever isn't such a new thing
Fever started long ago

Romeo loved Juliet
Juliet, she felt the same
When he put his arms around her
He said "Julie baby, you're my flame"

Thou givest fever, when he kisseth
Fever with thy flaming youth
Fever, I'm a fire
Fever, yeah I burn for thou

Captain Smith and Pocahontas
Had a very very mad affair
When her daddy tried to kill him
She said, "daddy, oh, don't you dare!"

You give me fever [should be "he gives me fever"]
With his kisses
Fever when he holds me tight
Fever, I'm his misses
Daddy, won't you treat him right?

Now you've listened to my story
Here's a point that I have made
Chicks were born to give you fever
Be it fahrenheit or centigrade

They give you fever, when you kiss them
Fever, if you live, you learn
Fever, 'till you sizzle
What a lovely way to burn

They give you fever, when you kiss them
Fever, if you live and learn
Fever, 'til you sizzle
What a lovely way to burn

What a lovely way to burn (they give you fever)
What a lovely way to burn (they give you fever)
What a lovely way to burn (they give you fever)
What a lovely way to burn (they give you fever)
What a lovely way to burn (they give you fever)
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
