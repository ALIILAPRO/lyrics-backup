		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm like begging for it, baby
Makes you wanna party
Wanna break up
Baby, it's violence, violence
Baby, it's violence

But you can't see what I see
You can't see what I see
Cause you, ha, ha
You feed off hurting me, hurting me, yeah, ha

I'm like begging for it, baby
Makes you wanna party, wanna wake up
Baby, it's violence, violence
Baby, it's violence

But you can't see what I see
You can't see what I see
Cause you, ha, ha
You feed off hurting me, off hurting me
Yeah, ha

You wanna make me bad
Make me bad
And I like it like that, and I like it like that
You wanna make me bad, pay me back
Said, "I like it like that," said, "I like it like that"

I'm like begging for it, baby
Makes you wanna party, wanna wake up
Baby, it's violence, violence
Baby, it's violence

But you can't see what I see
You can't see what I see
'Cause you, ha, ha
You feed off hurting me, off hurting me, oh, me, oh, me

You wanna make me bad, make me bad
And I like it like that, and I like it like that
You wanna paint me bad, pay me back
Said, "I like it like that," said, "I like it like that"
You wanna make me bad, make me bad
And I like it like that, and I like it like that
You wanna paint me bad, pay me back
Said, "I like it like that," said, "I like it like that"

You wanna, make me, make me, make me, make me, make me
And I like it like that, and I like it like that
You wanna pay me, pay me, pay me back, pay me back
Said, "I like it like that," said, "I like it like that"

(Me, oh, me, oh, me, oh, me, oh, me, oh)
And I like it like that, and I like it like that
(Me, oh, me, oh, me, oh, me, oh, me, oh)
And I like it like that
