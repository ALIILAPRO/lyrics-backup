		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ass getting bigger
Racks getting bigger
Cash getting larger
He thought he was loving me good
I told him go harder

She thought she was killing this shit
I told her go harder
Just look at this alkaline wrist
'Cause I got that water
Ass getting thicker
Cash getting thicker

That's that thick
That's that real shit
That's that jelly, baby
Champagne and cherry, baby
That's that thick
That's that ball drop
That's that keep going 
That's that never stop

That's that thick
That's that nana
That oochie-coochie-lala
Yeah, this that Fiji agua
Candy girl, piñata
Hit it in the car and take you back to the casa
Bet I got you rock now
That thick all over that yacht now

Uh, that's that Freaknik
That's that 1996
That's that moon Miami bass
Twelve in the trunk, 808
Uh, that's that Castro
Eat that shit like Maestro's
She say she on a diet
Girl, you better not lose that ass though

That's that thick
That's that real shit
That's that jelly, nigga
That's that really, nigga
That's that thick
That's that ball drop
That's that keep going 
That's that never stop

Baby, that's that thick
That's that thick
Baby, that's that thick
That's that thick
Look at this shit

Ooh, that's that strawberry
That's that grape, and cherry
Ooh, that's that Ginsu
Cut that bitch like culinary

(Ooh) that's that bounce
Spend my money, make it count
If he's lost, then he get found
Just keep dropping that shit down
That's that summer, that's them Hummers
That's that "Girl, give me your number"
That's that Jordy, that's that scholar
That "I just got out of college"
That's that "I don't do this usually
I don't know what you do to me"
That (I don't do this usually)
(I don't know what you do to me)

Boy, you crazy, body mean
Back it up like limousine
You gotta make a fold out to fit in magazine, right
Girl, look at your body, right

Boy, take this in slow, don't let go
And tell me how bad you've been wanting it
And hurry up, quick, before the moment ends
I like what I hear, might be sleeping in
Screaming, "Beyoncé chocolate"
Ounces, sit on that
Bounce it, bounce it

Ass getting thicker
Cash getting thicker
Cash getting larger
He thought he was loving me good
I told him go harder

Nigga, that's that thick
Thought she was killing this shit
I told her go harder
That's that thick, look at this alkaline wrist
'Cause I got that water
Baby, that's that thick, ass getting thicker
That's that thick, cash getting
Look at this shit

Ooh, baby
Come feel me (ooh, baby)
I'm all up in your mind (it's all yours)
Come here, come here
Let's make love
Make love to your mind (I wanna make love to your mind)
Make love to your mind (make love to your mind)
(Close your eyes) I'm all up in your mind
I'll breathe you in, I'll think your thoughts
I'll read your mind (I'll read your mind)
