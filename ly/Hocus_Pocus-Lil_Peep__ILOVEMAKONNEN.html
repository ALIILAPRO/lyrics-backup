		  Yeah
Yeah
(Moneyposse)
Oh, yeah

Just don't lose focus, no
Yeah, pay closer attention
Just don't lose focus, no
You need to pay more attention
You got it all, yeah
Sittin' right in front of you, uh
They want to fall, yeah
To be right on top of you
But don't lose focus, no
Don't lose focus
Just, just don't lose focus
Hocus Pocus, don't lose focus
No, don't lose focus
I'm doing magic on 'em, huh
Hocus Pocus, yeah

I see that red dragonfly Jeep, yeah
I pull through, y'all can ask Lil Peep, ayy
Every other hater try to weep (weep), yeah
Championship game, I'ma do a full sweep, huh

I can't feel no pain, I'm insane
All my demons watch me
You don't know my name, that's my fame
I'll do magic, watch me
Look me in my brain, it's a shame
All these people want me
Want me out the way, say I'm gay
But they really want me
I say what I say, it's no way
You can't get around it
I don't have no lane, not the same
This my swag, I found it

Just don't lose focus, no
Yeah, pay closer attention (attention)
Just don't lose focus (just don't lose focus), no (no)
You need to (yeah) pay more attention (attention)
You got it all, yeah
Sittin' right in front of you, uh
They want to fall, yeah
To be right on top of you (you)
But don't lose focus, no
Don't lose focus (don't lose focus)
Just, just don't lose focus
Hocus Pocus, don't lose focus
No, don't lose focus
I'm doing magic on 'em, huh
Hocus Pocus, yeah

(I'm doing magic on 'em, huh)
(Hocus Pocus, just don't lose focus)
