		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Beggin', beggin' you
Put your lovin' hand out, baby
Beggin', beggin' you
Put your lovin' hand out, darlin'
Ridin' high, when I was king
Played it hard and fast, cause I had everything
Walked away, wonderin' then
But easy come and easy go and it would end
Beggin', beggin' you
Put your lovin' hand out, baby
Beggin', beggin' you
Put your lovin' hand out, darlin'
Beggin', beggin' you
Put your lovin' hand out, baby
Beggin', beggin' you
Put your lovin' hand out, darlin'
An empty shell
I used to be
Shadow of my life was hangin' over me
A broken man
That I don't know
Will he withstand the devils chance
To win my soul
Beggin', beggin' you
Put your lovin' hand out, baby
Beggin', beggin' you
Put your lovin' hand out, darlin'
I'm fighting hard
To hold my own (Hold my own)
Just can't make it
All alone (All alone)
I'm holdin' on
I can't fall back
I'm just too calm not to fade to black
Beggin', beggin' you
Put your lovin' hand out, baby
Beggin', beggin' you
Put your lovin' hand out, darlin'
Beggin', beggin' you
Put your lovin' hand out, baby
Beggin', beggin' you
Put your lovin' hand out, darlin'
