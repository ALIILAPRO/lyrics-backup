		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Come on

Save some for me
It's what I like
I wanna play
You know it's time

Something is calling
I can't keep from falling
Come on
It's on

You see it's my fault
Angels stabbing me inside
Nothing changes, just rearranges 
For me this time

Once I cave in
What can I fight?
I can never win
Myself I don't like
I don't like, I don't like, I don't like

Something is calling
I can't keep falling
Come on
It's on

You see it's my fault
Angels stabbing me inside
Nothing changes, just rearranges 
For me this time

This time
This time
For me inside
Put me inside
Hold me this time
Put me inside

Come on
It's on
Come on
It's on
Come on
It's on
Come on
Come on
It's on
