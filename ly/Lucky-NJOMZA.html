		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let me say I love you right now
Give you all your flowers right now
I don't wanna wait 'til it's too late
Let me tell you how I'm so proud
Show you how I feel
I'll scream it loud
I don't wanna wait
'Til it's too late

'Cause after everything you had to go through
You still had the fight within you
And I can't believe that God chose me
To know you
To love you

I'm so lucky
If you love someone let them know
If you love someone let them know
Don't let them go
If you love someone let them know
If you love someone let them know
I'm so lucky
I'm so lucky
If you love someone let them know
If you love someone let them know
Don't let them go
Don't let them go
Don't let them go
Don't let them go
If you love someone let them know
If you love someone let them know

Wouldn't wanna do this solo
Just look at where we are
We came so far
You're the only one 
Who understands
I pray for the clock to move slow
When I'm with you I need nothing more
If you're feeling lost
Grab my hand

'Cause after everything you had to go through
You still had the fight within you
And I can't believe that God chose me
To know you
To love you

I'm so lucky
If you love someone let them know
If you love someone let them know
Don't let them go
If you love someone let them know
If you love someone let them know
I'm so lucky
I'm so lucky
If you love someone let them know
If you love someone let them know
Don't let them go
Don't let them go
Don't let them go
Don't let them go
If you love someone let them know
If you love someone let them know
