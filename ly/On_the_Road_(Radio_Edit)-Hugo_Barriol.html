		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm sitting on the rock
Watching the sky
This one is clear
To mourn as a tear
Sunshine is gone
There is no lights
But I saw

On the road
Here we go
Fast or slow
We would be happy on the road
We would be happy on the road

I'm so exciting
And my wallet has no money
But, we'll keep on the road
We will keep on

On the road
Here we go
Fast or slow
We would be happy on the road
We would be happy on the road

On the road
Here we go
Fast or slow
We would be happy on the road
We would be happy on the road
