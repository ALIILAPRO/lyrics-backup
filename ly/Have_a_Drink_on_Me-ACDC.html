		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Whiskey, gin and brandy
With a glass, I'm pretty handy
I'm trying to walk a straight line
On sour mash and cheap wine

So join me for a drink, boys
We're gonna make a big noise
So don't worry about tomorrow
Take it today
Forget about the check
We'll get hell to pay

Have a drink on me
Have a drink on me
Yeah, have a drink on me
Have a drink on me (on me)
Come on

Dizzy, drunk and fightin'
On tequila, white lightnin'
Yes, my glass is getting shorter
On whiskey, ice and water

Yeah, so come on, have a good time
And get blinded out of your mind
So don't worry about tomorrow
Take it today
Forget about the check
We'll get hell to pay

Have a drink on me
Have a drink on me
Yeah, have a drink on me
Have a drink on me (on me)
Get stoned

Have a drink on me
Have a drink on me, yeah
Have a drink on me, come on

Oh
Gonna roll around
Gonna hit the ground
Take another swing
Have another drink
Gonna drink you dry
Gonna get me high
Come on, all the boys
Make a noise

Have a drink on me (have a drink on me)
Have a drink on me (have a drink on me)
Have a drink on me (have a drink on me)

Have a drink on me
Have a drink on me
Have a drink on me
