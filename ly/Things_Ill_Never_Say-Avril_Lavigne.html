		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm tugging at my hair
I'm pulling at my clothes
I'm trying to keep my cool
I know it shows
I'm staring at my feet
My cheeks are turning red
I'm searching for the words inside my head

'Cause I'm feeling nervous
Trying to be so perfect
'Cause I know you're worth it
You're worth it
Yeah

If I could say what I want to say
I'd say I want to blow you, away
Be with you every night
Am I squeezing you too tight
If I could say what I want to see
I want to see you go down
On one knee
Marry me today
Guess, I'm wishing my life away
With these things I'll never say

It don't do me any good
It's just a waste of time
What use is it to you
What's on my mind
If ain't coming out
We're not going anywhere
So why can't I just tell you that I care

'Cause I'm feeling nervous
Trying to be so perfect
'Cause I know you're worth it
You're worth it
Yeah

If I could say what I want to say
I'd say I want to blow you, away
Be with you every night
Am I squeezing you too tight
If I could say what I want to see
I want to see you go down
On one knee
Marry me today
Guess, I'm wishing my life away
With these things I'll never say

What's wrong with my tongue
These words keep slipping away
I stutter, I stumble
Like I've got nothing to say

'Cause I'm feeling nervous
Trying to be so perfect
'Cause I know you're worth it
You're worth it
Yeah

Guess I'm wishing my life away
With these things I'll never say

If I could say what I want to say
I'd say I want to blow you, away
Be with you every night
Am I squeezing you too tight
If I could say what I want to see
I want to see you go down
On one knee
Marry me today
Guess I'm wishing my life away
With these things I'll never say
These things I'll never say
