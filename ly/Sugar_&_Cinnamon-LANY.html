		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tattoos in Tokyo, weekends in Mexico
Still haven't seen the pyramids or the Rolling Stones
Black Harley Davidsons, sugar and cinnamon
Pick up the pieces of my heart, fall in love again
When I'm in my head
And feel like I got nothing left
It's easy to forget

There will be days
You can't catch a break
The sun is stuck behind the clouds
There will be times
When you lose your light
But don't you let it get you down
We're here right now
We're here right now

Summertime innocence, learn how to kiss in French
Stay up all night and watch the stars fade at 6AM
And when I lose the high
I know it's okay to cry, everybody does sometimes

There will be days
You can't catch a break
The sun is stuck behind the clouds
There will be times
When you lose your light
But don't you let it get you down
We're here right now
We're here right now

When I'm in my head
And feel like I got nothing left
It's easy to forget
That life is such a gift

There will be days
You can't catch a break
The sun is stuck behind the clouds
There will be times
When you lose your light
But don't you let it get you down
We're here right now
We're here right now
We're here right now
We're here right now

Oh yeah, tattoos in Tokyo, weekends in Mexico
Still haven't seen the pyramids or the Rolling Stones
Black Harley Davidsons, sugar and cinnamon
Pick up the pieces of my heart and fall in love again
