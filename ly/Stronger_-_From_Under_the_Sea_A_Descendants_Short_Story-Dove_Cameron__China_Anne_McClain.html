		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You know my mind starts to wander
Standing here alone
You know I dream in color
And do the things I want

You think you've got the best of me
Think you've had the last laugh
Bet you think that everything good is gone
Think you left me broken down
Think that I'd come running back
Baby you don't know me
'cause you're dead wrong

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
What doesn't kill you makes a fighter
Footsteps even lighter
Doesn't mean I'm over 'cause you're gone
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stronger just me, myself, and I
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone

You heard that I was starting
Over with something new
But told you I was moving on
I'm over you, yeah

You didn't think that I'd come back
I'd come back swinging
You tried to break me, but you see

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
What doesn't kill you makes a fighter
Footsteps even lighter
Doesn't mean I'm over 'cause you're gone
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stronger just me, myself, and I
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone

Thanks to you I got a new thing started
Thanks to you I'm not the broken hearted
Thanks to you I'm finally thinkin' 'bout me
You know in the end the day
You left was just my beginning in the end

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
(Stronger, yeah) stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
(Doesn't mean I'm alone)
What doesn't kill you makes a fighter
(Fighter) footsteps even lighter (Lighter)
Doesn't mean I'm over cause you're gone
(Because you're gone)

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
(Hey) , stronger just me, myself, and I
(Just me, myself, and I)
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
(Hey) stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stronger just me, myself, and I
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
(When I'm alone) when I'm alone
