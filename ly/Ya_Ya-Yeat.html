		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh, ya
Yeah, racks on the table, yeah, racks on the yacht
Ooh, ya
Yeah, this syrup not no maple, bitch, I'm sippin' on that Wock', yeah
They asked if I want diamonds, I said, "Ya-ya"
They asked if I make money, I said, "Ya-ya"
She just asked me, "What these diamonds is?" I said, "A yacht, yacht"
They asked, "How many square feet in your house?" I said, "A lot, lot"
I just went and bought the Urus then I took it off the lot
I ain't try yet, I ain't give nothing that I got
Yeah, don't try me, bitch, I swear to God
Finna touch a mill' then open the world's first lean bar
(Man, what the fuck?)

Yeah, bitch, I'm on the drugs, that's what we on
I had to take a break from X, I feel it in my heart
But I had to walk 'round before I had a car
If I don't slow down, I won't make it far
If you push me to the edge, I'm jumpin' extra far
New Amiri jeans, when I ask what you want, bitch say a million things
Yeah, I just bought the AP, bitch, I got a million sinks
Flush all my diamonds down the toilet, bitch, they flawless rings
Yeah, I woke up on the Perc, man, I took a bean
Yeah, I just left the Earth, they askin', "What that mean?"
I just walked in that bitch with flawless diamonds, yeah, new Celine
I can't rock with them broke boys, you ain't on the team, yeah
I just called the devil, go ahead, upside-down the T
I'm a fiend to be high, yeah, I can't feel a thing

Ooh, ya
Yeah, racks on the table, yeah, racks on the yacht
Ooh, ya
Yeah, this syrup not no maple, bitch, I'm sippin' on that Wock', yeah
They asked if I want diamonds, I said, "Ya-ya"
They asked if I make money, I said, "Ya-ya"
She just asked me, "What these diamonds is?" I said, "A yacht, yacht"
They asked, "How many square feet in your house?" I said, "A lot, lot"
I just went and bought the Urus then I took it off the lot
I ain't try yet, I ain't give nothing that I got
Yeah, don't try me, bitch, I swear to God
Finna touch a mill' then open the world's first lean bar
(Man, what the fuck?)
