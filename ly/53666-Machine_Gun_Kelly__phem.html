		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Some days, I feel like I let myself down
I love my life, gonna run it in the ground
Can't sleep for days, got your name in my brain
Can't sleep for days, gotta stay up, stay up forever

I'm writing this at 5:3666 in the morning
Wide awake still, not even yawning
Not even sure of why I'm up at dawn
Like I'm celebrating when my agent told me that no one's calling
It's a ounce in my living room on the couch
Next to a couple homies, I smoked it and passed out
So I'm alone with my thoughts in this glass house
In the cabinet are glass vials, I just poured all the last out
I smelled her, now she's on my mind
I met her the first time my light turned live
Hate it when she's gone but she ain't hard to find
Left her on my desk, she made designs of little lines

It's 5:3666
It's 5:3666

Some days, I feel like I let myself down
I love my life, gonna run it in the ground
Can't sleep for days, got your name in my brain
Can't sleep for days, gotta stay up, stay up forever

Ayy, look
I'm writing this at 5:3666 in the evening
In my head, talking to these demons
In my bed, staring at these ceilings
I just bleached my hair and changed my whole appearance
I'm just fed up with these smoke and mirrors
My uncle sold some pictures of me with no clearance
What the fuck is family? I can't take that serious
Thank God everybody sucks, so I can write these lyrics
Go pick her up, I need to lift my spirits
They don't know that we hook up, I don't let cameras near us
There's some shit I do, when she's around, I shouldn't share
Like that week I spent locked in a room with her in Paris, fuck

It's 5:3666
It's 5:3666

Some days, I feel like I let myself down
I love my life, gonna run it in the ground
Can't sleep for days, got your name in my brain (name in my brain)
Can't sleep for days, gotta stay up, stay up forever

It's 5:3666
It's 5:3666
It's 5:3666
Somebody, tell me why I'm still awake
It's 5:3666
