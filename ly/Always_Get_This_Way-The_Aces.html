		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hope it doesn't get worse as I get older
Everyone's giving me the cold shoulder
I don't remember when it took over
All I know now is it controls me

And I don't wanna call you but I can't really sleep
And I've been wearing a smile, pretending to eat
Oh, I swear, that I can explain now

I always get this way
It's fine
And I'm trying really hard not to fall apart
If you don't mind

I always get this way
At night, I do
If you could find it in your heart not to tear me apart
You'd be so kind
I always get

I know this isn't ideal for you
I do, I do, I do
But if you could be kind while I lose my mind, well
Try to, try to, try to

And I don't wanna call you, but I can't really sleep
And I've been starting to think it's society that's wrong with me
And drives me insane

I always get this way
It's fine
And I'm trying really hard not to fall apart
If you don't mind
I always get this way
At night, I do
If you could find it in your heart not to tear me apart
You'd be so kind
I always get

I always get this way (I always get this way)
It's fine (it's fine)
And I'm trying really hard not to fall apart
If you don't mind
I always get this way
At night, I do
If you could find it in your heart not to tear me apart
You'd be so kind
I always get (this way)
