		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Think of home, home
Think of home

When I think of home
I think of a place where there is love overflowing
I wish I was home
I wish I was back there with the things I been knowing

Wind that makes the tall trees bend into leaning
Suddenly the snowflakes that fall have a meaning
Sprinklin' the scene, makes it all clean

Maybe there's a chance for me to go back
Now that I have some direction
It would sure be nice to be back home
Where there is love and affection
And just maybe I can convince time to slow up
Giving me enough time in my life to grow up
Time be my friend, let me start again

Suddenly my world's gone and changed its face
But I still know where I'm going
I have had my mind spun around in space
And yet I have watched it growing

Oh, if you're listening, God
Please don't make it hard to know
If we should believe in the things that we see
Tell us, should we run away
Should we try and stay
Or would it be better just to let things be?

Living here, in this brand new world
Might be a fantasy
But it taught me to love
So it's real, it's real to me

And I have learned
That we must look inside our hearts to find
A world full of love
Like yours, like mine, like home, home
