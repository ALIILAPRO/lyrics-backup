		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I have a little story
Don’t tell anybody
Please listen carefully
It’s about this little buddy

She’s been living with me
I call her my diary
She has been keeping all my biggest secrets a mystery

I grow you go deeper inside of me
Love hate relationship
Well that’s the point of the story

Craving pleasure at night
We hunt together the fire
Its burning, burning
You satisfied, but I’m suffering

Give me a reason to stop, stop!
I won’t let go, though you keep me from reaching to the top

She wants to have it all, AH AH AH!
I wanna break it off

(You think you keep winning but it’s me who takes the last shot!)

I hear your echo and its nothing but a show
Bring me the Angels so that I can fight it all
