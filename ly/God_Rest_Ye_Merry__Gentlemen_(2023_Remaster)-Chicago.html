		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  God rest you merry, gentlemen,
Let nothing you dismay,
Remember Christ our Savior
Was born on Christmas Day
To save us all from Satan's power
When we were gone astray.

O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy,
O tidings of comfort and joy!

From God our heavenly Father
A blessed angel came
And unto certain shepherds
Brought tiding of the same
How that in Bethlehem was born
The Son of God by name.

"Fear not, then," said the angel,
"Let nothing you a fright
This day is born a Savior
Of a pure virgin bright,
To free all those who trust in him
From Satan's power and might."

Now to the Lord sing praises,
All you within this place,
And with true love and brotherhood
Each other now embrace
This holy tide of Christmas
Doth bring redeeming grace.
