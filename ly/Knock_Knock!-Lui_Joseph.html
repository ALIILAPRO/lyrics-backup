		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Look, my dog barking at the door, who could that be?
And it's like 2 in the morning so I was asleep
I get up and walk down the stairs to have peek
And then the lights to my house turned off, shit I'm in deep
So I grabbed my dog by the collar, run out the backdoor
You won't catch me, not tonight, not in the outdoors
'Cause I'm cutting through the woods
Jumping, jumping over creeks
Running, running with the wolves, I'll be gone before you blink
You don't know my neighborhood
Have 'em skating on a rink
Get that, get that understood
He's following in a red Mustang, I'm like for what?
My pockets ain't got money, mane
He stopped his car in the middle of the intersection, intersection
What do you want from me?
What do you want? I scream
The engine of the car turned off in the middle of the road
When the door opened up, high heels stepping out of the whip
What the fuck? This ain't what I thought it was
I thought that I was about to die
But it's not a bad guy, it's just a bad girl, she had a bad night
My house had pretty lights
I think she might be a witch, she covered up my lips
Said I fell for all the tricks, threw my heart into a ditch, bitch
Look, my dog barking at the door, who could that be?
And it's like 2 in the morning so I was asleep
I get up and walk down the stairs to have peek
And then the lights to my house turned off, shit I'm in deep
So I grabbed my dog by the collar, run out the backdoor
You won't catch me, not tonight, not in the outdoors
'Cause I'm cutting through the woods
Jumping, jumping over creeks
Running, running with the wolves, I'll be gone before you blink
You don't know my neighborhood
Have 'em skating on a rink
Get that, get that understood
He's following in a red Mustang, I'm like for what?
My pockets ain't got money, mane
He stopped his car in the middle of the intersection, intersection
What do you want from me?
What do you want? I scream

Look, my dog barking at the door, who could that be?
And it's like 2 in the morning so I was asleep
I get up and walk down the stairs to have peek
And then the lights to my house turned off, shit I'm in deep
So I grabbed my dog by the collar, run out the backdoor
You won't catch me, not tonight, not in the outdoors
'Cause I'm cutting through the woods
Jumping, jumping over creeks
Running, running with the wolves, I'll be gone before you blink
