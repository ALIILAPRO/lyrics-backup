		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm a rock star,
I'm a dealer,
I'm a servant,
I'm a leader,
I'm a savior,
I'm a sinner,
I'm a killer,
I'll be anything you want me to be

Silent
As a witness,
Make your heart race
With a death kiss,
I'm a soldier
In a blood war
In the Peace Corps,
I am everything you'll ever be

A loser,
Number zero,
Play the victim,
End up a hero,
I'm a teacher,
Preacher,
Liar,
I am anything, everything

Mover
And a shaker,
The oppressor,
Stimulator,
I'm a coward,
I'm a fighter,
Yeah

I'm everything,
You are me,
I am you

Everything is breaking,
No mistaking,
It's all changing,
Tear it down,
Watch it all start burning

All that's done is done, yes,
Let it lie

It's a revelation,
Celebration,
Graduation,
Times collide,
Watch the world awaken

All the past regrets from days gone by,
Let it go,
Let it die

It's a new day
For the faceless,
Take the torches
From the useless,
First amendment,
Second guesses,
All dependent,
I'll do anything to help you

Fallen crosses,
New alliance,
Deeper thinkers,
Modern science,
Open guest list,
All inclusive,
No one loses,
Everything you've always wanted

Honest answers
For the bruises,
Full disclosure,
No excuses,
Open handshake,
Clean slate,
No hate,
Living history,
Misery

Information,
Revolution,
Loading up for
Execution,
Push the button,
Pull the trigger,
Yeah

I'm everything,
You are me,
I am you

Everything is breaking,
No mistaking,
It's all changing,
Tear it down,
Watch it all start burning

All that's done is done, yes,
Let it lie

It's a revelation,
Celebration,
Graduation,
Times collide,
Watch the world awaken

All the past regrets from days gone by,
Let it go,
Let it die,

Everything is breaking,
No mistaking,
It's all changing,
Tear it down,
Watch it all start burning

All that's done is done, yes,
Let it lie

It's a revelation,
Celebration,
Graduation,
Times collide,
Watch the world awaken

All the past regrets from days gone by,
Let it go,
Let it die
(Die, die, die, die, die, die, die)
