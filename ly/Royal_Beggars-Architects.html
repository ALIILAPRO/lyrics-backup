		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Royal beggars, royal beggars
Do you, do you, do you wanna
Live forever, live forever
Alone, alone, alone?

'Cause we're broken
All hope is dead, but we're coping
Somebody, save our souls

Like a bird in a cage, trying to fly away
Is this the price that we have to pay?
Overflowing with rage, yet we still obey
'Cause we're asleep in a hurricane

Bitter lovers, bitter lovers
Let go, let go, let go 'cause it's
Now or never, now or never
Breathe in, breathe out, breathe in

'Cause we're choking
And left for dead, but we're coping
Somebody, save our souls

Like a bird in a cage, trying to fly away
Is this the price that we have to pay?
Overflowing with rage, yet we still obey
'Cause we're asleep in a hurricane

Are you listening? You may not have noticed
We have totally lost our way
Are you lost in the clouds? Or can you hold your focus?
It's ourselves that we will betray
Are you listening? You may not have noticed
We have totally lost our way
Are you lost in the clouds? Or can you hold your focus?
It's ourselves that we will betray

Like a bird in a cage, trying to fly away
Is this the price that we have to pay?
Overflowing with rage, yet we still obey
'Cause we're asleep in a hurricane

We sit on a throne, waiting for God to bend the knee
But we're nothing more than royal beggars
Yeah
But I'm as guilty as the next man
Our eyes are open, but we're not listening
