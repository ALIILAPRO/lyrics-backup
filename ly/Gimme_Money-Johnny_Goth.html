		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Narcissism is this game that we've been born 
I wanna love you but I love me more 

So give me money get me happy get me drunk 
Give me patience give me laughter give me drugs 
Give me everything you thought you ever loved 
Cuz I'm the devil baby nothing is enough 

I know I'm not lonely but I feel so alone 
Don't want no vacancy no island of my own 
Tell em your an angel baby tell them all your lies 
Cuz they don't wanna be here anymore that you and I 

So give me money get me happy get me drunk 
Give me patience give me laughter give me drugs 
Give me everything you thought you ever loved 
Cuz I'm the devil baby nothing is enough 

So give me money get me happy get me drunk 
Give me a reason to forget what I have done 
Show me your secrets every essence of your being 
I'll sell them for a dollar they don't mean a thing 

So give me money get me happy get me drunk 
Give me patience give me laughter give me drugs 
Give me everything you thought you ever loved 
Cuz I'm the devil baby nothing is enough
