		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm not aware of too many things
I know what I know, if you know what I mean

I'm not aware of too many things
I know what I know, if you know what I mean

Philosophy is the talk on a cereal box
Religion is the smile on a dog
I'm not aware of too many things
I know what I know, if you know what I mean, do doo yeah

Shove me in the shallow waters
Before I get too deep

What I am is what I am
Are you what you are or what?
What I am is what I am
Are you what you are, or?

Oh, I'm not aware of too many things
I know what I know, if you know what I mean

Philosophy is a walk on the slippery rocks
Religion is a light in the fog
I'm not aware of too many things
I know what I know, if you know what I mean, do doo yeah

Shove me in the shallow water
Before I get too deep

Shove me in the shallow water
Before I get too deep

What I am is what I am
Are you what you are or what?
What I am is what I am
Are you what you are or what?

What I am is what I am
Are you what you are or what you are is?
What I am is what I am
Are you what you are or what

Ha la la ha
I say, I say, I say, I do
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

Shove me in the shallow water
Before I get too deep
Shove me in the shallow water
Before I get too deep

Shove me in the shallow water
Before I get too deep
Shove me in the shallow water
Before I get too deep

Shove me in the shallow water
Before I get too deep
Don't let me get too deep
Don't let me get too deep
Don't let me get too deep
Don't let me get too deep

What I am is what I am
Are you what you are or what?
What I am is what I am
Are you what you are or what?
What I am is what I am
Are you what you are or what you are is?
What I am is what I am
Are you what you are or what?
