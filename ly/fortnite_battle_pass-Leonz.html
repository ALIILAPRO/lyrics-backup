		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fortnite battle pass, I just shit out my ass
Booted up my PC, cause I need need
To get that Fortnite battle pass
Fortnite battle pass, I just shit out my ass
Booted up my PC, cause I need need
To get that Fortnite battle pass

Fortnite battle pass, I was shitting out my ass in class
Woa-oa-oa-oa-oah
You just cannot eat my ass if you ain't got the battle pass

I got a scar and AR and I put them inside of my ass
I don't even care if I just go to the toilet
I pass gas in the fucking toilet and it smells really bad
Holy shit I just farted
Watchu know about rolling down in the deep?
When your brain goes numb, you can call that mental freeze
When these people talk too much, put that shit in slow motion, yeah
I feel like an astronaut in the ocean, ay

Booted up my PC
Gotta get that night night
It's five o'clock that's basically nighttime
Okay

Fortnite battle pass, I was shitting out my ass in class
Woa-oa-oa-oa-oah
You just cannot eat my ass if you ain't got the battle pass
Yea-ea-ea-ea-eah
You just cannot eat my ass if you ain't got the battle pass
