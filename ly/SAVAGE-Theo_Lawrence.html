		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bet she only love the way it tastes like
Wonder what you're gonna taste like
Bitch you running for the a side
She a biddie out for late nights
Shawty a savage
Do you want a
Do you want a bad bitch
Full of bagadge
But out of all the bitches you're the baddest

Ey
See I ain't tryna catch a law suit
But She a FED, giving me head in a car coupe
She got bands
Only fans
But it's all cool
She Brought a friend
Now where fuckin in the bathroom
Yea
Obsessed
Now She getting undressed
Then she spreading her legs
Taking shots
Like an underarmor vest
Till the bullet connect
I know you love it babe
But shit id rather pull the trigger babe
Then eat your body out for dinner babe
Yeye

Bet she only love the way it tastes like
Wonder what you're gonna taste like
Bitch you running for the a side
She a biddie out for late nights
Shawty a savage
Do you want a
Do you want a bad bitch
Full of bagadge
But out of all the bitches you're the baddest

Say you changed for the better
Oh Baby that's alright
Hope it aint no vendetta
Cus nobody can hold you tight
Ai
Cus you don't Even know what you like
The Henny and the coke kinda fucked up your life
And now you wanna fuck
Yea i guess i just might
But Im honest
Honest
Could be that I'm way to honest
Way to honest

Bet she only love the way it tastes like
Wonder what you gonna taste like
Bitch you running for the a side
She a biddie out for late nights
Shawty a savage
Do you want a bad bitch
Full of bagadge
But out of all the bitches you're the baddest
