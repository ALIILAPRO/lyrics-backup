		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm drowning in a sea of static
I'm sleepless in a bed for two
I hear the war through the speakers
Dance with the shadows in my room

Slowly these shadows become you

Give me something to believe in
Even if it's not true
I'll have blind faith in you
I do if you do too

We're burning daylight just for fun
Let's drive 'till the dark turns into dawn

Will you still haunt me when you're gone?

Give me something to believe in
Even if it's not true
I'll have blind faith in you
I do if you do too

What will it take?
A little fear, a little faith?
What can I do?
I'm giving up on you

Give me something to believe in
Even if it's not true
I'll have blind faith in you
I do if you do too

(Even if it's not true)
(I do if you do)
