		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'mma keep coming back
Keep coming back like

Blood in my eyes
Veins full of ice
Strike to survive
Prepared to die
Whatever the price
I'll pay it twice

Yeah
I've been building my basis
Wanna see the look on your faces
From stadium stages
Here's to you, who said I'll never make it
Time to tie my shoelaces
Running up the staircases
Whatever comes, I'll face it
And claim it

Every time you burn me to the ground
Every time you kick me when I'm down
I'm coming back for more
Like I'm Balboa
Every time you see me bleeding out
It's one step closer to my crown
I'm coming back for more
Like I'm Balboa
I'mma keep coming back
Keep coming back like Balboa

Knockout, I'm sending suckers home like Drago
I've got no bow, no arrow, but Apollo follows
Gimme a clubber for supper
Making these fake clowns go breathless
I grow when I suffer like having breakdowns for breakfast

Blood in my eyes
Veins full of ice
Strike to survive
Prepared to die
Whatever the price
I'll pay it twice

Every time you burn me to the ground
Every time you kick me when I'm down
I'm coming back for more
Like I'm Balboa
Every time you see me bleeding out
It's one step closer to my crown
I'm coming back for more
Like I'm Balboa
I'mma keep coming back
Keep coming back like Balboa
I'mma keep coming back
Keep coming back like Balboa
Like I'm Balboa
I'mma keep coming back
Keep coming back like

Blood in my eyes
Veins full of ice
Strike to survive
Prepared to die
Whatever the price
I'll pay it twice

'Cause every time you think I'm defeated
I'm saying please be seated
Always up for a challenge
The struggle made me a savage, I'm damaged
Underdogs are a dangerous species
Taking hits until everyone sees me

'Cause every time you burn me to the ground
Every time you kick me when I'm down
I'm coming back for more
Like I'm Balboa
Every time you see me bleeding out
It's one step closer to my crown
I'm coming back for more
Like I'm Balboa
I'mma keep coming back
Keep coming back like Balboa
