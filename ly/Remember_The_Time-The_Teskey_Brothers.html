		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I remember when we were in love
I remember how it used to feel
I remember when we were happy
Was it a lie or was that real?

Feels like we're going through changes
Oh, we can't control the strain, whoa
But we can't feel any pity or pain
For the way in which we changed

Said I can't help but remember the time
When I first took your hands in mine
Oh, we were in love that day, we were in love that day
The memory I wanna stay, yeah
The memory I wanna stay, oh

Did I take too much time to notice
The way in which we drifted apart? Oh, baby
So I guess we gotta find our own way
Like strangers in a broken heart

But is there any rhyme or reason in trying to fight the change?
In our hearts I know where we wanna to be
I know we can take the strain, ohh

But I can't help but remember the time
When I first took your hands in mine
Oh, we were in love that day, we were in love that day
The memory I wanna stay, yeah
The memory I wanna stay, oh, baby

Yeah

'Cause I know we can make it through, oh
'Cause I know that this stuff is true, ay-yeah, yeah

But I can't help but remember the time
When I first took your hands in mine
Oh, we were in love that day, we were in love that day
The memory I wanna stay
The memory I wanna stay
The memory I wanna stay, yeah
The memory I wanna stay, yeah
