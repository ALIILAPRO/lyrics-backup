		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One of us knows who hates me
One of us loves it
One of us knows who hates me
One of us loves it
And I know it's you

Ain't nobody gonna cut me, corrupt me, instruct me
Consequently, condition your interruption to disrupt me
What's the matter with my image, the balance or the presence?
Older and still blown out, follow me, I know where we're going now
Pentagrams, penitentiaries, I've been here for centuries
I'm a product of the system, the price you can't resist
Fuck, I bless where I spit, cross the ground, get over it
Massacred disaster is the perfect one we need today

I know the reaper is a liar
And I still don't care
Because I know it's you
One of us knows who hates me
One of us loves it
I know it's

Slaughter, slaughter it can happen to a father, father you see
Everybody has a weakness, reveal yourself, I'll eat the pieces
Don't be judging me, I know the dues I know the fees
I know the rules I know you cheat, we never need to brandish heat
Psychos, cycles, madness comes around, around, around, around
Tyrants, tirades, love to swing the hammer, bring the hammer down
Famous and infamous, no way of knowing I'm obsessed with this shit
I just wanna get what's coming to me

I know the reaper is a liar
And I still don't care
Because I know it's you
One of us knows who hates me
One of us loves it
Because I know it's you
One of us knows who hates me
One of us loves it
Because I know it's you

I was a sign, the sign was in the eyes
The eyes were in the skull, the skull was in the wall
The wall was in my head, my head was in the ground
The ground was all decayed, the rotting had a name
The name was a sign, fuck you

One of us knows who hates me
One of us loves it
One of us knows who hates me
One of us loves it

I know the mystery is the fire
I wish it wasn't true
I know the fuckin reaper is a liar
And I still don't care
Because I know it's you
One of us knows who hates me
One of us loves it
Because I know it's you
One of us knows who hates me
One of us loves it
I fucking know it's you
One of us knows who hates me
One of us loves it
I fucking know it's you
One of us knows who hates me
One of us loves it
Because I know it's you
