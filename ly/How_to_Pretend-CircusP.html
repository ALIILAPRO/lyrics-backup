		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Breathe in, breathe now
You have to calm down
Let me show you somewhere we could hide
We can stay in here until sunrise

Moving forward
Step by step, once more
Follow my instructions, you'll be fine
This will only hurt for a short time

With promises of freedom
I would never lie to you
Only speaking the way you do too
How great that it must be
To walk outside and see
Others just like you
And not

I am not like you
I can't do all that you do
No matter how desperately I want to

When you look into my eyes you see
A mirage of something trustworthy
I'm not your enemy, no more anxiety
Though, you're right to be wary
'Cause I know how to pretend
How to pretend

Breathe in, breathe out
I'm lost in here now
And of course I know that
There's no way, there's no way I can turn back

I'm left in the dark to play my part
Follow every lie you feed me
As they lead to more and more agony

Are we on the same team after all this time?
Are we really feeling a pain of the same kind?
Watching from the outside, you
Can't see all the things I do
You're a circus monster and now's your cue

You were right
When you said that we're not the same
Because unlike you
I can feel pain

When I look into your eyes I see
A facade, you are not trustworthy
You are my enemy, faking your empathy
I was right to be wary
When you know how to pretend
How to pretend

When you look into my eyes you see
A mirage of something trustworthy
I'm not your enemy, no more anxiety
Though, you're right to be wary
'Cause I know

(You're not good at pretending)

Come dance and we'll be prismatic
I'm not falling for all your tricks

Let's put on a show before the curtain falls (before the curtain falls)
I won't take a bow
It's time, our finale's now
This mangled freak show is where we end it all (is where we start it all)
