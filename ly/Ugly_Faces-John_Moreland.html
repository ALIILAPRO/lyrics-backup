		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're seeing ugly faces in your dreams
Let me know what it means
We told ourselves we'd tell it true
But I learned how to lie, watching you

This dirty place don't want you here
Looks like you're stuck another year
You close your eyes, a scene rolls by
A strip mall under sunburst sky

My back was to a corner, lonely in a crowd
I couldn't hear you calling, the bullshit was so loud
I'm sorry you got borrowed, I'm sorry you got bruised
I wish I could've found a way to be of better use

But I'm a lonely shade of blue
I don't know what else to do

Does it even matter? does it ever last?
I didn't want the answer to the question that I asked
Can I kill a monster? can I be a man?
I can't afford to give a damn if you don't understand

I don't know how I built this boat
Or if it's always gonna float
You're seeing ugly faces in your dreams
Please let me know what it means
