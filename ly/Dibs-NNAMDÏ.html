		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Took it out onto the pavement
And my knees got to shaking in the street
 
Tip my hat and turn around now “C’est la vie”
Threaten to take it when I leave
 
And Just
How much longer?
How much more?
What are you waiting for?
How much longer? 
How much more?
What are you saving for?
 
I know it’s just another day long
I kept on listening to the same song again and again
Stole a pen and spelled my name wrong everywhere 
Took advice from all the greats that did it the same
 
Started fresh I got my aim strong, yeah
Taking shots at something straight forward 
Followed the flames up in smoke 
I see the gray smog rising again
