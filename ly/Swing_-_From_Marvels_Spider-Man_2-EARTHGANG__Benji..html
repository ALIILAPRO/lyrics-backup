		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah, yeah (woo)
My senses bouncin' off a wall
Evil lurkin' every day
You don't ever need to call
I can feel it right away
Slim chance to beat the odds
But I always find a way
You were never just a nobody, go get 'em tiger
Swingin' up and away

One, two, three, four, five (four, five)
I'm 'bout to take it live (take it live)
Together, we win
Think you can catch us? Baby, we'll see about this
Jumpin' from cloud to cloud (cloud to cloud)
I'm so above the crowd (above the crowd)
We can go pound for pound, yeah
We can go round for round (round for round)
Alone in this world, they gon' doubt ya
So join up your powers (powers)
Live in a world where they down ya
Before they crown you (crown you)
Divided, your dreams are devoured
Together, it's ours (ours)
That's where you find your destiny
Shawty, you're bound to (bound to)
Feelings chillin', this a sticky feeling
I can sense 'em creepin' closer by the minute
Let me get 'em, pushin' past the limits
Pushin' past the ceilin', promise, I'ma end it
Most people got a power in 'em
'Til they show their light, then they make you dim it
Most people, man, they scared to risk it
That's the only way you ever win it (yeah, yeah, yeah, woo)

My senses bouncin' off a wall
Evil lurkin' every day
You don't ever need to call
I can feel it right away
Slim chance to beat the odds
But I always find a way
You were never just a nobody, go get 'em tiger
Swingin' up and away

That my partner, yeah, he checkin' my six
Save the day with a flick of the wrist
Work together, give each other assists
You don't see me comin', I'm a plot twist
Senses are tinglin'
We find the villain and get to tag teamin' him
Leap of faith, take it for what I'm believin' in
I know my destiny greater than this
We got a bond that no evil can break
Forever my bro at the end of the day
This bigger than us, we got too much at stake
I'm good by myself, but together, we great
Puttin' my life on the line for the citizens
See all the angles, I'm weavin' and pitvotin'
Then I'm drop-kickin' a criminal idiot
I recognize the playground that the city is
Feel like a jungle gym, feel like I'm jugglin'
Sky full of turbulence, street keep on rumblin'
But I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
As long and as it's me and my buddy, we ain't gon' be strugglin'
Ay, you take the left and I take the right
We takin' the chances and rollin' the dice
Stickin' with you like your uncle's advice
Trustin' my instincts, I'm not thinkin' twice
I know my enemies not gon' play nice
So I'ma give it my all every time
Let go of fear, it's just all in your mind
Surprised what you find if you just look inside
Carpe diem, now you own the night
But you gotta decide, the fight or the flight
You doin' what's right, it's bigger than pride
Really no limit with friends by your side (yeah, yeah, yeah, woo)

My senses bouncin' off a wall
Evil lurkin' every day
You don't ever need to call
I can feel it right away
Slim chance to beat the odds
But I always find a way
You were never just a nobody, go get 'em tiger
Swingin' up and away
