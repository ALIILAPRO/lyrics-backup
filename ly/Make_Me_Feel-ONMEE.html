		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey, pretty baby with the high heels on
You give me fever like I've never, ever known
You're just a product of loveliness
I like the groove of your walk, your talk, your dress

I feel your fever from miles around
I'll pick you up in my car and we'll paint the town
Just kiss me, baby, and tell me twice
That you're the one for me

The way you make me feel
You really turn me on
You knock me off of my feet now, baby
My lonely days are gone

The way you make me feel
You really turn me on
You knock me off of my feet now, baby
My lonely days are gone

The way you make me feel
The way you make me feel

I like the feelin' you're givin' me
Just hold me, baby, and I'm in ecstasy
Oh, I'll be workin' from 9 to 5
To buy you things to keep you by my side

I've never felt so in love before
Just promise baby, you'll love me forever more
I swear I'm keepin' you satisfied
'Cause you're the one for me

The way you make me feel
You really turn me on
You knock me off of my feet now, baby
My lonely days are gone

The way you make me feel
You really turn me on
You knock me off of my feet now, baby
My lonely days are gone

The way you make me feel
The way you make me feel
