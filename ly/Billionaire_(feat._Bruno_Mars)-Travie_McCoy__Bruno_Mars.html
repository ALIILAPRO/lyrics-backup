		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wanna be a billionaire so fuckin' bad
Buy all of the things I never had
Uh, I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine
Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen

Oh, every time I close my eyes
I see my name in shining lights, yeah
A different city every night, oh I
I swear the world better prepare
For when I'm a billionaire

Yeah, I would have a show like Oprah
I would be the host of, everyday Christmas
Give Travie a wish list
I'd probably pull an Angelina and Brad Pitt
And adopt a bunch of babies that ain't never had shit
Give away a few Mercedes like here lady have this
And last but not least grant somebody their last wish
It's been a couple months that I've been single so
You can call me Travie Claus minus the Ho Ho
Get it, hehe, I'd probably visit where Katrina hit
And damn sure do a lot more than FEMA did
Yeah, can't forget about me stupid
Everywhere I go I'ma have my own theme music

Oh, every time I close my eyes (what you see, what you see?)
I see my name in shining lights, oh yeah-yeah (uh-huh, and what else?)
A different city every night, oh I (uh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I swear the world better prepare (for what?)
For when I'm a billionaire
Oh-ooh, oh-ooh (oh), when I'm a billionaire
Oh-ooh, oh-ooh (let's go)

I'll be playing basketball with the President
Dunking on his delegates
Then I'll compliment him on his political etiquette
Toss a couple milli in the air just for the heck of it
But keep the five, twenties, tens, and Bens completely separate
And yeah, I'll be in a whole new tax bracket
We in recession but let me take a crack at it
I'll probably take whatever's left and just split it up
So everybody that I love can have a couple bucks
And not a single tummy around me would know what hungry was
Eating good sleeping soundly
I know we all have a similar dream
Go in your pocket, pull out your wallet
Put it in the air and sing

I wanna be a billionaire so fuckin' bad
Buy all of the things I never had, uh (buy everything, haha)
I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine
Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen (what up, Oprah?)
Oh, every time I close my eyes (what you see, what you see, bruh?)
I see my name in shining lights, oh yeah-yeah (uh-huh, and what else?)
A different city every night, oh I
I swear the world better prepare (for what?)
For when I'm a billionaire (yeah)
Oh-ooh, oh-ooh (sing it)
When I'm a billionaire
Oh-ooh, oh-ooh (oh)

I wanna be a billionaire (uh-huh)
So fuckin' bad
