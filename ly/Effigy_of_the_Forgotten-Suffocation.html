		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Torn away from my state of being
Chosen to be forgotten
Unspeakable pain as I leave this solid structure
As the earth becomes smaller, I reach a new plan
One so distant from where I was conceived

A heaping mass of fear is what we hold dear
For our loved ones who go to this heaven
Thrown away even by god
Sentenced to this celestial cell
....
How can life after death be more serene than life itself?

Effigy of the forgotten

How can you cry when someone dies?
The lord will greet him
With open arms, that's what he wrote
I will never beleive them
Victims of deception, forward to regression
I must defy him
