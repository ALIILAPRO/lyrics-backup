		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ayy, yeah
Hey
Ayy, oh
Ayy, yeah, yo

Crackin' the code on the safe
This for the young niggas like YMCA (hey)
Talkin' 'bout breakin' they ankles
Ballin' so hard, I'ma sign twelve-day (play)
Kick the hoes out, they borin' me (borin')
I don't know nothin' about your sorority (sorority)
DTF, thanks for informin' me
Members only, can't fuck with the majority
Christian Dior on my feet (feet)
Throwin' it up like it's YMCA (ayy)
Digital license plates
I can't wait to hop out that 1028 (ayy)
And they treat me like royalty (royalty)
I mean, gettin' the check a priority (priority)
Tryna book, gotta order me (order me)
We in the place, so the conduct disorderly (yeah)

We in the place, so the conduct disorderly
Quit tryna speak to me so cordially (cordially)
Dominatrix tryna torture me (yeah)
Swae Lee got cash like he up in his forties (forties)
I'm up in the mornin'
Ass fat and she throwin' it towards me (towards me)
I'm up in the stars
Forty-five minutes up in the store (yo)
Hurry up, bring me that bag, shoes matchin' (matchin')
Stirrin' the cup, sippin' my drink, yeah
Courtside delay the game with AD
Hurricane season, I flooded the AP (AP)
Even back then, I was trustin' the process
Brought her backstage, now she want all access
Might as well give up, it's a no contest
Lookin' in the mirror, damn, lookin' red carpet fresh

Crackin' the code on the safe ('kay)
This for the young niggas like YMCA (ayy)
Talkin' 'bout breakin' they ankles
Ballin' so hard, I'ma sign twelve-day (play)
Kick the hoes out, they borin' me (borin')
I don't know nothin' about your sorority (sorority)
DTF, thanks for informin' me
Members only, can't fuck with the majority
Christian Dior on my feet (feet)
Throwin' it up like it's YMCA (ayy)
Digital license plates
I can't wait to hop out that twin 28 (ayy)
And they treat me like royalty (royalty)
I mean, gettin' to the check a priority (priority)
Tryna book, gotta order me (order me)
We in the place, so the conduct disorderly (yeah)

This for the young niggas like YMCA
I'm ballin' like Wilt, I'm ballin' like Chamberlain
Stand on my neck 'cause my necklace keep danglin'
Extraterrestrial, Jxmmi's an alien
Walk in the store and they treat me with kindness
Why ask the price when I know I'ma buy it?
I need a cape 'cause I stay on some fly shit
Red carpet fresh, but I ain't got a stylist
Walk in the bank and they meet me in private
Maybach got trace like a plane, I'm a pilot
Eatin' up the (D) like Italian
Bitch might be thicker than Megan Thee Stallion
I'm havin' options, don't know what to say
Should I rock the Dior or Louis today?
The shrooms got me feelin' like I'm on a wave
When I make a move, they screamin', "Hooray"

Crackin' the code on the safe ('kay)
This for the young niggas like YMCA (ayy)
Talkin' 'bout breakin' they ankles
Ballin' so hard, I'ma sign twelve-day (play)
Kick the hoes out, they borin' me (borin')
I don't know nothin' about your sorority (sorority)
DTF, thanks for informin' me
Members only, can't fuck with the majority
Christian Dior on my feet (feet)
Throwin' it up like it's YMCA (ayy)
Digital license plates
I can't wait to hop out that twin 28 (ayy)
And they treat me like royalty (royalty)
I mean, gettin' to the check a priority (priority)
Tryna book, gotta order me (order me)
We in the place, so the conduct disorderly

Draped down, fly as a cape
This for the young niggas like YMCA
Ankles, ballin' so hard, coach like "Why don't you play?"
