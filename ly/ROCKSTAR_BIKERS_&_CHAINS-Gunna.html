Hoo, hoo

Rockstar life, bikers and chains (chains)
One carat drip down my fang (fang)
Drugs runnin' deep through my vein (hoo)
I'm takin' drugs, healin' the pain (hoo)
Let the paint drip on my main (my main, hoo)
Let the paint drip, me and Wave (Wave, hoo)
I got more whips than a slave (slave, hoo)
Huh, safety deposit at Chase (yeah)

Copped the wrap on that bitch, got it matted (yeah)
They doubted, didn't think it would happen (yeah)
Thank God that He blessed me with talent (thank God, yeah)
My new bitch I got, she done been in the pageant (yeah)
She sexy and so charismatic (yeah, uh)
I hope it's a bulletproof vest in that jacket (yeah)
I keep the drumstick like it's Madden (yeah)
(I keep the drumstick like it's Madden)
In need of that cash like a addict (addict, hoo)
Told her, "Pull up," and sent her the addy (pull up, hoo)
Young GunWunna gon' keep him a baddie (GunWunna, hoo)
I'm a rockstar and a god of the fashion (uh, hoo)
Can't see you, these lights steady flashin' (hoo)
Raised the bar for my niggas, now we livin' legends (Wunna)
Just look at how we livin' lavish
(Just look at how we livin' lavish)

Rockstar life, bikers and chains (chains)
One carat drip down my fang (fang)
Drugs runnin' deep through my vein (hoo)
I'm takin' drugs, healin' the pain (hoo)
Let the paint drip on my main (my main, hoo)
Let the paint drip, me and Wave (Wave, hoo)
I got more whips than a slave (slave, hoo)
Huh, safety deposit at Chase (yeah)

I want the fortune, not fame (yeah)
Run it up, go buy the Lamb' truck (uh)
The Porsche, the Rolls Royce and the 'Vette and the Range ('Vette and the Range)
Niggas don't play 'cause they know we gon' bust (nah)
We pull up, bullets rainin' like rain (rain)
They drip 'cause of us, they ain't keepin' up (nah)
I switch it up, leather jackets and chains (hoo)

Uh, rockstar life, bikers and chains (hoo)
Uh, you don't want smoke with the gang (hoo)

Uh, I bring the heat like La Flame (hoo)
Came from the south but I ain't Tity 2 Chainz
