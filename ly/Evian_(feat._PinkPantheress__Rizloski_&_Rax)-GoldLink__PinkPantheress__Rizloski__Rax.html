		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Feel like you're making a fool of me
I'll still act accordingly
Time's still my enemy
When we're close it's time to leave
You're not like the loving kind
No doubt 'bout that in my mind
I'm stressed but don't want to be (yeah)
When you stood in front of me

I like to imagine that I like you and you know my name
I don't even fuck wit the girls over there 
And I wanna tell you that my name real fameous, shameless
I keep my girls real nameless
Boys in the back mandem over there
Bald head nigga, wearing gold in my ear
Diamond necklace wear it and they stare
I don't give a fuck I throw the money air
Pull up in a rare Bentley, I ain't friendly
Got my boys, my God, and a henley
I'm prentendin', it's cool or whatever
I rock jeans all summer and the winter
Dance on me, dance on me weather
Birds of a feather we flock together, I

I don't wanna talk too much dawg cah they know my ting
From the South of Thames
Yeah, man cut man off cah they slow my ting
Knew she the one when she see blue lights
How she hold my ting
Knew she the one how she come to the crib 
How she hold my ting, ayy
Back that chat then bring it
I hate it when man fidget
I don't like that one minute
But you know seh the mandem really wid it
Ah da mandem ah really go get it
And you know seh the mandem really wid it
And mandem really go chef it

Flexxed up like it's exercise, they're terrified
'Cause me and you and you on them
It's day and night
Way too hard to rectify, so I electrify
She bend on her friend
Now that's just so many hands on thighs
That back just might just turn the tide
She done so well, she earned her stripes
Don't chat in her ear she won't reply
She's rolling her eyes, you're not the guy
You're not the guy, you're

Feel like you're making a fool of me
I'll still act accordingly
Time's still my enemy
When we're close it's time to leave
You're not like the loving kind
No doubt 'bout that in my mind
I'm stressed but don't want to be
When you stood in front of me

Feel like you're making a fool of me
I'll still act accordingly
Time's still my enemy
