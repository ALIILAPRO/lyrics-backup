		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't know where we go
We let the signals flow
Don't know what we're searching for, we are
Feeling rich but we're looking poor

We're kites over tree tops
Shaky looking shape ups, looking shape ups
Found a place to call home
Where we kinda lay low, where we lay low

Uh, when I'm with you I feel like I'm on detox
I'm spending all my nights without a single teardrop
We are kites flying high over tree tops
You know we got that thing
You know we got that thing

When the sun goes down
We find a place in new home town
We just take it slow, going with the flow
We are drifters in the wind

Kites over tree tops
Shaky looking shape ups, looking shape ups
Found a place to call home
Where we kinda lay low, where we lay low

Uh, when I'm with you I feel like I'm on detox
I'm spending all my nights without a single teardrop
We are kites flying high over tree tops
You know we got that thing
You know we got that thing

Uh, when I'm with you I feel like I'm on detox
I'm spending all my nights without a single teardrop
We are kites flying high over tree tops
You know we got that thing
You know we got that thing

Uh yeah
Uh yeah

Found a place to call home
Where we lay low

Uh, when I'm with you I feel like I'm on detox
I'm spending all my nights without a single teardrop
We are kites flying high over tree tops
You know we got that thing
You know we got that thing

Uh, when I'm with you I feel like I'm on detox
I'm spending all my nights without a single teardrop
We are kites flying high over tree tops
You know we got that thing
You know we got that thing
