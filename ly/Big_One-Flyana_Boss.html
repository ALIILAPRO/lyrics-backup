		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah, yeah
Spittin' game so whack
Like, blah, blah, blah
He a big trick
So I leave him in awe
Actin' like a kid
I don't want him, on God (God)
He a bugga boo, oh, Lord (oh, Lord)

I'm so picky choosey
Eeny meeny miney moe
Fuckin' with his head
And he don't even know
On a different level
You can't go where I go
I thought I told him
Racks so big, can't hold 'em

What type of whip you want?
A big one
What type of dick you like?
A big one
What type of bank you got?
A big one
Now watch how I'm 'bout to do my big one

I did my big one (oh)
I did my big one (oh)
I did my big one (oh)
I won't settle for less
Than a big one

You a yak bitch like
Yoddi yoddi yah
I flip the switch
Bitch left in the dark
Draggin' these hoes
Like a walk in the park
When they on the leash
Now these bitches wanna bark

(Woof, woof)
Hair done up
You wanna act tough
Bitch, run up
Yeah I be on the prowl
On the come up
And my bestie stay linked
Like a nunchuck

What type of whip you want?
A big one
What type of dick you like?
A big one
What type of bank you got?
A big one
Now watch how I'm 'bout to do my big one

I did my big one (oh)
I did my big one (oh)
I did my big one (oh)
I won't settle for less
Than a big one

What type of whip you want?
A big one
What type of dick you like?
A big one
What type of bank you got?
A big one
Now watch how I'm 'bout to do my big one

I did my big one (oh)
I did my big one (oh)
I did my big one (oh)
I won't settle for less
Than a big one
