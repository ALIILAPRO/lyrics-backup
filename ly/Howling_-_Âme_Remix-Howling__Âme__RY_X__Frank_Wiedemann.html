		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hot nights coming
Keep the car running
Lavender fingers
Swallow my pollen

Gold I swam into your spell
On the rite of God we fell
You were plush and I laid bare, you had me howling
Cold I fell into your skin
On the night you led me under your sin
You had me howling, you had me howling

Golden siren
Under exposing
Come lay your weakness down
On the floor in the backseat

Gold I swam into your spell
On the rite of God we fell
You were plush and I laid bare, you had me howling
Cold I fell into your skin
On the night you led me under your sin
You had me howling, you had me howling

Ooh, blush, ooh, blush, ooh, blush, ooh, blush
Ooh, blush, ooh, blush, ooh, blush, ooh, blush
Ooh, blush, ooh, blush
Ooh, blush, ooh, blush, ooh, blush, ooh, blush
