		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Am I worth it or am I worthless?
And will I ever figure it out?
Sold myself to him
Be my own victim
And with this bondage
Tie myself down

How are you gonna lie about me now?
I see you watching me from underground
What's the strangest way you can't be found?
How are you gonna lie?
How are you gonna lie?

Got to be without love
Got to be without love
Got to be without love
Got to be without love

Got to be without love
Got to be without love
Got to be without love
Got to be without love

Is it hidden beneath the surface?
Sew my lips 'til it won't come out
Sold myself further and tell it to you
Can I suffer? I won't make a sound

How are you gonna lie about me now?
I see you watching me from underground
What's the strangest way you can't be found?
How are you gonna lie?
How are you gonna lie?

Got to be without love
Got to be without love
Got to be without love
Got to be without love
Got to be without love
Got to be without love
Got to be without love
Got to be without love

I want a weak chance
I wanna be the one to
I want a weak chance
I'm not just body tissue
I wanna play pretend
I don't wanna see tomorrow
Tell me where to spit
Don't tell me what to swallow

How are you gonna lie about me now?
I see you watching me from underground
What's the strangest way you can't be found?
How are you gonna lie?
How are you gonna lie?

Got to be without love
Got to be without love
Got to be without love
Got to be without love
Got to be without love
Got to be without love
Got to be without love
Got to be without love
