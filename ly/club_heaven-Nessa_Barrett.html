		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You always liked an afterparty, so I guess I shoulda known
Said we hate the paparazzi, now you're somewhere they can't go
I hope you know I'm sorry, that I'm not with you right now
Can't pick up when you call me, can't hear it through the clouds

I've been waitin' right outside
Tryna bribe the bouncer
He says, "Not tonight"

I hope you're dancin' in club Heaven (yeah)
Smokin' some blue dream with your legends (yeah)
I bet you're up in the V.I.P, raisin' some hell for me
Until I get in (I can't get in)
To club Heaven

The music's never stoppin', and the lights never turn on
The saints are rollin' Molly, and you're talkin' shit with God
I'm searchin' for your halo 'cause I'm not havin' fun
In the city full of angels that's missin' the best one

I wish I could cut the line
Been tryna bribe the bouncer
He says, "Not tonight"

I hope you're dancin' in club Heaven (yeah)
Smokin' some blue dream with your legends (yeah)
I bet you're up in the V.I.P, raisin' some hell for me
Until I get in (I can't get in)
To club Heaven

What if I can't get in?
How will I see you again?
What if I can't get in?
How will I see you again?

I hope you're dancin' in club Heaven
