		  [Talking between the Souls and Pep Love]

"I find it fun to smash emcees into (fine bits) 
So why I ain't get my just deserts for all the kids I busted, huh?
(Baby!) 
I crush the curtesy when dealin' with the folks is too much
for the askin' 
Cool-I got the (skill crafted tools)
Massive fools at my work bench and
(I'm wrenchin') mics from they graspin'
(That's how it has been)
The drill's this: I kill swift
I feels I better slay or, (hey
my tape measures greater)
So now I'm (askin') dips if they (saw me) 
and they was available
would they want me to (nail'em all?)
Be through, screw drive her (screwdriver) crazy
Nuttin', bold, lively
(Put on your high beams)

I, proliferator, quickly fade to niggas vigorous
Figure I kick stunts, 
I punch twice that nigga that's dissin' at me
Attach'em to bats, latchin', and matchin' my cataclism
I give'em a (skism), 
I (stroke to croak her, I broke her)
Chokin' up on my syntax, as I bend backs by impacts (impacts)
then I give a concusssion in your NUTS when I'm bustin'
(Heads) 
Dead with my lead graff
I cloth thee, I (swing) off-beat, off the
cerebellum, swellin' nimrods
Ten brains couldn't parallel this, 
(ha) I'm caraouselling kids
while they wallow and swallow hallow tips (yep)
You follow and slippin'
I'm rippin' mics nice twice like (dicin' kids in fractions)
Yo, (figure, I tax men)

Steppin' to Casual
That's when ya lost

What about Domino?
That's when ya lost

But if you step to Snupe
That's when ya lost

Steppin' to A+...
That's when ya lost

If you play the Tajai
That's when ya lost

Man, steppin' to Opio
That's when ya lost

Seppin' to Phesto
That's when ya lost

Phuck with Toure'
That's when ya lost

(Yo), I'm willin' to bet, you're willin' to sweat (yah)
But illin"ll get you - (bruised), I kill and I step to - (crews) 
And abuse two's and three's, who's the g that hoe's know (me)
Me & Hiero, I know, (I'm fly, bro)
So why flow if you're not invigerating (why)
I know where you live, 
there at your crib, 
(I got niggas waitin')
I figure raping is crime, see (see)
I take my time, be	 (b)
And now your g (is my g)
Now I'm gonna show you how the west coast smacks kids
(Yo), I rhyme, it swells, so the hell with a (wack dis)
(Generalizing), 
dissin' before you've ever seen this
So you can get the middle (what middle?), the penis

Never the match the miraculous tactics
I smack tricks, the wax is at your wack bitch
(I crack bricks)
who can't cum
I leave'm broke and dumb
def, and plus I'm causin' cardiac arrest
You need some rest
(Check), as I'm chizzlin' (riddles in) your memory
Remember me? 
I hacked your body to pieces
(Disassembling) your (blows)
you bros started trembling from shock and trauma
(I'm water) 
in lives when I bomb-a
babbling dislexic, I make'em exit
This lifetime, I wake up words, (I excite rhymes)
I'm enthusin' when I'm bruisin'
Hoes, take off your shoes when I abuse men
Your losin'

If you slept on Del
That's when ya lost

Steppin' to Pep love
That's when ya lost

Phuckin' around with J-Biz
That's when ya lost

Step to Mike G
That's when ya lost

Smoke on that crackrock
That's when ya lost

The Souls of Mischief??
That's when ya lost

When you don't know where your goin'???
That's when ya lost

When you don't win!!??
That's when ya lost

Phuckin' around with Hierogliphics
That's when ya lost

If you phuck with The Shamen
That's when ya lost

That's when ya lost

(That's when you lose - proper)

That's when ya lost

(scratching)
