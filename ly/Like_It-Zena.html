		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I guess I forgot how to turn my phone off
I'm outside my comfort zone
I'm tired of being lonely, tam-tara-ram
Nobody gonna like this, no
Okay, I don't like these empty words
I'll go even if it really hurts
It's making me stronger, tam-tara-ram
I know it's gonna be

Oh, what should I do?
It's up to you, karma
Oh, I wish I knew
Give me a sign, karma
Just to remind you
I don't give up (give up)
I won't give up, no
I'll always try

Yes, you gonna like it
Yes, you gonna like it (let me in your heart)
Yes, you gonna like it
Yes, you gonna like it (let's break the rules)
Yes, you gonna like it
Yes, you gonna like it (I'll share what I've got)
Yes, you gonna like it
Yes, you gonna like it (baby, repeat my moves)

It feels crazy and a little wild
I know what is wrong and what is right
It's making me wiser, tam-tara-ram
The universe is ours now
Okay, put your favourite sneakers on
And show your emotions on the floor
Add hashtag to find ya, tam-tara-ram
I know it's gonna be

Oh, what should I do?
It's up to you, karma
Oh, I wish I knew
Give me a sign, karma
Just to remind you
I don't give up
I won't give up, no
I'll always try

Yes, you gonna like it
Yes, you gonna like it (let me in your heart)
Yes, you gonna like it
Yes, you gonna like it (let's break the rules)
Yes, you gonna like it
Yes, you gonna like it (I'll share what I've got)
Yes, you gonna like it
Yes, you gonna like it (baby, repeat my moves)

Heya, give me fly, give me fly, give me fly
Heya, like it too, like it too, like it too, baby

I feel the flow of energy
I should let go mistakes of me
I feel the flow of energy, yeah
And you go with me, baby

Yes, you gonna like it
Yes, you gonna like it (let me in your heart)
Yes, you gonna like it
Yes, you gonna like it (let's break the rules)
Yes, you gonna like it
Yes, you gonna like it (I'll share what I've got)
Yes, you gonna like it
Yes, you gonna like it
Yes, you gonna like it
Yes, you gonna like it (let me in your heart)
Yes, you gonna like it
Yes, you gonna like it (let's break the rules)
Yes, you gonna like it
Yes, you gonna like it (I'll share what I've got)
Yes, you gonna like it
Yes, you gonna like it (baby, repeat my moves)
