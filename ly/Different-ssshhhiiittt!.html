		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm so tired to be different
I really hate a color red
I want to be normal very want
I want a lot of money to spend
 
 
I thought that I'm very stupid
Bats I hear well not a cooped
Because I have no heart
And no morning to buy a bread
Every time a steal late for aided
And I got to be angel later
I am very, very strange man
I deal myself it's again
Nobody loves me, I did not cry
My favorite activity — a read to cry
What a strange life from killed my love
My favorite activity — a read to cry
 
 
I'm so tired to be different
I really hate a color red
I want to be normal very want
I want a lot of money to spend
 
Every time a steal late for aided
And I got to be angel later
I am very very strange man
I deal my self it's again
What is your name before is not matter?
What is my name in my isolator?
Why is world he love is the grate?
Am just the fucking skater
