		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hate to see you running to your friends
Telling them you hate me and it's nonsense
Or even worst you catch me with red hands
Or even worst you catch me fucking your friends
Legs shaking and it feels like a machine gun
Rain falls the same way I throw up all the ones
Gas pedal loose hitting like a tommy gun
Come and go but you stay cuz you know I'm one of one
I
Know you been waiting a while
To pull up on a Saturday night
I swear I didn't mean to hide
The truth
Now I can see it in your
eyes
That something's just not right
Cause you can see right through my lies
And I can't form the words to say
to you
Your friends they always come at night
Night ends
all the same
All your friends
Are calling me
Stars up in the roof
And all the stars all in the room we say
Hands up
Hands up
Lemme see them bad bitches
What's up
What's up
Take another shot with them
I can't let you front and get your way aye
Cuz you've been on my mind and playing games
Aren't you
And somehow I let you get in the way aye
But once you slip up I get with your friends
I get with your friends
Friends.
Legs shaking and it feels like a machine gun
Rain falls the same way I throw up all the ones
Gas pedal loose hitting like a tommy gun
Come and go but you stay cuz you know I'm one of one
Woof woof
Woof woof woof woof
I'm back in town
I'm better now
But I don't talk about it
Got 6 with me
We undefeated
They stay bothered bout it
I don't talk shit
But Unlike this
AI be talking bout it
But I'm still real about it
Don't care how you feel
I'm still here
Moving moving moving with your friends
Bodies, rolling
The party never ends
