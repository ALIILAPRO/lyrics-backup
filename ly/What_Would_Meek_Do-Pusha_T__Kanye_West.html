		<p>
		  Niggas talkin' shit, Push
How do you respond?

I'm top five and all of them Dylan
I am the hope, the dope dealers won
Price and the quote, the dope dealers want
Feds takin' pictures like it's GQ (GQ)
This Avianne collarbone is see-through
Angel on my shoulder, "What should we do?"
Devil on the other, "What would Meek do?"
Pop a wheelie, tell the judge to Akinyele
Middle fingers out the Ghost, screamin' "Makaveli" (come with me)
Hail Mary, the scale fairy
Two sides to every coin, so we bail ready (bail ready)
How do you respond?
I let the monies and the fools talk
I let the jewels and the hues talk
Watch face came with a fuse box (fuse box)
Chanel's on ya bitch
The coupe is 320, the roof's hit or miss
Murder on the highway, the news is at six
See I did it my way, the proof's in the bricks (woo)
Yeugh, smell it through the Tupperware (Tupperware)
Two can get you four like a double dare
I'm the king of the oven-ware (oven-ware)
You can piece the whole puzzle here

Niggas talkin' shit, Ye
How do you respond?

Poop, scoop
Whoop, whoopty-whoop
Am I too complex for ComplexCon?
Everything Ye say cause a new debate
"You see, he been out of touch, he cannot relate
His hallway too long, bitch too bad
Gotta surrogate his kid, get two dads"
I be thinkin', what would 2Pac do?
You be thinkin' what New Kids on the Block do
If you ain't drivin' while Black, do they stop you?
Will MAGA hats let me slide like a drive-thru?
That phone call from Ricky still hazy
When heaven got an angel named Avery
You gotta watch who you callin' crazy
Yeezy, the newest billion-dollar baby
It won't feel right 'til I feel like Phil Knight
Goin' for six rings like what Phil told Mike
Seven pill nights, who know what that feel like?
No more hidin' the scars, I show 'em like Seal, right?
How do you respond?
