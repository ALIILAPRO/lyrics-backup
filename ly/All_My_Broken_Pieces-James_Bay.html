		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell me what it's like
To not wake up, wake up and wonder
Every single night
Always
I'm sat bolt upright
Watching her sleep, I wish I can join her
Every single night
Always

When I'm falling in, when I'm falling down
She knows just how to sort me out
She knows just how

And, when I lose, she lays on me
And nothing else matters
She takes all my broken pieces, and she puts them together
When I'm through, she stands by me
When everything shatters
She takes all my broken pieces, and she makes them fit better
All my broken pieces

I don't know what it means
To lean on someone and not pull them under
But she's so good to me
Always
She showed me what it's like
To not wake up, wake up and wonder
Every single night
Always

She told me I could start again
Turn off the lights, turn off my head
And start again

And, when I lose, she lays on me
And nothing else matters
She takes all my broken pieces, and she puts them together
When I'm through, she stands by me
When everything shatters
She takes all my broken pieces, and she makes them fit better
All my broken pieces
All my broken pieces

She knows what I need, knows what I need, knows what I need
Yeah, she knows what I need, knows what I need
Oh

And, when I lose, she lays on me
And nothing else matters
She takes all my broken pieces, and she puts them together
When I'm through, she stands by me
When everything shatters
She takes all my broken pieces, and she makes them fit better
All my broken pieces
All my broken pieces

All my broken pieces
All my broken pieces, ah, yeah
All my broken pieces, oh, yeah
All my broken pieces, whoa-oh
All my broken pieces, oh-oh, oh-oh
All my broken pieces
