		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Time stop tonight from insanity
Slow slide fade away make it pay insanity
It feels like no one want to pay
But deep inside I so insane of you

Cause everyday we dream about future
I am afraid, we can loose it

Time stop tonight from insanity

It feels like no one want to pay
But deep inside I so insane of you

Cause everyday we dream about future
I am afraid, we can loose it

We can fly away
To play for yourself
I can destroy this world
To win my own war
It's make me cold
This is not fair
I wondering
If you insane
