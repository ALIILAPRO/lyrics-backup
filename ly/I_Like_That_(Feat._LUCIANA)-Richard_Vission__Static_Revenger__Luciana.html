		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (I like that) my body rocks a rhythm
You beat my drum hard
I might just kick it kick it
You wanna lick it lick it
I love to stick it stick it

From London to L.A.
Yeah that's the ticket ticket
Come on and kiss it kiss it

(I like that) I like the Gucci Gucci
I love the dollar bill
I love your pocket rocket
We live to shock it shock it
I like the way you smile
I might just bite your lip
I see you talking talking
Your hands are talking talking

I like that
I like that
I like your dirty mind
Mine's on it all the time
Oh let me shake it shake it
I'll Polaroid it shake it

I'm a graffiti girl
I wanna spray it spray it
I like to throw the paint
You wanna throw the paint?

(I like that) I'm locking not hip hopping
You lace me up right
You getting tricky tricky
You're getting sticky sticky

(I like that) I like the 8-track
It takes me way back
I'd love to bite New York
Avec un knife and fork
My body rocks the rhythm
You beat my drum hard

I like that I like that I like that
I like that
Oh (I like that)
I love the money money
I'm dripping dripping gold
I like to disco baby
You wanna kiss now baby?

My body rocks a rhythm
You beat my drum hard
My body rock the rhythm
(Rocks the rhythm rocks the rhythm)
My body rocks the rhythm
You beat my drum hard
My body rocks the rhythm
(Rocks the rhythm rocks the rhythm)

I like that I like that I like that I like that I like that 
(I like that) I like that I like that I like that I like that
(I like that)
(I like that)
