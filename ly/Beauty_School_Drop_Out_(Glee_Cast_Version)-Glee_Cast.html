		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Your story's sad to tell
A teenage ne'er do well
Most mixed up no-delinquent on the block
Your futures so unclear now
What's left of your career now
Can't even get a trade in on your smile

Beauty school dropout
No graduation day for you
Beauty school dropout
Missed your mid-terms and flunked shampoo
Well at least you could have taken time to wash and clean
Your clothes up
After spending all that dough to have the doctor fix you nose up

Baby get moving (Better get movin)
Why keep your feeble hopes alive
What are you proving (What are you provin)
You've got the dream but not the drive

If you go for your diploma you will join a steno pool
Turn in your teasin comb and go back to high school

Beauty school dropout (Beauty school dropout)
Hanging around the corner store
Beauty school dropout (Beauty school dropout)
It's about time you knew the score

Well they couldn't teach you anything you think you're such a looker
But no customer would go to you unless she was a hooker

Baby don't sweat it (Don't sweat it)
You're not cut out to hold a job
Better forget it (Forget it)
Who wants their hair done by a slob?

Now your bangs are curled your lashes whirled but still the world is cruel
Wipe off that angel face and go back to high school

Baby don't blow it
Don't put my good advice to shame
Baby you know it
Even Dear Abby'd say the same

Now I've called the shot, get off the block, I really gotta fly
Gotta be going to that malt shop in the sky

Beauty school dropout (Beauty school dropout)
Go back to high school

Beauty school dropout (Beauty school dropout)
Go back to high school

Beauty school dropout (Beauty school dropout)
Go back to high school
