		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They don't know, I do it for the culture, goddamn
They say I should watch the shit I post, oh goddamn
Say I'm turning big girls into hoes, oh goddamn
They say I get groupies at my shows, oh goddamn

All the rumors are true, yeah
What ya' heard, that's true, yeah
I fuck him and you, yeah
If you believe I do that

Had to cut some hoes loose, yeah
NDA, no loose lips
Now them hoes tryna sue me
Bitch, I don't give two shits

All the rumors are true, yeah
I've been in the bamboo, yeah
Focused on this music
My ex nigga, he blew it

Last year, I thought I would lose it
Reading shit on the internet
My smoothie cleanse and my diet
No, I ain't fuck Drake yet

Spending all your time tryna break a woman down
Realer shit is going on, baby, take a look around
If you thought that I was ratchet with my ass hanging out
Just wait until the summer when they let me out the house, bitch

(Talk and talk and talk and)
(Give 'em somethin' to talk about)

Sick of rumors
But haters do what they do (uh)
Haters do what they do (Cardi)

All the rumors are true, yeah
Fake ass, fake boobs, yeah
Made a million at Sue's, yeah
Y'all be runnin' with fake news, yeah

Cardi ain't poppin', no, that's a machine (huh?)
Nobody listen', they buyin' them streams (hmm)
They even post it on blogs overseas
A lie in a language I can't even read
The fuck does this mean?

Look, I'm a Bronx bitch with some pop hits
Used to pop off when they pop shit (woo)
But I'm calmed down and I'm locked in
And my records live in the top ten

Lizzo, teach me about big girl coochie (okay)
Last time I got freaky, the FCC sued me
But I'mma keep doing what I wanna do
'Cause all the rumors are, all the rumors are true, yeah

They hated on me since school, yeah
I never thought I was cool, yeah
Now me and Cardi, we cool, yeah

I love hoes on poles, yeah (woo)
I am body goals, yeah
This shit from my soul, yeah
Black people made rock and roll, yeah

While you're spending all your time tryna break a woman down
Realer shit is going on, baby, take a look around
If you thought that I was ratchet with my ass hanging out
Just wait until the summer when they let me out the house, bitch

What they say? (Yeah)
What they say? (Yeah)
(Talk and talk and talk and)
Give 'em something to talk about

Sick of rumors
But haters do what they do
Haters do what they do
All the rumors are true

(Rumors, yeah)
Yeah, sheesh
