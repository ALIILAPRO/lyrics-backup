		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Spitting gas on the fire
That's burning this town
Pieces really conspire
We shut'em all down
Then suddenly I'm breaking past the lies
It's something magical
We outta say a lullaby
Into the pain I go
Say our last goodbye
Suddenly

Tired of living the straight life outside the lines
Open up to disaster and paradise
We're standing on the edge
Then suddenly I'm breaking past the lies
It's something magical
We outta say a lullaby
Into the pain I go
Say our last goodbye
Suddenly

Where should I go? I cannot be the one I see in magazines
Where should I go? I cannot be the one I see in magazines
Where should I go? I cannot be the one I see in magazines
Where should I go? I cannot be the one I see in magazines
Then suddenly I'm breaking past the lies
It's something magical
We outta say a lullaby
Into the pain I go
Say our last goodbye
Suddenly
Suddenly
Then suddenly, yeah
