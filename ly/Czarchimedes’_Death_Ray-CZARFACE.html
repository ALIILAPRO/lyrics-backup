		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't think nobody better than me
I don't think no one person can stop me
And I never get tired of playing
CZARFACE

Yo (CZAR)
I'm thankful, my family got food on the plate
How I'm selling 'em the smoke like I'm moving an 8th
I'm the great, you a cruiserweight proven a fake
No mistake, name tricky but they used to the face
That's your highness, INS journalist extraordinaire
He over there in the thousand-dollar Jordan Airs
Money on my mind but never let it possess me
Stress-free, wanna ride the wave? This the jet-ski (CZARFACE)
Don't whine or waste time tryna catch me
I'm gone 'til November then gone again the next week
No clocking out, that's the grave shift
Overtime with the grind next day shift
I'm from the days of Benettons and Asics
Basic same, shit, fix your faces
So foreign I came in a UFO
Sicario flow, y'all fresh pompano
(You know what time it is, man) you know how it go
I bet you'll learn today so now you know
Now they know? Now they know

(Mean, mean character)
And look who's here

Czar, Czar that's the main character to blame, leader of the gang
Grab the mic and fuck it up as though it's Bert Kreischer's name
No matter how the say it, yo, it's never quite the same
Czartifical Intelligence, got the chip inside my brain
Esoteric rebel against all the shit I'm finding lame
Your comebacks are Kristaps meaning they're poor zingers
Like four-fingered rings I keep shit together, yo, I might refrain from
Fronting on anything that I stated
You don't want a pissing contest, I'm fully hydrated (tell 'em)
You the jerk in here, you could get murked in here (murked)
Suit yourself Nanotech working here
Tryna don the armor, get your own shit (come on)
It's like Pascal Siak in a Fiat, uh
It won't fit, it don't fit, you the cuprit
Practice what you preach 'fore you hit the pulpit (true)
Keep the gun, I'll take Olivia Munn
Caribbean Rum and run shit while you twiddle your thumbs
You ignorant bums, you dumb like looking into the sun
I put heads to bed like going where Biggie is from

Rest in peace Blacastan

(Yeah, yes, and)
(Mean, mean character)
(Esoteric)

On, uh, when I'm in the air, I don't know what to do
I just do it when I get in the air, you know
I'm either gon' dunk it or just lay it up
