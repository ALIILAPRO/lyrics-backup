		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Save your love
For someone who's never gonna run
For someone who's there when you wake up
But be careful who you choose
'Cause you still got a heart to lose

You know it ain't good for you
When you follow him 'round, follow him 'round
Like he's some god to you
Liftin' you up, knockin' you down
Then he stops callin' you
And you try to keep it hid
But you're drownin' in your tears
As I watch you disappear

We're grown enough to make our own decisions
I'm not just sayin' things to blur your vision
The truth is that it's more than intuition
Even if your body doesn't wanna listen

Save your love
For someone who's never gonna run
For someone who's there when you wake up
But be careful who you choose, uh-huh
'Cause you still got a heart to lose
Save your love
For someone who will appreciate
Who's willing to give the time it takes
I wish that it wasn't true, ah-ha
But he ain't good enough for you

I wanna do right for you
Be your shoulder to cry, dryin' your eyes
You know that I'd fight for you
'Til the end of the night, day that I die
Don't wanna have to watch you fall apart
I'll stay 'til you say you're okay

We're grown enough to make our own decisions
I'm not just sayin' things to blur your vision
The truth is that it's more than intuition
Even if your body doesn't wanna listen

Save your love
For someone who's never gonna run
For someone who's there when you wake up
But be careful who you choose, uh-huh
'Cause you still got a heart to lose
Save your love
For someone who will appreciate
Who's willing to give the time that it takes
I wish that it wasn't true, ah-ha
But he ain't good enough for you

Save your love
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, your love (save your love)
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, your love (save your love)
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, your love (save your love)
Save your love
