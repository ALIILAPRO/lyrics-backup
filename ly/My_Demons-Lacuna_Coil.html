		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And I don't know what to say
I'm thinking about you
It's hurting without you
I never learn from my mistakes

I feel fucked up today
My demons cursing me as I'm awake
My head is spinning I can't explain
Your words are poison inside my veins

You lied
I don't believe you I can't relate
You lied!
I hate your voice cause it sounds so fake
(You lied)

And I don't know what to say
I'm thinking about you
It's hurting without you
I never learn from my mistakes
I'm thinking about you
I'm choking without you
And I don't know what to say

I should've walked away
And break the circle that never ends
No other way to survive the pain
It's either I kill or I will be killed

You lied
But I'm still giving myself away
You lied!
I don't regret every single day
(You lied)

And I don't know what to say
I'm thinking about you
It's hurting without you
I never learn from my mistakes
I'm thinking about you
I'm choking without you
And I don't know what to say

I think of you and I can't forget
Every word you said hurts inside my head
Cannot let you go, things will never change

I feel fucked up today
It's either I kill or I will be killed
(You lied)

And I don't know what to say
I'm thinking about you
It's hurting without you
I never learn from my mistakes
I'm thinking about you
I'm choking without you
And I know right now

Just the way that I will be killed
You lied
