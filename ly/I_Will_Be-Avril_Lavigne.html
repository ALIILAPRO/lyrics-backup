		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's nothing I can say to you
Nothing I could ever do to make you see
What you mean to me
All the pain the tears I cried
Still you never said goodbye and now I know how far you'd go
I know I let you down but its not like that now
This time I'll never let you go

I will be all that you want and get my self together
'Cause you keep me from falling apart
All my life I'll be with you forever
To get you through the day and make every thing OK

I thought that I had every thing I didn't know what life could bring
But now I see honestly
You're the one thing I got right
The only one I let inside
Now I can breathe 'cause you're here with me
And if I let you down I'll turn it all around
Cause I would never let you go

I will be all that you want and get my self together
'Cause you keep me from falling apart
All my life I'll be with you forever
To get you through the day and make every thing OK

'Cause with out you I can't sleep
I'm not gonna ever ever let you leave
You're all I got
You're all I want
Yeah
And with out you I don't know what I'll do
I could never ever live a day with out you
Here with me do you see you're all I need

And I will be all that you want and get my self together
'Cause you keep me from falling apart
All my life (my life) I will be with you forever
To get you through the day and make every thing OK

I will be (I'll be) all that you want and get my self together
'Cause you keep me from falling apart
And all my life you know I will be with you forever
To get you through the day and make every thing OK
