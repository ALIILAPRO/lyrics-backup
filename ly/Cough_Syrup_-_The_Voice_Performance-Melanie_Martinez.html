		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you, please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him just because you can

Your beauty is beyond compare with flaming locks of auburn hair
With ivory skin and eyes of emerald green
Your smile is like a breath of spring, your voice is soft like summer rain
And I cannot compete with you, Jolene

And he talks about you in his sleep and there's nothing I can do to keep
From crying when he calls your name, Jolene
And I can easily understand how you could easily take my man
But you don't know what he means to me, Jolene

Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you, please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him just because you can

You could have your choice of men but I could never love again
no he's the only one for me, Jolene
And I had to have this talk with you 'cause my happiness depends on you
And whatever you decide to do, Jolene

Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you, please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him even though you can

Jolene, Jolene, Jolene

Jolene
Jolene
Jo-Jo-Jolene

Jolene
Jo-Jolene
