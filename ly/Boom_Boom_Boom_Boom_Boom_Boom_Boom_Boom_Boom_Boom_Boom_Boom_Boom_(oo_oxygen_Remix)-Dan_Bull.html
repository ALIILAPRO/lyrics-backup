		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm a Creeper, Minecraft's Grim Reaper
Blowing up blocks like Al-Qaeda (bang)
I'm not a creature that'll eat ya (nah)
But I'll leave ya petrified, Peter
Remind peeps of Minesweeper
Clicking on a brick then you die in the deep
I'll find your mine, I'm a mind reader
Now the mine is mine, it's finders-keepers
Oh, hi, I'm a Creeper (hey)
So nice, nice to meet ya (oh)
Is that the time? It's time to leave
And tick-tock, tick-tock

Boom, boom, boom (ha, ha)
I can't stop singing this bloody tune, tune, tune (yeah, yeah)
It's gonna make my brain go boom, boom, boom (ha, ha)
I can't stop singing this bloody tune, tune, tune (yeah, yeah)
(Pew, pew, pew, pew, hey)

I do what I wanna (woo), move aside, mama (woo)
Tick-tick, I'm a suicide bomber (bang)
I take control then I'm gonna (what?)
Leave a gaping hole, Belladonna
That'll take it's toll
When I'm on a quest to invade, detonate your soul (sss)
Fizz like a lemonade then blow (boom)
So you better stay indoors
Or I'll find your mine when you're mining ore (ore)
You'll be dying, lying in gore
Darling, aw, what you crying for?
Did somebody break your diamond sword? (Ha)
I'm the volatilest sort
What a violent force that'll frighten Spartans
Hark and hear Leonidas talk
When he sees me, "Tonight, we dine indoors"

Boom, boom, boom (ha, ha)
I can't stop singing this bloody tune, tune, tune (yeah, yeah)
It's gonna make my brain go boom, boom, boom (ha, ha)
I can't stop singing this bloody tune, tune, tune (yeah, yeah)
(Boom, hey)

It's official, a ballistic missile
Couldn't get this result (nah)
I blow through stone like a six-foot chisel
So you'd better shiver when you hear that sizzle
Fo-shizzle
Take a listen (huh?), it's a premonition of my mission (huh)
Death by demolition
If I don't come home, there's a sign in my kitchen
To describe why I'm missing (why?), "Gone fission"
White hot raps, I got stacks
Sometimes when I die, I drop tracks
I got a lot, Ocelot, fight off cats
If I'm feeling nice then I might not blast

Boom, boom, boom (ha, ha)
I can't stop singing this bloody tune, tune, tune (yeah, yeah)
It's gonna make my brain go boom, boom, boom (ha, ha)
I can't stop singing this bloody tune, tune, tune (yeah, yeah)
(Boom) My hobbies and interests include going boom, boom, boom
