		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Maze, psychopathic daze, I create this waste
Back away from tangents on the verge of drastic ways
Can't escape this place, I deny your face
Sweat gets in my eyes, I think I'm slowly dying

Put me in a homemade cellar
Put me in a hole for shelter

Someone hear me please, all I see is hate
I can hardly breathe and I can hardly take it
Hands on my face over bearing, I can't get out
Lost, ran at my own cost hearing laughter, scoffed

Learning from the rush, detached from such
And such bleak all around me, weak listening, incomplete
I am not a dog but I'm the one your dogging
I am in a buried kennel, I have never felt so final

Someone find me please, losing all reserve
I am fucking gone, I think I'm fucking dying
You all stare but you'll never see
There is something inside me

There is something in you I despise
Cut me, show me, enter
I am willing and able and never any danger to myself
Knowledge in my pain, knowledge in my pain
Or was my tolerance a phase?
Empathy, out of my way, I can't die, purity
