		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey
Make some noise for your mama's favorite agitator
I ain't sayin' none, 'less I'm speaking for the paper
The great debater, my life is like an elevator
I'm going down, if you weren't with me then you walk with Satan
A wise man once said, nah he didn't say none
Now I got paid some, I waffle like a fucking baker
To survive, got me feeling like a fucking faker
Tippy-toeing through a hell, not tryna meet my maker

You ever see the sun?
You ever walk my way?
I never felt at home
Nah, never in this place
I never saw the sun
I never walked this way
It never was my home
Nah, never, not this place (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Busy making new trauma so I got something to rap about
Self-inflicted stabbing doubt
Baby, what's that about?
So, acting like I don't know
And of course I blame my boots for the faults of my toe
L-L, L-L-L-
Living life in a daze, I don't know where-where I'm going
I get back to the airport like "Honey, I'm home"
Boy, I bathe in sin, and still I cast the first stone
Satan saw me again and said, "Nigga, get gone"

You ever see the sun?
You ever walk my way?
I never felt at home
Nah, never in this place
I never saw the sun
I never walked this way
It never was my home
Nah, never, not this place

Peter Pipe (Piper)
I'm Peter Piper
Peter Pipe (yeah)
I'm Peter Piper
I'm Peter Pipe
I'm Peter Piper
It's hot, yeah
It's hot, yeah
Peter Pipe
I'm Peter Piper
I'm Peter Pipe
I'm Peter Piper
I'm Peter Pipe
I'm Peter Piper
It's hot, yeah
Hell is hot, yeah

I suffered at my least
What comes will come to me
What comes will come to me
What comes will come to me
I suffered at my least
What comes will come to me
What comes will come to me
I can feel your everything
I can feel your everything
What comes will come to me
I suffered at my least
What comes will come to me
What comes will come to me
What comes will come to me (I can feel your)
I can feel your
I can feel your everything
I can feel your
I can feel your everything (what comes will come to me)
I suffered at my least (yeah)
What comes will come to me (I can feel your everything)
What comes will come to me
What comes will come to me
