		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Money makes me feel better
You told me it was a ticket to hell
Okay, how come?
Do you think that I'm a devil?
Sex makes me feel better
How could you judge me?
I know you don't deserve to
Now you act like a pharisee

When I was poor
My mom was stressed out
Now look, money made me
A good boy to my mom
When I was poor
I was like a hungry fox
Now look, I saved a lotta
Buddies from the basement
I just bought a christian
It's blinging on my body
I'm toasting with celebrities
At the same bar
Hey, pretty
Do you wanna fuck with me?
That's no problem
But Sunday morning is coming
I gotta go to church

I'm still fucking christian
Though I'm wearing new "christian"
You should check my algorithm
It's not much different from the old me
I'm still fucking christian
Though I'm wearing new "christian"
You should check my algorithm
It's not much different from the old me
I'm still fucking christian

I'm still fucking christian
I'm still fucking 
Stinky smell's stuck in my room
Even after I took a shower
How can I erase it
Where's the origin?
Hey Mr. I'm talking about you
What's funny? seriously?
You feel this disgusting smell
I think it's from your stinky breath
Street people, you think you're smart
You think you got no god
But I know you worship yourself
What a stupid god!
Is your god a liar?
Your god is so outrageous
You would better die

I just bought a christian
It's blinging on my body
I'm toasting with celebrities
At the same bar
Hey pretty, do you wanna fuck with me? 
That's no problem
But Sunday morning is coming
I gotta go to church

I'm still fucking christian
Though I'm wearing new "christian"
You should check my algorithm
It's not much different from the old me
I'm still fucking christian
Though I'm wearing new "christian"
You should check my algorithm
It's not much different from the old me
I'm still fucking christian
I'm still fucking christian
I'm still fucking

Oh, lord, forgive my people
I didn't know what I've done
Oh, lord, look at my finger
Dirt is stuck in my nails
Oh, lord, please clean my tongue
It's covered by pukes and phlegms
Oh mom, now I get it why you told me
That you wanna go back
When I was a child
I'm still fucking christian
