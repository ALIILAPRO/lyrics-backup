		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You find yourself
Trapped in a room
With somebody else
Don't want to hurt you
They just want to see you run Like never before
They'll control you
They think your happiness
Is something to be sold
They are going to break you
And all your motivation
It starts to unfold
I can tell
I don't even want you anymore
I tried but
I don't even want this anymore
I can't
I don't even want you anymore, more, more We say what we want to
Oh we live how we want to
Baby I die when I want to
Because I got no place to go
So take me
You find yourself
Begging for just a little bit more
They will steal your soul
But won't even leave a scar
They'll control you
They think your happiness
Is something to be sold
They are going to break you
And all your motivation 
It starts to unfold
We say what we want to
Oh we live how we want to
Baby I die when I want to
Because I got no place to go
So take me
So take me
So take me
So take me
