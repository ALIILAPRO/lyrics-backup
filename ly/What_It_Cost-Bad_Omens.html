		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You wanna take, take, take
You wanna break, break, break my heart
But now I know my place
I know just what you are, ohh

Like a villain (ooh)
I couldn't be (ooh)
I didn't need it (ooh)
It needed me (ooh)

Like a villain (ooh)
I couldn't be (ooh)
I didn't need it (ooh)
It needed me (ooh)

Like a villain

You couldn't wait, wait, wait
For the day, day, day I lost
It's such a shame, shame, shame
You couldn't change, look what it cost, ohh

Like a villain (ooh)
I couldn't be (ooh)
I didn't need it (ooh)
It needed me (ooh)
