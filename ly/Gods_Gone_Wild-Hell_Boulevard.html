		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What if God is the devil
And the devil's a grand disguise
Just a bait for the rebels
A temple built on blood and lies
What if he turns the table
With a cross spinning upside down
Artificial and evil 
A plastic king, a paper crown

Just a look and you will know
Who are the preachers of the show
They will taint your soul
With paradise and angel's dope
It's the symmetry of the sky
When it's dark we beg for light
For the kingdom's gold
They will start a war 

They say we are wrong
They say they are strong
Let's sing all along
Of gods gone wild
We'll burn down the throne
Strip them to the bones
We'll die one by one
For gods gone wild 

What if God is the villain 
And the hero's the fallen king
God is selling forgiveness
He's feeding on our misery 

It's the equation of our life
Afraid you live and scared you die
For the virtue's fall 
They will start a war

When the night will come
We will count the scars
And there's no prey that matters
When the gods gone wild
