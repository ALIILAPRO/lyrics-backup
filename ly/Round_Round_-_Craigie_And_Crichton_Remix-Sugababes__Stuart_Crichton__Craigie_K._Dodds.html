		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Round, round baby round, round 
Spinning out on me 
I don't need no man 
Got my kicks for free 
And we'll ride still fired on the beat down low
I don't need nobody got my honeys 
When I go round, baby round round 
Spend the night on me 
I don't need no man 
Got my kicks for free 
(Free free free free) 

When you stare at my face
You're messing with my brain 
If you're try to convince me 
Then you better think again 
If you move to my music 
The music's got to give 
If it's too complicated 
That's the way I want to live 

If you hate me 
I will show you 
How to break me 
Into something new 
If you want me 
Run away now 
If you stop me 
Then I'll hit the ground 
(And we go, and we go) 

Round, round baby round, round 
Spend the night on me 
I don't need no man 
Got my kicks for free 
And we'll ride still fired on the beat down low
I don't need nobody got my honeys 
When I go 

Explanations, no you don't need one 
Having a good time 
Getting down to the fun 
And it's your time 
Just tonight he'll be mine 
And he's gone 
Yeah 

People moving, bodies grooving 
Never ending 
Players are changing
(Don't you worry 'bout a thing all you need is one fierce string) 
All my girls are here with me 
Worry now they've got their need 
(Do you feel me, do you feel me, do you feel me, do you feel me) 
Woo 

Round, round baby round, round 
Spend the night on me 
I don't need no man 
Got my kicks for free 
We'll ride still fired on the beat down low 
I don't need nobody got my honeys 
When I go round baby round round 
Spend the night on me 
I don't need no man 
Got my kicks for free 
And we'll ride still fired on the beat down low
I don't need nobody but my honeys 
When I go 

Ooh 
Does it hurt, when you see 
How I've done 
Without you 
Thought that I couldn't belong 
Never thought that you could be so cruel 
All you need is some friends 
Won't be by yourself 
Let's go round and round and round and round and are-o-you-nd 

Round, round baby round, round 
Spend the night on me 
I don't need no man 
Got my kicks for free 
We'll ride still fired on the beat down low 
I don't need nobody got my honeys 
When I go round baby round round 
Spend the night on me 
I don't need no man 
Got my kicks for free 
We'll ride still fired on the beat down low
I don't need nobody but my honeys 
When I go 

Round, baby when I go 
When I go 
(When I go) 
When I go 
(When I go) 
When I go 
When I go round baby 
(When I go) 
When I go 
(When I go) 
When I go 
(When I go) 
When I go 

When I go
