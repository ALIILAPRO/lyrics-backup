		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey, I'm a believer
And gravity's letting go of me tonight
You, came out of nowhere
When everything was passing by at the speed of light

So hold my hand and never let me go
Take a leap of fate into the unknown

I am flying
My heart is taking over
The world is flashing by
Higher higher higher
I will follow wherever it might take us
Chasing through the sky
Higher higher higher

Oh I know
It can be scary
You bet it all when your heart is on the line
But oh, baby don't worry
Just hold my hand and never let me go

I am flying
My heart is taking over
The world is flashing by
Higher higher higher
I will follow wherever it might take us
Chasing through the sky
Higher higher higher
