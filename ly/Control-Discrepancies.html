		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Doc says nothing's wrong, but I feel like somethings got to be 
How can I function properly with dysfunction inside of me
Honestly I'm an anomaly, constantly stage conquering 
An oddity on an odyssey to rage without apology yo
Come take a sip of my sickness if you think it's a bluff
And for those who can't get enough, we'll be filling your cup
You can feel the adrenaline in the building, we're building it up 
The games in a serious clutch, trust that we're giving up

1 for my people
2 for the show
3 for my homies out here grinding on the road
We're up in here now
We come to get down
We shutting shit down
Get up and get down

See I hit the stage and I lost control
I may have lost my mind but I brought the flows
I had to toss my woes I exhausted those
We left the cons behind now I rock with pros
And I just got a message from a senorita 
Who always acts surprised when she see's my reply
Ripping shows out on the road so they can see why we fly
But St. Louis will forever be my C-I-T-Y
See I, get the feeling someone's testing me
Who knew a little bit of illness was the recipe
Relinquishing control, giving you the best of me
With no regrets, won't rest until I rest in peace and leave

1 for my people
2 for the show
3 for my homies out here grinding on the road
We're up in here now
We come to get down
We shutting shit down
Get up and get down
4 for the destination 
5 for the ride
6 for everyone who overcame all odds
We up in here now
We come to get down
We shutting shit down
Get up and get down

You want to give them something to remember when your caskets laid
Hit the road with some goals and a path to blaze
Let go, lose control as you crash the stage
You can stop fishing for props and massive praise 
Because I don't got a lot but you know I had to save
