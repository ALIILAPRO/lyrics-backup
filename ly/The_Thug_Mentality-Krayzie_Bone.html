		<p>
		  T.H.U.G we be,
That's thug mentality we're thuggin'
Thuggin thuggin it's the way I choose to live my life
T.H.U.G we be,
That's thug mentality we're thuggin'
Thuggin thuggin thuggin till the day I die.
(repeat)

I done been around tha world
And everywhere be tha same song.
Niggaz struggle daily gotta survive
It's worldwide, even niggaz in paris and london be hustlin'
Doin whatever jus to get tha money.
Lookin at the whole world flooded with thugs, but you got to keep it
Real if you want to make it through to live gotta get in it to win it, 
and makin' dough to save your kids, gotta handle your business, 
gotta get in it to win it, and then you gotta get up on it, hit it.
And that's real really, my thugs feel me put your fists in the air yeah.
Niggas comin to the war and imma meet you niggas there.
Ready to rumble, I swear, we coming from everywhere.
Where my thugs at, where they at?
Fuck that
Nigga lets do in da enemy now, terminate em eliminate em
Takin out our frustration on the world get em back for the Playa Hation.
So come on we gotta roll, and wouldn't you know
They aint ready for the war.
Rob tha rich take some
Give tha rest ot tha poor
Make them feel the pain, two double o-o,
Its the end of the road. So what you gonna do?
Imma ride you can die if you want to.
But all them real souljahz come on move!
Get your suits on, boots keeps troopin' on (troopin' on).
T-H ( t-h ) U-G ( u-g ) that's thug we be
Across the nation pump your fist and get ready for this occasion.
Better get'cha fade on, I wanna see victory.
Ya better roll wit this cuz we splittin'em,
Fuck that we winnin'em.
That's thug mentality.

T.H.U.G we be,
That's thug mentality we're thuggin'
Thuggin thuggin it's the way I choose to live my life
T.H.U.G we be,
That's thug mentality we're thuggin'
Thuggin thuggin thuggin till the day I die.
(repeat)

Be a thug if you wanna be a thug, be a thug if you got to.
Throw it up, keep it in the air,
Scream it out "thug! thug! thug! thug!"
Thuggin till the day I die, when I'm high
If you look into my eyes, you'll truly find, no kind
Like I gemini. gotta control both sides.
My lordy lord maintain,it's hard, cause im a souljah at war.
Steady runnin wit the weapons cause it's gettin better.
I figured it out, it's all real, if aint then it aint right.
Come on, if you wanna feel the thug...luv and it's real,
We got the real thing baby.
Hot heat could burn ya, learn ya, stay out it if it don't concern ya.
You don't really want to get involved wit da murder.
But shit if ya want it we got it, we bringing it!
We don't stop, we gon pop shots still to the double Glock Glock,
Never taking no shorts, no losses man.
Yes, these days is still the same like, gotta make that money man.
Bang gotta get down for my thang,and I do it so smooth..
When im stalkin that foolz, walking jack moves.
Now I gotta run witta me shotgun, bottom line it's on
Ya'll can't fuck wit the thuggish ruggish (ruggish) bone bone bone bone.
That's thug mentality.

T.H.U.G we be,
That's thug mentality we're thuggin'
Thuggin thuggin it's the way I choose to live my life
T.H.U.G we be,
That's thug mentality we're thuggin'
Thuggin thuggin thuggin till the day I die.
(repeat)

Where my Detroit thugs, thugs?
