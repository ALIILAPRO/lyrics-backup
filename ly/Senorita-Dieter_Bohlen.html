		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dancing by the fire
Dancing in the sand
Rythm takes her higher
When she take my hand
She's flirting with disaster
I love the way she dance
The rythm takes her faster
We start a love romance
Listen to the music, is hard for me to say
Is it really love, girl, do you make my day

Oh senorita, please don't play a silly game
Baby, where's my heart or it's just the same
Oh senorita, oh don't break my lonely heart
Baby, just tonight, oh don't break apart

And she dance and she dance all the lonely night
To the rhythm of the beat and I'll hold you tight
Every night, every day would you show me love
Say it loud, say it clear, I can't get enough

Never stop me, baby
Wanna touch your secret skin
Tell me there's no maybe
This love is not a sin
Like an orchestra of angels
Like a symphony of love
It's an old, old story
A heart can't get enough
And I feel my heart is burning
I can see it in your eyes
I feel my heart is turning
Is this paradise
Oh no, no
Oh senorita, please don't play a silly game
Baby, where's my heart or it's just the same
Oh senorita, oh don't break my lonely heart
Baby, just tonight, oh don't break apart

And she dance and she dance all the lonely night
To the rhythm of the beat and I'll hold you tight
Every night, every day would you show me love
Say it loud, say it clear, I can't get enough
