		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'll take what you got, got, got
I know it's not a lot, lot, lot
Cause I just need another hit
You're the thing that I can't quit
You got what I want, want, want
Here and then you're gone, gone, gone
If you told me that we were through
You know that I would break the truce

I want to breathe you in like your vapour
I want to be the one you remember
I want to feel your love like the weather
All over me, all over me
I want to print our hands in the pavement
Savour your words, I won't ever waste them
Look in your eyes and know just what you miss
So lie to me, just lie to me

So talk, talk, talk
Well tell me what I want, want, want
If I don't look into your eyes
It's almost like a perfect line
So don't stop, stop, stop
We'll take another shot, shot, shot
'Cause you know you got perfect aim
I wanna feel you in my veins

I wanna breathe you in like your vapour
I want to be the one you remember
I want to feel your love like the weather
All over me, all over me
I want to print our hands in the pavement
Savour your words, I won't ever waste them
Look in your eyes and know just what you miss
So lie to me, just lie to me

You sound so sweet
When you lie to me
Make you sound so sweet
When you lie to me

I wanna breathe you in like your vapour
I want to be the one you remember
I want to feel your love like the weather
All over me, all over me
I want to print our hands in the pavement
Savour your words, I won't ever waste them
Look in your eyes and know just what you miss
So lie to me, just lie to me

You sound so sweet
When you lie to me
Make you sound so sweet
When you lie to me
