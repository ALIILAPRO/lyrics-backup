		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, I know how you feel
We be going through the same shit
(Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up)
Yeah, yeah

Yeah, everybody shady baby, I know how you feeling
Who you think you fooling, homie? That ain't how you living
Let me eat that coochie, baby, you looking like a meal
Every time I step out, I be looking like a million
Everybody shady baby, I know how you feeling
Who you think you fooling, homie? That ain't how you living
Let me eat that coochie, baby, you looking like a meal
Every time I step out, I be looking like a million

Baby, I'm a zombie you know I be having no feelings
If a nigga try me, on mommy I'm gon' kill him
I came from the bottom, now I'm saucy, I got chicken
I poured so much liquor on my liver, I ain't kiddin', ayy
Jackboy that's my nigga, we so alike that nigga my synonym, ayy
I'm a need two hundred to rock the mic and that's the minimum, yeah
I know every time you hit my line it's for some money
I been in them projects all my life, this shit ain't funny

Yeah, everybody shady baby, I know how you feeling
Who you think you fooling, homie? That ain't how you living
Let me eat that coochie, baby, you looking like a meal
Every time I step out, I be looking like a million
Everybody shady, baby, I know how you feeling
Who you think you fooling, homie? That ain't how you living
Let me eat that coochie, baby, you looking like a meal
Every time I step out, I be looking like a million

Ayy, ayy, ayy, yeah
I'm dripping in Christian Dior
I'm walking out of Saks with a sac, boy
Shit them boosters get out of the store
I still got dirty money
Project baby, I ain't changin' my fuckin' chart
Like an athlete ran it up, and my car a foreign sport
Blood bath, full of paper dork
Cute, big ass gun, not short
Big firearm, I'm toting a torch
Lil' bitch get literal
I'll put you on the news, shoot your mom, it ain't no rules
Lit nigga with a short ass fuse
I'm quick to show a bih what the pistol do
Quick to show a bitch, how I rock and roll
I don't start shit, I just go with the flow
Play a sucker, catch a sucker, I ain't quit playin' dumb
You was ready to fight, 'til he saw I had a gun
Yeah, beef up with the wrong one
Stand your ground or I'ma gun you down, can't run
Me and Kodak same way, so I know he want somwthin'

Ayy, ayy
Yeah, everybody shady baby, I know how you feeling
Who you think you fooling, homie? That ain't how you living
Let me eat that coochie, baby, you looking like a meal
Every time I step out, I be looking like a million
Everybody shady, baby, I know how you feeling
Who you think you fooling, homie? That ain't how you living
Let me eat that coochie, baby, you looking like a meal
Every time I step out, I be looking like a million
