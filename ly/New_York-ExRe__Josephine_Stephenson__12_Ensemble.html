		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was drunk, New York, New York
I saw a small white rabbit climbing down the Empire State
I must have been hallucinating
I am seeing things I'm missing
They told me Stella from across the street is dead
Painting fake bricks on the front because house sales are slow
And Stella was kind to me even though
She didn't know the fantasies I made around her
Pictures he drew
Two broken legs, open-toed shoes
Shark fishing in the pavement
Shark fishing in the pavement

I'm hallucinating
I'm seeing things I'm missing

I went back to your street
I saw my friends in love, have children
I felt empty and alone there
Talking other people's good things
Pining for my own share
Still, I raged through, wine-wasted, shit-faced, solo, so what?
So long, I had no real plans
It wasn't work, no, it wasn't holiday
It was just time and space
Unpaid intoxication, images I didn't need
Man, I really want to see her

Hallucinating
I'm seeing things I'm missing

Well, forgive me, I can't keep it in
I'm speaking over and over in his codes
Did I ever show you that book he made me?
White rabbit, New York, it's a fake
Plagiarised his love letters from some time before
For someone before

Seems he is very conscious of the world
He recycles, he recycles his words
Seems he is very conscious of the world
He recycles, he recycles his words

I'm seeing things I'm missing
I miss him and I hate it
I'm seeing things I'm missing
I miss him and I hate it

I'm drunk
New York, New York
I'm drunk
New York, New York
(New York)
(New York)
