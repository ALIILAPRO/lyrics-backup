		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One, take control of me?
You're messing with the enemy
Said it's two, it's another trick
Messin' with my mind, I wake up

Chase down an empty street
Blindly snap the broken beats
Said it's gone, with the dirty trick
It's taken all these days to find you

Ah
I'll tell you I want you
Ah
I'll tell you I need you

Friends take control of me
Stalking 'cross the gallery
All these pills got to operate
The color quits and all invade us

There it goes again
Take me to the edge again
All I got is a dirty trick
I'm chasing down the wolves to save you

Ah
I'll tell you I want you
Ah
I'll tell you I need you
Ah
The blood ain't on my face
Ah
Just wanted you near me

Ah
I'll tell you I want you
Ah
I'll tell you I need you
Ah
The blood ain't on my hands
Ah
Just wanted you near me

I'll tell you I want you
I'll tell you I need you
The blood ain't on my hands
Just wanted you near me
