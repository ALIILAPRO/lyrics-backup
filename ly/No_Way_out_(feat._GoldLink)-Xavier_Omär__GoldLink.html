		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been losing sleep over last night
And I can't move on without peace of mind
This is not how to be
It's been wild
Is it worth it?
I can't believe I'm even questionin'
When I'm with you I am the best I've been
Don't want you apart from me
It gets harder
Don't wanna hurt this

(Baby you are) just what I've been searching for a long time
(If I fall then), finding someone like you is a long climb
There's no way out for me
There's no way out for me
I don't want a way out

It's you and I
It's you and I
There's no way out for me
There's no way out for me
I don't want a way out
I'm where I wanna be
It's you and I

You know I want it bad
All the ways we use to be, baby I want it back
(Oh)
All of the good times
Every little bit of joy that we could find
(Yeah)
How could I be away?
Walkin around acting like you ain't everything
I'm reacting only to the pain
My reaction always is to blame
Help me figure it out
Cuz I'm never leavin
You and I is where it begins
There will never be a "the end"
I'm about you
Baby show me how to
Love you even more
I'm never too far

(Baby you are) just what I've been searching for a long time
(If I fall then), finding someone like you is a long climb
There's no way out for me
There's no way out for me
I don't want a way out

It's you and I
It's you and I
There's no way out for me
There's no way out for me
I don't want a way out
I'm where I wanna be
It's you and I

Jiminy cricket eat papa
Pop top on the roof drive away and chunk up the deuce
Fuck it you make me feel like that I'm a better man
Like a benefit to life
I would die to live this twice
Feeling on you uh huh
Pulling on your mini skirt
Pulling on my uh huh
I don't really know who worse
Riding on your soul train
Lose my mind like Cobain
You don't need a couple inches
Bae ya need the whole thing
Hit my nigga spazzy up
Picture for the camera
Young and getting money if I lose it I make ya run it up
I had like 100 girls
Lost about 100 girls
From Rubi Rose to Ruby Dee's
From AAs to DDD's I stay at ease
I'm pimpin these
Mixed from broken tendencies
Baby I should fix my ways but that would take the songs away
You can be my suga suga I can bash ya baby up
From rough sex to mood loving have me feel some kind of way
