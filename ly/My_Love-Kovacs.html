		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Babe, don't try to call
My heart is ticking and the show, just won't wait
It's strange, you couldn't see it my way, hey, now go
I pray for you to fall
The spark has died and now you're just too late
A shame, you're knocking at the wrong gate, hey, go

Come what may
I won't give away

My love, diamond rings and Chevrolets
My love, aces high and cigarettes
My love, faking all like Hollywood
My love, love, love

No way you'll see me crawl
Like a shark, I'll be ripping you apart and celebrate
With lots of champagne
You caught me on the wrong day, now you know

Come what may
I won't give away

My love, see me dancing in the rain
My love, no more whiskey and cocaine
My love, ending all forbidden fruit
My love, love, love

Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
No you can't amuse me, so leave you must
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
If the spell won't kill you, your ego does

My love, diamond rings and Chevrolets
My love, no more tears and no regrets
My love, time to lay the man to rest
My love, love, love
