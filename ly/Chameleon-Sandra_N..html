		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Boy can you tell another lie,
Don’ t know why, I will trust, I will buy
Boy you are like a changing sky,
full of clouds screaming loud then you shine


Chameleon chameleon chameleon
Boy you change your colors, change your colors in a million
With my soul you play, with my heart you play
In a million ways


Boy, maybe you don t have a heart,
it’s a hole, it’s a stone, leaves you cold
Boy and you cut me like a knife
then you come like a light in the night
