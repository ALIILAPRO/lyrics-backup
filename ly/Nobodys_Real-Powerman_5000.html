		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Scary monsters 
And super peeps 
The more you dream the less you sleep 
Life as you know it 

Has gone away 
Unbound  unwound  who's here to stay 

[Chorus]
Nobody's real but they're willing to let you know 
Nobody's real but they'll feel it tonight 
Nobody's real but they're willing to let you go 
Nobody's real but they'll feel it 

How do you sleep 
With the time that's left you 
It's all been done 
There's no need for the rescue 

So let's just get out 
I swear there's no doubt 
You can't be ready cause there's nothing left to do 

[Chorus]
