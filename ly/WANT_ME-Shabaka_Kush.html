		  Yea
See it's really easy for you to just sit there and just blame me
Fuck with my head got me thinking maybe I'm crazy
You move so fast so quick baby to replace me
I'm so far gone my soul who the hell gon' save me
So what you really want from me
I'm already down on my knees
Baby I'm begging please
You lo¢ked my love and threw away the keys
All we been through
How hell you gonna leave
All we been through
How the hell you gonna leave
How the hell you gonna leave
Yea
Why the fuck do you wanna go
I don't even know no more
Dragging me and I can't let go
Never felt this pain before
I'll do anything for you to stay
Just to keep the pain away
Tried so hard to avoid this day
Guess it was meant for you to betray
Me!
Baby can't you really see
We was really meant to be
Look at all our history
Gave everything you need
You never ever had to please
Baby won't you stay with me
Baby please just stay with me
See it's really easy for you to just sit there and just blame me
Fuck with my head got me thinkin' maybe I'm crazy
You move so fast so quick baby to replace me
I'm so far gone my soul who the hell gon' save me
So what you really want from me
I'm already down on my knees
Baby I'm begging please
You lo¢ked my love threw away the keys
All we been through
How the hell you gonna leave
All we been through
How the hell you gonna leave
How the hell you gonna leave
Yea
Don't go
How can you be so cold
I feel so lost with no home
I've never been this low
Oooo
Babe!
Can't you see the price I paid
Gave you more than I had claimed
We can't let it end this way
What do you need for me to say
You don't have to run away
We can work it out day by day
I'm tired of playing all these games
See it's really easy for you to just sit there and just blame me
Fuck with my head got me thinkin' maybe I'm crazy
You move so fast so quick baby to replace me
I'm so far gone my soul who the hell gon' save me
So what you really want from me
I'm already down on my knees
Baby I'm begging please
You lo¢ked my love threw away the keys
All we been through
How the hell you gonna leave
All we been through
How the hell you gonna leave
How the hell you gonna leave
Yea
