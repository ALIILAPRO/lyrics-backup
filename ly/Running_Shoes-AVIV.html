		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Some nights - I find myself longing for an escape
 But I tend - to hide in the hallway, pretend I'm okay

 (with) All of these faces - Fake conversations
 Going in circles - no destination
 talking to strangers - my focus fading  
 Waiting for a sign that you're leavin

 I wore my running shoes
 (If you) Say when,
 (Then) I could run with you

 A hundred- Is so many bodies for one little house  
 (They're) Shoutin - over the music that's drowning them out.  

 all of these faces - fake conversations
 Running in circles - no destination
 talking to strangers - my focus faded   
Waiting for a sign that you're leavin
I wore my running shoes
 (If you) Say when,
 (Then) I could run with you
Maybe when the/this night ends
 I could stay with you
 Forget my other friends
 they don't see me like you do
I don't wanna fake a smile for them anymore
 Everyone's still drinking but I'm looking for the door - and you.

 I wore these running shoes
 Say when - and I'll get lost with 
You
