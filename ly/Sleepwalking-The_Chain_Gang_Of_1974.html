		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Destiny turned her face
Nightmares and violent shapes
State of dreaming 
Has left me numb

Blue eyes and wandering lips
True lies with fingertips
Hidden tales of forbidden
Love

You've left me miserable
Miserable
Miserable
Mis-er-a-ble

Love

You've left me miserable
Miserable
Miserable
Mis-er-a-ble

Maybe we're just sleepwalking
Maybe we're just sleepwalking

Visions of better times
Kingdoms and lilac wine
Why did God fail
To improve us

Teardrops of acid rain
Burning down through my veins
Can't I just sleep for now

Now
Despite my fears 
I dance for you
And did what others knew

I
Would care
Would wait
And live again
More desperate
Desperate
Yeah

Maybe we're just sleepwalking
Maybe we're just sleepwalking

Yeah

Maybe we're just sleepwalking
Maybe we're just sleepwalking
Maybe we're just sleepwalking
(Now despite my fears I dance for you)
Maybe we're just sleepwalking
Maybe we're just sleepwalking
(Oh would care would wait and live again)
Maybe we're just sleepwalking
Maybe we're just sleepwalking
Maybe we're just sleepwalking
