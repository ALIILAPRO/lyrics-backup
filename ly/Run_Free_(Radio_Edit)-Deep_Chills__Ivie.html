		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I still remember
Loving the danger
You set me on fire
When I'm by your side
You taking me higher
I follow you down if we go down
Now you say you wanna get away
You wanna take me all the way

Might get burned if you get too closer
To the sun (I want yah)
We can burn together
Fading into one another
Oh!
Well don't you know

You're still heaven to me
Baby, we could run free
If you do it just the way I like
Maybe I could waste my time on you
Never mind all our worries
If you do it just the way I like
Maybe I could waste my time on you

My deepest of secrets
Trust you to keep 'em
Hiding the worlds
You cannot say
I got what you wanted
I got what you needed
It's all in the way
That you say my name

Might get burned if you get too closer
To the sun (I want yah)
We can burn together
Fading into one another
Oh!
Well don't you know

You're still heaven to me
Baby, we could run free
If you do it just the way I like
Maybe I could waste my time on you
Never mind all our worries
If you do it just the way I like
Maybe I could waste my time on you
If you do it just the way I like
Maybe I could waste my time on you
Never mind all our worries
If you do it just the way I like
Maybe I could waste my time on you
