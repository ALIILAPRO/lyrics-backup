		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't wanna die yet
The lonely roads lead to victims in the soul
I don't wanna starve again
Already lost in my head
I'm coming down
I don't wanna die yet
The lonely roads lead to victims in the soul
I don't wanna starve again
Already lost in my head
I'm coming down


I don't wanna die yet
The lonely roads lead to victims in the soul
I don't wanna starve again
Already lost in my head
I'm coming down
I don't wanna die yet
The lonely roads lead to victims in the soul
I don't wanna starve again
Already lost in my head
I'm coming down


Stain my mind and I won't let you go
Close my eyes
I'll try to bring you home, yeah
Bring you home, yeah
Lost in a dream


Asking if you need me
Would you leave me?
We all speak when it's easy
Thinking 'bout it all night
Let it fall right
We all talk when it's alright
Lost in my head
Closed eyes, still falling for you
Lay in my bed
Arms out, still calling for you


I don't wanna die yet
The lonely roads lead to victims in the soul
I don't wanna starve again
Already lost in my head
I'm coming down
I don't wanna die yet
The lonely roads lead to victims in the soul
I don't wanna starve again
Already lost in my head
I'm coming down


Time goes by
I'll try
To keep advancing
Pay no mind, you'll find
You feel abandoned
Save my life in time to take advantage
But you were the best thing that I had
Lost in a dream


I don't wanna die yet
The lonely roads lead to victims in the soul
I don't wanna starve again
Already lost in my head
I'm coming down
I don't wanna die yet
The lonely roads lead to victims in the soul
I don't wanna starve again
Already lost in my head
I'm coming down
I don't wanna die yet
The lonely roads lead to victims in the soul
I don't wanna starve again
Already lost in my head
I'm coming down


I don't wanna die yet
The lonely roads lead to victims in the soul
I don't wanna starve again
Already lost in my head
I'm coming down
I don't wanna die yet
The lonely roads lead to victims in the soul
I don't wanna starve again
Already lost in my head
I'm coming down
