		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I woke up, boozed up
I messed up, yeah I fucked up
Can't stop, won't stop
I've got nothing left
So just make sure to stay away
It's too obscure down here with me
I'm stuck and lost
I'm not enough
Don't you dare tell me it'll be okay
'Cause all I know
Is I've got no control
I'm addicted to the things that bring me to an all time low
But I'm sick of this show
Why do I keep going back
When every night is the same
It won't change
I hate it here
Oh what a shame
All time low, but I'm sick of this show
And I think I know, you know, we know how it ends
I've lost so many fights
I've spent too many nights
Tryna reach up for new heights
But all I did was gaslight
I've hurt the ones I love many times in many ways
I have to get rid of my own self that I hate
This time I need a plan
Not another fucking chance
I need to take a stand
You don't need to understand
I'm sick and tired of feeling like shit
No one but me can make me quit
Maybe one day I will leave it all in the past
But as of now I can't see past that nothing good for me can last
'Cause all I know
Is I've got no control
I'm addicted to the things that bring me to an all time low
But I'm sick of this show
Why do I keep going back
When every night is the same
It won't change
I hate it here
Oh what a shame
All time low, but I'm sick of this show
And I think I know, you know, we know how it ends
All I know is I've got no control
Bring me to an all time low
But I'm sick of this show
When every night is the same, it won't change
I hate it here oh what a shame
All time low, but I'm sick of this show
And I think I know, you know, we know how it ends
