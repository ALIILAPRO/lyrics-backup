		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I think of you while you're at work
Out in the fields, tearing up the earth 
But i like you best when you're at home
Giving it to me, so nice and fucking slow

No one's ever gonna love me, no not you like do 
Every night i'm crying in my sleep, cause i'm dreaming about you 
And i've tried so hard to quit you, like i promised my mama i would
But it's no good, it's no good 

You walk a fine line between god and animal 
You're just a feral dog i worship in bedroom ceremonials
Cut me up and take me like the bread and blood at church
Love's never been more than pain, so baby show me how bad you hurt 

No one's ever gonna love me, no not you like do 
Every night i'm crying in my sleep, cause i'm still dreaming about you 
And i've tried so hard to quit you, like i promised my mama i would
but it's no good, it's no good 

You're no good, i'm no good, we're no good
