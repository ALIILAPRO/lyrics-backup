		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (I don't know if you love me anymore)
(I don't know if you love me like before)
(Just tell me when to let go)
(Baby, tell me when to let go)
(Desirez on the beat)
(I don't know if you love me anymore)
(I don't know)
Look, look, mm

My mama told me to make it work
But Usher told me to let it burn
I used to see you call my phone and get butterflies
These days my stomach turn
I don't know why I think about you all the time
I was hopin' this is love and you ain't just down for the ride
Tell me what could make a grown man lay down and cry?
Maybe what he thought was real love, he watched die
Problems drive me insane, shit been wreckin' my brain
I've been poppin' these Percocets to cope with the pain
Everyone think the root of my problem is a broken heart
But ever since a juvenile, I been lonely and lost (yeah)
And you know when you met me, I didn't do drugs at all (at all)
But got a dose of your love, hooked like Fentanyl (Fentanyl)
They say the later you wait to quit, the harder you fall (you fall)
You took me to your mountain tip and then you threw me off
And then you threw me off
Oh, and then you threw me off
Threw me off (Desirez on the beat)

Last night, I was so high, almost jumped out of the window
Last night, I was so high, almost jumped out of the window
And my love's all yours, it's all yours from a distance
I was thinkin', if you ever need me, come see me
Uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Last night, I was so high, almost jumped out of the window
Last night, I was so high, almost jumped out of the window
And my love's all yours, it's all yours from a distance
I was thinkin', if you ever need me, come see me
Uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh
