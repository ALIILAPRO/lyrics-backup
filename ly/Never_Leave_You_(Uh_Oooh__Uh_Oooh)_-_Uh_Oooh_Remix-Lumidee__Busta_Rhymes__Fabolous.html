		  (Woo)
(Yeah)
Ayo, Tedsmooth
It look like it's gonna be another one of them hot summers (yeah)
Busta-bust down

Uh, uh, uh, oh (here we go)
Uh, uh, uh, oh (Flipmode)
Uh, uh, uh, oh (Lumidee)
Uh, uh, uh, oh (ayo, y'all know why she going "uh oh," right?)

Check it
Yo, Prada hotter all on my Copacabana, mama
Gotta lotta shit with you and I love the persona mama
Always love to get with you, ever needin' me? Mama, holla
How you check me and give me the oochie-walla-walla
Swallow a couple shots of the 'yac and make a dolla
Lil' mama in the crib with the focus to be a scholar
Type of example other shorties might need to follow
Now the chick in a bug, it come with a little shop of horrors
Take you to the Caribbean down to Caribana
Sail the Mediterranean and enjoy the water (c'mon)
When the road is rocky, you keepin' me stocky
Takin' care niggas who don't like when you check on your papi
We alright, baby, hug me with all your might
And put it on a nigga, 'cause you know that it's on tonight
Break up to make up, you know that we gone
I'm finding if we ridin' together
Let's stay with it, sho' you're right

Never ever, ever wanna let you go
Tell me what you're feeling, 'cause I want to know
If you're around, you know I'm down
I'll be that girl keeps you on ground
I'm only here just because
It feels good, sayin' us
Keep you right, believe your love

I never thought you'd be the one
Make me shine brighter than the sun
There ain't no ups and downs
No in and outs, you're here right now

If you want me to stay, I'll never leave
If you want me to stay, we'll always be
If you want me to stay, love endlessly
If you want me to stay, if you want me to stay
I'll never leave you

Uh, uh, uh, oh
Uh, uh, uh, oh
Uh, uh, uh, oh (Fabolous, uh)
Uh, uh, uh, oh (Lumidee)

I ain't never gon' believe
You ever gonna leave
You feel so good on my arm
Somethin' like them baseball jackets
With the leather on the sleeve
Or a flooded timepiece that cost several hundred G's
Your lovin' ain't the type of love everyone receive
Baby girl go down like she never wanna breathe, woo
(Uh, oh) I got a play you right
'Cause this kid don't usually let 'em stay the night
And when I know you wrong, I say you're right (yeah)
And when I wanna say no, I say I might (yeah)
This is real talk, you know it ain't another (uh-uh)
And anytime I'm gone, you know I'm thinkin' of you (uh-huh)
And anytime you need, you know I got you covered (uh-huh)
You know none of the others do what I does (uh, uh)
I keep your rocks bluer than hers (uh-huh)
Keep your shoes newer than hers
And I do it because, uh

If you want me to stay, I'll never leave
If you want me to stay, we'll always be
If you want me to stay, love endlessly
If you want me to stay, if you want me to stay
I'll never leave you

Uh, uh, uh, oh
Uh, uh, uh, oh
Uh, uh, uh, oh
Uh, uh, uh, oh
Uh, uh, uh, oh
Uh, uh, uh, oh
Uh, uh, uh, oh
Uh, uh, uh, oh
