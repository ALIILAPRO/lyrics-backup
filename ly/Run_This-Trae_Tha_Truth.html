		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Feel it comin' in the air (uh)
And the screams from everywhere (okay)
I'm addicted to the thrill (real talk)
It's a dangerous love affair
Can't be scared when it goes down
Got a problem, tell me now (you know I gotta do this for the gangsters right here)
Only thing that's on my mind
Is who's gon' run this town tonight (H-Town)
Is who's gon' run this town tonight (Trae Tha muthafuckin' Truth, nigga)
We gon' run this town

Yeah, I used to hide cash, now I'm lit, cash out
Phantom taught haters to listen, nigga, class out
Got bitches feelin' like a dancer 'cause they ass nice
And plus I only kick it with them with they ass out
I've been the truth, other niggas tryna fib
Never that, you'd rather be kissin' a SIG
Being successful is enough to make you feel hate
That's probably why I'm tryna cop a mansion next to Bill Gates
I remember rappin' when crowds was a no show
But now I'm rockin' where them coliseum shows go
Too many roaches so I swear it goin' solo
Jubilee diamonds, hoppin' out with the Soul Glo
Fast money got me stuntin' with a slow pose
Screwed up so my trunk throwin' slow blows
Hard enough to leave a passenger with a swole nose
In the heat of passion, 'bout to suicide four doors

Life's a game but it's not fair
I break the rules so I don't care
So I keep doin' my own thing
Walkin' tall against the rain
Victory's within the mile
Almost there, don't give up now
Only thing that's on my mind
Is who's gon' run this town tonight
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Is who's gon' run this town tonight?

We are, yeah, I said it we are
You can call me Caesar, in a dark Czar
Please follow the leader, So Eric B. We are
Microphone fiend, it's the return of the God, peace God
(Ah, ah) And ain't nobody fresher, I'm in Mason, uh
Martin Margiela
On the tape we're screamin' fuck the other side, they jealous
We got a banquet for the broads, they got a table for of fellas
And they ain't spending no cake
They should throw they hand in
'Cause they ain't got no spades
My whole team got dough
So my banquette is looking like millionaires' row

Life's a game but it's not fair
I break the rules so I don't care
So I keep doin' my own thing
Walkin' tall against the rain
Victory's within the mile
Almost there, don't give up now
Only thing that's on my mind
Is who's gon' run this town tonight
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Is who's gon' run this town tonight?

It's crazy how you can go from being Joe Blow
To everybody on your dick, no homo
I bought my whole family whips, no Volvo's
Next time I'm in church, please no photos
Police escorts, everybody passports
This the life that everybody ask for
This a fast life, we are on a crash course
What you think I rap for, to push a fucking Rav-4?
But I know that if I stay stuntin'
All these girls only gon' want one thing
I could spend my whole life good will hunting
Only good gon' come is as good when I'm cummin
She got a ass that'll swallow up a g-string
And up top, uh, two bee stings
And I'm beastin', off the Riesling
And my nigga just made it out the precinct
We give a damn about the drama that you do bring
I'm just trying to change the color on your mood ring
Reebok, baby, you need to try some new things
Have you ever had shoes without shoe strings?
"What's that, 'Ye?" Baby, these heels
"Is that a May? What?"
Baby, these wheels
You trippin' when you ain't sippin', have a refill
You feelin' like you runnin', huh? Now you know how we feel

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
We gon' run this town tonight
