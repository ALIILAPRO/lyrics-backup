		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'll always say I love you still
All of that water ran down the hill
Every broken thing washes away, washes away
You saw my scars and called 'em skin
I saw your garden and gave it sin
Every savior needs someone to save, someone to save

Two kids climbed on a roller coaster car
Got rattled on the track
Up and down, around and back
Whoever they were, no matter who they are
No one's walking off the same

When I fell out of the palm of your hand
With the summer flowers
I followed the water and found these friends of mine
Where small town thugs and lightning bugs
Shine in their final hours
And their hearts all come out of the cold
In the nick of time

Some get lost in a storm
Others behind an old chest of drawers
Our field got swallowed in fog
Flowers and all

Everybody climbs on a roller coaster car
Gets rattled by the track
Up and down, around and back
Whoever I was, no matter who you are
And no one's walking off the same

When I fell out of the palm of your hand
With the summer flowers
I followed the water and found these friends of mine
Where small town thugs and lightning bugs
Shine in their final hours
And their hearts all come out of the cold
In the nick of time

And their hearts all come out of the cold
In the nick of time
