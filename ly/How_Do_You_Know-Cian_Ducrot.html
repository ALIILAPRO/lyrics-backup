		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How do you know, do you know
That the good days are now
While you're living them out?
Someone's off in the corner
Pitching a fire, all on their own
Someone's calling their friends
While you're missing them and they're so far from home

All the lads in the corner
Singing to daughters and dancing around
Half a Jack on the table
'Cause no one's been able to drink it down
Well, we don't know the words but we're singing
'Cause these are the times

So, how do you know, do you know
That the good days are now
While you're living them out?
And how do you know, do you know
That the ones that you're living
Are the ones you'll be missing?
Well, we don't know the words but we're singing
'Cause these are the times
So, how do you know, do you know
That the good days are now
While you're living them out right now?

One lost touch in the summer
Moved to the suburbs, probably settled down
I'm not sure about the others
One lost his brother and one moves around

I still think of that night
Did we have it all right?
Still, we all searched for more
So now, when I sit 'round a table
I wish we were able to sing it like before
Well, we don't know the words but we're singing
'Cause these are the times

So, how do you know, do you know
That the good days are now
While you're living them out?
And how do you know, do you know
That the ones that you're living
Are the ones you'll be missing?
Well, we don't know the words but we're singing
'Cause these are the times
Well, we don't know the words but we're singing
'Cause these are the times, right now

All that's left is a photo
I don't even know who took it back then
Who'd have thought in the moment
That I'd get to hold all that's left in the end?
