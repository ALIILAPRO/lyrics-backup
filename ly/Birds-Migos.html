		  (Ayy, Twan, turn that beat down)
Migo
Wassup, Pablo? 
What's poppin'? (woo)
You got the birds? 
D-low?
I need 'em, I want in

Had this dream that I woke up in a 'Rari (skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
Can't fuck with you niggas, I'm sorry (no way)
I'm too fly, I spread my wings and I'm soarin' 
Used to trap them birds, now I'm fly like a bird (woo)
(I got 'em, who need 'em?)
B-Birds
(Just come on right now)
B-B-Birds
(Come on, come on, just get 'em right now)
Birds

(Quavo, gone)
Just hit my phone if you want a bird
My niggas out right now on the curb (serve)
You can get a re-rock
You can get a whole serve (serve)
We locked in now, I can front you
Young nigga that's my word (word)
Walk in the bando, look at all them birds (birds)
Bando get low, re-up on the birds (birds)
Got shooters on pronto
Don't got no undo (grrah)
At the age of seventeen, I hit my first kick door (kick door)
Just me and Willie Mac, Offset
Shoutout Domingo (Domingo)
Then twelve tried to get me for gang activity (Migo)
The judge dropped the charge and I thank Lord (thank you)
That's why I take this mic and I go hard (go, gone)

Had this dream that I woke up in a 'Rari (skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
Can't fuck with you niggas, I'm sorry (no way)
I'm too fly, I spread my wings and I'm soarin' 
Used to trap them birds, now I'm fly like a bird (woo)
(I got 'em, who need 'em?)
B-Birds
(Just come on right now)
B-B-Birds
(Come on, come on, just get 'em right now)
Birds

(Offset, gone)
Just got the word (hello?), just got the birds
Shabba Ranks gold, only kick it with Ferg
You thought 'bout finessin' me? Run off with a bird
You gotta be kiddin' me
Charles Barkley, I got that broccoli
Fuckin' these bitches committin' adultery
Trap full of babies like an elementary
Bando with burglar bars (bando) 
Plugged in with Italian mobs (plugged)
Don't never put trust in a broad (no)
I'm puttin' my trust up in God
I got birds, I got chickens, I got seagulls
So many birds (birds), my gun is an Eagle (grraow)
When I talk birds (huh), I'm talkin' a kilo (kilo)

Had this dream that I woke up in a 'Rari (skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
Can't fuck with you niggas, I'm sorry (no way)
I'm too fly, I spread my wings and I'm soarin' 
Used to trap them birds, now I'm fly like a bird (woo)
(I got 'em, who need 'em?)
B-Birds
(Just come on right now)
B-B-Birds
(Come on, come on, just get 'em right now)
Birds

(Takeoff, gone)
The plug just hit my phone for some Funyuns, want an onion (gas)
Exotic crocodile skin Martens, call me Dundee
Al Pacino on a brick, kilo you gotta cross the country
Whipped Carlito for a hundred, gave a fifty to my mama
I'm an OG in my hood, no Aretha, well respected
Toucan Sam, pigeons call me Ace Ventura, Pet Detective
I see falcons on a daily basis, Takeoff Arthur Blank
Whippin' chickens in the kitchen, trap smell like a septic tank
Black and gold everything, talkin' 'bout jewelry, not the Saints
I don't need no translator, I comprehend in a way
My plug Carlito, he can't speak no Englo
All he knows is, "Andale" (huh)
I got bandos for the L-O
State-to-state, no real estate (damn)

Had this dream that I woke up in a 'Rari (skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
Can't fuck with you niggas, I'm sorry (no way)
I'm too fly, I spread my wings and I'm soarin' 
Used to trap them birds, now I'm fly like a bird (woo)
(I got 'em, who need 'em)
B-Birds
(Just come on right now)
B-B-Birds
(Come on, come on, just get 'em right now)
Birds
(Gone)
