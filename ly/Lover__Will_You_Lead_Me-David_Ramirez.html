		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You took off the blindfold
And led me into the sun
I studied your face
And saw no reason to run
I recognized you from some distant dream
Like when it rains on a cold day
I had a chill in my bones
Is it true what they say,
When you know, you know
I'd been dying in the darkness
Just longing to be seen

Will you lead me into the light
I've tried on my own, dear
To crawl through the night
I'm running on empty
So, Lover, will you lead me

Our glasses were half full
No matter how much we drank
I told you I was worried
You told me you were afraid
I didn't smoke that night
Because I never wanna die
