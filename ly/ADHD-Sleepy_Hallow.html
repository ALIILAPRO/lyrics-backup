		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh, gang, gang, gang
Look, uh
Hold up, look

I'm tryna slide with a vibe
Like, girl, put that pain to the side
Like, open up, I put my finger inside
From the trenches, I gotta survive
Like, how would you feel if they told you I died?
Told bro, "You slide, I slide"
Like, leave me alone, you ain't tryna see God
Really with it, this not a facade
Like, I'm tryna slide whenever (Uh)
That nigga die, whatever
Big bro told me to keep it together
No more clutchin' the stick in the sweater
You gotta move smarter, you gotta do better
But, I'm still tryna stay with Beretta
When I was in jail, they ain't send me no letters
I'm like, "Fuck it," I see 'em whenever

I got back, I was sturdy as ever
Make it rain, better grab ya umbrella
You so deep, this shit look like Coachella
I gotta T up, I ain't livin' forever
For my money, I'm slappin' the teller
'Member back, I was clappin' a sweater
She like, "Sleepy, you gettin' me wetter"
I told her, "I got it," so, I had to get her
Hold it down, why the fuck would you get up
Can't be trustin' that shit, it's a setup
Type of shit that can get niggas wet up
And, I'm start bitchin' if you get me fed up
Uh, yeah, uh, wait
How the fuck you gon' step on a stepper?
I be doin' this shit with no effort
Don't wanna know you, I ain't tryna network

Uh, I'm tryna slide with a vibe
Like, girl, put that pain to the side
Like, open up, I put my finger inside
From the trenches, I gotta survive
Like, how would you feel if they told you I died?
Told bro, "You slide, I slide"
Like, leave me alone, you ain't tryna see God
Really with it, this not a facade
Like, I'm tryna slide whenever (Uh)
That nigga die, whatever
Big bro told me to keep it together
No more clutchin' the stick in the sweater
You gotta move smarter, you gotta do better
But, I'm still tryna stay with Beretta
When I was in jail, they ain't send me no letters
I'm like, "Fuck it," I see 'em whenever
