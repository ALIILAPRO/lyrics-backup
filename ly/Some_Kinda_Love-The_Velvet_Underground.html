		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Some kinda love
Margarita told Tom
Between thought and expression
Lies a lifetime
Situations arise
Because of the weather
And no kinds of love
Are better than others

Some kinda love
Margarita told Tom
Like a dirty French novel
Combines the absurd with the vulgar
And some kinds of love
The possibilities are endless
And for me to miss one
Would seem to be groundless

Mmm-hmm, oh yeah

"I heard what you said"
And Margarita heard Tom
And of course you're a bore
But in that you're not charmless
'Cause a bore is a straight line
That finds a wealth in division
And some kinds of love
Ooh, are mistaken for vision, la-dee-da-da-dah

Ooh
Put jelly on your shoulder
Let us do what you fear most
Hmm, that, from which you recoil
But which still makes your eyes moist
Put jelly on your shoulder, baby
Lie down upon the carpet
Between thought and expression
Let us now kiss the culprit, move it on, ooh

I don't know, just what it's all about
Tell you something, honey
But put on your red pajamas and find out
Mmm, mmm, mmm
Ooh, Lord rock it on
I don't wanna have to reach the size
Hmm, oooh
