		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Does it get easier with time for the immortal?
If I was born normal
If I become normal, can I stay close?
With the children, we link our arms
Make a circle and sing a song
Knowing there was no chair for me all along

You locked me into the dark
I'm your preserved flower
The world is too slow to understand
Not all blossoms spark
And spikes may be sharp
They want to see just the beautiful parts
Sitting in a shower of scarlet rain
It all used to be ours
I'm counting the hours
Hours that stood between us like a river
Once I crawled through the water
All I ever knew have become distant past
