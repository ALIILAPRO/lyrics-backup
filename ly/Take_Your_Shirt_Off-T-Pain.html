		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  T's the shit, T's, yeah

Brush 'em off, brush 'em off, hey
Brush 'em off, brush 'em off, hey
Brush 'em off, brush 'em off, hey
Twist it in the air like a motherfucking helicopter, yeah

Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls
Children of all ages, hey
This is Nappy Boy, man, this is what we do, hey
Introducing

Teddy Pain, Teddy Pederast
Better be known when I roll around town
If your girl lost, then she about to be found
When I rock 'n' roll I, make the boy fall out

Teddy Bear's on my feet all 'round
I'm back again, what you gonna do now?
Get out of this party girl and come back to my house
I'm about to show you how we do it downtown

Take your shirt off, take your shirt off, hey
Take your shirt off, hey, take your shirt off, hey
Twist it in the air like a motherfucking helicopter, hey

Take your shirt off, hey, take your shirt off, hey
Brush 'em off, brush 'em off, fuck, do the dance, hey
Twist it in the air like a motherfucking helicopter, hey

I know you don't care when your titties everywhere, home girl
Take your motherfucking shirt off, hey
Take your motherfucking shirt off, hey
Take your motherfucking shirt off, hey

And if you don't care put your hands in the air, home girl
Take your motherfucking shirt off, hey
Take your motherfucking shirt off, hey
Hey, twist it in the air like a helicopter

What it is, what is gonna be?
I see you in the crowd and you're looking at me
But you ain't doing nothing like you getting it for free
I don't wanna see no nuts in the pretty white T

Take it all for me, baby girl, what you gonna do?
Your looking like, "Who this motherfucker talking to?"
I wanna see that Baby Phat wrapped around your head
Now answer this: is auto tune really dead?

Take your shirt off, take your shirt off, hey
Take your shirt off, hey, take your shirt off, hey
Twist it in the air like a motherfucking helicopter, hey

Take your shirt off, hey, take your shirt off, hey
Brush 'em off, brush 'em off, fuck, do the dance, hey
Twist it in the air like a motherfucking helicopter, hey

I know you don't care when your titties everywhere, home girl
Take your motherfucking shirt off, hey
Take your motherfucking shirt off, hey
Take your motherfucking shirt off, hey

And if you don't care put your hands in the air, home girl
Take your motherfucking shirt off, hey
Take your motherfucking shirt off, hey
Hey, twist it in the air like a helicopter

Hey girl, what it is? Should I take back to my crib
And take your motherfucking shirt off, shirt off?
Take your motherfucking shirt off, shirt off

Baby girl, what's going on?
I noticed this is your favorite song
So take your motherfucking shirt off, shirt off
Take your motherfucking shirt, shirt, shirt, shirt, shirt

Take your shirt off, take your shirt off, hey
Take your shirt off, hey, take your shirt off, hey
Twist it in the air like a motherfucking helicopter, hey

Take your shirt off, hey, take your shirt off, hey
Brush 'em off, brush 'em off, fuck, do the dance, hey
Twist it in the air like a motherfucking helicopter, hey

I know you don't care when your titties everywhere, home girl
Take your motherfucking shirt off, hey
Take your motherfucking shirt off, hey
Take your motherfucking shirt off, hey

And if you don't care put your hands in the air, home girl
Take your motherfucking shirt off, hey
Take your motherfucking shirt off, hey
Hey, twist it in the air like a helicopter
