		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Your cheap drink tricks and cigarettes keep you locked inside a cage
Your mother fears you, your father can't hear you, you're money, a voice on a stage
I still ache from the night that you dragged me, kicking and screaming, out the door
But I won't let go, no, I left my baby teeth in your drawer

If I can't hold you like a lover I won't hold you at all
The tide is turning on you, baby, and I feel nothing anymore
If we could stay this way forever would it ever be enough?
I wear your bruises on my shoulder now forever and evermore

Your lip got split, spill grenadine kisses, the codeine kids got you down
Picking fights with the devil, you know, you've got a real smart mouth
Driving you home from the bar and you're touching my face but I don't make a sound
Lost your baby teeth in the back seat, said somebody knocked them out

If I can't hold you like a lover I won't hold you at all
If I don't pull myself together this could be the end of it all
I hear your voice inside the TV telling me to follow you home
I taste your teardrops on my tongue at night and it still turns me on

There are things that we will never say, but we know, we know
Even baby teeth will hurt you when I'm biting down

If I can't hold you like a lover I won't hold you at all
The tide is turning on you, baby, and I feel nothing anymore
We could have stayed this way forever but it would never be enough
I wear your ache inside my heart, my dear, forever and evermore
