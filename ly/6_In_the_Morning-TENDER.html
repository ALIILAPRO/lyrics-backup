		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Nobody else can do this job because they got too much feeling

Don't wait up
I'm not coming home this evening
'Cause I don't wanna
I don't wanna, oh
Keep my secrets
I'm a wolf in sheepskin
Where the hell have I been? Mm-mm
Act like someone else around me
You said I haven't been myself 
For weeks and weeks
I don't know what I put you through
But you're not you
You're not who I knew

Give me a warning
And we be talking
I'll be up 'til six in the morning
Might as well have my fun
Before you move to another one
You don't need me
'Cause you'll be leaving
Tried to cut deep, I'm barely bleeding
Bet you thought I'd lick my wounds
Girl, I barely remember you

Don't wait up
I'm not coming home this evening
'Cause I don't wanna
I don't wanna, no
Keep my secrets
I'm a wolf in sheepskin
Where the hell have I been? Mm-mm
Act like someone else around me
You said I haven't been myself 
For weeks and weeks
I don't know what I put you through
But you're not you
You're not who I knew

Give me a warning
And we be talking
I'll be up 'til six in the morning
Might as well have my fun
Before you move to another one
You don't need me
'Cause you'll be leaving
Tried to cut deep, I'm barely bleeding
Bet you thought I'd lick my wounds
Girl, I barely remember you

Give me a warning
And we be talking
I'll be up 'til six in the morning
Might as well have my fun
Before you move to another one
You don't need me
'Cause you'll be leaving
Tried to cut deep, I'm barely bleeding
Bet you thought I'd lick my wounds
Girl, I barely remember you
