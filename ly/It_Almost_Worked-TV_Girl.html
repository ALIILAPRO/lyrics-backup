		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everyone looks the same in this town
You can hardly tell the difference
She stayed at home and figured out how
To will herself out of existence

She gave it a try she closed her eyes
She didn't know how it'd feel
She just hoped that it wouldn't hurt
It almost worked

They lie right to your face in this town
But what did you expect
She wishes that she could have
Seen what they saw
That left them so unimpressed

So she gave it a try she started to cry
She said to herself, "Well
At least it could have been worse"
And it almost worked
