		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm not afraid to take over (Made of stone)
And I'm not waiting any longer (Time is coming)
I'm moving on like a soldier (Made of stone)
I'm made of stone
I can take it all

Man a champion warrior
Solid as a rock and still getting stronger
Man a soldier
Don't give up
Time is now
I'm not waiting longer

Oh yeah vivo everybody now
Oh yeah back up
Malo are you ready?
Everybody now

There's a beat in my soul
There's a love in my heart
A warrior's mind
And I'm not gonna stop at all

Rock hard
Like a boulder inside
So come ride with me
Cause I can take it all

I'm not afraid to take over (Made of stone)
And I'm not waiting any longer (Time is coming)
I'm moving on like a soldier (Made of stone)
I'm made of stone

I can take it all
I can take it all

Man a champion, warrior
Solid as a rock and still getting stronger
Man a soldier
Don't give up
Time is now
I'm not waiting longer

There's a beat in my soul
There's a love in my heart
A warrior's mind
And I'm not gonna stop at all

Rock hard
Like a boulder inside
So come ride with me
'Cause I can take it all

I'm not afraid to take over (Made of stone)
And I'm not waiting any longer (Time is coming)
I'm moving on like a soldier (Made of stone)
I'm made of stone

I can take it all
I can take it all
I can take it all

I can take it all
