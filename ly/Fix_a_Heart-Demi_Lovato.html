		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's probably what's best for you,
I only want the best for you
And if I'm not the best then you're stuck

I tried to sever ties and I
Ended up with wounds to bind
Like you're pouring salt in my cuts

And I just ran out of band-aids
I don't even know where to start
'Cause you can bandage the damage
You never really can fix a heart

Even though I know it's wrong
How could I be so sure
If you never say what you feel feel
I must have held your hand so tight
You didn't have the will to fight
I guess you needed more time to heal

Baby I just ran out of band-aids
I don't even know where to start
'Cause you can bandage the damage
You never really can fix a heart

Oh oh woh oh woh oh ah
Oh oh oh oh oh oh yea
Oh oh woh oh woh oh ah
Oh oh yah ya ya
Yah

You must be a miracle worker
Swearing up and down that you can fix what's broken yeah
Please don't get my hopes up no no
Baby tell me how could you be so cruel

It's like you pouring salt on my cuts

Baby I just ran out of band-aids
I don't even know where to start
'Cause you can bandage the damage
You never really can fix a heart

Baby I just ran out of band-aids
I don't even know where to start
'Cause you can bandage the damage
You never really can fix a heart
Oh no no no
You never really can fix a heart
Oh no no no
You never really can fix a heart

Oh oh oh
Oh ya oh ah
Oh oh oh oh
You never really can fix my heart
