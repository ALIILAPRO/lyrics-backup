		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I can't go to Heaven, bury me in a neon grave
Carve my name in a honky tonk headstone right there where I lay
Let that Lynchburg river haul my soul away
If I can't go to Heaven, bury me in a neon grave

Where the band don't stop and the girls all dance
Where the longnecks don't get hot in our hands
The bar keeps doublin' down on doubles
It ain't hard to find a little trouble
Where the clock keeps glowin', but it don't keep time
The good Lord's willin' and the sun don't rise
If I can't go to Heaven, I say
Bury me, bury me, bury me in a neon grave

Hand me over to angels with whiskey on their wings
If I can't cross the Jordan to go and see my King
And prop me up by the jukebox where I can hear ol' Diffie sing
And hand me over to angels with whiskey on their wings

Where the band don't stop and the girls all dance
Where the longnecks don't get hot in our hands
The bar keeps doublin' down on doubles
It ain't hard to find a little trouble
Where the clock keeps glowin', but it don't keep time
The good Lord's willin' and the sun don't rise
If I can't go to Heaven, I say
Bury me, bury me, bury me in a neon grave

Oh, in a neon grave

Where the lights down low, where the smoke is thick
Where the "open" sign is always lit
If I can't go to Heaven, bury me

Where the band don't stop and the girls all dance
Where the longnecks don't get hot in our hands
The bar keeps doublin' down on doubles
It ain't hard to find a little trouble
Where the clock keeps glowin', but it don't keep time
The good Lord's willin' and the sun don't rise
If I can't go to Heaven, I say
Bury me, bury me, bury me in a neon grave

Oh, in a neon grave
Bury me, bury me, bury me in a neon grave
Oh, in a neon grave
