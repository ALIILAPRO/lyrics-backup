		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The fault line's about to blow
And the devil is at my throat
Paved with good intentions, don't you know
I'm staring down a dead-end road

Please call the doctor
I just saw a piece of me die
I can't stop the bleed
As dreams turn to nightmares
Right before my eyes awake or asleep

The gravity pulls me below
And darkness is all that I know

I'm breaking down and I need
Some room to breathe oh oh, oh oh
'Cause the weight of this has got
Me down on my knees

How the hell did I wind up here
Somewhere between all I know and fear
Caught my reflection in the rear-view mirror
My demons are closer than they appear

And I can't remember the last
Time that I got out trapped in a machine
The only way out is if I
Go straight through it now
I'm disintegrating

I'm breaking down and I need
Some room to breathe oh oh, oh oh
'Cause the weight of this has got
Me down on my knees oh
I think I'm paralyzed, paralyzed oh
I think I'm paralyzed, paralyzed
I wanna scream, I need some room to breathe

You can't save me you can't save me

Why am I my own worst enemy
Haunted by my own worst memories
Why am I my own worst enemy
Just push it down push it down
Push it down

Hell froze over, now I'm stuck underneath
My demons keep tearing me at the seams
Trapped in a tunnel, can't stay composed
Set me free, let me breathe
I don't feel a thing

I just need some room to breathe
'Cause the weight of this has got
Me down on my knees

I think I'm paralyzed, paralyzed oh
I think I'm paralyzed, paralyzed
I wanna scream, I need some room to breathe
You can't save me
(Why am I my own worst enemy
Haunted by my own worst memories)
You can't save me, oh
(Why am I my own worst enemy
Just push it down, push it down)
You can't save me
