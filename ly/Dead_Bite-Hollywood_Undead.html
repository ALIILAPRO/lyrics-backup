		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Good night!
Sleep tight!
Don't let the dead bite!

Johnny 3 and he's dipping in the four-door
.44 and it's pointed at your window
Ain't a good shot, here come four more
Getting hot so I play in the snow
In a town made wicked, made from these wicked things
See the dead on the cover of a magazine
See my smile, it was born from amphetamines
Better duck 'cause it's war on my enemies
Oh God, I think I lost it, oh no
Lost some, wanna watch the rest go
A mad man when I'm mixed with SoCo
And who would've thought a man could sink to so low?
Who wants to die from the Mossberg shotty?
Putting holes in the hotel lobby
All you fake bitches are just another hobby
And I'll let you dig where I dump your body

What would you do if I told you I hate you?
What would you do if your life's on the line?
What would you say if I told you I hate you?
I got something that'll blow your mind, mind!

You know I got a grenade and it's got your name on it
I'mma spit on your grave and engrave a dick on it
People say I'm insane and to put the brakes on it
Let me buy you a drink, how 'bout a Roofie, Gin, and Tonic?
Yeah, Charlie Scene seems to be so hated
It's just me being intoxicated
'Cause being sober's so overrated
Hollywood Undead what have you created?
I know that we have never really met before
But tell me does this rag smell like chloroform?
You know that I'm the reason people lock their doors
But I got nothing but time so I'mma wait on the porch
You got nowhere to run to so don't try hiding
'Cause I'm known to be like Jack Nicholson from The Shining
Yeah, I'm breaking your door down so don't try fighting
Yeah, you gotta keep 'em fed or the dead keep biting

What would you do if I told you I hate you?
What would you do if your life's on the line?
What would you say if I told you I hate you?
I got something that'll blow your mind, mind!

Good night!
Sleep tight!
Don't let the dead bite!
Wrap a rope around your head!
And watch you as you take flight!

You better check twice, look under your bed
Turn on your night light and cover up your head
'Cause we do exist and there's no need to pretend
That you're not afraid of meeting the Undead
Red, red rum when you look into these eyes
Say goodnight 'cause it's almost your bed time
Buckle up 'cause it's time to fly
You got a first-class ticket to Colombia neck ties
Take a seat, you can sit in the front row
The voice in your head is just me in your headphones
Everybody knows that we're the devil's heroes
Come and get a ticket, follow me to the creep show

What would you do if I told you I hate you?
What would you do if your life's on the line?
What would you say if I told you I hate you?
I got something that'll blow your mind, mind!

Good night!
Sleep tight!
Don't let the dead bite!
Wrap a rope around your head!
And watch you as you take flight!
Good night!
Sleep tight!
Don't let the dead bite!
Wrap a rope around your head!
And watch you as you take flight!
