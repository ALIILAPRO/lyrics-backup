		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I really want to go out
I really want to go outside and stop to see your day
You really want to hole up
You really want to stay inside and sleep the light away

I really want to go out
I really want to go outside and make it light all day
You really want to hole up
You really want to stay inside and not care where you lay

Well I know what's good
Exactly 'cause I have been there before
Yeah I know what's good 
Exactly those things night cannot behold

I really want to go out
I really want to go outside and stop to see your day
You really want to hole up
You really want to stay inside and sleep the light away

I think it's good to go out
'Cause if you don't you'll never make a memory that will stay
I think that you should wake up
I think I want to live my life and you're just in my way
