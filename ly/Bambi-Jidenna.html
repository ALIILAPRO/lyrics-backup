		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, oh, oh
Mmm mmm mmm

Bambi, Bambi
(Ba bam bam bi)
My dear, my dear, my dear
(Ba bam bam bi)
My dear, I want you here
(Bambi)
Don't get too near for there's lions, beware
(Mmm bam bam bi)

Oh Bambi I won't lie
If I weren't in this spiderweb of mine
If grandfather never had seven wives
Then darling you would be love of my life
Oh Bambi it's my design
To run the jungle I must be a lion
Or be a cheetah but neither is fine
Don't wanna hurt my dear love of my life

Bambi, Bambi
(Ba bam bam bi)
My dear, my dear, my dear
(Ba bam bam bi)
My dear, I want you here
(Bambi)
Don't get too near for there's lions, beware
(Mmm bam bam bi)

Sometimes I hide
When you FaceTime I text you back a lie
'Cause I'm afraid to look back in your eyes
I'm terrified you were love of my life
The women among the tribe
They will be jealous of this lullaby
I'll drink alone in my hotel and cry
'Cause now they know you are love of my life

Bambi, Bambi
(Ba bam bam bi)
My dear, my dear, my dear
(Ba bam bam bi)
My dear, I want you here
(Bambi)
Don't get too near for there's lions, beware
(Mmm bam bam bi)

I wish that we were forever young
I always knew that this day would come
The fork in the road where I cannot run
Between love and many I'm loving one
I got the wedding invitation, Bambi
I'm happy that he wants to make a family
But I cannot promise I won't run up in the church
There screaming your name, Bambi
No one can take you from me, Bambi
No one can take you from me, Bambi
No one can take you from me, Bambi

Bambi, Bambi
(Ba bam bam bi)
My dear, I want you here
(Ba bam bam bi)
Oh baby, don't get too near
(Ba bam bam bi)
Oh oh oh, there are lions, beware
(Mmm bam bam bi)
Mmm mmm mmm

I don't wanna see the wedding
I just wanna see my baby
I just wanna see my baby
