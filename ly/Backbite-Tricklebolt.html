		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They walk the dog
By deep dark night
With a bag full of gossip
They meet under street light
Have you heard this?
And have you heard that?
Pleased by their own envy
They go back to bed

Backbite 
In
The gleam of the street light
Backbite
Oeh
Even your own dog is better than you

Eyes and ears Everywhere in the streets
They know what i say and they know what i eat
I cant go anywhere I cannot breath
Discusted by their envy.
I cant go to bed.

Backbite 
In
The gleam of the street light
Backbite
Oeh
Even your own dog is better than you

Backbite 
In 
The gleam of the street light
Backbite
Oeh
Even your own dog is better than you
