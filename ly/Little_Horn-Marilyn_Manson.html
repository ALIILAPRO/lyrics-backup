		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's an apple in the pussy mouth
Now I am the dinner whore
There's a tumor in the TV mouth
Burn it out before it grows
Someone better get the dog to kick
Jaws wired shut to save the dick
Out of the bottomless pit
Comes the little horn

Little horn is born
Little horn is born
Little horn is born
Little horn is born

World spread its legs for another star
World shows its face for another scar

Dead will dance for what is left
Worms will wait with bated breath
"The blind have now become my deaf"
So says the little horn

Save yourself from this
Save yourself from this
Save yourself from this
Save yourself

World spread its legs for another star
World shows its face for another scar

Everyone will suffer now
Everyone will suffer now
Everyone will suffer now
Everyone will suffer now
You can't save yourself
You can't save yourself
You can't save yourself
You can't save yourself

World spread its legs for another star
World shows its face for another scar
