		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  God I thought I loved you so
God I thought I loved you so

Did it leanin', skinny jean wearing,
'Fro for days in the O.A.A.
Balls so low most fools couldn't price me
Sign and stunt with a blunt full of P-E
And I guess you know me,
Been in N-Y so long got Tri-State family
Especially Brooklyn shout out to Damati's
My bloodline runs deep, unless I don't sleep
Figure it's my pops keeping me away
Help me keep my mind off the clouds for reality
These muthafuckers can't fathom the wizardry
Slow-mo brain that's backwards cowards
Took a shower your attitude stinks
Wanna know what I think?

Oh oh, oh,
Hey my mojo so dope bitch
Hey my mojo so dope
Yep we live it, live it
Yeah we on it, on it
Give a fuck about your lifestyle,
Give a fuck about a muthafucking lifestyle 'cause nigga
We, we live this shit
Oh oh, oh,
Give a fuck about your lifestyle,
Give a fuck about a muthafucking lifestyle 'cause nigga

I live through words not metaphors
So I passed to be the rest of the freshmen
Playful tough talk
Often the fave 'til I came to park heart
And said true things
A whole new legion of some niggas
Aiming high pass the idea slangin'
Praise Allah for keeping me awake man
I lot of my niggas fell victim to the dope game
Some things will never be same
Wish I could tell my brother something for some motivation
And get him out that gutter
He's leaving behind a family and a mother
Damn you must understand when I speak about a song it's how I really am
Yeah this is how I really think
You could see what I see, yes I really wink
Yes I really drink
I really do rage my demons at the cage
By most of the day before I became the age to even wage
I was drowning them sorrows with some more E nigga
Hey we live this shit

Oh oh, oh,
Hey my mojo so dope bitch
My mojo so dope
Yep we live it, live it
Yeah we on it, on it
Give a fuck about your lifestyle,
Give a fuck about a muthafucking lifestyle 'cause nigga
We, we live this shit
Oh oh, oh,
Give a fuck about your lifestyle,
Give a fuck about a muthafucking lifestyle 'cause nigga

Oh oh, oh,
Give a fuck about your lifestyle,
Give a fuck about your lifestyle,
'Cause nigga
We, we live this shit
Oh oh, oh,
Give a fuck about your lifestyle,
'Cause nigga
Oh oh, oh,
On and on and on and on
