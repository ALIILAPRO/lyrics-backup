		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is my five string serenade
Beneath the water of play
And while I'm playing for yo
It could writing that's you

This is my five string serenade
Beneath the water of play
And while I'm playing for you
It could writing that's you

And on my easel I drew
While I was thinking of you
And on the roof of my head
And came my five string serenade

This is my five string serenade
Beneath the water of play
And while I'm playing for you
It might writing that's you

And on my easel I drew
While I was thinking of you
And on the roof of my head
And came my five string serenade

This is my five string serenade
Beneath the water of play
And though I'm playing for you
It could writing that's you

This is my five string serenade
