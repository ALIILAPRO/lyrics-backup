		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Why's everybody always picking on me?
(Why's everybody always picking on me?)
Does anybody really know a thing about me?
(Does anybody really know a thing about me?)
One of these days we'll be in the same place
In the same place punk, at the very same time (yeah)
And when it takes place and you wanna talk shit
Then step your ass up, and say it right to my face

You'll get knocked the fuck out
'Cause your mouth's writing checks that your ass can't cash
Knocked straight the fuck out
'Cause your mouth's writing checks that your ass can't cash

I ain't believing all the shit you been talking 'bout me
(I ain't believing all the shit you been talking 'bout me)
Don't even know me, and still you're talking shit about me
(Don't even know me, and still you're talking shit about me)
Well, one of these days I'm gonna catch you in the act
In the act, red handed, caught up in the act (punk)
And that'll be the day, your one and only day
Then step your ass up, and say it right to my face

You'll get knocked the fuck out
'Cause your mouth's writing checks that your ass can't cash
Knocked straight the fuck out
'Cause your mouth's writing checks that your ass can't cash

Shh

So where you at?Where you been?
I'm sure I'll be seeing you again 
'Cause this world is really small 
Can't we all get along, can't we all get along? 
So where you at? Where you been? 
I'm sure I'll be seeing you again 
'Cause this world is really small 
Can we all get along, can we all get along?

I'm upset at the people who verbally rape us, we're talking 
We try to ignore them, ignore them until they keep talking 
They think that they're building an empire without us 
Well we've got the torch now 
We've got the fire to burn this motherfucker down, town, town 
Burn this motherfucker down, town, town 
Burn this motherfucker now, down, down 
Burn this motherfucker now, down
Burn this motherfucker

You'll get knocked the fuck out
'Cause your mouth's writing checks that your ass can't cash
Knocked straight the fuck out
'Cause your mouth's writing checks that your ass can't cash
That your ass can't cash

Motherfucker
Just shut your fuckin' mouth
Bring it on Lethal
Come on
