		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I get around but I want you to show me how
How to lay my heart out on the line
Should I finally mean it this time
What is it about you and the way you move
You can groove to the beat of my heart
Maybe cupid's just doing his part

'Cus I know that I'm yours
So meet me on the floor

Dance with me move your body baby this is meant to be
Flowing like the ocean you're so heavenly
I gotta get you tonight
Why don't you dance with me
Don't tell me that it's love I know it's got to be
'Cus when were on the floor its only you and me
I know we won't sleep tonight

She calls me with her eyes they tell of paradise 
Baby show me a new point of view
Prove to me that this story is true

'Cus I know that I'm yours
So meet me on the floor

Dance with me, move your body baby this is meant to be
Flowing like the ocean you're so heavenly
I gotta get you tonight
Why don't you dance with me
Don't tell me that it's love i know it's got to be
'Cus when were on the floor its only you and me
I know we won't sleep tonight

Dance with me, move your body baby this is meant to be
Flowing like the ocean you're so heavenly
I gotta get you tonight
Baby why don't you dance with me
Don't tell me that it's love i know it's got to be
Cus when were on the floor its only you and me
I know we won't sleep tonight
