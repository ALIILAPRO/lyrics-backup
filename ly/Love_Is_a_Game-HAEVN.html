		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Love is a game played safe
Looks like you're winning
The hunt that feeds on prey

Your eyes are killing
Consider your eyes, you're wonderful
Say your eyes, you won't go home

I used to walk away
When floors were thinning
My mind is led astray
Looks like I'm willing
Consider your eyes, you won't recall
Say your eyes, you won't go home

You put me in danger
You put me
You put me in danger
You put me

I'll be at my weakest when you hold
When you hold
When you hold me

And I'll be on my knees then
When you hold, when you hold
When you hold on

I'll be at my weakest when you hold
When you hold
When you hold on

And I'll be on my knees then
When you hold, when you hold
When you hold on

I try to find my way
My mind is spinning
The darkness eats my day
Your heat is killing

You put me in danger
You put me
You put me in danger
You put me

I'll be at my weakest when you hold
When you hold
When you hold me

And I'll be on my knees then
When you hold, when you hold
When you hold on

I'll be at my weakest when you hold
When you hold
When you hold on

And I'll be on my knees then
When you hold, when you hold
When you hold on
