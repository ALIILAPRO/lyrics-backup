		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Our horns entangled, we were young in love and not prepared
Remember McGill nights, telling me you love my sight
Climbing Mont Royal to see your face illuminate the sky
Made I promise next September
Baby I’ll move out with you
Just to realize our horns can’t keep us close without the truth

(Ooo)These lucid dreams got me tripping
And I don’t know if it’s because I want to think about you
I remember vividly thinking you were the one
Until my heart ain’t have the room to love you

(Loving you, girl you know the truth)
I see you every single night
Girl I can’t stand the sight of you
(Loving you, girl you know the truth)
I need you just to get the fuck
Out of my dream’s before I fall in love with you
(Loving you, girl you know the truth)
I see you every single night
Girl, I can’t stand the sight of you
(Loving you, girl you know the truth)
I need you just to get the fuck
Out of my dream’s before I fall in love with you
Until I fall in love with you

Visit my night terrors just to drop a loving glare
Can’t seem to remember how your hands feel running through my hair
Fighting through distance
Cus our demons made a lovely pair
Our horns entangled, we were young in love and not prepared
Remember McGill nights, telling me you love my sight
Climbing mont royal to see your face illuminate the sky
Made I promise next September
Baby, I’ll move out with you
Just to realize our horns can’t keep us close without the truth

(Loving you, girl you know the truth)
I see you every single night
Girl, I can’t stand the sight of you
(Loving you, girl you know the truth)
I need you just to get the fuck
Out of my dream’s before I fall in love with you
(Loving you, girl you know the truth)
I see you every single night
Girl I can’t stand the sight of you
(Loving you, girl you know the truth)
I need you just to get the fuck
Out of my dream’s before I fall in love with you
