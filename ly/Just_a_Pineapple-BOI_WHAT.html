		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Spend my days in the jellyfish fields
Tryna fish you off my mind
Spend my nights at the goo lagoon
Experiencing the high tide
I feel like the man
With glass bones and paper skin
And a heart so fragile
Cuz without you this home's just a pineapple
I'm ready I'm ready
I'm ready to pick up the shellphone
And get you to come back home
Say the word, I'll get the paddy wagon on the road
Only got 594 points to go
Ravioli ravioli
Swear to you you'll be my one and only now
I know I'm not long tan and handsome
But I'm ugly and I'm proud
Spend my days in the jellyfish fields
Tryna fish you off my mind
Spend my nights at the goo lagoon
Experiencing the high tide
I feel like the man
With glass bones and paper skin
And a heart so fragile
Cuz without you this home's just a pineapple
Baby you're sweet like a pineapple
Queen of every sandcastle
Lured me in like you're bait on a tackle
Then you tore me apart like the hash slinging slasher
Then you kicked my ass like flats the flounder
Nothing is the same
And you're all to blame
For playing hooky with my heart
Like it's all a game
Not even the Krusty Krab hits right
When I'm eating a 3am patty without you by my side
Spend my days in the jellyfish fields
Tryna fish you off my mind
Spend my nights at the goo lagoon
Experiencing the high tide
I feel like the man
With glass bones and paper skin
And a heart so fragile
Cuz without you this homes just a pineapple
