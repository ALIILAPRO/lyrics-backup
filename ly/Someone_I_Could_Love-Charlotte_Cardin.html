		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I heard you liked me in school, mate
But I forgot about you, babe
Just never thought you were cool, hey
What can I do?
When did you get so cute, babe
Operating so smoothly
It's like you're looking right through me
Out of the blue

I just came to dance with myself
Baby, I don't need nobody else
But what's your sign, though?
Do you have a plan? I can tell
All you gotta do is take my hand
And I will follow you down the road

To somewhere under the bridge
Where you'll sing me a song
I never knew you were someone to love
Staring at your lips
While you're singing a song
Out of the blue
Now you're someone I could love
Someone I could love

Now you're standing here and I won't lie
You're getting close and I don't mind
Did we just cross at the wrong time?
When we were young
No, I wasn't ready
I had my head in a cloud when you met me
Might make it up to you now if you let me, baby

I just came to dance with myself
Baby, I don't need nobody else
But what's your sign, though?
Do you have a plan? I can tell
All you gotta do is take my hand
And I will follow you down the road

To somewhere under the bridge
Where you'll sing me a song
I never knew you were someone to love
Staring at your lips
While you're singing a song
Out of the blue
Now you're someone I could love
Someone I could love

(To somewhere under the bridge)
Take my hand (where you'll sing me a song)
And I will follow (I never knew you were someone to love)
Oh (staring at your lips)
Take my hand (while you're singing a song)
And I will follow you down the road

To somewhere under the bridge
Where you'll sing me a song
I never knew you were someone to love
Staring at your lips
While you're singing a song
Out of the blue
Now you're someone I could love
Someone I could love
