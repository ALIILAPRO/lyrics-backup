		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wrote this song for the last bitch that did me wrong
I can't believe you turned your back when I was all alone
The feds took my friends from me and I was on my own
They gon' try to take our swag, but they could never clone us
The richest in my family, at nineteen, I grown up
Niggas call for me and I don't even pick my phone up
Don't want no company 'cause lately ain't been feelin' no one
They plan on slumpin' me, but comfortably, we keep it on us

I think of Butta every single time that I perform
And I put on different Saint Laurent for my cologne
It's hard to tell if niggas jealous if they never met us
Don't know if I gotta take a picture or put 'em on a stretcher
Headshot, you all alone, no time to send a message
When you feel it in your bones the only time you regret it
Highbridge, we got big swag, I know you big mad
Luckily it was a shit bag and not a zip bag
But fuck that shit, I wrote this song for the, ha
I wrote this song for the last bitch that did me wrong
Hate that I met her even though I know she knew me better
Everything Biggavelli, brand new Benz coupes
Can't even blame you if you cross me 'cause I sin too
I prayed to God for all this money that I ran through
You think you shinin' in the light, well, bitch, I lamp too
Get a 'Mani, catch a flight right to Cancun
It was hard to ride the wave, but I swam through
On a PJ, me and all my damn goons
I'm so high, I feel like landin' on the damn moon
Baby, Dubai, goin' back to back in Phantoms
I don't want you to call me crazy, baby, call me Hussein
The big body heavy, it needed two lanes
Two frames, Cartier glasses, I see right through things
One thing that you can never call me is plain, hey
Plain Jane Patek Philippe, it'll cost you everythin'
A-B-double O-G-I-E, OD Louis, baby
Ooh, she crazy, I'ma be DTB 'til I'm probably eighty
Probably cost me half a milli' and I go to Saudi, baby
I'm leaving on a jet plane and I don't know when I'll be coming back here, baby
It's not you, it's me, I started moving so toxic lately
Hoes and these streets got me so cold-hearted lately
Too soon, this lifestyle too soon
Even when mama said it was too soon to get that two-tone
Cuban link, yellow and white or the rose gold
Got you them princess cut diamonds, they got a ring to 'em
And I got Murder Bravado up on my legs, ooh
And that SF90 ain't got no legroom
She broke my heart into pieces like it was a pencil
Quit showin' off and let me fuck your friends too
I keep a tooly on my waist like a utensil
I put them rocks around your neck just like a Flintstone
We started off with True Religions with the Balmain
Wanna be different, I say Lanvin, you say Lanvin

I wrote this song for the last bitch that did me wrong
I can't believe you turned your back when I was all alone
The feds took my friends from me and I was on my own
They gon' try to take our swag, but they could never clone us
The richest in my family, at nineteen, I grown up
Niggas call for me and I don't even pick my phone up
Don't want no company 'cause lately ain't been feelin' no one
They plan on slumpin' me, but comfortably, we keep it on us
