		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I apologize for playing with your eyes, but Iâ€™m obsessed with you
Rolling out of bed is morning in my head, â€˜cause Iâ€™m obsessed with you
Rose mirages into vases, I donâ€™t stand a chance
Quiet girls with wrist corsages, cordial silence, I canâ€™t dance

Holding breath by graveyards, salt over my shoulder, Iâ€™m obsessed with you
Rainbow-walking cave-heart never will be bolder, Iâ€™m obsessed with you
Chickenscratch Rembrandts of your likeness, all this nonsense makes me think
My insides cry â€œtry thy finestâ€ why, then, am I at my brink?

I told Doctor Tillis to prescribe an illness, but he said his schedule's filled with
Children who need Prozac, Prilosec and Lo-jack, triple-sec and Lexapro
For second-guesses. Drugs that heal. So we can touch instead of feel

Oh, I apologize for playing with your eyes, but Iâ€™m obsessed with you
Bite your tongue and smile, stick around a while. Iâ€™m obsessed with you
Neurotic erotic, neurotic erotic, neurotic erotic, neurotic erotic
Iâ€™m obsessed with you
