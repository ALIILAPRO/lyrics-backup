		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've loaded up a good thing
To see the way she feels
Faster than a Sosa home run
She's gonna get a little huh huh

Look at her now
She wants to take the wheel
She says, "You dirty dog"
You want to rock the bop and take it home

Why oh why am I gonna play
So many times it goes this way
My heart gets blown away
These eyes are blown away

Do you remember how were were
Do you remember summer days
Sometimes I feel like going down down

Walk like a loaded man (down down)
Get the bump to the bump the bump the bump soul (down down)
Move like a thing, swing line a thong
And do your jiggy mama til the break of dawn
Load the rocket, shock it and rock it til you drop
Do the bump to the bump and don't stop

Loaded up from dusk til dawn
I wonder how she feels
Dancin' around with my love
While I'm sitting waiting for the huh huh

Fired up that smoke screen
Red lipstick and high heels
Look at her now
She wants to rock the bop and take it home

Why oh why am I gonna play
So many times it goes this way
My heart gets blown away
These eyes are born again

Do you remember how we were
Do you remember summer days
Sometimes I feel like going down down

Do you remember how we were
Do you remember summer days
Sometimes I feel like going down down

Walk like a loaded man (down down)
Get the bump to the bump de bump de bump soul (down down)
Move like a thing, swing line a thong
And do your jiggy mama til the break of dawn
Load the rocket, shock it and rock it til you drop
Do the bump to the bump and don't stop

Walk like a loaded man (talk like a lambada)
Get the bump to the bump the bump the bump soul
(Slip into the funk like a sweet cologne)
Move like a thing, swing line a thong
And do your jiggy mama til the break of dawn
Load the rocket, shock it and rock it til you drop
Do the bump to the bump and don't stop
