		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Been up since six doin' rituals
Burning incense just to wish you well
Throw all my sins into wishing wells
Smelling your scent, I do miss you still

What kind of spell do you have me under?
What in the hell? Starting to wonder
I am not well, I'm going under
Can't help myself, lightning and thunder

Oh, what if the feeling's reciprocal?
She misses me like I miss her soul
I don't wanna drown and see your regret
But it seems like that's all I have left

What in the hell?
What kind of spell did you put over me? Controllin' me
What in the hell?
What kind of spell did you put over me? Controllin' me

I've been a sick individual
Ever since you made it official
You wouldn't admit the unthinkable
I am still here and available

What kind of spell do you have me under?
Oh, what in the hell? Starting to, starting to wonder
I am not well, I'm going under
Can't help myself (yeah), lighting and thunder

Oh, oh oh oh, ooh, babe
Yeah, yeah, yeah, ayy
Hey, yeah, yeah, uh

It's just like lightning and thunder
It's just like lightning and thunder
It's just like lightning and thunder
It's just like lightning and thunder

What in the hell?
what kind of spell did you put over me?
You took control of me
What in the hell?
what kind of spell did you put over me?
You took control of me, ohh yeah
