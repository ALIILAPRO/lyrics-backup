		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Motherfucker…
You say that you care but I... I know that you do not
You're not convincing anyone
Motherfucker…
You swear that you will change but I know that you will not
The bullshit goes on and on

Fuck you for lying and fawning when my back is turned
Fuck you for fishing pity when you get burned

Bite off your tongue and bury it into silence, you may cease to be
Raise them walls to seclude you
Cut the head off, leave the ruins to die, better not to be alive
Just stop breathing… stop breathing

Motherfucker…
Have your eyes ever shifted away from your reflection
It must've been love at first sight
The obscene mistake two people in hate could ever make
is to let something like you be born

I am disgusting
I need help
