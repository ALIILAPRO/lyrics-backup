		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The only time I feel good falling
Is when I'm falling fast and hard for you
The last two digits when I'm calling
Fade away but somehow I'll get through

The only time I feel good sinking
Is when I'm sinking fast and deep for you
You caught me as I was winking
Now I think my winking days are through

Could it be another change
To come and rearrange
Why can't you just feel the way I do

You can't love no one
You can't love something
You can't love nothing
You can't love anything
Till you can love yourself
Till you can love yourself
You can love yourself

The only time I feel good falling
Is when I'm falling fast and hard for you
I can't tell if you are stalling
So if you are please tell me what to do

The only time I feel good sinking
Is when I'm sinking fast and deep for you
You caught me when I was winking
Now I think my winking days are through

Could it be another change
To come and rearrange
Why can't you just feel that way I do
I do
I do
