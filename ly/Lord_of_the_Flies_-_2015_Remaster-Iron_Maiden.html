		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't care for this world anymore 
I just want to live my own fantasy 
Fate has brought us to these shores 
What was meant to be is now happening 

I've found that I like this living in danger 
Living on edge it feels
It makes us feel as one 
Who cares now what's right or wrong
It's reality 
Killing so we survive 
Wherever we may roam 
Wherever we may hide 
We've got to get away 

I don't want existence to end 
We must prepare ourselves for the elements 
I just want to feel like we're strong 
We don't need a code of morality 

I like all the mixed emotion and anger 
It brings out the animal the power you can feel 
And feeling so high with this much adrenalin 
Excited but scary to believe what we've become 

Saints and sinners 
Something within us 
We are lord of the flies 

Saints and sinners 
Something willing us 
To be lord of the flies

Oh, oh, oh, oh

Saints and sinners 
Something within us 
We are lord of the flies 

Saints and sinners 
Something willing us 
To be lord of the flies

Saints and sinners 
Something within us 
We are lord of the flies 

Saints and sinners 
Something willing us 
To be lord of the flies
