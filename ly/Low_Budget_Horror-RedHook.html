		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Maniac
Maniac
With a camera
You attack
In the dark
Like a predator
Poor mental health is an excuse I can't acquit
For being such a piece of shit
People like
People like you
Repulse me
Treating pain
Treating pain
Like it's currency
You inflict damage 'coz you're damaged to the core
I won't accept it anymore
Come on then
Cast me in your fucked up dream
Corn syrup murder scene
You're gonna
You're gonna
You're gonna die for
This low budget horror
Such a sad attempt to terrorise
Derivative plot line
You're gonna
You're gonna
You're gonna cry for
This low budget horror starring me
Did you think
That I'd shake
Shake and shiver?
Try to tear me apart
Like the ripper?
The only shocking thing about this story's twist
Is people like you exist
I'm Exorcist
You're Troll 2
Almost embarrassed for you
Fingerless Freddie, threadbare
Not even good enough for my nightmares
Come on then
Cast me in your fucked up dream
Corn syrup murder scene
You're gonna
You're gonna
You're gonna die for
This low budget horror
Such a sad attempt to terrorise
Derivative plot line
You're gonna
You're gonna
You're gonna cry for
This low budget horror starring me
Come on then
Cast me in your fucked up dream
Corn syrup murder scene
You're gonna
You're gonna
You're gonna die for
This low budget horror
And I
I never asked for this
But I'm not afraid
So go lay in
The death bed you've made
You're gonna
You're gonna
You're gonna cry for
This low budget horror starring me
