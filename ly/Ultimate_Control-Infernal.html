		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I, wonder why, Female strangers Passing by,
Makes you high;
Coz, you and I, ain't at all,
Not all alone, now
No, no, no

It, seems to me
There are things I'll never be,
Be to you;
Things, you don't dare,
Dare to speak of when you're near me
No, no, no

I gave my heart,
I gave my soul,
I gave you all to make you whole,
It's not enough no
It's not enough for you.

I gave my heart,
I gave my soul,
I gave you ultimate control,
It's not enough no
It's not enough for you.

I gave my heart,
I gave my soul,
I gave you ultimate control,
It's not enough no
It's not enough for you.

Yes I did
Yeah I did,
I gave you ultimate control,
Yes I did
Yeah I did,
I gave you ultimate control,

I gave you ultimate control,
Yes I did
Yes I did
