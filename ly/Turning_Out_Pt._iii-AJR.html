		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Got it out of my system, didn't I?
Did my two years on Tinder, didn't I?
Well, I wanted to be wanted
Suddenly I'm wanting more
So we got a bit tangled, didn't we?
It's the best thing that's happened to me
Got exactly what I wanted
What if I don't want this?
Am I missing something?

'Cause half the time I can't love right
And I can't have sex and we both get quiet
Boy, I must be one fucked up guy

Oh, my God, what a crazy night
It'll be fine, quick, let's get married
Man, I wish we were eighty-five
The rest of our life wouldn't sound so scary
Oh, I'm spiraling now, let's get kids and a house
Though I'm riddled with doubts
Is this how we turn out?

Hey, I love how you laugh when we're alone
How my dog's always happy when you're home
But my parents used to laugh too
And I think they had a dog
(I don't know, I don't know)
But you're late and you're messy, aren't you?
And I need too much attention from you
Though we shrug it off as nothing
Life is pretty long
It could turn into something

'Cause half the time I can't love right
And I'm half yours, and you're all mine
Boy, I must be one fucked up guy

Oh, my God, what a crazy night (crazy night)
It'll be fine, quick, let's get married
Man, I wish we were eighty-five (eighty-five)
The rest of our life wouldn't sound so scary
Oh, I'm spiraling now, let's get kids and a house
Though I'm riddled with doubts
Is this how we turn out?

(Is this how we turn out?)

Everyone's got it, everyone's got it
Everyone's got it all figured out
Everyone's got it, what do I not get?
Everyone's got it all figured out

(Everyone's got it) don't overthink it
One day at a time, kid
Add up the days
You got someone to do life with
Don't overthink it
It's not fucking science
Add up the days
You got someone to do life with
(Everyone's got it) don't overthink it
One day at a time, kid
Add up the days
You got someone to do life with
Love isn't big, kid
It's little and quiet
Let's do today
I think you'll turn out to like it
