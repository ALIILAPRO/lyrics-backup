		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You live in Hollywood
You're half an hour from me
Your reputation's good
I hope we've got a lot in common
I kinda think you should
Just drop it all and call me
You'd tell me on the phone
You really want to meet my family

What are you doing to me now?
What are you doing to me now?

You'd talk about your dad
He used to get so angry
He'd scare you and your brother
'Til you felt you needed saving
I know I'd let you in
On all my bad decisions
You'd make them feel less terrible
The second that you'd listen

What are you doing to me now?
What are you doing to me now?

You came out of the blue like that
You came out of the blue like that
I never could've seen you coming
I think you're everything I've wanted
You came out of the blue like that
You came out of the blue like that
I never could've seen you coming
I think you're everything I've wanted

I wonder if you know
If you can tell I'm losing
I'm going down without a fight
I don't know how you do it
You say we share a brain
Apologizing for it
But I take it as a compliment
You make me really nervous

What are you doing to me now?
What are you doing to me now?

You came out of the blue like that
You came out of the blue like that
I never could've seen you coming
I think you're everything I've wanted
You came out of the blue like that
You came out of the blue like that
I never could've seen you coming
I think you're everything I've wanted

What are you doing to me now?
What are you doing to me?
What are you doing to me now?
Mmm, mmm

Send me every song
That keeps you up from sleeping
I bet I could recite 'em all
I won't forget the feeling
Of staying up with you
Despite the space between us
I've never felt this close to someone
What if you're my weakness?

You came out of the blue like that
You came out of the blue like that
I never could've seen you coming
I think you're everything I've wanted
You came out of the blue like that
You came out of the blue like that
I never could've seen you coming
I think you're everything I've wanted

You came out of the blue like that
You came out of the blue like that
I never could've seen you coming
I think you're everything I've wanted
You came out of the blue like that
You came out of the blue like that
I never could've seen you coming
I think you're everything I've wanted
