		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I listened for my future in the wind
And it told me I was about to lose my way
Too many circles not in a line
Makes tomorrow feel just like today

Well, I never noticed I was treating myself so bad
Hanging out on the line
Another victim of a victimless crime

Bright is the light I see
The ship will come my way
Out to rescue me
Here come the one that I love
The flag is waving, I
I can see it with new eyes

The end came only to begin again
Graspin' at the love I cast aside
Too many nights and not enough days
Think tomorrow I'll just go on and hide

Well, I never thought that the hunger I had
Would drive me out of my mind
I was a victim of a victimless crime

Bright is the light I see
The ship will come my way
Out to rescue me
Here come the one that I love
The flag is waving, I
I can see it with new eyes

Well, I never noticed I was treating myself so bad
Hanging out on the line
I was a victim of a victimless crime

Bright is the light I see
The ship will come my way
Out to rescue me
Here come the one that I love
The flag is waving, I
I can see it with new eyes
Bright is the light I see
The ship will come my way
Out to rescue me
Here come the one that I love
The flag is waving, I
I can see it with new eyes
Bright is the light I see
The ship will come my way
Out to rescue me
Here come the one that I love
The flag is waving, I
