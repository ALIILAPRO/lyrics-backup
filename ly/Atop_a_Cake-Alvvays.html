		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I lie on a sofa awake
It's what you said last night
You'd like us on top of a cake
But you won't let me take a bite

Flowers arriving in fleets
Can't we talk about this?
Why let the State in our sheets?
Can't we do without it?

Well, I don't mean to wind you up
But I'd like to slow it down
How do I remain a pup?
If you put me in a gown?

What's it gotta do with you?
What's it gotta do with me?
How could I lose control when you're driving from the backseat?
What's it gotta do with you?
What's it gotta do with me?
How could I lose control when you're driving from the backseat?

Corners begin to repeat
I think we're getting lost
We walked to the end of the street
But we were bitten by the frost

So if you have to thaw me out
You can put me in a pail
Can we take another route?
I don't want to wear a veil

What's it gotta do with you?
What's it gotta do with me?
How could I lose control when you're driving from the backseat?
What's it gotta do with you?
What's it gotta do with me?
How could I lose control when you're driving from the backseat?

I'll wait in the lobby for someone to show
And if they don't come, I will know where to go
The bodies are lined up outside in the hall
I don't want to decay in a mall

If everything you say is true
Then why would I disagree?
How can I lose control...?

What's it gotta do with you?
What's it gotta do with me?
How could I lose control when you're driving from the backseat?

When you're driving from the backseat
