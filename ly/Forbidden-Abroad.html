		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We’re so close but I’ll never know, how
To tell you what I know you want out.
You don’t speak, but your eyes show it now
You don’t breathe, so the words, won’t come out
But I hear, what you’re not saying now

Don’t leave, we can work this all out
There must be a way for us now
You don’t speak, but your eyes show it now
You don’t breathe, so the words, won’t come out
But I hear, what you’re not saying now

Stay here, there is something we can’t ignore now
You know, as well as I do the consequences
I don’t care, if this is forbidden I just want you
And right now, all that I need is to know you want me to

I can’t take, the whisper of doubt,
We know this is the only way, now
You don’t speak, but your eyes show it now
You don’t breathe, so the words, won’t come out
But I hear, what you’re not saying now

Stay here, there is something we can’t ignore now
You know, as well as I do the consequences
I don’t care, if this is forbidden I just want you
And right now, all that I need is to know you want me to
