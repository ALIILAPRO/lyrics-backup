		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Your letter came yesterday
Your, flying home for Christmas
Could you stop to see me smile

I sat down to remember
All the pain we shared
But I drifted to times not so hard

Oh I see you in the corner of
Life's grand ballroom
And I tremble to see you again

Let's all go home again
Find where we have been
Time is never understood
I see you holding me
Please don't let me be
Tonight just may be our last

The bell rings to tell me
You're here now
And I wonder if your eyes glow and sparkle in the night

And I can't believe you look this way
Like a doll in satin
On a birthday afternoon

Hold me tightly
Like never before
You've come to say your alive

Let's all go home again
Find where we have been
Time is never understood
I see you holding me
Please don't let me be
Tonight just may be our last

The sun arrives
You wake and peek outside
Touch my hand and walk right away
I hear you close the door
I don't feel joy anymore
And my heart is racing to who knows where

And I say it's our last night
And clutch my soul so tight
But I'll let go to have you again

Let's all go home again
Find where we have been
Time is never understood
I see you holding me
Please don't let me be
Tonight just may be our last
