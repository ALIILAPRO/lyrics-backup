		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
Oh yeah

You are my fire
The one desire
Believe when I say
I want it that way

But we are two worlds apart
Can't reach to your heart
When you say
That I want it that way

Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
Tell me why
I never wanna hear you say
I want it that way

Am I your fire?
The one, yeah, desire
Yes, I know that it's too late
But I want it that way

Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a mistake (tell me)
Tell me why
'Cause I never wanna hear you say
I want it that way

Now I can see that we've fallen apart
From the way that it used to be, yeah
No matter the distance, I want you to know
That deep down inside of me

You are my fire
The one desire
You are (you are, you are, you are)

Don't want to hear you say
Ain't nothin' but a heartache (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Ain't nothin' but a mistake (don't want to hear you say)
I never want to hear you say (oh yeah)
I want it that way

Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Ain't nothin' but a mistake (you better tell me why)
Tell me why
I never want to hear you say
I want it that way
'Cause I want it that way
