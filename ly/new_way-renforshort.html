		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's been twelve days since I had to cry
My eyes are dry, all of these feelings I'm feeling inside
I don't know why, not used to this shit
No, no, no, no, no, no

Will it always feel wrong?
All summer long
Need something off, so that I can feel on
I'm tripping out
What am I feeling
Now, now, now, now, now, now?

Then you asked me if I would wanna
Mix sour keys with marijuana
Take me home, wanna meet your mama
I kinda miss the drama

I need a new way to hate you
I'm not used to feeling this good
I wish you'd fuck up, so I could
Talk shit about you in a song
I need a new way to hate you
Yeah, I need the skies to turn grey
Got nothing to fight about
Nothing to write about now
I need a new way to hate you

I just don't get why you're still around
Figured by this point that you'd let me down
All the nice things that you say
Make it harder for me to admit that I'm happier now

Then you asked me if I would wanna
Mix sour keys with marijuana
Windows down listening to Nirvana
I kinda miss the drama

I need a new way to hate you
I'm not used to feeling this good
I wish you'd fuck up, so I could
Talk shit about you in a song
I need a new way to hate you
Yeah, I need the skies to turn grey
Got nothing to fight about
Nothing to write about now
I need a new way to hate you, you
I need a new way to hate you, you

Hold me close
Tell me that I'm the worst thing that you've done
Hold me close
And tell me your ex was more fun

Hold me close
Tell me that I'm the worst thing that you've done
Hold me close
And tell me your ex was more fun

I need a new way to hate you (I need a new way to hate you)
I'm not used to feeling this good (not used to feeling)
I wish you'd fuck up, so I could
Talk shit about you in a song (talk shit about you in a song)
I need a new way to hate you
Yeah, I need the skies to turn grey (yeah, I need the skies to turn grey)
Got nothing to fight about
Nothing to write about now
I need a new way to hate you
