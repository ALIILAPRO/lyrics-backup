		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here's a little story how the west was won
The white men came and took out everyone
They used dirty blankets and they used machine guns
And they didn't think twice about what they'd done

Here's a little story about Kevin Bacon
He had a bunch of money but it got taken
He got a bunch of lawyers and he tried to sue
But Bernie looked him and said hey fuck you!

Don't bring a knife to a gun fight, you'll lose
Don't bring a knife to a gun fight, you'll lose

Here's a little story about the congressmen
They bailed out all of their billionaire friends
You can blame Bush, or you can try to blame Obama
But you should've fuckin' learned from your daddy or your momma

Don't bring a knife to a gun fight, you'll lose

Some fights just ain't fair
Some fights just ain't fair
Some fights just ain't fair
You don't bring a knife to a gun fight, you'll lose!

Here's a little story about Tienanmen Square
The people rose up and said Life ain't fair
Now they're sweating in a shop making iPhones and
You stand in front of tanks, the tanks are gonna win!

Don't bring a knife to a gun fight, you'll lose
Don't bring a knife to a gun fight, you'll lose

Don't bring a knife to a gun fight, you'll lose
Don't bring a knife
Don't bring a knife, you'll lose
