		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's gettin' late
I'm making my way over to my favorite place
I gotta get my body moving
Shake the stress away
I wasn't looking for nobody when
You looked my way possible candidate, yeah
Who knew that you'd be up in
Here lookin' like you do
You're making stayin' over here impossible
Baby, I'ma say your aura is incredible
If you don't have to go, don't

Do you know what you started?
I just came here to party
But now we're rockin' on the dance floor
Actin' naughty your hands around my waist
Just let the music play
We're hand in hand, chest to chest
And now we're face to face

I wanna take you away, let's
Escape into the music, DJ, let it play
I just can't refuse it
Like the way you do this
Keep on rockin' to it please don't stop the
Please don't stop the music

Please don't stop- please don't stop-
Please don't stop- please don't stop-
Please don't stop- please don't stop-
Please don't stop-
Please don't stop the music

Please don't stop- please don't stop-
Please don't stop- please don't stop-
Please don't stop- please don't stop-
Please don't stop-
Please don't stop the music

Baby, are you ready? â€™Cause
It's getting close
Don't you feel the passion ready to explode?
What goes on between us, no one has to know
This is a private show, this
Is a private show, oh

Do you know what you started?
I just came here to party
But now we're rockin' on the dance floor
Actin' naughty your hands around my waist
Just let the music play
We're hand in hand, chest to chest
And now we're face to face

I wanna take you away, let's
Escape into the music, DJ, let it play
I just can't refuse it
Like the way you do this
Keep on rockin' to it please don't stop the
Please don't stop the music

I wanna take you away, let's
Escape into the music, DJ, let it play
I just can't refuse it
Like the way you do this
Keep on rockin' to it please don't stop the
Please don't stop the music

Please don't stop- please don't stop-
Please don't stop- please don't stop-
Please don't stop- please don't stop-
Please don't stop-
Please don't stop the music
Please don't stop- please don't stop-
Please don't stop- please don't stop-
Please don't stop- please don't stop-
Please don't stop-
Please don't stop the music

Please don't stop- please don't stop-
Please don't stop- please don't stop-
Please don't stop- please don't stop-
Please don't stop-
Please don't stop the music
