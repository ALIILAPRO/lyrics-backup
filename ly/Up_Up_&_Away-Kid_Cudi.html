		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now when the sun come up
I'll be there to say what up in the morning
brush my teeth find that clip I been lookin' for since last night
I feel so caught up, in a bud
I floats around in my bedroom
turn around see myself in the mirror I guess I'm cool
And those happy thoughts in my head
I'm feeling like I'm Peter Pan
minus the tights and the fairy's
Happy to see how far I've come to the same place
It began my dreams imaginations
Perfectly at peace so I move along a bit higher

I'll be up up and away, up up and away
Cause they gon' judge me anyway so whatever
I'll be up up and away, up up and away
Cause in the end they'll judge me any so whatever

I learn, I see the dreams are made so I'm cooler now
I could take care of my mom and my little niece Suri
So sing along lil' mama you ain't gotta worry 'bout no drama no,
I provide for friends and fam' and fans Cleveland city we grinding man
stay at flow the kids hope
I never let a motherfucka break me dog
Who gives a fuck if a nigga don't like your steeds
Tell 'em to buzz off your N-U-T's we don't care what people say
dudes who critique your clothes on most day
I ain't gotta wait for no one If I wanna fly I could fly for freedom, hey!

I'll be up up and away, up up and away
Cause they gon' judge me anyway so whatever
I'll be up up and away, up up and away
Cause in the end they'll judge me any so whatever

Wake up wake up wake wake up
Wake up wake up wake wake up, yeah!
Wake up wake up wake wake up (We'll be rollin' on up)
Wake up wake up wake wake up (We'll be rollin' on up)
Wake up wake up wake wake up (We'll be rollin' on up)
Wake up wake up wake wake up (I'll be rollin' on up)
Wake up wake up wake wake up

I'll be up up and away, up up and away
Cause they gon' judge me anyway so whatever
I'll be up up and away, up up and away
Cause in the end they'll judge me any so whatever

I'll be up up and away, up up and away
Cause they gon' judge me anyway so whatever
I'll be up up and away, up up and away
Cause in the end they'll judge me any so whatever

Whatever, so whatever
Whatever, so whatever

The end is never the end.
A new challenge awaits.
A test no man could be prepared for.
A new hell he must conquer and destroy.
A new level of growth he must confront himself.
The machine in the ghost within.
This is the journey of the man on the moon.
