		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Beach boys on the ride home
I can get there with my eyes closed
Exactly thirty-four minutes after I pull out your driveway
You dial my phone

Paper cover rock
Scripture cover Peter
Yeah, I'm cuttin' off my locks
And I'm changin' my demeanor

Pool days, high tops
With my blue face, ice pops
I'ma make a shoelace necklace
Yeah, we whippin' pop's old Lexus

And I'm skippin' school days, mic drops
Eyes on summer like cyclops
Yeah, we fallin' off the sidewalk
Mama wants you home before nightfall

Summer come and I ain't got a new car
Yeah I'm still gettin' scooped up
Call me by my first letter, "Ayy, E what's up?"
Every now and then city need a refresher

Breakin' up to Sufjan
Wake up on your futon
Why you in my crewneck? Wait
(I really like that shirt)

Jerry's line too long
Teenage mutant
Comin' out of my shell, ayy

Yeah this be that corner piece, cornerstone
Ten piece, corner sto'
Skinned knees, cortisone
And ex links, chromosome

Summer feet, cobblestone
Momma leave, home alone
On my feet, Chuckie T's
On my sleeve, Coraz√≥n

'99 Titans
Close to my goals, yeah
Look like Kevin Dyson
When my curfew gettin' closer

Hand me downs
Pick me ups
Dark side
Shouts Ryan
In my hood
Call it buck

Pool days, high tops
With my blue face, ice pops
I'ma make a shoelace necklace
Yeah, we whippin' pop's old Lexus

And I'm skippin' school days, mic drops
Eyes on summer like cyclops
Yeah, we fallin' off the sidewalk
Mama wants you home before nightfall

Na-na-na
Na-na-na
Na-na
Na-na-na

Na-na-na
Na-na-na
Na-na
Na-na-na

You can't stand me
You legless
Might grow my hair long
Like Legolas
Yeah, I'm feelin' ruthless, reckless
