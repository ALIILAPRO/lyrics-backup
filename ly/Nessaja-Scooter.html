		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Always lived my life alone
Been searching for a place called home
I know that I've been cold as ice
Ignored the dreams, too many lies
Somewhere deep inside, somewhere deep inside me
I found, the child I used to be
And I know that it's not too late
Never
Too late

3 AM
The painted cow 
Yeah

You ain't stoppin' us now 
(Wonderful human beings) (Hey)
Yeah, I am the junglist soldier
Come on
The rocket launcher stopped ya (hey)
It's not a bird, it's not a plane 
It must be Dave who's on the train
Wanna wanna get'cha, gonna gonna get'cha
Tell 'em that I told ya
Yeah

Always lived my life alone
Been searching for a place called home
I know that I've been cold as ice
Ignored the dreams, too many lies
Somewhere deep inside
Somewhere deep inside me
I found, the child I used to be
And I know that it's not too late
Never
Too late

Alright
Are you ready? It's not a game
I chant so much, I turn you insane
Wanna wanna get'cha, gonna gonna get'cha
Messing up the area, yeah (hey)

Come on (hey)
I am the freshman
Messing up the jam
Turning up the stereo
Join the caravan (hey)

Skippy, the rain won't come

Somewhere deep inside
Somewhere deep inside me
I found, the child I used to be
And I know that it's not too late
Never
Too late
