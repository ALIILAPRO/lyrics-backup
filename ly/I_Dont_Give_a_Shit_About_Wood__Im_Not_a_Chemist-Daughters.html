		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They shaved off fourteen points for ugly. they dumbed down the structure like some amputee. a broken bible salesman going door to door selling mouthfuls of shit. flowers spread across his teeth. bloody palms imprisoned in his slacks. shouting at size ten and a half feet.

remember when we were young?
(ohh)
Well we're just like them now
(ohh)
These choppers won't chew no more
(ohh)
These knees won't bend no more
(ohh)

this face can't sell the words for sure. there are a million other birds from the sidewalk to ceiling to the cats who called the shots while I dipped in the finger tip sleep.
