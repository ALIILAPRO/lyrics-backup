		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Southern skies and alibis and midnights void of consequence
Seasoned lies and last goodbyes that criticize all common sense
Biggest fish of smaller seas leave tragedies of circumstance
In a town where angels drown, I'll see you ‘round in spite of this

Come in close, don't forget
I'm not through with you yet
Pull the cord, drop the net
I'm not through with you

College scenes and olive greens, the works of every artisan
Hardened dreams and beauty queens and politics so partisan
Simpletons with finger guns have overrun your congresses
Eager teens with meager means will fill your empty promises

Come in close, don't forget
I'm not through with you yet
Pull the cord, drop the net
I'm not through with you

Come in close, don't forget
I'm not through with you yet
Pull the cord, drop the net
I'm not through with you

Come in close, don't forget
I'm not through with you yet
Pull the cord, drop the net
I'm not through with you

Come in close, don't forget
I'm not through with you yet
Pull the cord, drop the net
I'm not through with you
