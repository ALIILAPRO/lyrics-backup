		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I believe in you and me
I believe that we will be
In love eternally
As far as I can see
You will always be
The one for me
Oh yes you will

I believe in dreams again
I believe that love will never end
And like the river finds the sea
I was lost now I'm free
I believe in you and me

I will never leave your side
I will never hurt your pride
When all the chips are down
I will always be around
Just to be right there where you are my love
Oh I love you boy

I will never leave you out
I will always let you in
To places no one's ever been
Deep inside can't you see
I believe in you and me

Maybe I'm a fool
To feel the way I do
But I would play the fool forever
Just to be with you forever

I believe in miracles
Love's a miracle
And baby you're a dream come true
I was lost now I'm free
I believe in you and me
I was lost now I'm free girl
I believe in you and me
