		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm still remembering the day 
I gave my life away 
I'm still remembering the time 
You said you'd be mine 
Yesterday was cold and bare
Because you were not there
Yesterday was cold 
My story has been told 
I need your affection all the way 
The world has changed or I've changed in a way 
I try to remain
I'm trying not to go insane 
I need your affection all the way

Get way
Get way
Get way
Get way
Get way

I'm still remembering my life 
Before I became your wife 
I'm still remembering the pain 
And the mind games 
Reverse psychology 
Never tainted me 
I didn't sell my soul
I didn't sell my soul

I need your affection all the way
The world has changd or I've changed in a way
I try to remain
I'm trying not to go insane
I need your affection all the way

They say the cream will always 
Rise to the top 
They say the good people 
Are always first to drop 
What of Kurt Cobain? 
Will his presence still remain? 
Remember J-F-K? 
Ever saintly in a way 

Where are you now
Where are you now
Where are you now
I say, where are you now

I need your affection all the way
I need your affection all the way
I need your affection all the way
I need your affection all the way

All the way, all the way
All the way, all the way
All the way, all the way
All the way, all the way
All the way
