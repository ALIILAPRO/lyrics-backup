		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You went away without a warning
Left me in a cold world on my own
You molded me into your special woman
Now the soul I have is not my own

Look at me, my love
What happened to the real me?
Look what you've done, my love
Why'd you do what you did to me?

I tried to win your love
You were cold, you kept your love from me
I tried to warm your heart
Now my heart is crying constantly

Look at me, my love
What happened to the real me?
Look what you've done, my love
Why'd you do what you did to me?

How did you possess my soul?
Tell me why do I still need you so?

I feel the pain, pain of nothing
Without you by my side, I can't, I won't go on
And right now I feel your arms so warm around me
But you're gone, baby, oh, you're gone

Look at me, my love
What happened to the real me?
Look what you've done, my love
Why'd you do what you did to me?
Look at me, my love
What happened to the real me?
Look what you've done, my love
Oh
Look at me, my love
What happened to the real me?
Look at me, my love
What happened to the real me?
Look at me, my love
What happened to the real me?
