		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Little fireworks that light up for me
In my fingertips I burn my worries
Do it somethin' like that A-track, shorty
Keep it in rotation, it's a celebration every time we smoke, smoke
Do it somethin' like that A-track, shorty
Keep it in rotation, it's a celebration every time we

You don't even gotta ask, you know I got some
Pre-rolls in the bag, who should I shotgun? (Yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
To the left or the right, 'long as it rotate
It's a bisexual blunt, it can go both ways, yeah

Hotbox while you hit the box, top, get you to the top
Rock but if it's a lot, I can take it from you
Got nothin' but that gas, pass it, and pass it back
Cough, you don't need a mask
This that shit you smoke to

Little fireworks that light up for me
In my fingertips I burn my worries
Do it somethin' like that A-track, shorty
Keep it in rotation, it's a celebration every time we smoke, smoke
Do it somethin' like that A-track, shorty
Keep it in rotation, it's a celebration every time we-

Trees, got the smoke, now we just need a lighter
That body, ah, you got that Earth, Wind and Fire
If you know how to roll, then come be my supplier
Up in the clouds, we get high like Mariah

Hotbox while you hit the box, top, get you to the top
Rock but if it's a lot, I can take it from you (I can take it from you)
Got nothin' but that gas, pass it, and pass it back
Cough, you don't need a mask
This that shit you smoke to

Little fireworks that light up for me
In my fingertips I burn my worries
Do it somethin' like that A-track shorty
Keep it in rotation, it's a celebration every time we smoke, smoke
Do it somethin' like that A-track, shorty
Keep it in rotation, it's a celebration every time we-

Lucky and V Monét
Sound like a lucky day
Roll up and let it play
This that shit you smoke to
