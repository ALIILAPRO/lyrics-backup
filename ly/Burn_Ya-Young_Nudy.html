		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fuckin' Glizzy look so motherfuckin' good
Nigga if Young Metro don't trust you
I'ma shoot ya
I think I'm the only nigga in
The 6 with this motherfucka nigga
Metro Boomin want some more, nigga

Yeah, I don't trust nobody
Gotta keep that burner
If you try to run up I'll burn ya
I'll burn ya
Everybody trill, nobody gotta keep the burner
If you try to run up I'll burn ya
I'll burn ya
I don't trust nobody, I'll burn ya
If you try to run up I'll burn ya
I'll burn ya
I don't trust nobody, I'll burn ya
If you try to run up I'll burn ya
I'll burn ya

Gotta keep a burner
You is not the gang, nigga
No I cannot trust you
Slimeball, he don't fuck
With motherfuckin' busters
Hit that AK-47, you dancin' like Usher
Bitch man, damn hoe, your hoe
Yeah she's a sucker suck on this tip, hoe
Yeah she's a dick lover
I'm a molly popper
Got your hoe jaws lockin'
In the kitchen water whippin' chicken
Got these hoes pussy poppin'
And the trap callin'
Yeah this bitch still boomin'
On the metro, just made some
Meet me at the Texaco, I got good blow
And if you try to rob, I'ma burn you, nigga

I don't trust nobody, gotta keep that burner
If you try to run up I'll burn ya
I'll burn ya
Everybody trill, nobody gotta keep the burner
If you try to run up I'll burn ya
I'll burn ya
I don't trust nobody, I'll burn ya
If you try to run up I'll burn ya
I'll burn ya
I don't trust nobody, I'll burn ya
If you try to run up I'll burn ya

The difference between me and you
My bitch bad
Everywhere I go, you know I let my pants sag
I got that 30, that bitch that longway
Know it's hangin' out
If a nigga try to play I
Call up them young niggas
Dracos hangin' out
Ain't no more motherfuckin' shootouts
We done growed up
Young nigga droppin' bodies now
And I'll motherfuckin' burn ya
Nigga try to play, I'll have to burn you
Nigga
Your hoe pussy stank, she's a burner, nigga
I've been gettin' money, I'm a earner
Nigga y'all niggas lame as fuck
What your term lil nigga?
Know you ain't gang, you play
And I'll burn you, nigga

I don't trust nobody, gotta keep that burner
If you try to run up I'll burn ya
I'll burn ya
Everybody trill, nobody gotta keep the burner
If you try to run up I'll burn ya
I'll burn ya
I don't trust nobody, I'll burn ya
If you try to run up I'll burn ya
I'll burn ya
I don't trust nobody, I'll burn ya
If you try to run up I'll burn ya
