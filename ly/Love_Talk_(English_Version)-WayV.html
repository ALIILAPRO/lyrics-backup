		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can hear it callin'
Loving the way you wanna talk
Touch me tease me feel me up
Callin'
Something in the way you wanna talk

You got me sayin' you got me sayin'
How you doing
Tell me what's your name
What's your sign
Feeling like you're into me
Yeah, I'm waiting, I just want you to come on over where I'm staying

Falling for a stranger
Good gracious
I might even fly out to Vegas (Catch a flight)
I'm thinking maybe you'd be down to do it
But you don't know what I'm saying

Got me going through the roof, roof
Really don't care what we do, do, hey
We could fly to the moon
I see your lips moving
But we ain't got a clue

Baby we two distant strangers
I know you don't speak my language
But I love the way she's talking to me

I can hear it callin'
From where you are
Loving the way you wanna talk
Touch me tease me feel me up
Touch me tease me feel me up

Call me when it's after dark
Something in the way you wanna talk
Touch me tease me feel me up
Touch me tease me feel me up

Max max max, we can have it all (To the max)
If you back back back back, back it up
Take you where you wanna got the gas in the tank
If you really wanna make it last (Git git git)

Talks cheap I'm bout that action
Girl can you feel the attraction
Baby come closer I got what you want
I can tell that you want it there's no need to front

Baby we two distant strangers
I know you don't speak my language
But I love the way she's talking to me

I can hear it callin'
From where you are
Loving the way you wanna talk
Touch me tease me feel me up
Touch me tease me feel me up

Call me when its after dark
Something in the way you wanna talk
Touch me tease me feel me up
Touch me tease me feel me up

Ooh tell me babe
Tell me how you like it babe
I don't even know your name
I love the way you're talking to me

Ooh tell me babe
Tell me how you like it babe
I don't even know your name
I love the way you're talking to me

Girl the way you move
You can feel my eyes on you, ooh ooh
Do it like nobody do
Tell me what you wanna hear
Lemme whisper in your ear
I just wanna have you here yeah

Okay baby make it fast (Make it fast, right)
We could put the country on the map
Run it back you gon' have me running laps
I just, I just want you to make it clap

One at a time, baby you're mine
Promise that you'll never give it away
I need a sign
Calling me up, calling me yours
Calling my line
Doing what you're doing to me baby it's a crime

I can hear it callin'
From where you are
Loving the way you wanna talk
Touch me tease me feel me up
Touch me tease me feel me up

Call me when it's after dark
Something in the way you wanna talk
Touch me tease me feel me up
Touch me tease me feel me up

Ooh tell me babe
Tell me how you like it babe
I don't even know your name
I love the way you're talking to me

Ooh tell me babe
Tell me how you like it babe
I don't even know your name
I love the way you're talking to me
