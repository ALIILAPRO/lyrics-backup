		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh, uh (yeah)
Heads up, nigga (yeah)
Wale (yeah)
Plain Pat (uh, uh)
Emile

Off jump, boo, Cudi give ya funk
Hit ya in your head then it work it to your rump (come on)
Hatin' niggas can hate, leave 'em all stumped
They gotta like a nigga, call me Obama (yup)
Not a hypebeast while you beast for the hype (no, no)
Yeah, I'm the underdog, story of my life (yup)
Matter fact, I dreamed that I lived twice (uh)
Once as a slave who imagined bein' free
And made it out happy for his family and his seed (uh)
And now me, you can call me Mr. Friendly
One life to live, but no actin' like my nigga Friendy
Can't stand evil bitches with they Fendi
All they do is envy and plot up on my loins (uh, uh)
I give you options, baby, flip a coin (uh, uh)
You get McDonalds, forget the sirloin (ha, ha)
Hatin' my mackin', they askin'

Is there any love (uh, uh, uh, uh)
In this world? (Uh, uh)
Is there any love (uh, uh, uh, uh)
In this world? (Uh, uh)
Is there any love (uh, uh, uh, uh)
In this world of ours?
Is there any love (uh, uh)
In this world?

Folarin, the muse of the hater
That music is greater, stupid nigga, bring your face up
Bamas surprised, deprived from attention
The pride of the district arise so they listenin'
From where gorillas territorial for inches
When it come to pistols, these niggas don't John Lynch them
Off rip that's genius
You niggas so-so like seamstress
No more amore, I refuse to force you
Maybe I lack the fortitude to try to court you (try to court you)
Of course they all hate
Early adapters agree they all late
So what that say about my watch?
To y'all minds I'm like a UK clock
Hours ahead, so wack niggas is sayin' 
(What they sayin', young?) They sayin'
(What they sayin', young?) They sayin'?

Is there any love (uh, uh, uh, uh)
In this world? (Uh, uh)
Is there any love (uh, uh, uh, uh)
In this world? (Uh, uh)
Is there any love (uh, uh, uh, uh)
In this world of ours?
Is there any love (uh, uh, uh)
In this world?

I was born to do the damn thing (uh)
Story of Cudi, nigga, getting out my dreams
Zero options to choose (no)
Living in a box full of Cuyahoga booze, and listen
I stayed away from reading The Plain Dealer (yup)
Most of my niggas back in Cleveland were playin' dealers, uh (word)
Who whipped Supremes, the candy-painted eyes
But the love from the boppers had him watchin' they rise (uh)
Wasn't no love for a nigga in the smug (no)
Sipping out a cup, a concoction for cruising (uh)
High off life? My nigga not even
I'ma go to war with the Devil 'til we're even (uh, uh, uh)
Bobbing and weaving, spiritual hymn singing (yeah)
No commentary, my man, I come out swinging (uh)
And this will be the song that we sing
Any young nigga with visions when he's sleeping (word up)

Is there any love (uh, uh, uh, uh)
In this world? (Uh, uh)
Is there any love (uh, uh, uh, uh)
In this world? (Uh, uh)
Is there any love (uh, uh, uh, uh)
In this world of ours?
Is there any love (uh, uh, uh)
In this world?
