		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Father God, I'm prayin' to you for somebody
who knows you Lord but just hasn't
hasn't been seein' you in the right view lately, Hear me out

Father, I'm prayin' for a friend he and I are pretty close
and out of all my friends for this one I'm concerned the most
He say he readin' daily but he ain't really learnin'
He been in church but say that he ain't moved by any sermon
His face weak, he ain't prayed in a week
he wake up and just weep with his face in the sink Lord
you gotta help my man, I'm prayin' for him daily
he ain't sinned but it just seem as if he goin' crazy
He say he feelin' trapped, can't even head up 
the mall coz every lady's half-dressed temptin' him to lust and fall
He keep the TV off, videos just make him feel 
that he ain't really nothin' without money, girls and shiny wheels
The other day he told me that he felt less a man 
coz he ain't have a five-year plan or a piece of 
land and man it's crazy coz his family think so much of him
plus he got a godly wife who always showin' 
love for him but he's strugglin', even though he talk to me
I tell him what to do but he don't listen when he oughta' be
I'm scared for him coz there's people that look up to him
he got some younger siblings who been changed by 
what he's done for them but is it done for him
Lord don't let it be, if he don't wanna talk to you then 
Father hear from me, is it done for him
Lord don't let it be
if he don't wanna talk to you then Father hear from me

Yeah, I'm prayin' for you, yeah, I'm prayin' for you
Yeah, I'm prayin' for you, yeah, yeah, I'm prayin' for you

God, his condition is worsen since we were 
last conversed and I'm with him now and he ain't 
doin' well and this I'm certain
He say he tryna' trust you, doesn't wanna disgust 
you but he was in the mist of sinners
and did not discuss you and just today his anxiety's 
got the best of him, he knows Christ but 
for hours refuse to rest in Him
he's not the best of men but Lord 
I know he really loves you and I can't understand 
why lately he's not thinkin' of you
People trust this dude, you could crush this dude
Father he needs more of you I pray you touch this dude
what can I say to him? I'm determined to pray for him 
Father empty and brake him I pray you'll just have
your way with him, coz there's a change in him 
and the effects are strong, I pray you open up his
heart before the next song and when he gets home
I pray he'll open up the sixty-six book love
letter you wrote and soak it up coz he ain't
hearin' You and he ain't feelin' me and God
I know it's killin' You because it's killin'
me and matter of fact there's somethin' else
he's concealin' see, the person that
I've been prayin' about is really me

Yeah, I'm prayin' for you, yeah, I'm prayin' for you
Yeah, I'm prayin' for you, yeah, yeah, I'm prayin' for you
