		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bitch been counting paper up, been counting paper.
Watch how you move, the drac got a laser
Baby your nigga a bitch, he carry a taser
Run the whole game in these Balenci ravers
Two seater coupe, skkrt off, bitch see you later.
Niggas playing both sides and it's cool
Boy don't talk on my name, you gon lose
How you flexing that shit but it's Fu
My shit cost me a lick , Christian Lou
Grab a seat cut a brick up or two
How you talk with no racks you a fool
Got 5 bitches I can't even choose
I'm wit Big herc I can never lose
Spit my pain on a beat and get paid from it
You can't do it if you don't get paid from it
And you tryna catch up you too late on it
I took Givenchy linen and Laid on it
Treat these rappers like bitches and play wit em
At the table I can't share a plate wit em
I got brick city shooters I stay wit em
With my Fanta and you know it stay muddy
And we here bout that Money not play buddy
Told that bitch to go home cause I been nutted
