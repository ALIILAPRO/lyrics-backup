		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We can build a wall downtown
We can build a wall and divide the places we hang out
And our friends will get caught up in the middle
Will they hate us now?
Seems like it's the only thing we'll ever wanna talk about
At least for a while, yeah

I'll admit, yeah, yeah
It will take some time
To get over us

And I know I'm gonna feel like shit the minute you go
And you're gonna miss the make-up that I left on your pillow
It will hurt until it doesn't if we keep moving on, mmm
And I know it's gonna suck to spend my birthday alone
But the money that we saved up, we can spend on our own
It's gonna sting a little 'cause nobody likes moving on
When you're moving on

But can I keep your favorite shirt?
The one that's a little too big with the cigarette burns
So I can smile about the things that used to get on my nerves
And you can keep calling when you've had a few and slurring your words
At least for a while, yeah

I'll admit, yeah, yeah
It will take some time
To get over us

And I know I'm gonna feel like shit the minute you go
And you're gonna miss the make-up that I left on your pillow
It will hurt until it doesn't if we keep moving on, mmm
And I know it's gonna suck to spend my birthday alone
But the money that we saved up, we can spend on our own
It's gonna sting a little 'cause nobody likes moving on
When you're moving on
When you're moving on
When you're moving on

I think I'm gonna hurt someone
It will take a few times to convince myself you weren't the one
No, you weren't the one
