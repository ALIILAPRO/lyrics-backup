		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Went from hands on the wheel
To hands on my thigh
To hands on my body in the back of the Porsche
I'm in love with your fingertips
I reminisce
Places you kiss
Girl, it's been too long
And when you rock them short nails, that's low key sentimental
Now keep 'em cut though so there ain't no incidentals
And I love them tattoos, I still gotta learn 'em all
Tell me when you're gonna make them the writings on my wall and

Touch me
Feel me
Get to know me inside
If you love me, show me

Touch me (with your hands and with your)
Feel me (with your hands and with your)
Get to (with your hands and with your)
Know me (with your hands and with your)
Inside (with your hands and with your)
If you (with your hands and with your)
Love me (with your hands and with your)
Show me (with your hands and with your)

Show me
Had a feeling we would take it this far 
When you kissed me in your car

Went from me under you, to you under me
Slow jams on repeat so I think I'm in love
Don't you hear the sounds that I make as we escalate
Cover up my face if I'm saying too much
You see how we connect, baby, this ain't coincidental
We in your Porsche, but you coulda got it in a rental
You so good with your hands like a player with the ball
So next time you use your touch screen you know who you should call, baby

Touch me
Feel me
Get to know me inside
If you love me, show me (show me)

Touch me (with your hands and with your)
Feel me (with your hands and with your)
Get to (with your hands and with your)
Know me (with your hands and with your)
Inside (with your hands and with your)
If you (with your hands and with your)
Love me (with your hands and with your)
Show me (with your hands and with your)

Show me
Come show me
With your hands and with your hands 
And with your hands and with your hands
I want you to

Touch me
Feel me (feel me)
Get to know me (know me)
Inside (inside, ooh)
If you love me, show me (show me)

Touch me
Feel me
Get to know me inside
If you love me, show me
