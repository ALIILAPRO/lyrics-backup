		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I ride all alone and can't see The road to nowhere anymore And
Shadows whispers are calling me To forbidden forrests by the
Shore And there she fell deep in the night One breath away from
Heaven's light And she said- don't cry for me, I'm leaving you 

The wind cries her name in the breeze But I can't hold her
Anymore Some fallen angel had come to me And fell to heavy on my
Soul And stole from me the love that I heard Lords of time say
Never die And said- don't cry for me, cause I'll be Riding the

Wind forever free High in the wind forever free I'll ride the
Wind forever free High in the wind forever free Forever free 
Forever in my hearts afire, a fire burning I wake up nights and
Hear her crying, crying my name  Riding the wind forever free

High in the wind forever free I ride the wind forever free High
In the wind forever free Forever free
