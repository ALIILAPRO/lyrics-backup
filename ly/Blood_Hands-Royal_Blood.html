		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Took a lonely feeling
Just to let the meaning sink
Like the sun goes down
Never close to heaven
Felt my feet were burning
From the same red hot ground

There's blood on my hands
There's blood on my hands
Yeah, there's blood

It's getting hard to listen
When the clock is ticking
Counting down the days gone by
Praying for an answer to another question
That will only leave you dry

You won't understand
With your head in the sand
No, you won't

But I'll kiss the ground where you kneel
'Til I grow my hair to my heels
Spike your water, your wine
While you waste my precious time

Every time I drink and try to stop my thinkin'
'Bout the things I've said and done
Stop the world from turning faster
Then I'm learning not to just hide and run

You won't understand
With your head in the sand
No, you won't, yeah

Love came and went faster
Than a penny spent in a slot machine
Nowhere near the devil
Just somewhere in between you and me
Sworn to secrecy 

And I'll kiss the ground where you kneel
'Til I grow my hair to my heels
Spike your water, your wine

There's blood on my hands
There's blood on my hands
There's blood on my hands
There's blood on my hands
Yeah, there's blood

There's blood on my hands
Yeah, there's blood

Took a lonely feeling
Just to let the meaning sink
Like the sun goes down
Never close to heaven
Felt my feet were burning
From the same red hot ground
