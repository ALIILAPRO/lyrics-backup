		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Pulling back the curtain to reveal
Nothing much at all
Just a tortoise burrowed in my machine
While above, my family shrieks
But I barely hear anything

In my theatre of cruelty
This obsession is going to ruin me
In my theatre of cruelty
In my theatre of cruelty
The light is all that I can see
In my theatre of cruelty

We crawl towards a desperate dream
Who even knows what's up there for me
But there's nothing that can stop the bleed
Deep inside my soil unseen
You can't put back the data leak

Just open up the faucet
Let the people scream
Open up the windows
And let the people see
Open up the faucet
Let the people scream
Just open up the windows
And let the people see

My theatre of cruelty
This obsession is going to ruin me
In my theatre of cruelty
In my theatre of cruelty
The light is all that I can see
In my theatre of cruelty

Let them see
What's in me
Let them see
What's in me

Laugh now
Die later
It's all
Good theatre
Laugh now
Die later
It's all
Good theatre

Laugh now
Die later
You're part of something greater
Laugh now
Die later
It's all
Good theatre
Laugh now
Die later
You're part of something greater
