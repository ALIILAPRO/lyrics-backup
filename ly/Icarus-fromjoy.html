		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Thoughts that swell like crashing waves
Drowning in the guilt of my wasted days
With a lack of patience, I keep turning pages
So I run, only to get burnt by the sun

(I want to break this cycle, because I don't want to waste this cycle. I know there's Something more than the indifference and the apathy, and everything else is less than Common sense and empathy
Where can I find the balance? I can stay suspended, and observe these thoughts, that Clash like waves, and ride, instead of drowning in it; because I'm tired of the hurricane And casting stones into lakes, and ripples becoming waves, that turn the sands into mud And hinder me from running towards the sun)

The malice peals off of the skin, like scabs, cysts of nihilist shreaks
Webbing, it runs down the flesh, spreading, as the broken host begins to speak

So I'll break these walls, and burn down the foundation
Rediscover my heart, this blindness was a manifestation
The truth is I am weak, I'm not as strong as I want to be
And my honesty may have meant nothing to you, but it set me free

No
I am no longer bound to the indignation that held me down
And to no king I bow
These chains are severed, I'm free, forever
