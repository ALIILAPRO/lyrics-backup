		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The lightning climbing up the walls
The finger drawings on the glass
The map of those who used to live here
Until the gilded hand was broken

Often there's a voice in my sleeping mind
The words inside my skull at night
But once I wake, I cannot read them
My bloody hands remain a question mark

Sifting through the hiccups of time
We'll hide in the bones of the city
The engines sing along with their cries
This song, it spells disaster
But it's buried beneath the laughter

The words that fall from out their mouths
Can change in your hands and split the skin
So I will keep myself apart
From shining eyes and privileged boredom

The thing that I've learned
From unusual blood
Is never touch a person's comfort
The voice of change is often heard
But fear it'self has come to visit

Sifting through the hiccups of time
We'll hide in the bones of the city
The engines sing along with their cries
This song, it spells disaster
But we drown it out with laughter

And our eyes
They were always pointed at the
Sky looking for an answer
And our hands
They were stained in black and
Grey busy solving problems
And our backs all bear the load of all the
Things we'll never know until it breaks us
And in the comfort of the Earth we
Will not wonder what we're worth
No, we will sleep soundly
All along the Road to Nowhere
