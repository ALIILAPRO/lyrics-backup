		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My minds, they fight, all night
And I wake up exhausted
Held hostage, can't stop it
Now I hear bells

One more round, I've lost count

I'ma, I'ma, I'ma in a death match
Up against myself and I won't last, 'cause she knows me well
Yeah, she hits back, where it hurts like hell
Only one of us is getting out of this alive
It's a death match
Up against myself and I won't last, 'cause she knows me well
Yeah, she hits back, where it hurts like hell
Only one of us is getting out of this alive

Every time I try to reason, she don't listen to a goddamn thing
When you're dealing with a demon, it ain't over 'til you kill the queen
She know the move I'm about to make
'Cause she in my head and she's there to stay, ay

One more round, I've lost count

I'ma, I'ma, I'ma in a death match
Up against myself and I won't last, 'cause she knows me well
Yeah, she hits back, where it hurts like hell
Only one of us is getting out of this alive
It's a death match
Up against myself and I won't last, 'cause she knows me well
Yeah, she hits back, where it hurts like hell
Only one of us is getting out of this alive

Wish I could rip her from me
She's like a fuckin' disease
No way of runnin' when I'm runnin' from the villain in me
Take all the pills I can get
But she ain't going anywhere
(I'ma, I'ma)
(I'ma, I'ma)
(I'ma, I'ma)
(I'ma, I'ma)
(I'ma, I'ma)
(I'ma, I'ma)

I'ma, I'ma, I'ma in a death match
Up against myself and I won't last, 'cause she knows me well
Yeah, she hits back, where it hurts like hell
Only one of us is getting out of this alive
It's a death match
Up against myself and I won't last, 'cause she knows me well
Yeah, she hits back, where it hurts like hell
Only one of us is getting out of this alive
