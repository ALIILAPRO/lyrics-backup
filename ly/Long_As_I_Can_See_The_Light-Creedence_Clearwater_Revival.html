		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Put a candle in the window 
'Cause I feel I've gotta move
Though I'm goin', goin' 
I'll be comin' home soon 
Long as I can see the light

Pack my bag and let's get moving 
'Cause I'm bound to drift awhile
Though I'm gone, gone 
You don't have to worry, no 
Long as I can see the light

Guess I've got that old travelin' bone 
'Cause this feeling won't leave me alone
But I won't, I won't 
Be losin' my way, no, no 
Long as I can see the light

Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Oh yeah

Put a candle in the window 
'Cause I feel I've gotta move 
Though I'm goin', goin' 
I'll be comin' home soon 
Long as I can see the light
Long as I can see the light
Long as I can see the light
Long as I can see the light
Long as I can see the light
