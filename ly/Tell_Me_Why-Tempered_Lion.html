		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Feel no shame about shape, weather changes their phrase
Even mother will show you another way
So put your glasses on, nothing will be wrong
There's no blame, there's no fame, it's up to you

The first words should be finded
Whatever holds you back
I can
I can get it off

Tell me what, tell me what, tell me what you want
I don't know why, don't know why, don't know why you afraid
Tell me what, tell me what, tell me what you say
I don't know why, don't know why, too late, it's too late

Have no fear for real, it's just a turning wheel
Once you start up there's no other way
Don't put your eyes on boots, step forward your roots
There's no aid, there's no trade, it belongs to you

Before you miss something given
You should know what's the truth
I can
I can make it out

Tell me what, tell me what, tell me what you want
I don't know why, don't know why, don't know why you afraid
Tell me what, tell me what, tell me what you say
I don't know why, don't know why, too late, it's too late

Before you miss something given
You should know what's the truth
I can, I can make it out

Tell me what, tell me what, tell me what you want
I don't know why, don't know why, don't know why you afraid
Tell me what, tell me what, tell me what you say
I don't know why, don't know why, too late, it's too late
Tell me what, tell me what, tell me what you want
I don't know why, don't know why, don't know why you afraid
Tell me what, tell me what, tell me what you say
I don't know why, don't know why, too late, it's too late
