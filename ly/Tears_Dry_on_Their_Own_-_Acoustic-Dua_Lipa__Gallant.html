		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All I can ever be to you
Is the darkness that we knew
And this regret I've got accustomed to

Once it was so right
When we were at our high
Waiting for you in the hotel at night

And knew I hadn't met my match
But every moment we could snatch
I don't know why I got so attached

It's my responsibility
And you don't owe nothing to me
But to walk away I have no capacity

He walks away
The sun goes down
He takes the day
But I'm grown

And in your way
In this blue shade
My tears dry on their own

I don't understand
Why do I stress a man
When there's so many bigger things at hand

We coulda never had it all
We had to hit a wall
So this is inevitable withdrawal

Even if I stop wanting you
A perspective pushes through
I'll be some next man's other woman soon

I can't play myself again
I should just be my own best friend

Not fuck myself in the head with stupid men

She walks away
The sun goes down
She takes the day
But I'm grown

And in your way
In this blue shade
My tears dry on their own

So we are history
Your shadow covers me
The sky above
A blaze

I could say no regrets
And no emotional debts
'Cause as we kiss goodbye the sun sets

So we are history
The shadow covers me
The sky above
A blaze that only lovers see

He walks away
The sun goes down
He takes the day
But I'm grown

And in your way
And this blue shade
My tears dry on their own

He walks away
The sun goes down

She takes the day
But I'm grown

And in your way
My deep shade
My tears dry on their own
My tears dry on their own
