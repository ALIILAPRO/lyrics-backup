		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've never seen you before
But I know what you're thinkin'
You got a knife in your back
And your witches are sinkin'

Trampoline
You're on my mind

I've never seen you before
But I know what you're feelin'
You're running under the ground
And you're hittin' the ceilin'

Trampoline
You're on my mind

I've never seen you before
But I know what you're thinkin'
You got a knife in your back
And your witches are sinkin'
Yes they're sinkin'!

Trampoline
You're on my mind
