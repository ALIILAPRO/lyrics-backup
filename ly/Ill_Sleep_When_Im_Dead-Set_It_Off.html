		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's the same each and every night
Glare at my screen with two big bloodshot eyes

I'm stuck, self-torturing
My meds are failing me
Internal clock in smithereens
Can't fix this, I'm hopeless

My eyes are stapled open wide
As I lay down on my side
I am bouncing off these walls

Notice my hands begin to twitch
Unprovoked assaulting of my conscious wit

Me and the TV are enemies
Sickening static surrounds my mind
I'm loosing time, and realizing
That after days of thought
That I'm stuck, self-torturing
My meds are failing me
Internal clock in smithereens
Can't fix this, I'm hopeless

My eyes are stapled open wide
As I lay down on my side
I am bouncing off these walls
As I focus on the clock
Time stands still but I cannot
I should strap myself in bed
I guess I'll sleep when I am dead

Talk to myself
Lie in the darkness, so content
As the sun begins to rise
I can barely shut my eyes

This crazed, delirious mess
Laughing at everything I see
My sanity is spent
Just tell me where my time went
I'm loosing it!

Attention:
All insomniacs,
Please raise your right hand
And kindly repeat after me
I guess I'll sleep when I am dead!

'Cause I'm stuck, self-torturing
My meds are failing me
Internal clock in smithereens
Can't fix this, I'm hopeless

My eyes are stapled open wide
As I lay down on my side (my side)
I am bouncing off these walls (I am bouncing off these walls)
As I focus on the clock
Time stands still but I cannot (time stands still)
I should strap myself in bed
I guess I'll sleep when I am dead

I guess I'll sleep when I am
