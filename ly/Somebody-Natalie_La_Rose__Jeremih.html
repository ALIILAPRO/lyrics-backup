		  Come on
Natalie la Rose

I wanna rock with somebody (woah yeah)
I wanna take shot with somebody (shot, shot, shot, shot)
I wanna leave with somebody (somebody, c'mon, c'mon)
And we ain't gonna tell nobody
We ain't gonna tell nobody

Walking everybody knows what's good
But some gonna hate what's new
We just do our favorite time to waste
Always playing cool

And at the end of the night
When our love's going out we turn down
Oh no we won't (we'll never turn it down, we'll never turn it down)
And when it try to make this leave we turn to say we never going home

And you know just what I wanna do

I wanna rock with somebody (woah yeah)
I wanna take shot with somebody (shot, shot, shot, shot)
I wanna leave with somebody (somebody, c'mon, c'mon)
And we ain't gonna tell nobody
We ain't gonna tell nobody

Walking everybody know what's good
We are only block
Bring us everything we think we need
Tonight is going up (tonight is going up)

And at the end of the night
When our love's going out we turn down
Oh no we won't (we'll never turn it down, we'll never turn it down)
And when it try to make this leave we turn to say we never going home

I wanna rock with somebody (woah yeah)
I wanna take shot with somebody (shot, shot, shot, shot)
I wanna leave with somebody (somebody, c'mon, c'mon)
And we ain't gonna tell nobody
We ain't gonna tell nobody

And the club like woah
We'll be in the party in the club like woah
And the club like
We'll be in the city going down like woah
And the club like woah
We'll be in the party in the club like woah
We'll be in the city going down like woah
We'll be in the party in the club like woah

And at the end of the night
When our love's going out we turn down
Oh no we won't (we'll never turn it down, we'll never turn it down)
And when it try to make this leave we turn to say we never going home

I wanna rock with somebody (woah yeah)
I wanna take shot with somebody (shot, shot, shot, shot)
I wanna leave with somebody (somebody, c'mon, c'mon)
And we ain't gonna tell nobody
We ain't gonna tell nobody
