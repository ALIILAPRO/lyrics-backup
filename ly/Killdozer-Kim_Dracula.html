		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They really fucked me over
Like they really fucked me over
So now I've got the other people
Telling me that they wanna repossess my car
And, you know, I just had to say to them
Look, I'm sorry, but I don't drive a car
I drive a mother fuckin' army tank 
(Vroom-vroom, k-k, vroom-vroom)
Kim Dracula (vroom-vroom))
I drive a mother fuckin' army tank 
(Vroom-vroom, k-k, vroom-vroom)
Killdozer (vroom-vroom)
They find a body when I put em in a tiger party, fuckin' opportune
Go side to side
I wanna see you on a bag of ice with a half a tooth
Get with my guns, I'll demolish your funds
I'll put all of your children through poverty too
Give me no love, and I'll show you no love
And I'll fuck around 'til your pale face blue
(Â¡Ay, caramba!) She's like a fine wine
Gotta give me the fun-fun and then I'll feel fine
I'm talkin' 'bout vengeance, I'm talkin' 'bout you
Chiminey-chim-chim-chiminey-chimeroo

A-B-C-D
Don't you fucking mess with me
Army tank (vroom-vroom, k-k, vroom -room)
Kim Dracula (vroom-vroom)
I drive a mother fuckin' army tank 
(Vroom-vroom, k-k, vroom-vroom)
Killdozer (vroom-vroom)
I drive a mother fuckin' army tank 
(Vroom-vroom, k-k, vroom-vroom)
Kim Dracula (vroom-vroom)
I drive a mother fuckin' army tank 
(Vroom-vroom, k-k, vroom-vroom)
Killdozer (vroom-vroom)

I was always willing to be reasonable
Until I had to be unreasonable
Sometimes reasonable men must do unreasonable things

Yeah

I drive a motherfuckin' army tank (army tank)
I drive a motherfuckin' army tank (army tank)
I drive a motherfuckin' army tank (army tank)
I drive a motherfuckin' army tank (army tank, army tank)
