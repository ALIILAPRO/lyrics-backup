		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Get up
Get up 
Like this
Just like this, do ya feel it? 
Then get up 
Just like this

Do you want to catch the vibe that's keepin' me alive? 
I'm following these phat ass beats until I die 
Fill 'em with tension, the sick dimension 
I rumble the earth with my lowered suspension 

Just watch the ground move 
Let the sound prove 
That it ain't fake when the girls get naked 
Don't call it a comeback 

We bring that beat back 
And we made sure that John kept them beats phat 
A lyrical rampage burnin' you headset 
Open your mind 
My rhymes ain't dead yet 
I want you to stand up and put them hands up 
I'll break it on down 
'Cause your pumpin' my band up? Like this? 

Just like this come on, get up
get up, get up, get up

Music is key 
It's the way we're set free 
From all this world 
Is throwing at me 

The rhythms so insane 
It's flowin' through your vein 
Triggerin' that neck poppin' a nerve up in your brain 
I don't even know ya 
But came to show ya 
That bizkit's limp when the night is over 
We shake the whole place 
Make this earthquake 
And it ain't fake 
When we start the riots 
So rock the bells 
Psycho females 
Doin' time blowin' up the phone line 
Call it a stampede 
Comin' to your town 
We ain't gonna hold back 
We're comin' to get down 
I want you to stand up 
And put them hands up and break it on down 
'Cause your pumpin' up my band, like this?

Just like this, get higher, come on, get up 

Music is key 
It's the way we're set free 
From all this world is throwing at me 
And I'll do what it takes 

If I make some mistakes 
It's okay 
'Cause its all 
Just the way 
It should be 

Limp Bizkit's in the house y'all 
Limp Bizkit's in the house y'all
Limp Bizkit's in the house y'all
Yo John, bring that beat back! 

Uh
Just like this 
do you feel it? 
Just like this 
Yo bring that beat back 

Music is key 
It's the way we're set free 
from all this world is throwing at me 
And I'll do what it takes 
If I make some mistakes 
It's ok 
'Cause it's all 
Just the way 
It should be
