		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We ran through the bright Tokyo lights, nothing to lose
Summer of 2012, burnt in my mind
High, crazy, and drunk, five in a room
Singing our hearts out to Carly, sweat in our eyes

Throwing drinks at each other
Making fun of our lovers
Getting kicked out on the street, oh
We were best friends forever, but the truth is

I'm so good at crashing in
Making sparks and shit but then
I'm a bad, I'm a bad, I'm a bad friend
So don't ask me where I've been
Been avoiding everything
'Cause I'm a bad, I'm a bad, I'm a bad friend

I'm a bad friend, yeah, yeah

Guess we fell out, what was that all about?
Maybe I overreacted, well maybe you shouldn't have
God it's insane how things can change like that
Don't even know where you are
What you do, and who you do it with

Throwing drinks at each other
Making fun of our lovers
Getting kicked out on the street, oh
We were best friends forever, but the truth is

I'm so good at crashing in
Making sparks and shit but then
I'm a bad, I'm a bad, I'm a bad friend
So don't ask me where I've been
Been avoiding everything
'Cause I'm a bad, I'm a bad, I'm a bad (friend)

Put your hands up if you're not good at this stuff
Put your hands up if you're not good at this stuff
I'm a bad friend, oh yeah
Put your hands up if you're not good at this stuff
Maybe I'm a bad friend

I'm so good at crashing in
Making sparks and shit but then
I'm a bad, I'm a bad, I'm a bad friend
So don't ask me where I've been
Been avoiding everything
'Cause I'm a bad, I'm a bad, I'm a bad (friend)

I'm so good at crashing in
Making sparks and shit but then
I'm a bad, I'm a bad, I'm a bad friend
So don't ask me where I've been
Been avoiding everything
'Cause I'm a bad, I'm a bad, I'm a bad friend
