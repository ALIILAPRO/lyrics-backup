		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Why can't you do it?
Why can't you set your monkey free?
Always giving into it
Do you love your monkey or do you love me?

Why can't you do it?
Why do I have to share my baby with a monkey?
(Monkey, monkey, monkey, yeah, y-yeah)

Oh, I count to ten
But I don't know how, and I don't know when to open my eyes

Baby, if you kiss me again
Like you did just now, like you did just then (then, then, then)
Just, just, just (do it again)

I've had the rest
Now it's time I had the best
So you tell me that you won't do anymore

Well, I'd write your heart a letter
But I think you know me better
If I keep on asking baby, maybe I'll get what I'm asking for

Why can't you do it?
Why can't you set your monkey free?
Always giving in to it
Do you love your monkey or do you love me?

Why can't you do it?
Why do I have to share my baby with a monkey?
(Monkey, with a monkey, monkey, yeah, y-yeah)

Oh, I hate your friends
But I don't know how and I don't know when to open your eyes
Yes, your monkey's back again
Do you want him now like you did back then? (back then, back then)
(D-do it again)

I tried my best but your head is such a mess
So I guess that I don't want you anymore
Well you say you care about me, that you just can't do without me
But you keep on dancin' baby 'til that monkey has you on the floor

Why can't you do it?
Why can't you set your monkey free?
Always giving into it
Do you love the monkey or do you love me?

Why can't you do it?
Why do I have to share my baby with a monkey?
(Monkey, with a monkey, monkey, yeah, y-yeah)

(Monkey, monkey-monkey)
(Monkey, monkey-monkey)
(Monkey, monkey-monkey)
(Monkey, monkey-m-m-m-monkey)

Don't look now, there's a monkey on your back
Don't look now there's a monkey on you
Don't look now there's a monkey on your back
Don't look now there's a monkey on you

So you tell me that you won't do anymore
If I keep on askin' baby, maybe I'll get what I'm askin' for

Why can't you do it?
Why can't you set your monkey free?
Always giving into it
Do you love the monkey or do you love me?

Why can't you do it?
Why do I have to share my baby with a monkey?
(Monkey, with a monkey, monkey, yeah, y-yeah)

Why can't you do it?
Why can't you set your monkey free?
Always giving into it
Do you love the monkey or do you love me?

Why can't you do it?
Why do I have to share my baby with a monkey?
(Monkey, with a monkey, monkey, yeah, y-yeah)

(Monkey, monkey-monkey)
(Monkey, monkey-monkey)
(Monkey, monkey-monkey)
(Monkey, monkey-m-m-m-monkey)
