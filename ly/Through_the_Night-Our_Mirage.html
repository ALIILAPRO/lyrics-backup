		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  For a thousand times I said
that your future lies ahead
but you crawled inside your shelter playing dead

So will you scream my name?
when you know you’ve lost the game
to the darkness beneath
and the air that we breathe
is wearing thin but i see the light
so why can’t you make it through the night?

I gave you everything I had
It’s not that hard to understand
that I’m here to help so take my hand!
Your eyes are brighter than the light
so why can’t you make it through the night?
so keep your head up high, because the stars are in sight

so keep your head up high
because the,
because the stars are in sight
Why can’t you make it?
Why can’t you make it?

you want to live like you lived back then
but first you need to find yourself again
’cause all you see
is yourself and not me
I’m here to help so

So will you scream my name?
when you know you’ve lost the game
to the darkness beneath
and the air that we breathe
is wearing thin but i see the light
so why can’t you..
so why can’t you make it through the night?

I gave you everything I had
It’s not that hard to understand
that I’m here to help so take my hand!
Your eyes are brighter than the light
so why can’t you make it through the night?
so keep your head up, because the stars are in sight

let me bring this to an end
that you can see yourself again
reach out for the stars
that lie beneath those scars

solace
I know you crave for solace
hopeless
I know that you are hopeless
hopeless
solace
I know you crave for solace
hopeless
I know that you are hopeless
hopeless

I gave you everything I had
It’s not that hard to understand
that I’m here to help so take my hand!
Your eyes are brighter than the light
so why can’t you make it through the night?
so keep your head up, because the stars are in sight
