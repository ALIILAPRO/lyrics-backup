		  Ayy, supercalifragilisticexpialiexpiali-dope shit
Supercalifragilic-, my ex be on some hoe shit
Superman, I get dem bands but ain't gon' buy you roses
Super-duper get them cougars, took my wrist and froze it
Super-duper hoes, y'all got Oompa Loompa hoes

Nah, nah, nah, nah, you mean like, like, Tracy with the ass?

Hit her five times in the coupe, Mercedes, whoopsie dai-, yeah
Oops, baby

Sippin' on the Goose, like Boosie, baby

Oops, my fault
I fuck and send her home, I don't let her wipe off
Fuck and send her home, walk in front and might fall
I forgot the rubber, oops, livin' life raw
I'm about to nut, oops, in her eye ball
Now she got the number, bitch feeling like bae
I just said I love her, oops, what did I say?
Now she want kids, want kids in her face, oops
Oops, my b, excuse my v
And you already know I'm finna lose my peace
Get pool like deep, get loose like leaf
Can't lose my sleep, kick up my feet like I blew my knee

Oops, I did it again, Britney
Oops, I did it again, Britney

Yeah, I'm bustin' on yo mama look like frosted Mini Wheats
And I'm happy she's a freak bitch

It's the return of the motherfuckin' mack
And I stay with the pack, though
Clap, clap, then I'm out the backdoor
Lil' Pillsbury, I stack dough
Walkin' with a limp like a crack ho

Never knew that was your boo, baby
Hit her five times in the coupe, Mercedes, whoopsie dai-, yeah

Sippin' on the Goose, like Boosie, baby
