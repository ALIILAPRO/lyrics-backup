		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Once upon a time, there was a little black girl
In the Brewster Projects of Detroit, Michigan
At fifteen, she was spotted by an Ebony Fashion Fair talent scout 
And her modeling career took off
You better work

You better work
(Cover girl)
Work it, girl
(Give a twirl)
Do your thing on the runway

Work
(Supermodel)
You better work it girl
(Of the world)
Wet your lips and make love to the camera

Work
Turn to the left
Work
Now turn to the right
Work
Sashay, shantay

Work
Turn to the left
Work
Now turn to the right
Work
Sashay, shantay

It don't matter what you wear
It doesn't matter what you wear
They're checking out your savoir faire (ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah)
And it don't matter what you do
'Cause everything looks good on you
Supermodel

Work
(Cover girl)
Work it girl
(Give a twirl)
Do your thing on the runway

Work
(Supermodel)
You better work it, girl
(Of the world)
Wet your lips and make love to the camera

Work
Turn to the left
Work
Now turn to the right
Work
Sashay, shantay

Work
Turn to the left
Work
Now turn to the right
Work
Sashay, shantay

I see your picture everywhere
I see your picture everywhere
A million dollar derriere
And when you walked into the room
You had everybody's eyes on you, supermodel

Linda (work, mama)
Naomi (she is fierce)
Christy (foxy lady, out of sight)
Cindy (I can feel it)
Claudia (sell the garment)
Niki (work the runway, sweetie)

I have one thing to say, sashay, shantay
Shantay, shantay, shantay, shantay, shantay
I have one thing to say, sashay, shantay
Shantay, shantay, shantay, shantay, shantay, woo

It don't matter what you wear
It doesn't matter what you wear
They're checking out your savoir faire (ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah)
And it don't matter what you do
'Cause everything looks good on you
Supermodel

Work
(Cover girl)
Work it girl
(Give a twirl)
Do your thing on the runway

Work
(Supermodel)
You better work it, girl
(Of the world)
Wet your lips and make love to the camera

Work
Turn to the left
Work
Now turn to the right
Work
Sashay, shantay

Work
Turn to the left
Work
Now turn to the right
Work
Sashay, shantay

You better work
Work
Work
(Supermodel)

You better work
Work
Work

I have one thing to say
You better work
