		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, that boy so scandalous
Yeah he broke my girl's heart, and he was onto the next
He was cheating on the low in the club all night
Never seen my girl so messed up, yeah (yeah)
Out with his boys in the hip poppin' spot
She all alone wondering if he's coming home or not
For the whole damn year, I was wiping up and tears
He was livin' la vida loca

You know I'll be watchin' you
'Cause she the baddest thing to ever happen to ya
And that's the truth
Don't make me have to hurt ya
'Cause I know right now, we're cool
But if I ever hear you mess this up, I'm comin' after you

So don't you treat her wrong
Yeah, you better love a girl right, baby
'Cause you 'bout to lose her love
Said, I yeah, you better love a girl right (alright yeah)
'Cause you 'bout to lose her love, yeah
(Dun-du-dun, dun-dun)
(Dun-du-dun, dun-dun)
(Dun-du-dun, dun-dun)
You better love a girl right

I'll be there for my girl always
She mean the whole world to me
All she want is your love, yeah (no, no, no) (yeah)
She want better, she don't want a another-nother mistake
You better not risk it
'Cause in my eyes all I'm seeing is a queen
If you do it wrong, best believe
She'll be livin' la vida loca

You know I'll be watchin' you
'Cause she the baddest thing to ever happen to ya
And that's the truth
Don't make me have to hurt ya
'Cause I know right now, we're cool (right now, we're cool)
But if I ever hear you mess this up, I'm comin' after you

So don't you treat her wrong
Yeah, you better love a girl right, baby
'Cause you 'bout to lose her love
Said, I yeah, you better love a girl right (alright, yeah)
'Cause you 'bout to lose her love, yeah

Oh-oh, oh-oh, love her right
Oh-oh, oh-oh, she'll be gone tonight
Oh-oh, oh-oh, I don't wanna fight
One more chance, give me one more try

(Dun-du-dun, dun-dun) Hey yeah
(Dun-du-dun, dun-dun) No, oh woah
(Dun-du-dun, dun-dun) Eh, you, oh woah

So don't you treat her wrong
Yeah, you better love a girl right, baby (eh, eh)
'Cause you 'bout to lose her love
Said, I yeah, you better love a girl right (alright, yeah)
'Cause you 'bout to lose her love, yeah

You better love her (Dun-du-dun, dun-dun)
You better love her (Dun-du-dun, dun-dun)
Better love her right (Dun-du-dun, dun-dun)
No, no, no
