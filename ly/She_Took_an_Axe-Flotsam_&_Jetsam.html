		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A young maiden with a demon in her soul
A twisted mind with secrets to unfold
An innocent face, a deceiving smile
Under no suspicion, servant to Belial

The axe came down, blood all around

She lurks possessed, without a sound
Butchers her dam when no one is around
The next day her sire feels her wrath
She has no remorse in her merciless bloodbath

She's Miss Lizzy, she feels no pain
The axe came down
She's Miss Lizzy, she strikes again
The axe came down, blood all around

Lizzy Borden took an axe
Gave her mother forty whacks
When she saw what she had done
She gave her father forty one

Lizzy Borden took an axe
Gave her mother forty whacks
When she saw what she had done
She gave her father forty one

Lizzy Borden took an axe
Gave her mother forty whacks
When she saw what she had done
She gave her father forty one

Now before the jury with a solemn face
These legendary murders, she left not a trace
Lizzy found it so simple to take their lives
Today she walks free, axe by her side

She's Miss Lizzy, she feels no pain
The axe came down
She's Miss Lizzy, she strikes again
The axe came down, blood all around
She took an axe
