		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm sitting in a dark room wasted
c glass roof when I'd rather be jaded
With every single word I hate it
Spitting out sounds when I'd rather get faded
I'll do what the fuck I want 
Whenever I want
Cause all I've got is what I've got
It's what's I've got

I wanna be reckless
I wanna feel inside
Tell me what it's like to die
I wanna be reckless
Pass out on the floor
Go until I can't take more
Pretend that it's fine like I'll be alright
I wanna be I wanna be reckless
When all that I want is to feel alive
I wanna be I wanna be
I wanna be reckless

cnother night spent I'm hating
On every other thought I'm making
When every other thought I'm making 
Isn't much better than the last I'm thinking 
I'll do what the fuck I want 
Whenever I want
Cause all I've got is what I've got
It's what's I've got

I wanna be reckless
I wanna feel inside
Tell me what it's like to die
I wanna be reckless
Pass out on the floor
Go until I can't take more
Pretend that it's fine like I'll be alright
I wanna be I wanna be reckless
When all that I want is to feel alive
I wanna be I wanna be
I wanna be reckless

cll I wanna do is breathe
But now I'm gonna drown in another drink
It's like I can't even sleep
When I don't wanna live someone else's dreams
There's gotta be more
Than living and dying and taxes and porn
There's gotta be more
Tell me there's gotta be more

I wanna be reckless
I wanna feel inside
Tell me what it's like to die
I wanna be reckless
Pass out on the floor
Go until I can't take more
Pretend that it's fine like I'll be alright
I wanna be I wanna be reckless
When all that I want is to feel alive
I wanna be I wanna be
I wanna be reckless
