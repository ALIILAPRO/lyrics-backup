		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Goin' back to Honolulu just to get that 
That Maui Wowie, that Maui Wowie
Goin' back to Honolulu just to get that 
That Maui Wowie, that Maui Wowie
And I'm so high and I'm so high
And I'm so high and I'm so high
And I'm so high and I'm so high
And I'm so high and I'm so high

Yeah, back up in the mix 
Aloha, nigga, Cudi lookin' for a fix
Got enough dough just to take a trip
To get a little pinch of that Maui Wowie
Ah man, here we go again
If you ever get a chance, smoke it with a friend
Me and Pat on a mission to get 
Lifted like John Legend and shit
Get lifted, let's get lifted
What you gon' cop?
Maybe a dub, maybe a zone
No matter what you cop you should smoke it 'til it's gone
Walkin' on the beach with the sand between ya feet
And all the Hawaiian girls sing to the beat
Hey, what it do, boo?
You smoke good? Yeah, me too
Livin' in paradise all through the night
And even in the day, smoke it 'til I can't see
What can I say? Nothin' like this in the world, homie
Make you feel great
You forget you in the States, might relocate
So you can smoke all the Maui Wowie, you can take it like

Goin' back to Honolulu just to get that 
That Maui Wowie, that Maui Wowie
Goin' back to Honolulu just to get that 
That Maui Wowie, that Maui Wowie
And I'm so high and I'm so high
And I'm so high and I'm so high
And I'm so high and I'm so high
And I'm so high (uh, uh) and I'm so high

I know, I know, I know
I really need to go, go, go, go, go, go
Really need to go, go
Really need to go, go, go
Man, I need Maui Wowie
I smoke that Maui Wowie
I need Maui Wowie
I smoke that Maui Wowie
I know, I know, I know
You really need to go, go
Really need to go, go, go, man
I need Maui Wowie
I smoke that Maui Wowie
