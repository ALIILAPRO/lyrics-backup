		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No Brasil a gente fala assim
A gente gosta assim
A gente mexe assim
Mas na verdade vou dizer a ti
Sou brasileira assim
Americana assim

Say, can you fly my way
I can drink enough to pay
Won't satisfy my taste
Hey

Lot of love in the city got me feeling hella' buzzed
If you wanna try to find a way to get into the function we could run it up
The truth is I'm on a tight rope with my eyes closed got fifty-fifty on my right toe
Not a lot of worries for bright a soul
I ain't in the city with the white snow, that's white smoke
Brasileira with a right flow
Caught a rhythm from the maestro
Put the image up and let the lights strobe
Prrr

Say, can you fly my way
I can drink enough to pay
Won't satisfy my taste
Hey

No Brasil a gente fala assim
A gente gosta assim
A gente mexe assim

Say you wanna get away
Meet me on another plane
'Cause when you speak to me
It's Greek to me, so
Baby let me set the stage

Say, can you fly my way
I can drink enough to pay
Won't satisfy my taste
Hey
Say, can you fly my way (can you fly my way)
I can drink enough to pay
Won't satisfy my taste
Hey

Dime Mirella qué pasa
You got a flow with the bossa
I put it on for my casa, mhh
Linda camina descalza
Pasémosla rico junticos
Suave, dulce, dame piquitos
Listo
?

Pois se faz assim na America
Pois se hace así en America
Said it goes like this in America
Aight we good
