		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You know you're pushing your luck
Sitting on the corner here
Oh, whether you'll go up or down is unclear
And you tell your friends it's just a phase
Just something you're going through
And you tell yourself it's all okay
Just something you needed to do

And you woke up from a dream
(You woke up from a dream)
You wish you were in all the time
(You wished you were in all the time)
For a moment you were free
(For a moment you were free)
Somewhere in your mind
(Somewhere in your mind)

I'll be wandering
Just keep me wandering
I'll be wandering
Just keep me wandering

You're going backwards again
Running down the road here
Trapped between the choices and the idea
And you thought that you were on your way
Thought you were going home
And you tell yourself it's all okay
Just some place you needed to go

And you woke up from a dream
(You woke up from a dream)
You wish you were in all the time
(You wished you were in all the time)
For a moment you were free
(For a moment you were free)
Somewhere in your mind
(Somewhere in your mind)

I'll be wondering
Just keep me wondering
I'll be wondering
Just keep me wondering

I'll be there, half the time I'm there
You'll be there, half the time I'm there
