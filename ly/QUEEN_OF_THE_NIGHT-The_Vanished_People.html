		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Another night spent staring at my ceiling for the hundredth time
I never understood why you come this late just to mess with my mind
Guide me
With your
Soothing voice and when you'll whisper "trust me"
I will
Black out once again
Take on the night
Take on the night
Take on the night
And also take me with you
Sky is at your will as
Stars bow down before the moon
Queen of the night
Queen of the night
Queen of the night
You drag me away with your gloom
You poisoned me so much now I'm immune
Hide! Hide! Hide!
Fight! Fight! Fight!
Rise! Rise! Rise!
How can you sleep so fine
Knowing the taste of a human heart
I can't get back to sleep if the dishwasher makes a sound at night
Guide me
With your
Soothing voice and when you'll whisper "trust me"
I will
Black out once again
Take on the night
Take on the night
Take on the night
And also take me with you
Sky is at your will as
Stars bow down before the moon
Queen of the night
Queen of the night
Queen of the night
You drag me away with your gloom
You poisoned me so much now I'm immune
Hide! Hide! Hide!
Fight! Fight! Fight!
Rise! Rise! Rise!
Take on the night
Take on the night
Take on the night
And also take me with you
Sky is at your will as
Stars bow down before the moon
Queen of the night
Queen of the night
Queen of the night
You drag me away with your gloom
You poisoned me so much now I'm immune
Rise! Rise! Rise!
