		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Ain't found a way to kill me yet
Eyes burn with stinging sweat
Seems every path leads me to nowhere
Wife and kids, household pet
Army green was no safe bet
The bullets scream to me from somewhere, mhm

Here they come to snuff the rooster, ah yeah
Yeah, here come the rooster, yeah
You know he ain't gonna die
No, no, no, ya know he ain't gonna die

Here they come to snuff the rooster, aww yeah, hey yeah
Yeah, here come the rooster, yeah
You know he ain't gonna die
No, no, no, you know he ain't gonna die

Walkin' tall machine gun man
They spit on me in my homeland
Gloria sent me pictures of my boy
Got my pills 'gainst mosquito death
My buddy's breathin' his dyin' breath
Oh God, please, won't you help me make it through?

Here they come to snuff the rooster, ah yeah, yeah
Yeah, here come the rooster, yeah
You know he ain't gonna die
No, no, ya know he ain't gonna die

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
