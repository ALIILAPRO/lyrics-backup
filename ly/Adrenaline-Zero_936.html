		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All my life I've drowned in adrenaline
Now my blood runs slow like a sedative
I wake up past noon, and they settled in
Lord, please help me up, I don't wanna lay down
So help me get the fuck back up
I don't wanna lay down, down, down
Help me get myself back up
I don't wanna lay down

I feel the pain in my reflection, I
I wanna get away, so I just step inside
I feel more alone when I have extra eyes
Fucking staring at me, I wanna feel numb
Give me Novocain for everyone else
Sick of staying in a house, I need a home for myself
To be alone, I can tell that you don't know how I felt
I had to let go of you just to get a hold of myself because

All my life I've drowned in adrenaline

All my life I've drowned in adrenaline
Now my blood runs slow like a sedative
I wake up past noon and they settled in
Lord, please help me up, I don't wanna lay down
So help me get the fuck back up
I don't wanna lay down, down, down
Help me get myself back up
I don't wanna lay down

Life been giving me too many warnings
Couldn't get up outta bed in the morning
Sleep for twelve or be awake for twelve
I can't decide on which is even more important
Can't hold my head up, won't attempt to get up
I'm not even sure on why I'm fed up today
Swear it's no lie if I said that I'm fine
At the same time, it's false if I said I'm okay
And I don't need your sympathetic remarks
I'm different from where you shoot shots in the dark
Aiming for something you don't know is there
And hopin' you pinpoint when your target his heart
I don't mean to be rude but you never walked a single day in my shoes
You'll never gon' go know what it's like to be me
I won't act like I know what it's like to be you when I say

All my life I've drowned in adrenaline
Now my blood runs slow like a sedative
I wake up past noon and they settled in
Lord, please help me up, I don't wanna lay down
So help me get the fuck back up
I don't wanna lay down, down, down
Help me get myself back up
I don't wanna lay down

All my life I've drowned in adrenaline
All my life I've drowned in adrenaline
All my life I've drowned in adrenaline
Now my blood runs slow like a sedative
I wake up past noon, and they settled in
Lord, please help me up, I don't wanna lay down
So help me get the fuck

All my life I've drowned in adrenaline
Now my blood runs slow like a sedative
I wake up past noon and they settled in
Lord, please help me up, I don't wanna lay down
So help me get the fuck back up
I don't wanna lay down, down, down
Help me get myself back up
I don't wanna lay down
