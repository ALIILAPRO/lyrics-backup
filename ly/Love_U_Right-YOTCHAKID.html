		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Before, before I met you little one I had lost hope,
and I was loosing ground
But you showed up,
and made me somebody
And for Love
I made a promise to be here And you showed me nothing but kindness
Never second guess
that you want me here
Cause I'm going to love you right
Cause I'm going to love you right.
Oh, oh-oh Oh,
And for Love
I made a promise to be here (here)
And you showed me
nothing but kindness (You showed me love) Never second guess
that you want me here
Cause I'm going to love you right
Ohh
(Cause I'm going to love you right.)
Never second guess
that you want me here (You want me here)
Cause I'm going to love you right
Cause I'm going to love you right.
Oh, oh-oh Oh,
