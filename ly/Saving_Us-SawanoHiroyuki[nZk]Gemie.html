		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How could I have known that you
suddenly would change my life?
You turned my world upside down.
I'm so in love
Held me close to you
With your eyes you made me laugh
As all around
corridors and paper burn
Even though this
place is coming down
I am burning up with a desire
Nothing I can do
but listen more to
Your kind voice
'We'll make it through!'
Lost you in the crowd
As the doors they close
I make a vow
Gonna find a way
to be with you someday
All I know is you appeared
Pulled me free and rescued me
I'd given in.
Thought the smoke
would never clear
Held me in your arms
You spoke to me and I am fine
And we are here hoping
that you're saving us

Now we're still in love
I stay home everyday
Far to scared to take the call
When you're taken far away
And your boy is 9 this day
His father he waits for
Blowing candles out with
mom he hears the front door

All I know is you appeared
Can you see how I go on?
The risk you take
Can I do it anymore?
Held me in your arms
You spoke to me
and I am free and
We are here hoping
that you're saving us
Even though this
place is coming down
I am burning up with a desire
Nothing I can do
but listen more to
Your kind voice
'We'll make it through!'
Lost you in the crowd.
As the doors they close you
make me proud
Gonna find a way
to be with you someday
All I know is you appeared
Can you see how I go on?
The risk you take
Can I do it anymore?
Held me in your arms
You spoke to me
and I am fine and
We are here hoping
that you're saving us
