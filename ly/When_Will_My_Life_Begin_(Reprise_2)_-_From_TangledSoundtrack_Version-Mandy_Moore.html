		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Look at the world, so close, and I'm halfway to it
Look at it all, so big, do I even dare?
Look at me, there at last! 
I just have to do it

Should I?
No
Here I go

Just smell the grass, the dirt 
Just like I dreamed they'd be!
Just feel that summer breeze, the way it's calling me
For like the first time ever, I'm completely free!
I could go running
And racing
And dancing
And chasing
And leaping
And bounding
Hair flying
Heart pounding
And splashing
And reeling
And finally feeling
Now's when my life begins!
