		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't think twice
We're still in formation
Testing the current
Already I'm sailing, it's all so sudden
Catching a flight
You think we're moving too fast, I'm intoxicated
We can move in slow motion if that's what you want, babe

I don't want to come on too strong
But I'm moving to your rhythm

With every move, with every move you make, babe
Oh, I'm tumblin'

(What, what, what, what)
(What, what, what, what)

In your own time
Would you show me something please, babe?
Don't wanna wait in vain
You're the missing piece I, I been longing for
Don't deny, oh no
The temperature's rising inside
The cracks are showing
Show me all your colors, I may not deserve you

I don't want to come on too strong
But I'm moving to your rhythm

With every move, with every move you make, babe
Oh, I'm tumblin'

(What, what, what, what)
(What, what, what, what)
(What, what, what, what)
(What, what, what, what)
