		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When stars were fallen
When I felt broken
I will remember
You felt the same
When lost in mystery
When lost in wonder
I will remember
You felt the same

When I was lonely
When I was emptied
I will remember
You hurt the same
When I had chosen to love knowing just what it would cost
I will remember you loved the same

People are broken
But I will love them
And I will remember
You did the same
Through time and distance
Eternity came in the form of a babe
You chose to welcome them into your arms
And I'll do the same

You chose to welcome me into your arms
So I'll do the same
