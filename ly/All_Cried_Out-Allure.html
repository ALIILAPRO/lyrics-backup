		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All alone on a Sunday morning
Outside I see the rain is falling, whoa-oh
Inside I'm slowly dying
But the rain will hide my crying, crying, crying

And you
Don't you know my tears will burn the pillow?
Set this place on fire 'cause I'm tired of your lie
All I needed was a simple "hello"
But the traffic was so noisy that you could not hear me cry

(I) I gave you my love in vain
My body never knew such pleasure
My heart never knew such pain
And you, you leave me so confused
Now I'm all cried out, over you

Never wanted to see things your way
Had to go astray
Oh, why was I such a fool (why was I such a fool?)
Now I see that the grass is greener
Is it too late for me to find my way home
How could I be so wrong?
Leaving me all alone
(Don't you know my tears will cause an inferno?) (tears gonne 'cause an inferno, baby)
Romance of the flames, why should I take the blame? (why should, why should I?)
You were the one who left me neglected (I'm so sorry baby)
Apology not accepted, add me to the broken hearts you've collected
(I) I gave you all of me (gave you all of me)
How was I to know
You would weaken so easily?
(And I) I don't know what to do (I don't know what to do)
I'm all cried out (I'm all cried out)
Over you

(Na-na-na, na-na-na-na)
(Na-na-na, na-na-na-na)
(Na-na-na, na-na-na-na)

(I) I gave you my love in vain
My body never knew such pleasure
My heart never knew such pain
And you
You left me so confused
Now I'm all cried out (all cried out)
Now I'm all cried out (all cried out) 
(I'm so sorry, baby)
Over you
(Please forgive me, oh, oh, ooh)
(Please forgive me)
