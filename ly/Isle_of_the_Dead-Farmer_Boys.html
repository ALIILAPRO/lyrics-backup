		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Paint it all in black
Make it twisted and bizarre
Here on the isle of the dead
Where the survivors write the law

You're the constructors of our fears
And you create the excess
In your temples full of gold
You praise your wealth and your success

Take me away
From the Isle of the dead
Take me over the seas
Where death has no dominion anymore

I see the rivers full of blood
The truth is now a lie
You think that you became a god
But you're the blind leading the blind

Take me away
From the Isle of the dead
Take me over the seas
Where death has no dominion
Take me over the walls
Out of the valley of the damned
To the place that we once lost
Oh where death has no dominion

And all the dreamers
That sleep without a dream
All the music without a melody
But there will be a day
When you're wiping the tears from my eyes

Take me away
From the Isle of the dead
Take me over the seas
And where death has no dominion anymore
