		  Huh-huh, yo Mister D-O-Double-R

I say
Yea buddy!
Rollin' like a big shot
Chevy tuned up like a NASCAR pit stop
Fresh paint job (check)
Fresh inside (check)
Is the outside frame in the trunk wide? (Yes)
Are the rims big? (What)
Do it ride good? (Good)
Lean back right hand on the pinewood

Cream on the inside
Clean on the outside
Cream on the inside
Clean on the outside
Cream on the inside
Clean on the outside
Ice, ice cream, ice cream paint job

Cream on the inside
Clean on the outside
Cream on the inside
Clean on the outside
Cream on the inside
Clean on the outside
Ice, ice cream, ice cream paint job

Whoa!
Clean on the outside, cream on the inside, ice cream paint job (paint job)
Got screens on the dash, watchin' Saved By The Bell, got a house by the Bayside (Bayside)
Yea I'm livin' like that (like that), and I'm ridin' like that (like that)
Boy I'm ridin' like that and the stirring wheel wood like a baseball bat (like that)
Just like Archie said, we ready (ready)
Whole clique's straight, lunatics like Nelly (Nelly)
Gran Marquis paint job, grape jelly, R Triple BC, big black box Chevy (Chevy)
Crank my car (car), she be hummin' (hummin'), rims so big, you can see me comin' (comin')
Prime time clique (yeah), we get money (money), stay iced up like TV Johnny

Cream on the inside
Clean on the outside
Cream on the inside
Clean on the outside
Cream on the inside
Clean on the outside
Ice, ice cream, ice cream paint job

Cream on the inside
Clean on the outside
Cream on the inside
Clean on the outside
Cream on the inside
Clean on the outside
Ice, ice cream, ice cream paint job

I'm live (I'm live) like a Superbowl kickoff
My slab got a lot of niggas pissed off
Yeah paint shine like lip gloss, Cadillac got a wide body like Rick Ross
Took time but my cash got right
If I want it, I'mma buy it, I don't ask no price
Rearview mirror, jumbo dice
Trunk hit hard like Kimbo Slice
Be around tint, no window light
Car ride smooth so the rims on right
That right thurr, see, see I like
Got the top notch slab for the dirt-cheap price
Press one button, car automatic start
Stand too close, car alarm might bark (like what?)
A, ARGH, like Q-Dawgs
Prime Time Clique makin' moves like U-Haul

Cream on the inside
Clean on the outside
Cream on the inside
Clean on the outside
Cream on the inside
Clean on the outside
Ice, ice cream, ice cream paint job 

Cream on the inside
Clean on the outside
Cream on the inside
Clean on the outside
Cream on the inside
Clean on the outside
Ice, ice cream, ice cream paint job 

I ride with a towel 'cause the candy paint wet
Rims on the ride got these niggas upset 
Rims sitin' high so I ride upset 
6 12's in the trunk 4 screens in the deck

I ride with a towel 'cause the candy paint wet
Rims on the ride got these niggas upset 
Rims sitin' high so I ride upset 
6 12's in the trunk 4 screens in the deck

I ride, I ride, I ride, I ride, I ride, I ride, let's ride

I ride, propped up, I ride, propped up, I ride, say bro, let's ride, let's ride

I got a, fresh paint job, (check)
Fresh inside (check)
Is the outside frame in the trunk wide? (Yes) 
Are the rims big (what) do it ride good (good) 
Lean back right hand on the pinewood

Cream on the inside
Clean on the outside
Cream on the inside
Clean on the outside
Cream on the inside
Clean on the outside
Ice, ice cream, ice cream paint job 

Cream on the inside
Clean on the outside
Cream on the inside
Clean on the outside
Cream on the inside
Clean on the outside
Ice, ice cream, ice cream paint job
