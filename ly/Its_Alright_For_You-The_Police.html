		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wake up
Make up
Bring it up
Shake up
Stand by
Don't cry
Watching while the world die

Big car
Movie star
Hot tip
Go far
Blind date
Too late
Take a bus
Don't wait

It's alright for you
It's alright for you
It's alright for you
For you and you and you and you and you

It's alright for you
It's alright for you
It's alright for you
For you and you and you

Limp wrist
Tight fist
Contact
No twist
Black dress
No mess
People want no less, no less

Stand by
Don't cry
Watching while the world die
Three lane
Fast lane
Standing in the cold rain

It's alright for you
It's alright for you
It's alright for you
For you and you and you and you and you

It's alright for you
It's alright for you
It's alright for you
For you

Headlight
High life
Can't sleep
Good night
Up tight
Big fight
Big deal
Too right, too right

Big town
Don't drown
Jump back
Turn around
No life
Flick knife
Finish off my life

It's alright for you
It's alright for you
It's alright for you
For you and you and you and you and you

It's alright for you
It's alright for you
It's alright for you
For you
