		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I go you know you can't follow me into the darkness
Where I go you may not make it through the night
Only those who aren't afraid to lose it all
Are the ones who may make it out alive

Now I'm haunted by the ride
I'm haunted by my stride

Father forgive them though they do know what they do
The reason resides in the rise and the fall of these times
Death and destruction, well I heard it on the news
It's hard to know who to trust when these kings and these villains collide

Now I'm haunted by their lies
I'm haunted by their eyes

No man knows how sweet and dear the morning light can be til he's suffered from the night
No man grows til he tests his might against what his eyes can't see
Then he'll truly spot his foes and be haunted by the ride
Haunted by their eyes

When I go you know you can't follow me into the darkness
Where I go you may not make it through the night
Only those who aren't afraid to lose it all
Are the ones who may make it out alive
