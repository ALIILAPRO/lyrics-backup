		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We don't wanna be sober anymore
Let's get fucked up with those bitches and whores
We don't wanna be sober anymore
Let's get fucked up with those bitches and whores

Baby, let me be your bartender
Let's get fucked up that we can't remember last night
I'm alright when you're here with me
I'm alright when you're here with me

We are looking for some trouble tonight
We wanna party like a G6
Looking for those hot chicks
I said get out the way
I wanna rock the dance floor
I got the moves, you got the keys for the backdoor

Life is a party
Why are you so serious? We make you look ridiculous
Ladies get naughty
Gentlemen are in da club, sing along let's get fucked up

Baby, let me be your bartender
Let's get fucked up that we can't remember last night
I'm alright when you're here with me
I'm alright when you're here with me

Baby, let me be your bartender
Let's get fucked up that we can't remember last night
I'm alright when you're here with me
I'm alright when you're here with me

We break the girl's hearts still before we have a drink
We're smoking the last cigarette before your girlfriends show us pink
And you can't fuck with us
And you can't fuck with me
We are the new kids from the block and you're just cheesy

Life is a party
Why are you so serious? We make you look ridiculous
Ladies get naughty
Gentlemen are in da club, sing along let's get fucked up

Baby let me be your bartender
Let's get fucked up that we can't remember last night
I'm alright when you're here with me
I'm alright when you're here with me

Baby, let me be your bartender
Let's get fucked up that we can't remember last night
I'm alright when you're here with me
I'm alright when you're here with me

Let's get fucked up now, let's get fucked up now

Baby, let me be your bartender
Let's get fucked up that we can't remember last night
I'm alright when you're here with me
I'm alright with me
