		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's peng black girls in my area code 
Dark skin, light skin, medium tone 
Permed tings, braids, got minis afros 
Thick lips got hips some of us don't 
Big nose contour some of us won't
Never wanna put us in the media bro
Want a fat booty like Kardashians? (No)
Want a fat booty like my Aunty got yo
Wheel up the bloodclaat tell her reload it
I've got the camera my girls are posing
I need some back up then my ones are rolling 
Grown woman ting so I'm never at risk
Mind my own business so I'm never in mess
Who am I? I ain't bait, get a slice of the cake
Want a house with a view and a new pair of shoes
Keep it real from the jump, Gucci gang, Little Pump
Little vibe, little bass, little kick, little snare, little lies, big truths
Do you, they don't care
Do you, they don't care
Get your ass out the box and build up from there
I don't have a gang with me
But I still walk with a gangster lean
And rock Nike's 'cause we think they're clean 
Mj leather jacket, beat it Billie Jean
Mj leather jacket 'cause I think I'm bad 

That's cool, I like it
The growth, the light
The pain, the fight 
We love, we fight 
We hurt, we cry 
He paid the price 
You'll be alright 

I think I need some time away
I took a little time I prayed
We gon' be alright ok 
Alright ok, alright ok
I think I need some time away
I took a little time I prayed
We gon' be alright ok
Alright ok, alright ok, alright ok 

Enny said, there's peng black girls in our area codes
These black girls need to be in the shows
Be on the runways, not just moodboards
On top of that we gotta see them in your team
Look at your crown, natural, relaxed 
Had a Jerry curl one time, Soft n sheen 
Where black girl magic is sometimes blue 
Might of broke a hair band or two 
Raise my voice you gonna say that I'm angry 
Kiss my teeth and now you say that I'm hood 
Kid at sixteen, you say it's my destiny 
Drive a Range you think I'm up to no good 
Give us a break and let's us breath man 
Give us a chance, let us achieve fam
And I know that my hair looks a bit different today 
So don't touch my hair

Like new hair, who this
Old black bomber jacket and the Bantu twists 
Look mind over matter I can handle this 
We're fine took a second the rewards in risk 
See I think that I care too much 
Bottle of some Courvoisier, two cups 
I've got nothing to give but you love 
Check my flaws and all my trials 
I was black back when it wasn't even in style

That's cool, I like it
The growth, the light
The pain, the fight 
We love, we fight 
We hurt, we cry 
He paid the price 
You'll be alright 

I think I need some time away
I took a little time I prayed
We gon' be alright ok 
Alright ok, alright ok
I think I need some time away
I took a little time I prayed
We gon' be alright ok
Alright ok, alright ok, alright ok
