		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take me with you when you go
Take me with you when you go
Wherever you are is my home
So take me with you when you
Take me with you when you
Take me with you when you go ohh go ohh
Wherever you are is my home
Take me with you when you go

Time has come
Do we really have to say goodbye?
I’m holding on
Pretending that this isn’t our last night

But I know it is and I already miss the memories we won’t get to make
Your packing your bags now there’s no turning back
There’s only one thing left to say

Take me with you when you go
Take me with you when you go
Wherever you are is my home
So take me with you when you
Take me with you when you
Take me with you when you go ohh go oho
Wherever you are is my home
Take me with you when you go
