		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sitting in yesterday, watching it slip away today
Isolation
Fading like photographs, reminding us nothing ever lasts
Desolation
I look up to the sky but the sun never shines
I'm waiting

There's a thousand different shades of darkness
Coloring our faith
The past is dead, the future's haunted
What happened to today, today?

Promises built to crash
Walking on dreams and broken glass
Hell's creation
Try to find my escape
Somewhere where I can hide away
Desperation
I look up to the sky but the sun never shines
I'm waiting, yeah

There's a thousand different shades of darkness
Coloring our faith
The past is dead, the future's haunted
What happened to today, today?

There's a thousand different shades of darkness
Coloring our faith
The past is dead, the future's haunted
What happened to today, today?

There's a thousand different shades of darkness
Coloring our faith
The past is dead, the future's haunted
What happened to today, today?
