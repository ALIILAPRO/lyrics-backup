		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Kick back a little just to watch and see
Getting sicker by the minute with debauchery
Whatever your pleasure I'm your punk
On the brink of sinking baby, but not yet sunk
How I listened, low when you told me
That I was all you had to hold
I wish it were so when you told me
That you were solid gold

Gravity-free is she, look at her
Hottest on the map she's full of anti-matter
You never left a very mellow impression
Your smell or your go to hell expression
Quixoticelixer might
But it will probably not fix your bite
Tell me now, tell me how
Did I get your lipstick on my kite?

I love this weather, it's the perfect storm
Just keep it coming in its perfect form
I love this weather 'cause it keeps me warm
Just keep it coming in its perfect form

Everyday depression in a beautiful dress
Oh, lady made a beautiful mess I guess
Dedicated mind did a medicated state
Is a highly overrated fate
Terrible is a soul
When she told me there is such a thing
Do you know that you glow when you go
From winter to the spring?

I love this weather, it's the perfect storm
Just keep it coming in its perfect form
I love this weather 'cause it keeps me warm
Just keep it coming in its perfect form

The madder the boy, the sadder the song
That's a wicked fate but the sick gets strong
Mad boy, sad song
A wicked fate, but the sick gets strong
Nobody's right and everyone's wrong
I refuse to punt on fourth and long
Mad boy, sad song
Wicked fate but the sick gets

Kick back a little just to watch and see
Getting sicker by the minute with debauchery
Whatever your pleasure I'm your punk
On the brink of sinking baby, but not yet sunk
How I listened, low when you told me that
I was all you had to hold
I wish it was so when you told me
That you were solid gold

I swear to God, I could not hurt you
I've got to be inside your virtue
I can't contain my urge to search you

I stand before there's not no curfew
I long to be inside your virtue
My heart is swollen when I search you

I swear to God, I could not hurt you
My heart is swollen when I search you
I swear to God, I could not hurt you

I swear to God, I could not hurt you
I've got to be inside your virtue
I can't contain my urge to search you
