		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Just the way you are

Oh, her eyes, her eyes make the stars look like they're not shinin'
Her hair, her hair falls perfectly without her trying
She's so beautiful and I tell her everyday
Yeah, I know, I know when I compliment her, she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me "Do I look okay?"
I say

When I see your face (face)
There's not a thing that I would change 'cause you're amazing (amazing)
Just the way you are (are)
And when you smile (smile)
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause girl you're amazing (amazing)
Just the way you are (are)

The way you are
The way you are
Girl, you're amazing (amazing)
Just the way you are
(Are, are, are, are, are, are, are, are, are)
Just the way you are
(Are, are, are, are, are, are, are, are, are)
Just the way you are
(Are, are, are, are, are, are, are, are, are)
Just the way you are

Just the way you are (are)
Just the way you are (are)

The way you are
The way you are
Girl, you're amazing (amazing)
Just the way you are (are)
Yeah
