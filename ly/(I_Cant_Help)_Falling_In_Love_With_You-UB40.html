		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wise men say
"Only fools rush in"
But I can't help falling in love with you

Wise men say
"Only fools rush in"
But I can't help falling in love with you

Shall I stay?
Would it be a sin?
I can't help falling in love with you

As a river flows
Gently to the sea
Darling, so it goes
Some things were meant to be

Take my hand
Take my whole life, too
I can't help falling in love with you

As a river flows
Gently to the sea
Darling, so it goes
Some things were meant to be

Take my hand 
Take my whole life, too
I can't help falling in love with you
I can't help falling in love with you
I can't help falling in love with you
I can't help falling in love with you
