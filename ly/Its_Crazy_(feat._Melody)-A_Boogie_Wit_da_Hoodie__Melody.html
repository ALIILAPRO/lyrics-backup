		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's crazy
I'm still here livin' this lifestyle with the niggas I came with
I always just did what I had to do, I never tried bein' a gangster
My hand on the tooly while I'm on the stage, fuck it, now I gotta play dangerous
To keep it a hundred, I rather the money, I never wanted to be famous
To keep it a hundred, these niggas be buggin', just run up on me if you anxious
And niggas be totin' the grip for no reason and don't even know how to aim it
By the look on your face, I can tell you're in your feelings, trust me, you don't gotta say shit
And I don't even wanna feel how you feel, baby, I wanna be painless
Whatever you wanna do, I'm off of '42 and I do not want no chaser
And you need a nigga that handle your attitude, but I'm a nigga with paper
You probably just love me for my lifestyle, how I pull up in the latest
But I could read you like a book, I just be over here flippin' through pages

Hmm
Dada, come home
Where are you?
It's me, Melody, pick up the phone
Mmm
Miss you, I love you

I love you too
And girl, I'ma love you forever, you know this already, you know it's true
And even when I'm gone, I'ma be with you forever, unplugable
Before I even thought about going half on a baby
Girl, even your moms could tell you all about it, baby, I'm crazy
If they ever try to throw shots, I'll dive in front of you
I know I be fuckin' up, baby, but don't you go lookin' for something new
I don't wanna lay up with none of these bitches, I wanna lay up with you
And I ain't no dummy, these bitches be lovin' me 'cause of my revenue
They be tellin' you rumors, spreadin' rumors that was never true, yeah
Only want me to lose 'cause I'm makin' too much to be sweatin' you
And niggas be sellin' records off of hype now, that ain't nothin' new (yeah)
And my diamonds be goin' off without a light, now, yeah, it's crazy
My diamonds be goin' off without a light now, niggas rockin' fugazi
And everywhere I go, I'm hearin' my style, niggas gon' have to pay me
I bought me a Lam' and promised myself that I'd never go back to Mercedes
I just been goin' through phases
