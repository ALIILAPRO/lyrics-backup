		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Those happy hours
That we once knew
Though long ago
Still makes me so blue
They say that time
Heals a broken heart
But time has stood still
Since we've been apart

I can't stop loving you
I've made up my mind
To live in memories
All the lonesome time
I can't stop wanting you
It's useless to say
So I'll just live my life
In dreams of yesterday

Those happy, happy hours, baby
That we once knew
Though long ago
It still makes me blue
They say that time
Heals a broken heart
But time has stood still
Since we've been apart

I can't stop loving you, baby
I've made up my mind
To live in memories
All the lonesome time
I can't stop loving you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
It's useless to say
Useless to say
So I'll just live my life
In dreams of yesterday

Oh yeah, I've made up my mind
Made up my mind
So I'll just live my life
Live my life, yeah, yeah
I can't stop loving you
No, I can't
Baby, it's useless to say
Useless to say, yeah
So I'm gonna live my life
Live my life
In dreams of yesterday
Yesterday
I'm gonna, gonna live my life
Oh yeah, yes I am
In dreams of yesterday
Dreams of yesterday
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
