Yeah
Tough
Let's go

Rolls-Royce truck, that's tough (that's hard)
You see the star when you look up (look up)
Bad bitch and she got put up (bad)
Huncho in the back, cookin' up (cookin' up)

That's tough, that's tough (damn)
That's tough, that's tough (woo)
That's tough, that's tough (go)
That's tough, that's tough (uh)

Baguettes and the emeralds they shinin' together, that's tough (baguettes, yeah)
Ten years later, they still in the picture, that's tough (woo, that's tough)
Gettin' to the money, I'm gettin' some wit' you, that's tough 
(Gettin' some wit' you, that's tough)
Gettin' to the money, I'm gettin' some wit' you, that's tough 
(Gettin' some wit' you, that's tough)

We tough, you soft (soft)
Make a phone call and knock 'em off (brr)
There's a 150 at the loft (hunnid)
I can make a play like Randy Moss (what?)
Bought a Rolls-Royce like a boss (skrrt)
It's a bando, not a house
I got stacks of money in the couch (money)
I just get the check and then I'm out (what?)

We came up from nothing to something, got millies, we up (we up)
Pull up in the Lamb', the Range, the Bentley, that's us
That's tough, rich boss (boss)
Don't talk 'bout my pockets, they stuffed (they stuffed)
You ain't got the money, you bluff (bluff)
My bitch badder than Rihanna, that's tough (that's tough)

Rolls-Royce truck, that's tough (that's hard)
You see the star when you look up (look up)
Bad bitch and she got put up (bad)
Huncho in the back, cookin' up (cookin' up)
Don't fuck with it, that's your loss (your loss)
Big Backwood blow the face off (gas)
Money, make racks on a day off (racks)
Money, make racks on a day off

Ooh, who want the beef? (Who?)
I patty a bitch, I patty a bitch (be paid)
Straight out the streets (streets)
And pass me the stick, pass me the stick
I stand on two feet (two)
I raise my wrist, I raise you a brick (brick)
It's Huncho and Rich (Rich)
Not Lilo and Stitch, we came to hit licks

That's tough, that's tough (that's hard)
That's tough, that's tough (look up)
That's tough, that's tough (bad)
That's tough, that's tough (cookin' up)

That's tough, that's tough (damn)
That's tough, that's tough (woo)
That's tough, that's tough (go)
That's tough, that's tough (uh)

Baguettes and the emeralds they shinin' together, that's tough (baguettes, yeah)
Ten years later, they still in the picture, that's tough (woo, that's tough)
Gettin' to the money, I'm gettin' some wit' you, that's tough 
(Gettin' some wit' you, that's tough)
Gettin' to the money, I'm gettin' some wit' you, that's tough 
(Gettin' some wit' you, that's tough)
