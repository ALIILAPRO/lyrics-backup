		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Waiting down at the station
I don't remember
I think it was late then
Standing, always so quiet
We're like elevators
Filled up with strangers

No sound, no Hallelujahs
Still I was praying on the train ride home
If I can't get the things I want
If I can't get the things I want
Just give me what I need

Our words fill up the pages
Fill up the days with
Songs for the ages
Still those vows that we all speak
We break them like concrete
And just make our words cheap

I want someone to grow with
Songs I can sing to
And a family to cling to
But if I can't get the things I want
If I can't get the things I want
Just give me what I need
Just give me what I need
