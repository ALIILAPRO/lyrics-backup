		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Waking up, I see that everything is okay
The first time in my life, and now it's so great
Slowing down, I look around, and I am so amazed
I think about the little things that make life great

I wouldn't change a thing about it
This is the best feeling

This innocence is brilliant
I hope that it will stay
This moment is perfect
Please don't go away
I need you now
And I'll hold on to it
Don't you let it pass you by

I found a place so safe, not a single tear
The first time in my life, and now it's so clear
Feel calm, I belong I'm so happy here
It's so strong, and now I let myself be sincere

I wouldn't change a thing about it
This is the best feeling

This innocence is brilliant
I hope that it will stay
This moment is perfect
Please don't go away 'cause
I need you now
And I'll hold on to it
Don't you let it pass you by

It's a state of bliss; you think you're dreaming
It's the happiness inside that you're feeling
It's so beautiful, it makes you wanna cry
It's a state of bliss; you think you're dreaming
It's the happiness inside that you're feeling
It's so beautiful, it makes you wanna cry

It's so beautiful, it makes you wanna cry
This innocence is brilliance
It makes you wanna cry
This innocence is brilliance
Please don't go away
'Cause I need you now
And I'll hold on to it
Don't you let it pass you by

This innocence is brilliant
I hope that it will stay
This moment is perfect
Please don't go away
I need you now
And I'll hold on to it
Don't you let it pass you by
