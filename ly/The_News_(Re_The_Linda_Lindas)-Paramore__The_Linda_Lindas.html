		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (A war)
War, a war, a war on the far side
On the other side of the planet
And I've got war, a war, a war right behind my eyes
Right behind them just like a headache

So I turn on the news
Turn off the news

Every second, our collective heart breaks
All together, every single head shakes
Shut your eyes, but it won't go away
Turn on, turn off the news
Every second, our collective heart breaks
All together, every single head shakes
Shut your eyes, but it won't go away
Turn on, turn off the news

Far, I'm far, so far from the front line
Quite the opposite, I'm safe inside
But I worry and I give money and I feel useless behind this computer
And that's just barely scratched the surface of my mind

So I turn on the news
Turn off (turn on, turn off the news)
Turn on the news
Turn off

Every second, our collective heart breaks
All together, every single head shakes
Shut your eyes, but it won't go away
Turn on, turn off the news
Every second, our collective heart breaks
All together, every single head shakes
Shut your eyes, but it won't go away
Turn on, turn off the news

Exploitativo, performativo
Informativo y no sabemos ni la mitad
Rhetorical, deplorable
Historical and, all along, we called it normal

Exploitativo, performativo
Informativo y no sabemos ni la mitad
Rhetorical, deplorable
Historical and all along, we called it normal
All along, we called it normal

Every second, our collective heart breaks
All together, every single head shakes
Shut your eyes, but it won't go away
Turn on, turn off the news
Every second, our collective heart breaks
All together, every single head shakes
Shut your eyes, but it won't go away
Turn on, turn off the news
