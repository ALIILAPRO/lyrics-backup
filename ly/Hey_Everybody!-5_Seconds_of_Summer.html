		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sounds good, feels good

She maxed her credit cards and don't got a job
She pays the gas with all the change in her car
It's not the end of the road
Yeah, we've all been there before and it goes oh
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
He's walking home cause he can't pay for the bus
He needs a dollar but he ain't got enough
It's not the end of the world
Yeah, we've all been there before and it goes oh
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)

Hey everybody, we don't have to live this way
We can all get some, yeah, we can all get paid
So what you say everybody?
Gotta live it up today
We can all get some, yeah, we can all get paid
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)

Don't have your rent and it's the first of the month (where's my money?)
Your bank account has got insufficient funds
We can't afford to give up
We gotta make out on luck and it goes oh
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Work every weekend just to get out of town
Everyone says that you'll just turn back around
And what's ironic to me, the ones that don't ever leave
Seems that they know
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)

Hey everybody, we don't have to live this way
We can all get some, yeah, we can all get paid
So what you say everybody?
Gotta live it up today
We can all get some, yeah, we can all get paid
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)

Hey everybody, we don't have to live this way
We can all get some, yeah, we can all get paid

So what you say everybody?
Gotta live it up today
We can all get some, yeah, we can all get paid
Hey (gotta live it up today)
Oh (yeah, we don't have to live this way)
