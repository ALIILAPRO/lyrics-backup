		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, I'm fiendin' for somthin' 'cause
You tell me I'm nothin'
And I'm tired of runnin'
 I just want to be stunnin'
Am I stuck for life? No, I don't wanna try
I can't lie, I'm stoppin'
I got no more lovin'
Yeah, I'm fiendin' for
Somthin' 'cause you tell me I'm nothin'
And I'm tired of runnin'
I just want to be stunnin'
Am I stuck for life? No, I don't wanna try
I can't lie, I'm stoppin'
I got no more lovin'

Say you want to try to play a part
Gotta start again, I know it's hard
And I try, I know I do
But I do it for me and I do it for you
And I'm scared that I might not
Just know what to do
I'm just trying my best
I have nothin' to prove
Shut down, tell me that you love me
Crossbeat and some touchin'
Feels like I've been rustin'
Feels like I've been rustin'
Yeah, feels like I've been rustin

Yeah, I'm fiendin' for somthin' 'cause
You tell me I'm nothin'
And I'm tired of runnin'
I just want to be stunnin'
Am I stuck for life? No, I don't wanna try
I can't lie, I'm stoppin'
I got no more lovin'
Yeah, I'm fiendin' for somthin' 'cause
You tell me I'm nothin'
And I'm tired of runnin'
I just want to be stunnin'
Am I stuck for life? No, I don't wanna try
I can't lie, I'm stoppin'
I got no more lovin'
