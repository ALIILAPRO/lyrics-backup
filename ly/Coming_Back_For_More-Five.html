		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  [Chorus]
If you're coming back for more,
Then get ready, Get ready,
Cos everthing I've got is yours,
So get ready, Get ready!

No, You never had it so good baby,
So you're coming back for more,
I can always drive your body crazy,
Cos its you that I adore,
I don't wanna love just anybody,
I just wanna make you mine,
All I need is just a little baby,
All I need is a little time.

If you really want it in your face,
Then we better make it clear,
Take a good look around you baby,
There's five boys standing here.

Is there any time to talk about it?
Cos darling we're a pair,
It's now or never if you want it baby,
Come take it if you dare!

[Chorus]

Is there any time to talk about it?
Cos talking does no good,
Just a little bit of lovin baby,
I'd take it if I could,
Just come a little closer baby,
I wanna sink you deep,
You better call your mother baby,
Cos we won't get no sleep, No, No!

[Chorus ]

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, Oh 8,
Concentrate while I hit you off straight,
Open up you mind,
Get you hungry,
Make you wait,
Baby boo,
What I gotta do is get it on with you,
Cos the skies the limit anything we wanna do,
Can we kick back now?
Tell me baby can I lay ya?
Upon ya back now it's gonna happen as a way,
We gotta take you to the top and never stop,
And when the cop,
The whole lock,
Gimme a shot.

[Chorus Until Fade]
