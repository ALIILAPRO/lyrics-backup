		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This world is full of life, intelligent or otherwise
Our cities are stars in the Martian sky
Somewhere distant, a comet flies and we're too bright to see it
We are blind in our good eye

If dogs hail from Jupiter
Then I'm most certainly from Mars 
I see it better than you do
And I'm almost blind

This Earth reeks of life, belligerent or otherwise
Strangers don't come anymore. They fear our skies 
Somewhere distant, a dog laughs and we're to dull to hear it
Our ears full of lies

The dogs hail from Jupiter
And I'm undoubtedly from Mars
I hear it better than most do
And I'm nearly deaf
I'm nearly deaf

We are just stars
We are just lights 
They are the dogs 
And I am alone 
On this dusty planet 
Looking into the night sky
And I see all of those cities 
Lose their shine
