		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We will know
When they arrive
Because they are
Monsters!
Whose offerings are filthy?
Whose thoughts are humble?
Monster - inside.
Monster - outside.
Dead kings - kings of the underground.
Dead kings - spread words of those who dead.
Dead kings - kings of the underground.
Dead kings - all mortals will drown in red!
They edify unwise and ignorant ones,
They preach heresy and the vice.
Terrible outrage against nature
Which should not be on our side.
They drink blood.
They plod using sufferings to prolong their lives.
Dead kings - kings of the underground.
Dead kings - spread words of those who dead.
They thirst to stuff their wombs by deaths
And drink the souls at the morbid feast.
Our screams are the music,
Our blood is the wine,
Our fears and despair 
Most beloved viands.
They spend centuries of human lives and inhuman sufferings
In forbidden desires and disgusting sins.
Lips of betrayers whisper their names
In the lands where nobody dies fast.
Dead kings - kings of the underground.
Dead kings - spread words of those who dead.
Dead kings - kings of the underground.
Dead kings - all mortals will drown in red.
In red!
