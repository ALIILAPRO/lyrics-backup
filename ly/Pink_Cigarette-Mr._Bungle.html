		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hush me, touch me 
Perfume, the wind and the leaves 
Hush me, touch me 
The burns, the holes in the sheets 

I'm hoping the smoke 
Hides the shame I've got on my face 
Cognac and broken glass 
All these years I've been your ashtray (not today)

I found a pink cigarette 
On the bed the day that you left 
And how can I forget that your lips were there 
Your kiss goes everywhere, touches everything but me 

Hush me, touch me 
Champagne, your hair in the breeze 
Hush me, touch me 
Lipstick, a slap on my cheek 

Your eyes cried at last 
Told me everything I was afraid to ask 
Now I'm dressed in white 
And you've burned me for the last time (this ain't the last time)

I found a pink cigarette 
On the bed the day that you left 
And how can I forget that your lips were there 
Your kiss goes everywhere, touches everything but me 

You'll find a note and you'll see my silhouette 

There's just five hours left until you find me dead 
There's just four hours left until you find me dead 
There's just three hours left until you find me dead 
There's just two hours left until you find me dead 
There's one more hour and then you will find me dead 
There's just
