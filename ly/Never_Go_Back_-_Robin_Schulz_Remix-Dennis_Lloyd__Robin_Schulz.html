		  I never go back
No, no, no
I never go
I never go back
I never go back
No, no, no
I never go
I never go back

It's not my baby
Not the girl I knew then
Not the girl I know now, anymore
I wanna leave you
Baby don't you leave me
Baby don't you love me? Mi amor

Always look around you
Tryna see the good things
Why you always say that you never done wrong?
Why you never hold me?
Tell me that you love me
Why you always say that you'd never let go?

I never go back
I never go back

I wanna do this
I don't wanna do this
Girl, we shouldn't do this anymore
Quiero dejarte, ¿no me necesitas?
¿Por qué siempre dices
Eso mi amor?

Always look around you
Tryna see the good things
Why you always say that you never done wrong?
Why you never hold me?
Tell me that you love me
Why you always say that you'd never let go?

I never go back
No, no, no
I never go
I never go back
I never go back
No, no, no
I never go
I never go back

I never go back
No, no, no
I never go
I never go back
I never go back
No, no, no
I never go
I never go back
I never go back
I never go back
I never go back

I wanna leave you, wanna leave you
But I can't let go
I wanna leave you, wanna leave you
But I can't let go
I wanna leave you, wanna leave you
But I can't let go
I wanna leave you, wanna leave you
But I can't let go

Always look around you
Tryna see the good things
Why you always say that you never done wrong?
Why you never hold me?
Tell me that you love me
Why you always say that you'd never let go?

I never go back
No, no, no
I never go
I never go back
I never go back
No, no, no
I never go
I never go back
I never go back
No, no, no
I never go
I never go back
I never go back
No, no, no
I never go
I never go back

I never go back
I wanna leave you, wanna leave you
But I can't let go
I wanna leave you, wanna leave you
But I can't let go
I never go back
I wanna leave you, wanna leave you
But I can't let go
I wanna leave you, wanna leave you
But I can't let go

I never go back
