		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Someone to hold you too close
Someone to hurt you too deep
Someone to sit in your chair
To ruin your sleep

"That's true, but there's more than that"
"Is that all you think there is to it?"
"You've got so many reasons for not being with someone, but Robert
You haven't got one good reason for being alone"
"Come on, you're on to something, Bobby
You're on to something"

Someone to need you too much
Someone to know you too well
Someone to pull you up short
To put you through hell

"You're not a kid anymore, Robert
I don't think you'll ever be a kid again, kiddo"
"Hey, buddy, don't be afraid it won't be perfect
The only thing to be afraid of really is that it won't be"
"Don't stop now
Keep going"

Someone you have to let in
Someone whose feelings you spare
Someone who, like it or not
Will want you to share
A little, a lot

"And what does all that mean?"
"Robert, how do you know so much about it when you've never been there?"
"It's much better living it than looking at it, Robert"
"Add 'em up, Bobby
Add 'em up"

Someone to crowd you with love
Someone to force you to care
Someone to make you come through
Who'll always be there
As frightened as you
Of being alive
Being alive
Being alive
Being alive

"Blow out the candles Robert
And make a wish"
"Want is something
Want is something"

Somebody hold me too close
Somebody hurt me too deep
Somebody sit in my chair
And ruin my sleep
And make me aware
Of being alive
Being alive

Somebody need me too much
Somebody know me too well
Somebody pull me up short
And put me through hell
And give me support
For being alive
Make me alive
Make me alive

Make me confused
Mock me with praise
Let me be used
Vary my days

But alone
Is alone
Not alive

Somebody crowd me with love
Somebody force me to care
Somebody let come through
I'll always be there
As frightened as you
To help us survive
Being alive
Being alive
Being alive
