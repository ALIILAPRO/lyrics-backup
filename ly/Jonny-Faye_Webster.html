		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm losing my mind
Why the hell did I paint these walls white?
And I wonder, what's the point of this life?
Sometimes I'll pray but I will never close my eyes

I want to be happy
Find a man with an old name just like me
And get over how my dog is my best friend
And he doesn't even know what my name is

Jonny, did you ever love me?
Jonny, help me figure it out
Not that I've paid attention
But you haven't said it out loud
Jonny, do you see what you're doing?
What you're making me think about?
This wasn't 'posed to be a love song
But I guess it is now

Jonny, baby you'll never hear this
Or maybe it's stuck in your head
Well I hope it makes you cry
The way that I did

Jonny, did you ever love me?
Jonny, help me figure it out
Not that I've paid attention
But you haven't said it out loud
Jonny, do you see what you're doing?
What you're making me think about?
This wasn't 'posed to be a love song
But I guess it is now, isn't it?
