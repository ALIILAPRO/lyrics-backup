		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's a beautiful life, but I'm not concerned
It's a beautiful dream, but a dream is earned
I can dress like a boy, I can dress like a girl
Keep your beautiful words, 'cause I'm not concerned

'Cause your world is such a shame
'Cause your world's obsessed with fame
'Cause your world's in so much pain
'Cause your world is
'Cause your world is
Up in flames

It's a beautiful plan (hmm), but I'm not concerned (oh yeah)
It's a beautiful game (hmm) that I never learned
People tell me to shut my mouth (shut your mouth)
That I might get burned
Keep your beautiful lies (hmm) 'cause I'm not concerned

'Cause your world is such a shame
'Cause your world's obsessed with fame
'Cause your world's in so much pain
'Cause your world is
'Cause your world is

I will﻿ not denounce the things that I have said
I will not renounc﻿e my faith in my sweet Lord
He has chosen me to fight against the English
I am not afraid at all to die 'cause I believe you
God is on my side and I'll be fine
I am not afraid 'cause I have faith in him
You can cut my hair and throw me in a jail cell
Say that I'm a witch and burn me at the stake
It's all a big mistake
Don't you know to doubt him is a sin?
I won't give in

They are so naive
They think we are not aware of their crimes
We know, but we are just not ready to act
The storm isn't in the air, it's inside of us
I want to tell you about love and loneliness
But it's getting late now
Can't you hear outside of your Supreme hoodie, the wind that's beginning to howl?

It's a beautiful life
