		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's easier said than done
And nobody said it'd be this hard
Remember when we were young
I'm losing my head when I know everyone says
That it gets easier
Goodnight in New York
A place on the park
I thought it'd be nice to show ya, mm
I miss you the most
From coffee and robes and cinnamon toast
To closure, mmm
So what did I do
And why did you make me want you at all
One into two
Cause forgetting you is
Easier said than done
And nobody said it'd be this hard
Remember when we were young
I'm losing my head when I know everyone says
That it gets easier
I bought a guitar
And hung it as art and you always thought that I played, mm
Didn't know I was walking a tight-rope
I was learning to tip-toe
Doesn't make any sense when you're on the fence
We'll drown in the same boat
So what did I do
And why did you make me want you at all
One into two
Cause forgetting you is
Easier said than done
And nobody said it'd be this hard
Remember when we were young
I'm losing my head when I know everyone says
That it gets easier
That it gets easier
It's easier said than done
And nobody said it'd be this hard
Remember when we were young
I'm losing my head when I know everyone says
That it gets easier
