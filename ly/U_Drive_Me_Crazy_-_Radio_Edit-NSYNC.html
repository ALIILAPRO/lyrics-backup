		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You drive me crazy
Why are you messin' with my mind?
You drive me crazy
Why are you tellin' all these lies?
You drive me crazy
Stop doing all these things to me
You drive me crazy
'Cause all I want is to be free

I'm feeling weak, I cannot sleep
My head is burning, I feel cold down to my feet
I wanna yell, somebody help
Is there a cure for what I've got?
Somebody tell me
I need your lovin' face
I need your sweet embrace
'Cause you are my only medicine

You drive me crazy
Why are you messin' with my mind?
You drive me crazy
Why are you tellin' all these lies?
You drive me crazy
Stop doing all these things to me
You drive me crazy
'Cause all I want is to be free

You're on my mind, I'm so uptight
I feel sensation in my head down to my spine
Goin' insane, can't stand the pain
Is my condition permanent? Somebody tell me
I need your lovin' face
I need your sweet embrace
'Cause you are my only medicine

You drive me crazy
Why are you messin' with my mind?
You drive me crazy
Why are you tellin' all these lies?
You drive me crazy
Stop doing all these things to me
You drive me crazy
'Cause all I want is to be free

Twenty four, seven
You are on my mind, I'm going crazy
You are the cure and you know, but you don't care
Girl you're driving me insane

You can say what you want to
Do what you want to
As long as you love me girl, I won't front you
You're the sweetest thing
Let me be your man
Let me hold your hand
Or let me be your friend
Meanwhile I will set the house, up on a hill
Girl as you know it's all about the dollar bill
Girl I treat you like a queen, like a lady
Chica, chico, you drive me crazy

You're always on my mind
I need you all the time
So come and get with me
'Cause darlin' you're the one I need
Someone to hold me tight
'Cause I can't sleep at night
You are my fantasy
Girl you drive me crazy

You drive me crazy
Why are you messin' with my mind?
You drive me crazy
Why are you tellin' all these lies?
You drive me crazy
Stop doing all these things to me
You drive me crazy
'Cause all I want is to be free

Crazy
Why are you messin' with my mind?
Crazy
Why are you tellin' all these lies?
Crazy
You drive me crazy
Crazy
'Cause all I want is to be free
Crazy
