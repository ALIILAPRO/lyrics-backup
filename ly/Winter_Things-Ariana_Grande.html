		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It ain't even cold outside, not where I'm from
Feeling like it's mid-July under the sun
My jacket don't get no love
No hats and no gloves, not even a chance of rain
But my baby's in town and we're gonna do some winter things

Hey-oh, I wanna pretend we're at the North Pole
Turning the heat into an ice cold holiday
Made just for me and my baby
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
My baby's in town and we're gonna do some winter things
Hey, yeah

Take me to the ice-skating rink downtown (no, no, no, downtown)
Even though it's a hundred degrees, gotta get out (out)
Ain't no ice and no chills, no snowmen to build
Most of our friends at the beach
But my baby's in town and we're gonna do some winter things
Hey, yeah

Hey-oh, I wanna pretend we're at the North Pole
Turning the heat into an ice cold holiday
Made just for me and my baby
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
My baby's in town and we're gonna do some winter things
Hey, yeah

Just imagine that we're laughing
In my cabin, chillin' by the fireside
Even though this sun is blasting
We can be wherever if we visualize

Hey-oh, I wanna pretend we're at the North Pole
Turning the heat into an ice cold holiday
Made just for me and my baby
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
My baby's in town and we're gonna do some winter things
Hey, yeah

Ooh (ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah)
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
La-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la
