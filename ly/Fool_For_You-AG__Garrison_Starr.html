		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My house is full of ghosts, I cannot see,
My heart is full of holes, I keep it empty,
And all this holy water, there is a waterfall,
I wanna pick you up, high above, above it all, uh-huh

You can break me down, take my breath away,
I know what's coming babe, your ways are dangerous,
You got your walls high, I still climb them,
You got those things you hide, I still find them,

I am a fool for you, I am a fool for you,
You fool me into loving you,

I feel the resurection, of an ungodly love, 
Think I need your protection, a little too much,
My house is full of ghosts, I cannot see, 
My heart is full of holes, I keep it empty,

Cause I am a fool for you, I am a fool for you,
You fool me into loving you,
I am a fool for you, I am a fool for you,
I am a fool for you, 

Ah ah ah,
Oooh, ooh, ooh,
Ah ah ah,
Oooh, ooh, ooh,
Ah ah ah,
Oooh, ooh, ooh,
Ah ah ah,
Oooh, ooh, ooh,
Ah ah ah, ah ah ah
I am a fool for you.
I am a fool.
