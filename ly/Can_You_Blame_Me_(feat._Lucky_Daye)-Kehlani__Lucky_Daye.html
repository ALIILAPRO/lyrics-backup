		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I need you here, my safe haven (safe)
Rather go at it, then not speak at all
How you made me feel is dangerous

Oh, you know
I would rather argue than me sleep alone
Rather call you out than no one call my phone
Hold my grudge instead of havin' none to hold, none to hold

'Cause you made me fall in it
Yeah, you're the reason I got a weakness, oh, no
You drive me crazy, still that's my baby
Can't get enough of you
Baby, it's somethin' that you do
Can't get enough of you
Baby, it's somethin' that you do

Say it umpteen times
You think I'ma leave, but I'm never gonna jump sides
We been on a rough ride
Still ride shawty with a nigga through the long nights
And it's always two rights
Playin' games with our hands tied
Who else can I confide in?
Don't want a war tryna win a fight, and yeah, you got it

Cover my phone up
Hopin' you decide to just show up
Rather say it all to your face
I rather we act like grown ups
Sometimes I block all your calls
You start hittin' my girls up
Talkin' 'bout, "Where's my baby?"
And that's when I soften up

Yeah, you know
I would rather argue than me sleep alone
Rather call you out than no one call my phone
Hold my grudge instead of havin' none to hold, none to hold

'Cause you made me fall in it
Yeah, you're the reason I got a weakness, oh, no
You drive me crazy, still that's my baby
Can't get enough of you
Baby, it's somethin' that you do
Can't get enough of you
Baby, it's somethin' that you do

You're the only one for me, only one for me, oh
Only one for me, only one for me, yeah
Only one for me, only one for me, oh
