		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Give me some time
Impatience on and on
I’m trying to find a place that feels like home
Those endless tides of panic on my soul
Someday will die and leave us all unknown

I spent those nights all alone
You know I waited for ghosts to show
They told me stay on the road
They told me stay on the road
Collide the doubts like wrecking balls
It might leave stains on the rope

Some need, some need smiles
Some need, some need smiles
Some need, some need to sail away when it dies
Some need to say prayers when it breaks

Singing those lies that echo for so long
Burning inside the ashes of love gone
After some time the memory’s monochrome
Leaving the lines of memories now long gone

I spent those nights all alone
You know I waited for ghosts to show
They told me stay on the road
They told me stay on the road!
Collide the doubts like wrecking balls
It might leave stains on the rope

Some need, some need smiles
Some need, some need smiles
Some need, some need to sail away when it dies
Some need to say prayers when it breaks
