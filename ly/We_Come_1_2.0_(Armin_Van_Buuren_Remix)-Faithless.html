		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All the subtle flavours of my life have become
Bitter seeds and poisoned leaves
Without you

You represent what's true
I drain the colour from the sky and turn blue
Without you

These arms lack a purpose
Flappin' like a humming bird
I'm nervous 'cause I'm the left eye, you're the right
Would it not be madness to fight?

We come one

In you the song which rights my wrongs
In you the fullness of living
The power to begin again
From right now
In you 
(In you, in you, in you, in you, in you, in you, in you, in you, in you, in you, in you, in you, in you)

Come one (come one, come one, come one, come one, come one)

We come one (come one, come one, come one)

We come one

We come
We come one

I'm unafraid
Never, never scared
Worries washed
Pressed, aired
I'm the left eye, you're the right
Would it not be madness to fight?

We come one (one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one)
One 
(One, one, one, one, one, one)

We come one (come one, come one, come one, come one, come one, come one, come one)

One
One
One

We come

We come
(One)

One
