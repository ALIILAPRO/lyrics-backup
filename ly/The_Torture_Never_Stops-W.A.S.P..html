		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bang, bang, banging in your head 
You're banging on the walls 
Hang, hang, hanging up yourself 
You're hanging by your balls 

And you, you die but no-one hears or cares 
And hope's the rope that keeps you tied in knots 

The torture never stops 
The torture never stops 

Suck, suck, sucking at your life 
Your master sucks the juice 
Shoot, shoot, shooting at you 
And the hangman's noose is loose 

And you, you cry but no-one hears or cares 
And hope's the rope that keeps you tied in knots 

The torture never stops 
The torture never stops 

Your masters beat you bloody 
Still you're running back for more 
And every day, you lay down and play the whore 

The torture never stops 
The torture never stops
