		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's been a year
You threw me out
Of your place and you broke me up
I've been lost
Out my mind
Blame myself for the shit you've done
You blew it up
Like dynamite
I didn't wanna say goodbye
Open up a million times
Thought you were the love of my life

You said, "I'll break your heart"
Oh, you'll be breaking mine
So take all your stuff
'Fore it falls out of line
Now you regret it all
Like, what the fuck?
You're the one who cut me up

Don't you dare
Come back
You already left once
Ain't lettin' you back in
Now you're at my door
Acting like you changed, huh
That love is complicated
Expect me to forgive you
Well fuck you
I don't love you anymore
O-o-ore, o-o-ore
I'm just the girl that you lost
She don't love you any more

Why the hell do you love me now
If you didn't love me in the past?
Heavy now, with all my scars
Showing up to rip 'em up
Brought me lies, you brought me lies
Tell the truth, no, I don't mind
I don't care if you beg
No, I won't go back in time

Baby, you broke my heart
I thought that you were mine
Think you're a work of art
You're trash I see that now
You regret it all
Like what the fuck?
You're the one who cut me up

Don't you dare
Come back
You already left once
Ain't lettin' you back in
Now you're at my door
Acting like you changed, huh
That love is complicated
Expect me to forgive you
Well, fuck you
I don't love you anymore
O-o-ore, o-o-ore
I'm just the girl that you lost
She don't love you anymore
O-o-ore, o-o-ore
I'm just the girl that you lost
She don't love you anymore

Don't think
Don't think
That you'll win me back
No, I'm the girl
No, I'm the girl
That you lost
Don't think
Don't think
That you'll win me back
'Cause I'm the girl that you lost

Don't you dare come back
You already left once
Ain't lettin' you back in
Now you're at my door
Acting like you changed (huh)
That love is complicated
Expect me to forgive you
Well fuck you
I don't love you anymore
O-o-ore, o-o-ore
I'm just the girl that you lost
She don't love you anymore
O-o-ore, o-o-ore
I'm just the girl that you lost
She don't love you anymore
