		  Hiding
I kinda feel like an island
I should go home but I'm fighting that right now
People freak me out
And I panic
I should be cool, but I panic
Out of the blue
And I end up on the ground, weaker all around

But it's so hard
When it feels like my fault
When I keep 'em so far
Happens when I go dark
I'm so unsteady
It's so hard
When it feels like my fault
When I keep 'em so far
Happens when I go dark
I'm so unsteady

Deeper
Words seem to cut so much deeper
Right to the bone
And I let 'em break me down
Someone pull me out right now
I'm in danger
The girl in the mirror's a stranger
At all of the parties
I talk but there's no sound
Violet shrinking down

And it's so hard
When it feels like my fault
When I keep 'em so far
Happens when I go dark
I'm so unsteady
It's so hard
When it feels like my fault
When I keep 'em so far
Happens when I go dark
I'm so unsteady

Lately I've been staring at the ceiling
It's a sort of funny, quiet feeling
Lately I don't know what to believe in
None of this is changing with the seasons

Hiding
I kinda feel like an island
I should go home but I'm fighting that right now
People freak me out

But it's so hard
When it feels like my fault
When I keep 'em so far
Happens when I get dark (when I get dark)
I'm so unsteady (oh)
It's so hard
When it feels like my fault
When I keep 'em so far
Happens when I go dark
I'm so unsteady

I'm so unsteady
I'm so unsteady
I'm so un-
I'm so unsteady
