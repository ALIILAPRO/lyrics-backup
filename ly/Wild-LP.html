		  WILD
I could be your North Star
I could be the love of your life
I could warm your cold heart
I could walk the edge of your knife
And when you think you’re so high
I can always take you higher
You never can be too high
Fuck it, baby let’s go higher
Every time I say I’m sorry
I never wanna fight again
I never wanna hurt you honey
Remember when we were just friends?
So…
Let me go wild
I wanna float I wanna fly
My inner child
I only need it to survive
Let me go wild
I gotta flow, I gotta fly
Let me go wild
We’re only running out of time
Out of time, oh oh oh
Time time time, oh oh oh
I could be you quick fix
I could be the catch for your fall
And when you need to get kicks
I can give the best of them all
Cuz every time I say I’m sorry
I never wanna fight again
And even if we end our story
Everything is just pretend
So…
Let me go wild
I wanna float, I wanna fly
My inner child
I only need it to survive
Let me go wild
I gotta flow I gotta fly
Let me go wild
We’re only running out of time
Out of time, oh oh oh
Time time time, oh oh oh
