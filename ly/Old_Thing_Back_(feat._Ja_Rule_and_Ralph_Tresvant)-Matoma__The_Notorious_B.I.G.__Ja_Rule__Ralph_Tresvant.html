		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  To sex, I'm similar to the thriller in Manila
Honey's call me Bigga, the condom filler
Whether it's stiff tongue or stiff dick
Biggie squeeze it to make shit fit, now check this shit

I got the pack of Rough Riders in the back of the Pathfinder
You know the Ep along by James Todd
Smith I get swift with the lyrical gift
Hit you with the dick, make your kidneys shift

Here we go, here we go, but I'm not Domino
I got the funk flow to make your drawers drop slow
So recognize the dick size in these Karl Kani jeans
I wear thirteens, know what I mean

I fuck around and hit you with the Hennessey dick
Mess around and go blind, don't get to see shit
The next batter, here to shatter your bladder
It doesn't matter skinny or fat or

Light skinned or black, baby I drop these
Boricua mommies screamin' "Aiy papi"
I love it when they call me Big Poppa
I only smoke blunts if they rolled propa

Look, I gotcha caught up with the drunk flow
Fuck Tae Kwon do, I tote a fo'-fo'
For niggaz gettin' mad 'cause they bitch chose me
A big black motherfucker with G ya see

All I do is separate the game from the truth
Big bang boots from the Bronx to Bolivia
Gettin' physical like Olivia Newton
Tricks suck my clique dick all day with no trivia

So gimme a hoe, a bankroll and a bag of weed
I'm guaranteed to fuck her till her nose bleed
Even if your new man's a certified mack
You'll get that H-town in ya, you'll want that old thing back

What you wanna do? I got that old thing back
What you wanna see? Baby sing relax and feel him
What you wanna do? I got that old thing back
What you wanna see? Baby sing relax and feel him

Old thing back
Like B I double G I E, with some R U L E
Notorious know to bust in your E Y E, baby baby
Bitches know they love and hate me

I come, you come, we come with back some maybe
How close we came to coming together is crazy
How come you ain't your sis with similar faces
When I come you be cryin' like I'm killin' ya bitches

You know there's a bigger picture than the camera rolled
'Cause I only got to knowin' how the shits unfolded
Back shots through the rear, got the mack unloaded
Got a reload, like every so-often

Sayin' I got my swagger back
I'm lookin' like bitch, my swagger never left
But we so hard pressed, to be impressed by these new rappers
They actors, and the fact is, you want that old thing back

What you wanna do?
What you wanna do? I got that old thing back
What you wanna see? Baby sing relax and feel him
What you wanna do? I got that old thing back
What you wanna see? Baby sing relax and feel him

Is my mind playin' tricks, like Scarface and Bushwick
Willie D, havin' nightmares of girls killin' me
She mad because what we had didn't last
I'm glad because her cousin let me hit the ass

Fuck the past let's dwell on the 500 SL
The E&J and Ginger Ale
The way my pockets swell to the rim with Benjamin's
Another hun's in the crib, please send her in

I fuck nonstop, lick my lips a lot, used to lick the clits a lot
But lickin' clits had to stop
'Cause y'all don't know how to act when the tongue go down below
Peep the funk flow, really though

I got the cleanest, meanest, penis
Ya never seen this stroke of genius
So take off your Tim boots and your bodysuit
I mean the Spandex and hit my man next

Sex gettin' rougher when it come to the nut buster
Pussy crusher, black nasty motherfucker
I don't chase 'em, I replace 'em
And if I'm caressin' 'em, I'm undressin' 'em

Fuck whatcha heard who's the best in New York
For fillin' fantasies without that nigga Mr. Walk
Or Tattoo I got you wrapped around my dick
And when I'm done I got to split, shit

What you wanna do? I got that old thing back
What you wanna see? Baby sing relax and feel him
What you wanna do? I got that old thing back
What you wanna see? Baby sing relax and feel him
