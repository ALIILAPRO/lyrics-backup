		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What you don't know, the legend goes, can hurt you 
If you only want to live and die in fear 
They tell us to believe just half of what we see 
And absolutely nothing that we hear

Resist the twised truth no matter what the cost
Supplant the rights with wrongs inside our heads
Outlawing all the questions to the answers
That no one likes when someone ends up dead

Dystopia
Dystopia
Dystopia
Dystopia

What you don't know, the legend goes, can't hurt you
If you only want to live and die in a cage
There's panic and there's chaos rampant in the streets
Where useless thoughts are peace are met with rage

Demoralized and overmastered people think
The quickest way to end a war is lose
Dictatorship ends starting with tyrannicide
You must destroy the cancer at its root

Dystopia
Dystopia
Dystopia
Dystopia
