		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do you or don't you want this to be your song?
It doesn't take a rebel to sing along
This art is weak in its pretty, pretty frame
And I'm your monkey with a misspelled name

I'll put down your disco
And take your heart away
I'll put down your disco
And take your heart away
I'll be born again

I'm someone else, I'm someone new
I'm someone stupid, just like you
I'm someone else, I'm someone new
I'm someone stupid, just like you

Do you, don't you want to take this hit?
Does it make you feel like a part of it?

And I'll put down your disco
And take your heart away
I'll put down your disco
And take your heart away
I'll be born again

I'm someone else, I'm someone new
I'm someone stupid, just like you
I'm someone else, I'm someone new
I'm someone stupid, just like you
I'm someone else, I'm someone new
I'm someone stupid, just like you
I'm someone else, I'm someone new
I'm someone stupid, just like you

(The valley of the dolls)
(Is the valley of the dead)
The valley of the dolls
Is the valley of the dead

I'm someone else, I'm someone new
I'm someone stupid, just like you
I'm someone else, I'm someone new
I'm someone stupid, just like you

I'll put down your disco
And take your heart away
I'll put down your disco
And take your heart away
I'll be born again
I'll be born again
I'll be born again
I'll be born again
