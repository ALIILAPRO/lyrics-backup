		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Maybe I'm overthinking all this
Or maybe it's time to say what's really on my mind
You haven't been the same since august
And I haven't been the same since you walked in my life
Oh when did this get so real
Can't make you feel what you don't feel
And I miss you tonight
Baby it's been too many years just to give you up
Cause through all these tears I still see our love
If our story's ending, do I still go on pretending
Like this couldn't be real, and make believe in us anyway
Maybe I'm being too dramatic
Or maybe you're done and i can't read between the lines
So here I go oh
Saying I could do better
When both of us know you don't want it forever
It's taking its toll on me
Thought that you'd fight til end oh
Cause I'll fight til the end oh
When did this get so real
With no regard for how I feel
And I miss you tonight
Baby it's been too many years just to give you up
Cause through all these tears I still see our love
If our story's ending, do I still go on pretending
Like this couldn't be real, and make believe in us anyway
To make believe in us
Baby it's been too many years just to give you up
Cause through all these tears I still see our love
If our story's ending, do I still go on pretending
Like this couldn't be real, and make believe in us anyway
