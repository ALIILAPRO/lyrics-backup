		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Step back and relax
The pain is gonna
Subside when you find
You're talking to the
Monster lanky cranky
Monster he just wanna 
Wander an' conquer
An itty bitty longer
Don't bother to run
He gonna catch ya
Gonna blend in the trees
Until he grabs ya
But hear the fear
Coming closer appearing, screaming
Every thought is disappearing

You say you can run
But nobody can run
From the demon's stun
Sirens blare one by one
Take a step and pause
Don't become the cause
Everybody goes in
He's already been waiting
Gonna wait an' take them, slay them

All my thoughts are fading as my mind stutters
As my thoughts continue overpowered by the clamor

From the monster

Step back and relax
The pain is gonna
Subside when you find
You're talking to the
Monster lanky cranky
Monster he just wanna 
Wander an' conquer
An itty bitty longer
Don't bother to run
He gonna catch ya
Gonna blend in the trees
Until he grabs ya
But hear the fear
Coming closer appearing, screaming
Every thought is disappearing

I'mma tell you now
Hopefully somehow
That you get out
Moving through the trees that he don't allow
Maybe he cares
About your scare
Everybody knows though
He don't want you to go home

All my thoughts are fading as my mind stutters
As my thoughts continue overpowered by the clamor

From the monster

Step back and relax
The pain is gonna
Subside when you find
You're talking to the
Monster lanky cranky
Monster he just wanna 
Wander an' conquer
An itty bitty longer
Don't bother to run
He gonna catch ya
Gonna blend in the trees
Until he grabs ya
But hear the fear
Coming closer appearing, screaming
Every thought is disappearing 

Step back and relax
The pain is gonna
Subside when you find
You're talking to the
Monster lanky cranky
Monster he just wanna 
Wander an' conquer
An itty bitty longer
Don't bother to run
He gonna catch ya
Gonna blend in the trees
Until he grabs ya
But hear the fear
Coming closer appearing, screaming
Every thought is disappearing
