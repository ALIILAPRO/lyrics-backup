		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  He left on a boat
Just to follow a dream
He had to find
You can't hold a man
When he follows a dream
That's on his mind
I see a boat on the river
It's sailing away
Down to the ocean
Where to I can't say
Boat on the river
It's sailing away
Down to the ocean
Where to I can't say
I waited for him
Such a very long time
Don't know what for
'Cause I should have known
When he left on the boat
We'll meet no more
I see a boat on the river
It's sailing away
Down to the ocean
Where to I can't say
Boat on the river
It's sailing away
Down to the ocean
Where to I can't say
Boat on the river
It's sailing away
Down to the ocean
Where to I can't say
Boat on the river
You're bound for the sea
If you should find him
Please greet him from me
There were people who came
And said it's really a shame
Why did he take off
To follow just a dream
But I guess they were wrong
In life you're sailing along
And things don't turn out
As simple as they seem
Boat on the river
It's sailing away
Down to the ocean
Where to I can't say
I see a boat on the river
It's sailing away
Down to the ocean
Where to I can't say
I see a boat on the river
You're bound for the sea
If you should find him
Please greet him from me
Boat on the river
It's sailing away
Down to...
