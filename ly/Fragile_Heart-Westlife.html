		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A fragile heart, was broken before,
I don't think it could endure another pain,
But there's a voice from deep inside of you,
That's calling out to make you realize,
That this new bond gives inspiration,
To all that feel no love appeal no more,
So how can I break this wall around you,
That's aiding both our hearts to grow in pain. 

So forget your past,
And we can dream tomorrow,
Save our hearts for care and loving too,
It's hard I know, but oh one thing's for sure,
Don't go and break this fragile heart. 

A hurting mind in need of emotion,
I don't think I could endure another pain,
But baby in you I've found affection,
Affection I have never felt before. 

So don't let your past,
Destroy what comes tomorrow,
Don't go and break this fragile heart. 

With all this fire that burns between us,
There's so much to lose,
Yet so much more to gain,
And if I could choose the world around me,
The world I choose would all revolve around you,
So help me complete the game inside me,
And help to mend this fragile heart
