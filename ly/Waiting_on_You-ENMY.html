		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You got me feeling hazy
And now my confidence betrays me
Intoxicated past my senses
Feeling like nothing can phase me

Got a bitter taste on my lips
Lost my hold while I'm coming to grips
I felt your embrace
While demons drag me down

Disoriented
Reality slips

You're the high
I can't live without
Was feeling lifted
But I'm drowning
I can't think straight
Head is pounding
So high
I can't live without 
Was feeling lifted 
But I'm drowning 
I can't think straight 
Head is pounding
Pounding

You're the drug I couldn't live without
Had enough of always blacking out
Flirting with disaster
Happy never after
Yeah I'm giving up on waiting on you 

Cut you off but I'm losing sleep
Promises getting harder to keep
This is out of control 
And it's taken it's toll
Now I'm feeling like I'm in too deep

You're the high
I can't live without
Was feeling lifted
But I'm drowning
I can't think straight
Head is pounding
So high
I can't live without
Was feeling lifted 
But I'm drowning 
I can't think straight 
Head is pounding
Pounding 

You're the fever that I'm sweating out
You were my high but now I'm coming down
Down, down
Yeah I'm giving up on waiting on you 

You
I've given up on waiting on you

You're the high
I can't live without
Was feeling lifted
But I'm drowning
I can't think straight
Head is pounding
So high
I can't live without
Was feeling lifted 
But I'm drowning 
I can't think straight 
Head is pounding
Pounding 

You're the fever that I'm sweating out
You were my high but now I'm coming down
Down, down
Yeah I'm giving up on waiting on you 
Took too long just to figure out 
Never got me high
Always brought me down
Down, down
Yeah I'm giving up on waiting on you
