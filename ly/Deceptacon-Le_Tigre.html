		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Who took the bomp?

Every day and night
Every day and night
I can see your disco disco dick
Is sucking my heart out of my mind
I'm outta time, I'm outta fucking time
I'm a gasoline gut with a Vaseline mind, but
Wanna disco? Wanna see me disco?
Let me hear you depoliticize my rhyme
(One, two, three, four)
You got what you been asking for
You're so policy free and
Your fantasy wheels and everything you think
And everything you feel
Is alright, alright, alright, alight, alright

I take you home, now watch me get you hot
You're just a parrot when you're screaming
And you're shouting
"More crackers, please, more crackers, please"
You want what you want but you don't wanna be on your knees
Who does your, who does your hair?

Who took the bomp from the bompalompalomp?
Who took the ram from the ramalamadingdong?
Who took the bomp from the bompalompalomp?
Who took the ram from the ramalamadingdong?
How are you?
Fine, thank you
How are you?
Fine, thank you

You bought a new van the first year of your band
You're cool and I hardly wanna say "not"
Because I'm so bored that I'd be entertained
Even by a stupid floor, a linoleum floor, linoleum floor
Your lyrics are dumb like a linoleum floor
I'll walk on it, I'll walk all over you
Walk on it, walk on it, walking one, two

(Who? Who? Who? Who?)
Who took the bomp from the bompalompalomp?
Who took the ram from the ramalamading-dong?
Who took the bomp from the bompalompalomp?
Who took the ram from the ramalamading-dong?
See you later
See you later
See you later
See you later
