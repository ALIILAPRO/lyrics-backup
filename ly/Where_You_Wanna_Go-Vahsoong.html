		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'll take you wherever
Where you wanna go
We can go Italy and see the snow
I'll get you some Gucci, you can take it home
Where you wanna go
He showed you a movie, I showed you the roads
Stealing really all I know
That's why I stole your heart
Cos mine is frozen
I'll take you wherever
Where you wanna go
We can go Italy and see the snow
I'll get you some Gucci, you can take it home
Where you wanna go
He showed you a movie, I showed you the roads
Stealing really all I know
That's why I stole your heart
Cos mine is frozen
22 ain't been my year
Shed a tear or two
Had to fight my fears
But it's right, cos I got you
And you got me and I got my beers
Now I smell like Gucci, Versace, whatever you want
I got your back so please don't front
B, tell all them boys go kiss your cunt
You don't know what it's like to be hungry
Cos I feed you 'fore I feed myself
The road is fucked, it's bumpy
But how else can I feed my wealth
I'm tryna take over the scene itself
Cos of how many months I sat on the shelf
They don't care bout my mental health
No one reached out when I cried for help
Where you wanna go
We can go Italy and see the snow
I'll get you some Gucci, you can take it home
Where you wanna go
He showed you a movie, I showed you the roads
Stealing really all I know
That's why I stole your heart
Cos mine is frozen
If you love me bitch, then prove it
Cos I do not fuck with Cupid
Wallah I know it sounds stupid
But B, I was raised to be ruthless
Mum put herself through hell
Just so we wouldn't be roofless
So I won't settle for anything less than the best
For the days that we went shoeless
Where you wanna go
We can go Italy and see the snow
I'll get you some Gucci, you can take it home
Where you wanna go
He showed you a movie, I showed you the roads
Stealing really all I know
That's why I stole your heart
Cos mine is frozen
