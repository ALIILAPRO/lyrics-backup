		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  "Hey, Mr. Superstar, I'll do anything for you
Hey, Mr. Superstar, I'm your number one fan"

"Hey, Mr. Porno Star, I-I-I-I want you
Hey, Mr. Sickly Star, I wanna get sick from you
Hey, Mr. Fallen Star, don't you know I worship you?
Hey, hey, Mr. Big Rock Star, I wanna grow up just like you"

I know that I can turn you on
I wish I could just turn you off
I never wanted this

"Hey, Mr. Super Hate, I just wanna love you
Hey, hey, hey, Mr. Super Fuck, I wanna go down on you
Hey, Mr. Super God, will you answer my prayers?
Hey, hey, hey, Mr. Superman, I wanna be your little girl"

I know that I can turn you on
I wish I could just turn you off
I never wanted this
I know that I can turn you
I wish I could just turn you
I never wanted any of this
I know that I can turn you
I wish I could just turn you
I never, never, never, never, never
Never, never wanted this

You could kill yourself on TV (I wish I was dead)
I wish you'd kill yourself on TV (I wish I was dead)
Will you kill yourself on TV? (I wish I was dead)
We'd like to see you dead (I wish I was dead)
Hey, Mr. Superstar, I'll kill myself for you
Hey, Mr. Superstar, I'll kill you, if I can't have you

Superstar, super fuck, baby
Superstar, super fuck, baby
Superstar, super fuck, baby
Superstar, super fuck, baby
Superstar, super fuck, baby
Superstar, super fuck, baby
Superstar, super fuck, baby
Superstar
