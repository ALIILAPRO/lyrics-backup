		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you were a teacher, I would fail your class
Take it over and over 'til you noticed me
If you were a waiting room, I would never see a doctor
I would sit there with my first aid kit and bleed
I wanna be the power ballad that lifts you up and holds you down
I wanna be the broken love song that feeds your misery
And I can wish all that I want, but it won't bring us together
Plus I know whatever happens to me, I know it's for the better

And when broken bodies are washed ashore
Who am I to ask for more, more, more?
But you're breathing in my open mouth
You're the gun in my lips that will blow my brains out
I wanna make you drive all night just because I said maybe you should come over
Wanna make you fall in love as hard as my poor parents' teenage daughter
She'll be the best you ever had if you let her

I know it's for the better
Know it's for the better
Know it's for the better
Know it's for the better
Know it's for the better
Know it's for the better
Know it's for the better
Know it's for the better
Know it's for the better
Know it's for the better
Know it's for the better
Know it's for the better
Know it's for the better
Know it's for the better
Know it's for the better
Know it's for the better
Know it's for the better
Know it's for the better
Know it's for the better
Know it's for the better
Know it's for the better
Know it's for the better
Know it's for the better
Know it's for the better
Know it's for the better
Know it's for the better
Know it's for the better
Know it's for the better
Know it's for the better
Know it's for the better
Know it's for the better
Know it's for the better
Know it's for the better
Know it's for the better
Know it's for the better
Know it's for the better
