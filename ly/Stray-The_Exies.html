		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Left alone with empty hands
Losing you is more than I can stand, I can't mend
Close my eyes, and made a wish
To lose myself so I'll forget about you it's no use

Swore to never ever leave you
To never let you out of my hands
Nothing here could ever change this
A promise til the living end
I swore I'd never stray from you

Broken bones, broken in half
I've come too far to start again
But I'm trying, I am trying
I'm sick of this , I'm sick of hurt
Shame is such a dirty word
I'm trying, I'm still trying

Swore to never leave you
To never let you out of my hands
Nothing here could ever change this
A promise til the living end
I never meant to be a liar
The shame is cutting into my skin
I'd rather die on my feet
Than live here on my knees again
I swore I'd never stray from you

Swore I'd never stray from you
