		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Bad blood)

The emptiness inside
I fell for your disguise
Our memories dragging me under
I wonder when I'll sleep at night
Will I catch me if I fall
Into the darkness that's pulling me down

Down, down, down, down

Oh, I swear, it's the last fucking time 
That I let you let me down (let me down)
Oh my Lord, I swear it's good fucking bye
I'll cut you out, now you're caught in a lie
And now we've got (bad blood)

Bad blood

All the lies you told stuck in my mind
All the broken souls you left behind
I'm drowning in misery
The fires burning in my veins
The love I felt has turned to pain
I'm ready, ready to give up
And save myself

You betrayed my trust
And you took it all from me

Oh, I swear, it's the last fucking time 
That I let you let me down (let me down)
Oh my Lord, I swear it's good fucking bye
I'll cut you out, now you're tryin' to lie
And now we've got (bad blood)

Why can't you just get the picture?
You left me bitter
All that's left is bad blood
(Bad blood)
Now you got me feeling hollow
Like there's no tomorrow
I'll cut you out for good
There's no one to forgive you

(No, no one to forgive you)
(No one to forgive)

Oh, I swear it's the last fucking time
I'll cut you out now you're caught in a lie
And now we got
(Bad blood)
(Bad blood)
(Bad blood)
(All we have is bad blood now)
