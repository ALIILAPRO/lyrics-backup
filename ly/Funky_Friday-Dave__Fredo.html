At this age
How are them man still hatin'?
My young boy in a different country
But he ain't ever been on vacation
One hand on a girl I'm datin'
One hand on the cash I'm makin'
We come through like Funky Friday
And have all of your mandem skatin'

I came in
550 on trainers
Island girl amazin'
Could be Bajan, Trini or Haitian
She got a bag with flowers
If the trainers match I'll take it
Me and bro just shut down Gucci
Had the whole of the shop floor waitin'
Who's that girl in the line
With the big behind that's lookin' all temptin'?
If her friend is a dead ting
Take one for the team with a bredrin
Two peng tings at the entrance
Want attention but a man can't let them
She must think I'm a reverend
You ain't comin' here gettin' redemption
No way

At this age
How are them man still hatin'?
My young boy in a different country
But he ain't ever been on vacation
One hand on a girl I'm datin'
One hand on the cash I'm makin'
We come through like Funky Friday
And have all of your mandem skatin'

I see dem man skatin' now
I'm talkin' about runnin' their legs
My youngins in country
Pluggin' the Z
He can't even buck me
'Til nothin' is left
I flooded my right
I flooded my left
I'm duckin' your wife
I'm duckin' the feds
The bell on the trap it's buzzin' again
But still I ain't tryin' to get busted by feds
Look, man, I ain't caught the bus in a sec'
It's me and my rambo cuttin' through West
The way that I went in just flooded my neck
I'm shocked that I ain't gotta struggle for breath
With me and the missus be going on dates
She's holdin' the dipper
I'm holdin' her waist
Just see some pigs movin' low in the mains
So I phoned up my nigga and told him the play

Tell a peng girl, "You can HMU"
I don't wanna cuddle and H-U-G
And I'm still shoppin' in HMV
For all of my niggas in HMP
Heard you got a girl goin' DMU
If I DM'd you would she DM me?
Young black brudda
I'ma stylish G
Man a put the IC in IC3

They tell me I'm gifted in rap
Nothin' was nice
Used to live in the trap
Now if I go ask that chick for her snap
I can bet money
She's giving me that
I'm always in Harrods
I'm fillin' a bag
Them niggas ain't winners
Them niggas are mad
Gyal at my vids
And them bitches are bad
They get picked in the foreigns
And ditched in the cab
