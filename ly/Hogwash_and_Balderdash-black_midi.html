		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hogwash and Balderdash
Chickens from the pen
Are coming down the rivers
Of Salafessien
Picking out fish bones
On unstable rafts
Checking every angle
Every foliage gap

"I can't keep this speed
The sun's too much"
"Balderdash settle!
You've just lost the touch"
This Hogwash he stood
And he licked fingers clean
While mocking his comrades
Admits to defeat
He kicked, he scolded
Pulled on low cheeks

Hogwash and Balderdash
Chickens from the pen
Surveying the beaches
Of Salafessien

Picking out the pebbles
And throwing them ashore
Checking every second
For men of the law
Hogwash stops and stares at the floor
"From where comes this stench that can't be ignored?"

Lucky for Balder his sweat escapes view
This being the origin of the aromatic stew
Which led to the following bellow of "Phew"
With his right on his nose, Hog's left hand claps Balder
Across his bare scalp as if to extract
His brain, thought submissive, that inside grows bolder
