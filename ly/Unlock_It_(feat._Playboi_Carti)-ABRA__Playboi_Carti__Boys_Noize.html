		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And I know what it's like when
It's fitting in just right
You can take it from the lock on this one, baby
I know what I want, just follow me on my way
You say you were going my way
It could be so easy and you, you could have it all
If you make me happy, baby, baby

Unlock it
You want me, unlock it
You ain't breaking in, just stop it
Don't just pick, boy, pop it
Unlock it, unlock it
Unlock it for me
You ain't got the shortcut
You got the key, unlock it
All the doors could open
You better knock, knock

Slatt
Hold up (wait)
Young Carti, Young Carti, Young Carti a diva (wait)
Yeah (yeah), I'm pouring the lean, I'm smoking that reefer
(What, what, what, what) yeah
Got tats on my body, I look like Khalifa
Yeah (hold on), just texted my shawty, I wanna come meet ya
Yeah, I go in the booth, yeah, and walk on a feature (what, yeah, whoa)
I'm topping the charts, yeah, we topping the meters (what, what)
Yeah, my baby say she don't fuck with these bitches, okay cool (cool)
I told her I don't fuck with these niggas either, okay cool (okay)
I could get them knocked off when I see 'em (what, what)
If ABRA point the bitch out, I'm gon' get 'em

Unlock it (what)
You want me, unlock it
You ain't breaking in, just stop it
Don't just pick, boy, pop it
Unlock it, unlock it
Unlock it for me
You ain't got the shortcut
You got the key, unlock it
All the doors could open (unlock it)
You better knock, knock
