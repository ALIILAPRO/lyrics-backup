		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What's the fee for shinin'?
Never rush the eye lid
No man could time this
The vibes are endless and timeless
It ain't no secret, baby, we the finest
Take the word 'live' and I redefine it
Put some more life behind it
Overcome the fear of dyin'

A heart of gold and a spirit of lion
Can't run away from the sex and violence
Take the word 'love' and I redefine it
Take the word 'love' and I redefine it
A heart of gold and a spirit of lion
Can't run away from the sex and violence
Take the word 'love' and I redefine it
My heart is yours, baby, if you can find it (you can find it)

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I say to live is to love and to love is to live
And I'm givin' them that vibe, so they loving the kid
They might jump for the kid, run for the kid
If they wanna be on this side, tell 'em love is the bridge
Got a couple that's ready to pop the trunk for the kid
And a couple that got some junk in the trunk for the kid
Like, mothers tellin' me how I'm saving their kids life
I'm becomin' a super hero in real life
Meeting strangers while I travel the globe
And I hug 'em like their one of my own and it just feels right
It's not enough for me to say that I'm known
If I can make you feel you're never alone, it makes me feel nice
Make me feel like I'm alive for a reason
And not just trapped in a cycle with the seasons
Like I'm something for the people to believe in (believe in)
Because I see them (see them, yeah)

A heart of gold and a spirit of lion
Can't run away from the sex and violence
Take the word 'love' and I redefine it
Take the word 'love' and I redefine it
A heart of gold and a spirit of lion
Can't run away from the sex and violence
Take the word 'love' and I redefine it
My heart is yours, baby, if you can find it (if you can find it)

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
