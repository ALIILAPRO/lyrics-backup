		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm in airplane mode, I don't need no drama
Everybody know I ain't 'bout that drama
Oh yeah, oh, look at what I started
I'ma tell you right now
I plan on chillin' so hard right now
Ain't takin' no calls right now

I'm kickin' back and I'm lightin' up
Doin' what the fuck I want
Just rolled a 'Wood, I'm feelin' good
Just me, myself and this blunt
Everything I do is way up, man
If anybody good I swear it's us, man
I'm vibin', I'm chillin', I'm good

I'm kickin' back
And I'm vibin', I'm chillin', I'm good
I'm kickin' back
And I'm vibin', I'm chillin', I'm good
I'm kickin' back and I'm (good)
I'm kickin' back and I'm (good)
I'm kickin' back
And I'm vibin', I'm chillin', I'm good
I'm kickin' back and I'm good

Everything good over here
Yeah, everybody know I ain't 'bout that drama
Everything good over here
Yeah, everybody know I ain't 'bout that drama
Oh yeah, oh, look what I started
I'ma tell you right now
I plan on chillin' so hard right now
Ain't takin' no calls right now

I'm kickin' back and I'm lightin' up
Doin' what the fuck I want
Just rolled a 'Wood, I'm feelin' good
Just me, myself and this blunt
Everything I do is way up, man
If anybody good I swear it's us, man
I'm vibin', I'm chillin', I'm good

I'm kickin' back
And I'm vibin', I'm chillin', I'm good
I'm kickin' back
And I'm vibin', I'm chillin', I'm good
I'm kickin' back and I'm (good)
I'm kickin' back and I'm (good)
I'm kickin' back
And I'm vibin', I'm chillin', I'm good
I'm kickin' back and I'm good

Man, first break in a minute
Can't remember not havin' goin' to work
Chillin' by my mama crib
Food smellin' bomb, man, I even went to church
Full tank in the whip
Goin' for a lil' drive can't hurt
Said, "I think I might just go for a ride
Then pop up and surprise the niggas that ain't heard from me"
And I know they be missin' me, I was busy as ever, it feel good to be on
It feel good to be smokin' with all my niggas
Thinkin' 'bout the shiy we used to be on
No lie, man, I really get the feeling that shit is comin' together
Good food, good weed 
Saw the fam I ain't seen, it couldn't get any better

I'm vibin', I'm chillin', I'm good
I'm kickin' back
And I'm vibin', I'm chillin', I'm good
I'm kickin' back and I'm (good)
I'm kickin' back and I'm (good)
I'm kickin' back
And I'm vibin', I'm chillin', I'm good
I'm kickin' back and I'm good

Man, do you understand
When I land the first thing I be thinkin' about
Is goin' to Roscoes
You feel what I'm sayin'?
Goin' to Simply Wholesome
Goin' to see my mama
Goin' to see my daddy
Goin' to the Fox Hill's mall
You know what I'm sayin'?
Goin' to Slauson Super Mall
And you know just chill with my family
