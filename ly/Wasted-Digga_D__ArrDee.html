		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
Don't get it twisted, you know
My dads from East
Which makes me a real geezer, fella
Someone get me a fucking Stella (yo)

Get me whiteboy wasted (yeah)
Get me lit, get me pissed, get me faded
Get the condoms, get the gal dem naked
Want the long john, it's the dick that she tasting (woi)
Now she hot like a basin (woi)
Don't say it, just save it (woi)
All my shoes got laces (woi)
Don't make badman blaze it (yeah)
Anytime that I jump on a beat like this
Gotta shout AJ cah that flow is his
Every other day I get stopped by CID's
Still mix Amnesia weed with cigs (the ammi smells)
This the loudest there is, is
I just snuck in my nizz, don't make me lock the ting, it's a chizz
Bubble that, double that, juggle that (woi)
Double back, double tap, rubble that (woi)
Shuffle back, unzip the duffle bag (woi, woi, woi)
Now-now he's in trouble, akh, shovel that
P's from that trap I don't trouble that (woi)
Put down my hunnid racks (woi)
JSav that my brother that, brother that
We ain't cheffing bro we're gunnin' that, gunnin' that

I-I ain't cheffing you, I shoot, I-I shoot my gun
If you try to run, I'm kweffing you, I-I shoot my gun
I ain't cheffing you, I shoot, I-I shoot my gun
If you try to run I'm kweffing you, I-I shoot my gun

Ayy, it's the morning, I'm still drunk
Fuck it
Ah

Ayy, white boy wasted crew and we roll in cars
Raggin' them like they're stolen
Barbies bleach blonde, Phil Foden
Makin' them scream that "It's comin' home" and that
I told Digga to roll with that (with that)
'Cause I'm so fucking off my nut, I might just lack
I don't shoot no wap, bear bottles get smashed
So let's have it (let's have it)
You don't wanna party with Arrdee, none of them hack it
It's litty for really, it's silly
If you got a drink and I see it, I'll back it
Necking it off just like the girl in my bed that I've got
Turn up with tugs and geezers', the lot
My own family think I've lost the plot, I don't give a toss
Leaving out breathing heavy, easy, steady (it's bait)
I don't know about stayin' out late, 'cause I party 'til the sun rises, boy
Have the cab man screaming (woi, woi, woi)
It's litty for really, a whole bag of noise
The vibes in the room but Digga's too loose
Heard man say

I-I ain't cheffing you, I shoot, I-I shoot my gun
If you try to run, I'm kweffing you, I-I shoot my gun
I ain't cheffing you, I shoot, I-I shoot my gun
If you try to run I'm kweffing you, I-I shoot my gun
