		  (DJ on the beat so it's a banger)

All this clout shit, you chasin' that, Balenciaga, space cadet
I don't even fuck with niggas, I'd just rather chase a check
Man, this shit so crazy, seen my idol with a fake Patek
I just sent my bitch to Bora Bora, cost me eighty racks
I'm the one, bitch asked me for a flight but she ain't ate it yet
I'ma hit that road and try to jam until I make it back
Can't no real nigga lie on they word and try to take it back
I might mix my Percocet with red, I can't find the Act'

Off a lot of pills, kissin' bitches, ew
Designer junkie, yeah, only top Chanel
Don't get caught with the scale, bronem died in the field, uh
We had to split our meals, went half for hotels, uh
Gotta watch your mans, that's the beauty of the streets
Look at me and my bitch, that shit Beauty and the Beast
Never call my phone about the opps 'cause ain't no peace
Man this shit for real, found out my homie, he police

All this clout shit, you chasin' that, Balenciaga, space cadet
I don't even fuck with niggas, I'd just rather chase a check
Man, this shit so crazy, seen my idol with a fake Patek
I just sent my bitch to Bora Bora, cost me eighty racks
I'm the one, bitch asked me for a flight but she ain't ate it yet
I'ma hit that road and try to jam until I make it back
Can't no real nigga lie on they word and try to take it back
I might mix my Percocet with red, I can't find the Act'

Funeral, suit and tie, I'll shoot for the guys
Takin' shrooms on me now, car go vroom on them now
I got groupies on me now, I got Gucci on me now
I put blood in Mashallah, I got kufis with me now
Feel like I'm dyin', I'm too high, Pluto died in the Chi
Got me ridin' around, hunnid rounds on him now, uh
Hunnid rounds on him now, Pluto died in the Chi
Pluto

All this clout shit, you chasin' that, Balenciaga, space cadet
I don't even fuck with niggas, I'd just rather chase a check
Man, this shit so crazy, seen my idol with a fake Patek
I just sent my bitch to Bora Bora, cost me eighty racks
I'm the one, bitch asked me for a flight but she ain't ate it yet
I'ma hit that road and try to jam until I make it back
Can't no real nigga lie on they word and try to take it back
I might mix my Percocet with red, I can't find the Act'
