		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Picture this
I'm a bag of dicks
Put me to your lips
I am sick
I will punch a baby bear in his shit
Give me lip
I'ma send you to the yard, get a stick, make a switch
I can end a conversation real quick

I am crack
I ain't lying, kick a lion in his crack
I'm the shit, I will fall off in your crib, take a shit
Pinch your momma on the booty, kick your dog, fuck your bitch
Fat boy dressed up like he's Santa and took pictures with your kids

We the best
We will cut a frowny face in your chest, little wench
I'm unmentionably fresh, I'm a mensch, get correct
I will walk into a court while erect, screaming 
"Yes! I am guilty motherfuckers, I am death"

Hey, you wanna hear a good joke?

Nobody speak, nobody get choked

Get running
Start pumping your bunions, I'm coming
I'm the dumbest, who flamethrow your function to Funyons
Flame your crew quicker than Trump fucks his youngest
Now face the flame fuckers your fame and fate's done with

I walk Charlie Brown, Peppermint Patty, Linus and Lucy
Put coke in the doobie roll moodies to smoke with Snoopy
I still remain that dick grabbing slacker that spit a loogie
'Cause the toter of the toolie'll murder you friggin' moolies
Fuck outta here, yeah

Nobody speak, nobody get choked, hey
Nobody speak, nobody get choked, hey
Nobody speak
Nobody speak

Only facts I will shoot up
Baby duck if it quacks, with a Ruger
Top billin', come cops and villainous 
Shots is blocked, shipped out, and bought, and you're feeling it
El-p killing it, Killer Mike killing shit

What more can I say? We top dealing it
Valiant without villainy
Viciously file victory
Burn towns and villages
Burning, looting and pillaging

Murderers try to hurt us we curse them and all their children
I just want the bread and bologna bundles to tuck away
I don't work for free, I am barely giving a fuck away

So tell beggin' Johnny and Mommy to get the fuck away
Hey yo, here's a gun, son, now run, get it the gutterway
Live to shoot another day

Nobody speak, nobody get choked, hey
Nobody speak, nobody get choked, hey
Nobody speak
Nobody speak
Nobody speak, nobody get choked
