		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everybody needs a glass of water today, to chase the hate away
You know you've got company coming over, so you scrub extra hard
And everybody needs somebody to love before it's too late, it's too late
Don't nobody want to grow older, right?
Everybody needs someone to rub their shoulders, scratch their dandruff
And everybody needs to quit actin' hard and shit
Before you get your ass whooped (I'll slap the fuck outta ya)
Everybody needs somebody to love before it's too late, it's too late

Love hater, love hater
Hater of love
Love hater, love hater
Hater of love
Love hater, love hater
Hater of love
Love hater
(Everybody needs someone to love)
(Everybody needs someone to love)
(Everybody needs someone to love)
