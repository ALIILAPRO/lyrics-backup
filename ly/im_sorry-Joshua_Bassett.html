		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I thought about what I would say
But I'm two years too late
I can't imagine how you doin' these days, mm
Sure it wasn't perfect back then
I'll be first to admit
But it was better than bein' strangers again, oh

I'm drunk too late, talkin' to the moon
Writin' songs I can't sing to you, 'cause

Ever since that day, the things I didn't say, they haunt me, oh
And I know that I'm to blame, so go ahead and blame it on me, oh
I know that I'm too late, but I'll say it anyway, I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
Though it's far too late

And it was me, it wasn't you
It's cliche, but it's true
I wasn't thinkin' how I usually do, oh
And is your mama doin' well?
Or does she hate me still?
Bet it was hard to watch me put you through hell

I'm drunk too late, talkin' to the moon, ooh
Writing songs I can't sing to you 'cause

Ever since that day, the things I didn't say, they haunt me, oh
I know that I'm to blame, so go ahead and blame it on me, oh
I know that I'm too late, but I'll say it anyway, I'm sorry
I'm sorry, mm
I'm sorry
Though it's far too late

And if you ever hear this
I hope you know that I'm not proud of who I've been
Ooh
And if I see you again
I hope you know that I wish you nothin' but the best
My biggest regret

Ever since that day, the things I didn't say, they haunt me
I know that I'm to blame, so go ahead and blame it on me, ooh
I know that I'm too late, but I'll say it anyway, I'm sorry
I'm sorry

Mm, I'm sorry
Oh, I'm sorry
