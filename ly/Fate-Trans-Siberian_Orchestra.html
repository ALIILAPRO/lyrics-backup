		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Faith and belief
And retreat
When you're standing all alone
With your dreams in the dark

Never knowing what is real
In the shadows you meet
Never knowing what is true
In the answers you seek
Never knowing if

Fate she hears me
Fate stand near me
Fate state clearly
Whether there will be another card

Retrieve us
Time deceives us
Faith she hears us
But she doesn't listen very hard

As she drifts through our lives
Tossing coins into the air
Watch them twist
Watch them fall
Turning hope into despair

Watch them twist
Watch them fall
Then she suddenly revives
Every dream that we've had
And we find ourselves
Alive

Believe me
Fate stands near me
Fate state clearly
Whether there will be another card

Receive us
Time deceives us
The only moment in our lives
That ever really mattered fate
Is now
