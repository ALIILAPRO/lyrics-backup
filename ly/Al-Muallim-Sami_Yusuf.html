		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We once had a Teacher
The Teacher of teachers,
He changed the world for the better
And made us better creatures,
Oh Allah we've shamed ourselves
We've strayed from Al-Mu'allim,
Surely we've wronged ourselves
What will we say in front him?
Ooh Mu'allim

He was Muhammad salla Allahu alayhi wa sallam,
Muhammad, mercy upon Mankind,
He was Muhammad salla Allahu alayhi wa sallam,
Muhammad, mercy upon Mankind,
Teacher of all Mankind.
Abal Qasim (one of the names of the Prophet)
Ya Habibi ya Muhammad
(My beloved O Muhammad)
Ya Shafi'i ya Muhammad
(My intercessor O Muhammad)
Khayru khalqillahi Muhammad
(The best of Allah's creation is Muhammad)

Ya Mustafa ya Imamal Mursalina
(O Chosen One, O Imam of the Messengers)
Ya Mustafa ya Shafi'al Alamina
(O Chosen One, O intercessor of the worlds)
Ya Mustafa ya Imamal Mursalina
Ya Mustafa ya Shafi'al Alamina
Ya Mustafa ya Imamal Mursalina
Ya Mustafa ya Shafi'al Alamina

He prayed while others slept
While others ate he'd fast,
While they would laugh he wept
Until he breathed his last,
His only wish was for us to be
Among the ones who prosper,
Ya Mu'allim peace be upon you,
Truly you are our Teacher,
Ooh Mu'allim.

He was Muhammad salla Allahu alayhi wa sallam,
Muhammad, mercy upon Mankind,
He was Muhammad salla Allahu alayhi wa sallam,
Muhammad, mercy upon Mankind,
Teacher of all Mankind

Ya Habibi ya Muhammad
(My beloved O Muhammad)
Ya Shafi'i ya Muhammad
(My intercessor O Muhammad)
Ya Rasuli ya Muhammad
(O My Messenger O Muhammad)
Ya Bashiri ya Muhammad
(O bearer of good news O Muhammad)
Ya Nadhiri ya Muhammad
(O warner O Muhammad)
Ishqu Qalbi ya Muhammad
(The love of my heart O Muhammad)
Nuru 'Ayni ya Muhammad
(Light of my eye O Muhammad)

He taught us to be just and kind
And to feed the poor and hungry,
Help the wayfarer and the orphan child
And to not be cruel and miserly,
His speech was soft and gentle,
Like a mother stroking her child,
His mercy and compassion,
Were most radiant when he smiled

He was Muhammad salla Allahu alayhi wa sallam,
Muhammad, mercy upon Mankind,
He was Muhammad salla Allahu alayhi wa sallam,
Muhammad, mercy upon Mankind,
Teacher of all Mankind

Abal Qasim (one of the names of the Prophet)
Ya Habibi ya Muhammad
(My beloved O Muhammad)
Ya Shafi'i ya Muhammad
(My intercessor O Muhammad)
Khayru khalqillahi Muhammad
(The best of Allah's creation is Muhammad)

Ya Mustafa Ya Imamal Mursalina
(O Chosen One O Imam of the Messengers)
Ya Mustafa ya Shafi'al Alamina
(O Chosen One O intercessor of the worlds)
Ya Mustafa ya Imamal Mursalina
Ya Mustafa ya Shafi'al Alamina
Ya Mustafa ya Imamal Mursalina
Ya Mustafa ya Shafi'al Alamina
Muallim!
