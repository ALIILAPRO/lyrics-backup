		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, well, well, well

Is it the way I move? Uh
That's why you think I'm bulletproof, uh
Or is it in my cool?
You think I'll put a spell on you
Boo

Oh, let it rain, woo
It won't rain on my parade
Oh, let it rain, woo
It won't rain on my parade

Take a mile in my shoes, oh
Bet you'll never shake the blues
Though it's heavy on my shoulder
Still you see me coming through, hey

Oh, let it rain, woo
It won't rain on my parade
Oh, let it rain, woo
It won't rain on my parade

Oh, let it rain
It won't rain on my parade
Oh, let it rain
It won't rain on my parade
