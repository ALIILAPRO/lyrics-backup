		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hard to stay focused on my own
A lot of times I feel all alone
Trippy drugs tonight we ain't stoned
I'm gone howling at moons in the night time Foreal
Drowning in my pain I won't float
Life is just some  mirrors and smoke
Somebody toss me a rope down here
We in hell to be clear we in hell to be clear
We in hell to be clear we in hell to be clear
Hard to stay focused on my own
A lot of times I feel all alone
Trippy drugs tonight we ain't stoned
I'm gone howling at moons in the night time Foreal
Drowning in my pain I won't float
Life is just some  mirrors and smoke
Somebody toss me a rope down here
We in hell to be clear we in hell to be clear
We in hell to be clear we in hell to be clear

Now I'm falling you cut the rope
Now I'm drowning but I can't choke
I sell myself short My anchors broke
Now I'm drowning but I'm afloat
The silence hurts me I'm full of dread
These four walls haunt me they want me dead
My time is ticking I cant think straight
I question myself am I a fake
Back to the better me
Back to a better dream
I got a tendency craft my
Raps with the Melodys
Studying the chemistry
Racks with fidelity allegedly
I snap accidentally
Smoke my dope sentimentally
I
Coat my throat with serenity
You
Cut my rope of identity
You
Took my hope and integrity
So I can't take this I'm not the same
Tears don't come with this sort of pain
Telling myself I'll be okay
Not so simple I'll stay at bay
I can't take this where is my home
I can't take this I'm all alone
I can't take this where is my rope
I can't take this
