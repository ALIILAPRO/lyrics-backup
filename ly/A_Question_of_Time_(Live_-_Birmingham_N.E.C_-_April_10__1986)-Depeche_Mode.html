		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've got to get to you first
Before they do
It's just a question of time
Before they lay their hands on you
And make you just like the rest
I've got to get to you first
It's just a question in time

Well, now you're only fifteen
And you look good
I'll take you under my wing
Somebody should
They've persuasive ways
And you'll believe what they say

It's just a question of time
And it's running out for you
It won't be long until you'll do
Exactly what they want you to

Yeah

Oh, I can see them now
Hanging around
To mess you up
To strip you down
And have their fun
With my little one

It's just a question of time
And it's running out for you
It won't be long until you'll do
Exactly what they want you to
It won't be long until you'll do
Exactly what they want you to

Yeah

Sometimes I don't blame them
For wanting you
You look good
They need something to do
Until I look at you
Then I condemn them
I know my kind
What goes on in their minds

It's just a question of time (yeah, yeah)
It's just a question of time (oh)
It's just a question of time (yeah, it should be better)
It's just a question of time (hey, it should be better with you)
It's just a question of time (it should be better)
It's just a question of time (it should be better with you)
It's just a question of time (it should be better)
It's just a question of time (it should be better with you)
It's just a question of time
