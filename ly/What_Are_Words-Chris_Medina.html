		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Anywhere you are
I am near
Anywhere you go
I'll be there
Anytime you whisper my name
You'll see
Every single promise I'll keep
'Cause what kind of guy
Would I be
If I was to leave
When you need me most

What are words if you really
Don't mean them when you say them
What are words if they're only
For good times then that's all
When it's love ya you say them
Out loud these words
They never go away
They live on
Even when we're gone

And I know an angel was sent
Just for me and I know I'm meant
To be where I am and I'm gonna be
Standing right beside her tonight
And I'm gonna be by your side
I would never leave when she needs me most

What are words if you really
Don't mean them when you say them
What are words if they're only
For good times then that's all
When it's love ya you say them
Out loud these words
They never go away
They live on
Even when we're gone

Anywhere you are
I am near
Anywhere you go
I'll be there
And I'm gonna be here forever more
Every single promise I'll keep
'Cause what kind of guy would I be
If I was to leave
When you need me most
I'm forever keeping my angel close
