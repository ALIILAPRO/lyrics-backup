		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My hearts been colder
My devastations been waiting for me
We hit the gas and we going
We both got places to be
You keep on mixing the things that I want
With things that I need
We mix the colors in cups
No rush just control the speed

Please leave us alone, yeah
Won't, won't pick up the phone, yeah
She young and she grown, yeah
Won't, won't pick up the phone, yeah
Won't pick up the phone, yeah
Won't pick up the phone
Won't pick up the phone, yeah
Won't pick up the phone

I'm tired of the week
I'm tired of the screen
Please pass me a bean, yeah
I'm feeling up keen, need summer time heat
Need you next to me, yeah
Our summer see Gs that's double
Might turn up on the scene that's trouble
No fiend but I need me a couple
For the team throw racks in the duffle
Our summer see Gs that's double
Might turn up on the scene that's trouble
(Ay, oh) no fiend but I need me a gobble
For the team throw racks in the duffle

Please leave us alone, yeah
Won't, won't pick up the phone, yeah
She young and she grown, yeah
Won't, won't pick up the phone, yeah
Won't pick up the phone, yeah
Won't pick up the phone
Won't pick up the phone, yeah
Won't pick up the phone

When I'm up then I tend to get cold
On ways and I'm feeling my zone
So many bills that the wallet can't fold
So many feels that the feelings can't hold
Mirrors on the ceiling they go
Do it for me clinching my toes, whoa
Always finna play in that snow
Never finna answer that phone, ay, oh

My hearts been colder
My devastations been waiting for me
We hit the gas and we going
We both got places to be
You keep on mixing the things that I want
With things that I need
We mix the colors in cups
No rush just control the speed

Please leave us alone, yeah
Won't, won't pick up the phone, yeah
She young and she grown, yeah
Won't, won't pick up the phone, yeah
Won't pick up the phone, yeah
Won't pick up the phone
Won't pick up the phone, yeah
Won't pick up the phone
Please leave us alone, yeah
Won't, won't pick up the phone, yeah
She young and she grown, yeah
Won't, won't pick up the phone, yeah
Won't pick up the phone, yeah
Won't pick up the phone
Won't pick up the phone, yeah
Won't pick up the phone

My hearts been colder
My devastations been waiting for me
My hearts been colder
My devastations been waiting for me
