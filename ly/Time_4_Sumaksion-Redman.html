		  Ninety-ninety-motherfuckin'-two
Straight from Jersey, the Philly blunt lives on
Yo, B, tell 'em how this shit goin' down

Time, time for some, time for some action
Time, time for some, time for some action
Time, time for some, time for some action (come on)
Time, time for some, time for some action (yeah)
Time, time for some, time for some action
Time, time for some, time for some action
Time, time for some, time for some action
Time, time for some, time for some action (lights, camera, action)
Time, time for some, time for some action (let's get ready to rumble)

In this corner, we have the funk bodysnatcher
P-Funkadelic and I gat ya (uh-huh)
Hard enough that I can chew a whole bag of rocks
Chew an avenue, chew an off street and off block
Then turn around and do the same damn thing to a soloist
'Cause Reggie Noble's pissed
I crush the whole brain frame
'Cause you couldn't maintain the funk
That have your rap style for lunch, chump (uh-huh)
'Cause '92, I take a whole crew
Give 'em a punch of the funk, knock all of their gold tooth loose (wow)
To show you what type of stuff I'm on
You can't puff or sniff it because I was born with it
The Funkadelic devil, hit you with the rap level of ten
Then one, two, three, you're pinned
I get action, so everybody jump wit your rump
If you like the way the sound bump, pump it in your back trunk
And let loose with the juice when I do rock
I'm too hot, some say I got more juice than 2pac
(Straight outta Jersey) You heard me, my brother
I'm laughin', time for some action

Time, time for some, time for some action
Time, time for some, time for some action (yeah)
Time, time for some, time for some action
Time, time for some, time for some action
Time, time for some, time for some action
Time, time for some, time for some action (uh-huh)
Time, time for some, time for some action
Time, time for some, time for some action (yeah)
Time, time for some, time for some action

Lights, camera, cock back the hammer
Straight from the land of the lost
I'ma hit you with the funk force
That makes you run your rap style back to the crack vile
Brotha, then strike a pose like Madonna
My mom's kicked me out because I did what I want to
The original P-Funk, chump, dump a trunk of funk
In your skull caps, 'cause my jaw snaps with the raw rap
So color me bad, plus color me black
For the funk that I pack, Red, freak it to the funk track
(The funky fly stuff)
Come on and let me kick
(The funky fly stuff)
Just to show you where the hell I come from
I get dumb with the 1, 1-2
Check my rep, I'm a hit when I have sex (like this)
Make you twist to the mist
Of a funky brain cell when it's puffed on a spliff
And all that, the hi hat, go buy that
Listen, look, oops, brother, where your eyes at?
They on the floor, pick 'em up
While I pour a lil funk down your brain, punk
Listen to my name, chump (Redman ready to rock)
I got a Glock
Then, pow, your body is all over the block
Tryin' to step to the, the exorcist, kick it
I get mad wicked when Twin cocks the biscuit
And blow your head off, just for askin'
"Who's the one rappin?" (Poo-pow)
Time for some action

Time, time for some, time for some action
Time, time for some, time for some action
Time, time for some, time for some action
Time, time for some, time for some action (uh)
Time, time for some, time for some action (yeah)
Time, time for some, time for some action
Time, time for some, time for some action
Time, time for some, time for some action
Time, time for some, time for some action

Yo, 1992, Redman gets paid (yeah)
Yeah, know what I'm sayin'?
We not goin' for the okey-doke, believe that
Hit Squad is definitely in the house (in the house)
For the brothers that don't be knowin', what's up?
Word is bond, I gotta show them the flava

Back to the funk track like Black Sheep
My man jump say, uh
"Who's the Redman? Where's the Redman?"
I kill, I smother, I get down with the (yo, yo, yo, chill)
Yo, yo, Red, yo, chill, G
Chill, akh
It's over, man
Yo, you don't gotta say no more, it's over
