		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ain't gonna love you all through the morning
Ain't gonna love you all through the morning
Yeah, see 'em going where I been, know how you feel
Ain't gonna love you all through the morning
Ain't gonna love you all through the morning

I see you going where I been
I know how you feel
Was at the same place you are now in
You shouting, announcing, you wanna win
With similar minded men with great business acumen
We can make an acquisition till the topic turn 
From tight pockets to high profits
To life insurance, at what age do we all cop it?
Fuck who the hottest
Who really stand up?
Who really messing with they dead man girl?
That says everything about that man world
Energy transferral, immortality
You against morality, don't come around me
Homicidal, vinyl section, where they always found me
By the motion picture soundtrack with Richard Roundtree on the album sleeve
That's my era shit
Musical excellence
Hot like on a detective list
It's simple shit that's keeping you from the shift
You a simp, a trick, or in love with your own dick
Distractions, they come in all ways

I just keep it calm, watching it all play out
Like it's supposed to, old dudes playing chess in the park
Old dudes playing chess in prison
Staying on good behavior for extra visits
If they was to switch places, could you tell the difference?
It's perspective, isn't it?
A team that's militant
A down ass woman by your side that get it in
The realest, I love this feeling

If you don't have a team that's militant you better be brilliant
I love this feeling
If you don't' have no team that's militant, be mentally equipped
I love this feeling
Watch everybody, that's why I love my team
I love this feeling
Keep calm but watch everything

It's your monthly subscription to the slums edition
The new 'It Was Written'
Get your hard copies of Blockology
Coming from the one who lived in a bowl for goldfish
I never sell my soul, just evolved, shock rap
That what you never been told shit
Cold part, Illmatic all through that episode of Ozark
I think that's harder than if I had co-starred
A ghetto symphony, I'm Chief Keef Cozart, mixed with Mozart
It's ill when you get bags for your own art
Million dollar synch for Al Jarreau of Rap
But they ain't understand it when it dropped, yo, how cold is that?
They asking if I'm ever gon' be over rap
But I left a few times, just never told you that
Amassing digital assets
No fiscal year kickbacks, yeah, we cashing
Physical money think different, we outlast 'em
We outclass 'em, they made it easy to pass 'em
I love this feeling

I just keep it calm, watching it all play out
Like it's supposed to, old dudes playing chess in the park
Old dudes playing chess in prison
Staying on good behavior for extra visits
If they was to switch places, could you tell the difference?
It's perspective, isn't it?
A team that's militant
A down ass woman by your side that get it in
The realest, I love this feeling

Everyday we do whatever we want, can't front, yo'
I love this feeling
Getting dressed, getting fly just to go to the studio, ayo
I love this feeling
Ayo, tomorrow I'm juicing, juicing for the rest of the week, just because
I love this feeling
And big bro got his ankle bracelet took off today, yo
We getting on a private jet
I love this feeling

Yeah, I love this feeling
