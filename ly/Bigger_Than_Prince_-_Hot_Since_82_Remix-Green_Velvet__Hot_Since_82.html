		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Walk around like you're bigger than Prince
Walk around like you're bigger than Prince
Walk around like you're bigger than Prince
Walk around like you're bigger than Prince
Walk around like you're bigger than Prince
Walk around like you're bigger than Prince

Some people have problems
You wont be able to solve them
There is no need to fuzz
You just

Walk around like you're bigger than Prince
Walk around like you're bigger than Prince
Walk around like you're bigger than Prince
Walk around like you're bigger than Prince
Walk around like you're bigger than Prince

Talk about you on YouTube
Not like you to look good
Look at you with disgust
You just

Walk around like you're bigger than Prince
Walk around like you're bigger than Prince
Walk around like you're bigger than Prince

Don't listen to what people to say
When what they say is crazy
In God we trust
You just

Walk around like you're bigger than Prince
Walk around like you're bigger than Prince
Walk around like you're bigger than Prince
Walk around like you're bigger than Prince

Walk around like you're bigger than Prince

Some people have problems
You wont be able to solve them
There is no need to fuzz
You just

Walk around like you're bigger than Prince
Walk around like you're bigger than Prince
Walk around like you're bigger than Prince
Walk around like you're bigger than Prince
Walk around like you're bigger than Prince
