		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (I'm tryna fuckin' record this)
(Sorry)

I've got a shotgun tongue
And tick like a time bomb
All black everything
I've got a switchblade wit
That cuts like a bitch
And I think you two should meet (hello?)

I wanna break free from my humanity
I wanna release the animal in me
B-b-b-break free your curiosity
You're gonna give me what I need (I need)

I've got blood on my hands
No guilt on my conscience
The war in your path, the sex in your violence
All of my flaws, I wear 'em with honor
A purple heartbreak for all we've suffered

I am the enemy
I am the enemy
I am the enemy
(Here to save the day)
I'll be the enemy, e-e-e-enemy
I'll be the enemy, enemy, enemy

(I got a brand new)
(I got a brand new)
(I got a brand new, brand new numb)

I'm in your blindspot
God while I get your rocks off
Worship to the beat (brand new numb)
I wanna thank you, come again, that was great, do you need a receipt?

I wanna break free from my humanity
I wanna release the darker side of me
B-b-b-break free your curiosity
You're gonna give me what I need (I need)

Yeah, I've still got blood on my hands, no guilt on my conscience
The war in your path, the sex in your violence
All of my flaws, I wear 'em with honor
A purple heartbreak for all we've suffered

I am the enemy
I am the enemy
I am the enemy
(Here to save the day)
I'll be the enemy, e-e-e-enemy
I'll be the enemy, enemy, enemy

(I got a brand new)
(I got a brand new)
(I got a brand new, brand new numb)
(I got a brand new)
(I got a brand new)
(I got a brand new, brand new numb)

Give me liberty or death
Charge me more and pay me less
I said give me liberty or death
(Ah, fuck it, just give me death)
(Let's go, yeah)
(This one's for the underdogs)

I've got blood on my hands, no guilt on my conscience
The war in your path, your mind is the target
All of my flaws, I wear 'em with honor
A purple heartbreak for all we've suffered

I am the enemy
I am the enemy
I am the enemy
(Brand new numb)
I'll be the enemy, e-e-e-enemy
I'll be the enemy (brand new numb)
