		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm only human
Tryna find the parts that I lost
How did I lose them?
Fade away with time, one by one

When the sparks don't fly, we hit the ground
And when we close our eyes we hear the sound

Of sinners in the dark
A woman crying blue
Tryna find the start
Looking for the truth
Another beating heart
Tryna get to you

But when the sparks don't fly, we hit the ground
But when the sparks don't fly, we hit the ground

Sparks don't fly
We fall
Sparks don't fly
We fall

I feel the tide move
See it running away
From my feet
I wanna break through
Is there anyone else?
Only me

When the sparks don't fly, we hit the ground
And when we close our eyes we hear the sound

But when the sparks don't fly, we hit the ground

Ooh

Sparks don't fly
We fall
