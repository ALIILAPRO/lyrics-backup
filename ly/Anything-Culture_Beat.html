		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Is there anything more I can do for you 
Should my hair be red, or shall it blue? 
Is there anything more I can do for you 
Shall I let the green grass turn black for you? 
Is there something more you want me to do 
Shall I hand up all my secrets to you 
Maybe then you'll see me too 
Is there something more? 
Yeah yeah yeah... 

You got me on my knees, saying please are you a tease 
You change locks, so I change keys 
Giving, always giving, how ya living it's a drain 
Hard to see the light as anything but a train 
Is passion out of fashion, am I on the wrong track 
Hard for me to take but you can tell me what I lack 
Been the early bird but I gets no worm 
Treat me like a germ, but I still stand firm 
Chasing am I wasting all my time on the cause 
Do you want a break or do you need a pause 
Never knew no one like you that is never impressed 
Is it how I'm dressed huh, or am I just a pest 
I think you bend me just to see if I will break 
Evasion from the case, just to see what I will take 
Lead me, lead me on, because you know I want to swing 
Question that I'm pressing, is there anything 

Do you want a break or do you need a pause 
Do you want a break or do you need a pause 
Do you want a break or, do you want to break or do you need a pause 
And the beat keeps going on... 

Hard for me to take but you can tell me what I lack 
Wanting what you flaunting, can't blame me for my thirst 
Betcha got a bubble, baby, begging to be burst 
Hopin' while I'm scopin', dirty mind is in effect 
Rigorous and vigorous how you turn my neck 
Heated now I'm hotter for your hips, put me on 
Sweat ya in the eve, sweat ya in the morn 
Yearning yeah, I'm yearning, got an itch, need a scratch 
Money I can make, but it's hard to make a match 
Craving what you're saying, waiting for your will to cave in 
Read me like a book, I'm misbehaving 
Tell me what you need and your need I'll try to feed 
Hear me as I beg, hear me as I plead 
Runaway, run all day but you can't hide 
I see you're fighting feelings that you feel inside 
Tell me want I want and I'll tell you what I bring 
The question from the King, is there anything
