		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Pay to kill, die to lose 
Hunted, hunter, which are you?
Diablo, come again 
To make trophies out of men
Lose your skin, lose your skull
One by one the sack is full
In the heat dehydrate 
Know which breath will be your last

Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide 
You've got to kill to stay alive
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide 
You've got to kill to stay alive

Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain

Human heart, human mind 
Intellect intertwined
Focus sharp in the night 
Watch the jungle burning bright
Toe to toe, throw the line 
Everyone's caught hands tied
Iron will, iron fist 
How could it have come to this?

Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide 
You've got to kill to stay alive
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide 
You've got to kill to stay alive

Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain

Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain
