		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I ain't got no friends
Except the voices inside my head
They keep telling me that this make believe
World does not exist

But I'm doing my best
To keep the water below my chin
It may recede, but it's hard to breathe
When that tide rises again

It's all the same
Nothing will ever change
Blue or red alive or dead
It's all the same to me

So much is said
By peddlers of revilement
Their illusion of choice
Takes away our voice
Til we're silenced in the end

It's all the same
Nothing will ever change
Blue or red alive or dead
It's all the same to me

It's all the same
Nothing will ever change
Blue or red alive or dead
It's all the same to me

It's all the same
Nothing will ever change
Blue or red alive or dead
It's all the same to me
