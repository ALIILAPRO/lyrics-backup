		  SCARS OF WINTER  AND MY DOUBTS
ON THIS SATURDAY MORNING
WELL, I DON'T NEED EM BUT SOMEHOW
I END UP CAUGHT IN THE WARNINGS

OH THERE'S A THUNDERSTORM
KNOCKING AT MY DOOR! 
HOW CAN YOU LOOK INTO MY EYES,
AND TELL ME NOTHING ELSE THAN LIES?

AND NOW IT'S EASIER
AND NOW IT'S EASIER
TO RUNAWAY AND HIDE
WHO WANTS TO SAY GOODBYE...?

AND NOW IT'S EASIER
IT'S ALWAYS EASIER
TO HOLD YOUR HEAD UP HIGH
THAN OPEN UP YOUR HEART

KNIVES OF WATER FROM MY EYES
NOW I'M FEELING SO LONELY
WHILE I'M DROWNING WITH THE TIDE
I STILL REMEMBER THOSE WARNINGS

OH, THERE'S A THUNDERSTORM
KNOCKING AT MY DOOR! 
HOW CAN YOU LOOK INTO MY EYES,
AND TELL ME NOTHING ELSE THAN LIES?

AND NOW IT'S EASIER
AND NOW IT'S EASIER
TO RUNAWAY AND HIDE
WHO WANTS TO SAY GOODBYE?

AND NOW IT'S EASIER
IT'S ALWAYS EASIER
TO HOLD YOUR HEAD UP HIGH
THAN OPEN UP YOUR HEART

AND NOW IT'S EASIER

AND NOW IT'S EASIER
AND NOW IT'S EASIER
TO RUNAWAY AND HIDE
WHO WANTS TO SAY GOODBYE?

AND NOW IT'S EASIER
IT'S ALWAYS EASIER
TO HOLD YOUR HEAD UP HIGH
THAN OPEN UP YOUR HEART

AND NOW IT'S EASIER
