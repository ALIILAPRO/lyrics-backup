		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hit it!
Shake that ass, make your baby daddy mad (hit it!)
Shake that ass, make your baby daddy mad (hit it!)
Shake that ass, make your baby daddy mad (hit it!)
(Hit it, hit it!) DJ, let's go

It takes two to make a thing go right
But it takes three to meet outside
It takes two to make a thing go right
But it takes three to meet outside

I wanna rock right now
It's Mr. Worldwide and I came to get down
All ready internationally known and
Your boys known to rock to globe
Cause, I get loose, I mean outrageous
Yeah, I get loose, nothing rough, blue faces
Catch me in a suit at a NASCAR race
Trackhouse ride for love in championship place
Girls love me, mamis adore me
No social media, but, baby, you can call me
Y esto es para todo' lo' latino en el mundo
Siempre primero, nunca segundo, dale

It takes two to make a thing go right
But it takes three to meet outside
It takes two to make a thing go right
But it takes three to meet outside

Name's Armando, but the world calls me Pit
Cuban from Miami, love the state, I'm the mix
Here's an idea that I wanna share
You don't like me, fuck you, I don't care
NÃºmero uno and I cruise like a Top Gun
She's a hot one and blows like a shotgun
Hustle dream house in the Keys, got one
Looking for a hit, my dawg, she don't got some
Not a follower, I'm a leader
Nah, I'm not a gangsta, but I drop you like Adidas
My name clean, so I don't need a bodyguard
Not a lawyer, but you can meet me at the bar

It takes two to make a thing go right
But it takes three to meet outside
It takes one to make everything alright
But it takes three to meet outside
