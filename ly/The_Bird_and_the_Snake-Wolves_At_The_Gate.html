		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The morning is coming with a hunger to feed
I'll do what I've got to get the taste that I need
Minute by minute and hour by hour
I'll feed this pit with what I find and all I can scour

Give me a feather and I'll trade you my friend
It's just a single feather dear
It won't be the end
Watch and you'll learn young one
I'm not what you think
I'll give you all you'd ever want
To eat and to drink

Too far to run
Too hard to fly away
There's got to be a better way
Too far to run
Too hard to fly away
A feather's small to give away

One was the deal before but now I want three
So if you want to get your fix
You'll have to agree
Don't you fret now don't you fear
You've still got much to give
I'll keep my word if you keep yours
You still need me to live

Too slow to run
Too weak to fly away
I'm tired living day to day
Too slow to run
Too weak to fly away
How much will I have to pay? 

Fool don't you see, you haven't a choice
No one will listen, hear out your voice
You're lost and accursed
Lost and accursed
You're dying of thirst
Stop with your fighting, I'm all you've got
None hear your crying
You're hooked and caught
Was three, now it's six
Come get your fix

Too scared to run
Too nerved to fly away
I once was friend but now the prey
Too scared to run
Too nerved to fly away
Will he save or will he slay? 

Submit yourselves, then, to God
Resist the devil, and he will flee from you
Draw near to God and He will draw near to you
Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts

It's the last time that you'll get me
It's the last time that you'll get me
Me
It's your last one so now I'm free
It's your last one so now I'm free
Free

He was a murderer from the beginning
He does not stay to the truth cause there is no truth in him
Whenever he speaks a lie, he speaks from his own nature
For he is a liar, the father of lies

No! All you've brought me is pain and grief
All you've brought me is pain and grief
Grief
No! You deceptive and lying thief
You deceptive and lying thief
Thief

No!
No!
No!
No!

"Thank you my friend and now I'll say my goodbye
As these fangs sink in
You'll sleep and I'll watch as you die."
