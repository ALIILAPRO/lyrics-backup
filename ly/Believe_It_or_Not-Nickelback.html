		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Believe it or not, everyone have things that they hide
Believe it or not, everyone keep most things inside
Believe it or not, everyone believes in something above
Believe it or not, everyone needs to feel loved
Feel loved
But know that we won't until we figure out

Could someone deliver us and send us some kind of sign
So close to giving up cause faith is so hard to find
You know that you won't until we figure out

I've seen it a lot, every time the world turns upside down
Believe it or not, most of us feel like we're losing ground
Believe it or not, everyone hates admitting fear
Believe it or not, most of us want to know why we're here
Why we're here
But we know that we won't until we figure out

Could someone deliver us and send us some kind of sign
So close to giving up cause faith is so hard to find
Someone deliver us and send us some kind of sign
So close to giving up cause faith is so hard to find
But you don't and you won't until we figure out

Most of us have nothing to complain about
Most of us have things we could live without
Everyone needs advice on how to get along
You know we won't until we figure out

Believe it or not, everyone
Everyone, everyone

Believe it or not, everyone have things that they hide
Believe it or not, everyone keep most things inside
Believe it or not, everyone believes in something above
Believe it or not, everyone needs to feel loved
Feel loved
But you know we won't until we figure out

Could someone deliver us and send us some kind of sign
So close to giving up cause faith is so hard to find
Someone deliver us and send us some kind of sign
So close to giving up cause faith is so hard to find
But you know that you won't until we figure out
You know that you won't until we figure out
