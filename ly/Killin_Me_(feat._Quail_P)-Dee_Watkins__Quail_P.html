		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Know what I'm saying
You Know I get in that mode
Know what I'm saying
Yeah
I ain't wit it today don't say shit to me
I got niggas locked up and its killing me
I was broke and them bitches wasn't feeling me
You a ho you got bitch nigga tendencies
This a message to all of my enemies
When its up bitch its stuck ain't no sympathy
Keep a glizzy they trying to get rid of me
Name another young nigga thats real as me
What we got put you out of your miseries
It don't take much to just feel the beat
All these nigga keep talking bout killin me
Thats a quick way to end up deceased
We will light this bitch up like a Christmas tree
I been rolling I'm drinking this Hennessy
Say my name ringing bells way in Tennessee
But I'm still in the hood where my niggas be
Better tell a nigga watch it
I ain't trying to talk to you if ain't bout a profit
Cash getting long it ain't fitting in my wallet
Nigga cock blocking bout a bitch better stop it
Know this shit bout to change going up like a rocket
My name running game now I'm the trending topic
Niggas trying to cop it
Why you out here jocking
You better stop it
Before we come and cock it
Uh yeah
we get it popping don't lose your life for acting to cocky
I'm with the gang and this bitch like the nazi
Talk like you hard boy you softer than cotton
I kicked the door down cause they tried to lock it
When I come around my shit Ima pop it
Learn how to get money and turn to hobby
I keep a weapon I see how they watching me
You know I always thought this shit was justgon' be a dream forever
Until we turn it to a reality you know
A lifestyle we major now
We global
Back to the facts
Go get you some racks
I told her don't get attached
I just want to beat your lil' back in
Stop all that cappin' uh
I ain't with that acting uh
You niggas be rapping
I gotta keep me a mac 10
The only thing I trust is a scale yeah
RIP blood wish you well yeah
This shit stuck my heart like a nail yeah
This is real life ain't no tale yeah
Remember 3rd grade I had failed yeah
Now look at my life living well yeah
Why these niggas all up on my trail yeah
It ain't nothing else I gotta sell yeah
I had to thank the lord hallelujah
Pain turned a nigga to a shooter
Every nigga round me will do you
I was 15 fucking on a cougar
Mama say son I can't lose you
I apologize for everything I put you
Its kind of hard to look at you
But i swear a nigga will get cooked bout you
Why do you feel like you hard
We already know you a narc
Said a nigga up to catch a charge
Trying to stop the boy from living large
Live my life it will rip you apart
I ain't know this would be from the start
Look at me at the top of the charts
This ain't regular rap this an art
