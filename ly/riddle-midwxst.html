		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  La-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm

It's hard but I can understand
Think I'm sinking in the sand
All my fingers started shaking
Got some tremors in my hand
I won't take another chance
I won't fall into your trance
I don't wanna see your face
Near me ever damn again, no
Thoughts run through my brain every single night
Always happens, don't know why I seem to try
Might succumb, at this point I don't wanna fight
Running outta words I can say, wish that I could write

I've been stuck in the middle
I don't wanna hear your lies, know that you gon' belittle
You been tearin' me apart, baby, little by little
I don't even wanna start tryna solve all your riddles
Oh, it happens every damn day
Sittin' down with all my memories, I watch them decay
I don't wanna hear you speak, 'cause I know you will not change
So don't say you ever knew me, 'cause you don't know my pain

I don't wanna see your face, I don't want to hear you call
I don't wanna run into you when I'm walkin' through the hall
I just wish that you could disappear, don't wan' see you at all
I could never seem to stop anything, even if I stalled
And I tried, tried, tried, but I always seem to fail
Watch you lie, lie, lie your life away and tell your tales
Wanna run, run, run, run away and leave no trail
Watched the tears slowly fall upon my newly painted nails
Say I'm fine, so you don't worry, gotta get away, in a hurry
Vision hazy, gettin' blurry, either way, I gotta scurry
Never knew that you would hurt me when we started flirtin'
Didn't know for certain, it's time to close the curtains

I've been stuck in the middle
I don't wanna hear your lies, know that you gon' belittle
You been tearin' me apart, baby, little by little
I don't even wanna start tryna solve all your riddles
Oh, it happens every damn day
Sittin' down with all my memories, I watch them decay
I don't wanna hear you speak, 'cause I know you will not change
So don't say you ever knew me, 'cause you don't know my pain
