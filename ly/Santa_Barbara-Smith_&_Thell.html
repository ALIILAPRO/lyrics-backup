		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh Santa Barbara
Part the clouds in my mind
There's so much more you can find
leaving LA behind

Oh Santa Barbara
You are just what I need
Drinking wine by the sea
Getting drunk by the beach

Purple heart trail
Sing for me, sing for me
Purple heart trail
Tell me where do you lead
Purple heart trail
Guess it's where all the broken hearts meet
So sing for me

Oh Santa Barbara
Can I tell you the truth
I feel homesick and blue
My only friend here is you

Oh Santa Barbara
I'm not made for that town
I've seen the beauty queen crowns
Passing fame round and round

Purple heart trail
Sing for me, sing for me
Purple heart trail
Tell me where do you lead
Purple heart trail
Guess it's where all the broken hearts meet
So sing for me

I'm a lucky one
I'm a lucky one
Far away in California
Yeah I bought the hoax
Like a horoscope
Through the sticky smoke
Now I'm lost in California

Purple heart trail
Sing for me, sing for me
Purple heart trail
Tell me where do you lead
Purple heart trail
Guess it's where all the broken hearts meet
So sing for me

Oh Santa Barbara
Part the clouds in my mind
There's so much more I wanna find
I'm leaving LA behind
