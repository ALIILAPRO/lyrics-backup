		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My mind is a galaxy
I don't need the shallow
See, now would be the time to tell
If you're afraid to swim deep
Are you afraid to swim deep?
'Cause these waves have taken years to make and
I don't just give them away to anybody
To anybody

Let's see how close you can get to me, get to me
Without placing your hands on my body
How close will you get to me?
But I won't let it get to me, get to me
If you don't love me the way that you ought to
The way that you ought to

It's just the way that they taught you
(Intimacy, intimacy, intimacy)
It's just the way that they taught you
(Intimacy, intimacy, intimacy)
It's just the way that they

My mind is a battlefield
I don't need to tell you
How badly I shake whenever you
Pull me too close
'Cause I'm afraid to say no

'Cause these walls have taken
Years to break and
I don't just tear them away for anybody
But you're not just anybody

Let's see how close you can get to me, get to me
Without placing your hands on my body
How close will you get to me?
But I won't let it get to me, get to me
If you don't love me the way that you ought to, oh

It's just the way that they taught you
(Intimacy, intimacy, intimacy)
It's just the way that they taught you
(Intimacy, intimacy, intimacy)
It's just the way that they taught you
(Intimacy, intimacy, intimacy)
It's just the way that they taught you
(Intimacy, intimacy, intimacy)
It's just the way that they
It's just the way that they
