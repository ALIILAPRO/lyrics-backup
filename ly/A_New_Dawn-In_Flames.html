		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I dreamed that you had died 
I'm forever alone 
I'm weakened, I'm frightened 
This place's about to change 
Things you said to me 
Believe and the things you might find 
Will turn into a march 

I stand alone and breathe again 
I won't stop until this is through 

And I can't wait to see the sunrise again 
(It's moments like this) 
I am what you'll never be 
To better what I am 
You won't hear lies from me 

Feel the sudden aches 
Time to get moving 
Getting somewhere with no directions 
I swear to you it will never be the same 
It's astray, but the road lies open 
Leaving all deaths behind 

I stand alone and breathe again 
I won't stop until this is through 

And I can't wait to see the sunrise again 
(It's moments like this) 
I am what you'll never be 
To better what I am 
You won't hear lies from me 

And I can't wait to see the sunrise again 
(It's moments like this) 
I am what you'll never be 
To better what I am 
You won't hear lies from me 

Erase darkness from my mind 
Last remaining night 
From here to everywhere 

I stand alone and breathe again 
I won't stop until this is through 

And I can't wait to see the sunrise again 
(It's moments like this) 
I am what you'll never be 
To better what I am 
You won't hear lies from me
