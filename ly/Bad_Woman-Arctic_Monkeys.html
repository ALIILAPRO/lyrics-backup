		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When you left the house this evening
You said you'd be back in a little while
But I've been waiting for such a long time
And this waiting is driving me wild

And while I wait, I think about you
Do you need me and I'm not there?
Are you planning to be without me?
Do you have a new affair?

You're a bad, bad woman
You're a bad, bad woman

Pictures of you keep flashing through my mind
If you would only call, if you would be so kind
Imagine things, I see another man
And it's this waiting I just can't stand

You're a bad, bad woman
You're a bad, bad woman
You're a bad, bad woman
You're a bad, bad woman
