		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The West-coast Warlord,
The Grand Wizard,
Ice Cube,
Motherfuckers head so big they call him jack in the box

[Verse 1]
I'm a superhero, like Lou Ferrigno,
Made by the Nero, look like a zero,
Shine the spotlight, this is my night,
Get your cameras ready, let it rain confetti,
I'm a champion, I do what can't be done,
In the real league nerd, not the fantasy one
Throw your hands up, you can cheer for your boy,
When I hit the stage get an ear full of noise,
When I bring the noise from here to Illinois,
Motherfuckers love when I do what it does,
A all-star, superstar entertainer,
World class, first ballot hall-of-famer,
Some rappers claim that they got a heart full of anger,
How when your lyrics weren't written by a stranger,
Fool I'm the greatest, you just the latest,
I'm loved by your grand mama, and your baby

[Chorus]
See my head is so big they call me jack in the box,
You can't impress me, so fuck what you got,
I said my head is so big they call me jack in the box,
Don't talk about money cause I'm stacking a lot,

[Bridge]
Shine that light on me, put that light on me,
Cause I was sent to the world, by G-O-D,
Shine that light on me, put that light on me,
Cause I was sent to the world, by G-O-D,

[Verse 2]
I was a born loser, I was a born sinner,
Now I am a winner, in a convincing sinner,
I got to take a bow, cause I still wonder how,
The system didn't get me when I was a juvenile,
Just think if I had got locked up,
No Boyz in da Hood thanks to America,
No Eazy, NWA, no 'Friday',
Don't let your motherfucking talent go to waste,
Don't catch a case cause these people got a place,
To throw your life away and take you right out the waste,
Throw your hands up, you got to man up,
I had to show the world, what I was made of,
What you say Blood, I was a slad cause,
Now I'm V.I.P., up in Vegas,
I'm up in Nike-town, so how you like me now,
See the whole industry had to bite my style,

[Chorus]

[Bridge]

Now mama don't be mad I got to show my ass,
And thanks these motherfuckers for my past,
I got to let them know I never break like glass,
What you looking at it's top notch world class,

Mama don't be mad I got to show my ass,
And thanks these motherfuckers for my past,
I got to let them know I never break like glass,
What you looking at it's top notch world class,

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
