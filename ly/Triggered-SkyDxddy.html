		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I shoudn't take things so serious
I don't think they mean any harm
But it would sicken you too
If it happened to you
And you had to relive every part
Here come the flashbacks
And the panic attacks
How long does that shit last
I'm losing myself by the day see
And I know you all think that I'm crazy
That the demons that show up
At the foot of my bed
Are just figments from memories
That fucked up my head
That night terrors ain't nothin
But a real bad dream
So quit being a God Damn drama queen
I seal myself in a sound proof room
So no one can hear how loud I scream
But you don't think it's as bad as it seems
Cause you've never dealt with PTSD
Frozen in your track
Take a visit to the past
To see the devils dirty deed
Leave a mark all down your back
I can't even be around cigarettes
You know how many people smoke?
Approximately one billion
And just about everybody I know
You think you know but you don't
When someone's broke you can't just heavy sigh
And roll your eyes
Like if they ain't physically ill
Then they must be a liar
But wouldn't you recede to the fire
If everything around you became a threat
And everyone surrounding you said
GET OVER IT
It becomes unbearable to live in
So listen
Triggers are relentless
They ain't gonna quit
They don't go away just cause you don't
Believe it
Reliving each nightmare on an everyday basis
I don't think I can do this
I don't think I can take this
Frozen in your tracks
Take a visit to the past
To see the devils dirty deed
Leave a mark all down your back
Frozen in your tracks
Take a visit to the past
To see the devils dirty deed
Leave a mark all down your back
You sent my mind on fire
Sparks flying I'm rewired
You left me no desire
Broken and uninspired
I feel you all conspire
Left all alone with liars
Hopeless so I get higher
And higher till I'm tired
And there's no reminder
Of what I'm crying for
Cause I can't fucking do this anymore
Frozen in your tracks
Take a visit to the past
Repay the devils dirty deed
With a gash all down his back
You set my mind on fire
Sparks flying I'm rewired
You left me no desire
Broken and uninspired
Hopeless so I get higher
And higher till I'm tired
And there is no reminder
Of what I'm crying for
I can't do this anymore
What am I even fighting for?
