		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Reaching for you
I know you're out there somewhere
It's too dark, I'm so cold
I know I had to come here

Every broken dream
That I leave behind
Keeps me going on
Keeps me running blind

Calling your name I hear only echoes
Searching the rain I see only shadows
You've got to show me your face
Voices, I hear them calling behind me
Phantoms of you are burning inside me
You've got to give me a sign

Fading slowly
You're drifting into darkness
I can't see, I can't think
I need to keep on searching

Every memory
Every thought of you
Is inside of me
Tells me what to do

Calling your name I hear only echoes
Searching the rain I see only shadows
You've got to show me your face
Voices, I hear them calling behind me
Phantoms of you are burning inside me
You've got to give me a sign

Can you hear me?
Am I only wasting time?
Are you near me?
Are you only in my mind?
Are you, are you?

Calling your name I hear only echoes
Searching the rain I see only shadows
You've got to show me your face
Voices, I hear them calling behind me
Phantoms of you are burning inside me
You've got to give me a sign
