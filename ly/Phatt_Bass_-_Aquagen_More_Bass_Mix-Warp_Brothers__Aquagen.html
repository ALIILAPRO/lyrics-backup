		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Listen, to the phatt bass

Kick the bass, let's play [Repeat: x4]
Kick the bass, let's play it loud
I want you to stop.
And listen.
Listen, to the phatt bass

It'll show you you're alive.
And listen to this phat bass that will send the blood coursing through your veins.
Kick the bass,
Kick the bass, let's play it loud [Repeat: x5]

To here we're gonna rock, let's play it loud [Repeat: x2]

To here we're gonna rock [Repeat: x7]

To here we're gonna rock that job,
Kick the bass, let's play it loud. [Repeat: x4]

(Loud, loud, loud)
Kick the bass, let's play it loud.
Kick the bass, let's play it loud.
