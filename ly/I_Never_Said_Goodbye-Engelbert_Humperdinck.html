		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She cried and walked away just yesterday
And like a fool, I let her go
We had a silly fight the night before
I never said "I love you so"
I wept all day and then I got the call
"Would you please come to see your wife"
"Something has happened and it's very grave"
"We cannot save the lady's life"

No, I never said goodbye and I never really told her
Just how much she meant to me
No, I never said goodbye, now it's too late
And she's just a memory
How can I go on
Now that girl is gone
I will know, until I die
I never said goodbye

Her perfume lingers all around me now
A pair of shoes lie on the floor
The bed unmade, where just last night, she laid
I cannot say I closed the door
A shopping list of things she'll never buy
An apron lyin' on the chair
Is that her laugh I hear out in the hall
I turn and call, but she's not there

No, I never said goodbye
And I never really told her just how much she meant to me
No, I never said goodbye
Now it's too late and she's just a memory
How can I go on
Now that girl is gone
I will know, until I die
I never said goodbye
