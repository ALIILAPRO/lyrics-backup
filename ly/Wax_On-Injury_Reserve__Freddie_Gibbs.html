		  Mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm
Yeah, yeah
Mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm
Yeah, yeah

Wax on, wax off, stack up all your weight, yeah
Hands up, man up, stand up for your fate, yeah
Wax on, wax off, wax on, wax off, wait, yeah
Band up, clanned up, ram 'em like a fade, yeah
Wax on, wax off, stack up all your weight, yeah
Hands up, man up, stand up for your fate, yeah
Wax on, wax off, wax on, wax off, wait
Band up, clanned up, ram 'em like a fade, yeah

I came way too damn far to stop now, uh
I hit rock bottom, been on that ground, uh
Always managed to go get back up, uh
Forever on my own, uh, no backup
Gotten less checks since I got the blue one
So please tell me what the fuck that verifies
Twitter feeds don't feed my daughter
If I could sell that mothafucka, I would cash it in
Cop a crib in Santa Cruz, never see my ass again
Don't get it twisted, I still love it, though
This past year, I seen more time on the road than at home
Not complainin', it's alright, yeah, I signed up for this life
Got my homies on the left, got my family on the right
And they all tell you, same nigga, different zip code
Ain't shit changed other than the fact I'm gettin' old
Never been the type to do a fuckin' thing that I was told
A lot of niggas try to make it here, but most of them just fold

Wax on, wax off, stack up all your weight, yeah
Hands up, man up, stand up for your fate, yeah
Wax on, wax off, wax on, wax off, wait, yeah
Band up, clanned up, ram 'em like a fade, yeah
Wax on, wax off, stack up all your weight, yeah
Hands up, man up, stand up for your fate, yeah
Wax on, wax off, wax on, wax off, wait
Band up, clanned up, ram 'em like a fade, yeah

(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
My stovetop, yeah
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Glass pop, yeah
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
It's sold out, yeah
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Strippers on that stop, yeah

Stove off, stove on, dope on my stovetop, yeah
Percy Miller, ice cream, my glass pop, yeah
Gang, gang, world tour, my shows been sold out, yeah
I used to fuck strippers on that stop, yeah
"Freddie, you fallin' off"
Bitch, I invented this shit, they can't fuck with the Kane
Shit just be poppin' off
Straight out of Gary with niggas that'd kill you for fame
Rippin' this water off
Crack in the back of the 'Lac, I'ma hit me stain
They better call the law
I can't go back to the jail, I'll go out in a blaze
Out in a blaze, bitch, couple off of safe shit
Feel these drugs kickin' in my system when the bass kick
Used to cook the dope up on the hotplate in the basement
Masked up while I'm whippin' 'cause the fumes was makin' my face itch
The Perc' gon' make my face itch, wrist work
Dope game hard, the rap game a breeze
Freestyle, hit a lick, get my cheese
Get a brick, make it flip like trapeze
Think sweet with a bitch on her knees
IG, fuckin' hoes off the feed
Think sweet with a bitch on the beat (Yeah, yeah)
Sweet with a bitch on the beâ€“

Wax on, wax off, stack up all your weight, yeah
Hands up, man up, stand up for your fate, yeah
Wax on, wax off, wax on, wax off, wait, yeah
Band up, clanned up, ram 'em like a fade, yeah
Wax on, wax off, stack up all your weight, yeah
Hands up, man up, stand up for your fate, yeah
Wax on, wax off, wax on, wax off, wait
Band up, clanned up, ram 'em like a fade, yeah

Wax on, wax off, stack up all your weight, yeah
Hands up, man up, stand up for your fate, yeah
Wax on, wax off, wax on, wax off, wait, yeah
Band up, clanned up, ram 'em like a fade, yeah
Wax on, wax off, stack up all your weight, yeah
Hands up, man up, stand up for your fate, yeah
Wax on, wax off, wax on, wax off, wait
Band up, clanned up, ram 'em like a fade, yeah
