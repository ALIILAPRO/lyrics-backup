		  (Intro)

Came out of the park and I be trappin so fresh 
I’m just seventeen but I gat voices like Adele
Yeah I know i’m wrong but I be tryna make amends
And I be choosing you because you smarter than your best friends

And I remember back then
Wanna hang around homies
Mama wouldn’t let me
She told me they bad friends 
Always dream about being a hero I put on my mask like am Batman
I be shooting like mad Max 
All I can see is bad man

You wanna impress me 
You can go to the backseat
I can’t call you my bestie 
Don’t oppress me
I be doing the jet ski
Making beat like am Rexxie 
I remember I just wanna trap in the studio
And they wouldn’t let me
I remember I was skipping all of the classes in school
Cause I spent all my school fees

Ski ski 
Please don’t let me turn it up
Don’t let me f**k it up
I know you wanna f**k me up 

Ski ski
Taking all this adderall 
Am just anonymous 
She say she wanna

You wanna impress me 
You can go to the backseat
I can’t call you my bestie 
Don’t oppress me
I be doing the jet ski
Making beat like am Rexxie 
I remember I just wanna trap in the studio
And they wouldn’t let me
I remember I was skipping all of the classes in school
Cause I spent all my school fees yeah

Don’t let me
I know you wanna 

Came out of the the park and I be trappin so fresh 
I’m just seventeen but I gat voices like Adele
Yeah, I know i'm wrong but I be tryna make amends
And I be choosing you because you smarter than your best friends

And I remember back then
Wanna hang around homies
Mama wouldn’t let me
She told me they bad friends 
Always dream about being a hero I put on my mask like am Batman
I be shooting like mad Max 
All I can see is bad man

Ski ski 
Pls don’t let me turn it up
I don’t wanna f**k it up
We gon turn it up

(Outro)
