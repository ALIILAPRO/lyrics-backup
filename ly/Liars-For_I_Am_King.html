		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  Liars
We’re fucking liars

Our clock is ticking, we are running out of time
Before the world starts burning from the inside out
The earth's silent screams that no one wants to hear
Are we just paralysed or do we not want to see

Blood is all we see
We are the key to set it free
We created this virus
Calling for osiris

We all dream of beautiful blue skies
But instead every second something dies
We all grieve about the things we’ve lost
But can we change, for what cause

Parents weeping and children slain
Bloody thoughts and fear will reign
We stand in the darkness waiting for the light
But all we see is the darkest, the darkest of nights

Liars
We’re fucking liars

The earth is shaking
It’s calling for our help
We don't need to see flood
Rivers filled with blood
Death will follow
The earth is burning
Its children are hurting
We will see the blood
It will cause a flood
It’s too late
Dark days are here
Death will follow

Blood is all we see
We are the key to set it free
We created this virus
Calling for osiris

We all dream of beautiful blue skies
But instead every second something dies
We all grieve about the things we’ve lost
But can we change, for what cost

For what cause
All we see are dark nights  
For what cause
All we need are blue skies
