		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I will fight for space and time
Which runs through you
I'll run fast when they both fell
But love stood as cruel

Vagabonds, your feast is love
Vagabonds, your feast is love

I used to mock their fake rebellion (their fake rebellion)
I used to mock their sins (their sins, oh)
Now I'm the one left in

Love, love, love, I'll wait
Love, I'll wake in you
Love, love, love, I'll wait
In love always with you
Love, love, love, I'll wait
Love, I'll wake in you
Love, love, love, I'll wait
In love always with you

Darkness scares its unawares
It's us telling you
Behind these walls in your bones
Gains trust, as I knew

Vagabonds, your feast is love
Vagabonds, your feast is love

I used to mock their fake rebellion (their fake rebellion)
I used to mock their sins (their sins, oh)
Now I'm the one left in

Love, love, love, I'll wait
Love, I'll wake in you
Love, love, love, I'll wait
In love always with you
Love, love, love, I'll wait
Love, I'll wake in you
Love, love, love, I'll wait
In love always with you

In love always with you
