		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You left me spinning like a disco
Trying but I don't know
If I can stand straight
You took me left when you knew I was right
Now I got to try to fight just to make it through the day

I never knew what you were capable of
Baby, I would've kept my heart
But I gave it up
Baby, I fell in love
Now I don't know where to start

It's so cold with nobody to hold me
You're so wrong for leaving when you told me
You would never leave me by myself
Out in the middle of nowhere
Now I'm lost
Trying to make it on my own
I thought I could never do this,
But now I'm walking by myself
Out in the middle of nowhere

You left me broken like a record
Baby, I'm baby I'm hurt and I don't want to play anymore
Missed every sign
Believed ever lie
And I was waiting for more

I never knew what you were capable of
Baby, I would've kept my heart
But I gave it up
Baby, I fell in love
Now I don't know where to start

It's so cold with nobody to hold me
You're so wrong for leaving when you told me
You would never leave me by myself
Out in the middle of nowhere
Now I'm lost
Trying to make it on my own
I thought I could never do this alone,
But now I'm walking by myself
Out in the middle of nowhere

You took my heart off my sleeve
But now I'm taking it back
Baby, here I come
You took advantage of me
I don't appreciate that, that
You son of a gun

It's so cold with nobody to hold me
You're so wrong for leaving when you told me
You would never leave me by myself
Out in the middle of nowhere

It's so cold with nobody to hold me
You're so wrong for leaving when you told me
You would never leave me by myself
Out in the middle of nowhere
Now I'm lost
Trying to make it on my own
I thought I could never do this alone,
But now I'm walking by myself
Out in the middle of nowhere
