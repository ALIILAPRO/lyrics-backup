		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Somewhere in the distance I hear the bells ring
Darkness settles on the town as the children start to sing
And the lady 'cross the street she shuts out the night
There's a cast of thousands waiting
As she turns out the light

But it's too late, too late, too late
(Too late) too late for love
Too late, too late, too late, too late

London boys are gazing as the girls go hand in hand
With a pocket full of innocence, their entrance is grand
And the queen of the dream stands before them all
She stretches out her hand as the curtains start to fall

But it's too late, too late, too late
Too late, too late for love
Too late, too late, it's too late, too late

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Standing by the trapdoor aware of me and you
The actor and the clown, they're waiting for their cue
And there's a lady over there, she's acting pretty cool
But when it comes to playing life
She always plays the fool

But it's too late, too late, it's too late, too late for love
Too late, it's too late, too late, too late
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
It's a little too late
Oh, oh
Much too late
Oh, oh
You see, it's all too late

Yeah, it's too late
Too late, too late, too late
Too late for love
Too late, too late, too late
Too late
Too late, too late, too late
Too late for love
Too late, too late, too late
