		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Cory's eyes are like a jungle
He smiles it's like the radio
He whispers songs into my window
In words that nobody knows
There's pretty girls on every corner
They watch him as he's walking home
Saying, does he know
Will you ever know?

You're beautiful
Every little piece, love don't you know?
You're really gonna be someone
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you've looked for
I hope your love leads you back to my door
Oh, but if it don't, stay beautiful

Cory finds another way to be
The highlight of my day
I'm taking pictures in my mind
So I can save them for a rainy day
It's hard to make a conversation
When he's taking my breath away
I should say "hey, by the way

You're beautiful
Every little piece, love don't you know?
You're really gonna be someone
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you've looked for
I hope your love leads you back to my door
Oh, but if it don't, stay beautiful

If you and I are a story
That never gets told
If what you are is a daydream
I'll never get to hold, at least you'll know

You're beautiful
Every little piece, love don't you know?
You're really gonna be someone
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you've looked for
I hope your love leads you back to my front door
Oh, but if it don't
Will you stay beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful?
Oh, oh, oh

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, but if it don't
Stay beautiful
Stay beautiful
Na, na, na, na, na
