		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Keep on lovin' me honey, keep on lovin' me true
Baby, I'm gonna love you no matter what you do
Just so long as I can have it all, nothin' but you
So don't you take your love, don't take it away from me
'Cause I would stop right where I stand
I'd just be the frame of a man
Don't you take your love, don't take it away from me
'Cause if you leave you might as well take the air I breathe

Keep on lovin' me honey, don't you go nowhere
Don't you know I'm satisfied with your tender care?
And I get my inspiration, darlin', just knowin' you're there
So don't you take your love, don't take it away from me
'Cause like a leaf out on a tree
You've become a part of me
Don't you take your love, don't take it away from me
'Cause if you leave you might as well take the air I breathe

Would you take the heavens out of the sky
Imagine what the world would be like if the rivers ran dry?
Oh, Tammi
What good am I without you?
There's no thrill without you, darlin'
Like a sea without a shore
Kicking forever more

Keep on lovin' me honey, don't you change your mind
Sugar, I can't bear the thought of ever leavin' you behind
No matter what I do, another you I'll never find
So don't you take your love, don't take it away from me
'Cause I would stop right where I stand
I'd be the frame of a man
Don't you take your love, don't take it away from me
'Cause if you leave you might as well take the air I breathe
If you leave you might as well take the air I breathe
Don't you take your love, don't take it away from me
'Cause I need your love, I need it so desperately
Don't you take your love, don't take it away from me
