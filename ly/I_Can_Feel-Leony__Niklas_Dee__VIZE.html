		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Two hands on the wheel
Making memories we will remember
When we‘re gone, we‘re gone for real
But the stars they shine ever after

It‘s the perfect time
Only you and I
Light the world up, make it shine

When you hold me tight
Trouble‘s outta sight
Blow it up like dynamite

I can feel
Something heavy on my heart
I can feel
Something‘s tearing me apart
I can feel
That you guide me through the dark
I can feel the love tonight

Oh, I can feel (I can feel)
Something heavy on my heart
I can feel (I can feel)
Something‘s tearing me apart
I can feel (I can feel)
That you guide me through the dark
I can feel the love tonight

-Ight, -ight, -ight, -ight
-Ight, -ight, -ight, -ight
-Ight, -ight, -ight, -ight
-Ight, -ight, -ight, -ight

I can feel (I can feel, I can feel, I can feel)
Something heavy on my heart (On my heart, on my heart)
I can feel (I can feel, I can feel, I can feel)
Something‘s tearing me apart

What‘s broken can be healed
But what if I can‘t pick up the pieces?
And my mind’s a Battlefield
And I‘m sick of finding a reason

I can feel
Something heavy on my heart
I can feel
Something‘s tearing me apart
I can feel
That you guide me through the dark
I can feel the love tonight

Oh, I can feel (I can feel)
Something heavy on my heart
I can feel (I can feel)
Something‘s tearing me apart
I can feel (I can feel)
That you guide me through the dark
I can feel the love tonight

-Ight, -ight, -ight, -ight
-Ight, -ight, -ight, -ight
-Ight, -ight, -ight, -ight
-Ight, -ight, -ight, -ight

-Ight, -ight, -ight, -ight
-Ight, -ight, -ight, -ight
-Ight, -ight, -ight, -ight
-Ight, -ight, -ight

Oh, I can feel (I can feel, I can feel, I can feel)
Something heavy on my heart (On my heart, on my heart)
I can feel (I can feel, I can feel, I can feel)
Something‘s tearing me apart
