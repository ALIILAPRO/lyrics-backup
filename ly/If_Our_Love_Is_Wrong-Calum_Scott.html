		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't know how I should say it
In my mind, it's every word
That they don't wanna hear
I don't know how they might take it
Maybe you can take the pressure
And make it disappear
Throw out the inhibition
You make me feel a feeling that I've never felt before
I don't know if they're gonna like it
But that only makes me want it more

'Cause I'm nobody's but yours

If it's me
And if it's you
And if our love is wrong
Then I don't ever wanna be right
I don't ever wanna be right
If it's real
And if it's true
And if our love is wrong
Then I don't ever wanna be right
I don't ever wanna be right

Oh oh, yeah yeah
Oh oh , yeah I just want you to be mine

Why would I need their permission
Skin and bones, I'm only human
It's in my DNA
Suffocating just to fit in
Why do I care what people say

'Cause I'm nobody's but yours

If it's me
And if it's you
And if our love is wrong
Then I don't ever wanna be right
I don't ever wanna be right
If it's real
And if it's true
And if our love is wrong
Then I don't ever wanna be right
I don't ever wanna be right

Oh oh, yeah yeah
I just want you to be mine

Oh oh, yeah yeah
I just want you to be mine
