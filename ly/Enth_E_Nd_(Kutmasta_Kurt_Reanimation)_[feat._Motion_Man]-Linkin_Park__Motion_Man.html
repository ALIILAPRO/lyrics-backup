		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey yo when this first started off it was just Linkin Park
Then in the middle came Motion Man
And at the end of it all it was Kutmasta Kut wit a remix 

One thing I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme when I was obsessed with time
All I know, time was just slipping way

And I watched it count down till the end of the day
Watched it watch me and the words that I say
The echo of the clock rhythm in my veins
I know that I didn't look out below

And I watched the time go right out the window
Trying to grab hold, trying not to watch
I wasted it all on the hands of the clock
But in the end no matter what I pretend

The journey is more important than the end or the start
And what it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of the time when I tried so hard

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

Yo one thing, one thing I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme to explain the due time
All I know, time to so-socialize like the host of the party

All for shake and made eye contact
Party control showing all that
Northeast, Southwest coast
Stand out the window, no opportunity to mingle

I tried to show her, if you could just sense a middle disorder
I brought you back of the thing
Like the imaginary man of your dreams
Well, you would always seem to make it worth it

A pig skin I never nerved you
You felt lever never pleather, real bringing the pleasure
By any means and means of leaving you teens
Holler for teen magazines but I tried so hard

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

Linkin park, remix, Mo Mo Mo Motion Man
Linkin park, in the end, Kutmasta Kutmasta Kut Kutmasta Kurt
Linkin park, remix, Mo Mo Motion Man
Linkin park, in the end, Kutmasta Kurt

One thing I don't know how
It doesn't even matter when you look at it now
Because when I designed this rhyme I was scared of it all
Scared to fall, I hadn't even tried to crawl

And I was forced to run, with you mocking me
Stopping me, back stabbing me constantly
Remembering all those times you fought with me
Watch the clock now chop full of hypocrisy

And now your mouth wishes it could inhale
Every single little thing you said and make it expel
Every single word you sputter just to get your piece, but it really doesn't matter to me
Because from the start to the end no matter what I pretend

The journey is more important than the end or the start
And what it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of the time when I tried so hard

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall

To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
In the end
