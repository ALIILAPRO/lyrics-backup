		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Love should be easy
Why'd you let me down?
Why did we let it tear us apart?

Lying awake, feeling alone
Where have I gone, nobody knows, but
I thought that you'd find me
Saying the words, don't recognize
Telling myself that it'll be fine, but
I know that it won't be

'Cause I'm lost
In my thoughts
So why do I keep holding on?
In the hope that
We would go back
To when I felt safe in your arms

Love should be easy
Why'd you let me down?
Why did we let it tear us apart?
Love should be easy
But we hit the ground
Yeah, we let it keep all that we lost
Maybe in another life
I'll be by your side
Maybe I'll find you again
It could be so easy
But we'll do without
If it means we can be who we are
Love should be easy

Lying awake, feeling alone
Can't keep my eyes off of my phone
I'm scared that you answer
All of the time and all of the space
Never enough, you pushed me away, but
None of it matters

Anymore
'Cause you're gone
So why do I keep holding on?

'Cause love should be easy
Why'd you let me down?
Why did we let it tear us apart?
Love should be easy
But we hit the ground
Yeah, we let it keep all that we lost
Maybe in another life
I'll be by your side
Maybe I'll find you again
It could be so easy
But we'll do without
If it means we can be who we are
Love should be easy

'Cause I'm lost
In my thoughts
So why do I keep holding on?
In the hope that
We would go back
To when I felt safe in your arms

'Cause love should be easy
Why'd you let me down?
Why did we let it tear us apart?
Love should be easy
But we hit the ground
Yeah, we let it keep all that we lost
Maybe in another life
I'll be by your side
Maybe I'll find you again
It could be so easy
But we'll do without
If it means we can be who we are
Love should be easy
