		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My life, this shit like a story
Gave them my heart and they tore it
My life like a story or somethin'
It got so many chapters, this shit'll never end
(Heartbeatz on the track) yeah, my life is like a story
I can tell you 'bout a whole lotta shit, but I rather not
I'm afraid of what you might do
(You don't see the pain, I try to ignore it)
Shit, that's why I just keep my mouth closed
(Tell you my life, this shit like a story)

So many problems, ain't got many options, it be hard to get by
On probation, I'm sober, I can't even get high
I need you that's the truth, it's so hard to deny
I just can't see, how you leave Without saying goodbye (how you leave)
Let me tell you my life, this shit like a story (story)
I gave them my heart and they tore it
I rode 'til the wheels fell off, no Forgies
These niggas gon' change regardless
So I just stay in my lane like Tory
Right now, I've been dying for love
Ain't safe to rush, so I ain't gon' force it (no)

I'm a savage, won't hold my hand out
You rattin', I heard your mans hot
These niggas be beefing and speaking on me for some clout
They really be fanned out
Remember when I wanted Percs, but it was a drought
Had to bring them Xans out
That bitch wanna fuck, I'm the man now
Bend her over, tell her pull her pants down
Up for some days, I was tryna get paid
Used to hug on the block like a newborn baby
Was clutching the Glock and it came with no safety
'Cause I know the opps tryna plot and come take me
All these chains on my neck, you would think it was slavery
Real dope boy shit, like I came from the 80's
I won't let them ruin this shit I created
Bitch, I'm the greatest, I feel like McGrady

So many problems, ain't got many options, it be hard to get by
On probation, I'm sober, I can't even get high
I need you that's the truth, it's so hard to deny
I just can't see, how you leave Without saying goodbye
Let me tell you my life, this shit like a story
I gave them my heart and they tore it
I rode 'til the wheels fell off, no Forgies
These niggas gon' change regardless
So I just stay in my lane like Tory
Right now, I've been dying for love
Ain't safe to rush, so I ain't gon' force it (no)

Without saying goodbye
I'm on probation, can't even get high
I can't even get high
(Even get high, can't even get high)

What type of shit you on? Come on my live
Talkin' 'bout I'ma die
Everybody gon' die, you think you ain't gone die?
(That's the difference between us)
What type of shit you on? You think you ain't gon' die
Bitch, we all gon' die
And for everybody against me, man, get off my dick
You hating on me, you been hating on me, you heard me?
If you say I lost, ah, man, you been hating on me
You ain't never fuckin' with me
You wasn't never fuckin' with me, you heard me?
I don't show no feelings, I don't show no-
Yeah, I just hold all that shit in, you hear me?
I wake up thinkin' 'bout how I'ma get the next bag?
You wake up thinking about what I'm 'bout to do and what I'm doing next
You broke as a bitch, you hating, you heard me? 
Your job is to watch what I'm doing
And my job is to keep entertaining your pussy-ass
