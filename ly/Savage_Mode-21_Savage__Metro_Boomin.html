		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If Young Metro don't trust, I'm gon' shoot you

Spent a thousand dollars just to sip (just to sip muddy)
Park that motherfucker in the VIP
I got that motherfucker on my hip
I'ma squeeze (baow)
I'ma squeeze (baow)
We ain't really with all that intimate shit
We ain't really with that pretending and shit
Come and get your bitch she actin' friendly and shit
When I get inside that pussy, I be killin' that shit

I'm in savage mode (woah) I'm in savage mode (woah)
I'm in savage mode (woah)
I'm in savage mode, I'm a savage on these hoes (savage)
Savage on these hoes (woah)
Savage on these hoes, I'm a savage on these hoes (woah)
I'm in savage mode (21)
I'm in savage mode (savage) I'm in savage mode (savage)
I'm in savage mode, I'm a savage on these hoes (21)
Savage on these hoes (21)
Savage on these hoes, I'm a savage on these hoes

Cup, woah
Muddy, yo
Hit the yolk
Got the stick, woah
Keep it on me, yah
Knew you got it, yah
One in the head, yah
Bitch I fuckin' dare
Nigga I double-dare
Why the fuck you stare?
Pew-pew, bet you ass don't stare
Red bottoms, yeah
Bitch watch where you step
I'm in savage mode, cook a nigga like a chef
Ain't no loyalty, these niggas off themselves
All these fuckin' stripes, I shoulda been a ref

I'm in savage mode (woah) I'm in savage mode (woah)
I'm in savage mode (woah)
I'm in savage mode, I'm a savage on these hoes (savage)
Savage on these hoes (woah)
Savage on these hoes, I'm a savage on these hoes (woah)
I'm in savage mode (21)
I'm in savage mode (savage) I'm in savage mode (savage)
I'm in savage mode, I'm a savage on these hoes (21)
Savage on these hoes (21)
Savage on these hoes, I'm a savage on these hoes

All that backstabbin' turned me to a savage
All that fuckin' krabbin' turned me to a savage
Racks inside the mattress turned me to a savage
I turned to a savage bitch, I gotta have it
Fell asleep in science, I love mathematics (countin' cash)
Bitch I like the act', bitch I like some trappin' (that countin' cash)
That chopper flip a nigga like he acrobatic
He don't want no smoke, he don't want no static
I'm in savage mode, shit can get tragic
I might toe tag him, I might body bag him
These bitches gettin' old, I already have 'em
She wanna live lavish, she don't need my status

I'm in savage mode (woah) I'm in savage mode (woah)
I'm in savage mode (woah)
I'm in savage mode, I'm a savage on these hoes (savage)
Savage on these hoes (woah)
Savage on these hoes, I'm a savage on these hoes (woah)
I'm in savage mode (21)
I'm in savage mode (savage) I'm in savage mode (savage)
I'm in savage mode, I'm a savage on these hoes (21)
Savage on these hoes (21)
Savage on these hoes, I'm a savage on these hoes

If Young Metro don't trust, I'm gon' shoot you

I'm a savage on these hoes, savage on these hoes
Savage on these hoes, I'm a savage on these hoes
I'm in savage mode, I'm in savage mode
I'm in savage mode, I'm in savage mode
I'm a savage on these hoes, savage on these hoes
Savage on these hoes, I'm a savage on these hoes
