		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let's go to the mall, everybody, ha! 
Go!

Come on Jessica, come on Tori
Let's go to the mall, you won't be sorry
Put on your jelly bracelet's
And your cool graffiti coat
At the mall, having fun is what it's all about

I haven't done my homework yet (that's okay)
And you know how my parents get (whatever!)
But I don't care,'cause all my friends are gonna be there

Everybody come and play
Throw every last care away
Let's go to the mall, today

Chloe, mouse, I love that

There's this boy I like
Met him at the food court
He's got hair like Gretzky and he does jumps on his skateboard
I hope he asks me out
Take me to my favorite spot
It'll be just him and me (but don't forget the robot)

Dad says I'm too young to date (I'm too young to date) (lame)
But baby, I don't wanna to wait (I don't wanna wait) (let's do it)
That's okay, I'm gonna rock your body anyway
I'm gonna rock your body 'til Canada Day

Everybody come and play
Throw every last care away
Let's go to the mall, today

I went to the mall with a couple of friends
I had a whole week's allowance to spend
I want to hoop earrings and a Benetton shirt
We came here to shop and we came here to flirt
I turned around and who should I see
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney
He said, "Young lady, I don't approve"
So I had to get down and bust a crazy move
Hit it Fred
Come on
Let's go to the mall

Let's go to the mall everybody

Everybody come and play (go!)
Throw every last care away (let's go to the mall)
Let's go to the mall, today 
Everybody loves the mall

Everybody come and play (yeah)
Throw every last care away (I love my hoop earrings)
Let's go to the mall, today

Today, today, toda-ay, toda-ay
Let's go to the mall (today)
Let's go to the ma-a-al (toda-ay)
Let's go to the mall (Today)
Let's go to the ma-a-al (toda-ay)
Let's go to the mall (today)
Let's go to the ma-a-al (toda-ay)
Let's go to the mall (today)
Let's go to the ma-a-al (toda-ay)
Let's go to the mall (today)
Let's go to the ma-a-al (toda-ay)
Let's go to the mall (today)
Let's go to the ma-a-al (toda-ay)
Today, today, toda-ay
