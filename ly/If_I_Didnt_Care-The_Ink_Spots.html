		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I didn't care more than words can say
If I didn't care, would I feel this way?
If this isn't love then why do I thrill?
And what makes my head go 'round and 'round
While my heart stands still?

If I didn't care, would it be the same?
Would my every prayer begin and end with just your name?
And would I be sure that this is love beyond compare?
Would all this be true if I didn't care for you?

If I didn't care
Honey child, more than words can say
If I didn't care
Would I feel this way? 
Darlin' if this isn't love
Then why do I thrill so much? 
And what is it that makes my head go 'round and 'round 
While my heart just stands still so much?

If I didn't care would it be the same?
Would my every prayer begin and end with just your name?
And would I be sure that this is love beyond compare?
Would all this be true if I didn't care for you?
