		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I’ve been waiting for this moment to arrive
I can see you for the monster that you are
A predator in the dark
A beast without a heart
I’ve come for you 
I’ve come for you

They say the road to hell is paved with good intentions 
But I had none to start, so where am I then?
A predator in the dark
A beast without a heart
I’ve come for you 
I’ve come for you

I will surrender to the tide
Let the water be my guide
I’m a wave on the ocean wide
I will surrender to the tide
Let the water be my guide
I’m a wave on the ocean

Fate goes as ever fate must
Fate is the only one that’s just, and I trust
Fate goes as ever fate must
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust

It’s been written in the stars that you would fall
I’m certain that you won’t go quietly
A spineless creature in the dark
A beast without a heart
I’ve come for you 
I’ve come for you

I will surrender to the tide
Let the water be my guide
I’m a wave on the ocean wide
I will surrender to the tide
Let the water be my guide
I’m a wave on the ocean

Fate goes as ever fate must
Fate is the only one that’s just, and I trust
That fate goes as ever fate must
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust

Fate goes as ever fate must
Fate is the only one that’s just, and I trust
That fate goes as ever fate must
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Fate goes as ever fate must
Fate is the only one that’s just, and I trust
Fate goes as ever fate must
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust

A predator in the dark
A beast without a heart
The same as me
The same as me
