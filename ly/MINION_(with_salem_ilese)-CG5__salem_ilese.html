		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This sitch is bananas.
I don’t really like your manners.
I live in insanity,
I don’t think you ever been a fan of me.
No.
Never ever.
You keep trying to play director.
And I don’t wanna cause a scene,
Everytime you’re outta line, I wanna scream.

Oh!
So despicable!
Overcritical, you undermine,
Leave me wonderin’ why,
I gave you all these nights.
All these lonely nights,
All this precious time.

I ain’t gonna be a minion to you
You don’t got any dominion do you?
I won’t give another minute to you.
You won’t be my leader.
I ain’t gonna be a,

I don’t wanna take opinions from you,
Every battle that I’m winnin’, you lose.
Spending every other minute confused.
I ain’t gonna be a (NO)
I ain’t gonna be a MINION!

All I hear is gibberish when you tell me what to do.
Only way to fix it is to turn you down to mute.
You may think you’re a unicorn,
But I think that I’m getting bored.
We been going back and forth,
Like a ball around the court.
Can we end this stop and go?

So despicable!
Overcritical, you undermine,
Leave me wonderin’ why,
I gave you all these nights.
All these lonely nights,
All this precious time.

I ain’t gonna be a minion to you
You don’t got any dominion do you?
I won’t give another minute to you.
You won’t be my leader.
I ain’t gonna be a,

I don’t wanna take opinions from you,
Every battle that I’m winnin’ you’ll lose.
Spending every other minute confused.
I ain’t gonna be a (NO)
I ain’t gonna be a MINION!

I’m not gonna be your minion
I’m not gonna be yours
I’m not gonna be your minion
I’m not gonna fall for it no more

I’m not gonna be your minion
I’m not gonna be yours
I’m not gonna be your minion
I’m not gonna fall!

I ain’t gonna be a minion to you
You don’t got any dominion do you?
I won’t give another minute to you.
You won’t be my leader.
I ain’t gonna be a,

I don’t wanna take opinions from you,
Every battle that I’m winnin’ you’ll lose.
Spending every other minute confused.
I ain’t gonna be a (NO)
I ain’t gonna be a MINION!
