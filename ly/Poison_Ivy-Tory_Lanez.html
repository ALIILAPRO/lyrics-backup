		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell ya
Please don't love her
She's got evil in her eyes
Know my brothers, don't be confused she's in disguise
I've got my mojo, now she can't hurt me no more
But beware of her, she's on the prowl for more

Oh, that girl, that girl, is not the girl you know
Stay away from her, she shines but she don't glow
Oh, that girl will never let you know 
'Til the day she's rippin' out your heart you'll see (yeah)

That girl's like poison ivy, and she just keeps burning my skin
Burning up my skin and that girl is
That girl's like poison ivy, and I can't let her burn me again
I can't let her burn me again
That girl's like poison ivy, and she just keeps burning my skin (yeah)
Burning up my skin and that girl is
That girl's like poison ivy, and I can't let her burn me again

She can't be my lover, she can read this in my eyes
I told my mother, and she said boy that girl is in disguise
I've got my mojo, and she can't hurt me anymore
But beware of her, 'cause she'll be back for more

Oh, that girl
That girl, is not the girl you know
Stay away from her (yeah)
She shines every night but she don't glow
Oh, that girl will never let you know 
'Til the day she's rippin' out your heart you'll see (yeah)

That girl's like poison ivy, and she just keeps burning my skin (yeah she is not)
She keeps burning up my skin, na-hnah-nah
That girl's like poison ivy, and I can't let her burn me again (oh that girl)
I can't let her burn me again, not now
That girl's like poison ivy, and she just keeps burning my skin (woah, she is)
Burning up my skin and that girl is
That girl's like poison ivy, and I can't let her burn me again
