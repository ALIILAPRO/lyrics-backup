		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In Osaka
There's a mantra
Never lose control

But I'm hungry
For the money
Now I gotta strike gold

Sick of all your wondering
Will the stars align again?
I can tell you how the story ends

But you already know
You already know
You already know

We in London
It's a bumpin'
But I wanna get lost

Find a bottle
Now it's hollow
But I'm filling my thoughts

Eyes are on the hour glass
Betting that we're powerless
I can tell you how the story ends

But you already know
You already know

(Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey)
(You already know)

Sometimes I wish I let go
Wish I let go
Wish I let go
Maybe I gotta let go
Gotta let go
Gotta let go

But you already know (hey hey hey hey hey hey)
You already know (hey hey hey hey hey hey)
You already know (hey hey hey hey hey hey)

You already know (hey hey hey hey hey hey)
You already know
