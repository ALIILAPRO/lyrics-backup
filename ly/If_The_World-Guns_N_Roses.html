		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  [Chorus:]
If the world would end today
All the dreams we had would all just drift away
You know there's nothing more to say
If the world would end would our love slip away

I never knew the way that you looked at me
Would ever mean so much to me
In my heart I found the feelings that I've never shown
Now they've got the best of me

[Chorus:]

I never thought all the love I was looking for
Could ever be so close to me
Your the only one that I've ever loved that has ever loved me
And now you've got the best of me

If the world would end today
All the dreams we had would all just drift away
You know there's nothing more to say

[Chorus:]
