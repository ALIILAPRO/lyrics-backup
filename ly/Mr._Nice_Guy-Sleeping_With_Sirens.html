		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What do you know about sacrifice
All you do is take
So I'm not playing nice
No more, no more
I've been used and abused
And we've been getting used to
All your excuses
They're not gonna work anymore (not gonna work anymore)
No more

We don't ask for much
All you gave us was a little
Promised the world
All we wanted was a little bit more
Is that too much to ask for?
Been running around in circles for too long
Playing your game
But we're not gonna play anymore
So how's this sound?
No more Mr. Nice Guy now

Fool me once
And I can deal with it
Fool me twice
And then I'm over it
You can't say that we're friends
You burned the candle down from both its ends

I've been used, I refuse
And your sorry excuses
They're not gonna work anymore
No more

We don't ask for much
All you gave us was a little
Promised the world
All we wanted was a little bit more
Is that too much to ask for?
Been running around in circles
For too long
Playing your game
But we're not gonna play anymore
So how's this sound?
No more Mr. Nice Guy now
No more Mr. Nice Guy now

I've been used
I refuse
I won't be your puppet anymore

No more playing nice
No more playing

We don't ask for much, all you gave us was a little
We gave you the world
But you always want a little bit more
More, more, more, more, more
Running around in these circles for too long
Playing the game
But I don't wanna play anymore
So how's this sound?
No more Mr. Nice Guy now
No more playing nice (no more playing nice)
No more playing nice
