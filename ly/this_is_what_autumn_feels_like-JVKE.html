		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Love is a walk in the park
That's how I feel at the start
Pretty until it gets dark
Love is a walk in the park
'Til you get bit by a dog
I never knew you could bark

When the seasons change
You won't feel the same at all

Because summer will turn into fall
Then you'll leave and you're gone
You don't need me at all
Like the trees in the autumn breeze
It's ironic the way that you leave

Love is like riding a bike
Scary but then it's alright
I got the hang of it, right?
'Til you start moving too fast
Look up and you're 'bout to crash
Why doesn't love ever last
So call me a pessimist
I think I'm a realist living a lie
Every night that I hold you inside of these arms
Knowing too well you'll move on
As soon as the warm weather's gone

When the seasons change
You won't feel the same at all

Because summer will turn into fall
Then you'll leave and you're gone
You don't need me at all
Like the trees in the autumn breeze
It's ironic the way that you leave
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ah
Like the trees in the autumn breeze
It's ironic the way that you leave
