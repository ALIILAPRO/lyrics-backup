		  Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy

Practice gratitude, yeah, I'm thankful for the life that I lead
I kiss my son before I put him to sleep
And I was workin' for a flat on my feet
Why would you work until you got bloody knees?
Bloody hell, ain't got some shit, it was goin' so well
It makes me sick when I look at the world
'Cause nothing seems real

Thinkin' for myself
Thinkin', I'm just thinkin' for myself
I'm just thinkin' for myself
Thinkin' for myself, I'm just thinkin' for myself
'Cause I'm just thinkin' for myself

Why, why you so selfish? I can't understand it
Can you just explain, please, why you feel this way towards the world, my good sir?

People suck dick to climb a pyramid, it makes me sick
But they just thinkin' for themselves
Rich get rich and I been one of them
I still see it in my friends, the jealousy
They wanna be me, the grass ain't always green on the other side
A scary sight at Halloween
I got a few tricks, so we can get a treat
The victories all come from defeats

I'm just thinkin' for myself
Thinkin', I'm just thinkin' for myself
I'm just thinkin' for myself
Thinkin' for myself, I'm just thinkin' for myself
I'm just thinkin' for myself

We get what we deserve, somehow, we live and learn
It's the last time to go while we all search for somethin'
And we get what we deserve, somehow, we live and learn
It's the last time to go while we all search for somethin'
And you get what you deserve, somehow, we live and learn
It's the last time to go while we all search for somethin'
And we get what we deserve, somehow, we live and learn
It's the last time to go while we all search for somethin'

Thinkin', I'm just thinkin' for myself
I'm just thinkin' for myself
Thinkin' for myself, I'm just thinkin' for myself
I'm just thinkin' for myself
I'm just thinkin' for myself
Thinkin', I'm just thinkin' for myself
I'm just thinkin' for myself
Thinkin' for myself, I'm just thinkin' for myself
