		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Why are there so many songs about rainbows
And what's on the other side?
Rainbows are visions, but only illusions
And rainbows have nothing to hide

So we've been told and some
Choose to believe it
I know they're wrong wait and see
Someday we'll find it
The rainbow connection
The lovers, the dreamers, and me

Who said that every wish would
Be heard and answered?
Wished on the morning star
Somebody thought of that and
Someone believed it
And look what it's done so far

What's so amazing that keeps us stargazing
And what do we think we might see?
Someday we'll find it
The rainbow connection
The lovers, the dreamers, and me

All of us under it's spell
We know that it's probably magic

Have you been half asleep and
Have you heard voices?
I've heard them calling my name
Is this the sweet sound that
Call the young sailors?
The voice might be one and the same

I've heard it too many times to ignore it
It's something that I'm supposed to be
Someday we'll find it
The rainbow connection
The lovers, the dreamers, and me
