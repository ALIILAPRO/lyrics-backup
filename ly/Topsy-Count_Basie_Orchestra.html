		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They say you have no lips
For a fool such as I
They say you just believe
In hello and goodbye
And they say that the one I admire
Isn't even remotely concerned
And that I'll go on playing with fire
Until I have learned
My heart has been burned

They say I shouldn't dream
Of your face in the moon
They say all of my dreams will be
Nightmares too soon
Let them talk
Let them think what they want to
If it makes them feel happy that way
I know I'll always love you
No matter what they say
