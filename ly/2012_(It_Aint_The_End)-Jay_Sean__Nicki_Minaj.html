		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh
Jay Sean (Jay Sean, Jay Sean)
2-0-1-2 (Nicki Minaj, Nicki Minaj)
Oh (yeah, yeah)
It's alright (let's go, let's go) 
Oh, it's alright (let's go, let's go)

You know what they say
Life ain't always easy and every day
We're survivors
So forget the day
It's all about tonight 
Act a fool and start a riot, ri-riot 
Be a rebel

Bottles poppin' 'til we can't stand
We keep it rockin' 'til 6 AM
New York to London over to Japan
Turn it up, turn it up, mash it up

We gonna party like
Party like, like it's the end of the world
We gonna party like, like it's 2012
You know that it doesn't matter as long as we got each other
Turn it up, turn it up, mash it up
It ain't the end of the world (oh)
We're gonna live like it's the end of the world
Gonna party like (oh)
Turn it up, turn it up, mash it up (yeah)
It ain't the end of the world

Yo, similes, metaphors, and we pop pills
Sick flow, inundated with the doc bills
Work hard, now we know how the top feels
In the middle of the street doin' cartwheels
Lot of them try to do it, but it's not real
Wasn't a rapper then I could've got a pop deal
White curls in a hot pink Hot Wheels
Lot of bottles and a lot of fruity cocktails
Uh, days of our lives
You wink, it goes by
So we'll just get it with no edits
And anything goes, so no time for closed minds
And free my Lil' Weezy
And let's just get right
Young Money Cash Money in the building
Let's go, the world ends tonight

Have a drink with me
And let's make tonight go down in history
In history, yeah
Let's play make believe
It's the last twenty-four hours and this whole world is ours
Eternally, eternally

Hey, bottles poppin' 'til we can't stand (can't stand)
We keep it rockin' 'til 6 AM (6 AM)
New York to London over to Japan
Turn it up, turn it up, mash it up (hey, hey)

We gonna party like
Party like, like it's the end of the world (like it's the end of the world)
We gonna party like, like it's 2012 (like it's 2012)
You know that it doesn't matter as long as we got each other
Turn it up, turn it up, mash it up
Now I know, it ain't the end of the world (oh)
(We gotta live) we gonna live like it's the end of the world
We gonna party like (we gotta dance like) (oh)
So just, turn it up, turn it up, mash it up (ayy, ayy)
It ain't the end of the world

No, no, I'm not gonna follow (party like, like it's the end of the world)
Anything that they say anymore
(Party like, like it's the end of the world)
And it's never too late to start livin'
(Party like, like it's the end of the world)
So let's start it with here and right now

Party like, like it's the end of the world
We gonna party like, like it's 2012 (hey)
You know that it doesn't matter as long as we got each other
Turn it up, turn it up, mash it up
It ain't the end of the world (oh)
We gonna live like it's the end of the world
We gonna party like (oh)
Turn it up, turn it up, mash it up
It ain't the end of the world

The world
Because the world keeps spinnin'
The world keeps spinnin' around
