		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I take my drugs in doses

I been waking up to bitches in my hotel suite
We been gone on the molly
Holding onto Friday
Why you looking at me shawty
Recognizing I'm the only, only, only one that's ballin'
Only one that's ballin'
Only one who's going out the country
Gotta keep a translator for the models
Only one, I'm only reppin' fly shit only
Keep some fly shit on me, keep a fly bitch on me

Fly shit only, fly shit only
Fly shit only, fly shit only
Fly shit only, fly shit only
Fly shit only, fly shit only
Fly shit only, fly shit only
Fly shit only, fly shit only
Fly shit only, fly shit only
Fly shit only, fly shit only
Fly shit only

My trainers are matching my jacket
I'm strapped with that ratchet, I'm strapped with that Bape and that ape
I'm gone off these medicals, gone off these medicals
Maybe one day I'mma get off the drank
And maybe one day we can fuck in the bank
I made me a Porsche out of two and a quarter
I got to Morocco and lay in some foreigns
Then I go back to Onyx and find me that one I can fuck on
And touch on and turn up and turn on
We don't watch TV, we count Fettuccine
Four and a half, it's right under my beanie
I made me some snaps then I fucked on a genie
Put her in a cab and I jumped in a 'Ghini
You gon' need yellow tape when I step on the scene
When you send me an invite, I come with a bitch like
She wrapped up in plastic, got coke in the mattress
All of this shit is about living lavish
This money, these cars, and these bitches, these carats
These radical styles, I'mma give you a style
You can take it, your new style ain't gon' make you a pile

I been waking up to bitches in my hotel suite
We been gone on the molly
Holding onto Friday
Why you looking at me shawty
Recognizing I'm the only, only, only one that's ballin'
Only one that's ballin'
Only one who's going out the country
Gotta keep a translator for the models
Only one, I'm only reppin' fly shit only
Keep some fly shit on me, keep a fly bitch on me

Fly shit only, fly shit only
Fly shit only, fly shit only
Fly shit only, fly shit only
Fly shit only, fly shit only
Fly shit only, fly shit only
Fly shit only, fly shit only
Fly shit only, fly shit only
Fly shit only, fly shit only
Fly shit only

Light skinned bone the same color macaroni
Put her hair in a pony, hit a note like Tony
I know you hoes been on it, now I'm back on my lonely
And I'm back how you want it and I'm back and I'm on it
Made a film like Sony, fuck the fake and the phony
I gots cake in the morning, I rock Adidas and Margielas
I be staying at the telly, eat a sandwich out the deli
And my life is like Belly, Young Future, sincere

I been waking up to bitches in my hotel suite
We been gone on the molly
Holding onto Friday
Why you looking at me shawty
Recognizing I'm the only, only, only one that's ballin'
Only one that's ballin'
Only one who's going out the country
Gotta keep a translator for the models
Only one, I'm only reppin' fly shit only
Keep some fly shit on me, keep a fly bitch on me

Fly shit only, fly shit only
Fly shit only, fly shit only
Fly shit only, fly shit only
Fly shit only, fly shit only
Fly shit only, fly shit only
Fly shit only, fly shit only
Fly shit only, fly shit only
Fly shit only, fly shit only
Fly shit only, fly shit only
