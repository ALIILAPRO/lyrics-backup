		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sittin' over here
Starin' in your face
With lust in my eyes
Sure don't give a damn and ya
Don't know that I've been dreamin' of ya
In my fantasies
Never once you looked at me
Don't even realize that I'm wantin' you
To fulfill my needs, think what you want
Let your mind free
Run free to a place no one dares to

How many nights I've laid in bed excited over you
I've closed my eyes and thought of us a hundred different ways
I've gotten there so many times I wonder how 'bout you
Day and night, night and day
All I've got to say is

If I was your girl, oh, the things I'd do to you
I'd make you call out my name, I'd ask who it belongs to
If I was your woman, the things I'd do to you
But I'm not, so I can't
Then I won't
But if I was your girl

Allow me some time to play with your mind
And you'll get there again and again
Close your eyes and imagine my body undressed
Take your time, 'cause we've got all night, ooh
You on the rise as you're touchin' my thighs and
Let me know what you like
If you like I'll go down, da-down, down, down, da-down, down
I'll hold you in my hand and baby

Your smooth and shiny
Feels so good against my lips, sugar
I want you so bad, I can taste your love right now, baby
Day and night, night and day
All I've got to say is

If I was your girl, oh, the things I'd do to you
I'd make you call out my name, I'd ask who it belongs to
If I was your woman, the things I'd do to you
But I'm not, so I can't
Then I won't
But if I was your girl

If I was your girl, oh, the things I'd do to you
I'd make you call out my name, I'd ask who it belongs to
If I was your woman, the things I'd do to you
But I'm not, so I can't
Then I won't
But if I was your girl

I've laid in bed excited over you
One hundred different ways I've thought ya
Many, many
(Day and night, night and day)
All I got to say is

If I was your girl, oh, the things I'd do to you
I'd make you call out my name, I'd ask who it belongs to
If I was your woman, the things I'd do to you
But I'm not, so I can't
Then I won't
But if I was your girl

If I was your girl, oh, the things I'd do to you
I'd make you call out my name, I'd ask who it belongs to
If I was your woman, the things I'd do to you
But I'm not, so I can't
Then I won't
But if I was your girl

If I was your girl, oh, the things I'd do to you
I'd make you call out my name, I'd ask who it belongs to
If I was your woman, the things I'd do to you
But I'm not
