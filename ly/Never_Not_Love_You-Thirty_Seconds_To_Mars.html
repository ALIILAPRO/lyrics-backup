		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You changed, you changed my life for good
I fell, but it felt more like flying
We did, did everything we could
But sometimes love loses to timing

If it's over and we're going our separate ways
If it's over and I'm wiping the tears from your face
Maybe even if I don't ever see you again

I'll never not need you
I'll never not want you
I'll never not die inside each time I hear your name
I'll never not miss you
If I can't be with you
Even if my last memory was you walking away
I'll never not love you

We said goodbye to stop the pain
So why does it feel like we're dying?
We said we'd always be the same
Who knew, know knew that we were lying?

If it's over and we're going our separate ways
If it's over and I'm wiping the tears from your face
Maybe even if I don't ever see you again

I'll never not need you
I'll never not want you
I'll never not die inside each time I hear your name
I'll never not miss you
If I can't be with you
Even if my last memory was you walking away
I'll never not love you

I'll never not love you
If it's over and we're going our separate ways
If it's over and I'm wiping the tears from your face
Maybe even if I don't ever see you again
I'll never not love you
I'll never not love you

It was the end, but my love, what a beautiful lie
