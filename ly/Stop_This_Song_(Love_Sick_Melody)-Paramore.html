		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You say the sweetest things and I
Can't keep my heart from singing 
Along to the sound of your song
My stupid feet keep moving

To this 4/4 beat, I'm in time with you
Oh whoa oh, to this 4/4 beat I would die for you (die for you)

(Someone stop this)
I've gone too far to come back from here
But you don't have a clue
You don't know what you do to me

Won't someone stop this song
So I won't sing along
Someone stop this song
So I won't sing

Well, I never let love in so I could keep my heart from hurting
The longer that I live with this idea
The more I sink in
To this 4/4 beat I'm in time with you
Whoa, to this 4/4 beat I would die for you (stop this song)

I've gone too far to come back from here
But you don't have a clue
You don't know what you do to me
And I've come too far to get over you
And you don't have a clue
You don't know what you do to me

Won't someone stop this song
So I won't sing along
Someone stop this song
So I won't sing

Your lovesick melody 
Is gonna get the best of me tonight
But you won't get to me 
If I don't sing

It creeps in like a spider
That can't be killed, although I try and try to
Well, don't you see I'm falling?
Don't wanna love you, but I do

(Lovesick melody) Can someone stop this song?
So I won't sing along
(Lovesick melody) Can someone stop this song?
So I won't sing

Your lovesick melody 
Is gonna get the best of me tonight
But you won't get to me
No you won't get to me 'cause I won't sing
