		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Used to keep it cool
Used to be a fool
All about the bounce in my step
Watch it on the news
Whatcha gonna do?
I could hit refresh and forget
Used to keep it cool

Should I keep it light?
Stay out of the fight?
No one's gonna listen to me
If I write a song
Preaching what is wrong
Will they let me sing on TV?
Should I keep it light?
Is that right?

Way up, way up we go
Been up and down that road
Way up, way up, oh no
We gon' burn the whole house down
Watch me stand in the line
You're only serving lies
You've got something to hide
We gon' burn the whole house down
We gon' burn the whole house down

Yeah, used to let it go
Walk into the show
Gawking at the tricks up your sleeve
Too good to be true
Fool, I'm in a room
Full of entertainers and thieves
Used to let it go
Woah, oh no

Way up, way up we go
Been up and down that road
Way up, way up, oh no
We gon' burn the whole house down
Watch me stand in the line
You're only serving lies
You've got something to hide
We gon' burn the whole house down
We gon' burn the whole house down

Should I hang my head low?
Should I bite my tongue?
Or should I march with every stranger from Twitter to get shit done?
Used to hang my head low
Now I hear it loud
Every stranger from Twitter is gonna burn this down

Way up, way up we go
Been up and down that road
Way up, way up, oh no
We gon' burn the whole house down
Watch me stand in the line (whoa oh)
You're only serving lies (yeah)
You've got something to hide
We gon' burn the whole house down
(Woah oh, yeah)
We gon' burn the whole house down
We burn it down, we burn it down
We gon' burn the whole house down
