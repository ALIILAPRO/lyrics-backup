		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All I need is one
One old man is enough
Babe, you got it wrong
Just turn your fears into trust, to trust

Where'd the love go?
When all is said and done
Hey now, put your hands in the air
I'ma go through your stuff
Where'd the love go?
Put the running into run
You asking me to stay
But I never met a girl I could trust

You're sayin' those words like you hate me now (wo-oah)
Our house is burning when you're raisin' hell (wo-oah)
Here in the ashes your soul cries out (a-a-ah)
But don't be afraid of these thunderclouds
These thunderclouds, oh, no
These thunderclouds, oh, no, no

All I need is love (da-dum, dum, dum)
All I need is a word (da-dum, dum, dum)
All I need is us (da-dum, dum, dum)
You turned nouns into verbs, to verbs

Where did love go?
When all is said and done
Hey now, put your hands in the air
I'ma go through your stuff
Where did love go?
You put the running into run
You're asking me to stay
But I never met a man I could trust

You're sayin' those words like you hate me now (wo-oah)
Our house is burning when you're raisin' hell (wo-oah)
Here in the ashes your soul cries out (a-a-ah)
But don't be afraid of these thunderclouds
These thunderclouds, oh, no
These thunderclouds, oh, no, no
These thunderclouds, oh, no
These thunderclouds, oh, no, no

These thunderclouds, oh oh
These thunderclouds, oh oh oh
These thunderclouds
Oh
