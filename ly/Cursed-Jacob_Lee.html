		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They tell me it's all in my mind
They don't know, they're yet to try 
My thoughts are safer inside
And I pray it hurts less this time 
They tell me it's all in my head
They don't know, they're yet to check 
What lies within is a mess
This pill could fix it I guess
Don't say it's all in my brain
Cause I can't help being this way
I feel the changes they've made
Now I don't feel the same

Leave my secrets alone
They aren't for you to know 
I hear the knock at my door 
As they take me far from my home 
They say it's better this way
But the voices they tell me I'm sane
They think they're cleansing my veins 
As they lock me up in this place

They say, it starts in my skull
Makes its way down through my blood 
It's been with me since I was young
But they can't explain what it's from 
And I think that I've had enough
I don't know who I can trust

Leave my secrets alone
They aren't for you to know 
I hear the knock at my door 
As they take me far from my home
They say it's better this way
But the voices they tell me I'm sane
They think they're cleansing my veins
As they lock me up in this place

Leave my secrets alone
They aren't for you to know
I hear the knock at my door
As they make me vacate my bones
