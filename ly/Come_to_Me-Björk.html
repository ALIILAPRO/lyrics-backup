		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Come to me, I'll take care of you
Protect you, come, come down
You're exhausted, come lay down
You don't have to explain, I understand

You know that I adore you
You know that I love you
So don't make me say it
It would burst the bubble
Break the charm

Jump off, your building's on fire
And I'll catch you, I'll catch you
Destroy all that is keeping you down
And then I'll nurse you, I'll nurse you

I'll protect you

You know that I adore you
You know that I love you
So don't make me say it
It would burst the bubble
Break the charm
