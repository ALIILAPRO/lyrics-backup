		  Uh-uh, uh, uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
Uh-uh, uh, uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh (I've been thinkin' 'bout you)

I've been thinkin' 'bout you (ow!)
Wondering who's stuck in your head at night
Wonder if I ever cross your mind (yeah)
Keeping you up in your bed at night (ooh-ooh)
I've been thinkin' 'bout you (uh)
I can't get you off the brain (no)
Loving you is something strange (so strange)
Don't get me wrong, I ain't complainin' (nope)
I've been thinkin' 'bout you (I've been thinkin' 'bout you)
I'm wondering if your love's a game
Just kissing girls and taking names (tell me)
Is it love or entertainment?

I've been thinkin' 'bout you (ow)
Wondering who's stuck in your head at night
Wonder if I ever cross your mind
Keeping you up in your bed at night (ooh-ooh)
I've been thinkin' 'bout you ('bout, 'bout)
I try to fight it but it's hard to hide ('bout, 'bout)
I've been thinkin' 'bout you, ooh-ooh
I've been thinkin' 'bout you, ooh-ooh
I've been thinkin' 'bout you 

(Yeah) you're a habit, hard to break
(Uh) you're more than a heart can take
There's no exit, no escapin' (no)
I've been thinkin' 'bout you
Maybe you're my destiny (maybe you're my destiny)
Or maybe just a fantasy (or maybe just a fantasy)
Maybe it's just my imagination

Boy, I've been thinkin' 'bout you (ow)
Wondering who's stuck in your head at night (is it me?)
Wonder if I ever cross your mind (do I?)
Keeping you up in your bed at night (ooh)
I've been thinkin' 'bout you ('bout, 'bout)
I try to fight it but it's hard to hide ('bout, 'bout)
I've been thinkin' 'bout you, ooh-ooh
I've been thinkin' 'bout you, ooh-ooh (I've been thinkin' 'bout)

Early in the mornin' ('bout, 'bout)
Think about you all day ('bout, 'bout)
Late night in the evenin' ('bout, 'bout)
I can't get you off of my brain ('bout, 'bout)
Early in the mornin' ('bout, 'bout)
Think about you all day ('bout, 'bout)
Late night in the evenin' ('bout, 'bout)
I can't get you off of my brain ('bout, 'bout)
I've been thinkin' 'bout you

(I've been thinkin' 'bout you)
(I've been thinkin' 'bout you)
I've been thinkin' 'bout you
