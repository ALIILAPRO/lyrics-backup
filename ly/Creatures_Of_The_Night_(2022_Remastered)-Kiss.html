		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Searching in the darkness
Running from the day
Hiding from tomorrow
Nothing left to say

Victims of the moment
Future deep in doubt
Living in a whisper
Until we start to shout

Ooh, we're creatures of the night
Ooo, we're creatures of the night

Breathing in the madness
Spitting out the lies
Searching for an answer
Keep your alibis

Don't know where we're going
Just know where we've been
Remember when the clock strikes twelve
The losers always win

Ooh, we're creatures of the night
Ooh, we're creatures of the night
