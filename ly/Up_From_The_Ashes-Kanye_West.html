		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Up from the ashes, into the sky
Found a redeemer, how I survive
Boys hug their mothers, Mary and Christ
Your light has healed me, blessed with new life

I could tell you, He could show you
God in Heaven, shinin' on you
Through your message, now I know you
I come to you empty, free of my pride

(Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Praise you only, now and forever
All the glory, it belongs to You
By Christ's power, we're victorious
Been set free

I come to you empty, free of my pride
We walk by faith and not by our sight
Declaring the victory, one day at a time
God is our shepherd, light in the night
Cure for the sick, He's eyes for the blind

I could tell you, He can show you
God in Heaven, shinin' on you
Through your message, now I know you
I come to you empty, free of my pride

I come to you empty
