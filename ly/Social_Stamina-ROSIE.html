		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Verse 1
I lost touch with all my friends 
I’m in bed by 10pm
I have no social stamina 
 
I cancel on all my plans 
I commit then I don’t answer 
I can’t keep up with anyone 
 
Pre
Now I’m a desert island I know 
I push away until I’m alone 
When did I become
Someone no one loves 

I’m a broken record it shows
All I ever say is “no”
When did I become 
Someone I dont love

Chorus 
Now I dont know I don’t know who I am 
How did I 
turn into a person who I cant stand 
How did I 
Let it get this bad, now I can’t go back, now i’m all I have 
And I dont know I don’t know who I am 
 
Verse 2 
Trigger warnings in my mind 
Im so vulnerable at night 
So I watch romantic comedies 

But happy couples make me cry
I cant find someone in real life 
Always feel like somethings wrong with me 

Pre 2
Now I’m a desert island I know 
I push away until I’m alone 
When did I become
Someone no one loves 

Chorus 2
Now I dont know I don’t know who I am 
How did I 
turn into a person who I cant stand 
How did I 
Let it get this bad, now I can’t go back, now i’m all I have 
And I dont know I don’t know who I am 

Post/Outro 
And I dont know I don’t know who I am
