		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Intro/chorus

You said you wanted more
Thank God I hit ignore
You could of had it all

Baby I’d run the world
While you stay inside to cower
My friends all say 
you ain’t the one 
You ain’t the one 
Aaahhh

Verse 1

I know you miss me
Thinking of me daily 
Yeah dreaming of my lips
When you kissed me

I said girl please
You’re crying out you’re eyes
Yeah every single night
You don’t listen

Slowly you left me at the door
Baby thinking bout the 
Lies that you told me

Lately I’ve been in your
Thoughts now every single
Second your gone 

Pre chorus

You’re scared of your emotions
(Emotions)
You said dreams are what I’m made of
(Made of)

You said you wanted
You said you wanted
You said you wanted

Chorus

You said you wanted more
Thank God I hit ignore
You could of had it all

Baby I’d run the world
While you stay inside to cower
My friends all say 
you ain’t the one 
You ain’t the one 
Aaahhh

Verse 2 

I don’t wanna fight no more
Always wanna test my heart
Yeah you made me feel disarmed 
So numb

You got me so crazy
Insane I’ll fade away
Your heart still beats for me
I know you’ll stay the same

I don’t wanna fight no more
Always wanna test my heart
Yeah you made me feel disarmed 
So numb

Pre chorus 2

You’re scared of your emotions
(Emotions)
You said dreams are what I’m made of
(Made of)

You said you wanted
You said you wanted
You said you wanted

Chorus 2

You said you wanted more
Thank God I hit ignore
You could of had it all

Baby I’d run the world
While you stay inside to cower
My friends all say 
you ain’t the one 
You ain’t the one 
Aaahhh

You said you wanted more
Thank God I hit ignore
You could of had it all

Baby I’d run the world
While you stay inside to cower 
And all my friends just say 
you ain’t the one
You ain’t the one 
For me
