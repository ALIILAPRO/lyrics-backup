		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh yeah
If you got a minute
Get down your idea
It may do wonders
Maybe disappear
Who knows? Just get it down
And nothing can go wrong
Go find your rhythm
That's how you write a song (hello)

Enjoy the small things
With time they will get big
Gotta find your mission
A mission to pursue
You know you've got a talent
Whatever it may be
So work your magic
And sing along with me

Step one believe in it
And sing it all day long
Step two just roll with it
That's how you write a song
Come on

Sing, shoo-bee-doo-bee dab dab (shoo-bee-doo-bee dab dab)
Sha-ba-da-da hey (sha-ba-da-da hey)
Sing it all day long (all day long)
And that's how you write a song
Scoo-bee-doo-bee bap bap (scoo-bee-doo-bee bap bap)
Boogie boogie woogie hey (boogie boogie woogie hey)
Sing it all day long (all day long)
See, that's how you write a song

Step one believe in it
And sing it all day long
Step two just roll with it
That's how you write a song
Step one believe in it
And sing it all day long
Step two just roll with it
That's how you write a song

Step one believe in it
And sing it all day long
Step two just roll with it
That's how you write a song
Step one believe in it
And sing it all day long
Step two just roll with it
That's how you write a song

Step one believe in it
And sing it all day long
Step two just roll with it
And that's how you write a song
See, that's how you write a song
And that's how you write a song
