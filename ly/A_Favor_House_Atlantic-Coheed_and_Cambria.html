		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Your eyes tell the stories of a day you wish you could 
Recall the moments that once have 
Retrack the footsteps that brought us to this favor 
I wouldn't ask this of you 

Good eye, sniper 
Here I shoot, you run 

The words you scribbled on the walls 
With the loss of friends you didn't have 
I called you when the time is right
Are you in or are you out? 
For them all to know the end of us all 
All 

Run quick, they're behind us 
Didn't think we'd ever make it 
This close to safety in one piece 
Now you want to kill me in the act of what could maybe 
Save us from sleep and what we are 

Good eye, sniper 
Now I shoot, you run 

The words you scribbled on the walls 
With the loss of friends you didn't have 
I'll call you when the time is right
Are you in or are you out? 
For them all to know the end of us all 

Bye bye, beautiful 
Don't bother to write 
Disturbed by your words and they're calling all cars 
Face step, let down
Face step, step down

The words you scribbled on the walls 
With the loss of friends you didn't have 
I'll call you when the time is right
Are you in or are you out? 
For them all to know 

Bye bye, beautiful 
Don't bother to write 
Disturbed by your words and they're calling all cars 
Face step, let down
Face step, step down

Bye bye, beautiful 
Don't bother to write 
Disturbed by your words and they're calling all cars 
Face step, let down
Face step, step down
