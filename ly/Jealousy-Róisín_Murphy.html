		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Jealousy

This is a darker side of a beautiful feeling
Born out of chemistry and a tangle of needing
Watching you while you sleep, I'm the one who was dreaming
Oh, there'll be jealousy, there'll be jealousy, baby

But I'm not the possessive kind, no, no, no
I've never been the jealous type
You, you dominate my mind, oh, yes, you know you do
But I'm not the jealous kind, oh, no, I'm not the jealous type
The jealous kind

The jealous kind

Jealousy, jealousy, jealousy, jealousy
Jealousy, jealousy, jealousy, jealousy
Jealousy, jealousy, jealousy, jealousy
Jealousy, jealousy, jealousy, jealousy
Jealousy, jealousy, jealousy, jealousy
Jealousy (oh, jealousy)

Far from the madding crowd, something's stirring within me
Might as well let it out, let the feeling consume me
Twisted and compromised, yet I'm loving you truly
Oh, there'll be jealousy, there'll be jealousy, baby

But I've pushed you way above the line, oh, yes, I have
I've never been so out of my mind, no, no, no
You, you can't just let this slide and I know it's only right
I must be the jealous type, oh, yeah, yes, I'm the jealous kind
The jealous type
The jealous kind
The jealous kind
The jealous kind
