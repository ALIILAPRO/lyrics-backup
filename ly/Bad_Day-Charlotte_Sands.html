		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I think I'm dyin', my head is stuck
I woke up cryin', this sucks
The world is endin', it's all for what?
At least I'm trendin', uh

Parents always yellin', tellin' us to get our act together
Treat us like our feelings are fake
Actin' like we're dumb, I bite my tongue, like fine, okay, whatever
I don't really wanna explain

I had a no good, really bad, messed up day
And I'm stressed out, super sad, not okay
I'm never gettin' better, no, it's not a phase
And I like it that way (like it that way)
I had a no good, really bad, messed up day
And I'm stressed out, super sad, not okay
I'm never gettin' better, no, it's not a phase
And I like it that way (like it that way)

Can't pay attention, just give me drugs
I'm learnin' nothin', fuck
wish I felt everything less
Can I be sad for a minute and not be depressed?
I'm hangin' on by a thread
Your hands on my neck and now I'm out of breath

Parents always yellin', tellin' us to get our act together
Treat us like our feelings are fake
Actin' like we're dumb, I bite my tongue, like fine, okay, whatever
I don't really wanna explain

I had a no good, really bad, messed up day
And I'm stressed out, super sad, not okay
I'm never gettin' better, no, it's not a phase
And I like it that way (like it that way)
I had a no good, really bad, messed up day
And I'm stressed out, super sad, not okay
I'm never gettin' better, no, it's not a phase
And I like it that way (like it that way)

We should get our act together
Treat us like our feelings are fake
I'm like fine, okay, whatever
They don't even care anyway

I had a no good, really bad, messed up day
And I'm stressed out, super sad, not okay
I'm never gettin' better, no, it's not a phase
And I like it that way
I had a no good, really bad, messed up day
And I'm stressed out, super sad, not okay
I'm never gettin' better, no, it's not a phase
And I like it that way (like it that way)
