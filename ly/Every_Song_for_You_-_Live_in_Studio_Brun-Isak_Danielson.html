		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Living on a memory
As vivid as reality
Take me there
I'll do anything I swear

Brighter than the morning sun
That makes me feel all warm and fun
That's all I see
Where I wanna be

I just want to be staying
In my mind with you
that is all I need

I just want to be playing
Every song for you
you are all my dreams come true 

Sweeter than any treat
Same feeling everytime we meet
Like the first time
When you became mine

Still wishing for the same thing
Be as light as the birds wing
As when I'm with you
Baby it's true
 
I just want to be staying
In my mind with you
that is all I need

I just want to be playing
Every song for you
you are all my dreams come true 

Ooooohhhh 
Brighter than the morning sun
That makes me feel all warm and fun
Thats all I see
Where I wanna be
 
I just want to be staying
In my mind with you
that is all I need

I just want to be playing
Every song for you
you are all my dreams come true 

I write every song for you.
