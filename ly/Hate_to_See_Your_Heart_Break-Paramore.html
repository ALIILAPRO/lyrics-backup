		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There is not a single word, in the whole world
That could describe the hurt the dullest knife just sawing and back and forth
And ripping through the softest skin there ever was

How were you to know?
Well, how were you to know?

And I, I hate to see your heart break
I hate to see your eyes get darker as they close
But I've been there before
And I, I hate to see your heart break
I hate to see your eyes get darker as they close
But I've been there before

Love, happens all the time, to people who aren't kind
And heroes who are blind,
Expecting perfect script in movie scenes
Once an awkward silence mystery

How were you to know?
Well how were you to know, oh, oh?

And I, I hate to see your heart break
I hate to see your eyes, get darker as they close
But I've been there before
And I, I hate to see your heart break
I hate to see your eyes, get darker as they close
But I've been there before

For all the air that's in your lungs
For all the joy that is to come
For all the things that you're alive to feel
Just let the pain remind you hearts can heal

Well, how were you to know?
Well, how were you to know?

And I, I hate to see your heart break
I hate to see your eyes, get darker as they close
But I've been there before
And I, I hate to see your heart break
I hate to see your eyes, get darker as they close
But I've been there before
