		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I will run
After your moving car
And I will follow you
Hmm, you're my northern star

So don't drive away (don't you leave it like that, no)
You don't know how much I need you
Yeah, I feel the weight, it's crushing me (when you leave me so sad, no)
I hate to think how bad I treated you, oh yeah

So maybe take me into your room
Without you my soul is eternally doomed
You're the center of this universe
My sorry ass revolves around you
(Yeah, yeah) yeah
No, I can't do without you

I'm throwing stones at your window
To get you to notice me
Don't make me stand outside in the pouring rain
With a freshly-ripped human heart from my ribcage and a boom-box
How pathetic, babe

So don't turn away (don't you leave it like that, no)
You must know how much I need you, need you
Yeah, I can feel your pain (I'm in love with your sad soul)
I hate to think how bad I treated you
But I know a place where the darkness can't reach us

Maybe take me into your room
Without you my soul is eternally doomed
You're the center of this universe
My sorry ass revolves around you
(Yeah, yeah, yeah) yeah
No, I can't do without you

Oh, oh
No, I can't do without you, baby

Maybe take me into your room
Without you my soul is eternally doomed
You're the center of this universe
My sorry ass revolves around you, you
And again

Maybe take me into your room (into your room)
Without you my soul is eternally doomed (yeah)
You're the center of this universe
My sorry ass revolves around you
(Yeah, yeah, yeah) yeah
No, I can't do without you
