		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  All of the love we generate
The only thing that carries me on
There's nothing we need that it can't create

All of the love we generate
The only thing that carries me on
There's nothing we need that it can't create

All of the love we generate
The only thing that carries me on
There's nothing we need that it can't create

All of the love we generate
The only thing that carries me on
There's nothing we need that it can't create

All of the love we generate
The only thing that carries me on
There's nothing we need that it can't create

All of the love we generate
The only thing that carries me on
There's nothing we need that it can't create

All of the love we generate
The only thing that carries me on
All of the love we generate

All of the love we generate
The only thing that carries me on
There's nothing we need that it can't create

All of the love we generate
The only thing that carries me on
There's nothing we need that it can't create
