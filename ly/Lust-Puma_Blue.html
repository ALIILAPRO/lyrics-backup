		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't wish I was your brother
And I'm so tired of being just friends
I wanna be your lover
Or at least something close to it

'Cause honey I tried
To keep you away at night
All just to crush those eyes

'Cause it's you
I'm spiraling down into
Falling away to blue
Fading away too soon
And I'll fade into a perfect shade of grey
Falling in lust again
Dreaming you into my bed

Now we've got to stop it babe
Before it's too late, before we
Before we break these grey lines, before they wane

'Cause, honey, I'm so confused
Could I fall away to blue
Shook by the spell of it

'Cause it's you
I'm spiraling down into
Falling away to blue
Fading away too soon, yeah
And I'll fade into a perfect shade of grey
Falling in lust again
Dreaming you into my bed

'Cause it's you
I'm spiraling down into
Falling away to blue
Fading away too soon (yeah, yeah)
And I'll fade into a perfect shade of grey
Falling in lust again
Dreaming you into my bed
