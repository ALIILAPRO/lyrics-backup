		  Oh hey
I just wanna know how you doin now?
Before we hung everything were like a sign
From you weren't they oh why can't I get off you?
Oh hey
I just wanna know how you doin' now?
Before we hung everything were like a sign
From you weren't they? From you weren't they? 

Oh hey
I just wanna know how you doing now?
Before we hung everything were like a sign
From you weren't they oh why can't I get off you?
Oh hey
I just wanna know how you doin now?
Before we hung everything were like a sign
From you weren't they? From you weren't they? 
Woo woah oh

Oh hey
Oh hey
Oh hey
Oh hey

(Oh hey) can't take your lies against my rights (no)
Stop wasting my damn time (oh hey)
I lived alive you left my life (oh)
Not having crumbs anymore

Oh hey
今日は誰をみているの? 
優しいふりしているの? 
なのに愛が欲しいって言うの? 

Oh hey
それは何を裏切るの? 
気付かないふりしているの? 
放して 不安の正体はあなたなのよ

Can't take your lies
Against my rights
I lived alive
You left my life

(Oh hey) can't take your lies against my rights (no)
Stop wasting my damn time (oh hey)
I lived alive you left my life (oh)
Not having crumbs anymore

I can barely breathe
I can't walkaway
I can't let it go
How can I get rid of you?
I can't let it go
How can I get rid of you?
Woo woah oh

Why can't I get off you in my mind?
There's no reason I keep you in my mind
Why can't I get off you in my mind?
There's no reason I keep you in my mind

見えないのに聞こえるの
頭の中どこかで探し続けているの
バカみたい 消えてよ!

(Oh hey) can't take your lies against my rights (no)
Stop wasting my damn time (oh hey)
I lived alive you left my life (oh)
Not having crumbs anymore

I can barely breathe
I can't walkaway
I can't let it go
How can I get rid of you?
I can't let it go
How can I get rid of you?
Woo woah oh

Oh hey!
