		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I love all your shit talkin'
I love all your shit talkin'

You ain't got nothin' better to do with yourself
I done proved to myself, back on that rulin' myself
I got new news to tell
Act like you knew you done failed
Only true know how I feel
And only if you knew how I felt
Sniffed a lil' booch off the nail
Through with mixed-messages, through with the mail
Only a few in the field
Little bit off for the real

It's so many days I prayed to God
All this pain I couldn't seem to find a way
On a mission livin', carry on
Got my family, I'm seein' through by the days
Never late, pull up a seat and come grab a plate
Check the date, let 'em hate
This the type shit that they couldn't make
Watch the fakes
Leave 'em buzzin', thought they wasn't, huh?
Tell all your kinfolk and cousins, huh?
This is the package you ordered, huh?
Beautiful madness

On this road I find
These scars I left behind
Heaven lift me up
Heaven lift me up
On this road I find
These scars I left behind
Heaven lift me up
Heaven lift me up
