		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I went and messed up again
Went against everything you said
Summer of drinking in Trafalgar Square
Yeah, yeah
Then you threaten to send me to
Boarding school for the seventh time
I know we can't afford that
So I'm fine

Though I'm stuck in the middle of it all
Isn't life so, life so beautiful?

Paradisin'
Living my best life, drivin'
Drivin' you crazy
Paradisin'
Living my best life thrivin'
You say I'm misbehaving
But I'm just a kid, so save it
Let me have an unforgettable time of my life

First kiss in 2003
Making out, feeling carefree
But then his phone rings and
Your number's on the screen
"Oh fuck"
Hacked my MSN messenger
Blackmailed my best friend
Telling her, "Rina-"
Mom, I'm fine

Yeah, I bet you think I'm terrible
But you don't know nothing, not at all

Paradisin'
Living my best life drivin'
Drivin' you crazy
Paradisin'
Living my best life thrivin'
You say I'm misbehaving
But I'm just a kid, so save it
Let me have an unforgettable time of my life

Paradisin'
Living my best life drivin'
Drivin' you crazy
Paradisin'
Living my best life thrivin'
You say I'm misbehaving
But I'm just a kid, so save it
Let me have an unforgettable time of my life
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
