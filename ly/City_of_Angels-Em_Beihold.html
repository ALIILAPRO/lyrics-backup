		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It’s hard havin’ a heart in the city
Look at the stars, waitin' for someone to tell you you’re pretty, you’re enough
So it goes, I don’t know, what the feeling’s like to be comfortable
With a stranger in your skin
Don’t know why you let them in
We used to talk about the fakers in LA
But now you’re one of ‘em and damn it hurts to say
I should've seen it comin’ from a mile away, a mile away
You always wanted to take before you give
But what’s the fun of it
I don’t know how you live with yourself in your Hollywood house in the hills
Gives me chills
City of angels
Used to say, if you ever made it I’d be the first call
And life would stay fairly the same
Oh our friendship wouldn’t change at all
But you busted, haven’t talked in a year
I mistrusted, now it’s all comin’ clear
That you only think of yourself
May be loved, but you’re lonely as hell, oh
We used to talk about the fakers in LA
But now you’re one of ‘em, I guess you got your way
I bet you're tired of all the games you had to play, you had to play
You always wanted to take before you give
But what’s the fun of it
I don’t know how you live with yourself in your Hollywood house in the hills
Gives me chills
City of angels
That’s what they call us, right
Wish you were able
To see there’s so much more to life
Than fortune and fame
Validation and pain
When you always want more
There’s nothing to gain
We used to talk about the fakers in LA
But now you’re one of ‘em and damn it hurts to say
Damn it hurts to say
You always wanted to take before you give
But what’s the fun of it
I don’t know how you live with yourself in your Hollywood house in the hills
Gives me chills
City of angels
That's what they call us, right
Wish you were able
To see there's so much more to life
City of angels
That's what they call us, right
City of angels
