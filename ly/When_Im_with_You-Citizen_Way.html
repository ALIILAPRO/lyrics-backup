		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  These are the things that I need to pray 
Because I can't find peace any other way 
I'm a mess underneath and I'm just too scared to show it

Everything's not fine
And I'm not okay
But it's nice to know
I can come this way

When I'm with you
I feel the real me finally breaking through
It's all because of you, Jesus
Anytime, anywhere, any heartache
I'm never too much for you to take
There's only love
There's only grace
When I'm with you
Yeah, when I'm with you, yeah

Nobody knows me like you do
No need for walls, you see right through
Every hurt, every scar, every secret you just love me

Everything's not fine
And I'm not okay
But it's nice to know
I can come this way

When I'm with you
I feel the real me finally breaking through
It's all because of you, Jesus
Anytime, anywhere, any heartache
I'm never too much for you to take
There's only love
There's only grace
When I'm with you
I'm breathing in
I'm innocent
It's like my heart's on fire again
I'm not afraid 
I'm not ashamed
I'm safe when I am with you

I'm breathing in
I'm innocent
It's like my heart's on fire again
I'm not afraid 
I'm not ashamed
I'm safe when I am with you

And so I'm here just as I am
Bruised or broken
I don't have to pretend

When I'm with you
I feel the real me finally breaking through
It's all because of you, Jesus
Anytime, anywhere, any heartache
I'm never too much for you to take
There's only love
There's only grace
When I'm with you
When I'm with you
I'm breathing in
I'm innocent
It's like my heart's on fire again
I'm not afraid 
I'm not ashamed
I'm safe when I am with you

I'm breathing in
I'm innocent
It's like my heart's on fire again
I'm not afraid 
I'm not ashamed
I'm safe when I am with you
