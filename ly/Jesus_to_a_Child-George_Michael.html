		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Kindness 
In your eyes, I guess 
You heard me cry 
You smiled at me 
Like Jesus to a child 

I'm blessed 
I know 
Heaven sent 
And Heaven stole 
You smiled at me 
Like Jesus to a child 

And what have I learned 
From all this pain 
I thought I'd never feel the same 
About anyone 
Or anything again 

But now I know 
When you find your love 
When you know that it exists 
Then the lover that you miss 
Will come to you on those cold, cold nights 

When you've been loved 
When you know it holds such bliss 
Then the lover that you kissed 
Will comfort you when there's no hope in sight 

Sadness 
In my eyes 
No one guessed 
Or no one tried 
You smiled at me 
Like Jesus to a child 

Loveless and cold 
With your last breath 
You saved my soul 
You smiled at me 
Like Jesus to a child 

And what have I learned 
From all these tears 
I've waited for you all those years 
And just when it began 
He took you away 

But I still say 
When you find love 
When you know that it exists 
Then the lover that you miss 
Will come to you on those cold, cold nights 

When you've been loved 
When you know it holds such bliss 
Then the lover that you kissed 
Will comfort you when there's no hope in sight 

So the words you could not say 
I'll sing them for you 
And the love we would have made 
I'll make it for two 

For every single memory 
Has become a part of me 
You will always be 
My love 

Well, I've been loved 
So I know just what love is 
And the lover that I kissed 
Is always by my side 

Oh, the lover I still miss 
Was Jesus to a child
