		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Falling to the ground
I was anxious to be found
You can always go home
To the safety of your cloud

Don't let go
I need you to hang around
I am so broke
And foolishly in love

I turned around to love revealing
What did I learn, it's not that easy
When you get burned and go on burning light

Falling into sound
Is a less defeating path
One day we will go home
To the safety of our clouds

Don't let go
I need you to hang around
I'm so broke
And foolishly in love

I turned around, my life was changing
What did I learn, it's not that easy
When you get burned and go on burning light

Don't let go
I need you to hang around
I'm so broke
And foolishly in love

I turned around, my life was changing
What did I learn, it's not that easy
When you get burned and go on burning light
