		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Woo

Repeat after me

I am I
And I intend to go, go, go
Like Conor McGregor with a samurai sword
On roller blades
Like Vasily Lomachenko
After four pints of Gatorade
Like Kathleen Hanna with bear claws
Grabbing Trump by the pussy
Like Delia Smith after ten chardonnays
Making me a nice cookie

How'd you like them clichés?

Let's seize the day
All hold hands, chase the pricks away
Let's seize the day
All hold hands, chase the pricks away

You can do it
You can do it
Yes you can
Woo

I am I
And I intend to go go go
Like Frida Kahlo painting on the poor
On your fuck-off wall
Like Tracey Emin in her unmade bed
Listening to The Fall
Like Flava Flav in the club
Riding on the back of John Wayne
Like David Attenborough clubbing seal clubbers
With LeBron James

How'd you like them clichés?

Let's seize the day
All hold hands, chase the pricks away
Let's seize the day
All hold hands, chase the pricks away

You can do it
You can do it
You can do it
Woo

It's all about the confidence
You're Joe Cal-fucking-zaghe
You're Joe Cal-fucking-zaghe
You're Joe Cal-fucking-zaghe
You're Joe Cal-fucking-zaghe
You're Joe Cal-fucking-zaghe
You're Joe Cal-fucking-zaghe

Let's seize the day
All hold hands, chase the pricks away
Let's seize the day
All hold hands, chase the pricks away

You can do it
You can do it
