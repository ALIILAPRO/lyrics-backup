		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Voices in the air
I hear them loud and clear
Telling me to listen
Whispers in my ear
Nothing can compare
I just wanna listen

As my, world turns
The heart beats
Not only in my chest
But the heart of the streets
So when they feel this, they feel me
But I can't feel nothin', outside these Dre Beats
I am from the city of people who came from the bottom
Standing on top of what was supposed to be my coffin, what's up?
Exception shows me as the dead man walkin',
But reflections show this kid's still got it
Better be known I got the throne like I don't know that there's a king
Never grew up around a family 'cause I'm not a human being
And anyone under my bubble that's coming in my spot, the top
Let 'em have it, cause when I leave, the whole world drops
Lace up Kells

I hear voices in the air
I hear it loud and clear
Telling me to listen
Whispers in my ear
Nothing can compare
I just wanna listen

Telling me I am invincible,
I am invincible
I am invincible, oh oh
Was telling me I am invincible,
I am invincible
I am Invincible, oh oh oh

Waking up sweatin from the stress of being caged out
Everything I write is played out, like what is this?
Tear the whole page out
Man I come from holes on the wall but they don't know the past
Even if I told them at all they wouldn't know the half
So maybe I fill up my luggage with all these dreams
And pull on my black coat and my black chucks and nothing in my jeans
It's just one, til the day come like Rocky's movie scene
And I'm on top of the world, look up the screen like this is me this is Kells
Crucified by the public without the nails
Do or die in my city but clearly I never failed
Lost myself from the game when I found myself from the cell
And I found myself from the fame when I lost myself to the pills
And you cannot mess with me still, seen the boys and they winning
Underdogs of the year Cleveland boys in the building
What the fuck is a ceiling I'm taking us to the top,
And when I leave the whole world drops, Lace Up Kells

I hear voices in the air
I hear it loud and clear
Telling me to listen
Whispers in my ear
Nothing can compare
I just wanna listen

Telling me I am invincible,
I am invincible
I am invincible, oh oh
Was telling me I am invincible,
I am invincible
I am Invincible, oh oh oh
I am
