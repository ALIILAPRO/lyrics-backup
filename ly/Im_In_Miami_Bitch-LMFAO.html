		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I step on the scene
Y'all know me, cause I walk with a limp
Like a old school pimp o real o g
I'm rocking vans
I'm in the sand
I've a got a red bull and vodka up in my hand
Hey, you e looking kind of cute in that polka dot bikini, girl
Hey, this is what I want to do take of that polka dot bikini, girl

Drink all day
Play all night
Lets get it poppin'
I'm in Miami bitch
Drink all day
Play all night
Lets get it poppin' in Miami bitch

Everybody on smash, smash
Hands in the air, air
I'm feelin' on her ass, ass
Like a nigga don care. Like a nigga don care
I've gotta a plan what's your cell
We playing naked twister back in my hotel
Hey, you e looking kind of cute in that polka dot bikini, girl
Hey, this is what I want to do take of that polka dot bikini, girl

Drink all day
Play all night
Lets get it poppin'
I'm in Miami bitch
Drink all day
Play all night
Lets get it poppin' in Miami bitch

Get your hands up
Put that ass up
Get your hands up
I'm in Miami bitch
Put put that ass up
I'm in Miami bitch
Get yo get yo get yo get yo hands up
Put that put that put that put that ass up
Get yo get yo get yo get yo hands up
Put that put that put that put that ass up
Get yo get get yo hands
Put put put put that ass up
Put that ass up put that ass up
I'm in Miami bitch
Oh

Its mornin' time and the girls still there
They lying naked with some asses in the air
Anna wants it bad she's got some big kahunas
But I say Ill be back gotta get some more coronas
Hey, you e looking kind of cute in that polka dot bikini, girl
Hey, this is what I want to do take of that polka dot bikini, girl

Drink all day
Play all night
Lets get it poppin'
I'm in Miami bitch
Drink all day
Play all night
Lets get it poppin' in Miami bitch

Get your hands up
Put that ass up
Get you hands up
I'm in Miami bitch
Put put that ass up
I'm in Miami bitch
Get yo get yo get yo get yo hands up
Put that put that put that put that ass up
Get yo get yo get yo get yo hands up
Put that put that put that put that ass up
Get yo get get yo hands
Put put put put that ass up
Put that ass up put that ass up
I'm in Miami bitch
