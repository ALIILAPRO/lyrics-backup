		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  These are hard times
Put me on hold put a lid on me
Cause these are bad rhymes
The devil and his seed put a spell on me

I'm a good man
Most of the time I think I am

Now 1,2,3 put a dagger in me
And let the blood flow free like a river to drain this

Hard liquor 
To ease the pain
With nothing to lose and nothing to gain 
This hard liquor 
Puts me to sleep
It never made a promise that it could keep

These are strange times
Let the songbird sing while I shed my tears
Let the bells chime
On for my love and for all these years

I'm a strong man
I used to think, now I'm not so sure

1,2,3 put a needle in me
and let the blood flow free like a river to drain this

Hard liquor 
To ease the pain
With nothing to lose and nothing to gain 
This hard liquor 
Puts me to sleep
It never made a promise that it could keep
