		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Damn right, we take turns being wrong
I get real accountable when I'm alone
I get real about it all when I'm alone
It's so crazy missin' you when I get on

Don Julio made me a fool for you
And now I might hit your phone up
With that ra-ra-ra, missin' my da-da-da
Missin' that ah-ah-ah (ah, ah)

All of this love is toxic
All of this love is toxic
All these kisses and hugs is knock shit
You a damn drug, you're toxic

Uh, all the sex on replay
Run it back like a DJ
Surfin' on your face while you eat that
Tryna make a bad bitch behave, no
I was this way for you
Put the pussy away for you
Thinkin' I would wait for you

And that damn Don Julio made me a fool for you
And now I might hit your phone up
With that ra-ra-ra, missin' my da-da-da
Missin' that ah-ah-ah (ah, ah)

And all of this love is toxic
All of this love is toxic
All these kisses and hugs is knock shit
You a damn drug, you're toxic

Problematic (yeah)
You know that dick always been problematic (yeah)
Somehow I'm always caught in your dramatics
All in your acrobatics
You know I want the static
Tell me to throw it backwards (ooh) uh

And that damn Don Julio made me a fool for you
And I still hit your phone up
With that ra-ra-ra, missin' my da-da-da
Missin' that ah-ah-ah (ah, ah, ooh, yeah)

All of this love is toxic
All of this love is toxic
All these kisses and hugs is knock shit (take turns being wrong)
You a damn drug, you're toxic
