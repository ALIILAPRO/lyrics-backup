		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Babe
I don't wanna talk right now
Stop
I need a little space
Ohh, ohh

Wait
Didn't mean to say it like that
Stay
A little longer please
I sleep a little deeper when you're next to me

Don't you know
You're the fire in my bones
You're my heart and my home, oh
And I know
I don't say it enough
I've been down on my luck
My love
But I'll be fine in the morning
Next to you

Oh, think I'm losin' my mind again
Go slow
Touch me like you do
Love
Come a little closer now
I breathe a little deeper when I'm next to you

And don't you know
You're the fire in my bones
You're my heart and my home, oh
And I know
I don't say it enough
I've been down on my luck
My love
But I'll be fine in the morning
Next to you

Ohh, ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh

Next to you
Ohh, ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh
Next to you
Ohh, ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh
Next to you
Ohh, ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh

But I'll be fine in the morning
