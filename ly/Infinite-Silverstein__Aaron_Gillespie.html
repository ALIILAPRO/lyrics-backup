		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wanna breathe like I'm brand new
Why can't I feel like I'm supposed to?
Don't you feel the pressure I do?
Tell me this will end soon

My mind's running away a mile a minute, can't shake it off
A free fall, I'd give anything to make it stop
How can I be an optimist when all this feels

Infinite
When the darkness finds me
All this feels infinite
And the pain is blinding
All this feels

Infinite
It's infinite
Infinite
It's infinite

I gotta find some way to relate
I drew a line just so I could see straight
Erase every lie and half truth
Anything I have to

My mind's running away a mile a minute, can't shake it off
Six feet down buried in my own thoughts
How can I be an optimist when all this feels

Infinite
When the darkness finds me
All this feels infinite
And the pain is blinding
All this feels

Infinite
It's infinite
Infinite
It's infinite

When the darkness finds me
And I follow blindly
How can I keep it together when all this feels

Infinite
It's infinite
Infinite
It's infinite
(It's infinite)

It's infinite
