		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got a worm
Inside my head
A chorus line
Awake in bed
Talking in my sleep
Whispering the wishes to my sheets
On the tip of my tongue
A simple song

It's your name
It's your name
It's your name
It's your name now

I got a buzz
In my pocket
There's just one thing
I wanna see

It's your name
It's your name
It's your name
It's your name now

It's your name
It's your name
It's your name
It's your name now
