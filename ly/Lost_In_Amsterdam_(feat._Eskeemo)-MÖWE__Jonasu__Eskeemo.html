		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let's get lost, lost in Amsterdam
We'll be strolling 'round the canals and dance
Lost in Amsterdam

Baby, don't you cry
Don't believe a word of what they say
They don't treat you right
Maybe we should run away

There's a place I know
To get high and lay low
Underneath the strange red lights
And I got two one-way tickets
And zero fucks given
So baby if you're down for the ride

Let's get lost, lost in Amsterdam
Where it's you and me together
Making trouble, making friends
Let's get lost, lost in Amsterdam
We'll be strolling 'round the canals and dance
Lost in Amsterdam

Lost in Amsterdam
Lost in Amsterdam

Baby, don't you cry
I'm always gonna be there by your side
And try to make you smile
We could leave it all behind

There's a place I know
To get high and lay low
Underneath the strange red lights
And I got two one-way tickets
And zero fucks to give
So baby if you're down for the ride

Let's get lost, lost in Amsterdam
Where it's you and me together
Making trouble, making friends
Let's get lost, lost in Amsterdam
We'll be strolling 'round the canals and dance
Lost in Amsterdam

Lost in Amsterdam
Lost in Amsterdam
