		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My mumma don't tell I'm the same
My mumma don't tell me to fall in line
My mumma don't tell me to wait its fine
My mumma don't feel my heart was gone
My mumma don't tell me to walk this line

Mmm
Mmm
Mmm
Mmm

My mumma don't tell I'm the same
My mumma don't tell me to fall in line
My mumma don't tell me to wait its fine
My mumma don't feel my heart was gone
My mumma don't tell me to walk this line

Mmm
Mmm
Mmm
Mmm
