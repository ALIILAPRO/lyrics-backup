		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Early morning, awake in this city
Street lights are on and the dawn feels like ages away
I'm here every day
If I could see the day break over the ocean
As the sun burns the fog and I'm starting anew
Out in the blue

Through the calm 'fore the storm
You're with me now and then
By my side, nothing more
Out and back again
It's a call I can't ignore
Move me like the tide
When we chase that sky beyond the shore, mmm-mmm

Wind and water, father and daughter
Your stories are with me in all that I do
Now I'm writing one too
'Cause the tide keeps turning
Take me out, bring me back
Show me the truth out in the blue

Through the calm 'fore the storm
You're with me now and then
By my side, nothing more
Out and back again
It's a call I can't ignore
Move me like the tide
When we chase that sky beyond the shore, ooh-ooh

Built from salt and sand, your working hands
They held me as I learned to stand
And in your eyes, I could see there was more to me

Through the calm 'fore the storm
You're with me now and then
By my side, nothing more
Out and back again
It's a call I can't ignore
Move me like the tide
When we chase that sky beyond the shore, ooh-ooh

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
