		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You sat on broken hearts
Still I feel, I feel you moving on
And I can't cope, I feel my body burn
I feel it cold, come over, you

Oh, open me, baby
Something in the way
Something in the way that you move 
A little crazy
Something in the way
Something in the way that you move
Put it in [?]
Holding on to Hell
Holding ain't no way to know how
Eight years the time
Eat it like ya hold it
Goes around [?]

Heal, I'll heal your broken parts
I want you to love, I want you to love me well
But I can't give, I cannot give you all
I cannot give you all, no

Oh, open me, baby
Something in the way
Something in the way that you move 
A little crazy
Something in the way
Something in the way that you move
Put it in [?]
Holding on to Hell
Holding ain't no way to know how
Eight years the time
Eat it like ya hold it
Goes around [?]

Sitting down, oh, waiting, don't you
Break my thoughts
How high is the wave to go indogen
How high this sway to indulge in you more
Oh, oh, oh, baby, something in the way
Something in the way that you move

Oh, open me, baby
Something in the way
Something in the way that you move 
A little crazy
Something in the way
Something in the way that you move
Put it in [?]
Holding on to Hell
Holding ain't no way to know how
Eight years the time
Eat it like ya hold it
Goes around [?]
