		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My raps are homicide, MC's are clear like crystal
Never pack the pistol, will I use it ain't the issue
And if you insist to test us, trust me
We're official, a bite-proof style you can't get through
Knew shit was real from day one
Say one verse, then I burst with the love so I can slay hon
Ain't none, that's the answer on who's better
Want more cheese than cheddar, soon to breeze like the weather
My companion is standing on non-believers
With mics you can't test me, you lose against the SP
Blacker than Wesley, almost perfect like Gretzky
You supposed to be the best? Step up, let's see
Check one two, that means I'm coming, too
But in my song, if I say "Peace, I'm gone" that means I'm through (true)
Monster, will stomp ya, until you suffocate
Turn red, now dead is your mental state

If you didn't know before, guess you know now
It's Show & A.G. and this is how it's going down
If you didn't know before, guess you know now
It's Show & A.G. and this is how it's going down

It's the A to the G-I, still with Show B-I
I can't see why you're trying to play me when you're knee-high
To a giant, money grip, you don't know me
Try my like Opie (Cunningham) 'cause I'm low key
With the spotlight I'm not concerned
You can ask Guru and Primo cause we know it's Hard to Earn
So burn, baby, burn
It's the year of the only little big man, so wait your turn
Who can get with the man with no gimmicks?
Got the mad team like the '96 Olympics
I used to wish chicks would notice me
Now they be scheming, got them bitches feenin' like Jodeci
Hopelessly, 'cause the dialogue is tight
I rip it and split, never hog the mic
Write with my brain cells, not a pencil
Can't survive what I've been through, or rent space in my mental

If you didn't know before, guess you know now
It's Show & A.G. and this is how it's going down
If you didn't know before, guess you know now
It's Show & A.G. and this is how it's going down

If you didn't know before, guess you know now
It's Show & A.G. and this is how it's going down
If you didn't know before, guess you know now
It's Show & A.G. and this is how it's going down

Play me on some happy shit, I turn this bitch into Happy Land
Burn it down, call the fireman, hire men 'cause I'm around
So eat your Wheaties and your vitamins
I smoke a pound of the black cheeba cheeba
I'm a seer on the verse, Back and Forth like Aalyiah
From the 'ville and the have, I rocks on like Rage
Party with Arty, around the world with Wally
Artifical mic handlers get broken, I'm potent
Shit that I be quoting be having brothers open
(You'll get knocked off the topic) if you think that I can't rock it
Rush ya like Russia, call my bluff, I'm a hush ya
I'm cuckoo for Coca, you slow poke
We had this style last year, this past year we was no joke
This year, I'm getting light from gripping mics
Fans getting hype and my pockets getting right
With my nigga Trigger T.O., you know how we go
On that reel-to-reel shit, you'll feel it, fuck your ego
And peace to brother Show, who's on this track, and in fact
I'm out with no doubt, peace and it's like that
To all my fellas, I got your back (I got your back)

If you didn't know before, guess you know now
It's Show & A.G. and this is how it's going down
If you didn't know before, guess you know now
It's Show & A.G. and this is how it's going down

If you didn't know before, guess you know now
It's Show & A.G. and this is how it's going down
If you didn't know before, guess you know now
It's Show & A.G. and this is how it's going down

If you didn't know before, guess you know now
It's Show & A.G. and this is how it's going down
If you didn't know before, guess you know now
It's Show & A.G. and this is how it's going down

If you didn't know before, guess you know now
It's Show & A.G. and this is how it's going down
If you didn't know before, guess you know now
It's Show & A.G. and this is how it's going down
