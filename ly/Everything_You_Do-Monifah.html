		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  [Chorus:]
Everything you do
Comes back to you now, baby
Everything you say
Could either make me stay or go away
Everything you
It comes back to you now, baby
Everything you say
Could either make me stay or go away
There was a time when I thought I heard it all before
Then there you were walkin' through my door
You looked the part of which I've always dreamed
But was I dreamin' of reality
Talk to me

[Chorus]
You gotta be real
You gotta be true
If you want to deal with me it's up to you
'Cause whatever you do, do it right
There ain't nothin' I need more
That's just the way I like it
Hey
I knew that it would be someone like you
Is it a dream
And hey
You pick me up when I am feeling blue
You got me into you

[CHORUS:]
Talk to me
Everything you do
Everything you say
Everything you do
Everything you say

[CHORUS:]
Everything you do
Everything you say
Everything you do
Everything you say
