		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Walk
One more ride on memory lane
Stoned
Did I take my meds to drown the distress?
Dope
I walk on the line, the Polar Express
Porn
Dreamin’bout colours that’s all I’ve got left
Illusion of life
Pills in my hand
No more tears to cry
aiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaia
Emotion
Confusion
Can’t remember the note I wrote you
Emotion
Distorsion
I don’t know anything about
YOU
I don’t know
YOU
I know my mind is going down
Walk
One more ride on memory lane
Cold
Dancing in the dark that’s all I’ve got left
Illusion of life
Pills in my hand
No more tears to cry
aiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaia
Emotion
Confusion
Can’t remember the note I wrote you
Emotion
Distorsion
I don’t know anything about
YOU
I don’t know
YOU
I know my mind is going down
Emotion
Confusion
Can’t remember the note I wrote you
Emotion
Distorsion
I don’t know anything about
YOU
I don’t know
YOU
I know my mind is going down
I don’t know
YOU
I know my mind is going down
I don’t know
YOU
I know my mind is going down
I don’t know
YOU
