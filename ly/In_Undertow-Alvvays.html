		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You find a wave and try to hold on for as long as you can
You made a mistake you'd like to erase and I understand
"What's left for you and me?"
I ask that question rhetorically
Can't buy into astrology, and won't rely on the moon for anything

No turning
There's no turning
There's no turning back after what's been said
No turning
There's no turning
There's no turning back

Meditate, play solitaire, take up self defense
When you get old and faded out will you want your friends?
What's left for you and me, you respond to my question metaphorically
Don't read into psychology and won't rely on your mood for anything

No turning
There's no turning
There's no turning back after what was said
No turning
There's no turning
There's no turning back after what's been said

You find a wave and try to hold on for as long as you can
You made a mistake you'd like to erase and I understand
What's next for you and me? I'll take suggestions we toss and turn in undertow
Time to let go

There's no turning
There's no turning
There's no turning back after what's transpired
No turning
There's no turning
There's no turning back I'm so uninspired
No turning
There's no turning
There's no turning back
No turning back
