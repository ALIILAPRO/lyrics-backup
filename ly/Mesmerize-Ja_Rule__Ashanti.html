		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Haha, yeah
What up, ma?
How you been?
Yeah I know, I know, haha
It's all good

Girl, your stare, those eyes, I (love it when you look at me, baby)
Your lips, your smile, I (love it when you kiss me, baby)
Your hips, those thighs, I (love it when you fuck me, baby)
And I can't, deny I (love it when I'm wit'chu, baby)

I, got a fetish for fuckin' you wit'cha skirt on
On the backstreet in the back seat of the Yukon
What's takin' so long? I'm gettin' anxious
But patiently waitin' for you to tell a nigga to move on
Between me and you, we can find each other
Flyin' abroad in my private G-2
I ain't tryin' to G you, ma I'm tryin' to see you
Bend over, you know how we do it, feet to shoulders
Bring heat to coldest night, so ferocious
Now you street promotin' the dick game is potent
'Cause in the bed a nigga go hard like Jordan
Sweat pourin', lovin' the way you be moanin'
Grippin' the sheets, lookin' at me, lickin' at me
'Cause every woman just wanna be happy
And it's crazy, but baby, I (love it when I'm wit'chu, baby)

Girl, your stare, those eyes, I (love it when you look at me, baby)
Your lips, your smile, I (love it when you kiss me, baby)
Your hips, those thighs, I (love it when you fuck me, baby)
And I can't, deny I (love it when I'm wit'chu, baby)

I wanna get away, (get away) 'cause you know like I know
And there's a better day (better day), a-comin', I'm hooked on your lovin'
Believe me (believe me), and when you hold my body
I know you need me (need me), wait for me, baby
I've been goin' half-crazy for your love
And I was told that the sex, better than drugs
Then get addicted (addicted), boy, listen (listen)
I'm the only piece of the puzzle you're missin'
Like when we kissin' (bye, bye, bye)
You got a girl that'll (ride, ride, ride)
So take me, tonight
And do what you do to me baby

Girl, your stare, those eyes, I (love it when you look at me, baby)
Your lips, your smile, I (love it when you kiss me, baby)
Your hips, those thighs, I (love it when you fuck me, baby)
And I can't, deny I (love it when I'm wit'chu, baby)

Shorty, are you really gettin' bored with me, or him?
'Cause though I play a lot of games, I play 'em to win
(But then again I'm still young and I'm livin' my life)
You know you're right and I'm the type
To pull up to your bumper, get your number
(Baby, I can only help but wonder)
What life would be without (my sweet baby)
And you're my baby (holla if you hear me)

Oh, oh, oh, you can understand that my love is pain
And how I'm feelin' babe, it's just a woman thing
(It's a man's world, but I understand)
But there's still nothin' different boy, I stick to the plan
(You be my down ass, wit'cha round ass)
I know I'm feelin' you (like you feelin' me)
The way you're wantin' my body, the way you touch me

Girl, your stare, those eyes, I (love it when you look at me, baby)
Your lips, your smile, I (love it when you kiss me, baby)
Your hips, those thighs, I (love it when you fuck me, baby)
And I can't, deny I (love it when I'm wit'chu, baby)

I love when you touch me, baby
All over my body, baby
I love when you kiss me, baby
All over my body, baby
I love when you touch me, baby
All over my body, baby
I love when you kiss me, baby
All over my body, baby

Girl, your stare, those eyes, I (love it when you look at me, baby)
Your lips, your smile, I (love it when you kiss me, baby)
Your hips, those thighs, I (love it when you fuck me, baby)
And I can't, deny I (love it when I'm wit'chu, baby)

(Babycakes, you muthafucka, you sons of bitches)
(Ain't none of these niggas real like us)
(Ya dig? And yes sir, we're here to stay, right now, let's get into this muthafucka)
(Ya understand?)
