		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Cold endless summer days
Since you went away
Tore my heart in two
And now wandering through the night
I see the city lights
Feelin' so in need
I'll never be at peace

[Chorus]
Love you all my lifetime
Lost to you eternally
Everything in my life
Tells me we were meant to be

Strange there's always something wrong
Dreams don't last that long
What part did I play in that game
And now, now you turn away
Excuses are too late
Feelin' so in need, I'll never be at peace

[Chorus]

You make the rain and the night go away
You make the sun rise up in my sky
You make the rain and the night go away
You make the sun rise up in my sky
