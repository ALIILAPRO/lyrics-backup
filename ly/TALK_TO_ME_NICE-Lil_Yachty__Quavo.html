		  DJ Durel
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, ayy, ayy

Ayy, I bang with the main man (man)
Had the same gang since the play pin (pin)
No crystal lake, no Jason (Jason)
I see more Ms than a Mason logo (yeah)
Got a white bitch but I call her Coco (yeah)
Tint so dark, I done front the four door (skrrt)
Twenty years old, I'm twelve M's in
I'm fuckin' this hoe from the west end (yeah)
Add up them numbers, they packin' (yeah)
Check so big, make you backspin (yeah)
Fade around, play, get your butt chin (pew, pew)
Sleep with the chopper on the nightstand (yeah)
Seats in the coupe, gettin' suntan (yeah)
Stay with the stip like I'm sand man (yeah)

Fuck with the move (movie)
Gang got the shoot (woo)
Fifteen thousand (yeah, yeah)
Just for some shoes (cash)
Put it on a sprinter (sprinter)
Put it on a Lil Boat (Lil Boat)
This is not a rental (no)
I own this hoe (this hoe)
Yeah, look at these prices (prices)
Look at the ice and the way I rock these jewels
Talk to me nice (nice)
Talk to me nice, I'll pull up and I'll come through
Talk to me nice (woo)
Talk to me nice, I'll pull up and I'll come through
Talk to me nice (nice)
Talk to me nice, I'll pull up and I'll come through

(Huncho!)
Niggas get shot (shoot)
At the alpha cloud (cloud)
Pull up to the spot (spot)
Kitchen flooded out (flooded out)
Niggas love thots (whoo)
Stirfry, cookin' pots (stirfry)
More bowls than Bol Bol, huh
MOBOs, dinner, watch
Fuck on a white and red logo (smash)
Fuck nigga signed with the popos
I could still go back to the hood (hood)
And then step out and autograph photos (photos)
Gelato, biscotti, biscotto (biscotto)
Coupe too low, got pot holes
That show girl on the low my hoe
Got eight rings, on no GEICO (GEICO)

Fuck with the move (movie)
Gang got the shoot (whoo)
Fifteen thousand (yeah, yeah)
Just for some shoes (cash)
Put it on a sprinter (sprinter)
Put it on a Lil Boat (Lil Boat)
This is not a rental (no)
I own this hoe (dat way)
Yeah, look at these prices (prices)
Look at the ice and the way I rock these jewels
Talk to me nice (nice)
Talk to me nice, I'll pull up and I'll come through
Talk to me nice (woo)
Talk to me nice, I'll pull up and I'll come through
Talk to me nice (nice)
Talk to me nice, I'll pull up and I'll come through

(Lil Boat)
On God, I stay with the fire
Runnin' round town with the F on the tire
That boy a lil bitch, check his chest for the wire
These broke ass rappers need words for hire
It's Yachty, bitch, can you tell me who's flyer?
Rebound me a bitch in the esquire
She say the label the empire
Young, rich nigga, I inspire
And I need that
Never ask no one for feedback
Got a bitch that sign niggas off
Shawty love stay in rat traps
Shawty love eatin' rap snacks
At the crib with a F&N
Got a 223 and they don't kick back
Make a million, then I sit back

Fuck with the move (movie)
Gang got the shoot (whoo)
Fifteen thousand (yeah, yeah)
Just for some shoes (cash)
Put it on a sprinter (sprinter)
Put it on a lil boat (lil boat)
This is not a rental (no)
I own this hoe (dat way)
Yeah, prices
