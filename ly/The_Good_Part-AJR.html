		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  Ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah, ah-ah-ah
One two three four
Ah, ah-ah-ah
One two three four
Ah, ah-ah-ah
One two three four

Have I done my best here, or
Will I be here next year, or
Are these my best years yet?

Was looking forward to
Being important but
I'm not important yet

If you put this scene on a movie screen
Is it called a happy end?
If the world gets me
Where I'm supposed to be
Will I know I've made it then?
It's so hard

Can we skip to the good part?

Ah, ah-ah-ah
One two three four
Ah, ah-ah-ah
One two three four

If there's a good part then
I hope it's not far 'cause
I thought it'd be today (ah, ah, ah, ah)

I napped on campus and
I smoked at dances but
It didn't feel so great

If you put this scene on a movie screen
Is it called a happy end?
If the world gets me
Where I'm supposed to be
Will I know I've made it then?
It's so hard

So can we skip to the good part?

Ah, ah-ah-ah
One two three four
Ah, ah-ah-ah
One two three four (can we skip to the good part?)
Ah, ah-ah-ah (to the good part, to the good part)

One two three four
Ah, ah-ah-ah (woo-ooh, woo-ooh)
One two three four
Ah, ah-ah-ah

These things take time
Mom and dad, they have a good life
But, what am I gonna do with mine?

These things take time
Mom and dad, they have a good life
But, what the hell am I gonna do with mine?
