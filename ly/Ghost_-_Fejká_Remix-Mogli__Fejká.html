		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've got lover's grief for who I used to be
When I always knew what was right for me
I'm a ghost of myself like everyone else
Lover's grief for me and who I used to be

Home is a hole with no bones
I'm hard and constantly tired to the core 
Mh-mh-mh-mh-mh-mh-mh
I'm heavy, I'm heavy
I'm in over my head but I want more

I've got lover's grief for who I used to be
When I always knew what was right for me
I'm a ghost of myself like everyone else
Lover's grief for me and who I used to be

Take a deep breath and let go
You're too hard on yourself to grow
Mh-mh-mh-mh-mh-mh-mh

You're ready, you're ready
To run and dance with your ghosts

I've got lover's grief for who I used to be
When I always knew what was right for me
I'm a ghost of myself like everyone else
Lover's grief for me and who I used to be
I've got lover's grief for who I used to be
When I always knew what was right for me
I'm a ghost of myself like everyone else
Lover's grief for me and who I used to be (I'm a)
