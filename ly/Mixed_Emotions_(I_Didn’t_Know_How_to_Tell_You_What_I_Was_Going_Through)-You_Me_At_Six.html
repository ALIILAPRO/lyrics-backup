		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was more forgiving in the beginning
You know, you never let the good ones go
Holding onto you like rope
Talking to my memories like they would remember me
Oh, the good ones never get old
The rest of them, I let go

Ooh, when did you stop making sense?
"You're slurring your words again", he said
Strung out on the bed, I can't handle this (handle this, handle this)

Ooh, I've got mixed, mixed emotions
Ooh, I've got mixed, mixed emotions
You're a lightweight, gotta get your head straight
Hellbent on a mistake, mistake
And ooh, I've got mixed, mixed emotions

It's a little bit funny how
It all makes sense in the here and now
Oh, we were just boys back then
Hanging on by a thread
I didn't know how to tell you
What it was I had been going through
Oh, it's better left unsaid
It's been weighing me down since then

Ooh, when did you stop making sense?
"You're slurring your words again", he said
Strung out on the bed, I can't handle this (handle this, handle this)

Ooh, I've got mixed, mixed emotions
Ooh, I've got mixed, mixed emotions

So, tell me, tell me how your night went
Guess you lost your license, did they like your accent?
Ooh, I've got mixed, mixed emotions
Mixed emotions

I'm dancing on a ceiling (the ceiling, the ceiling)
But I just lost all feeling (feeling, feeling)
It's history repeating (repeating, repeating)
I'm not mind reading

I'm dancing on a ceiling (I'm not)
Like I just lost all feeling (I'm not)
It's history repeating, listening (I'm not)

Face me, tell me how I'm complex, you are codependent
Pretend to be affected, life without you isn't sweet
Face me, tell me how I'm complex, you are codependent
Pretend to be affected, life without you isn't sweet, isn't sweet

Ooh, I've got mixed, mixed emotions
Ooh, I've got mixed, mixed emotions
You're a lightweight, gotta get your head straight
Hellbent on a mistake, mistake
And ooh, I've got mixed, mixed emotions
Mixed emotions
