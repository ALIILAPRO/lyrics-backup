		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Drink shots till the bottom
Feels good so don't bother, eh
No more taming 'bout my color
I swing till I get what's the problem, problem

I ain't follow simply what I see
I go follow what I need
'Cause I see that I'm loyal
I'ma go on my speed
Even I'm slow, oh

Don't call me, I'm drivin'
I just wanna keep on ballin'
Even though when you are hatin', oh
Grab me when I'm fallin'
'Cause I make myself so lonely
You know that I'm howling (oh)

I don't celebrate till I make it till the end
Ain't time for the 'hol' up'
You want me be a shade but I'm made for a big wave
Ain't time for the 'hol' up'
I don't celebrate till I make it till the end
Ain't time for the 'hol' up'
You want me be a shade but I'm made for a big wave
Ain't time for the 'hol' up'
'Hol' up'

Full of misery
I've been tryna get this over

I'll let it be
Now I'm feeling sober (oh)

Burning like a fire
But I don't feel myself enough, oh

What's my desire
But I don't wanna feel enough

Don't call me, I'm drivin'
I just wanna keep on ballin'
Even though when you are hatin', oh
Grab me when I'm fallin'
'Cause I make myself so lonely
You know that I'm howling (oh)

I don't celebrate till I make it till the end
Ain't time for the 'hol' up'
You want me be a shade but I'm made for a big wave
Ain't time for the 'hol' up'
I don't celebrate till I make it till the end
Ain't time for the 'hol' up'
You want me be a shade but I'm made for a big wave
Ain't time for the 'hol' up'
'Hol up'
