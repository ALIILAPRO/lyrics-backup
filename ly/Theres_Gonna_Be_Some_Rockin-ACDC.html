		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well me and the boys
Are out to have some fun
Gonna put on a show
Come on, let's go

There's gonna be some rockin'
There's gonna be some rockin'
There's gonna be some rockin' at the show tonight

Every night there's a rock 'n' roll queen
Gonna quiver and quake
Gonna shake her thing

Gonna be some rockin'
There's gonna be some rockin'
There's gonna be some rockin' at the show tonight
It's a rock 'n' roll show

We got a big fat sound
Wanna to share it round
Got a big bass drum
Gonna have some fun

Gonna be some rockin'
There's gonna be some rockin'
There's gonna be some rockin' at the show tonight

Come on
There's gonna be some rockin'
There's gonna be some rockin'
There's gonna be some rockin'
There's gonna be some rockin'
There's gonna be some rockin' at the show tonight
There's gonna be some rockin'

Hey there's gonna be some rockin'
There's gonna be some rockin'
Gonna be some rockin'
There's gonna be some rockin'
There's gonna be some rockin' at the show tonight
Hey there's gonna be some rockin' at the show tonight
Oh there's gonna be some rockin' at the show tonight
