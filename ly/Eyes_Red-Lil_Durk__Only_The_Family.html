		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I love the bitches who love me and let me act crazy to other lil' bitches in public
I know some niggas got work on they stomach, then go to the gym like they work on they stomach
She tellin' me that she love me, but my mama told me to never get tricked by a woman
I don't trust niggas who be in everybody hood, like how the fuck you get my number?
How you get public defendants for fightin' a murder for one of your brothers with money?
I gave the money for lawyers, so how I divide y'all? I was just doin' it for nothin'
Hate to fall out with some niggas I loved 'cause they talk about business on regular numbers
I'm off the Xan', I done crashed the TRX truck, I had the phone in my hand
I don't be tellin' my daughter she come with her brother 'cause I hate breakin' a promise
I don't be puttin' no weed in my story, they tellin' stories like they havin' exotic
Money comin' in lil' singles, I done told shorty show her body
It be somethin' you wanna hear fresh off the rip, give her some money (hell yeah)

Give her some money, she probably wanna fuck in private
Niggas want money, they pocket watchin' 'til they eyes red (wow, wow, wow, wow)
I done pulled my Amiris halfway down, got shorty thighs red
I done pulled my Amiris halfway down, made my gun slid, uh

Deeski beat his body, he the man
Even though the witness took the stand (yeah)
1090 Jake on the 'Gram
Blastin' snitchin', show it to the fam' (yeah)
Down on the score, why you trollin' again?
Harajuku Barbie, my bitch a ten (yeah)
Never gon' go through her phone again
Seen what you saw and it hurt you for real (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Foenem be tweakin', they rollin' off pills
They grabbin' they gun and they go on the block
None of them niggas got money like I got the money
She better go fuck with a opp (yeah)
Murder time, uh (yeah), that nigga live with a clock (yeah)
Summertime, uh (yeah), Boonie gon' pour out the Wock'
Fast car, Lamborghini, skrrt (yeah)
Big prr, I'm firin' through the shirt (yeah)
Big prr, my Memphis bitch squirt (yeah)
Big prr, Shiesty in her purse (yeah, yeah)
Tiffany ones, the jeweler confirmed
Come from the bottom, I waited my turn
Celebrity bitches be sneaky as us
I promise I'll never gon' tell 'em a word (wow, wow, wow, wow, wow)

Give her some money, she probably wanna fuck in private
Niggas want money, they pocket watchin' 'til they eyes red (wow, wow, wow, wow)
I done pulled my Amiris halfway down, got shorty thighs red
I done pulled my Amiris halfway down, made my gun slid, uh
