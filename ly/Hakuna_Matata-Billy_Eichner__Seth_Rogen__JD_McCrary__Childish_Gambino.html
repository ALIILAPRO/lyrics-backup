		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hakuna matata! What a wonderful phrase!
Hakuna matata! It ain't no passing craze!
It means no worries, for the rest of your days
It's our problem-free philosophy
Hakuna matata

Hakuna matata?
Yeah, it's our motto
What's a motto?
Nothin', what's the motto with you?
Ace! Boom!
Those two words will solve all your problems
Yeah, take Pumbaa, here

Why, when he was a young warthog
When I was a young warthog
How you feelin'?
It's an emotional story
He found his aroma lacked a certain appeal
He could clear the Savannah after every meal
I'm a sensitive soul, although I seem thick-skinned
And it hurt that my friends never stood downwind
I was always here for you, and I resent that
And, oh, the shame!
Yes, he was ashamed
I thought of changin' my name!
I mean, to what? Brad?
And I got downhearted
Every time that I farted
Are you gonna stop me?
No, I'm not, you disgust me!

Hakuna matata! What a wonderful phrase!
Hakuna matata! Ain't no passing craze!
It means no worries for the rest of your days
(Yeah, sing it, kid)
It's our problem-free philosophy
Hakuna matata

Hakuna matata!
Hakuna matata!
Hakuna matata!
Hakuna matata!
Hakuna matata!
Hakuna matata!

It means no worries for the rest of your days
It's our problem-free philosophy
Hakuna matata! (Hakuna matata, hakuna matata)
Hakuna matata, yeah (hakuna matata, hakuna matata)
Hakuna matata, oh ah (hakuna matata, hakuna matata)
It means no worries for the rest of your days (hakuna matata, hakuna matata)
It's our problem-free philosophy
Hakuna matata!

One more time
Oh, no, I think we did it
I think we got this one
But we're just getting in the groove
No, let's leave 'em wanting more
Yeah, you've grown four-hundred pounds since we started
Meanwhile, I look exactly the same
It means no worries for
Will you tell him to stop?
You insisted we sing this song
I insisted? You started singing it!
Well, it's our signature song, we shouldn't be sharing it!
But it's our signature song so we have to
Look, just tell him to stop
It means no worries
Oh, now he's riffing, Pumbaa, this is a nightmare
It actually is kinda getting better
