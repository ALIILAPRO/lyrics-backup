		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When the night sets in
Color fades from my skin
And my bones wear thin i just sink in them
When the lights burn out
And you slip from my mouth a routine I'm in
I just sink in it

I don't know what you want from me
Want from me i don't know what you want

You are the shiver in my blood and my bones
And I'm growing cold oh you know
Just how to make me feel alone
And I'm growing cold

When the fear sets in
And your sheets wear thin
Will you taste me in all of the emptiness?
When I dissipate and I make you wait
Will your body grow thin from
The depths of it?

I don't know what you want from me
Want from me i don't know what you want

You are the shiver in my blood and my bones
And I'm growing cold oh you know
Just how to make me feel alone
And I'm growing cold

Vacant echos
Your Self Lingers echos
Saints echos

You stole me from myself
And I can't breathe
You stole me from myself
And I can't breathe

You are the shiver in my blood and my bones
And I'm growing cold oh you know
Just how to make me feel alone
And I'm growing cold

You are the shiver in my blood and my bones
And I'm growing cold oh you know
Just how to make me feel alone
And I'm growing cold
