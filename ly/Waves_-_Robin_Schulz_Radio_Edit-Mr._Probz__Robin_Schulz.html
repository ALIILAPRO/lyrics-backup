		  My face above the water
My feet can't touch the ground
Touch the ground, and it feels like
I can see the sands on the horizon every time (every time)
You are not around

I'm slowly drifting away (drifting away)
Wave after wave
Wave after wave
I'm slowly drifting (drifting away)
And it feels like I'm drowning
Pulling against the stream

Wave after wave

I can see the sands on the horizon every time (every time)
You are not around

I'm looking for the right words to say

I'm slowly drifting, drifting away
Wave after wave
Wave after wave
I'm slowly drifting (drifting away)
And it feels like I'm drowning
Pulling against the stream
Pulling against the
