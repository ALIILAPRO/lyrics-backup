		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take all of the time you've got in your mind and try to revive into
Walk through the city death by Camedy just for something to do
Sometimes it feels like everyone is still telling me who wants the truth
How could I feel the way that I feel and not at that point of view

Ah
Ah

Carrying away I wanted to stay but that's not the thing to do
Sometimes a wish is all that you miss 
When everything's coming true

(Coming true)

Sometimes it feels like everyone is still telling me who wants the truth
Sometimes it feels like everything real is not what you're supposed to do
Sometimes the way the things that they say, your life takes some time to tell
Sometimes the one to bring it undone, is not them but you yourself
