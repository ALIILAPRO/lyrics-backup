		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sleep tight, I'm on my way back
And feeling kinda sad
'Cause you were the best thing I never knew I had
I'm out of street-lights, I'd better make tracks
'Cause mum expects me back
But you were the best thing I never knew I had

And oh my God, I've done it again
I almost killed our friendship and I
I sure hope it's worth it
And I've got all this stuff boiling up
'Cause I got drunk and said too much, I'm
Running in circles

And now we're in the back of your car
We're gonna take it too far
God knows I've missed this
I've missed this feeling
You take off your jeans and
My heart started screaming
God knows I've missed
God knows I've missed this feeling
This feeling
This feeling
God knows I miss the feeling

Sleep tight, I'm coming right back
To you in double time
'Cause you were the best thing I never knew was mine
And it seems like I wanna rush things
I should just enjoy the ride
'Cause you were the best thing I never knew was mine

And oh my God, I can't believe
Everything was working out for me
Well, I sure hope we're worth it
'Cause I said too much I can't take back
Sorry if you weren't expecting that
We go in circles
In circles and we're

In the back of your car
We're gonna take it too far
God knows I've missed this
I've missed this feeling
You take off your jeans and
My heart started screaming
God knows I've missed this feeling

Sleep tight, I'm on my way back
And feeling kinda sad
'Cause you were the best thing I never knew I had

In the back of your car
We're gonna take it too far
God knows I've missed this
I've missed this feeling
You take off your jeans and
My heart started screaming
God knows I've missed
God knows I've missed this feeling
This feeling
This feeling

(Oh no, I must be dreaming)
(God knows I've missed)

This feeling
This feeling
This feeling
This feeling
I've missed this feeling
