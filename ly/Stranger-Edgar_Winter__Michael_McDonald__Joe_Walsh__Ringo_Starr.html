		<p>
		  Hello, pretty stranger
Can I sit here for awhile
You know I'm kinda tired & lonesome
Seems like I've been ten thousand miles
Just want to talk to you a while

You know I'm not sure where I'm goin
But I can tell you where I've been
But I guess it really doesn't matter
'cause I'm just lookin' for a friend
I might not pass this way again

Got no time, now for thinkin'
Got no time to wonder why
But I got time for one more drink babe
An I got time to say goodbye
Yes I can make it if I try

It's gettin' late, guess I'll be goin'
I hope I didn't bring you down
But yes, I can come up for a minute
If you don't mind me hangin' round
Cause I'm a stranger here in town.
Yes I'm a stranger in your town
Yes I'm a stranger here in town
