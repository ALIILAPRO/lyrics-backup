		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I swear, you've seen me
You've seen me here before
And so don't tell it, don't tell it otherwise
 
This voice, this particular voice
Yes you've heard it before, before
And so don't you dare tell it, don't you dare tell it otherwise
 
No wonder, why the road seems so long
'Cause I had done it all before
And I won
 
You felt this feeling, tell me don't be ashamed
You felt it before, before
And so don't tell me
Don't tell me otherwise
 
I almost forgot, foolish me I almost forgot
Where I am from we see the rain before the rain even starts to rain
 
No wonder why you've been buggering me
This walk is a previous journey 
And I won
Before I was born there was a storm 
Before that storm there was fire
Burning everywhere
And everything became nothing again
And then out of nothing
Out of absolutely nothing I Benjamin, I was born
So that when I become someone one day
I will always remember that I came from nothing
 
No wonder, why you've been buggering me
This walk, it's a previous journey 
 
And no wonder why the road seem so long
'Cause I had done it all before
 And I won
 
Am sending my condolence 
Am sending my condolence to fear
Am sending my condolence 
Am sending my condolence to insecurities
You should know by now
You should know by now
That I just don't care
For what you might say
Might bring someone downhill
Am sending my condolence
To fear
Am sending my condolence 
To insecuritiesâ€ƒ
