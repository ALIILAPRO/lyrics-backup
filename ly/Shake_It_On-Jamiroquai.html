		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What can I do?
I can't take up and down like this no more, babe
I need to find out where I am
Before I reach the stars
Yeah, before I step on Mars

I've been spinning and I'm blue
Thinking 'bout my life and how to change it
Crazy thoughts I'd like to leave behind
Oh yeah, it's gonna blow my mind

Deadly days and killer nights
It's hard to keep things tight
I don't have a love affair
With all these lonely flights
Promises of liquid gold
Mend my heart but not my soul, yeah

You know it won't be long
So shake it on
You know it won't be long
So shake it on
You know it won't be long
So shake it on
I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive
And now I'm movin' on
Gonna be a freak tonight

It's a solid state affair
I can feel it everywhere
Music still infecting me
Music still protecting me, yeah
Funking super starlight freaks
It's the source of our delight
If we're gonna do this thing
Let's do it and do it right
I know we can reach the stars
I know we can reach the heights, yeah
Oh yeah, I'm gonna shake it on

You, know it won't be long
So shake it on
You, know it won't be long
So shake it on
Gonna be a freak tonight
You know it won't be long
So shake it on
I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive
And now I'm movin' on
Gonna be a freak tonight

(Gonna be a freak tonight)
What can I do?
I can't take up and down like this no more, babe
Gonna be a freak tonight
What can I do?

People scream but I can't hear
I don't care too much
Crocodile and toxic tears can't kick this sense of touch
Life has lost its eloquence
But I can't sit it on the fence
Feel like being treacherous
With the music still infecting us
Gonna be a freak tonight

Gonna be a freak tonight
You, know it won't be long so shake it on
Gonna be a freak tonight
You, know it won't be long so shake it on
Gonna be a freak tonight
Gonna be a freak tonight
Gonna be a freak tonight
