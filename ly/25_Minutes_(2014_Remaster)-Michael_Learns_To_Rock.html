		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  After some time I've finally made up my mind 
She is the girl and I really want to make her mine 
I'm searching everywhere to find her again 
To tell her I love her 
And I'm sorry bout the things I've done 

I find her standing in front of the church 
The only place in town where I didn't search 
She looks so happy in her weddingdress 
But she's crying while she's saying this 

[Chorus]
Boy I've missed your kisses all the time but this is 
Twentyfive minutes too late 
Though you travelled so far boy I'm sorry your are 
Twentyfive minutes too late 

Against the wind I'm going home again 
Wishing me back to the time when we were more than friends 

But still I see her in front of the church 
The only place in town where I didn't search 
She looked so happy in her weddingdress 
But she cryed while she was saying this 

[Chorus]

Out in the streets 
Places where hungry hearts have nothing to eat 
Inside my head 
Still I can hear the words she said 

[Chorus]

I can still hear her say...
