		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell me how it all ends
Hoping that we wouldn't drift apart

I tried to be a better for you and I
Whys it like this without you in my life
I tried so hard but couldn't come out on top
Without you it's is like time could stop

Reaching, reaching for your hand in the dark
Hoping hoping that we wouldn't drift apart

You said you love me, but I know you don't
You were so shady, when you're on your own
Body of a goddess, that's hiding her horns
You bite like tiger, and sting like a bull

Stumbling, stumbling my way out the bar
Who even gave me keys to this car

I tried to be a better for you and I
Why's it like this without you in my life
I tried so hard but couldn't come out on top
Without you it's like time could stop

You said you love me, but I know you don't
You were so shady, when you're on your own
Body of a goddess, that's hiding her horns
You bite like tiger, and sting like a bull

Bottom of the bottle never seemed so old
Bottom of the bottle never so cold
Hands all bloodied up
Sipping some Henny out this solo cup
Baby why did it have to end up like this
Baby just tell me how it all ends
