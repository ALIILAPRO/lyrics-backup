		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yo, Johnny, man, it's me
I heard some shit's been going down with your girl
I'm really sorry to hear that, man, that sucks
But hey, look, if you're not doing anything tonight
We're all going out, Hollywood, Sunset strip
We're gonna have some drinks meet some girls
Start some fucking trouble and fuck, I don't know
Should be a good time, man
Maybe help you forget about your situation, I don't know
Well, hit me back if you wanna come out, peace, brother

My best friend's home while his girlfriend's sleeping around
He's drunk and he's mad, and he's looking for somebody to pound
He cheats all the time and he plays like he don't even miss her
But now he's fucking mad 'cause he knows that somebody was with her

Something must have gave me away

Yeah, if Johnny wants to fight, let him fight
Let him kick some fucking ass into the ground
Singing Hallelujah
Taking fucking shots on the rocks
With the rockers and the freaks
That turns to coke and ketamine
Shallow losers
Salvation is so far away
Yeah, if Johnny wants to fight, let him fight
Let him paint some fucking face all over the town
Singing Hallelujah

But I'm guilty and it's starting to show
The truth is the girl told me everything I needed to know
Her clothes were on the ground, she was down, she was ready to go
Anybody would have done something so natural

How the hell we'd end up this way?

Yeah, if Johnny wants to fight, let him fight
Let him kick my fuckin' ass into the ground
Singing Hallelujah
Take your fucking shot, give it everything you got
Because the people wanna see it, baby
Shallow loser
Salvation is so far away
Yeah, if Johnny wants to fight, let him get it
I'm just saying I'm not holding the town
Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah

And I'm wrong 'cause I slept with her a lot and
I wanna tell him but I think I better not
'Cause I should've fuckin' run but she's hotter than the sun
And every day she's fucking with me, take this fucking halo from me

(Yo, it's Johnny, man)
(Next time I see you, you're fucking dead)

Yeah, if Johnny wants to fight, let him fight
Let him break my fucking nose until I'm barely breathing
Hallelujah
Take your fucking shot, give it everything you got
Because your girlfriend put her body on me
Shallow loser
Salvation is so far away
Yeah, if Johnny wants to fight, let him fight
Let him paint my fucking face all over the town
Singing Hallelujah

Johnny wants to fight, yeah, uh
Johnny wants to fight, yeah, uh
Johnny wants to fight, yeah, uh
Johnny wants to fight
