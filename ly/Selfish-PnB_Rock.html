		  Oh, oh, oh
Oh

Oh, oh, oh yeah

I want you all to myself
You don't need nobody else

Oh yeah

Now that I got you here, girl I ain't gon' play wit' you (you)
Because it's a lot of things that I wanna say to you (you)
Girl, you know you the shit
Balenciaga's on ya kicks (woo)
Niggas all on ya dick but we ain't gon' trip
'Cause I'm not ready for no commitments (nah, nah)
But I swear I hate seein' you wit' them (yeah, yeah)
And I know you ain't tryna control me (-trol me)
And I know you're tired of bein' lonely
I can't help how I feel
I'm just keepin' it real
They can't have you, girl

Because I'm selfish
I want you all to myself, I swear
You don't need nobody else, I swear
I want you all to myself
Because I'm selfish, yeah
I want you all to myself, I swear
You don't need nobody else, I swear
I want you all to myself
I swear I'm selfish
I want you all to myself, I swear
You don't need nobody else, I swear
I want you all to myself
Because I'm selfish, yeah
I want you all to myself, I swear
You don't need nobody else
I want you all to myself

Shawty, I'm selfish
Can't help it you know I get stuck when you come around (yeah)
And them niggas be sick 'cause we be on some shit 
Yeah they know I'm gon' hold it down (yeah)
Pull up in da whip (skrt)
Tell you how I been wit' yo' friends
We gon' go to my crib
Have my chef cook up a dinner
Girl you know you fuckin' wit' a winner
I ain't nothing like these lames I swear
Name a place I could take you there
I'd do anything to make you laugh
And you can have anything just ask
But just know that I'm selfish
And I swear I can't help it
But it's all for you 
Yeah it's all for you

I'm selfish (selfish)
I want you all to myself, I swear
You don't need nobody else, I swear 
I want you all to myself all to myself
Because I'm selfish, yeah (yeah)
I want you all to myself, I swear
You don't need nobody else, I swear
I want you all to myself
I swear I'm selfish (yeah, yeah)
I want you all to myself, I swear
You don't need nobody else, I swear 
I want you all to myself
Because I'm selfish, yeah (yeah)
I want you all to myself, I swear
You don't need nobody else
I want you all to myself
