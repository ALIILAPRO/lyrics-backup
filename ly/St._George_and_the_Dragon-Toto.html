		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't forget you, my little Mushanga, I keep a place in my heart for you
The days of waiting, they keep getting longer, and not a thing I can do
I was a poet, a magazine writer, sent to report on political views
It was by chance, through a lens that I met you, a Kingston girl with no shoes

[Chorus]
You were runnin' down the road, I was going your way
You stopped and turned around, and lent you my hand
You smiled though you were suffering, I didn't understand, then

You broke into my heart, I saw your eyes and then I knew
You broke into my heart, like the wind and rain that followed you
You broke into my heart, had the Lord above forgotten you?
You broke in from the start, and all my tears belong to you
Mushanga, oh, Mushanga, oh

I sat and watched as she danced by the fires
Through ancient songs did the tale unfold
They sang of diamonds that came from their mountains
And loss of lives mining white man's gold

I had to leave and go back to Manhattan
Where all my stories are bought and sold
I know the city would surely be saddened, if what I knew could be told

It's been so long since I last heard your laughter
So many letters and still no news
I hope you find all the things that you're after
You know my heart is with you

[Chorus]

Mushanga, oh, Mushanga, oh 
Mushanga, oh, Mushanga, oh 
Mushanga, oh, Mushanga, oh
