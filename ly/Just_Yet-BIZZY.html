		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm comin home after 6 months 
But you're not comin after me for once
You've got your friends and I've got mine 
We split up this town, we each got a side 

cnd if we never saw each other again 
I know we'd move on and be happier 
Than we we're back then 

But I keep 
Walking into bars on your side of town 
Make sure to dress nicely hope that you're around 
I've played it over in my head 
We'll never be together again 
But I'm not ready
No, I'm not ready 
To lose you just yet 

cnd I'll admit that I was hurt when 
You didn't call when I got in and
Maybe it was on purpose 
To make me start missin us

cnd if we never saw each other again 
I know we'd move on and be happier 
Than we we're back then 

But I keep 
Walking into bars on your side of town 
Make sure to dress nicely hope that you're around 
I've played it over in my head 
We'll never be together again 
But I'm not ready
No, I'm not ready 
To lose you just yet
No, I'm not ready 
No, I'm not ready 
To lose you just yet

cnd I gotta know if you feel the same 
Cus this feeling is a lonely place
Oh I gotta know if you feel the same 
Cus this feeling is a lonely place

So I'll keep 
Walking into bars on your side of town 
Make sure to dress nicely, hope that you're around 
I've played it over in my head 
We'll never be together again 
But I'm not ready
No, I'm not ready 
To lose you just yet
No, I'm not ready 
No, I'm not ready 
To lose you just yet
