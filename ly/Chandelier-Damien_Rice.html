		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Party girls don't get hurt
Can't feel anything, when will I learn
I push it down, I push it down

I'm the one for a good time call
Phone's blowin' up, ringin' my doorbell
I feel the love, I feel the love

One, two, three, one, two, three drink
One, two, three, one, two, three drink
One, two, three, one, two, three drink
Throw 'em back, 'til I lose count

I'm gonna swing 
From the chandelier, the chandelier
I'm gonna live like tomorrow 
Doesn't exist, like it doesn't exist

Sun's up, I'm a mess
Gotta get out now, gotta run from this
Here comes the shame, here comes the shame

One, two, three, one, two, three drink
One, two, three, one, two, three drink
One, two, three, one, two, three drink
Throw 'em back 'til I lose count

I, I wanna swing 
From the chandelier, from the chandelier
I wanna live like tomorrow 
Doesn't exist, like it doesn't exist

I'm gonna fly like a bird from the night
Feel my tears as they dry
I wanna swing from the chandeliers, the chandelier

But I'm holding on for dear life
Won't look down, won't open my eyes
I keep my glass full until morning light
'Cause I'm just holding on for tonight
Help me, I'm holding on for dear life
Won't look down, won't open my eyes
I keep my glass full until morning light
'Cause I'm just holding on for tonight

On for tonight
Yes I'm just holding on for tonight
Oh, I'm just holding on for tonight
Oh, I'm just holding on for tonight
On for tonight
On for tonight

Yes I'm just holding on for tonight
Oh, I'm just holding on for tonight
On for tonight
On for tonight
