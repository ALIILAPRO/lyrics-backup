		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Welcome to hell is this where you wanna be
When you're walking with your
Soul below your feet welcome to hell
I've been there too
Flash a glare at all who dare to look at you
Welcome to hell our thumbs are mean
It's not that hard to be
A devil on your screen welcome to hell
An endless maze
But all we need to get through is today

That's it, I'm done with it
Take this petty thing I was and
Write a song with it
But it's tempting me to go
And play along with it
This song is my half of the argument

It would be easy to type it in this time
You know, you know that all's not well
I can't tell
If I can truly suffocate the shell oh well

Welcome to hell can anybody see
This masquerade of hand grenades inside of me
Welcome to hell i can't do it alone
But I refuse to think I'm truly on my own

On this trip through hell

Breaking out of prison of mind
I'm leaving behind this mindset
For good this time i'll give me a sign
I'm rhyming to remind me that
I'm more that just the fright inside
Who wants to run and hide
And cowers from the light
Pesky but he's almost gone
He's running out of lines
That wanna break my mind
And try to take my life
This time, he's got a much different sight
So I write
We're gonna make it through another night

Welcome to hell can anybody see
This masquerade of hand grenades inside of me
Welcome to hell (The bombs are going off)
I can't do it alone (But I don't care)
But I refuse to think (Come on! Come on)
I'm truly on my own (Don't stop now)
(We'll make it out somehow)

On this trip through hell

(Can anybody see)
(This masquerade of hand grenades
Inside of me) (I can't do it alone)
(But I refuse to think I'm truly on my own)

Welcome to hell is this where you wanna be
When you're walking with your
Soul below your feet welcome to hell
An endless maze
But all we need to get through is today
