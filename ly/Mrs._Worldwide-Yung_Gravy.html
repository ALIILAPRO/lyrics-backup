		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I need a bad bitch, stupid thick
Peeped them cheeks and threw a fit
Throw it back, make 'em sick
That's my lil' Florida bitch
Fine ho, bad as shit
Shawty like my favorite dish
Like the way she flick her wrist
That's my New York City bitch

I just been cookin' (cookin', cookin')
They just been lookin' (lookin')
Shawty been acting a fool
She gettin' sauce on the cushions (saucy lil' bitch)
All good, ain't no loss
You could never really have too much sauce
Beat the devil out the cheeks, Bob Ross
I'm a nuisance
Got more hoes than the state of Massachusetts
I got bands that I don't know what to do with
I might call up all my exes, get 'em new tits
Might put all my adversaries on a cruise ship
All inclusive
Bitch, my neck, wrist, ears translucent
Get my fans laid, that's my resolution
Gravy steal your bitch like the constitution

I need a bad bitch, stupid thick
Peeped them cheeks and threw a fit
Throw it back, make 'em sick
That's my lil' Toronto bitch
Fine ho, bad as shit
Shawty like my favorite dish
Like the way she flick her wrist
That's my Minnesota bitch

Hold up, wait, stop the tape
Please take a moment to get out my face
Hold up wait, park the Wraith
Shawty got a lisp, she give good fathe
Matter fact, I don't ever miss
But a bitch wit a lisp make it sound like a myth
And that makes me wanna go make math
Mass amounts of fuckin' cash
With your bitch making whoopee
Catcher in the Rye? I'm the catcher in the pussy
Wide receiver of the nookie
Pull up to Panera just to play a lil' footsie
Ahoy, chips and cookies
Gravy be the kid, got your bitch playing hooky
I need a bitch that look like Snooki
Riding through Atlanta, 'bout to boot-scoot-boogie
I need them bands now, not tomorrow
Don't make this your sayonara
I'm with Sofia Vergara
Put the R in carbonara
Old money, once upon on a time-piece
Look like Futurama
I got moms in Punta Cana
I feel like Tommy Bahama

I need a bad bitch, stupid thick
Peeped them cheeks and threw a fit
Throw it back, make 'em sick
That's my California bitch
Fine ho, bad as shit
Shawty like my favorite dish
Like the way she flick her wrist
That's my Yokohama bitch
I need a bad bitch, stupid thick
Peeped them cheeks and threw a fit
Throw it back, make 'em sick
That's my lil' Parisian bitch
Fine ho, bad as shit
Shawty like my favorite dish
Like the way she flick her wrist
That's my Tijuana bitch
