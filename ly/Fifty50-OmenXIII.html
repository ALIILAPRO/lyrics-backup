		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everything was dead
'til I walked in the door
Bitch we 'bout to smoke
So I'ma pour some more
I be smoking bleezy's
These things make me sleepy
My drugs drip for sure
So I don't sleep no more

I keep one eye open, I keep one eye closed
I keep one eye open, I keep one eye closed
I keep one eye open, I keep one eye closed
I keep one eye open, I keep one eye closed


Everything was dead
(RIP) , 'til I walked in the door (Bitch
It's me) bitch we 'bout to smoke
(Okay) , so I'ma pour some more (Okay)
I be smoking bleezy's (I do) 
These things make me sleepy (They do)
My drugs drip for sure (They do) 
So I don't sleep no more (I don't)
People lie to me
(They do) , and act like I don't see (I do)
I don't let them know
(Shh) , I just let them think (I do)
I'ma keep you close (What's up?) 
Cuz you're my enemy (What's up?)
I can't never fold
(No, no) , cuz then they know I know (No, no)

I keep one eye open
(Shh) , I keep one eye closed (Okay)
When I'm doing business
(Okay) , and even when I smoke (Okay)
I keep one eye open
(Shh) , I keep one eye closed (Okay)
Sometimes a foe's a friend (What's up?) 
Sometimes a friend's a foe (What's up?)

I keep one eye open
(Shh) , I keep one eye closed (Okay)
When I'm doing business
(Okay) , and even when I smoke (Okay)
I keep one eye open
(Shh) , I keep one eye closed (Okay)
Sometimes a foe's a friend (What's up?) 
Sometimes a friend's a foe (What's up?)
