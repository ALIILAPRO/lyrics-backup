		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you were the ocean and I was the sun 
The day made me heavy and gravity won 
I was the red and you were the blue 
I could just fade into you 

If you were a window and I was the rain 
I'd pour myself out and wash off the pain 
I'd fall like a tear so your light could shine through 
Then I'd just fade into you 

In your heart, in your head, in your arms, in your bed
'Til there's no way to know where you end and where I begin 
In your heart, in your head, in your arms, in your bed. 

If I was a shadow and you were a street 
The cobblestone midnight is where we first meet 
'Til the lights flickered out, we dance with the moon
Then I'd just fade into you 

If I was just ashes and you were the ground 
And under your willow they laid me down 
There'll be no trace that one was once two 
After I fade into you 

In your heart, in your head, in your arms, in your bed
'Til there's no way to know where you end and where I begin
In your heart, in your head, in your arms, in your bed
