		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't you
Wish you knew
All the little things that I do for you
I wish to think
I wish to think
I'm what you want (Want, want, want, want, want, want)
I give it all
I give it all
I'm not enough
I thought that we could try
I'm talking to
I'm talking to another god
I want to be there
It's so hard, not fair
It looks like D5 everywhere
I wish to think
I wish to think
I'm what you want
I give it all
I give it all
I'm not enough
