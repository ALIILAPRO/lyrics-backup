		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You've got me shaking from the way you're talking
My heart is breaking but there's no use crying
What a cyanide surprise you have left for my eyes
If I had common sense I'd cut myself or curl up and die

Sticks and stones could break my bones
But anything you say will only fuel my lungs

Don't mind us we're just spilling our guts
If this is love I don't wanna be loved
You pollute the room with a filthy tongue
Watch me choke it down so I can throw it up.

Don't mind us we're just spilling our guts
If this is love I don't wanna be hanging by the neck
Before an audience of death.

You could be the corpse and I could be the killer
If I could be the devil, you could be the sinner
You could be the drugs and I could be the dealer
Everything you say is like music to my ears

You could be the corpse and I could be the killer
If I could be the devil, you could be the sinner
You could be the drugs and I could be the dealer
Everything you say is like music to my, music to my ears

Don't mind us we're just spilling our guts
If this is love I don't wanna be loved
You pollute the room with a filthy tongue
Watch me choke it down so I can throw it up.

Don't mind us we're just spilling our guts
If this is love I don't wanna be hanging by the neck
Before an audience of death
(Before an audience)

Failure find me
To tie me up now
'Cause I'm as bad, as bad as it gets
Failure find me
To hang me up now
By my neck cause I'm a fate worse than death

What a cyanide surprise you have left for my eyes
If I had common sense I'd cut myself or curl up and die

Don't mind us we're just spilling our guts
If this is love I don't wanna be loved
You pollute the room with a filthy tongue
Watch me choke it down so I can throw it up

Don't mind us we're just spilling our guts
If this is love I don't wanna be hanging by the neck
Before an audience

Don't mind us we're just spilling our guts
If this is love I don't wanna be loved
You pollute the room with a filthy tongue
Watch me choke it down so I can

Don't mind us we're just spilling our guts
If this is love I don't wanna be hanging by the neck
Before an audience of death
