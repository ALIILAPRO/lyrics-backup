		  Chorus
Wine your body
Wriggle your belly
Dip and go down in a the new stylee
Wine and go up, wine and go down
Bubble and a rock ca the new style around
You fe line it up, you fe wine it up
Do the boomshackalak till the dance hall full up

The boomshackalak it a the brand new style
Wicked say it wicked jah jah no say it wild
Raggamuffin style fe the discipline child
Dip and go down ca it well versatile
You fe move fe your waist, move fe your back
Wine and go down do the shack-a-lak-a-lak
Get in a the groove ca you are the top notch
