		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can tell you're not a fan
Listen, baby, this a Lamborghini, not a Benz
Don't try to come around lookin' for love, it's not here (yeah)
Any time you hit me, I was never not there
I don't wanna fight, I wanna take you to Chanel ('Nel)
Can I tell you something? I just hope you never tell (yeah)
I said you was a dub, I meant to say you was a ten
I don't wanna do this shit again, aw, man
I don't wanna do this shit again, not again
Listen, baby, this a Lamborghini, not a Benz
I don't even get the time to fuck you on the weekends
Any time you pull up on me, baby, it's a secret
I don't wanna fight, I wanna fuck you in Chanel
At least you can never tell me that I'm not real
How you tellin' everybody, callin' it a secret?
Yeah, I know they wanna score on me, I'm playin' defense

Stay away from the fakes (stay away)
My nigga, stay away from the jakes
Heard them talkin' 'bout they wanna put my name on the plate
But I ain't one
I just hope you niggas wear a hoodie when the rain come
I just hope you niggas don't think you really stainless
I just hope my niggas don't ever, ever change on me
Oh, you really think you're so official? I'm the same one
They been telling me I fell off since I came up
Baby girl, listen, you're way better than a bartender
Told my niggas, "Just ten toes, stand tall, yeah"
Know my niggas won't ever, ever let me fall, nigga
I tried not to fall in love, but we all fell in
We tried to find nine-to-fives, but we was all felons
I got rich and I threw away all of my Margielas
They was jealous, when I copped a Richard, they got more jealous
More money, more bitches, I'm feelin' marvelous
And I did some fucked up shit, but I was starvin' then
No fussin', just hit 'em up, ain't no arguin'
No runnin', just spin the block, don't you talk to them
My old bitches love me, and I don't even fuck with them
Look

I can tell you're not a fan
Listen, baby, this a Lamborghini, not a Benz
Don't you come around lookin' for love, it's not here
Any time you hit me, I was never not there
I don't wanna do this shit again, not again (woah)
Listen, baby, this a Lamborghini, not a Benz (yeah)
I don't even get the time to fuck you on the weekends
Any time you pull up on me, baby, it's a secret
I don't wanna fight, I wanna fuck you in Chanel (yeah)
At least you can never tell me that I'm not real
How you tellin' everybody, callin' it a secret?
(Yeah, I know they wanna score on me, I'm playin')

You know what it is, why you never listen?
Come in through the front door, take me through the kitchen
Meet me in the back, take me through the alley
Know you want a bad girl, know you want a savage
Know that I can be that, you can't believe that
You could be a blind man, even you could see that
Runnin' through your mind and runnin' through the street next
Tell me the truth, nigga, can you keep a secret?
Baby, from my observations
You think I'm your lady, all of those expectations
But that just ain't the way it goes
And I just want you out them clothes tonight
I promise to take it slow
You can even take control this time
If you can keep your mouth closed

I don't wanna do this shit again, not again (woah)
Listen, baby, this a Lamborghini, not a Benz (yeah)
I don't even get the time to fuck you on the weekends
Any time you pull up on me, baby, it's a secret
I don't wanna fight, I wanna fuck you in Chanel (yeah)
At least you can never tell me that I'm not real
How you tellin' everybody, callin' it a secret?
Yeah, I know they wanna score on me, I'm playin' defense
