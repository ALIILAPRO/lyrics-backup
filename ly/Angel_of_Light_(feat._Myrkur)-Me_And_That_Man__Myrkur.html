		  Angel of Light (feat. Myrkur)

I crawled through the night
That was darker than black
I carried my sins
Heavy weight on my back
And I prayed to the god
Lord help me to be
But the angel of light is who listens to me

And I saw the light
And I followed its signs
You might think that I'm blind
And so out of line
You might think that I'm lost
Cause my eyes can't see
But the god from below is the one who leads me

And he's soothing my soul
And he's healing my wounds
He's a friend not a foe
He ain't throwing no stones
So I followed his light
And it's set me free
Cause Lucifer's the one who's praying for me

Crawled through the night
That was darker than black
I carried my sins
Heavy weight on my back
And I prayed to the god
Lord help me to be
But the angel of light is who listens to me
