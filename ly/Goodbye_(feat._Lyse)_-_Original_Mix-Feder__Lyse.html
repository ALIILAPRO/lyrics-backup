		  Is someone listening?
Okay
Let me tell you the story of that guy

First you loved
Then you promised
Was losing control
Crazy nights, intense sex

Now I'm living
My own life
Got you out of my path
I've been wasting
Too much time
Gonna leave you far behind

Then you ran away
Are you thinking of me when you fuck her?
Does she know you were supposed to love me 
'Til you die?
It almost killed me

Now I'm living
My own life
Got you out of my path
I've been wasting
Too much time
Gonna leave you far behind

Now I'm living
My own life
Got you out of my path
I've been wasting
Too much time
Gonna leave you far behind

Living
My own life
Got you out of my mind
I've been wasting
Too much time
Gonna leave you far behind
