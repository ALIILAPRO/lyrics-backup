		  Hey
Uh
Mm
Mm-mm
Oh

Remember last December when we kissed under the mistletoe (oh, oh)
I let you wear my favorite sweater so you think of me when you're alone (yeah)
When we stay up talking way too much and we don't even need coffee to keep us up, no
Yeah, I know that I'm feeling something right when I'm next to you, oh

Oh, oh, oh, oh
It's cold outside when I'm without you
Oh, oh, oh, oh
But you make me feel so warm

Ooh, ooh, ooh (yeah)
Baby, can't you see, can't you see that I want you?
Ooh, ooh (yeah)
Yeah, I just wanna be with you this Christmas
Mm-mm
Mm-mm-mm
This Christmas
Mm-mm
Mm-mm-mm
This Christmas

And to be honest, I can't live without you (you)
Just ask my friends, they say I'm so about you
Buy you anything you want (ayy), Gucci and Saint Laurent (yeah)
Girl, you know what I'm up, I'm just singing
Santa gon' be leaving at 5AM
Baby, I can pull up, it don't matter what time it is

Yeah, I know, it's Christmas eve
But, girl, you're all I need
I'll be there in one, two, three
Yeah, anything if I can get to you

Ooh, ooh (yeah, yeah)
Baby, can't you see, can't you see that I want you?
Ooh, ooh (yeah)
Yeah, I just wanna be with you this Christmas
Mm-mm
Mm-mm-mm
This Christmas
Mm-mm
Mm-mm-mm
This Christmas
(Yeah, yeah)
(Mm-mm-mm)
This Christmas
Oh
(Mm-mm-mm)
This Christmas
