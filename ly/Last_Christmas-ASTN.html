		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (special)

Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance, but baby you still catch my eye
Tell me, baby, do you recognize me?
Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me
"Happy Christmas," I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying, "I love you," and I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart (gave you my heart)
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (special)
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart (yes I did)
But the very next day, you gave it away (why'd you give babe?)
This year, to save me from tears (oh save me from tears)
I'll give it to someone special (special, someone special)
