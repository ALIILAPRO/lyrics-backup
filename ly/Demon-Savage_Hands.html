		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In a way I could see it
I knew I felt this coming
You believe we could fix it
Another perfect painting
Up on the wall
They see it all
Tore down the frame
We’ll all go down in flames

Did you think you could save me?
I was the only one not knowing
And all I have to say

Get on your knees and pray
That you wont see my face
I hope you made some peace with the secrets
Know I’ll make it even
Fake, you always place the blame
Now I’m picking up the pieces
Making friends with demons

I could see you were distant
You were so controlling
Like a drug, one hit
That I never needed
You got me high
Then said goodbye
I never thought you would leave

Did you think you could save me?
I was the only one not knowing
And all I have to say

Get on your knees and pray
That you wont see my face
I hope you made some peace with the secrets
Know I’ll make it even
Fake, you always place the blame
Now I’m picking up the pieces
Making friends with demons

You paint a picture, I burn it
You build a bridge and I burn it
I swear to god you earned it
Just know I’m watching, watching your life go up in flames

Get on your knees and pray
That you wont see my face
I hope you made some peace with the secrets
Know I’ll make it even
Fake, you always place the blame
Now I’m picking up the pieces
Making friends with demons
Pray that you won’t see my face
I hope you made some peace with the secrets
Know I’ll make it even
Fake, you always place the blame
Now I’m picking up the pieces
Making friends with demons
