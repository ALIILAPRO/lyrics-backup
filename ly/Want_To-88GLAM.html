		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Always on my my mind-mind-mind
Thinkin' 'bout you all the time
Gotta let you go sometime-time-time (yeah)
I (mm)

I do what I want to
I do what I want to
Had a couple dreams 'til they came true (came true)
I do what I want to
I do what I want to
I get high when I want to
Have a couple drinks, yeah, come through
I do what I want to (mm)

I can't breathe, you my lifeline
Have some mad tings at the right time
Know you like when I take my time
Know I like when you take all mine
We gon' be on top, yeah, for life-life
We gon' need a lot, this a night life
I catch feels when I take up one
Drown my action, now it's wake up time

Always on my my mind-mind-mind
Thinkin' 'bout you all the time
Gotta let you go sometime-time-time (time-time-time)
I- (mm)

I do what I want to
I do what I want to
Had a couple dreams 'til they came true (came true)
I do what I want to
I do what I want to
I get high when I want to
Have a couple drinks, yeah, come through
I do what I want to (mm)

Ain't gotta tell you twice, curtains closed, yeah
My seats is on the floor, can't do rows up
Can't do the nosebleeds, bitch, I'm close up
Have you ever seen a butterfly with the doors up?
Once you pullin' up, don't need guest list
Got a couple plus ones, got her friends in
Yeah, the way that we was flexin' is offensive
With the gang and I'm reppin' and I can't switch

Always on my my mind-mind-mind
Thinkin' 'bout you all the time
Gotta let you go sometime-time-time (yeah)
Yeah

I do what I want to
I do what I want to
Had a couple dreams 'til they came true (came true)
I do what I want to
I do what I want to
I get high when I want to
Have a couple drinks, yeah, come through
I do what I want to (mm)
