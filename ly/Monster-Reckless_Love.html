		  Monster
Monster
Come on pretty monster gimme

Hunky babe with her plastic boobs
And the poison in her skin
Bleeding stitches on the fresh cut wounds
I can feel her needle sting
Confident in her riding boots
And behind the evil grin
Beautiful like a bad tattoo
Looking like a mortal sin

A lady unnatural and shady
And I think she's like a demon aphrodisiac
I wanna she her shaking that
Shake that thing
Shake that thing

Monster, she's my favorite
Monster, she's my beautiful
Monster, she's a monster, yeah
Come on in my bed
Come on pretty monster gimme
Come on pretty monster gimme

Real eyes cannot realize
Real lies in prefect form
Forgery by a surgery
She is more than flesh on bone
Synthesized like a Frankenstein
With a lot of silicone
Superwoman and a dirty freak
Yeah, that's what turns me on (yeah)

A beauty, a different kinda cutie
And I like her sexy
Artificial body parts
I wanna lick her beauty scars
She's a thing
She's a thing

Monster, she's my favorite
Monster, she's my beautiful
Monster, she's a monster, yeah
Come on in my bed
Come on pretty monster gimme
Come on pretty monster gimme

Ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah, ah ah ah, ah, ah

Monster, she's my favorite
Monster, she's my beautiful
Monster, she's a monster, yeah
Come on in my bed
Come on pretty monster gimme
Monster, she's my favorite
Monster, she's my beautiful
Monster, she's a monster, yeah
Come on in my bed
Come on pretty monster gimme
Come on pretty monster gimme
Come on pretty monster gimme
