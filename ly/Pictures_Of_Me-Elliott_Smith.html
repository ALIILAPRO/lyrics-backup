		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Start stop and start
Stupid acting smart
Flirting with the flicks
You say it's just for kicks

You'll be the victim of your own dirty tricks
You got yourself to tease and displease
Doors swinging wide
You walked in to hide

Looking at your feet
Failure's complete
Saw you and me on the coin-op tv
Frozen in fear every time we appear

I'm not surprised and really, why should I be?
See nothing wrong
See nothing wrong
So sick and tired of all these pictures of me

Completely wrong
Totally wrong
Go walking by
Here come another guy

Jailer who sells personal hells
Who'd like to see me down on my fucking knees
Everybody's dying just to get the disease
Hey hey hey hey

I'm not surprised and really, why should I be?
See nothing wrong
See nothing wrong
So sick and tired of all these pictures of me

Completely wrong
Totally wrong
I'm not surprised and really, why should I be?
See nothing wrong

See nothing wrong
So sick and tired of all these pictures of me
Oh everybody's dying just to get the disease
Everybody's dying just to get the disease

Everybody's dying just to get the disease
