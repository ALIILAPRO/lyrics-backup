		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Each day you try on a different person,
Trying to find out who you really are.
Now I think I have a way of knowing
When I'm very close I'm not too far.

I don't know just when I really found me,
At times I wonder why it took so long.
Only thing I know is deep inside me,
When I'm there it makes me feel so strong.

Each day you try on a different person,
Trying to find out who you really are.
Now I think I have a way of knowing
When I'm very close I'm not too far.
