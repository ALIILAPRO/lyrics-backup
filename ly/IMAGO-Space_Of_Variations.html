		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I need some more
And i feel it in my bones
Desire is eonian

Rooted in me
Rooted in you
Our bug is chronic

Throw me through the prism of time
Show me what I missed and found
Lost my way in polar lights
take me to my home this night

Tell me are we blessed or are we cursed?
It seems we're doomed to slake the deepest thirst

Look into my eyes
Through the flame
I am imago
Born from the pain

Everything I thought I wanted
Was a fragile house of cards
Easily breaks what has no true foundation
I'm running out of patience
So hard to build it on the mud
Don't offer me a salvation because i smell yourÂ  bluff

The serpent cheats the sleepers
Let's keep it a secret
So scared to awake cause the price is too big
We just decide not to believe in it

I want to hear that its just a bad joke
Life's just a circus where the clown went too far

Look into my eyes
Look into my eyes

Look into my eyes
Through the flame
I am IMAGO
Born from the pain
