		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You hold it back from us
No need to hide no more

And the world's love holds me ooh ooh ooh
And the world's love holds me ooh ooh ooh

I'm gonna walk down the lane of true love
Not gonna bend or break
It's in all of us
Could it be right?
Could it be right?
Could it be?
Would it be right if we would stop this fight?
Would it be right if we would stop tonight?

And the world's love holds me ooh ooh ooh
And the world's love holds me ooh ooh ooh

And all I want is you around
All I want is you around
All I want is you around
All I want is you

And the world's love holds me ooh ooh ooh
And the world's love holds me ooh ooh ooh
