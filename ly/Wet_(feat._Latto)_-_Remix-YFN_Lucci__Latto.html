		  (Think it's a game)
Ayy, look

Sex, I need some wet shit (oh, oh)
Neck, I need some becky
Yeah, I'm a lil' manish, yeah (oh, yeah, yeah)
Kiss on your belly, yeah
She got that wet shit, yeah (oh yeah)
She got that wet shit, yeah (oh yeah, she got that wet shit)
She got that wet shit, uh 
She got that wet shit

Hey, girl, how you doin'? 
Look, I'm double-R, girl, I'm a star
Just like the ceilin' I got on my car
Just like the ceilin', girl, take off your top
Look, I'm with a hottie, so I flew that bitch to New York
I put that bitch in New York, huh
I put on Christian Dior, huh
I pull up Bentley truck, huh
I pull up Bentley truck, huh
I put my trust in her, huh
She know she just like a drug
She come through and wet me up
She my lil' freak in disguise
Gettin' head while I'm grippin' her thigh
She on my head, I don't even know why
She in the bed, we gon' need more time
She keep it wet, I don't need no dry
Fuck me good, I don't need no lies
Uh, uh, girl, glad I tried
Go and bend over, you don't even know how to ride
Love me forever, I don't need no change
Turn a nigga down when you see me on the train
Couple weeks later, when you see me, I'm your type
Next time you see a young nigga, I'ma pipe, yeah
I am not regular, this not a Tesla
I'm with a baddie, ate her like an edible
I'm in a V12 eatin' vegetables
I'm in the back of this bitch with my leg up
She got that waterfall, she got that wet stuff
She got that wet-wet, I'm tryna bless that, huh
Girl, where you want me to nut at, here?
Girl, where you want me to nut at? Yeah

Sex, I need some wet shit (oh, oh)
Neck, I need some becky
Yeah, I'm a lil' manish, yeah (oh, yeah, yeah)
Kiss on your belly, yeah
She got that wet shit, yeah (big 'Latto)
She got that wet shit, yeah (oh yeah, she got that wet shit)
She got that wet shit, uh 
She got that wet shit

He got me screamin', he got me creamin' (creamin')
I just might stay at his house for the weekend (yeah)
This pussy leakin', he got me singin'
I ain't no spitter, I swallow that semen (yeah)
I grip on them ankles when I get on top (top)
He like missionary, so then we gon' swap (swap)
After I'm done, he gon' need a mop (wet)
Treat me like a lady, fuck me like a thot (oh)
When you fuck me, look me in my eyes (eyes)
Made that pussy grip when he inside (inside)
Wake up and hit from the side (the side)
He ask me if this pussy mine (yeah)
Choke me, put it in slowly
Put it on him, make him catch the holy
Pussy smackin', soundin' like macaroni
I'ma catch them balls like a fuckin' goalie
Fuck first night, let me change your life
Man, he tryna turn me into a wife (a wife)
We be goin' crazy, got him tryna make a baby
I'm his lady, fuck it then I just might (just might)
Ride on that dick like a bike (oh)
Rap bitch, I spit on that mic (yeah)
He text me, "Come see me tonight" (tonight, mm)
I'ma fuck him on sight

Sex, I need some wet shit (oh, oh)
Neck, I need some becky
Yeah, I'm a lil' manish, yeah (oh, yeah, yeah)
Kiss on your belly, yeah
She got that wet shit, yeah (oh yeah)
She got that wet shit, yeah (oh yeah, she got that wet shit)
She got that wet shit, uh 
She got that wet shit, ayy
