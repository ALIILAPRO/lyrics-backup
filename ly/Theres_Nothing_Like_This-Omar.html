		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  
Sip a glass of cold champagne wine
The rug that we lie on feels divine
And there's no parallel for we two
Ecstasy the word of the night
Ringing in our ears, we're inflight
There's no substitution
For what we have
No others can have

There's nothing like this
There's nothing like this
No-one could ever have 
What we have
There's nothing like this

The lightest conversation has its flow
Aural communication don't you know
And I feel quite content right now
Stick with me and we'll make history
An exclusive pair in love we will be
There's no substitution 
For what we have
No others can have

There's nothing like this
There's nothing like this
There's nothing like this
Not even remotely like this

There's nothing like this
There's nothing like this
No-one could ever have 
What we have
There's nothing like this
