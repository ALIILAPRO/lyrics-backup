		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everytime I see your face pop on my phone
I don't wanna see those eyes no more
Seeing you with him, feel like my mind is froze
I don't wanna be that guy no more

I don't wanna love somebody new
I don't wanna love someone like you
I don't want a face to get used to
I don't wanna love no one but you

And if the time comes, and you need me
Then I'll be right by your side
But not a day goes, where I don't see those pictures of us in my mind

And when we close our eyes, I feel you right here by my side
Oh you're movin', oh you're movin, now you're out of sight
And when you say you lied and someone took away your light
Oh you're movin', oh you're movin' to those other guys

I don't wanna love somebody new
I don't wanna love someone like you
I don't want a face to get used to
I don't wanna love no one but you

I don't wanna love no one but you
