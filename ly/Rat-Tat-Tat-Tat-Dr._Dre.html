		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  "You really don't understand do you?
Hey man, don't you realize
In order for us to make this thing work, man
We've got to get rid of the pimps, and the pushers, and the prostitutes
And then start all over again clean"
Nigga, is you crazy?

Once again
The mighty Death Row organization commitin' mass murder
And we ain't askin' for shit, nigga we takin' it
So Dre, blast they ass nigga

Rat-tat-tat-tat, late at night with my gat
On the streets of LA
Wonderin' where the pussy at
Straight for ya, looking for a ho
Hangin' out, rollin' in my '64
Sixteen switches for the niggas in my hood
Seventeen shells, so I make it understood
Stay back, lay back, way back in the cut
Ya come outside, nigga, ya gettin' fucked up
I done told ya, creep-creep ya best move
Like Luther Vandross, I'm fuckin' up the West Coast
I'm right back up in ya when ya nut
One, two, three nut, from the D-R-E but
This is for the hoes that I used to know
When I didn't have my '64 and a lot of dough
I keep it like this and like that
And I

Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back
Rat-tat-tat-tat, tat-ta-tat like that, and I
Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back
Rat-tat-tat-tat, tat-ta-tat like that, and I
Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back

"Ooh-wee, that's that nigga owe you that grip"
"Yeah, there that fool is" (What's up?)
"Well break him off proper then" (What's up, what's happenin'?) (Yeah)
"Can I get them ends?" (What's up?)
Nigga, you delinquent, can I get those ends? 
Ayy, nigga, pay this nigga, he ain't trippin' (so what's happenin'?) 
Man, I ain't got yo' money (go 'head)
Well, yo, check this out, nigga
What's up, fool?
What's up?
What's up?
You don't want-
Yeah, motherfucker
(I'll be back though, I'll be back)
Oh yeah (nigga, you ain't never comin' back fool)

Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back
Yeah, nigga
Rat-tat-tat-tat, tat-ta-tat like that, you know I
Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back
Rat-tat-tat-tat, tat-ta-tat like that, and I
Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back
Rat-tat-tat-tat, tat-ta-tat like that, you know I
Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back (yeah)
Rat-tat-tat-tat, tat-ta-tat like that, and I
Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back

Creepin' and peepin' and we can get with these
The Chronic, slangin' fat ki's from my block
And it don't stop
Tell me where ya wanna go
To the strip
Or take a trip ballin' with the Row?
My shit off in ya system attacks
Indo smoke go in your lungs, like that
You get lifted, calm, and if it's the bomb
Taken away like Calgon, Vietnam
California, back and on a mission, provin' a point
In my game, ain't no fuckin' competition
They wishin' but run up on reality
C-P-T, C-A-L my locality
It's strange how I rearrange and change the business
By droppin' shit like this
Dope, niggas can't cope with the real
I bill, penitentiary steel, when I kill it goes

Rat-tat-tat-tat, tat-ta-tat like that, and I
Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back (yeah)
Rat-tat-tat-tat, tat-ta-tat like that, you know I
Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back
Rat-tat-tat-tat, tat-ta-tat like that, and I
Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back (hell yeah)
Rat-tat-tat-tat, tat-ta-tat like that, you know I
Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back

Straight up, now you niggaz know where my homie comin' from
So quit the chit-chat, 'fore ya find yourself flat on your bizzack, fool
It's nine-deuce, Dr. Drizzay, is sittin' on tizzop, it don't stop
Treatin' buster's just like a punk-ass cizzop
Biatch
