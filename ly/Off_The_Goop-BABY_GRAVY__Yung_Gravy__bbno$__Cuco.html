		  Off the molly, off the bean
What's this boy doin' looking so clean
She gon' call me
I'll do anything
Back in Cali, smokin' big weed
Like sheesh
I might have to cool down bringin' all the heat
I know that's yo shawty but she feelin' on my meat
If I hit it once I'ma pass her to the team
I don't want it twice (what) bitch that's not for me

She a nympho I'd rather be stayin' makin' that peso
But I can't say no to a filthy rich sugar mama with bankroll (is she rich)
Pipe the girl got the bag took both options (oof)
Stayin' loyal to my dentist cause I'm flossin'
Financially stable make it rain like Mary Poppins
Shooting creamy threes like half a pint deep like I'm Basket Robbins (smoke a fudge)
She pull and tug my shit like bitch I'm not a Bop-It (whoa)
Y'all actin' sussy, yee I think you better stop it

Woo
Bitch stop it
Drippin' like a faucet it be gettin' outta pocket
Said I walk in this bitch with a limp like Stephen Hawking (god damn)
And I pull up on yo crib and I walk in without knocking just to take yo Christmas stocking
And some top quick cause yo mom a hot bitch
But she really thoughtful bro she got yo ass a Bop-It
She be tryna roleplay call me Gravy Crockett
Gravy Train nature boy Ric Flair pop shit BABY

Off the molly, off the bean
What's this boy doin' looking so clean
She gon' call me
I'll do anything
Back in Cali, smokin' big weed
Like sheesh
I might have to cool down bringin' all the heat
I know that's yo shawty but she feelin' on my meat
If I hit it once I'ma pass her to the team
I don't want it twice (what) bitch that's not for me

Baby Gravy 2 baby
What the fuck is up shawty
We got Cuco in this hoe, he pulled up with the blunts
We got the heat
We got the heat baby

So much heat bitch I think I'm Pat Riley
I just hit yo bitch with the double fuckin' smiley
Gravy lil' spoon yeah I got yo hoe behind me
You a lil' bitch, every day my phone reminds me

Workin' all night got her thinking 'bout the dick shift
Teddy Pendergrass with the god damn pimp shit
Pulled up for the neck, left neck covered in lipstick
Still hittin' that nurse so I stay with the limp wrist

I can't find my fifth wrist you talkin' like a bitch
You gon' get yourself dismissed
Baby no business wait bitch I'm bout my business
Gravy and I bust through the door
Then we hit the dance floor and yo bitch couldn't resist

It's baby no money
We got Yung Gravy in this bitch
We got Cuco in this bitch
We hit the dance floor
We just popped (oh)
We dancing with your lady
We gonna have a good ass time
We drinkin' tequila baby
We gonna keep on goin' crazy
