		<p>
		  Real quick brother, good to see you
Long live the Rocket, long live the Rocket
How'd y'all, how'd y'all pull it together?
How did we pull it together? Rocket Power
Yeah
Yeah, Rocket Power, pulled it together
What does it mean to be out here together again?
Rocket Power (rocket power)
Yeah, yeah

Like, damn, where can I start? (Damn)
Like, damn, where can I start? (Like, damn)
Wake up and get to the guap
I'm tryna clean up the block like a mop (clean)
I'm on the phone, can't wait 'til we drop (brr)
I'm goin' hard, Migo at the top (Migo)
Get these bitches off my cup
Ain't nothin' but two and that four in the cup
Lookin' like, damn, lookin' like, damn, lookin' like, damn, where can I start? (Start)
Swim in that water, we see sharks (swim)
When we crash, it's not a car (skrr)
Young rich nigga with a broke heart (broke)
Count eight figures in the dark (cash)
That's my nigga on them narcs (woo)
High as a galaxy, we on Mars

Patek my plain
I ain't have it back in the day but shit, where can I start? (Damn)
I was at 5:30 on the Northside, nigga, at momma house on the porch (momma)
I'ma just roll one for my boy (woo), shit, yeah, light my torch (Light it)
And I never go back and forth (no)
And I promise that I'll get it by force (on God)
Remember the all white Forces (white)
Now we in all white horses (white)
We used to hit licks in Jordans (Lick)
We was takin' it, we can't afford it (Take it)
We made the North important (north)
Ride high, bus like Forgis (skrr)
This is the Migo origin (Quavo)
Just listen to the Huncho story
Shit (shit)
They call me unc' (why?)
They call me unc' 'cause my money so old (off)
We been down the same road, droppin' gems
The young nigga pick up them stones (stones)
We used to go twenty-four all gold
And now we go party in Vogue
I'ma need all new honeycomb (Ice, ice)
I'ma need all new honeycomb

Like, damn, where can I start? (Damn)
Like, damn, where can I start? (Like, damn)
Wake up and get to the guap
I'm tryna clean up the block like a mop (clean)
I'm on the phone, can't wait 'til we drop (brr)
I'm goin' hard, Migo at the top (Migo)
Get these bitches off my cup
Ain't nothin' but two and that four in the cup
Lookin' like, damn, lookin' like, damn, lookin' like, damn, where can I start? (Start)
Swim in that water, we see sharks (swim)
When we crash, it's not a car (skrr)
Young rich nigga with a broke heart (broke)
Count eight figures in the dark (cash)
That's my nigga on them narcs (woo)
High as a galaxy, we on Mars (yeah)

Where can I start? Yeah
Where can I start?
Where can I start? Yeah
Like, where can I start?
Where can I start? Yeah
Damn, where can I start? Yeah
Like, damn, damn
Where can I start?
Where can I start?
Like, damn, where can I start
Like, damn
Long live the rightful, yeah
