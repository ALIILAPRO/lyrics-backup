		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Why can we never leave quietly?
Gotta make a mess on the way out
Plan it all out, but it's make-believe
Keep on getting caught-caught
You are not not
Everything I make up in the morning
After dreams that decide my feelings
Plan it all out, but it's make-believe
Keep on getting caught-caught
You are not not

Baby, I'm sick of wasting time
Don't wanna watch you change your
Mind in five, four, three, two
One thing, I'm sick of all your doubt
Surprise, surprise, you've changed your mind
In five, four, three, two, one

(Okay, verse two)

Why do you pretend like you got enemies?
Tired of making you believe my love
I don't wanna miss you, but it's meant to be
Can't keep us apart, but you can't keep up
But you can't, can't
But you can't, can't keep up, keep up
Keep up, mm but you can't keep up
(Keep up) Mm-mm

Baby, I'm sick of wasting time
Don't wanna watch you change your
Mind in five, four, three, two
One thing, I'm sick of all your doubt
Surprise, surprise, you've changed your mind
In five, four, three, two, one

Baby, I'm sick of wasting time
Don't wanna watch you change your
Mind in five, four, three, two
