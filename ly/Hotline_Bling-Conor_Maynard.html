		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Ever since I left the city you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl, you got me down, you got me stressed out

'Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Oh late night when you needed my love
Oh late night when you needed it most

'Cause I know when that hotline bling
We were gonna be something
Yeah, I know when that hotline bling
We were gonna be something
