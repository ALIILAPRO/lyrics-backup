		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I saw you in the back of my show last night
Standing underneath the exit sign
I know it wasn't really you though
'Cause you were always in the front row
And I've been looking for love online
And maybe some of them are real good guys
They're never gonna be like you though
You set the bar above the moon, so

I don't wanna be twenty-something
And still in my head about
Seventeen, in my bedroom talking
You said that by now
We'd paint the walls of our shared apartment
You're still everything I want, and
I think we could work it out
So what are you doin' now?

Now that you finally got the job you like
I'm making money off the songs I write
I know you said that I could call you
I wonder if you wanna call too
Now that the future doesn't feel so far
It doesn't seem as wrong to want what's ours
And after everything that's happened
I wanna put it in the past tense

'Cause I don't wanna be twenty-something
And still in my head about
Seventeen, in my bedroom talking
You said that by now
We'd paint the walls of our shared apartment
You're still everything I want, and
I think we could work it out
So what are you doin' now?

Look, uh
My tongue get twisted and I don't know what to say
Should've picked up the phone, but my pride got in the way
Only nineteen and we was in and out of state
By the time I turned twenty, I was opening up for Gates
And before the money, we had everything
Should've took you out the country, but was scared of planes
All the niggas I came in the game with
Either faded or they still on the same shit
But Noonie, he lane switched
To arena tours, marble floors
Gave my life to my dream but my heart was yours
Youngin made it out the trenches, really went the distance
Something they can't ignore
Rappers pretend to be friends, but they really wanna pass me
"Wave, let's do a song," that's the first thing they ask me
Jumbotron jumpin' like I came off Degrassi
Twenty-million-dollar mansion like an athlete
But my house ain't a home 'cause I'm in it alone
Couldn't right my wrongs, so I was writin' songs
Such a successful life, but my heart is gone
Waitin' for you to call my phone
'Cause I don't-

I don't wanna be twenty-something
And still in my head about
Seventeen in my bedroom talking
You said that by now
We'd paint the walls of our shared apartment
You're still everything I want, and
I think we could work it out
So what are you doin' now?
