		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, she knows I've been writing a song
For the one that I lost
And I know it's my fault
Oh, I know I've been drowning in thoughts
And the love is too strong
Baby, you should've run

Oh, she knows I've been writing a song
For the one that I lost
And I know it's my fault
Oh, I know I've been drowning in thoughts
And the love is too strong
Baby, you should've run

Oh, she knows I've been writing a song
For the one that I lost
And I know it's my fault
Oh, I know I've been drowning in thoughts
And the love is too strong
Baby, you should've run

Oh, she knows I've been writing a song
For the one that I lost
And I know it's my fault
Oh, I know I've been drowning in thoughts
And the love is too strong
Baby, you should've run

Oh, she knows I've been writing a song
For the one that I lost
And I know it's my fault
Oh, I know I've been drowning in thoughts
And the love is too strong
Baby, you should've run
