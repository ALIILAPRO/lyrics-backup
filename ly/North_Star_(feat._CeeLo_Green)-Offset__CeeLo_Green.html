		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Shit got real, we was standin' in the rain, woah (Real)
I got four kids, know we need to spend some time, oh

I'm grindin' without the sleep (Hey)
I pray to get out of the street
I sit back and watch and see (Watch)
They plot they enemies (Plot)
They try to split the three
This shit longer than centuries (Woo)
Shit be botherin' me
I got scars under my sleeve (Scars)
The blogs is after me (Blogs is after me)
They tryna capture me (Tryna capture me)
They lyin' about the hoes, it's fuckin' my bitch up mentally (Lie)
Shit be glitter, it don't be gold the fame can fuck up your family (Lie)
It's hard to hold, I'm sorry I fold
But you can't do this shit back to me (Sorry I fold)
Sippin' on 4-4 while I'm lane switchin' (4-4)
Thinkin' about my walls let the gang get in
Niggas start crossin' out they bros let they fame get 'em (Who?)
Suckin' out my soul, she got brain difference
Throwin' up big B's, Bent' Bentyaga (Big B)
She ain't up to speed like my baby
Hop, hop in that new 'Ghini and race it (Skrrt)
This is not a dream, no fugazi (Dream, dream, dream)

Mouth wide, I'ma dive in
We from the north side
We from the north side of the island

Master of my craft, go through the rough draft
Watchin' all my maps, calculate my cap (Calculate)
This is real rap, Offset sack 'em like Warren Sapp
Music like the trap, get the product and relapse
Crown me the king, addiction to lean
But if I can't sip it then mama I can't even sleep (Yeah)
Got skeletons all in my closet, I'm scared to peek (Scared to peek)
They thought I was gon' fail if you ask me
They don't really want me on, oh so sad to me
They know I'm too strong, can't assassin me
I'ma always be good, don't feel bad for me
This the mind of a maniac, you believe in the internet (Hey)
I receive and I give it back, greet the people when in Iraq
Let me lead the pack, I'ma let everyone eat the racks (Eat)
We don't feed the rats (Feed), all I speak is facts
Autopilot on the jet, my dawg caught a lick
Mama had a nigga scared, hide the pistol 'round my shit

There is no such thing as peace or privacy
And if you felt this low down you'd get high as me
I'm beginning to question what I believe
It's so lonely in the light, it's lonely, I repeat
But I cannot cry
And I'm acting like I cannot die
But I've gotta burn brighter
Too be the north star in the dark night sky
And I just can't cry
They're acting like I cannot die
'Cause I've gotta burn brighter
Too be the north star in the dark night sky

Look up, look down and look around for me
I'll cast a shadow on the ground for me (Look high up)
'Cause I'll be high up in the sky
And I'll always be there, I will always be there
Don't look down or look around for me
I'll cast a shadow on the ground for me (Look high up)
'Cause I'll be high up in the sky
And I'll always be there, I will always be there

'Cause I'm the north star in the dark night sky
I can't cry
Yes, I could die
To be the north star in the dark night sky
Can't cry
Yes, I could die
To be the north star in the dark night sky
