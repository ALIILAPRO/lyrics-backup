		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  God I'm tired of being like this 
I can change but in a minute 
Always looking for the back door on the run 
Always at the party never quite having fun 
Play fire and you're gonna get burned 
I'm on fire and you know it hurts 
I was always on the outside looking in 
Maybe it's me cause I never wanna fit in 
Every single time 
Going outta my mind yea 
Every single time every single time every time 
Who the hell am I going out of my mind ya 
Who the hell am I 
Who the hell am I 
Who am I 

These walls are calling my name 
God I know that I gotta change now 
The roof is caving in 
I can tell by the cracks In the ceiling 
Oh and I hate it this way 
Hate it even more that way 
Yea let's all go down to the river and just jump right in 

Every single time 
Going outta my mind yea 
Every single time every single time every time 
Who the hell am I going out of my mind ya 
Who the hell am I 
Who the hell am I 
Who am I
