		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Radio
An insidious form
Helping shape thoughts
Making You conform,
Programming Music
Easy Listening
Helps you to achieve
That moronic grin
Playing you 
Regurgitated Pap
Selling products
That are mostly
Crap
Rarely hearing music
You want to hear
It has an effect 
Over all these years

Why don't you think for yourself?
Live in this self made Hell

Television
The idiot tube
Helps to raise our
Children as fools
Watch the news
They only want to see
Our awareness is 
Limited by network
VP's
Moronic sit-coms
One sided news
Alter your feeling
Give you conformist
Views
Why can't you get that
Garbage out of your
Head
You're better off to
Read a good book 
Instead

Why Can't You Think For Yourself?????
Live in this self made Hell

Newspapers
What do they say?
Not much I think
When they want
School kids to pray
Getting some facts from
Some daily news
You hate the system
But adhere to its views
Blaming the dead 
Cause they can't 
Complain
Shielding officials
Holding them 
Above the blame
You better wake up and see
What's plain to see
Or end up a willing part of the machine

Take that Liberals and Conservatives!
