		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wanna tell you how I feel
And let you know it
First time I seen you girl
I swear that you was glowing

I wanna let you know
With me you're not alone
So let it go and let it go
To where it's going

Come with it slow
Baby, come with it slowly
I wanna work your body
Just so I can hear you say

Come with it slow
Baby, come with it slowly
I wanna work your body
Just so I can hear you say

Inta Hayati, inta habibi
Min awil nazra, w sert nasibi
Inta Hayati, inta habibi
Min awil nazra, w sert nasibi

It's written all over your face
Don't try to hide it
You want my love and
If you're looking you can find it

Just know you gotta know
With me you're not alone
So when you're feeling high
You feel; you can't deny it

Come with it slow
Baby, come with it slowly
I wanna work your body
Just so I can hear you say

Come with it slow
Baby, come with it slowly
I wanna work your body
Just so I can hear you say

Inta Hayati, inta habibi
Min awil nazra, w sert nasibi
Inta Hayati, inta habibi
Min awil nazra, w sert nasibi

I know you want my lovin', girl, it shows
Come get it, come with it slow
Baby, with me you're not alone
I want it, you got it, love

Inta Hayati, inta habibi
Min awil nazra, w sert nasibi
Inta Hayati, inta habibi
Min awil nazra, w sert nasibi

I want it, you got it, love
I want it, you got it, love
