		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Time is a thing we must accept
The unexpected I sometimes fear.
Just when I feel there's no excuse for what happens,
Things fall into place
I know there is no way to avoid the pain that we must go through
to find the other half that is true
Destiny is what we all seek
Destiny was waiting for you and me

I believe behind confusion awaits the truth for us
Past the obstacles we face
I value our life and trust
Years of questioning why things happen the way they do in life
Wishing that I could turn back time,
So we could join our souls
I know there is no way to avoid the pain that we must go through
to find the other half that is true
Destiny is what we all seek
Destiny was waiting for you and me
