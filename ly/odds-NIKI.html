		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This has got to be a joke
The universe fuckin' hates my guts
Remindin' me you and I don't spell us
We share different postal codes
Maybe that's why I never got the memo
She's the real deal and I was just a pretty demo

And yet my world remains the whole of you to this day
Doesn't matter what my location says
I'm always tryna get to you
But shit just happens all the time

When I'm there you're not
You're here I'm caught up with my job
And your clingy ex comes back a lot
Then she leaves and you shoot your shot
But there's someone new I've got
And the cycle never stops no no
But there's nobody else I want oh oh
Don't care how long it takes my heart is yours to break
I'm never giving up against all odds
No no no no oh yeah

You're the mind-game mastermind but
What I'd give to make that mind mine to lose oh yeah
'Cause I know you've got somebody
My friends say I could have anybody now that I'm somebody
But I don't care if I'm nobody to you oh

I know it's pathetic but I couldn't care less
I'd wait until the stars uncross and say yes
I'll always try to get you oh

When I'm there you're not
You're here I'm caught up with my job
And your clingy ex comes back a lot
Then she leaves and you shoot your shot
But there's someone new I've got
And the cycle never stops no no
But there's nobody else I want oh
Don't care how long it takes my heart is yours to break
I'm never giving up against all odds

Never in my damn favor
I don't want you for later
Never was much of a waiter
But I'd wait on you to drink you in
Guess it serves me right for even thinkin'
When I'm there you should I don't know
Like call up your boss probably take the day off
Maybe we could change the odds

When I'm there you're not
You're here I'm caught up with my job
And your clingy ex comes back a lot
Then she leaves and you shoot your shot
But there's someone new I've got
And the cycle never stops no no (no no)
But there's nobody else I want oh
Don't care how long it takes my heart is yours to break
I'm never giving up against all odds
