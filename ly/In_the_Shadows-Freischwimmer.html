		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been watching
I've been waiting
In the shadows for my time

No sleep
No sleep until I'm done with finding the answer
Won't stop
Won't stop before I find a cure for this cancer
Sometimes I feel like going down I'm so disconnected
Somehow I know that I am haunted to be wanted

I've been watching
I've been waiting
In the shadows for my time
I've been searching
I've been living
For tomorrow's all my life
Oh oh
Oh oh
In the shadows for my time
Oh oh
Oh oh
For tomorrow's all my life

They say that I must learn to kill before I can feel safe
But I
I'd rather kill myself than turn into their slave
Sometimes I feel that I should go and play with the thunder
Somehow I just don't want to stay and wait for a wonder

I've been watching
I've been waiting
In the shadows for my time
I've been searching
I've been living
For tomorrow's all my life
Oh oh
Oh oh
In the shadows for my time
Oh oh
Oh oh
For tomorrow's all my life
I've been watching
I've been waiting
In the shadows for my time
I've been searching
I've been living
For tomorrow's all my life
