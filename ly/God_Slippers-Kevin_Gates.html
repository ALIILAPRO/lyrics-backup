		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Found my sanctuary, you heard me?
Know a nigga had to walk on water
'Cause I ain't wanna bring that back to the sanctuary
Yeah
Won't say I-
Look, you know I had, uh

Did the incapable, started a battery, got back in charge
Did it again
Haters'll hate to admit I'm amazin'
I mastered the art of incapable wins
Top of the mountain, my feather was floatin' 
On top of my head while facin' the wind
Father Creator, forgive all my sins
Almighty Creator, I need to be cleansed
Rockin' all white, spirit fulfilled
Lit up the sage inside of the Benz
Swimmin' with sharks, I get caught slippin'
I ain't doin' no boss trippin'

Did a few miracles
Walked on water in front of you niggas
I borrowed a pair of God slippers
I borrowed a pair of God slippers
Did a few miracles
I borrowed a pair of God slippers
Made 'em believe, I did a few miracles
I borrowed a pair of God slippers
Walked on water in front of you niggas
I borrowed a pair of God slippers

Me, I'm the real deal, no pretendin' (for real)
I'm with my engineer, we on business (yeah)
Cut the balloon, wrapper ink inner tube
'Bout to vacuum seal reassemble (yee)
Wide streams with the wide wings
With the grid lines I done tried things
Diamond link with the small B
With the big steps in the middle
Michael Jackson Bad with the riddles
You gotta get some fast comprehension
Moonwalkin' backwards with a lot of squares
I maneuver past competition
Last year, I was on my ass
I was doin' bad, I remember (I remember)
Said a prayer as I sped past (vroom) 
Do the dash in the Bentley (do the dash in the Bentley)

Did the incapable, started a battery, got back in charge
Did it again
Haters'll hate to admit I'm amazin'
I mastered the art of incapable wins
Top of the mountain, my feather was floatin' 
On top of my head while facin' the wind
Father Creator, forgive all my sins
Almighty Creator, I need to be cleansed
Rockin' all white, spirit fulfilled
Lit up the sage inside of the Benz
Swimmin' with sharks, I get caught slippin'
I ain't doin' no boss trippin'

Did a few miracles
Walked on water in front of you niggas
I borrowed a pair of God slippers
I borrowed a pair of God slippers
Did a few miracles
I borrowed a pair of God slippers
Made 'em believe, I did a few miracles
I borrowed a pair of God slippers
Walked on water in front of you niggas
I borrowed a pair of God slippers

She can't manipulate me, she got frustrated
She done reach the point of no return (return)
Go live with what you did and don't return
I'm up in rank, I had to wait my turn (my turn)
Hm, chief finally got my turn
Speakin' out of turn, one day you gon' learn
Made my heart hurt, now you in your feelings
Cry me a river, I am not concerned (I am not concerned)
Ain't gettin' mushy, we keepin' it pushin'
I'm stretchin' my muscle, I know how to hustle
Wealth of experience, I come out the gutter
You come out the mud, you could come out from nothin'
Bought me a brick, I done cut down the hundreds
Supplyin' them junkies, controllin' the summer
Trampoline trappers supportin' my youngins
Breadwinner package, you know I'm comin'

Did the incapable, started a battery, got back in charge
Did it again
Haters'll hate to admit I'm amazin'
I mastered the art of incapable wins
Top of the mountain, my feather was floatin' 
On top of my head while facin' the wind
Father Creator, forgive all my sins
Almighty Creator, I need to be cleansed
Rockin' all white, spirit fulfilled
Lit up the sage inside of the Benz
Swimmin' with sharks, I get caught slippin'
I ain't doin' no boss trippin'

Did a few miracles
Walked on water in front of you niggas
I borrowed a pair of God slippers
I borrowed a pair of God slippers
Did a few miracles
I borrowed a pair of God slippers
Made 'em believe, I did a few miracles
I borrowed a pair of God slippers
Walked on water in front of you niggas
I borrowed a pair of God slippers
