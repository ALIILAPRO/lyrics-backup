		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dad's in his car
Mom's in a dress
You spilled the tea on your Sunday best
She said "I love you"
But it's just not right
Now you turned 18 with a broken mind
You had to learn to lie to be honest
You had to learn to fly to get somewhere

Had to sit up straight
Hide your sin
'Cause they won't forgive you like the other kids
You said "Should I change who I am for this little town
Full of big old heads"
You had to learn to cry to feel something
You had to learn to fly to get somewhere

So take your neon shoes to the city
When the trumpet sounds at least you'll look pretty
You're going high, just fly, boy
Enjoy the ride, skyboy

You fell in love with a bitter guy
He broke you down and he took your smile
You got it wrong but you'll get it right
You got to trust yourself and hold your head up high

So take your neon shoes to the city
When the trumpet sounds at least you'll look pretty
You're going high, just fly, boy
Enjoy the ride, skyboy

Just fly
And if you can't find heaven
Just make your own paradise
Your happiness is worth the sacrifice
Just fly

So take your neon shoes to the city
And when the trumpet sounds at least you'll look pretty
You're going high, just fly, boy
Enjoy the ride, skyboy

So take your neon shoes to the city
