		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Damn I need a friend like me
Wish I knew the secret recipe
Of how to make a person that I need
Damn I really need a friend like me

One sided
Waiting for your call, it's silent
If I don't try then you’re not trying
It’s unrequited
Guess you meant way more to me

All the things I'd do
Mountains I would move
I got nothing back from you

Damn I need a friend like me
Wish I knew the secret recipe
Of how to make a person that I need		
A step one, two, three
First a half a cup of honesty, a quarter cup of kind
Add a tablespoon of all the things I couldn’t find
I need a friend like me
Damn I really need a friend like me

So over
Thinking we were ten times closer
But all you seem to do is shut me out
Why’d I let you let me down
Gave you all my energy

All the things I'd do
Mountains I would move
I got nothing back from you

Damn I need a friend like me
Wish I knew the secret recipe
Of how to make a person that I need				
A step one, two, three
First a half a cup of honesty, a quarter cup of kind
Add a tablespoon of all the things I couldn’t find
I need a friend like me
Damn I really need a friend like me, like me

Damn I need a friend like
Damn I need a friend like
Damn I need a friend like
I really need a friend like me
Damn I really need a friend like
Damn I really need a friend like
Damn I really need a friend like

Damn I need a friend like me
Wish I knew the secret recipe
Of how to make a person that I need				
I really need a friend like me
