		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Look (Great John on the beat, by the way)
Look

I done seen them niggas switch up for them pesos, huh
Hope my lawyer do his thing and get that case closed, huh
'Member days when I was wishin' like a shootin' star, huh
Or them days I was just wishin' like a shootin' star, huh

Told my young niggas, "Put in work" (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Keep your head up even when it hurt (yeah, yeah)
'Member I was dirty, I'ma take the money with me to the dirt (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Know I'm still totin' on sticks, fuck around and get clicked
Know that shit was goin' on (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Speak my pain all on my songs
Couldn't do right, now I'm a favorite, I can't do 'em wrong, look
Stayed the same, never switch roles, nigga
Said that I did it, start it, I finish, look
Stack it then I spend it, diamonds floodin' Audemar baguettes, huh
Niggas wanna be us, I just spent a check
Stack it then I spend it, diamonds floodin' Audemar baguettes
Look how niggas wanna be us

Look
I done seen them niggas switch up for them pesos (switch on me like)
Hope my lawyer do his thing and get that case closed, huh (get my case for me like)
'Member days when I was wishin' like a shootin' star, huh (wishin', wishin', wishin')
Or them days I was just wishin' like a shootin' star, huh (wishin', wishin')

Told my young niggas, "Put in work"
This how he 'posed to live, huh
This how he 'posed to feel, huh
'Member days watching', huh, huh
Now I'm on posters, kid
Look, I done came up with a plan, my nigga
We did it, no handouts
Never sat around doin' nothin', nigga
Reason why I'm a standout
Wait, you gotta, wait 
Stay out my way
Or we gon' spray, so tell 'em
Look, never stop at no red lights, see them Jake lights comin'
Look, never bark if you won't bite, hit you back if you frontin'
