		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When the days are cold and the cards all fold
And the saints we see are all made of gold
When your dreams all fail and the ones we hail
Are the worst of all and the blood run stale

I wanna hide the truth, I wanna shelter you
But with the beast inside there's nowhere we can hide
No matter what we breed we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come

When you feel my heat look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close, it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide

(It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide)
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
(It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide)
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide

At the curtain's call, it's the last of all
When the lights fade out all the sinners crawl
So they dug your grave and the masquerade
Will come calling out at the mess you've made

Don't wanna let you down but I am hellbound
Though this is all for you, don't wanna hide the truth
No matter what we breed we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come

When you feel my heat look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close, it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide

(It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide)
(It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide)
(It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide)
(It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide)
