		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is the wrath of Aquarius
I am the black metal terrorist, ain't no comparison
Humanitarian, bitch I'm a veteran
Better than anyone comprehend
Snake in the grass, Cut the copperhead
Hollow-tips point at a copper head
Drop a head Popping the Glock 'til the copper dead
But Bishop killed Radames
That is the biggest hypocrisy
I don't see nobody stopping me
Boy, your whole life is a mockery
A militant mind of the million
Civilian, I am the realest, bitch
No Gilligan put me on an island
Smoking on an island 'til a nigga look Thailand
Tread through your crew like a motherfucking virus
Cloud 9 Confederate, breaking up barriers
Federation in your area
If I'm a bitch then I guess you a pussy
And pussies are scared of a terrier (woof)
Run all your paper
Killer Curry keep on catching the caper
Dominating common denominator
Aftermath you can just do the math later, as a teenager
I was an underdog under the Raiders, valuable player
Young Bo Jackson slammin' packs with a passion
Satisfaction with the lack of compassion
It's a maverick hella gaspin', but actually
I am that nigga entirely
The same ones that inspire me 
Be the same ones that wanna retire me, nigga

In the night time, keep me out of sight, it's the poltergeist
When I'm ghost, I'ma cut the line, now you outta mind
Y'all niggas ain't U.L.T (ultimate)
Y'all niggas ain't U.L.T (ultimate)
Y'all niggas ain't U.L.T (ultimate)
Y'all niggas ain't U.L.T (ultimate)
In the night time, keep me out of sight, it's the poltergeist
When I'm ghost, I'ma cut the line, now you outta mind
Y'all niggas ain't U.L.T (ultimate)
Y'all niggas ain't U.L.T (ultimate)
Y'all niggas ain't U.L.T (ultimate)
Y'all niggas ain't U.L.T (ultimate)

Mystical miracle, I build imperial
I'm analytical, why Lotto had to be
Off to the clinical, now we're identical
Black individual, no biochemical
Serve, fuck the cops they the opposition
And these halfway niggas and these halfway hoes
Wanna be buddy-buddy they see you at a show
But be the main ones that be hating on the low
Wait, that's just irrelevant
They got the fact when you look at my melanin, woah
Cops killin' niggas, niggas killin' brothas, niggas hate each other
Don't know, where the fuck they came from
We the ones that paid dues
I don't watch Fox News, don't mean that all my foxes sly
Find a little white girl, but let you die
Gun like a veteran, breakin' off barriers
They just might call me a terrorist
Better get caught with it than without it
If I keep it concealed when I carry it
I put them on paper, send them to prison and give them free labor
Separate everyone, make sure they neighbors
Aftermath, after that, we can laugh later
Fuck all my haters
I raise up black fists as black as the Raiders
Arming the Gators
Federation is my organization
All relation, no religion, no races
Black to Asian we the nation of U.L.T.
True to you so keep it true to me
Haters cannot put an end to me 
Because I truly know who is my enemy, nigga

In the night time, keep me out of sight, it's the poltergeist
When I'm ghost, I'ma cut the line, now you outta mind
Y'all niggas ain't U.L.T (ultimate)
Y'all niggas ain't U.L.T (ultimate)
Y'all niggas ain't U.L.T (ultimate)
Y'all niggas ain't U.L.T (ultimate)
In the night time, keep me out of sight, it's the poltergeist
When I'm ghost, I'ma cut the line, now you outta mind
Y'all niggas ain't U.L.T (ultimate)
Y'all niggas ain't U.L.T (ultimate)
Y'all niggas ain't U.L.T (ultimate)
Y'all niggas ain't U.L.T (ultimate)
