		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh

Don't say we're better off dead
Soon we could be in remission
I said, "It's not enough"
They told me, "It'll be fine
Happiness isn't a crime son
So pick your guts from the floor"

We'll all be hanging a hero
Praying for someone to save us
Goliath says I oughta let it go

Nobody's proving me wrong
They're all singing hallelujah
Keep two eyes open
'Cause jackals live by the candlelight

We've got a mountain to climb
But I ain't got the permission
They wanna call my bluff
They said, "You're crossing the line"
I said, "It takes one to know one"

Oh, please God be merciful
'Cause they know not what they do
We should be begging for more
We'll all be hanging a hero
Praying for someone to save us
Goliath says I oughta let it go

Nobody's proving me wrong
They're all singing hallelujah
Keep two eyes open
'Cause jackals live by the candlelight

Bury your head in the sand
Soon you'll be feeling the fangs
So sleep with two eyes open
'Cause jackals live by the candlelight

Long live the king that's not listening
No time for rats in the gutter
Snakes coiling but we're signaling
Screaming at one another

Long live the king that's not listening
No time for rats in the gutter
Snakes coiling but we're signaling
Screaming at one another

Smoke 'em out and set a fire in the hive
They wouldn't break their stride if we were burning alive
Burning alive

The jackals live by the candlelight
They live by the candlelight
Nobody's proving me wrong
They're all singing hallelujah
Keep two eyes open
'Cause jackals live by the candlelight
Bury your head in the sand
Soon you'll be feeling the fangs
So sleep with two eyes open
'Cause jackals live by the candlelight
