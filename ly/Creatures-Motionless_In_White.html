		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I fall
This is the end of you
This is the end of you
Whispers are their weakness

Their weakness
Everyday I must practice
To fake this smile on my face
It's all the rain that's putting me to sleep

It's all the rain that's putting me to sleep
I'll let the blood tell the truth tonight, this is my life's work
11 tracks is not enough, to tell you how I've died inside
And love is lost like words

11 tracks is not enough
In spiders eyes a man becomes a fly
In prolonged silence, we all stand defiled
We fall in line with the atrophy of life

The calm before the storm is a defeating silence
I've given my all, to this valley of despair
We are the damned, the cursed and the broken
There's so much more inside us

We are the lost, the sick and unspoken
There's so much more inside us
I'm drowning in an ocean of the tears that I've cried
I tried to drown my sorrows

Instead they're all drowning me
I tried to drown my sorrows
Instead they're all drowning me
