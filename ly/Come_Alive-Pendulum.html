		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Slave to a vision
Stranger from the outside
Eyes against your prism
Caught you in the headlights

Head against a wire
Helping me get closer
Set yourself on fire
And show me when it's over

'Cause I come alive when you're alone
You've got nothing to fear
Restless tides of your shadow
This time you'll know I'm here

Hail to the seeker
Waiting on the breakthrough
In for every hour
This is what it's come to

'Cause I come alive when you're alone
You've got nothing to fear
Restless tides of your shadow
This time you'll know I'm here

'Cause I come alive when you're alone
You've got nothing to fear
Restless tides of your shadow
This time you'll know I'm here
