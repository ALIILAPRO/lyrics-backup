		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yes, I am blind 
No, I can't see 
The good things 
Just the bad things, oh... 

Yes, I am blind 
No, I can't see 
There must be something 
Horribly wrong with me? 

God, come down 
If you're really there 
Well, you're the one who claims to care 

Love's young dream 
I'm the one who shopped you 
I'm the one who stopped you 
'Cause in my sorry way I love you 
Love's young dream 
Are you sorry 
For what you've done? 
Well, you're not the only one 
And in my sorry way I love you 

Yes, I am blind 
But I do see 
Evil people prosper 
Over the likes of you and me 
Always 

God, come down 
If you're really there 
Well, you're the one who claims to care 

Little lamb 
On a hill 
Run fast if you can 
Good Christians, they want to kill you 
And your life has not even begun ! 
You're just like me, you're just like me 
Oh, your life has not even begun !
You're just like me, you're just like me 
And your life has not even begun !
You're just like me, just like me 
And your life has not even begun !
You're just like me, you're just like, just like me
And your life has not even begun !
