		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You gave me love that I could never feel before
Took it away from me and smashed it on the floor
My heart was left behind with all that we could be
I'm trying to reassemble the pieces left of me 

Thought I found love
But I didn't and now you're gone

I don't wanna breath no more 
See no more 
Can't stand to watch you when you leave that door
Don't wanna taste the tears on my face again 
I don't wanna breathe no more 
Be no more
This is a love I couldn't feel before 
But you threw away 
All that we could have been
All that we could have been

All that we could have been
Yeah 

You tied my hands behind me
Brought me to my knees
I gave up happiness 
Just to see you pleased
But I have come to realize that love is but a war
I've given up no 
I won't fight no more

Thought I found love
But I didn't and now you're gone

I don't wanna breath no more 
See no more 
Can't stand to watch you when you leave that door
Don't wanna taste the tears on my face again
I don't wanna breathe no more 
Be no more
This is a love I couldn't feel before 
But you threw away 
All that we could have been
All that we could have been 

You don't show 
Any of your soul
Do you even have a soul
And you don't try
And I don't wanna live a lie 
To tell the truth the love I have for you 
Is slowly dying 

I don't wanna breath no more 
See no more 
Can't stand to watch you when you leave that door
Don't wanna taste the tears on my face again
I don't wanna breathe no more 
Be no more
This is a love I couldn't feel before 
But you threw away 
All that we could have been
All that we could have been
All that we could have been 
All that we could have been
