		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Love is a razor and I walked the line on that silver blade
Slept in the dust with his daughter
Her eyes red with the slaughter of innocence
And I will pray for her, I will call her name out loud
I would bleed for her, if I could only see her now
Living on a razor's edge, balancing on a ledge
Living on a razor's edge and balancing on a ledge, yeah
Balancing on a ledge and living on a razor's edge
Balancing on a ledge, you know, you know

The evil that men do lives on and on
The evil that men do lives on and on
The evil that men do lives on and on
The evil that men do lives on and on

Circle of fire, my baptism of joy, at an end it seems
The seventh lamb slain, the book of life opens before me
And I will pray for you, someday I may return
Don't you cry for me, beyond is where I learn

Living on a razor's edge, balancing on a ledge
Living on a razor's edge, you know, you know

The evil that men do lives on and on
The evil that men do lives on and on
The evil that men do lives on and on
The evil that men do lives on and on

Living on a razor's edge, balancing on a ledge
Living on a razor's edge, you know, you know

The evil that men do lives on and on
The evil that men do lives on and on
The evil that men do lives on and on
The evil that men do lives on and on
The evil, the evil, the evil that men do
The evil, the evil, the evil that men do
Bow down
