		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In a little while from now
If I'm not feeling any less sour
I promised myself to treat myself
And visit a nearby tower
And climbing to the top
To throw myself off
In an effort to make it clear to whoever
What's it like when you're shattered
Left standing in the lurch, at a church
At a church with people saying
My God that's tough, she stood him up
No point in us remaining
We may as well go home
As I did on my own
Alone again, naturally

To think that only yesterday
I was cheerful, bright and gay
Looking forward to, who wouldn't do
The role I was about to play
And as if to knock me down
Reality came around
And without so much as a mere touch
Cut me into little pieces
Leaving me to doubt
Talk about God and His mercy
Oh, if He really does exist
Why did He desert me?
In my hour of need
I truly am indeed
Alone again, naturally

Seems to me that there are more hearts
Broken in the world that can't be mended
Left unattended
What do we do?
What do we do?

Lookin' back over the years
Whatever else appears
I remember I cried when my father died
Never wishing to hide the tears
And at sixty-five years old
My mother, God rest her soul
Couldn't understand why the only man
She'd ever loved had been taken
Leaving her to start
With a heart so badly broken
Despite encouragement from me
No words were ever spoken (were ever spoken)
When she passed away (when she passed away)
I cried and cried all day (cried and cried all day)
Alone again, naturally
Alone again, naturally
