		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now you leave alone
Times change let it go
Higher all I know
cll came down but I'm lookin on

Fire burning cold
Night sky shinin on
I know I'm alone
Lost at sea but I'm lookin on

chhhhhh
But I don't really see it
Ooooooo
Lost at sea but I'm lookin on 

chhhhhh
But I don't really see it
Ooooooo
Lost at sea but I'm lookin on 

Shows done curtains close
Now I fly below
God knows where to go
Back to where i was before

Now I hit the road
Feel it in my bones
Quiet let me go
cll went back but I'm movin on

chhhhhh
But I don't really see it
Ooooooo
Lost at sea but I'm lookin on 

chhhhhh
But I don't really see it
Ooooooo
Lost at sea but I'm lookin on
