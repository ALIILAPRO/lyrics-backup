		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A cold and frosty morning there's not a lot to say
About the things caught in my mind
And as the day was dawning my plane flew away
With all the things caught in my mind
And I want to be there when you're
Coming down
And I want to be there when you hit the ground

So don't go away, say what you say
Say that you'll stay
Forever and a day in the time of my life
'Cause I need more time, yes, I need more time
Just to make things right

Damn my situation and the games I have to play
With all the things caught in my mind
Damn my education I can't find the words to say
With all the things caught in my mind
And I want to be there when you're
Coming down
And I want to be there when you hit the ground

So don't go away, say what you say
Say that you'll stay
Forever and a day in the time of my life
'Cause I need more time, yes, I need more time
Just to make things right

Me and you, what's going on?
All we seem to know is how to show
The feelings that are wrong

So don't go away, say what you say
Say that you'll stay
Forever and a day in the time of my life
'Cause I need more time, yes, I need more time
Just to make things right

And don't go away, say what you say
Say that you'll stay
Forever and a day in the time of my life
'Cause I need more time, yes, I need more time
Just to make things right
Yes, I need more time
Just to make things right
Yes, I need more time
Just to make things right
So don't go away
