		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, ayy
Yeah, ayy
Yeah, boyz
Yeah
Hol' up, hol' up

Hol' up, we dem boyz
Hol' up, we dem boyz
Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, we makin' noise
Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up

Hol' up, we dem boyz
Hol' up, we dem boyz
Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, we makin' noise
Hol' up, hol' up, we dem boyz

Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, pop a bottle
Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, if you suck and swallow
Smell that marijuana, they gon' follow
Throwin' money on her like she won the lotto
Pussy must be serious, hol' up
Scared of heights come face your fears, hol' up hol' up
Do it just like Nicki, gon' and bend it over
Say she never smoked, I turned her to a stoner
Young nigga but I'm ready
Oh, foreign girls call me sexy
And white girls gimme Becky
But first I gotta roll this joint, baby, hol' up, hol' up

Hol' up, we dem boyz
Hol' up, we dem boyz
Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, we makin' noise
Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up

Hol' up, we dem boyz
Hol' up, we dem boyz
Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, we makin' noise
Hol' up, hol' up, we dem boyz

(Oh my gosh, that was amazing)
Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, you drive me crazy
Number one, bitch, you can't replace me
Leave the club, these hoes be tryna chase me
You got a ass so fat let's make a baby
Damn, I'm smokin' weed in my Mercedes
Hol' up, these niggas broke, these niggas lazy
Man, they money slim, they actin' shady
I'm in my brand new car, who wanna race?
Ho, bitch, you ain't call my phone so why you showin' up?
I'm takin' them shots, all my niggas stay loaded up
Man, on the low all these hoes be actin' so material
Hol' up, man did you see her interior?

Hol' up, we dem boyz
Hol' up, we dem boyz
Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, we makin' noise
Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up

Hol' up, we dem boyz
Hol' up, we dem boyz
Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, we makin' noise
Hol' up, hol' up, we dem boyz
