		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What do you want from your miserable life
What do you see in a future so bright?
Get what you want, do what you can
You'll get no pussy if you're in a band

I always wanted the scream in the night
I always wanted the noise and the light

Standing on stage, the thrill never fades
The ultimate rage, raping and fighting
Maybe you'll shake, maybe you'll break
You'll never escape thunder and lightning

Life on the road isn't easy, my friend
You can't remember you can pretend
All of your dreams can really come true
All of your nightmares are waiting there too

I always wanted the dangerous life
I always wanted the outlaw delight

Standing on the stage, promises made
Under the blade, kicking and biting
Maybe you'll die, maybe you'll fly
Fire in the sky, thunder and lightning
Thunder and lightning

What do you think's gonna be your reward
Sixty-year watch or a kick in the balls?
Time is a wasting, you don't get it back
Move out and pull out and always attack

I never wanted to be nowhere else
I spent my whole life pleasing myself

I'm on the stage, out of the cage
Shouting out rage, slippin' and slidin'
Maybe you'll shiver, maybe you'll quiver
Quick on the trigger, thunder and lightning
Thunder and lightning
Thunder and lightning, thunder and lightning
