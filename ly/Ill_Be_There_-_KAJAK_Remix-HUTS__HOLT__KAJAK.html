		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's complicated
It always is
That's just the way it goes
Feels like the wait it is so long for this
I wonder if it shows

Head under water
Now I can breath
It never felt so good
'Cause I can feel it coming over me
I wouldn't stop it if I could

When love takes over (Yeah-ah-eah)
You know you can't deny
When love takes over (Yeah-ah-eah)
'Cause something's here tonight

When love takes over (Yeah-ah-eah)
You know you can't deny
When love takes over (Yeah-ah-eah)
'Cause something's here tonight

When love takes over

When love takes over (Yeah-ah-eah)
You know you can't deny
When love takes over (Yeah-ah-eah)
'Cause something's here tonight

Give me a reason
I gotta know
Do you feel it too?
Can't you see me here all over alone
And this time I blame you

Looking out for you to hold my hand
It feels like I could fall
Now love me right, like I know you can
We could lose it all

When love takes over (Yeah-ah-eah)
You know you can't deny
When love takes over (Yeah-ah-eah)
'Cause something's here tonight
When love takes over

Here tonight
Here tonight
When love takes over
Here tonight
Here tonight
When love takes over
When love takes over
You know you can't deny
When love takes over (Yeah-ah-eah)
'Cause something's here tonight
