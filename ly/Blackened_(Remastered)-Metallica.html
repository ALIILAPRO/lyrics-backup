		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Blackened is the end 
Winter it will send 
Throwing all you see 
Into obscurity 
Death of mother earth
Never a rebirth 
Evolution's end 
Never will it mend never 

Fire to begin whipping dance of the dead 
Blackened is the end 
To begin whipping dance of the dead 
Color our world blackened 

Blistering of earth 
Terminate its worth 
Deadly nicotine 
Kills what might have been 
Callous frigid chill 
Nothing left to kill 
Never seen before 
Breathing nevermore never 

Fire to begin whipping dance of the dead 
Blackened is the end 
To begin whipping dance of the dead 
Color our world blackened 

Blackened

Opposition, contradiction premonition compromise 
Agitation violation mutilation, planet dies 
Darkest color 
Blistered earth 
True death of life 
Termination, expiration, cancellation, human race 
Expectation, liberation, population, lay to waste 
See our mother put to death 
See our mother die 

Smoldering decay 
Take her breath away 
Millions of our years 
In minutes disappears 
Darkening in vain 
Decadence remains 
All is said and done 
Never is the sun never 

Fire to begin whipping dance of the dead 
Blackened is the end 
To begin whipping dance of the dead 
Fire is the outcome of hypocrisy 
Darkest potency 
In the exit of humanity
Color our world blackened
Blackened
