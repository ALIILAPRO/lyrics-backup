		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sudden Wall of sleep arrives
In my bed, I can't awaken
Faintly I can hear their cry
Novena for my soul
Death in life, boxed in a case
In my Sunday's best
Underground, one thousand pounds
Crushing down upon my chest

Family gazing over me
Mourning their goodbyes
Why can't I answer them??
This is all a lie!!
Lowered in a pit of fate
Lamentation of the end
Forget it all, it's over now
We'll never see him again

Padded prison, living tomb
Silent hell in which I wake!
Scream in fear, no one can hear
Minutes left my life's at stake

Scratch and pound, and kick in vain
Claustrophobic waves send me wild
Gasp thin air, realize the end is near
They buried me when I was alive!:

Cause of death was never confirmed
Did he really die?
Get permission from the state
To save his precious life

Force of pressure in my brain
Capillaries burst and drown my cries
Distant sounds of digging through the earth
Are they real, or wishful thinking lies?

Padded prison, living tomb
Silent hell in which I wake!
Scream in fear, no one can hear
Minutes left my life's at stake
Thank you Jesus, here they come
To save me from my final breath
Wretch in sorrow, disgusted they turn
From my horrified face of death
