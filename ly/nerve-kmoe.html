		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hit me where it hurts
You know it's impossible to feel
Sever every nerve
Maybe I'll forget if I'm still real
What did I deserve?
Nothing in my favor, sign the deal
Losing my own words
You act like you don't know me, I'm still here

Is this what you wanted?
Treating me like nothing
Leave me in the dirt and watch me as I'm hurting
Tell me that I really should move into the city
Where I'll be alone and I'll see her on my phone
It's just not the same and
I feel like I can't be myself when I'm around you
I know I get in my own head but I can't help it
Sometimes I feel like I might just be going crazy
I just wish I could tell you how I'm feeling lately

It's always the same
Yeah, It's always the same things
I'm rotting my brain with
And I wouldn't change it
Did you forget my name?
Or am I just a game?
All I wanted was to make it, even if I hate it
I tried, and I tried to be what you wanted
Thought I wasn't good enough
Hide my face while I cry and I cry
Maybe you're the reason I can't get to sleep at night

Is this what you wanted?
Treating me like nothing
Leave me in the dirt and watch me as I'm hurting
Tell me that I really should move into the city
Where I'll be alone and I'll see her on my phone
It's just not the same and
I feel like I can't be myself when I'm around you
I know I get in my own head but I can't help it
Sometimes I feel like I might just be going crazy
I just wish I could tell you how I'm feeling lately

Floating, sinking
Tell me what you're thinking
About, right now
I can hear you blinking
Is it too late to turn back now?
If my lungs give out, tell me

Is this what you wanted?
Treating me like nothing
Leave me in the dirt and watch me as I'm hurting
Tell me that I really should move into the city
Where I'll be alone and I'll see her on my phone
It's just not the same and
I feel like I can't be myself when I'm around you
I know I get in my own head but I can't help it
Sometimes I feel like I might just be going crazy
I just wish I could tell you how I'm feeling lately
