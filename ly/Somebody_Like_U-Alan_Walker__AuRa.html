		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Reflections in the mirror bathroom light
Both hands on the sink, I'm holdin' tight
Why are you still glued in my mind?
Silly little me can't win this fight

Even though I know that you are far gone
And instead of maybe moving on
I'm catchin' these feelings, holdin' on to the pieces
It's hittin' me hard now that I'm

Dancin' with somebody like you
Lose myself in every move
Oh, I hate the things you're makin' me do
Somebody like you
It hurts like hell
Searchin' for you in someone else
But I can't help myself, I do
Somebody like you

Lookin' for your Prius in the parkin' lot
I know it's not there, but it's all I got
Rain is pourin' down, drown in my thoughts
I guess you found yourself another spot

Even though I know that you are far gone
And instead of maybe moving on
I'm catchin' these feelings, holdin' on to the pieces
It's hittin' me hard now that I'm

Dancin' with somebody like you
Lose myself in every move
Oh, I hate the things you're makin' me do
Somebody like you
It hurts like hell
Searchin' for you in someone else
But I can't help myself, I do
Somebody like you

Somebody like you

(Hate the things you're makin' me do)
(Somebody like you)
