		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know that this was meant to be, but
Did you really have to leave, no
Did you really have to leave, no
You see me falling on my knees, yeah
Did you really have to leave, no
Did you really have to leave, no
But I don’t know if I miss you
But I know that I’m lost without your love
I just wanna be with you
I know I ruined my chances of finding love
Baby I, want you back in my arms
Baby I, know I lost all your love
Yeah
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Yeah
Oh, oh
Yeah
Know I lost all your love
Yeah
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Yeah
Oh, oh
Yeah
Know I lost all your love
Yeah
One day your here, the next you’re gone
I feel like I just loved you wrong
Did I love you wrong
Rip down the memories on the wall
We don’t need them anymore
You don’t need me anymore
But I don’t know if I miss you
But I know that I’m lost without your love
I just wanna be with you
I know I ruined my chances of finding love
Baby I, want you back in my arms
Baby I, know I lost all your love
Yeah
You don’t need me anymore
You don’t need me anymore
I feel like I just loved you wrong
Did I love you wrong
