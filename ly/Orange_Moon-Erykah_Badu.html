		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mmh, I'm an orange moon
I'm an orange moon
Reflecting the light of the sun

Ah, aah aah, ah, aah aah
Many nights he was alone
Many, many, many nights
His light was too bright so they turned away
And he stood alone 
Every night and every day
Then he turned to me 
He saw his reflection in me 
And he smiled at me, when he turned to me 
Then he said to me

How good it is, how good it is
How good it is, how good it is

Ah, aah aah, ah, aah aah
I'm an orange moon
I'm brighter than before
Brighter than ever before
I'm an orange moon and I shine so bright
'Cause I reflect the light of my sun, ooh
I praise the day, he turned my way 
And smiled at me
He, gets to smile and I get to be orange, da da da do dee

How good it is, how good it is
How good it is, how good it is
How good it is, how good it is
How good it is, how good it is

(Oh) shine so bright
(Oh) he ruled the day, I ruled the night (oh)
Shine, shine, shine (Oh)

How good it is, how good it is
How good it is, how good it is
How good it is, how good it is
How good he is, how God he is
How good it is, how good it is
How good it is, how God he is
How good it is, how good it is
How good he is, how God he is
How good it is, how good it is

I'm an orange moon 
I'm brighter than before, brighter
Uh mh, uh mhhm
Reflecting the light of the sun
Ooh
Smile at me
