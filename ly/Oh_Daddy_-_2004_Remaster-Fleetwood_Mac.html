		<p>
		  Oh Daddy
You know you make me cry
How can you love me
I don't understand why

Oh Daddy
If I can make you see
If there's been a fool around
It's got to be me
Yes, it's got to be me

Oh Daddy
You soothe me with your smile
You're letting me know
You're the best thing in my life

Oh Daddy
If I could make you see
If there's been a fool around
It's got to be me
Yes, it's got to me

Why are you right when I'm so wrong
I'm so weak but you're so strong
Everything you do is just alright
And I can't walk away from you
Baby, if I tried

Why are you right when I'm so wrong
I'm so weak but you're so strong
Everything you do is just alright
And I can't walk away from you
Baby, if I tried

Oh Daddy
You soothe me with your smile
You're letting me know
You're the best thing in my life

Oh Daddy
If I could make you see
If there's been a fool around
It's got to be me
Yes, it's got to me
Yes, it's got to me
Yes, it's got to me
