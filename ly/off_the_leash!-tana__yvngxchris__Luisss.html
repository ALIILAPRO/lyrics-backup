		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (I don't think I understand)
Mm-mm, yeah
Ayy, get out the way, yeah
Stop playin' with me and lil' Luis, man 
Just got off the five, hahaha
Stop with that shit, man
Nah, they ain't even knowin' 'bout the leash, man 
Get off that
Backwoods on the case
Backwood' smoke it to the face
I'm not one of these little boys 
I will really kill one of y'all niggas, man

I had to get off the leash
I had to block her and then go delete
Me and Luis used to sleep in the street
Smoke gas, go to sleep, and repeat
Hit her raw and then I don't clean the sheets
Hit her, kick her out, and then go to sleep
Wake up count some money, then brush my teeth
I had to get off the leash and then go
So many times I could've killed yo' bro
So many times I could have smoked his pack
So many times yo' girl was rubbin' my back
So many times I could've stole yo' pack
Called up lil' Maajins told him, "Send me a pack"
I kept it real 'cause I can't fold on my slatt
You kept it fake, I heard you told and you rat, gang

I got off the leash, told that boy to get lost
I got yo' bitch favorite song on TikTok
I'm in yo' house posted wit' a big Glock
I got a shooter, he lookin' like BabySantana 
He kinda little with some dreadlocks
Glock 19 wit' a beam at ya headtop
Pull out the AK-47, aim it at you, that's a dead opp
And I got that lil' nigga wonderin' 
Like, "What is this shit on my head?" It's a red dot
And I wouldn't go fuck on that bitch 
But I'm gettin' that throat 'cause that ho give the best top
I'm finna slide on that nigga three times wit' the K, think I'm in the Klan
Bitch, I got a Glock 9, make him rewind, got a fuckboy pissin' his pants
If you tryna fuck, damn, you outta luck 
Had to tell that bitch she ain't got a chance
Slide into yo' hood, nigga, like, "What's good?" 
What's up in this wood? Nigga, that's yo' mans
What's up in this wood? Nigga, that's yo' brother
Damn, I got a cutter
You know my Glock got a dick, yo' Glock got a dick 
No Lil Nas X, they fuckin' each other
And I'm not finna cap, I'm not with the funds 
Let's put down the guns, let's see who is tougher
And I'm not finna cap, ya mom is a slut 
Might pop out the cut and fuck on ya mother
And I'm not finna cap, when I hit from the back 
That shit was a act, I'm yvngxchris Tucker
And I'm not finna cap, post up in the trap 
Bitch, I got the strap but yvngxchris tuck her (What?)
You get it? (Nah) 
But my nigga, that shit was simple (okay)
I heard that lil' nigga got class, in a second 
I might give him early dismissal (okay)
And I really be lovin' my damn AK 
But I might hit his ass with the pistol (okay)
And I might go hit him with the TEC 
Like a ref when he blowin' the whistle (like okay, bitch)

Grrt-baow
I-I had to get off the leash (baow)
Money counter, that bitch beep 
Me and 'Tana ran twenty bands up in a week, yeah (baow)
Tana and Luis skrrt off in a Buick 
So we don't need Trackhawk Jeeps
Big body money, got a mill' like Meek
I-I heard your money was weak
Me and 'Tana up in New York gettin' breesh
Got a bad bitch, I think her name Elisse (Fah)
Yeah, I got the keys, I'm feelin' like Alicia
This not a rental bitch, this not a lease
I got the (baow) 
bitch go freak
Got a bad white girl like Miss Bo Peep
I had to get a choppa, NLE

I had to get off the-, uh
What? (I had to get off the-, uh)
I had to get off the leash (I had to get off the-, uh)
I had to get off the leash (I had to get off the-, uh)
I had to get off the leash (uh)
I had to get off the leash
I had to get off the leash (uh)
I had to get off the leash
I had to get off the leash
I had to get off the leash (Like what, Like what?)
I had to get off the leash
I had to get off the leash
I had to get off the leash 
I had to get off the leash (ya dig?)
I had to get off the leash (gang)
I had to get off the leash
I had to get off the leash
I had to get off the leash (Fifteenhunnid)

Oof
I am not one of these little boys, man
I will really kill one of y'all niggas, man 
stop playin' with me, man
I had to get off the leash (oof)
(Fifteenhunnid)
Skrrt
