		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sometimes I get a little too hurt
Got my mind going places it ain't wanna go
Sometimes I get a little too low
And I can't see myself through the fire and smoke

And you, like a neon light
Shining through a door that I can't keep closed
And you, like a rolling stone
Always building cities on the hearts that you broke

And in my head I did my very best
Saying goodbye, goodbye
And I don't miss you but I think of you
And don't know why
I still feel high
I still feel high

Sometimes I stay up all night
'Cause you don't ever talk to me in my dreams
And I think about eventually you're holding me
And dancing to the record like a movie scene

And in my head I did my very best
Saying goodbye, goodbye
And I don't miss you but I think of you
And don't know why
I still feel high
I still feel high

Whoa, whoa

Sometimes I get a little too hurt
Got my mind going places it ain't wanna go

And in my head I did my very best
Saying goodbye, goodbye
And I don't miss you but I think of you
And don't know why
I still feel high
I still feel high

Whoa, whoa
I still feel high
