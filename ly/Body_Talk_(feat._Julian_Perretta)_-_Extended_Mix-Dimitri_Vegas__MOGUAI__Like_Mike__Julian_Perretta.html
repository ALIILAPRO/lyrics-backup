		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everyone's a lonely lullaby
Looking for a voice to amplify
All the devil's dust and heat inside
To a stadium of alibis

And I, I want to feel you
And read between your lines
And I, can never heal you
But I promise I could try

Let me drink you heart drunk
Let me dream your eyes shut
Let me get your mind off
Let me make your body talk
Let me drink you heart drunk
Let me dream your eyes shut
Let me get your mind off
Let me make your body talk

I want to feel you
Let me make your body talk
I could never heal you
Let me make your body talk

I want to feel you
I could never heal you
Let me make your body talk

I've been watching you in marathons
Every episode cliff hanging on
'Cause you're a queen who's never crowned upon
And I count your fear is overdrawn

And I, I want to feel you
And read between your lines
And I, can never heal you
But I promise I could try

Let me drink you heart drunk
Let me dream your eyes shut
Let me get your mind off
Let me make your body talk
Let me drink you heart drunk
Let me dream your eyes shut
Let me get your mind off
Let me make your body talk

I want to feel you
Let me make your body talk
I could never heal you
Let me make your body talk

I want to feel you
I could never heal you
Let me make your body talk
