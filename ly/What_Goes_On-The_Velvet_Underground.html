		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What goes on in your mind?
I think that I am falling down
What goes on in your mind?
I think that I am upside down
Baby, be good, do what you should
You know it will work alright
Baby, be good, do what you should
You know it will be alright

I'm going up, and I'm going down
I'm going to fly from side to side
See the bells up in the sky
Somebody's cut their string in two
Baby, be good, do what you should
You know it will work alright
Baby, be good, do what you should
You know it will be alright

One minute born, one minute doomed
One minute up and one minute down
What goes on in your mind?
I think that I am falling down
Baby, be good, do what you should
You know it will work alright
Baby, be good, do what you should
You know it will be alright
