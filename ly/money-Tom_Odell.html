		  Make more, gotta make more
Gotta make more, gotta make more money
Gotta make more, gotta make more
Gotta make more, gotta make more money
Gotta make more, gotta make more
Gotta make more, gotta make more money
Gotta make more, gotta make more
Gotta make more, gotta make more money

Walk out the door
Thank the Lord for my Gucci and Dior
We're looking so great
We take, take, take
All we gotta do is

Take another picture of me
Take another picture of me
Take another hit and you'll see
That if you want it, you gotta mean 'cause
We're just kids climbing up trees
Just kids climbing up trees

Walk out the door
Thank the Lord, ain't no time for being poor
We're looking so great
We take, take, take
All we gotta do is

Make more, gotta make more
Gotta make more, gotta make more money
Gotta make more, gotta make more
Gotta make more, gotta make more money

Fuck them, it's all about me
Fuck them, it's all about me
Fuck them, it's all about me
Fuck them, it's all about me
Fuck them, it's all about me
I gotta buy my house, a family and

Walk out the door
Thank the Lord for my Gucci and Dior
We're looking so great
We take, take, take
All we gotta do is

Make more, gotta make more
Gotta make more, gotta make more money
Gotta make more, gotta make more
Gotta make more, gotta make more money

Gotta say it once again
(If you wanna be happy) you gotta make more money
Gonna say it once again
(If you wanna be happy) you gotta make more money
Feel it everywhere
If you wanna be happy you gotta make more money
Feel it everywhere
If you wanna be happy you gotta make more money, money, money

(If you wanna be happy) gotta make more money
(If you wanna be happy)
