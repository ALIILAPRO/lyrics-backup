		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tougher than a Teflon, all this dope I stepped on
Re-up get the rest gone, been that nigga
What else you want? (What you want?)
Power, powder, respect
I want that money and powder and power
Money and powder and power
Money and powder and power

The paper, the paper, paper, yeah, I gotta stack that
Them diamonds keep blinkin', blinkin', we might have to jack that
Now boy when that blicky-blicky come out, you get clapped fast
Draw down with a lil' jawn, I match you like Pat Pat
Come back when them cameras out, 'round your block, we kick that
Come back when your funeral in progress and hit that
Hit you back to back, your bitch-ass won't even hit back
Yeah we splashin' in fashion, nigga, you can check the drip
Catch you slippin', we slidin', you niggas on some different shit
We hit the licks, we with the shit, shh, when you get hit
Quiet down, no need for the talkin', the fuck is that about?

Tougher than a Teflon, all this dope I stepped on
Re-up get the rest gone, been that nigga
What else you want? (What you want?)
Power, powder, respect
I want that money and powder and power
Money and powder and power
Money and powder and power

Older niggas look up to me, you can tell I got rank
Federal time, just to survive they'll pass you a shank
I ain't vote, tell them "Free Larry" and tryna pardon his case
When you black and rich, they be slick and tryna target your race
Street niggas never 'lone, we in the streets and I win
Ridin' strikers inside the trenches, they be changin' the VIN
My brothers chasin' that high, got brothers life in the pen
Got lawyer fees for the fam, just to start I give 'em ten
Sticks and stones that won't break my bones where I'm from
If you tell, you can never come back home where I'm from
Windy City taught me a lot, I get it all where I'm from
Money, power, respect, I'm in the zone where I'm from, yeah, yeah

Tougher than a Teflon, all this dope I stepped on
Re-up get the rest gone, been that nigga
What else you want? (What you want?)
Power, powder, respect
I want that money and powder and power
Money and powder and power (money and powder and power)
Money and powder and power
