		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No need to question our connection
Let go of all the doubts in your mind

We've gotta keep moving in the same direction
And whether good or bad we can make this right

If you feel you're hurting
You should let me know
Let me know
We just keep on treading
On these four blinds

I've reached my threshold
And we can let go
Searching for that signal
So we can find love

Don't want to let us grow complacent
Can't feel like we're living on borrowed time

Sitting here our energy keeps on changing
We gotta fuse together until we galvanise

If you feel you're hurting
You should let me know
Let me know
We just keep on treading
On these fault lines

I've reached my threshold
And we can let go
Searching for that signal
So we can find love

And I'll give you every part of me
If we stick together we'll be free
And we'll keep on
Just keep on

I've reached my threshold
And we can let go
Searching for that signal
So we can find love

I've reached my threshold
And we can let go
Searching for that signal
So we can find love
