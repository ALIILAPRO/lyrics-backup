		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Will I learn till my fingers bleed?
Will it burn if I always leave behind
What I love so it can't say goodbye?
And will it hurt, the more that I put it off?
Is it fear that I've been running from
What I love
'cause I'm so scared to say goodbye?

When my eyes swell shut from the
Guilt I've brought upon myself
I'm full of shame
And when I start to rot underground
I'll know that I'm the only
One that I can blame

Blame blame, ooh
Blame
Well, I'm the only one that I can blame

Is there more to my broken strings?
I still fret over evеrything
And I give up before I makе the time to try
Oh, if I don't figure this out, am I stuck?
Gasping for air or am I out of luck?
I can't give a fuck
About fuckin' up anymore

When my eyes swell shut from the
Guilt I've brought upon myself
I'm full of shame
And when I start to rot underground
I'll know that I'm the only
One that I can blame

Blame blame, ooh
Blame
Well, I'm the only one that I can blame

When my eyes swell shut from the
Guilt I've brought upon myself
I'm full of shame
And when I start to rot underground
I'll know that I'm the only
One that I can blame

Blame blame, ooh
Blame
Well, I'm the only one that I can blame
