		<p>
		  I wouldn't know 
Where to start, if you 
Ever were to ask me 
If I ever came to see it 
So stand strong 
You're proposing to me 
A front seat to your parade 
To sit and feel 

Well it seems pointless to explain 
Just give it a stare 
If only you notice 
If only you dare 
I've got to stop, this obsession 
I've got to start, about my reason 
Let the film roll 
Without me 

I'm always waiting 
For what comes rare 
Knees break from bending 
Seeking a little love here and there 
But I don't blame you 
For the end 
The show that lets 
Me be myself for taking part 

But it seems pointless to explain 
Well just give it a stare 
If only you notice 
If only you dare 
I've got to stop, stop, this obsession 
I've got to start, start, about my reason 
And let the film roll 
Without me 

I've got to stop, stop, this obsession 
I've got to start, start, about my reason 
And let the film roll 
Without me
