		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And I got my feet up, drink tequila, I done made it, y'all
Bro'nem caught a drug case, he got keys like he Alicia, y'all
Why the ones you love'll tend to leave whenever you need 'em most?
Even though we ain't got no bond like we used to, at least I call
DA gave his ass charge, charge, charge, he beat 'em all
Tried to turn himself in when he got caught, but he couldn't see tomorrow
I got dark angels, better hope the alarm save you
I'm a devil wearing Palm Angels, gun hid under the car cable
Tryna get that reward, ain't you?
Sip lean, I pour maple
You my dawg, but you swore I hate you
Raw hoes, we give 'em facials
The ones that ran'll still run
We fell out and I still come
I feel all these tears runnin'
Make me wanna kill something, oh

Pass the water, rollin'
I pop all these drugs like I pop Ibuprofen
I carry my gun 'cause I cannot be loafin'
I miss all my dawgs, I'm sorry I told him

Why they think I'm lying? I carry my Glock inside my Tommies
Why they think I'm lying? When I'm off these drugs, I'm feeling zombie
Long way from designer, I used to be rocking Abercrombie
Muslim, the school ain't never serve me salami
'Cause I was the baddest nigga, used to run around in the grammar school
You turn your savage up and got a check, they gon' inherent you
You gave him a chance and he came back, how he gon' get mad at you?
And you damn near gotta go watch your back whenever they scared of you
Wash your hands with that bleach, wash off that gunpowder
Family never know what I'm doing unless my mama tell 'em
And I was standing in that rain with a Louis umbrella
Tell the truth, I'm not a goofy, but you got me jealous
Police come, I stash the drugs inside my Perry Ellis
I was sipping purple to the bone, I wasn't drinking yellow
And I used to like to sip alone 'cause I could drink it better
And I overslept for real, I wasn't skipping classes

Pass the water, rollin'
I pop all these drugs like I pop Ibuprofen
I carry my gun 'cause I cannot be loafin'
I miss all my dawgs, I'm sorry I told him
