		  You gotta lick it (you gotta lick it)
Before we kick it (before we kick it)
You gotta take that extra step so we can kick it (so we can kick)

You gotta lick it (you gotta lick it)
Before we kick it (before we kick it)
You gotta get it soft and wet so we can kick it (so we can kick)

You gotta lick it (you gotta lick it)
Before we kick it (before we kick it)
You gotta take that extra step so we can kick it (so we can kick)

Boom (ba dada dada)
Boom (ba dada dada)
Boom (ba dada dada)
Boom (ba dada dada)
Boom (ba dada dada)
Boom (ba dada dada)
Boom (ba dada dada)

Baby work it
I met a real cutie
He had a nice tight booty
He semed to be the frequent lover type

Let's cut right through the chase
Come on and get a taste
You've got to face it so that I can get high

You gotta lick it (you gotta lick it)
Before we kick it (before we kick it)
You gotta get it soft and wet so we can kick it (so we can kick)

You gotta lick it (you gotta lick it)
Before we kick it (before we kick it)
You gotta get it soft and wet so we can kick it (so we can kick)

Boom (ba dada dada)
Boom (ba dada dada)
Boom (ba dada dada)
Boom (ba dada dada)
Boom (ba dada dada)
Boom (ba dada dada)
Boom (ba dada dada)

Baby work it
My lips are sweet as candy
I need a man that's handy
Don't be a tease
Just give me what I like

I'm full of freakiness
So come and get with this
And make me purr (Alternate: And make it purr)
So we can do this right

You gotta lick it (you gotta lick it)
Before we kick it (before we kick it)
You gotta get it soft and wet so we can kick it (so we can kick)

You gotta lick it (you gotta lick it)
Before we kick it (before we kick it)
You gotta get it soft and wet so we can kick it (so we can kick)

Boom (ba dada dada)
Boom (ba dada dada)
Boom (ba dada dada)
Boom (ba dada dada)
Boom (ba dada dada)
Boom (ba dada dada)
Boom (ba dada dada)

Baby work it
You know men are dogs
So go bark up someone else's tree

Here boy!
Come and get it


You gotta lick it (you gotta lick it)
Before we kick it (before we kick it)
You gotta get it soft and wet so we can kick it (so we can kick)

You gotta lick it (you gotta lick it)
Before we kick it (before we kick it)
You gotta get it soft and wet so we can kick it (so we can kick)

You gotta lick it (you gotta lick it)
Before we kick it (before we kick it)
You gotta get it soft and wet so we can kick it (so we can kick)

You gotta lick it (you gotta lick it)
Before we kick it (before we kick it)
You gotta get it soft and wet so we can kick it (so we can kick)

Boom (ba dada dada)
Boom (ba dada dada)
Boom (ba dada dada)
Boom (ba dada dada)
Boom (ba dada dada)
Boom (ba dada dada)
Boom (ba dada dada)

Baby work it

You gotta lick it (you gotta lick it)
Before we kick it (before we kick it)
You gotta get it soft and wet so we can kick it (so we can kick)

You gotta lick it (you gotta lick it)
Before we kick it (before we kick it)
You gotta get it soft and wet so we can kick it (so we can kick)
