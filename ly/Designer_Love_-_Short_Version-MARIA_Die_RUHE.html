		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Cut and wounded
feelings under glass
I´m pretending
that my eyes are shut

no connection
only hidden hearts
Soul, where are you?
Am I all alone?

Broken dreams are
drifting under glass
I´m pretending
that my eyes are shut

no connection
only hidden hearts
Soul, where are you?
Am I all alone?

We´re gonna need the love we have
give it all - send it right
spread it out - it´s time
let it all out

We gonna need the love we have
give it all - send it right
spread it out - it´s time
its coming back - its coming

So Rest in these arms
for a while
its true & calm
choose the colours you like

i´ll draw a heart
in the sky
- I love you NOW -
if you ask why

We´re gonna need the love we have
give it all - send it right
spread it out - it´s time
let it all out

We gonna need the love we have
give it all - send it right
spread it out - it´s time
its coming back - its coming
