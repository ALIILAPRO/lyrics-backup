		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm just another back street kid
Rock 'n Roll music is the only thing I really dig
Can't stop the music going round inside my head
I'm a rock 'n roll soldier, gonna play it until I'm dead
Nobody I know is gonna take my rock 'n roll away from me

Sitting in the back seat of a shiny limousine
Living in a taxi can't remember where I've been
Playing my music, sitting in my hotel room
Writing about the stars and thinking about the hand of doom
Nobody I know is gonna take my rock 'n roll away from me

Living life comes easy if you know which way you're going
Got to see yourself in other's eye's, surprised?
Living like I want to don't come easy, but I'm trying
Sorting out what's true and what are lies, it's wise

Brought up in a back street living with the salt of the land
Seems that now my music's paying off my tax demands
So listen to the music, want to see you get so high
'Cause I'm a back street rocker and I will be till the day I die
Nobody I know is gonna take my rock 'n roll away from me
