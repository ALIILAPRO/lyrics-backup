		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I swear to tell the truth
The whole truth and nothing but
Yes
Hey
I am the maniac
I am the ghoul
I'm in the shadows in the corner of my room
This my new hideaway
This is my tomb
This is my coffin
This is my place for unruliness, no worries
I love the darkness yeah
I like to marry it
It is my cloak, it is my shield, it is my cape
I love the dark, maybe we can make it darker
Give me a marker

I am the maniac
I am the maniac
I am the maniac

I am the maniac, I am the fool
I found a monster in me when I lost my cool
It lives inside of me eating what's in its web
Put black spray paint on my windows during the day
Wanna spend time with it, I think I'm losing it
Or I found it and I'm using it
I wear my shades at night so I can look in the abyss
I see something in nothingness if you could picture this
Put black holes in my jar lid
I climb the wall, I'm too high and now I'd die from the fall
Before the waters to our knees
We can't climb on the tree's wash away
And you and I are the disease

I am the maniac
I am the maniac
I am the maniac

I am the mani-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-maniac (I am the maniac)
I think I'm losing it (I am the maniac)
I am the mani-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-maniac (I am the maniac)
I think I'm lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-sing it (I am the maniac)
