		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I miss the way that it was
You were the only one
The only one that really knew me
The only one that knew my heart
But now I'm just in the dark

I miss the
I miss the
I miss the way
I miss the way that it was

I miss the
I miss the
I miss the way
I miss the way that it was

I miss the way that it was
You were the only one
The only one that really knew me
The only one that knew my heart
But now I'm just in the dark

I miss the
I miss the
I miss the way
I miss the way that it was

I miss the
I miss the
I miss the way
I miss the way that it was

I miss the way that it was
You were the only one
The only one that really knew me
The only one that knew my heart
But now I'm just in the dark

I miss the way that it was
You were the only one
The only one that really knew me
The only one that knew my heart
But now I'm just in the dark

I miss the
I miss the
I miss the way
I miss the way that it was

I miss the
I miss the
I miss the way
I miss the way that it was

I miss the
I miss the
I miss the way
I miss the way that it was

I miss the way that it was
You were the only one
The only one that really knew me
The only one that knew my heart
But now I'm just in the dark
