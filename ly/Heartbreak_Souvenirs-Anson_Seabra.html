		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's a you-shaped hole in my day
There a you-shaped spot on my chest
Where you used to lay
There's an empty frame on my wall
And a number I know I can't call
What you left just reminds me you left
And I'm left with it all

I know time heals all wounds but it's taking too long
Just 'cause I watched you go doesn't mean that you're gone
'Cause all I have is

Heartbreak souvenirs
Saying you were here
I look around and I just
Wish they'd disappear
But you're everywhere
I'm here without you drowning
You stained my life surrounded by these
Heartbreak souvenirs
Saying you were here

There's a book that's still on my shelf
I know I told you I'd read it
What other lies am I telling myself
There's a crystal you left in my drawer
With the feelings I try to ignore
It's supposed to protect from the voice in my head
But I don't think it works anymore

I know time heals all wounds but it's taking too long
Just 'cause I watched you go doesn't mean that you're gone
'Cause all I have is

Heartbreak souvenirs
Saying you were here
I look around and I just
Wish they'd disappear
But you're everywhere
I'm here without you drowning
You stained my life surrounded by these
Heartbreak souvenirs
Saying you were here

Are you
Broken like me
Hopeless like me
Lonely like full moon nights I can't sleep
Haunting my dreams
Down on my knees
Beggin' please won't you help me let go of these

Heartbreak souvenirs
Saying you were here
I look around and I just
Wish they'd disappear
But you're everywhere
I'm here without you drowning
You stained my life surrounded by these
Heartbreak souvenirs
Saying you were here
