		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Vibe on this bitch, though
A lighter
Nah, in the room
Oh
Uh-huh

You work numbers, work wonders
You done woke me up from my eternal slumber
I'm the lightning, you're the thunder
There's a difference 'tween, "I need you," and, "I want you"
Girl, I need you
Good sex led to conversations getting a little deeper, uh
Tell me your darkest secrets, shit you wouldn't even tell Jesus, uh
My karma been tweaking so much, I don't even believe in karma
But you give me a reason to thank God for all these recent falls
Percocet 30, he ate, all them getting off
I done chilled out on the drugs since you've been involved
Suck it like it's law, fuck me like it's law
No protection on my heart, God damnit, I'm gon' hit it raw
Traumatized from my past, yeah, I keep a log
In my mind, in my head, where that shit belong
They say you after my bread, shit, I hope they wrong
You already ran up the bands, we could have a ball
Hit it from the back, humina, call a play, huddle up
This that good love in the bedroom
Fuck you in the Prada, poke her face like Lady Gaga
Ride it like a Mazda, zoom zoom zoom

I'm all, I'm really all in
In love with all your flaws and sins
Your scars are really gorgeous
Ain't that a weird way to give compliments?
I'm all I'm really all in
I fell in love with all your flaws and sins
Your scars are really gorgeous
I see light in all the darkness

Whoa
'Atta boy, I done turned to a man
Hot chills when my skin is on your skin
Hope that you know that if you ever try to end
You gon' catch a couple out the F&N
That mean Cupid ain't give you a headshot
So I ain't got no choice but to leave you with a headshot
Look at the way I make that fucking bed rock, uh
Where your ring finger at? I need wedlock
Got my sights on your ass, ooh, red dot
We some bats that made it out of Hell, ooh, red hot
Don't, ayy, go all night, bitch, don't stop
We ain't even gon' be finished 'til the sun's out

I'm all, I'm really all in
In love with all your flaws and sins
Your scars are really gorgeous
Ain't that a weird way of giving compliments?
I'm all, I'm really all in
In love with all your flaws and sins
Your scars are really gorgeous
That's my way of giving compliments
I'm all, I'm really all in
In love with all your flaws and sins
Your scars are really gorgeous
Ain't that a weird way to give compliments?
I'm all, I'm really all in
I fell in love with all your flaws and sins
Your scars are really gorgeous
I see light in all the darkness
