		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I just called to see how you're doing
Never mind, that's a lie
I've been going through it
I had a good thing but I blew it
It wasn't her fault and she knew it

Tell me, what kind of man am I supposed to be
When the lines the razor blade made are faded
Is there really any hope for me
If a simple conversation's complicated

I know everything I've ever done wrong
That kind of memory won't let me move on
Though there's bound to be some things that you ain't told me
I could never be ashamed of you homie

I wouldn't talk to a friend the way I talk to myself
(I'm turning my life to hell)
See the voice in my head really needs some help
(I figure I might as well)
 
Step inside this is my confession
I let resentment turn into a deep depression
I spend the next five lines asking bad questions
How could I hit rock bottom never learning a lesson
Do I deserve this hurting
If my body goes limp would I float to the surface
Or can I live in a world with no purpose
How could I change when I'm still the same person

I wouldn't talk to a friend the way I talk to myself
(I'm turning my life to hell)
See the voice in my head really needs some help
(I figure I might as well)

Stuck in a circle
Waiting to die
I won't find a way out
Looking inside
Don't I deserve
To make anything right
I won't find a way out
Looking inside

I wouldn't talk to a friend the way I talk to myself
(I'm turning my life to hell)
See the voice in my head really needs some help
(I figure I might as well)
