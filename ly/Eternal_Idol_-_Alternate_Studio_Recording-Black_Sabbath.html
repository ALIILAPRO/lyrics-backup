		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No one said it had to be this way
Why are we the victims of their final word

Dying world is killing us so slowly
I believe no god may save us now

Can't you see what I see
Sinners say your prayers tonight
Your judgment day is here
Child tomorrow will die, not even
Born jesus our questions
He never seems to hear
Dying for the answers may be
The price we pay, to find the
Key to our lives
Is there a heaven is there a hell
Who's this god, tell me there's
No god above, why
We chose what lord, deep
Within our souls
He's not one thing
We are his spirit
We could save this world
From destruction day
Can't you see what I see

You and I victims of their word
As the masters of power
Try to poison our world

Greed money taken over
Their souls, you're
Just mechanical brains
Politicians don't know
Just don't know
We can chance this world we
Live in, don't let it die
