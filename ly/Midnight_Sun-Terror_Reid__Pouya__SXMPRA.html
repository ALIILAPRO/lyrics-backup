		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If u gon try bitch make it hurt, make it rock
Reid be shootin up to tha top
Talk yo shit, make it hot
Tight my grip n light da block
Thoughtchu knew she was a thot
Tuck her in ima hit da spot
Dump it quick ill break da box
Pullin in an ima pick yo lock
Think ya face could use a sock
Come n peep dis rock I got
Bout that guap I got a lot
I been better than you thought
Got my problems take a shot
Still gon do it how I taught
Might just cop me a private yacht
Sink dat shit and burn up da dockz
Hoe

Bitch it's fuck everyone and then everything
I don't wanna play no games
Creepin up outta the dungeon I'm leavin em cut
With a mothafuckin razor blade
I'm
Thinkin bout what it means that I be
Comin out the mothafuckin eight six to the three
Young kid with a mic and a dream
We be malevolent fuck with the team
Fucked up with a bit of coke dust
And a switch blade tucked In the back of the bus
Lucked up got a bag of the bucks
Now a mothafucka really wanna tell me I'm up
Shits nuts run a muck
Comin round the back with a bat get struck
They be gettin mad too bad so what
Bitch I'm comin out the gutter mothafucka you suck

Came out the gutter with all of my brothers
The slums the cut the flood the blood I shed
I pledge my life but when will it end
The mic the hoes the endless flights
East to west
And over the seas
Enemies on they knees
Begging me please
Slide for the free but I kill for the fee
Baby bone roll solo in the midnight sun
The want way more flows but I might be done
I did ten years I don't wanna do no more
My brain is fried about to overload
I rode the slopes too long I overdosed
I gotta go somewhere to feel alive
Jump in that caddy
Chasing the moon
Chrome caskets
Tucked inside that tomb
Yuh
