		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, I'm one with the wolves in the wild

Lost where the wind blows
Where the lights are out, I'm hoping
For a thousand miracles
Heaven, shine a light down on me

Got nothing to prove
I'm done playing the fool
I only follow the moon
No star takes me down
'Cause I've been to the ground
I don't need saving

I'm becoming one with the wolves, I don't run from the fire
I'm one with the wolves in the wild
I'm becoming one with the wolves, I don't run from the fire
I'm one with the wolves in the wild

Yeah, I'm one with the wolves in the wild
Yeah, I'm one with the wolves in the wild

Walking 'round the city, nothing feels like home
The night is creeping and it's eating up my soul
Mama said that I should never run alone
But nothing can help, this feeling won't go

Got nothing to prove
I'm done playing the fool
I only follow the moon
No star takes me down
'Cause I've been to the ground
I don't need saving

I'm becoming one with the wolves, I don't run from the fire
I'm one with the wolves in the wild
I'm becoming one with the wolves, I don't run from the fire
I'm one with the wolves in the wild

I'm becoming one with the wolves
I don't-, one with the wolves
I don't-, one, one, one, one

Yeah, I'm one with the wolves in the wild
Yeah, I'm one with the wolves in the wild
Wild, wild
Yeah, I'm one with the wolves in the wild
Wild, wild
Yeah, I'm one with the wolves in the wild
