		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Remember the words you told me
"Love me 'til the day I die"
Surrender my everything
'Cause you made me believe you're mine
Yeah, you used to call me baby
Now you're calling me by name
Takes one to know one, yeah
You beat me at my own damn game

Pushing and pushing and I'm pulling away
Pulling away from you
I give and I give and I give and you take
Give and you take

Youngblood
Say you want me, say you want me out of your life
And I'm just a dead man walking tonight
Like you need it, yeah, you need it all of the time
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Lately our conversations
Sound like it's the last goodbye
One of us gets too drunk
And calls about a hundred times
So, who you been calling baby?
Nobody could take my place
When you're looking at those strangers
Hope to God you see my face

Pushing and pushing and pulling away
Pulling away from you
I give and I give and I give and you take
Give and you take
Pushing and pushing and pulling away
Pulling away from you
I give and I give and I give and you take

Youngblood
Say you want me, say you want me out of your life
And I'm just a dead man walking tonight
Like you need it, yeah, you need it all of the time
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Youngblood
So you want me, so you want me back in your life
And I'm just a dead man crawling tonight
Yes I need it, yeah, need it all of the time
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Pushing and pushing and pulling away
Pulling away from you
I give and I give and I give and you take
Give and you take
You're pushing and pushing and pulling away
Pulling away from you

You're running around (running away)
Running away
From you (from you)
From you

Youngblood
Say you want me, say you want me out of your life
And I'm just a dead man walking tonight
Like you need it, yeah, you need it all of the time
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Youngblood
So you want me, so you want me back in your life
And I'm just a dead man crawling tonight
Say I need it, yeah, I need it all of the time
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
