		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  For every time you hate yourself
For all the ways you gave yourself
When you can't look in the mirror, heart's ready to spill
I just wanna tell you that you're brilliant still

And the night, it calls again
You're a stranger in your skin
I wish you'd see yourself the way I do
You're my light, I wish you knew
So afraid you're not enough
Every day, another cut
You wouldn't love yourself, you wouldn't dare
Why's it hurt so much to care?

Now it's Friday, you got your best on
But you're still lookin' for a reason to stay home
TV on
All your courage gone

For every time you hate yourself
For all the ways you gave yourself
When you can't look in the mirror, heart's ready to spill
I just wanna tell you that you're brilliant still
For all the teardrops in your hands
For every time you wanted to dance
When you can't look in the mirror, heart's ready to spill
I just wanna tell you that you're brilliant still

Every insecurity
Let me chase them out your dreams
You keep me steady like some kind of pill
I'll do the same for you, I will

On a Friday, when all your fire's gone
And you're lookin' for a reason to give up
Hold on
'Cause you're not the only one

For every time you hate yourself
For all the ways you gave yourself
When you can't look in the mirror, heart's ready to spill
I just wanna tell you that you're brilliant still
For all the teardrops in your hands
For every time you wanted to dance
When you can't look in the mirror, heart's ready to spill
I just wanna tell you that you're brilliant still

You are
You are
You are
Yeah, you are

For every time you hate yourself
For all the ways you gave yourself
When you can't look in the mirror, heart's ready to spill
I just wanna tell you that you're brilliant still
For all the teardrops in your hands
For every time you wanted to dance
When you can't look in the mirror, heart's ready to spill
I just wanna tell you that you're brilliant still

For every time you hate yourself
For all the ways you gave yourself
When you can't look in the mirror, heart's ready to spill
I just wanna tell you that you're brilliant still
