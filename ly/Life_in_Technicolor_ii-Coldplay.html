		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's a wild wind blowing
Down the corner of my street
Every night there the headlights are glowing
There's a cold war coming
On the radio I heard
Baby, it's a violent world

Oh, love, don't let me go
Won't you take me where the street lights glow
I can hear it coming
I can hear the silent sound
Now my feet won't touch the ground

Time came a-creeping
Oh and time's a loaded gun
(Every road is a ray of light)
It goes on
Time only can lead you on, still it's
Such a beautiful night

Oh, love, don't let me go
Won't you take me where the street lights glow
I can hear it coming
Like a serenade of sound
Now my feet won't touch the ground

Gravity, release me
And don't ever hold me down
Now my feet won't touch the ground
