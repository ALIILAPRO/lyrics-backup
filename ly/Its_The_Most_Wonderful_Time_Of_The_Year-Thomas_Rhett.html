		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Merry Chsitmas, y'all)
(It's the most wonderful time of the year)
(You know it is, here we go)

It's the most wonderful time of the year
With the kids jingle belling
And everyone telling you "be of good cheer"
It's the most wonderful time of the year

It's the hap-happiest season of all
With those holiday greetings
And gay happy meetings when friends come to call
Oh, it's the hap-happiest season of all

There'll be parties for hosting
Marshmallows for toasting
And caroling out in the snow
There'll be scary ghost stories
And tales of the glories
Of Christmases long, long ago

Oh, it's the most wonderful time of the year
There'll be much mistletoeing
And hearts will be glowing when loved ones are near
Oh, it's the most wonderful time of the year
(Yes, it is)

(Throw a bunch of mistletoe in)

Oh, there'll be parties for hosting
Marshmallows for toasting
And caroling out in the snow
There'll be scary ghost stories
And tales of the glories
Of Christmases long, long ago

Oh, it's the most (hey)
Oh, it's the most wonderful time of the year
There'll be much mistletoeing
And hearts will be glowing when loved ones are near
Oh, it's the most wonderful time
It's the most wonderful time
It's the most wonderful time (wonderful time)
Time of the year
Wonderful time of the year (wonderful, Wonderful)
(Wonderful time of the year) mm
Woo
