		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Reach one, teach one (style)
Can sell you to the water, how ya eat, son? (Yeah)
We docking in the low tide (huh)
So strap up, my nigga, it's time to rhyme (go)

Go in like scuffed Timbs, nigga, this above the rim (uh-huh)
When Birdy whip the blade out, nigga, time to fade out (yeah)
Mr. Playground, get down to lay down (yeah)
Nigga better stay down, greyhound my playground (go)
Got a Mexican homie named Chinese Mike (Mike)
And an all black Cutty and he got that white (white)
If you ain't got that green then he might see red (oh, yeah)
Put a knot on your head then we might see dreads (doot, doot, doot, doot)
Straight hair white ho with them pinky toes
Eating on noodles like Piscopo (yeah)
You ain't talk to my lawyer then I don't know (nah)
If you ain't watering the seeds then how we grow? (Go)

(Man, these motherfuckers different)
Reach one, teach one (yeah)
Can sell you to the water, how ya eat, son?
Docking in the low tide (yeah)
Shut the fuck up, it's time to ride (go)

Jumping in like Greg Louganis
Scraped his head against a diving board (style)
A cyborg with vocal chords, deeper than an ocean floor (style)
None are weak rappers ain't eating like me (nah)
So if you pass the toll then you gotta pay your fee
Got your tickets for that murder show, RSVP (uh-huh)
Got problems at the door, then ask for me (uh-huh)
Got problems where Parker didn't ask for T (yeah)
Got a problem with voting, you a absentee (style)
This that Black Lives Matter, still sniff cocaine (style)
Paid for a therapist but I still ain't change (style)
This that Black Lives Matter, still sniff cocaine (style)
Paid for a therapist but I still ain't change (go, whoa)

Reach one, teach one
Can sell you to the water, how ya eat, son? (Yeah)
We docking in the low tide (huh)
So strap up my nigga, it's time to ride

(No) no, God
No, God, please no, no, no, no
