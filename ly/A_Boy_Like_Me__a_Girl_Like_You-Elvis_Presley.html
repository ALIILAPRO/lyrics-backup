		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When a boy like me meets a girl like you
Then I must believe wishes come true
I just look at you and I touch your hand
And this ordinary world becomes a wonderland

There are many girls I have met before
But I pass them by because I knew
There would be this magic moment,
One to last a lifetime through
When a boy like me meets a girl like you

When a boy like me meets a girl like you
