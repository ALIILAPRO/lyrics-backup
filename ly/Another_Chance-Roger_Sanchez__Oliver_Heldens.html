		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I had another chance tonight
I'd try to tell you that the things
We had were right [Repeat: x 2]

If I had another chance tonight [Repeat: x 2]

If I had another chance tonight
I'd try to tell you that the things
We had were right [Repeat: x 2]

If I had another chance tonight
I'd try to tell you that the things
We had were right [Repeat: x 2]

If I had another chance tonight [Repeat: x 4]

If I had another chance tonight
I'd try to tell you that the things
We had were right [Repeat: x 2]

If I had another chance tonight
I'd try to tell you that the things
We had were right [Repeat: x 2]

If I had another chance tonight [Repeat: x 4]
