		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sometimes the forest gives me the realized
You have to be strong
Would you think unreal? No
The whole world will be yours, yeah

Feel, take a deep breath
Listen to their voices
They believe in you
You feel what you feel and
Your feelings are real, right

Even if you're worried
Don't be afraid
I can sense you there
Death always touched you and you kept going
Then show yourself, your turn
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Hear the sound of victory?
You're the master of this land
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Are you hear the sound of pain? yeah
You're the master of this
Then show yourself now
Then show yourself now
Then show yourself now
Then show yourself now, now
Then show yourself now
Then show yourself now
Then show yourself now
Into something new

Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (oh-oh-oh)
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (oh)
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Then show yourself now
Then show yourself now
Then show yourself now
Then show yourself now, now (oh)
Then show yourself now
Then show yourself now
Then show yourself now
Into something new

Sometimes the forest gives me the realized
You have to be strong
Would you think unreal? No
The whole world will be yours, yeah

Feel, take a deep breath
Listen to their voices
They believe in you
You feel what you feel and 
Your feelings are real, right, right
