		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Too much confusion
With living today
Paint an illusion
In my disarray
Falling on dark times
Oh, when will it end?
Too much confusion
Again and again

World on fire, scream and shout
In a cage, I can't get out
On my knees, no mercy can be found (found)
Memories go up in flames
Shovel dirt upon my name
See my future circle in the drain (the drain)

Gone are the yesterdays
Tomorrow's getting cold
And you can't turn back now
Trapped in the words you say
True stories never told
There's no escape from now

(Oh, yeah)
Storm is raging in my head
Everybody wants me dead
Are you my enemy? Are you my friend? (My friend)
Destruction never leads to change
Waiting for the end in vain
Hear them laughing as they go insane (insane)

Gone are the yesterdays
Tomorrow's getting cold
And you can't turn back now
Trapped in the words you say
True stories never told
There's no escape from now

(Somebody stop me)
I'm coming to find you
I'm crawling out of my grave
And everywhere you run and hide, you're gonna see my face
I'm coming to get you, I'm gonna ruin your day
And every time you pray to god, you're gonna hear my name
Oh, yeah

Your tears will turn to blood
The battle's won, but the war ain't over
You're drowning in the mud
Reach for the sun
But I'll pull you under, yeah, yeah
Pull you under, yeah, yeah

Still in confusion
With no end in sight
Inside the illusion
Nothing feels right
Living in dark times
This message I send
Too much confusion
Will it ever end?
