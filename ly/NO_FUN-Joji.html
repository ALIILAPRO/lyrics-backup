		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, all my friends no fun
Yeah, all my friends no fun

Fuck my friends, they're gone
They all left one by one
And now that summer's done, they don't need no more fun
Ya, I drive around on my own
I'm rich, but my AC broke
Don't check no mail, no phone
And I tell them I'm not home

And I keep to myself
Fuck with no one else
And I know it's my fault but I don't care
And I keep to myself
Who are you to pretend?
And I know it's my fault
It will never end

Yeah, all my friends no fun
Yeah, all my friends no fun
I drive around on my own
Yeah, all my friends no fun
Yeah, all my friends no fun
Yeah, all my friends no fun
All they do is nothin'
Yeah, all my friends no-
(No fun, no fun
No fun, no fun)

Ya, I can't get no sleep
I look so good in green
I run, I run, I run (I run, I run)
And I don't have no more dreams (ask me please)
I drive around on my own
I feel dead, but I feel my bones (my bones)
I hide out on my throne (my throne)
Open up, now my cover's blown
Yeah, now my covers blown
Yeah, now my covers blown
Oh, now my covers blown
Oh, now my covers

Yeah, all my friends no fun
Yeah, all my friends no fun
I drive around on my own
Yeah, all my friends no fu-
Yeah, all my friends no fun
Yeah, all my friends no fun
I drive around on my own
Yeah, all my friends no fun
Yeah, all my friends no fun
Yeah, all my friends no fun
All they do is sung
Yeah, all my friends no-

No fun, no fun, no-
No fun, no fun
No fun, no fun
No fun, no fun
No fun, no fun
No fun, no fun
No fun, no fun
No fun, no fun
