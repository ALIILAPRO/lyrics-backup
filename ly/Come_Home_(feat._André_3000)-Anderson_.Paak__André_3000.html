		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ah, ah

Darling, I have to be moved from afar
The truth is the only thing worth holdin' onto anymore (Anymore)
Untie me, let me loose from the cord
I'm so gone, so far, I deserve more (More, I deserve more)

I'm beggin' you (I'm beggin' you)
I'm beggin' you, please come home
No one even begs anymore
I'm beggin' you (I'm beggin' you)
I'm beggin' you, please come home
No one even begs anymore

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ah, ah

Who should I rest blame upon when all of the signs are
Brightly drawn and point back to your open arms? (Point back to your open arms)
Back too soon, but I'm here for the last of support
No longer bound by a broken heart (Bound by a broken heart)

I'm beggin' you (I'm beggin' you)
I'm beggin' you, please come home
No one even begs anymore
I'm beggin' you (I'm beggin' you)
I'm beggin' you, please come home
No one even begs anymore

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ah, ah

Somewhere in a place over water
My love, my love
Home base, welcome to the Lord before I touch down

You're all I need, all of me on my knees
Normally harmony, bumblebee, hummingbird
I'm a nerd, study you
What are you, W-W-F? We fightin'
We might need counseling
Possibly more so me
Sounds to me frowns'll be grounds to leave
Hounds'll be lookin' for you before you drop a tear
Offer them, stop pretending that I ain't him
I ain't them, them some dumpling
I remember when you start dying them silver hairs
And start hiding from your age
I ask, "Why, how come?"
Amazing how time can run away from us
I'm no nun, you're no priest
But I promise, hun, you gon' see a phenomenon
From with me like it's Ramadan
I don't eat like it's Comic Con
I'm a freak for you (Yuh)
I'm begging now, pretty please with cherries on top
Hairy wet twat
Harriet Tubman, I don't give up
And if a duck tells you strut then strut
Then I'll hail you a car
But what man won't beg?
You know I'm nutmeg
I will show up on a little moped
With a little puppy, it'll be fluffy
You are untough and we can discuss it
You know I'm sufferin', I don't miss my friend
I don't like my fan bent up 'til they come well
That Illawong, sweet stuff
We stuck, Billabong
Leaks, that's minimum
We gon' get along
Peace and innercum
Jesus been along
T-i-m-e, um
Please, I'm feelin' dumb
Please, I'm feelin' dumb
Please, I'm feelin' dumb

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ah, ah
