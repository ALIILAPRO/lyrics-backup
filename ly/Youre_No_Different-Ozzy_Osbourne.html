		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How many times can you put me down
'Til in your heart you realize
If you choose to criticize
You choose your enemies?

Everything that I say and do
In your eyes is always wrong
Tell me where do I belong
In a sick society

You're no different to me
You're no different
No different to me

Look at yourself instead of looking at me
With accusation in your eyes
Do you want me crucified
For my profanity?

Concealing your crimes behind a
Grandeur of lies
Tell me, where do I begin?
If you think you're without sin
Be the first to cast the stone

You're no different to me, yeah
You're no different
No different to me
You're no different to me, yeah
You're no different
No different to me

Can't you see, can't you see?
You're no different to me
Won't you see, won't you see?
You're no different to me

Living my life in a way that I choose
You say I should apologize
Is that envy in your eyes
Reflecting jealousy?

Tell me the truth, and I'll admit to my guilt
If you'll try and understand
Is that blood that's on your hand
From your democracy?

You're no different to me, yeah
You're no different
No different to me
You're no different to me, yeah
You're no different
No different to me
