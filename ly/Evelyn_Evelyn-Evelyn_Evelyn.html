		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Evelyn, Evelyn,
Why do we bother to stay?
Why are you running away?
Don't you feel like severing?
Everything's just come together at last
It's broken, I don't want to play

We grew up closer than most
Closer than anything, closer than anything
Shared our bed and wore the same clothes
Talked about everything, spoke about so many things

What shall we wear tonight? What shall we eat today?
Can we go ice skating? But we just did that yesterday
Should we be firemen? Can we be astronauts?
What if they find us? They're not looking anyway

Fill my glass, let's drink a toast
This is our birthday, so why are we weeping?
At your side, I feel like a ghost
I wake up first, and I stare at you sleeping

What shall we wear tonight? What shall we eat today?
Do you think I should marry him? But we just met him yesterday
Should we be movie stars? Will we be millionaires?
I want to be famous They're watching us anyway

We grew up so very close
A parasite needs a host
I'm only trying to do what is best for us
Well, I never asked for this, I never wanted this
All that I want is some time to myself
Looking in your eyes, I'm coming home
Just get away from me, please just stop touching me
You're always trying to be somebody else
Now I realize I'm not alone
Well, you're only scared of me
But you never cared for me
Why don't you let me free?
'Cause you'd never dare to be
'Cause you never listen, you're always insisting
(I'm just/just stop) reminiscing,
I feel something missing
I just want (you here with me my privacy),
God (can't we just get along/won't you leave me alone)?
