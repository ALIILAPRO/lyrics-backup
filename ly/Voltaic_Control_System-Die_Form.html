		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Voltage controls movements
Head positions and submissions
Are you ready for manipulations?
Are you ready for automations?
Are you ready to loose control
Are you ready to loose control with me?

Voltage controls passions
Body actions and deviations
Are you ready for revolutions?
Are you ready for transgressions?
Are you ready to loose control
Are you ready to loose control with me?
Voltage controls judgements
Social reactions and divisions
Are you ready for manipulations?
Are you ready for automations?
Are you ready to loose control
Are you ready to loose control with me?

Voltage controls pulsions
Sexual pleasures and erections
Are you ready for revolutions?
Are you ready for transgressions?
Are you ready to loose control
Are you ready to loose control with me?
