		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, when we met
You thought that I could probably change
I warned you then, that baby, I don't seem insane
But I fuckin' am and I'm rocking a little gold chain
That ain't real gold, I told you that it's fucking fake
I spend my money elsewhere, on different things
That come in little plastic bags
And they disappear the same night
The same night

I ain't your average, normal dude
It sure ain't glamorous, I keep things loose
I ain't your average, punk rock loser
Yeah, I'm a savage, I'm really cool

I tried to warn ya, I'm loose

I tried to warn ya that I'm bad and I'm loose
I'm looser than a piece of low hanging fruit
And I don't go to parties where folks get dressed up
I go to the function just to fuck shit up
I warned you baby, that ain't juice in my cup
It's promethazine and a little 7 Up
I tried to warn ya that I'm bad and I'm loose
I'm looser than a piece of low hanging fruit

I ain't your average, normal dude
It sure ain't glamorous, but I keep things loose
I ain't your average, punk rock loser
Yeah, I'm a savage, I'm really cool

I'm loose
I said I'm loose, baby
Woo

I'm drenched in sweat
When I wake up, need to hang up my sheets
Pour up a beer and walk out with my shoes on my feet
And I don't need nobody tell me how to dress
I look in the mirror say "Man, you're the best"
And I'm sorry, honey, but I gotta confess
Don't give a fuck about you, I could really care less

I ain't your average, normal dude
It sure ain't glamorous, but I keep things loose
I ain't your average, punk rock loser
Yeah, I'm a savage, I'm really cool

I'm really cool
And most of all
I'm loose
