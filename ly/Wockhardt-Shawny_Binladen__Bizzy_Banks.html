		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah yeah
Droppin' the Wock' droppin' the Wock' in
The motherfuckin' Sprite, yeah
Yeah droppin' the Wock' in the Sprite
Droppin' the Wock' in the Sprite
Droppin' the Wock' in the Sprite
Yeah, uh, yeah

Droppin' the Wock' in the Sprite
Sippin on Wock' with no ice
Poppin' a Perc' for the night
Dick in her gut like a knife
Ten K off a swipe free 2, no kite
Strapped up, no dyke trap jump all night
Twin slide for a pint (yeah, uh)
Sneak in the back, kick door with the FN
Big Shawn Wick, man, I feel like a reverend
Bro caught a body and his hair
Had to dread 'em
He took your pole, lil' nigga, you let him
Headshot, head crack, nigga, don't bet 'em
He got the pounds, tell brody to get 'em
He spin his block, tell brody to dead 'em
Yeah (What?)
Sippin' on straight drop
Gotta grinch up 'til my
Motherfuckin' tape drop
Trappin' on 3, free Bo live

(Like, yea, uh)
Im in the hood and im still moving zaza
She wanna fuck but I just want the matta
Im gettin chicken like I work at Popeye's
(Yea, uh)
I just been trapping finessing these UEs
She wanna fuck but I know she a groupie
223 bullets it's lookin like Stewie'
I see a opp and im bussin a uey
Bad lil bitch and she go to a CUNY
Im hella fly i ain't never wear uni
(at all, like)
These niggas talking but they never outside
Wanna be famous we put you on Fox 5
Ya bitch a treesh better
Go through her archives (like, what)
Bitch im outside and im still moving sleazy
Twisting my fingers like M&MBeezly
Shot him on Tuesday he died on a weekend
(like, what)
I got some shootas that's still in the cut
That nigga pussy I know he gon' run
I got a stick and it came with a drum
(like, uh)
Tinted the Cartiers now i need a bust down
Lil thotiana I tell her to buss down
She tryna fuck and I said we can't fuck now
I took a yerkie then told her lets fuck now
Switch her position so she tryna suck now
I feel like Victor when he catch a touchdown
(Cha Cha)
