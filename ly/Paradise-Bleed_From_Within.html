		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Your paradise was never in the afterlife
Your paradise was mine

These floral words that meet decay
As open arms wither away
Against the breeze I am weightless
I felt you breathing but I couldn’t stop you fading
And now it haunts with a constant projection
This house of glass now casts no reflection
But I’m losing track of the days that pass
It comes at me from all directions

We all suffer the same
We all suffer the pain
Release me
I bathe in waves of absence
In a sea of misery
Are we led to the grave
Are we destined to fade
In sickness
Your paradise was mine

Lost in dreams of elysian
With nothing left to alleviate
Even in death, i feel your presence
Now imprinted in the fibres of my being
And now it haunts with a constant projection
In the stillness of a fading impression
Held in broken glass, nothing’s built to last
It comes at me from all directions

I’m broken, feeling worthless, breathe
Suffer, through this, absence, alone
Save me
