		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Born into this world of hatred

We are born free
From the restraints of this society
Helpless to what is instilled (yeah)
To all those who raise us, mold us and shape us
There is a time to separate from this

A reason why, a state of mind
There's a disconnection
A judgement made
Fueled by hate, it's your mistake
It's a choice you made
It's tearing us apart

Hate, hate by design
Is destroying our lives
Seek to find some understanding
Redefine your life

Consequence, effected
In a life that is rejected
Anger misplaced
A burden on our hearts
That's keeping us apart
No love, no understanding

What we design is hate inside
A misconception, a judgement made (a judgement made)
It's our mistake, what we create
When we lose compassion
It's tearing us apart

Hate, hate by design (hate by design)
Is destroying our lives
Seek to find (we'll seek to find) some understanding
Redefine your life

Redefine your understanding
Redefine your own life, go

Hate, hate by design (by design)
Is destroying our lives (our lives)
Seek to find some understanding
Redefine your life
