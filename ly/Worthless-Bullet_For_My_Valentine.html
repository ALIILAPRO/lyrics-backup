		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're worthless to me

Have you nothing to say
Can't you see what you doing to me
You keep breaking me down
But I won't let you get the better of me
I can't take anymore

Look
At
Me
Is this what you want
Look
At
Me
Am I what you need
One more word and I'm taking this over the way
I won't take anymore

You can't keep all your apologies
Those words are worthless to me
And I don't want to hear that you sorry
Your words mean nothing to me

Has this open your eyes
It was only a matter of time
I can't tell by the look on your face
On your face
Let you know, the devil's in turn
No one's fall but your own

Look
At
Me
Tell me what you see
Look
At
Me
Am I what you need
One more word and I'm taking this over the way
I won't take anymore

You can't keep all your apologies
Those words are worthless to me
And I don't want to hear that you sorry
Your words mean nothing to me

No I don't want to hear that you sorry
Your words are worthless to me

You can't keep all your apologies
Nothing to me

You can't keep all your apologies
Those words are worthless to me
And I don't want to hear that you sorry
Your words mean nothing to me

No I don't want to hear that you sorry
Your words mean nothing to me
And I don't want to hear that you sorry
Your words are worthless to me

They mean nothing
