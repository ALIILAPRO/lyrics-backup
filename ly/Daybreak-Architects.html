		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Navigation in nautical twilight
Separation from what we know is right
The Wind was taken us in the wring direction
It's about time we show some disaffection
Carry the weight of thousands of years
Turn the page
Lets make it all disappear
We've had enough of inhibited progression
Held back by cloack and dagger oppression

we're insulting our own intelligence
I won't listen without any evidence
I'll live my life in the name of no one
Bow your head 
Palm to palm
Worship here in this celebral cathedral
As day breaks,
The sunlight heals,
As day breaks,
The light reveals

Navigation in nautical twilight
Separation from what we know is right
It feels to me like this boat is sinking
Weighed down by rational thinking

It feels to me like this boat is sinking
Weighed down by rational thinking light begins to pierce the distance
Solar dawn relieve the friction

Blue hours quicken the pulse
Upon the upper edge, reality dawns
Light begins to pierce the distance
Solar dawn relieve the friction
Light begins to pierce the distance
Solar dawn relieve the friction
