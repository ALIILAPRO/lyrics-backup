		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fuck you talking 'bout?
Is you high cause you done lost a nigga?
I got bitches that'll turn you on just to off a nigga
Now fuck a whip, whip, fuck a Nae Nae, Nae Nae
I keep an AK, trying to fuck a Kardashian just like a Ray J
Damn, with Taylor Swift recording me in my new play date
Who's that? That's Kayne West in my basement
Now let me ask you something, why you mad at boy?
Man, I ain't mad at all, matter fact
I wrote this shit, focusing on the Adderall
Every time I'm with your girl, she treat me like a superstar
She be sucking harder than the bitches in the hookah bars
Okay, I clap chrome, hit him in his back bone
I'm that thrown, any given holiday
Halloween, mask on, get dragged on
The gas station pump section, match on
This gon' be a rough ride, very far from Drag-On
You ain't never earned respect, nigga, yous a nervous wreck
Choke you like a turtle neck, then pop you like a Percocet
You could never hurdle death, you guaranteed to die, nigga
Don't get out of line, nigga, this ain't just a rhyme, nigga

Fifty-percent of these motherfuckers ain't fucking with me
(They ain't fucking with me)
The other fifty-percent of these motherfuckers, put 'em under for free
(Put 'em under for free)
Money, I ain't playing, I'm just saying
I lay your pussy out, put 'em under the pavement
I ain't playing, what the fuck is you saying?
Official Pistol Gang, we ain't nothing to play with

My whole team a bunch of muhfucking apes
Gorilla put the lama to your muhfucking face
But I ain't tryna catch another muhfucking case
If you wanna make wine, you gotta crush a couple grapes
I know a couple Avalon, know a couple Piru
Got a couple shooters that's ensuring my survival
Y'all are writing novels, I'mma write a bible
Vinnie selling gas and it coming out the nozzle
And I don't want trouble, I'm just trying to hit a lick
And if it's really drama, money, hit me on the hip
They trying to give him twenty, cause they hit him with a brick
He stupid and he know it, so he getting what he get
I got 'em ducking bullets like he leaning off a Perc'
If you ain't getting fetty, what's the meaning of the work?
If it ain't the fifteenth, he fiending for the first
I hope you'll understand it ain't no grieving in the dirt
He merked

Fifty-percent of these motherfuckers ain't fucking with me
They ain't fucking with me
The other fifty-percent of these motherfuckers, put 'em under for free
Put 'em under for free
Money, I ain't playing, I'm just saying
I lay your pussy out, put 'em under the pavement
I ain't playing, what the fuck is you saying?
Official Pistol Gang, we ain't nothing to play with
