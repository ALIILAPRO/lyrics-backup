		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The world is not out to get us
But I might if we step outta line
I know no one ever taught yo' ass single file
Gettin' worked up
Y'all need work on a different style
I made whole swags, I don't brag none
(At all)

I went from the bay to LA like the rest
Jaded to the waves, I'ma cry if I'm next
I'ma slide with the nest
I'm outside with the guests
Yes I know I'm a freak i contribute
I like it just as much when she
Do that shit to herself though
I am deleting y'all off of my cell phone
The beasts that I feast on the most
I don't sell those
And they wishin and ponderin'
And they want me at their low
Can't respond to them
All you do is talk all day, Who you botherin'
If you knew it in the past
Know I conquered it

The world is not out to get us
But I might if we step outta line
I know no one ever taught yo' ass single file
Gettin' worked up
Y'all need work on a different style
I made whole swags, I don't brag none
(At all, At all)
I made whole swags, I don't brag none
(At all, At all)
