		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, let's do it
Yeah, (uh) uh, yeah
Niggas gave up on me (niggas gave up on me)
Watched them give up on me
Huh, ayy, look, uh

Them niggas gave up on me
Should've never gave up on me
A nigga made it, homie
And rewarded everybody who waited on me
I watched 'em switch (uh, switch)
And now 'bout to switch back (uh)
Life is a bitch (yeah)
I get you bitch smacked (bow)
Look, give me a break, Kit Kat (uh)
I know she want me to hit that
But I'm focused on a big bag
I'll let you fuck when I get back

Now I'm makin' bigger moves
I've been lied on, I've been ridiculed (uh)
Them niggas pitiful
They'll switch up on you for an interview (uh)
Yeah, they'll switch up on you for an interview (uh)
All in the front (uh), everywhere I go, I go with a gun
Every case I caught, I go on the run (bow)
Every folk I see gone go in the trunk
Every pic I take I'm holdin' a blunt
Every night I'm gon' go home when I want
I remember I was down in the dumps
I was feedin' niggas, givin' them lunch
Niggas forget (niggas forget)
But I remember (but I remember)
My bitch is pregnant, my mom's in the hospital dying
Damn, it was early December
I'm losin' my crib (oof), my life in a blender (uh)
I really said what I did and I did what I said
I was never one of these pretenders

Some niggas gave up on me
Should've never gave up on me
A nigga made it, homie
And rewarded everybody who waited on me
I watched 'em switch (uh, switch)
And now 'bout to switch back (uh)
Life is a bitch (yeah)
I get you bitch smacked (bow)
Look, give me a break, Kit Kat (uh)
I know she want me to hit that
But I'm focused on a big bag
I'll let you fuck when I get back

I gave them my life (I gave them my life)
I gave 'em all of me
I see you ballin', but how you gon' win against the winners?
Boy, you're playin' in the wrong team
Yeah, I let the doggies off the dog leash (uh)
Yeah, I let the doggies off the dog leash (uh)

Yeah
Don't let them niggas tell you, you can't do this shit, nigga
The key to this shit, nigga
Is to be the better version of the last you
Whether it was a pic, your drip, your video, your bitch, upgrade
Everybody think you're supposed to look at what's lit and then follow that
Don't follow that, nigga
Do it for the people who love you
The people that don't love you, they just don't love you yet
Uh
RIP Pop Smoke
We gon' take this shit to the top
The smoke will never clear, nigga
Grrt, bow
