		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Is it weird there?
I wanna swerve into the traffic
Is it weird there? (Is it weird there?)
All of the films that I like are tragic
Is it weird there? 
I pick up my phone and I wanna smash it
I'm always attracted to

All of these red flags and bad times
The truth hurts, give me white lies
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I don't want a life so ordinary, oh, no, no, no
Break the cycle, give me something scary, oh no
Everyday's like everyday's like everyday
I don't want a life so ordinary

No, no, no, no, no, no
I need unpredictable
No, no, no, no, no, no
Hear me screaming through these walls (screaming through these walls)
Everyday's like everyday's like everyday
I don't want a life so ordinary (ordinary)

I can't help that
Yeah, I'm a mess a little bit different
I can't help that (I can't help that)
When everyone talks, I don't wanna listen
I can't help it
I wanna hide, I wanna go missing
I'm always addicted to

All of these red flags and bad times
The truth hurts, give me white lies
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I don't want a life so ordinary, oh, no, no, no
Break the cycle, give me something scary, oh no
Everyday's like everyday's like everyday
I don't want a life so ordinary

No, no, no, no, no, no
I need unpredictable
No, no, no, no, no, no
Hear me screaming through these walls (screaming through these walls)
Everyday's like everyday's like everyday
I don't want a life so ordinary (ordinary)

Everyday's like, day's like everyday
Everyday's like, day's like everyday
Everyday's like, day's like everyday
Everyday's like, day's like

No, no, no, no, no, no
I need unpredictable
No, no, no, no, no, no
Hear me screaming through these walls (screaming through these walls)
Everyday's like everyday's like everyday
I don't want a life so ordinary (ordinary)

Everyday's like, day's like everyday
Everyday's like, day's like everyday
