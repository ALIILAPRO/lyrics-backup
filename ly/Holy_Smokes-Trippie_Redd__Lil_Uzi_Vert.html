		  Je t'aime Trippie Redd
(GOONTEX) yeah, yeah

Holy fuckin' smokes, I got my money up (cash)
Countin' all these bands, took me a while just to damn run it up
Multi millions, I fill a hunnid up
All this cash on me but I still can't buy love
Put the hunduns in the Chanel, got my racks up
Sit back, flip shit like a acrobat, nigga, get the stacks up
Got two accounts, still got millions in my backup (all this cash)
Some think this money still won't buy love (oh)

You can't fit my racks in an arena
White cup filled with purple stuff, it look like Frieza
Bro and them got hit with that subpoena
Better keep they mouth shut, or we gonna have to clean up
Throwin' money up like I'm nauseous
Baby girl, I'm exhausted
Baby, be cautious
Know the streets be talkin'
Every day, walk with a check and I'm motherfuckin' talkin'
Every day, making money every way, hang with them bosses

Holy fuckin' smokes, I got my money up (cash)
Countin' all these bands, took me a while just to damn run it up
Multi millions, I fill a hunnid up
All this cash on me but I still can't buy love
Put the hunduns in the Chanel, got my racks up
Sit back, flip shit like a acrobat, nigga, get the stacks up
Got two accounts, still got millions in my backup (all this cash)
Some think this money still won't buy love (oh)

All this damn dick fillin' her tummy up (yeah), yeah
I done fucked your bitch and her best friend in front of her
How the fuck you ain't never get your money up? (how?)
(How the fuck you ain't never get your money up?)
I just spent me a hunnid thousand, I treat it like it's twenty bucks (Lil Uzi)
I'm a Leo, now watch how I fuck the summer up (yeah, facts)
Your girl got my name tatted, she swear she won't get a cover up
If he want smoke with me, that's another blunt (yeah)
All different kinds, every girl fine, can't make my mind

Holy fuckin' smokes, I got my money up (yeah, cash)
Countin' all these bands, took me a while just to damn run it up (whoa)
Multi millions, I fill a hunnid up
All this cash on me but I still can't buy love
Put the hunduns in the Chanel, got my racks up (put the hunduns)
Sit back, flip shit like a acrobat, nigga, get the stacks up
Got two accounts, still got millions in my backup (yeah) (All this cash)
Some think this money still won't buy love (oh, it's Lil Uzi Vert)

Huh? What?
Yeah
Where am I?
14, 16
Huh?
Huh?
Really, where am I?
