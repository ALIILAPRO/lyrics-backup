		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got a man that's always late
Any time we have a date
But I love him
Yes I love him

I'm gonna walk up to his gate
See if we can't get this thing straight
'Cause I want him
And I'm gonna have him
Say is you is, or is you ain't my baby
The way you're acting lately, it makes me doubt
You is still my baby, baby
But it seems like my flame in your heart, done gone out

A man is a creature
That has always been strange
Just when you're sure of one
You'll find that he's gone and made a change

Is you is or is you ain't my baby
Well, maybe baby's found somebody new
Or is my baby still my baby true

Now is you is or is you ain't my baby
Maybe baby's found somebody new
Is my baby still my baby true
I guess my baby's found somebody new
And I'd better get right up and go out and find me somebody too
I said I'd go out and find me somebody too
