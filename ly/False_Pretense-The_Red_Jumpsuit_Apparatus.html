		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, it's time to let it go

The world's got a funny way of turning round on you
When a friend tries to stab you right in the face
Losing faith in everything I thought, I hoped and knew
Don't sweat it
Set a false pretense

Betray, you're not gonna be willing to change
Yeah, and it doesn't seem likely to fade
Betray, you're not gonna be willing to change
Ca-ca-ca-ca-cause you know

In sacrifice
False pretense, you'll hurt again
Stop pretending to deny
False pretense, you'll hurt again

All along you know you thought you got the best of me
You were wrong and I'm laughing right in your face
I cannot believe you claimed you were my family
Don't sweat it
Set a false pretense

Betray, you're not gonna be willing to change
Yeah, and it doesn't seem likely to fade
Betray, you're not gonna be willing to change
Ca-ca-ca-ca-cause you know

In sacrifice
False pretense, you'll hurt again
Stop pretending to deny
False pretense, you'll hurt again
Guitar

Oh, it's time to let it go

I can't seem to understand it
How you've turned out to be so cold
You tried but were caught red handed
Are you happy with your role?

It's funny to me how you've turned into such a joke

In sacrifice
False pretense, you'll hurt again
Stop pretending to deny
False pretense, you'll hurt again

So play the game until you run out
And play the game into my head
