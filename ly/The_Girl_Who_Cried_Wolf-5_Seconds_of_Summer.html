		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm not leaving

Every time you say to me it's over
You just wanna start again, it's just lies
The girl who cries wolf every day, ignored by gravity
But in the end, don't ask why

You say you wanna, but do you wanna run away
Your great escape oh yeah
Where're you going?
Always running back to me to call it quits again

So look at me in the eye
Is anyone there at all?
Is anyone there at all?
'Cause I'm not dreaming
So look at me in the eye
Is anyone there at all?
Is anyone there at all?
'Cause I'm not leaving
('Cause I'm not leaving)

Does it have to be this tragedy
This endless lost parade of castle
Other side of make-believe?
The truth is spelled out in your eyes
Why don't you just reach out and make it clear to me?
What are you telling me?

You say you wanna, but do you wanna run away
Your great escape, oh yeah
Where're you going?
Always running back to me to call it quits again

So look at me in the eye
Is anyone there at all?
Is anyone there at all
'Cause I'm not dreaming
So look at me in the eye
Is anyone there at all?
Is anyone there at all?
'Cause I'm not leaving
('Cause I'm not leaving)
('Cause I'm not leaving)

Is anyone there at all, is anyone there at all?
Is anyone, yeah, is anyone there at all?
Is anyone there at all is anyone there at all?
Is anyone there at all, 'cause I'm not dreaming
Is anyone there at all is anyone there at all?
Is anyone, yeah, is anyone there at all?

Look at me in the eye, is anyone there at all?
Is anyone there at all, I'm not dreaming
Look at me in the eye, is anyone there at all?
Is anyone there at all, 'cause I'm not leavin'
