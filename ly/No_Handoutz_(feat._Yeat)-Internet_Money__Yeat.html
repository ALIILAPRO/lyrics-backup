		  Hey, hey (yeah, uh)
Hey, hey, hey, hey (Rio)
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

Yeah, turn up (turn up, yeah, turn up, woah, turn up)
Yeah, all of my diamonds, they flawless, this not the shit that you heard of (capper)
Your bitch gon' jump on my dick, yeah, that bitch gon' pull up, do hurdles
Yeah, I told you that we be them boys that gon' win 
I don't really think that you heard us
How the fuck these hunduns on me? (Hey)
How the fuck I got GLE? (Skrrt)
Watch all my money times three (woah)
In the Maybach, recline in the seats (yeah, yeah)
Bitch 'bout to Uber, she eat (eat up)
I bust a nut, yeah, I skeet (yeah, skeet)
They don't really know 'bout a Yeat (no)
They ain't even heard of me (heard)

They tryna steal my swag, yeah, boy, that's a burglary
Yeah, I got bags sittin' on top of the bags, boy, that's a Virgil piece (Virgil)
Yeah, give my twizzy a hundun, got boy to murder for me (brrt)
Yeah, I'm on the side where we win, yeah, we don't really be keepin' no peace
Yeah, I was down bad in the past, I ain't get to have no feast (uh-uh)
Yeah, walk in the store with the pass, I'm 'bout to get it for free (ooh)
All of my diamonds, they bussin', they flooded
Goin' up straight to the top, no discussion
Twin finna smoke that boy just like a Russian (buh, buh, buh, buh)
Just scored a TD, these pussies been rushin'
Yeah, hey, hey, hey
I ain't even steppin' outside today (no way)
Yeah, I got a cross on my crotch, yeah, the Chrome Hearts, lil' waist
Yeah, I went and cut up the Tonka (I went and cut up the Tonka)
Yeah, these Percs got me moody and wonky
This bitch got an ass, this bitch got a donkey
It's a flawless team, I don't care 'bout accomplishments (yeah)
I was down bad, they ain't even have a dollar, I was really still poppin' shit
We the new wave, we the latest and greatest
Hit from the three every time like I'm Grady (bop)
Yeah, I got to make up my mind about shit but I told you that I'm a lil' petty
Yeah, my diamonds, they surf, they sled (sled)
Bitch pulled up, gave me her head (yeah, woo)
She ate me up in the bed
And I still left her ass on read (bye, bye)
They ain't gon' do what I said (they won't)
They ain't go bring in no bread (they ain't)
I ain't agree to shit (woo) 
I definitely ain't agreein' to that (go, go)

Yeah, turn up (turn up, yeah, turn up, woah, turn up)
Yeah, all of my diamonds, they flawless, this not the shit that you heard of (capper)
Your bitch gon' jump on my dick, yeah, that bitch gon' pull up, do hurdles
Yeah, I told you that we be them boys that gon' win 
I don't really think that you heard us
How the fuck these hunduns on me? (Hey)
How the fuck I got GLE? (Skrrt)
Watch all my money times three (woah)
In the Maybach, recline in the seats (yeah, yeah)
Bitch 'bout to Uber, she eat (eat up)
I bust a nut, yeah, I skeet (yeah, skeet)
They don't really know 'bout a Yeat (no)
They ain't even heard of me (heard)
