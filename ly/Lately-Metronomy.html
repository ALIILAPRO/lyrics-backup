		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been waiting around
For someone like her to get in contact with me
She could be the greatest
I know she'd be the greatest
If only she was open to see me
It's alright though
'Cause I got time
Time isn't my essence and time isn't the line
It's alright though
She'll give me a buzz
I'll call her my baby
And she'll call me her cuz
Well, I think I'm in love 'cause

Lately, I call you
When I do nothing, oh
Lately, I call you
When I do nothing, oh

Well, that is love
Yeah, that is love and it's hard to do
It's a job for two

How do I do what I do
If I don't get nothing from you?
And I've so much work what to do
Yeah, I've so much work to do now
Oh, it's work for you 'cause

Lately, I call you
When I do nothing, oh
Lately, I call you
When I do nothing, oh
