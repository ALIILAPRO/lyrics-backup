		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Poison inside of my mind
Maybe that's all that I know
You give me more than a high
I let you take all control
I'll be back in a second
Smoke a pack, double back
Give me time to replenish
If I am then I am
I don't try to pretend
I could die in your hands
Give me all that you have
I wont tell you to go
I feel my heart getting colder than yours
Tell me I'm yours
I want you
Tell me I'm yours
I need you close
I'll breathe you in till I'm itching for more
Tell me I'm yours
I want you
See why I fall for you time after time after time I can't get it to end
I know it's causing me damage but this shit is hard to accept
You tear me apart
You drag me out till I'm thin I just know who you are
You tear me apart
You tear me apart
Poison inside of my mind
Maybe that's all that I know
You give me more than a high
I let you take all control
I'll be back in a second
Smoke a pack, double back
Give me time to replenish
If I am then I am
I don't try to pretend
I could die in your hands
Give me all that you have
I wont tell you to go
I feel my heart getting colder than yours
Tell me I'm yours
I want you
Tell me I'm yours
I need you close
I'll breathe you in
Till I'm itching for more
Tell me I'm yours
I want you
