		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I take a look at my life and realize there's nothing left
'Cause I've been blastin' and laughin' so long
That everyone thinks my mind is gone
But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it
To be treated like a punk, you know that's unheard of
You'd better watch how you're talkin' and where you're walkin'
'Cause this life will only leave you lined in chalk

Been spendin' most of life
Livin' in a gangster's paradise
Been spending most of life
Livin' in a gangster's paradise

Forget the situation they got me facin'
I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the stripes
So I gotta be down with the hood team
These television watchin' got me chasin' dreams
Death ain't nothing but a heartbeat away
I'm living life do or die, what can I say?
I'm here right now, will I see tomorrow?
The way things are goin' I don't know

Tell me why are we
So blind to see
That the ones we hurt
Are you and me (Tell me!)
Been spendin' most of life
Livin' in a gangster's paradise
Been spending most of life
Livin' in a gangster's paradise
Been spendin' most of life
Livin' in a gangster's paradise
Been spending most of life
Livin' in a gangster's paradise

Power and the money, money and the power
Minute after minute, hour after hour
Everybody's runnin', but half of them ain't lookin'
What's going on in the kitchen, but I don't know what's cookin'
They say I gotta learn
But nobody's here to teach me
If they can't understand it, how can they reach me?
I guess they can't
I guess they won't
I guess I'm fucked
That's how I know my life is out of luck

Been spendin' most of life
Livin' in a gangster's paradise
Been spending most of life
Livin' in a gangster's paradise
Been spendin' most of life
Livin' in a gangster's paradise
Been spending most of life
Livin' in a gangster's paradise

Why are we
So blind to see
That the ones we hurt
Are you and me
