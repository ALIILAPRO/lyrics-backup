		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
Ayy

Tweakin' on vacation with me
You set limitations with me
Why do I get treated different?
I don't know how you run the bases with me
Then say nothing sacred with me
Why do I get treated different?
Sun is setting on the Atlantic, I bet a full moon is gonna show
Wondering what rocks your boat
What keeps your heavy heart afloat
I don't know, I don't know

Bipolar baby, seems like it just went undiagnosed
Blocked me on everything, that's so immature, so unprovoked, I
Don't even know why

Had plans to understand ya
Mariana, you broke my faith
Why you gotta listen to the propaganda?
We just broke the ice, and now you're both leaving
I was being kind, I don't understand ya
You should let your sister be the voice of reason
Either it's your text that I'm misreading
Or it's just your actions are misleading
Don't know how they do things in Pristina
I just know the tension is increasing
It's plenty people dead to me still breathing
Plenty other ways to get over people
You ain't had to step on me to gain freedom
No, no, you remind me of someone I think you know
You know and I know things that she didn't know
I'm not the same person I was five drinks ago
You tried to grease me, but we're not in Mykonos
I don't get hurt much, but I'm not invincible
Bidin' my time with you, then things got political
Oh, I read your last text, you're gettin' bold
Tellin' me what rocks your boat, what keeps your heavy heart afloat
I don't know

Bipolar baby, seems like it just went undiagnosed
Blocked me on everything, that's so immature, so unprovoked, I
Don't even know why
Don't know why

I adore
I adore you
Baby, I adore you
If I mentioned the pride before the fall
'Cause I wanna risk it all for you
What they say 'bout the writings on the wall?
No clue
Baby, I adore you
Baby, I adore
I adore you
Baby, I adore
