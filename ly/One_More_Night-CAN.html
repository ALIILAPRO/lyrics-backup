		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One more Saturday night, 
One more grey shoot, 
One more happy to love, 
One more Saturday night. 

One more thinking you should, 
One more thinking you're right, 
One more thinking you love, 
One more thinking you're right, 

One more thinking you're bad, 
One more thinking you should, 
One more thinking you love, 
One more thinking you're fine. 

One more Saturday night, 
One more Saturday night, 
One more Saturday night, 
One more Saturday night. 

Come back, come back, 
Come back, come back, 
Come back, come back, 
Come back, come back, 

Come back, come back, 
Come back, come back, 
Come back, come back, come back, 
Come back, come back, come back, 

Come back, come back, come back, 
Come back, come back, come back, 
Come back, come back, come back, 
Come back, come back, come back. 

One more thinking you laugh, 
One more thinking you laugh. 
One more suck at your life, 
One more suck at your life, 

One more suck at your life, 
One more suck at your life, 
One more suck at your life, 
One more suck at your life, 

One more suck at your head, 
One more suck at your feet, 
One more suck at your eyes, 
One more suck at your shed. 

One more Saturday night, 
One more Saturday night, 
One more Saturday night, 
One more Saturday night, 

One more Saturday night. 
One more entering head, 
One more entering out, 
One more entering head, 

One more entering out, 
One more entering head, 
One more thinking you laugh, 
One more thinking you laugh, 

One more thinking you laugh, 
One more thinking you laugh, 
One more thinking you laugh, 
One more thinking you laugh, 

One more thinking you're down, 
One more thinking you're down, 
One more thinking you're down, 
One more thinking you're down, 

One more thinking where you go, 
One more thinking where you go, 
One more Saturday night, oh.
