		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sweaty body, the sun is burning
Yeah, I'm feeling kinda hot right now
And my T-shirt is now useless
I thought I was ready
Obviously I wasn't
My body's burning and I got to get inside
'Cause I'm feeling kinda dizzy

But remember that I love you
And you know I always will
And remember that I'll dream about you, baby
(I'll dream about you, baby)

Baby, I have to go, really need to leave now
Yeah, I'm putting on my T-shirt
It's not what I want to but I have to get inside
'Cause I'm feelin' way too dizzy

But remember that I love you
And you know I always will
And remember that I'll dream about you, baby
Yeah

let's go

But remember that I love you
And you know I always will
And remember that I'll dream about you, baby
