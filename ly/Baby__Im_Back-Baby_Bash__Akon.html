		<p>
		  Ooh, yeah
And anything that you wanna do, I'll do it
(Tell me what the word is, already)
(Tell me what the word is, already)
(Tell me what the word is, already)
(Tell me what the word is, already)
Baby

Don't look no further
Baby, I'm back, yeah
I'm here to cater to you
Anything that you want me to, I'll do it
'Cause I'll be your lover (I'll be your lover)
And I'll be your best friend
Tell me what I gotta do 
Tell me what I gotta do and I'll do it

Now I'm back in a flesh, feelin' so blessed
Back in your corner, sugar, sugar don't stress
Forget about the rest, let's go inside
I'm back in your zone, baby, back in your vibe
Now I can't be denied, I can lie, I'm on ya
I never ever wanna say "Sayonara"
Somebody told me that the grass was greener
On the other side, andele, ariba
Never really intended on being a cheater
What I gotta do to be your keeper?
These words comin' out the speaker
Trill love is off the meter

Don't look no further
Baby, I'm back, yeah
I'm here to cater to you
Anything that you want me to, I'll do it
'Cause I'll be your lover (I'll be your lover)
And I'll be your best friend
Tell me what I gotta do 
Tell me what I gotta do and I'll do it

I was gone for a minute but now I'm home
Kids forget me for being a Rolling Stone
Please forgive me, let me polish it up like chrome
Get off the phone, tell them squares to leave you alone
Let me spark your interest
Now there's no more dating on the internet
'Cause you already know how I get it wet
How I keep it so softly and I get respect
You don't have to look no further (no)
You dealin' with the whole enchilada (yeah)
You don't have to look no further (no)
You hotter then a fire starter (yeah)

Don't look no further (don't look no look further)
Baby, I'm back, yeah (yeah)
I'm here to cater to you
Anything that you want me to, I'll do it
'Cause I'll be your lover (I'll be your lover)
And I'll be your best friend
Tell me what I gotta do 
Tell me what I gotta do and I'll do it

I was gone for a minute (oh)
I was gone for a minute (oh)
I was gone for a minute (oh)
I was gone for a minute (oh)
Now I'm back, let me hit it (oh)
Now I'm back, let me hit it (oh)
Now I'm back, let me hit it (oh)
Now I'm back, let me hit it (oh)

('Cause I'm back, baby)
Don't look no farther (baby, I'm back)
Baby, I'm back, yeah (so believe me when I tell you girl, I'm back, baby)
I'm here to cater to you (I said I'm back, baby)
'Cause I'll be your lover (ooh yes, I'm back, baby)
And I'll be your best friend (oh, you better believe it)
Tell me what I gotta do, do, for you

Don't look no further
Baby, I'm back, yeah
I'm here to cater to you
Anything that you want me to, and I'll do it
'Cause I'll be your lover (I'll be your lover)
And I'll be your best friend (yeah)
Tell me what I gotta do 
Tell me what I gotta do and I'll do it
