		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Every time I think about how you act
You got no life, you got no respect
Yeah every time I think about how you act
You got nothing, nothing left

Leeches and hypocrites
They even steal the air we breathe
Pretending and faking it
To be something they cannot be

You come around when you know you need something
Stick around and try to get anything
But I know who's really down with me
Back tha fuck up you bumbklatt enemy

Boom 
Watch you got? 
Watch you watch you got?
Watch you got?
Boom

Happiness is to give back 
Love one another, have respect
Give more to receive less
Give life, soul and fire

Using people like they are tools
Treating them like they're just fools
Always quiet but I know what you do
God knows and you will too

Fuck you, you fuckin' disgrace 
And then you act like everything's the same
I don't dig it, I don't play mind games
Don't fuck with me and my friends

Give more to receive more
Give life, soul and fire
