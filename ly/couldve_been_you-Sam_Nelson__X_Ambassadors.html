		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Could've been you
Who'd be the one I'd give my keys to
Split this fifth of Jack with on my roof
Could've been you
Could've been you
Who held my hand in that waiting room
And been the arms I fell apart into
Could've been you

Oh, the time it takes to reconcile
The friend you were with the one you're not
The one I loved with the one that's changed
Yeah, you pulled that rug out from under my legs
Could've been you
It's just me instead

Could've been you
Who'd be the one that I confide in
Be a space that I could hide in
But you never came through

Could've been you
I texted when I heard that Todd died
When my whole world fucking capsized
I kept thinking about you
How he could've been you

Oh, the time it takes to make amends
With the friend you were with the one you ain't
The one I love with the one I hate
Man, I miss you like hell, where the hell you been?
Could've been you
Should me instead
Oh, it's just me instead
Oh, whoa, oh, oh
Mm, oh

Yeah, you pulled that rug out from under my legs
I miss you like hell, where the hell you been?
Could've been you
Yeah, sick
