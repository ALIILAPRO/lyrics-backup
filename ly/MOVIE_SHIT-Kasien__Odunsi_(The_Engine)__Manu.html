Pull up on me if you want that movie shit
Pull up on me if you want that movie shit
Pull up on me if you want that movie shit
Pull up on me if you want that movie shit
You want that movie shit
Pull up on me 


Go too hard 
Never quit (till I die)
Living fast 
Lizzie flip (multiply) 
Like Kaluuya like Boyega (I've arrived ) 
Black and British flexing on my haters (On my life)
Young and wild and free and I'm on top like Asher D (boy)
Imma Goodfella go getter chasing dreams (boy)
Come like Zack and Cody top floor living suit(e)
And we Superbad Im of the X she on the codeine 


Pull up on me if you want that movie shit
Pull up on me if you want that movie shit
Pull up on me if you want that movie shit
Pull up on me if you want that movie shit
Pour the Maggy in the Sprite it got me twiss
Getting Money Mitch, lifestyle Richie Rich
On some movie shit
On some movie shit
Pull up on me if you want that movie shit


Like Scorcese, Tarantino, Steve McQueen I go for gold 
I got vision and goals 
Tryna be rich and old 
Feel like Ciesay feel like Soulz (they my bros)
I Am Legend pen game Lethal Weapon watch me die a goat
Built like Rocky taurus Raging Bull won't back down I'm on smoke
Fuck the system Im the one like Neo think I cracked the code
Half Jamaican half Nigerian really best of both worlds 
So Fast And Furious bitch Im always on go 


Yeah
Thats my ex that's my old ting
Saw me in her dreams saw me in your dreams (yeah)
When I bought that Louis yeah it felt like a dream (yeah)
When I bought that Gucci yeah it felt like a dream (yeah)
Don't you try and play me yeah nigga in your dreams
Thats that movie shit thats that movie shit
Goddamn Psycho I'm not new to this 
Niggas gonna watch this like a Cinema


Pull up on me if you want that movie shit
Pull up on me if you want that movie shit
Pull up on me if you want that movie shit
Pull up on me if you want that movie shit
Pour the Maggy in the sprite it got me twiss
Getting Money Mitch, lifestyle Richie Rich
On some movie shit
On some movie shit
Pull up on me if you want that movie shit
