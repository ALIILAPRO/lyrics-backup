		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Why does it feel so special
When everything’s falling to pieces
My life became so crucial
You took my mind thru some places
I’ve never been before

And If i got another chance
If I got another dance
Ill take it

And If i got another chance
If I got another dance
Ill take the first flight to Vienna

I’ll take it
Ill take the first flight to Vienna

Cause when I look at you woman
I just feel some kind of way
Maybe I'm getting too hopeful
But baby I just want to say

You made it all so special
When everything’s falling to pieces
My life became so crucial
You took my mind thru some places

And If i got another chance
If I got another dance
Ill take it

And If i got another chance
If I got another dance
Ill take the first flight to Vienna

And If i got another chance
If I got another dance
Ill take it

And If i got another chance
If I got another dance
Ill take the first flight to Vienna
