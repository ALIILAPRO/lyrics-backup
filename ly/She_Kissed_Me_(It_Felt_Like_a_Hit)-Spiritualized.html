		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uptight in her little world
Got a feeling gonna mess around
I gotta fever running in my blood
Don't care if I'm misunderstood
Gonna shoot it up and take my high
Got a feeling it ain't gonna die
Gonna fuck it up and mess around
I gotta feeling it ain't coming down
Don't care if it's hit or miss
'Cause then she kissed me and it felt like a hit
Come on

Uptight gonna drive me wild
Got me shaking like a little child
Got a devil cutting in my blood
Damn it baby if this ain't good
Got a fever gonna make it mine
Fuck it up, take it one more time
Little baby gonna get real fucked
I got a feeling gonna me up tonight
Don't care if this is hit or miss
'Cause then she kissed me and it felt like a hit
Come on

Uptight in her little world
Got a feeling gonna mess around
Got a fever coming in my blood
Don't care if I'm misunderstood
Gonna shoot it up and take my high
Got a feeling it ain't gonna die
Gonna fuck it up and mess around
Got a feeling it ain't coming down
Don't care if this is hit or miss
'Cause then she kissed me and it felt like a hit
Come on

Then she kissed me and it felt like a hit (x3)
Then she kissed me and it felt like this
Come on
