		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In my element
Triple threat
Check the evidence
More than relevant
Comin’ hard
Taking precedence
Bitches hella bent
I’m a problem
Got em sick of it
Bitch I been a 10
Hella wins
Count the dividends

Price up
When I turn this mic up
Bars sweeter than my pussy
When I pipe up
If you gotta problem, keep it pushing, betta swipe up
Pedal to the medal passing bitches in a pileup


Who’s that?
Me?
Pushing my Ps
They could never ever, ever get like me

Look at my shoes
Look at my jeans
Booty so big gotta stuff em in these

Wait wait wait wait
Wait wait wait wait
Wait wait wait wait
Wait wait wait wait


Iced out like a freezr
Hear that bass thump, place shaking like a seizure
Ion do this for the likes, I do it for the leisure
All these bitches pussy, baby I’m a eater

Ring ring
Who’s that on my beeper
I be jugging on the low, mmm gully creeper
When I pull up they be grim, mmm ima reaper
Wavy off the remy, ion do tequila
Mmm


Who’s that?
Me?
Pushing my Ps
They could never ever, ever get like me

Look at my shoes
Look at my jeans
Booty so big gotta stuff em in these

Wait wait wait wait
Wait wait wait wait
Wait wait wait wait
Wait wait wait wait
