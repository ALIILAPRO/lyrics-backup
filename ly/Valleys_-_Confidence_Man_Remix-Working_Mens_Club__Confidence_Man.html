		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Trapped inside a town
Inside my mind
Stuck with no ideas
I'm running out of time
There's no quick escape
So many mistakes
I'll play the long game
'Cause winter is a curse
And the valley is my hearse
When will it take me to the grave?

Why is the darkness so strong?
I'm feeling broken again
So many voices fight
The fusion is right as the sense
Why is the darkness so strong?
I'm feeling broken again
So many voices fight
The fusion is right as the sense

There's a reason for this life
The soul just a light
Have you ever thought about it?
There's no reason for this life
The soul just a lie
You need to think about it

Why is the darkness so strong?
And I'm feeling broken again
So many voices fight
The fusion is right as the sense
Why is the darkness so strong?
I'm feeling broken again
So many voices fight
The fusion is right as the sense
