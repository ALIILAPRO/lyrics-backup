		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Operator, could you help me place this call
You see the number on the match box is old and faded
He's living in L.A
With my best old ex friend ray
A girl he said he knew well but sometimes hated

Isn't that the way they say it goes
But lets forget all that
And give me the number if you can find it
So I can call just to tell him I'm fine
And to show, I overcome the blow
I learned to take it well
I only wish my words could just convince myself
That it just wasn't real
But that's not the way it feels

Operator, could you help me place this call
'Cause I can't read the number that you just gave me
There's something in my eyes
You know it happens everytime
I think about the love that I thought would save me

But isn't that the way they say it goes
But lets forget all that
And give me the number if you can find it
So I can call just to tell him I'm fine
And to show, I overcome the blow
I learned to take it well
I only wish my words could just convince myself
That it just wasn't real
But that's not the way it feels, no, no
That's not the way it feels,
Operator, lets forget about this call
There's no one there I really wanted to talk to
Thank you for your time
You've been so much more then kind

You can keep the dime

But isn't that the way they say it goes
But lets forget all that
And give me the number if you can find it
So I can call just to tell him I'm fine
And to show, I overcome the blow
I learned to take it well
I only wish my words could just convince myself
That it just wasn't real
But that's not the way it feels

Oh no no no
That's not the way it feels, no no no
