		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Paradise, sleeping in under bright white snow
I'm alive, this could be it for all we know
I'm a mess, don't know what I would do without you
I could cry, leading you down the same old road

I just never see it coming
Only butterflies until the bullets fly around my head again
Sick of running in a circle
All the stomach pains, I'm tired of medicating the adrenaline

Under this avalanche with you
Avalanche with you
I feel the world collapsing down
But after all that I've been through
Long as I'm with you
Nobody can hurt me now
It's been breaking me, breaking me
Tired to the bone
You're saving me, say to me
I'm not alone
In this avalanche with you
Avalanche with you
Nobody can hurt us now

You and I, maybe we'll disappear like ghosts
Intertwined, in a couple of years they'll write our stone
Here lies a lucky man who was losing all hope
A real life and a beautiful soul who never let go

I just never see the warning
Only butterflies until the bullets fly around my head again, oh
Sick of running in a circle
All the stomach aches, I'm tired of medicating the adrenaline

Under this avalanche with you
Avalanche with you
I feel the world collapsing down
But after all that I've been through
Long as I'm with you
Nobody can hurt me now
It's been breaking me, breaking me
Tired to the bone
You're saving me, say to me
I'm not alone
In this avalanche with you
Avalanche with you
Nobody can hurt us now

I think of all the wasted nights
Think of all the tears you cried
Because of me, because of us
Ash to ash, dust to dust
I don't wanna waste more time
We will make it out alive
Hold my head, I'll sleep forever

Under this avalanche with you
Avalanche with you
I feel the world collapsing down
After all that I've been through (all that I've been through)
Long as I'm with you (long as I'm with you)
Nobody can hurt me now (no)
It's been breaking me, breaking me
Tired to the bone
You're saving me, say to me
I'm not alone
In this avalanche with you
Avalanche with you
Nobody can hurt us now, now
