		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, life is so hard
And you have to choose
The call of the wind
On the highway of fools
Why does a man never cry when he's feeling
You murder all his feelings
Will you still be there
Only love knows why
Between the fire
When white doves cry?
Why does a man never show what he's meaning
To murder all his feelings
And you cry in the night
When there's no one besides
Your tears

Don't worry baby
I'll be by your side
Don't let it ever get you down with you tonight
Don't worry baby
Where he has gone?
My heart is out of my control
I'm falling strong

Don't worry pretty baby
Come and get you down tonight
Come and get
Come and get
Come and get you down
Your heart of pride
Don't worry pretty baby
Come and get you down tonight
Come and get
Come and get
Come and get you down
Your heart of pride
Heart and pride

I live for love
And you've got to try
Oh, don't let this chance, baby pass you by
Why does a girl never cry when her feelings
Are murdered by bad dealings
It started in heaven 
There's a place for you
Give me the chance for a rendez-vous
Why does a girl never shows what she's meaning
You murder all her feelings
And you cry in the night
When there's no one beside
Your tears
