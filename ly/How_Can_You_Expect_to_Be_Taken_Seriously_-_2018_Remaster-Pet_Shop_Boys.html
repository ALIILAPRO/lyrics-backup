		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You live upon a stage, and everyone's agreed
You're the brightest hope by far that anyone can see
So when you take the limelight you can guarantee
You're gaining fame and claiming credibility

Tell me baby are you gonna get high as a kite?
Tell me baby are you gonna let it happen every night
How can you expect to be taken seriously?

You live within the law, and everyone assumes
You must find this a bore, and try something new
You're an intellectual giant, an authority
To preach and teach the whole world about ecology

Tell me baby are you gonna make any other claims?
Tell me baby are you gonna take any of the blame?
How can you expect to be taken seriously?
How can you expect to be taken seriously?

You live within the headlines, so everyone can see
You're supporting every new cause and meeting royalty
You're another major artist on a higher plane
Do you think they'll put you in the Rock'n'Roll Hall of Fame?
 
Tell me baby how you generate longevity
Tell me baby how you really hate publicity
How can you expect to be taken seriously?
How can you expect to be taken seriously?

Seriously
Seriously 

How can you expect to be taken seriously?
How can you expect to be taken seriously?
