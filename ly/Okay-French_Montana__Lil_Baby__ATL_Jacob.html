		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Okay
Montana, okay
Dope Boy, okay
ATL Jacob, he a fuckin' millionaire
Han

She wanna ride with the star (star)
Ended up droppin' my top, okay
My ex told me she needed space (space)
I guess we both goin' to Mars, okay
I cannot forget the base
I'm takin' my mop on my dates, okay
Just look at the look on their faces
They wanna jump in my place, okay
Told shorty she was the one (the one, han)
But I'm takin' her friends after ten, okay
I told 'em to load up the dock
But they wanna ride in my Benz, okay
One of one, this a new Cullinan (skrr)
No tellin' what I'ma spend, okay (spend, okay)
Ain't countin' up no more dubs again (no)
Only fuckin' with the Benjamins, okay (han, han, han)

Straight off a plane to the spot, freshen up, put on studs
Tell the vibes to meet up, get it goin', let's go
I throw a fit in Rick Owens, okay
Mama the shit and she know how she be
Ain't just talkin', I got it, I show it (don't play)
Send a boardin' pass when she get bored (come play)
Country hoppin' in Europe, we tourin' (UK)
Keep it low if they know that it's roarin' (don't say)
Went ceramic, the Audemars blue it's six-fifty
They ain't brought 'em out yet, these the new ones (cherished)
Havin' motion, don't ask what I'm doin' (I'm turnt)
Tryna see her, she pretty, she goin' (okay)
Haters hate, that's their job, they gon' do it (go off)
I won't wear Air Force Ones with the Louis (they Virgil)
Tell the business, you fumbled, you blew it (you dirty)
Bro didn't do it, the lawyers gon' prove it (not guilty)
She delusional, makin' up shit in her head and believin' it
she just be needin' the space

She wanna ride with the star (star)
Ended up droppin' my top, okay
My ex told me she needed space (space)
I guess we both goin' to Mars, okay
I cannot forget the base
I'm takin' my mop on my dates, okay
Just look at the look on their faces
They wanna jump in my place, okay
Told shorty she was the one (the one, han)
But I'm takin' her friends after ten, okay
I told 'em to load up the dock
But they wanna ride in my Benz, okay
One of one, this a new Cullinan (skrr)
No tellin' what I'ma spend, okay (spend, okay)
Ain't countin' up no more dubs again (no)
Only fuckin' with the Benjamins, okay (han, han, han)

Made hundred mill and took over street with no sponsor, man (sponsor, man)
Comin' through customs and flyin' through Cali, they checkin the jet for the contraband (contraband)
Brought out the coupe (skrr)
Shorty got grouped out, told lil' bitch to stay off the 'Gram (off the 'Gram)
Don't be the first to get hit with that Draco (Bah-bah)
Soulja Boy or that Aubrey Graham (Aubrey Graham)
Don't be playin', han
She howl at the moon, I be barkin' (han)
I am a goon, she a goblin (han)
Coke Boy like Loon up in Harlem (han)
Ramadan but we ain't starvin' (han, ooh)
Came out the mud on my own (own, han)
That's word to Rick, I don't owe 'em (han)
Shoot your shooter out his zone (Bah-bah, han)
So rich they think I got cloned

She wanna ride with the star (star)
Ended up droppin' my top, okay
My ex ho' say she needed space (space)
I guess we both goin' to Mars, okay
I cannot forget the base
I'm takin' my mop on my dates, okay
Just look at the look on their faces
They wanna jump in my place, okay
Told shorty she was the one (the one, han)
But I'm takin' her friends after ten, okay
I told 'em to load up the dock
But they wanna ride in my Benz, okay
One of one, this a new Cullinan (skrr)
No tellin' what I'ma spend, okay (spend, okay)
Ain't countin' up no more dubs again (no)
Only fuckin' with the Benjamins, okay (han, han, han)
