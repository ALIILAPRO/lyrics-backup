		  I been through a lot
So don't try to stop me
I been through a lot
I been through a lot
I been through a lot
I been through a lot
I'm parked in the lot
'Cause I been through a lot
I been through a lot

I been through a lot, whoa
So don't try to stop me
They think that they got me, no
But they cannot stop me
They cannot stop me
No, no they cannot stop me
I been through a lot
Swear I been through a lot
I been through a lot
So I skurt out the lot
'Cause I been through a lot
And now I'm at the top
I been through a lot
You wouldn't understand
Unless you been through a lot
Damn, damn, damn

Lil bitch, I'm a muthafuckin' martian
My niggas they bitin', not barkin'
My brother say bring him a Rari
He say he got aim with the warrant
I ride in the foreign, you walkin'
I chop your shit off with the carbine
My baby hair pink, she a Barbie
I got on six rings like I'm Lordy
Mama told me "stack the cash up!"
I just need my ice and Jag up
Bitch I'm so fresh I'm Mick Jagger
Bring her to me, I'mma bag her
Fuck on that bitch and buy that bitch a bag
I'm strickly like pimping, got it from my dad
My belt is by Hermes, I can never sag
I'm too rich to be mad, I'm so glad
I'm a Jackass like I'm Steve-O
I'm smokin' weed 'cause it's legal
In other words, I got an address in Cali, oh yeah these hoes
Know all about my ego
Know all about my people
Know all about my b-roll
Yeah these hoes, yeah these hoes

I been through a lot, whoa
So don't try to stop me
They think that they got me, no
But they cannot stop me
They cannot stop me
No, no they cannot stop me
I been through a lot
Swear I been through a lot
I been through a lot
So I skurt out the lot
'Cause I been through a lot
And now I'm at the top
I been through a lot
You wouldn't understand
Unless you been through a lot
Damn, damn, damn

Now I had a dream
I would sell out all my shows
Now I'm sellin' out my shows
The baddest hoes front row
Teachers said I wouldn't be nada
Now I'm buyin' mama Prada
No job, no deal
Can't explain how it feel
I'm livin' good for real
Most couldn't do it
I'm the one who did it
Went from ridin' Civic to a BMW
All you niggas dubs
I want all my dubs
50s and 'em 100s
Boy, I'm just livin' my dreams
Gotta get it by any means
I'm the King of the Teens
Ballin' like I had six wings

I been through a lot, whoa
So don't try to stop me
They think that they got me, no
But they cannot stop me
They cannot stop me
No, no they cannot stop me
I been through a lot
Swear I been through a lot
I been through a lot
So I skurt out the lot
'Cause I been through a lot
And now I'm at the top
I been through a lot
You wouldn't understand
Unless you been through a lot
Damn, damn, damn

Let the motherfucka breathe, man
Lemme hit my cup
Lemme hit my blunt
Let the motherfucka breathe for a minute
Lil Boat, what's happenin'?
Okay
Okay bool
Okay cool
I dig
Aye, aye

Let the streets know that the cash talk
Fuck that, I'mma tear up the asphalt
I got a few Ms I ain't standin' close
I'm makin' it rain that's a thunderstorm
Young boy, put your mama on
Young boy, give your brother some
He straight in the slammer though
Live wonderfully after all
Ayy, ayy
I swear I'mma ballout
I'm breakin' a oddball
I'm doin' it for the 'cause
Bitch, I made myself the boss
Bitch, I made myself the boss

I been through a lot, whoa
So don't try to stop me
They think that they got me, no
But they cannot stop me
They cannot stop me
No, no they cannot stop me
I been through a lot
Swear I been through a lot
I been through a lot
So I skurt out the lot
'Cause I been through a lot
And now I'm at the top
I been through a lot
You wouldn't understand
Unless you been through a lot
Damn, damn, damn
