		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Why you come with me?

Let's play, let's dance, let's play, let's dance
Shuck me, suck me, eat me raw

When I see you, I'll take what I want
When I see you, I'll get what I want

So shuck me, suck me, eat me raw
Shuck me, suck me, eat me raw
Shuck me, suck me, eat me raw
Shuck me, suck me, eat me raw

Let's play, let's prance, let's play, let's dance
Eat me raw, eat me raw

I need, I need, I need, I need, I need, Annie, Annie, AnnieÂ 

Shuck me, suck me, eat me raw
Shuck me, suck me, eat me raw
Shuck me, suck me, eat me raw

Let's play, play, let's dance, help
