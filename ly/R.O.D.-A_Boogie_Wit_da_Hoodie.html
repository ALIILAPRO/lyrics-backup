		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Me and you naked, baby
I wanna taste it
I won't ever say shit
You're not my favorite
I swear, I can picture us naked
I swear, I swear, I wanna taste it only if I say if I care
And I care, I don't just say shit
Baby, let's get naked
You ain't gotta worry 'bout shit
Just be my ride or die bitch
Yeah, yeah, nah, nah, girl
You the type I vibe with
Yeah, just hold it down, do not switch
My ride or die bitch

It's DTB, no, I don't trust bitches
And, I don't mean no disrespect, 'cause you know I love women
Yeah girl, I know we got problems, but I hate discussin' 'em
If I fuck with ya, girl then I fuck with ya
This time, this time, I wanna make love to ya
Don't you switch sides, baby, I ain't done with you
Just help me get by, get by these trust issues
I swear, I swear, I feel uncomfortable
'Cause I used to call you my baby, but now I'm a dub to you
Used to pull up on you with flowers, show you my love for you
You know, we both from the bottom, so I ain't judgin' you
Yeah, I ain't judgin' you
But, I'm the reason you are this way
You used to fuck a lot, you don't even fuck the same
And who you puttin' on that makeup and lingerie for?
It's something that I wanna say
Baby if you, (baby if you) give it to me (give it to me)
I'ma give to you, 'cause I know what you want, yeah
You wanna be in, up in my double R
The one with the stars the sky, yeah, we in Louis Vuitton
Just hold it down for me, you my ride or die bitch
I take care of everything and pay the bills for you
And don't you ever fuckin' ask me 'bout no side bitch
And everything you say I do for you, I will for you
I'll be the reason why it's Hermes in your closet
Usually I don't be checkin', but I will for ya
Tell me something I don't know, baby I'm nauseous
Look, I've been buggin' lately, I been feelin' heartless, huh
You think I changed, nigga?
Huh, I'm still the same nigga
I still will catch a stain, nigga
Still walkin' through puddles full of pain, nigga
I'm A Boogie Wit A Hoodie and a chain nigga
With a guitar now, nigga, I'm a lane switcher
And a good car now, literally a lane switcher
Take off your leotard now, girl let's get naked, yeah

I swear, I swear, me and you naked
I swear, I swear, I wanna taste it
And if I say I care, then I care, I don't just say shit
I still get nervous conversations with you
Caught me stutterin' when I say shit, like, "Can I take you on, on a vacation?"
I will spin the block, 'cause you're my baby
I would hate to lose my love for an acquaintance 
My ride or die bitch
Just hold it down, no matter what, do not switch
Yeah, yeah, nah, nah, girl
You the type I vibe with
Yeah, just ride for me, never doubt shit
My ride or die bitch
