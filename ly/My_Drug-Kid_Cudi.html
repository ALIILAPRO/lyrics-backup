		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no

Had me from the jump, can't tell a lie, babe
You call a nigga up
Say you wanna say hi and you need me
And I'm sick, I been waitin' now
My woman in the glowin' light, ohh
See I got things I'd like to show you, ooh

Take my heart, lady (take my heart, lady)
If you fall I will catch you, babe
Missed you long, honey (missed you so)
Kiss you soft while I stroke you, babe
Open, you'll receive my love (love, love)
As epic as can be my drug (yeah)

Fall into my arms
Let go, trust me, you're my God
I need you're light
Babe, take me high up
Feel you in my bones, controlling me
Yes, you're like a dream
You and everything that you be
Will you

Take my heart, lady (take my heart, lady)
If you fall I will catch you, babe
Missed you long, honey (missed you so)
Kiss you soft while I stroke you, babe
Open, you'll receive my love (love, love)
As epic as can be my drug (yeah)
