		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's something underneath my skin no-one can detect
It's time to detonate within with maximum effect
Lying in some secret place, without warning, without trace
The planets and the stars align and wires will just connect

Science or nature
Scattering spores and seeds
Before my maker
I'll get down on my knees
Have you an answer?
Or another IED?
And if I disarm you
Will you let me be?

A driver in the darkness nods his head and starts to yawn
We've both been on this journey since the day that we were born
Two lives on a single track, a plus and minus now attract
Intersecting on my map an hour before the dawn

Science or nature
Scattering spores and seeds
Before my maker
I'll get down on my knees
Have you an answer?
Or another IED?
And if I disarm you
Will you let me be?

A sniper on the rooftop gently calibrates his sights
A passing stranger in the crowd steps into his light
That well-known face could be you as the focus sharpens into view
The moment comes, his aim is true, and he fades into the night

Science or nature
Scattering spores and seeds
Before my maker
I'll get down on my knees

Have you an answer?
Or another IED?
And if I disarm you
Will you let me be?
