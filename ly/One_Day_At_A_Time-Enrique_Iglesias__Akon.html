One day at a time

Saw you in the club
You were dancing with somebody
So close so tight
You were killing me so slowly
My friends were telling me what you're doing
Can drive a man so crazy
Trying to live my life
It's been 6 months since you left me

So I oh I oh I
Still thinking about you baby
I try I try
But I guess I gotta take it

One day at a time
I gotta let you go
One day at a time
It seems so impossible
One day at a time
I gotta let you go
And I know, yes I know
I gotta take it one day at a time

One day, one day, one day
One day at a time
One day, one day, one day
One day at a time

I am not the jealous heart
But you stole my heart baby
Dancing with that guy
Made it so hard for me to watch baby
I just been around running in circle
I'm going through it in my mind baby
Had to suck up the tears from my night strolls
To stop from crying out loud baby

Oh I oh I
Still thinking about you baby
I try I try
Can't stop thinking about you baby
Oh I oh I
I keep thinking about you baby
I try I try
But I guess I gotta take it

One day at a time
Said I gotta let you go
One day at a time
But it seems so impossible
One day at a time
Said I gotta let you go
And I know, and I know
I gotta take it one day at a time

First thing I gotta do is try to face it (try to face it)
But your voice keeps playing in my ear (playing in my ear)
It just makes me crazy trying to fake it (trying to fake it)
The true event's so bad, it's not what I wanna hear
But I guess I gotta take it

One day at a time
I gotta let you go
One day at a time
It seems so impossible
One day at a time
I gotta let you go
And I know, yes I know
I gotta take it one day at a time

One day at a time
Said I gotta let you go
One day at a time
But it seems so impossible
One day at a time
Said I gotta let you go
And I know, yes I know
I gotta take it one day at a time

One day at a time
Said I gotta let you go
One day at a time
But it seems so impossible
One day at a time
Said I gotta let you go
And I know, yes I know
I gotta take it one day at a time
