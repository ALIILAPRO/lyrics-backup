If say how I feel
Would you really listen?
If you was all mine
I'd be all in

Came up outta that dirt pile, now I'm ballin'
And I don't need no church when I'm heaven-sent
Hope God put the loyalty in all my friends
'Cause Lord knows I got they back to the end
Right now I'm recordin' with the mic sittin' in my hand
I wish Three was on my left, where my Styrofoam is
Got up out of Cypress, went to the Woodlands
Got a safe room in my crib
Ain't no tellin' when I'ma have to use it
We all know how I live
Keepin' my gun everywhere I go
We all know I'm still here
Question my girl but love her strong
We all know how that is
Payin' for my daddy to come home
Pray he get a appeal
Hope he come take me away, keep me from off of these pills
And come get me from off of this drank before my kidneys, they fail
Tell my son it made me calm, I don't know what I'm doin'
Tell my girl these hoes can't make me cum, I only want her to do it
Ten lines straight goin' on ten days, my body ain't got no fluids
Please, oh, please don't die tryin' on a real
All alone, stalks and the shottas are unjudgemental
It ain't too far, right by the AM Mart up where they left my name
Won't be that long, yeah, it'll be a while
'Til my love life right again, killas on side again
Butterflies, paradise, them bullets left out the wind

If say how I feel
Would you really listen?
If you was all mine
I'd be all in

If I took the clean route, bank accounts got cleaned out
We'll still be at war, ridin' with the mops, tryna wipe the block down
.50 rounds on the bottom of that Glock, standin' in front of mom's house
Steady screamin', "Gang life," know my time comin' 'round

If I say how I feel
Would you really listen?
If you was all mine
I be all in
If I say how I feel
Would you really listen?
If you was all mine
I be all in
