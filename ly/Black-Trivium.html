		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Decomposing in this worthless tomb,
Nothingness inhaled, I am consumed.
Starving for the ending to this doom,
We the parasite, our death overdue.

Black!
It's opening.
Oh, how it stares!
So deep,
Into the soul,
So deep into the soul!

[Repeat: x2]
Black!
Downfall of decimation!
Black!
It tears apart the night!

Termination sits across my cell,
Waiting patiently to unleash Hell.
Frothing at the mouth, it's hunger tells,
Of the feast I'll soon become, my soul melts.

Black!
It's opening.
Oh, how it stares!
So deep,
Into the soul,
So deep into the soul!

[Repeat: x2]
Black!
Downfall of decimation!
Black!
It tears apart the night!

Oh!

Rain, rain down,
On, this hopeless, scorched abyss.
Rain down,
Termination's, all we're owed.
Rain down, rain, rain down!

[Repeat: x2]
Black!
It's opening.
Oh, how it stares!
So deep,
Into the soul,
So deep into the soul!

[Repeat: x3]
Black!
Downfall of decimation!
Black!
It tears apart the night!
