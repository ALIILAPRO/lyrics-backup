		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Follow your heart after dark
Follow your heart after-

Remember when you used to tell me
Just what I couldn't be
Used to think that you will help
Me find what's meant for me
Now I know that you will hold
Me down and let me drown
All the fish in the sea
Don't swim upstream like me

Never was the same, I can't complain
I'm not ashamed, and I won't change
And I don't do what I'm told
I listened to myself and no one else
And I can't help the way I'm built
To do it all on my own
Everything I evеr said
You know I meant it then
2024, I should be your prеsident
With a house full of hookers
My teacher said I'd be a trolley pusher
What the fuck does he know, he broke
This is all that we know
This is for my people
I had to put the blunt down
To pick the book up plottin' on
Off-size we go to see now
Still don't see 'em
They said I'd never be known
Still don't believe them

Remember when you used to tell me
Just what I couldn't be
Used to think that you will help
Me find what's meant for me
Now I know that you will hold
Me down and let me drown
All the fish in the sea
Don't swim upstream like me

My Dad said to be a lawyer, or a doctor
Don't he know I got lawyers on payroll
And street doctors
But the music is the medicine
Go through hell although I'm heavensent
Even if I never make a cent
I'ma do this to the very end
'Cause I chose to follow my passion
I turned my pain into champagne
If I chose to follow what they say
Then I would be stuck in the same place

Never let 'em tell you what you can do
Never let 'em tell you what you can do
Never let 'em tell you what you can do
Never let 'em tell you how to be you
