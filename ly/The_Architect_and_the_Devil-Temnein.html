		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Stones and sweat and blood, that's what it takes to build walls to the glory of your god.
What a better way to worship him than creating a masterpiece ?
Several attempts, several failures.
You couldn't find the way to bring this glorious edifice to life.

That's when you made a baleful choice.
He brought to you designs imbued with magic.
He brought to you perfection, the price was your soul.

"What a great opportunity ! " you thought, "this settles everything."
He then left, waiting patiently for you to repay him.

Eventually you finished your work, the greatest you've ever made.
But remorse, my friend, is something you can't do without.
So to outsmart the devil, you chose to be buried under these walls you've created.

He's tricked but so are you cause your soul will dwell here for all eternity.
