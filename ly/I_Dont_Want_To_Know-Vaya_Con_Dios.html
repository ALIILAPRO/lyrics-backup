		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You've seen him on the street today
Heading for some sleaze cafe
He wasn't alone
He wasn't alone
Some beauty hung onto his arm
I shouldn't need to be alarmed
He's done it before
He's done it before
Where and how?
I don't want to know

You think she's one of his old flames
Some firey-looking kind of dame
You found her dull but just the same
She stole the show
I don't want to know

You've seen him on the downtown side
Drinking hard and acting wild
He was not alone
Not on his own
You say he looked a sorry sight
You know he's had another fight
He's done it before
Yes, he's done it before
Where and how?
I don't want to know

A smile breaks on your poker face
Tells me you're gonna throw the Ace of Spades
Drop it, and watch me fall on evil days
And let me go
I don't want to know

Why don't I try to understand
He's just as weak as any other man
He'll come back to me in the end
Isn't that so?
I don't want to know
