		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Back off
I came to play with my hacksaw
Bash in your brain with my mask off
Yea try to pray for the last time
Lame and you mad but you hate cuz your cash wrong
I don't want love, I want matte Glocks
I'll eat ya heart like it's bath salts
I'll leave his lung on the asphalt
I'll leave your tongue in a glass jar
Murder with a black SCAR
He don't wanna dump
What the fuck, is it that hard?
He don't wanna buck
He respond with a sad bar
Nigga shoulda ducked but he run like a track star
I came to play with my hacksaw
I don't want pain, I want matte Glocks
I'll eat ya heart like it's bath salts
I'll leave his lung on the asphalt
Now I just be sippin', sippin', sippin' slow on the blood I collect from you fuckers
And I could be vicious, witness never told of the souls that I left in my dungeon
Now cuz of my pigment I been predisposed to unload and attack in abundance
But that's just the shit they said, I go and murder cuz simply the fact that I love it
But it's back to the subject
Stacking bodies by the dozen
Whippin' Audis outta budget
Godly while I'm thumpin'
You would probly caught a couple
Grippin' probly why I'm fucked and I don't plan on stoppin'
She do molly while we fuckin'
Creepin' I might grab a snub I caught him out in public
Beam, he saw it 'fore it snuffed him
He was talking like he tough and now he not so lucky
Back off
I came to play with my hacksaw
Bash in your brain with my mask off
Yea try to pray for the last time
Lame and you mad but you hate cuz your cash wrong
I don't want love, I want matte Glocks
I'll eat ya heart like it's bath salts
I'll leave his lung on the asphalt
I'll leave your tongue in a glass jar
Murder with a black SCAR
He don't wanna dump
What the fuck, is it that hard?
He don't wanna buck
He respond with a sad bar
Nigga shoulda ducked but he run like a track star
I came to play with my hacksaw
I don't want pain, I want matte Glocks
I'll eat ya heart like it's bath salts
I'll leave his lung on the asphalt
I came to play with my hacksaw
I don't want pain, I want matte Glocks
I'll eat ya heart like it's bath salts
I'll leave his lung on the asphalt
I came to play with my hacksaw
I don't want pain, I want matte Glocks
I'll eat ya heart like it's bath salts
I'll leave his lung on the asphalt
