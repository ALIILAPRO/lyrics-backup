		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Kilometers from nowhere on a scented avenue 
Lined with poppy girls. 
I didn't stop, stop to say hello. 
Curious vendors - waving bric-a-brac 
Looked me over 
Thought it best, best that I should go. 
Don't wake me: I'm falling. 
Slow spiral into morning. 

I waited tables - I was tipped in roubles. 
Wine to water 
Was the best that I could do. 
Wild office parties split the silence. 
Loaves and fishes at an empty table laid for two. 
Don't wake me: I'm falling. 
Slow spiral into morning. 
Who's out there? Can't hear you. 
Ears covered - early warning. 
Alarm bells ringing. 
Time to make my peace with the dreary day. 
Spiral, spiral, spiral.

Down the spiral, spinning madly. 
Gathering momentum 
On a disneyesque adventure ride. 
I fly in colours from richer palettes. 
Famous artists running scared as worlds as worlds collide.

Don't wake me: I'm falling. 
Slow spiral into morning. 
Who's out there? Can't hear you. 
Ears covered - early warning. 
Alarm bells ringing. 
Time to make my peace with the dreary day.
Spiral, spiral, spiral.
