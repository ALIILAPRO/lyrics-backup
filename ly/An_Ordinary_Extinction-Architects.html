		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do you feel at home in limbo?
Hiding a broken vow
A phantom at the window

Can you swallow the shame?
Has your courage been burnt out, faded away?
There won't be a saviour in sight, but it's okay
('Cause we're comfortable)

We're stood at the edge of the world
Seize the snakes (the snakes)
They're living a lie, blinded by a candle
They're saying goodbye
We're stood at the edge of the world

When the clock runs down to zero
We'll stand up and take a bow
So quick to play the hero

Are you fanning the flames?
Are you torching the lighthouse?
Stood in the way
Complicity burning so bright, yet we delay
(Are you culpable?)

Seize the snakes (the snakes)
They're living a lie, blinded by a candle
They're saying goodbye
We're stood at the edge of the world
Drag the lake (the lake)
When the water runs dry, we'll be slaves to the anchor
The Devil may cry
We're stood at the edge of the world

We're stood at the edge of the world

Nothing is holy
We all take the blame
Crumbling slowly
The cliff face belongs to the ocean
So run for your life

Do you remember the tip of the spear?
The edge of the knife?
We're freshly dismembered
But won't shed a tear
So run for your life

We're stood at the edge of the world
Seize the snakes (the snakes)
They're living a lie, blinded by a candle
They're saying goodbye
We're stood at the edge of the world

Drag the lake (the lake)
When the water runs dry, we'll be slaves to the anchor
The Devil may cry
We're fighting to stay alive
How can we all survive?
No second chances
We're stood at the edge of the world

We're stood at the edge of the world, yeah
We're fighting to stay alive
