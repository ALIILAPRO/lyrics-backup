		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Watching the surfers on the Birling Gap
A few times I nearly packed up my bag
You said "Baby please don't leave
There is so much we've left to see
Stay with me"

I said I would marry you
If I could get a passport to
Work in the land of riches
Live our lives through pictures
Bathing in the sea
Searching for fish while you're searching for me

You pressed your hands against the darkest spaces of my skin
Tell me my body has been so beautifully lived in
I almost fell apart when you looked straight at my heart
And said "Baby, swim"

We went to your mother's house
Driving through The Deep South
Mountains and red wine
The best I've tasted in my life
You said "Stay with me"

You pressed your hands against the darkest spaces of my skin
Tell me my body has been so beautifully lived in
I almost fell apart, when you looked straight at my heart
And said baby, swim

You said baby, we're just bathing
You said baby, we're just bathing
You said baby, we're just bathing

Watching the surfers on the Birling Gap
A few times I nearly packed up my bags
You said "Baby please don't leave
Stay with me"
