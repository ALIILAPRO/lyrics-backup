		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Watch it, girl
Don't ever tell me lies
I said watch it, baby
You and I been running out of time
What you may never know is more than you will see
And I can part the ocean, come and see 'bout me

If I told you all of my secrets 
Baby girl, would you look in my eyes and feel deceived?
Well I can't let you leave 
I told you far too much, now you gotta stick with me (yeah, with me)

Run out, running out of time
Run out, running out of time with me

Stay up with me
Stay up and watch the sun
Baby, lay up with me
Stay up with me
You been on my mind
And lately it feels like it ain't much time left
Run your lips into mine
Stronger when we unite

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh 
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh

Run out, running out of time
Run out, running out of time with me

Stay up with me
Stay up and watch the sun
Baby, lay up with me
Stay up with me
You been on my mind
And lately it feels like it ain't much time left
Run your lips into mine
Stronger when we unite
Ooh-ooh-ooh

Run out, running out of time
Run out, running out of time with me
Run out, running out of time
Run out, running out of time with me
