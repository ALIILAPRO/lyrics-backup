		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Seven days
Since you went and found some space
I told myself, "I'm doing great"
And I'm not holding on
So don't worry 'bout me
I can keep myself busy
At least that's how I make it seem
Until the day is done

Morning turns to evenin'
Haven't even thought about you leavin'
Swear to God, I almost got this feelin' off my mind

But every time the lights go out
I see you there when you're not around
Stuck in my head
And I know you're gone
But I'll still hold onto the ghost of you, oh, oh
Every time I'm in the dark
I feel you there like a shock to my heart
Back from the dead
Oh, I know you're gone
But I'll still hold on to the ghost of you
Ghost of you

I can't face
Somebody taking you for drinks and dates
'Cause you know I wonder
You know I wonder if it feels the same, the same

Morning turns to evenin'
Haven't even thought about you leavin'
Swear to God, I almost got this feelin' off my mind

But every time the lights go out
I see you there when you're not around
Stuck in my head
And I know you're gone
But I'll still hold onto the ghost of you, oh, oh
Every time I'm in the dark
I feel you there like a shock to my heart
Back from the dead
Oh, I know you're gone
But I'll still hold on to the ghost of you
Ghost of you

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh
Yeah, yeah
Oh, I know you're gone
But I'll still hold on to the ghost of you
Ghost of you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
