		  Makeshift Patriot
The Flag Shop Is Out Of Stock 
Hang Myself...Half Mast 

Makeshift Patriot 
The Flag Shop is Out of Stock 
I hang myself...Via live telecast. 

Coming live from my own funeral...the beautiful weather offered a nice shine, 
Which is suitable for a full view of a forever altered skyline. 
It's times like these I freestyle biased opinions every other sentence. 
My journalistic ethics slip when I pass them off as objective. 
"Don't gimme that ethical @#%$." 
I've got exclusive, explicit images to present to impressionable American kids, 
And it's time to show this world how big our edifice is! 

That's exactly what they attacked when a typically dark skinned Disney villain 
Used civilians against civilians and charged the Trojan horses into our buildings. 
Using commercial aviation as instruments of destruction, 
Pregnant women couldn't protect their children. Wheelchairs were stairway obstructions. 
Now I have to back petal...from the shower of glass and metal, 
Wondering how after it settles we'll find who provided power to radical rebels. 
The Melting Pot seems to be calling the kettle black when it boils over, 
But only on our own soil so the little boy holds a toy soldier... 
And waits for the suit and tie to come home. We won't wait till he's older, 
Before we destroy hopes for a colder war to end. "Now get a close up of his head..." 

Makeshift Patriot 
The Flag Shop Is Out Of Stock 
Hang Myself...Half Mast 

Makeshift Patriot 
The Flag Shop is Out of Stock 
I hang myself while the stock markets crash 

The city is covered in inches of muck 
I see some other pictures of victims are up 
Grieving mothers are thinking their children are stuck 
Leaping lovers are making decisions to jump 
While holding hands...to escape the brutal heat. Sometimes in groups of the three. 
The fall out goes far beyond the toxic cloud where people look like debris. 
But all they saw after all was said...beyond the talking heads 
Was bloody dust with legs looking like the walking dead calling for meds. 
Hospitals are overwhelmed. volunteers need to go the hell home. 
Moments of silence for fire fighters were interrupted by cell phones. 
Who's going to make that call to increase an unknown death toll? 
It's the one we rally behind. He's got a megaphone...and he's promising to make heads roll, 
So we cheer him on, but es pestos is affecting our breath control. 
The less we know...the more they fabricate...the easier it is to sell souls 
An addictive 24 hour candle light vigil in TVs. 
Freedom WILL be defended...at the cost of civil liberties. 
Viewers are glued to television screens. Stuck...'cause lots of things seem too sick. 
I use opportunities to pluck heart strings for theme music. 

I'll show you which culture to pump your fist at and what foot is right to kiss. 
We don't know who the culprit is yet...but he looks like this. 
We know who the heroes are. Not the xenophobes who act hard, 
"We taught that dog to squat. How dare he do that shit in our own back yard!" 

They happened to scar our financial state and char our landscape. 
Can you count how many times so far I ran back this same damn tape? 
While a camera man creates news and shoves it down our throats on the West Bank, 
With a 10 second clip put on constant loop to provoke US angst. 

So get your tanks and load your guns and hold your sons in a family huddle, 
Because even if we win this tug of war and even the score...humanity struggles. 
There's a desperate need of blood for what's been uncovered under the rubble, 
Some of them dug for answers in the mess...but the rest were looking for trouble. 

Makeshift Patriot 
The Flag Shop Is Out Of Stock 
Hang Myself...Half Mast 

Makeshift Patriot 
The Flag Shop is Out of Stock 
I hang myself. 
Don't waive your rights with your flags.
