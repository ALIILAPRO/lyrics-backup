		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  New York, it don't feel the same without you
'Cause everything's a different shade of blue
Waiting for the train in Penn Station
Hoping that I might fall into you

I keep holding on to something expired
Said, "I love you forever and I'm not a liar," hmm

But I can't play God with you in bed
I tried to make you stay a thousand times
So I try to find you in different guys
But they ain't you, they ain't you
I can't play God with you and I
How can I be mad when you ain't mine?
So I try to find you in different guys
But they ain't you, wish it was you

I got a message saved and I might send it
But I don't think that I'm brave enough
So I'll save it my notes and I'll pretend that
I'll show it to you when we're meeting up, mhm

I keep holding on to something expired
Hmm, hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm
You're running through my mind and now I'm too tired, mhm

But I can't play God with you and I
I tried to make you stay a thousand times
So I try to find you in different guys
But they ain't you, they ain't you
I can't play God with you and I
How can I be mad when you ain't mine?
So I try to find you in different guys
But they ain't you, I wish it was you

I'm scared that I'll never feel those feelings again
'Cause I can't play God with you and I
I tried to make you stay a thousand times
So I try to find you in different guys
But they ain't you, I wish it was you
