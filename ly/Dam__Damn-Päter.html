		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Got a little weekend project planned
Gonna build a wall like the tyrants can
Gonna build it tall and iron brand
Baby if it all goes down as planned
As planned, as planned
I’ll have all my demons stuck behind a dam
Damn
On the other side is all I am
Man
I hope the sticks are strong, the structure sound
Sounds
Like in one instance I could go way down, down, down
Way down, down, down, haha
Got a team of builders gathered round
Got a little sunshine in my town
Got a lot of time since shit went down
I ain’t gonna take no chances now
Not now, not now
All my demons held behind a dam
Damn
On the other side is all I am
Man
I hope the sticks are strong, the structure sound
Sounds
Like in one instance I’ll most likely drown, drown, drown
Way down, down, down
Way down, down, down
Way down, down, down
Way down, down, down
Way down, down
Oh my God, oh my God
I think I found myself ‘bout 30 yards
Out from that damn old dirty spot
But you always want what you don’t got
I said oh my God, oh my God
I think I found myself ‘bout 30 yards
Out from that damn old dirty spot
But you always want what you don’t got
Had the right of mind to jump in quick
I don’t got a choice to wait and sit
Could’ve built a dam or dug a pit
Baby and if all the pieces fit
They fit, they fit
I’ll have all my demons held behind a dam
Damn
On the other side is all I am
Man
I hope the sticks are strong, the structure sound
Sounds
Like in one tremor you’ll most likely drown, drown, drown
Way down, down, down
Down, down, down
Way down, down, down
Damn
