		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh uh oh uh yea (Neptunes, Ray J, where you at)
I don't think y'all ready for this one
Queen Bee knockout collabo'
And if ya don't know, now ya know

Workin' all day (and now it's on)
Pull up and don't pay (when the line is long)
Girls in the club (you wanna f)
Ice grillin' these thugs (y'all wanna thump?)
Is it 'cause of my shine (major ice)
I'm talkin' about blind ya (like Vegas lights)
Never on the scene (without my team)
Cali sticky green (know what I mean)

It's on and poppin'
The DJ's rockin'
Chickens is watchin'
It's on tonight
You had a long day, yo
Buy the champ by the caseload
Pockets full of pesos
It's on tonight

Oh wait a minute (oh wait a minute)
Oh wait a minute (oh wait a minute hey hey)
Girl wait a minute
Oh wait a minute (oh wait a minute)
Oh wait a minute (oh wait a minute hey hey)
Yo, if y'all know the words, say it with me (wait a minute)

I been workin all day (and now it's on)
Pull up and don't pay (when the line is long)
Girls in the club (you wanna f)
Ice grillin' these thugs (y'all wanna thump?)
Is it 'cause of my shine (major ice)
I'm talkin' about blind ya (like Vegas lights)
Never on the scene (without my team)
Cali sticky green (know what I mean)

So much you go through
Only problems know you
Let's party like we supposed to
It's on tonight
There's not a righter way
You've had a tired day
Let's party the night away
It's on tonight

Oh wait a minute (oh wait a minute)
Oh wait a minute (oh wait a minute, hey, hey)
Girl wait a minute
Oh wait a minute (oh wait a minute)
Oh wait a minute (oh wait a minute, hey,hey)

(Wait a minute) Blaow! Tadow! Watch out now, uh-huh
It's the little' one and I'm not Bow Wow
Got trees roll it up, you a G, throw it up
Nigga slipped me his number on the low, I tore it up
Oh wait a minute they playin' my shit, slow it up
What, you outta Cris'? Fuck it, mo' it up
Y'all just rookies, poppin' on the scene
Be careful how y'all talk 'cause we pop them things
You gon' see us on the TV, rappin' and actin'
Yup, uh-huh, look a little closer
Yeah, that's us in the millennium Testarossa
People takin' pictures, blowin' our cover
Paparazzi gonna get you one way or another
"Hey wait a minute ain't that Brandy's brother?"
Straight from the Eastside, and that's how I ride
Here's another one, Ray J, tell 'em where you from

I'm from the land of women
Sunny days, chrome spinnin'
Juice and ginin'
It's on tonight
If you feel you're another one
Representin' where you from
Sex, you're gettin' some
It's on tonight

Oh wait a minute (oh wait a minute)
Oh wait a minute (oh wait a minute hey hey)
Girl wait a minute
Oh wait a minute (oh wait a minute)
Oh wait a minute (oh wait a minute hey hey)
Wait a minute
Oh wait a minute
Oh wait a minute
Wait a minute
Oh wait a minute
Oh wait a minute, hey hey
