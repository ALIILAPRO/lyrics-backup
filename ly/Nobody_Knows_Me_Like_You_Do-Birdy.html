		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Last night was the third time I've watched you leave
And though it's been five months, it was like no time had been
Fought my tears in the dark as you drove away from me
'Cause nobody knows me like you do

You arrived in the evening light outside on the green
And I swore I'd be fine 'til I realized that you still loved me
To see you standing there I just felt relief
'Cause nobody knows me like you do

And dark are my days now that I face them on my own
So long are the nights now that I'm sleeping here alone
And after all of this time it's still just as hard to see you go
'Cause nobody knows me
Nobody knows me like you do

Last night your eyes were bright again like when we first met
You tried to hide it but I knew right then you'd found somebody else
Babe, I know you too well, you forget
That nobody knows you like I do

You're in my dreams and for a while it seems we're unbroken
If I could, I'd never leave, never let my eyes open

And I know that I decided we had different lives to lead
Not sure what it was I thought I'd find once I was free
But without you beside me all I can see
Is that nobody knows me like you do

And dark are my days now that I face them on my own
So long are the nights now that I'm sleeping here alone
And after all of this time it still breaks my heart to see you go
'Cause nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me like you do
