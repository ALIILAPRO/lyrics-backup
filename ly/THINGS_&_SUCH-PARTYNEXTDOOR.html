		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Gin got me feeling real honest
Now that me and shawty platonic
Yeah
Fuck
(Mm-mm, mm, mm-mm)
Shout to G. Ry and Neenyo
Yeah

Smoked just a little bit
Drank just a little bit
He don't drink like he used to (used to)
He don't think like he used to (used to)
Life taught you new things (new things)
Now, you wanna do things
The hills keep track of your new balance
Since you lost him, you got a new balance
I can't say I'd do better, no, no, no
But I'll act like I know, know, know better (no, no, no)
I can't say that I'd do better
But I can't say I never knew better, no, no, no, no (no, no)
If I ever had you (if I ever had you)
Think I coulda had you (I thank God I had you)
All your exes mad too
'Cause somehow, I just bagged you
Crushing girl, I'm glad to (yeah)
Fuck you 'til you cum, girl, I'm glad to (yeah)
Yeah, you know I had to (yeah, you know)
Mm, yeah-yeah (yeah, you know it)
Walking down your steps with no bra or panties (yeah, you grown)
Mm, girl, you know better, ask your auntie
She said, "Who's that nigga?" "He's a R&B singer"
"Who's that nigga, what's his intention?"
You say, "He's a good nigga, he's a good nigga, he's a hood nigga"
No, no, no, no, no (no, no, no)
We'd act like we don't know, know, know, know (know, yeah)
No ifs, no ands, no buts, no whatsoever (ah-ah, ah-ah)
We can't say we never knew better
No, no, no, no, no
But I still act like I don't know
Like it's whatever
But I can't promise I'll do better (hey, no, no, no)
No, but I know
Better (I know you need better)
But I cannot promise (better)
Every nigga want a bad bitch (yeah)
Everyone I want at Magic
Throwin' ones at mad bad bitches
Dirty money, dirty habits (ooh, ooh)
Fuck the Uber, I'ma cab it
Calling me to say you want this
You lonely at home, thinking mad shit
Fuck-fuck-fuck me, I know you a savage
Yeah, mm
Peelin' back the layers like a motherfuckin' cabbage
Fiendin'
Girl, don't keep no secrets from me (yeah)
Who did you love that I gotta shake hands with?
Who did you love that I gotta make plans with?
If we not standing, it's not a one-night stand and
I'm not romantic, I'm not with the antics
No, no, no, no, no, no (no, no)
Damn, I wish I took things slower
Yeah, yeah

Both knew better
Glow up
Thank God that I'm poured up, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, 'cause she knew better
Mm, vodka and you make me crazy
Gin and you make me crazy
Ayy, PX
