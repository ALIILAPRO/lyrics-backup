		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They'll never thank me for opening doors
But they ain't even thank Jesus when he died on the cross
'Cause your spirit is ungrateful
Bitches is so hateful, I remain a staple
My career's been the Pinkprint, when I retire, tell 'em think pink
Pink Friday is the imprint and these bitches basic, instinct
Oh shit, my commercial's on
Did I really body bitches with commercial songs?
Did I really prophecy every thing I do?
But before I continue, let me thank my crew
So that was Young Wayne, Mack Maine, Baby and Slim came
Tezz and EI told me it wouldn't be in vain
'Cause prior to me signing I could've went insane
And even now I think, "do I really want this fame?"
Let me get up and go, seven hundred to go overseas for a show
Everybody get quiet when I'm starting the show
Man, I'm birthing these artists and I'm starting to show

I feel free, I feel freedom
Why they mad? You should see them
Burn a L 'cause it's crazy in here
Crazy in here, crazy in here

I feel free, I feel freedom (know it's crazy, know it's crazy)
Why they mad? You should see them (know it's crazy, know it's crazy)
Burn a L 'cause it's crazy in here (know it's crazy, know it's crazy)
Crazy in here, crazy in here (know it's crazy, know it's crazy)

Who I wanna work with? Nobody
Ninety-nine percent of them is nobody
Bitches acting like they killing shit, okay
When I check these bitches guns, no bodies
These niggas is fake fucks and opportunists
Niggas spend they last dime to say the copped the soonest
Why these niggas going broke to get your approval?
Pretty soon, they'll be back up on them ramen noodles
B-B-B-bible, Queen is the title
And if you are my rival, then that means you're suicidal
And if you in the club then it's the Young Money recital
I'm just that vital, I'm busy, never idle
I'm your idol, I'm your idol, I'm your motherfuckin' idol
Pink Friday at Macy's, thongs and some pasties
(Yo, what other female rapper perfume in here?)
('Cause I must've missed it)
Twelve milli to kick my feet up, get ready, this is The Re-Up

I feel free, I feel freedom
Why they mad? You should see them
Burn a L cause it's crazy in here
Crazy in here, crazy in here

I feel free, I feel freedom (know it's crazy, know it's crazy)
Why they mad? You should see them (know it's crazy, know it's crazy)
Burn a L 'cause it's crazy in here (know it's crazy, know it's crazy)
Crazy in here, crazy in here (know it's crazy, know it's crazy)

Mirror, mirror, won't you realize? I just have to decide
What you hiding from? What you hiding from?

Mirror, mirror, won't you realize? I just have to decide
What you hiding from? What you hiding from? Hiding, baby

Would you, would you give your
Would you, would you give your
Would you, would you give your all for you?

Would you, would you give your
Would you, would you give your
Would you, would you give your all for you?

I feel free, I feel freedom (freedom)
Why they mad? You should see them (why you mad?)
Burn a L 'cause it's crazy in here (burn an L, crazy)
Crazy in here, crazy in here

I feel free, I feel freedom (feel free, oh)
Why they mad? You should see them (why they mad? Hey)
Burn a L 'cause it's crazy in here ('cause it's crazy, 'cause it's crazy)
Crazy in here, crazy in here (in here, yeah, it's crazy in here)
