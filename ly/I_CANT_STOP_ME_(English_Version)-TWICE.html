		  (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

I'm hearing all the alarms ring-a-ling
They go off every time that we're face to face
Why is it so hard to resist
Temptation sweet as honey, I know it's too late
I feel it deep inside
I'm gonna lose the fight
Eventually, I know that I'll be crossing the line
I try warning myself
'Cause I'm in need of help
Can't hold me back, already standing right at the edge
Out of control

Help, oh I been caught under the spot, spot, spotlight
I wanna cave into the dark side calling to me
The ending's obvious, I know it's not right
I can't stop me, can't stop me (no woah, woah)
You pull me over to the red, red, red line
I can't escape it you're my weakness and you're my vice
In the shadows, you're the only highlight
I can't stop me, can't stop me (no woah, woah)

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I can't stop me, can't stop me

You're my forbidden fruit (ya, ya)
Pretend that there's no rules (ah-ah)
I'm turning all the lights off (tonight)
And spiralling into the abyss, losing myself (ya, ya)
There ain't no turning back
Addicted to the feeling like I'm caught in a trance (in a trance)

It's like you flip a switch
Your power over me
Is limitless and now all I can do is give in
Out of control (ooh, yeah)

Oh I been caught under the spot, spot, spotlight
I wanna cave into the dark side calling to me
The ending's obvious, I know it's not right
I can't stop me, can't stop me (no woah, woah)
You pull me over to the red, red, red line (red line)
I can't escape it you're my weakness and you're my vice
In the shadows, you're the only highlight (I can't stop me)
I can't stop me, can't stop me (no woah, woah)

Risky, risky, why you test me?
This is an emergency
Help me, help me, somebody stop me
'Cause I know I can't stop me
Getting closer and closer
When I know I'm in danger
Need to get away from ya
You're like the devil on my shoulder

What's going on inside (ah-ah)
There's a war I'm trying to fight (ooh-ooh, ah-ah)
Since it opened my eyes
I can't stop me, can't stop me, can't stop me (oh, oh, oh)

Oh I been caught under the spot, spot, spotlight
I wanna cave into the dark side calling to me
The ending's obvious, I know it's not right
I can't stop me, can't stop me (no woah, woah)
You pull me over to the red, red, red line (whoa, whoa)
I can't escape it you're my weakness and you're my vice (whoa, whoa)
In the shadows, you're the only highlight
I can't stop me, can't stop me (no, whoa, whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (ah)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (ooh)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I can't stop me, can't stop me (no woah, woah)

(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
