		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The game changed
You changed the game
The game changed
You changed the game

Keep going, you're not alone
I'm taking you back, I'm taking you home
You need to know you're not on your own
You made the love, I'm keeping it going

Keep moving, keep it up
Keep it together, won't you though?
Keep sliding, tippity toes
Everyone knows that I want your body

I thought I knew the way
'Cause you're a game changer
I thought I knew the way
'Cause you're a game changer

Give me the devil, debauchery, pretty
This is about to get realer
You want me to talk to the man
And negotiate getting it back to the needle
Hope you can stick up for me, am I speaking Chinese?
Oh my God, I'm a woman that needs to

Hit we're going under control
And now is the time to let you know that
That you're a game changer
Hit we're going under control
And now is the time to let you know that

Skip it 'til you be the one for me
I'll be the one for you, why don't you love me forever?
Oops, you got me going again
I ain't gonna stop 'til we get it together

(Keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on)
(I'm gon' keep on)
(Keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on)
(I won't keep on)
Yes, you changed the game again
Invented new ways to drive me crazy
(Keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on)
(I'm gon' keep on)
I could try to raise my game
At the end of the day, you always slay me
(Keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on)
(I'm gon' keep on)
Suddenly, the game has changed
And you cut the reigns and I'm in trouble
(Keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on)
(I'm gon' keep on)
If she rose again, I mean
I won't make a scene while you're taking over

The game changed
I changed the game
You're the game changer
Oh, my love
You changed the game
I'm the game changer
Oh, my love
I changed the game

I thought I knew the way
