		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lean back half-rolled cigarette
Not speaking at all
There's no one else out here
It's clear I waited too long

I guess attention spans are lessening
It's a lesson in humans using machines
To show their feelings
(Who, who, who, who)

Where did you go?
I can't wait more hours, I'm ever so low
Longing for you to please be an adult
And use your mouth
In ways that I can't right now
'Cause I'm choking up
I'm crushing, crushing

I'll loosen up, it's not like it meant a lot
We were drunk once, it's not like we were some dream
Combination, we were made as friends (I'm crushing)

I guess attention spans are lessening
It's a lesson in humans using machines (Crushing)
To show their feelings
(Who, who, who, who)

All adventures, they were in my head
I created life for them
Sleepless wonder in the eyes
I lift myself up, now I don't get hurt
I'm crushing (Who, who, who, who)
Crushing (Who, who, who, who)
I'm crushing

I guess attention spans are lessening
It's a lesson in humans using machines (Crushing)
To show their feelings
(Who, who, who, who, I'm crushing)

I guess attention spans are lessening
It's a lesson in humans using machines (Crushing)
To show their feelings
(Who, who, who, who)
