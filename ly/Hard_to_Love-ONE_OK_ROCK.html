		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I was just a kid
I couldn't wait 'til I grew up
Tried walking in your shoes
But couldn't even tie them up
No matter how big and tall I grew
I was always looking up to you

You showed me that I was just a diamond in the rough
You helped me to grow into the man that I've become
We've been down, we've been up
I hope I've made you proud enough
You make it look easy even when I'm hard to love

Ooh, ooh, ooh

When I dropped out of school
You told me that my time was up
I was a rebel with a cause
Just didn't know quite what it was
So I got a job that barely paid
You said you did the same thing at my age

You showed me that I was just a diamond in the rough
You helped me to grow into the man that I've become
We've been down, we've been up
I hope I've made you proud enough
You make it look easy even when I'm hard to love
We've been down, we've been up
I hope I've made you proud enough
You make it look easy even when I'm hard to love

Ooh, ooh, ooh

Even when I'm hard to love
