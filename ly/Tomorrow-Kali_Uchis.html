		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Today is the day I'll learn that I believe in miracles
I can feel the world opening up, I think I broke the curse
Now I won't grab you by the arm when you go
No one can give me what I want
Yeah, I know

Let's get out of this hopeless town
Nobody can stop us now
And time's on our side
While our hearts stay young
Let's think about it tomorrow

Daddy said he needed money
So he put her on the street (street)
She had just turned thirteen
Got a family to feed (feed)
Yeah we grew up in a hurry (that's when she met me)
Daddy got a little worried (American dream)

Come on let's go, we'll think about it tomorrow
Come on let's go, we'll think about it tomorrow

Let's get out of this hopeless town
Nobody can stop us now
And time's on our side
While our hearts are young
Let's think about it tomorrow

Let's get out of this hopeless town
Nobody can stop us now
And time's on our side
While our hearts are young
Let's think about it tomorrow

Las horas se me hacen siglos aqu√≠
Dame un beso que me dure una eternidad (come on let's go) 
Porque nunca voy a regresar, nunca (come on let's go)
Te invitio si quieres y como un cometa en el cielo (come on let's go) 
Nos quemaremos juntos
Nos quemaremos juntos
