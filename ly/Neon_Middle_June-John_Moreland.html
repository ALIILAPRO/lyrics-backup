		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Deep in the city wild, stray dogs in the sky
Drawing perfect circles with your helicopter eye
Well I got eyes for no one, no one else but you
Below the epidermis with the epidemic blues

When you were a child, your faith was automatic
Asleep in steady traffic, navigating western static
And what if who I am is who I used to be
Darling, you know that's the thought that paralyzes me

Neon middle June
Coloring the room
Hold me close
The January night is coming soon

Love is complicated, like any living thing
You left me buzzing with your sympathetic ring
And time continues working, with an unrelenting hand
Darling, draw the curtain, there's so much to understand

Neon middle June
Coloring the room
Hold me close
The January night is coming soon

Empty as a tomb
Hold me close
The January night is coming soon
