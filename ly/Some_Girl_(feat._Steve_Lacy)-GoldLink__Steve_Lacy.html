		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Pretty woman, pretty girl, pretty thighs
Older black woman, had me feeling like I'm 35
Get it girl, hit her with the phrase
She lookin' my way
Hit her both ways
As a main nigga and a sidekick

I met her in the summer, started with a kiss
Then I fucked her so good that I had to flood her wrist
Two days in and I wanna have a kid
Then she told me she belong to a city and her boy
Wear a wig and a cig just to smoke away her tears
And I wanna learn about her fears
And touch her real
I think a love her can't nobody come before her
And no one above her
And I wrote this like a sucker singing

Touching for compatibility
Looking for the one that's right for me
Where do I go? Oh
Where do I find her? Oh

Touching for compatibility
Looking for the one that's right for me
Where do I go? Oh
Where do I find her? Oh

Pretty woman, pretty girly, pretty thighs
Older black woman, had me feeling like I'm 35
Get it girl, hit her with the phrase
She's looking my way
Hit her both ways
As her main nigga and a sidekick
Lil rider, fuck me like a side chick
She down like a Northface with some visors
Bank credit card scamming for deposits
And when I do do my thing she never stop me
She love to love me, loving me is like a hobby
Loving her dough hear my nigga Cho I told him hit the fo
She never let a nigga get too close
If I die, she'll probably marry me and love my ghost
So I had to work at get the ghost!
Had to work harder so the bitches see the ghost
For my baby riding in it and my baby riding tinted
And I only fuck with you because it got you in it get it

Touching for compatibility
Looking for the one that's right for me
Where do I go? Oh
Where do I find her? Oh

Touching for compatibility
Looking for the one that's right for me
Where do I go? Oh
Where do I find her? Oh

I don't know why I care about you, care about you
I dont want to motherfuckin care about you, care about you

I'mma die but you remember the god
Selling grams the size of game cube memory cards
Yeah yeah I got a problem with you ex and he know
That if he hit your phone again I gotta shoot with the fo
If I hit a nigga crazy leave his brains on the floor
Dust a year and keep it moving like I'm hitting a ho
Anyway just know I love you more and more and it shows
And I promise baby girl I'll probably never let go, so sing

Touching for compatibility
Looking for the one that's right for me
Where do I go? Oh
Where do I find her? Oh

Touching for compatibility
Looking for the one that's right for me
Where do I go? Oh
Where do I find her? Oh

I just want you girl
Want to be your man
Cause I need you girl
I need you girl

Because I need your love
Yeah
Cause I need it now
Come on girl

When we go out, when we go out, in circles
