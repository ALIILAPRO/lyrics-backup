		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wanna jump the fence and wash my face in the creek
But I'm black myself
I wanna sweep that gal right off her feet
But I'm black myself
I'm tired of walkin' 'round with no shoes on
'Cause I'm black myself
And your precious God ain't gonna bless me
'Cause I'm black myself

Is you washed in the blood of your chattel?
'Cause the lamb's rotted away
When they stopped shipping work horses
They bred their own anyway, ooh hoo
Black Myself

I don't pass the test of the paper bag
'Cause I'm black myself
I pick the banjo up and they sneer at me
'Cause I'm black myself
You better lock your doors when I walk by
'Cause I'm black myself
You look me in my eyes but you don't see me
'Cause I'm black myself

Is you washed in the blood of your chattel?
'Cause the lamb's rotted away
When they stopped shipping work horses
They bred their own anyway, ooh hoo
Black Myself
Black Myself

I don't creep around, I stand proud and free
'Cause I'm black myself
I go anywhere that I wanna go
'Cause I'm black myself (black myself)
And I'm surrounded by many lovin' arms 
'Cause I'm black myself (black myself)
And I'll stand my ground and smile in your face
'Cause I'm black myself

I washed away the blood and tears
I've been born brand new
There's no more work horses
But still some work to do, yeah
'Cause I'm black myself (black myself) Oh
'Cause I'm black myself (black myself)
'Cause I'm black myself, black myself, black myself, 
Black myself, black myself (black myself), black myself
'Black myself
'Cause I'm black my
Black my, black myself
