		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We been runnin' 'round covered in gas, playin' with matches, oh
We've been runnin' this thing, burnin' it down, down
Sweetly talkin' but you and I both know
Keep on runnin' it down, the world that we ignored

I don't have much but I give you love
I used to say that kind of stuff
Like a broken clock, stopped givin' you time
Now you're takin' your love to another guy (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Tell me what he gon' do? What he gon' do?
How he gonna make sweet love to you? (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
And mmm, if he hurts you, know I'm runnin' him down, runnin' him down (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

Don't worry 'bout, don't worry 'bout me
Don't worry 'bout, don't worry 'bout me

Been a few months since I called your phone
I ain't mad, but I'm movin' on
Yeah, I gotta new lil' thing in fact
Nothin' wrong, it's in the past

Don't worry 'bout, don't worry 'bout me
Don't worry 'bout, don't worry 'bout me

Shut you out, you know I tried
Said I got over you but I lied
Morning love and morning fights
I miss it all (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Said you went down to Corpus
I miss you in the doorway (ooh)
Stayin' up all night
Silly, silly me

Yeah
It wasn't just one time
Baby, I've been livin' with your lies too long
Callin' past midnight, having to pick you up on my way home
I don't mind if you get a little wild
I just ask that you be there for me
'Cause you had been slippin' for a while
And I needed to find someone to give me what I need

Don't worry 'bout, don't worry 'bout me (no, don't you worry about me)
(Don't worry 'bout me)
Don't worry 'bout, don't worry 'bout me

I've been runnin' from myself
But there's something different this time
Every other night, you got my mind runnin' wild

Take me on a slow ride
Park the car and stay inside
Can't forget your kisses, sweet
Remember how your body be
Always were the perfect fit
I know how you like it
Sip it down like moonshine
Hold you in the moonlight
No one sees me like you, babe
Let your tears roll down my face
I don't wanna go back
Girl, don't do him like that
Okay, then I have to leave
Don't worry 'bout me

Don't worry 'bout, don't worry 'bout me (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Don't worry 'bout, don't worry 'bout me (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Don't worry 'bout, don't worry 'bout me (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Don't worry 'bout, don't worry 'bout me
