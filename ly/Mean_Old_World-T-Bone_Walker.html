		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is a mean old world
Baby to live in by yourself
This is a mean old world
Baby to live in by yourself
Can't get the woman you love
Cause you know she's lovin someone else

Well I drink to keep from worryin
Baby and I smile to keep from cryin'
Yes I drink to keep from worryin
And you know I smile to keep from cryin
That's to keep the public from knowin
Just what I have on my mind
