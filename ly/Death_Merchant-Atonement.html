		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Kill the virgin and drink their blood
Master of torment and fear
Rape them as they scream and cry 
Blasphemer is here

Watch as how they die 
Scream your battlecry
Witching hour is near 
Impale them with a spear 

Death Merchant
Show no regret
Death Merchant 
Never forget 
Death Merchant
Kill every threat 
Death Merchant

When you see that the blade will come 
Screams is what i will hear 
March into my dark kingdom
As my servants sheer 

Watch as how they die 
Scream your battlecry
Witching hour is near 
Impale them with a spear 

Death Merchant
Show no regret
Death Merchant 
Never forget 
Death Merchant
Kill every threat 
Death Merchant 
 
Crushing with evil
And rapture this dark night
I'm the impaler
Of christ
People fear the omen
Now i will arise 
Then i shall send them
To die

Kill the virgin and drink their blood
Master of torment and fear
Rape them as they scream and cry 
Blasphemer is here

Watch as how they die 
Scream your battlecry
Witching hour is near 
Impale them with a spear 

Death Merchant
Show no regret
Death Merchant 
Never forget 
Death Merchant
Kill every threat 
Death Merchant
