		  (Look out, Veno)
(Veno gon' cook up, he mix the ingredients)
Oh
This is thug, nigga
I'm a thug nigga
I, this is thug, nigga, start over what I was 'bout to say
She a thug nigga lady

I don't give her no attention
It ain't you, it's me who I'm missing
It ain't you, it's me, who you kidding?
I don't settle no wishes (wishes)
I don't settle no wishes
Everything that I say be all vivid

Fuck these bitches, baby, evolve with me
Fuck these critics, baby, we all winning
Fuck these snakes, kill 'em, they all get it
Fuck you thought, the killers, they all with it, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'ma buy a hatchback, your love, this another sport
Baby, I'm a demon, she treat me just like I'm God
Flash out, I can't fault her for it
'Cause I know just what I be doing

I don't know what's gotten into you, see that you ain't been playing lately
Sticks on me riding in the coupe, you been knew I was playing safely
Been know that I was dangerous
Redeye, I'm a speed racer
On all occasions
Don't separate, we keep pace
Gettin' beside myself
These hoes ain't loving, they really be fucking with me
You the one that I know that I want, you the one that I really do need
Steady tryna come up off of me when I'll send a bitch overseas
I'll give her anything she please, bitch sister steady telling her scheme
Fuck is y'all? Y'all some nobodies
Fuck 'em all, girl, that's your body
Just make sure they tell nobody, I don't want nobody
Bitch can't see I'm full of pain, then me, she lose
She can't say I need her love, I say I'm through
'Cause I'm too real for this ho to not being real with me, oh, I
'Cause I'm too chill for this ho not be good to me, slime

I'ma buy a hatchback, your love, his another sport
Baby, I'm a demon, she treat me just like I'm God
Flash out, I fault her for it
'Cause I know just what I be doing
Fuck these bitches, baby, evolve with me
Fuck these critics, baby, we all winning
Fuck these snitches, kill 'em, they all get it
Fuck you thought, the killers, they all with it, yeah, yeah, yeah
