		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Summoned to the house of seance
To play the evil tarot cards
To find out what our fate will bring us
Before the war

Approaching now the hour of tiamat
Evil feelings in the air
The chosen wait impatiently
To find the rituals of power

Come out of the fire
Making the legacy known
Takes its toll at last
Now knowing when it strikes

The endless feuding shows its fate
The people are all shocked with fright
They know the end is coming near
It's time to fight

The revolution holds on strong
The armies have all met their match
Entire world up in arms
Destruction sees the spirits of anger

Come up from the gallows
Conjured my demons appear
Summoned to my cast,prey this deadly mass
Takin by the fire you fail

The world became a vast wasteland
Survivors turn to cannibals
Killing everything in sight
Warfare tonight

The armies are all closing in
The populations getting small
Feelings are as cold as ice
Survival names it's price

Starting to burn
The rape and violence grows high
A kingdom will rise
To rule with contempt

They will surprise
Kill and repent
The weakness in armies
"Won't die"

Leaving now the house of seance
Speculating destiny
Wonder if the cards were true
Will wait to find out and will wait to see
