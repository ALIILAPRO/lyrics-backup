		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah
She's a queen
The realest one anyone ever seen
And if it turns out I'm asleep
Then don't wake me up from this dream, I mean
If I'm keeping it real about 
How we came to be
I ain't do nothing to deserve you
But I keep you by any means because
Nobody's like you
Nobody can compare
To that shine inside of your eyes
And that way you play with your hair
It's the way you keep it one hundred
I trusted you with my heart
Coulda torn me to pieces
But had my back from the start
It makes me sick to imagine you
Without me by your side
No other person can give you
Half of this love I can provide
I'm passionate about your happiness
If I need to remind you
The rationale for my madness
I'm happy to tell you why cause
I see what you do
When you're not thinking
I'd be a damn fool
If I let you slip, yeah
If I let you slip out my grip
And I'm never trying to control you
But I can't take that risk
Not with this
Once in a lifetime
Sportscenter, primetime
Lifesaver, lifeline
Right place and right time
And I'm unworthy of your treasure
But I'm working under this pressure
To keep you here forever
Cause you're rock solid
Definition of loyal
Elegant, empathetic 
And enigmatically royal
You get on my damn nerves 
Bring my blood to a boil
But your heart is where my home is
Your soul exists in my soil
I got deep feelings for you
I'm not afraid to show it
We've been nurturing this love
We were searching for so let's grow it
We were meant to be together forever
We both know it
If this is my chance at being your lover
I'm not gon blow it cause
I see what you do
When you're not thinking
I'd be a damn fool
If I let you slip, yeah
If I let you slip out my grip
And I'm never trying to control you
But I can't take that risk
Not with this
Once in a lifetime
Sportscenter, primetime
Lifesaver, lifeline
Right place and right time
And, I'm unworthy of your treasure
But I'm working under this pressure
To keep you here forever cause
I see what you do 
When you're not thinking
I'd be a damn fool
If I let you slip
Yeah, slip out my grip
And I'm never trynna control you
But I can't take that risk
Not with this, no
Yeah, no I can't take that risk
Not when I see what you do 
When you're not thinking
I'd be a damn fool, cause
You got me straight up hooked
Fiending after your love
Sense of humor and empathy
Kindness, all the above
Girl, you the total package
You got every box checked
But it's the way you treat others 
That really got my respect
Don't get me wrong, girl you da bomb
And I couldn't settle for less
But it's that muscle in your chest
That truly got me possessed
I got your heart inside my hands
And I'm holding a firm grip
Nobody's like you, even close
So I'm never gon let you slip cause
I see what you do 
When you're not thinking
I'd be a damn fool
If I let you slip
Slip out my grip
And I'm never trying to control you
But I can't take that risk
Not with this, no
No I can't take that risk
Not when I see what you do
When you're not thinking
I'd be a damn fool if I let you slip
