		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We live though, I ain’t high but I still got high hopes
We live though, I ain’t high but I still got high hopes

We live though, I ain’t high but I still got high hopes 
The good vibes never show up on time though 
So I’m singing like Mariah with the high notes 

No pressure though. Flow extra cold
I’ve doing well eating my vegetables
And it seems like life feels so Exceptional (Exceptional)

Yeah (Exceptional). Yup
 
So sick like Ne-Yo was, I fly in the same shit like a hero does 
You got L’s yeah your team got zero w (dubs) 
I put y’all behind bars like a CO would 
I survived the flood, I found strength somehow to get out the mud 
So your little accolade don’t count to us 
Anything that you try won’t amount to us (yeah) 

No pressure though. Flow extra cold
I’ve doing well eating my vegetables
And it seems like life feels so Exceptional (Exceptional)

Yeah. And it seems like life feels so Exceptional (Exceptional) (Yup)
Yeah. And it seems like life feels so Exceptional
Yeah. And it seems like life feels so Exceptional (Yup)
Yeah. And it seems like life feels so Exceptional

I supply what's demanded, I found peace then expanded 
Peep I ain’t average 
Can’t be from this planet 
But I bleed through the bandage 
Weak but I’m avid 
Go to sleep with the baddest 
On my feet something drastic 
Weave to the basket 
Couple G’s and I’m laughing 
For the cheese I’m a magnet 
Peep the advantage 
I’m like so far ahead now 
I got butter for the bread now 
Chillin on a big cloud, and I won’t come down cause this is where I love and I live now 
Get what you give out 
Had to burn another bridge down 
It just is what it is now 
Life and a bitch know 
It’s a curse and a gift though 
It should be that simple (Yeah)

No pressure though, flow extra cold 
I’ve been doing well eating my vegetables 
And it seems like life feels so Exceptional. Exceptional 

No pressure though, flow extra cold 
I’ve been doing well eating my vegetables 
And it seems like life feels so Exceptional. Exceptional 

Exceptional 

Yeah. And it seems like life feels so Exceptional (Yup)
Yeah. And it seems like life feels so Exceptional 
Yeah. And it seems like life feels so Exceptional (Yup)
Yeah. And it seems like life feels so Exceptional 
Exceptional 
Yeah. And it seems like life feels so Exceptional 
Yeah. And it seems like life feels so Exceptional (Yup)
Yeah. And it seems like life feels so Exceptional 
Yeah. And it seems like life feels so Exceptional (Exceptional)
