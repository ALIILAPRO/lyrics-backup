		  (Six beats baby)
(Ski, live)

Thousand man in her DM
You ain't got a chance if you ain't in motion
I don't even know why he raps like that
Check my CV, you can tell I've been rolling

Only reply when it's really on
But I had to reply when the yute kept trolling
I get the bag, I'm the man in my city
I make the young boys shoot like Foden
Are you rolling or shook? (Muh muh)
My old friend took my machine
Better stay on his deen, he can't come to the hood
Little folk in a fuck off jacket
Ugly mash, and some dirty boogs
Make gyal go into the restaurant first
Go scan it and see what's good (go check that)

Yo, me and them boy can't cross path
Call him a doctor, trim it like crop yard
Uptown taking pics with fans
But I came with the wolves like Diego Costa
(Glee, glee, glee, glee)

Hate-hate when an insta girl lack cheek
Should have just put a Lambeth girl on fleek
Free Hector, bro got 17
Me and him was on the O like von and gleesh

Big glee up the front, got a pump in the back
This might put the ride off balance, I'm capping
It's only gonna cause some damage
Spot you a opp take time make him vanish
Yo, I put my gyal on fleek, when she mad at me
She be crying in fashion
She don't know the half I'm a savage
I'm hiding my life like American Dragon
Big glee up the front, got a pump in the back
This might put the ride off balance, I'm capping
It's only gonna cause some damage
Spot you a opp take time make him vanish
Yo, I put my gyal on fleek, when she mad at me
She be crying in fashion
She don't know the half I'm a savage
I'm hiding my life like American Dragon

Big mash on the ride of course
(Man down, man down)
You ain't tryna step, don't force it
I drop a bag if you turn it corpse
(Phew Whew) can't respawn
(Whew) if I ain't got a mash when you see me
I guarantee that I leave man torn
When I'm in Lambeth know my burners warm
Tess it in circle, mum heard the corn

See niggas get clap and they change their thoughts
See niggas clap man and they change their life
Won't see me there if the gang ain't live
And the gyal love man, I'm the greasy type
And if something get tanned nigga say it was Hesky
Why? Cause all of them yutes on chatting
(Whew whew)
Really do damage
Numerous banging, they said I'm a habit
New Rick Owen, I love all the swagging
I'm up to my tricks, I'ma fuck her and dash it
Tell her I love you, I'm sorry I'm capping
I don't just drill, I'm a part time gyallis
From the O, that's Gaza
Call me a Sparta
If we get you, that's not Karma
And he got shaved up too much time, I don't think he believe his barber

Big glee up the front, got a pump in the back
This might put the ride off balance, I'm capping
It's only gonna cause some damage
Spot you a opp take time make him vanish
Yo, I put my gyal on fleek, when she mad at me
She be crying in fashion
She don't know the half I'm a savage
I'm hiding my life like American Dragon

Big glee up the front, got a pump in the back
This might put the ride off balance, I'm capping
It's only gonna cause some damage
Spot you a opp take time make him vanish
Yo, I put my gyal on fleek, when she mad at me
She be crying in fashion
She don't know the half I'm a savage
I'm hiding my life like American Dragon
