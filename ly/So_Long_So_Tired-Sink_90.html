		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  so tell me how the way I forget you
or tell me now the way to break your heart
thousand girls, lovely discover
within those eyes, smile
you catch me when run

lonely night, these words about you
we never believe in
fairy tale or love story 
in the television, sucks
they will find love on the corner city
easy ways, happy end
but your heart away
It's so long, I'm so tired

how could it be like this,
last summer in a highschool
third times, you were playing around
I was trying, and trying again
you told me then that
"love is a growing up
with someone, you know
it's precious than anything"
but i always never win

starry night, these words about you
we never believe in
fairy tale or love story 
in the television, sucks
they will find love on the corner city
easy ways, happy end
but your heart away
It's so long, I'm so tired

so tell me now that you never loved me, 
so tell me now that you never loved me again

I walk through the darkness 
cold of loneliness
dying in sorrow
for a long haul

starry night, these wishes about you
and Iâ€™ve been waiting 
every second, every minute
the answer of a million things
Stay shine, my star and a loner
night change, morning comes
but the lights away
it's so long, I'm so tired
