		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was not what you where aiming for
I was hoping you could change me even more

You wear me like a scarf that matches your shoes 
Your world is a mirror and mine is you

Am I air am I light
Or just blinded by your side 

Am I in am I out 
Or just twilight in your eyes

We're just playing love
And you're playing with love

When you're holding my heart this way
you're just tearing my heart in two  

I own the memories of us when you were close
I still lay thinking, can't sleep so I compose 

The words that I write
Helped me figure out what's true

My world's an illusion
my world with you
Am I air am I light
Or just blinded by your side 

Am I in am I out 
Or just twilight in your eyes

We're just playing love
And you're playing with love

When you're holding my heart this way
you're just tearing my heart in two  

We're just playing love
And you're playing with love

When you're holding my heart this way
you're just tearing my heart in two  


Your words make me doubt
I can't figure it out
where are we right now
I can't let go
I've been following you
You've got me lost too 


My words make me doubt
 I can't figure it out
where are we right now
I can't let go
I've been following you
you've got me lost too 

We're just playing love
And you're playing with love

When you're holding my heart this way
you're just tearing my heart in two  

We're just playing love
You're just playing with love
You're just playing with love
You're just playing with love
You're just playing with love
