		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm only human
Sometimes I make mistakes
If you forgive me
I'm gonna do what it takes

But now I know better
To hurt you was wrong
Girl it's with you I belong

Somebody needs you
Like never before
Somebody wants your love
So open the door
Don't you leave me alone
Don't you turn out the light
Somebody wants you
Somebody needs you tonight

I've been thinking
We should be talking it through
You must believe me
I'll make it up to you

Cause now I know better
To hurt you was wrong
Girl it's with you I belong

In the dark
When there's no one else around
I still pray
That our love can be found
