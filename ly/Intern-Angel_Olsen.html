		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Maybe you know that it's been too long
Going through the motions as you sing your song
Doesn't matter who you are or what you've done
Still got to wake up and be someone
Still got to wake up and be someone

I don't care what the papers say
It's just another intern with a resum√©
I am going to fall in love with you some day
I'm gonna fall in love and run away
I'm gonna fall in love and run away

Everyone I know has got their own ideal
I just want to be alive, make something real
Doesn't matter who you are or what you do
Something in the work will make a fool of you
Something in the work will make a fool of you

Pick up the phone but I swear it's the last time
Pick up the phone but I swear it's the last time
Falling in love and I swear it's the last time
Falling in love and I swear it's the last time
