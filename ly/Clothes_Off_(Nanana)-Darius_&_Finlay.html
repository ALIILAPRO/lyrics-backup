		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We don't have to take our clothes off
To have a good time, oh no
We could dance and party all night
And drink some cherry wine, oh nah

We could
Hold on
We could
Hold on
We could
Hold on
And drink some cherry wine, oh nah

We could
Hold on
We could
Hold on
We could
Hold on
And drink some cherry wine, oh nah

Not a word from your lips
You just took for granted that I want to skinny-dip
A quick hit, that's your game
But I'm not a piece of meat
Stimulate my brain

Night is young, so are we
Let's get to know each other better
Slow and easily
Take my hand, let's hit the floor
Shake our bodies to the music, maybe then you'll score

We don't have to take our clothes off
To have a good time, oh no
We could dance and party, all night
And drink some cherry wine, oh nah

We don't have to take our clothes off
To have a good time, oh no
We could dance and party, all night
And drink some cherry wine, oh nah

We could
Hold on
We could
Hold on
We could
Hold on
And drink some cherry wine, oh nah
