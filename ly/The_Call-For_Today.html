		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There’s only one way into the Kingdom, and that’s death
Leonard Ravenhill

If you’re gonna be My disciple, kiss the world goodbye
Leonard Ravenhill

But it’s the only place that you can meet God, it’s the only way you’ll ever have forgiveness
That’s the cost of discipleship
Billy Graham

The cross beckons the man who is sick of himself
Damon Thompson

And if you haven’t been to the cross, there is no salvation and there is no forgiveness
Billy Graham

God’s looking for people that will say Yes
Damon Thompson

Be washed in the Blood of Jesus
Reinhard Bonnke

To live is Christ and to die is gain
David Wilkerson

I’m already dead, I’m not my own!
K. P. Yohannan

I’m not my own any longer
Paul Washer

Jesus said, ‘If any man will come after me, 
Let him deny himself and take up his cross, and follow me
Billy Graham

Jesus said unto His disciples, ‘If any man will come after Me,
Let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me’
Benny Hinn

There is a center of history and it’s the cross
John Piper
