		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  On lonely nights I start to fade
(On lonely nights I start to fade)
Her love is a thousand miles away
(Her love is a thousand miles away)
Memories made in the coldest winter
Goodbye my friend will I ever love again

Memories made in the coldest winter

It's 4am and I can't sleep
(It's 4am and I can't sleep)
Her love is all that I can see
(Her love is all that I can see)
Memories made in the coldest winter
Goodbye my friend will I ever love again

Memories made in the coldest winter
Winter, winter

Goodbye my friend will I ever love again
Goodbye my friend will I ever love again
Goodbye my friend will I ever love again

If spring can take the snow away
(If spring can take the snow away)
Can it melt away all of our mistakes
(Can it melt away all of our mistakes)
Memories made in the coldest winter
Goodbye my friend I won't ever love again

Never again
