		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, maybe it's the fact that I can't go back, no
Maybe it's the river's not much calmer now
I can hear the storm knocking at my door
And I just wanna answer
I think I know it's name
'Cause I'm the one to blame
Always chasing a disaster
Now I have to leave, just so I can breathe
Please don't tell me that you miss me
It's your way to change
I just need a little rain
I'm just looking for a better me

Oh-oh-oh-oh-ooh
I can't be those things next to you
Oh-oh-oh-oh-ooh
I can't be those things next to you

I thought we'd be forever, but I'm changing like the weather
Up, down, got scared, so I went and cut my hair
As our words they lose their meaning
I just need to feel my feeling
And it's too late to change
I'm already on a plane
I want it faster, chasing a disaster
Just so I can pick up all the pieces
Put them back without a reason when I'm there
Even if I'm scared, please don't tell me that you miss me
I wanna be better, I wanna be new
But I can't be those things next to you

Oh-oh-oh-oh-ooh
I can't be those things next to you
(I can't be those things next to you)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-ooh
I can't be those things next to you
(I can't be those things next to you)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-ooh
(I can't be those things next to you)
I can't be those things next to you

Wanna be better, I wanna be new
But I can't be those things next to you
