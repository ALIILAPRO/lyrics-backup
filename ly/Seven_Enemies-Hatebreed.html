		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Today is not the fucking day
I sympathize with their pain
Their negative ways
Giving birth to endless cries and complaints
I'm too close, just boiling with rage
I choke on this feeling of war
In my throat every day
Swallowed every bitter pill, now I'm forced to chew
Hearing every vicious word
Their filthy mouths spew
My thoughts descend into the abyss
My heart is begging me to finish this

Today I wish a motherfucker would try
Think of someone other than themselves one time
Today I wish a motherfucker would try
To see this fucked-up world through my eyes

Please God, don't let me act on these words
And forgive those who choose to test my last nerve
I see red, can't cleanse it away
They took kindness for weakness
Now they answer on this desperate day
Wake up alone, again nothing's changed
Infected my demons, all my visions become deranged
Seven enemies to vanquish one-by-one
Hatred blisters the surface of my tongue

Today I wish a motherfucker would try
Think of someone other than themselves one time
Today I wish a motherfucker would try
To see this fucked up world through my eyes

Not today
I thought they'd find a better way
Today is not the fucking day
