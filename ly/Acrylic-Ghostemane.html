		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I guess I’m awake
Fuck
Why me?
Couldn’t he just take me in my sleep?
I guess he doesn’t exist
After all I should be dead for what I’ve said
(Dead, dead for what I’ve said)

I been looking for love
In algorithms
Tryin' to find
My piece of mind
I been playing with drugs
Since I lost my gun
And these acrylics keep breaking and breaking (and...)

You’re still the rose below my shin
And everyday I fight to not
Ask how you been
I’ve been wasted not thinking 'bout what’s next
Cuz you know when movies end
No one reads the creds

I’m switching to a new diet
Heavy on lead
Open up my lips
Let the end begin
I wonder would you care
If I wasn’t here
I wonder would you care
I wonder who would care
If I shoot and miss
I know you’ll never miss me
If I shoot and miss
I know you’ll never miss me (again...)

I been looking for love
In algorithms
Tryin' to find
My piece of mind
I been playing with drugs
Since I lost my gun
And these acrylics keep breaking and breaking (and...)
