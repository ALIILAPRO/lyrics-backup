		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hell
What if heaven can't help me now
Better run and find some hallowed ground
I'm in over my head
I'm in over my head
And when I take a breath I
Drown
As my fountain of youth dries out
Feel a thousand years older now
Panic overfed
Sleepless nights under my bed yeah
Could you give me something for the pain
I'm feeling more than I can contain
Sanctuary
Can't find no sanctuary
Before my bones are buried
I need a little light
Just to get me through the night
Sanctuary
Can't find no sanctuary
The dark is getting heavy
I need a little light
Just to get me through the night
Where do I start
It's like I'm fighting sharks
Deep in the depths
Under duress
I need a rest
Or maybe just a second just to catch my breath
Something here is contagious
I fear I'm losing my aim and
If I do I won't make it
This monster was once on a leash but now I think it's gotten free
Can someone call a referee
Knew this would come back to bite me
Please stop
I'd rather live in the make believe
Can somebody pray for me
Sanctuary
Can't find no sanctuary
Before my bones are buried
I need a little light
Just to get me through the night
Sanctuary
Can't find no sanctuary
The dark is getting heavy
I need a little light
Just to get me through the night
Sanctuary
Sanctuary
Hell
What if heaven can't help me now
Better run and find some hallowed ground
I'm in over my head
I'm in over my head
And when I take a breath I
Drown
As my fountain of youth dries out
Feel a thousand years older now
Panic overfed
Sleepless nights under my bed yeah
Sanctuary
Can't find no sanctuary
Before my bones are buried
I need a little light
Just to get me through the night
Sanctuary
Can't find no sanctuary
The dark is getting heavy
I need a little light
Just to get me through the night
Sanctuary
Sanctuary
