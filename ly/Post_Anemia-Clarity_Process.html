		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  For now we won't talk about our failing hearts. 
False sounds of Athena as she whispers, 
"This place is somewhere that we can't get to." 
Use it 'til your lifeless eyes lift. 

Lights out. 
This distorted glass seems foreign 
And this burning rose will teach us fire is a gift. 
Knives out. 
Is this cut below the surface? 
There's a burning rose, violent, black, and cold. 
It teaches fire is a gift. 

Eyes down, emulate the face that got you here. 
Black out. Deaf and numb. 
Remnants of something almost human. 

This place is somewhere that we can't get to. 
Use it 'till your lifeless eyes lift.

Lights out. 
This distorted glass seems foreign 
And this burning rose will teach us fire is a gift. 
Knives out. 
Is this cut below the surface? 
There's a burning rose, violent, black, and cold. 
It teaches fire is a gift. 

This shelter. 
Hemorrhage is our last escape from.
