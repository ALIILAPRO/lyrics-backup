		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I will sit right here and bide my time
As long as it takes to get what's rightfully mine

And I won't be denied
Cuz all I've got left is my pride
And I will rise up

Break it up
Break you down
Breakin' through
Breakin' ground
Had your chance
Now it's gone
All you take
All you've done

All I've done

And I will sit right here and I will wait
Patiently for your last big mistake

And I won't be denied
Cuz all I've got left is my pride
And I will rise up

Break it up
Break you down
Breakin' through
Breakin' ground
Had your chance
Now it's gone
All you take
All you've done
I control
My own fate
And for you
It's too late
It's my dream
It's my way
It's my life
It's your pain

And I won't be denied
Cuz all I've got left is my pride
And I will rise up

Break it up
Break you down
Breakin' through
Breakin' ground
Had your chance
Now it's gone
All you take
All you've done

And I won't be denied
Break it out
Break you down
Breakin' through
Breakin' ground
Had your chance
Now it's gone
All you take
All you've done
Break it out
Break you down
Breakin' through
Breakin' ground
Had your chance
Now it's gone
All you've done
