		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dig, man, there goes Mack The Knife

Oh, the shark has pretty teeth, dear
And it shows them pearly white
Just a jackknife has MacHeath, dear
And he keeps it out of sight
When the shark bites with his teeth, dear
Scarlet billows start to spread
Fancy gloves, though, wears MacHeath, dear
So there's not a trace of red

On the sidewalk, sundayy morning, baby
Lies a body oozin' life
Someone's sneakin' 'round the corner
Is this someone Mack the Knife?

From a tugboat, by the river
A cement bag's drooppin' down
Yes, the cement's just for the weight, dear
Bet you Macky's back in town
Lookie here, Louie Miller disappeared, dear
After drawin' out his cash
And MacHeath spends like a sailor
Did our boy do somethin' rash?

Sukey Tawdry, Jenny Diver, Lotte Lenya, sweet Lucy Brown
Oh, the line forms on the right, dears
Now that Macky's back in town

Take it, Satch
