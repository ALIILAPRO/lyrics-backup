		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I should laugh, but I cry
Because your love has passed me by
You took me by surprise
You didn't realize but I was waiting

Time goes slowly, but carries on
And now the best years have come and gone
You took me by surprise
I didn't realize that you were laughing

(Laughing) 'cause you're doin' it to me
(Laughing) it ain't the way it should be
You took away everything I had, you put the hurt on me

(Laughing) 'cause you're doin' it to me
(Laughing) it ain't the way it should be
You took away everything I had, you put the hurt on me

I go alone now, calling your name
After losing at the game
You took me by surprise
I didn't realize that you were laughing

Time goes slowly, but carries on
And now the best years
The best years have come and gone
You took me by surprise
I didn't realize that you were laughing

(Laughing) 'cause you're doin' it to me
(Laughing) it ain't the way it should be
You took away everything I had, you put the hurt on me

(Laughing) 'cause you're doin' it to me
(Laughing) oh, what you doing to me?
You took away everything I had, you put the hurt on me, oh

(Laughing) ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
(Laughing) ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
(Laughing) were you laughing at me?
(Laughing) were you laughing at me?

(Laughing) oh, what you're doin' to me, girl?
(Laughing) I'm-a looking, you're laughing
(Laughing) I'm-a looking, you're laughing
(Laughing) you're looking, I'm laughing
(Laughing) laughing at me
(Laughing) laughing, you're the laughing lady
(Laughing) oh, what you're doin' to me?
