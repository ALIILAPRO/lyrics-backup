		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're doing fine
Most of the time
You sit and wonder
What tomorrow brings
All kinds of things
You sit and wait
You hesitate
Just like you've never
Been in love before
There's so much more
On your own
And though you feel alone
You are alive
Don't you know
It's just another day
All alone
Into this world we're thrown
You are alive
Don't you know
It's just another day
On your own
And though you feel alone
You are alive
Don't you know
It's just another day
You turn around
You're lost and found
Looking for someone
Who will understand
Or hold your hand
You count the days
A hopeless case
But for the first time
You will wait for me
Patiently
On your own
And though you feel alone
You are alive
Don't you know
It's just another day
All alone
Into this world we're thrown
You are alive
Don't you know
It's just another day
