		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What the hell you talking about love?
I thought I was doing this for us
You know I just played my part
You said if you leave me for that world
I won't be here when you return
But can we just go back to start

Just hold me and say
You're not leaving this way
'Cause I'm about to lose my mind
This mess that I made
Don't you say it's too late
Can I die in your arms one last time?

'Cause all my mistakes they led me straight into you
Remember you said to me regret is for fools
Crashing and burning like I always do
But all my mistakes they led me straight into you
Yeah, they led me to you

It's like losing everything on a bad bet
I've lost everything but my habits
I fall so easily
And it's like going right when you should've gone left
Or the memories I wish I could forget
But they're never leaving me

Just hold me and say
You're not leaving this way
'Cause I'm about to lose my mind
This mess that I made
Don't you say it's too late
Can I die in your arms one last time?

'Cause all my mistakes they led me straight into you
Remember you said to me regret is for fools
Crashing and burning like I always do
But all my mistakes they led me straight into you

I'm messed up like I do
But regret is for fools
Now I praise my mistakes
'Cause they led me to you
I'm messed up like I do
But regret is for fools
Now I praise my mistakes
'Cause they led me to you
Yeah, they led me to you

What the hell you talking about love?
I thought I was doing this for us
You know I just played my part
