		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know I'm better off not looking back
Forgive me father, won't you take it back?
That we were lovers
Bodies touching on park benches
Stray dogs watching
It disgusts me now

I wish I didn't want you
Wish I could do without
This blood on my face
Where you teeth sunk in
Bite me again

When it's 4 AM
And your heart is breaking
I will hold your hands
To stop them from shaking
If it takes all night
I will be on your side

Back to the olive mount you lead me to
The wind was blinding so I clung to you
And you smiled so sweetly
As you threw me
Down the rocks into the seaweed
You thought that I could fly

I wish I didn't want you
Wish I could do without this blood
On my face, where your teeth sunk in
Bite me again

When it's 4 AM
And your heart is breaking
I will hold your hands
To stop them from shaking
If it takes all night
I will be on your side

When you're lying here, I believe you love me
You can hold my hair back when you kiss me
If you stay all night, I will be on your side

When it's 4 AM
And your heart is breaking
I will hold your hands
To stop them from shaking
If it takes all night
I will be on your side
