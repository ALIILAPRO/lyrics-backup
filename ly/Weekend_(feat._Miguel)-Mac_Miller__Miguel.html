		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got a little bit of money feelin' my pockets
Roll around like I run this shit
I got a system filled up with toxins
I been broken hearted and I was fuck that bitch
Gettin' high to deal with my problems
Fuckin' bitches and gettin' drunk as shit
But these bitches gettin' obnoxious
They nothin' to me though I love this shit
Go long days, longer nights
Talk too much, the wrong advice
All the lights, and call my life
Doctor, doctor, will you help me?
Get me healthy, keep it lowest you can help me
Ain't shit you can tell me now
First rap shipment, sellin' out
Ooh shit, my new bitch, you jealous now
Smokin' weed at the crib watchin' Belly now
All the pain that they causin' like fuck it we ballin' now everythin' straight
You feelin' the feelin', I'm chillin', just livin', I'm livin' away
Conversations we havin', I'm gettin' too static, too much on my plate
Lord I need me a break

But I'll be good by the weekend (alright, yeah)
I'll be good by the weekend (yeah)
Everythin' good by the weekend (yeah)
Everythin' will be good by the weekend (alright, by the weekend)
We goin' out tonight, yeah, we goin' out tonight, like fuck it
We goin' out tonight, yeah, we goin' out tonight, fuck it
We goin' out tonight, yeah, we goin' out tonight, it's the weekend
We goin' out tonight, yeah, we goin' out tonight, it's the weekend

I been havin' trouble sleepin'
Battlin' these demons
Wonderin' what's the thin' that keeps me breathin'
Is it money, fame or neither
I been thinkin' about the places that I frequent
All the people that I see
I started livin' decent
But what do it mean to be a G (alright)
Only time we fall behind, bitches in the concubine, callin' mine crazy
See in God's desire make water wine, pause in time, it's common they often hate me
Never will I walk in line, I cross the T's and dot the I's
Wonderin' well, wonderin' how I got this high
Fell and asleep and forgot to die, god damn
I'm poppin' them dollars and drinkin' them powders, faded
Get it over the counter, I'm stuck on the browsers like how did I make it
These bitches don't know me, this shit is so lonely until she get naked
Don't even know what today is

But I'll be good by the weekend (alright, yeah)
I'll be good by the weekend (yeah)
Everythin' good by the weekend (yeah)
Everythin' will be good by the weekend (alright, by the weekend)

Mondays I think of you
But I ain't trippin' on it
Tuesdays I'm in
Gotta get my hands up on ya
Wednesdays I'm lit with you
You know you're stayin' over
Thursdays I'm sick of you
I got to get rid of you
'Cause Fridays are always the start of the time of my life, alright
When I get faded you hate it but, baby, it's gon' be alright, ha, alright
