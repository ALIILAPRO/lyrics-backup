		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Did you drink enough to miss me
Or did you miss me enough to drink?
Did you mean it when you kissed me?
Hope you missed me enough (missed me enough)

Hand me the bottle
Let's drink up tonight, got your
Hands on the throttle
Drive us back in time

'Til we're just kids again
Lost, broke, and innocent
Yeah, when you hand me the bottle
I got one thing on my mind

Did you drink enough to miss me
Or did you miss me enough to drink?
Did you mean it when you kissed me
Or was I just another fling?
And am I on your mind like all the time, like you're on mine
Said you're weren't, but I lied, baby, I
Hope you meant it when you kissed me
Hope you missed me enough, missed me enough to drink

Oh, oh
Missed me enough to drink
Oh, oh
Missed me enough to drink

Play me that one song
That I used to like, and we'll
Sing every word wrong
And love through the night
'Til it's past 4am
We'll become us again
Yeah, when you, play me that one song
I got one thing on my mind

Did you drink enough to miss me
Or did you miss me enough to drink?
Did you mean it when you kissed me
Or was I just another fling?
And am I on your mind like all the time, like you're on mine
Said you're weren't, but I lied, baby, I
Hope you meant it when you kissed me
Hope you missed me enough, missed me enough to drink

Oh, oh
Missed me enough to drink
Oh, oh

And am I on your mind like all the time, like you're on mine
Said you're weren't, but I lied, baby, I
Hope you meant it when you kissed me
Hope you missed me enough, missed me enough to drink

Did you drink enough to miss me
Or did you miss me enough to drink
Did you mean it when you kissed me
Or was I just another fling?
And am I on your mind like all the time, like you're on mine
Said you're weren't, but I lied, baby, I
Hope you meant it when you kissed me
Hope you missed me enough, missed me enough to drink
