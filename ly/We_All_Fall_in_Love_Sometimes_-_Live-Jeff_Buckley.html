		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Live at the WMFU Music Faucet
Elton John cover

"Jeff: This should bring back some memories..I think...everything I do should bring back some memories
Interviewer: except for that last song..
J.: everybody has memories of love gone bad for some reason, especially if it's gone bad for reasons they don't know about..and they can never really figure out...that on..that last one was called 'Unorgiven' (ie:...which would be the old name of Last Goodbye)
I: is that a new song of yours...?
J: that's a song of mine, it's not new..
I: no?
J: no."

(...excuse me..)

Wise men say
It looks like rain today
It crackled on the speakers
And trickled down the sleepy subway trains
For heavy eyes could hardly hold us
Aching legs that often told us
It's all worth it
We all fall in love sometimes

The full moon's bright
And starlight filled the evening
We wrote it and I played it
But something happened it's so strange this feeling
Naive notions that were childish
Simple tunes that tried to hide it
But when it comes
We all fall in love sometimes

Didn't we? did we? should we? could we?
I'm not sure but sometimes we're so blind
Struggling through the day
When even your best friends say
Don't you find?
We all fall in love sometimes

hmmm...

Oh, yeah..
And only passing time
Could kill the boredom we acquired
Running with the losers for a while
And our empty sky was filled with laughter
Just before the flood
Painting worried faces with a smile

Wise men say
It looks like rain today
It crackled on the speakers
And trickled down the sleepy subway trains
For heavy eyes could hardly hold us
Aching legs that often told us
It's all worth it
We all fall in love sometimes

oh oh oh...

We all fall in love some times...
