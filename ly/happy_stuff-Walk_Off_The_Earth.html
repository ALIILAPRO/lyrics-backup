		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My 21st birthday
Came with a price to pay, move out 
And figure it all out right away

Gone are the carefree days
The memories fade away and now, 
Reality checks me everyday

I can think of a hundred million 
Things I'd rather do than be anxious
I'm broke as hell and it's gettin' overwhelming

I just want happy thoughts, happy friends, 
Happy songs, happy love
Just wanna dance around, clothes are off, 
Forget about all the not-so-happy stuff That's what I want
All day, all night
I'll deal with all the stress in another life 
Happy thoughts, happy friends,
Happy songs, happy love That's what I want

Been makin' some big mistakes 
Ran outta time to waste, and now 
Nobody left to bail me out

Bills stackin' up again
Headaches from my sleeplessness 
But mama thinks I'm capable as hell 
That's a lotta credit for myself

I just want happy thoughts, happy friends, 
Happy songs, happy love
Just wanna dance around, clothes are off, 
Forget about all the not-so-happy stuff 
That's what I want
All day, all night
I'll deal with all the stress in another life 
Happy thoughts, happy friends,
Happy songs, happy love

I can think of a hundred million 
Things I'd rather do than be anxious

I know someday it'll all catch up to me

I just want happy thoughts, happy friends, 
Happy songs, happy love
Just wanna dance around, clothes are off, 
Forget about all the not-so-happy stuff That's what I want
All day, all night
I'll deal with all the stress in another life Happy thoughts, happy friends,
Happy songs, happy love

That's what I want. 
All day, All night,
That's what I wanna think about 
All day, All night,
Just think about the happy stuff.
