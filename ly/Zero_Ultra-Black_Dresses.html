		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Twisting shadows of shadows
Of shadows of shadows of shadows of shadows
Echoed down thru time twisting shadows
Of shadows of shadows of shadows of shadows
Of shadows
Of shadows of confused and poisonous light
And everything it touches dies
In a form of supercomplex violence
But that could never happen to us

I don't know if this is sustainable
Try to make it last

Try to make it last

Everything that I got left is stuck inside me

Like bit's of glass

In the moment I feel so infinite

Power over the bad dreams the dissonance
But I need impossible gentleness

To stay intact

TO MAKE IT LAST

It's easier to make you think

I'm too far gone
Than it is to try to tell you
What's in my heart
It's easiеr to make you think

I'm dangerous than it is to try to tell you
What is

I NEEEED AUGH i NEEEEeedd uh

Twisting shadows of shadows of
Somеthing I can't say echo down thru time
Reflecting out thru a
Rainbow prism colorwheel in every direction
Of confused and poisonous light

Pull me out of stasis

One more time return to life
Search deep inside for weight to

Put behind every line

I can't remember what my name is

Shake the dust from inside
Is there a way to break the cycle?

Defenses up borderline

Eeeeevery thing i
GOT LEFT STUCK INSIDE ME LIke bit's of glass
I neeeEEEEDDDDDDD Impossible gentleness
To stay intact i i need Impossible- -ness

I need impossible gentleness
