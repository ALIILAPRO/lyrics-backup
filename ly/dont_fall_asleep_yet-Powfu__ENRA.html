		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't fall asleep yet
I'm wide awake still
I wonder if you think about me when you lay still
Don't fall asleep yet
Promise me you'll stay here
Are my pictures on your wall still like last year?

Don't fall asleep yet
I'm wide awake still
I wonder if you think about me when you lay still
It's been a long time
Miss you around me
When I dream about you are you dreaming 'bout me?

Don't fall asleep
I'm wide awake
I hope that we
Have brighter days
You still have my heart
So don't let it break
I want you all mine forever
I'll put my heart on a projector
I wish we settled all the struggles we got into
The best part of my life was with you

Don't fall asleep yet
I'm wide awake still
I wonder if you think about me when you lay still
It's been a long time
Miss you around me
When I dream about you are you dreaming 'bout me?

Think about you too much
Tryna fall asleep
But my eyes won't shut
Said you need a break
And that's OK
But when you feel alone
Always got my place
Life throws curves
Sorry for your loss
Praying for your peace
When the night feels long
Writing songs for you with my guitar
Leave if you want but please don't go far

Don't fall asleep
I'm wide awake
Don't fall asleep
I'm wide awake
I hope that we
Have brighter days
You still have my heart
So don't let it break
