		  (G. Ry got me)
(OG Parker)

Like girl, who you think you be foolin'?
I'm peepin' all of your movements
'Cause girl, you're the one I'm pursuing
All of these bitches be choosing
But girl, you're the one that I'm choosing, yeah
Pull up in that coupe and we cruisin' (skrrt)
Like girl, who you think you be foolin'?
I'm peepin' all of your movements
'Cause girl, you're the one I'm pursuing
All of these bitches be choosing
But you the only one I'm choosing, yeah
Pull up in that coupe and we cruisin' (skrrt)

Shawty, I'm fuckin' with you
I pull up, you hop in my coupe
Girl, I'm so glad you my boo
I put that ice all on you
I put your neck all on freeze
These niggas ain't better than me
These niggas ain't flexin' like me
Ain't fuckin' that check up like me
Girl, you know I got that juice (ice)
You know I walked in with you (ice)
And you know we never gon' lose (never)
I love how you change up my mood (yeah)
Stars, yeah, they all in the roof (Wraith)
When we walk in, they stalkin' the spot (spot)
I gotta walk with a Glock (glizzy)
You help me count up this guap (bands)
'Cause I'm havin' all of this cash (cash)
And you got all of that swag (drip)
Girl, we be drippin' together (drip)
Yeah, we be trippin' together (trip)
We just be switchin' the weather, yeah
Yeah (Be on private jets and shit)

Like girl, who you think you be foolin'?
I'm peepin' all of your movements
'Cause girl, you're the one I'm pursuing
All of these bitches be choosing
But girl, you're the one that I'm choosing, yeah
Pull up in that coupe and we cruisin' (skrrt)
Like girl, who you think you be foolin'?
I'm peepin' all of your movements
'Cause girl, you're the one I'm pursuing
All of these bitches be choosing
But you the only one I'm choosing, yeah
Pull up in that coupe and we cruisin' (skrrt)

Flexin', hundred bands, I spend it all on you
You know that shit ain't nothin', I can ball on you (Swish)
Come through with your girlfriends, they can all come too
They can all come through, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Turn the lights off, shawty got too much diamonds
Shawty said, "You way too shiny," they be like, "Where'd you find him?"
Swoop, shawty, she outer space
That's my bae, she put it all in my face
Yeah, yeah
And my bitch so bad
We do the digital dash
Skrrt (ice)
I just hope that we don't crash
We livin' life too fast
All of these haters, they mad, sad
(Let the beat just, just run off, like
That's so fire)

Like girl, who you think you be foolin'?
I'm peepin' all of your movements
'Cause girl, you're the one I'm pursuing
All of these bitches be choosing
But girl, you're the one that I'm choosing, yeah
Pull up in that coupe and we cruisin' (skrrt)
Like girl, who you think you be foolin'?
I'm peepin' all of your movements
'Cause girl, you're the one I'm pursuing
All of these bitches be choosing
But you the only one I'm choosing, yeah
Pull up in that coupe and we cruisin'
