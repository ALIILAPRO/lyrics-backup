		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Something's in the air tonight
Little bit of paradise
I'm just gonna roll the dice

What if I spoke from the heart
Laid out all of my cards
Say what I wanna say
Oh, I've been looking at the stars
Wanting a brand-new start
I'm tired of this game

I ain't afraid of tomorrow
I don't fear what's coming (oh-oh-oh-oh)
I'll do whatever
I just need your beautiful loving (yeah-eh-eh)

Something's in the air tonight
Little bit of paradise
I'm just gonna roll the dice
Look, here goes nothing
All these feelings in my mind
I could fall or I could fly
I'm just gonna roll the dice
Look, here goes nothing

Was heartbroken
Now my heart's open
I'm running down an empty highway
Something's in the air tonight
Little bit of paradise
I'm just gonna roll the dice
Look, here goes nothing

What if I could swim so deep
The water's underneath
I'd never be afraid
Oh, what if I could reach so high
Climb mountains to the sky
Like nothing's in my way (oh-oh-oh-oh)

I'll do whatever
I just need your beautiful loving (yeah-eh-eh)

Something's in the air tonight
Little bit of paradise
I'm just gonna roll the dice
Look, here goes nothing
All these feelings in my mind
I could fall or I could fly
I'm just gonna roll the dice
Look, here goes nothing

Was heartbroken
Now my heart's open
I'm running down an empty highway
Something's in the air tonight
Little bit of paradise
I'm just gonna roll the dice
Look, here goes nothing

(Here goes nothing)
(Here goes nothing)

Something's in the air tonight
Little bit of paradise
I'm just gonna roll the dice
Look, here goes nothing
All these feelings in my mind
I could fall or I could fly
I'm just gonna roll the dice
Look, here goes nothing

Was heartbroken
Now my heart's open
I'm running down an empty highway
Something's in the air tonight
Little bit of paradise
I'm just gonna roll the dice
Look, here goes nothing

(Here goes nothing)
(Here goes nothing)
