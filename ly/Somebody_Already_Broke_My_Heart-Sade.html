		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You came along
When I needed a savior 
Someone to pull me through somehow 
I've been torn apart so many times 
I've been hurt so many times before 
So I'm counting on you now 

Somebody already broke my heart 
Somebody already broke my heart 

Here I am 
So don't leave me stranded 
On the end of a line 
Hanging on the edge of a lie 
I've been torn apart so many times 
I've been hurt so many times before 
So be careful and be kind 

Somebody already broke my heart 
If someone has to lose, I don't want to play 
Somebody already broke my heart 
No, no, I can't go there again 

You came along
When I needed a savior 
Someone to pull me through somehow 
I've been torn apart so many times 
I've been hurt so many times before 
So I'm counting on you now 

Somebody already broke my heart 
If someone has to lose 
I don't want to play 
Somebody already broke my heart (can't go there again)
No, no, I can't go there again
