		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now people say I'm jinxed
I got some kind of voodoo hex
Life is so complex
There's no telling what could happen next
Life on the edge,
Fuels the sickness in my head
It embeds the type of thoughts
That got a lot of brothers dead
The smarter brother knows
To keep his foes close
And I'm the type of brothers
That smarter than most
A cold hearted overdose
Of lyrical antidotes
The cure to make sure
My karma can't take me down
Up to the same old tricks
I wonder if I'll stick around

Is a penny really lucky
If you find it on the ground?
I can't figure it out
My karma crashing down
In the form of a black cloud

[Chorus: x2]
I've got a little black cloud,
That follows me
Everywhere I go
It takes over me

I'm sick
I've got an ill disposition
My intentions are pure
But there's a cure for my condition
My decisions
Put me in the wrong positions
Chasing pipe dreams
Of fame and recognition
The Epic
Not only a name
A definition
My game remains no matter the pain
I stay a charmer
The Don of Karma
I navigate like the Dalli Lama
I ain't a saint
But I've got joi de vie
And I'm the one to blame
If the cloud rains on me
I can't complain about it
Or even let regret
Provoke the energy it takes
For me to get upset

A bad boy since birth
So I can't forget
what goes around
Comes around
And it ain't got me yet
I've gotten wise in my age
And tame the treat of my rage
I've got allot to learn
And I've got money to spend
To pretend is reaping more
Than sewing ever could mend

[Chorus]

Trade my torches for a dime
Black cloud's lifted for the light
The pressure's fading away now
A thousands cigarettes
Won't change the way we feel
The pressure's fading now
Can you bare the though of knowing truth?
Knowing truth?

I was rapping in the rain
Hoping that my luck would change
And if there's any truth
To all those all sayings
'Cause if I kill a spider
Would my house catch on fire?
If I walk under a ladder
Would it matter?
I tend to laugh
When a black cats cross my path
Break mirrors in half
Just to test the aftermath
Now here comes the rain
I protect my pain
Trying to make sense
Of these crazy things
I'm a diamond in the rough
Could I suffer enough?
I'm getting high for a living
Not giving a fuck
These hard times got me stuck
Stuck in a jam
Disastrous
Took time to master this
And the past
Is just a map to capture this
In the darkness
I'm force to adapt to this
I would change the past
If I could have one wish

[Chorus]
