		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sunrise, sunset, sunrise, sunset
Swiftly go the days
Sunrise, sunset, you wake up then you undress
It always is the same
The sunrise and the sunsets, you're lying while you confess
Keep trying to explain
The sunrise and the sunsets, you realize then you forget 
What you've been trying to retain

But everybody knows 
It's all about the things that get stuck inside of your head
Like the songs your roommate sings
A vision of her body as she stretches out on your bed
And she raised her hands in the air
Asked you, "When was the last time you looked in the mirror?"
Because you've changed
Yeah, you've changed

The sunrise, the sunsets, you're hopeful and then you regret 
The circle never breaks
With a sunrise and a sunset, there's a change of heart or address
Is there nothing that remains?
For a sunrise or a sunset, you're manic or you're depressed
Will you ever feel okay?
For a sunrise or a sunset, your lover is an actress
Did you really think she'd stay?

For a sunrise or a sunset, you're either coming or you just left
But you're always on the way
Towards a sunrise or a sunset, a scribble or a sonnet
They are really just the same
To the sunrise or a sunset, the master and his servant 
Have exactly the same fate
It's a sunrise and a sunset, from a cradle to a casket
There is no way to escape
The sunrise and a sunset, hold your sadness like a puppet
Keep putting on the play

But everything you do is leading to the point 
Where you just won't know what to do
At that moment you may laugh but there is someone there
Who will be laughing louder than you
So it's true, the trick is complete
You become everything you said you never would be

You're a fool
You're a fool

Sunrise, sunset, sunrise, sunset, sunrise and the sunsets
Sunrise, sunset, sunrise, the sunsets, the sunrise, the sunsets
Sunrise, sunset, go home to your apartment
Put the cassette in the tape deck
And let that fever play
Sunrise, sunset, where are you Arienette?
Where are you Arienette?
