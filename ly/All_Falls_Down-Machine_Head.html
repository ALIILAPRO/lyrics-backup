		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Anticipating, salivating, intoxicating 
How I've been waiting 
To gently soak in 
Your dream that's broken 
Caress my hands 
Around your throat 
When I choke the last gasp of air out of you 

I'll mesmerize you, hypnotize you 
Paralyze you, my snake eyes blind you 
My tenderest tickle, my gentlest prickle 
The back of your neck 
I stab icicles 

My sweetest grin will pull you in 
Behind that grin a razor teeth smile 
Under your bed 
Inside your head 
I am the monster in wait 

Walk, run 
I'm the fear you've become 
Pray, hope 
Before it's your 
Downfall, and all falls down 

I patronize you, victimize you 
My false pretenses endear me to you 
I'm psychopathic, psychosomatic 
Believe everything you've heard about me 

Ate you alive since you were a child 
That's when the monster first appeared to you 
So know my name 
What is my name? 
My name is fear and I'm you 

Walk, run 
I'm the fear you've become 
Pray, hope 
Before it's your 
Downfall, and all falls down 

With faith I crawl 
In sadness, I fear what I've become 
'Cause after all 
I'm acting, pretend my smile on 
Before the fall 
The pain washes over 
Hold on, hold on 
Survive 
Survive 
This 

Walk, run 
Free the fear you've become 
Fight back 
Before it's your 
Downfall, and all falls down
