		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Go

Now become
Kill the pain
I'm breaking the shackles
Endless, let my spirit rise
I will not be denied
Rage against the dying light
Fearless, so vicious and violent
I'll fight this struggle to the death
Until nothing is left
Pounding fists on beaten chest
Scream this 'til my dying breath

Stand strong and fight through the scorn
Become the firestorm, become the firestorm
Distended, twisted and torn
Become the firestorm, become the firestorm

Watch me burn
The fury is frightening
Deathless, smash and conquer all
Time to beckon the call
Stand with me and never fall
Toxic, the pious and poisoned
Heartless, trust there's no love lost
And no matter the cost
Don't believe that all is lost
Kill this mental holocaust

Stand strong and fight through the scorn
Become the firestorm (the firestorm), become the firestorm (the firestorm)
Distended, twisted and torn
Become the firestorm (the firestorm), become the firestorm (the firestorm)

Honor, valor, I have shone
Courage, respect carved in stone
Killers, sinners are my flock
Slaughter, carnage, butcher's block

If there was ever a time in my life
That time is now
Take this weakness that cuts like a knife
And smash it down, oh, come on

If there was ever a time in my life
That time is now
Take this weakness that cuts like a knife
And smash it down

Stand strong and fight through the scorn
Become the firestorm, become the firestorm
Distended, twisted and torn
Become the firestorm, become the firestorm

Stand strong and fight through the scorn
Become the firestorm, become the firestorm
Distended, twisted and torn
Become the firestorm, become the fire, become the firestorm
