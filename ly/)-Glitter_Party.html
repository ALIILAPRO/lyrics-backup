		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't sleep at night
Just thinking about the
Things that I said
And what I didn't
And I think i'm in love
What do I know?
I'm just sitting alone with
Nothing to show, yeah

I'm the happiest i've
Been in years
And I know i'm in love
It cant be more clear
Can't get her out of my head
Not like i'd try
And I can't let these days just
Pass me by, yeah

Suddenly
I'm withdrawn
She keeps
Me held on

I'm the happiest i've
Been in years
And I know i'm in love
It cant be more clear
Can't get her out of my head
Not like id try
And I can't let these days just
Pass me by, yeah yeah

And I can't let these days just
Pass me by, yeah

Suddenly
I'm withdrawn
She keeps
Me held on
