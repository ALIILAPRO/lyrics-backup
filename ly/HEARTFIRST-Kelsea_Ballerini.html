		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Met him at a party, accidentally brushed his body
On the way to get a drink at the bar
I couldn't wait 'til later, talking in the elevator
Then we're kissing in the back of the car
That voice in my head says to slow down
But it can't see the way you're looking at me right now
It may not be next week, what I need
Then again, maybe it might be

Could be forever or we might break
That's just the kind of risk that we take
My head is yelling that I could get hurt
But I'm gonna jump right in
Baby, with my heart first

I gotta have ya, gotta see if this works
I gotta have ya, wake up in your t-shirt

Who knows what'll happen, ain't that always kinda magic
When you don't know who's holding the cards
Could be a wish I never knew ya or permanently tattoo ya
Only the moon knows what's in the stars (what's in the stars)
Mm, that voice in my head says to slow down
But it can't feel your hands on my hips right now
It may not be next year, what I need
Then again, maybe it might be

Could be forever or we might break
That's just the kind of risk that we take
My head is yelling that I could get hurt
But I'm gonna jump right in
Baby, with my heart first

I gotta have ya, gotta see if this works
(I gotta have ya)
I gotta have ya, wake up in your t-shirt
I gotta have ya, diving in heart first
(Heart first)
I gotta have ya
Ooh, I gotta have ya

And I can't even stop myself anymore
(Ooh, I gotta have ya)
Oh, we couldn't end the perfect night outside my front door

Could be forever or we might break
That's just the kind of risk that we take
My head is yelling that I could get hurt
But I'm gonna jump right in
Baby, with my heart first

I gotta have ya, gotta see if this works
(I gotta have ya)
I gotta have ya, wake up in your t-shirt
(Wake up in your t-shirt, yeah)
I gotta have ya, diving in heart first 
(Diving in heart first)
I gotta have ya
Yeah, I gotta have ya
