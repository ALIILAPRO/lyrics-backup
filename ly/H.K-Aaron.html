		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've lost myself into the mirror
Watching all those point-of-views
I've got your fever
Got your features
Got your taste for silent bruises

Different longings, different options
Still we share the same old moon
Who decides the set of costumes
That one wears to fit the room?

Possibly I know your pain
And I feel the same
I could cry for you
Be a voice for two
Possibly I know your pain
And I feel the same
Let me cry for you
Be a voice for two
Be a voice for you

Lost myself into the mirror
Like a blue note bends in blues
As the knife plunged in the water
Some laws still shine only tears
Standing at the streetlight waiting
And nothing's really new
Raindrops glowing on my blue jean
As billions pearls were sewn

Possibly I know your pain
And I feel the same
I could cry for you
Be a voice for two
Possibly I know your pain
(Standing at the streetlight waiting)
And I feel the same
(Like billions others do)
Let me cry for you
(Raindrops falling on my blue jean)
Be a voice for two
(Grow ephemeral diamonds)

Possibly I know your pain
And I feel the same
I could cry for you
Be a voice for two
