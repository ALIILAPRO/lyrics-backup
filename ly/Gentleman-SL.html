		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  He said that's ammi
That is ammi, but my amnes' way more potent
I wanna fly away for a moment
I wanna say I dropped four bricks in the ocean
Kit-kats forever phoning
They take a toke, and start zoning
They look at me, eyes Chinese
And say "bring me in on your potion"
Like, I was in demon bits
With some demon shanks, billing demon spliffs
And I was with a demon bitch
Doing demon shit on a demon dick
Like manna move evil wid it
Throw a pack over there, I wouldn't leave it with him (I wouldn't)
I'm tryna be peaceful with it
Got a couple problems, but I'm dealing with it
Mum said that I lost the plot, at least I never lost my crop
Last chick she pissed me off, yeah she love bitch a lot
But she does the job, I bruk it out then send it off
I don't trust a lot, there's more than what they're letting on
Nuff times I've had the cops force me to park it off
Nuff times I've seen a don, I do my dirt and laugh it off (ha)
Half hearted dons, finish what you started off
Hella chitter-chatter when I back it you'll be darting off (cutting)
Mum said "Back by ten, there's somewhere we need to go" (we need to go)
It's nine-thirty and I'm on the M-Way, I doubt I'mma make it home (pissed)
Oh no, here we go, but I'm busy bagging my cro
Gotta go to my drum, but I got buds
So let me just have a quick smoke
Manna need a bitch in my bedsheets
Fling her the twi, tell her build something hefty
Dead front, but the back came deadly
But don't watch that a nigga still done plenty
I knew this goon, way before you
Now I hear this yute wan' get me
Asked bro "should I do what I do?"
He said "roll through", bro shoulda never let me (never)

I tell a bitch "be gentle"
I'm tryna get the Willy Wonka Special
I know I ain't no gentleman
Pull up crash, and I'm wetting 'em
Dip, splash when I'm getting 'em
I'm Valley Bopping with elegance
Ching, chang, I'm a veteran
Your bitch bad? That's irrelevant

Like hello, you can call me S
You've probably heard of me
I got the pengest peng on the ends
I probably slang it out to your friends
I put in mad work for that bread
Even civilians nearly got kweffed
Weren't tryna break chip off the rassclart blem
Stepped in with the fluffiest food
Your nigga came in with his pack on mute (quiet)
Tell him put your hands in the air
Put your packs in the air, let me rob that food (let me take it)
Fresh home, I warned my goon
'Bout time man do up a few good moves (oh yeah)
And you don't even know that yute
Don't watch that, me and him soon hit booth
Custard darling, just passed it
Asked bro how could he be so foolish (foolish)
But the money keep calling (calling)
You got a bag of Kwengs but your stack's appalling
No love for an informant
I still swim deep in the opp boy waters
No love for an informant
I still swim deep in the opp boy waters
