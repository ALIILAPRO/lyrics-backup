		<p>
		  (Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy) hold up

Wait a minute
Do I gotta say whatever you want me to say?
Wait a minute, wait
What do you really want me to say to
You when you're literally in the middle

Of you telling me what to think?
Telling me what to be
(Don't even think about looking
In my vicinity)
Rawrgh, you're telling me what to
Think what you fucking think pick it up

(Why don't you just leave me to die?)
(Why don't you just leave me to die?)

Who the fuck you talkin' to?
R-R-Really don't give a fuck, don't give
A fuck about the fame, fame
Only give a fuck if you
Remember the namе, na, name
R-R-Really don't give a fuck, don't givе
A fuck about the fame, fame
Only give a fuck if you
Remember the name, na, name
