		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Shit, I went and did it again
I went and got me a ten
I went and bought me a Benz
She wanna get in Bottega
She wanna get in Bentayga
She want the latest, her lens
I need the latest FN (ayo, Oddwin)
Smokin', chillin', in the Devil's den
Bad bitch say my dick her medicine
She say, "Spread your wings 'cause you're heaven-sent"
When I speak it's biblical, a prophet
All these bitches into profits
Sex ed', baby, Nutty Professor
Chanel bags and Van Cleef on the dresser

I promise you never gon' be on my level
All that hate and that jealousy, that shit the Devil
Dig your own grave, I'll get the shovel
I get that bag for sure, I hop out the Jag' for sure
Keep me a mag' for sure, I'm havin' a blast for sure
Might blast this ho if you talk down on gang, lil' bitch
Get left in the past, love
If I pull up and hop out, lil' bitch, it's a fashion show
Glory and glam just like a diva
Don't get too close like I'm evil
No, I don't know none of these people, no
Know I'm Big Redd, keep some lil' green like holiday season
Know I'm the one to believe in
Ask your bitch, she believe it
Woo-hoo
Trust in God, you know I'm the truth
Blunt too high, in the sky on the roof
Say I'm not livin', what you talkin' 'bout, ku?
Say I'm not bangin', what you talkin' 'bout, fool?
Semi' said I wasn't even talkin' 'bout you
But you could be dead
Put it on the song, boy, I wasn't talkin' 'bout you

Shit, I went and did it again
I went and got me a ten
I went and bought me a Benz
She wanna get in Bottega
She wanna get in Bentayga
She want the latest, her lens
I need the latest FN
Smokin', chillin', in the Devil's den
Bad bitch say my dick her medicine
She say, "Spread your wings 'cause you're heaven-sent"
When I speak it's biblical, a prophet
All these bitches into profits
Sex ed', baby, Nutty Professor
Chanel bags and Van Cleef on the dresser
