		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mary, did you know 
That your Baby Boy would one day walk on water? 
Mary, did you know 
That your Baby Boy would save our sons and daughters? 
Did you know
That your Baby Boy has come to make you new? 
And this Child that you delivered will soon deliver you

Mary, did you know
That your Baby Boy will give sight to a blind man? 
Mary, did you know
That your Baby Boy will calm the storm with His hand? 
Did you know
That your Baby Boy has walked where angels trod? 
When you kiss your little Baby you kissed the face of God? 

Oh, Mary did you know 
Mary did you know 

Oh, the blind will see
The deaf will hear
The dead will live again
The lame will leap
The dumb will speak
The praises of The Lamb

Mary, did you know
That your Baby Boy is Lord of all creation? 
Mary, did you know
That your Baby Boy would one day rule the nations? 
Did you know
That your Baby Boy is heaven's perfect Lamb? 
And the sleeping Child you're holding is the Great, the Great, I Am
Mary did you know 
Mary did you know
