		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Where were you when I was lost?
When I was broke I heard my stomach talk
I remember when I broke the law
Daddy tried to give me to the cops

If I closed the door and shut my mouth
I wouldn't be here right now
If I cared what they were talkin' 'bout
I wouldn't be here right now
If I closed the door and shut my mouth
I wouldn't be here right now
If I cared what they was talkin' 'bout
I wouldn't be here right now

I was fifteen flunking out
They never let me leave the house
People saw me standing out
So niggas wanna run they mouth

If I closed the door and shut my mouth
I wouldn't be here right now
If I cared what they were talkin' 'bout
I wouldn't be here right now
If I closed the door and shut my mouth
I wouldn't be here right now
If I cared what they were talkin' 'bout
I wouldn't be here right now

These days don't approach me like
You know what I
Gave to get the trouble out my mind
Living out the luggage under my eyes
Word to my doubters on the East side

They can't hush me, They can't push me out
You can't hush me, you can't shut me out
You can't touch me, you can't touch me now
You can't touch me, you can't touch me now
You can't touch me, you can't touch me now
Without getting pat down

(You can't touch me, you can't touch me)
