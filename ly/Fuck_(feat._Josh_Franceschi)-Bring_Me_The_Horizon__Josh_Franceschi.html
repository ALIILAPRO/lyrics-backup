		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let's fuck, till the sun comes up
Because we haven't got long, but we got enough
A night to remember
A day to forget
(Don't stop till we pirouette)
I'm no saint
You're no martyr
One more night playing heart piñata
How do you say goodbye?

How do you say goodbye
When you've hardly said hello?
The only way we know
The only way we know
The only way we know
The only way we know
How do you say goodbye
When you've hardly said hello?

Let's fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck
Let's fuck till our lungs give up
(It won't be long)
A night to remember, a day to forget
If our eyes were diamonds, we'd be rich
Your voice makes my heart skip beats
So keep quiet before it quits on me
Your voice makes my heart skip beats
So keep quiet before it flat lines
Before it flat lines

I'm dead
Tell them all we're dead
We can hold the wake right here in this bed
Sunk into you, tangled in sheets
Buried in blankets six foot deep, again
Kick it

Let's fuck, till the sun comes up
Because we haven't got long, but we got enough
A night to remember, a day to forget
(Don't stop till we pirouette)

I'm no saint
You're no martyr
One more night playing heart piñata
How do you say goodbye?

How do you say goodbye
When you've hardly said hello?
How do you say goodbye
When you've hardly said hello?

Heart attacks waiting to happen
So come a little closer, tell me it's all in our heads
We're young and in love
Heart attacks waiting to happen
So come a little closer, tell me those three little words

We're young and in love
Heart attacks waiting to happen
So come a little closer, tell me it's all in our heads
We're young and in love
Heart attacks waiting to happen
So come a little closer, tell me those three little words
We're young and in love
Heart attacks waiting to happen
So come a little closer, tell me it's all in our heads
We're young and in love
Heart attacks waiting to happen
So come a little closer, tell me those three little words
