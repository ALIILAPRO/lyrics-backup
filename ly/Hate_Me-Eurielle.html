		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  He says save me, save me
She says maybe, maybe
She starts to turn away when he says
Hate me
Break me
Let me feel as hurt as you
Push me
Crush me
But promise me you'll never let us go
Hate me
Break me
Then save me, save me
Push me
Crush me
Then save me, save me
She stops walking, walking
He stops falling, falling
He looks her in the eyes and he says
Hate me
Break me
Let me feel as hurt as you
Push me
Crush me
But promise me you'll never let us go
Hate me
Break me
Then save me, save me
Push me
Crush me
Then save me, save
Hate me
Break me
Then save me, save me
Push me
Crush me
Then save me, save me
He says save me, save me
She says maybe, maybe
He says
Hate me
Break me
Let me feel as hurt as you
Push me
Crush me
But promise me you'll never let us go
Go
Go
Go
Go
