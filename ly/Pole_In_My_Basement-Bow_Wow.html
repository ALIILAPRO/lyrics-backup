		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
It's going down
Get your money out
Magic city, body tap, onyx
We gon take it all the way out west
Spearmint Rhino
Scores out in Vegas
Can't forget about tootsie diamonds in Miami
Let's go!
We gon make it storm in here tonight

[Chorus]
I got a pole in my basement
So shawty you ain't gotta go in
Shawty just come bring a friend
I got a pole in my basement
Lil mama I got ones on deck
Shawty got money to spend
Come over, over
I'm gon brake you off
Lil mama I know what you need
So mama come over over
I'm gon brake you off
Lil mama I know what you need

Bring all ya girls cause I got my niggas with me
Them niggas throwing singles, shawty be throwing fifties
Cause I'm gon make it storm, make it strom, in here, in here
Big ballas no lames in here in here, in here
Drop it left, up and down, to the floor lil mama
Throw some more cash at ya, can you do it longer?
She a bonified pro doin tricks like a magician
Got a ass like bucky so I gotta keep tipping
She definitely a ten got all the guys chasing
Shawty fuck the club I got a pole in my basement
Call me Mr. ATM cause the mama full of cash
If I run out don't worry girl I got another stash

[Chorus]

I'm gon make it Katrina
These niggas make it dizzle
I'm gon off patron
She gon off of skittles
I'm gon keep tossing money, till I can't no more
I'm gon keep tossing money, till my arm get sore
See let's play a game all u really want to know
Guard try to pick up every single dolla I throw
It might take a lil minute maybe even a hour
How bout you and ya homegirls meet me in the shower
No it ain't tricking baby girl if you got it
Plus your face is like Beyonce
Damn you a problem
Now we can do this all night girl err day
Now how you do that?
I need it's a replay
Now bring it back shawty

[Chorus]
