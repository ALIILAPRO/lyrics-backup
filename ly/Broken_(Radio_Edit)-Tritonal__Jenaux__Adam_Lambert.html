		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Before I met you woulda said I'm fine
If you asked, if you asked, if you asked me
And then you gave that word another life
Yeah you got, yeah you got, yeah you got me

I wore the pain on my face
Hoping someday it would fade
You know how to wash it away
Oh you do it
I wear the smile that you gave me
Won't take it off if you paid me
I wouldn't say that you saved me
But the truth is

Right when we met
You made me forget
That my heart was ever
Bro-broken
Looking at me
You wouldn't believe
That my heart was ever
Bro-broken

Before I met you I wouldn't sleep alone
But it felt, but it felt, but it felt like it
I moved my body, but my chest was stone
Couldn't break, couldn't break, couldn't break it

I wore the pain on my face
Hoping someday it would fade
You know how to wash it away
Oh you do it
I wear the smile that you gave me
Won't take it off if you paid me
I wouldn't say that you saved me
But the truth is

Right when we met
You made me forget
That my heart was ever
Bro-broken
Looking at me
You wouldn't believe
That my heart was ever
Bro-broken

Bro-broken

Only you can make me forget that my
Heart's been broke
You got me feeling like
Only you can make me forget that my
Heart was ever broken
Bro-broken

Right when we met
You made me forget
That my heart was ever
Bro-broken
Looking at me
You wouldn't believe
That my heart was ever
Bro-broken

Bro-broken
