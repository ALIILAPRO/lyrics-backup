		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They took away my strength and love 
It feels like going off the radar
The fire is gone, the blood is cold
I can't be seen by my Creator

I barely hear my feelings fly
Around me, like the phantom pains work 
No access to them if I try
Last virus just erased all passwords

I feel just like an empty shell
That's roaming all around sin city
I went four thousand steps thru hell
The throne of sleepless nights I will see

I'm gathering my latest shout
And emptying my source of power
I'll make my signal reach Him now
The distance will just be devoured

My body's mass will disappear
A nervous zigzag heart pulse, foregoes
I'll scream myself Oh, can't you hear? 
A wandering soul's main source code.
