		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Trailers for sale or rent,
Rooms to let, 50 cents,
No phone, no pool, no pets,
Ain't got no cigarettes, ah but
Two hours of pushing broom
Buys an 8 by 12 four-bit room
He's a man of means by no means
King of the road.

Third box car midnight train
Destination bangor, maine
Old worn-out suits and shoes,
Don't pay no union dues.
He smokes old stogies he has found
Short, but not too big around
He's a man of means by no means
King of the road

(He knows) every engineer on every train
All of their children and all of their names
And every hang-out in every town
Every lock that ain't locked
When no one's around.

I say, trailers for sale or rent,
Rooms to let - 50 cents,
No phone, no pool, no pets,
Ain't got no cigarettes.
I've got two hours of pushing broom
Buys an 8 by 12 four-bit room
He's a man of means by no means
King of the road [Repeat: x4]
