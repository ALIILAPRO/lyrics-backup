		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There are times when I don't know where I stand (woah, sometimes)
You make me feel like I'm a boy and not a man (woah, sometimes)
There are times when you don't give me a smile (woah, sometimes)
I lie awake at night and worry for a while (woah, woah)

It's okay, 'cause I know
You shine even on a rainy day
And I can find your halo
Guides me to wherever you fall
If you need a hand to hold
I'll come running, because
You and I won't part 'til we die
You should know
We see eye to eye, heart to heart

There are times when I cry, 'cause you shed no tears (woah, sometimes)
Your mind's so far away, but your body's right here (woah, sometimes)
There are times when I just walked out your door (woah, sometimes)
And thought I'd never get to see you anymore (woah, woah)

It's okay, 'cause I know
You shine even on a rainy day
And I can find your halo
Guides me to wherever you fall
If you need a hand to hold
I'll come running, because
You and I won't part 'til we die
You should know
We see eye to eye, heart to heart

Woah
Woah (woah, sometimes)
Woah
Woah 

Wherever you fall
If you need a hand to hold
I'll come running, because
You and I won't part till we die
You should know
We see eye to eye, heart to heart

I can find your halo
Guides me to wherever you fall
