		  Let's begin now

(360)

I woke up this morning and I said
You know instead of waitin' for a good day to happen, you know
Waitin' around through up's and down's, you know 

(I just said, look) We're gonna have
We're gonna have
We're gonna have a good day
And all my homies gonna ride today
And all these mommies look fly today
And all we wanna do is get by today
Heyyy
We're gonna have a good day
And ain't nobody gotta cry today
'Cause ain't nobody gonna die today
You save that drama for another day
Heyyy we're gonna have a good day

Hairline fresh, new cologne on
Feelin' so good changed the color to my phone
Orange kool-aid go good with patron
A naw hell naw boy still my ring tones
Free car wash had to clean up the Dodge
Get back when I can just playin' my part
Church folk had a fish fry
Mustard, hot sauce, light bread, and french fries
Love for the big guy
Hit the park, boys showin' off their hops
Nappy Roots on the radio and you know it bops
Last night I hit the pick tree bought some Air Force ones
Four tall tees man I'm lovin' bein' a G

We're gonna have a good day
And all my homies gonna ride today
And all these mommies look fly today
And all we wanna do is get by today
Heyyy
We're gonna have a good day
And ain't nobody gotta cry today
'Cause ain't nobody gonna die today
You save that drama for another day
Heyyy we're gonna have a good day

We're gonna have a good day
And I ain't finna worry bout what nobody say
I'm still above ground that's the reason I pray
Got my car cleaned up now I'm ready to play
Make a call to the sticks say I'm headin' dat way
Heard my cousin cookin' out I gotta get me a plate
Got this new outfit ain't even out in the States
So if they ain't speakin' to soon but this is a hell of a day
And these Dickies got me sittin' in a hell of a place
Got my stunna shades on and a grin on my face
My grill looks mean but I swear I'm straight
And the hood showin' love so I'm a okay

We're gonna have
We're gonna have
We're gonna have a good day
And all my homies gonna ride today
And all these mommies look fly today
And all we wanna do is get by today
Heyyy
We're gonna have a good day
And ain't nobody gotta cry today
'Cause ain't nobody gonna die today
You save that drama for another day
Heyyy we're gonna have a good day

We might as well do what the children sayin'
Take the day off hit park and just hang
Barbeque, roll a few and put up your dukes
And if it's beef, put the peace up and put down your dukes
It's time to change our ways
So we can save the day
For the children sake and make a better place to play
And if it's all good break out your group and grip your wood
And if you ridin' dirty just light your spliff and blow your
But do it real big exactly like a player should
Enjoy your twentyfour's, do your thang and rep your hood
The world is all yours
But still we all bound forever
In a day the choice you make is relly all fine

We're gonna have a good day
And all my homies gonna ride today
And all these mommies look fly today
And all we wanna do is get by today
Heyyy
We're gonna have a good day
And ain't nobody gotta cry today
'Cause ain't nobody gonna die today
You save that drama for another day
Heyyy we're gonna have a good day

And all my homies gonna ride today
And all these mommies look fly today
And all we wanna do is get by today
Heyyy
We're gonna have a good day
And ain't nobody gotta cry today
'Cause ain't nobody gonna die today
You can save that drama for another day
Heyyy
We're gonna have a good day
