		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yo!
Thanks for the party
And the maserati
You all rock my body
And now I'm gone
Bye!

Thanks for the party
The Moet, the girls,
The front row tickets
Yeah
Goodbye!

Thanks for the party
And the paparazzi
Everybody knows it
Now I'm embarrassed!

Thanks for the party
The house, the girls, the breasts,
And, oh yeah,
Doing my laundry

I wanna testify
I was not notified
When did my mother start
Buggin' out n' getting high
I wanna take a chance
Deep in your underpants
All my little girls
Everybody kiss my ass

[Chorus]
Bomb! Bomb this track!
Disrespect!
No regrets!
Bomb this track!

Yo!
Thanks for the party
And the maserati
You all rock my body
And now I'm gone
Bye!

Thanks for the party
The Moet, the girls,
The front row tickets
Yeah
Goodbye!

I wanna testify
I was not notified
When did my mother start
Buggin' out n' getting high
I wanna take a chance
Deep in your underpants
All my little girls
Everybody kiss my ass

[Chorus]

All my strong little ladies
We've never called you ladies
Least that's what happens when you take what they is givin baby

All my homies mommy's
We're never very lucky
Because we're stranded-

Come prepare yourself for stormy weather
Get behind me baby
We came to screw you baby
Don't you know that they is reelin' while I'm talkin' baby

All my strong little ladies
We've never called you ladies
Least that's what happens when you take what they is givin' baby

[Chorus]

Take off your clothes and I will never go home [Repeat x5]

Yo!
Thanks for the party
And the maserati
You all rock my body
And now I'm gone
Bye!

Thanks for the party
The Moet, the girls,
The front row tickets
Yeah
Goodbye!

Thanks for the party
And the paparazzi
Everybody knows it
Now I'm embarrassed!

Thanks for the party
The house, the girls, the breasts,
And, oh yeah,
Doing my laundry
