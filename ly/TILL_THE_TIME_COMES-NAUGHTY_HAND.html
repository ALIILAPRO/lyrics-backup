		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  like an angel with cruel hearted
you stand alone
upon the unfairness
the blue air is blow
pierce our bones
but you still fight
for your future
For your dreams


slowly
your curiosity
makes you stronger
sharp gaze
blinded heart for the destiny
which waiting for


till the time comes
you will flap your wings
brings you to the future
Brings you to the future


like an angel with sharp gaze
you will fly through the unfairness
with a smolders spirit Fall asleep
after the long time
In the suffering

Just by case
in a dream
you wake up

like an angel with cruel hearted
you stand alone upon the unfairness
the blue air is blow
stab your bones
but you still fighting
for your future
For your dream

like an angel with sharp gaze
you will fly thru the unfairness
with an embers spirit
Fall asleep after so long time
In the suffering
Just by case in a dream,  you wake up,


slowly
your curiosity makes you be stronger
sharp gaze
blinded the heart for the destiny
which waiting for



Reef :

till the time comes
you will flap your wings
brings you to the future


Breakdown :

like an angel with sharp gaze
you will fly thru the unfairness
with an spirit
Fall asleep after so long time
In the suffering

Just by case
in a dream
you wake up
