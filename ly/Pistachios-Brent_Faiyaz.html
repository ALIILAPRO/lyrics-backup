		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If we make love tonight
Will it change us for the rest of our lives
If we make love tonight
For the very first time
If we make love tonight

Same city, same hoes, can't move sour 
At this hour, it's 4 AM with you, now, what? (It's 'bout to go down)
Yeah, you left your crew, now, what? (It's 'bout to go down)
Shorty, what do you wanna do? 
Diss my hood y'all already know, can't move sour
He ain't try to rob me, he just thought it
But he shouldn't have even startin', now that boy a target
Nigga, is you retarded? 

(Uh) half-a-milli' on my ride
One of my cribs like three-point-five
I'm only there sometimes when I'm on that side

Weather like minus fifty on my pinkie (it's cold)
It's like minus eighty on my lady (so froze)
That's minor shit when you a major (you know)
I design the shit, I make the labels
NUWO on my body, Illimatado start the party
With you, she bein' guarded, with me she gettin' naughty
Ride it like a Harley, see them eyes getting starry
Lookin' like you want it, flick it, it last longer

Nigga, is you retarded? 

(Don't sweat, no runnin')
