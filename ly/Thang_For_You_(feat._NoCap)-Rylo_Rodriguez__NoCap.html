		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I guess you wonder where I've been
I searched to find a love within
I came back to let you know
Got a thing for you and I can't let go
(I guess you wonder where I've been)
(I searched to find a love within)
(I came back to let you know)
(Got a thing for you and I can't let go)

Knowin' I wasn't the only nigga you was fucking with
We goin' OT and comin' back, thinking we locked in, but still
You had let another nigga come and get you pregnant
I was hopin' one day me and you could have a kid, for real
Seen you rock the Carti', know you really worth a Richard Mille
We was in the condo, now I see you 'bout to get a crib
About that dollar mondo, probably why you never took me serious
Put it in her mouth and she ain't take it out, she on her period
After all we been through, we gotta go our separate ways now
Soon as I send you flight, you took a picture of the shuttle
Tryna depart your plane, you go to the baggage claim
Had the driver waiting for you at the lower level
Don't listen to them hoes, they lyin', you should know better
You should know them hoes be just fans, like Coachella
Comin' on demand, every time we fuck, we need a remote
Fly you out to France, we be tryna learn a different lingo
Got friends who went around the world for love
And they couldn't never find what they dreamed of
Mesmerized knowin' it ain't right, but that shit feel good
Sayin' I won't fuck with you no more, I probably still would
Pay your car note for a year straight and we head out on a lil' date, and we gon' fuck at her place
Go sleep with your friends, let her show off for her birthday
Just 'cause I ain't got you don't mean that I forgot you

Wonder where you been, who you've been with
Wonder where you been, who you've been with
Wonder where you been, who you've been with
Wonder where you been, who you've been with
Wonder where you been, who you've been with
Wonder where you been, who you've been with
Lowkey thinkin', "Where is you? And who's been with you?"

Who gives a fuck if all your friends not acceptin' me?
We traveled all around the world, like fuck a referee
I heard you took a trip to London just to go to the mall
You heard I took a couple backstreets just to get to the block
I think I should let you know
I got a thing for you, I can't let go
Every time I went to jail, you was down to ride
So I feel when I free up, we should sit courtside
You know your heart a tool, hope you don't let nobody use you
That Cartier cool, but you deserve a Franck Muller
I'm tryna love you, girl, I don't know what the fuck you used to
(I'm tryna love you, girl, I don't know what the fuck you used to)
You forever my shine
It's dark when you ain't here 'cause they ain't thuggin' you right
You can leave, not insecure 'long as you home by tonight
You got the best brain, I hope you never look for advice
You find your way home, a million times you told me goodbye
You find your way home, a million times you told me you out
You find your way home, so many times you told me you're done
You find your way home, so many times I told you to run
(I guess you wonder where I've been)
You find your way home, so many times I told you to run
(I searched to find a love within)
If your love was Codeine, I'd sip it 'til I fall over
I ran up my money, they told me ballin' brings closure
But somebody lied, I looked around, I'm still broken
I may not see you, I took too many of your doses

I guess you wonder where I've been
I searched to find a love within
I put you through a bunch of shit, but we gon' die real
Get high up in these hills, and take you out them high heels
Not trusted but I'm on you, so how that make you feel?
Alone in Miami at 3AM, I wish that you was here

I guess you wonder where I've been
Wonder where you been, who you've been with
Wonder where you been, who you've been with
Wonder where you been, who you've been with
Lowkey thinkin', "Where is you? And who's been with you?"
I came back to let you know
Got a thing for you and I can't let go
