		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How many cold vitriolic gazes
Before these signs of wear will show?

Did I ever reach out begging for crumbs?
Are you here in my head? You know what I want

Say you're building me up, but tearing me down
And I don't want fame, I don't want a crown

If that's what it takes, I don't want a part
To jump when they say, it's not what I want

I'm one of the people they never let breathe
Different people, unable to breathe

Did I ever reach out asking your view?
Your redundant thoughts on what I should do

Say you're building me up, but tearing me down
And I don't want fame, I don't want a crown

And the things that you crave are not in my heart
If you're here in my head now, you see what I want

It's every time
It's every time
Every time
I try
It's every time
I try
