		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Those winter days
Have gone away but
I'm still cold

The heat we made
Has gone away and
It don't feel the same

I had you in my arms to sleep
And now you're hard to reach (yeah)
I'll only see you every night
In my dreams

As night falls down
I feel my heart missing your part of me
And everything in-between
Now they're just memories (yeah)

I had you in my arms to sleep
And now you're hard to reach (yeah)
I'll only see you every night
In my dreams
