		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's nice to spend the time with you
I know you've got a lot to go for
I like the things you say and do
And yet what do I have to show for
Nice to pass away
Then another break of day

Lovin',
Lovin', lovin' or leavin'
I'm for lovin', lovin' or leavin'
Lovin', lovin' or leavin'
I said lovin', lovin' or leavin' yeah...

We play the old familiar game
Cause life is short, let's keep on movin'
It's fun alright, but just the same
There's more to it then all that showed
All the things come to
I know it will, and so do you

Lovin',
Lovin', lovin' or leavin'
I said lovin', lovin' or leavin'
Lovin', lovin' or leavin'
I said lovin', lovin' or leavin' yeah...

So that's the way I really feel
I want you badly, oh...we know

Lovin', (ah)
Lovin', lovin' or leavin' (yeah)
Lovin', lovin' or leavin' (yeah...i'll tell you)
Lovin', lovin' or leavin' (hear me)
Lovin', lovin' or leavin'
Lovin', lovin' or leavin' (sock it to me)
Lovin', lovin' or leavin' (yeah)
Lovin', lovin' or leavin' (yeah)
Lovin', lovin' or leavin' (yeah...i'll tell you)
Lovin', lovin' or leavin' (hear me)
Lovin', lovin' or leavin'
Lovin', lovin' or leavin' (sock it to me)
Lovin'...
