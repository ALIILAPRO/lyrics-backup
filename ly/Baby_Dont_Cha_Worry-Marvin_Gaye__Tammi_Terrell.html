		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When the dawn comes over the mountain
And when the valley is filled with dew
Don't worry, baby, baby, don't cha worry
Because I'm coming home to you
Yes, I'm coming home

When the moon rises to kiss the stars above
And when it sets deep in the blue
Don't worry, baby, don't cha worry
Because I'm home, I'm coming home to you
Yes, I'm coming home

Don't worry about me
I still care
Don't worry about me, baby
'Cause I'll be there

I still love you and I always will
Till my life is over, baby, baby
Till time stand still
Till time stand still

Don't worry about me
I'll still love you, baby
Don't worry about me, baby
I'm gonna stick right by your side, baby

I said don't, don't, don't
Don't worry about me
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't
Baby, don't cha worry, ain't goin' to worry
Because I, I, I, I, I
I still love you baby, I love you baby
I said, no, no, no, no, no
