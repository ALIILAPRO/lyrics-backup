		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wanna be hot all the time
To remind you
You'll never be mine
Get what I want and fucking thrive
To remind you I'm still alive

Fantasies of when I taste
The teardrops on your face
It gets me high, high
That's just the icing on the cake
Baby I, I wanna be hot all the time

Does it sting for you? (I)
When I sing for you? (I)
Does it torture you? (I)
Ooh, I wanna be hot all the time, oh

I wanna be hot all the time
Just to make your blood turn to fire
I wanna be young
I wanna be wild
All the things you didn't like

Does it sting for you? (I)
When I sing for you? (I)
Does it torture you? (I)
Ooh, I wanna be hot all the time, oh

I, I wanna be hot all the time, oh
I, I wanna be hot all the time, oh

I'll break your heart like you've broken mine
Cross my heart and I hope to die
Without you, without you
Feels so damn good in my skin, so hot in the state I'm in
Without you, without you

Does it sting for you? (I)
When I sing for you? (I)
Does it torture you? (I)
Ooh, I wanna be hot all the time
