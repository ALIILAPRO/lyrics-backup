		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What's up guys, today, I got Desert Eagle, .50 caliber
And ATV, we gonna blow it up fifty-thousand frames per second
(Narsaye)
Super slow motion (load 'em up, ski)
It's gonna look amazing (skee, yeah)

She can't take me home (yeah), her dad is from Iran (from Iran, yeah)
I got a brick of Heroin from Pakistan (yes, yeah, yeah)
I ain't buy that bitch no bag, I bought my killers firearms (firearms, ski, ski)
Burners from Russia, Louis V from Milan (ski, ski, ski, ski)
Mm-mm (mm), pussy like a work of art (ski, ski, ski, ski)
Mm-mm (mm), wetter than the Noah's Ark (ski, ski, ski, ski)
Mm-mm (yeah), I can fly you very far (ski)
Bentley truck on the main road (ski), diamonds taste like a rainbow (ski) 

I'm in my own world right now (yeah), I'm in my hotel right now (yeah)
I think all these hoes are drunk, so, I got no mail right now (no)
Yes, my lady make my dick hard, make it count in fifties
I just linked up with my gipsy
And I'm really movin', Big Meech
Mm-mm, check out the score, check out the scoreboard
Mm-mm, she wanna fuck raw, but, she got morals (uh-uh, ah)
My nigga shootin' like a porno
Whippin' crack, he got four phones
He can't keep that door closed (yeah)
Emirates, I fly with niggas, feelin' generous (mm-hmm)
Nicknames on fly, 'cause we're fuckin' regulars (mm-hmm)
I'm sellin' white, yes, it's Ellen the DeGeneres
Let's take a trip to Pakistan, we can benefit (yeah, ski)

She can't take me home, her dad is from Iran (ski, ski, ski, ski, ski)
I got a brick of Heroin from Pakistan (ski, ski, ski ha, ha, ha)
I ain't buy that bitch no bag, I bought my killers firearms (ha-ha, ha, ha, ha)
Burners from Russia (ha), Louis V from Milan (ha, ha, ha)
Mm-mm (mm), pussy like a work of art (brrt, mm)
Mm-mm, wetter than the Noah's Ark (brrt)
Mm-mm (ski, ski), I can fly you very far (far)
Bentley truck on the main road, diamonds taste like a rainbow (ski, ski)

Yo, these hoes treat me like the president (ski, ski, ski)
My Rollie a Presi' too
My spinner came with only six, tryna buy some extra shoes
They think I'm rappin' cappin'
On God, I still got the mashes packin'
She ain't seen no gun before, fifty racks in cash, don't look in the bag
Can't get my G-lock, so, we just grab the fours
Built my own line in the hood, like, who am I trappin' for?
Missionary my Taurus one, but, doggy-style my Capricorn
Calls me a, "Dog," I told her, "Save my number as Labrador"
And when Celene dropped, "New Season," shit, I cop it fast
Her not givin' me a second chance, not a chance
Fake friends, conspiracy cases and petrol baths
My burner from Russia, my Louis V was born in France (yeah)

She can't take me home, her dad is from Iran (from Iran)
I got a brick of Heroin from Pakistan (Pakistan)
I ain't buy that bitch no bag, I bought my killers firearms (ski, ski, woo)
Burners from Russia, Louis V from Milan (ski, ski, woo)
Mm-mm (woo), pussy like a work of art (woo)
Mm-mm (woo), wetter than the Noah's Ark (woo)
Mm-mm (woo), I can fly you very far (ooh)
Bentley truck on the main road, diamonds taste like a rainbow (ski, ski, ski, ski, ski, brr)
