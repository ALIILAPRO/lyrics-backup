		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You've got thelove 
You've got the power 
But you just don't understand 
Girl, you've been charging by the hour 
For your love 

I'm tryin' to show how much I love you 
Still believe in romance 
You're taking way too many chances 
With my love 

I remember 
When you used to be 
The talk of the town 
All you get is lonely 

Turn your love around 
Don't you turn me down 
I can show you how 
Turn your love around 

Without the woman I can make it 
But I need the girl to stay 
Oh, don't you let the lady take it 
Away 
When all I need's a taste of yesterday 
But you stay at home 
All they get is lonely 

Turn your love around 
Don't you turn me down 
I can show you how 
Turn your love around 

Oh girl you know me 
I'm alone until you show me 
That you're still in love with me 
We're gonna make it 
We're gonna take it 
Back where we belong 

Turn your love around 
Don't you turn me down 
I can show you how 
Turn your love around 

Turn your love around 
This time the girl became a woman 
Don't you turn me down 
Every woman needs a man 
I can show you how 
I love the girl, I love the woman 
Turn your love around 

Turn your love around 
This time the girl became a woman 
Don't you turn me down 
Every woman needs a man 
I can show you how 
I love the girl, I love the woman 
Turn your love around 

Turn your love around 
This time the girl became a woman 
Don't you turn me down 
Every woman needs a man 
I can show you how 
fade out
