		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I said baby you been looking real good
You know that I remember when we met
It's funny how I never felt so good 
It's a feeling that I know I know I'll never forget
Ooh it was the best time I can remember
Ooh and the love we shared
Lovin' that'll last forever

There wasn't much in this heart of mine
But there's a little left and babe you found it
It's funny how I never felt so high
It's a feeling that I know I know I'll never forget
Ooh, it was the best time I can remember
Ooh and the love we shared
Lovin' that'll last forever

I think about you
Honey you're the time my heart says yes
I think about you
Deep inside I love you best
I think about you
You know you're the one I want
I think about you
Darling you're the only one, I think about you
Yeah, hahaha

I think about you you know that I do
I think about you all alone only you
I think about you
Ooh its true
I think about you, yes I do

Somethin' changed in this heart of mine
You know I'm so glad that you showed me
Honey, now you're my best friend
I want to stay together 'til the very end

Oh, it was the best time, I can remember
Oh, and the love we shared
Is lovin' that'll last forever

I think about you
Honey, all the time, my heart says yes
I think about you
Deep inside, I love you best
I think about you
You know you're the one I want
I think about you
Darling, you're the only one
I think about you, oh oh yeah
I think about you, oh you
I think about you, woah
Only you
I think about you, you know I do
I think about you, only you
I think about you
Only you
Only
You
Only
