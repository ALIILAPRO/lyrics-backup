		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Look, I know the supernatural
Is something that isn't supposed to happen
But it does happen

Yeah, Jesus lived his life in a cheap hotel
On the edge of Route 66, yeah
He lived a dark and twisted life
And he came right back just to do it again
Eye for and eye and a tooth for a truth
I ain't never seen a demon warp dealin'
A ring-a-ding rhythm or jukebox racket
My mind can't clutch the feeling, yeah

Devil man, devil man, calling devil man
Running in my head, yeah
Devil man, devil man, calling devil man
Running in my head, yeah

Hell hounds lead at the cowardly kings
And carry souls across the river Styx, yeah
They see no evil and feel no pain
Sucking juice from a fallen angel
I dreamed I was a supernova fucker nitro
Burning and fuel injection
Feed the gods a strychnine soul
A motherfucker of invention

Devil man, devil man, calling devil man
Running in my head, yeah
Devil man, devil man, calling devil man
Running in my head, yeah

Insipientia corde suo, non es deus
Non esta vita qui adorem, non es usque ad unum
Es excommunicatus, ex unione fidelium

It is not heresy, and I will not recant

Yeah, inbreed the witches and worship the dogs
Deformed and fucking lazy
Damn yourself and choke on my name
I'd love to love ya baby
Dead ringer rats swinging in the trees
Immaculate conception, bury me an angel
God I need some inspiration

Yeah
Devil man, devil man, calling devil man
Running in my head, yeah
Devil man, devil man, calling devil man
Running in my head, yeah
