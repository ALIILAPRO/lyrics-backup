		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't know really what I'm looking for
And don't mind dancing here all on my own
But then I see you standing on the wall
Now all I want to is to get you all alone

Tryin' my best to be honest
Don't wanna break any promise
But what if this shit is love

Don't wanna start any carnage
This ain't a time to be modest
But what if this shit is love?

Can I can I get your number tonight oh huh
If I don't then I might regret it for the re-
The rest of my life

See I see I got you feeling my vibe oh huh
Gotta hurry and make a move
There's no time to be wasting time

Can I can I get your oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Can I can I get your oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Uh

Feel like I have seen you here before
Somethin' 'bout you make me feel at home
Don't take it slow come give me what I want
And all I want to is to get you all alone

I'm tryin' my best to be honest
Don't wanna break any promise
But what if this shit is love

Don't wanna start any carnage
This ain't a time to be modest
But what if this shit is love?

Can I can I get your number tonight oh huh
If I don't then I might regret it for the re-
The rest of my life

See I see I got you feeling my vibe oh huh
Gotta hurry and make a move
There's no time to be wasting time

Can I can I get your oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Can I can I get your oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Uh

What you say
When we're face to face
I wanna see
What the conversation do
Ah ah ah ah
Let's run away
No time to waste another day
'Cause I wanna be with you

Can I can I get your number tonight oh huh
If I don't then I might regret it for the re-
The rest of my life

See I see I got you feeling my vibe oh huh
Gotta hurry and make a move
There's no time to be wasting time

Can I can I get your number, nu-nu-nu-nu-number
Can I can I get your number, nu-nu-nu-nu-number
Can I can I get your number, nu-nu-nu-nu-number
Can I can I get your number, nu-nu-nu-nu-number
