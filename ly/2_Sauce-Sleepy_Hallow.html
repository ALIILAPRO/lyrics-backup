		  Ayy
She said she don't love me, why she still get naked?
I'm a bodmon 
Look, hol' on, look, huh
(Great John on the beat by the way)

I'm feeling way, way too saucy, (too sauce) too sauce
Hopped out the Wraith, hopped in the Porsche (hopped in the Porsche)
New Porsche, and it's racin' (and it's racin'), huh
She said she don't love me, why she still get naked? (She still get naked)
I'm a bodmon, baby, I'm Jamaican (I'm Jamaican)

Yeah (hol' on)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Tonight, we don't give a fuck
Tonight, we don't really care, hol' on
Yeah (aight bet), huh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Tonight, we don't give a fuck
Tonight, we don't really care, hol' on, huh

Wait 
I'm tryna bleed the block, huh
I know you heard the shots
I be buggin', tryna murder opps, ayy
I got 'em itchin' to flock
When you see me you better move hot
You know who call the shots
From the bottom, but now we on top, huh
How is you still sleep? Now they lovin', used to hate me, huh
And my kicks clean, ain't nobody ever had these, uh
Crackin', huh, no lackin', know I pack it
Can't have it, huh, you know we super savage
(Wait, wait, hol' on, hol' on)

I'm feeling way, way too saucy, (too sauce) too sauce
Hopped out the Wraith, hopped in the Porsche (hopped in the Porsche)
New Porsche, and it's racin' (and it's racin'), huh
She said she don't love me, why she still get naked? (She still get naked)
I'm a bodmon, baby, I'm Jamaican (I'm Jamaican)

Yeah 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Tonight, we don't give a fuck
Tonight, we don't really care, hol' on
Yeah (aight bet), huh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Tonight, we don't give a fuck
Tonight, we don't really care

(Wait, huh, woah)
Yeah, huh, ask your bitch, she know, huh
Ask your sis, she know
I get high while she get low, yeah, hol' on, wait
I still keep a pole, huh
I'm still on the road
Red lights, we still on go, yeah, wait, huh
Brand new whip, let's race, huh
Brand new ice, let's skate
She so wet, I'm in a lake, yeah, huh, hol' on, huh
And that's on gang, we spray, huh
That's on gang, we paid
We count racks all through the day, yeah, hol' on, huh
And grandma told me save
But I told grandma, "I can't take this money to the grave," yeah

(Yeah, huh)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Tonight we don't give a fuck
Tonight we don't really care

I'm feeling way, way too saucy, (too sauce) too sauce
Hopped out the Wraith, hopped in the Porsche (hopped in the Porsche)
New Porsche, and it's racin' (and it's racin'), huh
She said she don't love me, why she still get naked? (She still get naked)
I'm a bodmon, baby, I'm Jamaican (I'm Jamaican)

Yeah 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Tonight, we don't give a fuck
Tonight, we don't really care, hol' on
Yeah (aight bet), huh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Tonight, we don't give a fuck
Tonight, we don't really care
