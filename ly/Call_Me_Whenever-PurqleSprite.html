		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh
Oh

I told her she could call me whenever (Right), no matter the weather (Alright)
I'm fallin' apart, I need to get it together (Alright)
You lie, you lie, when you say it's forever (Right)
Can't lie, I'm high, it ain't gettin' no better (Alright)
I gave her all of my effort (Right), she say it's whatever (Alright)
I should've put effort in findin' somebody better (Alright)
Now I'm hung like a hook, sing this song forever (Right)
No pun intended with these words, I'm a little too clever, hey
I'm in her bushes while she walk home
I'm her secret admirer, stalker's such a strong term
I'm in your bedroom when you're not home
Love is obsession, when the hell will I learn?
You never meant to hurt me, right?
I hope that that's what you're thinkin'
You say you got a new man, right?
I have to make him go missin'
I don't know what the fuck I was thinkin'
Narcotic nonsense, I'm tweakin'
There's a hole in my heart, that shit leakin'
Just hold me close and heal the pain
I told her she could call me whenever (Right), no matter the weather (Alright)
I'm fallin' apart, I need to get it together (Alright)
You lie, you lie, when you say it's forever (Right)
Can't lie, I'm high, it ain't gettin' no better (Alright)
I gave her all of my effort (Right), she say it's whatever (Alright)
I should've put effort in findin' somebody better (Alright)
Now I'm hung like a hook, sing this song forever (Right)
No pun intended with these words, I'm a little too clever, hey
I'm hung, I'm hung, I'm young, I'm dumb
In love, I'm sprung, can't hold my tongue
Want a shout out to my fans, I know you worry
In my Instagram comments askin' who hurt me
I'm in my feelings over bitches that were doin' me dirty
I can still see your shadows in my room, baby
You just hit me the other day, a little too flirty
I know you don't want me, you want my money, honey
But you can't put a price on love, oh
You can't put a price on us
I told her she could call me whenever (Right), no matter the weather (Alright)
I'm fallin' apart, I need to get it together (Alright)
You lie, you lie, when you say it's forever (Right)
Can't lie, I'm high, it ain't gettin' no better (Alright)
I gave her all of my effort (Right), she say it's whatever (Alright)
I should've put effort in findin' somebody better (Alright)
Now I'm hung like a hook, sing this song forever (Right)
No pun intended with these words, I'm a little too clever, hey
