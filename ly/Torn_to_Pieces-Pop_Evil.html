		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here I sit all alone like an airplane
On the edge of a sky full of solid gray
Staring at the ceiling, tell me that I'm dreaming
Oh, I wish you were here today
All these days I know I'll never get back
All these words I know I wish I should've said
All these dreams that we had now fade to black
Try to wash it away

I'm torn to pieces, I'm broken down
I still see your face when you're not around
I sit here in misery wondering if I'll ever be
Half the man you wanted me to be

Here I float through the air like a waterfall
Than I sink to the bottom like a cannonball
Having trouble breathing, suddenly I'm screaming
Why wasn't I good enough
Even though I know you're not gonna come back
I can't wash it away

I'm torn to pieces, I'm broken down
I still see your face when you're not around
I sit here in misery wondering if I'll ever be
Half the man you wanted me to be

I'm torn to pieces, I'm broken down
I still see your face when you're not around
I sit here in misery wondering if I'll ever be
Half the man you wanted me to be

It's tearing me to pieces
Tearing me to pieces
It's tearing me to pieces
Tearing me to pieces

Even though I know you're not gonna come back
I can't wash it away

I'm torn to pieces, I'm broken down
I still see your face when you're not around
I sit here in misery wondering if I'll ever be
Half the man you wanted me to be

I'm torn to pieces, I'm broken down
(I'm torn to pieces)
I still see your face when you're not around
(I'm torn to pieces)
I sit here in misery wondering if I'll ever be
Half the man you wanted me to be
