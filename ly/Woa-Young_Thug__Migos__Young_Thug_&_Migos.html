		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Big, body, Benz, damn
Cookies, perc-ys, mollies, Xans
Frostbite, spotlight, cheat code, G-code
Diamonds, gold, neck, whoa
Big, body, Benz, damn
Cookies, perc-ys, mollies, Xans
Frostbite, spotlight, cheat code, G-code
Diamonds, gold, neck, whoa

Pipe up this bitch
If she is basic I pipe up your bitch
Make it dark in this bitch
Don't worry 'cause I got some light on my wrist
Want to talk about dabbin'
The difference between us and them, we created that shit
Stackin' money ever since
If it ain't about money, then it don't make sense
Dope in the troop and it's two percent tint
Dope in the coochie, young pimp in this bitch
Keep it 100, I'm sick of this bitch
Never ate breakfast but eat up the grits
Hold that bitch down but she can't get the stick
Taking a trip, I'ma give her the dick
Chew it up, eat it up like it's a Twix
Most of these niggas not, they counterfeit
Go see your jeweler my nigga, you tripping
Your diamonds so little that they got me squinting
I forgot to mention you tryna get a verse from me
Then I'm gonna have to charge you a ten
Then I go 24 karat my kitchen
Fell asleep on drank at the house party with Diddy
Who the fuck said we ain't plugged in the city
Never mind, niggas done turned into crickets (Takeoff)

Big, body, Benz, damn
Cookies, perc-ys, mollies, Xans
Frostbite, spotlight, cheat code, G-code
Diamonds, gold, neck, whoa
Big, body, Benz, damn
Cookies, perc-ys, mollies, Xans
Frostbite, spotlight, cheat code, G-code
Diamonds, gold, neck, whoa

Pistols, hammers, AKs, bananas
Dirty, Diana, on molly, dandruff
This my propaganda, riding 'round Atlanta
I see a hundred cameras, doing shows in Alabama
I'm not your average rapper
Come to my trap, I'll tax ya
My diamonds came from Africa, like Michael Blackson
I spent 10k in Magic, two bitches fucked my fashion
They think because I'm rapping, Houdini won't do magic
Working the water, Atlantic
Money stretched out to Kansas
Big body panoramic
I told your bitch to get the dancer
Shoot a nigga, hit the canvas
Get off my grass like I'm Stanley
I'm higher than a chimpanzee
Ranked number one, my standings

Big, body, Benz, damn
Cookies, perc-ys, mollies, Xans
Frostbite, spotlight, cheat code, G-code
Diamonds, gold, neck, whoa
Big, body, Benz, damn
Cookies, perc-ys, mollies, Xans
Frostbite, spotlight, cheat code, G-code
Diamonds, gold, neck, whoa (Offset!)

Look at my diamonds, they wink and say peek-a-boo
I shock the block like I'm Pikachu
I shot the Glock, tried to kill a few
I put that dope in her dookie chute
We fuck these bitches, we switch-a-roo
I had to beat it like Michael do
I get the Sprite and I spike a deuce
I create flames when I'm in the booth
Wide, body, I'm bout to buy me an island
Dab, stylish, these not on the shelf, you can't find 'em
Ice, blind 'em, if I'm eyeing it told you I'm buying it
We together, we never divided
Like a feather I'm flier than pilots
Chew my dab up just like it is Trident
Kept it real with you niggas, we tried it
Got to hit hard and move silent
If it's bout the money then I'm riding
If you broke, need a job, I can hire you
Offset, your dab is expiring
Your pockets ain't straight, need alignment
The bando is my type of environment, bando!
