		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All of your life now you have denied
There'd be a time when you'd ever die
Still it's been rumored this thing must be

Why is it then that you act surprised
When I appear now to be your guide
Why do you hesitate to follow me

See it rising, stare and wonder
Hear it beckon you to dance
Feel it hold you, take you under
I'm your god of second chance

And now you claim you are not prepared
So much to do you can not be spared
Still your entreaties death will not hear

The graveyard is filled with important men
Who could not be spared but were in the end
And so I whisper now in your ear

See it rising, stare and wonder
Hear it beckon you to dance
Feel it hold you, take you under
I'm your god of second chance

Domine
Domine
Domine
Domine
O Domine
O Domine
O Domine
O Domine
