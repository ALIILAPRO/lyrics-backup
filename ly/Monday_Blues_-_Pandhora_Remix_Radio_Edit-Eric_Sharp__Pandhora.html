		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Monday Blues tryin’ to get you down
Let’s not talk about
Never wanna talk about

Everybody gonna let you down
Let’s not talk about
Never wanna talk about
You say that you don’t need love
Let’s not talk about
Never wanna talk about
How much longer ‘til you’ve had enough
Let’s not talk about
Never wanna talk about
We’re gonna find our way
Out of this hole we dug
Make back what we lost
Times when we gave up
We’ll never compromise
Until we’re satisfied
Through these troubled times
I’ll be by your side
Wide away in the dead of night
Let’s not talk about
Never wanna talk about
Fear chasing me through my mind
Let’s not talk about
Never wanna talk about
Hurry up it’s gonna be too late
Let’s not talk about
Never wanna talk about
It’s not enough just to be okay
Let’s not talk about
Never wanna talk about
We’re gonna find our way
Out of this hole we dug
Make back what we lost
Times when we gave up
We’ll never compromise
Until we’re satisfied
Through these troubled times
I’ll be by your side
We’re gonna find our way
Out of this hole we dug
Make back what we lost
Times when we gave up
We’ll never compromise
Until we’re satisfied
Through these troubled times
I’ll be by your side
