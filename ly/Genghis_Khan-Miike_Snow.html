		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know there's no form
And no labels to put on
To this thing we keep
And dip into when we need
And I don't have the right
To ask where you go at night
But the waves hit my head
To think someone's in your bed

I get a little bit Genghis Khan
I don't want you to get it on
With nobody else but me
With nobody else but me
I get a little bit Genghis Khan
Don't want you to get it on
With nobody else but me
With nobody else but me

And the lights, they glow
Like I just lost the World War
And the scene slips away
To the evenness I fake
It's a cheat somewhere
'Cause I don't really want you, girl
But you can't be free
'Cause I'm selfish, I'm obscene

I get a little bit Genghis Khan
I don't want you to get it on
With nobody else but me
With nobody else but me
I get a little bit Genghis Khan
Don't want you to get it on
With nobody else but me
With nobody else but me

I wanna make up my mind
But I don't know myself
No I don't know myself
I wanna make up my mind
But I don't know myself
No I don't know myself
I wanna make up my mind
But I don't know myself
No I don't know myself

I get a little bit Genghis Khan
I don't want you to get it on
With nobody else but me
With nobody else but me
I get a little bit Genghis Khan
Don't want you to get it on
With nobody else but me
With nobody else but me
