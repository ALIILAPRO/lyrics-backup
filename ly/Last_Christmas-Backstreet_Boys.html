		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (special)
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

La
La-da-da-da-da, la-la
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la

Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye
Tell me, baby, do you recognise me?
Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me
"Merry Christmas," I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying, "I love you," I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again, yeah

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away (you gave it away)
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (ohh, special)
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart (oh, last Christmas)
But the very next day, you gave it away (you gave it away)
This year, to save me from tears (I'll give it)
I'll give it to someone special (someone special)

La
La-da-da-da-da, la-la
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
Last Christmas, ohh

A crowded room, friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God, I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
A face of a lover with a fire in his heart
A man undercover, but you tore me apart (oh, yeah, yeah)
Mmh
Now I've found a real love, you'll never fool me again

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away (you gave it away)
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (I'll give it to someone special)
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart (gave you my heart)
But the very next day, you gave it away (ooh)
This year, to save me from tears (yeah)
I'll give it to someone special (ooh, yeah)
