		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Are we gonna have a problem?
Did zombies eat your brain?
You've come so far, why now, are you yanking on my chain?
I'd normally slap your face off
And everyone here could watch
But I'm feeling nice, here's some advice
Listen up, biotch

I like lookin' hot
Buying stuff they cannot
I like drinkin' hard
Maxin' Dad's credit card
I like skippin' gym
Scaring her, screwing him
I like killer clothes
Kickin' nerds in the nose

If you lack the juice
Go play Duck, Duck, Goose
Let your mommy fix you ice cream
Whoa
Or come hang with me
And tonight we'll be
Dirty dancing with the football team
Whoa, whoa, whoa

Honey, whatcha waitin' for?
Welcome to my candy store
It's time for you to prove you're not a loser anymore
Then step into my candy store

Guys fall at your feet
Pay the check, help you cheat
All you need to know
Some dead weight has to go
That freak's not your friend
I can tell in the end
If she had your shot
She would leave you to rot

'Course if you don't care
Fine, go braid her hair
Maybe Sesame Street is on
Whoa
Or forget the creep
And get in my jeep
Let's go tear up someone's lawn
See, you don't have it
Watch this

Honey, whatcha waitin' for?
Welcome to my candy store
You just gotta prove you're not a doorknob anymore
Then step into my candy store

You can join the team
Or you can bitch and moan
You can live the dream
Or you can die alone
You can fly with eagles
Or if you prefer
Keep on testing me
And end up like her
Whoa

Honey, whatcha waitin' for?
Shut up, Toni!
Step into my candy store
Time for you to prove you're not a lame ass anymore
Then step into my candy store
It's my candy store
It's my candy
It's my candy store
It's my candy
It's my candy store
It's my candy store
