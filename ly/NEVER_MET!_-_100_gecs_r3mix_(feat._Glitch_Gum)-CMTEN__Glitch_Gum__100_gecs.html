		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)

You know I missed you from the very day you went away
I feel like Laura Les, saying, "I love you" on the plane
And even though it's been a week I still think of your face
Blew all my money on a trivial video game

I dunk my head in the water so I can feel something
And now I'm thinking of all the times that my phone would ring
I reminisce and remember all of the songs we'd sing
But now I hate every one of the songs we used to sing
Can you believe that I didn't think you would leave me?
And now I can't trust anyone 'cause you just left me
I wish I never responded to all those texts
It'd be better if we had just never met

Can you believe that I'm missing you even though
When I was with you, I never felt more alone
I wish I never responded to all those texts
It'd be better if we had just never met
I wish we never met

We broke up on PictoChat, crying on my DS
I went to a birthday party for one of her friends
And now that this is over I can hate them, I don't have to pretend
Remember when I called you my Barbie, and I was Ken
That was like the cringiest thing that I've ever said
When I was with you, I just felt more alone
I just hope I'm bad enough to call about
When you're on your phone

Ha ha ha, saying I feel like Laura Les all of the time
I get way too worked up so I'm always fucking crying
Everybody thinking that you're stupid and you are
Hopelessly romantic and then take this way too far
I was just a dog, I was eating off the floor 
When I heard them knocking someone was at the door 
Wait stop knock it off 
I'm not pretty yet 
I wish we never met 

I wish we never met 
So much to forget 
I can't get over it right now 
I don't know when that will be 
I wish we never met
