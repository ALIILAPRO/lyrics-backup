		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'd meet you in wrong
Bury all, then I would be right with her
In whole, cherished by two

It makes you fly; yes, I'll lie
God, I'll even lick her fucking picture
In whole, drinks won't stain this birth

It's just me; I'm bored
Carried lung now, I could be right in her
In whole, cherished by two

It makes you fly; yes, I'll lie
Drink one more so I could go right in her
In whole, drinks won't stain this birth

It makes you fly inside
It makes you fly inside
It makes you fly inside
It makes you fly inside

In spite I want to lie
In spite I will lie

In spite, I'll still lie
In spite, I'll still lie
In spite, I'll still lie
In spite
