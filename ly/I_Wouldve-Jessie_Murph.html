		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I would've loved you
Would've stayed up all night
I could've loved you
For the rest of your life
Would've taken the cocaine off your lips
Ripped out the bottle from your fist
I would've loved you
I, I

Woke up at the bottom of my bed, the bottom, baby
Went through hell and back for you and this how you repay me?
Put two and two together, you sound motherfuckin' crazy
Switch that back to back and know you wish you pushin' daisies
Hope you fuckin' hate it

And when you walk this road alone, 'lone, 'lone
Feelin' sorry, feelin' low, low, low
It's no one's fault besides your own, own, own

I would've loved you
Would've stayed up all night
I could've loved you
For the rest of your life
Would've taken the cocaine off your lips
Ripped out the bottle from your fist
I would've loved you
I, I would've loved you

Who knew? That bitch had a screw loose
Could've had all this woo-hoo, now you're gon' fuck with this voodoo, yeah
Sideways, now I just look at you sideways
Bro, get the fuck out my driveway, you broke the window with no pain, yeah

And when you walk this road alone, 'lone, 'lone
Feeling sorry, feelin' low, low, low
It's no one's fault besides your own, own, own (no)

I would've loved you
Would've stayed up all night
I could've loved you
For the rest of your life
Would've taken the cocaine off your lips
Ripped out the bottle from your fist
I would've loved you
I, I
I would've loved you
I, I would've loved you
I, I
