		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One step at a time
That's what you told me
Just stop pretending i'm fine
I'm barely holding on too
I keep biting my tongue
Hooked on the bitter taste
Been slowly losing my grip
Fading away

Cause I keep questioning the reasons why I do this to myself?
I've been struggling to find the strength i'm begging for your help

I'm burnt out
I'm broken
These wounds i've torn open
Just can't admit that all the blame was on me

So tell me why I sabotage
Can't seem to make things last
I've burned all the bridges I need
Sick of feeling so damn low
It's like i've lost control
I've realised the problem was me

One step at a time,
That's what you told me
One step outta line
It's only natural
For me to lie and try to hide
Then criticise myself
So I keep tryna find
The reason why
I put myself through hell

I'm burnt out
I'm broken
These wounds i've torn open
Just can't admit that all the blame was on me

So tell me why I sabotage
Can't seem to make things last
I've burned all the bridges I need
Sick of feeling so damn low
It's like i've lost control
I've realised the problem was me

You've lost all your patience
That's easy to see
I've taken advantage of your sympathy
I took you for granted
I'll live to regret it
Cause you were there and you believed in me

So tell me why I sabotage
Can't seem to make things last
I've burned all the bridges I need
Sick of feeling so damn low
It's like I've lost control
I've realised the problem was me

Cause i'm in too deep
And i've lost my way
I can't find myself or the words to say
That i'm so sorry for the pain it's all so clear to me

I've realised the problem was me

I'm burnt out
I'm broken
These wounds i've torn Open
Can't change the fact the only constant is me

So tell me why I sabotage
Can't seem to make things last
I've burned all the bridges I need
Sick of feeling so damn low
It's like i've lost control
I've realised the problem was me

You've lost all your patience
That's easy to see
But you were there for me

So tell me why I sabotage
Can't seem to make things last
I've realised the problem was me
