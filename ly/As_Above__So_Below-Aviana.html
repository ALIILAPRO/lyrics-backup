		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lock the gates and throw away the key
Hope that I will stay the same
Shed your skin when eyes look other ways
Left to be unfound, all bad
Your promise to bring me on my knees
Fighting for life in the darkness

It was a song well sung of life of love but you tore the walls down
I tried to get back up
But I keep on falling down
You made me lose my mind and I can’t run away this time

I’m awake
I’m wide awake
(I’m) out of faith
I’m out of faith
(I’m) with no way to go
As above, so below

Show me pain to make me feel again
Return me to heaven
I’ll stay the same
As above, so below

(As above)
(As above)
(As above)
(As above)
(As above)
(As above)

As above, so below

My promise to keep you on your feet
Living a life in the sunrise

It was the melody I made of life and love and I built the house up
You always pull me up
But I keep on falling down
You made me loose my mind and I can’t run away

I’m awake
I’m wide awake
(I’m) out of faith
I’m out of faith
(I’m) with no way to go
As above, so below

Show me pain to make me feel again
Return me to heaven
I’ll stay the same
As above, so below

As above, so below
There's no escaping what's coming for you
As above, so below

I’m awake
I’m wide awake
I’m out of faith
I’m out of faith
I’m with no way to go

You’re alone
You’re all alone
Without a choice
No other choice
You lived too slow
As above

So show me pain to make me feel again
Return me to heaven
I’ll stay the same
As above, so below

(As above)
(As above)
(As above)
(As above)
(As above)
(As above)
As above, so below

My promise to keep you on your feet
You’ll stand your ground from above
As above, so below
