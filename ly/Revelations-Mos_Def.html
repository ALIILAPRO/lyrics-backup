		  Revelations
Don't stop keep on
Sunshine
Ecstatic
Flaco
Boogieman

Standing in the sun getting black as I want
You playing good man that ain't backing me up
Sky woke a baby ain't no jackin my hem
I got a whole lot to say so I ain't talking to them
I hear knees dropping
I turn it up louder
Black freedom black genius black power
Black ink for printing the black dollar
Until I see C-I-A
I say now what?
And cc: is central bank
Loose change body slamming big money tanks
We tell god thanks
Ya'll tellin us god don't rank that's why your breath stank
Yuck
Lay off the bacon and smokes
Quit laying off the good working folks quit the hoax
And lay off the corny color jokes
Con chilly populate the colors they won't
Ya big dope
Yuck
Keep them out your face keep em in your prayers
Either that keep em in the cross hairs
Better still keep a even dose of each cause until you get justice
You won't get peace peace peace peace peace peace
The gun shot say ba ba da day ba da da day ba da da da da da day ay!
They shout peace peace peace
They shout peace peace peace
The firefight lit ba ba da day ba da da day ba da da da da da day ay
Rumors and rumors and rumors of war can I get better now what is that for
And more
Rumors and rumors and rumors of war killers just killing now what they kill for
And more
Rumors and rumors and rumors of war can I get better now what is that for
And more
Rumors and rumors and rumors of war
Revelations
Don't stop keep on
