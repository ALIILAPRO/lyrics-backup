		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We're calling you awake 
From the sleep you've been sleeping for years
Been await for the day 
Been await like wolves in a field

And when the essence of life is coming down from above
To lay down where you lie
Time will lose its weight on you
Under dark, dark, dark
Darkening skies

We're under darkening skies
We're under darkening skies
We're under darkening skies
We're under dark.
