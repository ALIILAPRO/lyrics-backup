		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  See the nameless ones
Falling right before your eyes
Hear the screaming?
Is destiny that's calling your name

As far as you can go
As long as you stay alive
Are you strong enough?
Cause nobody else but
You for the ride

Lord, I pray for you now
Why should I be afraid to die?
Can't believe how far we have gone
Running thru the endless rain

Secrets and dreams of the past
Slipping from a heart of stone
Is this the end you predicted or just
Another twist of fate
Be with me now
Got nothing left to fear

As far as you can go
As long as you stay alive
Are you strong enough?
Cause nobody else but
You for the ride
