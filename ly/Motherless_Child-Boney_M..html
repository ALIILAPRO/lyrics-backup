		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sometimes I feel like a motherless child
Sometimes I feel like a motherless child
Sometimes I feel like a motherless child

A long way from home
A long way from my home
Believe me, believe me, believe me, believe me
Believe me, believe me, believe me, believe me
A long way from my home

Sometimes I feel like my hopes are in vain (oh yeah)
Sometimes I feel like my hopes are in vain (baby)
Sometimes I feel like my hopes are in vain

No way to get home (no no)
No way to get home
Believe me, believe me, believe me, believe me
Believe me, believe me, believe me, believe me
No way to get home

Sometimes I feel like a motherless child (yeah)
Sometimes I feel like a motherless child (won't someone help me now)
Sometimes I feel like I'm almost gone

A long way from home
A long way from my home
Believe me, believe me, believe me, believe me
Believe me, believe me, believe me, believe me
A long way from my home

Sometimes I feel like a motherless child (tell me)
Sometimes I feel like a motherless child
Sometimes I feel like a motherless child

A long way from home
A long way from my home
Believe me, believe me, believe me, believe me
Believe me, believe me, believe me, believe me
A long way from my home

Believe me, believe me, believe me, believe me
A long way from my home
Believe me, believe me, believe me, believe me
A long way from my home
