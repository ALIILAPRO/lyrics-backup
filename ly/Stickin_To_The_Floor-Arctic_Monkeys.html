		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Won't somebody let me out!
Don't wanna stick around no more
I said they're looking at ya strange
I said you're stickin' to the floor

Not one of you's got an ounce of style in ya
Said not one of you, no

Fucking hell I'll break your nose
If they keep on pushing you around
Keep on stepping on your toes
I'll pick you up when you fall down

Not one of you's got an ounce of style in ya
Said not one of you, no

Not one of you's got an ounce of style in ya
So not one of you, no
