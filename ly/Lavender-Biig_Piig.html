		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's his forte, on his knees
Call it foreplay
Don't know where I'd be without it
Call me up late, what you need? (you want it)
Bought some new lace, I'd like you to see it

I want a dark room and dim lights
I wanna feel the bass hit
Through my thighs
Baby so abrasive, it's all play
You asked me, "Who are you?"

If I wasn't so complacent, I just might
Wake up with a taste of the good time
Least that's what you might say, is that right?
Tell me then, who are you?

Call a cab, babe, follow me
Like the catch says, one more 'til you're gonna try it
Like my guy said, he ain't no cheat (you want it)
Only hearts break are the ones that speak

I want a dark room and dim lights
I wanna feel the bass hit
Through my thighs
Baby so abrasive, it's all play
You asked me, "who are you?"

If I wasn't so complacent, I just might
Wake up with a taste of the good time
Least that's what you might say, is that right?
Tell me then, who are you?
If I wasn't so complacent, I just might
Wake up with a taste of the good time
Least that's what you might say, is that right?
Tell me then, who are you?

You want it
You want it
