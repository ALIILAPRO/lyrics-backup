		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Believe it (believe it)
You feel it (feel it)
I know (I know, I know)
You really gotta

Oh (oh) baby, come with me
We've got this energy
Just give it all to me
No one else can make feel

Let go of control
Ooh, in waves of delight
Over and over again
It's time
(It, it)
(It's)
(It, it's)

Oh, baby, come with me
It's plain for all to see
The night is you and me
No one else can make me feel

Unity

You and I

Oh, baby, come with me (me, me, me, me, me)

The night is you and me

Ooh

(Ooh, uni-unity)
You and I, yeah
Unity (oh, ooh)

Over again
(Oh, oh)

Over again
(Say it over) over again
Over again

Say
You feel it?
(Feel it)
Do you feel it?
Feel it

Oh, baby, come with me
It's plain for all to see
The night is you and me
Oh, baby, come with me
