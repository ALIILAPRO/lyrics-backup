		  (Ha ha ha)

I stepped in the room and she noticed me
A-a-almost instantly and I can guarantee that she
Has heard about me through her girlfriend
Not to mention that her boyfriend hates me

It's not my fault she looked at me
It's not your fault, you can't compete
Are we through with this? 
'Cause I do insist nothing happened here this time

Guys don't like me
These guys, they don't like me
These guys don't like me
'Cause their girlfriends do
Guys don't like me
These guys, they don't like me
These guys don't like me
'Cause their girlfriends do

Do-do-do, do-do-do-do, do-do-do
Their girlfriends

Stop, let me explain the situation
Everybody hatin' for the same reason
Attempted to mingle, she said she was single
And I'm just a nice guy

It's not my fault she looked at me
It's not your fault, you can't compete
I am through with this 
But if you insist then next the next time she's mine

Guys don't like me
These guys, they don't like me
These guys don't like me
'Cause their girlfriends do
Guys don't like me
These guys, they don't like me
These guys don't like me
'Cause their girlfriends do

Do-do-do, do-do-do-do, do-do-do
Their girlfriends do
Do-do-do, do-do-do-do, do-do-do
Their girlfriends

(I stepped into the club and she fell in love, oh yeah)
(I stepped into the club and she fell in love, oh yeah)
(I stepped into the club and she fell in love, oh yeah)
I stepped into the club and she fell in love, oh yeah
I stepped into the club and she

"Boy, that's your girl?"

Guys don't like me
These guys, they don't like me
These guys don't like me
'Cause their girlfriends do
Guys don't like me
These guys, they don't like me
These guys don't like me
'Cause their girlfriends

Guys don't like me
These guys, they don't like me
These guys don't like me
'Cause their girlfriends do
Guys don't like me
These guys, they don't like me
These guys don't like me
'Cause their girlfriends do

Do-do-do, do-do-do-do, do-do-do
Their girlfriends do
Do-do-do, do-do-do-do, do-do-do
Their girlfriends do
