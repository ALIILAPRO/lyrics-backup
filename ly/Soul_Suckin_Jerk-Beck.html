		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got a job making money for the man
Throwing chicken in the bucket with the soda pop can
Puke-green uniform on my back
I had to set it on fire in a vat of chicken fat
I leaped on the counter like a bird with no hair
Running through the mini mall in my underwear
I got lost downtown, couldn't find a ride home
Sun went down, I got frozen to the bone
'Til a hooker let me share her fake fur coat
As I took a little nap, the cops picked up us both
I tried to explain, I was only trying to get warm
I knew I never ever should have burnt my uniform
He said, "Too bad, better bite the bullet hard, son"
I didn't have no teeth so I stole his gun
And I crawled out the window with my shadow on a spoon
Dancing on the roof, shootin' holes in the moon

Get busy
Get busy
You know it

I ain't gonna work for no soul sucking jerk
I'm gonna take it all back and I ain't saying jack
I ain't gonna work for no soul sucking jerk
I'm gonna take it all back and I ain't saying jack

Standing right here with a beer in my hand
And my mouth is full of sand and I don't understand
Fourteen days I been sleeping in a barn
Better get a paycheck tattooed on my arm
Whistling Dixie with the Dixie cup filled
With the barbecue sauce and the dental floss chill
Big fat fingers pointing into my face
Telling me to get busy cleaning up this place
I got bent like a wet cigarette
And she's coming after me with a butterfly net
Riding on a bloodhound ringing the bell
Black cat wrapped in a road map of hell
Pencil on my leg and I'm trying not to beg
Taking turns baking worms with the bacon and eggs
Now they got me in a birdcage flapping my jaw
Like a pretzel in the stars just waiting to fall
So give me what I got to get so I can go
'Cause I ain't washing dishes in the ditch no more

I ain't gonna work for no soul sucking jerk
I'm gonna take it all back and I ain't saying jack
I ain't gonna work for no soul sucking jerk
I'm gonna take it all back and I ain't saying jack
No, no, no, no, no

Soul sucking jerk
Soul sucking jerk
You soul sucking jerk
Soul sucking jerk
Ain't gonna work for no soul sucking jerk
I'm gonna take it all back and I ain't saying jack
No

Ain't gonna work
For no soul suckin' jerk
I ain't gonna work
For no soul suckin' jerk
I ain't gonna work
