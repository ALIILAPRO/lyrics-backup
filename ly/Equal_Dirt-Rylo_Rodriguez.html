		  (Stephan Spazzin)

Whole month straight, I was gettin' high, you had left me at my lowest
I wasn't ready for no kid then, happy that you got abortion
You doin' makeup on the same ho I was sneakin' on you with
I'm dappin' up the same nigga you was creepin' on me with
And we thought we got past that
You told me that was our last time
I thought you got past that, your actions givin' Matt Ryan
I seen you got a new man and a lil' one on the way too
I remember not havin' no car, but for you, I'm on the way through
Hate that happened to you
I shed a tear when they said your nigga killed you, so many memories
I go to our Facebook just to look at our old messages
I was out in Houston, I went to readin' our old texts
I'm not bein' insecure, I just know that wasn't your brother
You the first lady I ever took serious and I'm far from bein' a buster
I'm not a fool, go tie your shoes, we not a couple
Goin' in your purse, you fucked around and dropped a rubber
"Who this for?" 'Cause you my bitch and we be fuckin' raw, every time
"Bitch, who this for?"
Like, bitch, stop playin' before I, never mind

If lovin' you is wrong, I don't wanna be right
If bein' right means bein' without you, I'd rather live a wrong doin' life
Rylo, she gon' leave you if you go back broke today
Rylo, she gon' leave you if you go back broke today
Long as I got you by my side, then they can talk 'bout what they wanna
Then I don't even care what them other people say

I remember them and now I'm solo, hit his ho, now they ain't friends
And Lil Kev' been gone for so long, he went to trial, but they ain't win
She gotta pull up on me, long live Trouble, I ain't stayin' nowhere
I don't give a fuck where we at, Ben Simmons, I ain't playin' nowhere
Can't believe you told, yeah, my dog said he can
Even though we stand-up niggas, that don't mean go take the stand
New two-door coupe, sledgehammer, crushed diamonds
Got the driver waitin' for ya at baggage claim when you fly in
I'm doin' this rap shit here for us, for all us
You a reflection of me, so whatever you do, they gon' blame me for it
You ain't dirty, fake piss under your nuts when you report
Fully auto, he died in a shootout even though he started it
"Rylo ain't go no motion, he flexin' Baby money like P artist"
Why the fuck you try to play me like a decoy?
Why the fuck you ain't tell me what time your plane was finna depart?
Nah, for real, you need to stop it, yeah, I'on't like bein' toxic

If lovin' you is wrong, I don't wanna be right
If bein' right means bein' without you, I'd rather live a wrong doin' life
Rylo, she gon' leave you if you go back broke today
Rylo, she gon' leave you if you go back broke today
Long as I got you by my side, then they can talk 'bout what they wanna
Then I don't even care what them other people say

I don't wanna be right
If bein' right means bein' without you
I'd rather live a wrong doin' life
Your mama and daddy say it's a shame
It's a downright disgrace
But long as I got you by my side
I don't care what your people say
