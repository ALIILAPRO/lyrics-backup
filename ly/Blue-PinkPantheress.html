		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I waste my life (my life)
On looks that I saw you give (on looks that I saw you give)
Now, if you change your mind (your mind)
I'll buy the same everything (I'll buy the same everything)

And it aches and it pains, how I fear of missin' out
I belong in your company, why'd you have those doubts? No
How many times (how many times) do I dream of reachin' out?

I guess you'll never know, I'm not hangin' with ya
I'm not hangin' with ya, I'm not hangin' with ya, ah
I guess you'll never know why, I'm not hangin' with ya
I'm not hangin' with ya, I'm not hangin' with ya, ah

It's the same old you, the same old me
Except you're everythin' I can't be
Except I get wonderin' eyes
It looks much better on the side of your street
I'll always change because you want me to
It's the same old you, and the same old me (ha)
Except you're everythin' I can't be

Your mind, ah (hangin' with ya)
(Hangin' with ya) where you've been tonight? (Hangin' with ya)
I'm out of my mind, ah (hangin' with ya)
(Hangin' with ya) where you've been tonight? (Hangin' with ya)
Love you with all I've got

I based my life on your face, your everythin' (your everythin')
No, oh, I realized
I can't copy you anymore (can't copy you anymore)
Think of you anymore (think of you anymore)
Hang with you anymore (hang with you anymore)

I guess you'll never know, I'm not hangin' with ya
I'm not hangin' with ya, I'm not hangin' with ya, ah
I guess you'll never know why, I'm not hangin' with ya
I'm not hangin' with ya, I'm not hangin' with you, ah

Your mind, ah
Where you've been tonight?
My mind, ah
Where you've been tonight?
Love you with all I've got

I can't talk to you anymore (can't talk to you anymore)
Speak to you anymore (speak to you anymore)
Hang with you anymore (hang with you anymore)
(I guess you'll never know)
I can't talk to you anymore (can't talk to you anymore)
Speak to you anymore (speak to you anymore)
Hang with you anymore (hang with you anymore)
