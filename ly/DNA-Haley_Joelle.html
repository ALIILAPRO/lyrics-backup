		  My voice got quiet[00:03.55]My smile got small[00:07.03]Been drinking more than I ever have[00:09.52]And I don't stand as tall[00:13.26]Catch myself lying[00:16.52]When my mom calls[00:19.94]I find myself saying I'm fine[00:22.27]When I'm not doing good at all[00:26.63]I don't recognize me now[00:29.93]I want myself back[00:31.57]Gimme myself back[00:35.63]What was it about you[00:38.60]That changed everything 'bout me?[00:41.93]Don't laugh the way I used to[00:45.22]I'm saying things I don't mean[00:49.00]Nothing's ever gonna be the same[00:54.53]You didn't just break my heart[00:56.73]You changed my DNA[01:04.36]I don't get dressed now[01:07.50]I ignore my friends[01:12.00]And it's not my thing spending 24 hours in bed[01:17.27]I got empty pictures[01:20.65]On all the walls[01:24.01]Been sleeping with lights on[01:25.78]It's too hard to get up and turn them off[01:30.77]I don't recognize me now[01:33.97]I want myself back[01:35.75]Gimme myself back[01:39.77]What was it about you[01:42.69]That changed everything 'bout me?[01:46.06]Don't laugh the way I used to[01:49.36]I'm saying things I don't mean[01:53.11]Nothing's ever gonna be the same[01:58.69]You didn't just break my heart[02:00.84]You changed my DNA[02:05.41]Can everyone tell[02:08.67]I'm somebody else?[02:12.00]Oh look at me now[02:16.36]Nothing's ever gonna be the same[02:22.56]Cuz there's all these parts of me you took away[02:28.63]You didn't just break my heart[02:30.91]You changed my DNA
