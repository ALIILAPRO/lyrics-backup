		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We all will go and stay sometime
Soon to be victim of a crime
Loose of blood and death is near
Take a number, can you wait right here

Check in - to the place
Reduce your life into disgrace
Isn't there some kind
Of better way

When it's time to operate
Fatalistic figures hold your fate
Just relax you'll feel no pain
Hope they put you in the right domain

Patient helpless to defy
Negligence is why

Check in - to the place
Reduce your life into disgrace
Isn't there some kind
Of better way

Within the laws
They'll rip you off
They wait you off
Malpractice!
And in the end
They'll let you in
Please come again
Malpractice!

Suffer until you get well
Bleak existence like a prison cell
If you find your life is lost
Dedicate the world to pay the cost

Patients helpless to defy
Negligence is why

Check in - to the place
Reduce your life into disgrace
Isn't there some kind
Of better way

Within the laws
They'll rip you off
They wait you off
Malpractice!
And in the end
They'll let you in
Please come again
Malpractice!
