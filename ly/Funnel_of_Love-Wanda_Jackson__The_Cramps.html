		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here I go,
Falling down, down, down, 
My mind is a blank,
My head is spinning around and around,
As I go deep into the funnel of love.

It's such a crazy, crazy feeling,
I get weak in the knees,
My poor old head is a reelin',
As I go deep into the funnel of love.

I tried and I tried, to run and hide,
I even tried to run away,
You just can't run from the funnel of love, 
It's gonna get you someday.

It's such a crazy, crazy feeling,
I get weak in the knees,
My poor old head is a reelin',
As I go deep into the funnel of love.

I tried and I tried, to run and hide,
I even tried to run away,
You just can't run from the funnel of love, 
It's gonna get you someday.

Here I go, falling down, down, down,
My mind is a blank, 
My head is spinning around and around,
As I go deep into the funnel of love,
Deep into the funnel of love,
Deep into the funnel of love.
