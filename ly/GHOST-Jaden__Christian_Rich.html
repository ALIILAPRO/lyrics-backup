		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I just ran hunnid yard dash
You spent too much cash
Screw your Goyard bags
I knew that you wouldn't last (no way)
I'm in physics class
I knew that you wouldn't ask
She got too much (shh, what?)
Wonder finna do with all that
Talked to Elon last week, told him my whip too fast
Hunnid 20 on the dash (shit)
I hope that I never crash (no)
MSFTS on the map (yup)
Drop hits that's that (hits)
¿Teo? hit me with the pass, swish
Niggas wish I never rapped (never)

Play this shit in the club for me, for me, for me (for me)
'Cause if you in there, then I'll be the one you never see
Like jeez

Let me go put on my cleats
The way that I get up and run through the streets (streets!)
Paris like bon appetit
They saw us and went to go call the police, yeah, damn
Just put a hydrogen whip on a lease, yeah
Tryna make sure that I leave a good world for my niece
Hey that's just me (that's just me!)
We don't need you on the team, we pay too many fees
They told me travel light, we ain't going overseas (whoo, whoo)
It's just one night I'ma bring the whole fleet with me

Play this shit in the club for me, for me, for me (for me)
If you in there, I'll be the one you never see
I'm ghost

Illin' the most (illin' the most)
I've been behind the scenes, I've been watching the ropes
(I'm on the ropes)
She put her hand on my neck, she on the slopes, ice (ice)
Why you put so much space in the flow?
(Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go)
When I wanna grow I listen to Hov, take notes
Look at the case, close it
Open the doors, look at my neck, look at my wrist frozen
Look at my pants dripping swag, know that you stole it

Play this shit in the club for me—eh
If you in there—uh
Nigga, I'm ghost
