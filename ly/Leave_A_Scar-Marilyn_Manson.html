		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Its not like I made myself a list of new and different ways,
To murder your heart.
I'm just a painting that's still wet.
If you touch me Ill be smeared, you'll be stained,
Stained for the rest of your life.

So turn around and walk away
Before we confuse the way, we abuse each other.
If your not afraid of getting hurt
Then I am not afraid of how much I hurt you
I'm well aware I'm a danger to myself.

Are you aware I'm a danger to others?
There's a crack in my soul, you thought was a smile.
What ever doesn't kill you,
Is gonna leave a scar
What ever doesn't kill you,
Is gonna leave a scar
I'm more like a silver bullet
Than I'm like a gun,
I'm not easy to hold.

I'm moving fast and if I stay in your heart,
I'm certain that this will be the end of your life
So turn around walk away
Before we confuse the way we abuse each other
If your not afraid of getting hurt then I am not afraid

How much I hurt you
I'm well aware I'm a danger to myself
Are you aware I'm a danger to others?
