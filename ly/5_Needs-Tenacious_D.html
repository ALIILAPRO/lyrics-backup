		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This one goes to all the disciples out there
On the journey that we call life
You know, there's only 5 needs
And Kyle and I have compiled 'em
And have woven into song
A song we like to call The 5 needs

First you need the planet
Earth beneath your feet
You couldn't live an instant without that
Then you need the air
Oxygen to breathe
You couldn't live five minutes without that
Then you need the water
The icy cold waters
Now, you need some love (love)
You need some love (love)

We only wanted to rock your world
We hoped that we rocked your world
The fifth need is to rock your world
We really wanna rock your world
It comes before food
Oh
Di-ga-dwang
