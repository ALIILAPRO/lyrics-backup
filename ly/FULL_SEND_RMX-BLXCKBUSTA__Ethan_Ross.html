		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah,
Stuck inside my head I'm having visions
Fuck them all and they opinions
Yeah I got some time today
but I'm still careful how I spend it
She like, boy you know you dripping
Look, her neck right where I bit it
My teeth shining when I'm grinning
I'm still happy when I'm sinning
They be hating on me but they washed-up, yeah
I can't blame them, why they lame
And wanna watch us, yeah
I could paint a pretty picture when he mopped-up
LMFAO let these shots, shots, shots bust, yeah

I got guts, if I ain't rich then I'm on the cusp yeah aye
God I trust, kill these demons spill they blood yeah aye
Lacking what? Last I checked I be taking all dub's yeah bitch
I got a rush, I destroy everything I touch
What I'm envisioning, no division we splitting the dividends
With my brothers and we was all living in
The conditions that really conditioned us
You don't see me around no one basic
Cut them off, there were hearts that were breaking
19 I was working the late shift
Now it's time I collect all the payments
Been a long road down 280
Almost lost my motherfucking life
Yeah, almost disappeared once
I remember that cold December night
Now I'm here and I'm back with a purpose
I be on this path, that's for certain
I be putting my peoples on for sure,
Shit really got real but we working
That's a fact
Yeah,
Stuck inside my head I'm having visions
Fuck them all and they opinions
Yeah I got some time today
But I'm still careful how I spend it
She like, boy you know you dripping
Look, her neck right where I bit it
My teeth shining when I'm grinning
I'm still happy when I'm sinning
They be hating on me but they washed-up, yeah
I can't blame them, why they lame
And wanna watch us, yeah
I could paint a pretty picture when he mopped-up
LMFAO let these shots, shots, shots bust, yeah
