		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Jacky, she's a fake whore

She'll obstruct you on your way

And she'll hit you and she'll beat you every day

And, Jacky, she's a fake whore

And she's seen better days

She will kick you down the stairway every day

And, Jacky, she's a fake whore

And it's her fifth fix today

All the men who have abused her

Well, she spits on them today

And, Jacky, she's a fake whore

And she has gone away

Someone knifed her in the ally, yesterday

Yesterday, yesterday, yesterday, yesterday
