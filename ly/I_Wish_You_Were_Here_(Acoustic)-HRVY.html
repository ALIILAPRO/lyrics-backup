		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wish you were here
Every time you disappear
I'm missing you but Then let me make it clear
Every time you disappear
I, I want you near

I, I tried to stay cool about
'Cause you always seem cool without it
Why do I try?
I, I guess I want you, you don't want me
But I'm saying that I'm cool about it
And I'm really not cool about it
Why don't you come on back inside?
I really want you, you don't want me

You know you're all I think about
Don't let me say it out loud
Guess all I think about is you

I wish you were here
(Oh, I wish you were here)
Every time you disappear
(Every time you disappear)
I'm missing you but Then let me make it clear
(Oh Let me make it clear)
Every time you disappear
I, I want you near
I wish you were here
(Oh I wish you were here)

Taking my T-shirt off
Making this whole world stop
Up on my table top
Making this kitchen rock
I tried to stay cool about
'Cause you always seem cool without it
Why do I try?
I I guess I want you, you don't want me

You know you're all I think about
Don't let me say it out loud
Guess all I think about is you

I wish you were here
(Oh, I wish you were here)
Every time you disappear
(Every time you disappear)
I'm missing you but Then let me make it clear
(Oh Let me make it clear)
Every time you disappear
I, I want you near
I wish you were here
(Oh I wish you were here)

Every time you disappear (Every time you disappear)
I'm looking about you, let me make it clear
(Oh let me make it clear)
Every time you disappear
I, I want you near, I
