		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Beezo need cash only, you dig?
(That boy Cassius)

I just been ballin' out every season
Know it's some niggas I left in the bleachers
I just been married to double cup
I got to pour me a four inside another liter
Tie up the bands and then run it up
I got to put the new bales inside of the freezer
Back at the trap I was duckin' them people
Duckin' the birds, sendin' out them eagles
All of my diamonds gone buss out the meter
I'm drippin' water, nigga, Aquafina
Damn, that bitch cappin' if she think I need her
Hit it one time and then I gotta leave her
I'm a real street nigga
Gotta keep it a rack with my people
Turn the whole squad to bosses
I can't be kickin' shit like I'm Adidas

Young nigga pullin' up inside the Bentley truck
I just be poppin' shit like hot grease
I 'member days sittin' at the trap
'Bout to call the plug, gotta cop three
Looked up to Pablo Escobar, Money Meech, and Chapo
That's my top three
Bitch, I was servin' the sidewalk
Then I copped the drop hopped in the streets
You can't name a young nigga that's hot as me
All my niggas do murders and robberies
Got about twenty racks in the Robin Jeans
Nigga's thinkin' I won off the lottery
When I hop in the push start with the pounds
Niggas know that it ain't no stoppin' me
Outta town champ like Mayweather
Got a new crib off the boxin' ring
Put the new Forgiatos on the Jeep
Run up thirty in a week
I just fuck her, I don't keep
.45 under the pillow
Forty-five thousand in the sheets
I want the bag, nigga
I can't trust no ho if I know she ain't married to me
Bitch, I done got this shit up out the streets
Red gut period blood on my seats

I just been ballin' out every season
Know it's some niggas I left in the bleachers
I just been married to double cup
I got to pour me a four inside another liter
Tie up the bands and then run it up
I got to put the new bales inside of the freezer
Back at the trap I was duckin' them people
Duckin' the birds, sendin' out them eagles
All of my diamonds gone buss out the meter
I'm drippin' water, nigga, Aquafina
Damn, that bitch cappin' if she think I need her
Hit it one time and then I gotta leave her
I'm a real street nigga
Gotta keep it a rack with my people
Turn the whole squad to bosses
I can't be kickin' shit like I'm Adidas

Rap shit, I ain't gotta cap shit
I've been gettin' cheese like I'm Velveeta
I'm in a two-seater with two bad bitches
Black and White I'm finna have a zebra
She wanna ride in the back
'Cause I've been havin' them racks
I ain't showin'
She say I ain't got them racks
Thought you knew me better than that
But they ain't knowin'
She say my VVS's so annoyin'
I bought a coupe to spoil her
She want to look out the roof in the mornin'
YSL got her a new persona
I want to ball like a triple-double, nigga
Larry Bird with the racks
Livin' my best life, shorty
You can't never get attached
Went to the plug got a couple P's
Then I Randolph, like Zach, ayy
We been sellin' in the projects
Like it's the New Jack City
All my bitches got ass and titties
Got to hop on top the bag and get it
She call me 'cause her main nigga don't beat it up
He somethin' like a pacifist
All a nigga do is sniff her the check
Open her mouth put the dick in her neck
Blue rags, bitches Crippin' the set
I've been trappin' got to get a Patek
Bitch, I'm rich I can't be livin' in debt
She won't be my bitch, I can't fuck with the pets
Her best friend end up givin' me sex
In the Tahoe when I jumped out the jet
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I just been ballin' out every season
Know it's some niggas I left in the bleachers
I just been married to double cup
I got to pour me a four inside another liter
Tie up the bands and then run it up
I got to put the new bales inside of the freezer
Back at the trap I was duckin' them people
Duckin' the birds, sendin' out them eagles
All of my diamonds gone buss out the meter
I'm drippin' water, nigga, Aquafina
Damn, that bitch cappin' if she think I need her
Hit it one time and then I gotta leave her
I'm a real street nigga
Gotta keep it a rack with my people
Turn the whole squad to bosses
I can't be kickin' shit like I'm Adidas
