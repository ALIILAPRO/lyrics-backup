		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I saw you on a Sunday in a caf√©
And all you did was look my way
And my heart started to race
And my hands started to shake, yeah
I heard you asked about me through a friend
My adrenaline kicked in
'Cause I've been askin' 'bout you too
And now we're out here in this room

I get a little bit nervous around you
Get a little bit stressed out when I think about you
Get a little excited
Baby, when I think about you, yeah
Talk a little too much around you (I talk a little too much, yeah)
Get a little self-conscious (I get a little self-conscious)
When I think about you
Get a little excited (I get a little excited)
Baby, when I think about you
Yeah, when I think about you, babe

We walked in the rain
A couple blocks to your apartment
You told me to come inside
Caught me staring in your eyes
And I'm not usually like this
But I like what you're doing to me
Ah, what you're doing to me

I get a little bit nervous (I get a little bit nervous)
Around you
Get a little bit stressed out (I get a little bit stressed out)
When I think about you
Get a little excited (I get a little excited)
Baby, when I think about you
Yeah, when I think about you, babe (oh yeah)

Talk a little too much (I talk a little too much, yeah)
Around you
Get a little self-conscious (I get a little self-conscious)
When I think about you
Get a little excited (I get a little excited)
Baby, when I think about you
Yeah, when I think about you, babe

You got me acting like I've never done this before
I promise I'll be ready when I walk through the door
And I don't know why
No, I don't know why
Yeah yeah

I get a little bit nervous (I get a little bit nervous)
Around you
Get a little bit stressed out (I get a little bit stressed out)
When I think about you
Get a little excited (I get a little excited)
Baby, when I think about you
Yeah, when I think about you, babe (oh yeah)

Talk a little too much (I talk a little too much, yeah)
Around you
Get a little self-conscious (I get a little self-conscious)
When I think about you (I get a little self-conscious)
Get a little excited (I get a little excited)
Baby, when I think about you
Yeah, when I think about you, babe
