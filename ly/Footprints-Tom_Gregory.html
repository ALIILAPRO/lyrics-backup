		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can't seem to let go of all that's behind me
You're like an old ghost that just won't let go of me
You're in my blood, in my heart you stay

Sometimes I forget what you did to me
How can someone be my poison and my remedy?
You're in my blood, in my heart you stay

I know I'll never find a way
No, no matter what I say
No matter what I do
It's only you I can't escape now

You got your footprints on me
From my head to my toes
All your marks on my chest
Leave a glimmer of hope
No, I don't know, yeah
I feel it in my head and my

Footprints on me
From my head to my toes
All your marks on my chest
Leave a glimmer of hope
No, I
You leave your footprints on me
Until my blood runs cold

Can't seem to let go of everything you do to me
Even though it hurts, it still feels so new to me
In my blood, in my heart you stay

I know I'll never find a way
No, no matter what I say
No matter what I do
It's only you I can't escape now

You got your footprints on me
From my head to my toes
All your marks on my chest
Leave a glimmer of hope
No, I don't know, yeah
I feel it in my head and my

Footprints on me
From my head to my toes
All your marks on my chest
Leave a glimmer of hope
No, I
You leave your footprints on me
Until my blood runs cold

You know I'll never find a way
Oh, no matter what I say now
No matter what I do
It's only you I can't escape now

You got your footprints on me
From my head to my toes
All your marks on my chest
Leave a glimmer of hope
No, I don't know
I feel it in my head and my

Footprints on me
From my head to my toes
All your marks on my chest
Leave a glimmer of hope
No, I
You leave your footprints on me
Until my blood runs cold
