		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Only so much I can take
My love, I've grown so afraid
I think I forgot your face
Hurry and answer me 
I know that it's far too late
To make up for my mistakes
There's no one that I hate
More than myself
For letting you walk out
For thinking I was better off without you
Without you 

Ever since you left me 
Al Waja (the pain) 
Fi Albi (is in my heart)
I can't take it, take me back
I can't take it, take me back
Khaleeni Ashoofik (let me see you)
I've been dumb, I've been foolish 
Had I known that you would leave
I'd do things differently 
Msh Adr (I can't)
At-Hamal Al Alem, Alem (take the pain)
Jawabeeni (answer me) 
Ya Habibti (oh my love)
Answer me
Answer me
Msh Adr (I can't)
At-Hamal Al Alem, Alem (take the pain)
Jawabeeni (answer me) 
Ya habibti (oh my love)
Answer me
Answer me

My dear, it's been a few months 
My tears, they've fallen enough
I think about the things that we did 
Khaleeni Ashoofik Wa Bas (let me just see you)
Can't stand all the pain in my chest 
I did things that I regret 
But I just need to see you once
So answer my call 
I don't know why we fight, not at all
I hope you know

Ya roohi (oh my soul)
I just need to see you once, oh
Ya noori (oh my light)
I just need to find my way back to you
Samaheeni (forgive me)
Oh I beg of you, oh I
Know you see me from your window screaming!

Ever since you left me 
Al Waja (the pain) 
Fi Albi (in my heart)
I can't take it, take me back
I can't take it, take me back
Khaleeni Ashoofik (let me see you)
I've been dumb, I've been foolish 
Had I known that you would leave
I'd do things differently 
Msh Adr (I can't)
At-Hamal Al Alem, Alem (take the pain)
Jawabeeni (answer me) 
Ya Habibti (oh my love)
