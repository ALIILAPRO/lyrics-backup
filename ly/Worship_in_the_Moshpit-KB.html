Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh
Okay woah, woah, just singin' my song, yeah
(Hol' up Wop, you made this?)
'Kay, 'kay, I sing it loud, uh, yeah (Good)

Feel me? Uh, worship in a moshpit (Ayy)
If they want a star, I am not it, yeah, yeah
KB for the glory, not the optics
And once we get it started
It's goin' down regardless (Woah)

HGA is simple, bruh
Worship in my headspace, god is in my temple

Mice turn to men when they

All my dogs, they wanna kennel us (Ah)
Tryna save a generation, no Kylie, Kendall
Bruh
Told us "Shut up, dribble" but we authors
You can't Kendall us
Life behind these bars
I'll take you like the prison bus
Okay, let's go now, ooh, ooh
Saints in the club now nobody got sauce
But we still shut the club down
Ain't no diamonds, it's a tour
(It's a tour) 
I just brought the bus down (Yeah)
It's "Knuck if You Buck" meets the gospel
What's up now? (Oh, oh, oh, boy)

Uh, worship in a moshpit
(Woah, woah, woah, woah)
If they want a star, I am not it, yeah, yeah
(Woah, woah, woah, woah)
KB for the glory, not the optics
(Woah, woah, woah, woah)
And once we get it started
It's goin' down regardless
(Woah, woah, woah, woah)
