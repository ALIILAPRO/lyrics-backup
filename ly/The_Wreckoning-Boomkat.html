		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I came I saw I kicked some ass 
The pain I caused it makes me laugh 
'Cause the way I do my thing is strange 
I just inject myself into your veins
Can't run, can't hide, there's no way out
The sun will rise and its about 
Time for the wreckoning 
Time time for this girl to sing

Damn if I thought that you would change 
And my life would stay the same 
I went you don't even care about me enough
You don't give a damn 
Things will come and things will go 
But there's one thing that I know for sure
Is that you don't give a damn about me 
And so I'm walking out the door

Oh yeah hmm.. 
 
Can't move can't breathe it's getting dark 
The beast has come to steal your heart 
So you better practice your scream 
Because you may not like your dream 

Things will will come and things will go 
But there's one thing I know for sure
Is that you don't give a damn about me 
And so I'm walking out the door

The wreckoning, the wreckoning, the wreckoning 
The wreckoning, the wreckoning, the wreckoning

Damn if I thought that you would change and my life would stay the same 
I went You don't even care about me you know you don't give a damn 
Things will come and things will go 
But there's one thing that I know for show
Is that you don't give a damn about me
So tough I'm walking out the door

Damn if I thought you would change and my life would stay the same 
I went You don't even care about me you know you don't give a damn 

And I'm running from my problems I got my phony face painted on
And then I think of what you said to me 
And then I think of what you did to me
I think of you and probably laugh 
And then I think of you and probably laugh 
And Then I think of you and problably laugh 

You're the one I'm running from (chorus)
