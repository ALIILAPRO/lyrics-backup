		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I woke up this morning with a buzz rollin' 'round in my brain
I haven't been drinkin' but it feels pretty good just the same
It must be contagious, looks like it's goin' around
It's cool once you catch it, you can't keep your feet on the ground

C'mon, c'mon, let's get something started
C'mon, c'mon, let's start something now

We're gonna rock this country
We're gonna rock this country
Every brown eyed boy every blue eyed girl
Gotta really go psycho give it a whirl
We're gonna rock this country
Right out of this world
Ah, ooh, na, na, na

From Utah to Texas, Minnesota, Mississippi too
Or Nevada, no matter where you live-this buzz is for you

C'mon, c'mon, let's get something started
C'mon, c'mon, let's start something now

We're gonna rock this country
We're gonna rock this country
Every brown eyed boy every blue eyed girl
Gotta really go psycho, give it a whirl
We're gonna rock this country
Right out of this world
Ah, ooh, na, na, na
Ah, ooh, na, na, na

We're pluggin' in the power
Crankin' up the sound
It's comin' your direction
It's headin' to your town
We're kickin' up dust
Blowin' off steam
Let's get nuts now
Everybody scream

We're gonna rock this country
We're gonna rock this country
Every brown eyed boy every blue eyed girl
Gotta really go psycho, give it a whirl
We're gonna rock this country
Right out of this world
Ah, ooh, na, na, na, ah, ooh, na, na, na, ah, ooh, na, na, na
