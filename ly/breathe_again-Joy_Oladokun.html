		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The Devils in the basement in my home
A flight of stairs is way too close
He comes for me when I'm alone
Collecting debts that I don't owe 

Follow me down where the waters run deep
I'll let you drown in the worst of me
If my intentions are good why can't I come clean
If heavens above where does that leave me?

Am I looking for revival?
Am I dressed in other's sin?
Hold my breath until I'm honest
Will I ever breathe again?

When the worlds so heavy I can't stand
I close my eyes and start again
Though my heart is in my hands
I won't break give me faith to bend

Am I looking for revival?
Am I dressed in other's sin?
Hold my breath until I'm honest
Will I ever breathe again?

Again
Again
Again

Am I looking for revival?
Am I dressed in other's sin?
Hold my breath until I'm honest
Will I ever breathe again?

Am I looking for revival?
Am I dressed in other's sin?
Hold my breath until I'm honest
Will I ever breathe again?
Will I ever breathe again?
Will I ever breathe again?
