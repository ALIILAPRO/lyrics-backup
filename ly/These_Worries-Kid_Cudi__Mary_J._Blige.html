		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah the crazy the wizard
So much whiskey all in my liver
I really like the punch it delivers
Makes me warm while I high five sinners
All alone trying to hide from the shadows
Ain't no use, it seems everywhere they follow
They know where I be at, in my mind tryna get me

These worries are heavy,
They rest on my shoulders
My body won't let me fall victim no more
These worries are heavy,
They rest on my shoulders
My body won't let me fall victim no more

Life is like that,
Beat me up and I'll fight right back
Poof poof be gone,
I see the devil linger on,
Yeah stuck in my hell,
Writing my mom and I ain't doing so well,
Lord let me in, I feel like he's my only friend

Yeah, the rage of the menace
Hate me now then hate me when I'm winning
Work so hard to not go insane,
It's a full time job to not lose my faith
Okay I've been here before,
Alone for the upteenth time or more
I'm tired of mu'fuckas sayin' that they worry about me
When in fact they probably never gave fuck about me

These worries are heavy, they rest on my shoulders
My body won't let me fall victim no more
These worries are heavy, they rest on my shoulders
My body won't let me fall victim no more

Yeah life is like that, beat me up
And I'm fighting right back
Poof poof be gone, I see the devil linger on,
Yeah I wanna win,
As long as I can do the work within,
Lord let me in,
I feel like you're my only friend.

These worries are heavy, they rest on my shoulders
My body won't let me fall victim no more
These worries are heavy, they rest on my shoulders
My body won't let me fall victim no more

Yeah, the rage of the menace
