		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  had me hypnotized when I was your man
And then I realized you had other plans
You had me hypnotized when I was your man
And then I realized you had other plans

I mean that, baby, you my heroine (yeah)
Fuck me in the Benz (skrrt)
Fuck me with your friends (yeah)
You could be my friend (yeah)
We could be the end to the whole book (to the whole book)
I be looking forward, she be looking for my love (what?)
I just sold a hook, I'll spend a check on you (damn)
No matter what it took, I took my time to check on you (I'm nice)
Baby, you the truth, I can see you in the booth

Had me hypnotized when I was your man (I was your man)
And then I realized (then I realized)
You had other plans (you had other plans)
But you had me hypnotized (had me hypnotized, yeah)
When I was your man (when I was your man)
And then I realized (then I realized)
You had other plans (you had other plans)

All alone, here I am now, walking by myself
Singing to these birds that pass me by myself
I don't seem to even cry now, looking at the sky now
Tell me why'd you have to leave?
Could it be so bad that I really did you wrong
Now I try to explain it all in every song
Hoping that you come home and forgive me
So we could be how we used to be

Hypnotized when I was your man (I was your man)
And then I realized (then I realized)
You had other plans (you had other plans)
But you had me hypnotized (yeah)
When I was your man (I was your man)
And then I realized that (then I realized)
You had other plans (you had other plans)

Me and you, where'd we go wrong? I can't even call it
Uh, now I'm always numb
Me and you where'd we go wrong? I can't even call it

You had me hypnotized when I was your man (I was your man)
And then I realized (then I realized)
You had other plans (you had other plans)
But you had me hypnotized (yeah)
When I was your man (when I was your man)
And then I realized (then I realized)
You had other plans (you had other plans)
But you had me hypnotized
