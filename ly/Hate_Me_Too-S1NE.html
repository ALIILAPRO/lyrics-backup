		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby the bottles pouring
left your man at home, your phone on silent, wanna get more in
You singing out like Lalala
Drowning out all the noise
baby I'm lovin your poise
Toxic girl you're poison
Uh, Yeah
Barely even know me for one day
You don't know even know my name
With me you'll never be the same
I want, I need, to feel you close
Lights shinin, sweat drippin,
and you leave it all on the floor
With your body way you movin
I know you want more
All your friends say they hate me
If that were me I'd hate me too
But trust in me baby
Nobody knows you like I do
All your friends say they hate me
If that were me I'd hate me too
But trust in me baby
Nobody knows you like I do
Ain't no love between us but we talkin on and on
Tell you girl I'm different but you know just what I'm on
I can't have you thinking that I'll ever fall in love
Pillow talkin late night thought and all that is enough
Livin the fast life
Baby girl that's light
Another one on my tab
Sippin on bottles
Fuck it full throttle
Sirens on my ass
When you want more, baby I'll give it to ya
Body galore, you know I can't ignore
Lights shinin, sweat drippin, and you leave it all on the floor
With your body way you movin I know you want more
All your friends say they hate me
If that were me I'd hate me too
But trust in me baby
Nobody knows you like I do
All your friends say they hate me
If that were me I'd hate me too
But trust in me baby
Nobody knows you like I do
No more, no more
Like I do
No more, no more
Like I do
