		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Closet full of secrets and skeletons awakes but nothing's true
I used to own a castle now it's boxes that I have to move 
Right here in the darkness there's nothing left for me to do
It's easier to run away but today
Today we got to

Cast the shadows out from sight
A final stand a shouting cry
All the wrongs now turned to right
So fight the past 
Take back the night

And call upon the torch tonight
To bring out all the ghosts to light 
Because at last we have to go it's time
To take back the night

To take back the night

Bridges burned and broken on different sides we start anew
Being chased by monsters to face head on or be consumed
Reaching out for something grasping on to nothing to lose
Paybacks left too long unpaid but today
Today we got to

Cast the shadows out from sight
A final stand a shouting cry
All the wrongs now turned to right
So fight the past 
Take back the night

And call upon the torch tonight
To bring out all the ghosts to light 
Because at last we have to go it's time
To take back the night

To take back the night
Whoa oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh
To take back the night
Whoa oh oh oh
Whoa whoa whoa whoa (To take back the night)

So fight the past, take back the night

Take back the night

Whoa oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh
To take back the night
Whoa oh oh oh
Whoa whoa whoa whoa

And call upon the torch tonight
To bring out all the ghosts to light 
Because at last we have to go it's time
To take back the night (whoa oh oh oh)
