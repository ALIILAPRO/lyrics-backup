		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby, I keep it way too raw
Done seen to many things, that's why I'm way too hard
I know too many ways that I could break your heart
So we're safe apart
It's something about
Baby, I keep it way too real
And it drives you insane that I can't change how I feel
But you still on my brain
And I'm still right here
Still right here

(I belong to, I belong)
You (I give all my love to you)
Give you all my love
(Every time I see your face, it makes me wanna sing
And every time I think about your love it drives me crazy)
Crazy, crazy (crazy)
(I belong to, I belong
I give all my love to you
Every time I see your face, it makes me wanna sing
And every time I think about your love it drives me crazy)

You say we done, we be fuckin' again I think maybe I keep it too real
I'm with her but got you in my head
I got visions, you grippin' the bed
So your friends keep callin' you crazy
But it's fuck 'em, you answer the first ring
She just sent me a text, "You belong to me"
We need one-on-one time in Palm Springs
Hate the fact you be actin' just like me
Thorugh the back, they ain't checkin' for ID
Courtside seats, better than Spike Lee
Every time I see your face, make me wanna blow a bag
Ain't no simp, baby, bounce if you wanna leave

(I belong to, I belong)
You (I give all my love to you)
Give you all my love
(Every time I see your face, it makes me wanna sing
And every time I think about your love it drives me crazy)
Crazy, crazy (crazy)
(I belong to, I belong
I give all my love to you
Every time I see your face, it makes me wanna sing
And every time I think about your love it drives me crazy)
