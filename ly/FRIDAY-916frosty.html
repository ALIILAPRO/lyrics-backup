		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is not a dream
What's happening to this place?
(Taylor 'bout to fucking flex)

Cross on neck for the ones I hate (Cross)
Friday's here, got the drugs in my veins
(yeah) pop two Xans, now she wanna give face
I got bands that I wanna go waste (Skrrt)
Friday's here, so don't be shy
Take me higher than the sky
Friday's here, so let's be friends
Pop that seal, the night won't end

Look into her eyes and you turn to stone
She don't leave the club 'cause
She got no home
Bunch of random numbers always on her phone
I wonder what she's like
When she's all alone
Black dress with the heels, and the makeup on
(Alright) got the world in her hand
She can do no wrong (yeah, yeah)
Had to get another bottle just to get along
Got her singing every word when
I play my song
Don't like her when she do coke
She just came for a drink and smoke
Don't like her, I like her throat
Don't like her, don't want no more
Destined for disaster
There's no happy ever after
Through the jokes and all the laughter
Stab my back and turn the dagger
I got too much shit in my head
Don't know where it went wrong
When the night's about to end
She went and threw up in my lawn
She said she don't wanna be here
I told her to stay strong
I can't find the words to say it
So I put it in a song
Small-town kid, but a Hollywood boy
Tryna find himself, tryna find his voice
Never 'til now did he know where to go
Never 'til now did he wanna be alone

Rest in peace to my main boy Rockey
Do the dash in the whip, Ricky Bobby
Pop a Perc', now I'm feeling like a zombie
Drop a deuce in my Sprite-colored Wocky
(yeah, yeah, skrrt)
Father told me that I'll never go far
(Go far)
Didn't listen, I was geekin' off a bar
(A bar)
Pass the time, we was looking at the stars
(Stars) pass the time 'cause I
Only just turned sixteen
And I didn't know what love was
Yeah, ayy, didn't know what loss was
Woah, RIP to a loved one
Ayy, RIP to a loved one (Skrrt)
Golden heart on the sleeve for the taking
I can tell the whole time she was fakin'
(Alright)
Baby, I just wanna know what your name is
Found her with my best friend
They were naked

Cross on neck for the ones I hate (Cross)
Friday's here, got the drugs in my veins
(yeah) pop two Xans, now she wanna give face
I got bands that I wanna go waste (Skrrt)
Friday's here, so don't be shy
Take me higher than the sky
Friday's here, so let's be friends
Pop that seal, the night won't end


Imagine yourself you just went to sleep
It was a hard day
You take a deep breath and close your eyes
And the nightmare begins

Last night
I think I made love with the devil
She turned my tears into diamonds on my bezel
After we finished
My heart feel like it'd been severed
I don't want to let this go, no, not ever
Last night was a fast night
Don't know what just happened last night
But it felt right
I don't know what happened last night
Last night
Don't want this to be my last night
Last night don't know where I'm at
Don't know where I've been
Baby, please stay by my side
Please don't let me sin
Open all the doors, keep
On pouring fours, yeah, ayy
Yeah, all I want is more
Going to these places that
I've never been before go and buy designer
I might go and buy the store
Never will I drop a dime
On top a fuckin' whore
Driving from my problems
Skrrt off in Aventador
This is my world, I can do what I want
I can write my own story
Paint it with my own font
I can see who I want, I can be who I am
I've been riding downtown with your
Bitch in my hands where you at? Like
What's up? Haven't seen you in a month
Are you good? Are you great?
I've been tryna speculate
What's the deal? How you feel? Have
You lost all your appeal?
What happened to our perfect
Duo Kobe and Shaquille?

The magic of accompaniment
Taylor made in the fashion of today
For this occasion, this singer and this song
