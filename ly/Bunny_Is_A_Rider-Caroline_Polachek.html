		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bunny is a rider
Satellite can't find her
No sympathy
Hmm, ain't nothing for free
Bunny is a rider
Satellite can't find her
No sympathy
Hmm, ain't nothing for free
Bunny is a rider
No sympathy
Hmm, ain't nothing
Bunny is a, Bunny is a, a rider
Satellite can't find her
No sympathy
Hmm

But I'm so non-physical
I do, I do, feel like the lady
I do, I do, fireworks blazing
I do, I do, heart is unbreaking
I do, I do, but don't drop my name

Bunny is a rider (Bunny is a)
Satellite can't find her
No sympathy
Hmm, ain't nothing for free
Bunny is a rider
Giddy up, can't find her
No sympathy
Hmm, ain't nothing for free
Dirty like it's earth day
Tryna wet that palette
Can you cut that check
Crush that wreck
Run out empty on 'em
AWOL on a Thursday
Tryna go ask Alice
Tryna catch that rabbit

But I'm so non-physical
I do, I do, feel like the lady
I do, I do, fireworks blazing
I do, I do, heart is unbreaking
I do, I do, but don't drop my name

Bunny is a, Bunny is a, a rider
Can't find her, eeh
(Ain't nothing)
Bunny is a, Bunny is a, a rider
Can't find her, eeh

Yeah, I'm so non-physical
I do, I do, feel like the lady
I do, I do, fireworks blazing
I do, I do, heart is unbreaking
I do, I do, but don't drop my name

Bunny is a, Bunny is a, a rider
Can't find her, eeh
(Ain't nothing)
Bunny is a, Bunny is a, a rider
Can't find her, eeh
(Ain't nothing)
Bunny is a, Bunny is a, a rider
Can't find her, eeh
(Ain't nothing)
Bunny is a, Bunny is a
Bunny is a rider
