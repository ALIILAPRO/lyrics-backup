		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I think the universe is on my side
Heaven and Earth have finally aligned
Days are good and that's they way it should be

You sprinkle stardust on my pillow case
It's like a moonbeam brushed across my face
Nights are good and that's the way it should be

You make me sing "Ooh la la laa"
You make a girl go "Ooh ooh"
I'm in love, love

Did you see that shooting star tonight?
Were you dazzled by the same constellation?
Did you and Jupiter conspire to get me?
I think you and the Moon and Neptune got it right
'Cause now I'm shining bright, so bright
Bright, so bright

And I see colors in a different way
You make what doesn't matter fade to grey
Life is good and that's the way it should be

You make me sing "Ooh la la laa"
You make a girl go "Ooh ooh"
I'm in love, love

Did you see that shooting star tonight?
Were you dazzled by the same constellation?
Did you and Jupiter conspire to get me?
I think you and the Moon and Neptune got it right
'Cause now I'm shining bright (ooh) so bright
And I get lost in your eyes

Did you see that shooting star tonight?
Were you dazzled by the same constellation?
Did you and Jupiter conspire to get me?
I think you and the Moon and Neptune got it right
I think you and the Moon and Neptune got it right
I think you and the Moon and Neptune got it right
'Cause now I'm shining bright, so bright
Bright, so bright
Bright, so bright
And I get lost in your eyes tonight
