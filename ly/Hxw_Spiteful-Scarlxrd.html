		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Weh di bloodclaat do yuh? Siddung, siddung
Cyanide
Plague
Yeah, yeah, okay
Pu- Pu- Pull up that boy! (Blergh)

Can't get down like the rest, I'm a winner, can't lose, I fixed up (Die)
Speak from the heart in my chest, changed all of the O's to a crisscross (Wheel!)
The reminder's all in my head, if they try me again, I'll kick off (Pussy)
I'm not down and depressed like you, I'm grown and pissed off
Life done hit me a few times, I swear life hits like a pussy
I've been to hell and back multiple timеs and I'm still here comfy (Fuck)
I'm built differеnt to the other guys, with this game, I've studied
Put work in this shit, can't take what's mine, I'll leave man bloody
These niggas want war, let's have it
Pure talk from your jaw, let's have it
I'm down for the brawl, let's have it
My dogs on call, let's have it
Pull up on maul, let's have it
You said you want more, let's have it
Allow the talk, let's have it
Ayy, pussyhole, come, let's have it
All these lies I told myself while growing up (Die)
One day I'll be satisfied with just enough
They told me use my power for the greater God
But fuck that shit, I'll fucking kill the both of us (Oh, rawf)
Argh, fucking kill the both of us, yeah, oh

Spite, spite
Spite, spite
Spite, spite
Spite, spite

I can feel no pain
I can feel no pain
I can feel no pain
I can feel no pain

(Rawf, rawf)
Me no wan' nobody ah to talk to me right now, hear? (Rawf)
Everyting alright
Ready?

Ready for anything, nigga, I'm up
Shoutout 2018, that year was enough
Put a target on niggas, I ain't gotta look
I was promised a war but these pussies are shook
On the grind like I'm poor, I got money, I'm good
They so broke that they bring up my name with no love
In my heart I could quit this and wrap up my gloves
I'm still training and grinding my sword, I want blood

Spite, spite
Spite, spite
Spite, spite
Spite, spite

I can feel no pain
I can feel no pain
I can feel no pain
I can feel no pain
