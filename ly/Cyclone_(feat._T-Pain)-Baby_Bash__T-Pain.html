		  (Oh oh oh its fud a dud a nine)

She moves her body like a cyclone
And she makes me want to do it all night long
Going hard when they turn the spotlights on
Because she moves her body like a cyclone
Just like a cyclone
She moves her body like a cyclone
And she makes me want to do it all night long
Going hard when they turn the spotlights on
Because she moves her body like a cyclone
A mighty cyclone

I look at that double on the back a that bumper
She ain't even playing when shes shaking that rumpa
And oh you ain't know
She gets lower than a muffla
Even wit her girl friends
Show stopping with a hustler
The way she move her body
She might see the Maserati
She wanna put it on me
Trying to show me her tsunami
She make it hard to copy
Always tight and never sloppy
And got an entourage
And her own paparazzi
Now there she go again
Riding through the stormy weather
You better button up if you wanna go getta
Cause it is what it is
And everybody wanna love her
But when she pop it boy you better run for cover

She moves her body like a cyclone
And she makes me want to do it all night long
Going hard when they turn the spotlights on
Because she moves her body like a cyclone
Just like a cyclone
She moves her body like a cyclone
And she makes me want to do it all night long
Going hard when they turn the spotlights on
Because she moves her body like a cyclone
A mighty cyclone

(It's a wrap)
When she breaks them boys of a tycoon
(It's a wrap)
Better get that fatty like a boss tycoon
(It's a wrap)
Now hold it steady cause she make a monsoon
(It's a wrap)
Now you can Google download the iTunes
She what I'm saying
She ain't playing
And she got them heads turning
You gonna her it clack-clack
When them heals get to burning
(clack-clack)
Stiletto so fuego
She got her own label
And got us all doing the tornado

She moves her body like a cyclone
And she makes me want to do it all night long
Going hard when they turn the spotlights on
Because she moves her body like a cyclone
Just like a cyclone
She moves her body like a cyclone
And she makes me want to do it all night long
Going hard when they turn the spotlights on
Because she moves her body like a cyclone
A mighty cyclone

Shortie got looks
And shortie got class
Shortie got hips
And shortie got ass
Plus she hit the stage
She drop it down low like
(Rew rew rew rew rew rew rew rew)
Ah this is crazy
Its amazing
She must be the weather lady
She be looking like
(Rew rew rew rew rew rew rew rew)

She moves her body like a cyclone
And she makes me want to do it all night long
Going hard when they turn the spotlights on
Because she moves her body like a cyclone
Just like a cyclone
She moves her body like a cyclone
And she makes me want to do it all night long
Going hard when they turn the spotlights on
Because she moves her body like a cyclone
A mighty cyclone

(Rew rew rew rew rew rew rew rew rew rew rew rew rew rew rew)
