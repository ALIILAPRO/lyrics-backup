		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh, yeah-yeah-yeah

Tell me if you comfortable with it
Uh, lay on the couch and let's get busy
Type to make you fuck 'til you finish, yeah, uh
Lean in the Fanta got me feeling fucking dizzy, whoa

I just took a shot of that Henny, uh (oh yeah)
Immediately got me losing my mind and
If they want the smoke, then I'm ready (I'm ready, yuh)
She got a hold on me, I told her, "Hold tight"

Aleyuh, you wanted a neck so cold
Put that shit in the freezer, oh
But we don't have to take that road
Save your money, Aleyuh
Save it up, yeah
Run it, run it, run it, run it up, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You Keep me stuck here
All I need for you to roll a blunt, yeah, yeah, yeah
I ain't picky, bitch, I want it all
Fifty bitches, I'm gon' ride 'em all
Get them bitches outside, please don't let them in at all
Yeah, I got one bitch and she got it all, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, roll up, I'm on your side
Keep applying pressure to the fucking sky
Drop-top, I pop up for when we pull up Aleyuh, yeah, yeah
For you girl, I fly, yeah
Watch that little bitch, yeah
She's up out here in Arizona, what up?
I might
And I, yeah
You keep talking on me
I don't know that bitch, yeah
Driving through the city, drinking berry soda
When I'm with your bitch, no, I'm never sober
Bumping through the get-up, thought I woulda told ya?
Your lil' bitch, she tryna suck my dick, yeah
I'm balling up the front like I'm the king, yeah
If I want some, I get up and call Naveed

Hey, Naveed, you're in deep shit, it's Chris 
Why is that guy, Dan's voice still on my message? Get rid of it
I said eight times, get rid of it, I swear to god, I'm gonna come in
I'm gonna grab the phone and I'm gonna smash it on your desk 
Look, I need you to call me because D-ray is calling with questions
Call me when you get in, bye

Lean in the Fanta got me feeling fucking dizzy, whoa
I just took a shot of that Henny (oh yeah)
Immediately got me losing my mind and
If they want the smoke, then I'm ready (I'm ready, yuh)
She got a hold on me, I told her, "Hold tight"

Aleyuh, she wanted a neck so cold
Put that shit in the freezer, whoa
But we don't have to

Lean in the fanta got me feeling fucking dizzy, whoa
I just took a shot of that Henny (oh yeah)
Immediately got me losing my mind and
If they want the smoke, then I'm ready (I'm ready, yuh)
She got a hold on me, I told her, "Hold tight"

Aleyuh, she wanted a neck so cold
Put that shit in the freezer
