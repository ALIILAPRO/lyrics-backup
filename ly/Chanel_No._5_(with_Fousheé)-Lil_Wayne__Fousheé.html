		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I bought my bitch some Chanel Number 5
Five star the blicky, I rep for the five
Cum on that bitch, she a snail full of slime
Pull the trigger like the tail of a lion
Four finger ring, leave a ring 'round your eye
Bussdown brass knuckles, she wink and I fuck her
You blinkin', I blocka, that Nina I'm tuckin'
Just call me Big Buzzalino, I'm buzzin'
I let the stick talk for me, I'm a puppet
Fuck around, you could get sprayed, hey

I see the hate everywhere with my eyes
Lil' bae just text, "Where you at?" No reply
I skeet in her face, she laid back, open wide
Before we had cake, niggas had humble pie
I smell like cream and Chanel Number 5
You smell Codeine when I belch before I
I put OG in the air, that's a log
Choppa gon' ring like, "Hello? It's for y'all" (Hello?)
Coco Chanel
All of my niggas, they Loco Chanel
I'm only puttin' West Coast in the L
Okay, okay, now I'm smokin' Chanel
Rich as a bitch, I'm like Oprah Chanel
All of these niggas, they broker than nails
All off these niggas, they jokin', Chapelle
I spent a millon on Venmo and on Zelle

And it's flyin' off the shelf
They wanna rip off our style and wear it like Chanel

Yeah, I think they want me to fail
They know damn well if it's featurin' Foushee then that shit gon' sell
They don't acknowledge but dip in the well
I got a Grammy while clippin' my nails
Huh, I ain't gotta prove shit, I could scream in this bitch
Got the pop bitches rockin' out hard, then switch
New sound, new wig, new cadence, brand new style
You could copy now, I'm singin' like, "Mm-hmm, alright"
I don't gotta try hard, it's so light
Got all of this green, it's go time
I'ma make 'em go mad in no time
They sayin' shit gettin' spooky
So I put my money on Tunechi
I put my heart in that loose leaf
So I never trust, never lose sleep

And It's flyin' off the shelf
They wanna rip off our style and wear it like Chanel
Thats' why I wanna be like myself
They wanna rip off our style and wear it like Chanel

I bought my bitch some Chanel Number 5
Five star the blicky, I rep for the five
Cum on that bitch, she a snail full of slime
Pull the trigger like the tail of a lion
Four finger ring, leave a ring 'round your eye
Bussdown brass knuckles, she wink and I fuck her
You blinkin', I blocka, that Nina I'm tuckin'
Just call me Big Buzzalino, I'm buzzin'
I let the stick talk for me, I'm a puppet
Fuck around, you could get sprayed, hey

Okay, I got that white girl, Adele
I got that white girl, Adele
What is all this fake shit that I smell?
Boy, I'm goin' apeshit like Pharrell
Wait, I smell like weed and Chanel Number 5
I make her scream 'til I tell her, "Be quiet"
Get on your knees and make me weak in mind
I say, "Oh, yeah," like three-sixty-five
"Oh, yeah" like three-sixty-five
I smell like her and Chanel Number 5
I'm twistin' purple and yellow, LeBron
I feel like earth, wind and fire combined
I smell like weed and Chanel Number 5
His bitch smell like me, he can smell when she lyin'
He punchin' her nose, but won't dare hit a guy
That nigga pussy and his girl pussy mine
I smell like Snoop and Chanel Number 5
He throw up the deuce, I just held up a five
I'm faster, my nigga, just fell from the sky
There's love in the air, hold my breath, count to five

Blink-blinkin', I blocka, that Nina I'm tuckin'
I let the stick talk for me, I'm a puppet (yeah, yeah)
