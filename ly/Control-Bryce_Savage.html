		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She's got a secret underneath...
Yeah she's his naughty little freak...
She likes to put on a show...
She likes when he takes control...
Yeah he gon make her legs shake
They gon make the bed break
They gon get into some trouble, little danger they both crave
When they put on a show...
She likes when he takes control...

She a little baddie with a natty little figure
She gon call him daddy when he's hitting all the triggers
She know how to move when she loose off the liquor
What a view, tattoos, she a mood, she a giver
She know how to lay it down, get a little freaky
She don't like just anybody, but with him she's easy
He know how to give her what she wants, what she's needing
He know how to hit the right spots when he's leading
Uh
He on the attack, got her eyes rolling back
When he lifting her, flipping her, tighten the straps
When he training his baby, cuz she been a brat
Heavy breathing and clawing, he love the feedback
Yeah
cnd they like to get nasty 
Whether in the bedroom or the backseat
Like a drug they be hooked need it badly...

She's got a secret underneath...
Yeah she's his naughty little freak...
She likes to put on a show...
She likes when he takes control...
Yeah he gon make her legs shake
They gon make the bed break
They gon get into some trouble, little danger they both crave
When they put on a show...
She likes when he takes control...

She got dark eyes
cnd a dark mind
She been up to no good as a part time
She got a unique look in the star light-
She could drain a bank account if she played her cards right...
But she only got eyes for him
Yeah he's a lucky man cuz she a dime, a ten
She know how to keep him coming back time again
Cuz she a loyal little freak, it's hard to find them...

She know how to
Drop low with it
To the floor with it
She been taking classes on the pole with it
I just like when she puts on a show with it
So go slow with it
Yeah go slow with it
...She got tricks that you've never seen
Good god body fixed in my memory
She been doing things that should be felony....

She's got a secret underneath...
Yeah she's his naughty little freak...
She likes to put on a show...
She likes when he takes control...
Yeah he gon make her legs shake
They gon make the bed break
They gon get into some trouble, little danger they both crave
When they put on a show...
She likes when he takes control...
