		  Witches Don't Fall in Love (feat. Kristoffer Rygg)

She said "witches don't fall in love"
Skull ring shimmered round her finger
Raven hair, red burning lips, talks bout Lovecraft
Was I sober? I don't think so
I paid the bill and snuffed the cigarette
As it was slowly smouldering in my hand
Curled up in the cab back to my place
Then I blacked out, and fell from grace

Ooo ooo ooo
She said witches don't fall in love
Ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo
She said witches don't fall in love

I found her number etched into my arm
I called her up and her voice made my world turn
She won me over with them devil tricks
I was the prey, she was a beast
The night was day and the day was night
Our bodies coiled in the light of the moon
I sacrificed my soul to wake the dead
Blood was wine, and flesh was bread

Ooo ooo ooo
She said witches don't fall in love
Ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo
She said witches don't fall in love

The sky's on fire
Their feet was off the ground
Sorceresses tripping round the funeral pyre
In a state of nature black magic spellbound
Through the mist, she sent me a smile
And then she whispered, witches don't fall in love
Dagger sharp ran around my belly
Oh Lord give me courage by your staff and your rod
When I crawl through the valley of death
