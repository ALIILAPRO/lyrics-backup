		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And I've been down this road before a thousand times and I realise 
am I wasting my time am I toeing the line 
between the shadows I keep within the shadows I keep within? 

And I've been I've been waiting been waiting for the storms to drown me out 
and my screams have been fading been fading out to the sounds but 
you say you've got me 

I said I said hold me dear 
and you said you said don't you forget about all I've done 
I'll wear your heart like a keepsake 
I said I said hold me dear 
and you said you said listen to me we've come this far 
and that's when you asked me to lay my guard down 
to lay my guard down. 

And I've been down this road before a thousand times 
but I realise is it time that I give in to this state of mind 
just to find my highs justify my lies 

I've been I've been waiting I've been waiting for the storms to drown me out 
and my screams have been fading been fading out to the sounds but 
you say you've got me 

I said I said hold me dear
you said you said don't you forget about all I've done 
I'll wear your heart like a keepsake 
I said I said hold me dear 
you said you said listen to me we've come this far 
and that's when you asked me 

but lord knows well I've tried but I need you now I need you now 
lord knows well I've tried so hold me down so hold me down 

I said I said hold me dear 
and you said you said don't you forget about all I've done 
I'll wear your heart like a keepsake 
I said I said hold me dear
you said you said listen to me we've come this far 
and that's when you asked me to lay my guard down 
to lay my guard down
