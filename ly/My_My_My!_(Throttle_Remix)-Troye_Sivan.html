		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Shine on, diamond
Don't make me wait another day
'Cause passion is passion
You know it just as well as me, mm

Now, let's stop runnin' from love, runnin' from love
Let's stop, my baby (my baby)
Let's stop runnin' from us, runnin' from us
Let's stop, my baby

Oh my, my, my
I die every night with you
Oh my, my, my
Living for your every move

Spark up, buzzcut
I've got my tongue between your teeth (uh)
Go slow, no, no, go fast
You like it just as much as me (uh, yeah)

Now, let's stop runnin' from love, runnin' from love
Let's stop, my baby (my baby)
Let's stop runnin' from us, runnin' from us
Let's stop, my baby

Oh my, my, my
I die every night with you
Oh my, my, my
Living for your every move
Oh my, my, my
I die every night with you (ooh, you know)
Oh my, my, my (Oh my, my, my)
Living for your every move (your every move)

Oh my, my, my
My, my, my

Should be the last night ever
Should be the last night we're apart
Got my name on this treasure
On this treasure

Oh my, my, my (oh my, my, my)
I die every night with you
(I die, I die, I die, I die, yeah yeah)
Oh my, my, my (oh my, my, my)
Living for your every move
(Living for, living for, yeah)
Oh my, my, my
I die every night with you
(Oh my, my, my, oh my, my, my)
Oh my, my, my
Living for your every move
(Living for your every move)
Oh my, my, my
