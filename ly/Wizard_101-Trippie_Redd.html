		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They want war, we get it done, choppa squad, get a gun
I got sticks up in the ride, boy, like Wizard 101
Death wizard on 'em, yeah, ice wizard in Moncler
I'm in the dungeon in Margiela shoes, better get a pair
You better get in there, keep me a chop, I shoot anywhere
I'm with a bitch, she a witch, she a (woo)
Puttin' her hands in the air
I don't give a fuck, I don't ever care
Rub on her butt, I pull on her hair
I know you a pussy, you not a bear
She on my nuts, grow you a pair

I know that I'm real and it's not fair
I don't even question when nobody there
Life is killin' I'm feelin' my share
I'm aimin' the choppa, if the devil is near
I know that you fake, not even sincere
Look at my face, I ain't droppin' no tears
I'm out in the jungle with lions and bears
See the headlights and get hit like a deer
I'm out in public, they look at me weird
My money grown, I grew me a beard
Still on that young nigga shit, get the shears
Out of my mind, not what I appear
I'm blowin' her mind, she like my appeal
Grippin' her thighs and wearin' her heels
Say that they mine and then I gotta bill
If you step on that mine, you gon' be spilled milk
All of they music you sittin' in filthy
Drape me in diamonds and muhfuckin' silk
I'ma sit on a island and fuck me a MILF
And that bitch call me "Steve," 'cause I like to build
That bitch call me "Link," got the iron and shield
Ain't no Nobu for me, I'ma dine in the hills
Bitch, it's Call of Duty, I keep me a Galil
We was straight in the deal, leave him dead at the shelf, leave him dead, give him shells
Crack his brain out his shell, roll this dope in the shell, used to trap out of Shell
Play with my name and I'm givin' 'em pain, I'm givin' 'em flame, I'm givin' 'em hell

They want war, we get it done, choppa squad, get a gun
I got sticks up in the ride, boy, like Wizard 101
Death wizard on 'em, yeah, ice wizard in Moncler
I'm in the dungeon in Margiela shoes, better get a pair
You better get in there, keep me a chop, I shoot anywhere
I'm with a bitch, she a witch, she a (woo)
Puttin' her hands in the air
I don't give a fuck, I don't ever care
Rub on her butt, I pull on her hair
I know you a pussy, you not a bear
She on my nuts, grow you a pair

(I know that I'm real and it's not fair)
