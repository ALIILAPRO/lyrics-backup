		  Listen man
What's up?
I heard you done got you a dime piece, man
Hell nah, man
One of the Beyoncé, Meagan Good types
Nah, nah, nah
Is that true, man?
I just wanna know
Probably not
I mean, shit, to be honest with you, man, she's a

Bad thang (shit), fine as hell (woo), thick as fuck
Oh my God (damn), that's my baby
Caroline, you divine
Mighty fine
Shawty really blow the pipe (that's true)
Like a pro
Fuck you though
Holy shit, I'm really lit (it's lit)
It's looking like it's 'bout time to fuck it up (word)
Caroline, listen up, don't wanna hear
About ya horoscope or what the future holds
Shut up and shut up and

Let's get gory, like a Tarantino movie
Don't wanna talk it out, can we fuck it out?
'Cause we gon' be up all night, fuck a decaf
You say I'm a tall thug, guess I'm a G-raffe
If ya want safe-sex, baby use the knee pads
Freaky with the sticky-icky, baby give me kitty kitty

Killa, westside nigga
Boy you like ninety eight degrees and I'm three hundred, nigga keep ya feet runnin'
I Chief Keef keef when I eat these beats, better boy get scurred
Don't run up in my lane, I don't want you in my lane, you a lame, get swerved

'Cause great scenes might be great
But I love your bloopers
And perfect's for the urgent
Baby, I want forever
Caroline, don't you see that
I want you to be my

Bad thang (shit), fine as hell (woo), thick as fuck
Oh my God (damn), that's my baby
Caroline, you divine
Mighty fine
Shawty really blow the pipe (that's true)
Like a pro
(Haha, what?)
Holy shit, I'm really lit (it's lit)
It's looking like it's 'bout time to fuck it up (word)
Caroline, listen up, don't wanna hear
About ya horoscope or what the future holds
Shut up and shut up and

Let's get gory, like a Tarantino movie
Don't wanna talk it out, can we fuck it out?

Bad thang, bad, bad, bad, bad thang, thang, thang, thang, thang
Bad thang, thang, bad, bad, bad, b-b-bad, thang, thang
Bad thang, thang, thang, bad, b-bad, bad thang, thang, thang
Bad thang, thang, bad, bad, bad, b-b-bad
