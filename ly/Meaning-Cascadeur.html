		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm strange man
Like a ranger
I'm invisible
Like a monster

But someday you'll understand
The meaning of my life 
But someday you'll understand
The meaning of this world

I'm the speaker
Of the silence
I'm the question, now
To your answer

But someday you'll understand
The meaning of my life 
But someday you'll understand
The meaning of this world

But someday you'll understand
The meaning of my life 
But someday you'll understand
The meaning of this world

But someday you'll understand, oh
The meaning of your life
