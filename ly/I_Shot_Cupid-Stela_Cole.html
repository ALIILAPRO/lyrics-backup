		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I shot cupid, ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba bang
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love again
La-la-la love again
 
You broke my heart when I told you not to
And now I keep on crying in the bathroom
And in the club too, it's like a monsoon
I wanna hate you (hate you)
 
You took my hand, told me not to be scared
But then you disappeared like you were never there
It's been a nightmare, and not that you care
But I hate you (hate you)
 
Did what I had to do
To get up, up over
 
I shot cupid, ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba bang
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love again
La-la-la love again
 
I shot cupid, ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba bang
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love again
La-la-la love again (yeah)
 
I swear I'm not even that psychotic
And, baby, it's your fault I'm so obnoxious
You broke a promise, better be cautious
I'm off my rocker now, like
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, I'm back on my bullshit now
 
Did what I had to do
To get up up over
 
I shot cupid, ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba bang
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love again
La-la-la love again
 
I shot cupid, ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba bang
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love again
La-la-la love again (yeah)
 
Fairytales can kiss my (mwah)
Happy endings never last
Cupid's dead, you're out my head
Put-put-put my heart to rest
 
I shot cupid, ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba bang
I don't wanna fall in love again
 
I shot cupid, ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba bang
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love again
La-la-la love again
 
I shot cupid, ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba bang
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love again
La-la-la love again (yeah)
