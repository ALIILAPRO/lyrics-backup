		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We become the night

The rich get richer while the sick get sicker
The profits from the people feed the poor another needle
The flames get bigger while the moths all shiver
They're subsidizing evil with no budget for a sequel

The Prozac's gift wrapped with a smile
The cash grab never goes out of style
Your flashbacks givin' you a panic attack
When your eyes go pitch black

We become the night
Where hope survives
We embrace the shadow following behind
So come alive, and take back your soul
While we become the night

They pull the trigger like a cold heart killer
But then they play the victim to manipulate the system
They synthesize reality to sell what you don't need
They drain us of our portion just to paint another portrait

The Prozac's gift wrapped with a smile
The cash grab never goes out of style
We're cutting the ties with the knives in our backs
When your eyes go pitch black

We become the night
Where hope survives
We embrace the shadow following behind
So come alive, and take back your soul
While we become the night

Creatures crawling out from hell with
Vengeance in our hearts
As the hourglass becomes your reaper
We've come to take what's ours

We become the night
Where hope survives
We embrace the shadow following behind
So come alive, and take back your soul
While we become the night
So run and hide
Screaming out like thunder, lightning cracks the sky
Close your eyes, don't walk towards the light
Yeah, we become the night

We become the night
We become the night
