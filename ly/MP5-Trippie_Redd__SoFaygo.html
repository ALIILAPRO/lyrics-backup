		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm too far gone
Yeah

Hop out a GT3 with an MP5, yeah (bah)
I got ice like Alaska, jet to Dubai (on gang, yeah)
Had to spread my wings, teach 'em all how to fly, yeah
You niggas square, divide 'em by pi
Yeah, rollin' 'round, three GMC's, 'bout to be a drive-by (brrah, brrah)
Your lil' homie know what's up with me, talk down, you gon' die (you gon' die)
Keep that .40 on my lap, I spent like twenty-four on my wrist (woo)
When you see me out in L.A., just know I'm ballin' like Kobe (woo)

I've been number one, bitch, don't need no trophy
Know we crackheads, pass me the rock and I'll be ballin' like Kobe
Ridin' down the 101, not no Zoey
I stay stackin' with my twin for the win, Zach and Cody
You niggas be hatin', Mister Moseby (Mister Moseby-ass nigga)
Stackin' it up on lowkey
Stay stackin' up, rackin' up, triple OG (stack, stack, woo)
Fuck stress, stay blessed, stay away from the phonies (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Hop out a GT3 with an MP5, yeah (bah)
I got ice like Alaska, jet to Dubai (on gang, yeah)
Had to spread my wings, teach 'em all how to fly, yeah
You niggas square, divide 'em by pi
Yeah, rollin' 'round, three GMC's, 'bout to be a drive-by (brrah, brrah)
Your lil' homie know what's up with me, talk down, you gon' die (you gon' die)
Keep that .40 on my lap, I spent like twenty-four on my wrist (woo)
When you see me out in L.A., just know I'm ballin' like Kobe (woo, go, yeah)

Light that shit up (go, yeah)
Walk in the spot, I'ma pipe shit up (yeah, yeah)
Yeah, them niggas hatin' my swag, them niggas so bitter (yeah)
I thought I told them lil' niggas I'm hard hitta (takin' that shit to the heart)
Yeah, I thought I told you lil' niggas I'm go getter (tell them lil' niggas I'm God)
Pressure don't matter, like how could you fold nigga? (How could you, bitch? Oh my God)
How could you let that hate sit in your soul, nigga? (How could it sit in your soul?)
Yeah, shawty a demon, a real soul switcher (oh my God, how did you know?)
Y'all niggas steppin' on toes (go)
Handle that shit like you grown (brrah)
Doin' this shit on my 'lone, ayy
I got that bag on my own (whoa)
Fuck it, I'm in the zone
Ghost, like, nigga, I'm God (skrrt, skrrt)
Hop in that Ghost, I'm ghost, I'm gone

Hop out a GT3 with an MP5, yeah (bah)
I got ice like Alaska, jet to Dubai (on gang, yeah)
Had to spread my wings, teach 'em all how to fly, yeah
You niggas square, divide 'em by pi
Yeah, rollin' 'round, three GMC's, 'bout to be a drive-by (brrah, brrah)
Your lil' homie know what's up with me, talk down, you gon' die (you gon' die)
Keep that .40 on my lap, I spent like twenty-four on my wrist (woo)
When you see me out in L.A., just know I'm ballin' like Kobe (woo)
