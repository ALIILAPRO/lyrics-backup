		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lord, Help me walk
Another mile, just one more mile,
I'm tired of walkin' all alone.

Lord, Help me smile
Another smile, just one more smile,
I know I just can't make it on my own.

I never thought I needed help before,
I thought that I could do things by myself.
Now I know I just can't take it any more.
With a humble heart, on bended knee,
I'm beggin' You, please, Help Me.

Come down from Your golden
Throne to me, to lowly me,
I need to feel the touch of Your tender hand.

Remove the chains of darkness
And let me see, Lord let me see,
Just where I fit into your master plan.

I never thought I needed help before,
I thought that I could do things by myself.
Now I know I just can't take it any more.
With a humble heart, on bended knee,
I'm beggin' You, please, Help Me.
