Von beat his body, they think he Illuminati
I'm talkin' Gucci Gucci 'cause we don't do Huaraches
Can't wife no thotty thotty, man, she want X and molly
And she caught two new bodies, I'm talkin' Thug and Yachty
I told her call me when she horny
Why you put the feds on me?
I cover the tats with Gucci long-sleeves
They got my back forever, broski, yeah

All she do is geek until the mornin'
All she do is geek until the mornin'
She be geekin' 'til the mornin'

Yeah, oh, oh (yeah, yeah yeah)
Yeah, oh, oh, oh (yeah, yeah)
Yeah, how'd you got it? How'd you want it? How you get it, baby?
Never stop it, get it poppin' every fuckin' day
Kawasaki, Maserati, only rockin' Giuseppe Zanotti
You want problems, don't you?
Baby, don't play-play, this your payday
Baby, don't play-play, this your payday
I got swan, not baguettes where my neck lay
Thirty carat VVS's when you're ready
I take care of your body like you RiRi, baby
Play the marriage all night on your TV, baby
R.i.p. Biggie and fuck the NYPD
Chicago polices, Atlanta, and all PCs (woo)
Fuck the police, and they'll lock you up for decease-'cease (yeah)
It don't matter, I got bitches at the DMV (woo)
Roll with me, flood your neck with rosary (yeah)
Rollin' me like a rolly-polly please, woo

Almost there (there), oh, you ready now? (Ready)
I just paint the coupe redder than spaghetti now
Fuck her so good, think about it in her sleep (Ew)
She call me Freddy now (woo), she rock baguetties now
She wanna fuck the Pendergrass, Teddy loud
She got a thumb in her ass, pull it out (boop)
I might get her higher than a blimp (woo)
She said her last nigga was a shrimp (oh)

Baby girl, can I please fuck on your friendses?
If you say yes, I might buy you a Benzes (go), you a lil' princess (yeah)

Bitch try her, she beat her up the worst way (boom)
My lil' gutter bitch, she can't wait to shake somethin' (yeah)
