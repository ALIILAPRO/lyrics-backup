		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Look away, I don't wanna be seen
Stop my heart from running away from me
Pick you up if that's even allowed
Stop that, play it down
Squeeze my hand but they don't see
I'm not sure if it's even safe for me
Hold it back, as much as I can
Fuck that, take a chance

If it's true love, it will wait for us
And I'll try so hard to prove
If that's something that you want me to do
And if I'm holding back or I don't react
Is it just too good to be true?
How could things be so much better with you?
If it's just too good to be true
How come things are so much better with you?

Don't wanna rush, we just got free
I can't pretend, yeah, something's changed in me
As we slow dance in the street
We don't need no sleep
Whispering what we need to hear
Both scared that it might just disappear
Or maybe we might not even last
No way, not a chance

If it's true love, it will wait for us
And I've got so much to prove
If that's something that you want me to do
And if you're holding back or you don't react
Is it just too good to be true?
How could things be so much better with you? Yeah (ah)
If we've got so much to lose?
How come things are so much better with you?

True love
How come things are so much better with you?
True love
How come things are so much better with you? Yeah
Aw, maybe it's really this easy 
You seem fine and maybe you're right
Aw, I suppose I'll just look past this feeling
It gives us a reason to be anything that we like
Ah, ah
How come things are so much better with you? Yeah
Ah, ah
All the things are so much better with you
