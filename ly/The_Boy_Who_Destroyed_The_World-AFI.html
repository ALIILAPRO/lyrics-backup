		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Once there was boy who had vibrant glow, but as it goes, someone took it from him
One day through the rain I heard him meekly moan, he said
"Will you wrap your arms around me as I'm falling?"

Remember when remember when remember when we were all so beautiful?
Never again never again
But since then we've lost our glow

They said it hurt their eyes but he would never know that they were filled with regret as their own
He said, "I now feel more desperately alone, even though they wrapped their
Arms around me as I'd fallen."

Remember when remember when remember when we were all so beautiful?
Never again never again
But since then we've lost our glow

Remember when remember when remember when we were all so beautiful?
Never again never again
But since then we've lost our glow

They said it hurt their eyes, but he would never know that they were claiming
Regret as their own
Their own dissipated
