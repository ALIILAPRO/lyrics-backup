		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Thought that i could fly but i'm falling
Time is passing me by and i'm getting tired just having to try
I'm trying to hold onto all that i've got
I've got so much love, where have my wings gone?
'Cause i need a break from my brain
Lost in myself and now i'm going crazy
Slowly crazy
Words never hold the substance my heart holds
If life is a staircase then i'm getting old
'Cause i need a break from my brain
I think too much (too much, too much)
I ruin it for me
And i don't know the destination, living in a world full of self deprecation
And time is passing me by and i am so tired just having to try
I'm trying to hold onto all that i've got
I've got so much love, where have my wings gone?
'Cause i need a break from my brain
Lost in myself and now i'm going crazy
Suddenly crazy
Words never hold the substance my heart holds
If life is a movie then i'm getting bored
'Cause i need a break from my brain
