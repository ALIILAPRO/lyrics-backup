		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My favorite view is me
Covered in you
Nothin' but my perfume
Oh I love the taste of you

Turquoise bedroom
Crystal clear ocean view
Play some Badu, please do
Oh on and on and on and on

Yeah you take me to another time zone
Without ever even leavin' my door
Steady ride it to another life though
Oh I look up and we in Morocco

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Okay now my face, your throne
Baby girl, daddy's home
And we're still goin' strong
I'ma pick her up and then it's on
Ain't no neighbors on the top floor
Now we in Morocco
Baby cold, I can make her hot though
Come again, oh you want an encore?
My face, your throne 
Baby girl, daddy's home
6 Zone goin' strong, yeah

Yeah you take me to another time zone
Without ever even leavin' my door
Steady ride it to another life though
Oh I look up and we in Morocco

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
