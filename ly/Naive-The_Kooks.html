		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm not saying it was your fault
Although you could have done more

Oh, you're so naïve, yet so

How could this be done
By such a smiling sweetheart?
Oh, and your sweet and pretty face
In such an ugly way
Something so beautiful
Oh, that every time I look inside

I know she knows that I'm not fond of asking
True or false, it may be
Well, she's still out to get me

And I know she knows that I'm not fond of asking
True or false, it may be
She's still out to get me

I may say it was your fault
Because I know you could have done more

Oh, you're so naïve, yet so

How could this be done
By such a smiling sweetheart?
Oh, and your sweet and pretty face
In such an ugly way something so beautiful
Oh, that every time I look inside

I know she knows that I'm not fond of asking
True or false, it may be
Well, she's still out to get me

And I know she knows that I'm not fond of asking
True or false, it may be
She's still out to get me

Ooh

So how could this be done
By such a smiling sweetheart?

Oh, you're so naïve, yet so

It's such an ugly thing
For someone so beautiful
I'll die every time you're on his side

I know she knows that I'm not fond of asking
True or false, it may be 
Well, she's still out to get me

And I know she knows that I'm not fond of asking
True or false, it may be 
She's still out to get me

Just don't let me down
So just don't let me down
Hold on to your kite
Just don't let me down
Just don't let me down
Hold on to your kite
Just don't let me down, oh
Just don't let me down
Hold on to this kite
Just don't let me down
Just don't let me down
