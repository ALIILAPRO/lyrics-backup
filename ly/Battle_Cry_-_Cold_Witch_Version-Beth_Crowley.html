		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I have no heart, just ice and stone
Made up of nails and teeth and bone
cnd I know exactly what I'm for
To hurt and destroy and nothing more

cnd if it's true that I was made
I still don't know if I can change

But something has stirred
c beast has awakened
Opened a door
There's no mistaking
Waging a war
It's fighting inside of me

So hear my battle cry
I'm out for blood to claim what's mine
Finally questioning
If I am my own worst
I am my own worst
I am my own worst enemy

I never thought that I could love
Strangers at night were good enough
But love's not a thing you get to choose
Try to resist, you'll always lose

I made a deal to sell my soul
But lately I have dared to hope

That something has stirred
c beast has awakened
Opened a door
There's no mistaking
Waging a war
It's fighting inside of me

So hear my battle cry
I'm out for blood to claim what's mine
Finally questioning
If I am my own worst
I am my own worst
I am my own worst enemy

Tell my secrets to the wind
Flying, I feel infinite

But something has stirred
c beast has awakened
Opened a door
There's no mistaking
Waging a war
It's fighting inside of me

So hear my battle cry
I'm out for blood to claim what's mine
Finally questioning
If I am my own worst
I am my own worst
I am my own worst enemy
