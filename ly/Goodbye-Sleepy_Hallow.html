		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Great John on the beat by the way

Yeah, uh
Baby, I'm back and I'm better
Said she love me, I'm makin' it wetter
Yeah, she only left 'cause I let her
I'm like, how you gon' step on a stepper?
Yeah, bro on the block with Bereta
Cold as fuck, said he need him a sweater
Nah, I'm finna go get him a jacket
If I pass you this grip, better blast it

I hit it once and I'm probably gon' pass it
Body different, I'm still with the action
Niggas be cappin', uh
Heard what happened to him, yeah, I know, it's tragic
Smokin' and laughin'
Bitch, I'm only happy if I get the backend
Bad bitch, how you classy and ratchet?
She throw it back, told me, "Clap it and slap it", uh
You know I'm stuck in the madness
It get bloody if we get it crackin', uh
Nah, he ain't gang, he ratted
Sippin' muddy, got opps in the ashes, uh
G-Lock still do damage
Don't know shit if the cops start askin', uh
This your shit, start spazzin'
You know I get it lit like matches
We just be startin' shit up
I'm like Giannis, I stay with them bucks
Yeah, slidin', we parkin' him up
Keep it shootin', he Daffy the Duck
Yeah, bro put 'em down, get 'em up
Leavin' shit like he forgot to flush
Uh, still get them packs in a rush
Still movin' tact, I still could get you brushed, uh
I never ask for much
I got opps, so I have to clutch
It ain't even Christmas, we wrapped him up
In the trap, I was baggin' up
Now I'm with your bitch in the back of truck
Think I like her, she bad as fuck
She said, if I'm gon' spend a bag or what
If I'm gon' pop a tag or what
What car do I drive, is it fast enough
Ninety-three when I gas it up
I been on the block, had to pass it up
Did it twice so they know it ain't luck, uh

Yeah, look
Baby, I'm back and I'm better
Said she love me, I'm makin' it wetter
Yeah, she only left 'cause I let her
I'm like, how you gon' step on a stepper?
Yeah, bro on the block with Bereta
Cold as fuck, said he need him a sweater
Nah, I'm finna go get him a jacket
If I pass you this grip, better blast it
Look
Baby, I'm back and I'm better
Said she love me, I'm makin' it wetter
Yeah, she only left 'cause I let her
I'm like, how you gon' step on a stepper?
Yeah, bro on the block with Bereta
Cold as fuck, said he need him a sweater
Nah, I'm finna go get him a jacket
If I pass you this grip, better blast it
