		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We ain't leavin'
We ain't leavin'

Private afterparties
Red carpets
Real barbies
Fish scale taunt me
They reel ya in
Just to hold you back

Don't need your MTV
Fuck your press
If it ain't 'bout USD
Save your breath
Grew up on EBT, VHS
Unc said play us if you want
But we gon' make a mess

We ain't leavin'
We ain't leavin'
Hell naw, we ain't leavin'
No, we ain't leavin'

'Til six in the morning
Six in the morning
Nah, we ain't leavin' (nah, we ain't leavin')

Kick in the door
You won't get answers
Too late to board
This plane doesn't land
Take off your coat
Take off your mask
We gon' take what we want 'cause this shit never lasts

'Til six in the morning
Six in the morning

We ain't leavin'
We ain't leavin'
Hell naw, we ain't leavin'
No, we ain't leavin'

'Til six in the morning
Six in the morning

At two there's little reason
Three, the phones are ringin'
Four, we ain't leavin' no more, no more
By four her grip is weak
At five we might be tweakin'
Six, they kick our ass out the door, the door

We ain't leavin'
We ain't leavin'
Hell naw, we ain't leavin'
No, we ain't leavin'
We ain't leavin'
(At two there's little reason)
(At three the phones are ringin')
(Four, we ain't leavin' no more, no more)
We ain't leavin'
(By four her grip is weak)
(At five we might be tweakin')
(Six, they kick our ass out the door, the door)
We ain't leavin'
