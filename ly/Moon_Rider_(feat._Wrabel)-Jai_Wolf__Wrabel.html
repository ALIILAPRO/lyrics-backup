		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I would go anywhere you are
Nowhere is too far
Anywhere you are

Driving straight into the dark
Up the boulevard
Shooting up the stars

Your head right on my shoulder
I swear I'll be your soldier
Just keep pulling me closer

And if our days are numbered
We'll find eternal summer
I see it all in bright color

Anywhere you are
Oh, anywhere you are
Anywhere you are
Anywhere you are

Your head right on my shoulder
I swear I'll be your soldier
Just keep pulling me closer

And if our days are numbered
We'll find eternal summer
I see it all in bright color

Anywhere you are
Oh, I would go anywhere you are
Oh, anywhere you are
Oh, anywhere you are
Oh, anywhere you are
I would go anywhere you are
