		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You got a way with me
Somehow you got me to believe
In everything that I could be
I've gotta say, you really got a way

You got a way it seems
You gave me faith to find my dreams
You'll never know just what that means
Can't you see, you got a way with me

It's in the way you want me
It's in the way you hold me
The way you show me just what love's made of
It's in the way we make love

You got a way with words
You get me smiling even when it hurts
There's no way to measure what your love is worth
I can't believe the way you get through to me

It's in the way you want me
It's in the way you hold me
The way you show me just what love's made of
It's in the way we make love

Oh, how I adore you
Like no one before you
I love you just the way you are

It's in the way you want me
Oh, it's in the way you hold me
The way you show me just what love's made of
It's in the way we make love

It's just the way you are
