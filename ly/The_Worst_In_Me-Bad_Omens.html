		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Is there nothing left to keep myself awake?
To keep the walls from caving in
When all they ever do is try to bend and break
Is there forgiveness in the end?

I need relief (a failure's coming on)
Just breathe in deep (it's taking far too long)

I had you in my grip but you're starting to slip
Bring out the worst in me
And now it's come to end, I think I'm giving in
You set my demons free

It seems no matter where I look it's always gone
With you I know I'll never win
And it's hard to say where it went so wrong
And failed me in the end

I need relief (a failure's coming on)
Just breathe in deep (it's taking far too long)
I need relief (this weakness carries on)
Please be a dream (or was it all along?)

I had you in my grip but you're starting to slip
Bring out the worst in me
And now it's come to end, I think I'm giving in
You set my demons free

It's better when you're with me but that's better left unsaid
It's better when I'm empty but I still let you in
It's better when you're with me but that's better left unsaid
It's better when I'm empty but I still let you in

I had you in my grip but you're starting to slip
Bring out the worst in me
And now it's come to end, I think I'm giving in
You set my demons free
I had you in my grip but you're starting to slip
Bring out the worst in me

Please won't you stay for me
Don't ever let me be
You set my demons free
