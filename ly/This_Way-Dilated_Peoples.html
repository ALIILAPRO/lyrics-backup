		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now turn it up, turn it up (a little louder)
Turn it uup, turn it up (little louder)
Now turn it up (can't live my, I, I can't live my)
(I can't live my, I, I can't live my)
Now turn it up, turn it up

(Yeah) Yo, I can't live my I, I can't live my
Life this way, continuously get high
Instead of runnin 'round, lock one bird down
It's a new day gotta do it big just to get right
Show no respect can't live that way
You hold my check can't live that way
Without my chick on deck, can't live that way
They say what they like, but I've been that way
Our moves calculated through the lens, almost here
Success will be the best revenge
Man, from Clint East' to Kanye West (whut up, whut up!)
The sun can't chill but everyday it sets (everyday!)

This time I made up my mind
This time I'm back on my prime
I know there's things in my life
That I'ma let go startin' tonight
(I can't live my, I, I can't live my)
(I can't live my, I, I can't live my)
I can't live my, I, I can't live my
I can't live my life this way (can't live my, I, I can't live my)
This way (I can't live my, I, I can't live my)
This way, I can't live my, I, I can't live my
I can't live my life this way

My favorite girl wanna leave me just because I got a girlfriend
My freak girl told me now, she a christian
My white girl wanna move back to Michigan
I'm pullin' girls off the bench like a sixth man
I'm in the club doin' the same ol' two step
While Omegas doin' the same ol' "Q" step
I have my money on my mind I was thinkin' green
She a pledge A.K.A. She was pink and green
I wanna a good girl she want a gentleman
We sayin' the same thing like a synonym
I wasn't really spittin' game I was scrimmaging
My penmanship's so hard it needs censorship
I'ma Chicagoan till Chicago ends
Till we blow like Chicago wind
I don't know what's better, gettin' laid or gettin' paid
I just know when I'm gettin one, the other's gettin' away
This way

This time I made up my mind
This time I'm back on my prime
I know there's things in my life
That I'ma let go startin' tonight
(I can't live my, I, I can't live my)
(I can't live my, I, I can't live my)
I can't live my, I, I can't live my
I can't live my life this way (can't live my, I, I can't live my)
This way (I can't live my, I, I can't live my)
This way, I can't live my, I, I can't live my
I can't live my life this way

Go 'head, flip a coin so the game don't stop
Believe I know the drama, kid name the part
I learnt before the hot flame came the spark
It's like before the pop fame came the park
But this industry'll play with yo' life man
They playin with yo' rent, food, water and lights man (yeah)
That's why Rakaa brings it like that ol' "Tidy T" jam
The battleram, then I'm off to Amsterdam
To rest up for strength to deal with this weight
To deal with these deals to deal with this hate
I dedicate this Jam Master Jay
Run-D.M.C. Showed me how to walk, this way

This time I made up my mind
This time I'm back on my prime
I know there's things in my life
That I'ma let go startin' tonight
(I can't live my, I, I can't live my)
(I can't live my, I, I can't live my)
I can't live my, I, I can't live my
I can't live my life this way (can't live my, I, I can't live my)
This way (I can't live my, I, I can't live my)
This way, I can't live my, I, I can't live my
I can't live my life this way

This way
This way
This way, ay
This way
This way
This way
This way, ay
