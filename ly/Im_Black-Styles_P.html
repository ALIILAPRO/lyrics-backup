		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (I'm black)
Whether I'm poor or rich, or rich or poor
Though its all the same shit
(I'm black)
Even though my skins kind of light
That means my ancestors was raped by somebody white
(I'm black)
So I like to sing dance and crack jokes
Eat good food and be around black folks
(I'm black)
Sort of like the Holy's on Sundays
Drink all night and still go to work Monday
(I'm black)
So I like the kids looking real nice
Cause I've been poor and I know what it feels like
(I'm black)
And I'ma say it loud like James Brown
People be proud cause we all up in the game now
(I'm black)
And I'ma hold my right fist real high
Might see my man and we might get real high
(I'm black)
And I know it, and I ain't afraid to show it
(I'm black)
And I'm the genius in the motherfuckin' Poet
You know it

(Oh oh)

[Chorus]
So proud to be just who I am
So proud to say that I'm me
So proud to be just who I am
So proud to be so free
(I'm black)
So proud to say that I made it
(I'm black)
The one who struggled in the hatred
(I'm black)
And I'm not afraid to say it
(I'm black, cause I know I'm Sinking)

(I'm black)
So I gotta heart full of bravery
Do for my peoples that went through Slavery
(I'm black)
So you know I'm young in the sports
Ninety percent chanced I get hung in the Court
(I'm black)
Don't you be scared of me Mister
Cause you don't really seem to be scared of my sister
(I'm black)
And I can ride first class too
Or buy an exotic car and like murk past you
(I'm black)
And I don't need a tan in the winter
Mind strong and powerful now a cypher can't enter
(I'm black)
And I don't need jewelry to shine
Look in my skin color is like the jewelry is blind
(I'm black)
They focus on the negative attention
Do something positive, and never get mentioned
(I'm black)
Listen it's a fact, original man
I wouldn't change it if I could and that's that

So proud to be just who I'am
So proud to say that I'm me
So proud to be just who I'am
So proud to be so free
(I'm black)
So proud to say that I made it
(I'm black)
The one who struggled in the hatred
(I'm black)
And I'm not afraid to say it
(I'm black)
(I'm black, I'm black, oh, yeah, yeah)

(I'm black)
Even with a caramel complexion
Look in the mirror see Malcolm and Martin reflection
(I'm black)
Just like the panther, looking for an answer
It's prejudice shit is like a cancer
(I'm black)
Look in my eyes the wall can't get pulled over
Look in my cars and stay gettin pulled over
(I'm black)
Me the public enemies number one
Government looking in the hood sending in the gun
(I'm black)
I grew up off the good time show
Drink liquor smoke weed and let the good times roll
(I'm black)
I live for my wife and my seeds
And my mom with a bond only God can acceed
(I'm black)
I got to show my homeboys love
First thing you learned in the hood is homeboy love
(I'm black)
And I'm mad if I ain't nothin' else
(I'm black)
I'm beautiful and I love myself (Say together)
Yeah! (Love myself, oh yeah)

So proud to be just who I am
So proud to say that I'm me,
So proud to be just who I am
So proud to be so free
(I'm black)
So proud to say that I made it
(I'm black)
The one who struggled in the hatred
(I'm black)
And I'm not afraid to say it
(I'm black)
(I'm black, I'm black, yeah)
