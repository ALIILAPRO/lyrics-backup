		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can you take me far away somewhere I can rest my head
Can you take me far away from here?
Yeah I want to see the stars but I can't do it alone
I want to see the stars with you
Can you take me far away somewhere I can rest my head
Can you take me far away from here?
Yeah I want to see the stars but I can't do it alone
I want to see the stars with you
I said I can't do it all alone, no I can't be on my own
yeah I just wanna lay down with the stars and you
And I fall down deeper, down deeper
Yeah I fall down deeper, down deeper
Can you take me far away somewhere I can rest my head
Can you take me far away from here?
Yeah I want to see the stars but I can't do it alone
I want to see the stars with you
Can you take me far away somewhere I can rest my head
Can you take me far away from here?
And I fall down deeper, down deeper
Yeah I fall down deeper, down deeper
