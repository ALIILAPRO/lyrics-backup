		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I’m not taking back anything I’ve said yeah
Fuck out of here with all those sorry’s that you’re best at
I’m tryna’ to make it through the trenches
Catch all this action
Go off on tour and swear I’m never looking back then
I’ve seen everybody watching but nobody’s talking
Don’t need validation I’m just thinking how iconic
It’s gon’ be, when I step on to that stage
I’ll have Alex in the back always, keeping for my six, See I’m
Built for this shit like
Kobe in the fourth coming clutch with a three like,
Micheal with the notes bitches screaming out their lungs like,
Fire in my chest, I’m not, taking any rest, Ima pop em with the hits
Fallen
But I’ve got angels watching over me
Why you keep hoping I don’t leave my ends
Wait till you get to see what I became
Fallen
But I’ve got angels watching over me
Why you keep hoping I don’t leave my ends
Wait till you get to see what I became
She a little pisces
Loved her to death but she went left me in a crisis
Likeable but she’s always movin’ in disguises
Now I’ve been working through the night to up my prices
I might be leaving
And I ain’t never coming back to this direction
Shit had me fucked up for a while I was pretending
And I ain’t ever coming back from where I’m heading
Fallen
But I’ve got angels watching over me
Why you keep hoping I don’t leave my ends
Wait till you get to see what I became
Fallen
But I’ve got angels watching over me
Why you keep hoping I don’t leave my ends
Wait till you get to see what I became
Fallen
