		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're the one that I've been waiting for
Gotta quit this cryin'
Nobody's gonna heal me if I don't open the door 
Kinda hard to believe, gotta have faith in me

Freak out, I freak out, I freak out, I freak out (look at me) 
I get down, I get down, I get down, I get down (look at me) 
I freak out, I freak out, I freak out, I freak out 
Look at me now 

'Cause all I ever wanted was love 
Hey-ya, hey-ya (ooh)
Hey-ya, hey-ya (ooh)
Hey-ya, hey-ya
All I ever wanted was love 
Hey-ya, hey-ya (ooh)
Hey-ya, hey-ya (ooh)
Oh, yeah, oh yeah

I want your stupid love, love 
I want your stupid love, love 
(Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh) 
(Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh) 

Now it's time to free me from the shame
I gotta find that peace
Is it too late or could this love protect me from the pain? 
I would battle for you, even if I break in two

Freak out, I freak out, I freak out, I freak out (look at me) 
I get down, I get down, I get down, I get down (look at me) 
I freak out, I freak out, I freak out, I freak out 
Look at me now 

'Cause all I ever wanted was love 
Hey-ya, hey-ya (ooh)
Hey-ya, hey-ya (ooh)
Hey-ya, hey-ya
All I ever wanted was love 
Hey-ya, hey-ya (ooh)
Hey-ya, hey-ya (ooh)
Oh, yeah, oh yeah

I want your stupid love, love 
I want your stupid love, love 
(Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh) 
(Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh) 

I don't need a reason (oh) 
Not sorry, I want your stupid love 
I don't need a reason (oh) 
Not sorry, I want your stupid love 
Ah, yeah, ah yeah

I want your stupid love, love (whoa, oh, oh, woo) 
We got a stupid love, love
(Love, love, oh, oh-oh, oh) 
(Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
I want your stupid love, love 
(Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh) 
(Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
I want your stupid love, love
