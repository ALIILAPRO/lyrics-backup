		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  His death is permanent only if
The bullet is fired by
A woman who loves him enough to die with him

You make me feel like I'm six feet deep
Going outta my mind
Without you there's no me
Feel like this other time
I can't help myself around you
I'm six feet deep, going outta my mind
Without you there's no me
Feel like this other time
I can't help myself around you

I'm in my mind, yeah I wish we had the time
To work things out and get it right, yeah
Without you I feel alone, stuck at home
Staring at you on my phone, yeah

Why does it always end this
Way? No black and white, we in the gray
We were fine just yesterday
Everything good comes to an end
I guess it's true
But I don't wanna just be your friend

You make me feel like I'm six feet deep
Going outta my mind
Without you there's no me
Feel like this other time
I can't help myself around you
I'm six feet deep, going outta my mind
Without you there's no me
Feel like this other time
I can't help myself around you

Six feet deep and you're looking at me
Like I'm the crazy one for thinking
'bout what we couldn't be
Oh, I think I could use a minute
Let me gather all my thoughts and intuitions
Like oh my God, I'm the realest guy
That you really like and you spend the night
Then I open up my eyes
And realize it was all in my head

You make me feel like I'm six feet deep
Going outta my mind
Without you there's no me
Feel like this other time
I can't help myself around you
I'm six feet deep, going outta my mind
Without you there's no me
Feel like this other time
I can't help myself around you
