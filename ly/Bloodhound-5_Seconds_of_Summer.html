		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ah-ah-ah

I love the heat, I love the noise
I love my name inside your voice
Do you still feel it all?
Do you still feel it all?
A million nights under the Sun
I know my life has just begun
And I wanna feel it all
I wanna feel it all

Bloodhound
I'm pickin' up the vibes all around
I'm dumb enough to drown it out
No, I can't let it go
Bloodhound
I'm livin' in the violet sounds
I'll kick it with your friend afloat
Oh, I can't let it go

(He sunk his teeth into the bone)
He took an ale and he won't go home
Like he's gonna lose it all
Like he's gonna lose it all
It took a while for me to see
Take off your mask on Halloween
You can let 'em see it all
You can let 'em see it all

Bloodhound
I'm pickin' up the vibes all around
I'm dumb enough to drown it out
No, I can't let it go
Bloodhound
I'm livin' in the violet sounds
I'll kick it with your friend afloat
Oh, I can't let it go

We can party 'til when the room is on fire
Spend all our money on our dirty desires
We can party 'til when the room is on fire
And I can't let it go, oh, oh, oh

Bloodhound
I'm pickin' up the vibes all around
I'm dumb enough to drown it out
No, I can't let it go
Bloodhound (ooh, ooh)
I'm livin' in the violet sounds (ooh, ooh)
I'll kick it with your friend afloat (ooh, ooh)
Oh, I can't let it go

(Bloodhound)
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ah-ah-ah
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh, I can't let it go
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ah-ah-ah
(Bloodhound)
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ah-ah-ah
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh, I can't let it go
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ah-ah-ah
