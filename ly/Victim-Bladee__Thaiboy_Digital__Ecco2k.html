		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm in too deep, I know
In too deep, I know
In too deep, I know

I love to play the victim, I love to play the victim
I love to play the victim, I love to pass the blame
I love to play the victim, I love to play the victim
I love to play the victim, I love to pass the blame

I made a promise not to eat forbidden fruits
Some like it sour, I want you to be my grapefruit
Some like it sweet, don't do it, it's not good for you
I really know I shouldn't do it, but I've got to
I've got to stop it, I've got to get a grip (I can't stop)
I've got to stop it, I've got to get a grip (I can't stop)
I've got to stop it, I've got to get a grip (I can't stop)
I've got to stop it, I've got to get a grip (I can't stop)
I made a promise to myself (promise to myself)
I made a contract with myself (never rest in the hands of somebody else)
(Contract with myself)
I walk around, leave no footsteps, left, right, left
(Never rest in the hands of somebody else)
(I walk around, leave no footsteps, left, right, left)

I ain't really think about it (I ain't really think about it)
I don't wanna try to hurt nobody (I don't wanna try to hurt nobody)
I don't want to hurt my own soul too (I don't want to hurt my own soul too)
I don't wanna try to hurt nobody
I don't want to hurt my own soul too

I love to play the victim, I love to play the victim
I love to play the victim, I love to pass the blame
I love to play the victim, I love to play the victim
I love to play the victim, I love to pass the blame
