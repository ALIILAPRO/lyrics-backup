		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, oh, na-na
Shot after shot

I can get you Fendi, Prada, Christian, Gucci
Baby, spend some time, I spend this change like loose leaf
Hot like Grabba, come here, mama
Baby, spin around, let me see how you move loosely
Hop inside the Lambo, it's just us in the two-seat
Everything I got on from the shoes to hat is beasty
Plenty Henny, I'm feelin' woozy
I took too many tonight, it's a movie

Look, take shots, take shots, take shots
Shot after shot (yeah)
What drink you drink? 'Cause I'm tryna ease your mind
Sip slow, don't drink fast, I'm tryna make this last
Oh, oh-oh

I can tell you got tension, tension, tension (yeah)
I need transparency, tell me what's on your mind
Take shots like backshots, mad shots, shot after shot (look)
(Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah, nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah)

Ayy, I can get you drunk, sloppy, top me
Get ahead low like lobby, beat it up, Rocky
Chain swingin', name ringin'
Shit changed, don't entertain the same women
Drunk, woozy, ooh, I like your vibe
Let's stop by the Jacuzzi
And I like your frame in La Perla, Gucci
French bitch from Montana, told her I'ma Shmurda dance in that coochie
Look, fuck all that singing shit, let's keep it raw and rugged
I wanna see you take shots 'til your body's all in my covers
And your friends threesoming, and they talkin' all these discussions
And we at the table speakin' who who freaky
And doin' what when we back at the spot
Magnums come out the box and never go back in the box
She take shots like backshots, she's backing the shots
My dick hop out the zipper, somethin' like Jack in the Box
You know I made it turn, shot o'clock, stop actin' so shy, come on

Look, take shots, take shots, take shots
Shot after shot (yeah)
What drink you drink? 'Cause I'm tryna ease your mind
Sip slow, don't drink fast, I'm tryna make this last
Oh, oh-oh

I can tell you got tension, tension, tension (shot after shot) (yeah)
I need transparency, tell me what's on your mind
Take shots like backshots, mad shots, shot after shot (look)
(Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah, nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah)

Baby, we can do a trio, me, you and your migo
Sippin' Casamigos, yeah-yeah-yeah
I wanna see you deepthroat, girl, that ass is lethal
Bust it then I reload, yeah-yeah-yeah
Tryna see how bad you can get when you drop
Even though you're dangerous, I love the way you walk
Seems like you're anxious, don't gotta hide your scars
Imperfectly perfect, not a single flaw, nah, nah, nah
My bag different, count up mad chicken
From New York, she like my accent, I make her act different
She want Richard Mille status, skip the Patek
Cut from a different car, she a different fabric
She think I need sex everyday
Hop inside the double R, just take me away
Your eyes reflect the stars when we fuck in the Wraith
We both got Amiri on our legs
Grab yo' waist and lift yo' legs to yo' waist
Look, get in the car, don't touch nothin'
Sit in the car, let's discuss somethin'
Either we fuckin', or I, look
I'll end up switchin' uo the subject on her, look
I ain't with nothin', you gon' suck it, or not?

Nah, look, nah, nah, nah, nah
Look, nah, nah, nah, nah
Nah (whoa-whoa)
Woo

Look, take shots, take shots, take shots
Shot after shot (yeah)
What drink you drink? 'Cause I'm tryna ease your mind
Sip slow, don't drink fast, I'm tryna make this last
Oh, oh-oh

I can tell you got tension, tension, tension (yeah)
What drink you drink? 'Cause I'm tryna ease your mind
Take shots, take shots, shot after shot
