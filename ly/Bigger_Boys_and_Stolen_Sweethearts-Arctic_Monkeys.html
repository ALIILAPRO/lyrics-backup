		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's always somebody taller with more of a wit 
And he's equipped to enthrall her and her friends think he's fit
And you just can't measure up though, you don't have a prayer
Wishing that you'd made the most of her when she was there 

They've got engaged, there's no intention of a wedding 
He's pinched your bird and he'd probably kick your head in 

Bigger boys and stolen sweethearts 
Oh, you're better off without her anyway 
You said you wasn't sad to see her go 
Yeah, but I know you were though

Now you don't know what she's up to, you can only assume
If she's not in the front of the shops then they've gone to his room
Bet she's gone 'round in her school stuff, bet that's what he likes
I know you thought she were different and you thought she were nice

But she's not nice, she's pretty fucking far from nice
She's looking at you funny rarely looking at you twice

Bigger boys and stolen sweethearts
Oh, you're better off without her anyway
You said you wasn't sad to see her go
Yeah, but it's so clear you were though 

Have you heard what she's been doing? Never did it for me 
He picks her up at the school gates at twenty past three 
She's been with all of the boys but never went very far 
And she wagged English and Science just to go in his car 

They've got engaged, there's no intention of a wedding 
He's pinched my bird and he'd probably kick my head in 
Oh, now the girls have grown 
Yeah, but I'm sure that they still carry on in similar ways 

Bigger boys and stolen sweethearts
Oh, you're better off without her anyway
You said you wasn't sad to see her go
Yeah, but I'm only pretending, you know 
Yeah, I'm only pretending, you know 
I was only pretending, you know 
I was only pretending, you know
