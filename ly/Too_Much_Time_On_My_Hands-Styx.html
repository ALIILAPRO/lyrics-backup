		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, here I am sitting on this bar stool,
Talking like a damn fool
Got the twelve o'clock news blues
And I've given up hope for the afternoon soaps
And a bottle of cold brew
Is it any wonder I'm not crazy
Is it any wonder I'm sane at all
 
Well I'm so tired of losing
I've got nothing to do and all day to do it
Well I'd go out cruising, but I've no place
To go and all night to get there
Is it any wonder I'm not a criminal
Is it any wonder I'm not in jail
 
Is it any wonder I've got too much time on my hands
It's ticking away with my sanity
I've got too much time on my hands
It's hard to believe such a calamity
I've got too much time on my hands
And it's ticking away, ticking away from me

Too much time on my hands
It's tick tick tick tick ticking away (Too much time on my hands)
Now I don't know what to do with myself (Too much time on my hands)
 
Too much time on my hands
Too much time on my hands
Too much time on my hands

Now I'm a jet fuel genius
I can solve the world's problems
Without even trying
I've got dozens of friends, and the fun never ends
That is as long as I'm buying
Is it any wonder I'm not the President
Is it any wonder I'm null and void

Is it any wonder I've got too much
Time on my hands
It's ticking away with my sanity
I've got too much time on my hands
It's hard to believe such a calamity
I've got too much time on my hands
And it's ticking away, ticking away from me

Too much time on my hands
Tick tick tick tick tick ticking away (Too much time on my hands)
Now I don't know what to do with myself (Too much time on my hands)
Umm mmm (Too much time on my hands)
Tick tick tick ticking away (Too much time on my hands)
Umm mmm (Too much time on my hands)
Too much time on my hands
Too much time on my
