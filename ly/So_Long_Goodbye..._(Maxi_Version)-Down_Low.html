		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This song goes out to all the people who out there who have broken relationships,
Misunderstanding and no trust, 
And it goes a little something like this
So long goodbye
Are you ready? 
Here we go, down low style

Uh, uh, check it out
Many nights, I lay alone in my bed, 
Looking back on the letter she wrote, I just read
I can't forget the moments and times I have of you, 
Is she save, dear lord, to my loneliness rules
Shall I pick up the phone and just dial or maybe shall I think it over, for a while?
The pain is so deep every time in my sleep and I record it all when I weep
But now we stay distant from one another, 
New people in our lives that we claim as lovers
Touching her really don't quite feel the same, 
If you ever been in love once feelings never change
I hope one day she realizes and see she could have it all if she´d stay with me
Some nights I wish I wouldn't break down and cry, 
But live must take its course
So long goodbye?

So long goodbye, there's no need to cry no more, so baby just dial oh dial
No need to cry, I will be back here in times of need to be by your side (c'mon)
So long goodbye (so long goodbye baby) there's no need to cry no more, so baby just dial
No need to cry (no need to cry baby), I will be back here in times of need to be by your side

Can you understand that the way that I feel or life tearing us apart for real
I wish I could playback time, 
But she got her life and I got mine
Before I have to go and before I die, 
It's a struggle to live to keep my dreams alive
But one day I swear I'm gonna reach my goal and just to be on top, 
Without selling my soul
And maybe then we can work this out, 
And maybe then you'll understand what I'm talking about
Cause what I do, take concentration, to keep up the life in steady rotation
But one thing I want you to know in this song, 
I'll be your right to correct your wrong
If you need me, yo!, I'll be here by your side, 
To vanish away all your pain, so long goodbye?

So long goodbye, there´s no need to cry no more, so baby just dial oh dial
No need to cry, I will be back here in times of need to be by your side (c'mon)

C'mon, uh
Can't tell you why I'm leaving, can't tell you where I'm going to
Can't tell you where I'll be upon of that
Can't tell you why I'm leaving, can't tell you where I'm going to
Can't tell you where I'll be upon of that

So long goodbye baby
Uh, bring it back yo

So long goodbye (no need to cry baby) there's no need to cry no more, so baby just dial
No need to cry, I will be back here in times of need to be by your side
So long goodbye (so long goodbye baby) there's no need to cry no more, so baby just dial
No need to cry (no need to cry baby), I will be back here in times of need to be by your side

So now you know, people have between one another, all the misunderstanding and it goes a little something like this, check it out!
