		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Head to toe
Usually I keep it casual
Unpractical
Vertigo
Way she turned the room diagonal
Unnatural

'Cause she walks like a saint, floats like an angel
Sharp like a knife under the table
Can't feel my face, I should've stayed home
I know what she's doin', she's a lethal woman

She's a lethal woman
Ha-ha-ha

Shame
I came all this way just to feel this
Pain
Hallelujah, baby, line it up, take your
Aim
Know that I'm coming to get ya
'Cause game recognizes game
By the way, what's your name?

She walks like a saint, floats like an angel
Sharp like a knife under the table
Can't feel my face, I should've stayed home
I know what she's doin', she's a lethal woman

She's a lethal woman
Lethal woman, lethal woman, lethal woman
Ha-ha-ha

I didn't ask for this
But I'm not mad at it
So if I can't resist
I guess I'm powerless
I didn't ask for this
I'm not a masochist
I guess I'm into it
I like a lethal woman
