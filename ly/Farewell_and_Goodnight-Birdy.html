		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Goodnight, to every little hour that you sleep tite
May it hold you through the winter of a long night
And keep you from the loneliness of yourself
Heart strung is your heart frayed and empty
'Cause it's hard luck, when no one understands your love
It's unsung, and I say
Goodnight, my love, to every hour in every day
Goodnight, always, to all that's pure that's in your heart

Goodnight, may your dreams be so happy and your
Head lite with the wishes of a sandman and a night light
Be careful not to let the bedbugs sleep tight nestled in your covers
The sun shines but I don't
A silver rain will wash away
And you can't tell, it's just as well
Goodnight, my love, to every hour in every day
Goodnight, always, to all that's pure that's in your heart
