		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take, take, take it for granted
This time there are no second chances
My magazine
A single bullet
Took my best shot
Lived to the fullest
One foot over the edge
This is my heritage

Rotting underneath
These roots
Don't feed me

Leaves fall to the ground
Decay without a sound
To nourish the family
I often wish
I don't see yourself in me

Rotting underneath
This woodwork
Has no stability

Like broken branches, falling from trees to nourish the earth
New life will come to birth

Took my last shot
Lived to the fullest
Both feet over the edge
This is my heritage
