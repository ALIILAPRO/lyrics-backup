		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh, save me
Save me from myself
Ooh, be gentle
Gentle with myself
God knows this time
I'll never lose myself
Now I know I can change the world
Without changing myself

God, protect me
You shield me with Your light
Heal those
Who are conflicted with the inside
I'm growing every day
Release me from this pride
Turn anger into peace
And lead with my inner child
