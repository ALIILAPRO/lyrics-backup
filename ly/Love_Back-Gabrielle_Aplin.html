		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Always your way
Won’t bend, we break
I give, you take
And now I’m running out of patience
I’m waiting, you’re so disappointing
Cause I give, you take
And now I’m running out of time
None left for me or anyone else
So why do you always think of yourself?

Only wanna know me when you’re lonely
Only call me when there’s no one else around
Give me all my time back
Give me all my love back
All I ever did was try to love you
And all you did was bleed me dry
But you don’t even text back
So I now I want my love back
Give me all my love back

I give, always
But this works two ways
Now it’s too late
Too bad I’ve worked you out
I know that look
It’s school boy it’s text book
This game it won’t work
Too bad I’ve found you out

This time, you won’t take from me
And nobody else
Cause I, I need to look out for myself

Only wanna know me when you’re lonely
Only call me when there’s no one else around
Give me all my time back
Give me all my love back
All I ever did was try to love you
All you did was bleed me dry
But you don’t even text back
So I now I want my love back
Give me all my love back
Give me all my love

You called me up again
You want us back together
Say you’re going to change
Saying you’ll be better
Telling me it’s our time
It’s now or never
You only think of yourself
You called me up again
You want us back together
Say you’re going to change
You’re telling me whatever
But I heard it for the last time ever ever
Cause I need to think of myself

Only wanna know me when you’re lonely
Only call me when there’s no one else around
Give me all my time back
Give me all my love back
All I ever did is try to love you
All you did was bleed me dry
But you don’t even text back
So I now I want my love back
Give me all my love back

Give me all my time back
Give me all my love back
Give me all my love back
