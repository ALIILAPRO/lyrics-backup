		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When you feel down and out
Sing a song (it'll make your day) yeah, yeah
You, it's the time to shout, oh now
Sing a song (it'll make a way) yeah
Sometimes it's hard to care
Sing a song (it'll make your day)
A smile so hard to bear
Sing a song (it'll make a way) yeah, oh no

Sing a song (sing a, sing a, sing a, sing a, sing a song)
Sing a song (sing a, sing a, sing a, sing a, sing a song)
Sing a song (sing a, sing a, sing a, sing a, sing a song)
Sing a song (sing a, sing a, sing a, sing)

Bring your heart to believing
Sing a song (it'll make your day) yeah
Life ain't about no retrieving, oh yeah
(It'll make a way)
Give yourself what you need
Sing a song (it'll make your day) yeah, yeah
Smile, smile, smile and believe
Sing a song (it'll make a way) a song, now

Sing a song (sing a, sing a, sing a, sing a, sing a song)
Sing a song (sing a, sing a, sing a, sing a, sing a song)
Sing a song (sing a, sing a, sing a, sing a, sing a song)
Sing a song (sing a, sing a, sing a, sing)

(Oh)

Sing a song
Sing a song
Sing a song
Sing a song
If you sing a song today
You will make a better way
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
