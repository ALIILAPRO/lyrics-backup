		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  IN THREE THEY PASSED AS FIMBULWINTER, NO SUMMER BORN IN BETWEEN.

GARM! HELGRIND!

IN TIMES OF BROTHER KILLING BROTHER,

CAME WAR AND FAMINE TO BE.

SEAS HAD FOUND MOUNTAINS CRUMBLING DOWN, THE SUN WAS SOON DEVOURED.

FENRIS ON THE LOOSE WOULD SWALLOW THE MOON.THE MIDGÅRD SERPENT ENTERED

INTO THE TWILIGHT OF THE GODS.

THE WHOLE OF YGGDRASIL WAS SHAKING AS MAN WOULD MARCH CLOSE TO HEL.

GARM! HELGRIND!

FROM MUSPELHEIM TO SPLINTER HEAVEN

ARRIVE DID SURT WITH HIS SWORD.

TIME FOR WAR OF WHAT WAS BEFORE HEARD THE HORN OF HEIMDAL.

FOLKVANG OPENED UP, ALL WARRIORS SOUGHT TO STORM OUT FROM VALHALLA.

THE SLOAPS OF VIGRID  THE FINAL GROUND.

THOR, ODIN MET THEIR FATE AS THEY ALL FELL.

INTO THE TWILIGHT OF THE GODS

FIRE AND DARKNESS! THE WORLD WENT UNDER!

AS ALL RETURNED INTO GINNUNGAGAP,

THERE ON THE PLAINS OF IDAVALLEN FAR,

GODS THAT REMAINED SAW NIDHUGG STILL ALIVE.

LIVTRÅNAD, LIV  NEW ERA HAD ARRIVED.
