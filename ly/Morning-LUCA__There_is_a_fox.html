		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Try to open my eyes
Roll over to the other side of the bed
Beams of sunlight through my window
I never knew but now I do know

Close the door and then I go out
I watch everybody go by their day
Sometimes I wonder where do they go
I never knew but now I do know

I hear and listen watch and see
Little things that comfort me
Welcome to my world
I'll show you everything I've found
In this world looking around

It's time to start going wild
Feel the wind through my hair as I ride with you
Who could've known that it feels so good
I never knew but now I do know

I hear and listen watch and see
Little things that comfort me
Welcome to my world
I'll show you everything I've found
In this world looking around

Long nights with wine that I may forget 
But I keep on drinking
Cup of tea in the morning when I wake up 
And I'll stay up, hear the sounds fade away

Don't know where I'll go 
I guess it'll show

Try to open my eyes
Roll over to the other side of the bed
Beams of sunlight through my window
I never knew but now I do know
