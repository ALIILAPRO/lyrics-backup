		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My head is spinning round
My heart is in my shoes, yeah
I went and set the Thames on fire, oh
Now I must come back down
She's laughing in her sleeve, boys
I can feel it in my bones
Oh, but anywhere, anywhere I'm gonna lay my head
Oh, I'm gonna call my home

Well, I see that the world is upside-down
Seems that my pockets were filled up with gold
And now the clouds, Well they've covered everything over
And the wind is blowing cold
Well, I don't need anybody
Because I learned, I learned to be alone
Well, I said anywhere, anywhere, anywhere I lay my head, boys
Well, I'm gonna call my home
