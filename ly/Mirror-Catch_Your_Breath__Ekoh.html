		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (The more I try
To change my reflection
The clearer and the clearer
The stranger in the mirror )

Another day another chance to
Wake up and hate myself
Or try to drown it out
Another day another wreck and
I think I need some help
Don't leave me to myself
Cuz I get tired of all these problems I've created
The only hell I ever made was in my head

The more I try
To change my reflection
The clearer and the clearer
The stranger in the mirror 
The more I fight off 
My imperfections 
The nearer and the nearer 
The stranger in the mirror
Oh the stranger in mir 
In the mirror
Oh the stranger in the mir
In the mirror

They say the medication would hold up
But therapy only works if ya show up 
In the mirror with a face full of cold blood
Looking at a person I don't even know huh
I tried numbing it down
I tried opening up
I tried telling them I'm lost but it don't help 
With a bottle in bag I keep circling down with all my demons until I'm caught in my own hell
Gotta get it right
What's the remedy I need just to live a life
Fake a smile for the world like this shits fine
But I'm dying on the inside

The more I try
To change my reflection
The clearer and the clearer
The stranger in the mirror 
The more I fight off 
My imperfections 
The nearer and the nearer 
The stranger in the mirror
Oh the stranger in mir 
In the mirror
Oh the stranger in the mir
In the mirror

I've been feeling empty
Somethings in the way
We can play pretend
And pretend that i'm okay 
I've been feeling empty
Often in a daze
I think I'm way too far gone but still -

The more I try
To change my reflection
The clearer and the clearer
The stranger in the mirror 
The more I fight off 
My imperfections 
The nearer and the nearer 
The stranger in the mirror
Oh the stranger in mir 
In the mirror
Oh the stranger in the mir
In the mirror
