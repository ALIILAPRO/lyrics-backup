		  (Is that Shoki on the beat?)
(Ice crank that shit)
(JORDY)

Shit these pussies do, gon' make me jump right off a cliff
Find out I'm a murderer, she jump right on the dick
Gunshot executions use the sounds in songs as kicks
Negative degrees inside the freezer where you live

When they find out I killed twenty-five people 
Will they still all be my fans?
Adore me like I'm Manson
Rituals in gardens, posters on the wall worship the son of Sam
We hooded like the Klansmen

Police helicopters
Call the fuckin' doctor
Devil in designer
Can't be any calmer
And when I get away with it, they gon' sit in horror
They gon' fuckin' pay for it, I'm gon' bring the drama
Pain (ewok, ewok)

Too high to do my shows, go down the calendar (ewok, ewok)
Devil in my soul talking backwards in algebra (no-no, no-no)
Bulletproof the coupe, four pound caliber (vyoom, vyoom, vyoom, vyoom)
Sippin' on this juice like the Jones Town Massacre (doot-doot-doot-doot)
Momma, you ain't gotta cry, I'm out them jail yards (ewok, ewok)
Look up in the sky I'm a hell star (vyoom, vyoom)
Bitch, I'm really high, I'm off twelve bars (gimmie that, gimmie that, gimmie that)
All my opps they gotta die like cell bars

Police helicopters
Call the fuckin' doctor
Devil in designer
Can't be any calmer
And when I get away with it they gon' sit in horror
They gon' fuckin' pay for it, I'm gon' bring the drama

Police helicopters
Call the fuckin' doctor
Devil in designer
Can't be any calmer
And when I get away with it they gon' sit in horror
They gon' fuckin' pay for it, I'm gon' bring the drama
Pain

Pain
