		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Get on your dancing shoes
There's one thing on your mind
Hoping they're looking for you
Sure you'll be rummaging through

Oh and the shit, shock, the horror
You've seen your future bride
Yeah, but it's oh so absurd
For you to say the first word
So you're waiting and waiting and

The only reason that you came
So what you scared for
Oh, don't you always do the same
It's what you there for, don't you know

The lights are flashing
Down in here tonight
And some might exchange a glance
But keep pretending to dance

Don't act like it's not happening
As if it's impolite
To go and mention your name
Instead you'll just do the same
As they all do, and hope for the best

The only reason that you came
So what you scared for
Well don't you always do the same
It's what you're there for but no

Get on your dancing shoes
You sexy little swine
Hoping they're looking for you
Sure you'll be rummaging through

And I said the shit, shock, horror
You've seen your future bride, yeah
Yeah, but it's oh so absurd
For you to say the first word
So you're waiting and waiting
