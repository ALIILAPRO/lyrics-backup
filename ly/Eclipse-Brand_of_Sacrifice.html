		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Your offerings have consecrated 
They are marked by the brand 
The sun has seen its fifth death for the red lake to flow again 
He will feel their pain in order to complete the final transformation 
A name new and old 

Falcon of Darkness, send us into an age of abyss 
Blinded by beauty with stacks of bodies as high as the eye can see 

(Feast apostles, feast) 

The one chosen by the hand of God 
The master of the sinful black sheep and the king of the faithful blind 

Welcome to the new age 
Welcome to the new age 
We are the branded ones
