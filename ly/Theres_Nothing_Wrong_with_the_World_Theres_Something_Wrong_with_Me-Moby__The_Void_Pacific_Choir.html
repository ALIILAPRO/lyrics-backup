		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Looked for a time when
I knew what to see
I'm just another person
With no personality
The TV's won't stop there
There's no skies in spring
I never said the right words
I tried to say what I mean

My life misses, I'm lost without hope
My loss chases and opens the door

I will find you, and you'll find me
I will save you, and you'll save me
The life we've broken
The life we see
There's nothing wrong with the world
There's something wrong with me

I can't stand when you see me
I can't stand when you leave me
I can't stand like a lost boy
I can't stand anymore

My life misses I'm lost without hope
My loss chases and opens the door
I couldn't see with clarity
I couldn't see the sky
I couldn't hear the sweetness
I couldn't even try

I will find you, and you'll find me
I will save you, and you'll save me
The life we've broken
The life we see
There's nothing wrong with the world
There's something wrong with me

Save me from this person I've become
Save me from the the things are going wrong
Save me from the one that follows here
Save me from the world you learn to fear
Save me from the hope I left behind
Save me from the dreams I lost in mind
Save me from the love I wanted now
Save me for the love you wanted now
Save me from the things that wait below
Save me from the things I shouldn't know
Save me from what's hiding in the sun
Save me from this person I've become
