		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can't you see the stars are falling?
Plummeting into eternal darkness
Don't you feel the global distress?
Helpless against the cosmic unrest

Luna preaches galactic paradigm
No escape from her space or her time
Sol crumbles, caught in the stellar masses
All cycles end, falling before the casus

Can't you see the stars are falling?
Can't you see the stars are falling?

Can't you see the stars are falling?
Plummeting into eternal darkness
Don't you feel the global distress?
Helpless against the cosmic unrest

Luna preaches galactic paradigm
No escape from her space or her time
Sol crumbles, caught in the stellar masses
All cycles end, falling before the casus

Can't you see the stars are falling?
Can't you see the stars are falling?
