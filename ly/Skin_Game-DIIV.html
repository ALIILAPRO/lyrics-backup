		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One afterthought on a skin game
I took it as prescribed
Vow do no harm, buy the cure
But first you'll buy the disease

I can see you've had some struggles lately
Hey man, I've had mine too

Fighting to get through the door
But I can't live like this anymore
They gave us wings to fly
But then they took away the sky

Well, what you want?
"Serve me"
Sell me to the spoon
I'm cashing in, falling out
Tear me down, hang me up
Strung out to please the king
In metropolitan's sackler wing
I can help you
It's how I help myself

I can see you've had some struggles lately
Hey man, I've had mine too

Fighting to get through the door
But I can't live like this anymore
They gave us wings to fly
But then they took away the sky

I wanna be your doll
But I won't be your dog anymore
You gave us wings to fly
But then you took away the sky

Sunken ceiling and a sideways grin
We live to use and we use to live
Crack a window
Get some life in you

Holding in coughs, hiding my head
Everybody respects the dead
I can help you
It's how I help myself

Sunken ceiling and a sideways grin
We live to use and we use to live
Crack a window
Get some life in me
