		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fakes names uncovered before the dawn
It is you, the skies are open
We grow (we grow up)
And be the grown-ups
We deny, we deny to bring it on

'Cause we don't say no
Wherever we go (go)
Whenever we doubt
We're steady apart
'Cause we don't say no
Whenever we start
Whenever we fall
We're steady apart

Wild stare at the dust bowls
Time is a gift praying for the fog to lift
Full joy for my trussed soul
I get high
Say bye bye

Lately (lately) 
I fell through the mirror
We deny, we deny to push it on
At times (at times) 
I swim 'til I shiver
We deny, we deny to push it on

'Cause we don't say no
Wherever we go
Whenever we doubt
We're steady apart
'Cause we don't say no
Whenever we start
Whenever we fall
We're steady apart

Wild stare at the dust bowls
Time is a gift praying for the fog to lift
Full joy for my trussed soul
I get high
Say bye bye

Oh! 
'Cause we don't say no
Wherever we go
Whenever we doubt
We're steady apart
'Cause we don't say no
Whenever we start
Whenever we fall
We're steady apart

Wild stare at the dust bowls
Time is a gift praying for the fog to lift
Full joy for my trussed soul, yeah

Wild stare at the dust bowls
Time is a gift praying for the fog to lift
Full joy for my trussed soul
I get high
Say bye bye, say bye bye

Wild stare at the dust bowls
Full joy for my trussed soul

'Cause we don't say no
Wherever we go
Whenever we doubt
We're steady apart
'Cause we don't say no
Wherever we go
Whenever we doubt
We're steady apart
