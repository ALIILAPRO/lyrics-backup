		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My world has turned upside down
You almost invade my heart
I'm jealous of your talent,
glamour... and so on
Unclear sky spread above us
Then there's not a ray of hope
I've gone astray somewhere
While my sight's been shut out
And if I never met you
I don't have to face to myself
I'd never supposed to
feel like this, ooh oh
Is that a yearning or fear?
Don't force your excessive
thoughts on me
Don't pretend as LOVE
Turn back the...
Time cannot delete our crimes
Crime will take
somebody's smiles
We only wanna be safe and sound
Lots of plastic plans
go round and round
Now's the time to act,
what are you waiting for?
Now we've had enough,
won't contend no more
I don't wanna think at all
So don't let me avenge
back again
My world has turned upside down
Since I had worked
with your heart
Whole things that
are pleasing you
hurt you on and on
Foul mire spread below us
Thrills my body just like dope
I've straightened
across the border
Someone's warned me, yet
And if I never met you
I don't have to face to myself
I'd never supposed to
feel like this, ooh oh
Is that a yearning or fear?
Don't force your excessive
thoughts on me
Don't pretend as LOVE
Turn back the...
Time cannot delete our crimes
Crime will take
somebody's smiles
We only wanna be safe and sound
Lots of plastic plans
go round and round
Now's the time to act,
what are you waiting for?
Now we've had enough,
won't contend no more
I don't wanna think at all
So don't let me avenge
back again
Ti-time... Time won't rewind back
C-crime...
Crime, can't get rid of
Li-live...
Still we gotta be alive
Ooh ooh oh oh
Ti-time... Time won't rewind back
C-crime...
Crime, can't get rid of
Li-live...
Still we gotta be alive
Ooh ooh oh oh

Turn back the...
Time cannot delete our crimes
Crime will take
somebody's smiles
We only wanna be safe and sound
Lots of plastic plans
go round and round
Now's the time to act,
what are you waiting for?
Now we've had enough,
won't contend no more
I don't wanna think at all
So don't let me avenge
back again
Ti-time... Time won't rewind back
C-crime...
Crime, can't get rid of
Li-live...
Still we gotta be alive
Ooh ooh oh oh
Ti-time... Time won't rewind back
C-crime...
Crime, can't get rid of
Li-live...
Still we gotta be alive
Ooh ooh oh oh
