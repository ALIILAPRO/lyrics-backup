		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You want my blood
You want that high
You wanna kill what gives you life
So feast on me, I hope you choke
On parts of me I know you love to hate the most
(I hope you choke)

You can bite into me
You can sink in your teeth
Suck the life out of me
Vampire
You can drive in the stake
But I won't bend, I won't break
No, I won't be your prey
Vampire, vampire, vampire
I am the light that'll burn you like fire
Vampire, you won't suck the life out of me

You wanna tear my heart apart
You want your hand to leave a scar
You wanna feed on me until I'm drained
No, you won't sleep 'til you put me in my grave

You can bite into me
You can sink in your teeth
Suck the life out of me
Vampire
You can drive in the stake
But I won't bend, I won't break
No, I won't be your prey
Vampire, vampire, vampire
I am the light that'll burn you like fire
Vampire, you won't suck the life out of me

(Vampire)
I know you want to watch me bleed
You won't suck the life out of me

You can bite into me
You can sink in your teeth
Suck the life out of me
Vampire
You can drive in the stake
But I won't bend, I won't break
No, I won't be your prey
Vampire, vampire, vampire
I am the light that'll burn you like fire
Vampire, you won't suck the life out of me

(Vampire)
