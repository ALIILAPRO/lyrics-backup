		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Marlboros and moonshine
Hell-bent on moonlight
Everything you hate 'bout this town
I was just a loose end
No plans, beat down broke man
Caught in a landslide going down

I was a reckless child
A dead end mile
Living my life on the run
I was a long lost soul
A twisted road
An ol' ramblin' heart with a gun
Never thought I'd hang it up
'Til I found your love

You changed the stars in my night sky
My path from the wayside
Everything I lost, yeah, you found
You took the pain from my soul
The chains off my bones
And made me the man I am now

I was a reckless child
A dead end mile
Living my life on the run
I was a long lost soul
A twisted road
An ol' ramblin' heart with a gun
Never thought I'd hang it up
'Til I found your love

I was just a desperado
A lead foot full throttle
Shot in the dark without hope

I was just a reckless child
A dead end mile
Living my life on the run
A long lost soul
A twisted road
An ol' ramblin' heart with a gun
Never thought I'd hang it up
Never thought I'd hang it up
'Til I found your love
'Til I found your love

Marlboros and moonshine
Hell-bent on moonlight
'Til I found your love
