		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Look in my eyes, they lie
Went to hell a couple of times
Can't say I don't try, I tried
Now there's nowhere left to hide
Now it's done, I'm undone
Everything that I've become
Let me show you my darkness
It's dark, yeah

I'm the joker, I'm the devil
I'm a demon, I'm a rebel
I've gone mad
Don't try to understand

I'm the joker, I'm the devil
I'm a demon, I'm a rebel
I've gone mad
Don't try to understand

Now I fight with dirty hands
Now I fight with dirty hands

I know the rules, It's true
They weren't built for me to use
Trouble made me, it breaks me
Easy to lie than tell the truth
I'm your nightmare, don't stare
Promise you're not prepared
I'm so heartless, no heart, yeah

I'm the joker, I'm the devil
I'm a demon, I'm a rebel
I've gone mad
Don't try to understand

I'm the joker, I'm the devil
I'm a demon, I'm a rebel
I've gone mad
Don't try to understand

Now I fight with dirty hands
Now I fight with dirty hands
(Don't try to understand)

You can follow me down
Don't be scared what you may find
Some say I'm different now
I think I've lost my mind
There is evil inside
Shadows haunt me at night
I try to win but lose the fight
Don't turn out the light

I'm the joker, I'm the devil
I'm a demon, I'm a rebel
I've gone mad
Don't try to understand

I'm the joker, I'm the devil
I'm a demon, I'm a rebel
I've gone mad
Don't try to understand

Now I fight with dirty hands
