		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I called your number about a hundred times
And I know, that you know that it's me
I sat and listened for hours and hours
When the world got you down on your knees

All that I wanna do is to hold you tight
Love you until you're back on your feet
But it's hard when I'm laying my heart in your hands
And you don't hand yours back to me

Just give me something
I don't need to know but you're giving nothing
I'll take anything at all
Just give me something
'Cause all that I need is you
And you're giving nothing
Just give me something

I left you flowers outside your door
I see them dyin and it's killing me
Feel like a man on a walking wire
'Cause every change you get you're pushing me

You can break every bone, I'm still standing here
Wait until you can finally see
You know all that we had, it was magic
Now tragically I'm begging you please

Just give me something
I don't need to know but you're giving nothing
I'll take anything at all
Just give me something
'Cause all that I need is you
And you're giving nothing
Just give me something
Just give me something
Oh, just give me something
Oh, just give me something

I don't know how many nights
I can sit here waiting for you to come home

Just give me something
I don't need to know but you're giving nothing
I'll take anything at all
Just give me something
'Cause all that I need is you
And you're giving nothing
Just give me something
And I don't need to know but you're giving nothing
I'll take anything at all
Just give me something
'Cause all that I need is you
And you're giving nothing
Just give me something

Just give me something
Oh, just give me something
Oh, just give me something
