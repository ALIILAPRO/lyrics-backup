		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Love will lead you there
Love will lead you there

So many times I've gone wrong
But your love, it stayed consistently strong
Never doubted our faith can be holding on
Blessings I don't talk about, it's between me and God
Don't you ever stop looking for your higher self, stay up
Baby, the more that you believe, the more that you will see the strength in us

Love will lead you there
Love will lead you there
Love will lead you there
Love will lead you there

A treasure, our love is
I'll always show up for you
Just tell me and I'll be there

Love will lead you there
Love will lead you there
Love will lead you there
Love will lead you there
