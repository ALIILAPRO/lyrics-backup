		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Five letters aren't enough to tell you what I've got my mind on
Or am I taking too long
Lather up, burn in the sun
Go wash the soap off of your tongue
Do it right or you'll be a no one
Could you wish this or will you show up just to quit?
I think it's better to forget it

Take me out
Put me down
I just wanted your do-do, do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do doubt
I just wanted your do-do, do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do doubt

Take me in and size me up
I know you're not always a judge
Am I not enough or too much
Can you fix this?
I think I'm ready to commit
Come watch me swing it and miss it

Take me out
Put me down
I just wanted your do-do, do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do doubt
I just wanted your do-do, do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do doubt
Take me out
Put me down
I just wanted your
Do-do, do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do doubt (I just wanted your doubt)
I just wanted your
Do-do, do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do doubt (I just wanted your doubt)
I just wanted your
Do-do, do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do doubt (I just wanted your doubt)
I just wanted your
Do-do, do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do doubt (I just wanted your doubt)
