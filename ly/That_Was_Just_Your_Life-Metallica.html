		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Like a siren in my head that always threatens to repeat
Like a blind man that is strapped into the speeding driver's seat
Like a face that learned to speak, when all it knew was how to bite
Like a misery that keeps me focused thought I've gone astray
Like an endless nightmare that I must awaken from each day
Like conviction, a premonition
Not worthy of, so I deny, I deny

I blind my eyes and try to force it all into place
I stitch them up, see not my fall from grace
I blind my eyes, I hide and feel it passing me by
I open just in time to say goodbye

Almost like your life
Almost like your endless fight
Curse the day is long
Realize you don't belong
Disconnect somehow
Never stop the bleeding now
Almost like your fight
And there it went
Almost like your life

Like a wound that keeps on bleeding to remind me not to think
Like a raging river, drowning when I only need a drink
Like a poison that I swallow, but I want the world to die
Like a release from a prison that I didn't know I was in
Like a fight to live the past I prayed to leave from way back then
Like a general without a mission until the war would start again, start again

I blind my eyes and try to force it all into place
I stitch them up, see not my fall from grace
I blind my eyes, I hide and feel it passing me by
I open just in time to say goodbye

Almost like your life
Almost like your endless fight
Curse the day is long
Realize you don't belong
Disconnect somehow
Never stop the bleeding now
Almost like your fight
And there it went
Almost like your life

Like a touch from hell to feel how hot that it can get if you get caught
Like a strike from heaven that turns that key
That brings you straight down to your knees
Like a touch from hell to feel how hot that it can get if you get caught
Like a strike from heaven to reprieve
That brings you straight down to your knees

Almost like your life
Almost like your endless fight
Curse the day is long
Realize you don't belong
Disconnect somehow
Never stop the bleeding now
Almost like your fight
And there it went
Almost like your life
That was just your life
