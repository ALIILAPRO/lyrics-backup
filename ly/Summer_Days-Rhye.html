		  Summer days far away
Can I just make you stay?

Come on, give in to me
Oh, come on, I give in to you
My baby, come on where we should be
Mm, I worship you
High, we're high
Your eyes harbor the sun
You feel the ways wanna come

Summer days far away
Can I just make you stay?
Summer days far away
Can I just make you stay?

You becoming part of me
Your body cold, softly
Come on, play with me
Your heart is filthy
Only the winter

Summer days far away
(You becoming part of me)
Can I just make you stay?
(Your body cold)
Summer days far away
Can I just make you stay?

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Summer days far away
(You becoming part of me)
Can I just make you stay?
(Your body cold)
Summer days far away
(Come on baby)
Can I just make you stay?
(You're high)
Summer days far away
(Your body cold)
Can I just make you stay?
Summer days far away
(Your body cold)
Can I just make you stay?
