		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Donnie Katana)

Ridin' in a 'Vette with eleventh letter in the alphabet
Catch a L try to follow this 'Vette
I ain't worried 'bout a set, type of nigga that'll kill the whole set
Fire, fire, send shots at his neck

Bought my bitch a Perc' just to hold my stick
I'ma rob the whole city if I can't get rich
I'm a money makin' nigga, ain't goin' like Mitch
Yeah, I love my dawgs, I don't do 'em like Vick
Got Nina on my side, yeah, I tuck her like Chris
And these bullets talkin' lips, they'll give a nigga kiss
If a nigga play with us, see a whole lotta flicks (a whole lotta flicks)
If a nigga play with us, take a hole out a pit, look

Dead man, dead man, yeah, that's he
He play with the gang, now he asleep
Dead man, dead man, yeah, that's he
He play with the gang, now he deceased
Wickman, Wickman, yeah, that's me
He call the shots and rap on beats
Wickman, Wickman, yeah, that's me
He a lil' wicked nigga as you can see

Shittin' on niggas, need a whole lotta sauce
Dick-ridin' niggas, there's a whole lotta y'all
If you play with me, you got a whole lotta balls
She been suckin' for an hour, got a whole lotta jaw
Ho wet like a shower, she couldn't even wear drawers
And her legs kept shakin', she couldn't even stand tall
Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm
Ridin' in a 'Vette with eleventh letter in the alphabet
Catch a L try to follow this 'Vette
I ain't worried 'bout a set, type of nigga that'll kill the whole set
Fire, fire, send shots at his neck
When these bullets take off, they gon' off the whole set
Chop' sang like Quavo, don't get scared
We move like Migos, country bands
He cap like Kangol, move that head

Wickman, Wickman, Wickman
Wickman, Wickman, Wickman, yeah, that's me
Wickman, Wickman, Wickman
Wickman, Wickman, Wickman, yeah, that's me
Lil' wicked nigga as you could see
And he put a bitch in double Cs
He ain't no Crip, but he double C'ing
This foreign fabric come from oversea
