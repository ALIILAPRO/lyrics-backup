		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I have never felt such frustration 
Or lack of self control 
I want you to kill me 
And dig me under
I want to live no more 

One who doesn't care
is one who shouldn't be 
I've tried to hide myself from what is wrong for me 
For me 

I want to taste dirty
a stinging pistol 
In my mouth, on my tongue 
I want you to scrape me from the walls 
And go crazy
like you've made me 

One who doesn't care
is one who shouldn't be 
I've tried to hide myself from what is wrong for me 

One who doesn't care
is one who shouldn't be 
I've tried to hide myself from what is wrong for me, for me

You, you are so special 
You have the talent
to make me feel like dirt 
And you, you use your talent
to dig me under 
And cover me with dirt

One who doesn't care
is one who shouldn't be 
I've tried to hide myself from what is wrong for me 

One who doesn't care
is one who shouldn't be 
I've tried to hide myself from what is wrong for me
