		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There once was this demon
Who dreamt of leaving, someday from hell
Then one day, he just slipped away
Ripped and torn wings, were the cost
Amazed at trees and pretty dark things
He was happy, but lost
Happy, but lost

The clang of bells and a twisted voice yells
Somewhere, from below
Come home now and slaughter the sow
Because, you can't stay here
If you run, well you're nobody's son
And they will bury you here
You don't want to die here

He walked toward the sun, defiant to the one
With scorched and cracked skin
He ripped out his heart! What a melancholy start
To the cleansing of sin
That little demon, never went out screaming
Leaving his magic behind
His beautiful darkness, remains entombed

Until the spider web chimes
