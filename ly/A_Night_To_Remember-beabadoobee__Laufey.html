		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Swore I'd seen you before
Watched you walk through the door
Somethin' in your eye
Reminded me of somebody I used to know

You touched my back
I took your hand
Somethin' from your touch felt shockingly familiar
And I swore I'd seen you before

Oh, I swore I'd seen you before

Underneath the sheets
You enchanted me
And whispered sweet nothings in my ear
I shivered beneath you
All wrapped up in embers
It was a night to remember

Then I walked away
You asked me to stay
Know you're thinkin' of what could've been
But you've become someone I've seen before

I swore I'd seen you before

Underneath the sheets
You enchanted me
And whispered sweet nothings in my ear
I shivered beneath you
All wrapped up in embers
It was a night, enchanting night
To remember
