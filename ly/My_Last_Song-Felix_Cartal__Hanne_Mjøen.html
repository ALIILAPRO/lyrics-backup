		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You say I don't give a damn
Coming home at 4 AM
As if we don't mean a thing to me
I'm all out of energy
Always humming melodies
What's with all the jealousy?
Just breathe

You ask if I'm honest
Saying we have problems
Atypical classic starving artist
Saying I'm broken
Hiding my emotions
Maybe I'm just differently outspoken
And every day

You say I don't feel at all 
Just listen to my last song
I've felt things I can't recall
But they're all, but they're all 
In my last, in my last song

Feel the pulse
If you wanna keep me close
Try to keep up with my notes tonight
In the need of therapy
High on different melodies
Now I think it's time that we rewrite

You ask if I'm honest
Saying we have problems
Atypical classic starving artist
Saying I'm broken
Hiding my emotions
Maybe I'm just differently outspoken
And every day

You say I don't feel at all (at all)
Just listen to my last song (last song)
I've felt things I can't recall (can't recall)
But they're all, but they're all 
In my last, in my last song

You say I don't feel at all 
Just listen to my last song
I've felt things I can't recall
But they're all, but they're all 
In my last, in my last song
(Fuck me up)

(Fell on me)
(I'm alright)
(Fell on me)
(In my last song)
(Fell on me)
(You make up)
(Fell on me)
(In my last song)

You say I don't feel at all 
You say I don't feel at all 
You say I don't feel at all 
Just listen to my last song
