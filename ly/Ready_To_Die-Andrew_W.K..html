		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is your time to pay
This is your judgment day
We made a sacrifice
And now we get to take your life

We shoot without a gun
We'll take on anyone
It's really nothing new
It's just a thing we like to do

You better get ready to die
You better get ready to kill
You better get ready to run
'Cause here we come
You better get ready to die

Your life is over now
Your life is running out
When your time is at an end
Then it's time to kill again
We cut without a knife
We live in black and white
Your just a parasite
Now close your eyes and say good-night

You better get ready to die
You better get ready to kill
You better get ready to run
'Cause here we come
You better get ready to die
Get ready to die
You better get ready to die, get ready to die
