		  Girl, I just want make we rock
Girl, I just want make we vibe
Girl, I just
Girl, I just want make we chill like ice water 
Mi o mo bonshen gbe body o
Fit spend you my paper
After tonight I go like to dey see you later
Personal vendetta against me
'Cause of you I get many haters

Omoge o whine for your guy
Baby wetin you dey find for your life
Ma lo fe broke nigga, fight for your life
Roll with me make I blow your aza like
Marilyn Monroe you too set
Every man want to open bonnet
No fit give but you want to collect
Better guy scarce like a cassette o

Mamalet don't you forget (huh? Mh-mh)
Me I be cocky but now I dey pesh (I know)
I don dey fall, baby ti get
Bakasi causing domino effect (you like it?)
You no need introduce yourself (mh?)
Michael Jackson Thriller, you are bad (eh?)
If I see you for dark I fit tell (are you sure?)
The way your body take dey bend o (ah)

Girl, I just want make we rock
Girl, I just want make we vibe
Girl, I just (girl, I just)
Girl, I just want make we chill like ice water
Mi o mo bonshen gbe body o
Fit spend you my paper
After tonight I go like to dey see you later
Personal vendetta against me
'Cause of you I get many haters

Oya grab something, hold something
Like it's your birthday, go shorty
Ma worry, nobody fit to take your place 
Baby, shake something
Them no fit wear agbada for mosquito
Beef them get for me pass one kilo
Got my eyes on the price oh my baby o
Wan dey take your panpana do pillow

Mamalet don't you forget (huh? Mh-mh)
Me I be cocky but now I dey pesh (I know)
I don dey fall, baby ti get
Bakasi causing domino effect (you like it?)
You no need introduce yourself (mh?)
Michael Jackson Thriller, you are bad (eh?)
If I see you for dark I fit tell (are you sure?)
The way your body take dey bend o (ah)

Girl, I just want make we rock
Girl, I just want make we vibe
Girl, I just (girl, I just)
Girl, I just want make we chill like ice water
Mi o mo bonshen gbe body o
Fit spend you my paper
After tonight I go like to dey see you later
Personal vendetta against me
'Cause of you I get many haters

Girl, I just want make we rock, rock, rock
Mi o mo bonshen gbe body o
Girl, I just want make we vibe, vibe, vibe
Mi o mo bonshen gbe body o
