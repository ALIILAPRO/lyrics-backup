		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My heart black and blue, fucked around and i gave it to you(oh why)
I can't even explain what I've been through, Every day I wish I never met you
Fucked around and I gave you my trust(oh why)
Couldn't tell if it's love or it's lust
All of my sins, I swear they counting
My head in the water, I'm drowning
I'm drowning, drowning in my sins
Bitch, I'm drowning, I hope I can grow some wings
Bitch, I'm drowning, drowning in my sins
Bitch, I'm drowning, I hope I can grow some wings (uh)

yeah feel like A Boogie, I'm drowning
All of my sins building high as a mountain
I thought I found love, but I fucked up the timing
Just give me a problem, you know I'm gon' climb it

Still get up every time that I fall
She gon' play with my heart like a doll
Blowing her phone, she ignoring my calls
Of course i would trip bitch, I gave you my all
Couple thousand on the drip(huh)
Big body benz thats the whip(huh)
I cannot cuff on no bitch(huh) But you know I'll give her this d*** (uh)

What's it gon' take for the pain to go away?
You know I'd do anything to put a smile on your face
(yeah) You told me forever?, didn't know forever meant a couple of months
I don't think i can feel better
Why would you tell me I'm the only one?

This is not how we supposed to end
Please tell me this was all pretend
All of the time that we spent together I wish I could repeat the days again
But you on some different shit You'd rather fuck on a different dick, huh
I'm on some different shit Like, fuck it, I'll fuck on a different bitch, huh

Still got a knife in my back, My gold heart turned to black
All of the time that I spent on you, Wish I could get that back

My heart black and blue, fucked around and i gave it to you(oh why)
I can't even explain what I've been through, Every day I wish I never met you
Fucked around and I gave you my trust(oh why)
Couldn't tell if it's love or it's lust
All of my sins, I swear they counting
My head in the water, I'm drowning
I'm drowning, drowning in my sins
Bitch, I'm drowning, I hope I can grow some wings
Bitch, I'm drowning, drowning in my sins
Bitch, I'm drowning, I hope I can grow some wings (uh)
