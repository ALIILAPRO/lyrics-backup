		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I never needed you like I do right now
I never needed you like I do right now
I never hated you like I do right now
'Cause all you ever do is make me

Gave you up 'bout twenty-one times
Felt those lips tell me twenty-one lies (yeah)
You'll be the death of me
Sage advice
Love, lovin' you could make Jesus cry

When I hear you sayin', "Darlin'", your kiss is like an antidote
I'm fightin' like I'm Ali
But you got me on the ropes

I never needed you like I do right now
I never needed you like I do right now
I never hated you like I do right now
'Cause all you ever do is make me

Couldn't hear the thunder, but I heard your heart race
Couldn't see the rain, we're too busy makin' hurricanes (yeah)
Love ain't easy when it ain't my way
But it gets hard, when you ain't here makin' me crazy

Baby, say the word, "darlin'"
You know just how to hold the sucker down
So I'll see you in the morning
I can't watch you walk out

I never needed you like I do right now
I never needed you like I do right now
I never hated you like I do right now
'Cause all you ever do is make me

Cry, cry, cry

Hear the thunder, see the rain

Ooh, yeah, ooh
Keep on makin' me cry
Ooh, yeah, ooh
Hey, yeah, yeah (ooh)
Keep makin' me scream and holler (ooh)
Keep on makin' me cry (ooh)
You don't know what you do to me (ooh)
Hey, yeah, yeah (ooh)

I never needed you like I do right now
I never needed you like I do right now
I never hated you like I do right now
'Cause all you ever do is make me
