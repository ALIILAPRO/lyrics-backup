		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ay oh, let's go

(Oh oh oh!)
Turn up the beat, yeah
(Oh oh oh!)
I wanna feel it
(California)
Don't you wish that you could come?
'Cause we're never going home
Till the summer's all gone

Summer time, living's easy
Cruising, bumping my Huntington Beach
'Cause the sun will shine
We'll have a good time
They all line up for a bump and grind

And the girl that you want is directly out in front
And she's waving her caboose at you
You sneeze achoo
She calls you out and boom!

I know you heard that bass bumpin' in my trunk
Bum-bumpin' in my trunk,
Bum-bumpin' in my trunk
(Oh yeah)
I know you heard that bass bumpin' in my trunk
(Uh huh)
Bum-bumpin' in my trunk
(Uh huh),
Bum-bumpin' in my trunk
(Let's go)

(Go go go!)
Turn up the beat, yeah
(Oh oh oh!)
I wanna feel it
(California)
Don't you wish that you could come
'Cause we're never going home
Till the summer's all gone

The sun goes down, the fire pit's leap
It's another summer night here in the O-C
Well I know a baller but I do have an Impala
And I might say 'hey' but I'll never say 'holla'

The girl with the glass
And a g-string just like a floss
Well she's waving her caboose at you
I bet you do
She calls you out
(Uh huh)

I know you heard that bass bumpin' in my trunk
Bum-bumpin' in my trunk,
Bum-bumpin' in my trunk
(Bump that truck)
I know you heard that bass bumpin' in my trunk
(Uh huh)
Bum-bumpin' in my trunk
(Uh huh),
Bum-bumpin' in my trunk
(Let's go)

(Go go go!)
Turn up the beat, yeah
(Oh oh oh!)
I wanna feel it
(California)
Don't you wish that you could come
With the radio on
Blazing all summer long

(Go go go!)
You're all I'm breakin'
(Oh oh oh!)
My friends are drinkin'
(California)
Don't you wish that you could come
'Cause we're never going home
Till the summer's all gone

(California)
(California)

I know you heard that bass bumpin' in my trunk
Bum-bumpin' in my trunk,
Bum-bumpin' in my trunk
(Ay oh let's go)

(Go go go!)
Turn up the beat, yeah
(Oh oh oh!)
I wanna feel it
(California)
Don't you wish that you could come
With the radio on,
Blazing all summer long

(Go go go!)
You're all I'm breakin'
(Oh oh oh!)
My friends are drinkin'
(California)
Don't you wish that you could come?
'Cause we're never going home
Till the summer's all gone

(California)
Don't you wish that you could come?
'Cause we're never going home
Till the summer's all gone
