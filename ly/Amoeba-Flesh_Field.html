		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I destroyed you to protect you from all the things I never want to be. 
I ruined you so I could ruin me. 
No guilt, no sympathy for me. 

Self destruction never seemed so beautiful. 
Anaesthesia only hides what won't die. 

I never climbed so high. 
But I only had further to fall. 
I never asked myself why.
I never gave it any thought at all. 

I need to separate, to divide,
Before I take you down with me. 
Perhaps I'm too sick to pray, or not sick enough to. 
It's too late for me. 

There's nothing I can do to save you from me. 
Forget everything you are and forgive me.
