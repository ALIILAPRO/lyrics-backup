		  Hopeful 
Hopeful
Hopeful
Hopeful
Hopeful
Hopeful
Hopeful
Hopeful

Now in this present darkness
All ears just listen, a mass has formed to cure the common condition
Though black as a cloud in a war-ridden sky
The lights will shine through 'til this bullshit blows by
And the best of me, I won't settle for less
I'm convinced and once I'm convinced then I'll manifest
A catalog of parables that's broke down in a tongue
That's been corrupted, no substance to be hidden from
Now it's erupted, brought forth from a dream
A stream underwater without an option to sing
Not to pacify you but, homie, to truly change
When you stare at the heavens you'll see the stars have rearranged so be

Hopeful 
Hopeful (mm-hmm)
Hopeful (yeah)
Hopeful (we gots to be)
Hopeful (no, you can't see)
Hopeful (uh-huh)
Hopeful (yeah)
Hopeful 

We're in the middle of a monotonous storm
Made from messed up music, motivated, I mourn melodic melody that moves and mediates
Evolution of change to pulsate the mind state
It's not impossible for our mission to succeed
You ask, "Are we chosen?" I'll say, "Indeed"
We've studied and trained for a warrior mind frame
The counsel has gathered thicker than soap is lathered
Don't fret 'cause it ain't over yet but by the time it is your cries will turn into cheers
No fears, just hold on tight
Because the darkness will be over by the end of the fight
With doubt and fear, jealousy
All the things that cause casualty
To your soul, let it go
Most of all be hopeful

Hopeful 
Hopeful 
Hopeful 
Hopeful (let's just be)
Hopeful (when you can't see)
Hopeful (just remain)
Hopeful (yeah)
Hopeful

Hopeful 
Hopeful
Hopeful
Hopeful
Hopeful
Hopeful
Hopeful
Hopeful
