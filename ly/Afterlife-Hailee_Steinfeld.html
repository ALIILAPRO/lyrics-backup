		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Red eyes, like the smoke we rise
As the candle's burning low
Trust me in whatever you like
Are you playing with me?

Every time your name, it leaves my lips
Running still like words left unsaid
Fire in my veins dream deeply love
Remind me I'm alive

Will you love me when my heartbeat stops?
When my heartbeat stops, will you stay mine? (mine)
Will you promise me you'll search for us?
Will you find me afterlife? (life)
Oh, for better or for worse
Will death be our last kiss, my love? (love)
Will you promise me you'll search for us?
Will you find me afterlife? (life)

My ear is buzzing
Oh, I'm trapped, no one's coming
Immortality is bliss
You put me down, then put me on a pedestal
Now that I'm gone you're gonna miss me

Every time your name, it leaves my lips
Running still like words left unsaid
Fire in my veins dream deeply love
Remind me I'm alive

Will you love me when my heartbeat stops?
When my heartbeat stops, will you stay mine? (mine)
Will you promise me you'll search for us?
Will you find me afterlife? (life)
Oh, for better or for worse
Will death be our last kiss, my love? (love)
Will you promise me you'll search for us?
Will you find me afterlife? (life)

Candle's burning
Will you find? Will you find me afterlife?
Oh, afterlife, the afterlife
Will you love (will you love) in the afterlife?
Will you love (will you love), will you love me?
Will you love (will you love) in the afterlife?
Will you love (will you love), will you love me?

Will you love me when my heartbeat stops?
When my heartbeat stops, will you stay mine?
Will you promise me you'll search for us?
Will you find me afterlife? (life)
Oh, for better or for worse
Will death be our last kiss, my love? Oh-oh
When my heartbeat stops, will you stay mine?

Afterlife
