		<p>
		  Welcome to the house of pain, Just Blaze niggaz 

[Intro: Mary J. Blige] 
Theres no we, it seems I can't get free 
Sombody tell me what's happenin to me 

[Notorious B.I.G.] 
The country bud got me chokin 
I'm on a mission to the point motherfuckers think I'm smokin 
Yea that sick nigga Biggie wit the H-shot fifth 
Wit the extra clip for that extra shit 
Don't you know that killin is thrillin 
All the blood spillin, is all up on the drug dealin 
A broad gangsta my daddy was a thug 
Had a .38 wit the hallow point slug 
So when he lit shots 
Niggaz dropped quicker than bootlegger sells his liquor 
A little nigga tried to squeeze .22's in my Reebok shoes 
Payin dudes, while kids was on their one's and two's 
Now I'm much older, colder, fuck a holster 
Got the Mac .11's swingin from my shoulder 
It's a damn shame I got to put my mom through the strain 
I'm livin in a house of pain 

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige] 
Is anybody listenin and tell me can you can see this God be surroundin me 
Now it's gettin colder heavy on my shoulder and it's gettin hard to breathe 
And it's gettin blury, I'm gettin worried cause it's gettin hard to see 
When your lampin in the house of paaaiiinnn 

[2Pac] 
When the motherfucker dust kicker, who can you trust? 
Who gave you the heart to see a nigga? 
Before you bust, my name is spoken on the tongue so many foes 
Bustin motherfuckers out the blocks and I ain't even go 
Now how the hell do you explain my claim to fame 
From doin fix to bustin tricks out the fuckin frame 
Got these bitches on my jock niggaz on my block 
Jealous ass suckers got it duckin for my fuckin glock 
And bustin niggaz ass is to stay alive 
Skinny ass playa watchin victim motherfuckers fry 
They ask me how I'm livin? how I'm a hustler? 
Buckin busters â€˜til they die 
Now it's on in the ghetto you ain't heard? 
Niggaz got they AK's headin for the bird 
Aimin at free ass bitches let 'em rain 
Givin 'em, wettin 'em, welcome to the house of pain 

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige] 

[Nas] 
MJB, be worried niggaz, yea, Nas... 

Wendy Williams say I stayed dust maybe I should 
cuz these rappers'll have your phone tap like Savion Glover 
And on the West the police corrupt, some are bloods 
But these Teflon I loaded explodin some mugs 
I'm like Furious in "Boyz In the Hood" 
But at the drive through I'm ain't runnin I'm dumpin 
Crazy like a paru and load up, know how Nas do 
I'm callin Henchmen to save shit, to organize a black truth 
And we party hard party wit Nas 
Since they ain't no more - Mardi Gras 
And Bush won't apologize 
I got gangsta hoes Kobe Bryant scared to sodomize 
And .45's for them suckers y'all idolize 
Ya'll yellin my name but y'all soon die in 
Tryin to portray real but they be ly-in 
Cuz they want the real niggaz to die so they can game 
But neva that, this ain't neva lastin this is the house of pain 

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
