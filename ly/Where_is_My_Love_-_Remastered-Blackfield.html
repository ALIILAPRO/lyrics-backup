		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Endless fields of emptiness in my dark and wounded heart 
Where is my love? 

The freezing moment when you turned your head and waved goodbye 
Where is my love? 

Even all the biggest storms can't take my pain away 
Where is my love? 
Noisy happy people crossing streets from side to side 
Where is my love? 

I gave you everything I could but you want the stars 
Where is my love? 
Endless fields of emptiness in my dark and wounded heart 
Where is my love? 

Even all the biggest storms can't take my pain away 
Where is my love? 
Noisy happy people crossing streets from side to side 
Where is my love?
