		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Honey, honey, how he thrills me, aha, honey, honey
Honey, honey, nearly kills me, aha, honey, honey
I'd heard about you before
I wanted to know some more
And now I know what they mean, he's a love machine
Oh, you make me dizzy

Honey, honey, let me feel it, aha, honey, honey
Honey, honey, don't conceal it, aha, honey, honey
The way that you kiss goodnight (the way that you kiss me goodnight)
The way that you hold me tight (the way that you holding me tight)
I feel like I wanna sing when you do your thing

Honey, honey, touch me, baby, aha, honey, honey
Honey, honey, hold me, baby, aha, honey, honey
You look like a movie star (you look like a movie star)
But I love just who you are (but I love just who you are)
And honey, to say the least, you're a doggone beast

Honey, honey, how you thrill me, aha, honey, honey
Honey, honey, nearly kill me, aha, honey, honey
I heard about you before
I wanted to know some more
Now I'm about to see what you mean to me
