		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I had a vision of you, and just like that
I was left to live without it, left to live without it
I found a version of love, and just like that
I was left to live without it, left to live without it

Waiting for this storm to pass
Waiting on this side of the glass
But I see my reflection in you
See your reflection in me
How could it be?
How could it be?

There is something between us
Between me and you
There is something between us
I see right through
I see right through

I had a version of home, and just like that
I was left to live without it, left to live without it
I had a person I loved, and just like that
I was left to live without it, left to live without it

Waiting for this storm to pass
Waiting on this side of the glass
But I see my reflection in you
See your reflection in me
How can it be?
How can it be?

There is something between us
Between me and you
There is something between us
I see right through
I see right through

There is something between us
Between me and you
There is something between us
I see right through
I see right through

I had a vision of you, and just like that
I was left to live without it, left to live without it
Waiting on this side of the glass
