		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hide away, hide away, I wanna hide away
Stay in the shadows and remain in the cold
Places we'll get to in our lowest of moments
Feels like there's no way out of the frozen, so
Run away, run away, we always run away
Nobody wants to see who they really are
We wanna cover the mirrors and paint over the scars
God knows who we are

Life leads us out of the dark

Let there be light
And we'll set this world on fire (fire, fire)
Let there be light
And we'll set this world on fire (fire, fire)

Come away, come away, you're overthinking it
You gotta stop over complicating the little things
Tangled in wires and they're tripping you up, stuck in a rut
Everything you gave is never enough
But if we change the way we look at life
The life we look at changes
Every single pair of hearts started out as strangers

Life leads us out of the dark

Let there be light
And we'll set this world on fire (fire, fire)
Let there be light
And we'll set this world on fire (fire, fire)

Whoa
Whoa
Whoa
God knows who we are
Whoa
Whoa
Whoa
God knows who we are

Life leads us out of the dark
Life leads us out of the dark

Let there be light
And we'll set this world on fire (fire, fire)
Let there be light
And we'll set this world on fire (fire, fire)

Whoa
Whoa
Whoa
And we'll set this world on fire
Whoa
Whoa
Whoa
And we'll set this world on fire
