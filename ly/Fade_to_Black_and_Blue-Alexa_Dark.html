		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We sit at that bar
Jukebox doesn't start
So I play a sad song in my head
I know you're leaving soon
No curtain call for you
But I watch the credits roll again

It ain't fun for us
'Till it's dangerous
'Till it turns to dust
Too much we can't undo
It ain't fun for us
'Till it kills one of us or two
'Till the ceiling cracks
We fade to black and blue

My feet on your dashboard
Only love you when I'm bored
My heart is sore so it's yours again
Summer leaves the frame
I mourn my youth in vain
Afraid I'll wake to find nothing left

It ain't fun for us
'Till it's dangerous
'Till it turns to dust
Too much we can't undo
It ain't fun for us
'Till it kills one of us or two
'Till the ceiling cracks
We fade to black and blue

It ain't fun for us
'Till it's dangerous
'Till it turns to dust
Too much we can't undo
It ain't fun for us
'Till it kills one of us or two
'Till the ceiling cracks
We fade to black and blue
