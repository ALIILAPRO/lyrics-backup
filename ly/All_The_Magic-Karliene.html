		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Is there light
Beyond the storm?
I've heard of stars
Beyond the grey skies

I couldn't see
Beyond my own face
The day the mirror
Became a blade

And all that anger
And all that pain
Sparked the power
Of who I became

I paid in blood
So I'd be beautiful
I found my power
In chaos
But all that magic
Is illusional
It's not enough
It's not enough

I gave it all
So I'd be powerful
I learnt to master
My chaos
But all the magic
In the whole, wide world
Is not enough
It's not enough

It can't return
The part I lost

All I wanted
Was a bit of love
To be wanted
By someone

But my world is cruel
It's unrelenting
If you're not cruel too
You won't survive it

All that rejection
And all that pain
Sparked the power
Of who I became

I paid in blood
So I'd be beautiful
I found my power In chaos
But all that magic Is illusional  
It's not enough
It's not enough  

I gave it all  
So I'd be powerful
I learnt to master
My chaos
But all the magic
In the whole, wide world
Is not enough
It's not enough  

It can't return  
The part I lost
