		  Bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum 
Bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum (yeah)
Bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum 
Bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum 

Last Christmas
I gave you my heart (gave you my heart)
But the very next day you gave it away (gave it away)
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (special)

Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance
But you still catch my eye
Tell me, baby
Do you recognize me? (oh)
Well, it's been a year
It doesn't surprise me (Christmas)
I wrapped it up and sent it (last Christmas)
With a note saying, "I love you" 
I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now
I know you'd fool me again

Last Christmas
I gave you my heart (I gave you my heart)
But the very next day you gave it away (gave it away)
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (I'll give it someone special, special)

Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears (save me from tears)
I'll give it to someone special, special (I'll give it someone special)

Bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum
Bum bum bum bum bum, bum bum bum bum bum

A crowded room
Friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you
And your soul of ice
My God, I thought you were
Someone to rely on (someone to rely on)
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on

A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A man undercover but you tore me apart (ooh, ooh)
Now I've found a real love you'll never fool me again

Last Christmas
I gave you my heart (gave you my heart)
But the very next day (very next day)
You gave it away (gave it away)
This year
To save me from tears (save me from tears)
I'll give it to someone special, special (oh, oh, oh)

Last Christmas
I gave you my heart (I gave you my heart)
But the very next day you gave it away (you gave me away) 
This year
To save me from tears (save me from tears)
I'll give it to someone special (I'll give it to someone (special)

Bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum (gave you my heart)
Bum bum bum bum bum, bum bum bum bum bum
