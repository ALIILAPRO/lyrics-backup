		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This grief boils down how angels fall
We can't forget what wasn't lost
Where pleasures breach the skin within
cnd ages bury me oh so deep
 
This fracture blossoms in a concrete hell 
I'm just a seizure waiting to rebel
The time we spent on bended knees
Were just a reminder of the pain we missed

I can't control myself
I want to feel you
I can't forgive myself
I want to heal you
 
Will you forget the past?
I can't redeem you
I can't control myself
I want to feel you

I can't control myself
I want to feel you
I can't forgive myself
I want to heal you
 
Will you forget the past?
I can't redeem you
I can't control myself
I want to feel you

The blood has spilled on a mattress, floor
Where all our regrets have begun to fall
The shame we feel now turns to wine
While we wait for the signal that we will survive
 
There's no more hope to be bought and sold
When all our misfortunes have been shown to all
One second more looking at the void
Will make you remember if its worth at all

I can't control myself
I want to feel you
I can't forgive myself
I want to heal you
 
Will you forget the past?
I can't redeem you
I can't control myself
I want to feel you

I can't control myself
I want to feel you
I can't forgive myself
I want to heal you
 
Will you forget the past?
I can't redeem you
I can't control myself
I want to feel you
