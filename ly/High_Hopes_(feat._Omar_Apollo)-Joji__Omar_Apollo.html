		  High hopes
High hopes
High hopes
High hopes

A little messed up, do you feel it?
A little bit of this and a little bit of that
She wanna know which way I'm leanin' 
Am I really made of this, am I really made of that?
And is it so bad if you need me?
Just a little bit, whoa, don't get rid of me
Ayy, but love is so blind when you feel it (so blind)
Can't defeat it, hope you feelin'-

High hopes
High hopes
High hopes
High hopes

I'ma talk like I don't really mean it, ayy
Bless me, St. John's, I'ma act like I don't really need it
But you see these funds, ayy, they gon' cheer me up, ayy
Brand new whip, sound like Cheerios, ayy, yeah, ayy
Wake me up, Rey Mysterio, ayy, yeah, ayy
Wipe my eyes, can't see clearly, though
I been on the block, boy move soft like some cereal, ayy, yeah

High hopes with you, man, I wanna see you again
High hopes with you, man, I wanna see you again
Yeah, yeah
I don't think you good at keepin' secrets
All the bags on the floor make you heated
Blind my eyes, boy too bright, got them sequins
And I hope you comin' back to cop that free shit
Let her cop that free shit
That's elite shit

High hopes
High hopes
