		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've come up hard baby, but now I'm cool
I didn't make it sugar, playin' by the rules
I've come up hard baby, but now I'm fine
I'm checkin' trouble sugar, movin' down the line
I've come up hard baby, but that's okay
'Cause Trouble Man, don't get in my way
I've come up hard baby, I've been for real, baby
Gonna keep movin', gonna go to town
I've come up hard, I come up gettin' down
There's only three things that's for sure
Taxes, death and trouble, oh
This I know, baby, this I know, sugar
Girl, ain't gon' let it sweat me, babe

Got me singin', yeah, yeah
Woo
Come up hard, baby, I had to fight
Took care my business with all my might
I've come off har- come-off-hard, I had to win
Then start all over and win again
I've come up hard but that's okay
'Cause Trouble Man don't get in my way, hey, hey

I know some places and I've seen some faces
I got good connections, they take my directions
What people say, that's okay, they don't bother me, no
I'm ready to make it, don't care what the weather
Don't care 'bout no trouble, got myself together
I feel the kind of protection that's all around me

I've come up hard, baby, I've been for real, baby
With the trouble mind, I'm movin', goin' to town
I come up hard, I come up gettin' down
There's only three things for sure
Taxes, death and trouble, oh
This I know, baby, ooh, this I've known, baby
Ain't gon' let it sweat me, baby 
Woo

Oh Lord, baby 

Ooh, I've come up hard, but now I'm cool
I didn't make it, baby, playin' by the rules
Come up hard, baby, now I'm fine
Checkin' trouble, sugar, hey, movin' down the line, oh
