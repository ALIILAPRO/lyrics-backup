		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Riot on the radio
Pictures on the TV
Invader man take what he can
Shootout on the silver screen
Sticking 'em up and knocking 'em down
Living out a fantasy
There's a bad man cruising around
In a big black limousine
Don't let it be wrong
Don't let it be right
Get in his way
You're dead in his sights

Big gun
Big gun number one
Big gun
Big gun kick the hell out of you

Terminators, Uzi makers
Shootin' up Hollywood
Snakes alive with a .45
Setting off and doing no good
If you ain't wise they'll cannibalize
Tear flesh off you
Classified lady killers
Prayin' in the human zoo (Prayin')
They saddle you up
And take you to town
Better look out
When he come around

Big gun
Big gun number one
Big gun
Big gun kick the hell out of you

Big gun, got a hot one
Big gun, got a number one
Big gun, loaded and cocked
Big gun, hot hot hot
Got big gun, ready or not
Big gun, give it, give it a shot

Terminator, Uzi makers
Regulators, gonna get you later

Big gun kick the hell out of you
