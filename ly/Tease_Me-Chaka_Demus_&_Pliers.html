		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, hey, oh darling, mm

She's floating like a butterfly, so charming
(Baby girl)
She recognize the man in me
(Number one inna di world)
There's something in her eyes
Like a spell getting me hypnotised, ooh Lord
She give me one smile, two smile, three smile
She got me going wild (worth more than damonds and pearl)
So baby don't change your style (sweet honey)
Oh no, no love

Tease me, tease me, tease me, tease me baby
Till I lose control
Tease me with your love until I lose control
Take all my body and me soul, oh girl

Mm, woman your love 
Is like burning fire inna me soul
Woman tease me till me lose control
Woman your love 
Is like burning fire inna me soul
Woman tease me till me lose control
Me gal tease me and take a look me fancy
Right from the clock until me reach climax
And when me reach me will tell you fi stop
Will ya hear fi de sky and we not turn back, brrrrup

Suddenly you think of all the love that I was searching for
Holding confidence that will never, never fail
Hearing angel voices singing love prevail
Ooh darling, ooh ay, come closer to me
And don't bail out when me sing I'll come

Tease me, tease me, tease me, tease me baby
Till I lose control
Tease me with your love until I lose control
Take all my body and me soul, oh girl

Tease me, tease me, tease me, tease me baby
Till I lose control
Tease me with your love until I lose control
Take all my body and me soul, oh girl

Hear me now
I will never forget the first time we kissed
It's like striking goal, catching a big fish
Yes, you are on top of my romance list
Second to none you defeat the favourite

Woman your love 
Is like burning fire inna me soul
Woman tease me till me lose control
Woman your love 
Is like burning fire inna me soul
Woman tease me till me lose control

And even if my mind should resist, oh yeah

Tease me, tease me, tease me, tease me baby
Till I lose control
Tease me with your love until I lose control
Take all my body and me soul, oh girl

Tease me, tease me, tease me, tease me baby
Till I lose control
Tease me with your love until I lose control
