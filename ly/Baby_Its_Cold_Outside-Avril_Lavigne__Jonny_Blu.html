		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I really can't stay (baby, it's cold outside)
I've got to go away (but baby, it's cold outside)
This evenin' has been (been hopin' that you'd drop in)
So very nice (I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice)
My mother will start to worry (beautiful, what's your hurry?)
My father will be pacin' the floor (listen to the fireplace roar)
So really I'd better scurry (beautiful, please don't hurry)
But maybe just a half a drink more (put some records on while I pour)
The neighbors might think (baby, it's bad out there)
Say, what's in that drink? (ain't no cabs to be had out there)
I wish I knew how (your eyes are like starlight now)
To break the spell (I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell)
I ought to say, no, no, no sir (mind if I move in closer?)
At least I'm gonna say that I tried (what's the sense in hurtin' my pride?)
I really can't stay (oh baby, don't hold out)
But baby, it's cold outside

I simply must go (but baby, it's cold outside)
The answer is no (oh but baby, it's cold outside)
Your welcome has been (I'm so lucky that you dropped in)
So very warm (look out the window at that storm)
My sister will be suspicious (gosh your lips look delicious)
My brother will be there at the door (waves upon a tropical shore)
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious (ooh, your lips are delicious)
But maybe just a cigarette more (never such a blizzard before)
I've gotta get home (but baby, you'll freeze out there)
Say lend me a coat (it's up to your knees out there)
You've really been grand (I thrill when you touch my hand)
But don't you see? (How can you do this thing to me?)
There's bound to be talk tomorrow (think of my lifelong sorrow)
At least there will be plenty implied (if you got pnuemonia and died)
I really can't stay (get over that old out)
But baby, it's cold
Baby, it's cold outside
