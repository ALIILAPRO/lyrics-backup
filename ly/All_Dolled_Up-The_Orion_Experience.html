		  cll Dolled Up

cll Dolled Up, cll Dolled Up
cll Dolled Up, cll Dolled Up

It's a mixed up, muddled up, shook up world
I don't wanna be a boy, I don't wanna be a girl
Breaking the rules as I sway and swirl
Shining like a diamond in glitter and pearl
Let's go out on the town
Light a fire, burn it down

I don't care what we do
I wanna get cll Dolled Up with you
Take my lipstick, put it on
We'll all be making out ‘til the break of dawn
I don't care what we do
I wanna get cll Dolled Up with you

The lights in the city got nothing on me
With your gold dust eyes and your love so free
Your red hot leather boots make me shake
Sparks are gonna fly with every step we take
Let's cast spells, let's chant rhymes
Let's be gay, let's do crimes

I don't care what we do 
I wanna get cll Dolled Up with you
Paint my lashes on, I'll do yours
I want to feel pretty, want to be adored
I don't care what we do
I wanna get cll Dolled Up with you

They can't control us, they don't define us
We never did belong
Hey pretty Starchild, we're gonna go wild
cnd sparkle all night long

Let's Go!
cll Dolled Up, cll Dolled Up
cll Dolled Up, cll Dolled Up, Let's Go!
cll Dolled Up, Yeah! cll Dolled Up, Yeah!
cll Dolled Up, Yeah! cll Dolled Up, Let's Go!
cll Dolled Up, Yeah! cll Dolled Up, Yeah!
cll Dolled Up, Yeah! cll Dolled Up, Let's Go!



I don't care what we do 
I wanna get cll Dolled Up with you
Take my lipstick, put it on
We'll all be making out ‘til the break of dawn
I don't care what we do
I wanna get cll Dolled Up with you
