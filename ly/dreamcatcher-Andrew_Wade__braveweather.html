		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'd have better luck trying to catch your shadow
I woke to you gone
You took the redeye for Chicago
And I found out in the worst way
You let your friends tell me
You let your friends tell me
And that was the start of my worst days
You got the best of me and I hate it
You got me fucked up
I thought it was love
I'm lost in the rush I felt with you
You got me fucked up
I'm all out of touch
I'm lost in the rush of your bedroom
You got me fucked up
It's not the first time
You've got the worst way of letting go
It's not worth a fight
You're putting me through again
A game that I'll never win
Cause you've got a way
Of making yourself the center of every situation
You've got a way
Of making it all so complicated
You got me fucked up
I thought it was love
I'm lost in the rush I felt with you
You got me fucked up
I'm all out of touch
I'm lost in the rush of your bedroom
Oh the rise and fall I still feel your head on my chest
Oh and I'm still caught in the dreamcatcher over your bed
You got me fucked up
I hope this is a temporary fix
I don't think I could come to grips with this
Cause you got me
Cause you got me
You got me fucked up
I thought it was love
I'm lost in the rush I felt with you
You got me fucked up
I'm all out of touch
I'm lost in the rush of your bedroom
Oh the rise and fall I still feel your head on my chest
Oh and I'm still caught in the dreamcatcher over your bed
You got me fucked up
