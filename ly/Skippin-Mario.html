		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  As soon as you came in, I offered you a drink
Better yet, there's a bar in my crib shawty
What you think?
You know I'm a stranger, so girl let me take you
To places that you don't even know
Oh, I wanted girls before but, never like this
And I know I can't have it all but, I'll settle for a kiss
I'm playin' unless you let me, 'cause damn you're so sexy
And it feels like I'm losin' control

Now I'm not fallin' in love with you
But I think that you're a hot shawty (hot shawty)
See all I wanna do, is let you know

From the moment I saw you, I knew that
You were all that I wanted in a woman
From your style to your walk, to your fragrance
Baby girl you got my heart ska-ska-skippin'
Just like, boom boom, ska-ska-skippin'
Ba ba boom, ba ba boom, ba ba boom, boom, ska-ska-skippin'
Ba ba boom, boom boom, boom boom, boom ska-ska-skippin', boom boom
Baby girl you got my heart ska-ska-ska skippin', just like

Got me in amazement and I can't believe
I never seen nothin' like you, ever step on the scene
Maybe you're just born with it, maybe it's Maybelline
But there's no way for me to surely know
Ain't tryna be forward but girl I wanna take you home
So for now, movin' forward girl, you know what I want
I wanna get you in closer, I love to hear when you whisper
All the things that you wanna hear

Now I'm not fallin' in love with you (you see)
I think that you're bad shawty (ha ha)
See all I wanna do, is let you know

From the moment I saw you, I knew that (hey)
You were all that I wanted in a woman (from your style to your walk)
From your style to your walk, to your fragrance
Babygirl you got my heart ska-ska-skippin'
Just like, boom boom, ska-ska-skippin'
Ba ba boom, ba ba boom, ba ba boom, boom, ska-ska-skippin' (oh baby)
Ba ba boom, boom boom, boom boom, boom ska-ska-skippin', boom boom
Baby girl you got my heart ska-ska-ska skippin', just like

Boom boom, damn baby
Just like, boom boom
You dunno what you do to me
Just like, boom boom
It feels kinda crazy but
(Just like, boom boom) Girl you got my heart ska-ska-skippin'

From the moment I saw you, I knew that (you were all that I wanted baby)
You were all that I wanted in a woman (from your style to your walk)
From your style to your walk, to your fragrance
Baby girl you got my heart ska-ska-skippin'

From the moment I saw you, I knew that (I knew that)
You were all that I wanted in a woman (you were all that I wanted in a woman baby)
From your style to your walk, to your fragrance
Baby girl you got my heart ska-ska-skippin'
Just like, boom boom, ska-ska-skippin' (aw yeah)
Ba ba boom, ba ba boom, ba ba boom, boom, ska-ska-skippin'
Ba ba boom, boom boom, boom boom ska-ska-skippin', boom boom
Baby girl you got my heart ska-ska-ska skippin', just like
