		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you

Do you know where you're going to?
Do you like the things that life is showing you?
Where are you going to? (straight)
Do you know?

With my best friend
7-11 (yeah)
We go legend, we go legend (yeah, yeah)
We go legend, we go legend (alright)
We go legend, we go legend, yeah
With my best friend
7-11 (yeah)
We go legend (go), we go legend (go), yeah (yeah)
We go legend (go), we go legend (go legend)
We go legend, we go legend, yeah (straight)

With my best friend (alright)
7-11 (whoa)
We go legend (yeah)
We go legend
Codeine legend (yeah, yeah)
Microphone legend
We go legend, yeah

In my house
Yeah, alarms
Ringin' through my house (through my house)
Got 'em goin'
Climbing in 'n' out (in 'n' out)
But you know it, never run your mouth (never run your mouth)

Look
Bitch this not a drill, this the real thing (whoa)
I do what the fuck I feel, fuck your feelings, yeah
Made my blueprints, so my life got no ceilings (I don't see 'em)
I create the energy that they keep stealing, yeah
Detroit legend (whoa)
Microphone legend, yeah
Sean a Legend
My bro is John Legend, yeah (whoa, whoa)
All this sunshine, it's still raining blessings (whoa)
Skrrt out that Maybach, I'm just fresher than my reverend, yeah (skrrt skrrt skrrt)
Oh my God, oh my God, you cockblocked
Bitch I sock you out yo' socks (bitch)
Me and all my inner circle, we keep thinkin' out the box
Dawg, when life go too hard on you, you gon' go legend or not?
Me, I got no other opp (got no other option)
Shit, I go so hard I might wake up with a concussion (I go hard)
The way I piece this shit together, man, it's puzzlin' (I go hard)
I do this for the dogs and nowadays we husky
God is my witness, you lil' bitches, you can't judge me

With my best friend (oh God)
7-11 (no no)
We go legend, we go legend (yeah, yeah)
We go legend, we go legend (alright)
We go legend, we go legend, yeah
With my best friend
7-11, yeah
We go legend (go), we go legend (go), yeah (yeah)
We go legend (go), we go legend (go legend)
We go legend (straight), we go legend, yeah
With my best friend (alright)
7-11
We go legend (yeah)
We go legend
Codeine legend (yeah, yeah)
Microphone legend (whoa)
We go legend, yeah

I go legend, I mean, Michael Jackson (hol' up)
Prince in action, okay, I'm an original, you just a reenactment
Okay, peace sign and flashes
I live that picture perfect life you lie 'bout in your captions
(Mmm-mmm-mmm)
When I was down, I swear they made me feel inferior (straight up)
Judgin' me by my outside, that's just my exterior (straight up)
Not seeing what I was made of, that's my interior (real shit)
Didn't let that shit break me, instead, I broke the barriers
So fuck all y'all, praise Allah
It's my perog' like Bobby bruh
Massages by Nautia
In my castle like Mario
I get in shit, my heart and soul
You boys got no cardio
All of my soldiers rock army clothes
'Head of my time like Marty though
Watchin the Rick and Morty show, while I smoke
All these bands, still fuck her on the floor
Came from the dirt, all I had to do was grow
Remember when my shit got repossessed (damn)
That shit had us workin' like we possessed (goddamn)

With my best friend (boy)
7-11 (boy)
We go legend, we go legend (yeah, yeah)
We go legend, we go legend (alright)
We go legend, we go legend (yeah, yeah)
With my best friend (whoa)
7-11, yeah
We go legend (go), we go legend (go), yeah (yeah)
We go legend (go), we go legend (go legend)
We go legend, we go legend, yeah (straight up)

With my best friend (alright)
7-11 (whoa)
We go legend (yeah)
We go legend
Codeine legend (yeah, yeah)
Microphone legend
We go legend, yeah
