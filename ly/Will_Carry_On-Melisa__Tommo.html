		  Will carry on
Will carry on
Will carry on
Will carry on, carry on, carry on

How are you?
You've changed so much, you're not the same anymore
No, no, no
When I look in your eyes, I can see that you're lost
You have lost your charm for eternity

No, no, no, don't you cry
No, no, no, no, no, no, don't you cry
You can't turn back time, back time

Will carry on
Will carry on
Will carry on
Will carry on, carry on, carry on

Will carry on
Will carry on
Will carry on
Will carry on, carry on, carry on

How are you?
It's been a long time since we saw each other
I saw you last time
Saw your face, saw your face, saw your smile
It's been a while since I fell in love
You and my

No, no, no, don't you cry
No, no, no, no, no, no, don't you cry
You can't turn back time, back time

Will carry on
Will carry on
Will carry on
Will carry on, carry on, carry on

Will carry on
Will carry on
Will carry on
Will carry on, carry on, carry on

Baby, please don't cry
Baby, please don't cry
Baby, please don't cry

Will carry on
Will carry on
Will carry on
Will carry on, carry on, carry on

Will carry on
Will carry on
Will carry on
Will carry on, carry on, carry on
