		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Doomed from the start
We met with a goodbye kiss, I broke my wrist
It all kicked off, I had no choice
You said that you didn't mind 'cause love's hard to find
Maybe the days we had are gone, living in silence for too long
Open your eyes and what do you see?
No more laughs, no more photographs

Turning slowly, looking back, see
No words, can save this, you're broken and I'm pissed
Run along like I'm supposed to, be the man I ought to
Rock and Roll, sent us insane, I hope someday that we will meet again
Running wild
Giving it everyone, now that's all done
Cause we burnt out, that's what you do
When you have everything, it can't be true
Maybe the days we had are gone, living in silence for too long
Open you're eyes and what do you see?
The last stand, let go of my hand

Turning slowly, looking back, see
No words, can save this, you're broken and I'm pissed
Run along like I'm supposed to, be the man I ought to
Rock and Roll, sent us insane, I hope someday that we will meet again
You go your way and I'll go my way
No words can save us, this lifestyle made us
Run along like I'm supposed to, be the man I ought to
Rock and roll, sent us insane, I hope someday that we will meet again
