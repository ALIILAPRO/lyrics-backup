		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You’ve got my devotion
I’m falling in slow motion
The way you got me feeling
is stupid, yeah I know

I don’t wanna rush it
No one here gonna judge this
Riding in the fast lane
Don’t care where we go

Pick me up
And you know I’m mine
Take a round ’til I’m feeling tired 
Now I’m caught in your headlights
Getting closer to midnight

Doing 80, we don’t slow down
Feeling like we made it
We made it now
Now we’re running out of red lights

Pumping through my veins now
Keeping me insane now
The way you’ve got me feeling
is crazy, yeah I know

Pick me up
And you know I’m mine
Take a round ’til I’m feeling tired 
Now I’m caught in your headlights
Getting closer to midnight

Doing 80, we don’t slow down
Feeling like we made it
We made it now
Now we’re running out of red lights

Pick me up
And you know I’m mine
Take a round ’til I’m feeling tired 
Now I’m caught in your headlights
Getting closer to midnight

Doing 80, we don’t slow down
Feeling like we made it
We made it now
Now we’re running out of red lights

Pick me up
And you know I’m mine
Take a round ’til I’m feeling tired 
Now I’m caught in your headlights
Now I’m caught in your headlights
Now I’m caught in your headlights
Now I’m caught in your headlights

Pick me up
And you know I’m mine
Take a round ’til I’m feeling tired 
Now I’m caught in your headlights
Getting closer to midnight

Doing 80, we don’t slow down
Feeling like we made it
We made it now
Now we’re running out of red lights

Pick me up
And you know I’m mine
Take a round ’til I’m feeling tired 
Now I’m caught in your headlights
Now I’m caught in your headlights
