		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got this doom and gloom in my mind, yeah
I got this doom and gloom but I feel all right

I've got love in my heart
So let's sneak in from the cheap seats honey
And we'll drive until the engine just gives up

Feeling so good right now
Feeling so good right now
'Til we crash and burn somehow
Feeling so good right now, yeah

I know, I know I've made mistakes, yeah
I know, I know but at least they were mine to make
They were mine to make

In all of my wildest dreams
They just end up with you and me
So let's drive until the engine just gives out

Feeling so good right now
Feeling so good right now
'Til we crash and burn somehow
Feeling so good right now, yeah

We're drifting from the start, I ripped myself apart
I'll be whatever you need me to be, you need me to be
I cut myself down, cut myself down
To whatever you need me to be, you need me to be

Drifting from the start, I ripped myself apart
I'll be whatever you need me to be, you need me to be
I cut myself down, cut myself down
To whatever you need me

Oh, and in all of my wildest dreams
They just ended with you and me
So let's drive until the engine just gives out

Feeling so good right now
Feeling so good right now
'Til we crash and burn somehow
Feeling so good right now

Feeling so good right now
Feeling so good right now
'Til we crash and burn somehow
Feeling so good (so good) right now (so good, so good)

I know, I know I've made mistakes, yeah
I know, I know but at least they were mine to make, yeah
