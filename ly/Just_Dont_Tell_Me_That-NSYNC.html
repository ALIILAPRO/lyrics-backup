		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh oh, no no, all right
You got to be seen at every party
At the playboy mansion
But, sad
I know I gotta draw the line
You want to be in
The flashes of light
Holding me tight
With your phony laugh
I guess
You gotta be photographed

You can say it's real
But I know where it's at

Just don't tell me that
You are gonna love me
I don't want to hear it baby
Tell me that
It's gonna be your last lie
No baby I won't go for that
Even if you did say
You were gonna be there
I don't want you back
'Cause it's not about love
Just don't tell me that

You like to drive in my car
Spend every dollar of my credit
Baby, guess what
Saw me with your golden eye
Guess you want to be
Part of the ride
Live for the night
But I've seen it through
Had enough of being close to you

You can say it's real
But I know where it's at

Just don't tell me that
You are gonna love me
I don't want to hear it baby
Tell me that
It's gonna be your last lie
No baby I won't go for that
Even if you did say
You were gonna be there
I don't want you back
'Cause it's not about love
Just don't tell me that

No no, it's not about love
No no

You want to be in
The flashes of light
Holding me tight
Girl it's all up to you
But whatever you do
I don't want to hear it

You're not gonna love me
I won't go for that
It just won't last
Even if you did say
You were gonna be there
I don't want you back
'Cause it's not about love
Just don't tell me that

You are gonna love me
I don't want to hear it baby
Tell me that
It's gonna be your last lie
No baby I won't go for that
Even if you did say
You were gonna be there
I don't want you back
'Cause it's not about love
Just don't tell me that
