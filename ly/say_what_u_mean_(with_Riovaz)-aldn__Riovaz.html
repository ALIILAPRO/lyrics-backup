		  Ha
Ha-ah
Ha

Say what you really mean when you talk to me
I know you wanna see me dead, oh
I know you wanna see me dead
(I want you dead)
So tell me what is that you want from me
'Cause you've been getting to my head, oh
Yeah, you been getting to my head

Like I can't go outside
Without feeling like someone's behind me
And I'm so paranoid
Can't you hurry up and fucking kill me?
Like I can't even hide
Without feeling like they're gonna find me
And I'm so paranoid
Can't you hurry up and fucking kill me?

Say what you wanna say, girl, I won't mind
And I know I'm wasting your time
And I know I'm wasting your trust
(Do, do you trust me?)
And I'm not complicated, you just don't care
Feel like I'm tied to a dream
You got me down on my knees
For the one who hates me

And I don't fall in love like she does
And I don't fall in love like she does
'Cause I don't, 'cause I don't
Say what you wanna say I've lost my mind
'Cause say what you
Say what you mean

So tell me what it is that you want from me
'Cause you've been getting to my head, oh
Yeah, you been getting to my head

Like I can't go outside
Without feeling like someone's behind me
And I'm so paranoid
Can't you hurry up and fucking kill me?
Like I can't even hide
Without feeling like they're gonna find me
And I'm so paranoid
Can't you hurry up and fucking kill me?
