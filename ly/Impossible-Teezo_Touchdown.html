		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Maybe they were gonna be a painter until somebody said they couldn't paint
Maybe thought they was the next Jean-Michel 
'Til somebody yelled, "No, you ain't"
Maybe they wanted to go to art school 
But their parents said, "Sorry, we can't"
Maybe it was a mix of all three of those colors 
That left the canvas blank (oh, damn)

Who said it would be impossible?
Who said it would be?

Maybe they wanted to be a boxer until they found out that they couldn't fight
Maybe would've been the next Ali 
If they woulda blocked that right (one, two, three, four, five)
Maybe the referee counted way too fast that night
Maybe it was a combination of all three that knocked out the fighter's lights
Lord, down goes- (six)

Who said it would be impossible?
Who said it would be impossible?
Who said it would be impossible?
Who said it would be?

(Maybe)
Maybe you wanted to be a DJ (just maybe)
Maybe you didn't have gear (maybe)
Maybe you wanted to be an artist (maybe)
But everybody always called you weird (maybe)
Maybe you wanted to be a rockstar (maybe)
But somebody told you, you was too old (maybe)
Maybe it was all these things (maybe)
Why your record never sold
Who wants to hear a sad song?
They never seem to top the charts
Who's to say what's impossible?
The only way is if you never start

Who said it's impossible? (Who said?)
Who said it's impossible? (I said, "Who said?")
Who said it's impossible?
Who said it's impossible? (Give me a name)
Who said it's impossible? (An address)
Who said it's impossible? (I want them now)
Who said it's impossible?
Who said it's impossible?
