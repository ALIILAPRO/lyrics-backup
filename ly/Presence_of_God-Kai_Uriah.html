		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They say I'm trippin I'm trippin I'm trippin
Cuz I go for God and not just for the millions
Now I'm just whipping I'm whipping I'm whipping
My Word around cuz you know He said it's finished
I never listened I listen but listen
The presence of God is not found in a building
Don't need a million a trillion a billion
Just so I could go out and live out my mission
I got a vision a vision a vision
It smell good just like a new pack of cologne
I was reading Philippians and no European
But Paul wrote that back in in Rome
I need a P31 not a PS5 who remember her verse off the dome
You know Jesus really died so I'm alive
So I'm never gone feel all alone
Everyone wishing and wishing and wishing
We pray for the people and pray for the children
They say I cook up like I'm in the kitchen
Or maybe I did it or maybe I'm trippin
Strapped up with the Word
Balling so hard like I'm just Larry Bird
Kicking my problems straight up to the curb
Only way up yeah we coming in first
Hold up
You know we rock like the sheep
Blessed are the ones who are meek
You know we cutting in deep
Praying for those who are feeling so weak
I got the Word stuck up all on my teeth
Watchin my feet everyone wanting a feature
It's hard to stay right on the beat
When no one really got a leader
How are you under the heat
Under pressure got me feeling so weak
You got the faith just got to go and believe
I'm flying so high just like my name is Peter
Na Na
Ha Ha
I wish I wish I
I wish I was praying for people and praying for those who I'm truly gone miss I
Don't wanna be prideful I wish I was humble I promise I'm truly gone wish I
Got a Bible so I'm not gone miss I
You know that I'm changing I wish I
See they say I'm trippin I'm trippin
She not with God then I'm dipping I'm dipping
I need a shawty who got some ambition
She don't feed her flesh I ain't talking nutrition
So independent she don't really need me
Living water I ain't talking bout Fiji
We not taking L's I ain't talking Luigi
Guarding my field like I play like a DB
Lower and lower
My life was getting down getting slower
Reap what you sow then you gone be a sower
Coke a Cola in my hand and a soda
Light in the world but it keeps getting colder
Look up to Heaven I feel like I'm closer
Light in the world then they need some exposure
I love you more so I'm gonna stay sober
I told you I'm over
They say I'm trippin I'm trippin I'm trippin
Cuz I go for God and not just for the millions
Now I'm just whipping I'm whipping I'm whipping
My Word around cuz you know He said it's finished
I never listened I listen but listen
The presence of God is not found in a building
Don't need a million a trillion a billion
Just so I could go out and live out my mission
I got a vision a vision a vision
It smell good just like a new pack of cologne
I was reading Philippians and no European
But Paul wrote that back in in Rome
I need a P31 not a PS5 who remember her verse off the dome
You know Jesus really died so I'm alive
So I'm never gone feel all alone
Na Na
Ha Ha
I wish I wish I
I wish I was praying for people and praying for those who I'm truly gone miss I
Don't wanna be prideful I wish I was humble I promise I'm truly gone wish I
Got a Bible so I'm not gone miss I
You know that I'm changing I wish I
They say I'm trippin I'm trippin I'm trippin
Cuz I go for God and not just for the millions
Now I'm just whipping I'm whipping I'm whipping
My Word around cuz you know He said it's finished
I never listened I listen but listen
The presence of God is not found in a building
Don't need a million a trillion a billion
Just so I could go out and live out my mission
I got a vision a vision a vision
It smell good just like a new pack of cologne

I need a P31 not a PS5 who remember her verse off the dome
You know Jesus really died so I'm alive
So I'm never gone feel all alone
