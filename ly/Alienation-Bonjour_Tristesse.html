		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  As a stranger i wander through this lifeless city. The bodies of the living dead walk 
along these filthy streets. They limb through the garbage of bygone generations. 
The bloody blacktop swallows the sound of the collapsing. 
we all have holes in our hearts. A void that can never be filled. 
Isolation is the consent reigning our lives. 
Among paved paradise and concrete hell we all will die of despair or loneliness.

The flesh covers the bone and they put a mind in there and  sometimes a soul, 
and the women break vases against the walls and the men drink too much 
and nobody finds the one. 
but keep looking crawling in and out of beds. 
flesh covers the bone and the flesh searches for more than flesh. 

there is no chance at all: we are all trapped by a singular fate. 
nobody ever finds the one.
the city dumps fill. the junkyards fill. the madhouses fill. the graveyards fill.
nothing else fills. 

We had trust  and been betrayed. We had love  turned into hate. 
We tried to collect some stars to enlighten this perpetual night,
But a clouded sky always cloaked our attempts to find some light.

So put your fear into a bottle. chomp it, swallow the shards, breathe strife. 
Wipe the tears from your eyes. Witness alienation deprave your life.
