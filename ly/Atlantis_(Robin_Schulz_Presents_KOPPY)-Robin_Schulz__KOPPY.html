		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I been losing sleep over you
Loving me so deep like you do
I lie awake, don't mind it's late
Yeah that's my mistake, yeah
I know there's a secret to you
Laying in the deep of the blue
I caught the bait that I can't shake
I don't wanna wait

Somehow I believe in perfect
Somewhere far beneath the surface
I'll hold my breath for you
You tell me if it's true, Atlantis
Somehow I believe in perfect
Somewhere far beneath the surface
I'll hold my breath for you
You tell me if it's true, Atlantis

Atlantis
I found my way to your ocean
Riding your wave in slow motion
Atlantis
Atlantis
Atlantis
Atlantis

Show me what it's like underneath
Let me see the light in the deep
Come reel me in, let us begin
Teach me to swim
You can leave your issues with me
Giving me your secret to keep
I'm coming in under your skin
Just take me in

Somehow I believe in perfect
Somewhere far beneath the surface
I hold my breath for you
You tell me if it's true, Atlantis
Somehow I believe in perfect
Somewhere far beneath the surface
I hold my breath for you
You tell me if it's true, Atlantis

Atlantis
I found my way to your ocean
Riding your wave in slow motion
Atlantis
Atlantis
Atlantis
Atlantis
