		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I go dancing by myself
I go dancing with no one else
Solo dancing push me as I go
I go dancing it's so intense
I will dance till the bitter end
No point in asking
'Cause I always dance alone!
Hypnotized by a lot emotion
Music stop and the spell is broken
I go dancing by myself

I go dancing with no one else
Solo dancing push me as I go, go
I go dancin' it's so intense
I will dance till the bitter end
No point in asking
'Cause I always dance alone!
Don't hold back
My dance devotion
It's the path that I have chosen
Hypnotized by a lot emotion

Music stop and the spell is broken
(Broken broken broken)
You, how I move, how I move, how I move
Uuuuu uuuh don't hold back
My dance devotion
How I move, how I move, how I move
I go dancing by myself
I go dancing no one else
Solo dancing push me as I go, go

I go dancin' it's so intense
I will dance till the bitter end
No point in asking
'Cause I always dance alone!
Don't hold back
My dance devotion
It's the path that I have chosen
Hypnotized by a lot emotion
Music stop and the spell is broken!
