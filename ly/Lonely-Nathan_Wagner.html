		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hate to say it's true, but I can't get you off my mind
I'm thinking 'bout your body, how it feels when it's on mine
I know all you're gonna do is sit and waste my time
And every word you say to me is probably a lie

So look me in the eyes, tell me that you want me
Tell me pretty lies, tell me I'm the only
Even if you don't mean it, touchin' you is holy
Maybe fake love is better than feeling lonely

Better than feeling lonely
Better than feeling lonely
Better than feeling
Maybe fake love is better than feeling lonely

(Maybe fake love is better than feeling lonely)

Wish that I could be someone who does everything right
But that just seems so boring, I would rather chase the highs
I've got some stories I still need to write
And I don't care if that shit fucks up my life
So call me a psycho and maybe you're right
But I love it (love it)

So look me in the eyes, tell me that you want me
Tell me pretty lies, tell me I'm the only
Even if you don't mean it, touchin' you is holy
Maybe fake love is better than feeling lonely

Better than feeling lonely
Better than feeling lonely
Better than feeling
Maybe fake love is better than feeling lonely

I'd rather love and lose than never even get to love you
I don't care if I get hurt, I'm fine
I don't get to choose the way I feel, it's just the truth
And I don't care if I get hurt, I'm fine

So look me in the eyes, tell me that you want me
Tell me pretty lies, tell me I'm the only
Even if you don't mean it, touchin' you is holy
Maybe fake love is better than feeling lonely

Better than feeling lonely
Better than feeling lonely
Better than feeling
Maybe fake love is better than feeling lonely

(Maybe fake love is better than feeling lonely)
