		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ow

She had the word, had the way
The way of letting me know
She knew the game, called the play
Oh, she hit me low
Said, "now you go your way, I'll go mine
And that's the start"
Doctor, doctor, ain't no cure
For the pain in my heart

Gimme a bullet to bite on, something to chew
Gimme a bullet to bite on and I'll make believe
I'll make believe it's you

Don't need no drink, don't need no drug
Don't need no sympathy
Sooner or later, send me a bill
For what she's doing to me
Operator, long distance lips on the telephone
Come tomorrow, come to grips
With being all alone

Gimme a bullet to bite on, something to chew
Gimme a bullet to bite on and I'll make believe
I'll make believe it's you

A bullet to bite on
Ow, gimme a bullet to bite on
Yeah, come on now
Yeah, yeah gimme a bullet (bullet to bite on)
Oh yeah, bullet to chew
I'll make believe it's you (bullet to bite on)
Ow, I'll make believe it's you
Gimme a bullet to bite on (bullet to bite on)
Oh, you're a bullet baby
I want a bullet to bite on (bullet to bite on)
