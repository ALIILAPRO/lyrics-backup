		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tennessee, she don't mind, if I lead her on
She holds me even though she knows
In the morning I'll be gone
Tennessee, she don't know, just how good she is
There's a mystery in the way she moves
Pulls me back again

And if I wanna stay awhile
If I get a little bit high
On the night and the whiskey
Underneath the barroom lights
She can always lead me home
Like a star in the Southern sky
And if I'm lost she will take me
Into her arms tonight
Tennessee don't mind
Oh, yeah

She keeps a cross on a chain around her neck
Like a badge as she takes the last drag from her cigarette
And she knows that I ain't ever gonna settle down
But in the midnight hour, she tells herself, don't worry about it now

So if I wanna stay awhile
If I get a little bit high
On the night and the whiskey
Underneath the barroom lights
She can always lead me home
Like a star in the Southern sky
And if I'm lost she will take me
Into her arms tonight
Tennessee don't mind
Oh, yeah
Tennessee don't mind
Oh

So if you see her
Tell her that I'm on my way
Just one more city
One more song I gotta play
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

And if I'm gonna stay awhile
If I get a little bit high
On the night and the whiskey
Underneath the barroom lights
She can always lead me home
Like a star in the Southern sky
And if I'm lost she will take me
Into her arms tonight
Yeah, Tennessee don't mind
Oh, yeah

Tennessee don't mind
Tennessee don't mind
Oh, yeah
Tennessee don't mind
Tennessee don't mind
Oh-oh
Tennessee don't mind
Oh, no
Tennessee don't mind
Oh, oh-oh-oh
