		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I used to hear a simple song
That was until you came along
Now in its place is something new
I hear it when I look at you

With simple songs, I wanted more
Perfection is so quick to bore
You are my beautiful, by far
Our flaws are who we really are

I used to hear a simple song
That was until you came along
You took my broken melody
And now, I hear a symphony

Yeah, ohh-ooh

And now, I hear
A symphony
