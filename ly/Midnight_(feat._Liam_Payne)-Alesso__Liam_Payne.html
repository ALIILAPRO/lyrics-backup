		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Always thought I was losing the race
Looking for love in all the wrong places
Really don't know how we made it here

Never thought I was worth what you give
Never felt quite alive, now I'm living
Yeah, you kill my doubts, they disappear

When I feel like nothing's gonna hold me down
Hold me down, you do
Used to be scared of falling, 'til you came around
Came around

Now I just wanna stay here and fall into midnight
Want nobody else now, only you feel right
Time enjoyed wasted's not wasted time
So stay 'til the morning, stay for a while
I just wanna lay here and fall into midnight
And fall right into you

And fall right into you

Like a rock, I was set in my ways
Always thought I was too far from grace, yeah
I was numb before but now I feel

Any problem, we'll figure it out
Any love lost, we'll bring back around
Any broken heart, we'll make it heal

When I feel like nothing's gonna hold me down
Hold me down, you do
Used to be scared of falling, 'til you came around
Came around

Now I just wanna stay here and fall into midnight
Want nobody else now, only you feel right
Time enjoyed wasted's not wasted time
So stay 'til the morning, stay for a while
I just wanna lay here and fall into midnight
And fall right into you

And fall right into you
And fall right into you

Yeah, when I feel like nothing's gonna hold me down
Hold me down, you do
Used to be scared of falling, 'til you came around
Came around

Now I just wanna stay here and fall into midnight
Want nobody else now, only you feel right
Time enjoyed wasted's not wasted time
So stay 'til the morning, stay for a while
I just wanna lay here and fall into midnight
And fall right into you
