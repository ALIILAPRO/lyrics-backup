		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah
I've been falling in love with you
But you've been out of touch with me
We're still not on good terms too
'Cause every time I show up you leave
Come take my hand
And then you'll understand
Why I love you to the ends of earth
I bought your price I know your worth
Your soul is what I am longing for
Oh, I love you all the more
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah
You've been talking about your sin
And I've been watching everyday
You felt that shame well up within
Your momma's on her knees to pray
Come take my hand
And then you'll understand
Why I love you to the ends of earth
I bought your price I know your worth
Your soul is what I am longing for
You can run or hide or play those games
But child I know your name
I made you in the image of the Lord, woah
I love you all the more
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Dave and momma's answered prayer
You believed and smiled again
You forgave when it wasn't fair
And we become the best of friends
Come take my hand
And then you'll understand
Come and take my hand
Now you understand
Why I love you to the ends of earth
I bought your price I know your worth
Your soul is what I am longing for
You can run or hide or play those games
But child I know your name
I made you in the image of the Lord, woah
I love you all the more
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah
