		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Breathe in time to break out 
No stress we're wide awake now
Young blood erase our mistakes now
Buying up everything we want now 

See me dancing out in my street  
Kissing everyone that I meet 
Don't think I'm gonna give it away now 
Cause I'm blasting at the rave now 

Can't stop cause I'm going on a mission 
The word is out and everyone is in position 
I don't care if I never see the sun
Ain't got the time cause we're getting shit done
It's happening go tell your friends

It's happening 
(Everybody get to know)
It's happening
(Everybody in the flow)
It's happening  
(Just let yourself go)
It's happening right now

It's happening 
(Everybody get to know)
It's happening
(Everybody in the flow)
It's happening  
(For the rest of your life)
It's happening right now

You know the chaos is hiding 
Push beyond yeah realties slidin  
To what end should we devote our lives? 
Just be happy stop wasting time 

But don't ever say I'm not committed 
Eardrum's bleed but I'm still the fittest 
It doesn't really matter how you choose to do this 
We eat big fish and take care of business 

I'm tryin to work it from a whole new perspective 
Quality not quantity is what I am flexin 
Kill them with success I swear it's deja vu 
There's power in the people now it's over to you 
Because

It's happening 
(Everybody get to know)
It's happening
(Everybody in the flow)
It's happening  
(Just let yourself go)
It's happening right now

It's happening 
(Everybody get to know)
It's happening
(Everybody in the flow)
It's happening  
(For the rest of your life)
It's happening right now

If you feel it then you can say it 
If you sing it then I can play it 
I don't keep secrets I just hide them  
People get to know me when I hit send

What you gonna do when I appear  
You aint gonna move when you got the fear
I still wake to the sound of sirens 
Pale with sleep cause sparks are firin

Breathe in time to break out 
No stress we're wide awake now
Breathe in time to break out 
No stress we're wide awake now
Breathe out its time to break down 
No stress
