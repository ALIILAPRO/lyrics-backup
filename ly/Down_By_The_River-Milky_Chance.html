		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Down by the river, I was drawn by your grace
Into depths of oblivion and to the lovers-place
I was stuck in a puddle, full of tears and unwise
Dark doings now I know, that we've paid unlike

Honey I know, hey when we walked arm in arm
I felt like we can throw away the falseness of our past
And I know too it's been the hardest days for you
Let's throw them out the window
That's what those lovers do

Down by the river, I was drawn by your grace
Into depths of oblivion and to the lovers-place
I was stuck in a puddle, full of tears and unwise
Dark doings now I know, that we've paid unlike

Honey I know, hey when we walked arm in arm
I felt like we can throw away the falseness of our past
And I know too it's been the hardest days for you
Let's throw them out the window
That's what those lovers do

(Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh) down by river
(Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh) mmm
(Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh) down by river
(Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh) 
(Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh) down by river
(Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)

Down by the river, I was drawn by your grace
Into depths of oblivion and to the lovers-place
I was stuck in a puddle, full of tears and unwise
Dark doings now I know, that we've paid unlike

Honey I know, hey when we walked arm in arm
I felt like we can throw away the falseness of our past
And I know too it's been the hardest days for you
Let's throw them out the window
That's what those lovers do

(Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
