		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Today I'm dirty
I want to to be pretty
Tomorrow I know, I'm just dirt
Today I'm dirty
I want to to be pretty
Tomorrow I know, I'm just dirt

We are the nobodies
want to be somebodies
We're dead, we know just who we are
We are the nobodies
want to be somebodies
We're dead, we know just who we are

Yesterday I was dirty
Wanted to be pretty
I know now that I'm forever dirt
Yesterday I was dirty
Wanted to be pretty
I know now that I'm forever dirt

We are the nobodies
want to be somebodies
We're dead, we know just who we are
We are the nobodies
want to be somebodies
We're dead, we know just who we are

Some children died the other day
We feed machines and then we pray
Look up and down mortified
You should have seen the ratings that day
Some children died the other day
We feed machines and then we pray
Look up and down mortified
You should have seen the ratings that day

We are the nobodies
want to be somebodies
We're dead, we know just who we are
We are the nobodies
want to be somebodies
We're dead, we know just who we are
We are the nobodies
want to be somebodies
We're dead, we know just who we are
We are the nobodies
want to be somebodies
We're dead, we know just who we are
