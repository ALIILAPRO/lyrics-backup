		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm speed racer and I drive real fast
He's speed racer and he drives real fast
I drive real fast, I'm gonna last

I'm a big pirate and I like to steal
He's a big pirate and he likes to steal
I like to steal and I like to kill

Go, go, go speed racer
I'm a barbie doll, but I got brains
She's a barbie doll, but she's got brains
I've got brains and I like sex
Lots of brains and she likes sex

I'm your doctor and here's the bill
He's your doctor and here's the bill
Doctor steel and here's the bill
He likes to steal, so here's your bill

I'm speed racer and I drive real fast
I'm a big pirate and I like to steal
I'm a barbie doll, but I got brains
I'm your doctor and here's the bill
I drive real fast, I'm gonna last
I like to drink and I like to kill
Lots of brains and I like sex
Like to steal, here's your bill
