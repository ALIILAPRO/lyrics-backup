		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well now we're respected in society
We don't worry about the things that we used to be
We're talking heroin with the president
Well it's a problem, sir, but it can't be bent
Uh yes

Well now you're a pillar of society
You don't worry about the things that you used to be
You're a rag-trade girl, you're the queen of porn
You're the easiest lay on the White House lawn

Get out of my life, don't come back
Get out of my life, don't come back

She's so respectable
She's so respectable
She's so delectable
She's so respectable
Get out of my life
Don't take my wife
Don't come back
Get out of my life
Don't take my wife
Don't come back

What I say

She's so respectable
She's so respectable
She's so respectable
She's so respectable

Get out of my life
Don't take my wife
Don't come back
Oh get out of my life
Don't take my wife
Don't come back, alright oh

She's so respectable
She's so respectable
She's so delectable
She's so respectable
Get out of my life
Don't take my wife
Don't come back woo

Get out of life
Don't take my wife
Don't come back
Get out of my life
Don't take my wife
Don't come back, come back, hey
