		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If God called you
At 5 AM
Would you get on your knees
Or get up and leave?
If he answered your prayers
Would you share his light
Or choose to hide
Or would you stand and rise?

It's a part of life
Things will get better

Things will get better
Things will get better
Things will get better
Things will get better

'Cause God will never fail you
God will never fail you
God sees your heart
I know you're in the dark, but
It's a part of life, mm
Things will get better

Things will get better

You overthink
You're overwhelmed
Give yourself space
And time will tell
Things will get easier
Things will get better
I think you're stronger
Oh, things will get better

Oh, things will get better (things will get better)
God will never fail you (things will get better)
Oh, things will get better (things will get better)
Oh, things will get better (things will get better)

Things will get better
