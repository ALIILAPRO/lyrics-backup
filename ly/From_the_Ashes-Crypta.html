		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The time has come to depart
And from the scene remove her heart
With a cycle closure that's near
Comes self-sacrifice freed from fear

From the dust, be reborn
From the dust, gloriously ascend
From the dust, a rebirth
From the dust, fuel to emerge again

Burst into flames, now
Rise! Rise! Rise!
From the Ashes

Immortality dwells on her wings
A dying breath as she sings
The end's bitter taste pervades her deepest
Consumed by blaze, she begins a renewal quest

From the dust, be reborn
From the dust, gloriously ascend
From the dust, a rebirth
From the dust, fuel to emerge again

Rise! Rise! Rise!
From the Ashes

The end is only the beginning!
