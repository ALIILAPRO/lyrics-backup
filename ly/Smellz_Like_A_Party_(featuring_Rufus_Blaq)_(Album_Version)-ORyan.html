		  (feat. Rufus Blaq)
O-RYAN 
Oh, oh, TU- O G 
You know how we get down 

T Scott on the track 
O tell em what you're talking about 

[Verse 1:]
I, step off into the party like a real O.G 
Got a- bout 40 or 50 girls behind me 
They all- must be waiting for my pool party 
I'm just- tryin to find the one with the biggest booty (Oh..damn!) 
Bathing suits, tight bikinis 
No alcohol, 'cause i'm a little too young to drink 
Got the crib to myself, let me think 
What should i do 
Why don't ya'll tell me 

[Chorus:]
Ladies everywhere (Hey) 
All the fellas everywhere (Ho) 
Got the crib to ourself What should we do? 
Hmm 
It smellz like a party ya'll 

La, la, la, la, la, (hey) 
La, la, la, la, la, (ho) 
La, la, la, la, la, (hey) 
La, la, la, la, la (ho)
It smells like a party ya'll
 
[Marques Houston:]
Oh 
We're tryin to party with my man OG tonight 
All the ladies put your hands in the air 
Fellas, dance to the beat, come on 

[Verse 2:]
I got on- all my ice made from Jacob the Jeweller 
I'm home along feelin like Ferris Beuller 
Mami, you're fine, but your friends much cuter (Oh my God) 
It doesn't matter 'cause no one's a loser (Oh, yeah yeah) 
So fresh so clean 
Doing what i'm doing 
'cause there's this 
One chick i'm thinkin of pursuing (Damn she's bad) 
I can tell by her smile that she's thinkin the same thing 
So what should I do? 
Why don't ya'll tell me 

[Chorus:]
Ladies everywhere (Hey) 
All the fellas everywhere (Ho) 
Got the crib to ourself 
What should we do? 
Hmm 
It smellz like a party ya'll
 
La, la, la, la, la, (hey) 
La, la, la, la, la, (ho) 
La, la, la, la, la, (hey) 
La, la, la, la, la 
It smells like a party ya'll 

Ladies everywhere (Hey) 
All the fellas everywhere (Ho) 
Got the crib to ourself 
What should we do? (Yeah yeah) 
Hmm 
It smellz like a party ya'll
 
La, la, la, la, la, (hey)
La, la, la, la, la, (ho) 
La, la, la, la, la, (hey) 
La, la, la, la, la, (ho) 
It smells like a party ya'll

[Rufus Blaq Talkin]
Ay man don't give him that bottle man
Yo give me that bottle man
You too young to drink man

[Rap: (Rufus Blaq)]
Yo
Oryan ain't old enough to drink nigga
Give me that Yak Back 
And let the homie Blaq crack that
Study muh mack tack 
I'm sicker than ruby red with
A booty play, tongue spit game like muh Oozzies spread
Braka ka ka ya oh you pimpin 
Ha ha ha parties, bras, breast like a motto now
All tha ladies say 
Ma ma se ma ma ma co si 
Spanish gurls feel like I'm in a 
Bonco Papo Lowe
She loved the brand on muh chest and arm
Askin me did it hurt when I burnt them on
She a freak 
Askin me was an tha palm
'cause I was turnin her on 
With my erotic charm 
We in the house party bout to go 
Skinny Dippin
If Oyran momma come home 
His ass gon get a whippin
On punishment for tha grade period
But right now T.U.G Clique ain't hearin
Shhhhhhh
