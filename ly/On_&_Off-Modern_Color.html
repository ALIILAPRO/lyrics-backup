		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hold on, there is something wrong

In the way that you greet me, what's up?



Come on, you linger in the palm

Bare the news of your heartbreak, go on



Come on, come on

I'll be the life you lost

I'll see you when the lights turn off 



I'd throw myself into your current 

If it would make you dream of me

I can't feel what isn't you

The days go by, no rendezvous 

All I've loved is stained blue



Come on, there is nothing wrong

With the way that you bask

In the autumn sun



Give up, we all fell off

Give up, what took so long?



Of all the days I've missed you,

All the times I need you,

All the days I blew through,

All the times I've cursed you
