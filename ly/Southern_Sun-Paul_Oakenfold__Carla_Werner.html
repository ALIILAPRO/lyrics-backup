		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Piece by piece
I release
Once was mine
Now undone

Turned blue like New Orleans
And went down like
A southern sun
I still feel you

Beneath my skin
And I'm tempted
To throw my senses in
'Cause its easier to fly

Than to face another night of southern sun
And your love is all around
In the air to set me free
Set me free

You last like a song
I'm deflated
I am pieces on the wind
Unrelated

I still feel you
Beneath my skin
I am tempted
To throw my senses in

'Cause its easier to fly
Than to face another night of southern sun
And your love is all around
In the air to set me free

Set me free
'Cause its easier to fly
Set me free
