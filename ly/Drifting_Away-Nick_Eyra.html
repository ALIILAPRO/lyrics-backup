		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Every time I lose my self control
It feels like I can’t let you go
I’m at the point of no return
Don’t ever wanna come back down
I’m up so high above the ground
This feeling I will always yearn

Drifting away
I’m flying, I’m gonna head for paradise
Nothing to say
I’m climbing, I wanna stay right here tonight

Now I’ve got you in front of me
I’ll take the opportunity
To keep on doing nothing at all
Don’t never ever wanna come back down
My sight is blackened while the lights are bright
And I come to wonder why the hell I tried 
Why the fuck I fought with a broken pride
You’ll forget my weakness
Try and break me down

Drifting away
I’m flying, I’m gonna head for paradise
Nothing to say
I’m climbing, I wanna stay right here tonight
My mind is going under
Am I prepared to take my turn
The cutting edge of my regrets
Is making up for your mistakes

This was the last time I faked a smile
For the sake of my wellness I’m willing to fight

Don’t let me go
I’m drifting away
Tell me who I was
I’ve got nothing left to say
Don’t let me go
You paved my way to this show
With something I can’t find, something out of sight
Tell me who I was before my heart goes numb
I know for sure the sun will fall down and I’ll be coming home
That’s all I’m here for

Drifting away
I’m flying, I’m gonna head for paradise
Nothing to say
I’m climbing, I wanna stay right here tonight
My mind is going under
Am I prepared to take my turn
The cutting edge of my regrets
Is making up for your mistakes
