		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Over, shawty pop a molly for her soul ya
Mm, I never want her body sober
Up all night 'til it's over
Ay, ay, ay
Over, shawty pop a molly for her soul ya
Mm, I never want her body sober
Up all night 'til it's over
Ay, ay, ay
Be there for her, 'til she sober
Shawty need to pop a molly for her soul ya
She want dope yeah, need to float yeah
I just wanna fuck her 'til she got her soul back
Pull ya from the side, ya to some doggy, yeah you know
I know that you love it how I like it when you moan
I just need some time but she ready for round two
Yeah baby I do it, yeah I do it 'til it's
Over, shawty pop a molly for her soul ya
Mm, I never want her body sober
Up all night 'til it's over
Ay, ay
Over, shawty pop a molly for her soul ya
Mm, I never want her body sober
Up all night 'til it's over
Ay, ay, ay
I'm goin' there, 'cause I been thinking 'bout her since this morning
Ooh baby, come and put it on me
Up all night going all in
(Swisha)
She want my heart but I never could accept that
Messing 'round with you was like a death trap
It ain't what I thought, we was getting lost
Now I make plays like the Red Blacks
You a bad habit, I'ma dead that, oh you love me?
You should of never said that
Focused on the coin, yeah she wanna join
I'm just tryna figure where your head at
I know where you wanna go
Don't lie, I can see the signs
When the smoke clears and the night is done
Will you call me, will you call me up?
Over, shawty pop a molly for her soul ya
Mm, I never want her body sober
Up all night 'til it's over
Ay, ay
Over, shawty pop a molly for her soul ya
Mm, I never want her body sober
Up all night 'til it's over
Ay, (Pressa), ay, ay
I left the crib with my Giuseppe's on, the spotlight is on
Bad bitch, took her to prom, Christina Milian
Dope is hella strong, clip is hella long
My label at the top, BFR it's on
Got the fire on, turn 'em deadmihana
She jump from pad to pad, she a little frog
Bed to bed, chant to chant
She a lil' bitch, something I never saw
Over, shawty pop a molly for her soul ya
Mm, I never want her body sober
Up all night 'til it's over
Ay, ay
Over, shawty pop a molly for her soul ya
Mm, I never want her body sober
Up all night 'til it's over
Ay, ay, ay
