		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Oh, oh-oh)
(Oh, yeah)

Baby, you can do it, take your time, do it right 
You can do it, baby, do it tonight 
You can take me to your crib, you can ride it all ni- 
You can do it, baby, do it to (do it to)

Take me to your crib and we can party all night (take me to your crib and we can)
Let's do it, baby (let's do it)
Let's do it tonight (let's do it)
Take me to your crib and we can party all night (take me to your crib and we can)
Let's do it, baby (let's do it)
Let's do it tonight

And I ain't know why I fuck with you 
Gonna end up fallin' in love with you 
It's the type of shit you expose me to 
Then I pulled up side by side in my Mercedes coupe 
Ain't nobody got you like I got you
We move higher and higher, you see what really matters
Ain't nobody got you like I got you
I been touchin' a bag and climbin' the ladder

Baby, you can do it, take your time, do it right 
You can do it, baby, do it tonight 
You can take me to your crib, you can ride it all ni- (night)
You can do it, baby, do it to (do it to)

Take me to your crib and we can party all night (take me to your crib and we can)
Let's do it, baby (let's do it)
Let's do it tonight (let's do it)
Take me to your crib and we can party all night (take me to your crib and we can)
Let's do it, baby (let's do it)
Let's do it tonight

Shawty once sat in my lap and said, "Your heart is just to steal" (yeah)
Shawty went and heard my voice and now she started catchin' feels
She wipe down the pole to get her grip and clap her heels (yeah)
I can't see my feet, paint the room with dollar bills
So what's there to do? 
I'm in a mood 
Don't stop vibin' (yeah, yeah), keep it cool
Made you revenue 
Baby, what's the move? (What's your move?)
Don't give up on your purpose
In the strip club, but you're still workin'
Feel like you're runnin' in circles, I know what your worth is

Baby, you can do it, take your time, do it right 
You can do it, baby, do it tonight 
You can take me to your crib, you can ride it all ni- 
You can do it, baby, do it to (do it to)

And I ain't know why I fuck with you 
Gonna end up fallin' in love with you 
It's the type of shit you expose me to 
Then I pulled up side by side in my Mercedes coupe 
Ain't nobody got you like I got you
We move higher and higher, you see what really matters
Ain't nobody got you like I got you
I been touchin' a bag and climbin' the ladder
