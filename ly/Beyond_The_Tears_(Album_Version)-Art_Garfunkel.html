		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lost again.
I see it in your eyes you feel alone again.
I made it just in time to break your fall again.
You thought you'd come so far, but here we are again.
Down again.
I see it on your face the hope is gone just when,
You thought the pieces fit, but you fell apart again.
And as I was before, here I am again.
But if you could see Beyond The Tears,
You'd know love won't desert you.
To see beyond the tears, you know I'll never hurt you.
To see the sun behind the rain, feel the joy behind the pain.
You know you'll see me standin' right beyond the tearsâ?¦
Once again, I see it in your look, you're feelin' lost again.
And now you are afraid to try your love again,
'Cause this lonely moment feels like the end.
But if you could see Beyond The Tears
You'd know love won't desert you.
To see beyond the tears, you know I'll never hurt you.
To see the sun behind the rain, feel the joy behind the pain.
You know you'll see me standin' right beyond the tears.
When alone turns to lonely, and loneliness to fear,
It's so easy to imagine love will disappear,
But love is always here.
If you could see Beyond The Tears,
You'd know love won't desert you.
To see beyond the tears, you know I'll never hurt you.
To see the sun behind the rain, feel the joy behind the pain.
You know you'll see me standin' right beyond the tearsâ?¦
See me standin' right Beyond The Tears,
See me standin' right Beyond The Tears,
Right Beyond The Tears.
