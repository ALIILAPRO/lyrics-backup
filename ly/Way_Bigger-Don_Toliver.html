		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got base but it hit way bigger (ooh-ooh)
Jet ski slide but the waves way bigger

Goyard bag but it hit way bigger (yeah, yeah)
Pour that deuce in my lemonade, nigga (yeah)
Can't get off it, it ain't six figures
Shawty ran off with a rich ass nigga (whoa)
Paid my dues in the streets, I'm litty
With a bad bitch through the whole pandemic (yeah, yeah)
When it hit the hole, threw the whole ninth inning
Eatin' and beatin', the whole night swimmin'

Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh (woo, ooh, ooh)
Whoa, whoa, oh-oh (woo, ooh)
Whoa, whoa, oh-oh (woo, ooh)

In heat, like sauna
I'm blowing marijuana (geet, geet)
Don't judge me your honor (yeah)
She keep it on her
At least a hunna
She spend it if she wanna
She flocky, that's my guala (flocky)
Yeah

Goyard bag but it hit way bigger (yeah, yeah)
Pour that deuce in my lemonade, nigga (yeah)
Can't get off it, it ain't six figures
Shawty ran off with a rich ass nigga (whoa)
Paid my dues in the streets, I'm litty
With a bad bitch through the whole pandemic (yeah, yeah)
When it hit the hole, threw the whole ninth inning
Eatin' and beatin', the whole night swimmin'

Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh (woo, ooh, ooh)
Whoa, whoa, oh-oh (woo, ooh)
Whoa, whoa, oh-oh (woo, ooh)

Smash on the gas and a bitch can't get up
Lambo' truck and a bitch came with her (yeah)
Too much money, got shit to get rid of (woo)
Lay your head down, let me get it in the sit up (yeah)
A one time call went down, Vice City (whoa, whoa)
Going against the grain, I pity (whoa, whoa)
Hundreds of bands in cash, it's litty
Rockin' her off the wall (wall)
Split it with the fam, I want to
Count a couple M's and run through
Blue, blue cash I thumb through (blue, blue cash)
Thumb through, thumb through
My eyes red, I'm turnin' up
XYZ's, I'm curvin' her
Need Visine in that 'Rari
Need that lean, oh, yeah-yeah

Goyard bag but it hit way bigger (yeah, yeah)
Pour that deuce in my lemonade, nigga (yeah)
Can't get off it, it ain't six figures
Shawty ran off with a rich ass nigga (whoa)
Paid my dues in the streets, I'm litty
With a bad bitch through the whole pandemic (yeah, yeah)
When it hit the hole, threw the whole ninth inning
Eatin' and beatin', the whole night swimmin'

Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh (woo, ooh, ooh)
Whoa, whoa, oh-oh (woo, ooh)
Whoa, whoa, oh-oh (woo, ooh)

I got base but it hit way bigger
Jet ski slide but the waves way bigger
Go off the deuce when I do two fingers
Shawty ran off with a rich ass nigga
I got base but it hit way bigger
Jet ski slide but the waves way, way bigger
