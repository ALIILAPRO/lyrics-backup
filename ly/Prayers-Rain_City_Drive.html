		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You look beautiful but you feel so low
Why you going to a party that way
I could let it play through another show
But I don't wanna hear you're sorry again

Cause I'm starting to think when I'm not by your side that your tellin me tellin me lies

You can act like nothing's wrong
In a place you don't belong
Up until you walk into the light
Whoa
But you can't tell where you are
Probably tripping over stars
Or are you stumbling down the blvd
Gonna keep you in my prayers tonight

Deep down deep down you know
Deep down deep down you know
Deep down deep down you know
Know you're not that innocent

I know I'm only one that you wanna touch
But you know you been a handful
And I can handle a lot
Yeah
Imma turn it off cause I care too much
Heard you say you're being careful- I know you're not
Cause I know you don't know when to stop

You can act like nothing's wrong
In a place you don't belong
Up until you walk into the light
Whoa
But you can't tell where you are
Probably tripping over stars
Or are you stumbling down the blvd
Gonna keep you in my prayers tonight

(Deep down deep down you know)
Know you're not that innocent
(Deep down deep down you know)
You know it turns me on

You can act like nothing's wrong
In a place you don't belong
Up until you walk into the light
Whoa
But you can't tell where you are
Probably tripping over stars
Or are you stumbling down the blvd
Gonna keep you in my prayers tonight
