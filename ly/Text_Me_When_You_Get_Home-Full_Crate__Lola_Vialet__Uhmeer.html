		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I see what you be going through
I need to know if you made it back safe
So text me when you get home
(And can you text me when you get home?)
Show me what you're going through
Baby, I notice it's you
I love it when my phone vibrates the second you get home
(I'll be waiting for your text when you get home)

You said you're dipping out
Not one to get around (and I don't want you to go)
But since you left, your name been stuck up on my phone
And now I feel alone

Ooh, but you don't have to (you know I love you)
There's no denying that I feel secure with you
And, boy, you should know better
You should know me by now
'Cause when I step out of this door, you're the first one I think about

Late in the night when it gets cold (late in the night)
I'll be by your side when the rain falls
'Cause you are the sun that's bright enough to keep me warm

I see what you be going through
I need to know if you made it back safe
So text me when you get home
(Can you text me when you get home? Oh, yeah)
Show me what you going through
Baby, I notice you
I love it when my phone vibrates the second you get home
(I'll be waiting for your text when you get home)
(I'm thinking 'bout you text, boy) uh

You left my crib, I walked you to ya whip and watched you go
We shared a kiss, I said, "When you get home just let me know"
Now I can't sit down, I move around
Pacing waiting for my bae to say she made it home, huh
I know I grow impatient taking minutes off ya phone, huh
Because with our relations, I get scared to stay alone
So I resort to thinking 'bout the sinking route
We took to quench thirst, waiting for you to reply
Patiently wrote you this verse, I said

Late in the night when it gets cold
I'll be by your side when the rain falls
'Cause you are the sun that's bright enough to keep me warm

I see what you been going through
I need to know if you made it back safe
So text me when you get home (I need to know, baby)
(I need to know when you get home)
Show me what you going through
Baby, I notice you
I love it when my phone vibrates the second you get home (yeah)
The second you get home, baby (yeah)

Can you text me, let me know when you get home? (Yeah)
When you get home, when you get home
Can you text me let me know when you get home?
Text me when you get home
Can you text me, let me know when you get home? (I'll text you when you get home)
(I need to know)
When you get home (I need to know)
When you get home
Can you text me, let me know when you get home? (I need to know)
When you get home (I need to know)
When you get home
