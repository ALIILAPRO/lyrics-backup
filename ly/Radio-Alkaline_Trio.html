		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Shaking like a dog shittin' razorblades
Waking up next to nothing after dreaming of you and me
I'm waking up all alone, waking up so relieved
While you're taking your time with apologies

I'm making my plans for revenge
Red eyes on orange horizons
If Columbus was wrong, I'd drive straight off the edge
I'd drive straight off the edge

Taking your own life with boredom
I'm taking my own life with wine
It helps you to rule out the sorrow
It helps me to empty my mind

Making the most of a bad time
I'm smoking the brains from my head
Leaving the coal calling the kettle black and orange and red
This kettle is seeing red

I've got a big fat fuckin' bone to pick with you my darling
In case you haven't heard I'm sick and tired of trying
I wish you would take my radio to bathe with you
Plugged in and ready to fall

Shaking like a dog shittin' razorblades
Waking up next to nothing after dreaming of you and me
Waking up all alone, waking up so relieved
While you're taking your time with apologies

I'm planning out my revenge
Red eyes on orange horizons
If Columbus was wrong I'd drive straight off the edge
I'm seeing red

I've got a big fat fuckin' bone to pick with you my darling
In case you haven't heard, I'm sick and tired of trying
I wish you would take my radio to bathe with you
Plugged in and ready to fall

Plugged in and ready to fall
Plugged in and ready to fall
Plugged in and ready to fall
