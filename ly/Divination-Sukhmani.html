		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I think I've known for many moons just where this was going
I held my breath, I lost my head
I let it show

Tell me you'll remember 
Don't forget the promises you made 
when you were whispering 
You had to go

I think that I'd believe you if I saw it in your eyes, 
But in this moment, all I have 
I'm letting go

I stand beneath the stars 
I am written in their lights
Staring into the mouth of the lion 

Ohhh - And when I see it I will know
Ohhh - And when I see it I will know 
Ohhh - And when I see it I will know 
Ohhh

I could weave a melody from dreams I had of you
So whisper one more, won't you and
We'll see it through

I could weave a melody from dreams I had of you
So whisper one more, won't you and
We'll see it through

I could weave a melody from dreams I had of you
So whisper one more, won't you and
We'll see it through

I could weave a melody from dreams I had of you
So whisper one more, won't you and
We'll see it through
