		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I could run
I could cry, I could plead
I could say it's never gonna get any better, then leave
I could throw my hands up
I could fall to my knees
I could tell myself I'm strong enough
To give all the love that I need

But I still need you
To ease my load
Hold me when the lightning strikes
Lead me home
When I don't know which way is right
Love me when it's hard, I promise that I'm not
Leaving from your side
And when I fall apart, promise in the dark
You'll be my nightlight, ooh
You'll be my nightlight, ooh
You'll be my nightlight, ooh
You'll be my nightlight, ooh
You'll be my nightlight

You'll be my nightlight

I could count
Every time that I've fallen (fallen)
Even when I'm in so deep
It gets hard to see you're still all in
I've been lost by myself in the darkness
Know that I can find my way
Even on the days when it's hardest

But I still need you
To ease my load
Hold me when the lightning strikes
Lead me home
When I don't know which way is right
Love me when it's hard, I promise that I'm not
Leaving from your side
And when I fall apart, promise in the dark
You'll be my nightlight, ooh
You'll be my nightlight, ooh
You'll be my nightlight, ooh
You'll be my nightlight, ooh
You'll be my nightlight, ooh

You'll be my nightlight, ooh
