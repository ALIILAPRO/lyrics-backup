		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's the last, it's the last time
Oh, that's what I keep saying about us
In the past, put you back there
I try moving on but you never budge

So I never get to give my love
To someone who actually deserves it all
'Cause I turn around and you're there saying, "Please don't go"
So I take you back 'cause when you're sad, I'm sad
Baby, don't do that, 'cause when you're sad, I'm sad (yeah)

Wonder why you're calling me so late
When you know I'm gonna worry
I can hear, hear the tears in your eyes
When you say, "Please come and get me"

So I never get to give my love
To someone who actually deserves it all
'Cause I turn around and you're there saying, "Please don't go"
So I take you back 'cause when you're sad, I'm sad (yeah)
Baby, don't do that, 'cause when you're sad, I'm sad

Oh, you don't understand a goodbye
'Cause it's been over for a long time
You know how to make me fall for you
Just like that
Baby, just like that
Baby, just like that
Baby, just like that
Baby, just like that
Ooh

It's the last, it's the last time
Oh, that's what I keep saying about us
In the past, put you back there
I try moving on but I just give up

Guess I'll never get to give my love
To someone who actually deserves it all
'Cause I turn around and you're there saying, "Please don't go"
So I take you back 'cause when you're sad, I'm sad
Baby, don't do that 'cause when you're sad, I'm sad
'Cause you know that you're the best I ever had
Yeah, I'll take you back 'cause when you're sad, I'm sad
