		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, I was just hangin' out
Some little west coast town
Found a bar out by the sand
So I made my way in
First thing that caught my eye
Like nothin' I ever seen
Sunburned auburn hair
A California dream
Yeah, she was shakin' them hips
To some old Motown song
I couldn't say a thing
So I sang along

She was a heartache on the dance floor (heartache on the dance floor)
Yeah, she's movin' through my mind (movin' through my mind)
I gotta know her name and I got to see her again
She's got me wonderin', yeah, I'm just wonderin'

Where she at, where she at, where she at tonight?
Where she at, where she at, where she at tonight?
Whoa
Yeah

So I just hung around
This little west coast town
I dropped by every night
I stayed to closin' time
My little mystery
That girl is killin' me
So I put on a song
Just to sing along

She was a heartache on the dance floor (heartache on the dance floor)
Yeah, she's movin' through my mind (movin' through my mind)
I gotta know her name and I got to see her again
She's got me wonderin', yeah, I'm just wonderin'

Where she at, where she at, where she at tonight?
Where she at, where she at, where she at tonight?
She's got me mesmerized, she's all I'm thinkin' 'bout
All I think about, think about, think about

So I'm right here right now
Hummin' this little song
If I could say a thing
I'd want you to know

You were a heartache on the dance floor (heartache on the dance floor)
Yeah, you're movin' through my mind (movin' through my mind)
Oh, I got to know your name, I gotta see you again
And if you're listenin', listenin', listenin'

Where you at, where you at, where you at tonight?
Where you at, where you at, where you at tonight?
Girl, I'm hangin' 'round this little town
Yeah, I've been lookin' for you, baby
Where you at, where you at, where you at tonight?
Where you at, where you at, where you at tonight?
Whoa, whoa
