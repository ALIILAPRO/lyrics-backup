		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I just looked at my wrist, I got time today
Fuck it, I'm crossin' the line today
The hate be so real, the love be fake
Be bumpin' they gums and bumpin' my tape
Don't go against me then ask for my help
Go get out your feelings and get it yourself
Might got the same shoes but you ain't gon' step (nope)
The shit that you just put out, you could've kept, yep
She got a nigga, he gotta share (why?)
You can't compete when you can't compare (period)
She ate the dick through my underwear (uh)
Got up and got herself out of there
I see they put me on memes and things
Don't speak on my life without knowin' the real
Eight figures a year, what it cost me to live
Don't hold it, just say what you feel but
Watch your mouth 'fore I fly out your bitch (where?)
To a place that she didn't know exist (gone)
Mediterranean, water my wrist (bitch)
Keepin' 'em pissed, how I'm talkin' my shit
Six-figure check for a show, man I'm lit (lit)
Let's celebrate now my bag legit (go)
These niggas with me with whatever I'm with (yeah)
Didn't know who did it, got everybody hit, bitch (brrt)

I don't like niggas, I don't like bitches
I don't like nobody (nobody, nobody)
We can get gangsta, we can keep it cordial
How you wanna go 'bout it? (How you wanna do it?)
I don't backtrack, man, fuck that, I don't miss nobody (I don't miss nothin')
Left it on seen, I ain't write back, I don't trust nobody (period)

I just looked at my wrist, I got time today
Fuck it, I'm crossin' the line today
These bitches'll cry, be lyin' to your face (facts)
Slicker than us, gotta know how they play
If the money wasn't straight, she wouldn't be here today
Ain't it man, sure know what to say
You ain't me so it's hard to relate (what?)
How much cash I fuck off every day (Big Bagg)
Don't play with me, baby, go play with your pussy
You see him in person, these niggas be shookin'
A huncho it cost you a Quavo to book me
I'm worth it, the proof in the pudding
Surrounded by bitches (four of 'em)
I'm lookin' like William but they ain't my girlfriends (nah)
Bruh, I'ma spin on your block back to back
When they finish it look like the world end (dawg)
I ain't ask for it, they did it to me (what?)
Niggas exposin' they hands for free
Get caught in the middle, that's bullseye (get it too)
You got hit but we was targetin' he (him)
Poppin' my shit with a capital P (caps)
SRT, Redeye, red key (vroom)
Might be ugly but my bitch precious (bad)
She ain't even sneeze but still I bless her (achoo)

I don't like niggas, I don't like bitches
I don't like nobody (nobody, nobody)
We can get gangsta, we can keep it cordial
How you wanna go 'bout it? (How you wanna do it?)
I don't backtrack, man, fuck that, I don't miss nobody (I don't miss nothin')
Left it on seen, I ain't write back, I don't trust nobody (period)

I just looked at my wrist, I got time today
Fuck it, I'm crossin' the line today
I just looked at my wrist, I got time today
Fuck it, I'm crossin' the line today
I just looked at my wrist, I got time today
Fuck it, I'm crossin' the line today
