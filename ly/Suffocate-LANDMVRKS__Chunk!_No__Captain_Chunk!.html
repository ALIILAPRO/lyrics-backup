		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let down
Burned out
Nowhere to go

This pain in my gut turns to words in my throat
I know how it ends, please untie the rope
Somedays I feel something somedays I don't

And I'm drowning in my bed
Can't get out
Souvenirs are rushing in my head
Can't get out
There's so many things that I won't tell you about
I don't feel a thing but I can tell you that I'm

So low

I don't want to let you in
I want to let it go

Every-night I feel so lame
but I won't let you know

Everything is getting faster
I just feel so slow

I think I'm the one to blame I want to let it go

SUFFOCATE

I am drowning in my fears, I am calling out your name

I won't be falling, I can't run away
It seems like you trap me in games that you play
And you said you won't be the last to forget what it takes

You got me spinning, got lost in your lies
And I'm assuming you're having the time of your life
It's okay, you only care for what you really did

I don't want to let you in
I want to let it go
I think I'm the one to blame I want to let it go

SUFFOCATE
I am drowning in my fears, I am calling out your name

SUFFOCATE
Yeah you will me suffocate
Suffocating and I drown in my fears I just want the pain to fade away

So low I don't want to let you in
I want to let it go
