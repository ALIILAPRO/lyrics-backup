		<p>
		  Trap House cost a Benz (Trap)
Poppin locks and flippin Benz
Popping out my Timbs (Timbs)
Wiping off my lense I'm trying
To concentrate on sins (sins)
Just heard my dawg voice he
Goin hard in that Pin (Dawg)
Ion fuck on friends I give em
Hugs on the way in (Oohohoo)
I'm conley I be? We don't fuck on friends
We fuck on fine shit (Fine shit)
I came up from no Prezi leveled to surprises
(yeah)

They can't never show a
Backend cuz they lyin'
Casamigos met her friend and
Now I'm divin' in
Money don't grow on trees
Cheesin' wit the rose gold teeth
762 take the hair off that baby
You thought it grew out alopecia (God damn)
Run up a check and I'm standing on business
(Standing On)
I turn up her Ion go to the creek
I heard them boys like to fight
Used to go to the ground we keep it on fleek
(huuh)
Young nigga playin wit a check it's 2000
Dollars we put on a tee
448 From RARI Keep it 1000 cost a fee
This a Import that baby loaded like a
Bentley you know Ian talm bout me

I'm in New York like a Panda (Panda)
Co keep them bands like he Santa (Santa)
Chopper sound like a Piano
Red beam on that boy you can play like you
Run up but you gone be running wit Prancer
Lemme sip on that Fanta (Ice)
Then she fuck like the?

Trap House cost a Benz (Trap)
Poppin locks and flippin Benz
Popping out my Timbs (Timbs)
Wiping off my lease I'm trying
To concentrate on sins (sins)
Just heard my dawg voice he
Goin hard in that Pin (Dawgs)
Ion fuck on friends I give em
Hugs on the way in (OohOhooh)
I'm conley I be? (Be hot)
We don't fuck on friends
We fuck on fine shit (Fine shit)
I came up from no Prezi leveled to surprises
(Yeeah)

Iced out Rollie like Gunna Prezi
It's timeless (Gunna Wunna)
Cuff yo hoe don't want this thot
Then come and find the bitch
Rose Gold Championship Rings (Rose)
Pour up a 4 of that Lean (4)
Nigga wit some Chrome Heart Jeans
Nigga talm bout Ice and they freeze (Brr)
I'ma leave em where he can't breathe
(Brrrr) top shelf rockin' BBs
(Gotit) walk em down me and my Ps (Wooo)

Big check
Heard you want problems where the stick at?
Go put a dime where they chew at
Where I come from yeah I do get back
Chasin' dolla signs go hit the
Block wit a big bag
You a gangsta den prove it
None of this shit be new to me
See my bitch in Poochie
Diamonds ain't nun you ain't foolin' me
I be rollin' (Rollin)
Like my dawg like borex
My bitch like Kelly Rowland (Rowland)
457 I'm rollin'

Trap House cost a Benz
(Trap) poppin locks and flippin Benz
Popping out my Timbs (Timbs)
Wiping off my lease I'm trying
To concentrate on sins (sins)
Just heard my dawg voice he
Goin hard in that Pin (Dawgs)
Ion fuck on friends I give em
Hugs on the way in (Oohohooh)
I'm conley I be? We don't fuck on friends
We fuck on fine shit (Fine shit)
I came up from no Prezi leveled to surprises
(Yeeah)
