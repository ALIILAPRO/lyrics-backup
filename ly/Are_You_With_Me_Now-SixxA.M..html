		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Laughing like we're crazy
Nothing mattered, nothing fazed me
We were younger then
So much younger then

Everything seems rotten
Through the eyes of the forgotten
We were dumber then
So much dumber then

Well have I judged a book by how it's bound
Am I lost or am I found
And are you with me

Are you with me now?
Come back from the dead
You've been inside your head for too long
Are you with me now?
Find the places that scare you
Come on I dare you
Are you with me?
Are you with me?

The years have took their toll
And all the things I can't control
Come back to haunt me now
Almost taunt me now
What's left to be afraid of
We found out what we are made of
And we've come this far
We both have the scars

Well have I judged a book by how it's bound
Am I lost or am I found
And are you with me

Are you with me now?
Come back from the dead
You've been inside your head for too long
Are you with me now
Find the places that scare you
Come on I dare you
Are you with me?
Are you with me?
are you with me?
are you with me?

Well have I judged a book by how it's bound
Am I lost or am I found
And are you with me

Come back from the dead
been inside your head for too long
Find the places that scare you

Are you with me now?
Come back from the dead
You've been inside your head for too long
Are you with me now
Find the places that scare you
Come on I dare you
Oh come on, I dare you

Are you with me?
Are you with me?
Are you with me?
Are you with me?
Are you with me?
Are you with me?
