		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This, this shit makes me crazy
(Ayy, turn me up Bally)
Yeah, huh, huh, woo
(Chyeah)

Saint Laurent (Saint Laurent), G-Wagon (G-Wagon)
Are you the one with the bag? Yes you are (yes you are)
Are you the one with the swag? Yes you are (hey)
Are you the one that's makin' her brag? Yes you are (chyeah)
Are you the one in your own zone? Yes indeed (yeah, yeah)
Are you the one niggas weren't tryna hear?
Now you on a jet gettin' geeked
Ship codeine when I go to Dubai, I'm tryna sip some lean (chyeah)
Got gyal in the UAE, got gyal in the West Indies

Hit the baddie, she givin' out promo
Her friend tryin' to sex on me
Stella McCartney, I give her magnolia
I'm givin' out Cartier rin's
I'm with the LGBTQ
But you can't tin' for a tin' (no-no-no)
Two baddies in the bed in my hotel room
Turnt to a wrestlin' rin' (chyeah)
African man and I can't ask for nothin'
I can't even beg your honor (huh)
Stand in the dance like Colonel Gaddafi
A nigga got female bodyguards
Popped her off in the coast in the coast of Amalfi
Yeah, I think she tryna stay a little longer
Backed out my shank on a artist
Niggas gonna dance like Awilo Longomba (chyeah)
Keep me a bad Emirati
Keep me a, keep me a bad bitch on me (ha)
Keep the cameras on me
Keep the, keep the starlight on me (come on)
Keep me a mob boss
I want money, I want bodies (come on)
Keep my ego goin'
Keep my codeine flowin' (come on)

Saint Laurent (c'mon), G-Wagon (chyeah)
Are you the one with the bag? Yes you are (yes you are)
Are you the one with the swag? Yes you are (c'mon)
Are you the one that's makin' her brag? Yes you are 

Unnuh fi know say the mob ah run tin's 
So all di bad mind people, all di bad frowzy gyal
The bruk pocket watch face bwoy
Bad man pussyole people, understand
We have di baddest gyal 'round here so
Bawty cock up, titty dem stiff
Pocket fulla whole heap ah cash
Benz punani, all the taxis dem affi gweh
Mob full of money, we nuh playin' nuh raasclaat games 'round here so
Real recognize real
Tell the poppy show fi gweh
