		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Every time I hear this groove
It makes me wanna move
Must be the feeling it brings to you
That makes you do what you do

Every time I hear this groove
It makes me wanna move
Must be the feeling it brings to you
That makes you do what you do

Time to groove
Time to groove

Every time I hear this groove
It makes me wanna move
Must be the feeling it brings to you
That makes you do what you do

It's time to move (time to move)
Time to get loose
Anywhere you are
It's time to groove (time to move)
Me and you
Out there on the floor

Every time I hear this groove
It makes me wanna move
Must be the feeling it brings to you
That makes you do what you do

Every time I hear this groove
It makes me wanna move
Must be the feeling it brings to you
That makes you do what you do

Time to groove
Time to groove

Every time I hear this groove
It makes me wanna move
Must be the feeling it brings to you
That makes you do what you do
