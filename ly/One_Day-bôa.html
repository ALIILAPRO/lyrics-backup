		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Last night I felt it
Burning through my mind
I just want to be your friend
And I want you to know

In the light of a new day
I left it all to you
In the light of confusion
I love you

Today I am stronger
In so many ways
I just want to be there
And I want you to see

In the light of a new day
Left it all to you
I'm just looking for a way out
And something else to do

I can feel it in my bones
That I need it
Don't you see it
I am flying over the mountains
Do you feel it

I won't be happy till you're out the door
You won't be happy till you get some more
You need me
You love me

I won't be happy till you're out the door
You won't be happy till you get some more
You need me
You love me, you love me
