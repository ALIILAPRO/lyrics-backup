		  Shake it up
Shake it up
Shake it up
Shake it up

Shake it up
Shake it up
Shake it up
Shake it up

Shake it up
Shake it up
When you're moving
To the music

You're dancing
When you're moving
Don't you stop
When you shake it

With your body
When you're spinning
Like a top

Shake it up
Shake it up
Shake it up
Shake it up

Shake it up
Shake it up
Shake it up
Shake it up

Shake it up
Shake it up
Shake it up
Shake it up

And your heart is
Beating faster
And your breath
It feels so hot

And the rhythm's
Getting tighter
Got to give it
What you've got

Shake it up
Shake it up
Shake it up
Shake it up

Shake it up
Shake it up
Shake it up
Shake it up

Shake it up
Shake it up
Shake it up
Shake it up

You forget your
Complications
Use your body
Not your brain

And we're moving
Getting closer
Got to shake it up
Again

Shake it up
Shake it up
Shake it up
Shake it up

Shake it up
Shake it up
Shake it up
Shake it up

Shake it up
Shake it up
Shake it up
Shake it up

Shake it up
Shake it up

When you're moving
To the music
You're dancing
When you're moving

Don't you stop
When you shake it
With your body
Better give it
What you've got

Shake it up
Shake it up
Shake it up
Shake it up

Shake it up
Shake it up
Shake it up
Shake it up

Shake it up
Shake it up
Shake it up
Shake it up

Shake it up
Shake it up
Shake it up
