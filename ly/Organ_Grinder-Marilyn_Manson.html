		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I am the face of piss and shit and sugar 
I do a crooked little dance with my funny little monkey 
What I want  what I want is just your children 
I hate what I have become to escape what I hated being 
Calliopenis envy from your daddy 
You're not gonna hear what he don't want to hear 
What I say disgusts him 
He wants to be me and that scares him 
"Let's do a funny little dance with my funny little monkey" 
The black keys 
Here is my real head, here is my real real head 
I wear this fucking mask because you cannot handle me 
Here is my real head 
They try to blink me not to think me 
Don't want to bring me out 
I am the rotten teeth, my fists are lined with suckers 
My prison skin's an eyesore-mirror-sketch-pad 
I am your son 
Your dad 
Your fag 
I am your fad
