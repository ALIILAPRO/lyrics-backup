		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Call me a Saint
Call me a liar
Call me your friend
Set me on fire
Go light a match
I’ll be your spark
I’ll be your fire
You’ll get through the dark
Don’t bite your tongue
I’ll be your sponge
Soak up the words when
You’re overwhelmed
Don’t hold it in
Get out of your head
Let it all out
It’s a means to an end
I know I said I’d
Be by your side no matter the time
But I can’t save your
World while I’m fighting for mine
I can’t be your saviour
But I can be a beacon for you
Can’t preach with my behaviour
But I can be a beacon for you
I can’t be your saviour
But I can be a beacon for you
No knight in shining armour
But I can be a beacon for you
(Beacon for you)
We have our wars
We have our posts
We have our battles
To which we’re betrothed
I have my demons
You’ve seen my scars
I’m in the trenches
Don’t wish on my star
I know I said I’d
Be by your side no matter the time
But I can’t save your
World while I’m fighting for mine
I can’t be your saviour
But I can be a beacon for you
Can’t preach with my behaviour
But I can be a beacon for you
I can’t be your saviour
But I can be a beacon for you
No knight in shining armour
But I can be a beacon for you
(Beacon for you)
(Call me a Saint)
You called me a Saint
For my mistake
Of always giving
More than I take
I’m not a Saint
That’s your mistake
You should be careful
With your blind faith
