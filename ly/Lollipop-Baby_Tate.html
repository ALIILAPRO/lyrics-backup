		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  More, more, more, more, more, more

Maybe I'm greedy, I don't care
'Cause I want somebody who I know will always be there
Maybe I'm needy, that's okay
'Cause I got desires and I just can't make 'em go away

And I won't let you go
Once we get personal
Take your time if you want
But I gotta make sure you know

If I let you lick the lollipop
Then you better not let it drop down to the floor
If you crushin' on me, never stop
Once I give it to you, boy, I need some more
More, more, more, more, more, more
Once I give it to you, boy, I need some more
More, more, more, more, more, more
Once I give it to you, boy

Ain't no sense of letting you in
If as soon as it's over, you just pretend
We were never more than just friends
'Cause the love I require, ain't on the fence (ooh, no)

And I won't let you go (let you go)
Once we get personal (personal)
Take your time if you want (if you want)
But I gotta make sure you know

If I let you lick the lollipop (lollipop)
Then you better not let it drop down to the floor
If you crushin' on me, never stop (never stop)
Once I give it to you, boy, I need some more
More, more, more, more, more, more
Once I give it to you, boy, I need some more
More, more, more, more, more, more
Once I give it to you, boy

I need more, boy, do the most
Hop on top and hold me close
Catch a grip, don't leave me 'lone
Rock that ship, boy, sail my boat
I need more, boy, do the most
Hop on top and hold me close
Catch a grip, don't leave me 'lone
Rock that ship, boy, sail my boat
I'm floating, slow motion (yeah)
I'll catch it, boy, I'm wide open (yeah)
You rocking (oh), I'm rolling (yeah)
I'll hold the door but it's closing (yeah)
I'm floating, slow motion (yeah)
I'll catch it, boy, I'm wide open (yeah)
You rocking (oh), I'm rolling (yeah)
I'll hold the door but it's closing (yeah)

If I let you lick the lollipop (lollipop)
Then you better not let it drop down to the floor
If you crushin' on me, never stop (never stop)
Once I give it to you, boy, I need some more
More, more, more, more, more, more (I need some more)
Once I give it to you, boy, I need some more
More, more, more, more, more, more
Once I give it to you, boy
