		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Help me just to pass this test of time
I wish that I was blind
Strange thing to wish for
But I just can't unsee all this misery

Help me clear this fear that's in my mind
I wish that it was lost
I can't help but think this world is on the brink
In my mind

But everything's not lost (all is not lost)
'Cause Christmas and New Years is coming on strong
Everything's not lost (all is not lost)
'Cause Christmas and New Years is coming on strong
Everything is not lost (all is not lost)
'Cause Christmas and New Years is coming on strong
Good tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy, comfort and joy, comfort and joy

Help me just to cover my ears
'Cause I don't wanna hear
Strange thing to wish for
But I can't help but hear children in fear
Bangs from bombs that shatter moms to tears

But everything's not lost (all is not lost)
'Cause Christmas and New Years is coming on strong
Everything's not lost (all is not lost)
'Cause Christmas and New Years is coming on strong
Everything is not lost (all is not lost)
'Cause Christmas and New Years is coming on strong
Good tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy, comfort and joy
Comfort and joy, comfort and joy, oh

Christmas time is here
Good tidings to men
Peace and joy
