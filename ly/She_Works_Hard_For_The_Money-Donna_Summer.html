		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She works hard for the money
So hard for it, honey
She works hard for the money
So you better treat her right
She works hard for the money
So hard for it, honey
She works hard for the money
So you better treat her right

Onetta there in the corner stands
And she wonders where she is
And it's strange to her
Some people seem to have everything
Nine AM on the hour hand
And she's waiting for the bell
And she's looking real pretty
She's waiting for her clientele

She works hard for the money
So hard for it, honey
She works hard for the money
So you better treat her right
She works hard for the money
So hard for it, honey
She works hard for the money
So you better treat her right

Twenty-eight years have come and gone
And she's seen a lot of tears
Of the ones who come in
They really seem to need her there
It's a sacrifice working day to day
For little money, just tips for pay
But it's worth it all to hear them say that they care

She works hard for the money
So hard for it, honey
She works hard for the money
So you better treat her right

Already knows she's seen her bad times
Already knows these are the good times
She'll never sell out, she never will
Not for a dollar bill
She works hard

She works hard for the money
So hard for it, honey
She works hard for her money
So you better treat her right
Hard for the money
So hard for it, honey
She works hard for the money
So you better treat her right (alright)
She works hard for the money (hard, hard, hard for the money)
So hard for it, honey (hard, hard, hard for it, honey)
She works hard for the money
So you better treat her right
She works hard for the money (hard, hard, hard for the money)
So hard for it, honey (hard, hard, hard for it, honey)
Works hard for the money
So you better treat her right (alright)
She works hard for the money (hard, hard, hard for the money)
So hard for it, honey (hard, hard, hard for it, honey)
She works hard for the money
So you better treat her right
