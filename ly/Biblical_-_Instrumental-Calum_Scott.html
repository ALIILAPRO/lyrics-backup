		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Didn't know that I'd fall so hard
Then my feet left the ground
Gravity don't make no sense when you're around
I come up against myself when
Demons in my head get loud
I don't know how you do it, but you turn them down

I slip and wonder who I'd be
If I never found you and you never found me
Well, I don't wanna see

So won't you give me tonight
And the rest of your life?
I wanna have it all with you
I wanna have it all with you
And when you open your eyes
I'll be there by your side
I wanna have it all with you
I wanna have it all with you

'Cause your love is biblical
Biblical
It's biblical

If you ever go to pieces
Fall between the thunder clouds
I will put you back together, I won't let you down

I slip and wonder what I'd do
If you never found me and I never found you
I don't know what I'd do

So won't you give me tonight
And the rest of your life
I wanna have it all with you
I wanna have it all with you
And when you open your eyes
I'll be there by your side
I wanna have it all with you
I wanna have it all with you

I wanna have it all
(I wanna have it all)
I wanna have it all
(I wanna have it all)
I wanna have it, I wanna have it all

'Cause your love is biblical
It's biblical
It's biblical

So won't you give me tonight
And the rest of your life?
I wanna have it all with you
I wanna have it all with you

So come on and give me tonight
And the rest of your life
I wanna have it all with you
I wanna have it all with you
And when you open your eyes
I'll be there by your side
I wanna have it all with you
I wanna have it all with you

'Cause your love is biblical
It's biblical
It's biblical
