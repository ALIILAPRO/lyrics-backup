		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Looking right and the time flies
I took a deal just a while back
Think we fucked in the flashback
Only my mind kinda sidetracked
Found good, but now I feel bad
Like I know I can't take it back
No, there's nothin' I can say

Must be an addiction
I wanted it all, didn't expect it to fall
Must be an affliction
I wanted to call, but I didn't call
Now it's keeping me up night 'n day
Keeping me up night 'n day
Must be an addiction
Now there's nothing I can say but

I guess I want too much (too much)
I just want love and lust
You just can't love me back (yeah)
That's why I need a touch
That's why I need a touch (yeah)
That's why I need a touch
That's why I need a touch (yeah)
That's why I need a touch

I never meant to but I did though
I gotta keep it on the d-low
Then again, what the fuck do I know?
You're always on my mind, so
Found good, but now I feel bad
Like I know I can't take it back
No, there's nothin' I can say

Must be an addiction
I wanted it all, didn't expect it to fall
Must be an affliction
I wanted to call, but I didn't call
Now it's keeping me up night 'n day
Keeping me up night 'n day
Must be an addiction
Now there's nothing I can say but

I guess I want too much (too much)
I just want love and lust
You just can't love me back (yeah)
That's why I need a touch
That's why I need a touch (yeah)
That's why I need a touch
That's why I need a touch (yeah)
That's why I need a touch

When the room becomes a game we play
When lights, they seem to turn to snakes
I guess I'll turn your back
Say white lights, between your face
You know I love my place
Nothing I can say
Nothing I can say (nothing I can say)

I guess I want too much (too much)
I just want love and lust
You just can't love me back (yeah)
That's why I need a touch
That's why I need a touch (yeah)
That's why I need a touch
That's why I need a touch (yeah)
That's why I need a touch
