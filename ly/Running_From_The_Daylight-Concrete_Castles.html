		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's been a weird night
and everybody's getting wired
they don't wanna go home
 
A little moon shine
soak up my problems
til' they really feel like nothing at all
 
A life I can't remember
Darkness stay forever
Stitch me back together
The best i've ever felt
I just wanna stay in hell
yeah I'm
 
Bleeding from my eyes
Never gonna cry
Now it's do or die
Runnin' from the daylight
 
Have we had enough?
What have we become?
Nowhere left to hide
Runnin' from the daylight
 
I want the nightmares
I want the voices in my head
I want em taking control
 
All of the poison
I'm drinking
Is numbing
My thinking
I love what I'm feeling
feel nothing at all
 
Bleeding from my eyes
Never gonna cry
Now it's do or die
Runnin' from the daylight
 
Have we had enough?
What have we become?
Nowhere left to hide
Runnin' from the daylight
 
Runnin' from the daylight
Bleeding from my eyes
Never gonna cry
Now it's do or die
Runnin' from the daylight
 
Have we had enough?
What have we become?
Nowhere left to hide
Runnin' from the daylight
 
Bleeding from my eyes
Never gonna cry
Now it's do or die
Runnin' from the daylight
 
Runnin' from the daylight
