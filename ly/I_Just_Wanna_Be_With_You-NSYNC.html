		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Na na na na na
Na na na na na
Na na na na na, na na na na na

I just wanna be with you
Girl that's all I want to do
I just wanna be with you
Girl that's all I want to do

Girl you're turning me on
You're such a fine lady
And sugar, more and more
You're driving me crazy (crazy)
'Cause you're just what I want
And I'm just what you need
Oh it's on
I'm gonna make you my baby
Sweet darlin' all I can see
Is you and me

'Cause I just wanna be with you
Girl that's all I want to do
I just wanna be with you
Girl that's all I want to do

I wanna drown in your love, lead me to your water
Let it flow (let it flow), just let it flow baby
My love is insane, pleasure and pain (pain)
It's part of life, so live it up baby (live it up baby)
Now if you're scared of love, don't, don't, don't be afraid
'Cause girl I'm scared too, but I gotta have you
Gonna love you day and night, yes I'll treat you right!

I just wanna be with you
Girl that's all I want to do
I just wanna be with you
Girl that's all I want to do

I just wanna be with you
Girl that's all I want to do
I just wanna be with you
Girl that's all I want to do

You and me
Gotta stay together
We'll be together, say
Na na na na na na na na
You and me
Gotta stay together
We'll be together, say
Na na na na na na na na na
Like, *NSYNC
That's right

I just wanna be with you
Girl that's all I want to do
I just wanna be with you
Girl that's all I want to do

I just wanna be with you
Girl that's all I want to do
I just wanna be with you
Girl that's all I want to do

Come and be with me, my baby!
