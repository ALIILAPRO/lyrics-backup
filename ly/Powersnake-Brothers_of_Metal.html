		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Deep beneath the surface
Lurks a mighty beast
A reptile of the ocean
A viper unleashed

This creature is enormous
With fangs as tall as trees
The wretched spawn of Loki
That was banished to the seas

Eyes glowing red in the dark on the ocean floor
As the serpent awakes

Powersnake
You will fade under the shadow of the
Powersnake
The wingless dragon
Storm fiend
Rival of the thunder god
Stronger than all
Powersnake

Driven out by Odin
No place to call his home
Cast out to the ocean
To the great unknown

His lust for vengeance rising
With the power of the waves
This dear abomination of a child
Has many names

Lindworm, king of serpents
Girdle of the realm
This guy has nothing left to prove
With size that overwhelms

JÃ¶rmundgandr, midgard serpent
Bane of Thor
The snake will get his sweet revenge
Come the final war

Eyes glowing red in the dark on the ocean floor
Mighty serpent
Roaring in the deep he's a beast that devours all
And the serpent awakes

Powersnake
You will fade under the shadow of the
Powersnake
The wingless dragon
Storm fiend
Rival of the thunder god
Stronger than all
Powersnake

So elusive and mysterious
Nessie is no match
The only thing in all the seas
Thor could never catch

With scales tough as shining steel
And steel in heart and mind
Across the world and back again
His body he can wind

The powersnake will drag you down
And drown you in his flesh
Beware to swim, and fear the sea
He likes his dinner fresh
