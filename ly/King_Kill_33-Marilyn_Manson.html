		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Is this what you wanted? This is what you get
Turned all your lives into this shit
You never accepted or treated me fair
Blame me for what I believe and I wear
You fucked yourselves and you raised these sheep
The blue and the withered seeds you will reap
You never gave me a chance to be me
Or even a fuckin' chance just to be
But I have to show you that you played a role
And I will destroy you with one simple hole
The world that hates me has taken it's toll
But now I have finally taken control
You wanted so bad to make me this thing
And I want you now to just kill the King

And I am not sorry, and I am not sorry
This is what you, you deserve
I am not sorry, and I am not sorry
This is what you deserve
And I am not sorry, and I am not sorry (King kill 33)
This is what you, you deserve (King kill 33)
And I am not sorry, and I am not sorry (King kill 33)
This is what you, you deserve (King kill 33)
(King kill 33)
(King kill 33)
