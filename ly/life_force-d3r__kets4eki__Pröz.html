		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ima fucking mute you
Told me you don't give a shit
You make me wanna hurt you
Hurt you, hurt you, hurt you, hurt you
(Marry me Pröz)
Hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt
You make me wanna hurt you
Ima shoot her bitch you die
I hope your family fucking cries
I'm watching you, I wanna see the life force leave your eyes
There isn't any jk bye
I want to see you drop and die
May-May-Maybe next time you won't lie
Then I wouldn't end your life
You lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie (You are a big lie)
You cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry (I hope you just cry)
You die, die, die, die, die, die (Just go fucking die)
Good bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye (This isn't no jk bye)
Jk bye
Hey I, Hey I, Hey I got bullets for your face
I-I-I don't lie, when I say I don't catch no case
Twenty five, that's how many gun wounds I can take
I'm a tank, you ain't nothing but a phony fake
Let's drink some liquor girl Ima make you feel better
Xanned out fucking all over the table top
I took her for a car ride, fuck that never mind
I looked at her and then I said, Ha-ha-ha, Jk bye!
Ha got left on the side of the road bitch
Never lonely with my bros
We making money smokin' lot
Poppin benzos at the club
We gon be partying all night long
I won't cry bitch it's your loss
You replaced me I don't feel worse
She regret and now she cries
I'm with my friends ain't giving fuck
Never lonely with my bros
We making money smokin' lot
Poppin benzos at the club
We gon be partying all night long
I won't cry bitch it's your loss
You replaced me I don't feel worse
She regret and now she cries
I'm with my friends ain't giving fuck
Ima shoot her bitch you die
I hope your family fucking cries
I'm watching you, I wanna see the life force leave your eyes
There isn't any jk bye
I want to see you drop and die
May-May-Maybe next time you won't lie
Then I wouldn't end your life
You lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie (You are a big lie)
You cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry (I hope you just cry)
You die, die, die, die, die, die (Just go fucking die)
Good bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye (This isn't no jk bye)
Never lonely with my bros
We making money smokin' lot
Poppin benzos at the club
We gon be partying all night long
I won't cry bitch it's your loss
You replaced me I don't feel worse
She regret and now she cries
I'm with my friends ain't giving fuck
