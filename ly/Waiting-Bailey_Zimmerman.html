		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Another day without you
Another midnight call
Distance ain't no friend of mine
Another lonesome highway
Another one of our songs
Nothin' gets you off my mind

But I'm waitin', yeah, I'm waitin'
For you to pick up the phone
And tell me that you're coming home
Yeah, I'm waitin', I'm waitin'
Every minute of every day
Just to hear you say
"I love you until we're dead and gone"
So I'm waitin'

Through every storm we weather
And through every page that's torn
I guess missin' you takes its time
And every minute and mile between us
Keeps me leanin' on a prayer to Jesus
Beggin' for the day He come back home

So I'm waitin', yeah, I'm waitin'
For you to pick up the phone
And tell me that you're comin' home
Yeah, I'm waitin', I'm waitin'
Every minute of every day
Just to hear you say
"I love you until we're dead and gone"
So I'm waitin'

I'm waitin', yeah, I'm waitin'
For you to come running home
So I can hold you in my arms
I'm waitin', I'm waitin'
Every minute of every day
Just to hear you say
"I love you until we're dead and gone"
And I'm gon' love you until we're dead and gone
So I'm waitin'
