		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Walking this high road are warriors from an olden time
Curse on this land and the days far behind us
Dragons we've slain, rescued many maiden?s fair
And no man ever dared break our stride 
Or the brotherhood that binds us.

Brothers are we, marching on the roads of time
From this broken land and the days that defined us
All men are free, justice is a sword we hold
Trusting in the knights noble vow 
In the brotherhood that binds us.

When the broken are strong 
	(Freak the mighty, Freak the mighty)
When the beaten are proud 
	(Freak the mighty, Freak the mighty)
When the twisted can stand 
	(Freak the mighty, Freak the mighty)
When the silenced can laugh 
	(Freak the mighty, Freak the mighty)
When the hunted have turned 
	(Freak the mighty, Freak the mighty)
When the tortured are sane 
	(Freak the mighty, Freak the mighty)
When the blinded still stare 
	(Freak the mighty, Freak the mighty)
When the poisoned remain 
	(Freak the mighty, Freak the mighty)
When the voiceless can sing 
	(Freak the mighty, Freak the mighty)
And the shackled can run 
	(Freak the mighty, Freak the mighty)
And this downtrodden man holds his face to the sun 
	(Freak the mighty, Freak the mighty)
We?ll be walking high above the world.
	(Freak the mighty, Freak the mighty)
Our legend will say

Freak the mighty
Freak the mighty
Freak the mighty
Freak the mighty...
