		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Bitch)
Corvette, Corvette
Hop in a motherfuckin' jet like jet
Like that
They be like, "Popp, why you walk like that?
Why you talk like that? Why you walk like that?"
(It's Lil Uzi Vert)

Uh, I'm off a Addy, I'm up
I don't got no time to relax (time to relax, yeah)
I turned a two to a four
And I turned a five to a stack, five to a stack (a five to a stack)
I was just down in the bottom
Talking the back of the back (the back of the back)
I got this shit out the mud
But they don't wanna talk about that, keep it a stack (ayy)

Know that we exing you out
If you be moving too false, and that's a fact (boy, what?)
Niggas keep talking 'bout looking for me
But them niggas cappin', they know where I'm at
If I ain't on Norris, then I'm on the V
11th, Girard to be exact (exact)
If I ain't on Norris, then I'm on the V
11th, Girard to be exact

Bitch, it's Lil Uzi Vert
Maybach, Maybach
I'm in the cut and my whip all black
Yes, I blend right in 'cause my paint all matte
And the shorty on my top, man, she need to back back
I remember she ain't even want me way back
Stay with a hundred racks stuffed (stuffed, stuffed, stuffed, stuffed, stuffed)
Probably why I walk like that, why I talk like that
I'm off a Perky I'm up, no it's no time to relax (no time to relax)
Want me to hit from the front, but I wanna hit from the back (hit from the back)
I'm a young nigga, I'm up, no it's no higher than that (no higher than that)
Niggas, they talkin' too much, y'all niggas, y'all kinda rats (kinda rats)
Okay, I'm rolling this Backwood up, y'all smoking all kinda wraps (what the fuck is that?)
I done put dick in your slut, and ask where the condom at (wait where the condom at?)

Okay, Popp done pulled up with two bitches, yeah (skrrt)
Corvette, Corvette (yeah, yeah)
Hopped out the motherfucking jet like that
I was too high and I had jetlag
And they say, "Uzi, why you talk like that? 
Why you walk like that? Why you talk like that?" (Yeah)
Wait, did I swag? It's too easy
I say she too needy, I say she too greedy
She say she always wanna believe me
But every day, she accuse me of the cheating (damn, ayy, yeah)
Me and Popp got a show, bitch, so I'm leaving, bye

I'm off a Addy, I'm up
I don't got no time to relax (time to relax)
I turned a two to a four
And I turned a five to a stack, five to a stack (five to a stack)
I was just down in the bottom
Talking the back of the back (the back of the back)
I got this shit out the mud
But they don't wanna talk about that (wanna talk about that)

Uh, I'm off a Addy, I'm up
I don't got no time to relax (no time to relax)
I turned a two to a four
And I turned a five to a stack, five to a stack
I was just down in the bottom
Talking the back of the back (the back of the back)
I got this shit out the mud
But they don't wanna talk about that (wanna talk about that)

Fuck all the opps for real
Yeah, I'm dissing you, uh
I drop a bag on your head
Just to get rid of you, uh
Bitch, I ain't duckin' no action
You gon' get rid of who?
Me and Tay sliding on niggas
And we got missiles too

I'm off a Addy, I'm up
I don't got no time to relax (time to relax)
I turned a two to a four
And I turned a five to a stack, five to a stack
I was just down in the bottom
Talking the back of the back
I got this shit out the mud
But they don't wanna talk about that
I'm off a Addy, I'm up
I don't got no time to relax (time to relax)

I turned a two to a four
And I turned a five to a stack, five to a stack
I was just down in the bottom
Talking the back of the back
I got this shit out the mud
But they don't wanna talk about that
