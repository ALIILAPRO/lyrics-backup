		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I go down the beaten track
Along the river with an empty bank
At the end she said to me:
"Why are you here with the autumn leaves?"

'Cause this is my life, my friend
And this is my time to stand
'Cause this is my life, my friend
And I can't be no one else

I'm done, tipping on my toes
Strike an iron and attack my soul
Misty moon, you're gonna see
I've got you blues to get on my feet

'Cause this is my life, my friend
And this is my time to stand
'Cause this is my life, my friend
And I can't be no one else

I don't wanna run I don't wanna fight
I don't wanna hide I just wanna stay free
To be me
I don't wanna win I don't wanna lose
I don't wanna play I just wanna remember
Oh I'm my name

This is my life, my friend
And I can't be no one else
This is my life, my friend
And I can't be no one else
