		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I need you baby damn I need you all the time
Can't seem to escape no
I can't get you off my mind

I need you baby damn I need you all the time
I can't seem to escape no
I can't get you off my mind
I'm pessimistic baby
Glass half empty I can't change I
Can't go all the way

Here we go, yea alone again
I'm safe and sound, yeah i'm MIA, yeah
Weight of the world on me, yea
Waiting for the days to be, yea
Better off, better off
Better off if I just leave

I need you baby damn I need you all the time
I can't seem to escape no
I can't get you off my mind
I'm pеssimistic baby
Glass half empty I can't change I
Can't go all the way

Hеre we go, here we go
I'm gonna get burned, yeah
Yeah I know, yeah I know
I'm all used to hurt
Please don't go, please don't go, no
It's all in my head
I got blessings and lessons
But who's to say what's next

I need you baby damn I need you all the time
I can't seem to escape no
I can't get you off my mind
I'm pessimistic baby
Glass half empty I can't change I
Can't go all the way

I need you baby damn I need you all the time
I can't seem to escape no
I can't get you off my mind
I'm pessimistic baby
Glass half empty I can't change I
