		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm told that I should not have seen it
I know that I could not obey
Demons line up to fade out our colors
All around

There's not a fire that we're not feeding
There's not a bribe that we don't take
Leave it undone and take out our mother
In her own home

Seen from miles away
No one moved

How did we lead it this far 
When we knew it was dead from the start?
How can we still disregard 
When we know that we tore it apart?

Now the lions are defeated
Now the tyrants are embraced
Demons line up and waves are uncovered
And it is all done

Seen from miles away
No one moved

How did we lead it this far 
When we knew it was dead from the start?
How can we still disregard 
When we know that we tore it apart?
How did we lead it this far 
When we knew it was dead from the start?
If all we can feed on 
Is bred within greed then I'd rather I starve
