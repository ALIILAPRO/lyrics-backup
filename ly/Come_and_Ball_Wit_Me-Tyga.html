		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You should be calling me
Now you should be
Know it turns you on when I'm on the B
Put this jersey on, baby, ball

Now you should be calling me
Now you should be calling me, yeah
I know it turns you on when I'm on the B
Put this jersey on, baby, ball with me, yeah, yeah
You should be calling me
Now you should be calling me, yeah
Make a nigga honk his horn then that skrrt, beat, beat
Put this jersey on, baby, ball with me, yeah, yeah

They say you tripping, how you fall for me though?
My wrist dripping, I just spent a kilo
That Bugatti take off like my migo
I shoot my shot, then I reload
Ever seen two mil ride down pico?
Ever spent twenty bands on a peacoat?
I'm with my Blood niggas, getting what they bleed for
My Crip niggas getting cribs on the seashore
Give it all to me though
I have your wrist dripping, baby, move it free, yo
She'll have a rap nigga on his arm, be flow
Like come and talk to me 'cause we know

Now you should be calling me
Now you should be calling me, yeah
I know it turns you on when I'm on the B
Put this jersey on, baby, ball with me, yeah, yeah
You should be calling me
Now you should be calling me, yeah
Make a nigga honk his horn then that skrrt, beat, beat
Put this jersey on, baby, ball with me, yeah, yeah

What number do you wanna be?
I make you number one, yeah, one is all I need, yeah, yeah
They say you tripping, how you fall for me though?
Asking bitches why they always be alone
Tell them freaks to find a man of they own
We in MIA, M.I.A. though
Fast nights, I like to start my day slow
Take my time, count 100K up, oh, yeah
Now all this ice, how can I not keep my cool?
And with all this ice, I freeze time for you
And with all this ice, we skate straight to the top
Your body-ody's telling you

Now you should be calling me
Now you should be calling me, yeah
I know it turns you on when I'm on the B
Put this jersey on, baby, ball with me, yeah, yeah
You should be calling me
You should be calling me, yeah
Make a nigga honk his horn then that skrrt, beat, beat
Put this jersey on, baby, ball with me, yeah, yeah

Come and ball with me
I really wanna glow with you, girl
I really wanna show you things
I really wanna
Come and ball with me
I really wanna glow with you, girl
I really wanna show you things
I really wanna
