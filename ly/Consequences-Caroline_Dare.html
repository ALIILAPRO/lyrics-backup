		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I get home
From therapy once a week
Cause you kept on refusing to turn yourself in
To see somebody
I tell her
Everything about you
She says she thinks you inflicted all your issues on me
I don't know how you didn't hear yourself
Or get help
Cause down the line you ruined me
Without even trying
I would go back and change but I can't
I lost all of my friends
Just to sleep in your bed
All the things that I did
How it felt when you said
That it's all in my head
It's all in my head
I wanna die
At least once or twice a day
I used to be so healthy before you met me
But that changed
So I'll cry
While you move on with your day
It sucks that you got away with
Making me think that I was crazy
I don't know how you didn't hear yourself
Or get help
Cause down the line you ruined me
Without even trying
I would go back and change but I can't
I lost all of my friends
Just to sleep in your bed
All the things that I did
How it felt when you said
That it's all in my head
It's all in my head
When I look back all I see is red
You made me feel so insane
Thought you felt the same
All your little mistakes that you made
Now I'm facing the consequences
The consequences
Whoa oh oh oh (oh)
Whoa oh oh oh (oh)
Whoa oh oh oh (oh)
Whoa oh oh oh
I would go back and change but I can't
I lost all of my friends
Just to sleep in your bed
All the things that I did
How it felt when you said
That it's all in my head
It's all in my head
When I look back all I see is red
You made me feel so insane
Thought you felt the same
All your little mistakes that you made
Now I'm facing the consequences
The consequences
Whoa oh oh oh (oh)
Whoa oh oh oh (oh)
Whoa oh oh oh (oh)
Whoa oh oh oh
