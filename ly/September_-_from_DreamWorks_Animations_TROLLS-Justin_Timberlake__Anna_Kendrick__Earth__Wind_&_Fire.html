		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do you remember
The 21st night of September?
Love was changing the minds of pretenders
While chasing the clouds away

Our hearts were ringing
In the key that our souls were singing
As we danced in the night
Remember how the stars stole the night away

Ba de ya - say do you remember
Ba de ya - dancing in September
Ba de ya - never was a cloudy day

My thoughts are with you
Holding hands with your heart to see you
Only blue talk and love
Remember how we knew love was here to stay

Now December found the love we shared in September
Only blue talk and love
Remember, the true love we share today

Ba de ya - say do you remember
Ba de ya - dancing in September
Ba de ya - never was a cloudy day

Ba de ya - say do you remember
Ba de ya - dancing in September
Ba de ya - never was a cloudy day

The bell was ringing, aha
Our souls were singing
Do you remember
Never was a cloudy day

Ba de ya - say do you remember
Ba de ya - dancing in September
Ba de ya - never was a cloudy day
Ba de ya - say do you remember
Ba de ya - dancing in September
Ba de ya - never was a cloudy day

Break it down for me 
Say do you remember
Dancing in September

Ba de ya
Say do you remember
Do you remember?
Ba de ya - dancing in September (dancing in September)
Ba de ya - never was a cloudy day

Uh huh! (bring it back now)
Come on (bring it back now)
Dancing in September
Uh huh!
All the way down to the summer
