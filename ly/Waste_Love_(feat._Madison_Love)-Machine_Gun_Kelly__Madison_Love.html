		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Woke up and you wasn't next to me this mornin'
Saw a yellow cab drive you down the street on Broadway
Wish I could erase the mistakes that I made, I'm sorry
Wanted me to chase you inside, but the house too haunted

I tried to get away with the worst this time, you caught me
Tried to find a place for the words so I can say sorry
It's so shitty how I waste love, I know it's shitty how I waste love
Come home every night I'm wasted, wasted, wasted, wasted, wasted

It's gettin' hard to fake how I feel when your face still taunts me
I know it's hard to fake how you feel, do you not still want me?
How'd you run away from the place you brought me?
I did it to myself, though, go ahead and blame this on me

You tried to get away with the worst this time, I caught you
I tried to make you stay with my words, but this time I lost you
So shitty how you waste love (it's shitty how I waste love)
It's so shitty how you waste love (I know it's shitty how I waste love)
Get home every night you're wasted, wasted, wasted, wasted, wasted

Wait, I thought we were done, how'd you end up in my arms last night?
Fuck, I guess a little bit of pain kinda make it feel good sometimes
Why you try to run when I feel like you the one sometimes?
I guess a little bit of pain kinda make it feel good

You tried to get away with the worst this time, I caught you
(But this time, this time you caught me)
Tried to make you stay with my words, but this time I lost you
(This time, this time I lost you)
So shitty how you waste love (it's shitty how I waste love)
It's so shitty how you waste love (I know it's shitty how I waste love)
Get home every night you're wasted, wasted, wasted, wasted, wasted

I thought we were done, how'd you end up in my arms last night?
I guess a little bit of pain kinda make it feel good sometimes (kinda make it feel good)
Why you tryna run when I feel like you the one sometimes?
I guess a little bit of pain kinda make it feel good
