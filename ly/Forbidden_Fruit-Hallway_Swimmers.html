		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You don't know the feelings you brought out of me
Opened up the cage and set my spirit free
It was only once but I can tell
Just remembering the way it felt
In my head a dream in a dream

You were a forbidden fruit
And I had hungry eyes
Watching the way you move
Under the neon lights

You were a forbidden fruit
Somebody else's fight
But I still think of you
When I'm alone at night
When I'm alone at night
When I'm alone at night

Driving home
These images run through my mind (run through my mind)
Wishing I could go back to that place and time (that place and time)
To that fateful night when we first met
With the taste of you still on my lips
It was wrong but, oh, it felt so right

You were a forbidden fruit
And I had hungry eyes
Watching the way you move
Under the neon lights

You were a forbidden fruit
Somebody else's fight
But I still think of you
When I'm alone at night

You were a forbidden fruit
And I had hungry eyes
Watching the way you move
Under the neon lights

You were a forbidden fruit
Somebody else's fight
But I still think of you
When I'm alone at night

When I'm alone at night
When I'm alone at night
When I'm alone at night
When I'm alone at night

You were a forbidden fruit
And I had hungry eyes
Watching the way you move
Under the neon lights

You were a forbidden fruit
Somebody else's fight
But I so think of you
When I'm alone at night

When I'm alone at night
When I'm alone at night
