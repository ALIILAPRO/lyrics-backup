		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Is just a game
Oooh-ooooh
(You right it's just a game to me)

So Maria don't call me, eh-eh
I don't care that you are drunk
I know is just a game to you
When you just can't lose, oh yeah

(You right it's just a game to me)

Why I keep searching
I felay the numbers them working
I'm lurking, pull up to your spot where you working
I'm 'bout it, I bet that you love me in that outfit
The way that you fucking me before, I don't doubt it
The clout shit, you just really put up for that clout shit
I bet you looking at my page right now
You should feel ashamed right now
I want you to feel my pain right now

Imagine if we fucked right now
That shit would feel like drugs right now
The Henny getting to my brain right now
So I feel insane right now
I know you feel insane right now, yeah
But shit ain't got to change right now, yeah
Too much Henny on my, yeah
Too much Henny on my head right now

Don't give me that old love and hate
You can't replace you speak
'Cause I'm not buying it
And this ain't that deep
No we don't go way back
And you really don't need me (I really need you)

So Maria don't call me (oh)
I don't care that you are drunk (yeah, ja)
I know is just a game to you (I know)
When you just can't lose, oh yeah

(You right it's just a game to me)

So Maria don't call me (don't call me baby)
I don't care that you are drunk (oh Saint, oh Saint)
I know is just a game to you (I know it)
When you just can't lose, oh yeah
Go and have your fun
 
Without me
You said that you were better without me, mee
So why do you keep on calling, yeh, ouuh
If you said I was nothing, oooh
