		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey yo Sean, you Mister Kingston

Dutty dutty dutty love love
I'm feeling like you letting go
Dutty dutty dutty love love
I'm feeling like you letting go
Dutty dutty dutty love love
I'm feeling like you letting go (young money)
Dutty dutty dutty love love

Don't be scared girl, call on me
Cause me I want you for my eyes I'm a lover you see
And the way you a whine and the way you a g'wan
See the men a try to rush ya, like them bread on stop
But baby girl will you be mine
Let go, show your skin because you're one of a kind
And me na gon' lie, girl I must be in love
'Cause the way you a grind you have me caught up

Dutty dutty dutty love love
I'm feeling like you letting go
Dutty dutty dutty love love
I'm feeling like you letting go
Dutty dutty dutty love love
I'm feeling like you letting go
Dutty dutty dutty love love (whoa)

What if you would just come right out of these clothes
You can finally, feel the wind when it blows
Don't be scared to be free to let go, show it off
Feel like letting go
Oh oh oh oh

I'm here and and ya man not right
'Cause you need Sean King in your life, g'yal
King ah my name and my name can't change
Ya need fa' come over and unlink from with lames
Yo I feel like letting go
If you never know, baby now you know
Cause you're one of a kind, and you dress so fine
Like my diamond chain, you shine so bright, oh

Dutty dutty dutty love love
I'm feeling like you letting go
Dutty dutty dutty love love
I'm feeling like you letting go
Dutty dutty dutty love love
I'm feeling like you letting go
Dutty dutty dutty love love

What if you would just come right out of these clothes
You can finally, feel the wind when it blows
Don't be scared to be free to let go, show it off
Feel like letting go
Oh oh oh oh

Aye yo Sean, you Mister Kingston
You say you have it, Louie it, and then some
Look how you gwan on in all your ice
You pretty and you nice
You done know Nicki ah ya wife
But true say, I be up where you stay
I ain't like them other bitches that be actin' loosely
Know you gettin' hype, I know you wanna get up in it
But I just want to think about it for another minute
I think I like your style y'all
Why y'all, why don't we let go
Aye yo and I ain't gotta tell 'em
And I ain't gotta sell 'em
It's y-s-l daddy
I ain't gotta spell it
And yes, I killa kill 'em
I guess I am the villain
I park on the curb,
I'm the owner of the building, the building
Ya deaf?
Boy me soon left
Come get this playboy bunny like Hugh Heph, sigh
Rastafari'
Dutty dutty d-d-d-dutty

What if you would just come right out of these clothes
You can finally feel the wind when it blows
Don't be scared to be free to let go, show it off
Feel like letting go
Oh oh oh oh

Feel like letting go
Oh oh oh oh

Feel like letting go
Oh oh oh oh
