		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wonder if they see
That you don't belong to me
Wish that you would be mine
Mine, wish that you would be

I've been getting lost in translation
Trouble keeping up communication
We were having fun, now I can't wait to be done
It feels like I'm the only one that's sick of playing

Baby (baby), why you gotta keep me hanging?
It's like an apple of temptation, oh yeah
You let me get a bite, uh, out of sight, out of mind
Until I found a bruise on the other side

Time, oh
Do it to me one more

I've been getting lost in translation
Trouble keeping up communication
We were having fun, now I can't wait to be done
It feels like I'm the only one that's sick of playing

Sick, tired of people telling me, "Be patient"
Hey, trying to light the fire with no flame (no flame)
Uh, tying to figure out what you're saying to me
I wish I didn't need you to explain

Time, oh
Do it to me one more
Time, oh (do it to me, do it to me one more time)
Do it to me one more

I've been getting lost in translation
Trouble keepin' up communication
We were having fun, now I can't wait to be done
It feels like I'm the only one that's sick of playing

I've been getting lost in translation
Trouble keeping up communication
We were having fun, now I can't wait to be done
It feels like I'm the only one that's sick of playing

(Do it to me, do it to me one more time)
