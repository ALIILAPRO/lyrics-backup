		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dun, dun, dun
NLE the Top Shotta got bombs like Al-Qaeda
(Damn E, this shit exclusive) 
Ayy, ayy

Never send a threat on the internet just to prove a point
That dissin', don't get into that, we leavin' that to the informants
Don't inform me about who informin', that's yo' final warnin'
7.62's sting like a Bumblebee, he start transformin'
Send yo' homies on the drill, but they ain't never make it back
Shoot up the Scat, we left it flat, he died on the impact
My shooter he a gym rat, but never mentioned who he cracked
And put you on the news, and I bet his family viewed that

Slide by myself before I call a nigga
My fingernails dirty 'cause I'm still a gravedigger
And we ain't cappin' on wax, if we never pulled the trigger
And Goon steady puttin' Jimmy Glow up in his Swisher (Jimmy)
Never been the one to save the day, I'm the one clutchin' on the Drac'
Make sure he don't get away, a opp the only thing I chase
In a full race the back of his neck hit the ground to the K
Walk up to him, C Grape stood over, put one in his face
Murkin' what my soul say, I'm slidin' with this stowaway
My heater for a cold day
Leave a nigga in disarray (come here, come here, come here)
Better stay up in the house
Like the nigga from That's So Raven (come here, come here, come here, yeah)
Catch that nigga walkin' out (yeah, yeah)
We in the bushes, we been waitin' (ayy, ayy, ayy)

Never send a threat on the internet just to prove a point
That dissin', don't get into that, we leavin' that to the informants
Don't inform me about who informin', that's yo' final warnin'
7.62's sting like a Bumblebee, he start transformin'
Send yo' homies on the drill, but they ain't never make it back
Shoot up the Scat, we left it flat, he died on the impact
My shooter he a gym rat, but never mentioned who he cracked
And put you on the news, and I bet his family viewed that

Ayy, smilin' on my mugshot 'cause I know my bond money good
I ain't missed a heartbeat, I'm out the next day it's understood (bitch, it's understood)
To the Broward County Police, lick my nuts and suck my wood (tell 'em, "Suck my dick")
First day tray and nigga you start muggin', wish a nigga would
Doin' donuts in the SRT, I crashed into a tree (skrrt-skrrt, skrrt-skrrt)
Rolls truck the next week, money ain't been shit to me
Ridin' with a full clip, but the gas tank on E
Slidin' like a cruise ship, wet you up like a jet ski (come here, come here)
Livin' to a hundred and three, that's the OG Grape in me
Auntie wanna pray for me, better pray for my enemies
Life ain't gave me lemons so I start clutchin' the lemon squeeze
Had a AR F15, And two Glocks,.223's (like I'm George)

Never send a threat on the internet just to prove a point
That dissin', don't get into that, we leavin' that to the informants
Don't inform me about who informin', that's yo' final warnin'
7.62's sting like a Bumblebee, he start transformin'
Send yo' homies on the drill, but they ain't never make it back
Shoot up the Scat, we left it flat, he died on the impact
My shooter he a gym rat, but never mentioned who he cracked
And put you on the news, and I bet his family viewed that
