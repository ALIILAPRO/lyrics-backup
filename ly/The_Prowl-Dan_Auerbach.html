		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I see you walkin' after dark
Trading looks with other men
But I'm the only one you need
And I know just where you've been

Oh can't you see the tears I cried?
And soak them up like a towel
For now I'll be one step behind
Oh girl, you got me on the prowl
Oh girl, oh girl, oh girl

I crawl around most every night
And I'm all wrapped up in your spell
I wish someone would understand
But you know I could never tell

I'll just live on in the dark
If there's no harm, there's no foul
Well my love for you is strange
Oh girl, you got me on the prowl
Oh girl, oh girl, oh girl, yeah
