		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Coming out the grave
Just so we can bite back
Yeah we do this every day
Makin' way too many tracks
Makin' way too many hit's
Makin' way too many racks
And there ain't no damn stopping
Till they put us on the map
Coming out the grave
Just so we can bite back
Yeah we do this every day
Makin' way too many tracks
Makin' way too many hit's
Makin' way too many racks
And there ain't no damn stopping, till
They put us on the map, yuh

Hit 'em like Kratos, blade on my side
And we're coming at them swift
I be on the front line
It blinds when I strike
Gonna be a dead night
Murder everywhere I see, goddamn what a sight
Try to run up on us, burn 'em
Put the bodies in the furnace
If you see me, know I'm
Coming with the fire, make 'em nervous
I'm the lion, you the prey
Make 'em drown in the mud
I'm not sorry for my ways
I won't stop until it's done

Don't you dare touch me, stand back
No, noo!

Coming out the grave
Just so we can bite back
Yeah we do this every day
Makin' way too many tracks
Makin' way too many hit's
Makin' way too many racks
And there ain't no damn stopping
Till they put us on the map
Coming out the grave
Just so we can bite back
Yeah we do this every day
Makin' way too many tracks
Makin' way too many hit's
Makin' way too many racks
And there ain't no damn stopping
Till they put us on the map

I've been saying motherfuck the devil
Infernal levels
Get me out the vessel, before I settle
Jake Hill, Josh A, the new heavy metal
Yeah this shit's too hot, so bitch be careful
I'll be coming out the grave
And I'll be coming out my chains
Way too late for you to run
You better say it to my face
I don't really give a fuck bitch
I don't really hesitate
Keep the same energy when you
Talking to my blade, yuh

Don't you dare touch me, stand back
No, noo!

Coming out the grave
Just so we can bite back
Yeah we do this every day
Makin' way too many tracks
Makin' way too many hit's
Makin' way too many racks
And there ain't no damn stopping
Till they put us on the map
Coming out the grave
Just so we can bite back
Yeah we do this every day
Makin' way too many tracks
Makin' way too many hit's
Makin' way too many racks
And there ain't no damn stopping, till
They put us on the map, yuh
