		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, woo! Put your hands together for me
Mmm, feels good

Ain't no place, it ain't going on
It's going around like a vagabond
It gets in your bones like you caught the flu
Nah there ain't no cure
You just gotta move, when you feel the groove

Now people on the left
(everybody on the left shake)
Shake your south side people on the right
(everybody on the right shake)
Shake your south side
Every single girl (every single girl)
Shakе your south side
All around the world (all around the world)
Shakе your south side people on the left
(everybody on the left shake)
Shake your south side people on the right
(everybody on the right shake)
Shake your south side
Every single girl (every single girl)
Shake your south side
All around the world (all around the world)
Shake your south side people on the left
(everybody on the left shake)
Shake your south side people on the right
(everybody on the right shake)
Shake your south side
Every single girl (every single girl)
Shake your south side
All around the world (all around the world)
Shake your south side
