		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Home now, end of the night
And it's colder to turn on your side
And I know you are up in two hours
But we didn't get tonight, we don't have tomorrow
So don't ruin now

How we gonna move together?
Just come closer
If we don't move together
Come closer
How we gonna breathe? 
How we gonna be together?
Just keeping the peace between the sheets

And I creep in and everything's loud
And I'm sorry, I've woken you now
And we'll argue, the tiniest thing
But we didn't get tonight, don't have tomorrow
So I'm done whispering, done whispering

How we gonna move together?
Just come closer
If we don't move together
Just come closer
How we gonna breathe? 
How we gonna be together?
Just keeping the peace between the sheets

So maybe don't give me cold, cold shoulder
Before you go, turn around and let me hold you
And let me say in the dark of the morning
Just one more thing

How we gonna move together?
Come closer
If we don't move together
Come closer
How we gonna breathe? 
How we gonna be together?
Just keeping the peace
Just keeping the peace
Just keeping the peace between the sheets
