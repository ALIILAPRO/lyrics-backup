		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You there, you're better off here
You there, you're better off here
Funny it takes no time to fall back down
Funny it takes the time to get back up

You there, you're better off here
You there, you're better off here
Funny it takes no time to fall back down
Funny it takes the time to get back up

Uncover your eyes
Uncover your eyes
There's no sun, where is your direction?
Uncover your eyes
Uncover your eyes
Ask yourself, where is your reflection?

Uncover your eyes
Uncover your eyes
There's no sun, where is your direction?
Uncover your eyes
Uncover your eyes
Ask yourself, where is your reflection?
