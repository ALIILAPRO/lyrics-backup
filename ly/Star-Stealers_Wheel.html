		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So they've made you a star
Now your head's in a cloud
And you're walkin' down the street
With your feet are off the ground	

They read in the press all about your success
They believe every word they've been told
After all you've been through tell what will you do
When you find yourself out in the cold
Ah, tell me Ah, tell me

When you appear on the stage
There's a standing ovation
You really live out your performance
You're the biggest sensation

You breeze through the door and when you take the floor
You expect to have it all to yourself
After all you've been through tell me what will you do
When you find yourself back on the shelf
Ah, tell me Ah, tell me

You breeze though the door and when you take the floor
You expect to have it all to yourself
After all you've been through tell me what will you do
When you find yourself back on the shelf
Ah, tell me Ah, tell me
