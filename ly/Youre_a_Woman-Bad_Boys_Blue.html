		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're listening to KWPL coming at you with Bad Boys Blue
In the house
at this beautiful sunny day
Yeah check it out

You’re the only one I need
Tonight
Fill of right
Moon light shing bright
Let me hold you tight
In my arms
Your life
You’re the power of my love
Fly high
She’ll be polite
My love
You understand
Listen to the jam
Much more to the fan
I’ll cherish your love
Because I know I can

You’re the woman
I’m a man

You’re a woman
I’m a man
This is more than just a game
I can make you feel so right
Be my lady of the night

You’re a woman
(You’re a woman)
I‘m a man
(I‘m a man)
You’re my fortune
(You’re my fortune)
I’m your fame
(I’m your fame)
These are things we can’t disguise
Be my lady of the night

I love it when she touches
My chocolate skin
So people think it‘s wrong
But it’s not a sin
You make love all night
Over and over again
I’m not the big bad buff
So let me in
All I need is one track
Before I can jam
And if you line in my rime
You’re sure to understand
So spectacular
Because I know I can

You’re the woman
I’m a man

You’re a woman
I’m a man
This is more than just a game
I can make you feel so right
Be my lady of the night

You’re a woman
(You’re a woman)
I‘m a man
(I‘m a man)
You’re my fortune
(You’re my fortune)
I’m your fame
(I’m your fame)
These are things we can’t disguise
Be my lady

You're listening to KWPL coming at you with Bad Boys Blue
In the house
At this beautiful sunny day
Yeah check it out

You’re a woman
I’m a man
This is more than just a game
I can make you feel so right
Be my lady of the night

You’re a woman
(You’re a woman)
I‘m a man
(I‘m a man)
You’re my fortune
(You’re my fortune)
I’m your fame
(I’m your fame)
These are things we can’t disguise
Be my lady of the night
