		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You can choose
You can choose 
Not to be here
You can put an end to this
Unrestrained 
Unless you do
Unless you do
Take it on
I will have my time with your mind

You are mine

Close your eyes
Close your eyes
Close your eyes
Close your eyes

Close your eyes
Open your eye
Take it on
You are captured
You are free
Unrestrained 
Fall back to unknown
Take it on
Be rewarded
Be rewarded

You are mine

Take it on
Take it on
Take it on
Take it on
Take it on

I will have my time with your mind

You are mine

I know it's done and time is out
Come join me some other time
A white horse will take you home 
Protected by the red sun
You are mine
