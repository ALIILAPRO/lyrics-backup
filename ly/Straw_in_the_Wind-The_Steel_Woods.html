		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  He rode in from the west with an eye for a dollar to make
He pitched us a sale about healing and oil from a 
Snake
The barkeep, he warned him, but the man did not comprehend
How strangers 'round here disappear like 
Straw in the Wind

Too young, but in love when she met him in some Northern town
He treated her good till the sun and the whiskey went down
Did the bruise on her face test the patience of all of her kin?
Or do strangers 'round here disappear like
Straw in the Wind

Ol' Jim runs his mouth when he drinks since his wife passed away
But he's good to the kids, and the crops that he sells are fair trade
But a traveling man heard enough, and took a pipe to his chin
That traveling man disappeared like
Straw in the Wind

If the mouth of this river could talk, here's what it would say
"If you come here with good in your heart, you'll be on you're way
But I'm not the one here to judge another mans sin
Or make strangers 'round here disappear like
Straw in the Wind
