		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you got something to say
Then come my way
I'm guarded by Satan
I'm riding on Baphomet
I'll teach you a lesson in violence
You won't soon forget
The pleasure of watching you
Is what I will get

[Chorus]
Fight, for what you believe to be right,
Crushing with all your might
I laugh at their pitiful cries
They run from the fire in my eyes
Nothing can save them now
You've learned a lesson in violence
Get on your knees and bow
Or learn a lesson in violence

I love to stab my victims
Until they're dead
A knife to the throat
Or a smashing blow to the head
I'm judge and jury
My sentence has just been passed
Step into the circle of Hell
If you think you can last

[Chorus]
