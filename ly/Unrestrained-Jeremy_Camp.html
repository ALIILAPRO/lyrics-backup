		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Another day that is lost
A moment that I've cost
But I can feel Your arms of hope and grace

I'm holding on so dear
A promise You are near
Your loving kindness never fails

So take this selfish heart of mine
I want to give it all
I've wasted too much time
And melt away everything that's not of You

I want to know You more
So much deeper than I do
Completely unrestrained

I'll give my life away, every single day
A price to small for what You gave
I'm desperate for You
Shape my heart into the very image of what I'm to be

I'll give my life away, every single day
A price so small for what You gave

Another day that is lost
A moment that I've cost
But I can feel Your arms of hope and grace
