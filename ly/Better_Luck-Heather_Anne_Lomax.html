		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Got a rocket
In my back pocket
Full of wishes
Better luck next time
Better luck next time
Better luck next...time
Better luck next
Better luck next
Better luck next time

Keep on walkin'
Straight and narrow
Find your compass
Honey walk that line
Honey walk that line
Honey walk that...line
Honey walk that
Honey walk that
Honey walk that line

Oo oo oo oo
Oo oo oo oo 

Keep on movin'
Keep on groovin'
Dig outta that hole
Honey save your soul
Honey save your soul
Honey save your
Soul
Honey save your
Honey savior
Honey save your soul

Come on get up
Get outta that rut
Pick yourself up
It's your time to shine
      
Get outta my way
I'm not gonna play
Those foolish games
Leave it all behind
Leave it all behind
Find some peace of
Mind
Find your piece of
Find your piece of 
Find your peace of 
Mind
