		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I want to be alone with you
Definitely maybe
I feel worn out new
I'm an original copy
I'm a one-man band
I don't stand a chance
Clearly misunderstood
I guess I'll crash land
Now I can't hear cause your silence is too damn loud

Inside out
Outside in
What I thought I knew has got me more confused
You've done me in
Got me upside down
With your perfect imperfections there's no doubt
That I'm inside out

My head is in two
I hate that I love you
It's so sad that I'm happy for you
And I'd be lying if I said I'm telling the truth
Now what's left is right
What's right is wrong
My head is full of empty thoughts been nighttime all day long

Cause you got me

Inside out
Outside in
What I thought I knew has got me more confused
You've done me in
Got me upside down
With your perfect imperfections there's no doubt
That I'm inside out

I'm inside out
Yea I'm inside out

And oh
I'm a dead man walking
Oh
You got me running from the clock and now
Oh
You got me sleep talking
Oh you took my mind but I don't mind it's hard to find this kind of
Oh
I'm a dead man walking
Oh
So sick of running from the clock now
Oh
Don't want to be sleep talking
Please get out my head I should've said that I see red and now I'm

Inside out
Outside in
Should have ended this at the beginning

Inside out
Outside in
What I thought I knew has got me more confused
You've done me in
Got me upside down
With your perfect imperfections there's no doubt
That I'm inside out
