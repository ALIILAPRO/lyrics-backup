		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't believe this is where we are
You never listen
I never thought we could fall this far
I never listened

There's something I've been needing to say
I'm getting sick of the fights and the shots you take
It's chilling the words you choose
Now you're hiding when they're spit at you

I can't believe this is where we are
You never listen
I never thought we could fall this far
Won't change my mind
I'll never listen to you

Don't you know that you're a burden on me
You're a monster I thought that I'd never see
It's a feeling that I won't miss
Are you happy that it's come to this

I can't believe this is where we are
You never listen (I never listen to you)
I never thought we could fall this far
Won't change my mind
I'll never listen to
Won't listen to you anymore

I won't listen to you anymore
I won't listen to you anymore
I won't listen to you anymore (Why are you here)
I won't listen to you anymore (Get it through your head)

I can't believe this is where we are
You never listen

I can't believe this is where we are
You never listen (I never listen to you)
I never thought we could fall this far
Won't change my mind
I'll never listen to you

I can't believe this is where we are
You never listen (I never listen to you)
I never thought we could fall this far
Won't change my mind
I'll never listen to you

I won't listen to you anymore
I won't listen to you anymore
I won't listen to you anymore
I won't
Won't listen to you anymore
