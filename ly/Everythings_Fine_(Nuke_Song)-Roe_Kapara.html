		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The whole world's on fire
A private jet flies to bel air
All our food expired
But we'll feed the billionaires
They'll eat you till you're bare

I watch as the nukes explode and kill the neighbors kids
Rich men shoot out to space and watch us from their ships
Pretend like everything is fine, they'll make you take your pills
A gardener dies, the lakes run dry, you watch them drink their fill
They'll makе the youth salute the flag
Thеn start to murder mom and dad
We'll burry deep beneath the ground
The raid alarms begin to sound
You grab my shirt and hold it tight
I don’t know if we’ll survive

I watch as the nukes explode and kill the neighbors kids
Rich men shoot out to space and watch us from their ships

I watch as the nukes explode and kill the neighbors kids
Rich men shoot out to space and watch us from their ships
Pretend like everything is fine, they'll make you take your pills
A gardener dies, the lakes run dry, you watch them drink their fill
