		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And I'm a black rainbow
And I'm an ape of God
I got a face that's made for violence upon
And I'm a teen distortion
Survived abortion
A rebel from the waist down

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I wanna thank you mom
I wanna thank you dad
For bringing this fucking world
To a bitter end
I never really hated a one true god
But the God of the people I hated

You said you wanted evolution
The ape was a great big hit
You said you wanted revolution, man
And I say that you're full of shit

We're disposable teens
We're disposable teens
We're disposable teens
We're disposable
We're disposable teens
We're disposable teens
We're disposable teens
We're disposable

You said you wanted evolution
The ape with the great big hit
You said you wanted revolution, man
And I say that you're full of shit

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

The more that you fear us the bigger we get
The more that you fear us the bigger we get
And don't be surprised, don't be surprised
Don't be surprised when we destroy all of it

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

You said you wanted evolution
The ape was a great big hit
You said you wanted revolution, man
And I say that you're full of shit
Yeah yeah yeah
You said you wanted evolution
The ape was a great big hit
You said you wanted revolution, man
And I say that you're full of shit
Yeah yeah yeah

We're disposable teens
We're disposable teens
We're disposable teens
We're disposable
We're disposable teens
We're disposable teens
We're disposable teens
We're disposable
