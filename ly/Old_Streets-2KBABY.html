		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
Yeah, yeah

That's my brother
So if you crossin' him, you crossin' me
Fuck all these hoes, please get 'em off of me
We from the gutter
Every night we ate bologna meat
Bitch, watch your tone 'cause ain't no ho in me
They say I'm greedy
When I be only tryna feed the team
Somebody tell me who been feedin' me?
No, I ain't easy
Take all these drugs like I might OD
Game ain't the same, I miss the old streets

Man, I miss the old streets
These niggas lame, they gotta show me
They know my name, but they don't know me
Got all this pain, somebody hold me, yeah
So now I ball like Kobe, yeah
These niggas be so phony, yeah
They wanna be my homie, yeah
But I been grindin' by my lonely, yeah

Cold winters, cold killers, and cold dinners
My granny trippin', her grandson the dope dealer
My ho trippin', no pics, it's just business
Stop bitchin', get out your feelings, just roll with it
It's all sickenin', the bills hittin', my mom's missin'
Pops flippin', the time's tickin', the day's shiftin'
I can't fix it, move with it, just groove with it
Too smooth with it, I kept prayin', I'm God's gifted, yeah
Never change on my brothers, I'm not switchin'
Better not hang with no others, we not with it
All the opps takin' cover, got caught slippin'
Go spin they block with them cutters, we not missin'

Man, I miss the old streets
These niggas lame, they gotta show me
They know my name, but they don't know me
Got all this pain, somebody hold me, yeah
So now I ball like Kobe, yeah
These niggas be so phony, yeah
They wanna be my homie, yeah
But I been grindin' by my lonely, yeah
