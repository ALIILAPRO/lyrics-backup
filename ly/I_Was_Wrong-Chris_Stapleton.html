		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been thinking 'bout my thoughtless words
And I know just how much they must have hurt
And I take it back
Won't you let me take it back

You know I told you that I don't love you
That I'd be better off with someone new
But I take it back
Won't you let me take it back

Girl, you know that I still love you
And you know that I'm so alone
I don't know why
I told you that I didn't need you
Can't you see that, baby, I was wrong

What I wouldn't give to be your lover again
All I want to do is touch your skin, yeah
If I had you right here, right now
I'd tell you, tell you, tell you, tell you

Girl, you know that I still love you
And you know that I'm so alone
I don't know why
I told you that I didn't need you
Can't you see that, baby, I was wrong
