		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All I ever wanted was a new Ferrari 
Crash the car never say I'm sorry 
I just wanna make a couple hundred thousand
Put all my friends in one big house and 
Party like we're never gonna see tomorrow 
Honestly I'm hoping that I see tomorrow 
Now

And I 
Never ever wanna be 
(Never wanna be, never wanna be famous) 
(Wanna be, wanna be) 
And I 
Never ever wanna be 
(Never wanna be, never wanna be famous) 
(Wanna be, wanna be) 

All I ever wanted was to be a part in 
The TV show that you think you star in
All I ever wanted was a Maserati
Carpool karaoke with illuminati
Hunted down by the paparazzi
Front page magazine because we

Had an entourage and a limousine 
Burnout friends in an SUV

And I 
Never ever wanna be 
(Never wanna be, never wanna be famous) 
(Wanna be, wanna be) 
And I 
Never ever wanna be 
(Never wanna be, never wanna be famous) 
(Wanna be, wanna be)

Never had an intervention
But just know I'm never coming home 
And did I forget to mention 
When you call I'm wasting my time 
Standing in line 
Waiting for mine 
I'm losing my mind, I'm losing my mind
Wasting my time 
Standing in line 
Waiting for mine 
I'm losing my mind, oh

And I 
Never ever wanna be 
(Never wanna be, never wanna be famous) 
(Wanna be, wanna be) 
And I 
Never ever wanna be 
(Never wanna be, never wanna be famous) 
(Wanna be, wanna be)
