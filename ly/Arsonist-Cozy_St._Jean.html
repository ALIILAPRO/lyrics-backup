		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You put your reds out on me
How sweet of you
Burning churches to escape your Sunday blues
Oh
Raised by a Christian father
Set flares off in your head
Hot-tempered but you'd never touch me with intent
Still my body burns with dread

Baby you don't need no gloves
Throwing punches 'till you see nothing but blood
And I'm not scared of all your guns
All my fear stems from everything that I love

Exorcise me
I can't stop crying
One day I'll find you
I'll climb inside you
Scarification
Manipulation
We'll kill our keepers while they're sleeping in their beds

On hot nights when I'm dreaming
Whisper your southern lullaby
Eat away the charred skin all between my thighs
Oh

He'd wait patiently 'till I'd succumb
Muzzled like a rabid dog with foaming jaws
But I won't mind if you get rough
Now all I crave from love is sadism and snuff

Cut up my stomach
Strung like a puppet
I wanna die here
I cannot cry here
Scarification
And violations
You and I'll set fire to everything in sight
