		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All rush, living in the city 
Time lost, people getting twisted 
No jobs, for those who keep quitting 
Ask why, our lives are so different
Sunshine makes the gritty look pretty
Riding high, the world in my view

All we have is hope
A comfort of your home
All we have is hope
Who wants to live alone?

Choose to ride, live or die
Slave men
Who will survive, many will try
Escaping

Who's wrong believing in the secret
How long are the strong that can reach it?
I'm not a son of a preacher
Proud of a life as a teacher
Focused on the bigger picture
Young once, given the wisdom not the riches

All we have is hope
A comfort of your home
All we have is hope
Who wants to live alone?
All we have is hope
A comfort of your home
All we have is hope
Who wants to live alone?

Choose to ride, live or die
Slave men
Who will survive, many will try
Escaping
Choose to ride, live or die
Slave men
Who will survive, many will try
Escaping
