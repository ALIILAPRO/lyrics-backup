		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lately I've been afraid of myself
The closer that I get to rain
The more I feel at home, the further I'm away
And all that I feel is pain

Count me, count me, call my name
Don't leave me out the chain
Crimson tears falling and my shirt is blood-stained
And the devil's forever in my veins

And the devil's forever in my veins

The morning is across I've been, when I wake
Am I asleep? Have I broken my faith?
Down on my knees, can you hear me when I pray?
Or am I a little too late?

To count me, count me, call my name
Don't leave me out the chain
Crimson tears falling and my shirt is blood-stained
'Cause the devil's forever in my veins

'Cause the devil's forever in my veins

Count me, count me, call my name
Don't leave me out the chain
These Crimson tears falling and my shirt is blood-stained
And the devil's forever in my veins

The devil's forever in my veins
The devil's forever in my veins
