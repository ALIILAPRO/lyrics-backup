		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been goin' to the places where we used to meet before
'Cause lately I been feelin' so confused
We've gone our separate ways, I never see you face to face
But in my dreams, I'm always runnin' back to you

So tell me why I'm trippin' over lines drawn
Between you and I, I feel like such a fool
In my mind, I've tried so many times
To run away and hide from my memories with you

But when I close my eyes, you're there
Beside me on the beach, that night
And when you say goodbye, you're still on my mind
Gotta find a way to stop thinkin'
Even if you don't have feelings
My heart won't let go so easily
Wishful thoughts don't change the truth
So I don't know why I'm still in love with you

Wishful thoughts won't make it through
But I don't know why I'm still in love
With you
