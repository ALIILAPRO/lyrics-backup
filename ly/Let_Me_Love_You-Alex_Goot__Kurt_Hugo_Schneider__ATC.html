		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I used to believe we were burnin' on the
Edge of somethin' beautiful
Somethin' beautiful sellin' a dream
Smoke and mirrors keep us
Waitin' on a miracle on a miracle

Say, go through the darkest of days
Heaven's a heartbreak away
Never let you go, never let me down
Oh, it's been a hell of a ride
Driving the edge of a knife
Never let you go, never let me down

Don't you give up, nah, nah, nah
I won't give up, nah, nah, nah
Let me love you (Let me love you)
Let me love you (Let me love you)
Don't you give up, nah, nah, nah
I won't give up, nah, nah, nah
Let me love you (Let me love you)
Let me love you

Don't fall asleep at the wheel
We've got a million miles ahead of us
Miles ahead of us all that we need
Is a rude awakening to
Know we're good enough
Know we're good enough

Say, go through the darkest of days
Heaven's a heartbreak away
Never let you go, never let me down
Oh, it's been a hell of a ride
Driving the edge of a knife
Never let you go, never let me down

Don't you give up, nah, nah, nah
I won't give up, nah, nah, nah
Let me love you (Let me love you)
Let me love you (Let me love you)
Don't you give up, nah, nah, nah
I won't give up, nah, nah, nah
Let me love you (Let me love you)
Let me love you

Never let you go never let you go, now
Never let you go never let you go, now
Never let you go never let you go, now

Don't you give up, nah, nah, nah
I won't give up, nah, nah, nah
Let me love you let me love you
Don't you give up, nah, nah, nah
I won't give up, nah, nah, nah
Let me love you (Let me love you)
Let me love you
