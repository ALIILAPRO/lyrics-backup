		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A slow strangle with my feet on the floor.
I've got 14 angels and I'm sleeping alone,
In the back of the cave, where the rest of us go to feel normal.

I call baby up, leave me alone.
I'm in pain but I won't let you band-aid my wound.
I'm not at a stage where I can't seem handle my own.

[Chorus]
Give me a quiet mind and I...
I love you.
You give me a quiet mind and I...
I'll love you...
Until the end

Give me the strength to be kind, to combine,
All the good things in life that are so hard to find.
But I have and I won't let them go like I do with my friends.

Still hearing voices, from front, from behind
They're the reason I choose...When to live...How to die
When to cast...When to reel
When to buy...When to steal
When to fiend for the friends that taught you being inappropriate will

[Chorus: x 2]
