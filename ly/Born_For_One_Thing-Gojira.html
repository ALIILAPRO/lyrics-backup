		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mortal, spawn on the altar 
Caught in the heart of the blaze 
The primal fear of disappearing 
Becoming a ghost in the void 
Death

Give a price, put a name 
None of it real in this matter 
Wandering, distracting
Wishing the life of another self

We were born for one thing
Tame the greatest fear of all
We were born for one thing
Born to face the greatest fear of all

We're all drawn into ourselves
In a collective coma
Remember gazing up for answers 
But now we're staring down
Down
Down
Down

All is blur in the maze we put an end to all
All is blur in the maze we put an end to all

We were born for one thing
Tame the greatest fear of all
We were born for one thing
Born to face the greatest fear of all

No one 
United
When we're gone
