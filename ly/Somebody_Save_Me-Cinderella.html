		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I was a young boy
They said, "You're only gettin' older"
But how was I to know then
That they'd be cryin' on my shoulder

Put your money in a big house
Get yourself a pretty wife
She'll collect your life insurance
When she connects you with a knife

Somebody get the doctor
I'm feelin' pretty poor
Somebody get the stretcher
Before I hit the floor

Somebody save me
I lost my job, they kicked me out of my tree
Somebody save me
Save me

Well, everybody's got opinions
But nobody's got the answers
And that shit you ate for breakfast
Well, it'll only give you cancer

We're runnin' in a circle
Runnin' to the morning light
And if ya ain't quite workable
It's been one hell of a night

Somebody get the doctor
I think I'm gonna crash
Never paid the bill
Because I ain't got the cash

Somebody save me
I lost my job, they kicked me out of my tree
Somebody save me
Save me
Look out

Save me
I lost my job, they kicked me out of my tree
Somebody save me, oh
Save me

Somebody save me
I'm goin' down for the last time, look out
Save me
Save me
Save me
