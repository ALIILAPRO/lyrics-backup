		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Your daddy drank himself half to death
When he was thirty-nine years old
But I hope you don't think I feel like a father to you
But I want to tell you I miss you so much, you're a thousand miles away
I'm at the wheel of my car and I'm coming on home to you, yeah

Lonely hearts, they're not made to break
I got no spare parts, got no oil to change

Honey, I ain't accustomed to lose
If I want something bad enough, I always find a way to get through
If I want something bad enough, I always find a way to get through

I take the 10 to Phoenix, be in Tucson by the afternoon
Get some shut eye in Benson and a bite at the greasy spoon
Took a turn off 90, I should have stayed on the interstate
I was lost in the real, my map was kind of out of date

I saw the lights of Marfa, I guess it was a scenic route
When I had to change a tire, I'm glad I wore my western boots

Lonely hearts, they're not made to break
I got no spare parts, got no oil to change

Honey, I ain't accustomed to lose
If I want something bad enough, I always find a way to get through
Honey, I ain't accustomed to lose
If I want something bad enough, I always find a way to get through, yeah
If I want something bad enough, I always find a way to get through, yes

When I got to Sonora, the sun was shining in my eyes
With the air-con busted, the windshield full of flies
And in just a few hours, you're going to fall in my loving arms
I've been so hot to see you, I set off the fire alarms, yeah

Lonely hearts, they're not made to break
I got no spare parts, got no oil to change

Honey, I ain't accustomed to lose
If I want something bad enough, I always find a way to get through
If I want something bad enough, I always find a way to get it, baby
If I want something bad enough, I always find a way to get through
If I want something bad enough, I always find a way to get through, yeah

Lonely hearts, they're not made to break
I got no oil to change, yeah
Lonely hearts, they're not made to break
I got no spare parts, got no oil to change
