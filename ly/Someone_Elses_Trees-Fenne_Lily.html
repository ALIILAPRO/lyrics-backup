		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We say alright 
You need an OK 
All the same 
You don't belong with them 
And still you stay if I could say 
When you were small 
That you would grow to be so bold 
Don't pray 
Turn away

I flew in over clouds that couldn't catch me if I fell 
And I told them I would call but there isn't much to tell 
'Cause I'm always scared of leaving and then when I arrive 
I'm distracted by existences now parallel to mine

I'm not afraid to die more so to be alive 
I know in this and more I'm not alone 
And I never heard you scream before the night I couldn't breathe 
You tell me now you thought that I was gone 
You thought that I was gone 
You thought that I was gone 
I was five and I was gone

She's sitting down beside me 
I'm turning down my page 
But it's silently decided that I'll stay
I'm hers until the sun comes up on someone else's trees 
When I'm clean I'll move along

I'm not afraid to die more so to be alive 
I know in this and more I'm not alone 
And I never heard you scream before the night I couldn't breathe 
You tell me now you thought that I was gone 
You thought that I was gone 
You thought that I was gone 
Sometimes I wish I'd gone

Please don't be long 
Don't let this go on and on 
Please don't stay in me

Please don't be long 
Don't let this go on and on
