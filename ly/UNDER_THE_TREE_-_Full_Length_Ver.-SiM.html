		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Where are you at?
Where have you been?
問いかけに答えはなく
Where are we headed?
What did you mean?
追いかけても 遅く 遠く

A bird, a butterfly and my red scarf
Don't make a mess of memories
Just let me heal your scars
The wall, the owl, forgotten wharf
時が止まることもなく
We're getting older second by second by second

Why, oh why, why, oh why
Don't you wanna stay with me?
Why, oh why, why, oh why
Are you giving up on me?
I'll be waiting, waiting for you
Let me hold you under the tree
Under the tree
Ee-ee-ee
Ee-ee-ee-ee
I'll protect you

Why were you crying?
What are you dying for?
Your dream, did it satisfy or terrify?

Annoying pain in my head
The things left unsaid
I'm sorry that we had been relying on you too much to be free

Why, oh why, why, oh why
Don't you wanna stay with me?
Why, oh why, why, oh why
Are you giving up on me?

"I'm here, so we don't need to talk"
"I'm here, so we don't need to talk"
"I'm here, so we don't need to talk"
"I'm here to tell you there's no need to talk"

"You're free"

This is already enough
We'll figure out the rest
Let me shoulder your sins together with you
People may not call it love
And we won't be blessed
But let me shoulder your sins together (for you)

If I lose it all

I'll be waiting, waiting for you
Let me hold you under the tree
Under the tree
Ee-ee-ee
Ee-ee-ee-ee
I'll protect you
