		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know, I know what's on your mind
And I know it gets tough sometimes.
But you can give it one more try to find another reason why,
You should pick it up and try it again
â??Cause it's all right - I think we're gonna make it,
I think it might just work out this time.
It's all right - I think we're gonna make it
I think it might work out fine this time
It's all right - I think we're gonna make it
I think it might just work out,
â??cause it's not too late for that too late for me.

I know I've been hurt before
And I know I really shouldn't give any more.
But this time, this time things seem just a little different.
And when I look in your eyes, you know I can see that it's true.
And I hear you say:

It's all right I think we're gonna make it,
I think it might just work out this time.
It's all right I think we're gonna make it
I think it might work out fine this time
It's all right I think we're gonna make it
I think it might just work out,
â??Cause it's not too late for that too late for me.

Just when you feel helpless, nothing left to say.
Love will find us. The past behind us then we're on our way.

Time and time again I see people so unsure like me,
We all know it gets heard sometimes You can give it one more try,
Find another reason why you should pick it up,
You should kick it up and try it again.

â??Cause it's all right I think we're gonna make it,
I think it might just work out this time.
It's all right I think we're gonna make it
I think it might work out fine this time
It's all right I think we're gonna make it
I think it might just work out,
â??Cause it's not too late for that too late for me.
