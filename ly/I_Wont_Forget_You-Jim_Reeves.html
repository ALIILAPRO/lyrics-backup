		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know that I won't forget you
For I've loved you too much for too long
Though you don't want me now
I'll still love you
Till the breath in my body is gone

That's how it is with me
And you'll always be
The only love I ever knew
I'll forget many things in my lifetime
But my darling, I won't forget you

That's how it is with me
And you'll always be
The only love I ever knew
I'll forget many things in my life time
But darling, I won't forget you
