		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been bruised and broken
I've been torn in fuckin' two
I've been working and running
Then I have to run home to you

And I'm not living in your life
And you're not living in mine
We've been getting it wrong forever
We'll get it right this time
And live in the High Life

You're a thief, you're a shit thief
You're always getting caught
I'm a bitch but I'm your bitch
And I'm all you've fucking got

And I'm not living in your life
And you're not living in mine
We all get what we've been given
But we're not gonna give up tryin'

To live in the High Life
Living in our High Life
We're up on the High Life
And it's a fine night to feel alive
Living in the High Life
Living in our High Life
We're up on the High Life
And it's a fine night to feel alive

This song's a love song
It's not an apology
But sometimes I hate you
Reminding me of me

Woman, guess we're cut from the same cloth
Fourteen years in the same block 
Nine long months in your belly 
Down to the Coombe and I still wasn't ready 
Three days late I arrived at the party 
Smile on me face 
You're welcome me hearty 
Back to the gaff in the liberties 
Christening party up with the knees. 
Girl, we're cut from the same cloth
All you feel, I feel the same loss 
I see your eyes in the mirror 
Saint, angel, devil, sinner
Still laughin' at life with our fists up
Still getting our tea down the chip shop
Still tough, tongues sharp as a flick knife
Still here, still living the high life

And I'm not living in your life
And you're not living in mine
And this song's for all you Mothers
We're all gonna be just fine

We're living the High Life
Living in our High Life
We're up on the High Life
And it's a fine night to feel alive
We're living the High Life
Living in our High Life
We're up on the High Life
And it's a fine night to feel alive
Living the High Life
Living the High Life Whoo!
Living in our High Life
We're up on the High Life
Max!?
And it's a fine night to feel alive
And it's a fine night to feel alive!
Living the High Life
Top o' the World Ma! Hahaha.
Living in our High Life
We're up on the High Life
And it's a fine night to feel alive
Living the High Life
Living the High Life
We're up on the High Life
