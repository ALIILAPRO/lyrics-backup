		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Should've quit you early on
They said don't ever fall in love
How did I not see what's wrong
In the end I'm still alone
Got the feeling that you know
How it hurts me when you stare
I really hope this feeling goes
Hate that I still even care.
Nothing happened as expected
You don't get it
(Guess we're too different)
Blinded by what could've been
I really tried but I'll give in
I grew up too fast now I don't know what love is
Still see you in crowds
Guess it's over now
Hate me now, I hate me now
Will I ever learn that love will only hurt
