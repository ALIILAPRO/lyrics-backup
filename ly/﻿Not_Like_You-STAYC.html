		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Talk to me, talk to me, blah, blah, blah
So tell me what you want from me (from me)
어쩜 난 뻔뻔해, 뻔뻔해 but I like it
I want you to respect me
다른 건 나, 틀린 건 너
보고 싶은 대로 보는 건 so wrong
차라리 솔직히, 솔직히 말해줘
So it's a kind of jealousy (yeah, yeah, yeah)

그 누구도 can't live forever
So 원하는 게 생기면 쫓아 난 never, ever
그래 I never give up 이건 내 자존심인 걸 (I like that)
눈치 보고 살고 싶지 않아
눈치 없는 type도 아냐 big ego in me (me)
I'm telling the world so
Can't you hear me? Di-di, di-di, di-di

Talkin' to myself, yeah
I'm so proud of you
감추지 않아 I'm good (I'm good)

So that's why I'm not like you (ayy)
That, that's why I'm not like you (you, you, you, you, you, you)
That, that's why I'm not like you (ayy)
That, that's why I'm not like you (you, you, you, you, you, you)
So that's why I'm not like you

Lodi-dodi, we like to party
Simple 한 것보다는 I'm so busy
그래 I enjoy my life 이건 내 policy인 걸 (that's the policy)
조마조마 내 맘 알아줄까?
주저하는 type도 아냐 big ego in me (me)
I'm telling the world so
Can't you hear me? Di-di, di-di, di-di

Talkin' to myself, yeah
I'm so proud of you (oh)
감추지 않아 I'm good (I'm good)

So that's why I'm not like you (ayy)
That, that's why I'm not like you (you, you, you, you, you, you)
That, that's why I'm not like you (ayy)
That, that's why I'm not like you (you, you, you, you, you, you)
So that's why I'm not like you

That's na-na-na, you can never hold me down, oh (no, no)
That's na-na-na 누가 뭐래도 my life, oh
That's na-na-na, you can never hold me down, oh (no, no)
정해진 건 없지 so there's no answer, right? (ooh)

Talk to me, talk to me, blah, blah, blah
So tell me what you want from me (from me)
어쩜 난 뻔뻔해, 뻔뻔해 but I like it
I want you to respect me (want you to respect me)
Talk to me, talk to me, blah, blah, blah
So tell me what you want from me (ooh)
어쩜 난 뻔뻔해, 뻔뻔해 but I like it (like it)
I want you to respect me
