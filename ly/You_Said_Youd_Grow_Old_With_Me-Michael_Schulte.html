		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'd like to say, "I'm okay", but I'm not
I try, but I fall
Close my mind, turn it off

But I can't be sober, I cannot sleep
You've got your peace now, but what about me?

Thought we had the time, had our lives
Now you'll never get older, older
Didn't say goodbye, now I'm frozen in time
Getting colder, colder

One last word
One last moment
To ask you why
You left me here behind
You said you'd grow old with me

We had plans, we had visions, now I can't see ahead
We were one, we were golden, forever, you said

But I can't be sober, I cannot sleep
You've got your peace now, but what about me?

Thought we had the time, had our lives
Now you'll never get older, older
Didn't say goodbye, now I'm frozen in time
Getting colder, colder

One last word
One last moment
To ask you why
You left me here behind
You said you'd grow old with me, oh

Thought we had the time, had our lives
Now you'll never get older, older
Didn't say goodbye, now I'm frozen in time
Getting colder, colder

Just one last word
One last moment
To ask you why
You left me here behind
You said you'd grow old with me
