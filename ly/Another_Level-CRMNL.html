		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One by one I bring them to their knees
It's so much fun to watch em run from me
Blowin' through the red lights
Creepin' round late night
I'm letting out the monster underneath
 
Gonna take it to another level
Burn a little brighter
Take it to another level
Turn it up higher
You can't slow me down
Can't slow me down
Take it to another level
 
You'll know I'm here when you fear for your life
Kiss the ring, you know I don't play nice
As soon as I'm all in
The city starts falling
I'm letting out the monster deep inside
 
Gonna take it to another level
Burn a little brighter
Take it to another level
Turn it up higher
You can't slow me down
Can't slow me down
Take it to another level
 
Never gonna steal my crown
Never never never
Never gonna hold me down
Never never
 
Gonna take it to another level
Burn a little brighter
Take it to another level
Turn it up higher
You can't slow me down
Can't slow me down
Take it to another level
