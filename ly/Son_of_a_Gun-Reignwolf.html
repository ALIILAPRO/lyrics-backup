		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Some of us go our ways
Some of us don't go far
All the while look for something else
And no matter what you did

Something
You don't know how it feels baby
Son of a gun
Darling he's wearing my down
Oh he's wearing me down
Well overgrown but was the only one
Before you know it you're everyone else

Something
You don't know how it feels baby
What are we doing?
We're disappearing
God get me out of this town
Son of a gun
Son of a gun

(Ooh)

What are we doing?
We're disappearing
God get me out of this town
There's something out there
Made up of somewhere
Don't leave me off where I'll never be found
Get me out of this town
Son of a gun
