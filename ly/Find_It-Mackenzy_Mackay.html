		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Intro:

You know where to find me
Still in one piece
If I’m indecisive can’t make up my mind
Yet
Come and Give me guidance
We can find peace

You can help me find it
You can help me find it

You know where to find me still in one piece
Help me break the silence, we can break free
From the every day life shit,
leave it all behind yeah

I can help you find it
I can help you find it

Verse 1:

Fuck knows what the time is we don’t keep track
We don’t keep an eye on it
Divide this love between us cut it with a knife and then
Ill reach full potential I’ve met you I wanna let you in
Take you ocean and go where no one has ever been

Pre Chorus:

You’re the one I run too
When it gets too much you come through

Chorus:

You know where to find me
Still in one piece
If I’m indecisive can’t make up my mind
Yet
Come and Give me guidance
We can find peace

You can help me find it
You can help me find it

You know where to find me still in one piece
Help me break the silence, we can break free
From the every day life shit,
leave it all behind yeah

I can help you find it
I can help you find it

Verse 2:

I don’t wanna say that’s easy
And I Wanna say what the fuck I’m feeling
Fell in so quick too quick never leaving
Wanna get her round call her up this evening

Want to find your heart and steal it
But it’s mad difficult I’m dealing
Fell in so damn fast and I mean this
Treat me like that feeling like you’re the realest

Bad with the teasing
Heart full of scars
Tried with the healing
I’m falling apart
So fucking easy
To fall in again and I’m falling in heavy
I’m falling in hard

for you what you’re doing it’s eating me up
And Its digging a hole in my head

U make it to easy to fall in again and again and again

Pre Chorus:

You’re the one I run too 
When it gets too much you come through

Chorus:

You know where to find me
Still in one piece
If I’m indecisive can’t make up my mind
Yet
Come and Give me guidance
We can find peace

You can help me find it
You can help me find it

You know where to find me still in one piece
Help me break the silence, we can break free
From the every day life shit,
leave it all behind yeah

I can help you find it
I can help you find it

Bridge:

Spend my nights falling over
You’re who I call
You’re the one I run too
Tell me when the night ends tell me when it’s done
When it gets too much you come through

Spend my nights falling over
You’re who I call
You’re the one I run too
Tell me when the night ends tell me when it’s done
When it gets too much you come through

Outro:

You know where to find me
Still in one piece
If I’m indecisive can’t make up my mind
Yet
Come and Give me guidance
We can find peace

You can help me find it
You can help me find it

You know where to find me still in one piece
Help me break the silence, we can break free
From the every day life shit,
leave it all behind yea

I can help you find it
I can help you find it
