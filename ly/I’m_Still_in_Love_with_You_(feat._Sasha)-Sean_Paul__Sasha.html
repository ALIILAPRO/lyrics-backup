		  Well, in come di ting dem call a broken heart
Dis blessed love will neva part, you done know it from da start
Me tell dem seh a dutty eh
Ah Sean Paul and Sasha, come sing fi dem, baby

Though you make me holler, though you make me sweat
I can't get your tenderness
Still I can't get you off my mind
What is it about you, baby?

Ah just the dutty, dutty love

I'm still in love with you, boy
Well, I'm a hustler an' a player (oh, yeah)
And you know, I'm not a stayer
Dat's the dutty, dutty love
I'm still in love with you, boy
So, girly, try to understand
Dat a man is just a man
Dat's the dutty, dutty love
I'm still in love with you, boy
Blessed loving from the start
But you know we had to part
Dat's the way I give my love

I'm still in love
Yes, I'm still in love with you
But a man gotta do what a man gotta do

Girl
Well, I never had fi promise you no bling bling fi hold you, girl
Well, ah just the loving weh me fling, fling control you, girl
And ah make your head swirl
And ah make your body twirl
And ah make you wanna be my one and only baby girl
Night after night, me give you love fi keep you warm
Gyal, you never get this kinda loving from yuh born
And now you wan' draw card, say me just can't perform

But a man gotta do what a man gotta do, girl

Hey
Ah true me give her thug love and say, "Bye, bye, bye"
Me turn around, she ask the question, "Why?, Why?, why?"
When me leaving, me see the gyal ah cry, cry, cry
And it hurts my heart fi tell a lie, lie, lie
So don't cry no more
Baby girl, for sure
