		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It won't let you down easy
It'll let you down with lead weights pulling either side
And as you fall under
You'll be fighting for breath with all you've got
As you fall and you flounder
Calling for help won't help you none
You sink into the song
Like a fire drowning in a setting sun

You wanna know what it is?
Love taught me what loneliness is
It taught me how to forgive what
No one should make you ever really have to forgive
And we all fall behind, from time to time
And say, I thought that I was over all of this

If I should call your name
Would you hear me out at all?
If I should call your name
Would you hear me out at all?

As the waves turn to thunder
You look for a rock that could hold you up
And as you get close
You realize that you're all that rock has got

Do you wanna know what it is?
Love taught me what loneliness is
It taught me how to forgive what
No one should make you ever really have to forgive
And we all fall behind, from time to time
And say, I thought that I was over all of this

You wanna know what it is?
Love taught me what loneliness is
It taught me how to forgive what
No one should make you ever really have to forgive
And we all fall behind, from time to time
And say, I thought that I was over all of this
And it is what it is

Love taught me what loneliness is
It taught me how to forgive what
No one should make you ever really have to forgive
And we all fall behind, from time to time
And say, I thought that I was over this shit
But I'm not

If I should call your name
Would you hear me out at all?
