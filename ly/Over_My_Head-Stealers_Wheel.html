		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We sat up talking right on through the night
And the day had just begun
Then you said let's take a walk outside
And watch the rising of the sun

And over my head there was so much to see in the sky
Just that feeling of being alive
Don't let it go, don't let it slip away

We stood around until the sky was clear
And it was time for you to go
I watched your figure slowly disappear
As you walked off down the road

And over my head there was so much to see in the sky
Just that feeling of being alive
Don't let it go, don't let it slip away

Don't let it go, don't let it slip away
Don't let it go, don't let it slip away
Don't let it go, don't let it slip away
