		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You gave me love
I gave you up
I wasn't right but you did no wrong

You gave me trust
I gave you lust
Wasn't enough but we moved along

Tell me it's alright
Tell me you'll be fine
I hope you understand
I never had a plan

Tell me it's alright
Tell me you'll be fine
I hope you understand
I never had a plan

So I had to run run run away
Tried to tell you, you should run run run away
It's only human that we run run run away
Run away from me
You should run away from me

I'm sorry we broke
Sorry you bled
Sorry my love was better left unsaid
Sorry I drank
I knew we'd sink
It's noone's fault but I made this bed

Tell me it's alright
Tell me you'll be fine
I hope you understand I never had a plan

So I had to run run run away
Tried to tell you, you should run run run away
It's only human that we run run run away
Tried to tell you, you should run run run away
It's only human that we run run run away
Tried to tell you, you should run run run away

Run away from me
You should run away from me
Run away from me
You should run away from me

Run 
Run
Run away from me
