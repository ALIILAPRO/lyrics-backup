		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is a love song, real love
Dirty rip out the whole of your soul love
I'll hate myself for days love
Sitting all alone and listening to Nick Cave love

This is a dark song, real dark
Feral tear off your skin to the bone dark
I'll drink myself to death dark
Do anything to feel your breath on my neck dark

Can I sing this to you?
Got a thing about you
It won't go away, no
It won't go away
It won't go away

And this is a sad song, so sad
Aching like it's more that I can take sad
I cried so hard I died sad
Losing all that's making me human inside sad

Can I sing this to you?
Got a thing about you
And it won't go away, no
It won't go away
It won't go away

This is a love song, so what?
Did it slide into your heart?
I guess not
I still want your love a whole lot
Have you heard a better song?
I hope not

Can I sing this to you?
Got a thing about you
And it won't go away
It won't go away
And I just come to say
That it won't go away
It won't go away
