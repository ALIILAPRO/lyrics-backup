		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I believe submarines
Underneath deep blue seas
Saw the flags, Japanese
No one will believe me

Ran back to the town bar and
I told the people how
I had seen a submarine
And everyone laughed aloud

I did spy a periscope
Dead of night on the eastern coast
The police made them jokes
Told me I'd seen a ghost

Everyone thinks I'm a liar
No one knows the truth
If it was a bigger fire
I would be on the roof

Ships will rust in Baldwin Bay
(Let me go)
No one trusts what I say
(I don't know)
Oh my God, no one paid
(Attention)
Overnight my hair turned gray
(Oh oh oh)

In the end, it boils down to credibility
I had none, so I will die with the secrets of the sea

(Submarine)
(Can't find me)
Submarine, hey

(Submarine)
