		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I will never reason with myself in your defense
Or try to see your twisted point of view
The judge and the jury already let the gavel fall
Court is out, there's nothing I can do
And it is not a question of belief on your behalf
I think it is your word that bleeds the doubt
And like a wound that never feels, infected from within
I won't survive if I don't bleed you out

You wear me out and hold me back
I don't want to be tied down
I'm not done fighting yet
I know I've gotta move on, move on
No, I'm not done fighting yet

Cable cords and metaphors can't make a person care
The intervention I was praying for
Regardless of some clever words I write in my despair
I notice you're not listening anymore

You wear me out and hold me back
I don't want to be tied down
I'm not done fighting yet
I know I've gotta move on, move on
No, I'm not done fighting yet

No, I won't let myself forget
Oh, the fucked up things we did

No, you wear me out and hold me back
I don't want to live that way
And I don't want to be like that
I know I've gotta move on, move on
No, I'm not done fighting yet

No, I'm done fighting
I'm not done fighting yet
