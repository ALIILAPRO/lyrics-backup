		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I want two right here that look like vampire teeth
I just wanna be a vampire, you know what I mean?
I feel like I already am a vampire

Suckin' all this blood, no time for talkin'
Have you ever seen a real life ghoul or goblin?
Payday in this bitch, got all heads bobbin'
Enchanted by the rhythm, yeah, keep on noddin'
I will, I will, I will, I will dismember any emcee dissin' me
My girl keep kissin' me while I be makin' history (mwuah)
Made a lot of hits to be here but they still dissin' me

I'm a vampire and I just might bite ya
I'm a vampire and I just might bite ya
I'm a vampire and I just might bite ya
I'm a vampire and I just might bite ya

Listen up, puta, need my money ahora
Shock, shock, horror, I can read your aura
Headin' to the top, watch me buildin' from the floor up
Vampire gang, chain swang on the tour bus
I be with my jits but I ain't comin' from Florida
Flow so dirty but my rhyme scheme clean
Hoes so flirty but they ain't fo' me
'Cause I keep it ten toes, I'm a blood bank fiend
And my whole team mean, yeah, my whole team mean

I'm a vampire and I just might bite ya
I'm a vampire and I just might bite ya
I'm a vampire and I just might bite ya
I'm a vampire and I just might bite ya

We hide under the moonlight, hungover afternoon time
Victims in the castle, snatched up out they suit and tie
Bloodthirsty, fresh out the tomb, yeah, they doomed
If we ever cross paths, then your soul, you will lose
No rules, yeah, we do what we choose
Never dying in pits of hell frying (yeah)
Defying gravity, living in the clouds
Fang hang, drippin' blood on my teeth when I smile
All horror in my aura, we be running the score up
Got 'em biting all the verses but they die by the chorus
What we do in the shadows, it's a matter of time
'Til I'm getting that neck, then your soul is mine
Gotta aim for your heart if you're playing the part
Everything come to light, what we do in the dark
Gotta aim for your heart if you're playing the part
Everything come to light, what we do in the dark (go)

I'm a vampire and I just might bite ya
I'm a vampire and I just might bite ya
I'm a vampire and I just might bite ya
I'm a vampire and I just might bite ya

Vampire
