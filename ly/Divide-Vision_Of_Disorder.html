		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Divide - Street force
We were the ones to win
You are the grateful
Street force will win the wars
Show us the way
We were the ones to lose
You were the spiteful
We shall never fall
Show us the way
We shall never fall
Street force will win the wars
No more patience
You are the fortunate
Divide - Street force
We were the ones to protect
Show us the way
You are the ignorant
You were the ones to spit
We shall never fall
Divide - Street force
