		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Woah-oh-oh
(Don't let your momma know)

You can have the sex with me
(Woah-oh-oh)
Money back guarantee
(Woah-oh-oh)
We can make a fuck machine
(Woah-oh-oh)
A fuck machine

You can have the sex with me
(Woah-oh-oh)
We can make a baby or three
(Woah-oh-oh)
We can make a fuck machine
(Woah-oh-oh)
A fuck machine

Now we don't care
If you're a girl or a toy
If you're a game or a boy
If you're nerd or a whore
This shit is so bad
It could win a Grammy
This dick is so sick
We could start a family

Now this calls for a celebration
With a little in vitro fertilization
You're comin' for us
We're comin' for you
You're comin' for us
We're coming' for all of you

You can have the sex with me
(Woah-oh-oh)
Science fiction fantasy
(Woah-oh-oh)
We can make a fuck machine
(Woah-oh-oh)
A fuck machine

You can have the sex with me
(Woah-oh-oh)
How bad could it be?
(Woah-oh-oh)
We can make a fuck machine
(Woah-oh-oh)
A fuck machine

(Don't let your momma know)
(All right! )
(Go-go-go-go)

You can have the sex with me
(Woah-oh-oh)
Money back guarantee
(Woah-oh-oh)
We can make a fuck machine
(Woah-oh-oh)
A fuck machine

You can have the sex with me
(Woah-oh-oh)
We can make a baby or three
(Woah-oh-oh)
We can make a fuck machine
(Woah-oh-oh)
A fuck machine

(Woah-oh-oh)
