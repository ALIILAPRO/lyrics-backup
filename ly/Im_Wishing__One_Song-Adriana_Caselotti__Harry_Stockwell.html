		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Want to know a secret?
Promise not to tell?
When you're standing by a wishing well
Make a wish into the well
That's all you have to do
And if you hear it echoing
Your wish will soon come true

I'm wishing for the one I love
To find me today
I'm hoping
And I'm dreaming of
The nice things he'll say

I'm wishing for the one I love
To find me today

Today!
Now that I've found you
Hear what I have to say
One Song
I have but one song
One song
Only for you

One heart
Tenderly beating
Ever entreating
Constant and true

One love
That has possessed me
One love
Thrilling me through

One song
My heart keeps singing
Of one love
Only for you
