		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well she's a mean hard woman and she knows what she wants. 
She is my tattooed rock n roll dancer, I'm under her thumb 
And when she tells me come, ?oh hi? is the only way I can answer.

They're gonna put me away, put me away, god damn them.

Well I can hear her meaning like a dog that's in heat
She never takes no for an answer, she's driving me mad,
She makes it good to be bad, my little tattooed rock n roll dancer.

They'll never put me away, put me away, god damn them.

They'll never put me away, put me away, god soul's on fire.

Tattooed dancer, dance for me bitch.

I think I'm in grave danger, goin' over the top
There is no question only an answer, she can't give me love
I think I've fallen in lust with my tattooed rock n roll dancer.

They'll never put me away, put me away, God damn them.

They'll never put me away, put me away, God soul's on fire.

They'll never put me away, God soul's on fire
