		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah
Yeah
Oh
The best feelin' in the world
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh
Yeah, okay, yes
One, two, one-two-three, yeah

Uh, you is a lie 
Uh, you is not cut from this side, uh
You cannot come to this side, yeah
Gangster, but my jeans too tight (yeah)
I see my opps through the sights (sight)
Hit that bitch once and then tell her good night (bye bye)
All white on my ice look like rice (rice)
Stack up then get right out the sight (sight)

I just went up in my price (price)
I just went up in my price (price)
I just went up in my price (price)
I just went up in my price (ayy)
I just went up in my price
Money, my bank account, this shit precise (uh)
I just went up in my price (uh)
I just went up in my price (ayy)

I drive my whip like it's stolen (skrrt)
Yellow diamonds look like Homer (what?)
Heard that Rolls Royce is your homie's (dang)
So your whip, that is a loaner
My money aroused like my boner
I fuck your bitch and did that off aroma (yeah)
We whip it up, no baking soda
I turn a fuck nigga right to organ donor (damn)
Okay, I feel like I own her
That girl so smart that she walk for diploma (damn)
Off-white, my G-Fazos, they MoMA
She give me head all the way 'til I'm in coma (damn)
Ice is so cold like pneumonia
I might hit that bitch with that Super Soaker
I heard that boy gettin' bread, so we gon' heat his ass up with the toaster

Got a model with vitiligo 
She got a condo out in Cabo
Got a side hoe, for my side hoe
I get high the most, mix my highs with my lows

Uh, you is a lie 
Uh, you is not cut from this side, uh
You cannot come to this side, yeah
Gangster, but my jeans too tight (yeah)
I see my opps through the sights (uh)
Hit that bitch once and then tell her goodnight (yeah)
All white on my ice look like rice 
Stack up then get right outta sight (uh)

I just went up in my price (uh)
I just went up in my price (price)
I just went up in my price (uh)
I just went up in my price (price)
I just went up in my price
Money, my bank account, this shit precise (uh)
I just went up in my price (ayy)
I just went up in my price (ayy)

I got the Glick with the lock (uh)
That lil' bitch still could go pop (uh)
You keep flexin' with that drop (uh)
Best believe you gon' get dropped (uh)
I get my looks from my mom (uh)
I get my swag from my pop (my pop)
You do not wanna do no time (uh)
So you start talkin' to the cops (hello?)
I skipped in that pussy, then hop (yeah)
I heard that bitch, she was hot (ew)
Hickory, dickory, dock (uh)
VVS all in my clock (my Rollie)
Get money like Anthony Hop
Silence the lamb and your ass'll get chopped (dropped)
Clean up, his brain on aisle five
Somebody, please can they go get the mop? (The mop)
And I'm with my boys, so you know that the gang shit will not stop
You know that lil' bitch gon' look around
So if she let me fuck, then this shit is co-op
Yeah, I take more pills and she takin' more shots
Man, watch the way I had to drip on the block
Overseas on the jet, I had to slide
I went all the way to Germany, back to Gera

Uh, you is a lie 
Uh, you is not cut from this side, uh
You cannot come to this side, yeah
Gangster, but my jeans too tight (yeah)
I see my opps through the sights
Hit that bitch once and then tell her goodnight (bye bye)
All white on my ice look like rice (rice)
Stack up then get right outta sight (uh)

I just went up in my price (uh)
I just went up in my price (my price)
I just went up in my price (my price)
I just went up in my price (my price)
I just went up in my price
Money, my bank account, this shit precise (uh)
I just went up in my price (my price)
I just went up in my price (my price)

I just went up in my price
I just went up in my price
That's the way that, um, how do I explain this?
Tell 'em who you is
Yo, it's Wan II (I just went up in my price)
Come over here
You tell 'em too
(Yo, it's Wan IV)
