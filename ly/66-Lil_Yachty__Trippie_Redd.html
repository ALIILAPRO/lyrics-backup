		  DY Krazy

Racks up, racks up
Pullin' out a Bentley truck
Semi, semi, keep it tucked
Bad bitch, bubble butt
14, 14
High school sellin' beans
Dropped out now I'm rich
Flexin' 'til I'm 66

Flexin' forty bands from the pop out, ayy
Boolin' on the block I got my Glock out, ayy
I just pulled up in a Bentley
All the hatred go right to your fucking kidney
Flexin' bands, lil' nigga won't get a penny
Yeah, I'ma keep on running it up
Ayy, I'ma keep on running it up, fucking it up
This choppa busting you up
Ayy, there you go, testing your luck
Dumb as fuck, yeah
Ayy, ooh, flexin' baby, pull up in a drop top
Ayy, diamonds dancing on me, they be hopscotch
Bling Blaow shinin' fresh just like some pop rocks
Fireworks we gon' pull up to yo' block, pop

Racks up, racks up
Pullin' up, Bentley truck
Semi, semi, keep it tucked
Bad bitch, bubble butt
14, 14
High school sellin' beans
Dropped out now I'm rich
Flexin' 'til I'm 66
Racks up, racks up
Pullin' up, Bentley truck
Semi, semi, keep it tucked
Bad bitch, bubble butt
14, 14
High school sellin' beans
Dropped out now I'm rich
Flexin' 'til I'm 66

Ayy, when my brother get out, told him ain't no block now
Same bitches coming all up on my cock now
Twenty bitches and they all coming with me
Side by side, me and Trippie in the Bentley (skrrt, skrrt)
Ayy, and I bought it, ain't no renting
Baby girl I'm tryna fuck, why is you venting?
In 2016 I got hotter than your skate team
In 2018 I need at least like eight rings

Racks up, racks up
Pullin' up, Bentley truck
Semi, semi, keep it tucked
Bad bitch, bubble butt
14, 14
High school sellin' beans
Dropped out now I'm rich
Flexin' 'til I'm 66
Racks up, racks up
Pullin' up, Bentley truck
Semi, semi, keep it tucked
Bad bitch, bubble butt
14, 14
High school sellin' beans
Dropped out now I'm rich
Flexin' 'til I'm 66
