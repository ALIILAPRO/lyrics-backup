		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Move your hips along with the music.
Lick your lips but don't over-do it.
Bend your knees along with the summer.
Keep your beat but don't kill the drummer.

It's true. I wanna be with you tonight, but I'm a little too late.

Just be calm and move with the season.
Winter's gone and so has your reason.
Daisies bloom and so will desire.
Keep your cool and blow out the fire.

True, I wanna be with you tonight, but I'm a little too late.
I'm a little too late. I'm a little too late. 
Too late too late

I could be whole if I didn't know 
I could be whole if I didn't know 
About the birdies and the bees and the bushes.
Eighteen came around and it was somewhat malicious.
Everybody loses control.
I'm a little scared of my soul.
Find her, keep her, don't you go near or cheat her. 
Just you believe that you born enough. 

I could be whole if I didn't know
I could be whole if I didn't know
About the dangers of
Foreign stock exchanges from
Candy-riden strangers-
I just wanna be with you.
I wanna be with you tonight, but I'm a little too late.

Just be calm and move with the season.
Winter's gone and so has your reason.
Daisies bloom and so will desire.
Keep your cool and blow out the fire.

I could be whole if I didn't know
I could be whole if I didn't know
About the cooties and the creeps they commission.
Even when it dirty I would find it delicious.
Everybody loses control.
I'm a little scared of my soul.
Find her, keep her, don't you go near or cheat her. 
Just you believe that you born enough. 

I could be whole if I didn't know. 
I could be whole if I didn't go 
Out passin' free notes with
All the secrets we know from
Half-bred Filipinos-
I just wanna be with you.
I wanna be with you tonight, but I'm a little too late.
