		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Some velvet morning when I'm straight
I'm gonna open up your gate
And maybe tell you 'bout Phaedra
And how she gave me life
And how she made it in
Some velvet morning when I'm straight

Flowers growing on the hill
Dragonflies and daffodils
Learn from us very much
Look at us but do not touch
Phaedra is my name
 
Some velvet morning when I'm straight
I'm gonna open up your gate
And maybe tell you 'bout Phaedra
And how she gave me life
And how she made it in
Some velvet morning when I'm straight

Flowers are the things we knew
Secrets are the things we grew
Learn from us very much
Look at us but do not touch
Phaedra is my name
 
Some velvet morning when I'm straight

Flowers growing on the hill

I'm gonna open up your gate

Dragonflies and daffodils

And maybe tell you 'bout Phaedra

Learn from us very much

And how she gave me life

Look at us but do not touch

And how she made it in
