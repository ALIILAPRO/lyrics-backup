		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Filled with sorrow
Bleak inner self touched by pride,
Devoured by solitude, still wrapped in time.
I'm flowing with pain!

Holding myself back in suspicion
And lingering in the dust
The dust of my abandoned remains.
Killed with the dagger of life

Such an exquisite pride in my suffering
Alone, all alone with the emotional
Streams of my soul
So real, so pure yet I'm left aside
Entangled in fear without hope. 

I am truly left alone,
But somehow just somehow
It feels like my loneliness is a victory
Over the self-delusion of joy and happiness.

My heart beats faster, 
The anguish becomes clearer
And my misanthropic view gets stronger.
Living in the shadows
So proud of being the one,
But desperate
So desperate for a helping hand. 
Do I really want to live this life?

I have a thousand reasons to die,
And many millions of tears to cry in silence.
The human plague has emptied my life,
And I curse the day I was born to this world! 

Still, no-one else I ever want to be
And no-one else I intend to be
'Cause no-one else I was meant to be!

I need, I want, I long for my retribution
I need, I want, I yearn for my retribution
I want my retribution I want it now!

Unity; a gathering of open wounds,
Of dark of dark clean spirits
What a dream what a dream so distant!
Why should I why should I be alone
When I love when I love my brotherhood?
Shall I die shall I die to be free 
When I cry when I cry in silence
So please let me die in silence
Oh my god, let me die in silence!
