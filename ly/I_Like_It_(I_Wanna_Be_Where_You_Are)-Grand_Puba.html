		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
Ladies and gentlemen, I've found him
I want you to meet the baddest motherfucker in town
(Right on, right on, right on, go 'head, tell it) 
Who is it?
Well, it's Grand Puba, honey
With my man Stud Doogie, love
Droppin' 2000, dig the way this go down
Check it

I hit a flow all dipped in Lo'
Sit back and sip MoÃ« as I'm count my dough
Grand Puba Maxwell, Doogie, comin' with the New York
We keep it real like jail when we mic talk
Honeys know 'cause when I'm in the set
Grand Puba is the one who makes they stink box wet
So let me tell ya somethin', lady
When ya flow this flow then its all cream and baby
I made this one for the brothers in the party
To find a hottie and dance body to body
Step one, first you grab honey by the waist
Step two, then you move at a ghetto pace
Step three, then ya look her dead in the face
Step four, now it's time to leave this place
Hold up, be careful of the cheesa's
The teaser's, the one who wants the money and the Visa's
I'ma tell honeys straight off the bat
But please don't even go there with that, dig it
This one's designed to make your spine in your back wind
Grand Puba nice it up for you every time

Ooh, and I like it
And you say New York City
Ooh, and I like it
And you and you say New York City
Ooh, and I like it
And you say New York City
Ooh, and I like it
And you say

Could it be I stayed away too long?
Thief MC's be wishing I was gone
Because they wanna be where I are 
But you can't get that far
So stop wishing on a star
It's only one Grand P
So, honey, do what you did on the night you creeped with me
It's no doubt I come real with that, the butter track
The one that makes honeys hit the bed mat
I'm energetic, poetic, athletic with good credit 
So just move like I'm Simon and I said it
You see my flow is just a step ahead
I'm still wicked in a bed because I'm down right nasty like newlyweds
So back up and let me breathe 'cause when it comes to gettin' down
I'm gettin' looser than a crackhead's hair weave
And I betcha, my golly, wow 
You never find another style like this if ya search a million miles
So won't ya let Puba nice your party
I hit a flow liike Al Jarreau
See, I've been doin' this for years
I'm leavin' MC's in tears, tears, dig it
'Cause they fallin' just like the rain
Grand Puba's too much for the brain
Now gold diggers who try to get it
I left 'em backwards, they thought they farted when they shitted
'Cause Puba's everything, and everything is Pu
'Cause I hit 'em with the (one) and then with a (two) 
Yeah, 'cause that's just how Grand Pu and Stud Doogie do
You didn't know I was the bomb, baby?
Somebody should've told you, somebody should have told you

Ooh, and I like it (yeah)
Ooh, and I like it
And you say New York City
Ooh, and I like it (no doubt)
And you say New York City
Ooh, and I like it
Ha ha, and you say

'Cause we get down for ours, we get down no doubt
Down for ours, we get down no doubt
Down for ours, we get down no doubt
Down for ours, we get down
'Cause we get down for ours, we get down no doubt
Down for ours, we get down no doubt
Down for ours, we get down no doubt
'95 flav', and I'm out
(Ooh, and I like it)
(Ooh, and)
