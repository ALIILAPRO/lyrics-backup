		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Help me mister fireman, please
You know I'm burning from my head to my knees
I'm aflame with such a burning desire
A little girl set my soul on fire
She's got me burning up like a paper cup
Hmmm, hmmm, I'm on fire

Turn on a full alarm
I'm aflame for all of her charm
Oh, little fire truck can't you see
Can't you see what she's doing to me
She's got me burning up like a paper cup
Hmmm, hmmm, I'm on fire

And when my baby kisses me
I start shakin' like a ship on a stormy sea
And when I hear her say
I'm gonna love you each and every day
I start to roast, like toast, oh eeeeeee!

Help me mister fireman, please
You know I'm burning from my head to my knees
I'm aflame with such a burning desire
The little girl set my soul on fire
She got me burning up like a paper cup
Eeeeee! I'm on fire

And when my baby kisses me
I start shakin' like a ship on a stormy sea
And when I hear her say
I'm gonna love you each and every day
I start to roast, just like toast, oh eeeeeee!

Help me mister fireman, please
You know I'm burning from my head to my knees
I'm aflame with such a burning desire
That little girl sets my soul on fire
She's got me burning up like a paper cup
Eeeeee! I'm on fire
