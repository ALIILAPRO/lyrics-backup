		  (One studio session later)

I've built machines that'll do more damage than Plan Z
Blurring the lines of reality
I'm not alone
This neon tide is an army that'll turn Bikini Bottom to a warzone

They won't even need a bucket helmet over their eyes
To bow down for the rest of their lives

'Cause now the neon tide
Is breaking like the waves tonight
What's real and what's fake
Will be left up to fate
No love, no truth, no lies
Just neon tide

(Ai failed)

What happened to my home?
It's not the place I know
This neon is loud, the flower clouds have fallen down
My pineapple is grey
And Gary ran away again
Where's Barnacle Boy and Mermaid Man?

'Cause they got this bucket helmet over our eyes
I don't wanna live like this for the rest of my life

'Cause now the neon tide
Is breaking like the waves tonight
What's real and what's fake
Will be left up to fate
No love, no truth, no lies
Just neon tide

When the smoke rolls in, and the light falls out
Don't you be surprised
You're the demand, so I'll supply
The neon tide
What's your final wish?
You chose convenience over Neptune's gift
(Clap, clap, clap, 'til you can't take it back)
Your time is up
The neon tide is here to call your bluff

'Cause now the neon tide
Is breaking like the waves tonight
What's real and what's fake
Will be left up to fate
No love, no truth, no lies
Just neon tide

What's real and what's fake
Will be left up to fate
No love, no truth, no lies
Just neon tide
