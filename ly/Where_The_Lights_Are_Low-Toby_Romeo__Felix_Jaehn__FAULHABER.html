		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Come and meet me where the lights are low

I'll keep a secret, oh my my
I'll keep it hush if we do something dumb tonight
So many reasons, oh my my
We should know better, not talk about sex but

I don't wanna stop it, no, no, no
If I'm being honest, whoa

I've been thinking 'bout you every night, every day
I can tell your body feel the same, feel the same
Put our hands in places we don't want them to know
Come and meet me where the lights are low

I've been thinking 'bout you every night, every day
I can tell your body feel the same, feel the same
Put our hands in places we don't want them to know
Come and meet me where the lights are low

She say let's do this, oh my my
A little less talk and a little more lips on mine
Let's get into it, oh my my
I know I said let's not end up in bed but

I don't wanna stop it, no, no, no
If I'm being honest, whoa

I've been thinking 'bout you every night, every day
I can tell your body feel the same, feel the same
Put our hands in places we don't want them to know
Come and meet me where the lights are low

I've been thinking 'bout you every night, every day
I can tell your body feel the same, feel the same
Put our hands in places we don't want them to know
Come and meet me where the lights are low

Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na 
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na

Come and meet me where the lights are low
Come and meet me where the lights are low
