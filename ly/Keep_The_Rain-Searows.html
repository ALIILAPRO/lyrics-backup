		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't know what steps to take
I do the easy ones until it helps
Little acts of conversation
I don't think I really like myself

Am I comfortable in silence?
Or is it eating me alive
Nothing's ever really quiet
When you need distraction to survive

It's part of me
Wouldn't you believe it's nothing?
It's all you need
When you keep the rain from coming

I'm already going under
Nothing I can do but sit and wait
Are you really having fun or
Do you like becoming what you hate?
Am I comfortable in silence
Or am I waiting till it ends
Nothing's ever really quiet
You were just to stubborn to pretend

It's part of me
Wouldn't you believe it's nothing?
It's all you need
When you keep the rain from coming

I'm good at letting you go
I'm good at letting it get to me
I'm good at letting you go
No, you were never the enemy
