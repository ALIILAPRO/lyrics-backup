		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Back, uh
Nobody thought I was leaving
Caught with the greavin'
Was taught to misleading
When all I been caught in the seasons
But I've changed for the better and I know that
Things don't look better through a Kodak
But some things look special in a throwback
Out in the cold and I'm telling you to hold that
Just there
Beauty in bold, I stare 
'Cause your froze in the cold night air
As the show lights glare
You can hold my beer
'Cause the cameos grow so rare
I suppose I care, uh
About you more than anyone else and I know that's true (know that's true)
Uh
So I propose and I say I do 
And we'll run to the moon
September to June, and July 
We can sleep in your room (sleep in your)
Never way too soon, uh (way too soon)
You can hum to your favorite tune like
Mmh

Spending time, spending time
Was never a waste (uh uh) of mine, with you

Trust me, trust me
Speaking of love well it must be
Cleaning the bed when it's dusty
Who else gonna moisture my face when it's crusty?
It must be, it must be
Done with the games 'cause I'm rusty
And I ain't afraid that you love me
Wait 'til we get our own place and it's comfy
You touch these stars, uh
So I let you touch these scars
Laying in my arms and the bus breeze past
I'ma tell you that the trust needs ours
'Cause it just needs ours (just needs ours)
Uh
Bumping to Nas
Lisbon to Mars
Twisting tars
Uh

Spending time, spending time
Was never a waste of mine
With you
Inner vibes down my spine, in the months
Inner tuition intertwined and grew 
And grew and grew and grew
Huh, and grew
Uh oh ah
Ahh, slept on it

Feeling kinda distant from Desoleil
I know you're out of town and only a text away
I wish that you were here and laying next to me
Enlightened Paulo Santos to the west of me
Been battling some villains and they press on me
Without that guiding voice there especially
Nesting here together on the chest you breath

Ch'yeah
Uh, uh
Lines that I write will survive
Another night blinds with the ties
Take mine 'til it's fine
The time flies by 'til I'm sitting with the stars in her eyes
Can't lie but I need to, I need you
Knee deep in the sea that we been through
Seen gleams but the beams will mislead you
So I leave speaking the evil to those, who wanna keep
Wanna talk, I don't wanna speak
Wanna walk, I don't wanna be
Honestly, something more than a cup of tea that you come and see
Feasty but you're screaming to cover me
Deep 'cause your mother weeps when your brother leaves
Need sleep can't speak when you love for me
All the other geeze want a piece 
But you're putting up with me 
'Cause I see that you're deeply in love with me
Uh
Shit
You're deeply in love with me?
