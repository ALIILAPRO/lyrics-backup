		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I tried to climb into your skin
I tried to locate the beating
Of your, your, your, your heart
Of your, your, your, your heart
I walked for hours inside you
I talked in my voice and tried to
Find your, your, your, your heart
Find your, your, your, your heart

I ran through all your veins
I saw all of your visions
I found all of you, babe
But I couldn't find me anywhere
And now I'm stuck 
Inside of you

Baby, you gotta let me, you gotta let me out
I gotta get free, I gotta get free, oh, baby
I'm too invested, I can't get obsessed with you
Baby, you gotta let me, you gotta let me out
I gotta get free, I gotta get free, oh, baby
I'm too invested, I can't get obsessed with you

You keep my heartbeat in your teeth
And scissors cutting into me
All your, your, your, your dark
All my, my, my, my light

I ran through all your veins
I saw all of your visions
I found all of you, babe
But I couldn't find me anywhere
And now I'm stuck 
Inside of you

Baby, you gotta let me, you gotta let me out
I gotta get free, I gotta get free, oh, baby
I'm too invested, I can't get obsessed with you
Baby, you gotta let me, you gotta let me go
I gotta get free, I gotta get out, oh, baby
I'm too invested, I can't get obsessed with you

I feel your mouth when you kiss her lips
I trace her skin with your fingertips
I see her the way you do and it hurts
Ooh-ooh-ooh

Baby, you gotta let me, you gotta let me out
I gotta get free, I gotta get free, oh, baby (baby)
I'm too invested, I can't get obsessed with you
Baby, you gotta let me, you gotta let me out
I gotta get free, I gotta get out, oh, baby
I'm too invested (I'm too invested), I can't get obsessed with you
