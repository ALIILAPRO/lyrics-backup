		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Off comes the make up

Off comes the clown's disguise 
The curtain's fallin' 
The music softly dies.

But I hope your smilin'
As you're filin' out the door
As they say in this biz

That's all there is, there isn't anymore.

We've shared a moment
And as the moment ends  
I got a funny feelin'

We're parting now as friends.
 
Your cheers and laughter will linger after
They've torn down these dusty walls
If I had this to do again  
And the evening were new again

I would spend it with you again
But now the curtain falls.  

Your cheers and laughter will linger after    

They've torn down these dusty walls
People say I was made for this  

Nothin' else would I trade for this

And just think I get paid for this...
     
“Goodnight ladies and gentlemen and God love you, thank you.”
