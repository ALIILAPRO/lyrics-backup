		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Even if a part of me has taken it away
Even if the blue subsides to grey
Start to clinch a muscle and I feel it ebb away

Not a soul will take my place
Hide it all away

Is it face, what it take?
I got demons in my face, face

Not a soul will take my place

Even if a part of me has taken it away
Even if the blue subsides to grey
Start to clinch a muscle and I feel it ebb away

Not a soul will take my place

Honey dew, my memories are blessed
What else could help you breathe?
All I know is you were broken
Just like I was in need

Honey dew, my memories are blessed
What else could help you breathe?
All I know is you were broken
Just like I was in need

Honey dew (even if a part of me has taken it away)
My memories are blessed (even if the blue subsides to grey)
What else could help you breathe? (Not a soul will take my place)
All I know is you were broken
Just like I was in need

Honey dew, my memories are blessed
What else could help you breathe?
All I know is you were broken
Just like I was in need
