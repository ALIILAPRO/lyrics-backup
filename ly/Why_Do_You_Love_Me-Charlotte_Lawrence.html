		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hate your friends
I hate your mom and dad
I hope they hate me back
I guess for once, I'm being honest
Gotta be a lot that's wrong with you
To wanna be with me
It's kind of sweet when we

We fight until someone's calling the cops
But you never blame it on me
You're so annoying
Four in the morning, you're changing the locks
How could you do this to me? (Oh)

I, I, I only love, love you when you don't love me
So, why do you, why do you, why do you love me?
I, I, I only need, need you when you don't need me
So, why do you, why do you, why do you love me?

Apologize, never apologize
You hate the way I lie
So here you go, I'm being honest
Narcissus, come on, give us a kiss
Let's have some fun with it
It's kinda sweet (it's kinda sweet)

Four in the morning, you're changing the locks
How could you do this to me? (Oh)

I, I, I only love, love you when you don't love me
Oh, baby, so, why do you, why do you, why do you love me?
I, I, I only need, need you when you don't need me
So, why do you, why do you, why do you love me?
If I'm fucking crazy, you're fucking crazy
We're all fucking crazy
Why do you, why do you, why do you love me?
I, I, I only love, love you when you don't love me
So, why do you, why do you, why do you love me?

(Why do you love ?)
(Why do you, why do you)
(Why do you)
Yeah (why do you love me?)
We fight until someone's callin' the cops
But you never blame it on me (oh)

I, I, I only love, love you when you don't love me
So, why do you, why do you, why do you love me?
I, I, I only need, need you when you don't need me (baby, baby, baby, baby, baby)
So, why do you, why do you, why do you love me?
If I'm fucking crazy (if I'm fucking crazy)
You're fucking crazy (you're fucking crazy)
We're all fucking crazy (oh, baby)
Why do you, why do you, why do you love me?
I, I, I only love, love you when you don't love me (don't need me, don't need me)
So, why do you, why do you, why do you love me?
