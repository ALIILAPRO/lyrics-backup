		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  He's always there
And nothing can bring me down
A beacon of hope
In the blackest of nights
In moments of doubt
He whispers in my ear
He says, "Don't worry,
Let go of all your fears"
With moonlit wings and the starry eyes
I just watch as he dances across the sky
Whenever I am lost
You light my way
In the shadows I like how he stands so tall
Oh I love that he'll catch me if I fall
You're the melody of my life's symphony
I've got an angel
Always watching me
My sweet angel
I know he won't leave
Through the darkness
He's my guiding light
When there's no one
He is by my side
I've got an angel
Who won't ever leave
With every step I take
He's always by my side
When he's around me
All of my fears resign
His healing touch and his gaze is so divine
In his company
I know that I'll be fine
With moonlit wings and the starry eyes
I just watch as he dances across the sky
Whenever I am lost
You light my way
In the shadows I like how he stands so tall
Oh I love that he'll catch me if I fall
You're the melody of my life's symphony
I've got an angel
Always watching me
My sweet angel
I know he won't leave
Through the darkness
He's my guiding light
When there's no one
He is by my side
I've got an angel
Who won't ever leave
A light in the dark
He's guiding my heart
When we're together
Sent from the heavens
With you I belong
'Cause you are the song
The voice that's in my dreams
That tells me what I need
I've got an angel
I've got an angel
My sweet angel
I know he won't leave
Through the darkness
He's my guiding light
When there's no one
He is by my side
Got an angel
Who won't ever leave
My sweet angel
My sweet angel
My sweet angel
My sweet angel
My sweet angel
