		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Voices of the matriarch
A hierarchy outside of the status quo
Tormented legions feast
Upon the innocent, entrench the control

The choice of condemnation breeds an army of accursed
The dominion will grow, codified in the circle
So let it be known, she will be enthroned

Watch her ascend, concede unto her
And now you relent, for she has crossed the oceans of time
Damnation you'll find

Damnation flame
Burning us down when we're already bound
And the earth is bleeding
The mark of the one in the shape of a ghoul
In the pouring rain
See what she wrote upon the wall
I'm a true believer
Damnation flame

Ruled across the centuries
The heresy, our mark on the fevered soul
Unearthly specters rise
And a frantic danse macabre you behold

Blackened inquisition, fall to witchery
A thrall and all that you sold
Premonitions untold, was your immortal soul
Now you shall behold

Lifeblood is spent, surrender to her
Now you repent, her bloodline is damnation divine
Damnation you'll find

Damnation flame
Burning us down when we're already bound
And the earth is bleeding
The mark of the one in the shape of a ghoul
In the pouring rain
See what she wrote upon the wall
I'm a true believer
Damnation flame

Entwine the pain, you're stigmatized
Temerity from dusk to sunrise
Embrace the flame, in dusk reside
Mortality, a frailty denied

Watch her ascend, concede unto her
And now you relent
Her bloodline is damnation divine

Damnation flame
Burning us down when we're already bound
And the earth is bleeding
The mark of the one in the shape of a ghoul
In the pouring rain
See what she wrote upon the wall
I'm a true believer
Damnation flame
