		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Through it all once again, came to know my only friend
Lost control
Can't begin, I seek within
To feel the warmth brought within your skin
Did you know
For how it seemed
I should've stayed and let you be
Run into my heart so carelessly
That's the reason I'm afraid
You're thoughts that can't be tamed
And I'm trying to be sane
And I'm trying to be sane
And I'm trying to be sane
