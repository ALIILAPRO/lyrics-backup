		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I hate looking at my phone
But it's all that I do
What do I need that I can't
Get from you?

Seems like you're never off the clock
Hands at ten and two
I'm driving through this world like
Someone's after you

I'd rather lose
I'd rather lose
If the only way to win
Is by breaking all the rules
I'd rather lose
I'd rather lose
If the only way to win
Is by breaking all the rules
I'd rather lose

Every picture that I take
Every word that I say
Ends up a footnote on my resume

Are you happy with your life?
Am I happy with mine?
Where is the innocence
We hid behind?

And who were those kids
Who knew where to draw the line?

I'd rather lose
I'd rather lose
If the only way to win
Is by breaking all the rules
I'd rather lose
I'd rather lose
If the only way to win
Is by breaking all the rules
I'd rather lose

We only get one chance in this life
And I won't spend it playing with you
Some people roll the dice and
Some people doctor the truth

I'd rather lose
I'd rather lose
If the only way to win
Is by breaking all the rules
I'd rather lose
I'd rather lose
If the only way to win
Is by breaking all the rules
I'd rather lose
Oh, I'd rather lose
