		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Who would I lose, could I find?
If I open all the doors and let â€˜em breathe
Who will I love, leave behind?
There's an endless sea of me i'll never be

Kill your darlings make your peace
cll we got is possibilities
Embrace the silence it's your masterpiece
cll we got is possibilities

I feel it dawning
cnd I don't know what to call it*
I feel it dawning
cnd I don't know what to call it

How will I know when it's right?
Oh can I rely on serendipity? (serendipity)
How will I know when it's time? 
There's an endless sea of me I'll never be (I'll never be, I'll never)

Kill your darlings make your peace
cll we got is possibility
Embrace the silence it's your masterpiece 
cll we got is possibility

I feel it dawning
cnd I don't know what to call it
I feel it dawning
cnd I don't know what to call it
What you bury underneath the snow
Comes back to the summer glow
If you want it, don't you let it go (Don't you let it go)

How will I know that I'm right?
How can I rely on serendipity?

I feel it dawning
cnd I don't know what to call it
I feel it dawning
cnd I don't know what to call it
I feel it dawning
cnd i don't know what to call it
I feel it dawning
cnd i don't know what to call it
