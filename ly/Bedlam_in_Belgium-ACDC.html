		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah
The blood in my veins was runnin' right through my brain
There was a cop with a gun
Who was runnin' around insane
Three fifty arrests
No bullet proof vest
Now ain't that a shame
We wanted to play 
Play for the crowd
Law said no way
Cause you're on your way out
Bedlam in Belgium
Bedlam in Belgium

The place was a jumpin'
And the booze was going down
There's a curfew at ten
And you been working overtime
We don't play just for pay
So we'd like to stay
Stay just the same
He gave me a crack in the back with his gun
Hurt me so bad I could feel the blood run
Bedlam in Belgium
It was bedlam in Belgium
Bedlam in Belgium
Came for a good time and left on the run
Bedlam in Belgium, yeah
Who's to blame
It's a shame

Bedlam
In Belgium
It was bedlam

Getting ready
Stayed on the stage cops in a rage
Crowd yelled for more it was war, war, war
Bedlam in Belgium
It was bedlam in Belgium
Bedlam in Belgium 
Came for a good time and left on the run
Bedlam in Belgium

It was bedlam ( in Belgium )
It was bedlam ( in Belgium )
It was bedlam
And the law got the drop on 
Me
