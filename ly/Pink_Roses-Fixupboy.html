		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Get out of my head 
I don't wanna talk bitch you left me on read 
Overcomplicated everything that she said 
I can't love forever babe it's overly spread  
I don't wanna fuck with you if you just run away 
Swear you split my heart in 2 then go about your day 
Ahh
It's so toxic babe 
Nah
In a perfect way 
Ah 
It's just not the same 
Speak with you another day 

I let you in 
You broke my heart 
You came and left 
We're so apart 
Never ending that's something I can't stop
Thought we were to the end 
Until you broke my 

I don't wanna feel alone no more no 
You don't even pick up the phone no more 
You don't mean anything to me I'm so hopeless
And I gave you my all with some pink roses 
Some roses 
Yeah, aye 
Don't you know this 
Aye 
Thought you wouldn't notice 
And I can't love 
Yeah yeah 
I can't trust 
You been on my mind 
For a minute I can't love 
Yeah I can't love 
Yeah I can't love 

Get out of my head 
I don't wanna talk bitch you left me on read 
Overcomplicated everything that she said 
I can't love forever babe it's overly spread  
I don't wanna fuck with you if you just run away 
Swear you split my heart in 2 then go about your day 
Ahh
It's so toxic babe 
Nah
In a perfect way 
Ah 
It's just not the same 
Speak with you another day
