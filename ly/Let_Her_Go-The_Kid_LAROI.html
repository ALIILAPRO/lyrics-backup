		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What's the call?
In love with the money, it's, "Fuck 'em all"
Heard you fucked up my bro, I can't fuck with y'all
I don't want her, unless she gon' do the dogs
I got everything I ever prayed for
Lil' shawty gon' suck it right through the draws
R-i-p to the ones I forever lost
R-i-p to the money, I ran it up

If she bad, Michael Jack, I'ma let her know (know)
And if she do how she say, then I can't let her go, whoa
I can't let her go
I can't let her go
I can't let her go
I can't let her go

Yeah, on and on, she go on and on-on-on
Bitch get up off my motherfuckin' phone-phone-phone
I be Speaker Knockerz, get these bands on my lone-lone-lone
Come collect the check then fuck it up, whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
Yeah new Benz, too bad, I'ma see you later shawty
New Rick, new Raf, fuck about a hater, homie
I do what I do 'cause I am who I am
Yeah, I don't need a reason or an explanation

And that's just the way it is, the way, the way
And that's just the way it is, the way, the way
Young and rich and on my own
And that's why she keep callin' my phone

What's the call?
In love with the money, it's, "Fuck 'em all"
Heard you fucked up my bro, I can't fuck with y'all
I don't want her, unless she gon' do the dogs
I got everything I ever prayed for
Lil' shawty gon' suck it right through the draws
R-i-p to the ones I forever lost
R-i-p to the money, I ran it up

If she bad, Michael Jack, I'ma let her know (know)
And if she do how she say, then I can't let her go, whoa
I can't let her go
I can't let her go
I can't let her go
I can't let her go
