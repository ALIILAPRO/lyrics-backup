		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Cold, cold heart

And this is what I should have said
Well, I thought it, but I kept it in

Cold, cold heart
Cold, cold heart

And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no, no, no
And this is what I should have said
Well, I thought it, but I kept it in

Cold, cold heart

And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no, no, no

And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no, no, no
