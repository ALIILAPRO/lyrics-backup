		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm hiding out in Missouri, not happy anywhere
I had it all in front of me, I didn't even care
It's kinda like a mystery I'd even end up here
I packed up all I could carry, on a one way fare

I told you that I'd change
But I guess I never did
I told you that I'd change
But I guess I never did

I'm laying low in Las Vegas
With nothing else to do
But dream of ditching all my things
And coming back for you

I told you that I'd change
But I guess I never did
I told you that I'd change
But I guess I never did

I'm just wondering
I'm just wondering

Looking for clovers, over and over
All that I want is some kind of closure
I saw a house, it looked like ours did
I'm kinda homesick, wish that I wasn't
Looking for answers, hoping they find me
Flirt with the moment, just to ignore it
I'm getting nervous, thinking about it
Why must we always live in a panic?
I've got a feeling, baby, surprise me
I'm getting older, over and over
I'm getting used to waking up slower
I still remember your head on my shoulder

I told you that I'd change (ah)
But I guess I never did (ah)
I told you that I'd change (ah)
But I guess I never did (ah)
(I'm just wondering)
I told you that I'd change
(I'm just wondering)
But I guess I never did

I've got a feeling, baby, surprise me
I'm getting older, over and over
I'm getting used to waking up slower
I still remember your head on my shoulder
That's why I wrote you, with love from Missouri
