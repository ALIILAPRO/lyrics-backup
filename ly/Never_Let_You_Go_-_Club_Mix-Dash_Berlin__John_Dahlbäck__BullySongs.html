		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We were living a lie and looking away
Floating inside some outer space
Hurting ourselves and losing control
We were so far gone
But then underneath it all, underneath it all there's
Something beautiful like a fallen star
You show me not to let, show me not to let, let it go

All over again, time after time
I never believed it could be mine
A flash in the dark, when nothing was right
When I'm with you I feel alive

I'll never let you go (never let you go, never let you go)
I'll never let you go (never let you go, never let you go, never let you go, never let you go)
I'll never let you go

I'll never let you go

We're splitting the sky with fire in our hearts
And nothing can stop us leaving the past
They try pulling us back and tying us down
We're too far gone
Way up above it all, up above it all were
Something beautiful and it's all because you
Show me not to let, show me not to let let it go

All over again, time after time
I never believed it could be mine
A flash in the dark, when nothing was right
When I'm with I feel alive

I'll never let you go (never let you go, never let you go, never let you go, never let you go)

I'll never let you go

I'll never let you go
