		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't wanna write this down
I wanna tell you how I feel right now
I don't wanna take no time to write this down
I wanna tell you how I feel right now, hey

Tomorrow may never come
For you or me
Life is not promised
Tomorrow may never show up
For you and me
This life is not promised

I ain't no perfect man
I'm trying to do, the best that I can
With what it is I have
I ain't no perfect man
I'm trying to do, the best that I can
With what it is I have

Put my heart and soul into this song (yes, yes)
I hope you feel me
From where I am to wherever you are
I mean that sincerely
Tomorrow may never come (nah)
For you and me
Life is not promised
Tomorrow may never appear
You better hold this very moment (this very moment)
Very close to you (right now)
Very close to you (right now)
So close to you, So, close to you (your moment in history is right now)
Don't be afraid, to let it shine

My Umi said shine your light on the world
Shine your light for the world to see
My Abi said shine your light on the world
Shine your light for the world to see
(I want black people to be free, to be free, to be free)
My Abi said shine your light on the world
(Want black people to be free, to be free, to be free)
Shine your light for the world to see
(Want black people to be free, to be free, to be free)
My Umi said shine your light on the world
(Want black people to be free, to be free, to be free)
Shine your light for the world to see
(Want black people to be free, to be free)

Sometimes I get discouraged
I look around and, things are so weak
People are so weak
Sometimes
Sometimes I feel like crying
Sometimes my heart gets heavy
Sometimes I just want to leave and fly away (fly fly fly like a dove)
Sometimes I don't know what to do with myself (ow)
Passion takes over me
I feel like a man
Going insane
Losing my brain
Trying to maintain
Doing my thing
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Put my heart and soul into this y'all
I hope you feel me
Where I am to wherever you are
Sometimes I don't want to be bothered
Sometimes I just want a quiet life with
Me and my babies, me and my lady
Sometimes I don't want to get into no war 
(Black people to be free, to be free)
Sometimes I don't wanna be a soldier
Sometimes I just wanna be a man, but (to be free, to be free)

Umi said shine your light on the world
Shine your light for the world to see
My Abi said shine your light on the world
Shine your light for the world to see
(I want black people to be free, to be free, to be free)
My G-ma said shine your light on the world
(Want black people to be free, to be free, to be free)
Shine your light for the world to see
(Want black people)
My elders said shine your light on the world (hey, hey)
Shine your light for the world to see (hey, hey)

I want black people to be free, to be free, to be free
All my people to be free, to be free, to be free
Oh black people to be free, to be free, to be free
Oh black people to be free, to be free, to be free

That's all that matters to me
That's all that matters to me
That's all that matters to me
That's all that matters to me
That's all that matters to me
That's all that matters to me
That's all that matters to me (to be free, to be free, to be free)

Black people unite and let's all get down (to be free, hey)
Gotta have what?
Gotta have that love
Peace and understanding
One God, one light
One man, one voice, one mic
Black people unite come on and do it right
Black people unite come on and do it right
Black people unite come on and get down
Gotta have what? (Black people)
Love, peace and understanding (black people)
One God, one voice, one life (black people)
One man, gon' shine my light (black people)
Black people unite, now hop up and do it right (to be free, to be free)
Black people unite, now come on and do it right (to be free)
Yeah, baby, that's what I like (black people) 
(Yeah, baby, that's what I like) my people
(Yeah, baby, that's what I like) black people
(Yeah, baby, that's what I like) my people
(Yeah, baby, that's what I like) black people
(Yeah, baby, that's what I like) my people
My people, my people
