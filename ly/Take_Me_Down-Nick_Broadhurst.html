		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And I feel like coming down
But I want to show you how
Only so much fear can buy
I will never be your prize

And I fall on back to you
And then I fall on back to you

And I fall on back to you
And then I fall on back to you

Oooh Oooh Oooh
Oooh Oooh Oooh

Oh, the love is gone, nothing you can do to me will take me down
You will try, thereâ€™s nothing wrong, nothing you can do to fail the love of sound

I was sleeping with the fear that I found
I see it in your eyes, you take me down

And once upon a time I was your fool
Nothing you can do to me will take me down

And I fall on back to you
And then I fall on back to you

And I fall on back to you
And then I fall on back to you

Oooh Oooh Oooh

Then I fall on back
Then I fall on back to you, my love has gone
Then I fall on back
Then I fall on back to you, my love has gone
Then I fall on back
Then I fall on back to you, my love has gone

And you will never take me down
And you will never take me down
And you will never take me down
