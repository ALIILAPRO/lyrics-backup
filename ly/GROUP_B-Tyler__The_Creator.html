		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (That's all I wanna do)

Ayo, bucket hat like I'm Gilligan
Hit Wallace, I just ordered a Cullinan
Milkin' the cow, what are you niggas uttering?
Churnin' the butter, sensitive niggas cryin'
Steppin' in puddles in them new (them new Giannos, nigga, come on)
The team I'm assemblin', you tremblin'
We in a circle huddlin'
Fumble and we comin' in, tacklin' your empire
It's Robert crumblin'
One nom? Huh, shit is humbling
I'm a fucking JumboTron, Juggernaut, you a G?
No, you're not, new balloon, watch it p-
Concave on a skateboard
Don't do surfboards, I don't ride waves
Been around forever, Murray's Pomade, nigga
Been like a decade, yeah, shut up, uh

Ayo, keep it buck, I switch up
You niggas don't, that's why you stuck
I needed seven figures, hit Australia, pick it up
Find some young twink and get my nipples sucked
Bad yellow bitch look like pimple pus
Bad chocolate bitch look like Lionel knuckles
Y'all got too much baggage and I pack light, Louis trunk
Luggage double C, emeralds double V
Uni tee, but the sweater vest is me
Lemonade, elder flower with the rose
Sony read up, I'ma split it with the bro (yeah)

Yeah
Niggas like, "Act ya age, T, you trippin'"
Pushin' thirty, but the skin say different, well
If I act my last deal, I'm prolly twelve
Niggas on, nigga set a lob
Then they hurt themselves, niggas Cheddar Bob
Foot is on the gas, I ain't letting off (skrrt)
Every car is gas, pissing Greta off
And they Group B and the leather soft
And I knew the cow, and he better off dead

One take
It's like seven AM
