		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It would be a lie if I said I'm fine
How come a peace of mind is so hard to find?
This will be the night that all stars align
Pray all the evil eyes in my life go blind
Lately, I been through it all
I been righting wrongs, back against the wall
All the evil eyes in my life go blind
Pray all the evil eyes in my life go blind

Go off this, flames out the exhaust, shit
Often, yeah, do this so often
I'm ballin', they don't like the way I'm ballin'
Ballin', ballin', ballin', ballin'
I got two hoes, two phones, can't keep callin'
Noodles, noodles, just a lobster
Ridin', ridin', the horizon
I'm ridin', I'm ridin'

Saint Laurent my collar, three thousand the concert
I was so bothered, now I'm just a baller
I'm a shot caller, I'm a high roller
I can take your bitch, yeah, I'ma just control her
I can spend like ten racks, peep that shit as usual
No, I cannot love you back, the feeling is not mutual
I can spend like ten racks, this shit be so usual
No, I cannot love you back, the feeling is not mutual

It would be a lie if I said I'm fine
How come a peace of mind is so hard to find?
This will be the night that all stars align
Pray all the evil eyes in my life go blind
Lately, I been through it all
I been righting wrongs, back against the wall
All the evil eyes in my life go blind
Pray all the evil eyes in my life go blind

Lately, I been righting wrongs
R-r-righting wrongs, I been righting wrongs
Lately, I been righting wrongs
R-r-righting wrongs
Back against the wall
