		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Something that you told me stayed in my head
All night long
You wanted me to love you
When you said softly
Reach out and touch me
My love is in your hands

Feel me
I want to feel the fire, yeah
Feel me
I want to feel you, oh

And if I should lose your love
For any reason, any reason at all
Then let my record show
I gave you all the love I know

Something that you told me stayed in my head
All night long
You wanted me to love you
When you said softly
Reach out and touch me
My love is in your hands, come on, girl

Feel me
(All you got to do)
I want to feel the fire
(Yeah)
Feel me
I want to feel you, yeah

And if I should lose your love
For any reason, any reason at all
Then let my record show
I gave you all the love I know, I know, whoa, ho ho ho

Feel, feel the fire
Feel the fire, yeah, all you got to do
Don't, don't try to play with my emotions
Give me lovin' and devotion

Feel the fire
(Oh, my love, if you don't really mean it)
Don't try to play with my emotions
(Whoa, ho ho ho)
Feel the fire
(Feel the fire)
Don't try to play with my emotions, yeah

(Feel the fire)
Yeah
Don't try to play with my emotions
