		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't go fast enough
To break free from the bond of your love
And I ain't been strong enough
To let go and let gone
I can't see clear enough
To look past the dust you left behind
And I can't get high enough
To forget why I cry (I cry, I cry)

So I'll drive
Ten thousand miles into the dead of night
'Til I run out of love for you, baby
'Til I've got no more love for you, baby
Oh, I'll drive
Ten thousand miles into the endless sky
'Til I run out of love for you, baby
'Til I've got no more love for you, baby

I will drive all night
I will drive all night
Leave it all behind
I will drive all night

I paint your silhouette (I paint your silhouette)
In the shadow of every headlight
I turn up my radio (I turn up my radio)
But I can't turn off my mind
Somehow you get to me (somehow you get to me)
It don't matter the distance I go
Our love is dead to me (dead to me)
But I believe in ghosts

So I'll drive
Ten thousand miles into the dead of night
'Til I run out of love for you, baby
'Til I've got no more love for you, baby

I will drive all night, I will drive all night
Leave it all behind, I will drive all night
I will drive all night, I will drive all night
Leave it all behind, I will drive all night
I will drive all night
