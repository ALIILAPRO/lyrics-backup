		  Hail (hail)
What's the matter with your head, yeah
Hail (hail)
What's the matter with your mind
And your sign an-a, oh-oh-oh
Hail (hail)
Nothin' the matter with your head
Baby, find it, come on and find it
Hail, with it, baby
'Cause you're fine
And you're mine, and you look so divine
Come and get your love
Come and get your love
Come and get your love
Come and get your love
Hail (hail)
What's the matter with you feel right
Don't you feel right baby
Hail, oh yeah
Get it from the main vine, all right
I said-a find it, find it
Go on and love it if you like it, yeah
Hail (hail)
It's your business if you want some, take some
Get it together baby
Come and get your love
Come and get your love
Come and get your love
Come and get your love
Come and get your love
Come and get your love
Come and get your love, now
Come and get your love
Come and get your love
Come and get your love, now
Come and get your love
Come and get your love
Come and get your love, now
Come and get your love
Come and get your love
Come and get your love, now
Come and get your love
Come and get your love
Come and get your love
Come and get your love
Hail (hail)
What's the matter with you feel right
Don't you feel right baby
Hail, oh yeah
Get it from the main vine, all right
Come and get your love
Come and get your love
Come and get your love
Come and get your love
