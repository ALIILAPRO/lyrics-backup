		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I feel bad, bad, bad about it
I feel bad, bad, bad about it

You gon' wait until way past midnight
Just to catch me up when I come home
You stay up to wait for my headlight
Shine across the window so you know (yeah)
I should tone it down while I can't but
I been real loud, hoping you'll sleep it off
I been way across town and I've been down
I've been fucking around and I've been caught

I feel bad, bad, bad about it (bad about it)
But I wanna do it again (do it again, do it, do it again)
I feel bad, bad, bad about it (bad about it)
But I wanna do it again (do it again)

You say

You say, "How could you ever
Treat me like you ever?" (How could you ever treat me like you ever?)
You say, "How could you ever
Treat me like you ever?" (How could you ever treat me like you ever?)

You say

You gon' wait until way past midnight
Just to catch me up when I come home
You don't sleep until I apologize
For everything that I have done
I could say all the right things that you
Want me to and then we be all good
But I'd be lying if I told you
I wouldn't do it again 'cause I would

I feel bad, bad, bad about it (bad about it)
But I wanna do it again (do it again, do it, do it again)
I feel bad, bad, bad about it (bad about it)
But I wanna do it again (do it again)

You say, "How could you ever
Treat me like you ever?" (How could you ever treat me like you ever?)
"How could you ever
Treat me like you ever?" (How could you ever treat me like you ever?)

I feel bad, bad, bad about it (bad about it)
But I wanna do it again (do it again, do it, do it again)
I feel bad, bad, bad about it (bad about it)
But I wanna do it again (do it again)

You say
