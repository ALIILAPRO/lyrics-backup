		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't, I can't
I can't, I can't

When the bells ring out in the streets of town
I can't be found anywhere near 'em (I can't), oh
I'ma get long-gone like a leavin' song
But I'll sin if you would, hopin' that'll hear 'em, oh whoa

I ain't tryin' to avoid that place
But I don't know what else to do
I don't wanna see her face
Sittin' in the front pew

I'll still do my prayin' but I'll do it somewhere else
Ain't it crazy how an angel can drag a man through hell?
Oh, I know Sunday mornin' she'll come walkin' through that door
So, Lord, forgive me
I can't go to church anymore

I can't, I can't
I can't go to church anymore
I can't, I can't
I can't go to church anymore

Now, it ain't fair that we gotta share
The same place where everybody does their healin', oh whoa
'Cause if she's in there, I'll just stare
And I won't hear a thing that preacher's preachin'

I'll still do my prayin' but I'll do it somewhere else
Ain't it crazy how an angel can drag a man through hell?
Oh, I know Sunday mornin' she'll come walkin' through that door
So, Lord, forgive me
I can't go to church anymore
Can't go to church anymore
Oh whoa oh

She gets the church
She gets the Bible
I get the hurt
I get the bottle

I ain't tryin' to avoid that place
But I don't know what else to do (I don't know what else to do)
I don't wanna see her face
Sittin' in the front pew
With someone new

So I'm gonna do my prayin' but I'll do it somewhere else (I'll do it somewhere else)
Ain't it crazy how an angel can drag a man through hell?
Oh, I know Sunday mornin' she'll come walkin' through that door (yeah, she'll come walkin')
So, Lord, forgive me (forgive me)
I can't go to church anymore (I can't, I can't)
Can't go to church anymore (I can't, I can't)
(Can't go to church anymore) oh, yeah

She gets the church
She gets the Bible (she gets the Bible)
I get the hurt (I can't, I can't)
I get the bottle

I can't, I can't
I can't go to church anymore
I can't, I can't
I can't go to church anymore
I can't, I can't
I can't go to church anymore
I can't, I can't
I can't go to church anymore
