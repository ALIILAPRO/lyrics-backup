		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sometimes I'm missin' you, missin' you
You know I'll do anything to bring you back to me
Sometimes I'm missin' you, missin' you
How can I bring you back to me?
Sometimes I'm missin' you, missin' you
You know I'll do anything to bring you back to me
Sometimes I'm missin' you, missin' you
How can I bring you back to me?

Been slidin' all year, I don't know when it's finna stop
It could be a lil' long, don't know when it's finna drop
All I know is I'ma grind, do me, and you can watch
Sit back, think they heard about me sittin' at the top
If I went broke, they'd be like, "Oh well, how you lose your spot?"
The industry could cancel me, I can't be who I'm not
And I don't care for you to understand every line I drop
Just know I came from nothin', my garage costs like a lot
They be fakin' views, bots, fuck the bands, who's hot?
I'm exactly who I say I am, pussy, you's not
We don't pick and choose shots, go for anybody
Tryna act up, don't spare nobody

Nobody, nobody
Back to the wall, it was nobody
Nobody, nobody
Nobody

If I ain't see that way perform, I'd play death
Nowadays you gotta put niggas to the test
How was you my brother and you sayin' you gon' step?
Nigga shot me in my neck and you left
Five in my chest, no one around
I couldn't picture nothin' but you holdin' me down
It was nobody, it was nobody, nobody, yeah
Trauma in my head but I smile for the fakes
Mama hurt, knowing my life wild as a bitch
This the shit I'd spend a hundred thousand for this
Chain bust, bitches goin' wild for the glis'
One of them niggas, yeah, that's the reason why they hate me
That's one the reasons why I can't walk with it on safety
I'ma stack every chance given, can't paste me
I can't let a nigga bake me

Nobody, nobody
Back to the wall, it was nobody
Nobody, nobody
Nobody

Nobody, nobody
Fuck it, I got used to havin' nobody
Nobody, nobody
Cold nights, we ain't got nobody
Who gon' die with ya, nigga? Nobody (nobody, nobody)
Sittin' in this cell, I got nobody
Nobody, nobody (livin' life with nobody)
Livin' life with nobody, yeah
