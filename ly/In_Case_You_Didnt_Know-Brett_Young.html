		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't count the times
I almost said what's on my mind
But I didn't
And just the other day
I wrote down all the things I'd say
But I couldn't
I just couldn't

Baby, I know that you've been wonderin'
Mm, so here goes nothin'

In case you didn't know
Baby, I'm crazy 'bout you
And I would be lyin' if I said
That I could live this life without you
Even though
I don't tell you all the time
You had my heart a long, long time ago
In case you didn't know

The way you look tonight
That second glass of wine
That did it
Mm
There was somethin' 'bout that kiss
Girl, it did me in
Got me thinkin'
I'm thinkin'

One of the things that I've been feelin'
Mm, it's time you hear 'em

In case you didn't know
Baby, I'm crazy 'bout you
And I would be lyin' if I said
That I could live this life without you
Even though
I don't tell you all the time
You had my heart a long, long time ago
In case you didn't know

You got all of me
I belong to you
Yeah, you're my everything

In case you didn't know
I'm crazy 'bout you
I would be lyin' if I said
That I could live this life without you
Even though
I don't tell you all the time
You had my heart a long, long time ago
Yeah, you had my heart a long, long time ago
Mm
In case you didn't know
No, no
In case you didn't know
