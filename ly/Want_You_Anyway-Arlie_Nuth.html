		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was actually lookin' for someone
Someone just like you
I was looking for someone else
I really wanted to move on
Start with someone new
Someone who could take your place
Yea I tried
But then it turns out I just want you anyway (anyway)
Yea I tried
But now I know that I just want you baby yea (baby yea)
Yea I just want-want want you
I just want-want want you
Yea I want-want want you anyway (anyway)
Yea I tried
But then it turns out I just want you anyway
Oh I don't know about you
But girl you know about me
I'm tryna be a better person (yeah I'm trying baby)
So baby count to three, two
I think you're all I need
Cause baby you took me to heaven (yeah you took me to heaven)
I was actually lookin' for someone (oh yeah)
Someone just like you
I was looking for someone else (someone else)
I really wanted to move on
Start with someone new
Someone who could take your place (oh whoa)
Yea I tried (whoa)
But then it turns out I just want you anyway (anyway)
Yea I tried (whoa-oh)
But now I know that I just want you baby yea (baby yeah)
Yea I just want-want want you
I just want-want want you
Yea I want-want want you anyway (anyway)
Yea I tried
But then it turns out I just want you anyway
Oh I don't know about you
But girl you know about me
I'm tryna be a better person
So baby count to three, two
I think you're all I need
Cause baby you took me to heaven
I was actually lookin' for someone
Someone just like you
I was looking for someone else
I actually wanted to move on
Start with someone new
Someone who could take your place
Yea I tried
But then it turns out I just want you anyway (anyway)
Yea I tried
But now I know that I just want you baby yeah (baby yeah)
Yea I just want-want want you
I just want-want want you
Yea I want-want want you anyway (anyway)
Yea I tried
But then it turns out I just want you anyway
