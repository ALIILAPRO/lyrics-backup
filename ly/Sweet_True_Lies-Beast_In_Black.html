		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby, baby tell me more of your lies

Hurt and pain
Still not enough to let go
Have you felt this way?
Is there a cure to endure this deathless woe?
Will I fall and break
Or will true love prevail?

I'm on the edge
How much longer
Can I hold on?

Baby, baby tell me more of your lies
Say you want me for a lifetime
I believe you even when I know it's a lie
Love's so blind
Sweet true lies

Sorrow-bound
I cried all hope into exile
And the monsters prowl
Behind every window and door in my dismal mind
It's the darkest hour
Emotional self-slaughter

Of what's remained
Faith torn asunder
I am burning alive

Baby, baby tell me more of your lies
Say you want me for a lifetime
I believe you even when I know it's a lie
Love's so blind
Sweet true lies

Faith torn asunder
I am burning alive

Baby, baby tell me more of your lies
Say you want me for a lifetime
I believe you even when I know it's a lie
Love's so blind (whoa)
Baby, baby tell me more of your lies
Say you want me for a lifetime
I believe you even when I know it's a lie
Love's so blind
Sweet true lies, yeah
Sweet true lies
