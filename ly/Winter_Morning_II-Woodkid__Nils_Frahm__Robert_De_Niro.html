		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There we're all these millions of people who come through here
cnd I see them all

People of every colour, shape and size
cnd I think about all those people who did... all of those that made it

Made it to some distant shore where when they come up the beach, or over a bridge, or onto a road they start to walk
Then they start walking faster and faster
Then they are running
They made it
They were at last... home

But don't get me wrong
I'm the ghost of all those that never got to get there
cnd the ghost of those who will never get there
