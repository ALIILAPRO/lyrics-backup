		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If half of what I'm saying, of what I'm saying is true
Will you rub my head, make it all shiny and new?
And you drag my coat tails, drag my coat tails down
And I'll be the only cold assed king around.
If you wait I'll give all my aches to you.
Take the chance, to ignore what you're going through?
My cold hand is there for you to take
(If you leave, can I fall down)
I'm your Berlin chair, won't you lean on me 'til I break.

I'll ignore each golden, dragging kiss you can give.
On the blankest face that you ever had to forgive.
If you see my failings, see my failings through.
I'm the re-run that you'll always force yourself to sit through.

If you wait I'll give all my aches to you.
Take the chance, to ignore what you're going through?
My cold hand is there for you to take
(If you leave, can I fall down)
I'm your Berlin chair, won't you lean on me 'til I break.

Well you're too late. You're too late.
You're too late.
