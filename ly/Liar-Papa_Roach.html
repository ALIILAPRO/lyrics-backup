		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, ever since the day I was born
I came in like thunder, eye of the storm
Like a reject with a defect, like the fucked up kid at recess, uh
The heart is a lonely hunter
And one is a lonely number
My life was a white light that I built up, Mr. Nice Guy

But I'm all messed up
There's a good wolf and a bad wolf
But they're both tied up
Gotta starve one, gotta feed one
'Fore it all blows up
Is it too late for a new fate?
Liar, liar your world's on fire

Take my secrets down to the water
'Cause I can't keep them down any longer
I swear to God but he knows that I'm lying
Liar, liar your world's on fire

Hey doctor, I'm underwater
And I can't hold my breath any longer
I swear to God but he knows that I'm lying
Liar, liar your world's on fire

Uh (uh)

I'm coming unglued
I'd better start telling the truth
All of these skeletons they piling up and they ain't gonna fit in my tomb, uh
I better start making some room
My closet, it feels like a zoo
It feels like I've been in a knife fight
A knife fight for my whole life

I messed up
There's a good wolf and a bad wolf
And they're both tied up
Gotta starve one, gotta feed one
'Fore it all blows up
Is it too late for a new fate?

Liar, liar your world's on fire
Take my secrets down to the water
'Cause I can't keep them down any longer
I swear to God but he knows that I'm lying
Liar, liar your world's on fire

Hey doctor, I'm underwater
And I can't hold my breath any longer
I swear to God but he knows that I'm lying
Liar, liar your world's on fire

Better start, start making some room
I'd better start, start telling the truth
I better start, start making some room
'Cause all of these skeletons, won't fit in my tomb (yuh)

I take my secrets down to the water
'Cause I can't keep them down any longer
I swear to God but he knows that I'm lying
Liar, liar your world's on fire

Hey doctor, I'm underwater
And I can't hold my breath any longer
I swear to God but he knows that I'm lying
Liar, liar my world's on fire
Liar, liar my world's on fire
