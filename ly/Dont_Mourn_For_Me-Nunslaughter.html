		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Life is a disappointment
Grief and sorrow for my mother
Humanity has gained absolutely nothing
Regret it's one after another

Broken branch on the tree
Don't mourn for me
Black sheep worst of the two
Don't mourn for me
Less heartache and grief
Don't mourn for me
A horrid soul in the world
Don't mourn for me

Final decision has been made
End taunting wretched madness
Death brings sheer relief
Though it may bring you sadness

Broken branch on the tree
Don't mourn for me
Black sheep worst of the two
Don't mourn for me
Less heartache and grief
Don't mourn for me
A horrid soul in the world
Don't mourn for me

Life is a disappointment
Grief and sorrow for my mother
Humanity has gained absolutely nothing
Regret its one after another
