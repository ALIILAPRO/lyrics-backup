(Run that back, Turbo)

Tryna make a change
Tryna make a dollar when I only had some change
Sittin' inside a one man cell, I tightened up my brain
I can't fuck with all of y'all, I'm tightenin' up my game
Come too far for me to complain
No one came as hard as I done came, fasho
I could've kept goin', but I made a lane for bro
That's what you 'posed to do
If any nigga overstep they boundaries, you supposed to shoot
And it's enough money in it for all of us, I'll post your music
I know that this shit is a fa√ßade, I ain't gon' let 'em fool me
I can't put my trust inside no broad, I ain't gon' let 'em use me
I done put her heart inside my pocket, I ain't gon' never lose it
I done had to stand in front of the judge, and tell him I'm not losin'
Damn, go to sleep, we fuckin', wake up, then we fussin'
Baby, we can't force it, love will run its course
I'll make you call my name until you lose your voice
Me and money married, we fuck off as a couple
Takin' uppers 'cause I don't like to be down too much
But I sip syrup, and I don't play around too much
Take my word, you can't just be down with us, we put in work
Half a ticket on a Phantom just to ride around Atlanta
My lil' boys gon' make the Forbes List, dress my mom up for these award shows
I'm just happy it ain't court dates, I ride 'Raris, I don't horseplay
I'm a grown ass man, gotta have a blicky when I land
You keepin' your business clean, everyone tryna endorse you
I will never stick my dick in no one I pay child support to
I've been tryna build a fortune, got millions for my niece and nephew
I've been playin' the trampoline, whoever fallin', I'ma catch you
If you wanna play that shit so sour, you know I would've helped you
How the fuck you leavin' without me? It ain't no goin' in
My lil' nigga told me it was free, but I still gave him ten
We do what we want, it ain't no askin'

Take your Rollie off when you slidin', they say time will tell
You gon' die or get you some money, or you go to jail
All these choppers will turn the city to a livin' Hell
It was crowded on the elevator, I took the stairs
Lost some people on the way up, but I don't even care
I can't keep you, but for the night, I want to please your body
I want to please your body, I

If it ain't no Wock' then I drink Tris
Can't no promoter book my bitch
Can't name a nigga from Chicago ever said they took my shit
I can't post up like a killer knowin' them niggas killed my twin
We gon' spin 'til we get dizzy, we gon' spin 'til we see him
Child support did me wrong, tried to get me out a M
Only time I hear from them when I post money on my 'Gram
When to Herman, I need a big kit on my Lamb'
She a Ifa, so she keepin' on her beads when she prayin'
My lawyers dogs, when I call, they get richer by the case
I got niggas fuck with dogfood and get richer by the day
I know watches, your shit fake, I could tell a Richard by its face
Real nigga, when I'm around y'all, I be feelin' out of place
The industry ain't let me in, the judge ain't let me travel then
Ain't no solid Percs, I might go take one of them capsules in
And I know some hoes that run they mouth, that's why I don't never see 'em
All my diamonds GIA, certified gems
No cap, got a top tier bitch, she my side bitch
Bitches from the trenches claim they kids on they taxes
How you dressin' better than your kids? You need your ass kicked
I laughed, he wasn't matchin', now he matchin' with his casket

Take your Rollie off when you slidin', they say time will tell
You gon' die or get you some money, or you go to jail
All these choppers will turn the city to a livin' Hell
It was crowded on the elevator, I took the stairs
Lost some people on the way up, but I don't even care
I can't keep you, but for the night, I want to please your body
I want to please your body, I
