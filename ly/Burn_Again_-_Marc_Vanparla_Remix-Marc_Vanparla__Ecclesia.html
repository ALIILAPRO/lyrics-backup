		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Your love is electric
Bumping up in my veins
Lighting up every fiber inside me
A love so magnetic
Pulling me in Your way
Pushing me from the chaos behind me

But if I fall, if I break
I still know You stay the same
As I call upon Your name
Father, hear me as I pray

Come fill me up inside
With heaven's holy fire
I wanna burn again
I wanna burn again

Again and again now
Over and over again

I wanna burn again
Your love ain't a burden
It's everything that I need
A promise given to me, it's my birthright
I'm not in a hurry
I'm hungry to taste and see
I'm not in a rush, oh Lord, I'm on Your time

But if I fall, if I break
I still know You stay the same
As I call upon Your name
Father, hear me as I pray

Come fill me up inside
With heaven's holy fire
I wanna burn again
I wanna burn again

Again and again now
Over and over again
I wanna burn again
