		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here we go again
Everything is fine
I guess we could pretend
We didn't cross a line
But ever since that day
Everything has changed
The way I write your name
The cursive letter A
Whenever it may be
That you go on your way
If you really wanna leave
I'll never make you stay
Whatever you decide
I will understand
And it will all be fine
Just go back to being friends

And love is a kaleidoscope
How it works we'll never know
And even all the change
Is somehow all the same
Turnin' to the left and right
Colors shining in your eye
And even upside down
It's beautiful somehow
It's never just a shape alone
Love is a kaleidoscope

And if you ever find
Someone who could write
A better song for you
Well I'd love to see them try
Put it all in words
And sing it all in tune
There's no one else who could
The only one is you
And if you change your mind
I will understand
And it'll just take time
To go back to being friends

And love is a kaleidoscope
How it works we'll never know
And even all the change
Is somehow all the same
Turning to the left and right
Colors shining in your eye
And even upside down
It's beautiful somehow

Every color of the rainbow
Don't be afraid to hold it close
It's never just a shape alone
Love is a kaleidoscope
