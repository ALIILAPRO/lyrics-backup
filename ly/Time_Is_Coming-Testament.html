		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah! the way I feel, seems to me to be so real
So sick and tired you know just how I feel
Cops they dress in black, they bid their lives
The bribes they stack, so sick and tired
Of the same old this and that

The time is coming, it's too son I can't quite tell
I don't know, I think my world has gone to hell
The time is coming, life it spins just like a wheel
I don't know, that's the way that it makes me feel!

The man I most resent
You might know him through the government
He'll tax our lives the money spent
He's just the president!!!
The land liberty for all mankind and all to see
What's the use, laws a conspiracy

The time is coming, it's too son I can't quite tell
I don't know, I think my world has gone to hell
The time is coming, life it spins just like a wheel
I don't know, that's the way that it makes me feel!

Searching for answers to make life complete
No need to search for more question
There for you to see!

The wars that we must fight
You dodge the draft before, you drive
So sick and tired, why can't, why can't they realiza
The rights they sympathize
Life is just a big disguise
So sick and tired, why can't we live our lives

The time is coming, it's too son I can't quite tell
I don't know, I think my world has gone to hell
The time is coming, life it spins just like a wheel
I don't know, that's the way that it makes me feel!
