		  Nigga, what you say?
Cuban link on right now, swear it cost ya boy bout 72 zones
Nigga, what you say?
Gold Rolie on right now, swear it cost ya boy bout 72 zones
Nigga, what you say?
Big check on me right now, it's like ya boy riding' round with 72 zones
Nigga, what you say?
Fed case on me right now, it's like ya boy pullin' over with 72 zones

Nigga what you say?
Go head nigga act silly, let the choppa go on college, Wet Willies
We cooking chickens in the back, like we at Chili's
All my niggas still up in there, fuck you gon Free Willy
I bought my gold for the gold diggers
Learned about the whip game from the old niggas
They like why they call him Snow? Cause he cold nigga
Singin' yayo song, J. Cole nigga OK
Two bricks in one car
'Bout to get 'em butt naked like a porn star
You know I put 'em back together like a mixtape
Have 'em jumpin' off the shelf like a sextape
If it jumpin' back right, then the sex great
Two cuties, got 'em looking like a pancake
Half a million dollar play with a handshake
Get the pressin' off the check 'til your hand ache OK

All good, need a ace band
And buy 4s all day he the eight man
You really gettin' that cake, then you the cake man
You really whippin' them pies, you the bake man

They say great minds think alike. Know what I'm thinkin' nigga?
A great grind will change your life
That's what I'm thinkin' nigga
I don't care who he is, where he at, where motherfuckin' eva
When it comes to this here, ain't a motherfucker better

Nigga, what you say?
Cuban link on right now, swear it cost ya boy bout 72 zones
Nigga, what you say?
Gold Rolie on right now, swear it cost ya boy bout 72 zones
Nigga, what you say?
Big check on me right now, it's like ya boy riding' round with 72 zones
Nigga, what you say?
Fed case on me right now, it's like ya boy pullin' over with 72 zones

One time I re'd up with a half a ticket
Nigga fucked my order up, bout a half a chicken
Ya check always right, "how can we help you King?"
I said, "Yea, I can name 18 things" OK
500 in a ziploc, some Esay dropped it off in his flip flops
You know we peeled the top back like a T top
Watch the money starting coming, hit the G spot OK
This is something you should understand
When the work drop, same color rubber band
For my ghetto superstar, that really got fans
Let it sit up on the counter, catch a damn tan OK
Stove on and the water running
The yayo told the soda, look the water coming
It's gonna be a lil cool, be prepared
Nigga whatever you do, dont be scared!
I'm bout to get a cooking show on Netflix
And Imma call that motherfucker yea The Best Bricks
'Cause it ain't no limit to this shit, Mia X bitch
Me and this fork and my wrist, we the best bitch

They say great minds think alike. Know what I'm thinkin' nigga?
A great grind will change your life
That's what I'm thinkin' nigga
I don't care who he is, where he from, where motherfuckin' eva
When it comes to this here, ain't a motherfucker better

Nigga, what you say?
Cuban link on right now, swear it cost ya boy bout 72 zones
Nigga, what you say?
Gold Rolie on right now, swear it cost ya boy bout 72 zones
Nigga, what you say?
Big check on me right now, it's like ya boy riding' round with 72 zones
Nigga, what you say?
Fed case on me right now, it's like ya boy pullin' over with 72 zones

Nigga, what you say?
