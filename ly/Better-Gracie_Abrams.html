		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't feel it all
Talk slow and leveled
Foot off the pedal
Same shirt and perfume on
The two of us
Were accidental
But so good together
Now all I feel is

So bad about it
I barely left my bed
We talk around it
All for nothing

So if that's all it was
If you're good giving in, giving up, oh
So if that's all it was
Hope you feel better now
And if that's what you want
If you don't wanna see me at all now
So if that's all it was
Hope you feel better

It's been a while
Old clothes fit larger
You're looking smaller
What happened when I left

Not mad about it
But you've barely left my head
We talk around it
All for nothing

So if that's all it was
If you're good giving in, giving up, oh
So if that's all it was
Hope you feel better now
And if that's what you want
If you don't wanna see me at all now
So if that's all it was
Hope you feel better

I'd turn the car 'round if you'd let me
If you'd let me, you'd let me
You know I'd cry my eyes out 'til I'm empty
'Til I'm empty, I'm empty, oh

So if that's all it was
If you're good giving in, giving up, oh
So if that's all it was
Hope you feel better now
And if that's what you want
If you don't wanna see me at all now
So if that's all it was
Hope you feel better now
Hope you feel better now
Hope you feel better
