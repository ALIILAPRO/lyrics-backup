		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The levee busted
New Orleans
A catastrophe
America, how long we got?
'Cause I'm tryna find her
Is that you?
Ayo, anyway
With no longer delay
That boy Nasir and Chauncey

Long braids, brown eyes
Weigh 135, she like 5'5
I see them thighs on her
Make me want to multiply
She's a queen, her dad a G, I know he rocked to Nas

And I, uh
She was so fly
Like she come from Queens or maybe L.I.
I tried to find that woman
No later than tomorrow
Her body shaped like a Jean Gaultier perfume bottle
When I find her, I'ma roll through
Smooth in the Ghost coupe
Make shorty hop in, listen to BIG's vocals
See if I get a sign of intellectual
See if she rude, if she wild, if she sexual
If we caught a vibe, that'd be incredible
We probably break box springs, near hot springs like we on edibles
I would fit her in my schedule
If she is for real solid, nothing else is acceptable
Slide up to Malibu, paddleboats in Pacific Coast
Having her swim in Atlantic water, it's less cold
I make her listen to poetry, hit a jazz club
Asked her would she'd leave if I was down to my last dub
I gotta find that girl
What block she be on?
Heard she was last seen in Rome
Plane-hopping in Florence

I think she right for me and I don't even know her
I mean the one time I seen her she was naturally glowing
That's why I made this song, told the label promote it
So she can hear it
'Cause even if she don't like rap
This still gon' find her right where she's at
The one with

Long braids, brown eyes
Weigh 135, she like 5'5
I see them thighs on her
Make me want to multiply
She's a queen, her dad a G, I know he rocked to Nas

And if you're listening right now
You know what to do
Post this up right now
At me
