		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell me your day rate
Playing hard to get
Used to be all the rage
I'm contemplating time and space
Counting UFOs and low flying planes
You and me
We're the same way aren't we?
You tell me
The answer to the question on my mind
Hands up hands high
If you don't feel like feeling lonely tonight
Hands up hands high
If you don't feel like feeling lonely tonight
I'm starting to think I'm bad at parties darling
I bet you think that I think it's charming hardly
Tell me that it's fate
And not a hologram
Cuz I can't keep it straight
I'm contemplating my headspace
Wondering how I got here in the first place
You and me
We're the same way aren't we
You tell me
The answer to the question on my mind
Hands up hands high
If you don't feel like feeling lonely tonight
Hands up hands high
If you don't feel like feeling lonely tonight
I'm starting to think I'm bad at parties darling
I bet you think that I think it's charming hardly
Do you ever wonder if all life is
Just one long existential crisis
You try to keep your trust issues private
While trying to make rent and diet
Do you ever wonder if all life is
Just one long existential crisis
You try to keep your trust issues private
While trying to make rent and diet
Whatever
Hands up hands high
If you don't feel like feeling lonely tonight
Hands up hands high
If you don't feel like feeling lonely tonight
I'm starting to think I'm bad at parties darling
I bet you think that I think it's charming hardly
Hands up hands high
Hands up hands high
