		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Waiting for darkness
Doesn't anybody see

Deafened by silence
Doesn't anybody hear.
(I'm waiting darkness)
Playing with fire
But they're screaming
When they're burned
Out of the sunlight
Hasn't anybody learned
I know what they find
Is in their mind
Its what they want to see
Spare me from the light
Here comes the light
And here I'll stay
Waiting for darkness

Promise me rebirth
And then you tear me from the womb
Give me my freedom
And then you lock me in a tomb

I'm waiting for darkness
You gotta believe, you gotta believe its true
I'm waiting for darkness
I just can't concieve why darkness is overdue.

Who knows the answers
Is it friend or is it foe
Don't ask me questions
There are things you shouldn't know
