		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm in front of you with no makeup
In the morning, can you please wake up, babe?
Now you're scarin' me, your alarm's on
Are you sleepin'? Because it's been so long
Guess you died today? And I can't believe it
You lost your soul, you know that you can't start this
Guess you died today? Please give me a sign
At least we know that God was givin' you time

You melt up my body and all my heart
At least now we'll get all the time apart
Guess I'll see you in another life (guess I'll see you in another life)
I guess I'll see you in another life (life)
You melt up my body and all my heart
At least now we'll get all the time apart
Guess I'll see you in another life (guess I'll see you in another life)
I guess I'll see you in another life (life)

(I'm light-headed off the shisha and the cigarette)
(All that shit got me like, ah, ah, ah, ah)

What the, uh, I think someone spiked my shit
You could call me Nirvana, yeah, yeah, you my bitch, uh-uh
Got a chance to slap my demons on their wrist, uh-uh 
You finna move on when you cry for a week 
You don't get me, you don't get me, you don't get me at all, yeah (yeah)
You know sex is my only therapy, yeah
Promise you ain't gon' be with nobody else
Crazy I can't feel my flesh, I feel your love, that's okay

You melt up my body and all my heart
At least now we'll get all the time apart
Guess I'll see you in another life (guess I'll see you in another life)
I guess I'll see you in another life (life)
You melt up my body and all my heart
At least now we'll get all the time apart
Guess I'll see you in another life (guess I'll see you in another life)
I guess I'll see you in another life (life)

(Guess I'll see you in another life)
You don't get me, you don't get me, you don't get me at all, yeah
