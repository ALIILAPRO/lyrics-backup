		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Seems like forever and a day

If my intentions are misunderstood
Please be kind
I've done all I should
I won't ask of you
What I would not do
Oh, I saw the damage in you
My fortunate one
The envy of youth

Why would they
Tell me to please those
That laugh in my face
With all of the reasons
They've taught
Fall over themselves
To give way, oh yeah

It's not a question
Whether my heart is true
Streamlined
I had to pull through
Look for a new
Beginning on you
Oh, I, I got a message for you
Up and away
It's what I gotta do
Give what you have
For what you might lose

What would you say
If I told you that I'm to blame?
And what would you do
If I had to deny your name?
Where would you go if I told you
"I love you"
And then walk away? Oh yeah
N' who should I turn to
If not for the ones
That you would not save? Alright

I told you when I found you
If there were doubts you
Should be careful and unafraid
Now
They surround you
And all that amounts too
Is love that you fed by
Perversion and pain

So if my affections
Are misunderstood
And you decide
I'm up
To no good
Don't ask me to
Enjoy them
Just for you

Ask yourself
What I would choose
To prostitute myself
To live with fortune and shame
Oh yeah!
When you should
Have turned to the hearts
Of the ones
That you could not save, oh now

I told you when I found you
All that amounts too
Is love that you fed by
Perversion and pain
