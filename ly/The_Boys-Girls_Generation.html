		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can tell you're looking at me
I know what you see
Any closer and you'll feel the heat (GG)
You don't have to pretend that you didn't notice me
Every look will make it hard to breathe (T.R.X)

Bring the boys out

Yeah you know

B-Bring the boys out

We bring the boys out
We bring the boys out
Yeah
B-Bring the boys out

Soon as I step on the scene
I know that they'll be watching me
Watching me

Get up

I'ma be the hottest in this spot
There ain't no stopping me

That's funny, stopping me

I know life is a mystery
I'm gonna make history
I'm taking it from the start

Call all emergency
I'm watching the phone ring
I'm feeling this in my heart
My heart

B-Bring the boys out

Girls' Generation make you feel the heat
And we're doin' it
We can't be beat

B-Bring the boys out

We're born to win
Better tell all your friends
'Cause we get it in
You know the girls?

B-Bring the boys out

Wanna know my secrets but no I'll never tell
'Cause I got the magic touch
And I'm not trying to fail
That's right (yeah fly high)

And I (you fly high) can't deny
I know I can fly

I know life is a mystery
I'm gonna make history
I'm taking it from the start

Call all emergency
I'm watching the phone ring
I'm feeling this in my heart
(My heart)

B-Bring the boys out

Girls' Generation make you feel the heat
And we're doin' it
We can't be beat
B-Bring the boys out

We're born to win
Better tell all your friends
'Cause we get it in
You know the girls?

B-Bring the boys out
Girls bring the boys out

I wanna dance right now
We can show 'em how the girls get down
Yes, we go for more than zero
Number one everyone should know
Check this out

All'a boys, all'a boys want my heart
Better know how to rock and don't stop

Oh gee, we make it so hot
Girls' Generation we won't stop

B-Bring the boys out

It's not a fantasy
This is right for me
Living it like a star

Can't get the best of me
I'ma be what I wanna be
This is deep in my heart, my heart

I can tell you're looking at me
I know what you see
Any closer and you'll feel the heat
(B-Bring the boys out) just bring the boys out

You don't have to pretend that you didn't notice me
Every look will make it hard to breathe
(B-Bring the boys out)

'Cause the girls bring the boys out
Girls bring the boys out
Girls bring the boys out
Girls bring the boys out

Girls' Generation make them feel the heat
And we're doin' it
We can't be beat

B-Bring the boys out

We're born to win
Better tell all your friends
'Cause we get it in
You know the girls

B-Bring the boys out
