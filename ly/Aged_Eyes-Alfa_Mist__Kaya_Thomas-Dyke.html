		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's been seventeen days
And I miss you from far away
Heaven knows what's in front of you
Feel like I could hardly breathe
But time goes on, I've had to leave
Without you here, all I have are memories

What if you believe everything
Would they tell you I was different, anything?
The story that we write through those aged eyes
Will you plan to recognize?

If you could believe anything
Would you choose to play it different, everything?
The story that we write, through those aged eyes
Will you plan to recognize?

If I don't speak another word
How much of my truth will be unheard?
Everything is a point of view
Clouds are closing in on me
But life goes on eventually
I'm standing here, living in my memories

What if you believe everything?
Would they tell you I was different, anything?
And the story that we write (we write)
Through those aged eyes (those eyes)
Will you plan to recognize?

If you could believe anything
Would you choose to play it different, everything?
The story that we write through those aged eyes (those eyes)
Will you plan to recognize?
