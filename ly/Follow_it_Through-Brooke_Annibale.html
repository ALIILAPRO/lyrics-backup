		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You say good morning 
I thought to myself, but is it still?
You say no worries 
I thought to myself, I bet I will

You follow it through
Maybe i need some time
To follow it through
Maybe it’ll pass in time

How do you let it all go 
When it’s living in your head?
And how do you take it all back
When it wasn’t what you said?

You follow it through
Maybe I need some time
To follow it through
Maybe it’ll pass in time

How do you find your way out 
Of a maze that you’re in?
When the only advice 
Is to sit and to let it sink in

You follow it through
Maybe I need some time
To follow it through
Maybe it’ll pass in time

You say no worries 
I thought to myself, I bet I will
