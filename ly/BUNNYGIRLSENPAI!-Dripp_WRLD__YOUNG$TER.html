		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wanna call this a love song but
I guess you can call it that hmhm
I feel a connection baby we see eye to eye
Girl you know that you my world, I'll always be right by your side
Think about you all the time girl you just always on my mind
Can't forget about you, baby you my bunny girl senpai
I feel a connection baby we see eye to eye
Girl you know that you my world, I'll always be right by your side
Think about you all the time girl you just always on my mind
Can't forget about you, baby you my bunny girl senpai
You my bunny girl senpai
I get lost up in your eyes
I ain't playin wit you baby I'm not like those other guys
Hop up in the whip lil mama, lets go for a ride
You just chillin in the passenger, I'm gripping on your thighs
Like woah
I really want you
Hit me anytime lil mama imma pull up on you
You can come and vibe with me
Only if you want too
Shawty pulled up on me
Then I know you want too
Uh wait, you are my Bonnie and I am your Clyde
Together we are partners in crime
We gon be together until we die
Shawty you are my bunny girl senpai
Run up on me nigga you gon die
Nigga mad because my girl look fine
Shawty be right by my side
Me and YOUNG$TER be doin it right
I feel a connection baby we see eye to eye
Girl you know that you my world, I'll always be right by your side
Think about you all the time girl you just always on my mind
Can't forget about you, baby you my bunny girl senpai
I feel a connection baby we see eye to eye
Girl you know that you my world, I'll always be right by your side
Think about you all the time girl you just always on my mind
Can't forget about you, baby you my bunny girl senpai
