		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Good for nothing is the name they'll remember me by
Done nothin' with my life for no one, I'm just waitin' to die
I turned my back on the world
You know I'd given up on livin' til I met you girl

Then you came into my life with come hither in your eyes
Pulling me outta the grave what a nice surprise
I die when our nights end, but I only stay dead til I see you again

I lie awake in the night just to see another dawn
Used to be the sun was my weakness but them days are gone
I feel your lips on mine
Will you meet me by the river, baby, one more time?

I'll give you what you wanna have, I'll take you where you wanna go
I'm the only man you'll ever need, girl, and now you know
I'll write your name on my skin, as a promise that we'll never be apart again

I feel alive when I'm with you, baby
So tell me that I won't ever be lonely again
Don't wanna die I wanna wander the world with you
And no one else for the rest of my days on this earth

I turned my back on the world
I wasn't always like this, girl
Do you know what loneliness does to a man?
Turn him into the walking dead
I may have died but your lovin' raised me

I feel alive when I'm with you, baby
So tell me that I won't ever be lonely again
You saved my life I just wanna repay you in kind
Ain't no one else ever tell you you're beautiful, girl?

I feel alive when I'm with you, baby
So tell me that I won't ever be lonely again
Don't wanna die I wanna wander the world with you
And no one else for the rest of my days on this earth
