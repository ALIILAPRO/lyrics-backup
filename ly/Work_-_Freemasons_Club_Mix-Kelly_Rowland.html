		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This ain't gon' be easy
Uh!
You gotta
You gotta
Put it in

Tables turnin' to a situation
Now you standin' in my face like you've been patiently waitin'
I'm rollin' over words, forget the conversation
Thinkin' maybe we can make a combination
Wanna see me lose my breath, and wanna hear me moan
Better be ready, well, and able when we get alone
You was talkin' confident up on the telephone
So you gotta put it in it when we get it on

[Bridge:]
No turning back from this party
Put you through enough to complain, hey!
Ain't no comin' down from this side 
My love don't go nowhere 'less I say
Look at what you got yourself into
Best take advantage, be all that you can be
Best take advantage, see all that you can see
'Cause this could be your last opportunity to move me

[Chorus:]
Check it, baby; get it, baby; check it, baby; get it
Do it, baby, d-do it, d-do it, baby, get it (put it in)
Check it, baby; get it, baby; check it, baby; get it (work)
Do it, baby, d-do it, d-do it, baby, get it
Check it, baby; get it, baby; check it, baby; get it
Do it, baby, d-do it, d-do it, baby, get it
Don't come around if you gon' let me down
You gotta get it all the way in
I wanna see you work

Why you lookin' like you're lookin' for an explanation?
Use the curves in my body for your motivation
Skip the petty games, no need for complications
Use both hands, make sure I reach my destination
Better leave a good impression 'fore you hit the door
'Cause you don't want me talkin' 'bout ya business on the low
If you show it off, I'll have to fit you in my schedule
So you better put it on me when it's time to go

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

I ain't acceptin' no excuses, baby
To brag about it would be useless, baby
You better blow me away, make a girl wanna stay
I just might go another round
(Here's your chance to prove
Don't forget your move
There's nothing to lose)
For me

[Chorus]

Check it, baby; get it, baby; check it, baby; get it
Do it, baby, d-do it, d-do it, baby, get it (put it in)
Check it, baby; get it, baby; check it, baby; get it (work)
Do it, baby, d-do it, d-do it, baby, get it
Check it, baby; get it, baby; check it, baby; get it
Do it, baby, d-do it, d-do it, baby, get it
