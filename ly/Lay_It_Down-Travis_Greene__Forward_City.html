		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  VERSE.1
Why should I worry
Why should I be afraid
Freedom's calling me
To another place
God is waiting
With arms opened wide

VERSE.2
Please don't carry
All that Guilt & Shame
Give it over
He'll take it away
Joy is waiting
Put that Weight aside

PRE-CHORUS
He's never failed ya
He never will
It's not in His nature 
He has something Greater
So Cast your Cares 
On the One who Cares for You

CHORUS
All your Burdens
All your Cares
If its Heavy 
Come & lay it down
Altar's Open
Leave it There
Joy is Waiting
Come & lay it down

VERSE 3
Please don't carry
All that Guilt & Shame
Give it over
He'll take it away
Joy is Waiting
Put that Weight aside

1 PRE-CHORUS
He's never failed ya
He never will
Its not in His nature
He has something Greater 
He's never failed ya
He never will
Its not in His nature 
My God is More than Able
So Cast your Cares on Him 

BRIDGE
God is Faithful
He is Able
He can Handle
Every Problem
Bring Your Burdens
To the Altar
There's an Answer

VAMP
Come & Lay it Down
