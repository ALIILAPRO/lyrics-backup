		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Yeah)
Hey (uh)
(Uh)
Ooh
(Bye-bye, baby, bye-bye)
(Yeah) (bye-bye, baby, bye-bye)
Oh yeah (yeah)

We both know that I shouldn't be here
This is wrong
And, baby, it's killing me, it's killing you
Both of us tryna be strong
I've got somewhere else to be
Promises to keep
And someone else who loves me
And trusts me fast asleep (yeah, yeah)
I've made up my mind
There is no turning back (there's is no turning back)
She's been good to me
And she deserves better than that 

It's the hardest thing I'll ever have to do
To look you in the eye and tell you I don't love you
It's the hardest thing I'll ever have to lie
To show no emotion when you start to cry (please don't cry)
I can't let you see what you mean to me
When my hands are tied and my heart's not free
We're not meant to be
It's the hardest thing I'll ever have to do (oh)
To turn around and walk away pretending I don't love you

I know that we'll meet again (yeah)
Fate has a place and time (place and time)
So you can get on with your life (get on with your life)
I've got to be cruel to be kind (to be kind)
Like Dr. Zhivago
All my love I'll be sending (yeah)
And you will never know (oh)
'Cause there can be no happy ending 

It's the hardest thing I'll ever have to do (oh)
To look you in the eye and tell you I don't love you
It's the hardest thing I'll ever have to lie
To show no emotion when you start to cry
I can't let you see what you mean to me (don't want you to see)
When my hands are tied and my heart's not free
We're not meant to be, oh
It's the hardest thing I'll ever have to do (yes it is)
To turn around and walk away pretending I don't love you

(Bye-bye, baby, bye-bye)
Maybe another time, another day (you know I'll get through it, girl)
(Bye-bye, baby, bye-bye) as much as I want to, I can't stay
Oh, I've made up my mind
There is no turning back
She's been good to me
And she deserves better than that

It's the hardest thing I'll ever have to do (yeah, oh)
To look you in the eye and tell you I don't love you
It's the hardest thing I'll ever have to lie
To show no emotion (oh no) when you start to cry (oh baby, yeah)
I can't let you see what you mean to me
When my hands are tied and my heart's not free
We're not meant to be, oh no
It's the hardest thing I'll ever have to do (oh)
To turn around and walk away (turn around) pretending I don't love you

(You know I'll get through it, girl) (yeah, yeah)
(I'm livin' a lie)
Don't wanna live a lie
Oh yeah
What can I do? (Bye-bye, baby, bye-bye)
Yeah (bye-bye, baby, bye-bye)
Ooh (bye-bye, baby, bye-bye)
Ooh, baby, oh yeah (bye-bye, baby, bye-bye)
What to do, yeah, yeah
