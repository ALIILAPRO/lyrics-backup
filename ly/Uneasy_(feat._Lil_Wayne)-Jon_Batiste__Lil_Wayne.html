		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Skoo, skoo, skoo, skoo)
They call out
Mercy, mercy, Marcy me
Clinton and Canarsie be like
(Skoo, skoo, skoo, skoo)
They call out
Nostradamus, Malcolm, Marvin, saw what's going on
I know the left and the right talkin'' two different stories
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
I know I'm strong in this life but I still tuck my chain
The city feels uneasy
The only way I can describe
Describe describe it
The city feels uneasy
The only way that I can describe
Describe, describe it
The city feels so uneasy

(Skoo, skoo, skoo, skoo)
They call out
Times are changing, mama's favorite
Creepin' through the club at midnight
(Skoo, skoo, skoo, skoo)
They cry out
Now they're back in the pew
At the crow of the rooster crawling into the light
Left and the right talkin' two different stories
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
I know I'm strong in this life but I still tuck my chain
The city feels uneasy
The only way that I can describe
Describe, describe it
The city feels uneasy
The only way that I can describe
Describe, describe it
The city feels so uneasy

It's a revelation
The city feels uneasy
The only way that I can describe
Describe, describe it (describe)
The city feels uneasy
The only way that I can describe (they call out my name)
Describe, describe it
Yeah, the city feels so uneasy

Easy
Easy, yeah
Easy

So uneasy

Uh, times is hard, and the city's uneasy
Been a carnivore ever since I was teething
Close the shower door on my city, it's steaming
I know I'm the god that my city believes in
Amen menage
The devil been deceiving me
Had me on the hardtop, thinking it was easy street
Mama used to scream at me, and take me off that scenery
I been about a bag 'cause all I wanted was to be a G
That's that New Orleans in me, I come from where the demons be
The dungeons and the dragons, I just asked them not to breathe on me
Shit get difficult then shit get nasty in the easy E
You don't know what it mean to me
These mean streets, ain't mean to me
Gangster shit
Life is a bitch, until she ain't your bitch
The streets colder than the streets in Anchorage
Swisher on my hip, make me walk like my ankle twist
God damn
They call out
Weezy, baby
This city is uneasy, baby
Yeah
Me and Mr. Batiste
Louisiana

They call out

This that fire

Lil' Weezy, on the guitar ladies and gentleman
