		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All my life remember praying just to make
It home again all my life
Pile the money just to spend it
All again all my life
Focused up on watching who
I'm calling friends
Cause they vouching for the end of me
Why they vouching for the end of my life
Most the brothers still ain't home missing
Them crazy still in them cages

Member the days I wasn't home chasin
The money I wasn't patient
Bullets pinging made it home should be
A blessing I say my graces
Streets will leave you all alone hug on your
Loved one is bound to take them
Still we on the back block shitting
And we on the back blocks sinning
Don't care if you close friends with him
You sharing the sandbox with him
Cause anit no buck buck gang 40
Shot gang walking out two
Oh you don't understand slang means the
20 shot share from out two
Trust no nigga I don't trust nobody
Ain't a killer you ain't shot nobody
Tell me how you drillin you
Ain't got no bodies
Man you can call us culkins
I'm from the block along with the ten
Man you can call us culkins
The pushing the stuffin collecting the bread
Man you can call us culkins
This shit is new to you what
It might do to you them niggas worried
40 so beautiful can't wait to shoot at
Since she want to get dicked
Down that's her business
Look but not to mention they know we
Don't give a fuck but no consequences
Too many nights when I had to fight
What can they tell me about the trenches
Almost lost my sense
So if my name is ever mentioned just
Tell the judge send a sentence cause
Anit no tellin where I'm from
Tell them where I'm from
Niggas know their lesson bro keep that sh
Keep that strap and watch
Your back they planning close casket
Ain't no relaxing tax em pay that pension
I put my trust in brothers nobody
Else we ain't trusting nobody else
I gave my heart to my bitch ain't
Nobody don't got shit for nobody else
Look how we started this shit with
Nobody help never needed nobody help

Remember praying just to make it home again
Pile the money just to spend it
All again all my life
Focused up on watching who
I'm calling friends
Cause they vouching for the end of me
Why they vouching for the end of my life
