		<p>
		  Ohhhhhh oooooooo    oooooooooooooooooh yeah 
Oh yeah oh yeah 

Look at me
It really was not easy 
But I can breathe 
And I'm so grateful â€˜cause I can see 
I am free 
To do exactly what I please
So come with me
To a place where we can be  ohhh oh oh oh oh oh ........

Chorus:
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh I want to touch the sky I want to fly so high
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh I want to hold you I want to love you tonight
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh I want to touch the sky I want to fly so high
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh I want to satisfy I want to make you cry

Follow me
To a place where we can be absolutely free
To be exactly what you want to be completely 
Lose control that's why I need you more
Give me the key to set your heart and spirits free ooohhhhh yeeeaaahhh

Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh I want to touch the sky I want to fly so high
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh I want to hold you I want to love you tonight
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh I want to touch the sky I want to fly so high
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh I want to satisfy I want to make you cry

I know what I want and I know that I need it right now
Gonna take you on a journey to a far away place now 
Gonna take you on a journey to a far away place now........uhhhhhhh

Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh I want to touch the sky I want to fly so high
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh I want to hold you I want to love you tonight
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh I want to touch the sky I want to fly so high
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh I want to satisfy I want to make you cry

Ohhhh like a bird in the sky just a you and I
I'm gonna fly like a bird in the sky just a you and I
We're gonna fly like a bird in the sky just you and I

Repeat 4 x till fades
I want to love you now
I want to take you high
I want to give you everything that you desire
