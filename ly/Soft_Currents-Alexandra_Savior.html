		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Seven years
I've had seven years of bad luck
And I'm just fine
Happiness
I find happiness in the wrong places
Every time

My fate is at the hands of my mistakes
And that's alright

All the tears
All the tears I've shed, love
And I'm still crying
Happiness
I find happiness in the wrong places
Every time

My fate is at the hand of my mistakes
And that's alright
My fate is in your hand
Without you even trying
My fate is at the hands of my mistakes
And that's alright
