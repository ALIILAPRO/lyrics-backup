		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Count every second
On false emotion
Erase the memory
An absence of reality

Made mistakes from dead mind
Allowing heart to see
Losing all the sanity

Another reflections
Reveal an empty gaze
Stare in dead silence
Wearing too-many face

Slowly take away

Will it slowly taking out on faith?
It losing reflection
Distorting direction
Weaves a way into an unknown fate
There's nothing left to see
Annihilate reality

Every minute pass
On broken hourglass
Roaming in nothing
An attempt for escaping

Climb the hill of emptiness 
Without definite direction
Saw the sign of helplessness
With all the sentence in fiction

Will it slowly taking out on faith?
It losing reflection
Distorting direction
Weaves a way into an unknown fate
There's nothing left to see
Annihilate reality

Another reflections
Reveal an empty gaze
Stare in dead silence
Wearing too-many face

Will it slowly taking out on faith?
It losing reflection
Distorting direction
Weaves a way into an unknown fate
There's nothing left to see
Annihilate reality
