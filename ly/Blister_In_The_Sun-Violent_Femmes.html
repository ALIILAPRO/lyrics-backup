		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I'm out walking
I strut my stuff
And I'm so strung out
I'm high as a kite
I just might stop to check you out

Let me go on
Like I blister in the sun
Let me go on
Big hands, I know you're the one

Body and beats
I stain my sheets
I don't even know why
My girlfriend, she's at the end
She is starting to cry

Let me go on
Like I blister in the sun
Let me go on
Big hands, I know you're the one

When I'm out walking
I strut my stuff
And I'm so strung out
I'm high as a kite
I just might stop to check you out

When I'm out walking
I strut my stuff
And I'm so strung out
I'm high as a kite
I just might stop to check you out

Body and beats
I stain my sheets
I don't even know why
My girlfriend, she's at the end
She is starting to cry

When I'm out walking
I strut my stuff
And I'm so strung out
I'm high as a kite
I just might stop to check you out

Let me go on
Like I blister in the sun
Let me go on
Big hands, I know you're the one
