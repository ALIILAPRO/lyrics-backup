Don't play no games, mayne

Load it up, load it up (loaded)
Load it up, load it up (loaded)
Load it up, load it up (loaded)

Load it up, load it up (loaded)
Load it up, load it up (loaded)
Load it up, load it up (loaded)

(And this chicken) Can't fold it up
(If you got it) Hold it up
(Out the door) Load it up

Juicy J the G.O.A.T. (G.O.A.T.)
My joint long as a rope (rope)
Lil' mama, roll it, lick it, light it
I want all the smoke (smoke)
I don't want relations, baby, I just wanna poke (poke)
Know all them niggas money funny, I can take a joke (haha)
What's that in my cup? Hol' up
What's that in your chain? (Chain)
Boy, your diamonds cloudy, it's a heavy chance of rain (damn)
Bro stay in your lane (lane)
We don't ball the same (hmm)
Quarter million dollar watch, I left it plain Jane (Jane)
Bitch, don't act sadity ('dity)
You with the big ol' titties (titties)
You got million followers but drive a Honda Civic (ooh)
Nigga ain't playin' with me, they already know what's up
Like a U-Haul truck, bitch, I'm always loaded up (yeah)

Load it up, load it up (loaded)
Load it up, load it up (loaded)
Load it up, load it up (loaded)

Load it up, load it up (loaded)
Load it up, load it up (loaded)
Load it up, load it up (loaded)
(My account) Load it up
(And this chicken) Can't fold it up (yeah)
(If you got it) Hold it up (ayy)
(Out the door) Load it up (check it)

Load it up and let it ride, we ain't fuckin' with the other side (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Rollercoaster with these bullets, bitch, 'cause I'ma let 'em ride
Last nigga tried to rob, swear to God that nigga died (yeah, grrrr)
Fell in love with killin', bitch, I'm tryna catch a homicide
Ayy, bitch, I'm loaded like potatoes
I want the bread just like tomatoes (yeah)
And if a nigga want some beef, bitch, you know that I'ma K 'em
And I'ma feed his ass hollows, Glocks yeah we pop those (pop those)
Give a nigga shells like he orderin' some tacos
She see my pockets, yeah, a nigga loaded
These bitches flat, just like a nigga bloated
Bitch, my money real long, I can't even fuck
Glock on my hip, you know a nigga tote it
You know and I ain't gotta show it (yeah, yeah)
If I off this motherfucker, guarantee that a nigga blowin' (bah-bah, bah-bah)

Load it up, load it up (loaded)
