		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You left the planet off,
saying ‘no I didn’t, no I didn’t know!’.
If I switched you off and on
would you still feel love and all that other stuff?
Would you stall me if I
kept unpacking stuff?
Would you feel seen if I
brought up giving up?
You wouldn’t believe me if I said I would’ve let my footing go.
They gave me the night off
if I swore I wouldn’t call home anymore.
I guess the race is on...
do you still get shivers? Still get cold enough?
Come get me in five,
I won’t be alive,
I won’t realise,
I won’t be long.
I won’t realise it too.
