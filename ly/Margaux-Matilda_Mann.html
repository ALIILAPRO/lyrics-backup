		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Another day, another room
With nothing new to say
But pretty eyes to match the sky
And softness in her face
She can't decide and never cries
I think it's just her style
Margaux, stay a little while

Countless hours spent outside
To waste her time away
And overbearing endless staring
Into outer space
I can't recall the time before
I felt so out of place
Margaux left without a trace

Sunday mornings
Are quieter these days
And when do I
Get back the time we wasted?
We both know
There's no one else to blame
Margaux left and nothing felt the same

Another meal in silence
And I don't know what to make
My room is still a mess
And my hair is just the same
I contemplate and wait for something
Just to make me move
Margaux said I'd never loose

Sunday mornings
Are quieter these days
And when do I
Get back the time we wasted
We both know
There's no one else to blame
Margaux left and nothing felt
Margaux left it's for the best
Margaux left and everything has changed
