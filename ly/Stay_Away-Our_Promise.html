		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wasn‘t me
your presence turned me
into someone else
i don‘t want to be like this
do i even exist?

It’s time to take
a leap of faith
each moment
you own it
don’t be afraid
and don’t ever lose focus
on all that you are
and all that you want to achieve

I won‘t bend
I won‘t break
and I don‘t believe that you
know what‘s best for me.

so stay away
No i‘m not like you
i will hold onto
these dreams i chase

it’s easy to say
that it’s so hard to change
it‘s easy to blame everyone else
for your own mistakes
what’s the use of eyes
if our minds refuse to see
you paid the price
became too blind to believe

stay away
No i‘m not like you
i will hold onto
these dreams i chase
till they all come true
I won‘t break like you
Like you
I won’t break like you
Like you
I won‘t break like

sharp teeth
split tongue like a snake
you envy me cause you never pulled it through
ain’t it?
and i wasted my time
for a person you faked to be

Did you ever forgive yourself
for what you never did?
how‘d you die knowing
that you never lived?
there’s truth in the things you say
You’re living a lie
cause you never do it anyway
bro

you never practice what you preach

yeah yeah

I won‘t bend
I won‘t break
I’ll never believe that you
know what‘s best for me

so stay away
No i‘m not like you
i will hold onto
these dreams i chase
til they all come true

I won‘t break like you
Like you
I won’t bend
I won’t break like you
Like you
I won’t break like you
I won’t bend
I won’t break like you
I won’t break like

I won’t be like you
