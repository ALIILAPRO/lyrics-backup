		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Give me the reason
Am I staying or leaving?
Give me the reason to give it one more try
Don't wanna say goodbye

Feels like yesterday
You and I, we were walking around New York City
Hand in hand, man, it was so pretty that day
Standing on the corner in your favourite dress
I was trying to take our picture, my hair was such a mess
Oh, but we laughed so hard
Then you broke my heart

I can't stand to see those tears in your eyes
We should be dancing like we did that night
Give me the reason to give it one more shot
And I'll give it all that I got
Oh, I'd hate to lay that weight on your heart
After all that we did to everything that we are
Give me the reason to give it one more try
Don't wanna say goodbye

Give me the reason
Am I staying or leaving?
Give me the reason to give it one more try
Don't wanna say goodbye

'Cause I've got nothing left
Without your foot on the drum that beats inside my chest
I feel like mirrors and smoke
All of my words are broke, I wanna just throw me in the ocean
It's not that I couldn't see you were in pain
I wish we could talk, maybe no one's to blame
I still want you now, I still need you now
I'm not fooling around

I can't stand to see those tears in your eyes
We should be dancing like we did that night
Give me the reason to give it one more shot
And I'll give it all that I got
Oh, I'd hate to lay that weight on your heart
After all that we did to everything that we are
Give me the reason to give it one more try
Don't wanna say goodbye

Give me the reason
Am I staying or leaving?
Give me the reason to give it one more try
Don't wanna say goodbye

I can't stand to see those tears in your eyes
We should be dancing like we did that night
I want you to know that
We don't have to say goodbye

Give me the reason
Am I staying or leaving?
Give me the reason to give it one more try
I don't wanna say goodbye
