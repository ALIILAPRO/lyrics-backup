		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You used to know me, now you don't
You used to know me, now you don't

You had me 'round your finger, you had me on the floor
I used to be your angel, now I'm walking out your door
You say I'm turning evil, I'll say I'm finally pure
Shine bright in my reflection, think I lost myself be-, be-, be-

You used to know me, now you don't

Held me back, tied me up inside a cage
Had to change my life 'cause I knew you'd stay the same
Couldn't see you were standing in my way
I can see clearly now, now, now

You used to know me, now you don't

Now you don't (now you, now you)
Now you don't (now you, now you, now you)
Now you don't (now you don't)
(Now you, now you)
Now you don't
(Now you, now you, now you)
Now you don't

You had me 'round your finger, you had me on the floor
I used to be your angel, now I'm walking out your door
You say I'm turning evil, I'll say I'm finally pure
Shine bright in my reflection, think I lost myself be-, be-, be-

You had me 'round your finger, you had me on the floor
I used to be your angel, now I'm walking out your door
You say I'm turning evil, I'll say I'm finally pure
Shine bright in my reflection, think I lost myself be-, be-, be-

Held me back, tied me up inside a cage
Had to change my life 'cause I knew you'd stay the same
Couldn't see you were standing in my way
I can see clearly now, now, now

You used to know me, now you don't

(Now you, now you)
Now you don't (now you, now you, now you)
Now you don't (now you don't)
(Now you, now you)
Now you don't
(Now you, now you, now you)
Now you don't
