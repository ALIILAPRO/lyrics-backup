		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Labeled a creation of evil
Ridiculed for their shocking appearance
Sharing both please and pain
Two minds, two hearts, one soul
Separating mentally
An illusion of privacy
Together they absorb each others lives
As One they will live and they will die
A living hell has begun

Displayed as a nightmare
Criticized through words and eyes
As they stare
To the normal it seems grotesque
Connected by a bond of flesh
Two minds, two hearts, one soul
Separating mentally
An illusion of privacy
Together they absorb each others lives
As One they will live and they will die
A living hell has begun
