		  (Need me to feed your ego)

You need me to feed your ego
But you don't need me, seems like you need hoes
Let's keep it simple, send me a signal
Do you wanna be single? You know I need to know

You know you need me to feed your ego
But you don't need me, seems like you need hoes
Let's keep it simple, send me a signal
Do you wanna be single? You know I need to know

You been distant, actin' different
Wish you would listen, guess I'll be wishin'
For a blessin' or a message
Don't you mess with my emotion
Stay out my face, stay out my way
Don't need no man, I just need my space
For what it's worth, I made it work
And now you're hurt, and now it's your turn
On to the next I'm gone
You can go and tell your boys I'm wrong
I don't care who is there, put me on speakerphone
For the whole room to hear I gotta say

You need me to feed your ego
But you don't need me, seems like you need hoes
Let's keep it simple, send me a signal
Do you wanna be single? You know I need to know

You know you need me to feed your ego
But you don't need me, seems like you need hoes
Let's keep it simple, send me a signal
Do you wanna be single? You know I need to know

Why you gotta be so selfish?
I'm not normally so jealous
Why you gotta play so stupid?
Hell no, I didn't wanna do this

But I had to cut you off
Do not call me back
When you're wrong you do me wrong
You just don't know how to act
You try to put the blame on me
You tell me that I need serious help with special therapy
You try to flip the script
I swear you make me sick
I wish I would've saw this coming
You so full of shit
And I'm so through with it
Can't believe it was all for nothing we know

You need me to feed your ego
But you don't need me, seems like you need hoes
Let's keep it simple, send me a signal
Do you wanna be single? You know I need to know

You know you need me to feed your ego
But you don't need me, seems like you need hoes
Let's keep it simple, send me a signal
Do you wanna be single? You know I need to know

Single
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Need me to feed your ego, hmm
