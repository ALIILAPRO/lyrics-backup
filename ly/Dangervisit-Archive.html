		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So much writing on the wall, can you read it all?
Can you see through the haze when the writing's small?
Can you read what it means, is it make any sense?
'Cause it's all dollar bills, and pounds, and pence
Telling you what to do and what pills to take,
When your head's in your hands and your belly aches,
Where to go in the world when you need a change,
Donâ€™t you worry about the bill, that can be arranged

Make me sad, make me sleep, make me question,
Give me things that can calm this depression
Let me know what to do when my money's spent,
Let me know how to smell and to pay the rent,
Let me know what to do when my hair is gone,
Let me know who to kill when the war is on

There's a woman of your dreams and she's on the phone,
Better send her a text when you're on your own
Make me sad, make me sleep, make me question,
Give me things that can calm this depression

So much writing on the wall,
Feel, trust, obey,
Swing your love, swing your love, swing it,
Sleep along, sleep along, sleepless

You know that they cant turn you
Don't want that dreams to waste me
Don't want the dreams to save me
High rises, killing lows
