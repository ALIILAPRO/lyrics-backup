		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I want you
I hold one card
That I can't use
But I want you

You're coming back
And it's the end of the world
We're starting over and I love you darlin'
And I am done, dear

You're in the house
And I am here in the car
I just need a quiet place
Where I can scream how I love you

I found you
I found the door
But when I stepped through
There was no floor

You're coming back
And it's the end of the world
We're starting over and I love you darlin'
And I am done, dear

You're in the house
And I am here in the car
I just need a quiet place
Where I can scream how I love you

I want you
I want you
