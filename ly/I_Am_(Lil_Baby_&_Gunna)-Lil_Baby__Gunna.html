		  Cook that shit up Quay!
Baby, huh

Christian Dior my shoes
They cost a band, I probably won't wear again
Lil Messly just came on the news
I'm thinking damm he back in trouble again
Made me a mil' 'cause I can
I know who I am, and I give thanks to the man
Tiger just jumped out the can
That's my lil' man, right back in action again
That young nigga shit we still on it
My dog going through it I feel for him
She told me she love me I feel for her
Got real niggas sitting it jail for it
Got a pack I put it in the mail for it
On the hunt for the money, I smell for it
Went big dog on them, this Tom Ford
That lil' boy shit I ain't going for
Gettin' money everyday I wake up
Don't ask me did me and lil' shawty break up
Them M's coming in I let 'em stack up
Don't ride my wave dog, back up
I ain't never had shit I gotta act up
Don't come too close, my dogs won't budge
I don't need no help, I don't ask for much
If I ever go broke, we masking up

Run the money up, way up
Life ain't sweet ain't no lay-up
Drip for sale, they gotta pay us
I stayed down and I came up
Stayed the same and they changed up
I knew they was gon' change up
Money never gon' change us
So I just be in my lane stuck

I put the Bentley inside the garage
I don't know how much hate I can dodge
I can get you knocked off with a nod
Four pockets full everyone got a knot
I say this shit from the heart
I knew you weren't real, you weren't there from the start
Anything given way came from God
Go get on stage and I get an applause
Damn Gunna done grow'd up
Bent the Bentley coupe, they know it's us
My bro took a loss and I picked him up
We stick together, they ain't rich as us
I wanna sit down, she ain't lit enough
Every time I count cash swear I get a rush
My money long as the yellow bus
It ain't no secret, I'm livin' plush

Run the money up, way up
Life ain't sweet ain't no lay-up
Drip for sale, they gotta pay us
I stayed down and I came up
Stayed the same and they changed up
I knew they was gon' change up
Money never gon' change us
So I just be in my lane stuck

Run the money up, way up
Life ain't sweet ain't no lay-up
Money never gon' change us
I just be in my lane stuck
Stayed the same and they changed up
I knew they was gon' change up
