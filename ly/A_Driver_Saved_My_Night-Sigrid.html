		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lonely
Sitting in a backseat
I'm wishing this taxi was taking me home

I hate
Losing out on Fridays
But I'm on this highway feeling alone

Tears running down my face
'Til he looks back and he turns it up all the way

And then I feel
I feel a song
Holding me tight
I think a driver might've saved my night

I feel the words
A voice drying my eyes
I think a driver might've saved my night
(I think a driver might've saved my night)

Listen and the clouds are lifting
I look at me different
With every note

Each line sounds like it was read right
Right out of my mind
How do they know?

Tears running down my face
'Til he looks back and he turns it up all the way

And then I feel
I feel a song
Holding me tight
I think a driver might've saved my night

I feel the words
A voice drying my eyes
I think a driver might've saved my night
(You turned me up and change my life)
I think a driver saved my night
(You turn me up and change my life)
I think a driver might've saved my night

A driver, saving me, saving me
Saving me, saving me
Radio, saving me
A driver, saving me, saving me
Saving me, saving me
Radio, saving me

And then I feel
I feel, a song
Holding me tight
I think a driver might've saved my night

I feel the words
A voice drying my eyes
I think a driver might've saved my night

I feel, I feel, a song
(You turned me up and change my life)
I think a driver might've saved my night
I feel the words
A voice
(You turned me up and change my life)
I think a driver might've saved my night
