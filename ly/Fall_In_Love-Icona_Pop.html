		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fa-la-la-la-la fall in love
Fa-la-la-la-la fall in love

You hit me thousands miles an hour, baby
It's like you stripped me off my powers
You got me shakin'
You got me breakin' all the rules
You set my icy heart on fire

I can't control or shut it down
It's taking me over, me over
You make my senses come alive
So this is how it feels like when you
Fa-la-la-la-la fall in love
Fa-la-la-la-la fall in love
Fa-la-la-la-la fall in love
Fa-la-la-la-la fall in love

You got my mind 24/7 baby
It's like you're printed in my code
You got me dancing
You got me dancing
Just for you
Don't think they dance like this in heaven

I can't control or shut it down
It's taking me over, me over
You make my senses come alive, ah
So this is how it feels like when you
Fa-la-la-la-la fall in love
Fa-la-la-la-la fall in love
Fa-la-la-la-la fall in love
Fa-la-la-la-la fall in love

Is it love
Is it love
Is it love
Is it love
Is it love that I feel?

Is it love
Is it love
Is it love
Is it love
Is it love that I feel?

Is it love
Is it love
Is it love
Is it love
Is it love that I feel?

So this is how it feels like when you
Fa-la-la-la-la fall in love
Fa-la-la-la-la fall in love (this is how it feels like when you)
Fa-la-la-la-la fall in love
