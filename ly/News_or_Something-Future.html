		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You know how we be rockin'
Ya heard?

Bright light shinin' all bright on the Bentley
Work the Cadillac, panoramic, no panties
Old school Chevy '55 granddaddy
Gotta throw some salt on it, 'cause you know I'm gettin' at it
Throw the fork on it, then put it in traffic
Throw the sauce on it, got it flyin' out of Dallas
Hope you didn't do it to yourself, that's tragic
Hope you didn't throw away what we established
Hope you wouldn't turn your back on your family
The way a nigga look 'round here, they'll back stab you
Word from your motherfuckin' brother, young nigga
I just wanna see you happy, I just wanna see you happy
Comin' through the cut like a known Grim Reaper
'Bout to get it straight finessed, tryna get a little cheaper
Hold on that clip like a doped up needle
Just hang on that strip with a four Desert Eagle

Known to put a bad hood bitch in some red bottoms
Ayy, where ya mans at? Heard that the feds got 'em
I seen you cruise the Land Rover through the west side
Gold Rolex, better check your peripheral
It's a full moon in the middle of the day
Got them wolves out, rock a little Cartier
Got the trap jammed packed like The Masquerade
Know a few real ones ain't gon' see they next birthday
Tell them young niggas grind
'Fore you gon' knock somethin' down
If they gon' shoot, then shoot somethin'
We better hear 'bout this shit on the news or somethin'
We better hear 'bout this shit on the news or somethin'
Man down over yonder
Young came through holdin' on the K like a drummer
They done took a boss out, nigga, no wonder
Niggas gettin' crossed out, nigga, no wonder
Hoes gettin' X'd out and we on ganja
The police wanna talk, but we won't say nothin'
True to these clips, niggas won't say nothin'
Niggas' true to these clips, niggas won't say nothin'

Had the Parkay jumpin' out the Pyrex
High definition glass on my pinky finger
Niggas swimmin' in the water, no paddle
Niggas tryin' to walk in my shadow
Drop the bird on the bezel, I'm a well known rebel
Told a young nigga Freebandz, Roc-A-Fella
Told a young nigga Freebandz, Roc-A-Fella
You can turn this off and I can kick it acapella
We work the Front Street where Mama said, "Don't go," we went there
Trap house embalmed with that crack, then we went there
Shawty don't fuck with these folks
These niggas be tellin' these days, niggas tellin' these days

Known to put a bad hood bitch in some red bottoms
Ayy, where ya mans at? Heard that the feds got 'em
I seen you cruise the Land Rover through the west side
Gold Rolex, better check your peripheral
It's a full moon in the middle of the day
Got them wolves out, rock a little Cartier
Got the trap jammed packed like The Masquerade
Know a few real ones ain't gon' see they next birthday
Tell them young niggas grind
'Fore you gon' knock somethin' down
If they gon' shoot, then shoot somethin'
We better hear 'bout this shit on the news or somethin'
We better hear 'bout this shit on the news or somethin'
Man down over yonder
Young came through holdin' on the K like a drummer
They done took a boss out, nigga, no wonder
Niggas gettin' crossed out, nigga, no wonder
Hoes gettin' X'd out and we on ganja
The police wanna talk, but we won't say nothin'
True to these clips, niggas won't say nothin'
Niggas' true to these clips, niggas won't say nothin'
