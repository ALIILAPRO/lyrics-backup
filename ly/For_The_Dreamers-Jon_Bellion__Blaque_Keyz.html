		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Like some dope shit, ohh la da da da da da
Like mad people, is it ohh la da da da da da?
Yeah, exactly, exactly ohh la da da da da da
Ohh la da da da da da ohh la da da da da da
Ohh

Yeah, see, it went from talking shit loud
Then graduating to whispers
Still chilling painting pictures
With the hipsters
And since I produced the record
Please hold while I insert
A bassline dirtier than kissing
On your sister (Ew)
Still clearing 30 racks, cigarettes
And leather jackets
Pimp coats, and feathered hats
Lose the phone, never that
My mother's cooking sauce
I'm more Italian than Sinatra's kids
Fashion is a chore to me
I'm partying in moccasins
Rocking with the scholars
Doing shots up with the college kids
Please don't try and copy me
You're cheating while I'm proctoring
Positively optimistic
Hopping on the opposite
Of every single thing they ever told me to do
So put the hate down and watch me spazz out
To sounds that John Lennon would be proud of
Put the hate down and watch us spazz out
To sounds that John Lennon would be proud

Oh, as I take off on an aeroplane
I realize the dream that I'm chasing's true
Yes, I'm afraid of heights
But I'm not afraid to fly

Let me hear the dreamers yell
Ohh la da da da da da
Let me hear the dreamers yell
Ohh la da da da da da
Let me hear the dreamers yell
Ohh la da da da da da
Let me hear the dreamers yell ohh

Yeah, for a proper introduction
This is Keyz without the locksmith
A new year
I'm tired of rapping on that nonchalant tip
You scholars think you can roast
My associate with hot shit? You're hopeless
'cause this bachelor is a master
When a doc spit's work all day and lay back
Collecting bills at night
We're fly enough to make the sell see us
Still we're fearing heights
Waiting to blow, getting impatient
I've been chasing Mr myers with a knife
Flipping the script because I'm killing mics
My entourage is a bunch of
Guys who walk around
Mauling all the moms in every
Mall with their sharpened claws
Not talking Santa or a
Certain type of grammar i'm a standout
Not handing handouts to all your open paws
So put the hate down and watch me spazz out
To sounds that Kurtis Blow would be proud of
Put the hate down and watch me spazz out
To sounds that Kurtis Blow would be proud

Oh, as I take off on an aeroplane
I realize the dream that I'm chasing's true
Yes, I'm afraid of heights
But I'm not afraid to fly

Let me hear the dreamers yell
Ohh la da da da da da
Let me hear the dreamers yell
Ohh la da da da da da
Let me hear the dreamers yell
Ohh la da da da da da
Let me hear the dreamers yell ohh

Never wake up from your dreams
Your dreams, your dreams, your
Dreams, your dreams, yeah
Never wake up from your dreams
Your dreams, your dreams, your
Dreams, your dreams, yeah
Never wake up from your dreams
Your dreams, your dreams, your
Dreams, your dreams, yeah
Never wake up from your dreams
Your dreams, your dreams, your
Dreams, your dreams, yeah
Never wake up from your dreams
