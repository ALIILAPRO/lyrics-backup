		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sometimes you walk by the goods ones
'Cause you're trying too hard, too hard to see them
And sometimes you don't find the right lines
'Cause you're trying, too hard, too hard to hear them
But you know what it feels like, 'cause you're like me
And you won't give up

Till an all time love
'Cause nothing else is good enough
I want an all time love
To find me

Some days you're too set in your ways
And you forget to shut up, shut up and listen
And some days you just have to misplace all your mistakes
Somewhere that you won't miss them
So stop lying that you're fine, cause you're like me
And you can't give up

Till an all time love
'Cause nothing else is good enough
I want an all time love
To find me

I don't believe that it's a failure
I don't believe that it's a fault
'Cause if everything were plain sailing
Oh, tell me what would there be left to exalt

But an all time love
'Cause nothing else is good enough
I want an all time love
To find me

I want an all time love
'Cause nothing else is good enough
I want an all time love
To find me
