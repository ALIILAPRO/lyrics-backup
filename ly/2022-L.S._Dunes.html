		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm not afraid to try
Want to fill this space
With something that I'm not
Chew on the iron

If I can't make it 'til 2022
Least we'll see how long I can swim
Sometimes wish she hadn't found me on the night
I tried to disappear, all at once

The timing wasn't right
I want to see this face
You need this to stay
Chew on the iron

If I can't make it 'til 2022
Least we'll see how much I can take
Sometimes wish she had just let me drift away
Free from any pain, all at once

All at once (ohh, ohh, oh)
All at once (ohh, ohh, oh)
All at once again, oh (ohh, ohh, oh)
All at once

If I can't make it 'til 2022
Least we'll see how much I can take
Sometimes wish she had just let me drift away
Free from any pain, all at once

If I can't make it 'til 2022
Least we'll see how long I can swim
Sometimes wish she hadn't found me on the night
I tried to disappear, all at once

All at once, all at once
All at once, all at once
