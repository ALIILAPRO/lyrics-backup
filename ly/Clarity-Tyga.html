		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  God give me some shit off, fuzzy me
Yo, see what is going on? (in the creep?)

It's time for some clarity
Lookin' for clarity
Look at me, dog, my diamonds got clarity
Say what you want
Your lies can't embarrass me
Your lies don't embarrass me
Fly to an island then fly back in parakeet
I'm in that new Bentley truck
What the fuck nigga you
Still in that Cherokee
Theres no compared to me I'm in my
Mansion and you're in that Air BnB
Ion see you niggas see you niggas
See threw you heard of me
When I see you niggas and you there
Man you just there to me
All in the way, bruh, I don't got a
Jersey on, I ain't come to play, bruh
Oh you throwin' shade, huh?
Take off your shades, bruh
Recognize a don when you see
One, can't see straight, huh
It's time for some clarity
Lookin' for clarity
Look at me, dog, my diamonds got clarity

She drinkin' that drink
She gone off that clear with me
We sippin' that brown, we mixin' it up
We'll be sick in the mornin'
Our flow be sick for so long
Dog I just ignore it
From the rip man I came up so poor
I just keep pourin'
And we don't do shit if it's norm, nah
We do shit enormous
And let's get this shit clear
My Christmas list is the Forbes list
It's time for some clarity
Lookin' for clarity
Look at me, dog, my diamonds got clarity

Say what you want
Your comments don't embarrass me
No your comments don't embarrass me
We just laugh at them shit's, they hilarious
In and out the country so much motherfuckers
Try to swear I'm a terrorist
Flexin with your shooters but your
Nigga don't terror me
Your niggas ain't terror squad
Here go some clarity
You know I'm the best, you scared of success
You should be scared of me
Just blew a bag at the mall, that's therapy
Just gave some swag to you dog
That's charity

It's time for some clarity
Lookin' for clarity
Look at me, dog, my diamonds got clarity

She drinkin' that drink
She gone off that clear with me
We sippin' that brown, we mixin' it up
We'll be sick in the mornin'
Our flow be sick for so long
Dog I just ignore it
From the rip man I came up so poor
I just keep pourin'
And we don't do shit if it's norm, nah
We do shit enormous
And let's get this shit clear
My Christmas list is the Forbes list
It's time for some clarity
Lookin' for clarity
Look at me, dog, my diamonds got clarity

It's time for some clarity
Lookin' for clarity
Look at me, dog, my diamonds got clarity
It's time for some clarity
Lookin' for clarity
Look at me, dog, my diamonds got clarity
