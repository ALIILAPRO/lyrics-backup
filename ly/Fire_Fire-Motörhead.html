		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Foxy, do you have a light?
Can you light me up tonight?
I'd like to see you burn me down
Why don't you let me light your fire?
Why don't you let me stoke you higher?
(Fire, fire) holocaust
(Fire, fire) given up for lost
(Fire, fire) strike one, strike two
(Fire, fire) I'm a match for you

You're quick to learn
I love to watch you burn
Come any time I'll torch you out
Only you can create the flame
Only you can scorch my brain
(Fire, fire) conflagration
(Fire, fire) hellfire, damnation
(Fire, fire) strike six, strike eight
(Fire, fire) I think you're great

You can't put me out
But there ain't no doubt
You ain't nowhere near safe with me
You ain't the first to turn me down
You ain't the first to turn me round
(Fire, fire) big black smoke
(Fire, fire) ain't no joke
(Fire, fire) strike nine, strike ten
(Fire, fire you strike out again
