		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yo, c'mon!
Even if I died a thousand deaths 
when I reserect, I'll still be Meth 
the jams 'ill still be def 
We here, me and this mic-phone be here 
and ain't tryna hear nothing 'cause we had it 
up to here 
lyrics have no dress code 
from KRS to depeche mode 
Kid I'm so cool you catch colds 
at the jump off, it's about to jump off my nigga, speak with tha hand or the gun talk. 
Yo, RZA, we got the clan at the front and police at the do' every exit is laced with see-4, 'bout to blow, like TRIAL I'm passed out, 
MC's is like bitches in thongs, they assed out 
but me the M-E-T-H the O-D, just to real 
I can't be touched and can't feel the monatony, take a picture of my nut sack, carbon copy that, and send it through a fax 
MOTHER FUCKER!

New and improved Wu-Tang style
Turn it up now, y'all done fucked up now
Spit flames (Five mics)
BK (On site)
Bring the pain (All night)
Off the chain (Damn right)

[Scratching by RZA]
"Mister Method Man for short, Mista' Meth"
"Tical, yep"
"Hmmm"

Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, c'mon!
Even if I died a thousand deaths
When I resurrect, through my first born, my name lives on
My verses is like a third degree to young emcees
Buzzworthy on your MTV, the Killa Bees
y'all Jacob, straight up, break up, schemes and plots
Ace up my sleeve, make up like pots and pots
So this is what it's come to (Huh?)
Makin' shots at them kids who use to punk you (Huh?)
Repititious rap shit, don't get nowhere play ya mouth whip
And niggaz can't smoke wit' dry lips so chapped
Bite my shit, I'm like Kojack to get my flow back
in fo' flat, I track you down like a low jack
Spy 'ersus spy, eye for an I can analize the uncivilized
Make them feel alive
You know right from wrong, so know I'm the bomb
It's okay to beast, see the tracks on my arm
Motherfucker

New and improved Wu-Tang style

Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, c'mon!

"Just the Method Man we sought, Mister Meth"
"Tical, yep"
"Hmmm" (repeat x2)

Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, c'mon!
