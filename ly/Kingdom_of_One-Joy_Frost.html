		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  [Verse 1]
First light, a sacrifice
Bird's eye, saw the signs
Cold nights will take your life
Reach out and touch your faith
Give up on everything
To carry the world on a string
[Pre-Chorus]
All you can give, all you can bear
All that you longed for, nothing compares
When nothing is sacred, no one is safe
[Chorus]
So you wanna play God? Come on
Is that all you got? Come on
Would you sell your soul? Burn it all
Everything that you love
Finally become second to none
In a kingdom of one
[Verse 2]
Dig down, far below
Lost souls feed the crows
Hell's fire keeps you warm
[Pre-Chorus]
All you can give, all you can bear
Look to your heart, but nothing is there
When nothing is sacred, no one is safe
[Chorus]
So you wanna play God? Come on
Is that all you got? Come on
Would you sell your soul? Burn it all
Everything that you love
Finally become second to none
In a kingdom of one
In a kingdom of one
[Bridge]
Come on
Come on
Come on
Come on
[Chorus]
So you wanna play God? Come on
Is that all you got? Come on
Would you sell your soul? Burn it all
Everything that you love
Ash to ash, dust to dust
Everything and God above
Shed a tear, shed your blood
No, you cannot give enough
Finally become second to none
In a kingdom of one
