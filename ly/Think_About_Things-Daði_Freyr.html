		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby I can't wait to know
Believe me I'll always be there so

Though I know I love you
I find it hard to see how you feel about me
'Cause I don't understand you 
Oh you are yet to learn how to speak

When we first met
I will never forget
'Cause even though I didn't know you yet
We were bound together then and forever
And I could never let you go

Baby I can't wait to know
What do you think about things
Believe me I will always be there so
You can tell me anything and I'll listen

When we are together 
There isn't anywhere that I would rather be
Three birds of a feather 
I just hope you enjoy our company

It's been some time
And though hard to define
As if the stars have started to align
We are bound together
Now and forever
And I will never let you go

Baby I can't wait to know
What do you think about things
Believe me I will always be there so
You can tell me anything and I'll listen

I might 
Even know what to say
But either way 
At least I'll be there

Baby I can't wait to know
What do you think about things
Believe me I will always be there so
You can tell me anything and I'll listen
