		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Nobody knows how to say goodbye
It seems so easy 'til you try
Then the moments passed you by
Nobody knows how to say goodbye, mm

Nobody knows how to get back home
And we set out so long ago
Search the heavens and the Earth below
Nobody knows how to get back home, mm

Through the darkness to the dawn
And when I looked back you were gone
Heard your voice leading me on
Through the darkness to the dawn

Love is deep as the road is long
And moves my feet to carry on
Beats my heart when you are gone
Love is deep as the road is long, mm

Nobody knows how the story ends
Live the day, do what you can
This is only where it began
Nobody knows how the story ends
Nobody knows how the story ends
