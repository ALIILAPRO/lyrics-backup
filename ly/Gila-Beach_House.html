		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Man, you got a lot of jokes to tell
So you throw your baby's pennies down the well
Give a little more than you like
Pick apart the past, you're not going back

Don't you waste your time
No, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ohh

Gila-a
Gila-a-a-a-a
Gila-a-a-a

Sure you've got a handle on the past
It's why you keep your little lovers in your lap
Give a little more than you like
Pick apart the past, you're not gonna last

Don't you waste your time
No, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ohh

Gila-a
Gila-a-a-a-a
Gila-a-a-a

Hoping for the last ship to arrive
I been blessed with a kingdom, half mine

Gila-a
Gila-a-a-a-a
Gila-a
Gila-a-a-a-a
Gila-a-a-a-a
Gila-a-a-a-a
