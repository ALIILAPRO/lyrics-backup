		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bought a drop top Porsche, about to cut the top off
Trappin' is a sport young nigga get ya knocked off
Hol' up

Turbo switchin' lanes, Hublot switch your watch
Trappin' switch the spots, when you're runnin' hot
Feet on the gas, trappin' dem bags
Run up a sack and never look back
Shorty got miles on her, I'm about to spaz in it
I ran it up fast, I ran it up fast
I ran it up fast, I ran it up fast
I ran it up fast, I ran it up fast

I secure the bag first, I'm ready to boast
I secure the bag first, I'm full of that dope
Court side with a mink
Pee Wee Kirkland on the scene
Five karats, one link
Both hands full of ink
Money drying in your hand
Wrap the bail in Saran
My yellow bitch want a tan
I just landed from Japan
Tokyo and Korea
Panamera to the lear
Yellow metal with the gold
Fishscale with these hoes
Mossberg, I'm drinkin' mud
Put a hit out on a dud
Bought my lil' nigga 12 slugs
Just to shine bright when he rob
I just bailed out a broski
20 pills goin' hyphy
Oh you lookin' real icy
Boy you know you nothin' like me

Turbo switchin' lanes, Hublot switch your watch
Trappin' switch the spots, when you're runnin' hot
Feet on the gas, trappin' dem bags
Run up a sack and never look back
Shorty got miles on her, I'm about to spaz in it
I ran it up fast, I ran it up fast
I ran it up fast, I ran it up fast
I ran it up fast, I ran it up fast

I gave her the raw lean
They sound like my offsprings
Nitro gasoline
Bought some more money machines
Bring out a brand new machine
I bought a whole lot of bling
Treat me like Weezy and Baby
Treat me like Mannie and Turky
I went to juvie with work on me
I had to cop it and purchase
I put more ice on the day today
Rockin' these prezzies and Cartier
I got it and flooded the plain Jane
I made my young niggas insane
Crunchin' dem Xans up and then drink
Get you a Draco and then crank it
Saudi Arabian, Ben Franklin
Leave it to me they would've been stained 'em
Saditty in back, we done got acquainted
You see the dash they gotta see me
I ran it up fast, they can't see me
I went surfin' with you
I buy them Birkins for you
I go to surgery with you

Turbo switchin' lanes, Hublot switch your watch
Trappin' switch the spots, when you're runnin' hot
Feet on the gas, trappin' dem bags
Run up a sack and never look back
Shorty got miles on her, I'm about to spaz in it
I ran it up fast, I ran it up fast
I ran it up fast, I ran it up fast
I ran it up fast, I ran it up fast
