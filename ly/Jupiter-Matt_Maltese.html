		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In every dream I have you're in the car
You're not with him no more, yes it's just us
In every dream I have you're at the bar
Drinking White Russians with me, it's just us

I need you like a fire needs a log
Jupiter couldn't keep me from you
Oh I'm yours
I want you like a dog wants a dog
Jupiter couldn't keep me from you
Oh I'm yours

You say hello and I'm back to the start
I wanna be the screen you always touch
And I'd even be an ulcer in your mouth
Just to be close to you, I'm just so far

I need you like a fire needs a log
Jupiter couldn't keep me from you
Oh I'm yours
I want you like a dog wants a dog
Jupiter couldn't keep me from you
Oh I'm yours

I need like a shore needs a rock
Jupiter couldn't keep me from you
Oh I'm yours
I want you like a dove wants a dove
Jupiter couldn't keep me from you
Oh I'm yours
