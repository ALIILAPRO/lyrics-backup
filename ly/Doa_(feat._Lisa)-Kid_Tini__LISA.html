		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Darkness of the night will you lead me astray
Reaching for my life you see something in me
Can't get you off my mind no ah huh
Something strange is coming over me
He’s right beside me going

Walking while running outta options
I could Uber to the other side of town but my battery life is on
Let me check shit It's on two percent
It ain't nearly enough like the cash I got in my pocket
That’s when I see someone stopping hoping this nigga God sent
In his beat up Cressida
He rolled the window down
I sense a evil demeanour man I should turn around
But where'm I going It's 2AM in the morning
Man fuck it I'm being paranoid
Voice in my head tell me chill stop being hella moist
He looked me dead in the face asked me you need a ride
So I hop in and I'm just hoping I’ll be alright
So where you going
I told him and he just started laughing
Said you’re in luck because that's exactly where I'll be passing
I get a sudden sense of relief and relax a little
Smile on his face reassured me that I could trust a nigga
And so we riding while on the way he be cracking jokes
We chuckle up reach for the dash and he pass me smokes we spark it up
Approaching the gas station he asks if I mind waiting I said nah
Still uneasy can't help it my mind racing
So I waited grateful that I made it this far
He got out and that’s when I start searching the car
I'm wondering what I'm in for
I'm tryna find me some info
Who this nigga what he planning
And what's he so kind to me for
As I'm going down this rabit hole I found some documents that were inside his cabbing hole
I found his ID dating back a hundred years or so
Thinking I'm tripping or some thing this gotta be a joke
He walking back and I can't help but notice his pale skin
He looking back at me with that same grin
Open the car came in
Gave me a drink and told me not to worry he got me covered
So I thought he wouldn't do me dirty
But I still wondered

Darkness of the night will you lead me astray
Reaching for my life you see some things in me
Can't get you off my mind no ah huh
Something strange is coming over me
He's right beside me going
Whoa woah oh oh
Worlds apart worlds apart

So I let it go and keep it moving yeah
Engine running and we're moving
Asking if he got some music
He said nah here's another doob hit
I said nah nigga play the music
You ain't got none nigga bullshit
Here I got some It's some new shit
He's like who's this
I'm like who this are you stupid this Drake
You Know Jay like the Blueprint Magna Carta Holy Grail
I can see he don't relate I could see it in his face
Thinking this is kinda strange
So I ask about his age he said he Twenty Five
When, back in Seventy five
We laugh it off
He hit the gas so I buckle up
We going fast what the fuck is up
He like chill nigga
Fuck how you feel nigga
You needed help going through hell and you met a real nigga
And so we kept on talking and we had some things in common

Told me about life and conspiracies
How he searches for inner peace
He had an empty gaze
Staring at the road so eerily
I'm tryna hide the fear in me
Running from the inner me
I take a closer look at his features
Skin looked like he bleached it
Hands ashy and his nails weren't the cleanest
And a certain smell emerged out the blue
But then he just couldn't smell it
That's the price I had to pay for convenience
Now the headlights flicking from the other side of traffic
Made me notice cataracts in is eyes
I'm thinking that's it nigga pull over I'll be fine here
He said we almost there
Nigga we almost where
He said do not despair
Before I knew it we were at a memorial site
Told me that's where he died and so would I
I watched him age in front of me
And got younger right after he
dragged me out the car and beat my forehead with a shovel
He said this what's become of me
I'm grateful for your company
Thanks for the recovery
And as I try to ask him please
