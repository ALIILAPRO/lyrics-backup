		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When everything is wrong I'll come talk to you
You make things alright when I'm feeling blue

You are such a blessing
And I won't be messing
With the one thing that brings light to all of my darkness

You're my best friend
And I love you (love you)
And I love you (love you)
Yes I do

There is no other one who can take your place
I feel happy inside when I see your face
I hope you believe me
Because I speak sincerely
And I mean it when I tell you that I need you

You're my best friend
And I love you (love you)
And I love you (love you)
Yes I do

I'm here right beside you
I will never leave you
And I feel the pain you feel when you start crying

You're my best friend
And I love you (love you)
And I love you (love you)
Yes I do
You're my best friend
And I love you (love you)
And I love you (love you)
Yes I do
Yes I do
Yes I do
