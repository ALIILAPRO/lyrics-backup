		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You come
Shrouded for them to see
All of the sun
Mmm that you cover beneath
Unrevealed

And they walk
Past you they don't stop to think
All in a rush
To find what you could've been
Would've been

Oh you
You are the translucent amber
Unsung and so misunderstood
Yes you, you are the translucent amber
In a sea of ceylon cedar wood

In the fog
And their line of sight
Clouded up
We are where the wilderness meets the white
Oh, and that's alright

Cause baby you
You are the translucent amber
Unsung and so misunderstood
Yes you, you are the translucent amber
In a sea of ceylon cedar wood

They don't see us
No they don't see us here
We're in hiding from life and we're trying to not disappear

They don't see us
But darling have no fear
Cause our time, it will come
And we'll rise with our eyes as our spear

Oh we
We are the translucent amber
Unsung, but we understood
Yes we, we are the translucent amber
In a sea of ceylon cedar wood
