		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Of all the money that e'er I had 
I spent it in good company
And of all the harm that e'er I've done 
Alas it was to none but me

And all I've done for want of wit 
To memory now I can't recall
So fill to me the parting glass 
Goodnight and joy be with you all

And of all the comrades that e'er I had 
They are sorry for my going away
And all the sweethearts that e'er I had
They would wish me one more day to stay

But since it calls unto my lot 
That I should rise and you should not
I'll gently rise and I'll softly call 
Goodnight and joy be with you all

A man may drink and not be drunk 
A man may fight and not be slain
A man may court a pretty girl 
And perhaps be welcomed back again

But since it has so ordered been 
By a time to rise and a time to fall
Come fill to me the parting glass 
Good night and joy be with you all
Come fill to me the parting glass 
Good night and joy be with you all
