		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Project, Project, Project X)
We poppin' bottles, go full throttle, with a car full, not enough
Money doubled, supermodels tryna swallow all my nut
I let 'em go down, so I can pick 'em up
We letting go now, I could never give it up
We poppin' bottles, go full throttle, with a car full, not enough
Money doubled, supermodels tryna swallow all my nut
I let 'em go down, so I can pick 'em up
We letting go now, I could never give it up
We poppin' bottles, go full throttle, with a car full, not enough
Money doubled, supermodels tryna swallow all my nut
I let 'em go down, so I can pick 'em up
We letting go now, I could never give it up
I could never give it up, these girls can never get enough
Poppin' bottles after bottles, keep on fuckin' up my health
All we do is crack seals, bitch my doctor my plug
Makin' money, signin' deals
Doin' drugs, you better pop, pop, pop, pop, pop some pills
We can't stop, stop, stop, stop, stop countin' bills
We the hottest in the party, everybody know it's real
Until you start poppin' some mollies, then you'll know how it feel
We poppin' bottles, go full throttle, with a car full, not enough
Money doubled, supermodels tryna swallow all my nut
I let 'em go down, so I can pick 'em up
We letting go now, I could never give it up
We poppin' bottles, go full throttle, with a car full, not enough
Money doubled, supermodels tryna swallow all my nut
I let 'em go down, so I can pick 'em up
We letting go now, I could never give it
You better pop, pop, pop, pop, pop some pills
We can't stop, stop, stop, stop, stop countin' bills
We the hottest in the party, everybody know it's real
Until you start poppin' some mollies, then you'll know how it feel
Take it off, tell 'em straight up, let 'em know what's next
Break it all, fuck the place up, like it's Project X
Take it off, tell 'em straight up, let 'em know what's next
Break it all, fuck the place up, like it's Project X
Break it all, fuck the place up, like it's Project X
Break it all, fuck the place up, like it's Project X
Break it all, fuck the place up, like it's Project X
Break it all, fuck the place up, like it's
We poppin' bottles, go full throttle, with a car full, not enough
Money doubled, supermodels tryna swallow all my nut
I let 'em go down, so I can pick 'em up
We letting go now, I could never give it up
We poppin' bottles, go full throttle, with a car full, not enough
Money doubled, supermodels tryna swallow all my nut
I let 'em go down, so I can pick 'em up
We letting go now, I could never give it up
