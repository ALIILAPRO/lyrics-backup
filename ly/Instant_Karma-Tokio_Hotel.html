		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Instant Karma's gonna get you
Gonna knock you right on the head
You better get yourself together
Pretty soon you're gonna be dead
What in the world you thinking of
Laughing in the face of love
What on earth you tryin' to do
It's up to you, yeah you

Instant Karma's gonna get you
Gonna look you right in the face
You better get yourself together darling
Join the human race
How in the world you gonna see
Laughing at fools like me
Who on earth d'you think you are?
A superstar? Well right you are

Well we all shine on
Like the moon and the stars and the sun
Well we all shine on
Every one, come on

Instant Karma's gonna get you
Gonna knock you off your feet
Better recognize your brothers
Every one you meet
Why in the world are we here?
Surely not to live in pain and fear
Why on earth are you there?
When you're everywhere
Come and get your share

But we all shine on
Like the moon and the stars and the sun
And we all shine on
Come on and on and on on on

Yeah yeah, alright, ah haa, aaaahh  

But we all shine on
Like the moon and the stars and the sun
And we all shine on
On and on and on on and on
But we all shine on
Like the moon and the stars and the sun
But we all shine on
