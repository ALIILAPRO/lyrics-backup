		  Yuh
Oh whoa
I don't really know what
To do
I just wanna go back
To you
I hate that you're really gone
Can't take being alone

Yuh
I know
You ain't really wanna hold me close
You just couldn't wait to let me go
Oh
So let me go
I'm turning to the tabs and to the Shrooms
I can see the energy in this room
I'll leave from this vicinity to the moon
But the tears keep falling for you

What's next
I ain't really want another ex
Can we just talk
You saw my texts
Please don't leave me here on read
I'm begging
For you to come and save me
The simulations breaking
Everybody here is faking
Nobody gives a damn
I need you
You don't need me
Everything in life is fleeting
You say you'll always be there
But I know one day you'll leave me
Popped off
I just wanna pull up in a drop top
So I gotta keep on grinding
No I can't stop
Everyday is a reminder that my soul is gone
I'm so fucking lost

Yuh
I know
You ain't really wanna hold me close
You just couldn't wait to let me go
Oh
So let me go
I'm turning to the tabs and to the Shrooms
I can see the energy in this room
I'll leave from this vicinity to the moon
But the tears keep falling for you
I'm falling for you
I don't even care if you knew
Gotta cut the past off
Start new
Baby just back up
We're through
Baby just say you ain't have time for me
But you do
With your friends
I know you're not busy
Now you wonder why I act all pissy
I know you're doing shit
And I know you don't miss me
I don't see us falling in love
You took what's mine
Now I am stuck

Yuh
Oh whoa
I don't really know what
To do
I just wanna go back
To you
I hate that you're really gone
Can't take being alone
