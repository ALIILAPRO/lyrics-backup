		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I just wanna show you that I can do better
Baby, I won't stop
'Til you let me give you what you want
'Til you let me give you what you want

I'll do whatever to spoil you
Trippin' 'bout you like I'm runnin' on oil
You a queen, your whole demeanor is royal
I just wanna caress, rough sex, break you down, and adore you
But, first, let me know what's on your mind
Lookin' like it's somethin' all wrong, I can see the signs
I ain't here to judge you, truly, I'm honesty not the kind
So perfect, I'm a player, but, for you, I'd get in line
The type of vibe I'd still gon' fall in love with bein' blind
Don't know how to approach her, heard you got a man, damn 
I'm a fan, really am, just don't wanna do the most
You got me in my feelings, late night writin' in my notes
Like, "Girl, I'm rich, I'm pretty sure he in a different boat"
Wanna take your time? No problem, girl, that's fine
I understand it's probably many out there want you, I'm
Not the only one, trust me, I ain't dumb
But I'ma keep applyin' pressure 'til you don't see nothin'

I just wanna show you that I can do better
Baby, I won't stop
'Til you let me give you what you want
'Til you let me give you what you want

Smokin' blunts to the face
Just thinkin' 'bout you got me stuck in the space
Heart pumpin' like I'm duckin' the jakes
You don't want no debate
Put me in that mood, nothin' can relate
I'm a superstar, I don't really chase
But you're too smooth, like a cup full of Ace
Heard you got goals, let me know what I could embrace
For your heart cold, tell me what I gotta erase
Got a dark soul but with you I kinda feel safe
Never feel out of place
Hit me, I'll be there, quickly
No, it ain't too big a problem I'll face 'bout you
I'm with what you with, girl, I won't never doubt you
Know it ain't no nigga in this world could outdo
What I'm willin' to do for your love
Your smile, your kisses, your hugs
I'm just fucked up about you so, uh

I just wanna show you that I can do better
Baby, I won't stop
'Til you let me give you what you want
'Til you let me give you what you want
