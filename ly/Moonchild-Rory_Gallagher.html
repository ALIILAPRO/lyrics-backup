		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You are a moonchild and, pretty soon child
I've got that feeling that
I'm gonna make you smile forever if I can
Just give me a sign and I'll show you my plan

You are a blue child, forever true child
You know that I'll try to
Paint the skies blue forever if I can
Just give me a sign and I'll show you my plan

Tell me why you look so sad
Time slips by like grains of sand
Just put your future in my hands

Tell me, tell me why you look so sad
Time slips by like grains of sand
Just put your future in my hands

You are a moonchild and, pretty soon child
I've got that feeling that
I'm gonna make you smile forever if I can
Just give me a sign and I'll show you my plan

Just show me a smile and I'll show you my plan
Just give me a sign and I'll show you my plan
