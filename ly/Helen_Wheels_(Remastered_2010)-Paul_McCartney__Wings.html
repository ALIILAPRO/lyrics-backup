		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Said farewell to my last hotel
It never was much a kind of a bode
Glasgow town never brought me down
When I was heading out on the road
Carlisle city never looked so pretty
And the Kendal freeway's fast
Slow down driver want to stay alive
I want to make this journey last

Helen, hell on wheels
Ain't nobody else gonna know the way she feels
Helen, hell on wheels
And they never gonna take her away

M six south down to Liverpool
Where they play the west coast sound
Sailor Sam he came from Birmingham
But he never will be found
Doing fine when a London sign
Greets me like a long lost friend
Mister Motor won't you check her out
She's got to take me back again

Helen, hell on wheels
Ain't nobody else gonna know the way she feels
Helen, hell on wheels
And they never gonna take her away

Got no time for a rum and lime
I want to get my right foot down
Shake some dust off of this old bus
I gotta get her out of town
Spend the day up on the motorway
Where the carburetors blast
Slow down driver want to stay alive
I want to make this journey last

Helen, hell on wheels
Ain't nobody else gonna know the way she feels
Helen, hell on wheels
And they never gonna take her away

Say bye bye
