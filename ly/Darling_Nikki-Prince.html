		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I knew a girl named Nikki
I guess you could say she was a sex fiend
I met her in a hotel lobby
Masturbating with a magazine
She said, "How'd you like to waste some time?"
And I could not resist when I saw little Nikki grind

She took me to her castle
And I just couldn't believe my eyes
She had so many devices
Everything that money could buy
She said, "Sign your name on the dotted line"
The lights went out
And Nikki started to grind

Uh, Nikki

The castle started spinning
Or maybe it was my brain
I can't tell you what she did to me
But my body will never be the same
Oh, her lovin' will kick your behind
Oh, she'll show you no mercy
But she'll sho'nuff, sho'nuff show you how to grind

Darlin' Nikki, oh

Woke up the next morning
Nikki wasn't there
I looked all over and all I found
Was a phone number on the stairs
It said, "Thank you for a funky time
Call me up whenever you want to grind"

Oh, Nikki, oh, oh

Oh, come back Nikki, come back
Your dirty little prince
Wanna grind, grind, grind, grind, grind, grind, grind, grind, grind

Noos gnimoc, gnimoc, noos gnimoc si droL eht tahT
Wonk I esuac' enif m'I ?Uoy era woh, olleH
