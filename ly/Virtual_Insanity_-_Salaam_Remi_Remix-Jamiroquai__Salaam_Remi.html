		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh, hey hey, oh
What we're living in
Let me tell ya

And it's a wonder man can eat at all
When things are big that should be small
Who can tell what magic spells we'll be doing for us?
And I'm giving all my love to this world
Only to be told
I can't see, I can't breathe
No more will we be
And nothing's gonna change the way we live
'Cause we can always take but never give
And now that things are changing for the worse, see
Whoa, it's a crazy world we're living in
And I just can't see that half of us immersed in sin
Is all we have to give these 

Futures made of virtual insanity
Now always seem to be governed by this love we have
For useless, twisting of our new technology
Oh, now there is no sound for we all live underground

And I'm thinking what a mess we're in
Hard to know where to begin
If I could slip the sickly ties of earth that man has made
And now every mother can choose the color
Of her child
That's not nature's way
Well that's what they said yesterday
There's nothing left to do but pray
I think it's time to find a new religion
Whoa, it's so insane
To synthesize another strain
There's something in these futures that we have to be told

Futures made of virtual insanity
Now always seem to be governed by this love we have
For useless, twisting of our new technology
Oh, now there is no sound for we all live underground, whoa

Now there is no sound
If we all live underground
And now it's virtual insanity
Forget your virtual reality
Oh, there's nothing so bad as a meddlin' man
Oh yeah
I know, yeah
(Ooh) take it to the bridge

Ooh
I know what can go on

Ooh, of virtual insanity we're living in
Has got to change, yeah
Things will never be the same
And I can't go on
What we're living in, oh
Oh, virtual insanity

Oh, this world has got to change
'Cause I just, I just can't keep going on
In this virtual, virtual insanity
That we're living in, that we're living in

Now virtual insanity is what it is
Yeah, ooh

Futures made of virtual insanity
Now always seem to be governed by this love we have
For useless, twisting of our new technology
Oh, now there is no sound for we all live underground, whoa

Futures made of virtual insanity
Now always seem to be governed by this love we have
For useless, twisting of our new technology
Oh, now there is no sound for we all live underground
Yes we do, oh

(Living in) now this life that we're living 
(Virtual insanity) it's all so wrong and
(Living in) out the window, you know
(Virtual insanity) that there is nothing worse than

(Living in) a meddlin' man
(Virtual insanity) there is nothing worse than
(Living in) a foolish mind
(Virtual insanity) hey

Virtual insanity is what we're living in
Yeah, the world is all I have
