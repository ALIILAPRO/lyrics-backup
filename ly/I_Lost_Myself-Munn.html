		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I lost myself that night
I threw it all away
Those are the things I've hated
Then I went and caved in
I'm a mess right now
My heart is in two places
Half is back at home
The other's off and racing
I've been
Running and running and running and running away
I know they'll catch me
Running and running and running two opposite ways
Two opposite ways
I can't let my past catch me now, me now
I can't let my past drag me down, me down
I lost myself that night
I threw it all away
Recall my mother's words
But it was far too late
I feel the burden now
It's weighing down my soul
And I can't catch my breath
'Cause these demons follow
I've been
Running and running and running and running away
I know they'll catch me
Running and running and running two opposite ways
Two opposite ways
I can't let my past catch me now, me now
I can't let my past drag me down, me down
I can't let my past catch me now, me now
I can't let my past drag me down, me down
Swear I've changed
But you don't care that
I'm not the same
You'll always haunt me
I swear I've changed
But you don't care that
I'm not the same
I can't let my past catch me now, me now
I can't let my past drag me down, me down
I can't let my past catch me now, me now
I can't let my past drag me down, me down
