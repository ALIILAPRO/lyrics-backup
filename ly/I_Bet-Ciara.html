		  Na-na, na-na
Na-na, na-na
Na-na, na-na
No-no, hey

I bet you start loving me
Soon as I start loving someone else
Somebody better than you
I bet you start needing me
Soon as you see me with someone else
Somebody other than you
And I know that it hurts
You know that it hurts your pride
But you thought the grass was greener on the other side
I bet you start loving me
Soon as I start loving someone else
Somebody better than you

So I'm supposed to believe that it's Fellini's calling your phone? (Okay)
I'm s'posed to believe that they're asking you if you're home (you trippin')
I weren't born yesterday, not me (no)
Can't get that over me (can't get it over)
Not me (no not me)
I love you, but I won't be a fool for you (I won't be a fool)
That is just something that I wouldn't do, babe (no, never)
I mean I'mma stay if you could tell the truth (be honest)
But you can't, no matter how much time I ask

Is that your bitch over there (your bitch over there)
Giving me the ugly stare (that stare that stare)
The one with the silicone ass (that one right there)
And the Brazilian hair (yeah yeah yeah yeah)
You ain't gon' respect me no no no till I'm not there (I'm goin')
See, I got you comfortable, now you ain't really scared

But I bet you start loving me
Soon as I start loving someone else
Somebody better than you
I bet you start needing me
Soon as you see me with someone else
Somebody other than you
And I know that it hurts
You know that it hurts your pride
But you thought the grass was greener on the other side
I bet you start loving me
Soon as I start loving someone else
Somebody better than you

There was never a day that I would never say that
I love you (I love you)
Do whatever it takes, put a smile on your face girl
You know that's true
Walking away, I took all I can take and
Now I'm through
If I know one day no one ever will love you
Like I do
Tell me why I should stay (should stay)
While you're lying straight to my face
I never wanna walk away
But this time it's just too late oh

I bet you start loving me (I bet)
Soon as I start loving someone else
Somebody better than you
I bet you start needing me
Soon as you see me with someone else
Somebody other than you
And I know that it hurts
You know that it hurts your pride
But you thought the grass was greener on the other side (oh)
I bet you start loving me
Soon as I start loving someone else
Somebody better than you

Baby, tell me what's it
Gonna take to keep it
All the way one hundred
You won't get it till I'm gone away (Away)

I bet you start loving me
Soon as I start loving someone else
Somebody better than you
I bet you start needing me
Soon as you see me with someone else
Somebody other than you
And I know that it hurts
You know that it hurts your pride
But you thought the grass was greener on the other side
I bet you start loving me
Soon as I start loving someone else
Somebody better than you

Oh oh oh
I hate, I hate that I'm
Singing this song
Singing this song
'cause I love you
Yeah I love you
Oh woah, oh woah, oh woah, oh woah, oh woah, oh woah, oh woah
I'm all cried out
I'm all tried out
I'm all fired out
Ay
Right now, it's killing me
'Cause now I have to find someone else
When all I wanted was you

Na-na, na-na
Na-na, hey
