		  (I'm workin' on dyin')
They question how I got the top spot
Huh
Nigga, 'cause I earned it (Gangsta Grillz)

I'm feelin' better than I ever did
On a paper mission, tryna get it like a settlement
They see the bench player goin' hard, please sub him in
Know they 'bout to hear this and go crazy in the club again
Knowin' that we got it, baby girl, so why you askin'?
Knowin' she was foreign, from the head down to the accent
And every time she hear the engine, she say "Damn, is that an Aston?"
Every time I see them jeans, I'm thinkin' "How she fit the ass in?" (Uh)

How she fit that ass in? I just pull a Ashton
Fuck her like a butcher, tryna cutch her like I'm Aston
Shorty and her folks got that Volks' and that wagon
Should I hit once? I'm supposed to be braggin'
Buy a bitch Bourbon, but don't buy that bitch a Birkin
Fuck her friend good, make her other friend nervous
She don't want my dick, fuck her, bitch, I jerk it
I'm flee, get the pussy for free, so why splurge it?

Why they talkin' how they talkin' 'cause they made niggas?
Why everybody throwin' shots at the made niggas?
Off the rep, take a guess what we made, nigga
All top tier, bad girls gettin' slayed, nigga

Nigga, 'cause we earned that (yeah, we earned that)
Nigga, 'cause we earned that (grr)
Nigga, 'cause we earned that
All top tier, bad girls gettin' slayed, nigga
Nigga, 'cause we earned that (Philly)
Nigga, 'cause we earned that (oh)
Nigga, 'cause we earned that (what?)
All top tier, bad girls gettin' slayed, nigga

I'm in Philly, bad bitch, I fuck a silly nigga
I work the pot and count this money like a friendly nigga
He goin' live all in the trap and I'm like, "Really, nigga?"
And any nigga wonder why we gotta kill these niggas
Bustdown AP's
Nigga yellin' touchdown with my AC, niggas (yeah)
Shorty really don't deserve to fuck me
She can throw it at me now, but I deserve that cudi, on the real

What's the dealy? I call up Tory, he in the city
I got a feelin' that niggas really ain't fuckin' with me
Let's get paid, be the motto niggas, my brothers with me
Out of bounds, caught 'em like I put somethin' on them North Phil'
That's where you can find me, where the murder count is higher
Than the streaming slots on TIDAL
When a war real, you can't go and hide
And it's the chance to prove yourself
Is you gon' die or be an idol? Turn me up

Why they talkin' how they talkin' 'cause they made niggas?
Why everybody throwin' shots at the made niggas?
Off the rep, take a guess what we made, nigga
All top tier, bad girls gettin' slayed, nigga

Nigga, 'cause we earned that (yeah, we earned that)
Nigga, 'cause we earned that (grr)
Nigga, 'cause we earned that
All top tier, bad girls gettin' slayed, nigga
Nigga, 'cause we earned that (Philly)
Nigga, 'cause we earned that (oh)
Nigga, 'cause we earned that (what?)
All top tier, bad girls gettin' slayed, nigga

(Gangsta Grillz)
Shoutout to Philly
Shoutout to T-Dot
LGO QUA (all top tier, bad girl gettin' slayed, nigga)
Tory
