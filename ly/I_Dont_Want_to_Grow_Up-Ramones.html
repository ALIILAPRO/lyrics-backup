		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I'm lyin' in my bed at night
I don't want to grow up
Nothing ever seems to turn out right
I don't want to grow up

How do you move in a world of fog that's
Always changing things
Makes wish that I could be a dog

When I see the price that you pay
I don't want to grow up
I don't ever want to be that way
I don't want to grow up

Seems that folks turn into things
That they never want
The only thing to live for is today...

I'm gonna put a hole in my T.V. set
I don't want to grow up
Open up the medicine chest
I don't want to grow up

I don't want to have to shout it out
I don't want my hair to fall out
I don't want to be filled with doubt
I don't want to be a good boy scout
I don't want to have to learn to count
I don't want to have the biggest amount
I don't want to grow up

Well when I see my parents fight
I don't want to grow up
They all go out and drinkin' all night
I don't want to grow up

I'd rather stay here in my room
Nothin' out there but sad and gloom
I don't want to live in a big old tomb on
Grand street
When I see the 5 o'clock news
I don't want to grow up
Comb their hair and shine their shoes
I don't want to grow up

Stay around in my old hometown
I don't want to put no money down
I don't want to get a big old loan
Work them fingers to the bone
I don't want to float on a broom
Fall in love, get married then boom
How the hell did it get here so soon

I don't want to grow up
