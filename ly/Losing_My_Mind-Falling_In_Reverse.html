		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've got the motherfucking world in my palm now, don't tell me to calm down
Striking a match, igniting the track while I'm typing in caps, it's on now
The rap Casanova with cash in a sofa in the back of a Rover
Six-pack in a backpack and I'm cracking 'em open, sipping I'm trapped in a moment
Open your eyes 'cause you're never gonna know if your next move might be your last
Living a lie, everybody's always gonna bring up my past
Well, I'm past that, my interest up and my bag's packed
I'm the NASDAQ with a rad rap so

I'm not ready to change, I'm doing my thing
You're pointing the blame, you know I'm not ready to choose
So don't get confused and stay the hell out of my way
So why do you believe
You're losing your mind, losing your mind again
In everyone but me?
I'm losing my mind, losing my mind again

I've seen the hardships, lived in darkness through the mud into the marshes
My reputation is tarnished but regardless, I am awesome
Saw the gossip from my lockup go colossal
Then I blossomed to the boss of this rock stuff
And I'm never gonna stop till the cops come
What I'm really trying to say
Is say it to my face and if you won't, stay the fuck out my way
Rocking shows, lock and load, stop me, no
I'm repping the new shit, the essence of music
I'm blessed with the fusion of both

I'm not ready to change, I'm doing my thing
You're pointing the blame, you know I'm not ready to choose
So don't get confused and stay the hell out of my way
So why do you believe
You're losing your mind, losing your mind again
In everyone but me?
I'm losing my mind, losing my mind again

Ever since I was a little boy I always thought that the world was going to end in my lifetime
So I try to seize every opportunity as it came to me
Because I believed it might stop the sky from falling down one more day
But the older I got, the more I realized that I cannot save the world
I'm not a superhero, I'm not perfect, I'm just me, a human being

So let's take, take, take the throne and break the cycle
So why do you believe everyone but me?
Every single day we kill our idols
But you won't break me down
You're losing your mind, losing your mind again
You're losing your mind, losing your mind again
We're losing our minds, losing our minds

I'm not ready to change, I'm doing my thing
You're pointing the blame, you know I'm not ready to choose
So don't get confused and stay the hell out of my way
So why do you believe
You're losing your mind, losing your mind again
In everyone but me?
I'm losing my mind, losing my mind again

I'm not ready to change, I'm doing my thing
You're losing your mind, losing your mind again
You know I'm not ready to choose, so don't get confused
I'm losing my mind, losing my mind
