		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wanna wake up every mornin', feelin' better
'Cause I know you're sleeping by my side
And every moment we're together
I remember just to keep it all for you and I

I see that body in the sunlight
Feelin' the heat and it feels right
I wanna do this for the rest of my life

Oh, I know, I know, you know the vibe
I wanna stay with you every night
You and me underneath the lights
I'm always good when you're by my side
I know, you know you're on my mind
You really make me come alive
I wanna be here for the rest of my life

Looking for sun rays, needin' them good days
Fly me away-away, you're my holiday
Cool like the ocean, lost in emotion
Fly me away-away, you're my holiday
Whenever you're here it's a good time
Strawberry shirts in the sunshine
Ice-cold drinks 'til the moonlight
You're my holiday
Whenever you're here it's a good time
Strawberry shirts in the sunshine
Ice-cold drinks 'til the moonlight
You're my holiday

I wanna stay up 'til the mornin' with you talkin'
Just to listen to the things you say
And every time we're in the middle of the city
I imagine us so far away

I see that body in the sunlight (sunlight)
Feelin' the heat and it feels right (feels right)
I wanna do this for the rest of my life

Oh, I know you know you're on my mind (yeah)
You really make me come alive (yeah)
I wanna be here for the rest of my life

Looking for sun rays, needin' them good days
Fly me away-away, you're my holiday (you're my holiday)
Cool like the ocean, lost in emotion
Fly me away-away, you're my holiday
Whenever you're here it's a good time (good time)
Strawberry shirts in the sunshine (sunshine)
Ice-cold drinks 'til the moonlight (moonlight)
You're my holiday (you're my holiday)
Whenever you're here it's a good time (good time
Strawberry shirts in the sunshine (sunshine)
Ice-cold drinks 'til the moonlight (moonlight)
You're my holiday

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, you're my holiday
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, you're my holiday
