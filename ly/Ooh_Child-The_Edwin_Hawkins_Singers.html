		  Ooh child
Things are gonna get easier
Ooh child
Things'll get brighter

Some day, yeah
We'll get it together and we'll get it all done
Some day
When your head is much lighter
Some day, yeah
We'll walk in the rays of a beautiful sun
Some day
When the world is much brighter

Ooh child
Things are gonna be easier
Ooh child
Things'll be brighter

Some day, yeah
We'll get it together and we'll get it all done
Some day
When your head is much lighter

Some day, yeah
We'll walk in the rays of a beautiful sun
Some day
When the world is much brighter
