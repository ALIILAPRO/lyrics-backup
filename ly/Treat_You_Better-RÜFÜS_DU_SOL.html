		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Every night
I take myself to where the sky's are blue
To where we swam when I met you

Stay here
I spent the best days of my life with you
Watching clouds form in the distance
I watch the sun setting on the beach with you
It's not over yet

I want your love
And I want it bad
I just wanna treat you better
I just wanna treat you better
I want your love
And I want it bad
I just wanna treat you better
I just wanna treat you better

(I just wanna, I just wanna, I just wanna)

Let's begin again
Let's get back to where we started
When there was talk of getting older
I've been waiting by the water
Let's start over

I want your love
And I want it bad
I just wanna treat you better
I just wanna treat you better
I want your love
And I want it bad
I just wanna treat you better
I just wanna treat you better

I know that the words don't change and
I know that your heart keeps aching
I just wanna treat you better
I just wanna treat you better
Even when the light can't find me
I know that the sun keeps shining
I just wanna treat you better
I just wanna treat you better
Oh, I just wanna treat you better
I just wanna treat you better
I just wanna treat you better
I just wanna treat you better

I want your love
And I want it bad
I just wanna treat you better
I just wanna treat you better
I want your love
And I want it bad
I just wanna treat you better
I just wanna treat you better
