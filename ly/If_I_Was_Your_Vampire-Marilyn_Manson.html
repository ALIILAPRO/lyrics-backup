		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Six A.M., Christmas morning
No shadows, no reflections here
Lying cheek to cheek in your cold embrace

So soft and so tragic as a slaughterhouse
You press the knife against your heart
And say that, "I love you
So much you must kill me now."
I love you
So much you must kill me now

If I was your vampire, certain as the moon
Instead of killing time, we'll have each other till the sun
If I was your vampire, death waits for no one
Hold my hands across your face because I think our time has come

Digging your smile apart with my spade-tongue
And the hole is where the heart is
We built this tomb together; I will fill it alone
(Beyond the pale everything's black, no turning back)

If I was your vampire, certain as the moon
Instead of killing time, we'll have each other till the sun
If I was your vampire, death waits for no one
Hold my hands across your face because I think our time has come

Blood-stained sheets
In the shape of your heart
This is where it starts
Blood-stained sheets
In the shape of your heart
This is where it starts
This is where it will end
Here comes the moon again

Six-nineteen, and I know I'm ready
Drive me off the mountain; you'll burn, and I'll eat your ashes
Impossible wheels seducing our corpse

If I was your vampire, certain as the moon
Instead of killing time, we'll have each other till the sun
If I was your vampire, death waits for no one
Hold my hands across your face because I think our time has come

(Beyond the pale everything's black, no turning back)
(Beyond the pale everything's black, no turning back)

This is where it starts
This is where it will end
Here comes the moon again
Here comes the moon again
This is where it starts
This is where it will end
Here comes the moon again
Here comes the moon again

Here comes the moon again

Here comes the moon again
