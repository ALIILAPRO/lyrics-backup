		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I woke up this morning
With a grin upon my chin
Damn I had one hell of a night
So I'll confessed my dirty sin
I called a girl I hardly knew
I only knew her by first name
She had a deep down southern accent
But spoke California slang
She wore shorts too short
A shirt too tight
I lost control
Lost my mind
She said You gotta love me 'til the sun comes up
Said You gotta love me 'til I had enough

(Ah, ah)

She said you gotta love me 'til the sun comes up
She Said you gotta love me 'til I had enough
She said you gotta love me 'til the sun comes up
She Said you gotta love me 'til I had enough

I've got the homesick blues
I don't know what to do
So I'm gonna go home with with someone
Ooh ooh

I woke up this morning with one thing on my mind
How the hell am I gonna get out of here,
How the hell am I gonna get up out alive?

I called a girl I barley knew
I only knew her by first name
I have probably been there
She lives on Penny Loafer Ln.
She wore cowboy boots,
Her hair down long
Call me weak but I swear I'm strong,
But she said you gotta love me 'til the sun comes up
Said you gotta love me 'til I had enough

(Ah, ah)

She said you gotta love me 'til the sun comes up
She Said you gotta love me 'til I had enough
She said you gotta love me 'til the sun comes up
She Said you gotta love me 'til I had enough

I've got the homesick blues
I don't know what to do
I thought my mama taught me so much better
Then to get with a girl like that

If my friends find out they'll probably laugh
'Cause they've been with a girl like that

I woke up this morning
With a grin upon my chin
Damn I had one hell of a night
Yeah I had one hell of a night

She said you gotta love me 'til the sun comes up
She Said you gotta love me 'til I had enough
She said you gotta love me 'til the sun comes up
She Said you gotta love me 'til I had enough

I've got the homesick blues I don't know what to do
So I'm gonna go home with with someone
Ooh ooh

Woo
