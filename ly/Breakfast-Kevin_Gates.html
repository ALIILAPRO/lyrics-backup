		  (Ain't that DJ Chose over there?)
(Mm, look like DJ Chose)
Mm-mm-mm, girl you taste good, you my food, girl
(Charlie)
I've been feelin' you for a while, oh, ayy
Oh, ah

Early breakfast for you, I got somethin' special for you (somethin' special)
I'ma beat that pussy 'til you snorin' (I'ma beat that pussy 'til you snore)
Turn around, bend you over, I ain't leavin' no leftovers (no leftovers)
Droppin' dick off in the mornin' (dick off in the mornin')
Mm-mm-mm, girl, you taste good, you my food, girl (yeah)
Laid back, I'ma snack on you 'til your toes curl ('til your toes curl)
Early breakfast for you, I got somethin' special for you
I'm droppin' dick off in the mornin' (yeah)

No longer the filler, they shippin' the cylinder
Handlin' business, we meet in the middle
I-I'm a real general, don't get offended
Ain't too many livin' the way that I'm livin'
Breathtakingly beautiful, bae, and I want you
You know I want you
Love, uh-uh, ooh, oh-oh, ooh, oh-oh (Gates), I want you, girl
They see me, lil' discipline, keep my composure
Step in the castle, come a lil' closer
Your nipples erected, your body so sexy
I rub on your feet while we chill on the sofa
Nip on your fingers, nip on your shoulder
Mwah, hit your navel and go a lil' lower
Bend the back over, both hands behind your back, you hold me closer (don't let go)
I just mixed the Maca with Ashwagandha
What you put in your lil' body? She rockin' her bamba
High vibration gettin' raised in the sunshine
Vibratin' now, ain't no way I could come now (ah-ah)

Early breakfast for you, I got somethin' special for you (somethin' special)
I'ma beat that pussy 'til you snorin' (I'ma beat that pussy 'til you snore)
Turn around, bend you over, I ain't leavin' no leftovers (no leftovers)
Droppin' dick off in the mornin' (dick off in the mornin')
Mm-mm-mm, girl, you taste good, you my food, girl (yeah)
Laid back, I'ma snack on you 'til your toes curl ('til your toes curl)
Early breakfast for you, I got somethin' special for you
I'm droppin' dick off in the mornin' (droppin' dick off in the mornin')

Two-two-hundred-fifty brick come 'cross the border
With my constituents, we havin' business
Tris back in the mix again, reachin' my quota
Shoutout to border fam', we been controllin'
Bread winner, Major League Mafia, swingin'
And we up to bat, my big brother came back and we back havin' motion
Gorilla four, we been overseas, metro ton load on the submarine, come out the ocean
I'm who he wanna be, know he can't fuck with me
Know his ho lovin' me, but I ain't goin'
He tryna emulate Gates with the braids
He went tatted his face, and I don't even know him
My young niggas trap out of trenches in Michigan
Called all the blammers and go to performin'
Finally receivin' my flowers, New Orleans, a sold-out arena when Brasi performin'
I'm in a hard ball lane and only sell whole things
They say, "A fool stays the same", and only "Wise men change"
I'm tryna put my family back together, gotta put down old ways
And I been confused 'cause I been abused by this cold, cold game (ah-ah)

Early breakfast for you, I got somethin' special for you (somethin' special)
I'ma beat that pussy 'til you snorin' (I'ma beat that pussy 'til you snore)
Turn around, bend you over, I ain't leavin' no leftovers (no leftovers)
Droppin' dick off in the mornin' (dick off in the mornin')
Mm-mm-mm, girl, you taste good, you my food, girl (yeah)
Laid back, I'ma snack on you 'til your toes curl ('til your toes curl)
Early breakfast for you, I got somethin' special for you
I'm droppin' dick off in the mornin'

Droppin' dick off in the mornin' time (ooh, I)
Found love (mornin' time, ooh, I)
Droppin' dick off in the mornin' time (ooh, I)
Found love
(Found love)
