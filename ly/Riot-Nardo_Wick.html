		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell me when the gun's out of your hand
I don't wanna start a riot
Oh la-la, la, la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la, la, la
(Damn, Trademark)

Load the guns up and wait for the sun to go down 
We're gonna start a riot
About my loved ones, no understanding at all
I'm gonna start a riot 
Load the guns up and wait for the sun to go down 
(Tell me when the gun's out of your hand)
We're gonna start a riot (I don't wanna start a riot)

La, la, la-la, la, la, la (about my loved ones, no understanding at all)
La, la, la-la, la-la-la-la, la, la, la (I'm gonna start a riot)
La-la-la, la, la

Pull your mask down when the sun go down
For the ones I love, I burn down the whole town
Made it out that flood, they was hopin' that we drown
All that tweakin', leave you sleepin', put a hole in your crown

Load the guns up and wait for the sun to go down 
(Tell me when the gun's out of your hand)
We're gonna start a riot (I don't wanna start a riot)

La, la, la-la, la, la, la (about my loved ones, no understanding at all)
La, la, la-la, la-la-la-la, la, la, la (I'm gonna start a riot)
La-la-la, la, la

Them Wicked niggas in the cut 
They just waitin' on the go
Yeah, I know that nigga dead
I'm just waitin' on a post
Young nigga, stayed down
I was waitin' on the floor
I ain't get why they was laughin'
I was waitin' on the joke
I was waitin', tryna catch 'em
I was ready, tryna score (grrt-grrt)
Can't put my jacket on his head 
Six thousand for my coat
Got plenty Ps, don't need no dope
Got my rod, don't need no hope
I'm gon' get close, don't need no scope
Hand me a strap, I bet I blow
Hand me a strap, I bet I bang
Ask Lil D, he know I bang
Ask Lil 2, he know I bang
Ask Forrest, he know I bang
How they know? 'Cause we done banged
Pull up, skrrt-skrrt, hop out, flame (bang)
Grrah-grrah, bang 
Grrah-grrah-grrah (pew, pew, pew)

Load the guns up and wait for the sun to go down 
We're gonna start a riot
About my loved ones, no understanding at all
I'm gonna start a riot 
Load the guns up and wait for the sun to go down 
(Tell me when the gun's out of your hand)
We're gonna start a riot (I don't wanna start a riot)

La, la, la-la, la, la, la (about my loved ones, no understanding at all)
La, la, la-la, la-la-la-la, la, la, la (I'm gonna start a riot)
La-la-la, la, la

Pull your mask down when the sun go down
For the ones I love, I burn down the whole town
Made it out that flood, they was hopin' that we drown
All that tweakin', leave you sleepin', put a hole in your crown

I'm wicked
