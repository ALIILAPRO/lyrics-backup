		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wish I could fall in love with you again
Feel the sweet exciting nerves like when we were just friends
I wouldn't change a thing even if I was able
I just wanna feel you twice, for the fable
If you could fall in love
Twice with me
Start brand new like we're kissing in a tree
Would you?
And could you?
I know I can fall in love
Twice with you
I do it every day
So I swear it's nothing new
It's crazy
My baby
I wish I could feel your skin against mine
Long distance sucks, I forget what you smell like
If I could snap my fingers and be in Chicago
Know I would be there right away tomorrow
If you could fall in love
Twice with me
Start brand new like we're kissing in a tree
Would you?
And could you?
I know I can fall in love
Twice with you
I do it every day
So I swear it's nothing new
It's crazy
My baby
It's hard not to feel like a pile of rocks
I don't know what I'm doing and I'm stuck in your socks
Lovin' you twice is
My daydream
I can only hope that's what you are craving
Too
So what about you?
If you could fall in love
Twice with me
Start brand new like we're kissing in a tree
Would you?
And could you?
I know I can fall in love
Twice with you
I do it every day
So I swear it's nothing new
It's crazy
My baby
