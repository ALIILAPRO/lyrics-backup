		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Did you have one of those days
You wish you could just wish away
Oh wouldn't it be nice to disappear
The world feels like it's black and white
And when you smile it's out of spite
Trust me, I've been there before
Sometimes I wonder what's the point
Of trying every day
When we're all gonna die anyway
But maybe everything that's sad
Will come untrue someday
We're all gonna die anyway
Even though we don't have long
This isn't just another song
That tells you to live only for today
I guess all that I wanted to say
Is it's okay to not be okay
And death won't have the final say
Sometimes I wonder what's the point
Of trying every day
When we're all gonna die anyway
But maybe everything that's sad
Will come untrue someday
We're all gonna die anyway
It's morbid of me
To think about dying
But it'll happen to me and you
And maybe the thought
That we will all be gone
Will help us to see the truth
Sometimes I wonder what's the point
Of trying every day
When we're all gonna die anyway
But maybe everything that's sad
Will come untrue someday
We're all gonna die anyway
We're all gonna die anyway
