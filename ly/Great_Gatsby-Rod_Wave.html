		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Pipe that shit up, TnT)
I tell myself, it'll be alright
Now it's 3 AM, and I still got no reply
But I spend my nights alone
(Trill got that juice, nigga)
By myself, just another lonely day
Do I need help, because this ache won't go away?
These shadows on my wall, my only curtain call
The crowd goes silent now
Waiting for you

Where you at right now? Let me pull up and let's talk about it
I finally got some time alone, and I thought about it
I swear to God your love is war, it's so much I can take
I been thuggin' for so long, bae, give me a break
Late nights, I reminisce about you, it's hard to forget about you
I swear I can't live with you, but I can't live without you
Jump off a plane on an island and I'm here without you
Ain't left my hotel in three days, I feel sick without you, sick without you
My stomach do this turnin', I feel sick without you
My closest friend, my worst enemy
I'm not okay when we apart, but I pretend to be, I
I threw the party of the century
And people came over, no one left sober
And it was all for you, it was all for you
I been under this rock for so long, don't let the world in
Close the door, don't let the world in
Let's go and hide in again
Rekindle our flame and light my fire again (light my fire again)
Oh, come light my fire again
I threw the party of the century
And people came over, no one left sober
And it was all for you, it was all for you
I threw the party of the century
And people came over, no one left sober
And it was all for you, it was all for you
