		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sunday comes alone again 
A perfect day for a quiet friend 
And you - you will set it free 
I see new morning round your face 
Everybody says its another phase 
And now - now its come to me 
See the magic in your eyes 
I see it come as no surprise 
And you - you turn your eyes away 
Yeah you - you turn it all away 
I guess its true its never too late 
Still I don't know what to do today 
Oh why - can't I set you free 
Will you - do the same for me 
Sunday comes and Sunday goes 
Sunday always seems to move so slow 
To me - here she comes again 
A perfect ending to a perfect day 
A perfect ending what can I say 
To you - lonely Sunday friend 
With you - Sunday never ends
