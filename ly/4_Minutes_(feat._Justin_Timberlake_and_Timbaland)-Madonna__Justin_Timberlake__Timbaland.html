		  I'm outta time and
All I got is four minutes (freaky, freaky), four minutes aye

I'm outta time and
All I got is four minutes (freaky, freaky), four minutes aye

I'm outta time and
All I got is four minutes (freaky, freaky), four minutes aye (four, four)

I'm outta time and
All I got is four minutes (freaky, freaky), four minutes aye (four, four)

I'm outta time and
All I got is four minutes (freaky, freaky), four minutes aye (four, four)

I'm outta time and
All I got is four minutes (freaky, freaky), four minutes aye (four, four)

I'm outta time and
All I got is four minutes (freaky, freaky), four minutes aye (four, four)

I'm outta time and
All I got is four minutes (freaky, freaky) (four, four)

Come on, ah
Yeah, ha
Break down
Come on

Hey, uh
Come on
Madonna, break it

Come on boy
I've been waiting for somebody
To pick up my stroll, uh

Uh, well don't waste time
Give me a sign
Tell me how you wanna roll, uh, mm

I want somebody to speed it up for me
Then take it down slow
There's enough room for both

Well, I can handle that
You just gotta show me where it's at
Are you ready to go?
(Are you ready to go?) (freaky, freaky, freaky, freaky, freaky come on)

If you want it
You already got it
If you thought it
It better be what you want, uh (freaky, freaky)
If you feel it
It must be real just
Say the word and
I'm a give you what you want, uh

Time is waiting
We only got four minutes
To save the world
No hesitating
Grab a boy
Grab a girl
Time is waiting
We only got four minutes
To save the world
No hesitating
We only got four minutes, huh
Four minutes

So keep it up, keep it up
Don't be a pri- (hey), Madonna, uh
You gotta get 'em a, hop
Tick tock tick tock tick tock
That's right, keep it up, keep it up
Don't be a pri- (hey) Madonna, uh

You gotta get em' a, hop
Tick tock tick tock tick tock (freaky, freaky)
Sometimes I think what I need
Is a you intervention, yeah

And you know I can (ah c'mon)
Tell that you like it
And that it's good, by the way
That you move, ooh, hey

The road to hell is paved
With good intentions, yeah

But if I die tonight
At least I can say I did
What I wanted to do, uh
Tell me, how 'bout you?

If you want it
You already got it
If you thought it
It better be what you want (uh, c'mon)
If you feel it
It must be real just
Say the word and
I'ma give you what you want, uh

Time is waiting
We only got four minutes
To save the world
No hesitating
Grab a boy
Grab a girl
Time is waiting
We only got four minutes
To save the world
No hesitating
We only got four minutes, huh
Four minutes

So keep it up, keep it up
Don't be a pri-hey, Madonna, uh
You gotta get 'em a, hop
Tick tock tick tock tick tock
That's right, keep it up, keep it up
Don't be a pri-hey, Madonna, uh
You gotta get 'em a, hop
Tick tock tick tock tick tock

Breakdown, yeah
(Tick tock tick tock tick tock)
Yeah, uh huh
(Tick tock tick tock tick tock)
I only got four minutes, to save the world
