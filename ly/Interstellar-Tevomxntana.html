		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Just the way it is
This is how it goes yea
We in different places interstellar worlds yea
I'm in Margiela walk up in this hoe
Down here by myself how the fuck I go wrong
Yeah
We got plenty bands we ain't running out
Knew this from the start look where we standing now
Shawty broke my heart left me here to rot
Yeah yeah
You cannot do this shit again
She think I'm obsessed but I'm fucking on her friend
Looking at our past did some shit that I regret
But I'm in my bag now I know they upset
And how you're feeling can change within secs
Shawty broke my heart
So I'm tweaking off a xan yeaa
Did you get my text or nah imma pop these until I'm dead
I'm doing way too much for me to worry bout her
No need to stress I'm getting money now
Gotta fix this my time running out
There's some shit in this life I can't live without
In a interstellar coupe pockets thick with us yea
Bust down the watch diamonds cartier yea
Can't fuck wit fakes I can't be around em
She don't like me she just like being around us
Fuck what he saying get him stretched
I don't do no dealings bro do what I said
I'm too up I've been sipping on tek
Man these niggas so hoe
Can see em through the lense
Don't know what she see in me I might still hit
Even tho it's not my cup of tea
I'm rocking all black Alyx fuck the other piece
I still could touch the stars there without a key
How the fuck I get here time is running out
We in drop top things with the doors up yea
Ran it up I got sick commas baby
Smoking all the gas of the new exotic
I can't tell if it's real or not
Wish you well I can't have you by my fucking side
You the type to say that then switch up for a lie
I done came in that's why my diamonds right
Another day another day out
Racks came in send the packs out
You ain't getting bread that shi not allowed
We got hella trips
We ain't going out
Put my life in this pole I could never trust her
If I try I'll think I'm less
To be honest I don't know
And I swear you can't detest me you went out on your own
