		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I see you in my dreams
I close my eyes, you're right there
But you're my enemy
I'm talkin' 'bout my nightmares
Ain't no friend of me
I see that you don't fight fair
If you don't get your way
You just bitch n start complainin'

I see you in my dreams
I close my eyes, you're right there
But you're my enemy
I'm talkin' 'bout my nightmares
Ain't no friend of me
I see that you don't fight fair
If you don't get your way
You just bitch n start complainin'

I just wanna see you smile, babe
It's been awhile, babe
I'll be lucky if you touch me
I'll be lucky if you touch me
But I'm smarter than before
I'm just blessed, and I don't love her
I've been thinking with my head
Not my heart, I don't trust her

I was lying to myself, yeah i'm in love
Would you save me from myself, yeah
Pick me up for you just had enough of me
You don't fuck with me
That's why this shit's a nightmare
You don't fight fair
I don't really wanna die, yeah
I really fuck with livin'
But the way that you been actin'
I gotta make some decisions
I been livin', I've been flyin'
But that shit feel like I'm dyin'
I been dreamin', I've been floatin'
My niggas, you know we 'plying

I see you everytime I close my eyes
Wanna be with you
'Cause you make me wanna fly
Smokin weed with you i remember we was high
Now I'm leavin' you
Because I don't wanna die

I see you in my dreams
I close my eyes, you're right there
But you're my enemy
I'm talkin' 'bout my nightmares
Ain't no friend of me
I see that you don't fight fair
If you don't get your way
You just bitch n start complainin'

I just wanna see you smile, babe
It's been awhile, babe
I'll be lucky if you touch me
I'll be lucky if you trust me
But I'm smarter than before
I'm just blessed, and I don't love her
I've been thinking with my head
Not my heart, I don't trust her
