		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  NO TIME

I dreamt that some day
We’d make our own plans
Go to magical places, have fun

Walk on virgin snow
Naked in the sun
But things burst like a fucking glass

Come on, darling, I´ll look for ( you in the afterlife
Please, don’t drag me into your hole
Come on, darling, let’s dance at high tide
All Your secret pleasures are already gone

Go now, go now, no time
Go now, go now, no time

I try to remember the rain,
I still feel it falling on my face,
Oh, falling on you, oh, falling, I’m dry
The game’s over on your skin.

Come on, darling, we’ll crash in first class,
dreams are a nuclear bomb.
Come on, darling, we’ve touched every star,
we’re just two comets finally gone.

Go now, go now, no time
Go now, go now, no time

Now we’re the others, there’s no extra ball,
Im so glad to meet you, I feel my a rush in my blood
Saw the mole on your cheek running through your face
Darling

But I know there’s no more sunsets
I can’t jump this fence -Oh-
Your love is a slow thunder.
I can’t see the waves
I don’t know why

Go now, go now, no time
Go now, go now, no time

Don’t know what to do, don’t know what I say,
making promises is always
a truly human mistake.
Make a reel, this is the end.
