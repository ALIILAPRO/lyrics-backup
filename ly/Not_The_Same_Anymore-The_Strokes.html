		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're not the same anymore
Don't wanna play that game anymore
You'd make a better window than a door
Oh, the strangers they implore
It gets so easy to ignore
Just like the girl next door

Uncle's house, it was noon
Sorry boy, I can't implore ya
You are strange, but I like you
Sorry this is overdue
I promised I would do it right
Her and a boy on a Saturday night

And now the door slams shut
A child prisoner grows up
To seek his enemy's throat cut
I'm on and on it, on and on and on
We're on the way, fuel the jet
Can see that what he wants, he gets
What does your sworn enemy regret?

I didn't know, I didn't care
I don't even understand
Did somethin' wrong, I wasn't sure
Stay on top of this, or else
I was afraid I fucked up
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I couldn't change, it's too late

And now it's time to show up
Late again, I can't grow up
And now, it's on me they've given up

Uncle's house, I forget
Violent tendencies I get
Your timin' sucks, she went overboard
Don't forget, you are insured
I didn't know, I wasn't sure
Can't remember all that well
I couldn't change, was too late
Yeah, yeah, yeah
