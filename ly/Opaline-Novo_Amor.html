		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I knew I'd have a bad time shaking you
On the form, I'm naming, who?
With the crack sound of my tooth
Coming loose

It was all so complicated
I didn't mean to say it out loud
Anyway then, I think I should go
Exaggerate it
All my heart is breaking
I can't over state it
How should I be feeling?
(So run the red out)
The ceiling
(Is all coming down)
And I feel I should care but I don't
Mean to
(So run the red out)
Be rude
(It's all coming down)
Now I feel like I'm finally me

I know, I could've said I was feeling low
But I'm here just to hold your coat
I've been thinking I could stay at home

It was all so complicated
I didn't mean to say it out loud
Anyway then, I think I should go
Be evaporated
My heart is breaking
I can't over state it
How should I be feeling?
(So run the red out)
The ceiling
(Is all coming down)
I feel I should care but I don't
Mean to
(So run the red out)
Be rude
(It's all coming down)
Now I feel like I'm finally me
