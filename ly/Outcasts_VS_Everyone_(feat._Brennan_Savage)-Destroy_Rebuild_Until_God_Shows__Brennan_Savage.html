		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  a spark in your eye
it shows the quiet inside of you
it brings you to life
you've gotta fly
they've got you trapped like a prisoner
get back in line

scared to be different
a bad reputation
in the worst situation
on the run
it's got nothing to do with you
not a single thing left to prove
send me to hell if you want

if you're out of place
noone you know
outcasts have a place to go
if you're feeling lost
then come with us
outcasts vs everyone

ooh, you're not alone

call off the hunt
i know there's no getting through to me
it brings me to life
im gonna fly
they make me out like the enemy 
but i'll be alright

scared to be different
a bad reputation
in the worst situation
on the run
forget what they fucking think
we wont let them kill our dreams
we know that life has just begun

if you're out of place
noone you know
outcasts have a place to go
if you're feeling lost
then come with us
outcasts vs everyone

ooh, you're not alone

let em stare all that they want
(we don't care at all)
we'll stay up late to watch the sun
ill stay the same i cant become
im staying strong, im staying strong

if you're out of place
noone you know
outcasts have a place to go
if you're feeling lost
then come with us
outcasts vs everyone

ooh, you're not alone
