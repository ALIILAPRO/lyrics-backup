		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You hold a razor to your neck in your ignorance
And argue 'til you're blue in the fingertips
Mass suicidal, impulse to resist
Confirmation bias and evidence

(The devil, the devil you know)
(The devil, the devil you know)

Idle hands do devil's work
Idle minds that go berserk
Strapped down, ventilated and revoked
As Occam's razor slits your throat

Tribalized lobotomies
Extinction level comedy
Entitlement, violence
A mutiny, arrogance

Pre-paid ego trips in pointless directions
The road to hell is paved with bad concessions
Disastrous compromises with vanity
This funer-reality will mourn the death of expertise

(The devil, the devil you know)
(The devil, the devil you know)

Idle hands do devil's work
Idle minds that go berserk
Strapped down, ventilated and revoked
As Occam's razor slits your throat

Go

The body politic has decomposed
Decomposed
Watch it all decompose

You hold a razor to your neck
(The devil, the devil you know)
A razor to your neck

Idle hands do devil's work
Idle minds that go berserk
Strapped down, ventilated and revoked
As Occam's razor slits your throat
Slits your throat
