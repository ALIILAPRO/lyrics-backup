		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (I'm flashy)

Stylin', shinin'
I'm so flawless like my diamonds
I'm flashy
Big bags, price tags
You know all I wear is name brands
I'm flashy (ayy, look)

Good mornin', headed to Milan
You know I'm flyin' private, still be on my phone
Wearin' so much diamonds, lookin' like a ball (ice)
Walk into my closet, you think it was a mall
Got more than one, two Louis and Gucci
Like three, four Prada, Murakami
Like five, six designers, I just mix 'em up
Throw 'em in the Bentley truck
I don't really give a fuck (at all)
I don't even look at the price tag
In a different fit every night
And I illuminate like the light, yeah (la-la-la-la)
Know these Chrome Hearts don't fall off
I got Cartier on call, yeah
Lit up like a disco ball, ball (la-la-la-la)

Stylin', shinin'
I'm so flawless like my diamonds
I'm flashy
Big bags, price tags
You know all I wear is name brands
I'm flashy (la-la-la-la)

Talk to me nice (talk to me nice)
Dip me in ice (dip me in ice)
Glamorous life (glamorous)
I'm flashy (la-la-la-la)
My money tall (my money tall)
Ball 'til I fall (ball 'til I fall)
I want it all (I want it)
I'm flashy (la-la-la-la)

Good evenin', shinin' so you see me
Anything less than a million, I'm leavin'
With somebody's son on an island, wilin', smilin'
A place where these hatin' ass hoes can't find me
I like wearin' Fendi and Chanel
Egyptian cotton sheets, it's YSL
I just match my Lambo with my nails
I don't do it if it go on sale (on God)
I don't even look at the price tag
In a different fit every night
And I illuminate like a light, yeah (la-la-la-la)
My light too bright, can't turn off
Ain't about the money, don't call, nah
Can't find this in no mall, y'all (la-la-la-la)

Stylin', shinin'
I'm so flawless like my diamonds
I'm flashy
Big bags, price tags
You know all I wear is name brands
I'm flashy (la-la-la-la)

Talk to me nice (talk to me nice)
Dip me in ice (dip me in ice)
Glamorous life (glamorous)
I'm flashy (la-la-la-la)
My money tall (my money tall)
Ball 'til I fall (ball 'til I fall)
I want it all (I want it)
I'm flashy (la-la-la-la)
