		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Are you human? Or just programmed to deceive?
If your skin was translucent, would I see cold blood underneath?
Not really sure if you're human (human)
Or just a heart killing machine (ah)
'Cause I'm tryna see if you ever did care about me

I really am trying so hard not to be mad
If I'm lookin' inward, I'm lashin' out 'cause I'm so sad
I say I don't but I really do miss what we almost could've had

It was close but no cigar
Almost kissed you in your car
Lost in the black hole that's your heart
Baby, now we're just collapsing stars

Am I even human? (Human)
Or just programmed to believe
That sweet little cupid doesn't have it out for me
And part of my fucked up recovery
Is the monster that I paint you out to be

I really am trying so hard not to be mad
If I'm lookin' inward, I'm lashin' out 'cause I'm so sad
I say I don't but I really do miss what we almost could've had

It was close but no cigar
Almost kissed you in your car
Lost in the black hole that's your heart
Baby, now we're just collapsing stars

And part of my fucked up recovery
Is the monster that I paint you out to be
Slowly becoming a part of me
I don't even know what's become of me

I really am trying so hard not to be mad
If I'm lookin' inward, I'm lashin' out 'cause I'm so sad
I say I don't but I really do miss what we almost could've had

It was close but no cigar
Almost kissed you in your car
Lost in the black hole that's your heart
Baby, now we're just collapsing stars
