		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I peek into the hole  I struggle for control 

The children love the show  but they fail to see the anguish in my 

eyes 

Fail to see the anguish in my eyes 

I scratch around the brim  I let my mind give in 

The crowd begins to grin  but they seem to scream when darkness fills 

my eyes 

Seem to scream when darkness fills my eyes  it's no surprise 

Fail to see the tragic  turn it into magic 

My big top tricks will always make you happy 

But we all know the hat is wearing me 

My bag is in the hat, it's filled with this and that 

My vision's getting fat, the rabbit's just a monkey in disguise 

Stars and pills and needles dance before our eyes 

They will bite the hand if it is slower than the quickness of their 

scrutinizing eyes 

Fail to see the tragic, turn it into magic 

My big top tricks will always make you happy 

But we all know the hat is wearing me 

Chicanery will always make you happy 

But we all know the hat is wearing me
