		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Skin and bones, vulnerable
Crack my ribs and make me whole
Come and breathe the air into my lungs
I just wanna be your skeleton

A silhouette is following
Just waiting to break me down
I had it good, that's what I get
I guess that it's my turn now
Cut the wires, tangled, twisted
To find me again
Fracture, break me into pieces
'Til all that I am

Skin and bones, vulnerable
Crack my ribs and make me whole
Come and breathe the air into my lungs
I just wanna be your skeleton
Fix my head, stitch my soul
Find out where it all went wrong
Come and breathe the air into my lungs
I just wanna be your skeleton
Skeleton

A blinding pain behind my eyes
Is covering up the truth
Inside my brain's a parasite
It's telling me what to do
Feeding on my happiness
Like I never deserved it at all
(I never deserved it at all)
Feeling like a pessimist
When I just wanna laugh through it all
(To laugh through it all)

Skin and bones, vulnerable
Crack my ribs and make me whole
Come and breathe the air into my lungs
I just wanna be your skeleton
Fix my head, stitch my soul
Find out where it all went wrong
Come and breathe the air into my lungs
I just wanna be your skeleton
Skeleton

I project pain with the frame that I maintain
Pulling on chains, wanna break what I can't change
All that rage put away in my ribcage
Comes out in stages, how could I stage this?
Bending over 'til you break your back for this
Go 'head and crack my ribs, and take my oxygen
I'm damned if I do or I don't, I'm breaking my bones
Can't make it alone, no

Making such a mess (hey), it's getting permanently
Painted in my head (hey), and there's no going back
So love me like I'm dead (hey), until there's nothing left (hey)
And watch me decompose (hey), 'til I'm

Skin and bones, vulnerable
Crack my ribs and make me whole
Come and breathe the air into my lungs
I just wanna be your skeleton
Fix my head, stitch my soul
Find out where it all went wrong
Come and breathe the air into my lungs
I just wanna be your skeleton
Skeleton
