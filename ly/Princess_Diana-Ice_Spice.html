		  Grrah, grrah
(Stop playin' with 'em, RIOT)

Like, grrah, keep it a stack, bitches move wock 'cause they know I got bands (damn)
They be chattin' I don't give a damn and I'm still gettin' money I know who I am (grrah)
Tryna be low, he gon' hit up my 'Gram (grrah)
If he smart he gon' act like a fan (damn)
Thinkin' you bigger, they got ya head gassed (grrah)
Bitches slow, so I give 'em a pass
Like, grrah, keep it a stack, bitches move wock, 'cause they know I got bands (damn)
They be chattin' I don't give a damn and I'm still gettin' money I know who I am (grrah)
Tryna be low, he gon' hit up my 'Gram (grrah)
If he smart he gon' act like a fan (damn)
Thinkin' you bigger, they got ya head gassed (grrah)
Bitches slow, so I give 'em a pass

And I just fell in love with a gangsta (like)
So he put my name in a tatt' (damn)
But I don't let him come to the crib (grrah)
So we get it on where we at (grrah)
Nowadays I be duckin' them cameras
And they hype that I'm up on them banners
Callin' my phone, but they know I don't answer (why?)
In the hood, I'm like Princess Diana (grrah)
I'm thick 'cause I be eatin' oats (huh)
Bitches not takin' shit from me but notes
Wanna be me, so she do my emotes
And my name in her mouth so I bet she gon' choke (bitch)
To her man, l'm the girl of his dreams
Thinkin' 'bout me when he brushin' his teeth
He keep textin', I leave him on seen
Hottest bitch out and they know what I mean (know what I mean)

Like, grrah, keep it a stack, bitches move wock 'cause they know I got bands (damn)
They be chattin' I don't give a damn but I'm still gettin' money I know who I am (grrah)
Tryna be low, he gon' hit up my 'Gram (grrah)
If he smart he gon' act like a fan (damn)
Thinkin' you bigger, they got ya head gassed (grrah)
Bitches slow, so I give 'em a pass
Like, grrah, keep it a stack, bitches move wock, 'cause they know I got bands (damn)
They be chattin' I don't give a damn but I'm still gettin' money I know who I am (grrah)
Tryna be low, he gon' hit up my 'Gram (grrah)
If he smart he gon' act like a fan (damn)
Thinkin' you bigger, they got ya head gassed (grrah)
Bitches slow, so I give 'em a pass

Lookin' at me like who bigger than she? (who?)
I'm the one who they wishin' to be (damn)
Takin' my time, 'cause I don't wanna bait
If you makin' your plate, then I already ate (grrah)
Book a flight and go chill in Tulum
Turnin' heads when I walk in the room (like)
I know he want me, his bitch is a lame 
And she make in a year what I spend on a chain (spend on my chain, grrah)
Makin' it rain (makin' it rain)
Doin' my thing (like)
And I'm young, still gettin' money my pockets is chubby, nothin' was the same (huh)
Takin' ya boo (takin' ya boo)
Makin' it move
Like flexin' on niggas and bitches addictive, feenin' for me how they usually do (usually do)

Like, grrah, keep it a stack, bitches move wock 'cause they know I got bands (damn)
They be chattin' I don't give a damn and I'm still gettin' money I know who I am (grrah)
Tryna be low, he gon' hit up my 'Gram (grrah)
If he smart he gon' act like a fan (damn)
Thinkin' you bigger, they got ya head gassed (grrah)
Bitches slow, so I give 'em a pass
Like, grrah, keep it a stack, bitches move wock, 'cause they know I got bands (damn)
They be chattin' I don't give a damn and I'm still gettin' money I know who I am (grrah)
Tryna be low, he gon' hit up my 'Gram (grrah)
If he smart he gon' act like a fan (damn)
Thinkin' you bigger, they got ya head gassed (grrah)
Bitches slow, so I give 'em a pass
