		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't ever have to lie to me
Does the city even make you shine?
Baby won't you come inside with me
Till the sun is
I can make you

Why do you keep trying to fall asleep?
All the music only hits at night

If we never see the light again
My love we will be just
My love we will be just
My love we will be just
My love we will be just
My love we will be just
