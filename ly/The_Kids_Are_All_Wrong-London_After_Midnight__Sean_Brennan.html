		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fame, hate, pain, It all controls you
Rage, fear, blame, It satisfies you

No one ever really loved you much anyway
No one really understands so you'll make them pay
They're the target they're the meat they're the animal
You're the star, you are pure, they're the criminal

It isn't hard
Bigger than God
Filthy mind
You're one of my kind
And I can see
How it should be
We don't belong
The Kids are All Wrong

The Kids are All Wrong
The Kids are All Wrong

Love, trust, faith, It all escaped you
Self, lies, rage, And now this shapes you

It's from the Id and it has come to devour you
You're the star no matter what they are telling you
Make them afraid and they'll respect what you tell them to
Make them afraid and maybe one day they'll love you too

It isn't hard
Bigger than God
Filthy mind
You're one of my kind
And I can see
How it should be
We don't belong
The Kids are All Wrong

I think, in these days, especially in the States, you have to be a politician or an assassin or something, to really be a superstar.

It isn't hard
Bigger than God
Filthy mind
You're one of my kind
And I can see
How it should be
We don't belong
The Kids are All Wrong

The Kids are All Wrong 
The Kids are All Wrong 
The Kids are All Wrong 
The Kids are All Wrong 
The Kids are All Wrong 
The Kids are All Wrong 
The Kids are All Wrong 
The Kids are All Wrong
