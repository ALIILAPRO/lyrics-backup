		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ah
Ah
If you know I got no shame
Ain't about the money, it's about the power (no shame)
Ain't about the money, it's about the power (you know I got no shame)
Ain't about the money, it's about the power (no shame)
Ain't about the money, it's about the power

Think about it, think about it
Ain't no need to think about it
Get that money, keep that power
No they not the same thing
Money can't be anybody,
This somebody, that nobody
When it comes to power
Circle, super smaller names hey

Money make em' do it 'cause of what you give to em'
Power make em' do it 'cause you told them to do it
Money make you fly, power never die, don't know why
Money can't be lost, power never need an alibi
Love the good in the champagne
Power in my pride, power in my last days

Said if I don't know nothin', I know this paper
Bigger than the world steppin over skyscrappers
If I don't know nothin', one thing I know
Power over money, man that's just how it goes

If you know I got no shame
Ain't about the money, it's about the power (no shame)
Ain't about the money, it's about the power (you know I got no shame)
Ain't about the money, it's about the power (no shame)
Ain't about the money, it's about the power

When I'm in your presence you can feel the power
Even if this company was built from powder
Girls, kissin', on the couch, women, in the, shower
Surround, myself with kings, you can keep the cowards
Everytime I reminisce, I'm rappin' different bitches
Blood is thicker than water but B.S is the thickest
Let the chain round my neck tell my life story
Born into the money but would die for glory

Get ready for the takeover, that face, lip and makeover,
That case, that I break open, that great fifth like Beethoven
If you, wanna get it, papi, I can be in the team
Thirty-four, in a, rocket 'cause Hakeem's the dream
Get it, they don't get it

Ooh, we're makin' moves, you're only doin'
What my power let you do
You see that money isn't everybody's thing
When it comes to power, can only be one king

Said if I don"t know nothin', I know this paper
Bigger than the world steppin' over skyscrapers
If I don't know nothin', one thing I know
Power over money, man thats just how it goes

If you know I got no shame
Ain't about the money, it's about the power (no shame)
Ain't about the money, it's about the power (you know I got no shame)
Ain't about the money, it's about the power (no shame)
Ain't about the money, it's about the power
