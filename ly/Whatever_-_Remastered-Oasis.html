		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm free to be whatever I
Whatever I choose, and I'll sing the blues if I want
I'm free to say whatever I
Whatever I like, if it's wrong or right, it's alright

Always seems to me
You only see what people want you to see
How long's it gonna be
Before we get on the bus and cause no fuss
Get a grip on yourself, it don't cost much

Free to be whatever you
Whatever you say, if it comes my way, it's alright
You're free to be wherever you
Wherever you please, you can shoot the breeze if you want

It always seems to me
You only see what people want you to see
How long's it gonna be
Before we get on the bus and cause no fuss
Get a grip on yourself, it don't cost much

Free to be whatever I
Whatever I choose, and I'll sing the blues if I want

Here in my mind
You know you might find
Something that you
You thought you once knew
But now it's all gone
And you know it's no fun
Yeah, I know it's no fun
Oh, I know it's no fun

I'm free to be whatever I
Whatever I choose, and I'll sing the blues if I want
I'm free to be whatever I
Whatever I choose, and I'll sing the blues if I want

Whatever you do, whatever you say
I know it's alright
Whatever you do, whatever you say
I know it's alright
