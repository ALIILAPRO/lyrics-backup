		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh my goodness
What have I done?
Oh no, I can't believe it
It's like I've got the whole world in my palm
And I'm ready to drop bombs

Welcome to the Slim Shady Mecca, Rebecca
It's the village in New York, right next to the Tribeca
That's my sector, homosexual dissector
Come again, rewind selector
I said nice rectum, I had a vasectomy, Hector
So you can't get pregnant if I bisexually wreck ya
Hannibal Lector in the guy section, I bet ya
I tantalize ya in the less than five seconds I get ya
They say once bitten then twice shy, well lie next to the guy
With nine ecstasy pills and five extra
Boxes of ripped condoms and quantities, why yes, sir
I took the rest of the Lunesta pills for my dresser
That's my kind of vibe, what else should I try, Lester?
Drop-kick the bitch before her second trimester
Performed the home abortion with Dexter, then I guess I'll
Dig her fetus out with a wire hanger, then digest her

I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pen
How should I begin it and where does it all end?
The world is just my medicine ball, you're all in
I said, I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pen
How should I begin it and where does it all end?
My medicine ball, you're in my medicine ball, friends

All my Westside bitches, throw it up
Put a balloon inside your pussy, queef, and blow it up
Man, I think that he just fell off the deep end, sure enough
So you better change the station to keep from throwin' up
Man, you seen it all before, you're all to familiar with it
There's a penis on the floor and two balls, so you know who did it
You know you with it, girl, don't front, oh no, you didn't
I won't rape all the Pussycat Dolls? Nicole, you kiddin'?
I'll pee on Rihanna, see man, I do what I wanna
Spray perfume in the sauna room, crazy gluin' Madonna
To the La-Z-Boy sofa, fold her in two, then sit on her
Imagine the visual for that, man, who would've thought I
Could ever be such a relentless prick, unleashin' his vengeance
But the chick's so old, she looks like she outlived a life sentence
I never meant this rhyme to be so offensive
If you weren't so defensive, it wouldn't be, you're so sensitive

I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pen
How should I begin it and where does it all end?
The world is just my medicine ball, you're all in
I said, I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pen
How should I begin it and where does it all end?
My medicine ball, you're in my medicine ball, friends

Put Christopher Reeves on a unicycle with a kickstand
Kick it up and push him and lead him right into quicksand
Here, you need a hand, big man? Grab hold of this branch
With both hands, man, they don't understand I'm just a sick man
Now everybody's pissed at me like it's my fault 
His name rhymes with so many different words, jeez
So one last time, Mr. Christopher Reeves
Won't you break it down for me and just spit the verse, please?
Eminem, I'm coming to kill you
Always hated you, and I still do
You'll never fill my shoes, my Superman costume
Doesn't even fit you, they don't feel you
You're taking this shit too far
Who do you think you are? Hang my suit up in the armoire
Everyday I hate you more and more
Throw down the cardboard
Let's break down you think you're hardcore

I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pen
How should I begin it and where does it all end?
The world is just my medicine ball, you're all in
I said, I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pen
How should I begin it and where does it all end?
My medicine ball, you're in my medicine ball, friends

The world is mine
