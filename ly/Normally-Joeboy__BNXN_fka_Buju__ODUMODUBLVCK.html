		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  See my bros them turn up
Yeah my brother
Real life shit no Hannah Montana
Roll my J, go about my day
No brother like stress and I no like drama

When we in the club it's a champagne shower
Only see blessing, never see yawa
Can't understand there's a higher power
And we special yeah we nuh do normal no

Normally normally normally

Normally normally normally nor-mally

Na why we dey burn trees dey shacky spirit
Remember when we no get say you wouldn't believe it
mehn I got a couple friends to confirm the lyrics
You wouldn't believe it
Normal normal, e go surely better
Nah dem be singing my songs like Yvonne Chaka Chaka
Now we living better
No more jaga jaga, Oluwa blessing my feet so I'm moving proper

Hallelujah fun Oloun Oba
Bo se jen sin nisi omo eru doba
If na right now mehn I go see you later
Nothing fit to shake me
If e no be paper that be normal

Hallelujah fun Oloun Oba
Bo se jen sin nisi omo eru doba
If na right now omo I go see you later
Nothing fit to shake me
If e no be paper that be normal

Physically I be like person wey drink Agbo
Spiritually my charges dey block off olosho
Fuck up any flow
MODU go turn up any show (eh)
katakata ranger
oghenebiko (pra)
Anytime we pull up them go know
Pressure
Their kele dey hustle for my bone
Leisure
Pleasure
When I use it as a weapon (eh)
The thing dey be like say
Her body don Dey tremor
Naso I Dey waka waka
Many men tuama
Many men tuama
When I been dey fire fire
Men dem gabadaya o
Men dem gabadaya

Normally I bad (eh)
Diligent soldier
MODU covered by the spirit
Joeboy settle for your glory
Buju roll it up
Take ten tokes
Before OLOKPA come here meet us (idiots)
Nobody go gree for their akpor

See my bros them turn up
Yeah my brother
Real life shit no Hannah Montana
Roll my J, go about my day
No brother like stress and I don't like drama

When we in the club it's a champagne shower
Only see blessing, never see yawa
Can't understand there's a higher power
And we special yeah we nuh do normal no

Normally normally normally

Normally normally nor-mally
Yeah yeah

Mehn na normal thing
Normally normally normally
Normally normally normally yeah
