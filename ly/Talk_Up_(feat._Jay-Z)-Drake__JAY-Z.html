		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ayy, ayy
Lot of 6's in here tonight
Yeah, yeah, ayy

Ten of us, we movin' as one (movin' as one)
I'm so proud of who I've become
You might think I've taken some lumps
Only if we talkin' 'bout sums (yeah)
Intentions are pure, they cannot tell me relax
My mentions are jokes, but they never give me the facts
This isn't that, can't be ignorin' the stats
Based off of that, they gotta run me the max
They gotta run me the max, they gotta double the racks
They had it set up for real, but they didn't come with the slaps
When I heard the I was skippin' through that
If I get it trippin', it's no comin' back
I don't understand, these gotta adapt
You know where I'm at, I put the 6 on the map
Your shorty was bent, she wanted to vent
I promise it fell in my lap
My money is young, my problems are old
I promise I'm bridgin' the gap

You know what I'm sayin'? (Woo)
Ayy, ayy, yeah
You know what I'm sayin'?
(Gyeah, gyeah, gyeah, gyeah)

Provoke, this ain't a joke, man, nobody playin'
He's at the top and he's at the top, but nobody stayin'
These around but they ain't around
You know what I'm sayin'?
Say that they down, when they is down
You know what I'm sayin'?

Yeah, you know what I'm sayin'?
Ayy, ayy, yeah
You know what I'm sayin'?

Yo, get close enough to HOV, smell like a still
First album 26, I ain't need no deal
Already a hood legend, I ain't need no shine
First Rollie flooded out, I ain't see no time, woah
Stand-up niggas, we only duckin' indictments
Dope boys, Off-White, lookin' like soft white on 'em, heh
You know what I'm sayin'?
We in the buildin', we came for a billion, ain't nobody playin'
Live every word that I'm rappin'
Said I lost 90 and it happened
You probably wouldn't believe 
Everything that you seein' right now if it wasn't live action
I ain't on the 'Gram, they record who I am
God to these dope boys, how you not be a HOV fan?
I'm what Meech shoulda been
I'm what Supreme didn't become
If Alpo didn't snitch, be like Young
I got your president Tweetin', I won't even meet with him
Y'all killed X, let Zimmerman live, streets is done

You know what I'm sayin'?
Ayy, ayy, yeah
You know what I'm sayin'?

Provoke, this ain't a joke, man, nobody playin'
He's at the top, then he's at the top, but nobody stayin'
These around but they ain't around
You know what I'm sayin'?
Say that they down, when they is down
You know what I'm sayin'?

Yeah, you know what I'm sayin'?
Ayy, ayy, yeah
You know what I'm sayin'?
