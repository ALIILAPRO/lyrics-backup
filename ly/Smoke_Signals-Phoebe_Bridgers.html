		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I went with you up to the place you grew up
And we spent a week in the cold
Just long enough to Walden it with you
Any longer, it would've got old
Singin' "Ace of Spades" when Lemmy died
But nothing's changed, L.A.'s alright
I'm sleepin' in my bed again
And gettin' in my head and then
Walk around the reservoir

You
You must've been lookin' for me
Sendin' smoke signals
Pelicans circling
Burnin' trash out on the beach

One of your eyes is always half-shut
Somethin' happened when you were a kid
I didn't know you then and I'll never understand
Why it feels like I did
"How Soon Is Now" in an eighties sedan
You slept inside of it because your dad
Lived in a campground in the back of a van
You said that song'll creep you out until you're dead

And you
Must've been lookin' for me
Sendin' smoke signals
Pelicans circling
Burnin' trash out on the beach

I wanna live at the Holiday Inn
Where somebody else makes the bed
We'll watch TV while the lights on the street
Put all the stars to death
It's been on my mind since Bowie died
Just checking out to hide from life
And all of our problems, I'm gonna solve 'em
With you ridin' shotgun
Speeding 'cause fuck the cops

And you
You must've been lookin' for me
Sendin' smoke signals
Pelicans circling
Burnin' trash out on the beach

Mm-mm

I buried a hatchet, it's comin' up lavender
The future's unwritten, the past is a corridor
I'm at the exit, lookin' back through the hall
You are anonymous, I am a concrete wall
