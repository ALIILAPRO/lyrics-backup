		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wake up young man
It's time to wake up
Your love affair has got to go
For ten long years
For ten long years
The leaves to rake up
Slow suicide's no way to go
Oh

Blue clouded gray
You're not a crack up
Dizzy and weakened by the haze
Movin' onward
So an infection not a phase
Yeah oh

The cracks and lines
From where you gave up
They make an easy man to read
Oh oh, oh oh
For all the times 
You let them bleed you
For a little peace from God you plead
And beg
For a little peace from God you plead

Oh oh oh oh
Yeah oh
Oh oh oh oh
Yeah oh
Oh oh oh oh
Yeah oh

Wake up young man
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Oh yeah

Wake up young man
It's time to wake up
Your love affair has got to go, yeah
For ten long years
For ten long years
The leaves the rake up
Slow suicide's no way to go oh, oh oh
Slow suicide's no way to go

Wake up, wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up
