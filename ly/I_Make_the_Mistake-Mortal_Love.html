		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now close your eyes...

You're present in my sleep
You hunt me when I'm awake
My soul you seem to keep
My heart will weep again and again and again...

These days in my head
Make me feel you are the one...
These dreams in my head seem real...

(In my heart)
You're in my heart
You're in my soul
(In my soul)
Want you close
(In my heart)
You're in my heart

You're present in my sleep
You hunt me when I'm awake
My soul you seem to keep
My heart will weep again and again and again...

These days in my head
Make me feel you are the one...
These dreams in my head seem real...

You're in my heart
(In my heart)
You're in my soul
Want you close
(In my soul)
You're in my heart
(In my heart)
You're in my soul
