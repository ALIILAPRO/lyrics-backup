		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  An avenue once bent in shadow
In a morning straight and hallow
You hold high a destination
You sing to me of sweet revelation
I feel the quickening in my step
But I don't even touch the ground

'Cause when I'm seeing double
It's your lullaby love that
Keeps me from trouble
It's your lullaby love that's
Keeping me level
It's your lullaby love that keeps me awake

When this voice retires from talking
When these ears are tired of ringing
When my feet get bored of travelling
And it looks like it's all unravelling
When this heart's too old for dreaming
That's when I hear the
Angels sing your lullaby

'Cause when I'm seeing double
It's your lullaby love that
Keeps me from trouble
It's your lullaby love that's
Keeping me level
It's your lullaby love that keeps me awake

'Cause when I'm seeing double
It's your lullaby love that
Keeps me from trouble
It's your lullaby love that's
Keeping me level
It's your lullaby love that keeps me awake
