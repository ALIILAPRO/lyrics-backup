		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Cook that shit up Quay

I had to spread my wings, jump out my nest
Ran out of Act so I'm pourin' up red
I took the harder way like I'm Derez
Shout out the doctor keep givin' these meds
I got the streets in a lock like some dreds
Ride on the back of that bitch like some pegs
Runnin' this shit, they should cut off my legs
Had to play a little smarter, I'm using my head
Dropped out of school, took the street way instead
I'm a lil dope boy, I want me some bread
I'ma shoot at your body, won't aim for your neck
I just cashed out on a flooded Patek
It ain't a bill when my diamond is big enough
I just came home from the can, I'ma live it up
I rep the gang, when you see me, I throw it up
I just spent three hundred racks on a Bentley truck

Screamin' out gang gang gang gang gang
I do this shit for the gang
I didn't get in this for fame
Nigga ain't takin' my chain
I'ma stand firm with my name
They say you get money, you change
I got the money and stayed the same
I'm tryna stay in my lane

Gotta maintain, can't go back broke
Gotta stand tall, won't be in the fold
Drop top 'Vette, tryna keep it in a Rolls
Ain't signin' no deal, ain't sellin' my soul
Gotta run it up fast, my mama gettin' old
I'm a million dollar nigga, gotta reach my goal
Got the hood on my back, still throwin' up fours
They say the Act gettin' low, still pourin' up fours
I pour the six if it cost me
I like to fuck on your ho on the balcony
I got the cheese and I got me some broccolli
All color money, this shit like Monopoly
Can't get this drip, ain't no need for you watchin' me
I ran my racks up and I moved out of poverty
I'm keepin' designer all over my body
I got some Buscemi, I got new Givenchy
Damn I thought I'd never see the day
I'm so glad I made it through the rain
They don't wanna see a nigga straight
They don't wanna see young Gunna paid
Take a long time, I had to wait
Want this penthouse, a lot of space
A lot of hundreds comin' our way
Bust it down, split it with the gang

Screamin' out gang gang gang gang gang
I do this shit for the gang
I didn't get in this for fame
Nigga ain't takin' my chain
I'ma stand firm with my name
They say you get money, you change
I got the money and stayed the same
I'm tryna stay in my lane

I used to sleep on the floor for a mattress
Getting evicted, that shit was embarrassing
My mama didn't have it, we made us a palettes
I had to share with the roaches and rats
Keep gettin' money these voices keep telling me
I went to prison, it made me a better me
I can't get no job, I got too many felonies
I been on probation since I was like seventeen
I done got me some stripes in the hood like a referee
I used to walk into school with that fire on me
I'm gettin' money, ain't really got time to beef
I don't know why these lil bitches be lyin' on me
I'm in the jungle for real where them lions be
I'm goin' apeshit, they callin' me Willy B
Niggas be sayin' they gon' rob me but we'll see
I'm gon' make every nigga with 'em fear me

Screamin' out gang gang gang gang gang
I do this shit for the gang
I didn't get in this for fame
Nigga ain't takin' my chain
I'ma stand firm with my name
They say you get money, you change
I got the money and stayed the same
I'm tryna stay in my lane

Run it all up and stay the same, yeah
I'ma run it all up and stay the same
Run it all up and stay the same, yeah
I'ma run it all up and stay the same
I will not change for shit, I got my name from this
I will not change for shit, I got my name from this
I will not change for shit, I got my name from this
I will not change for shit, I got my name from this
Run it all up and stay the same, yeah
I'ma run it all up and stay the same
