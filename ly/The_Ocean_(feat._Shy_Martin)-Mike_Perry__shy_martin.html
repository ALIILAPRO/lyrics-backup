		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You can be my guiding light
Keep me company in the night
That's all I need, all I want
Is for you to stay a little longer now
With arms around me like a border

Like the air I breathe
I let you in
Keep me warm underneath my skin
'Cause I'm
Giving in to your touch
I can never get enough
Diving deep into the ocean

Ocean
Ocean
Ocean

You can be my safety zone
Somewhere I can go when I feel alone
That's all I need, all I want
Is to stay a little longer now
Arms around me like a border

Like an endless stream
You take me in
To a place that I've never been
Now I'm
Giving in to your touch
I will never get enough
Diving deep into the ocean

Ocean
Ocean
Ocean
