		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh, ooh, ooh
I just wanna ride for you, baby
I just wanna ride
I just wanna ride with you, baby

Damn, she's an eight, damn, she's a nine
She ain't no eleven but damn, she's a dime
Ten on my line, ten I can call (Ten I can call)
Few want love, some just wanna fuck
Damn, she's a, uh, damn, she's a nine
She ain't no eleven but damn, she's a dime
Damn, she's a, uh, damn, she's a dime
Damn, she's a (she shouldn't have rewarded you)

She said she a Taurus but her moon sign a Gemini (She's a Gemi)
Said she like a bad bitch, I'm like, "So do I" (Said she like a bad bitch)
Way she wearin' that dress, somethin' criminal (Oh)
She might let you get her wet but she don't stay the night
She wants top floors and Christian Diors (Christian Diors)
You can give her what she want then she gon' want more
She gon' take what she can get then she gon' get bored
She gon' turn to someone else, preservation of herself, oh, oh
I don't know who you been lately (I don't know)
Only hit me when you're faded (Hit me)
Only one who needs me waitin' (Ooh, ooh)
When'd you get so cold, babe?

Damn, she's an eight, damn, she's a nine
She ain't no eleven but damn, she's a dime
Ten on my line (Yeah), ten I can call (Yeah)
Few want love, some just wanna fuck (Yeah)
Damn, she's a, uh (Yeah), damn, she's a nine (Yeah)
She ain't no eleven but damn, she's a dime
Damn, she's a, uh, damn, she's a dime
Damn, she's a (she shouldn't have rewarded you)

I got ten in my place (Place)
She just wanna party, said her friends on the way (Friends on the way)
Make sure this tequila '42, that's her drink ('42)
How these pretty women end up in love with me, gettin' drunk with me? (Gettin' drunk with me)
I got ten different states (Ayy)
Different skin tone, different size, different shapes (Shapes)
Different kind of vibes, she get live in my day (Got her live)
Only thing they all got in common it's the waist, it's the eyes and the face on ten

Damn, she's an eight, damn, she's a nine
She ain't no eleven but damn, she's a dime
Ten on my line (Ooh), ten I can call
Few want love, some just wanna fuck
Damn, she's a, uh, damn, she's a nine (Damn, she's a)
She ain't no eleven but damn, she's a dime
Damn, she's a, uh, damn, she's a dime (Ooh)
Damn, she's a
(She don't wanna give a damn to you)
