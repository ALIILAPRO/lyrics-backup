		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is the final time I'm wakin' up
Inside a dream that doesn't break enough
Of the soul that I once was
In the light I once loved

I can see it shining through the trees
A reflection of a crimson key
And I hesitate to feel something
In the presence of a cold
Emotional vampire
Invited inside, I dream I die
Hidden from the light

You wanna cover me in ultraviolet
To a river flowing back in time
Dream I die, dream I die
If you can meet me in another life and
We can burn into the velvet sky
Dream I die, dream I die

I can feel, the end is haunting me
Mirror image staring back into a thousand lifetimes
Fearing what the light finds

I can see it shining through the trees
A reflection of a crimson key
And I hesitate to feel something
'Cause I don't belong here

You wanna cover me in ultraviolet
To a river flowing back in time
Dream I die, dream I die
If you can meet me in another life and
We can burn into the velvet sky
Dream I die, dream I die

You know where you want to go 
Never too close 
Never too late 
There's always time 

Dream I die
