		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She's dressed in black again
And I'm falling down again
Down to the floor again
I'm begging for more again
But, oh, what can you do when she's dressed in black?

My mind wanders endlessly
On paths where she's leading me
With games that she likes to play
And words that she doesn't say
Not when we're alone and she's dressed in black

As a picture of herself
She's a picture of the world
A reflection of you, a reflection of me
And it's all there to see if you only give in to the fire within

(Oh-oh) dressed in black again
(Oh-oh) dressed in black again
(Oh-oh) dressed in black again
(Oh-oh) dressed in black again

Shadows fall onto me
As she stands there over me
And waits to encompass me
I lay here helplessly
But, oh, what can you do when she's dressed in black?

(Oh-oh) dressed in black again
(Oh-oh) dressed in black again
(Oh-oh) dressed in black again
(Oh-oh) dressed in black again

(Oh-oh) dressed in black again
(Oh-oh) dressed in black again
(Oh-oh) dressed in black again
(Oh-oh) dressed in black again
