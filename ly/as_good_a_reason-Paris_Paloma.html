		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I met a woman with lips so red
A face so lined like spider webs
I'll always remember the things she said
They were so wise, she ope'd my eyes and they'll never close again

Oh, how she sighed when she stubbed her cigarette
I felt compelled to enquire of her success
How do you do? How can you be so in love with yourself?
Tell me please 'cause I need help

She said
Every time you are succeeding
There's an old man somewhere, seething
And spite's as good a reason to take his power

When you hate the body you are in
Oh love, you're acting just for him
As he counts his gold and green in his ivory tower

Our fear it lines his pockets love
So take that rage and bottle up
And put a drop into his cup of wine

You don't need him, you don't need me
With that poisoned bottle you'll be free
But be damn sure you don't mix it up with mine

I met a young girl with eyes so bright
She was already getting sick of life
Her arms were laden with his merchandise
She asked me why I no longer try and waste my time
And I said "spite"

'Cause every time you are succeeding
There's an old man somewhere seething
And spite's as good a reason to take his power

When you hate the body you are in
Oh love, you're acting just for him
As he counts his gold and green in his ivory tower

Our fear it lines his pockets love
So take that rage and bottle up
And put a drop into his cup of wine

You don't need him, you don't need me
With that poisoned bottle you'll be free
But be damn sure you don't mix it up with mine
Be damn sure you don't mix it up with mine

I met a woman with lips so red
Always remember the things she said
