		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, I stand up next to a mountain
And I chop it down with the edge of my hand
Well, I stand up next to a mountain
Chop it down with the edge of my hand
Well, I pick up all the pieces and make an island
Might even raise a little sand, yeah
'Cause I'm a voodoo child
Lord knows I'm a voodoo child, baby

Want to say one more last thing

I didn't mean to take - up all your sweet time
I'll give it right back to you one of these days
I said, I didn't mean to take up all your sweet time
I'll give it right back one of these days, yeah
And if I don't meet you no more in this world
Then I'll, I'll meet you in the next one
Now don't be late, don't be late
'Cause I'm a voodoo child, voodoo child
Lord knows I'm a voodoo child, hey, hey, hey

I'm a voodoo child, baby
I don't take no for an answer
Just want you to know
