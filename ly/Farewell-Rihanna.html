		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wherever you're going, I wanna go
Wherever you're heading, can you let me know
I don't mind catching up, I'm on my way
Just can't take the thought of you miles away

And I know you're going somewhere to make a better life
I hope that you find it on the first try
And even though it kills me that you have to go
I know it will be sadder if you never hit the road

So farewell
Somebody's gonna miss you
Farewell
Somebody's gonna wish that you were here
That somebody is me

I will write to tell you what's going on
But you won't miss nothing but the same old song
If you don't mind catching up
I'll spend the day telling you stories about a land far away
But I know

And I know you're going somewhere to make a better life
I hope that you find it on the first try
And even though it kills me that you have to go
I know it'll be sadder if you never hit the road

So farewell
Somebody's gonna miss you
Farewell
Somebody's gonna wish that you were here
Farewell
Somebody's gonna miss you
Farewell
Somebody's gonna wish that you were here
That somebody is me

And I'm gon' try to hold it all in
Try to hold back my tears
So it don't make you stay here, yeah
I'ma try to be a big girl now
'Cause I don't wanna be
The reason you don't leave

Farewell
Somebody's gonna miss you
Farewell
Somebody's gonna wish that you were here
Farewell
Somebody's gonna miss you
Farewell
Somebody's gonna wish that you were here
That somebody is me
