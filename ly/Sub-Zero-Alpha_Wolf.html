		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're just a pussy in a black hoodie pushing your luck
Hang your head in the light but show your teeth in the dark
Another false reflection
Ill intended imposter
You're not who you say you are

Humility crushed like an insect
The conversation screamed to a halt
And I just need a goddamn cigarette
To fill my lungs
Extort the pain

I've never felt so numb
Armed with jagged nails
Razors under the tongue
Goddamn I'm uncomfortably numb
Strapped with apprehension because I am just not like you
You're barking like a dog but I'm a fucking wolf

Ghost of you
Leave me be

You're just a pussy in a black hoodie pushing your luck
Hang your head in the light but show your teeth in the dark
Another false reflection
Ill intended imposter
Your head hung like the trash that you are

Haven't you heard?
I'm impersonal
I'm unsociable
But I see you looking this way
So come and break it off if you want a piece

Burn down your bridges and spit in the water beneath
Burn
