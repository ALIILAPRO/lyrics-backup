		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm sitting in a room
Made up of only big white walls
And in the halls
There are people looking through the window and the door
They know exactly what we're here for
Don't look up, just let them think
There's no place else you'd rather be

You're always on display
For everyone to watch and learn from
Don't you know by now
You can't turn back
Because this road is all you'll ever have

And it's obvious that you're dying, dying
Just living proof that the camera's lying
And oh, oh open wide
'Cause this is your night, so smile
'Cause you'll go out in style
You'll go out in style

If you let me I could
I'd show you how to build your fences
Set restrictions
Separate from the world
The constant battle that you hate to fight
Just blame the limelight

Don't look up just let them think
There's no place else you'd rather be in now
You can't turn back
Because this road is all you'll ever have

And it's obvious that you're dying, dying
Just living proof that the camera's lying
And oh, oh open wide
Cause this is your night, so smile

Yeah, yeah you're asking for it
With every breath that you breathe in
Just breathe it in
Yeah, yeah well you're just a mess
You do all this big talking
So now let's see you walking
I said let's see you walking

Yeah, yeah well you're just a mess
You do all this big talking
So now let's see you walking
I said let's see you walking

And it's obvious that you're dying, dying
Just living proof that the camera's lying
And oh, oh open wide
Yeah oh, oh open wide
Yeah oh, oh open wide
'Cause you'll go out in style
You'll go out in style
