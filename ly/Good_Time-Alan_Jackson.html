		  (Good time)

Work, work all week long
Punchin' that clock from dusk 'till dawn
Countin' the days 'till Friday night
That's when all the conditions are right
For a good time
I need a good time

Yeah, I've been workin' all week
And I'm tired and I don't wanna sleep
I wanna have fun
It's time for a good time

I cashed my check, cleaned my truck
Put on my hat, forgot about work
Sun goin' down, head across town
Pick up my baby and turn it around
Good time,
Oh, I need a good time

I've been workin' all week
And I'm tired and I don't wanna sleep
I wanna have fun
It's time for a good time

Hey!

Pig in the ground, beer on ice
Just like ol' Hank taught us about
Singin' along, Bocephus songs
Rowdy friends all night long
Good time
Lord, we're having a good time

Yeah, I've been workin' all week
And I'm tired and I don't wanna sleep
I wanna have fun
It's time for a good time

Woah

Heel toe dosey doe
Scootin' our boots, swingin' doors
B n' D Kix and Dunn
Honkin' tonk heaven, double shotgun
Good time
Lord, we're havin' a good time

'Cause I've been workin' all week
And I'm tired and I don't wanna sleep
I wanna have fun
It's time for a good time

Shot of Tequila, beer on tap
Sweet southern woman set on my lap
G with an O, O with an D
T with n' I and an M and n' E
And a good time
Good time

I've been workin' all week
And I'm tired and I don't wanna sleep
I wanna have fun
It's time for a good time

A Shot of Tequila
Beer on tap
A good looking woman
To sit on my lap

A G with an O, an O with a D
A T with an I an M with an E
That spells good time
A good time

Oh, I've been workin' all week
And I'm tired and I don't wanna sleep
I wanna have fun
It's time for a good time

Twelve o'clock, two o'clock three o'clock four
Five o'clock we know were that's gonna go
Closing the door, shuttin' 'em down
Head for that Waffle House way across town
Good time
Oh, we're havin' a good time

Oh, I've been workin' all week
And I'm tired and I don't wanna sleep
I wanna have fun
It's time for a good time

Oh, I've been workin' all week
And I'm tired and I don't wanna sleep
I wanna have fun
It's time for a good time

Oh, I've been workin' all week
And I'm tired and I don't wanna sleep
I wanna have fun
It's time for a good time

Oh, yeah, a good time

I need a good time

Yeah, a good time
