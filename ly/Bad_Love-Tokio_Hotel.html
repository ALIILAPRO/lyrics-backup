		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm back at the start
I'm all out of the luck
'Cause all that I got is another bad love
I'm falling apart
It's keeping me up
'Cause all that I got is another bad love

I'd give you sacrifices
Take you to paradise
I'll be there by your side
Or close behind, you feel me breathe
I've been to a thousand places
I crossed the seven seas
I see you everywhere
But you don't even notice me

And again and again and again I'm all caught up
All caught up
Made a fool of myself 'cause I thought you were the one

I'm back at the start
I'm all out of the luck
'Cause all that I got is another bad love
I'm falling apart
It's keeping me up
'Cause all that I got is another bad love

Another bad love
Love
Another bad love
Love

You've got me on my knees and
You're my fantasies
I'll be there by your side
Or close behind, you feel me breathe
I've been to a thousand places
I crossed the seven seas
I see you everywhere but you don't even notice me

And again and again and again I'm all caught up
All caught up
Made a fool of myself 'cause I thought you were the one

I'm back at the start
I'm all out of the luck
'Cause all that I got is another bad love
I'm falling apart
It's keeping me up
'Cause all that I got is another bad love

Another bad love
Love
Another bad love
Love

I'm back at the start
