		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  (Mike Will made it)

Drive my heart into the night
You can drop the keys off in the morning (in the morning)
'Cause I don't wannna leave home, without your love
Without it

You told me that you wanted this
I told you it was all yours, if you're done with it
Then what you say forever for?
If forevers out the door
I'll ignore, when you call

Drive my heart into the night
Yeah
You can drop the keys off in the morning (in the morning)
'Cause I don't want to leave home, without your love
Without it

You told me you were coming back (right back)
Promised it was real and I believed that
But if I fall for it again, I will be a fool
If our love is at the end, then why do I still want you yeah
But I guess I got no valentine
Send me roses I just let 'em die
I was crazy thinking you were mine
It was all just a lie

Drive my heart into the night
You can drop the keys off in the morning
'Cause I don't want to leave home, (leave home) without your love
Without it

I always knew I never wanted this
I never thought it could happen (it could happen)
You acted like you wanted this
But then you led me on (led me on)

I thought you would be there when I go (I go)
You promised you would be there when I go (I go)
But all the broken promises I won't miss, I'm finished
All I know are the facts
That when I look you in the eyes all I see are the lies
Been there, done that

Drive my heart into the night
You can drop the keys off in the morning (In the morning)
'Cause I don't want to leave home, without your love
Without it hey hey, uh
