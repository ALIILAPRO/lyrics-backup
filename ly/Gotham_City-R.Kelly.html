		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm lookin' over the skyline of the city
How loud quiet nights in the mist of crime
How next door to happiness lives sorrow
And signals of solution in the sky

A city of justice, a city of love
A city of peace for everyone of us
We all need it, can't live without it
A Gotham City, oh yeah

How sleeping awake because of fear (oh yeah)
How children are drowning in their tears
How we need a place where we can go
A land where every one will have a hero (even me)

A city of justice (yeah), a city of love
A city of peace for everyone of us
'Cause we all need it, yeah, can't live without it
A Gotham City, yeah, yeah

A city of justice (yeah, yeah), a city of love (woo)
A city of peace for everyone of us
'Cause we all need it, yeah, can't live without it
A Gotham City, woo, yeah, yeah

Yet in the middle of stormy weather
We won't stumble and we won't fall (woo)
I know a place that offers shelter

City of justice (oh yeah), city of love (a city of love)
A city of peace for everyone of us (oh, 'cause we all need)
We all need it, can't live without it (can't live without it)
Gotham City, oh yeah

We need a city of justice (oh yeah), city of love (a city of love)
A city of peace for everyone of us (for every, so please because)
We all need it, yeah, can't live without it
Gotham City, oh yeah (come on, tell me, can you)

A city of justice (oh yeah), city of love (a city of love)
A city of peace for everyone of us (a city of peace for everyone of us)
'Cause we all need it, yeah, can't live without it
Gotham City, oh yeah

A Gotham City
Everybody needs Gotham City
A Gotham City
Don't you want one, oh yeah
Come on, come on, Gotham City
Everybody needs Gotham City
A Gotham City
Don't you want one, oh yeah
Children sing

A Gotham City (haha, yeah)
A Gotham City
A Gotham City
A Gotham City
A Gotham City
A Gotham City
