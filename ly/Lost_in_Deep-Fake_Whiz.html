		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You don't know what to say
You can't feel whole again
After meeting a PUA
There is no way you can be back
You spend all night just to reflect
On how things ended like this
You try to find a reason
For your misery that still persists
So you keep falling down
Into this abyss
The more you look around
The darker it gets
The scar left in your heart
Time can probably heal
One thing can be sure
You've been lost in deep
Wake up this moment
There's nothing you will ever need to bring back
You're trapped in the quicksand of your thought
Sure as hell it was the end
The only thing you really ought to care about
It's to get out get out
You spend all night just to reflect
On how things ended up like this
You try to find a reason
For your misery that still persists
So you keep falling down
Into this abyss
The more you look around
The darker it gets
The scar left in your heart
Time can probably heal
Only one thing can be sure
You've been lost in deep
You spend all night just to reflect
On how things ended up like this
You try to find a reason
For your misery that still persists
So you keep falling down
Into this abyss
The more you look around
The darker it gets
The scar left in your heart
Time can probably heal
Only one thing can be sure
You've been lost in deep
So you keep falling down
Into this abyss
The more you look around
The darker it gets
The scar left in your heart
Time can probably heal
Only one thing can be sure
You've been lost in deep
