		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I remember yesterday
The rain fell to the earth
For I dream of your arrival
And color my dark world with faith

Knowing you would be the strong one
To keep my focus in close view

I thank the heavens above
For the angel beside me today
The guardian of my sanity
The one who will save my soul
If I ever doubt the faith I hold
I only need one smile from you
And an autumn reflection
Will deliver me to your arms

Someday you will understand
How much you mean to me
For every day that passes me by
I long for the person you will become

I thank the heavens above
For the angel beside me today
The guardian of my sanity
The one who will save my soul
If I ever doubt the faith I hold
I only need one smile from you
And an autumn reflection
Will deliver me to your arms

I am stronger now
Since you came into my life
With a thought of your smile
I remember yesterday
