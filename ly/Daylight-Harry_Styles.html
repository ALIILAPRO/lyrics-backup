		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm on the roof
You're in your airplane seat
I was nose bleedin'
Lookin' for life out there
Readin' your horoscope
You were just doing cocaine
In my kitchen, you never listen
I hope you're missin' me by now

If I was a bluebird
I would fly to ya
You'd be the spoon
Dip you in honey so I could be stickin' to you

Daylight, you got me cursin' the daylight (ooh)
Daylight, you got me cursin' the daylight (ooh)
Daylight, you got me callin' at all times (ooh)
Ain't gonna sleep 'til the daylight (ooh)

Out of New York
I'm on the comedown speed
We're on bicycles
Sayin' there's life out there
You got the antidote
I'll take one to go, go, please
Get the picture, cut out my middle
You ain't got time for me right now

If I was a bluebird
I would fly to ya
You'd be the spoon
Dip you in honey so I could be stickin' to you

(Ooh)
(Ooh)
Daylight, you got me callin' at all times (ooh)
Ain't gonna sleep 'til the daylight (ooh)

Daylight, you got me cursin' the daylight (ooh)
Daylight, you got me cursin' the daylight (ooh)
Daylight, you got me callin' at all times (ooh)
Ain't gonna sleep 'til the daylight (ooh)

If I was a bluebird
I would fly to ya
You'd be the spoon
Dip you in honey so I could be stickin' to you
