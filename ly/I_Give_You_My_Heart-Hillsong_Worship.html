		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is my desire
To honor You
Lord, with all my heart
I worship You
All I have within me 
I give You praise
All that I adore 
Is in You

Lord, I give You my heart 
I give You my soul
I live for you alone
And every breath that I take 
Every moment I'm awake
Lord, have Your way in me

This is my desire
To honor You
Lord, with all my heart
I worship You
All I have within me 
I give You praise
All that I adore 
Is in You

Lord, I give You my heart 
I give You my soul
I live for you alone
Every breath that I take 
Every moment I'm awake
Lord, have Your way in me

And I will live
And I will live for You
And I will live
And I will live for You

Oh and I will live
And I will live
And I will live for You

Lord, I give You my heart
I give You my soul, I live for You alone
Every breath that I take, every moment I'm awake
Lord, have Your way in me

Have Your way
Have Your way, have Your way
