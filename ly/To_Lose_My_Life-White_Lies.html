		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  He said to lose my life or lose my love
That's the nightmare I've been running from
So let me hold you in my arms a while
I was always careless as a child

And there's a part of me that still believes
My soul will soar above the trees
But a desperate fear flows through my blood
That a dead love's buried beneath the mud

Let's grow old together and die at the same time
Let's grow old together and die at the same time

I said I've got no time, I have to go
And I was more right than I will ever know
He said my heart is faded, well mine's regret
And left him crying next to the chapel steps

Let's grow old together and die at the same time
Let's grow old together and die at the same time
He said, let's grow old together and die at the same time
Let's grow old together and die at the same time
He said

He said to lose my life or lose my love
That's the nightmare I've been running from
So let me hold you in my arms a while (let's grow old together and die at the same time)
I was always careless as a child

There's a part of me that still believes (let's grow old together and die at the same time)
My soul will soar above the trees
A desperate fear flows through my blood (he said, let's grow old together and die at the same time)
A dead love's buried beneath the mud

A desperate fear flows through my blood (let's grow old together and die at the same time)
A dead love's buried beneath the mud
