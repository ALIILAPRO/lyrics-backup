		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The world is beyond us
It's too enormous
But oh, the island is just right
Let me move you
Come to the island
Where we can save our souls

You pick me up with a smile for my weakness
I'm bittersweet but you care about me
You found me lost in the chaos and confusion
You said it's possible that we can be free
You pick me up with the promise of love
Our names on the door at the island of real
You have a way of being gentle and tough
In every sense I think you know how I feel
You take my hand and then you sweep

The world is beyond us
It's too enormous
But oh, the island is just right
Let me move you
Come to the island
Where we can save our souls

You pick me up with a smile for my weakness
I'm bittersweet but you care about me
You found me lost in the chaos and confusion
You said it's possible that we can be free
And now I need a little hope

The world is beyond us
It's too enormous
But oh, the island is just right
Let me move you
Come to the island
Where we can save our souls

The world is beyond us
It's too enormous
But oh, the island is just right
It's the perfect size
Just right
It's the perfect size
Just right
It's the perfect size
Just right
It's the perfect size (for me)

And now I need a little hope
Irene, goodnight
Irene, goodnight

The world is beyond us
It's too enormous
But oh, the island is just right
Let me move you (Irene, goodnight)
Come to the island
Where we can save our souls
