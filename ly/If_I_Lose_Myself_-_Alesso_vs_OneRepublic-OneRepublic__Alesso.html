		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I stared up at the sun
Thought of all the people
Places and things I've loved

You can feel the light start to tremble
Washing what you know out to sea
You can see your life out of the window, tonight

If I lose myself tonight
It'll be by your side
If I lose myself tonight
Wooh, wooh, wooh!

If I lose myself tonight
It'll be you and I
Lose myself tonight

I woke up with the sun
Thought of all the people
Places and things I've loved

You can feel the light start to tremble
Washing what you know out to sea
You can see your life out the window, tonight

If I lose myself tonight
It'll be by your side
If I lose myself tonight
Wooh, wooh, wooh!

If I lose myself tonight
It'll be you and I
Lose myself tonight
Wooh!

Lose myself tonight

Wooh, wooh, wooh, wooh
Wooh, wooh, wooh, wooh
