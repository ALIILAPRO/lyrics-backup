		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mama was a pill poppin' pretty little number
Tendin' bar at the Quality Inn
Every single day she was upping the stakes
To a game that nobody could win
Her kids would stay the night with the neighbors
Mama wouldn't be home until later
We heard she was turning tricks for paper
That was just another Tuesday night in those trailers

White trash roots run deeper
I've done seen pain pills turn to needles
The things I've done to numb these feelings
Is something that you can't outrun
Whoa, whoa
You can't unlive where you're from

I know women who used to love by the hour
I've seen men fall in love with the powder
I ain't kidding y'all, I've seen fentanyl
Sneak in the deep and then sneak in and end it all
I learned early that that's life
I've seen dreams turn to ash at the end of a glass pipe

White trash roots run deeper
I've done seen pain pills turn to needles
The things I've done to numb these feelings
Is something that you can't outrun
Whoa, whoa
You can't unlive where you're from

You can't outlive it baby
But you can face it
(You can't unlive where you're from)
Embrace it all
And make the best of it
So let's go

Waking up and see another overdose
It left me down and broke and had to hit the bottle
Had an alcoholic uncle addicted to crack
I looked back and I had to hit the bottle
But mama got back on that powder
I could see in her eyes she was hollow
Babygirl was just doing the best she knew how to do
Raising her son with no father
Going deeper I won't even bother
Take your medicine hold it and swallow
But I can't sit and rot like the cinderblocks
Underneath this old broken Impala
In the front yard I go with the dogs
Pushin' up the weight there wasn't a weight bench
When Jelly was picking up calls back in Antioch
And takin' a major risk
I was in Alabama at the trailer park
Bangin' my head on the wall
Before I could buy my little girl a doll
Before Eminem ever gave me a call
I had that feeling that you have
But I hit that roof and that life flashed
Look around, sit down and write that
And Yelawolf took off on white trash

White trash roots run deeper
I've done seen pain pills turn to needles (I love y'all)
The things I've done to numb these feelings (let's go Jelly)
Is something that you can't outrun 
Whoa
You can't unlive where you're from
Whoa
You can't unlive where you're from
Whoa, whoa
