		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Santa baby, slip a sable under the tree
For me, (mhm) I've been an awful good girl
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight

Santa baby, a '54 convertible too, light blue
I'll wait up for you dear
Santa baby, and hurry down the chimney tonight

Think of all the fun I've missed
Think of all the fellas that I haven't kissed
Next year I could be just as good
If you'd check off my Christmas list

Santa baby, I wanna yacht and really that's not a lie
I've been an angel all year
Santa baby, and hurry down the chimney tonight, ooh yeah

Santa honey, the one thing that I really do need, the deed
To a platinum mine
Santa honey, so hurry down the chimney tonight

Come and trim my Christmas tree
With some decorations bought at Tiffany's
I really do believe in you
Let's see if you believe in me

Santa baby, forgot to mention one little thing, a ring
But I don't mean other phone
Santa baby, and hurry down the chimney tonight

So hurry down the chimney tonight
(Waiting, hurry)
(Tonight)
Hurry down the chimney tonight
