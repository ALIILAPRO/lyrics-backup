		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One day I will build a fountain
Drink and never grow old
Then I'll market an elixir
That will eliminate the common cold
Find your sickness on my list
Pay up front and make a wish
One day I will work with animals
All the tests I'm gonna do
All my stuffs completely natural
And when we're done
We'll boil 'em down for glue
That we can use to re-adhere
Your lips to mine if you were here
There's a lot I will never do
Some fantastic I know it's true
But not as much as my want to be with you
I can't stand to wait in line long
So I built a new machine
It just measures up the distance
And then eliminates the folks between
One day I'll construct a satellite
And I'll name it after you
'Cause you were the greatest friend of all
Except for when you split my lip in two
To see the look upon your face
As I launch you into space
There's a lot I will never do
Some fantastic I know its true
But not as much as my want to be with you
Bye bye self respect
I haven't had much of it since you left
I missed out on the best of you
Someday I will find the secret
To your social chemistry
Then I'll print it on a t-shirt
And it'll make you want to be with me
And if I wear it past your work
You'll see other guys are jerks
Much like pheromones for flies
You will not avoid my eyes
There's a lot I will never do
Some fantastic I know its true
Not as much as my want to be with you
Bye bye self respect
I haven't had much of it since you left
Even mice are bereft of you
I missed out on the best of you
Bye bye self respect
I haven't had much of it since you left
I missed out on the best of you
Bye bye bye (REPEAT)
