		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yes I know the secret
That's within your mind
You think all the people
Who worship you are blind
You're just like big brother
Giving us your trust
And when you have played enough
You'll just cast our souls
Into the dust
Into the dust

You thought that it would be easy
From the very start
Now I've found you out
I don't think you're so smart
I only have one more question
Before my time is through
Please I beg you tell me
In the name of hell
Who are you?
Who are you?

You thought that it would be easy
From the very start
Now I've found you out
I don't think you're so smart
I only have one more question
Before my time is through
Please I beg you tell me
In the name of hell
Who are you?
Who are you?
