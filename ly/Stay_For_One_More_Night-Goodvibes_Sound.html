		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All alone
In time
Punching cones
In time
All alone
In time
Punching cones
In time
All alone
In time
Feeling cold
Just stay for one more night
You'll be fine
On the phone
No wine
You can grow
If you stay here one more night
You'll be fine
Why don't you take the time to see
Just one more night could set you free
All over if you let it be
Why don't you stay one night with me
Come along
It's life
Dip your toes
And just play for one more night
You'll be fine
Why don't you take the time to see
Just one more night could set you free
All over if you let it be
Why won't you stay one night with me
Slow down
I'll be chasing
Chasing the light
We are free
Come on down
