		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Killing inside
I am commotion
Killing inside
Killing inside
I am destruction
Killing inside
Killing inside
I am burning fear
Killing inside
Killing inside
I am the killer, everyone dies

Look into my eyes
They come to murder, murder now
Everyone dies
Afflict them into a wall
Look into my eyes
The wars are rising now

Everyone dies
Take you from inside out

Killing inside
I am eternal
Killing inside
Killing inside
I am free too
Killing inside
Killing inside
I am immortal
Killing inside
Killing inside
I am forever, look in my eyes

Look in my eyes!

Look into my eyes
They come to murder, murder now
Everyone dies
Afflict them into a wall
Look into my eyes
The wars are rising now

Everyone dies
Take you from inside out

As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I feel no fear
What I fear is what is killing inside
And I know that the end is near

As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I feel no fear
What I fear is what is killing inside
And I know that the end is near

Everyone dies
Look in my eyes!
Murder now!

Look into my eyes
They come to murder, murder now
Everyone dies
Afflict them into a wall
Look into my eyes
The wars are rising now

Everyone dies
Take you from inside out
