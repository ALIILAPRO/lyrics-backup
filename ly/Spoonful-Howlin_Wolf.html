		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It could be a spoonful of diamond
Could be a spoonful of gold
Just a little spoon of your precious love
Satisfy my soul

Men lies about little
Some of them cries about little
Some of them dies about littles
Everything fight about a spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that sp-

It could be a spoonful of coffee
Could be a spoonful of tea
But a little spoon of your precious love
Good enough for me

Men lies about that
Some of them dies about that
Some of them cries about that
But everything fight about a spoonful

That spoon, that spoon, that-

Ooh-ooh, fight about spoonfuls
Ooh-ooh, fight about a spoonful

It could be a spoonful of water
Save you from the desert sand
But one spoon of lead from my forty-five
Save you from another man

Men lies about that
Some of them cries about that
Some of them dies about that
Everybody fightin' about a spoonful

That spoon, that spoon, that-
