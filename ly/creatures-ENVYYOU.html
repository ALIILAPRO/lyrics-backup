		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You know she's right, but you never quit
Fake love, tough job, sturdy centerpiece
Bad dream, wake up, but you're still asleep
Wait, it's not a dream? Huh
Big man, don't smoke, but you think it's cool
Walk in, blacked out, kids will never know
Rinse off cocaine left inside her shoe
But one day they'll know (they'll know, they'll know)
So long, Godspeed, all apologies fade
Sharp teeth, big smile, while you dance on our graves
(Ah ah ah)
We all know what you are
(Ah ah ah)
Pray nothing breaks your fall
You know she's right, won't you let it go
Nothing makes sense till she's on the floor
Go fetch, find God, not a centerfold
Won't you let it go, won't you, won't you let it go
Tell me why, tell me why
Things are meant to be
Where'd you go? Where'd you go?
Smell the gasoline
Tell me why, tell me why
Things are meant to be
Where'd you go? Where'd you go?
Smell the gasoline
So long, Godspeed, all apologies fade
Sharp teeth, big smile, while you dance on our graves
(Ah ah ah)
We all know what you are
(Ah ah ah)
Pray nothing breaks your fall
The silence is so loud
How the hell do you sleep at night? (yeah)
It's so loud, it's so loud
Silence so, silence so
Silence so loud, how the hell do you sleep?
Silence so, silence so
Silence so loud, how the hell do you sleep?
So long, Godspeed, all apologies fade
Sharp teeth, big smile, while you dance on our graves
(Ah ah ah)
We all know what you are
(Ah ah ah)
Pray nothing breaks your fall
