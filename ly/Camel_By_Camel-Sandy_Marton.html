		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sitting by the palm trees in the last oasis
Visions into my fantasy full of mystery
Dune after dune in the ocean of yellow sand
Wind is blowing silently in the sahara land

Camel by camel
Camel by camel

I try not to remember, no memories
I'm looking for a new dimension, new life to live
(Camel by camel) Mysterious places, perfect harmony
(Camel by camel) The desert route is changing my destiny

I can fly all over a golden desert sea
I feel good in my loneliness, just keeping me
Colors and perfumes in a crazy romance
The caravans moving easily in a camel dance

Camel by camel
Camel by camel

Camel by camel
Camel by camel

I try not to remember, no memories
I'm looking for a new dimension, new life to live
(Camel by camel) Mysterious places, perfect harmony
(Camel by camel) The desert route is changing my destiny

Camel by camel
Camel by camel

Sitting by the palm trees in the last oasis
Visions into my fantasy full of mystery
Dune after dune in the ocean of yellow sand
Wind is blowing silently in the Sahara land

Camel by camel
Camel by camel

I try not to remember, no memories
I'm looking for a new dimension, new life to live
(Camel by camel) Mysterious places, perfect harmony
(Camel by camel) The desert route is changing my destiny

I try not to remember, no memories
I'm looking for a new dimension, new life to live
(Camel by camel) Mysterious places, perfect harmony
(Camel by camel) The desert route is changing my destiny
