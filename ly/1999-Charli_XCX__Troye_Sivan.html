		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I just wanna go back, back to 1999
Take a ride to my old neighborhood
I just wanna go back, sing, "hit me, baby, one more time"
Wanna go back, wanna go

Yeah, I just wanna go back
Nike Airs, all that
CD, old Mercedes
Drive 'round listening to Shady like, oh
Never under pressure, oh
Those days it was so much better, oh
Feelin' cool in my youth, relaxin'
No money, no problem
It was easy back then

Ooh, wish that we could go back in time, uh
Got memories
Ooh, maybe we can do it tonight
Tonight's the night

I just wanna go back, back to 1999
Take a ride to my old neighborhood
I just wanna go back, sing, "hit me, baby, one more time"
Wanna go back, wanna go

Yeah, I remember back home
Best friends, all night, no phone
No cares, I was dumb and so young
My room singing Michael Jackson (hee, hee)
Never under pressure, oh, those days it was so much better
Feelin' cool in my youth
I'm askin', "Does anyone remember how we did it back then?"

Ooh, wish that we could go back in time, uh
Got memories
Ooh, maybe we can do it tonight
Tonight's the night
Ah, yeah

I just wanna go back, back to 1999
Take a ride to my old neighborhood
I just wanna go back, sing, "hit me, baby, one more time"
Wanna go back, wanna go

Back to where we came from, playin' air guitar on the roof
In the kitchen, up on the table
Like we had a beautiful view
I wanna go
I just wanna go back, back to 1999
Ah

Back to 1999

I know those days are over but a boy can fantasize
'Bout JTT on MTV and when I close my eyes
And I'm right there, right there
And he's right there, right there
And we're right there, right there
Ah, ah, ah, I wanna go back

I just wanna go back, back to 1999
Take a ride to my old neighborhood
I just wanna go back, sing, "hit me baby, one more time"
Wanna go back, wanna go

Back to where we came from (came from)
Playin' air guitar on the roof
In the kitchen, up on the table
Like we had a beautiful view
I wanna go
I just wanna go back, back to 1999
Go back, yeah, yeah
I just wanna go back, yeah back to 1999
Yeah, take me back to '99
