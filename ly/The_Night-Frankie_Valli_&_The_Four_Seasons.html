		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Working my way back to you, babe
With a burnin' love inside
Yeah, I'm workin' my way back to you, babe
And the happiness that died
I let it get away
Payin' every day

When you were so in love with me
I played around like I was free
Thought I could have my cake and eat it too
But how I cried over losin' you
See me cryin' now, but I ain't about to go
Livin' my life without you
For every day I made you cry
I'm payin', girl, 'til the day that I die

I keep working my way back to you, babe
With a burnin' love inside
Mmh, I'm workin' my way back to you, babe
And the happiness that died, I let it get away
Payin' every day

I used to love to make you cry
It made me feel like a man inside
But if I'd been a man in reality
You'd still be here, babe, lovin' me
Now the nights are long and lonely
And I ain't through strugglin', I just miss you so
And you're too proud you won't give in
But when I think about all I can win

I keep working my way back to you, babe
With a burnin' love inside
Mmh, I'm workin' my way back to you, babe
And the happiness that died, I let it get away
Payin' every day

Yeah, yeah yeah
Working my way back to you, babe
With a burnin' love inside
Mmh, I'm workin' my way back to you, babe
And the happiness that died, oh how I cried

Working my way back to you, babe
With a burnin' love inside
Oh, I'm workin' my way back to you, babe
