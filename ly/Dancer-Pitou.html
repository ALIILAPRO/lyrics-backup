		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I push myself into light
I need it more than ever
I need it more than ever

my heart
you're such a hard worker
you wiggle in my chest
unsure of what to follow
a servant without end
with no one to rule
keeping us covered

and unseen

as in a dream
I push myself into light
I need it more than ever
I need it more than ever

my one
you're such a hard worker
you hold all that is dear

and I want us to reverse it
I want to see you steer
I don't want to rule
I don't want cover

here is the wheel

now move me

a deer in the headlights
but dancing underneath
I see the audience's a gimmick
they're all in it with me

and as the curtains rise
I finally feel the fire
and as the curtains rise
I finally see your light

All your ways I'll follow them blindly
I push myself into light
I need it more than ever
I need it more than ever

I've always been a dancer
I've always been a dancer
