		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When others left before
I could bear to turn away
Now that it's come to this
Is there nothing left to say?
I've never known before
Such exquisite suffering
As I watched you walk away
I gave in to panicking

I can't believe that
This is really happening
Have I really lost again?
Desperation drives me insane
I will focus all the pain
Right into your heart

'Til it makes you blind
'Til the faces of your former world
Have fallen from your sight
'Til you're mine
Until the voice of doubt no longer
Dominates your mind
I'm crucified

Cold and unwhole again
Crying out and questioning
Will I ever love again?
What's the point of anything?
It takes a toll again
This is where the "fun" begins
Visions haunt me through the night
Now I'm dying for your sins

I can't believe that
If you looked me in the face
You could say there's nothing left
How the silence drives me insane
I will focus all my pain
Right into your heart

'Til it makes you blind
'Til the faces of your former world
Have fallen from your sight
'Til you're mine
Until the voice of doubt no longer
Dominates your mind
I'm crucified

I was caught up in the moment
We were alone and you seemed to harness the light
Even though I felt cold inside
When you told me it would be all right

I had given up control and
I didn't focus hard enough
To see the warning signs
I will focus all my pain
Right into your heart
Your heart is serpentine

'Til it makes you blind
'Til the faces of your former world
Have fallen from your sight
'Til you're mine (mine)
Until the voice of doubt no longer
Dominates your mind
I'm crucified
'Til it makes you blind (blind)
'Til the faces of your former world
Have fallen from your sight (I'm crucified)
'Til you're mine (mine)
Until the voice of doubt no longer
Dominates your mind
I'm crucified
