		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's a devil waiting outside your door
(How much longer?)
There's a devil waiting outside your door
And he's bucking and braying and pawing at the floor
And he's howling with pain and crawling up the walls, oh yeah
There's a devil waiting outside your door
He's weak with evil and broken by the world
He's shouting your name and he's asking for more, give him more, give him more
There's a devil waiting outside your door, oh yeah

Loverman! Since the world began
Forever, amen till end of time
Take off that dress I'm coming down, I'm your loverman
'Cause I am what I am, what I am, what I am

L is for love, baby
O is for only you that I do
V is for loving virtually all that you are
E is for loving almost everything that you do
R is for rape me and
M is for murder me and
A is for answering all of my prayers
N is for knowing your loverman's going to
Be the answer to all of yours

Loverman! Till the bitter end
While empires burn down forever and ever
And ever and ever amen, I'm your loverman
So help me, baby so help me
'Cause I am what I am, what I am what I am, what I am

I'll be your loverman!

There's a devil crawling along your floor
There's a devil crawling along your floor
With a trembling heart, he's come through the door
With his strain and sex and his jumping paw, oh yeah
There's a devil crawling along your floor
And he's old and he's stupid and
He's hungry and he's sore
And he's lame and he's blind
And he's dirty and he's poor
Give him more, give him more, give him more, give him more, give him more, give him more
There's a devil crawling along your floor, oh yeah

Loverman! Now here I stand, forever amen
'Cause I am what I am, what I am, what I am, what I am
Forgive me baby, my hands are tied
And I got no choice, no I got no choice at all

I'll say it again
L is for love and
O is for o yes I do
V is for virtue, so I ain't gonna hurt you
E is for even if you want me to
R is for render unto me, baby
M is for that which is mine and
A is for any old how, darling and
N is for any old time

I'll be your loverman! I got a master plan
To take off your dress and be your man
Seize the throne, seize the mantle
Seize the crown 'cause I am what I am, what I am, what I am, what I am
Your loverman!

There's a devil lying by your side
You might think he's asleep
But look at his eyes
He wants you, baby, to be his bride
There's a devil lying by your side, oh yeah

Oh he's a loverman!
Oh he's a loverman!
Can you comphrend
'Cause I am what I am, what I am, what I am, what I am, what I am, what I am, what I am
'Cause he's a loverman!
A real loverman!
A real loverman!
