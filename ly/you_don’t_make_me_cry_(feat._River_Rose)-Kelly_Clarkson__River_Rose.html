		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun, oh (sing)
Go-go-go, da-da-da-da-da

I don't have the time to help you unwind
All the ways you don't approve
I don't even know why my name's in your mouth
But I think I'm gettin' to the truth (think you're in it for me)
Nothin' you say is makin' sense today
So I think I'll take my cue
When I was younger and a fool, I might've fallen for it too
But I'm not, so you can go away, I ain't fallin' for

You can't quote me
I'd rather be alone than blue
Know it ain't easy, but watch me
Walk the high road without you

You don't make me cry (cry)
And I cry at everything
You don't make me feel and I feel more than most
Now that says somethin', doesn't it?
So I'm pickin' you from my garden, weeds aren't allowed in
Guess you missed that song
Feelin' free since I found out you don't have power
So you're searchin' for some

(Oh) Well, you can't have mine
(Oh) You don't make me cry

Under all the shade you throw my way
I've been thinkin' 'bout my worth
And it cost a lot more than the booze I'm sure is
Puttin' your demons first, yeah, I said it and

You can't quote me
No one tells you the truth (no one tells you the truth)
I know you can hear me up there
But high horses fall too

You don't make me cry (don't make me cry, cry)
And I cry at everything (at everything)
You don't make me feel and I feel more than most
Now that says somethin', doesn't it?
So I'm pickin' you from my garden, weeds aren't allowed in
Guess you missed that song
Feelin' free since I found out you don't have power
So you're searchin' for some

(Oh) Well, you can't have mine
(Oh) You don't make me cry
(Oh) Well, you can't have mine
(Oh) No, you don't make me cry

Every time I think you're on my side (every time you're on my side)
Gotta check my back for the dagger you're hidin'
Every little jab, all the anger inside has opened wide

No, you don't make me cry (cry)
And I cry at everything
You don't make me feel and I feel more than most
Now that says somethin', doesn't it?
So I'm pickin' you from my garden, weeds aren't allowed in
Guess you missed that song
Feelin' free since I found out you don't have power
So you're searchin' for some

(You don't make me cry, oh) Well, you can't have mine
(You don't make me cry, oh) You don't make me cry
(You don't make me cry, oh) Well, you can't have mine
(No, you don't make me cry, oh) No, you don't make me cry

The end
