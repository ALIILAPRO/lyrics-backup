		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I miss the warm embrace I felt
First time you touched me
Secure and safe in open arms
I should have known you'd crush me

A snake you were when me met
I loved you anyway
Pulling out your poisoned fangs
The venom never goes away

Serpent swims free in my blood
Dragons sleeping in my veins
Jackyl speaking with tongue
Roach egg laying in my brain
Once stalked beneath your shadow
Sleepwalking to the gallows
I'm the sun that beats your brow in
'Til I finally threw the towel in
Never knowing if I'd wake up in a whirlpool got redundant
My brain was just some driftwood in a cesspool, I became dead
From a rock star to a desk fool was my destiny, someone said
Love's a tidepool, taste the waters, life's abundant
Taste me
