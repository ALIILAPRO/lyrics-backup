		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Flame still burns, kerosene 
Rise and fall
As I breathe

All these pictures on the screen
It's almost like they're real
And I think that I'd do anything
If it meant I didn't feel
What I feel

And I feel way too much
Truth is no one gives a fuck

That's why, I don't try
That's why, I stay high
I know that you're never gonna hear me
I know that these words will go to waste
That's why, I don't try

That's why

Try my best, door's still closed
Love is dead, for all I know
Sometimes it gets so hard
I don't wanna fight
And every day that passes by
Feels like it might be my last

And I feel way too much
Truth is no one gives a fuck

That's why, I don't try
That's why, I stay high
I know that you're never gonna hear me
I know that these words will go to waste
That's why, I don't try

That's why, I don't try
That's why, I stay high

That's why, I don't try
That's why, I stay high
I know that you're never gonna hear me
I know that these words will go to waste
That's why, I don't try

That's why, I don't try
That's why, I stay high
