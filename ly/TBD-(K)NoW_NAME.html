		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Up on a creek, nothing to oar
Give it a whirl, down for the count
Breaking a leg, is just what I need

Necessity? Legitimate? Drawing the line? It doesn't matter
Step up your game, take the lead and carry out

Straight from the horse's mouth, I found it already
It is a piece of cake

Cut to the chase, I don't got time to waste
Won't let go, 'til I get what I need
Playing by ear is my specialty, didn't you know?
The hope is smoggy

Time is a thief, chasing rainbows
Will I succeed? This one I know
It's will or will not, nor can or cannot

Curtain of night fell upon us
No suffering is no miracle
Solitary action for me is cakewalk

Bite the bullet, call it a day, go back repeat
Always facing music

Cry for the moon is what you always do
You should know, no one can stop me
Come rain and shine, that is what I always do, it's true
Hook, line and sinker

Cut to the chase, I don't got time to waste
Won't let go, 'til I get what I need
Playing by ear is my specialty, didn't you know?
The hope is smoggy, yeah

What's your secret? What's your secret?
Try to keep it, I will keep it
