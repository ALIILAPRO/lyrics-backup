		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  That's what I like

We got Britt, she the fun one
Chad, he the hung one
Sage, they the shy one
Zane, the always high one
Tess is the lit one
Brett is the fit one
Oh shit, uh, I forgot one
Me, I'm the hot one

Me, I'm the hot one

That's hot

(There's a party, there's a party tonight)
There's a party downtown tonight)
(I'm dating the DJ, he said, "Bring who you like")

We got Britt, she the fun one
Chad, he the hung one
Sage, they the shy one
Zane, the always high one
Tess is the lit one
Brett is the fit one
Oh shit, uh, I forgot one, got one, got one, got one, got one
Me, I'm the hot one

Me, I'm the hot one

That's hot

That's hot
