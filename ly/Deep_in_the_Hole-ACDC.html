		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been enchained
She got shackles on me
That woman to blame
For the hell and misery
Can't find my way out of here
Shoot me down in a burnin' fear
Going down for a stretch of years
Way down below
I'm deep in, deep in 
Deep in the hole
Deep in, deep in 
Deep in the hole
I'm down in, down in 
Down in the hole
Well I'm deep in, deep in
That woman got me deep in the hole

I'm sinkin' down
She got me down on the floor
Can't touch both walls
The further down I go
Pulls the string on my riding bow
Makes me sing when she find my load
Ain't no slave you do what you're told
You sold your soul
I'm deep in, deep in 
Deep in the hole
Deep in, deep in 
Deep in the hole
I'm down in, down in 
Down in the hole
Well I'm deep in, deep in
That woman got me deep in the hole

I'm deep in, deep in 
Deep in the hole
Deep in, deep in 
Deep in the hole
I'm down in, down in 
Down in the hole
I'm deep in, deep in 
Deep in the hole
Deep in the hole, firing your load
Deep in the hole, save your soul
Deep in, deep in 
Deep in the hole
Deep in, deep in
That woman got me deep in the hole

Deep in the hole
Deep in the hole
I'm deep in the hole
