		  My dear my dear my dear 
You do not know me but I know you very well 
Now let me tell you that I ca-ca-ca-ca called you (Why you lie to me)
My dear my dear my dear 
You do not know me but I know you very well 
Now let me tell you that I caught you with and I knew it was a lie

Talk to me, tell me
Where you were (late last night?)
You told me, with your friends
Hangin' out (late last night)
You're lying 'cause you're stuttering
Now where were you (late last night?)
Stop lying to me 'cause you're ticking me off
See you're ticking me off, ooh girl

I can tell you're lying
'Cause when you're replying
You stutter, stutter, s-s-stutter, stutter
I can tell you're lying
'Cause when you're replying
You stutter, stutter, s-s-stutter, stutter
I can tell you're lying
'Cause when you're replying
You stutter, stutter, s-s-stutter, stutter
I can tell you're lying
'Cause when you're replying
You stutter, stutter, s-s-stutter, stutter

I called you on your cell phone
No answer (tell me why)
So I paged you on your two way
Still no response (tell me why)
I took care of you, I loved you
And you played me (tell me why)
Stop lying to me about where you've been
'Cause you're ticking me off, tick-tick-ticking me off

I can tell you're lying
'Cause when you're replying
You stutter, stutter, s-s-stutter, stutter
I can tell you're lying
'Cause when you're replying
You stutter, stutter, s-s-stutter, stutter
I can tell you're lying
'Cause when you're replying
You stutter, stutter, s-s-stutter, stutter
I can tell you're lying
'Cause when you're replying
You stutter, stutter, s-s-stutter, stutter

My dear my dear my dear 
You do not know me but I know you very well 
Now let me tell you that I ca-ca-ca-ca called you 
My dear my dear my dear 
You do not know me but I know you very well 
Now let me tell you that I caught you with and I knew it was a lie

Quit your lying heffer, watch yourself
Yeah, came in here with, but you're leaving out here by yourself
I'm keepin' it gangsta without the tattoos and platinum mouth
I was the rapper you heard about slappin' up in the Waffle House
Right next to niggas when I be sparkin' 'em out
And I'm way too cold for playin', let you come and dog me out
Should've of knew what you was up to when you got here
Get off my couch (get)
And I just can't change it
It's gonna be good, get out on ya route
My bad, you're out
I seen it coming when them nappy heads
You was running with, docked out wanting what you had
You let him set you up and you fell for it
Now it's "I-I-I'm sorry" my ass
That's why you're paying for it
You got the garbage, I got the trash can for it
The man ain't gon' stand for it
You better respect my flow
Don't be stuttering when you're talking to Mystikal
Or lying when you be talking to Joe

I smell cologne, damn it's strong
How'd you get it on?
(I'm not dumb)
He messed up your hair
Make-up's every where
Ooh yeah (I'm not dumb)
Girl you're crying, 'cause you're lying
To my face (I'm not dumb)
Stop lying to me about seeing a man
'Cause you're ticking me off, tick-tick-ticking me off

I can tell you're lying
'Cause when you're replying
You stutter, stutter, s-s-stutter, stutter
I can tell you're lying
'Cause when you're replying
You stutter, stutter, s-s-stutter, stutter
I can tell you're lying
'Cause when you're replying
You stutter, stutter, s-s-stutter, stutter
I can tell you're lying
'Cause when you're replying
You stutter, stutter, s-s-stutter, stutter
I can tell you're lying
'Cause when you're replying
You stutter, stutter, s-s-stutter, stutter
I can tell you're lying
'Cause when you're replying
You stutter, stutter, s-s-stutter, stutter
