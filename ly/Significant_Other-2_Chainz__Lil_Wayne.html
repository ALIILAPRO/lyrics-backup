		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bitch, this is lifestyle, gotta get my point across
Scary ass trap house, look just like a haunted house
(Boo-boo, boo-boo, boo-boo, boo-boo, mm, brr)
Shoot that bitch and have 'em runnin' out
I got a plug, we ain't runnin' out
Runnin' O's, checkin' they bank account
Pretty bitch with the designer cloth
She boostin' shit, it make you summersault
Look what I pulled up out the cookie jar
And got some game from Maurice and Bookie Ball
Real Atlanta legend, you got me fucked up
I'm a real dope boy, you got me fucked up
Now they lookin' at me like, "I think I'm stuck up"
But where was you when a nigga had me stuck up? (Where was you?)
Now I got that middle finger up, stuck up
I'm like a star in the sky, nigga, stuck up
You runnin' off of fumes, but I think I'm charged up
They see me pull up, niggas know I'm bar'd up (bar'd up)
An angel investor for a start up
I'm what you get when you drop coke into water (yeah)
They gon' try to take me across the border, I'm so dope
Asked me did I wanna sell my soul, I said, "Nope" (no)
I ain't even sold the Porsche I had eleven years ago (I ain't sold)
I been holdin' foreign rims, women and clothes (yeah)
When I leave the day party, yeah, I'm changin' clothes (change)
Ain't got no time to chase you, I'm chasin' O's
I'm tryna buy a better spot, I bought a case to go
I told her, "I'm nothin' like you thought, that was a case ago"
Or matter of fact, it was the case before
A trap nigga turned proper, I crossed over and left their ankles sore
I pop my shit, I pop an Addy, I been poppin', bro
Been popular, I'm pushin' product at the Stop-N-Go
A real legend in the streets, you got me fucked up
I'm a real dope boy, you got me fucked up
I can't let you play me off the streets
I'ma go home with my girl tonight, wake up say a prayer and eat

I want someone who's there for me (I need somebody)
Without a guarantee
How can I be there for me? Hmm
(When I need company)
Consistency (Mula)
Is all I ever needed with you
And you put me through it (30, you a motherfuckin' fool, nigga)

I need somebody
I need somebody not just anybody, that special somebody
I don't be stressin' 'bout her, shit went nice up her body
Long as they know that's for somebody, yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah)
No questions, don't question her body
She don't be finessin' her body
She got that fr, fr, yeah, tell me about it
No, matter fact text me about it
One hundred emoji, I need you to keep it a hundred emoji
Need to know nobody comin' behind me
But when we fuck, I need you cumin' before me
I need you to love me like I should love me
Sing, "How To Love", show me how to love me
And I mean that from the bottom of me
From the top floor to the lobby, lovely
I need love but I'm tired of searchin'
Clean tub, dirty shower curtains
No cap like bottle service
Need a road map to the highest person
And I'ma toe tap on the hottest service
And this hard D, probably got her thirsty
In the pussy, I don't show a lot of mercy
I'ma fuck her 'til she scream, "Lord, have mercy"
No controversy just contraceptives
Contraband for the conscious effort
Perfect strangers doing stranger things
Baby, how can I change the spot, just left it
Full time love, part time love, one time love, hard time love
In time love, love is on time love, love long time love, all time love, all my love

I want someone (yeah) who's there for me 
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah, I need somebody, I need somebody, girl)
Without a guarantee (ooh, I need somebody, girl, ooh)
How can I be there for me? Hmm (yeah, ooh, yeah)
Consistency
Is all I ever needed with you (ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh)
And you put me through it (for a part time love, yeah, yeah, I need somebody)
