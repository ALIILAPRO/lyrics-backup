		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  God I think the world is
About to collapse! C'mon
The buildings and walls are all falling
If you don't know, you should by now
It's the motherfucking Snowgoons
(Snowgoons in the building)
And you're rocking with Singapore Kane
And Slaine
Motherfucker fucking around no more
No one's fucking around c'mon
It's 2008 dummy

All eyes are staring at me
People watching the villain
They see me rising with the rebels
To the top of the building
Being stuck down at the bottom
Is the vilest feeling
Desolate soul for vodka that's swilling
Popping the pilling
Jealously swirling in their eyes
They're plotting to kill 'em
But I been there and believe me
I ain't forgotten the feeling
I lived the dark nights and heard
The paint drops from the ceiling
I mean the raindrops hang in
â€˜caine spots with dealers
Now I'm fighting a different
War, smoking less, sniffing more
Every week a different chore
Every month a different tour
I got a gang of haters everyday I
Piss 'em off a little more
What you think I got a fucking pistol for
Jealousy's a disease that affect my enemies
They're scheming while they're sipping
On the Hennessy me, I'm overseas making G's
Like I stick banks rocking mics
Sniffing foreign coke out of Swiss Francs

We bring the devastation
Never a moment of hesitation
When we smash your face and leave
Your blood pasted upon the pavement
The sons of Satan, keeping it rugged
Fuck the debating!
What you talking about? You weak! Our
Fury is full of hatred
We bring the devastation
Never a moment of hesitation
When we smash your face and leave
Your blood pasted upon the pavement
The sons of Satan, keeping it rugged
Fuck the debating!
What you talking about? You weak! Our
Fury is full of hatred

It's no benefit's trying to test
Me and my affiliates soon as you consider it
We smack dudes illiterate
Sidestep the petty shit
Forever it's a militant's mission
To get the cheese and stretch
It like mozzarella sticks
Test me, I'm ready, my girl got my machete
And she's ready to cut your
Throat like Chequeta in Belly
You was hard as a rock
Now you sweeter than jelly
No one believes the shit that
You spit on your telly
Despite how you think it looks
I never play by the books
The silent kid in the room
Is really the biggest crook
Pulling off the biggest juxx
Fill every cranny and nook
Fight to the death with guns
And knives and left hooks
Dude's talk the talk but they
Don't walk any similar
We'll separate your soul from your
Body like oil and vinegar
High off the sticky, insane when I'm sober
Spit poison in my verse like killer cobras

The style raw, kick it rugged like it's him
Who crack your face this demonic place
Catch me in hell what I create
This the rhyme squad
So my mind is gone with the wind
I'm better than half you rappers
Who faking it like pretend
'Til the end I'ma murder this
MC's keep on observing this
I hear you bite my shit and they're
Gonna find you where the murder was
I kick it ill sick twisted acapella
When I rock a fella
Rolling with dime bitches and cock inhalers
My rhyme is torture
Slowly pulling out your guts
While your whole body soaked in
Alcohol and paper cuts
Then the knife slides into your right thigh
You think you might die, you right
You see the visions of your life fly
Right past you
My clique will really bash you
Into your skull then suck your
Brains out like a vacuum
My backroom is filled with
Goons and street thugs
Killers hate love, swing at me coward
I'm pullin' straight up
We bring the devastation
Never a moment of hesitation
When we smash your face and leave
Your blood pasted upon the pavement
The sons of Satan, keeping it rugged
Fuck the debating!
What you talking about? You weak! Our
Fury is full of hatred
We bring the devastation
Never a moment of hesitation
When we smash your face and leave
Your blood pasted upon the pavement
The sons of Satan, keeping it rugged
Fuck the debating!
What you talking about? You weak! Our
Fury is full of hatred (Hatred, hatred)
