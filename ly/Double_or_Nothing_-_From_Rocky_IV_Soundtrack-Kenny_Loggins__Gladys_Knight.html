		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Double or nothing you've gotta have a partner 
Or your heart'll never come of age,
Takin' and givin' it's time we started livin' love 
Will get us through the awkward stage,
Let your heart run free,
Let it run to me yeah,
We were meant to be, darlin' stay with me.

You stepped out of the night full of lonely,
We stepped into a world full of light,
You said I was your one and your only,
We made love for a lifetime tonight.

Double or nothing you've gotta have lover or you're gonna throw your life away,
Fact is a fact is your hearts gotta practise and you've gotta use it every day,
Lay it on the line,
Oh lay it next to mine yeah,
Darlin' we'll do fine, if you're gonna stay with me, stay with me.

You stepped out of the night full of lonely,
We stepped into a world full of light,
You said I was your one and your only,
We made love for a lifetime tonight

You stepped out of the night full of lonely,
We stepped into a world full of light, (takin' and givin' tonight we started livin')
You said I was your one and your only, (no sign of dancin' it's you and me romancin')
We made love for a lifetime tonight. (double or nothing)

You stepped out of the night full of lonely, (i'll stay with you forever)
We stepped into a world full of light, (fact is a fact you need a lot of practise I know)
You said I was your one and your only, (there will never be another)
We made love for a lifetime tonight.
