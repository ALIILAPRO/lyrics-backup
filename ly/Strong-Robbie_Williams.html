		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My breath smells of a thousand fags
And when I'm drunk I dance like me dad
I've started to dress a bit like him
And early morning when I wake up
I look like Kiss but without the make up
And that's a good line to take it to the bridge

And you know and you know
'Cause my life's a mess
And I'm trying to grow 
So before I'm old, I'll confess

You think that I'm strong
You're wrong, you're wrong
I'll sing my song, my song, my song

My bed's full of takeaways 
And fantasies of easy lays
The pause button's broke on my video
And is this real 'cause I feel fake
Oprah Winfrey, Ricki Lake
Teach me things I don't need to know

And you know and you know
'Cause my life's a mess
And it's starting to show 
So before I'm old, I'll confess

You think that I'm strong 
You're wrong, you're wrong
I'll sing my song, my song, my song

If I did it all again I'd be a nun
The rain was never cold when I was young
I'm still young, we're still young
Life's too short to be afraid
Step inside the sun

And you know and you know
'Cause my life's a mess
And I'm trying to grow
Hey, hey

You think that I'm strong 
You're wrong, you're wrong
I'll sing my song, my song, my song

You think that I'm strong 
You're wrong, you're wrong
I'll sing my song, my song, my song

Life's too short to be afraid
Take a pill to numb the pain
You don't have to take the blame

Life's too short to be afraid
Take a pill to numb the pain
You don't have to take the blame

Life's too short to be afraid
Take a pill to numb the pain
You don't have to take the blame

Life's too short to be afraid
Take a pill to numb the pain
You don't have to take the blame
