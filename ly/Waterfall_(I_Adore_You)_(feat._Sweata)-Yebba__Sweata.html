		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Deep in my mind
Even my inner critic is still a mystic
You're unrefined
Raw and uncut like the prisms
Bending time to time

Mirrors break
They multiply
Fuck what they say
These feelings don't subside
Obsessions fade
Over time
But what remains
Love is whatever we make it tonight

Did they mention the pride before the fall?
'Cause I would risk it all for you
What they say 'bout the writings on the wall?
No clue, baby, I adore you
Baby, I adore you
I adore you
Baby, I adore you

Fine copper threads
They run from my head through this mattress
As it spins on its axis
You're heavy as lead
Pressing that cross on your necklace
Against my chest

Mirrors break
Just to multiply
Obsessions fade
Over time
What can I say?
These feelings won't subside
And what remains
Love is whatever we make it tonight

Did they mention the pride before the fall?
'Cause I would risk it all for you
What they say 'bout the writings on the wall?
No clue, baby, I adore you
Baby, I adore you
I adore you
Baby, I adore you
