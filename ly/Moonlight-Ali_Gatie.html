		  Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ah

I bought you things that I didn't even have the money for
If I could make you feel so rich, I don't mind feeling poor
There's something 'bout you so addictive, had me needing more
Yeah, I just wanna hold you
Baby, you the one I want

I know I've said this all before but I'll say it again
You the only one I want and girl, I can't pretend
I remember cloudy days, we cuddled in my bed
The thought of losing you just makes no sense inside my head

You the reason I believe that love is real
Ain't nobody make me feel the way you make me feel
Darling, tell me, is it real?
Or was I lying to myself just to make it feel so real?

Ain't nobody gon' love you like I love you
Ain't nobody gon' want you like I want you
Ain't nobody gon' trust you like I trust you
Ain't nobody gon', ain't nobody gon'

Ain't nobody gon' love you like I love you
Ain't nobody gon' trust you like I trust you
Ain't nobody gon' want you like I want you
Ain't nobody gon' wanna no no no

I can't love nobody anymore
You the only one that I ever want
I compare her to you, she has never won
Now I wanna just be all alone

Nobody love me like you
And I can't love nobody back
You remind me of the moon
'Cause every night you coming back

What am I supposed to do?
If I'm so in love with you
I can not get over you
I can not get over you

Since you left me, every night, I go stare at the moon
Wishing it was you and I, that's something we would do
Every Sunday morning, I go watch the flowers bloom
I do things we used to do, hoping I'll run into you

What's a lie and what's the truth
I can not get over you
Doesn't matter what I do
Everyone just looks like you

Girl, I smell you everywhere
Smell your perfume and your hair
I try to act like I don't care
Everyone knows (that I care)

You the reason I believe that love is real (love is real)
Ain't nobody make me feel, the way you make me feel
Darling, tell me is it real?
Or was I lying to myself just to make it feel so real?

Ain't nobody gon' love you like I love you
Ain't nobody gon' want you like I want you
Ain't nobody gon' trust you like I trust you
Ain't nobody gon', ain't nobody gon', no

Ain't nobody gon' love you like I love you
Ain't nobody gon' trust you like I trust you
Ain't nobody gon' want you like I want you
Ain't nobody gon', ain't nobody gon'

Trust you, like I trust you
Ain't nobody gon'
Love you like I love you
Ain't nobody gon, la, la, love you
Ain't nobody gon'
Ain't nobody gon'
