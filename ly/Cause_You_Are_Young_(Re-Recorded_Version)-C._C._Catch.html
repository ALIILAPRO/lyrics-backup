		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Heartache, heartache, heart was gold
All it had you instant cold
Lonely, lonely wasted years
You're a winner with bad souvenirs

You're a hero, you're a man
You're a winner, take my hand

'Cause you are young
You will always be so strong
Hold on tight to your dreams
Hold on (hold on)
You are right (you are right)
Don't give up (baby, baby, baby)

'Cause you are young (are young)
You are right and you are wrong (are wrong)
You are a hero, next day you're done (you're done)
So hold on to your dreams

All or nothing you can give
Live your life, love to live
Oh man, oh man, feel the night
Strong enough till the morning light

You're a hero, you're a man
You're too tough to lose this game

'Cause you are young
You will always be so strong
Hold on tight to your dreams
Hold on (hold on)
You are right (you are right)
Don't give up (baby, baby, baby)

'Cause you are young (are young)
You are right and you are wrong (are wrong)
You are a hero, next day you're done (you're done)
So hold on to your dreams

'Cause you are young
You will always be so strong
Hold on tight to your dreams
Hold on (hold on)
You are right (you are right)
Don't give up (baby, baby, baby)

'Cause you are young (are young)
You are right and you are wrong (are wrong)
You are a hero, next day you're done (you're done)
So hold on to your dreams (baby, baby, baby)
'Cause you are young

(Baby, baby, baby)
'Cause you are young (are young)
You are right and you are wrong (are wrong)
You are a hero, next day you're done (you're done)
So hold on to your dreams
