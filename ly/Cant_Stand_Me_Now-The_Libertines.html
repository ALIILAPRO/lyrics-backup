		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  An ending fitting for the start 
You twist and tore our love apart 
Your light fingers threw the dark 
That shattered the lamp and into darkness it cast us 

No, you've got it the wrong way round 
You shut me up, and blamed it on the brown 
Cornered the boy kicked out at the world 
The world kicked back a lot fuckin' harder now 

If you want to try 
If you want to try 
There's no worse you could do 
Uh oh oh 

I know you lie 
I know you lie 
I'm still in love with you 
Uh oh oh

Can't take me anywhere (I'll take you anywhere) 
You can't take me anywhere (I can't take you anywhere) 
I'll take you anywhere you want to go 

Oh, you can't stand me, no, you can't stand me 
No, you can't stand me, no, you can't stand me 
No, you can't stand me, no, you can't stand me 
No, you can't stand me, no, you can't stand me now

Have we enough to keep it together? 
Or do we just keep on pretending 
And hope our luck is never ending now
You tried to pull the wool I wasn't feeling too clever 
And you take all that they're lending
Until you need amending now

If you want to try 
If you want to try 
There's no worse you could do 
Uh oh oh 

I know you lie 
All you do is make me cry 
All these words they ain't true 

I can't take me anywhere, I can take you anywhere 
You can't take me anywhere, I will take you anywhere 
I'll take you anywhere you want to go 

Oh, you can't stand me, no, you can't stand me 
No, you can't stand me, no, you can't stand me 
No, you can't stand me, no, you can't stand me 
No, you can't stand me, no, you can't stand me

Oh, you can't stand me, no, you can't stand me 
No, you can't stand me, no, you can't stand me 
No, you can't stand me, no, you can't stand me 
No, you can't stand me, no

No oh oh
You can't stand me now
Oh oh oh
