		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  His father was a drinker and his mother cried in bed
Folding John Wayne's t-shirts when the swing set hit his head
The neighbors, they adored him 
For his humor and his conversation

Look underneath the house there 
Find the few living things, rotting fast, in their sleep 

Oh the dead
Twenty-seven people 
Even more, they were boys, with their cars, summer jobs 
Oh my God
Ooh, are you one of them?

He dressed up like a clown for them 
With his face paint white and red
And on his best behavior 
In a dark room on the bed he kissed them all

He'd kill ten thousand people 
With a slight of his hand, running far, running fast to the dead
He took off all their clothes for them
He put a cloth on their lips, quiet hands, quiet kiss on the mouth

And in my best behavior 
I am really just like him
Look beneath the floor boards 
For the secrets I have hid
