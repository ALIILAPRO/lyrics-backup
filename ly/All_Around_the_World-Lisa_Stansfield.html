		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't know where my baby is
But I'll find him, somewhere, somehow
I've got to let him know how much I care
I'll never give up looking for my baby

Been around the world and I, I, I
I can't find my baby
I don't know when, I don't know why
Why he's gone away
And I don't know where he can be, my baby
But I'm gonna find him

We had a quarrel and I let myself go
I said so many things, things he didn't know
And I was oh, oh so bad
I don't think he's comin' back, mm-mm
He gave the reason, the reasons he should go
And he said things he hadn't said before
And he was oh, oh so mad
And I don't think he's comin' back, comin' back

I did too much lyin', wasted too much time
Now I'm here a'cryin', I, I, I

Been around the world and I, I, I
I can't find my baby
I don't know when, I don't know why
Why he's gone away
And I don't know where he can be, my baby
But I'm gonna find him (ooh-ooh, ooh)

So open hearted, he never did me wrong
I was the one, the weakest one of all
And now I'm oh, oh so sad
I don't think he's comin' back, comin' back

I did too much lyin', wasted too much time
Now I'm here a'cryin', I, I, I

Been around the world and I, I, I
I can't find my baby
I don't know when, I don't know why
Why he's gone away
And I don't know where he can be, my baby
But I'm gonna find him, ooh, ooh-ooh

Been around the world and I, I, I
I can't find my baby
I don't know when, I don't know why
Why he's gone away
And I don't know where he can be, my baby
But I'm gonna find him

I'm going to find him, my b-b-baby

I did too much lyin', wasted too much time
Now I'm here a'cryin', I, I, I

Been around the world and I, I, I
I can't find my baby
I don't know when, I don't know why
Why he's gone away
And I don't know where he can be, my baby
But I'm gonna find him

I've been around the world, lookin' for my baby
Been around the world, and I'm gonna
I'm gonna find him

Been around the world and I, I, I
I can't find my baby
I don't know when, I don't know why (ooh, baby)
Why he's gone away
And I don't know where he can be, my baby
But I'm gonna find him
