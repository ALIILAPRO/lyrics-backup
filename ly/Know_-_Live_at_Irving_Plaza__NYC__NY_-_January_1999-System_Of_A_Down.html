		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Cursed Earth
Cursed Earth
Cursed Earth
Cursed Earth

I'll never feed off the evergreen luster of your heart
All because we all live in the valley of the walls
When they speak we can peak from the windows of their mouths 
To see the land the women chant as they fly up to the sun

You never think you know why
Know, you never think you know why
Know, ever think you know why
Know, know

The books, all say different things while people flap their yellow wings
Trying to soar, being a whore, life and almost everything
Sheep that ran off from the herd, may be dead, now's a bird 
Able to fly, able to die, able to fuck your mother's Earth

You never think you know why
Know, you never think you know why
Know, ever think you know why
Know

On the other side
The other side
The other side

Do you ever try to fly? 
Do you ever try to fly?
Have you ever wanted to die? 
Have you ever wanted to die?

Don't ever try to fly, don't ever try to fly
Don't ever try to fly, unless you leave your body on the other side
Never try to die, did you ever try to die?

Know, you never think you know why
Know, you never think you know why
Know, you never think you know why
Know, ever think you know why
Know
