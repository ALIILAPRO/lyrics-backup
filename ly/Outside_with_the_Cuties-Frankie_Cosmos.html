		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Outside with the cuties 

I don't think the woods are too deep 

the grass covers the sand 

all the wood is damp 

Feeling very touched 

cause my friends are in love 

Feeling pretty far from home 

so I sit to write this down 

I guess it's not really brave 

I know I'm not a lake 

I haven't written this part yet 

will you help me write it? 

you are bug bites on vacation, 

you find the sad in everything 

can't see you cry, you're down the street 

I wonder when you'll talk to me 

your eyes reflect the greenish moon 

you move towards me and I love you 

I love you 

I love you 

I haven't finished this song yet 

will you help me fix it?
