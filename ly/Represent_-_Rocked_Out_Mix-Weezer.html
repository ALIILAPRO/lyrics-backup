		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm sick and tired of everybody tryna tell me what to do
If I'm in need of your advice then surely I would come to you
I didn't get in this position just by having a stance
I work my bones beyond my limit just to have half a chance

It matters how you play the game
It matters that you can take the pain
You don't wanna lie, steal or cheat your way to the top, ohh
It matters what your people think
You represent your family
But that's just one more reason to see 
That it matters whether you win or lose

Why don't we see who is the wizard and play some one on one?
I think you'll find me sympathetic to ya, when I've won
It seems you've got the throne to beat me as if it's all I takes
But I've got skills to pay the bills and punish each of your mistakes

You know
It matters how you play the game
It matters that you can take the pain
You don't wanna lie, steal or cheat your way to the top, ohh
It matters what your people think
You represent your family
But that's just one more reason to see 
That it matters whether you win or lose

One hundred years from now
Gonna look back on this day
Where you goin' to be?
And what are they goin' to say?
I see my name in lights
The people call my name
It's all up to you
Will you find your way?

It matters how you play the game
It matters that you can take the pain
You don't wanna lie, steal or cheat your way to the top ohh
It matters what your people think
You represent your family
But that's just one more reason to see that it matters 
Whether you win or lose

It matters what your mother thinks
You represent your family
But that's just one more reason to see that it matters 
Whether you win or lose

1, 2, 3, USA!
