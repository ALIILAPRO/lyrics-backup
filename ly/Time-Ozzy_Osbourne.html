		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The time has come for you
To make up your own mind (mind)
Stop looking for the answers
That you'll never find

Save all your tears for when you
Really need to cry
Don't wish your life away
Just spread your wings and fly

Time waits for no one
It's never what it seems
Stop waiting for tomorrow
Stop living in your dreams

This life fading away
This life ticking like a time bomb
Ready to blow your tortured mind
I know it's wasting away
We don't plan for when it goes wrong
The time that we lose
We will never find time

Can't hide the clock
When every line shows on your face (face)
So take it slow
You'll never win the human race

Time waits for no one yeah
Everything must change
Stop running to the future
Start living for today

This life fading away
This life ticking like a time bomb
Ready to blow your tortured mind
I know it's wasting away
We don't plan for when it goes wrong
The time that we lose
We will never find time

Just live every moment of each day
Cause death is the price we all must pay

This life fading away
This life ticking like a time bomb
Ready to blow your tortured mind
I know it's wasting away
We don't plan for when it goes wrong
The time that we lose
We will never find time

This life fading away
This life ticking like a time bomb
Ready to blow your tortured mind
I know it's wasting away
We don't plan for when it goes wrong
The time that we lose
We will never find time
