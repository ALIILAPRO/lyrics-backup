		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Slow motion
Waking up beside you an ocean of firsts we have to share
And I'm dreaming of you while you're next to me
I'm seeing you everywhere

Fast forward
Break down every wall with your armor
Make it look so easy, annoying
But I kinda like it deep down down down

Down down down

It's how I feel around you
My head is on my body, but I don't feel it
It's getting hard to doubt you
Just like my mama said you shouldn't second guess

It's how I feel around you
My head is on my body, but I don't feel it
It's getting hard to doubt you
Just like my mama said you shouldn't second guess
I'm feeling this

Slow motion
Waking up beside you an ocean
Like swimming in the air
Collecting all these mental pictures
I'm seeing you everywhere

Fast forward
Break down every wall with your armor
Make it look so easy, annoying
But I kinda like it deep down down down

Down down down

It's how I feel around you
My head is on my body, but I don't feel it
It's getting hard to doubt you
Just like my mama said you shouldn't second guess

It's how I feel around you
My head is on my body, but I don't feel it
It's getting hard to doubt you
Just like my mama said you shouldn't second guess
I'm feeling this

It's getting hard to doubt you
Hard to doubt you
Hard to doubt you
Hard to doubt you

It's how I feel around you
Feel around you
Feel around you
Feel around

It's getting hard to doubt you
Hard to doubt you
Hard to doubt you
Hard to doubt you

It's how I feel around you
Feel around you
Feel around you
Feel around you
