		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I cannot remember anything you say
When the streets are talking, yeah, they call my name
And I walk a little further, I could go all day
And the trees are reaching, pointing out the way

I got all muddled up and journeyed to the edge of town
And then the road cracked open, sucked me in and I went down
Now standing face to face with the king of the underground
Some things just don't add up, I'm upside down, I'm inside out

I came a little closer to the truth that day
I heard its call in the alleyway
And the one resounding answer that I could take
Is that I don't know nothing and I got no way

I got all muddled up and journeyed to the edge of town
And then the road cracked open, sucked me in, and I went down
Now standing face to face with the king of the underground
Some things just don't add up, I'm upside down, I'm inside out

I got all muddled up and journeyed to the edge of town
And then the road cracked open, sucked me in, and I went down
Now standing face to face with the king of the underground
Some things just don't add up, I'm upside down, I'm inside out

Hey, guy, have you got something on your mind?
Tick, tock, can I take it for a while?
Hey, guy, have you got something on your mind?
Tick, tock, could I take it for a while?
Hey guys, I got something on my mind
Tick, tock, could you take it for a while?
Hey guys, I got something on my mind
Tick, tock, can I take it for a while?
Hey guys, I got something on my mind
Tick, tock, could you take it for a while?
Hey guys, I got something on my mind
Tick, tock

And I got something on my mind
And I got something on my mind
And I got something on my mind
And I got something on my mind
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
