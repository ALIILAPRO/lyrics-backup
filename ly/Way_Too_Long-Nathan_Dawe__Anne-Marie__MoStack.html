		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey yo, yo
It's Stack Rack
Nathan Dawe
Anne-Marie

Really wanna call you, yeah, yeah
But if I called you up, would that be wrong?
It's funny how I love you, yeah, yeah
Then suddenly you're nothing but a song

Summer in the back of your car
Singin', drink in the dark
I've been reminiscing 'bout our love
I can't help but think about you
And the way that it was
I wish I could let go of us

It's been way too long
Ooh-woah, oh, oh, it's been way too long
Ooh-woah, oh, oh, ooh, ooh-woah, oh, oh
It's been way too long
Ooh-woah, oh, oh, it's been way too long
Been way too long, long (hey, yo, yo)
Since you've been gone (Stacka)

It's been way too long, come see me, please
She said it's way too long, she can't handle me
I know you're a good girl, be bad for me (bad)
My money pretty like Anne-Marie (pretty man)
Don't want one wife, tryna marry three (woo)
Forget quality, I want quantity (more)
If you dump me you gon' don't bother me (don't)
Forget sorry, no qualities
Ah, I like your style, could you whine for me?
Yeah, do that same dance as Cardi B (Bardi)
I can't lie, man, I need your girl
Nah, I'm jokin', I need Adele
Or even Mabel's good for me
Just fun, no label, that's good for me
You's the chick I need, hmm
It's Jade from Little Mix for me
What you sayin' B? (It's been way too long)

Ooh-woah, oh, oh, it's been way too long
Ooh-woah, oh, oh, ooh, ooh-woah, oh, oh
It's been way too long
Ooh-woah, oh, oh, it's been way too long (ooh, ooh-ooh)
Been way too long, long
Since you've been gone

Summer in the back of your car
Singin', Drake in the dark
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, its been too long
I can't help but think about you and the way that it was
Baby, I should let go of us
Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh

It's been way too long
Ooh-woah, oh, oh, it's been way too long (it's been way too long)
Ooh-woah, oh, oh, ooh, ooh-woah, oh, oh
It's been way too long
Ooh-woah, oh, oh, it's been way too long
Been way too long, long
Since you've been gone
Ooh-woah, oh, oh, it's been way too long (it's been way too long)
Ooh-woah, oh, oh, ooh, ooh-woah, oh, oh
It's been way too long
Ooh-woah, oh, oh, it's been way too long
It's been way too long
Been way too long, long
Since you've been gone (it's been way too long)
