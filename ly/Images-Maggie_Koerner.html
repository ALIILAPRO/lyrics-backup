		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There you sat getting drunk on my 29th birthday, images
I'd rather listen to the train track screeching in my left ear, images

You say, you you you you will say
You say, you you you you will say
You say that you needed love

No, love's in your moleskin open hoping to know you, each layer written in vain

Oh love's always with you waiting pacing to tend to your every little want or need 

Oh loves all around you, cut through, ready to show you what you don't give so easy  

No, your love's a gypsy heart choice with a side of regret with your broken record on repeat


You say you you you will say
You say, you you you you will say
You say that you needed space

But space ain't the reason you complain every season that you do not feel free
this gypsy heart choice with a side of Russian roulette is your broken record on repeat

Did you forget your moral compass on that road
sure doesn't seem like you forgot a single robe 
you ain't the queen of anything original 
No no no you needed glory missing the point of the story of what this is all about 
No this ain't the way you treat the ones that love you the most so you're done girl take a bow, take a bow

You say, you you you will say
You say, you you you you will say
You say that you needed time

But time ain't rewinding and it ain't always been kind in the ones who will not see
this gypsy heart choice with a side of Russian roulette is your broken record on repeat

Go ahead, go a way

It's broken broken, it's broken broken open
This gypsy in my, in my, in my, in my mind 
yea, yeah make it simple
