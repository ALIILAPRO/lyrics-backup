		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And I had a dream that some day
I would just fly, fly away
And I always knew I couldn't stay
So I had a dream that I'd just fly away

I've been on my own for a minute 
Is it only me out here?
Searchin' for the place to begin it
Is it me? Is it you? Is it fear?
Standin' on the line I was given
People stare and ask me why I'm here
No one seems to think that I fit in
But I don't wanna be like them

No, 'cause I don't wanna be like them
'Cause I know that I, know that I

I had a dream that some day
I would just fly, fly away
And I always knew I couldn't stay
So I had a dream that I'd just fly away, away
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, I'd fly away

No one knew how low I was feeling
I was scared to reach for it all
Knowin' I was here for a reason
But I was scared that if I tried, I'd fall
So where do I go now that I'm in it?
I never thought it'd be like this
Dreamed it all my life and I did it
Thought the grass was greener than it is

'Cause I had a dream that some day
I would just fly, fly away
And I always knew I couldn't stay
So I had a dream that I'd just fly away, away
Oh, oh (fly, fly)
Oh, oh, I'd fly away
Whoa, whoa, whoa (fly, fly)
Oh, I'd fly away

'Cause I had a dream that some day
I would just fly, fly away
And I always knew I couldn't stay
So I had a dream that I'd just fly away, away
Oh, oh (fly, fly away)
Whoa (fly, fly away)
Whoa (fly, fly away), whoa
Whoa, I'd fly away

(Mmh, mmh)
(Mmh, mmh)
