		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm having thoughts all the time, you and I, and they won't go away
But I kinda like what it's like in my mind and I don't wanna be saved
Every night, I'm undressed, and with him and I'm thinking of you
Yeah, I know it's the wrong thing to do, but I kinda want to

Say your name while our tongues are tied
Getting shivers all down my spine
We're in bed, we're in bed, yeah, in my mind

Don't say it's unholy
If I let you come hold me
I know it's wrong that I want to be here in your arms
But tonight I'm so lonely
Don't say it's unholy
If I let you come hold me
I know it's wrong that I want to be here in your arms
Oh, come on and show me
Don't say it's unholy
Unholy
Unholy
Oh, come on and show me

If he knew what I thought about you, it would break his heart
And I wish that I could, but I can't make the fantasies stop
Everybody's downstairs, I can hear them talking through the floor
So convenient for you to pull me into a room and lock the door

Say you want me and don't be nice
Send those shivers running down my spine
We're in bed, we're in bed, yeah, in my mind

Don't say it's unholy
If I let you come hold me
I know it's wrong that I want to be here in your arms
But tonight I'm so lonely
Don't say it's unholy
If I let you come hold me
I know it's wrong that I want to be here in your arms
Oh, come on and show me
Don't say it's unholy
Unholy
Unholy
Oh, come on and show me

Oh, now we're face to face
Oh, and my heart is racing
Oh, I can taste temptation
(I know that you like it, you don't even have to hide it)
Oh, now we're face to face
Oh, and my heart keeps racing
Oh, I can taste temptation
(I know that you like it)

Don't say it's unholy
If I let you come hold me
I know it's wrong that I want to be here in your arms
But tonight I'm so lonely
Don't say it's unholy
If I let you come hold me
I know it's wrong that I want to be here in your arms
Oh, come on and show me
Don't say it's unholy
Unholy
Unholy
Oh, come on and show me
Don't say it's unholy
Unholy
Unholy
Oh, come on and show me
