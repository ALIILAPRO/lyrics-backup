		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Any day, any hour, not feeling fine
The weight of the world must have read my mind
I can't find the thread and I cannot glide
I need a tow up to clear blue sky
Out of thin air there's an inner smile
Reminds me to search for a secret dial
It's always in reach, hiding in plain sight
I always forget, but it's always right

So much love in the air
So much love, it's always there
How much love trapped inside
So much love, show it some light

The world is all flavors all the time
The dark ages had the same sunny skies
In the summer of love, we were at war
We have all these feelings, don't know what for
It's not easy to choose but it can be done
You're never alone, not the only one
I'm just trying to be good and be less fake
But not beat myself up when I make mistakes

So much love I can feel
So much love, it must be real
How much love, I can't say
Just know I need to get out of its way
So much love for your friends
When you feel off, think of them
So much love in your dreams
So much love in the days in between
Feel that love, it must be true
So much love, it's what we do

Any day, any hour, not feeling fine
The weight of the world must have read my mind

So much love in the air
So much love, it's always there
How much love, I can't say
Just know I need to get out of its way

I'll fight to stay open
I'll fight to stay wild
I'll seek better nature
I'll find it like a child
How much love do you need?
If you look hard, it's in all you see
How much love do you want?
It won't let you down
It's never gone

So much love I can feel
So much love, it must be real
How much love trapped inside
So much love, show it some light
