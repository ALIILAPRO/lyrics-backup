		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We all started the beginning
Unsure of who we'll become
And try to find a place to belong
One day, you'll make it to your place in the sun
Sometimes you feel like you're alone
That's when you learn to find your strength
Every story needs a hero, every hero needs a friend
But sometimes even heroes have to wait

You gotta learn to fall before you fly
You gotta leave the ground before you touch the sky
Your dreams are meant for chasin' far and wide
That's when you find your way, that's learning to fly

You gotta learn to fall before you fly
You gotta leave the ground before you touch the sky
Your dreams are meant for chasin' far and wide
That's when you find your way, that's learning to fly
When you find your way, that's learning to fly
That's learning to fly
