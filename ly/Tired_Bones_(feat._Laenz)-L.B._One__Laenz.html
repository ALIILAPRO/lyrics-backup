		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby we don't see eye to eye
Lately we're running from the night
Frozen in this sleepless dream
Stealing from love's constancy
Soon one of us will leave

Sacred motions dying devotion
c dance of tired bones

I look at you you look at me 
We both know what this means
Eyes to the ground mouth turned around
We're both lost in repeat
Falling in a sudden trance
Trapped inside a fated dance 

Rolling deep into the waves
Crawling away from what we crave
Fixating over sickened lust
Feeding on decaying trust
Savage indigo remains

I look at you you look at me 
We both know what this means
Eyes to the ground mouth turned around
We're both lost in repeat
Falling in a sudden trance
Trapped inside a fated dance
