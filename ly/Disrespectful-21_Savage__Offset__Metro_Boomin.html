		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm a gangbanging, chain swanging, chopper toned zone six nigga (Hey)
Pyrex whipper (Pyrex)
Louis V slippers, Saint Laurent pistol (ey)
Gucci on my tip (Guwop), nut right on her nipple (bah)
Young nigga with them M's (young nigga), I get disrespectful (hey)
Treat y'all all the same (yah), none of y'all bitches ain't special (nah)
Keep your mouth closed, little bitch I might bless you (shh, shh, shh)

If Young Metro don't trust you I'm gon' shoot you (you dig)

Bentayga with the backseat table (yah yah)
Ain't no limit on the debit, I got paper (yah yah)
Don't be calling me a brother, you a hater
Got new stones on my neck, nigga flooded out
Hurricane Irma on my neck, nigga, flooded out
Hurricane Harvey on my wrist, shit, flooded out
Nigga flooded out, VVS' flooded out
Hit the booty club, nigga, and we flooded out
Take a project bitch, and get her flooded out
You can build a bear, fuck it, I'm finna build a thot
Yeah, ice on a nigga nice, lights out
Nigga bad, back on, finna put a pipe out
Got that fire with the dig, nigga, right now
Ass was flat in middle school, but it's right now
I was robbing but I'm fucking with the mic now
I done growed up, nigga, I done sold dust, nigga
Carbon 1 5 turn ya to a cold cut, nigga
Say you wanna pint, I'm flexing with the Robituss, nigga
Put a bomb in my package, they done blowed up, nigga

I'm a north side nigga
I don't switch sides, nigga (nah)
Got that .45, nigga (bam)
I'm a certified nigga (Hey)
Had the skeleton, forty-one (skelly)
That's a big size difference
Reach a milli, yeah, one-on-one
That was a wise investment
We always going private (private)
Always getting a profit (Bag)
Look at this glass I'm cracking
Told her go down, get sloppy (Ooh)
Big on big, don't size it
Birds that sing like the Isleys (brr)
I had to find some privacy
I filed 'em up like diamonds (brr Brr)
Check out my record (yeah)
10k for the chrome hearts buckle (yeah yeah)
I got a dent on my bezel (yeah)
I'm drinking codeine for breakfast (hoo Hoo)
I get you whacked, I don't even call
I don't even text (I get you whacked)
You know I'ma dog
You know I'ma handle it when I got pressure (hrrr)
I'm fucking your broad, I tell her to shut up, I give her no extras (smash)
No trespassing
The mansion is gated, you not on the guest list (No)
I don't do beef with a peasant
They too quick to tell it (tell it, 12)
Fuck all them niggas they jealous
Fuck it we bigger than Elvis

Gucci on my tip (Guwop), nut right on her nipple (bah)
Young nigga with them M's (young nigga), I get disrespectful (hey)
Treat y'all all the same (yah), none of y'all bitches ain't special (nah)
Keep your mouth closed, little bitch I might bless you (shh, shh, shh)
Gucci on my tip (Guwop), nut right on her nipple (bah)
Young nigga with them M's (young nigga), I get disrespectful (hey)
Treat y'all all the same (yah), none of y'all bitches ain't special (nah)
Keep your mouth closed, little bitch I might bless you (shh, shh, shh)
