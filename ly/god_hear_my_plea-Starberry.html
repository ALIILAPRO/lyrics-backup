		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  god hear my plea as i will cry for you.
hold my head up and i will try to do
what makes me stay alive.
i want to live tonight.
help me let go or i will die a fool.

i waste away,
a jagged mood stabbed into your day.
always alone,
sing to the stars so theyll guide you home.
When will it end,
this hopeful heart bleeding my head.

God please help me and reach into my soul.
Wipe away all the muck and foolish dreams.
the pain creeps in at night,
another feel to fight.
how many wounds endured are due to me?

i waste away,
a jagged mood stabbed into your day.
always alone,
sing to the stars so theyll guide you home.
When will it end,
this hopeful heart bleeding my head.
