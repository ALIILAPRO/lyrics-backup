		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You can deeply hold your
breath for loneliness
For the perfect smile I smell
your ego on the way
It's long since I saw the snow
You've been told before
All this things have gone
You told me, so many mental
heavy days
Do the right thing but always
wrong eventually
In his arm for dreaming on
But we're not the same
Anymore...
Give me your hand I really
need your help
It's not a game
What are you saying?
Trembling in the dark
It's time to find the answer
A life for counter by the storm
The waves are all of the world
Have you tried to face
your days that you can learn

Ego... Ego...
Give me your hand I feel pain
so much
It's not a game
What are you saying?
Walking in the dark
It's time to find the answer
A life for counter by the storm
The waves are all of the world
Have you tried to face
your days that you can learn

You can deeply hold your
breath for loneliness
For the perfect smile I smell
your ego on the way
It's long since I saw the snow
I've been read before
At the end of lines
