		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She don't get it, he just let it slip away
'Cause all they've been doing is loosing it night and day
Breaking up is harder when you have a higher price to pay
Now she takes a lover so that she can hide the pain

Do you ever forget my name?
Do you ever recall our love again?
Do you find every now and then?
You'll be somewhere and your life is not the same

When your there with him, I'm just wondering
Do you ever forget my name?

All these changes, he now faces reality
One-night lovers, such a big space to fill
But now and then he wonders if it's only time they kill

Do you ever forget my name?
Do you ever recall our love again?
Do you find that every now and then?
You'll be somewhere and your life is not the same

It's gonna take some time, yeah
We got to know that what we did is real
Run away, this time going to pick my life again
Sowing what we reap is real
We're here
It's real

I took your heart, you took my care
And now you talk like I'm not here
I wish you well, once and for all
I just hope he's there to catch you if you fall

Ooh, that's all, just like always

Do you ever forget my name?

Do you ever forget my name?
Do you ever forget my name?

In the middle of the masquerade, there's a clown to see
Everybody's laughing
Wears his frown upside down so he can save the tears
For when he cries himself to sleep
