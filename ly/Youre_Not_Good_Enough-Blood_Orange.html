		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Deep in the play
I see you as you're looking over
Friends in my way
You never could've been a good lover
Watch what you say
Could never mean a word and still hurt you
Look the other way
Please tell me that I'm wrong
So wrong

I never was in love
You know that you were never good enough
Fall asleep right next to me
You know that you were never good enough

Forty-nine days
Surely I should be feelin' whole lot better
Ways and ways
You keep on coming back
I keep letting you in

I never was in love
You know that you were never good enough
Fall asleep right next to me
You know that you were never good enough

I never was in love
You know that you were never good enough
Fall asleep right next to me
You know that you were never good enough

I never was in love
You know that you were never good enough
Fall asleep right next to me
You know that you were never good enough

I never was in love
You know that you were never good enough
Fall asleep right next to me
You know that you were never good enough
