		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm calling to tell you it's over
Yes, darling, you're now free to go
You're saying you're sorry you hurt me
But you hurt me much more than you know

You're asking me where this call comes from
Oh, I hope that you won't end up here
If your new romance turns out a failure
Here's where to find me, my dear

I'm just on the blue side of lonesome
Right next to the Heartbreak Hotel
In a tavern that's known as Three Teardrops
On a barstool, not doin' so well

The hands on the clock never alter
For things never change in this place
There's no present, no past, no future
We're the ones who have lost in love's race

I'm just on the blue side of lonesome
Right next to the Heartbreak Hotel
In a tavern that's known as Three Teardrops
On a barstool, not doin' so well
