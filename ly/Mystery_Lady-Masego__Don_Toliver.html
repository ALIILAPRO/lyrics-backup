		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Thinkin' I could make this many songs 'bout a lady 
When I haven't met her
But she on me heavy, on my cerebellum
If I say I love her, am I wrong?
Am I crazy? Am I over zealous?
But I know the feelin', and I'm never wrong
Swear that I've been gifted with a song and a medley
It's intoxicatin', it weigh on you heavy like the alcohol
We can do like anythin' you want, I'm amazin'
Letter to my lady
I just wanna please ya, check my catalogue

In this life I come across fans and hoes 
And I like to give my fans a rose
Curse of the talented everywhere I go
They wanna change clothes and pose
But my wife be in my dreams, bruh
No, I couldn't see her
I saw her silhouette
I know I can make her wet
But when I wake up alone
I just break out my phone

Thinkin' I could make this many songs 'bout a lady 
When I haven't met her
But she on me heavy, on my cerebellum
If I say I love her, am I wrong?
Am I crazy? Am I over zealous?
But I know the feelin', and I'm never wrong
Swear that I've been gifted with a song and a medley
It's intoxicatin' it weigh on you heavy like the alcohol
We can do like anythin' you want, I'm amazin'
Letter to my lady
I just wanna please ya, check my catalogue

Thinkin' I could make this many songs about
A lady, she be havin' me up, down (ooh)
I be in my feelings, sometimes I be jealous
But I keep it thuggin' like it's Makavelli
Ring, ring, hit my celly (ring, ring)
Remember you went bad on me, I won't forget it (ring, ring)
You say you wanna tell on me, now, won't you tell it? (Yeah)
In between the sheets you know I got you yellin' (yellin')

Thinkin' I could make this many songs 'bout a lady 
When I haven't met her
But she on me heavy on my cerebellum
If I say I love her, am I wrong?
Am I crazy? Am I over zealous?
But I know the feelin', and I'm never wrong
Swear that I've been gifted with a song and a medley
It's intoxicatin', it weigh on you heavy like the alcohol
We can do like anythin' you want, I'm amazin'
Letter to my lady
I just wanna please ya, check my catalogue

Could it be monogamy ain't meant for me? (Nah)
That's way too reckless (yeah)
I'd get too jealous
Could she be, from the east or overseas? (Ha)
I learned my lesson, I'm way too Western 
Could she be, my favorite ethnicity? (Ha)
I'm just I'm undressin' all of these sections of my thoughts (yeah)
Thinkin', thinkin', thinkin', thinkin', thinkin' too hard
Thinkin' too hard, ha
But I really wanna know

Thinkin' I could make this many songs 'bout a lady 
When I haven't met her
But she on me heavy on my cerebellum
If I say I love her, am I wrong?
Am I crazy? Am I over zealous?
But I know the feelin', and I'm never wrong
Swear that I've been gifted with a song and a medley
It's intoxicatin' it weigh on you heavy like the alcohol
We can do like anythin' you want, I'm amazin'
Letter to my lady
I just wanna please ya, check my catalogue
