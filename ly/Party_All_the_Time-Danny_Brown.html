		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh
Yeah
Uh
Yeah
Uh 

Always wanna go
Always tell her, "Yes" 
Never tell her "No"
Know you think you know everything
But you don't
Wanna do the right thing
But you probably won't
So you chase the night life
Blinded by the lights
Bottom of the empty glass
Where you find life
Always left behind
Because she think she right
Thinking that she grown 
But always need your advice
And always in a situation 
That she need your help
But wouldn't help another
Only care about herself
In your VIP
Asking, "Where the drink at?"
Calling her a groupie
You'd think she'd really think that?
She just wanna hear that 
That ass look right
What you doing after this? 
Fuck tomorrow night
Wanna snort some blow? 
Pop a lot of pills?
Fucking when the sun come up
She don't feel

She wanna party all the time
Party all the time
She wanna party all the time
She wanna party all the time
Party all the time
She wanna party all the time

She wanna party all the time
Party all the time
She wanna party all the time
She wanna party all the time
Party all the time
She wanna party all the time

Skip semester, classes have passed
Say she going back, but she ain't going back
Cause time ain't waiting for a future on hold
At glass tables, on her knees, sniffing coke
Tell her get a hold, grip on life
Rather fill her cup up, liquor with no ice
Twice had an abortion, young, dumb, misfortune
Rate that she going, she might be whorin'
Signs she ignoring, but doesn't recognize
Blind to what's occurring, what's going in your mind?
Seven days a week, same shit every morning
Calling her a cab from different niggas' apartments
Wanting her to change, but she won't, dog
Just another number in her fucking call log
Lost in the fog, head in the smoke
Laughing at the world 'cause her life is a joke

She wanna party all the time
Party all the time
She wanna party all the time
She wanna party all the time
Party all the time
She wanna party all the time

She wanna party all the time
Party all the time
She wanna party all the time
She wanna party all the time
Party all the time (party all the time)
She wanna party all the time (she wanna party all the time)
