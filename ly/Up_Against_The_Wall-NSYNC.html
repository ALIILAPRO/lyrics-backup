		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was just doing my thing hanging out at the spot
You know the place we go The music's John blaze hot
and everybody was feeling the DJ
The smoke cleared and I saw a beautiful lady
The lights were low and the disco ball came down
She walked up to me slow and you know what happens now
The girl was fine, and she knew she had game
What more do I have to say

[Chorus]
She took my hand and never said a word at all
she starting grinding shorty had me up against the wall 
I see you bouncing now you know that I don't care at all 
she took me hand now she had me up against the wall
We don't, we don't care at all

It's almost two o'clock, it's time to make my move 
The after-hour spot is where I'm going to
'cause I gotta have some more, looking for 
Somebody to hit the dance floor
And lucky for me I see a fine young lady's eying me
The lights are low, and her friends are all around
She walked up to me slow and you know what happens now
She turned around, and she worked it the worst way
What more do I have to say

[Chorus: x3]

You know we don't care at all now let, let me see ya up, up against the wall
