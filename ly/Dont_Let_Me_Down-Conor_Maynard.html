		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Crashing, hit a wall
Right now I need a miracle
Hurry up now, I need a miracle
Stranded, reaching out
I call your name but you're not around
I call your name but you're not around

I need ya, I need ya, I need you right now
Yeah, I need you right now
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
I think I'm losing my mind now
It's in my head, darling, I hope
That you'll be here, when I need you the most, so
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
Don't let me down (ooh yeah)

No, don't let me, don't let me, don't let me
No, don't let me, no oh oh, yeah yeah yeah
Come darling, I hope
That you'll be here, when I need you the most, so
Don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down

Running out of time
I really thought you were on my side
But now there's nobody on my side, no

I need ya, I need ya, I need you right now
Yeah, I need you right now
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
I think I'm losing my mind now
It's in my head, darling, I hope
That you'll be here, when I need you the most, so
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
Don't let me down, yeah, yeah, yeah (ooh yeah)

No, don't let me, don't let me, don't let me
No, don't let me, no oh oh, yeah yeah yeah
Don't let me down, don't let me down, don't let me down, no no no no
Don't let me, don't let me, don't let me
Don't let me, don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
