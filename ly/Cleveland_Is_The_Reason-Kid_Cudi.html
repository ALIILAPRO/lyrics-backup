		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Light one up (uh)
Headbanger
Uh
(Dot Da Genius)
Yup
(Midwest Action) yup
Look at me, Lee (I got it)
Come look at me, Lee, I'm a star (Takeover)
These people love me, man (I got it)
These people love me
Mcfly-high

I come from Cleveland
Y'all can really hear it now
Hit 'em like comic books, kaboom pow-pow
Into a girl's mind, spit fine, no wine dine
I keep two phones, sidekick for bad dimes
And the topic in question is why I'm so chill
Girls don't understand, he ain't even made a mil'
And say I'm complexed just like the magazine
I wear my closet complex like the magazine
I get in their head (uh-huh, I do)
They don't even see my bread (uh-huh, oh no)
Oh so, oh so fly (wow)
Cool as I wanna be, one hell of a guy
I keep 'em short and sweet, thick and petite
Ridin' alongside in my Cutlass Supreme
I'm from a place where Old Schools are common (yup, yup)
Gotta explain every time I'm rhymin' I be (I be)

I be all day rollin' in my whip (uh)
Got my sippin' cup out on the low (uh-huh, ayy)
I keep two pretty women by my side 
I'm cooler than a polar bear's toes and I say

Cleveland is that (oh), Cleveland is the (oh)
Cleveland is the reason I'm cool
Cleveland is that (oh), Cleveland is the (oh)
Cleveland is the reason I'm leanin'
Cleveland is that (oh), Cleveland is the (oh)
Cleveland is the reason I'm cool
Cleveland is that (oh), Cleveland is the (oh)
Cleveland is my, my city, my city (wow, oh)

Yup, yuppers, smile all the time while
I chop it up like Michael Watt's slow talk style
So the girlies can really catch all my accent
And the double O got her own accent
Some niggas sell drugs to provide for they fam
Some niggas sell CD's up out they trunk, man
Some niggas they go to school for that higher learnin'
I play the O'Jays while I'm turnin' lanes
We be on our shit (uh-huh)
Freakin' Black & Milds, still controllin' the whip (oh, just chillin')
Ain't no city like Cleveland (no)
Cruisin' wit my bad bitch in the evenin'
You wanna know exactly why I'm this way
Take a trip to the land, swing this way
After the song done, ain't much I can say (yup, yup)
Cleveland is my city, city (I be, oh)

I be all day rollin' in my whip (uh)
Got my sippin' cup out on the low (uh-huh, ayy)
I keep two pretty women by my side 
I'm cooler than a polar bear's toes and I say

Cleveland is that (oh), Cleveland is the (oh)
Cleveland is the reason I'm cool
Cleveland is that (oh), Cleveland is the (oh)
Cleveland is the reason I'm leanin'
Cleveland is that (oh), Cleveland is the (oh)
Cleveland is the reason I'm cool
Cleveland is that (oh), Cleveland is the (oh)
Cleveland is my, my city, my city (oh)
