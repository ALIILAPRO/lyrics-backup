		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'll give you everything

You look all perfect in my eyes
I love everything you are
That sparkle in your eyes
When you take a look at me
I'm taken with you baby
I cannot resist
Giving you all of me
I wanna give everything

All my love is yours
I wanna give you all of me
All my love is yours
I wanna give you all of me
All my love is yours
I wanna give you all of me
All my love is yours

I'll hold it down for you baby
Whenever you should need me
I have no other need
But to express thе way I feel
I love all your pain
All your sadness
And your fears away
My lovе will hold you
Keep you and will take you higher

All my love is yours
I'll give you everything
All my love is yours
I'll give you everything
All my love is yours
All my love is yours
All my love is yours

I can't explain the way I feel inside
This feeling makes me feel complete
In the deepest part of me fire burns within
All I wanna do is to express the way I feel
Like I'm done loving, loving me
Could I share this love with you

I wanna spend all my days with you
I wanna spend all my days with you

All my love is yours
I'll give you everything
All my love is yours
All my love is yours
All my love is yours

I can't explain the way I feel inside
This feeling makes me feel complete
In the deepest part of me fire burns within
All I wanna do is to express the way I feel
All this loving need, baby its all for you

All I wanna do is give you all of me

All my love is yours
All my love is yours
All my love is yours
All my love is yours
All my love is yours
I'll give you everything
All my love is yours

All my love is yours
I'll give you everything
