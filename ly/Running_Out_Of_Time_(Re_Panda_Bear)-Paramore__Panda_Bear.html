		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Time's up again
I'm planning the getaway
Or grinding the life away, I can't tell
I wanna say, I'm throwing another die
Or hoping to nullify, I can't tell

(I'm always running out of time)
I'm not the lucky one, I keep to myself
Then wish for better, I can't tell

Every now and then
Can't hide it, I'm turning up
Side-stepping the truth somewhat
I can't tell
I know it's meant
Can't tell if I've had enough
If I'm giving or given up
I can't tell

(I'm always running out of time)
I'm not the lucky one, I keep to myself
Then wish for better, just can't tell
I got a mystery I keep to myself
Put it together 'cause I can't tell

Time's up again
I'm planning the getaway
Or grinding my life away, I can't tell
A secret I can't tell, I can't tell
A secret I can't tell

Think I feel a fracture in the mirror, just can't tell
And I've got a feeling it's unlocking, now I've fell
(I'm always running out of time)
Think I feel a fracture in the mirror, just can't tell
And I've got a feeling it's unlocking, now I've fell
I can't tell
