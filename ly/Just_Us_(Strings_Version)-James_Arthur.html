		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't stand being the cause of the tears on your cheek
There's a lump in my throat and it won't let me speak
You've been asking to talk
I've been putting it off 'cause I'm
Scared of letting you win on the lies that I keep

And I know the love I've been chasing
Is a waste of time

And I don't wanna say it, but I've been out of control
And I'm ready to face it, baby, once and for all
I'm so tired of running, I'm sick of letting you down
It's been a lonely road but it's all over now
It's just us from here on out

And I hear people talk about love just for something to say
And in this modern world you can live and then die any day
It's a shock to the heart, we got lost in the dark but
Unconditional love is a light that never fades

And I know the love I've been chasing
Is a waste of time

And I don't wanna say it, but I've been out of control
And I'm ready to face it, baby, once and for all
I'm so tired of running, I'm sick of letting you down
It's been a lonely road but it's all over now
It's just us from here on

'Cause you know that
I know it's
Always been you
Always you

And I don't wanna say it, but I've been out of control
And I'm ready to face it, baby, once and for all
I'm so tired of running, I'm sick of letting you down
It's been a lonely road but it's all over now
It's just us from here on out
It's just us from here on out
From here on out
