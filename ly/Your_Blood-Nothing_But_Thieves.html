		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You know it's your blood that I bleed
Tell me that there's some way that I'll get through the night
I carry your moral disease
I don't wanna be something I'm not to stay alive

But I don't know what you expected of me
I've never seen you cry
Yeah, you don't know what it is to be sorry
So I'll carry the lie
We're real men 'til we die
But I don't think I will ever get over you
No, I don't think I will ever get over you

I'm powerless to do anything
Drain away my light, like a leaking battery

Still I don't know what you expected of me
I've never seen you cry
Yeah, you don't know what it is to be sorry
So I'll carry the lie
We're real men 'til we die
But I don't think I will ever get over you
No, I don't think I will ever get over you

Oh no, there's no escape
No matter how I try
Now I'm stuck on one day
For the rest of my life

You know it's your blood that I bleed
Tell me that there's some way that I'll get through the night
