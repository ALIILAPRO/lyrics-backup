		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You are on my mind.
You are on my mind.

Ev'ry little thing I do you're on my mind.
The way I feel lately, it's driving me crazy.
Ev'ry little thing I do you're on my mind.
I can't get over you.
I think about you all the time.

Can't you see what you do to me.
I think about you all the time.
My mind is hazy and I'm mixed up,
feeling crazy over you let's not waste any time.

Ev'ry little thing I do you're on my mind.
The way I feel lately, it's driving me crazy.
Ev'ry little thing I do you're on my mind.
I can't get over you.
I think about you all the time.

Round and round I go,
where I'll stop only you'll know.
I guess it's all in my mind.
Take your time, think it over.
Let me know what you wanna do
Baby, it's all good.

Ev'ry little thing I do you're on my mind.
The way I feel lately, it's driving me crazy.
Ev'ry little thing I do you're on my mind.
I can't get over you.
I think about you all the time.

Ev'ry little thing I do you're on my mind,
you're on my mind hey.
Ev'ry little thing I do you're on my mind,
you're on my mind hey.
Ev'ry little thing I do you're on my mind,
you're on my mind hey.
Ev'ry little thing I do you're on my mind,
you're on my mind hey.

Ev'ry little thing I do you're on my mind.
The way I feel lately it's driving me crazy.
Ev'ry little thing I do you're on my mind. 
I can't get over you. I think about you all the time.

Ev'ry little thing I do you're on my mind.
The way I feel lately it's driving me crazy.
Ev'ry little thing I do you're on my mind.
