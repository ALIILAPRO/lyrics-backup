		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fistfuls of blood
Red smears across my face
Like what you got?
Now bear it with grace
I did you wrong you payed the price
One life long means too much time
All night long I hear you cry
You can ́t stand a love like mine
What a pitiful sound
Of such a beautiful soul
Imma make ya mouth shut
With words so damn cold
What a paralyzing show
I ́m about to blow
This dawg deserves to die
I make em puppies cry
Is it love or is it pain
ERROR ERROR inside my brain
Imma pour em down the drain
Call it love I call it pain
Is it love or is it pain
ERROR all over my brain
Imma pour them down the drain
Call it love but don ́t complain
Your face in cold blood stain
Imma drive em boiz insane
Make them com and go again
They won ́t buck my rusty chain chain chain chain
Don ́t we all look better jaded
You must see your time has faded
Do what I must I got bred that way
A life so short and no god to pray
Is it love or is it pain
ERROR ERROR inside my brain
Imma pour em down the drain
Call it love I call it pain
Is it love or is it pain
ERROR all over my brain
Imma pour them down the drain
Call it love but don ́t complain
You ́re depending on me you hopeless stray stray stray
I am the haunt and you ́re my pray pray pray
Fill me up with novocaine
But you ́ll never heal my pain
You ́re so innocent
I hate that It ends
You digged way too deep
So imma make you sleep
Sleep with the fishes
Chop you up in inches
No time for wishes
Pisces the fishes
