		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Broken, bleeding, battered, screaming
Beaten, pleading, seething make it stop
Oh, how nice it would be
To pull out these knives embedded in me

Yeah, first chance and you took it
Roll me in to the grave when you've dug it
Oh, how nice it would be
To pull out these knives embedded in me

Abandoned, deserted, hurting, twisted
All this, madness, all this pain please make it stop
Two fingers squeezing on the trigger as you pull it
Standing tall I'm here dodging all your bullets

I sit at the foot of the tree
Cain and Able throw stones at me
Draped in the flesh of serpentile creatures

It's nothing personal, it's just business
Now we know where we stand in the sickness
Witness the fall of the ancient covenant

Broken, bleeding, battered, screaming
Beaten, pleading, seething make it stop
Oh, how nice it would be
To pull out these knives embedded in me
Yeah, first chance and you took it
Roll me in to the grave when you've dug it now

I agree with the message, not the method of delivery
As I sift through the wreckage, do I even see our history?
My rebirth has just begun
Reawakening eclipse the sun
I tear through the shell that I was before
For evermore

The shell that I was before

For evermore

Abandoned, deserted, hurting, twisted
All this, madness, all this pain please make it stop
Two fingers squeezing on the trigger as you pull it
Standing tall I'm here dodging all your bullets

I sit at the foot of the tree
Cain and Able throw stones at me
Draped in the flesh of serpentile creatures

It's nothing personal, it's just business
Now we know where we stand in the sickness
Witness the fall of the ancient covenant

It's nothing personal, it's just business
Now we know where we stand in the sickness
Witness the fall of the ancient covenant

Your foundations are meaningless
Your foundations are a lie
When you walk hand in hand through the shadows, just know I'm never by your side
Your foundations are meaningless
Your foundations are a fucking lie
When you walk hand in hand through the shadows, just know I'm never by your side
