		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Love had played its games on me so long
I started to believe I'd never find anyone
Doubt had tried to convince me to give in
Said, "You can't win"

But one day the sun came a shinin' through
The rain had stopped and the skies were blue
And oh, what a revelation to see
Someone was saying "I love you" to me

A one in a million 
Chance of a lifetime
And life showed compassion
And sent to me a stroke of love called "You"
A one in a million you

I was a lonely man with empty arms to fill
Then I found a piece of happiness to call my own
And life is worth livin' again
For to love you, to me, is to live

A one in a million 
Chance of a lifetime
And life showed compassion
And sent to me a stroke of love called "You"
A one in a million you

A one in a million 
Chance of a lifetime
And life showed compassion
And sent to me a stroke of love called "You"
One in a million you

A one in a million you
