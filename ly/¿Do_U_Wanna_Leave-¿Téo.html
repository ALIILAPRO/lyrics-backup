		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wanna take you far
Blues and greys make up my days but you stand out apart
Show your heart
Hard to say we've found our way when we're lost from the start
So do you wanna leave?
Do you wanna leave?

Play your part
It's the same old sound as the wheels go round
It's a cycle when you reaping what you sow
Faded lights
If the world went down and there's no one around
One question for you now

Do you wanna leave?
Do you wanna leave?
Do you wanna leave?
Do you wanna leave?
