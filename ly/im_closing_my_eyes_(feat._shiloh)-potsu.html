		  I know you so well, so well
I mean, I can do anything that he can
I've been pretty i know you so well, so well
I mean, I can do anything that he can
I've been pretty i know you so well, so well
I mean, I can do anything that he can
I've been pretty i know you so well, so well
I mean, I can do anything that he can
I've been pretty i know you so well, so well
I mean, I can do anything that he can
I've been pretty

I've been pretty crazy
I've been pretty crazy over her
And I've been pretty crazy, over her ooh
And I've been pretty crazy, over her ooh

I know you so well i know you
I mean, I can do anything that he can
Without you i've been pretty
I know you so well
