		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's better than depression, it's easier than bein' a fool
A similar conception, cyanide is only a tool
Opals, both sides, tell me if I get it right, battle of the branded
So much for the trickle down economy, cattle of the planet

I don't know what comes out of my mouth when you make me talk sick
I don't know if it's something I said or if it's something I did
I don't know what I'm talking about when you make me talk shit
No surprise, you can look in my eyes and you know you did
Oh, you made me talk sick

Returning me to sender, eliminate the social elite
You stick it in a blender and revolutionize to the beat
Diamonds show me, shinin' 'cause they know me, the moral is romantic
Stand there, don't move, I know it's always you
You only dance when you're frantic

I don't know what comes out of my mouth when you make me talk sick
I don't know if it's something I said or if it's something I did
I don't know what I'm talking about when you make me talk shit
No surprise, you can look in my eyes and you know you did

You talk shit to me

I don't know what comes out of my mouth when you make me talk sick
I don't know if it's something I said or if it's something I did
I don't know what I'm talking about when you make me talk shit
No surprise, you can look in my eyes and you know, know

(You know I'm upset)

You fuckin' talk sick
You fuckin' talk sick
You fuckin' talk sick
You fuckin' talk sick
