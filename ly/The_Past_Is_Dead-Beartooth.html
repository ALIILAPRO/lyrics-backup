		  (Oh)
(Oh)
(Oh)
(Oh)
(Oh)
(Oh)
(Oh)
(Oh)

Turn the lights down let me think clearly
Everything is such a blur these days
Made the right sound
Finally you hear me
Think I'm feeling ok

But it's so hard to grasp these changes
It's so hard to find my pride
Diving deeper into madness
Anything it takes to feel alive

Well we can't go back
We don't know where to begin (oh)
All the life drains out
We can't try making amends (oh)
Even though I'm trying my best
Doing all I can
As you might have guessed
I don't know how to pretend
I can't accept that the past is dead

Open up now give me some feeling
Took a chance threw it all away
It's a wreck now nobody's healing
How the hell can I stay

When it's so hard to grasp these changes
It's so hard to find my pride
Diving deeper into madness
Anything it takes to feel alive

Well we can't go back
We don't know where to begin (oh)
All the life drains out
We can't try making amends (oh)
Even though I'm trying my best
Doing all I can
As you might have guessed
I don't know how to pretend
I can't accept that the past is dead

I can't accept that the past is dead (the past is dead)
I can't accept that the past is dead

Let it go

Well we can't go back
We don't know where to begin (oh)
All the life drains out
We can't try making amends (oh)
Even though I'm trying my best
Doing all I can
As you might have guessed
I don't know how to pretend
I can't accept that the past is dead (oh)
(Oh)
(Oh)
(Oh)
