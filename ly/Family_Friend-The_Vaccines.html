		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They've all got their opinions, but then what do they know?
If you can't go back, where the hell do you go?
Does everybody really feel as high as a kite?
Well, I don't really know if they do, but they might

Well, you wanna get young, but you're just getting older
And you had a fun summer, but it's suddenly colder
If you want a bit of love, put your head on my shoulder
It's cool

They've all got their opinions, but then what do they know?
If you can't go back, where the hell do you go?
Does everybody really feel as high as a kite?
Well, I don't really know if they do, but they might

Well, you wanna get young, but you're just getting older
And you had a fun summer, but it's suddenly colder
If you want a bit of love, put your head on my shoulder
It's cool
Yeah, you wanna get young, but you're just getting older
And you had a fun summer, but it's suddenly colder
If you want a bit of love, put your head on my shoulder
It's cool

Half-baked girl, hey, I'm hardly surprised
Snake eyes disguise everybody's lies
Faded nail marks on pale thighs
And an awkward secret that someone denies
And now you're tryna get yourself back in
Yeah, you're tryna get yourself back in
Come on in
Come on in
Oh

Well, you wanna get young, you're just getting older
And you had a fun summer, but it's suddenly colder
Do you want a bit of love? Put your head on my shoulder
It's cool
Well, you wanna get young, you're just getting older
And you had a fun summer, but it's suddenly colder
Do you want a bit of love? Put your head on my shoulder
It's cool
Well, you wanna get young, you're just getting older
And you had a fun summer, but it's suddenly colder
If you want a bit of love, put your head on my shoulder
It's cool
