Yeah
Yeah
Uh, uh, Mr. Glock, ayy

I never ever put a bitch before my money (nah)
I never put a bitch before my money or my mommy (nah)
Yeah, you got the wrong youngin, baby, I am not no dummy, uh (bitch)
You know how I'm coming, bitch, I keep them commas comin', yeah
Where the money at? Run it, uh, all hundreds, yeah (yeah)
All these damn dead pres' make me feel haunted, uh
Big ass diamonds on my neck (bling), bungee jumpin', yeah (boing)
I be lookin' like a check, they be lookin' funny, hah, ayy

Word on the street, uh (word), that lil' nigga Key (Glock)
Word on the street, yeah, I heard he keep that heat (yeah)
Word on the street (word), yeah, I heard he play for keeps, uh
Word on the street, I heard they'll knock you off your feet, fire

Word on the street, uh (word), that lil' nigga Key (Glock)
Word on the street (word), yeah, I heard he keep that heat, uh
Word on the street, yeah, I heard he play for keeps, uh (I heard)
Word on the street (word), I heard they'll knock you off your feet (word)

Yeah, the gang pull up deep, AMG and SRTs (word)
And your bitch is a freak, she pull up, get straight on her knees, yeah (word)
That's your main squeeze, but Glizock fuck her with ease, uh (word)
But that's another story, huh, let me sip my tea, yeah (hold up)
Let me sip my tea, I'm in London right now with my team, uh (my gang)
Smokin' on some pound, can't record when pounds in my jeans, yeah (can't)
This hoe just had the nerve to tell me I'm the man of her dreams, but
Can't nothin' in this world come between me and monefa (what the fuck?)

I never ever put a bitch before my money (yeah)
I never put a bitch before my money or my mommy (uh-uh)
Yeah, you got the wrong youngin', baby, I am not no dummy, uh (bitch)
You know how I'm coming, bitch, I keep them commas comin', yeah
Where the money at? Run it, all hundreds, yeah
All these damn dead pres' make me feel haunted, uh
Big ass diamonds on my neck, bungee jumpin', yeah (boing)
I be lookin' like a check, they be lookin' funny, hah, ayy

Word on the street, uh (word), that lil' nigga Key (Glock)
Word on the street, yeah, I heard he keep that heat, uh
Word on the street, yeah, I heard he play for keeps, uh
Word on the street, I heard they'll knock you off your feet, fire

Knock you off your feet, uh, and put you on a t-shirt (t-shirt)
Bitch, everything I got came out the dirt, yeah (the mud)
Call me trillion dollar Glock, lil' bitch, I know my worth, uh (duh)
I be shittin' on these niggas, I do it on purpose (yeah)
Ballin' back to back to back without a fuckin' jersey, uh (yeah)
Ain't no squares in my circle, I barely got a circle, uh (on gang)
I cut 'em off like surgery (cut), yeah, I did that shit real urgent, uh (on God)
I'm 'bout to buy a Birkin, fill it up with racks and tell my mama Christmas early 
(Here, ma), ayy (yeah)

I never ever put a bitch before my money (on God)
I never put a bitch before my money or my mommy (on God)
Yeah, you got the wrong youngin, baby, I am not no dummy, uh
You know how I'm coming, bitch, I keep them commas comin', uh
Where the money at? Run it, all hundreds, yeah (blues)
All these damn dead pres' make me feel haunted, uh (ooh, ooh)
Big ass diamonds on my neck (bling), bungee jumpin', yeah (boing)
I be lookin' like a check, they be lookin' funny, hah, ayy

Word on the street, uh (word), that lil' nigga Key (Glock)
Word on the street (word), yeah, I heard he keep that heat, uh
Word on the street (word), yeah, I heard he play for keeps, uh
Word on the street, I heard they'll knock you off your feet, fire (off your feet, fire)
