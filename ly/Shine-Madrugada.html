		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Did I talk in my sleep, no
Hey, did I wake to find you cry, by my side
We'll never said that it would be easy
Just that the way love grows, we have to go to.

Oh well, hunny you, tonight
I'm here, tonight
Oh no, fall like a star
Oh in time, you and I, we'll shine

Oh now, hold your hand on running water
and now, wipe the black out of the blonde
Well now your head falls down on me
And your beauty is as pure as tears.

Oh well, hunny you, tonight
I'm here, tonight
Oh no, fall like a star
Oh in time, you and I, we'll shine.

Oh, hunny you, tonight
I'm here, tonight
I'm here, tonight
Oh no, fall like a star
Oh in time, you and I, we'll shine.
