		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't hate me, give love a chance
Don't need your heart, just need your hands
Knew from the start that this won't end
Don't you tease me, baby, please

Pretty please, pretty please
Pretty please, pretty please
Pretty please, pretty please
Pretty please, pretty please

Don't you tease me, baby, please

I'm gon' touch if you let me
Give me love if you have it
No more talk, let me have it
Swear now I'm ready
Had enough, I admit it
Lookin' so camera ready
Got me feelin' some type of way
'Cause your body is so wavy

This feels too good to let it go, ayy
But I can't let you lock the door, mm
Don't hate me, give love a chance
Don't need your heart, just need your hands
Knew from the start that this won't end
Don't you tease me, baby, please

Don't you tease me, baby, please
Don't you tease me, baby, please

Don't hate me, give love a chance
Don't need your heart, just need your hands
Knew from the start that this won't end
Don't you tease me, baby, please
