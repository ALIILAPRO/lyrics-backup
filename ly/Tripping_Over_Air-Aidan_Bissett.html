		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I hear you talking in your sleep again
You're holding onto something real
Can't get enough of what's been in your head
Our secret's out, I'm feelin' this

Is there something on your mind? 'Cause
You're the only thing on mine, love
Wanna tell you all the time but

I know
She likes boys that play guitar
Tattooed arms and a beat up car
I know she's gonna break my heart
I know
She likes me when I play it cool
I can't help it, I hate the rules
I know she's gonna break my heart

But I don't fucking care
That she don't fucking care
I'm trippin' over air
Tryna read your mind
No, I don't fucking care
That she don't fucking care
I'm trippin' over air
Tryna get it right, yeah

So why'd you go ahead and tell your friends?
You got me twisted up in how I feel
You love to start then stop then start again
But I hate the way that I'm feeling this

Is there something on your mind? 'Cause
You're the only thing on mine, love
Wanna tell you all the time but

I know
She likes boys that play guitar
Tattooed arms and a beat up car
I know she's gonna break my heart
I know
She likes me when I play it cool
I can't help it, I hate the rules
I know she's gonna break my heart
(I know but I don't fucking care)

But I don't fucking care
That she don't fucking care
I'm trippin' over air
Tryna read your mind (tryna read your mind)
No, I don't fucking care
That she don't fucking care
I'm trippin' over air
Tryna get it right, yeah

She likes boys that play guitar
Tattooed arms and a beat up car
I know she's gonna break my heart
I know
She likes me when I play it cool
I can't help it, I hate the rules
I know she's gonna break my heart
(I know but I just don't fucking care)

But I don't fucking care
That she don't fucking care
I'm trippin' over air
Tryna get it right (tryna get it right)
