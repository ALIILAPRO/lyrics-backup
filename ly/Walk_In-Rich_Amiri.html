		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One and only

In that GTR, when I'm slidin'
I don't fuck with her, she just ridin'
I took molly, molly, molly
Then took five Xans
I'm in Prada, Prada, Prada, I'm too locked in
I'm like goddamn, I'm like goddamn
I had some more friends but I lost them
Scratch 'em off the list, had to cross them
Ah keep a tool with me when I walk in
(Pew, pew, pew)

Ayy, don't fuck with these niggas
They be watchin'
That my twin, that my twizzy
We too locked in
Hit up Neiman's, spend a band when I walk in
You ain't know your ho a bird
She be flockin' say you got them racks, boy
You need to stop it, uh
Got too many racks, can't even
Fit 'em in my pocket, uh
I'm a whole rockstar, hit that
Boy right with a rocket, uh
Not talkin' 'bout money, then you
Know I change the topic, uh

When I see you, it's on, uh
When I see you, it's on, ayy
When I see you, it's on, ayy
When I see you, it's on

In that GTR, when I'm slidin'
I don't fuck with her, she just ridin'
I took molly, molly, molly
Then took five Xans
I'm in Prada, Prada, Prada, I'm too locked in
I'm like goddamn, I'm like goddamn
I had some more friends but I lost them
Scratch 'em off the list, had to cross them
Ah keep a tool with me when I walk in
(Pew, pew, pew)
