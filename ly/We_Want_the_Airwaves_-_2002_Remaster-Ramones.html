		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Nine to five and five to nine
Ain't gonna take it, it's our time
We want the world and we want it now
We're gonna take it, anyhow

We want the airwaves (that's right, that's right)
We want the airwaves (that's right, that's right)
We want the airwaves, baby
If rock is gonna stay alive

Oh yeah, well, all right
Let's rock, tonight, all night

Oh yeah, well, all right
Let's rock, tonight, all night

Where's your guts and will to survive?
Don't you want to keep rock and roll music alive?
Mister programmer, I got my hammer for to smash my, smash my radio

We want the airwaves (that's right, that's right)
We want the airwaves (that's right, that's right)
We want the airwaves, baby
If rock is gonna stay alive

Oh yeah, well, all right
Let's rock, tonight, all night

Oh yeah, well, all right
Let's rock, tonight, all night

We want the airwaves, airwaves
We want the airwaves, airwaves
We want the airwaves, airwaves
We want the airwaves, airwaves
We want the airwaves, baby
