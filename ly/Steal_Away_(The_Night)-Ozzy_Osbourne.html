		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now I feel the time is right
Love will flow like wine tonight
Give your love and it will come to you

If you feel that you and me
Could escape and hold the key
To a paradise that's true and free

Steal away, steal away
Steal away the night
You gotta steal it, come on baby

Now I've met your honesty
You are here and I am free
Broken chains have fallen all around yeah

Point my finger at the fools
Broken chains and broken rules
Let it be rebellion rules tonight yeah 

Steal away, you steal away
Steal away the night

Could it be a dream come true
Now that I am here with you
Tearful eyes of joy is something new

Runaway with me tonight
Dream the dream, light the light
Happiness is what you give to me, oh yeah

Steal away, steal away
You gotta steal away the night

Steal away, steal away
You gotta steal away the night

Steal away, steal away, steal away the night
