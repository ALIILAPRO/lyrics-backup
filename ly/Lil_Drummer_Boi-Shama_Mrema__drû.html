		  Pa rum pum puuuum
Pa rum pum puuuum
Pa rum pum puuuum
Pa rum pum puuuum

Pa rum pum... PUM
Lil Sham' got that DRUM 
Dru got ProTools on UHH 
We remixed a strong 
Behold the king, man he is great
Here's something I need to get straight
I got no gifts but some dope beats and some dope rhymes and my mixtape

Ain't a drummer boi but I hit the beats
I got eggnog when I'm in the streets
It's Christmas here so I'm spreading cheer
Going nonstop till I hit the sheets

In the mood
man shout out to Dru
cause I killed the beats that he made
I wrote this song while I rode with Santa so you can say that I slayed 

Traffic's been crazy but I don't stress
Tis the season man it is the best
Got some elf ears and a Christmas vest
Do you got spirit? Here's a litmus test

Were you decorating on Thanksgiving
I was decked out before it came here
Do you hear what I hear
I'm throwing money, make it rain deer

Pa rum pum... PUM
Lil Sham' got that DRUM 
Dru got ProTools on UHH 
We remixed a strong 
Behold the king, man he is great
Here's something I need to get straight
I got no gifts but some dope beats and some dope rhymes and my mixtape

I'm not a choosy beggar any gift I'll take
Been good all year I got gifts a stake
Don't invite me over cuz if I come over than your family better serve fruitcake 

When it comes to money I let it go
Y'all make it rain and I let it snow. 
Sleep with one eye open by the fireplace to catch Saint Nick and he'll never know

I might watch every hallmark movies and I might shed a tear
Been waiting 11 months from dawn to dusk for my favorite time of year

I got a new car for my bay-bay
I got everything layaway 
Oh you're too cool for the holidays that's it's weird flex but okay

Pa rum pum... PUM
Lil Sham' got that DRUM 
Dru got ProTools on UHH 
We remixed a strong 
Behold the king, man he is great
Here's something I need to get straight
I got no gifts but some dope beats and some dope rhymes and my mixtape

Pa rum pum... PUM
Lil Sham' got that DRUM 
Dru got ProTools on UHH 
We remixed a strong 
Behold the king, man he is great
Here's something I need to get straight
I got no gifts but some dope beats and some dope rhymes and my mixtape
