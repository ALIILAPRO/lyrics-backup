		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  Greez
True, ay

I'm tryna get paid, take money, cash cheques
You see the set, that's Lash, that's Dex
Young C, Young Shorty, Milkavelli
White bricks, True Religion, on the telly, it's me
Wiz got the house full of freaks
That's why I haven't been around for a week
I'm getting pounds in my sleep
I'm at the top of the mountain, it's peak
Bring it back before the villain
I had a life, real talk, True Religion
It's in the blood, in the genes, in the stitching
Walked in, no weapon, made a killing
Tongue kissing pretty women
New iPhone 'cause I'm done with all the bitching
Tryna be in my position
Keep my shades on 'cause they tryna see the vision

She tell me, "Badman, see, I need your love
See, I need your love"
Me need you close to me, me, 'til I see me, oh, stay on the road
Bad energy stay far away, make you stay far away
Just give me love for the night
Give me love for the night, gyal, waste no time

Breakfast in bed on a plane
I could never complain
I was walking with the limp, had the cane
Dex said greatness and nothing was the same
Now we're set for life
I saw the turn up button and I pressed it twice
You heard I'm in the club, then my best advice
Is put your shoes on and come and get your wife
'Cause we've been having sex just for exercise
Every night man are doing sexercise
She looks into my eyes, now she's mesmerised

She tell me, "Badman, see, I need your love
See, I need your love"
Me need you close to me, me, 'til I see me, oh, stay on the road
Bad energy stay far away, make you stay far away
Just give me love for the night
Give me love for the night, gyal, waste no time

Ay, they better get used to the flex
African man, you see the jewels on my neck
Black James Bond, that's the new silhouette
You see me in the street and I was moving correct
Been running around, tryna do the home run
Left that girl, she was no fun
I tie one, smoke one
Big chief Skeppy and I answer to no one
Counting my blessings, I'm feeling special
Bird's eye view, SK level
Give them the Shaku when I dance with the devil
Young Fela Kuti, the return of the rebel
I told her I need some space
Real busy body, never stay in one place
And she knows I've got more tricks under my sleeve
That's why she never wants me to leave

She tell me, "Badman, see, I need your love
See, I need your love"
Me need you close to me, me, 'til I see me, oh, stay on the road
Bad energy stay far away, make you stay far away
Just give me love for the night
Give me love for the night, gyal, waste no time
