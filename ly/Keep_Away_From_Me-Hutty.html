		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Not in contact with my host
They who thought who did the most
Heading my way towards the coast
Lift your finger for a toast
Are you feeling me?
Would you get it off your back when you ain't hear from me
Have a feeling I lost track of what put fear in me
Now I'm making up what's lost and had been steering me
Have to pay a fee
Keep away from me
They've been waiting for me
What they take from me
It been breaking me
Take a step from me
I pull up A three
It been shaping me
I'm all day AP
Keep away from me
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Keep away from me
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Life in action, I'm a tape it
Heavy passion while I'm faded
Call you laughing when I made it
Clear up trees that heavy shaded
Would you believe in me?
Steady bouncing on my shit while you've been banking me
Steady bass watching the kid blow like a prodigy
Last the wave just like the ocean, they all got to see
I'ma take away my name
Give it back to where it came
To the state
To the bank
Keep it going how it made
Never messing up my aim
Keep away from me
They've been waiting for me
What they take from me
It been breaking me
Take a step from me
I pull up A three
It been shaping me
I'm all day AP
Keep away from me
Oh, yeah, damn, damn
Keep away from me
Oh, yeah, damn, damn
I can't feel it no more
Please hold onto my coat
I won't keep, let me go
Off the side of the boat
I may struggle to float
I'd slip your mind like it's soap
Bring my girl to my home
No tires stolen gone
I just need your loving
There's too much they stole away from me
Next time you think up of something
I hope it ain't came from me
Don't want to leave our old spot
Feel it's all that we've got
Manage all that they've taught
Keep my love, it won't stop
Keep away from me
They've been waiting for me
What they take from me
It been breaking me
Take a step from me
I pull up A three
It been shaping me
I'm all day AP
Keep away from me
They've been waiting for me
What they take from me
It been breaking me
Take a step from me
I pull up A three
It been shaping me
I'm all day AP
Keep away from me
Oh, yeah, damn, damn
Keep away from me
Oh, yeah, damn, damn
