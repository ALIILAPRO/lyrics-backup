		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Young man mistaken
Comparing how he's shaping from his past
Its gone so fast

From kerosine and fear of queens
Our summertime identities don't last
No they don't last

And as our time shrinks
I just want to keep you in this fine space
I like you from your hair ties to your shoe lace

And if it takes just a little heartache it'll be alright
And if it takes us a really long way it's a scenic drive
Cause if it's you who's down the line well that's alright

Well yesterday's unsolved and
Tomorrows already crawling up my back
And I need a scratch

And it's terribly unfair to me
How all these miles don't leave me any tracks, just a common rash

But as our time shrinks
I just want to keep you in this fine space
I need someone to quarterback this long race

And if it takes just a little heartache it'll be alright
And if it takes us a really long way it's a scenic drive
Cause if it's you who's down the line well that's alright

And if it takes just a little heartache it'll be alright
And if it takes us a really long way it's a scenic drive
Cause if it's you who's down the line well that's alright
Yeah that's alright
Yeah that's alright
Yeah that's alright
