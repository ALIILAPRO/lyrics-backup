		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, say you'll be there
I'm, giving you everything
All that joy can bring, this I swear

Last time, that we had this conversation
I decided we should be friends, hey
But now, we're going 'round in circles
Tell me will this Deja vu never end, oh
Now you tell me that you've fallen in love
Well I never ever thought that would be, eh
This time, you gotta take it easy
Throwing far too much emotions at me

But any fool can see they're falling
I gotta make you understand
I'm giving you everything
All that joy can bring, this I swear
I'll give you everything
And, all that I want from you
Is the promise you will be there
Say you will be there, yeah
Ow, say you will be there
A-won't you sing it with me?

If you, put two and two together
You will see what our friendship is for, oh
If you, can't work this equation
Then I guess I'll have to show you the door
There is no need to say you love me
It would be better left unsaid

I'm (I'm)
Giving you everything (I give you everything)
All that joy can bring (all that joy can bring)
This I swear (yes I swear)
And (and)
All that I want from you (all I want from you)
Is the promise you (is a promise you)
Will be there
Yeah, I want you

Any fool can see they're falling
I gotta make you understand
I'll give you everything on this I swear
Just promise you'll always be there

I'm, giving you everything (I'm giving you everything)
All that joy can bring (all that joy can bring)
This I swear (yes I swear)
And, all that I want from you (all that I want from you)
Is the promise you (want you to promise too)
Will be there (always be there)
I'm, giving you everything (I'm giving you everything)
All that joy can bring (all that joy can bring)
This I swear (yes I swear)
And, all that I want from you (all that I want from you)
Is the promise you (want you to promise too)
Will be there (always be there)
I'm, giving you everything (I'm giving you everything)
All that joy can bring (all that joy can bring)
This I swear (yes I swear)
And, all that I want from you (all that I want from you)
Is the promise you (want you to promise too)
Will be there (always be there)
