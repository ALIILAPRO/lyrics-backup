		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's something about your body
I'm not in a rush
But girl I'm ready to marry you
Yeah right here in the restaurant
And start on our honeymoon
While you still got your dress on
While you still got your dress on

Now I ain't trying to offend nobody
But girl don't they see you
It's cool if they don't
'Cause hey I only see me and you
That's why I'm all over you
While you still got your dress on
While you still got your dress on

I can't wait
'Cause girl as soon as I look at your face
I see a world where our heart never breaks
To me that means that the whole world could change but not mine
I can't wait

The way I know your body
I don't really need much
Girl I know where to touch
Stay where you are
Drop all your worries
And you can leave all the rest on
We can do it
While you still have your dress on

There's something about your body
I'm not in a rush
But girl I'm ready to marry you
Yeah right here in the restaurant
And start on our honeymoon
While you still got your dress on
While you still got your dress on

Now I ain't trying to offend nobody
But girl don't they see you
It's cool if they don't
'Cause hey I only see me and you
That's why I'm all over you
While you still got your dress on
While you still got your dress on

I can't wait
'Cause girl as soon as I look at your face
I see a world where our heart never breaks
To me that means that the whole world could change but not mine
I can't wait

Let me take you
So walk with me
Through the beautiful sand, as we take pictures
Hips so wide, looks like it's got whiskers
Let put a solid gold on that solid figure
Go ahead show your pretty dentures
Your pretty physique, your pretty toes
I'm pretty with you
I do a good job for that pretty picture
You the prettiest, but I'm the only thing that's missing

I can't wait
'Cause girl as soon as I look at your face
I see a world where our heart never breaks
To me that means that the whole world could change but not mine
I can't wait
