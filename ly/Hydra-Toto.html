		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There was a man
He walked around
Searching for the girl who had just caught his eye
"I was a fool!" he cried
His mind had wandered
He blinked and the sky moved e'er so slightly
He searched the city and she was nowhere to be found
Meanwhile she was floating downward, downward

[Chorus]
Do you want your freedom
Do you want my love
Do you want your freedom
From the one you're thinking of

There lies a lady
Naked and yet not knowing
A spell, it gains her heart forever
Preyed upon by the wolves in Time Square
Fell into an abyss of dead air
Innocence caged in sanctuary
There sat the Dragon Lord
Playing solitary
Defying the rules the holy boys leap Hell's Kitchen

[Chorus]

Suddenly a voice was heard
Ina a flash the brave young man appeared
The Dragon will cut him with his tail
Chased him to the stairway
Caught him halfway to the top
Sent him whirling down
Fireball, summer solstice
Dragon Lord descended down on him
She turned to look but saw only darkness, silence

[Chorus]
