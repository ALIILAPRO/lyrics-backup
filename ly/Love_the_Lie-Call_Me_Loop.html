		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wake up in the space in my bed
One of the things that you left at the end
Plus a hundred things unsaid, but whatever
They all say, "You gotta give it time"
But I'm not sitting 'round wasting mine
Might be a bit out of my mind, whatever

Good vibes only today
No cares, I'm running away
Can't nobody get a hold of me
Good vibes only from now
Won't let nothing bring me down
Can't nobody get a hold of me, hey

Party from one, two, three, four, five
I won't be coming home tonight
Got satisfaction in my sights, whoa
Party from one, two, three, four, five
Body on body coming alive
Rum in my hand all night, night, night
I'ma live the lie, love the lie
I'ma live the lie, love the lie

Wake up and there's pain in my head
Memories that are full of regret
But I know I'll do it again 'cause whatever
Yeah, whatever

Good vibes only today
No cares, I'm running away
Can't nobody get a hold of me, of me, of me, of me
Good vibes only from now
Won't let nothing bring me down
Can't nobody get a hold of me, huh

Party from one, two, three, four, five
I won't be coming home tonight
Got satisfaction in my sights, whoa, whoa-whoa
Party from one, two, three, four, five
Body on body coming alive
Rum in my hand all night, night, night
I'ma live the lie, love the lie
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
I'ma live the lie, love the lie

Good vibes only today
No cares, I'm running away
Can't nobody get a hold of me, of me, of me, of me
Good vibes only from now
Won't let nothing bring me down
Can't nobody get a hold of me, no, no, no, no

Party from one, two, three, four, five
I won't be coming home tonight
Got satisfaction in my sights, whoa, whoa-whoa
Party from one, two, three, four, five
Body on body coming alive
Rum in my hand all night, night, night
I'ma live the lie, love the lie
Hey, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
I'ma live the lie, love the lie
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
I'ma live the lie, love the lie
