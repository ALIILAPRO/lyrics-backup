		<p>
		  I think I'm losing your love...

This has got to be,
where you've had enough,
you're moving far from me.
It's getting hard to breathe,
I feel it rising up,
I feel it in motion, 
feel it in motion.

I been losing my love,
I been losing my love,
I feel it in motion, 
feel it in motion.

I think I'm losing your love,
I feel it in motion,
feel it in motion.

I think I'm losing your love...

This has got to be,
where you've had enough,
you're moving far from me.
It's getting hard to breathe,
I feel it rising up,
I feel it in motion, 
feel it in motion.

I been losing my love,
I think I'm losing your love,
I feel it in motion,
feel it in motion.

I think I'm losing your love,
I feel it in motion,
feel it in motion.

I think I'm losing your love...
