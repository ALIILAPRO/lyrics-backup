		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I live a lifetime every moment
When I'm holding you close
Lay your head down on my shoulder
Honey I won't ever let go
Because you pulled me like a magnet
Now I'm right where I belong
I'm gonna love you the same
For the rest of my days
And on and on and on

Cause as long as we keep dancing
We'll stay young at heart
And every time I hold you in my arms

You give me deja vu
Like I've been waiting my whole life
To find that view
Cause when I'm looking at your eyes
I go from California to Timbuktu
Back to dancing in the living room
If I got you
Baby every day's a honeymoon

Oh it's a honeymoon
Baby every day's a honeymoon

I wanna spend some time in Paris
Serenade you on the beach
We'll take a picture for our parents
But we're never gonna leave
Nobody knows you like I know you
Nobody loves you like I do
And if I'm never a star
But I've got my guitar
I'll be singing songs to you

Cause as long as we keep dancing
We'll stay young at heart
And every time I hold you in my arms

You give me deja vu
Like I've been waiting my whole life
To find that view
Cause when I'm looking at your eyes
I go from California to Timbuktu
Back to dancing in the living room
If I got you
Baby every day's a honeymoon

Oh it's a honeymoon
Baby every day's a honeymoon

Maybe we'll end up in New York City
Maybe we'll end up out in LA
Maybe we'll decide to stay right here forever after
I will love you all the same

You give me deja vu
Like I've been waiting my whole life
To find that view
Cause when I'm looking at your eyes
I go from California to Timbuktu
Back to dancing in the living room
If I got you
Baby every day's a honeymoon

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh it's a honeymoon
Oh-oh-oh-oh, baby every day's a honeymoon with you
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh it's a honeymoon
If I got you
Baby every day's a honeymoon
