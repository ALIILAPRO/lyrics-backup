		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey girl
I heard you're leaving town
Hey girl
It might not matter now
Hey girl
Maybe it worked somehow 
That's what I tell myself when you lie down tonight

So many times I could've held on
I still can't believe I left you alone
It tore me down to pieces
She'll never know
How much I wished I never let you go

Hi, how you doin'
I heard you seem to be happy now
Hi, how you doin'
Don't worry bout me cause I'm doing fine

So you came around my house
And you left your marks with your fingertips
I'm sitting where you sat down
And now he's looking for something meaningless 

I'm getting getting little nervous (nervous)
I'm getting getting to the surface (surface)
I'm getting getting little nervous (nervous)
I'm getting getting to the surface (surface)

Hi how you doin'
I heard you seem to be happy now
Hi how you doin'
Don't worry 'bout me 'cause I'm doing fine

I'm doing fine
I'm doing fine
I'm doing fine
I'm doing fine
I'm doing fine
I'm doing fine
I'm doing fine
I'm doing fine

I'm doing fine
Girl I'm doing fine
I'm doing fine 
I swear it's not a lie

I'm doing fine
Girl I'm doing fine
I'm doing fine
I swear it's not a lie

I'm getting getting little nervous (nervous)
I'm getting getting to the surface (surface)
I'm getting getting little nervous (nervous)
I'm getting getting to the surface (surface)

He's getting a little nervous
She's getting to the surface
You got a little nervous
Of running back to you when you weren't there

And I'm sorry
I was hurting too much to know
That you were standing right there

And I'm sorry
I will sing this song to you 
To tell you I really cared

And I'm sorry
When I left you all alone
Girl I know that wasn't fair

'Cause I loved you
He loved you
Loved you
