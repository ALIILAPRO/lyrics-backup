		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Something is calling me
Behind my caravan
I can't see it's face but
I'm feeeling it's in the dark
It's moving in the shadows
I can see it's whispering
Keeps calling my name
And the streamline is shivering

The wind breaks words for my love
From the deserts far away
And then it speaks to my heart
Should i stay or fade away
I see your smile in the stars
Shining street light boulevards
The question is passing me by
Should I leave this caravan?

The moonlight is lost
I'll light up my candle light
The flash light, the street lights
To light up my sleepless nights

I follow the stars to the (?) streets boulevards
I leave for the highways
I will get you through the dark

The wind breaks words for my love
From the deserts far away
And then it speaks to my heart
Should I stay or fade away
I see your smile in the stars
Shining street light boulevards
The question is passing me by
Should I leave this caravan?

The wind breaks words for my love
(Deserts far away)
And then it speaks to my heart
(Stay or fade away)
I see your smile in the stars
(Street light boulevards)
The question is passing me by
Should I leave this caravan?
