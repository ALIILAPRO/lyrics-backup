		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This morning I dreamt about missing the train
I spent all that money just to throw it away
So I shot out of bed and bought a stranger some breakfast 
But when I got it, he was no longer there
I searched the whole station, I couldn't find him anywhere

Good luck final girl, I hope you get what you deserve
No one's gonna to do your job for you 
After all, that's not how this thing works

I spent what little I had on trains headed North
Get off at the first stop, walk around 'til I'm bored
That girl down the block said if I wanted to escape 
I could always just knock on her door
But I don't need people like her anymore

Good luck final girl, I hope you get what you deserve
No one's gonna to do your job for you 
After all, that's not how this thing works

I'm postponing my suicide indefinitely
There's horseshoes in his pockets
Handgranades in his spleen
No amount of money could strike him off the calendar 
And I haven't cried in seven years
Slumped in the cafe car hiding my tears

Good luck final girl, I hope you get what you deserve
No one's gonna to do your job for you 
After all, that's not how this thing works
After all, that's not how this thing works
After all, that's not how this thing works
After all, that's not how this thing works
