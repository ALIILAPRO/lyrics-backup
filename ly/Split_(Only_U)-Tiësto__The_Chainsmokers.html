		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Move the crowd when the beat goes down
I rock the stage, they all know my sound

I rock the stage, they all know my sound

Move the crowd when the beat goes down
I rock the stage, they all know my sound

Move the crowd when the beat goes down
Move the crowd when the beat goes down
Move the crowd when the beat goes down

Make it, make it, make it loud

Move the frown when the beat goes down

Make it, make it, make it loud

Move the crowd when the beat goes down
I rock the stage, they all know my sound

Make it, make it, make it loud

Move the crowd when the beat goes down
I rock the stage, they all know my sound
