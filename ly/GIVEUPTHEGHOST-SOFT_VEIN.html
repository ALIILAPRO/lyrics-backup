		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Nothing there in the night
Wasn't clear in the day
Nothing left in the light
Nothing stood in the way
No mark I could make
You can't wash away
Nothing left but the scar
Nothing left i could say
So come and take your pound of flesh
Come along with all the rest
You're a kid with a knife
Stabbing wild in the night
And my body knows
It's gotta give up the ghost
I was prey in the dark
You bored of the chase
You were a song
I was a wraith
Now I walk in the night
Outside your place
Remember the sound
Remember your face
My demons all come out to play
Come to take your love away
You're a kid with a knife
Stabbing wild in the night
And my body knows
It's gotta give up the ghost
We danced with the devil, skin on skin
Wine drunk in another life
I watched you spin
Come back close, pin me down between
The lies I told and the boy I used to be
You're a kid with a knife
Stabbing wild in the night
And my body knows
It's gotta give up the ghost
You're a kid with a knife
Stabbing wild in the night
And my body knows
It's gotta give up the ghost
