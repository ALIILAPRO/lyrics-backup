		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Behold the crucifix – what does it symbolize?
Pallid incompetence hanging on a tree

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Lil Revive, the devil still grinnin'
Like to see me down
But he hate it when I’m winnin'
Thoughts of suicide pushing me to my limit's
Always on my mind, but I
Got to stay sinnin', like
Pentagram on my back, on my cult shit
Had to murder and then bury my emotions
Hate the spotlight, I never really loved it
So many witches, think I gotta start a coven
Black hearse, that’s the suicide benz
Got the burner in the door
If you get under my skin
Got three more in the back
And they all best friends
If you ain't heard of Lil Revive
Where the fuck you been, like
Yeah, all the competition looking stale
Bout to stay ripe
Rolling through the field like
A Halloween hayride when he hear the guitar
You'll be dead by the daylight
She told me that she want me
But I only wanna take lives
Body in the bag, new scythe like a hatchet
Dressing all black
Ghostface when I'm slashin'
Yeah, I know I'm crazy
I don't even try to mask it
Got a good soul
But I'm Dahmer when I’m rappin’
Eat 'em with the flow
Then I put ’em in a casket
I've been with the cult
Now we're doing dark magic
People love to hate
But deep down I know they cappin'
Watch ’em all change when
I drop another classic

Just let me die i'm always broken
Every time

Pull up in the E63
Bought it just so I can feel shit
Made it to the top
But now I'm jumping off the building
Never had a handle on this
Thing you call "life"
Another day, another problem
I'm just waiting to die
It's a long way down
Really testing my patience hate to say it
But I'm running out of motivation
Cut me to the bone
Just so I can see the light
Got a heart made out of stone
Can't believe I'm still alive
I don't wanna talk, I just wanna run away
Walking through the fog
Just to make it to my grave
Write my name up on a casket
Let me ask this:
Have you ever seen an ending so tragic?
