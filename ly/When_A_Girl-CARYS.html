		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ha, ha

Girl you've got a voice
You can sing
But you should never use it to speak
(Ha, ha)
Sure you've got a face
Put some makeup on it
Make you look less unique

All the emotions and tears flooding over 
The moment I enter my door
Sometimes I don't even try
'Cause I'm tired of not knowing who I'm doing it for

Honestly, I can't be
All that you want
I'm too little, too much
When a girl is good, she's never good enough
I'm too smart if I think
I'm too drunk if I drink
I'm too boring when I'm sober
I give up
You don't have to stay (you don't have to stay)
You don't have to wait (you don't have to wait)
I will never fit in your mold
If you want you can call
Somebody else (somebody else)
Or do it by yourself (or do it by yourself)
You don't have to stay to be let down
'Cause honestly I can't be
(Ha, ha)

Just cause' I'm polite
I will always have to fight to get into rooms
And if they let me in
I will have to work a little harder than him

All the emotions and tears flooding over the moment I enter my door
Sometimes I don't even try
'Cause I'm tired of not knowing who I'm doing it for

Honestly, I can't be
All that you want
I'm too little, too much
When a girl is good, she's never good enough
I'm too smart if I think
I'm too drunk if I drink
I'm too boring when I'm sober
I give up

You don't have to stay (you don't have to stay)
You don't have to wait (you don't have to wait)
I will never fit in your mold
If you want you can call
Somebody else (somebody else)
Or do it by yourself (or do it by yourself)
You don't have to stay to be let down
'Cause honestly, honestly

Boys will be boys
But the girls can't be girls
If they are then they are never good enough
A voice is a voice
And it needs to be heard
Now I'm done with holding back
I've had enough
I'm not what you want
I am little and much
When a girl is good, she's always good enough
I am smart if I think
I get drunk if I drink
When a girl is good, she's always good enough
You don't have to stay (you don't have to stay)
You don't have to wait (you don't have to wait)
I will never fit in your mold
If you want you can call
Somebody else (somebody else)
Or do it by yourself (or do it by yourself)
You don't have to stay to be let down
'Cause honestly, honestly

Boys will be boys
But the girls can't be girls
If they are then they are never good enough
A voice is a voice
And it needs to be heard
Now I'm done with holding back
I've had enough
I'm not what you want
I am little and much
When a girl is good, she's always good enough
