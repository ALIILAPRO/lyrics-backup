		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Compton's in the motherfuckin' house look

Now Busta-Bust he like the
David Blane of hip-hop
(Come here just watch)
An X to the Z, I backpack it
Y'all niggas stop (Yo, yo)
We asphalt, not clay, not dust (Yo)
I put my money where my mouth is
Y'all just trust (O oh)
This a real game, motherfuckers
And I'm playing this well (yeah)
I'm an analog, you a hologram
You ain't that real (Yo, yo)
You ain't the truth
You ain't even know how to begin
The real fly game swatter, you can't win
I've been PI since I was knee-high (Yup)
Spending money since 4 years old
Let the truth be told (Yo, yo)
Y'all proof, pull the sunroof
When I bubble, it's an overflow
Left and right wrist like overload
Now I'm 5'4" nigga (Vroom) , double R right
I'm rough on the boulevard
(yeah) , I do it hard (Yo
Yo) even with a hit on my head
I still shine, spit on the red
I'm fly, nigga, 'til I'm bred and I'm dead
Yeah

So tell 'em welcome back to one of these
Niggas know that they fucking
Around with real Gs who you think you are?
Bass heavy all in my truck
That be the gangster shit
I stay banging up in my car
Shot the front nigga
You fuck around and just make a nigga cock
Up and I clap up the broom
Act dumb and you can be one of the young
Niggas that your peeps be
Saying "Die too soon" ayo (Flipmode nigga)

When I step up in the club
Bitches trying to hug me
So sick baby mothers still trying to fuck me
See, we move past diesel like we stocking the
I'm the nicest in this bitch
Swamp cocky as fuck
Fuck rap, a lot of drug money stacking insane
Compton got a couple bricks
From quick and gain
Thought a stomp and couple clicks
To you niggas is lame
Like you could fuck with Aftermath
Bitch I'll weaken your frame
Then I pumped y'all niggas bladder 'til
We watching your piece build
Blood mixture killing niggas at free will
I say thou shit too immoral my brother
Throwing a bachelor party for my
Homie fucking your mother
So married to the game, bitch
Whenever we build
My nigga Game, he like to spaz
I try to tell him to chill fuck you
See my goons will rush your resident fast
No matter how much dough you got
We whip the president ass
Break a bottle, cut your jugular
You niggas is dead

So tell 'em welcome back to one of these
Niggas know that they fucking
Around with real Gs who you think you are?
Bass heavy all in my truck
That be the gangster shit
I stay banging up in my car
Shot the front nigga
You fuck around and just make a nigga cock
Up and I clap up the broom
Act dumb and you can be one of the young
Niggas that your peeps be
Saying "Die too soon" flipmode

I don't do much
Shit on the block in that Lavender Range
For fiends, pass 'em the 'caine
Y'all niggas is lame
Y'all ain't really want beef with The Game
Give 'em 100 thou, easiest pain
But, motherfucker, that ain't your Navy 6
All you do is drive JAY-Z shit
Nigga you ain't hardcore
Nigga you ain't ever won no warzone
You still behind Dame while he
Was thanking the lord you a fad
Nigga you know your rhymes ain't ill
In state property the closest you
Ever been to a mil'
You ain't hot with that wack
Ass album you dropped
The whole Roc know Beans came
And take your spot
You a joke, text right for Russell and Hov
Why you think they keep you around
When you only would go
Yo kid, know who let 'em but the B-I in bitch
Faggot couldn't sell a record with
TI and Trick Daddy
Nigga talk that shit, I crush him
And this ain't nothing to do
With Quik and Busta
