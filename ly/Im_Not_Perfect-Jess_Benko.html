		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm not perfect, but I try, to make your days better than mine
Cause you are worth it
You are perfect
And if you wanna leave me, I understand quite easily
That I'm not worth it
I'm not perfect enough for you

I wake up and I think about you
The things you do, and how you do it that way
I meet you and I see how you'll be, always car wrecked
You are perfect, but when I look into your eyes
I realize it's not the same way you look into mine
So I have to say one last thing
Just please, listen

I'm not perfect, but I try, to make your days better than mine
Cause you are worth it
You are perfect
And if you wanna leave me, I understand quite easily
That I'm not worth it
I'm not perfect enough for you

You always point out my mistakes
The way I break so easily
You always point out my flaws
But I still applause, at everything you do
But when I look into your eyes
I realize it's not the same way you look into mine
So I have to say one last thing
Just please, listen

I'm not perfect, but I try, to make your days better than mine
Cause you are worth it
You are perfect
And if you wanna leave me, I understand quite easily
That I'm not worth it
I'm not perfect enough for you

I'm not perfect, but I try, to make your days better than mine
Cause you are worth it
You are perfect
And if you wanna leave me, I understand quite easily
That I'm not worth it
I'm not perfect enough for you
