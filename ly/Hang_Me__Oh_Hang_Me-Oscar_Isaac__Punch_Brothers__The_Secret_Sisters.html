		<p>
		  Hang me, oh hand me
I'll be dead and gone
Hang me, oh hang me
I'll be dead and gone
Wouldn't mind the hanging
But the layin' in a grave so long, poor boy
I been all around this world

I been all 'round cape Gigardeau
Parts of Arkansas
All around cape Giradeau
Parts of Arkansas
Got so god damn hungry
I could hide behind a straw, poor boy
I been all around this world

Went up on a mountain
There i made my stand
Went up on a mountain
There i made my stand
Rifle on my shoulder
And a dagger in my hand, poor boy
I been all around this world

So hang me, oh hang me
I'll be dead and gone
Hang me, oh hang me
And i'll be dead and gone
I wouldn't mind the hanging
But the layin' in a grave so long, poor boy
I been all around this world

Put the rope around my neck
And hung me up so high
Put the rope around my neck
Hung me up so high
Last words i heard 'em say
Won't be long now for you die, poor boy
I been all around this world

So hang me, oh hang men 
I'll be dead and gone
Hang me, oh hang me
I'll be dead and gone
I wouldn't mind the hanging
But the layin' in a grave, poor boy
I been all around this world
