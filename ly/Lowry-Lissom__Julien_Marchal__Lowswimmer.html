		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It was hours after hours
But I didn't care, you knew
In the Lowry, by the towers
I crept back there for you
I was getting through to him

Loud and clear took the keys to my head
And threw them out
At least then, the beast just slept
Grieving, just like I

There were mountains by the thousand
I would've scaled for you
But it sounded like you were tired
I kept my stare askew
I wasn't getting through to you

How? It was evening i greeted your guеsts
Deceived thеm well
It took teasing to bleed from my chest
But to leave you now
