		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She's so chill
Nuk don shum drama
Engjell, she collects good karma
Zani i saj si simfoni
And she does it effortlessly
She's so calm
Shendrit si hana
Magical, leviz si zana
Might fall for her, nuk e di
Si ekziston mu m'vjen çudi
You can feel her from a distance
You might need to learn how to fly
Before you get on the same vibe
She ain't like nobody else
Didn't believe in her existence
But then I looked into heaven's eyes
Now I'm tryna get on the same vibe
She ain't like nobody else
Aura e saj, so sweet (so, so sweet)
Buzqeshja e saj si drit (ajo shendrit)
Ajo t'don for who you are
She hugs you and you feel so warm
Se ajo e sjell diellin
Po edhe hanen e qiellin
Sa e bukur when she's dancin'
How she moves, so divine, she's one of a kind
You can feel her from a distance
You might need to learn how to fly
Before you get on the same vibe
She ain't like nobody else
Didn't believe in her existence
But then I looked into heaven's eyes
Now I'm tryna get on the same vibe
She ain't like nobody else
She's so chill
Nuk don shum drama
Engjell, she collects good karma
Zani i saj si simfoni
And she does it effortlessly
She's so calm
Shendrit si hana
Magical, leviz si zana
Might fall for her, nuk e di
Si ekziston mu m'vjen çudi
Weren't we made for each other
So fragile, I'll hug you and then after
I'll shower you in kisses filled with laughter
Filled with laughter
Weren't we made for each other
So fragile, I'll hug you and then after
I'll shower you in kisses filled with laughter
Filled with laughter
She's so chill
Nuk don shum drama
Engjell, she collects good karma
Zani i saj si simfoni
And she does it effortlessly
She's so calm
Shendrit si hana
Magical, leviz si zana
Might fall for her, nuk e di
Si ekziston mu m'vjen çudi
