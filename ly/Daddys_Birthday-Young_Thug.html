		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Just a typical day in the 'yo, y'know I'm sayin',now it's fucked, diamonds on me)

Dropped out of school and brought myself a chain
I must've taught myself a million things
I'm out the trap, I can sell anything
I wish I would allow myself to hear this hoe's dream
I pray my daughter never ever experience no train
I told her Colgate, baby you gotta keep your teeth straight

Yeah, bae I'm flexing, extension
Brand new 'Rari, Smith and Wesson
Made myself ballin', want my credit, ya
Speaking of credit, they all owe me, I got credit, yuh
Vroom, V12, y'all ain't ready dog
Trapping beats, I'm like hurry up and buy
Extra draco for my pops, 'cause his birthday 4th of July
I'm so busy, make me feel like I'm in and out my kids' lives

Ooh
(I'm the father of six babies, you know what I'm sayin?)
New coupe, new shoes (new coupe, brand new shoes)
Red bottoms kicking, yeah I'm flossing on your pussy
Cameltoe big, I see the print inside the suit
Rose gold, my jewelry I'm in and out it too
Fuck 'em 'bout it too let them drive it with the few

All this fuckin money, has me switchin' out my boo
I'm livin right and they ain't ever read a book
Chanel vintage, you can put it on the books
The way I whip that body, they charging me with cruelty
Yeah, don't try to stop me, don't you try to knock me
You see me got these crackers in the back
You gotta forgive my heart, I don't mean to stunt like that (I don't mean to do that to you you know'm sayin)

Red bottoms, I'm at Met Gala (I'm 'bout to spaz)
Ain't playin geek, I want every problem (I'm 'bout to spaz)
Two thousand dollars for the newest snake collar
Been a swager, had dollar
Raw clean, Balmain (let's get it)
Vintage swag (vintage hoe), New Celine (just want my glasses)
Hands dirty watch me turn them clean
Li'l shawty hot, kerosene
I'mma kill by any means
Favorite sound, ching ching
I'mma spray a fake with my jeans
I'mma turn up with my team
New condo on seventeen (new condo hoe)
I turn none to something (I turned nothin' to somethin')
AP match my jeans
Converse and McQueen
Pedi for my queen
Gambling, fuck these coins
Mattresses from the swing
Private jet livin' (pussy ass nigga)
I'mma go like beam (I'mma go)
New backwoods no strings
I put ice in my cup
Endo pool, no chlorine

Dropped out of school and brought myself a chain
I must've taught myself a million things
I'm out the trap I can sell anything
I wish I would allow myself to hear this hoe's dream
I pray my daughter never ever experience no train
I told her Colgate, baby you gotta keep your teeth straight

Ooh, ooh, ooh
New coupe, new shoes, ooh
Red bottoms kicking shit, I'm flossing on your pussy
Cameltoe big, I see the print inside the suit
Rose gold, my jewelry I'm in and out it too
Fuck 'em 'bout it too and let them drive it with the few
