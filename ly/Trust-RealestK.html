		<p>
		  Baby
Look me deep, right in my eyes
Tell me the feelings you feel when you're outside
'Cause I've seen it outside once, I see how you feel inside
See it in your pretty eyes

So tell if you feel okay, girl
Tell me if you want me to wait, girl
I can see it on your face, girl
I can see that you're in my place, girl
I told you that I can't catch you on your knees, if you want me to

All I really want is love, is love, is love
All I really want is love, is love, is love
All I really want is trust
Is love
Trust me, yeah, love me again

Wait
What did you want?
Tell me the things that you really cannot go and face
'Cause I don't see what you mean, what you need, close to me
I don't wanna be the one to hold you down
Tell me when you really comin' back in town

All that I got 'cause of you
It comes full circle, anytime I call you, baby
All that I got 'cause of you
It comes full circle, anytime I call you, baby

All I really want is love, is love, is love
All I really want is love, is love, is love
All I really want is trust
Is love
Trust me, yeah, love me again
All I really want is love, is love, is love
All I really want is love, is love, is love
(All I really want is love, oh)
(All I really want is)
