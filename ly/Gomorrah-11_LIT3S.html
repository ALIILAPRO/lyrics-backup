		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm riding the wave through Sodom & Gomorrah, I
I'm riding the wave until the salt burns up my high
But right now
I'm feeding her ego
Moving around
Burning dinheiro
Got this girl on my phone tryna' mess her man around
He's been buying the clothes that I've been stripping down
She's feeling the wave
She's kneeling her way
Down to her favorite place
And I know how you like it
I know how you like it
You like it
So dim them lights down
Even when he's blowing up her phone
Her eyes roll to the north
Her nose in the snow
Girl just hold onto the board
Show me what you know
Show me what you know
When he brings your ego to the floor
I got a bed for you girl
With all the Yay in the world
I got Yay for you girl
We're riding the wave until somebody pulls us down
You shake him for cash I leave you shaking on the ground
Don't think now
Stay up in your ether
Let's go back around
Dig your nails deeper
Lay back in your space
And let me show you what you want
Just don't fall deep, I'm only here to see you come
Out of your mind
I'll be gone in the morning
Out on the grind
Back to Gomorrah
But I know how you like it
I know how you like it
You like it
Dim them lights down
Even when he's blowing up her phone
Her eyes roll to the north
Her nose in the snow
Girl just hold onto the board
Show me what you know
Show me what you know
When he brings your ego to the floor
I got a bed for you girl
With all the Yay in the world
I got Yay for you girl
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
Oh
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no
