		  Check it out
Is it, money and women?
The funny beginnings tragic ending's
I can make a million and still not get enough of spending
And since my life is based on sinning, I'm hell bound
Rather be buried than be worried, living held down
My game plan to be trained in
Military mind of a thug lord sitting in a cemetery cryin'
I've been lost since my adolescence calling for Jesus
Balling as a youngster wondering if he see's us
Young black males
Crack sales got me three strikes
Living in jail this is hell enemies die
Wonder when we all pass, is anybody listening
Got my hands on my semi shotty, everybody's snitching
Please god can you understand me
Bless my family
Guide us all before we fall into insanity
I'm making a point to make my beat bumping raw life
Drop some shit to have these stupid bitches jaws tight
Go, Niggas want to get it on let's fight
I got some niggas in my click
That make them mothafuckas jaws tight
Now
Go, Niggas want to get it on let's fight
I got some niggas in my click
That make them mothafuckas jaws tight
Go, Niggas want to get it on let's fight
I got some niggas in my click
That make them mothafuckas jaws tight
Now
Go, Niggas want to get it on let's fight
I got some niggas in my click
That make them mothafuckas jaws tight
