		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Said it ain't what you do cuz, woo hey
(Everybody knows what's up 'cause everybody wanna get next to me)
So if you knew what I do, she'll be yours tonight, yeah (ooh oh oh)
Imagine she came here to get away (get away)
Well she don't want nobody crowding her space
Wouldn't that be weird? Aw yeah (woo)
Ooh, she was up tonight to get down
But she don't wanna be a part of the crowd (uh-uh)
Wouldn't that be weird? Aw yeah

I'm so confused, if you only knew, she came to give it to you

It ain't what you do, it's what you do tonight (woo)
And there ain't no shortcut to doing something right
If you knew what I knew, she'll be yours tonight (woo)
Just look around the club cuz, you're here to have a good time (ooh oh oh)

So many benefits to being quiet, just be cool, enjoy the ride
'Cause all she really wanna do is, wouldn't that be weird? Yeah (ooh oh oh)
Don't be stingy with it, pass the J, let her hit it if it's heading her way
Ooh, my nigga that's weird (you don't let her hit it, you don't let her get it)

I'm so confused, if you only knew she came to give it to you

It ain't what you do, it's what you do tonight (woo)
And there ain't no shortcut to doing something right
If you knew what I knew, she'll be yours tonight
Just look around the club cuz, you're here to have a good time

I'm so confused, if you only knew she came to give it to you

Yo, he want the flirty girl, I'm the girly girl
You know who, get the worm is the early bird
Flow, slicker than MJ, early curl
I got to clip these niggas like Sterly Sterl
I seen him in the club he could get the cub
I ain't talking 'bout baseball but go get the glove
Don't be like OJ and forget your glove
I'm tryna get faded, nigga go and get the drugs (the drugs)
Five plus five what they call that? Ten
Out in Japan we be counting that Yen
Ladies who you trying popping with? Men
No little boys in the circle of Usher
Got'em under pressure
When your girl come through, Nicki gone crush her
And tell your man play the back like a spine
He only last six seconds like a Vine

I'm so confused, if you only knew she came to give it to you

It ain't what you do, it's what you do tonight (woo)
And there ain't no shortcut to doing something right
If you knew what I knew, she'll be yours tonight
Just look around the club cuz, you're here to have a good time

Come on, just start something, you gone get it (she's trying to give it you)
Just start something, gone get it, gone get it (she's trying to give it you)
Just start something, gone get it, gone get it (come on, she's trying to give it you)
Just start something, you gone get it, gone get it (come on, she's trying to give it you)
Yeah, come on, come on (you gone get it, all she really wanna do is get it)
Come on, uh huh, yo, yo (woo) (you gone get it, all she really wanna do is get it)

I'm Nicki M and he is Usher
All these niggas be tryna cuff her (you gone get it, all she really wanna do is get it)
What you know about that Swiffer duster? (you gone get it, all she really wanna do is get it)
Until next time you motherfucker hahaha (you gone get it, all she really wanna do is get it)
