		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In my mask watch me whip and dash
You cannot surpass it's the hash
Slanging and I slash welcome to the past
To the match groupies at the door
Who be at ya show no one knows
All the things I know except you gotta go

Eskimo when I kill the seal
Kyuubi out the field
Every note that I make is real
Murder rob and kill can't find my tracks
But I'm in the back yo bitch on my lap
She cap fo cap
Lyin to yo face so that I can smash her

She dropping her knees faster
She knows that I'm yo captor
If you wanna brawl I'll knock yo
Head off like a kappa
Take yo throne to front row
You've lost yo mind yo control
The rays gon shower lead
And burn all those who cannot uphold

Made in the fire with the high tide
Puttin my time in divine, make it tye dye
Stirring my life in the
Bank from the pipeline
Getting my sight open to the
Very thing that broke
Me and my effigy and bones
Got the godhand on my side on my throne
Now I can take it and shape
It and break what I've hated
Not jaded, elated invading ya home

In my mask watch me whip and dash
You cannot surpass it's the hash
Slanging and I slash welcome to the past
To the match groupies at the door
Who be at ya show no one knows
All the things I know except you gotta go

I got my ana and I got my shiv
And I got that damage with only one click
Got my boot with the blade
Know I'm coming with the kick
Gonna knock yo head off
To the floor like bricks
Now I'm off breaking bread with
Yo one true hoe
And I'm getting that head and
I'm getting that row
And I'm getting all that money
But I'm keeping my soul
Keep it low like a crow like Lee when I go
