		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Late night, waiting by the phone
Tonight waiting for an answer
Heartbeat drumming double time
I need one more chance to be near you

Still hanging on
(For what)
Can't operate
(Fired up)

I won't eat and I won't sleep for you, yeah
No rest till I
(Get through)
'Cause I'm holding out
(For you)
Am I the only one who's insane?

Hey, you're playing with my delirium
And the longer I wait the harder I'm gonna fall
Stop playing with my delirium
'Cause I'm outta my head and outta my self-control

Still here in this quiet room
Deep in delusion sending me over
Outside watch the world go by
Inside time stands still as I wonder

Still hanging on
(For what?)
Can't operate
(Fired up)

I won't eat and I won't sleep for you, yeah
No rest till I
(Get through)
'Cause I'm holding out
(For you)
Am I the only one who's insane

Hey, you're playing with my delirium
And the longer I wait the harder I'm gonna fall
Stop playing with my delirium
'Cause I'm outta my head and outta my self-control
(I won't eat and I won't sleep for you, yeah)

Hey, you're playing with my delirium
And the longer I wait the harder I'm gonna fall
Stop playing with my delirium
'Cause I'm outta my head and outta my self-control

Hey, you're playing with my delirium
And the longer I wait the harder I'm gonna fall
Stop playing with my delirium
'Cause I'm outta my head and outta my self-control
