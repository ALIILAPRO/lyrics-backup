		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The other day I came across
Someone I knew and he was lost
I don't care what we have done
You never will believe it
It's a life that's made for me
Where I can be completely free
So long as I obey this sound
That echoes all around
Just like the ocean or the sea
Just like the blood that burns in me
Someone like you cannot be free
Just like a lock without a key
Just like the ocean or the sea
Just like the blood that burns in me
Someone like you cannot be free
Just like a lock without a key

Just like the ocean or the sea
Just like the blood that burns in me
Someone like you cannot be free
Just like a lock without a key
Just like the ocean or the sea
Just like the blood that burns in me
Someone like you cannot be free
Just like a lock without a key

So, I thought this cannot be
There's someone else in here with me
I don't care where we have been
You never will believe it
I know you and you know me
And we're as happy as we can be
I know where this world belongs
It don't mean much to me
Just like the ocean or the sea
Just like the blood that burns in me
Someone like you cannot be free
Just like a lock without a key
