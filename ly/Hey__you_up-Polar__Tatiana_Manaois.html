		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey, you up?
I know it's been a while but I've been
So caught up
Pretending to be fine
But I'm jaded
Fucked up sleep
Can't get no rest
Why's it so hard to accept
That you're still stuck in my head

Do you still think of me
Like I do think of you
All my friend yeah they know
But you don't
And I keep coming back to
A point where I'm over you
In the next breath I want you to come through

Hey, you up?
I know it's been to long
Since we last kept in touch
But I've been wondering for some time
That maybe you and I
We missed our chance
To feel a perfect love romance
When you hold me
I wonder if you chose me
Would it be so good?

Do you still think of me
Like I do think of you
All my friend yeah they know
But I don't tell them I
keep coming back to
A point where I'm over you
In the next breath I want you to come through

Do you think of me, think of me
Like I think of you, think of you
Can't get you off my mind
So I hit you up like
Hey, you up?
I know it's been a while but I've been
So caught up
Pretending to be fine
But I'm jaded

Do you still think of me
Like I do think of you
All my friend yeah they know
But you don't
And I keep coming back to
A point where I'm over you
In the next breath I want you to come through
