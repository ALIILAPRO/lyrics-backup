		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you say my eyes are beautiful
It's because they're looking at you
And if you could only see yourself
You'd feel the same way too

You could say that I am a dreamer
Who's had a dream come true
If you say my eyes are beautiful
It's because they're looking at you

Ooh
If you wonder why I'm smiling
It's because I'm happy with you
And the warm sensations touch my heart
And fill me through and through

I could hold you close forever
And never let you go
If you say my eyes are beautiful
It's because I just love you so

Oh
Now my heart is an open door
Won't you come inside for more?
You can love so sweetly now
Take my love, take me completely now

Oh
If you say my eyes are beautiful
It's because they're looking at you
And my eyes adjust the window
For my feelings to come through

And by far, you are more beautiful
Than anything I ever knew
If you say my eyes are beautiful
If you say my eyes are beautiful
If you say my eyes, my eyes are beautiful
It's because (it's because)
They're looking at you
