		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This isn't the same song that you're used to hearing tonight
You're in for a shock if you came for a sweet lullaby
No this is something sinister, aimed right at your heart
Thumping faster to the beat, playing in the dark
A nonapologetic, mangled web of souls and parts
We are, who we are

We know what scares you when you're awake
We see your eyes going wide when we meet face to face
And in the night time, when you're asleep
We're never too far behind into your nightmares we seep
We know what scares you oh whoa
We know what scares you inside
Here in the shadows it's all we have
So you can run you can hide but your fear it is ours for tonight

When you're forced to live in a mask for the rest of your years
You pick up a thing or two about bone-chilling fear
And we just wanna share with you everything we learned
All the pain and suffering, tenfold in return
We're not gonna lie to you, this is gonna hurt
'Cause now it's your turn

We know what scares you when you're awake
We see your eyes going wide when we meet face to face
And in the night time, when you're asleep
We're never too far behind into your nightmares we seep
We know what scares you oh whoa
We know what scares you inside
Here in the shadows it's all we have
So you can run you can hide but your fear it is ours for tonight

(This isn't the same song that you're used to hearing tonight)
Yeah you can run but we know
Yeah you can hide but we always know

We know what scares you when you're awake
We see your eyes going wide when we meet face to face
And in the night time, when you're asleep
We're never too far behind into your nightmares we seep
We know what scares you oh whoa
We know what scares you inside
Here in the shadows it's all we have
So you can run you can hide but your fear it is ours for tonight

Oh whoa
We know what scares you
Oh whoa
We know what scares you
