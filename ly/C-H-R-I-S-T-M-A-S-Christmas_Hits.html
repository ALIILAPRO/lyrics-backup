		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I was but a youngster, Christmas meant one thing
That I'd be getting lots of toys that day
Then one cold December, my mama sat me down
And taught me to spell Christmas this way

C is for the Christ Child born upon this day
H for Herald Angels in the night
R means our Redeemer
I means Israel, and
S is for the star that shone so bright
T is for three wise men, they who traveled far
M is for the manger where he lay
A's for all he stands for 
S means shepherds came
And that's why there's a Christmas Day

A's for all he stands for 
S means shepherds came
And that's why there's a Christmas Day
And that's why there's a Christmas Day
