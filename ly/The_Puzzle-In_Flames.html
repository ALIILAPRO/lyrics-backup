		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let us try to think, try to paint the picture. 

Living on, have to feel this way. 

(Looking for something to believe in) 

Looking for something to believe in, 
I think I've done my time. (My time) 

One by one the pieces fall, 
Tell me what it is to believe. 

You can tell, changed by their faces. 
There are always signs! 
I am just still to the puzzle, 
Grab a piece of light! 

Give me tending, I can't handle everything, 
You'll never understand me. (Light) 

And I don't care what you think, (Light) 
Or maybe I do!

(One by one the pieces fall) 
One by one the pieces fall! 
Tell me what it feels to believe! 

You can tell, changed by their faces. 
There are always signs! 
I am just still to the puzzle, 
Grab a piece of light! 

Grab a piece of light!(Light) 

You can tell, changed by their faces. 
There are always signs! 
I am just still to the puzzle, 
Grab a piece of light! 

You can tell, changed by their faces. 
There are always signs! 
I am just still to the puzzle, 
Grab a piece of light! (Light)
