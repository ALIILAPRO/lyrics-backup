		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you've ever been in love
Or ever hope to be in love
Here's a story you'll love with all your heart

Couples on their backs in the park
Lay on blankets bought
On a date the day before
A routine I've been longing for
Can't help but to glance
From the corner of my resentful eyes
Guess it's all perspective but
It's you I never get enough
We're always far apart

We've got a vicious love
We mix our tears with blood
No clock will stop for us
It ticks by
We fight as hard as we love
We've got a vicious love

When I go out alone
And see them sharing meals
Like Lady and the Tramp
Hate their loving eyes
Wishing it was you and I
Add tip to my receipt
Fold it up behind a picture of us
Guess it's all perspective but
Together though we rarely touch
Hard not to fall apart

We've got a vicious love
We mix our tears with blood
No clock will stop for us
It ticks by
We fight as hard as we love
We've got a vicious love

I could have given up a thousand times
In the past that was so easy
When the thought came to my mind
There was no convincing me
Plant my feet to face it all
Side by side or a phone call
Living in tension with you
Still feels better
Better than I've ever known

We've got a vicious love
We mix our tears with blood (we mix our tears with blood)
No clock will stop for us
It ticks by
We fight as hard as we love

We've got a vicious love (we've got a vicious love)
We mix our tears with blood (we've got a vicious love)
No clock will stop for us
It ticks by
We fight as hard as we love
We've got a vicious love
