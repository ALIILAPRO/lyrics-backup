		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Shine, shine on me
Shine, shine on me
Shine, shine on me
Shine, shine on me

Can't you see it's all your future
feelings have to be pushed away
can't you see it's just a feeling
Shine, shine on me

See me walking, see me crawling
See my future, see a dead man
See me walking, see me crawling
Shine, shine on me

Shine, shine on me
Shine, shine on me
Shine, shine on me
Shine, shine on me
