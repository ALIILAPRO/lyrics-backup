		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sitting on an angry chair
Angry walls that steal the air
Stomach hurts and I don't care
What do I see across the way, hey?
See myself molded in clay, oh
Stares at me, yeah, I'm afraid
Changing the shape of his face, oh yeah

Candles red, I have a pair
Shadows dancing everywhere
Burning on the angry chair
Little boy made a mistake, yeah
Pink cloud has now turned to gray, oh
All that I want is to play, hey
Get on your knees, time to pray, oh

I don't mind, yeah
I don't mind, I-I-I
I don't mind, yeah
I don't mind, I-I-I

Lost my mind, yeah
But I don't mind, I-I-I
Can't find it anywhere
I don't mind, I-I-I

Corporate prison, we stay, yeah
I'm a dull boy, work all day
So I'm strung out anyway, hey

Loneliness is not a phase
Field of pain is where I graze
Serenity is far away
Saw my reflection and cried
So little hope that I died, oh
Feed me your lies, open wide, hey
Weight of my heart, not the size, oh

I don't mind, yeah
I don't mind, I-I-I
I don't mind, yeah
I don't mind, I-I-I

Lost my mind, yeah
But I don't mind, I-I-I
Can't find it anywhere
I don't mind, I-I-I

Pink cloud has now turned to gray
All that I want is to play
Get on your knees, time to pray, boy
