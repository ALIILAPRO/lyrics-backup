		  [Mark:]
Baby, tell me, are we heading into trouble, yeah
Is it my imagine taking whole 
Do I read to much into the way we slay 
The way you move away from me
I may feel that you're the one 
But when all is said and done

[All:]
Love takes two
Time after time we've talked it through
'cause baby, I need you
What am I supposed to do

[Mark:]
Love takes two

[Shane:]
There's a whole lot of things you can do and do without me, yeah
There's a million things I can do and do alone
But the best you can do for yourself 
Is sharing with that someone else
No one wants to be alone
It's the one thing that I know

[All:]
Love takes two
Time after time we've talked it through
'cause baby, I need you
What am I supposed to do

[Mark:]
When your words could disguise what you're going through
But they can't fool your heart
Now it's time to decide what you want to do
I'm telling you

[All:]
Love takes two
[Mark:]
Love takes two
[All:]
Time after time it's proven true
'cause baby, I need you 
What am I supposed to do

[Mark:]
Love takes two
[All:]
Love takes two
[Mark:]
Love takes two
How can you
What am I gonna do about you, hey baby
[All:]
And I need you
[Mark:]
When you know that, I want it so bad
It's enough, girl to drive you crazy 'cause

[All:]
Love takes two
[Mark:]
Love takes two
How can you
What am I gonna do about you, baby
[All:]
And I need you
[Mark:]
When I know that, I want it so bad
It's enough, girl to drive you crazy 'cause

[Mark:]
Love takes two
