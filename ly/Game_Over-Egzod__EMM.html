		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Make way when I'm walking, pray when I'm talking it's to you
Fight for my attention, for your ascension you must prove
'Cause if you can find it, you don't confine it you let it move
Make way for the genie, scream for the dream me coming through

Have you ever played with a queen?
I can show you what I mean
I can make you feel free
I got you and you'll never leave

Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Can you meet me on my level?
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Or baby, is your reign over?
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Can you battle with the devil?
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Or baby, is it game over?

Game over
Game over

Have you ever played with a queen?
I can show you what I mean

I want your devotion, all your emotions in my hand
I want your obsession, every affection full command
And if you defy me, you won't survive me, you'll be damned
'Cause I am the giant, I am the diamond not a man

Have you ever played with a queen?
I can show you what I mean
I can make you feel free
I got you and you'll never leave

Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Can you meet me on my level?
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Or baby, is your reign over?
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Can you battle with the devil?
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Or baby, is it game over?

Game over
Game over

Have you ever played with a queen?
Not 'till you met me
