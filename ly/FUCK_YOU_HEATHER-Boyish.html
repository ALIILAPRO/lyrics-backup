		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Kinda melt in the summer
'Cause this heat keeps us wrapped up inside
Breaking out in summer
Breaking up just to feel alive
Now I don't even know you
Lost your name in a shit storm I caused
Ran away to annoy you
Drank too much, threw it up and got lost
Never knew that you missed me
Only thought that you wanted to move on
What the hell were you thinking?
Why the hell did it take so long?
We could be friends
We could be friends
Why aren't we friends?
We grew up too slowly
Love each other, trust each other, that's bullshit
Just to talk about the weather
Got nothing to say, so fuck you heather
Never knew that you missed me
Only thought that you wanted to move on
What the hell were you thinking?
Why the hell did it take so long?
FUCK YOU HEATHER!
