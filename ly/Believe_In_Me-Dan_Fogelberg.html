		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I could ever say it right 
And reach your hostage heart despite 
The doubts you harbor then you might 
Come to believe in me 

The life I lead is not the kind 
That gives a woman peace of mind 
I only hope someday you'll find 
That you can believe in me 

Those other loves that came before 
Mean nothing to me anymore 
But you can never be quite sure 
And will not believe in me 

Too many hearts have been broken 
Failing to trust what they feel 
But trust isn't something that's spoken 
And love's never wrong when it's real 

If I could only do one thing 
Then I would try to write and sing 
A song that ends your questioning 
And makes you believe in me 

And makes you believe in me 
Oh, you can believe in me
