		  (Great John on the beat, by the way)
Look

I'm tryna run it up with you (mmm)
She say, "I just wanna run it up with you" (yeah)
She say, "I could be your Bonnie and you be Clyde" (huh)
Tell me what it cost just to see you smile? (Huh)
I know that they hate it how we run it up (huh)
Know I keep it real bae, you know I keep it one hunnid
It be me and you, let's make a one of us (huh)
Only me and you, baby, we could make a one of us
I ain't tryna play around with you, babe
Told her, I ain't tryna play around with her (mmm)
Only way is up, limit is the sky (huh)
Let me run the score up, nigga, where's the nine?

I ain't tryna play, I fuck with you, look
Like these jeans I got on, she's a one of one
Different revenues, they asking where it's coming from
And you know I'm from New York, I got a hundred guns
(You know how we coming) You know how we rollin' (How we rollin')
Bought her ass a Patek, she wanted the Rollie (Uh)
Give it to me like you owe it
Do a buck-eighty in a Urus, drive it like it's stolen (Look)
She ain't mine if she friendly (Hah)
I told her that's okay 'cause we got dimes, we got Bentleys
We got nines in our Bentleys
Had a knife in my back when I wrote my first song
Put a knife to your face like a dollar and fifty (woo)

I'm tryna run it up with you (mmm)
She say, "I just wanna run it up with you" (yeah)
She say, "I could be your Bonnie and you be Clyde" (huh)
Tell me what it cost just to see you smile? (Huh)
I know that they hate it how we run it up (huh)
Know I keep it real bae, you know I keep it one hunnid
It be me and you, let's make a one of us (huh)
Only me and you, baby, we could make a one of us
I ain't tryna play around with you, babe
Told her, I ain't tryna play around with her (mmm)
Only way is up, limit is the sky (huh)
Let me run the score up, nigga, where's the nine?

You think I'm stuck up in my ways, huh? (Ways, huh?)
I swear I would've bought your love
But something told me to save up
Baddies come in flavors (flavors)
But every time I pick the same one, ballin' 'til the game done
Shooters with me A1, she just wanna run it up
Told her we got guns with us
We used to walk in the rain, there ain't no sun in us
The money make people change, you stayed the same, hun
Told her if she play it then the game done (Game done)
Fell apart, now picture that, I fixed the frame up
Took some Ls, we getting back, that shit ain't change us
Lose it all, I'm still the same, that's how we came up (huh)

I'm tryna run it up with you
She say, "I just wanna run it up with you"
She say, "I could be your Bonnie and you be Clyde" (huh)
Tell me what it cost just to see you smile? (Huh)
I know that they hate it how we run it up (huh)
Know I keep it real bae, you know I keep it one hunnid
It be me and you, let's make a one of us (huh)
Only me and you, baby, we could make a one of us
I ain't tryna play around with you, babe
Told her, I ain't tryna play around with her (mmm)
Only way is up, limit is the sky (huh)
Let me run the score up, nigga, where's the nine?
