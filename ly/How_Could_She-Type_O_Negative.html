		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wilma Flintstone, Marcia Brady
Alice Kramden, Gladys Kravitz
Laverne and Shirley, Jeannie

Morticia Adams, Aunt Esther
Sweet Polly Purebred, Natasha
Mrs. McGillicuddy

How could she?

Ginger, Mary Ann, Mrs. Howell
Samantha Stevens, Lieutenant Uhura
Judy Jetson

Olive Oyl, Ethel Mertz
Edith Bunker, Marilyn Munster
Rhoda, Penny Robinson

How could she?
Why (why)
Why, why don't you love me anymore?
I said why
Why, why don't you love me anymore?

Quite upset, angry, just plain annoyed
No recourse except for celluloid
In my heart, I know you are not real
Though in mind, suspect you still can feel

Walt Disney or Hanna-Barbera
Black or white, stunning Technicolor
Warner Brothers and the A.A.p.
I've become addicted to TV

Crissy Snow, Catwoman
Creepela, Weezie Jefferson
Betty Rubble, Little Cindy Who

Penelope Pitstop, Lois Lane
Vanna White, Wonder Woman
Elly May, Maude, Witchiepoo

How could she?
Why (why)
Why, why don't you love me anymore?
I said why
Why, why don't you love me anymore?
Why (why)
Why, why don't you love me anymore?
I said why
Why, why don't you love me anymore?

How could you?
How could you?
How could you?
How could you?
