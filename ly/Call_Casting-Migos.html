		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Buddah blessed this beat
Yeah, trap shit
No, no, no, no, no, no

Up early in the morning, trapping (trap, trap)
You can get 'em while you asking (ask)
How many chickens?
You can get 'em whichever way
Nigga, trap turned Zaxby's (Zax)
I beat the pot with a passion (beat it up)
A hundred acres on the mansion (mansion)
I dab in the latest fashion (eat it up)
Bitches need to call casting (yeah)

Act (Act)
Put the backends in the back (back)
Draco on me, it's attached (attached)
Name a nigga with the pack (pack)
Name a nigga with the sack (sack)
I love my Glock, I got the MAC (MAC)
She eat the molly like a snack (eat it up)
This gold on my neck a plaque (plaque)
Bando Shane's Rib Shack (eat it up)
Rob the plug if you tax (tax)
Sip the lean and relax (drink it up)
Park the Lamb in the back (skrt, skrt)
Big dog, you a cat (cat)
Rich in the matte black (skrt, skrt)
Twenty hoes to be exact (yeah)
I need ten, that's a dime
Want a nickel, that's a five
One to fly, one to slide
One to glide, ain't got time
Poured a thirty on my nine
For a nigga out of line
Mama cryin', niggas dyin'
Wonder why I done grip the fire, yeah

Up early in the morning, trapping (trap, trap)
You can get 'em while you asking (ask)
How many chickens?
You can get 'em whichever way
Nigga, trap turned Zaxby's (Zax)
I beat the pot with a passion (beat it up)
A hundred acres on the mansion (mansion)
I dab in the latest fashion (eat it up)
Bitches need to call casting (yeah)

Brrrt (skrt skrt skrt skrt) burrr, pot
Niggas tried to send the thot
That's the only way to plot
Klay Thomp, corner shot (brrr)
Eight-ball, corner pocket (ay)
White boys in the game (white)
Call 'em Andy Milonakis (yeah)
He won't hesitate to shoot 'em (shoot)
Private jet to Bermuda (woo)
I knew I been had sauce (who)
'Cause I was fuckin' on my tutor (who)
Truck backin' up the dooley
A hundred pounds out the cooler
Came from a Cup O' Noodles
I fucked the game, Karma Sutra
I got M's on my mind
I got boulders in my time
Put a model bitch on coco
Told her read between the lines (coco)
J's out there snitchin', yeah
Heard it through the vine (J's)
Packin' up the kitchen
Think I ran out of time, yeah

Up early in the morning, trapping (trap, trap)
You can get 'em while you asking (ask)
How many chickens?
You can get 'em whichever way
Nigga, trap turned Zaxby's (Zax)
I beat the pot with a passion (beat it up)
A hundred acres on the mansion (mansion)
I dab in the latest fashion (eat it up)
Bitches need to call casting (yeah)

Woo woo woo woo woo, packs
I paid the ticket, get you whacked (brrr)
I chop the brick with the axe (hey)
The cookie smellin' like a casket (cookie)
I'm sellin' crack in my Raf's (crack)
Put the addy in the nav (addy)
He steady poppin', know it's cap (cap)
I hit the jungle then adapt
30 thousand on the couch (30 bars)
All my bitches from an app (app)
Instagram and the Snap (Snap)
I bet a hundred on the craps (crap)
I'm good on shawty, do without
She fucking niggas for the check (check)
I'mma only get the mouth
Hop out a Lambo, crossover on a bitch
I poured a four, Actavis
Walk in Goyard, got a bag for my bitch
Won't get a kiss 'cause I know you suck dick
Spent you hundred, Philippe on your wrist (Patek)
Twenty-five pointers, one fist (points)
Twenty-five bitches on list (twenty-five)
Kill ten, rubber band grip (brrr)

Up early in the morning, trapping (trap, trap)
You can get 'em while you asking (ask)
How many chickens?
You can get 'em whichever way
Nigga, trap turned Zaxby's (Zax)
I beat the pot with a passion (beat it up)
A hundred acres on the mansion (mansion)
I dab in the latest fashion (eat it up)
Bitches need to call casting (yeah)
