		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My feet are sticking on the floor
And I can see you watching
Your eyes are saying you want more
But I'm just here for that one thing
I hear you shouting in my ear
But I can only taste you
Smile and nod like I can hear
But I'll know I'll leave with you

Come back
Later on

Touch me (touch me)
I want you only with the lights out
Want me (want me)
I want you only with the lights out

Oooo ooooo
Oooo ooooo

My head is pounding like it should
Not sure why you're still with me
Let's say that this was just good
And you can love and leave me

Come back
Later on

Touch me (touch me)
I want you only with the lights out
Want me (want me)
I want you only with the lights out
Touch me (touch me)
I want you only with the lights out
Want me (want me)
I want you only with the lights out

Oooo oooo
Oooo oooo
Oooo oooo
Oooo oooo
Oooo lights out
Oooo want me
Oooo lights out
Oooooo want me

Come back
Later on
Come back
LATER ON

TOUCH ME!!!!!!
I want you only with the lights out
Want me (want me)
I want you only with the lights out
Touch me (touch me)
I want you only with the lights out
Want me (want me)
I want you only with the lights out
