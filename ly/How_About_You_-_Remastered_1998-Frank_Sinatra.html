		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I like New York in June, how about you?
I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due
I like potato chips, moonlight
Motor trips, how about you?

I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill
And Franklin Roosevelt looks give me a thrill
Holding hands in the movie show
When all the lights are low may not be new
But I like it, how about you?
