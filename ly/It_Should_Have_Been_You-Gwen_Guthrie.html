		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It should have been you
It could have been you
It should have been you
It could have been you

When we first got together
We thought our love would stand the test
Waited oh, so long
Couldn't settle for second best
No one else could make me feel the way you do
Broke my heart in two
When you said our love was through

It should have been you
It could have been you
It should have been you
It could have been you

Through pain, tears and heartache
We see our love can't last
It's time for new beginnings
Can't live in the past
With my back to the wind
I face a new horizon
Believe me when I say that it's true
Even though our love is through

It should have been you
It could have been you
It should have been you
It could have been you

It should have been you
It could have been you
It should have been you
It could have been you

It should have been you
It could have been you
It should have been you
It could have been you

It should have been you
I been searchin' such a long time
It could have been you
Wonder will I'll ever find
It should have been you
A man so warm and true
It could have been you
Who loves me like you used to do
It should have been you

It could have been you
It should have been you
It could have been you

It should have been you
It could have been you
It should have been you

'Cause elieve me when I say that it's true
Even though our love is through

It should have been you
It could have been you
It should have been you, it should have you
