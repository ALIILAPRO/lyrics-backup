		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm a pimp, under pressure but it's necessary
Treat a bad bitch better than a veterinary
Never treat her secondary sweet as February
I can turn the best into adversary
I tried, no really, really I tried
Although I'm really, really up, I'm
Still gonna give you all my downtime
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I, I, got a lot on my mind
Tell my slime don't be surprised if I cry, I cry
He said, "why?" I said, "why?"
He said, "damn, my nigga, nevermind", oh no
That's why I just get high
I like wonderin' why does time go by? Go, go
Is this love, is it lust, is it drugs?
All I know is I tried
Is this love, is this lust, is it drugs?
All I know is I tried
Thought I was done tryna love
I guess I love tryna love

Hey
Not so careful but today I just don't care
Dye my hair
We so faded, we can't make it up my stairs
We fuck right there
Not so lucky but tonight I just crapped out
Vegas sucks, I'm still gambling with her, no protection
Protect what?
'Cause I mean, I'm the one she sells her soul to
That's because she knows I don't buy dreams
I'm the one, she comes and goes
But whatever, who knows? Nigga, not me
I'm the one she does the most, when she do the most
At least, the most, at least
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm a pimp, under pressure but it's necessary
Treat a bad bitch better than a veterinary
Eat a bad bitch unless she got that hairy, hairy
I could take her ex out of her vocabulary

I, yeah, got a lot on my mind
Tell my slime don't be surprised if I cry, I cry
He said, "why?" I said, "why?"
He said, "damn, my nigga, nevermind," oh no
That's why I just get high
I like wonderin' why does time go by? Go, go
Is this love, is it lust, is it drugs?
All I know is I tried
No really, really, I tried
Although I'm really, really up
I'm still gonna give you all my downtime
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

We ain't no junkies but today we'd like some white
Whatever we like she don't judge me
Though I may need her to be the one to give me life
'Cause I mean, I'm the one she sells her soul to
That's because she knows, I don't buy dreams
I'm the one, she comes and goes
But whatever, who knows? Not me
I'm the one she does the most, when she do the most
At least, the most, at least

I, I, got a lot on my mind
Tell my slime don't be surprised if I cry, I cry
He said, "why?" I said, "why?"
He said, "damn, my nigga, nevermind"
