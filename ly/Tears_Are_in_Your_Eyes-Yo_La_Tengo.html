		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You tell me summer's here
And the time is wrong
You tell me winter's here and your days...
Are getting long

Tears are in your eyes... tonight
You tell me that you haven't
Slept in days
You tell me sleeping only makes you tired...
Anyway

Tears are in your eyes... tonight
Tears are in your eyes... every night

Although you don't believe me you're strong
Darkness always turns into the dawn
And you won't even remember this for long...
When it ends alright

Please tell me how...you know tomorrow...staring at your shoes
Tears are in your eyes...every night
Tears are in your eyes...every night
Tears are in your eyes...tonight
