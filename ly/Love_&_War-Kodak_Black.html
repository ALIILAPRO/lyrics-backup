		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (J Gramm on the beat)
Big ol' strap like I'ma Haitian
Pompano Puff, my blower sprayin'

Could you send me a flick? I'ma send you a dick pic when I'm horny
If I kiss you on yo' lips, would you tell your sisters in the mornin'?
Would you keep it a secret? Like, I ain't felt this way before
Wanna tell you that I like you, but I don't, 'cause I'm not sure
I just take her heart and score, then I love her 'til she sore
I just break her heart in fours, then I don't want her anymore
If I eat it, could I treat it? Could I beat it with my sword?
She want love and I want war

You could leave, but where you goin'?
If I hit that thing the right way can I take you to my prom?
Wanna strap you 'round to my waist and come take you to my mom
Do you get that picture? You could be lil' Kodak
You don't get the picture, girl, I'm lil' Kodak
You could be my Cheri, you could be my baby
If you lookin' for me, I be right on 18
Droppin' bands, I be poppin' bands
Poppin' Xans will make you pop your man
Park it, man, it's way too hot to dance
If you lookin' for me, I be right on 18
Droppin' bands, I be poppin' bands
Poppin' Xans will make you pop your man
Park it, man, it's way too hot to dance
If you lookin' for me, I be right on 18
Droppin' bands, I be poppin' bands

Could you send me a flick? I'ma send you a dick pic when I'm horny
If I kiss you on yo' lips, would you tell your sisters in the mornin'?
Would you keep it a secret? Like, I ain't felt this way before
Wanna tell you that I like you, but I don't, 'cause I'm not sure

I just break her heart in fours, then I don't want her anymore
