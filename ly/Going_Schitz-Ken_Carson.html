		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Loesoe going crazy)

yeah, lil' shawty she off the acid, yeah, lil' shawty goin skitz
I took her to my room and fucked the fuck out that bitch
Better not bring yo' ho round' me cause' I'ma fuck the fuck out that bitch
Just keep it on the low, just keep it to yourself
Hell nah, she don't want no racks from me, she just want what's under my belt
Hell nah I ain't fall in love but I love how lil' shawty fuck off the pill
And lil' shawty the best, she got skill
But hell nah she ain't cookin' no meals
I'm fuckin' with her and she fuckin' with me 
yeah, we got time to kill
I bust down my watch now I can't tell
What time it is
Is it a quarter to nine?
That's when yo' ho callin' my line
Ain't trippin', lil' shawty not mine
lil' shawty not mine, I'm not trippin'

I got a pool in my backyard, shawty said she into skinny dippin'
I got a pool in backyard, hell yeah, that's just how I'm livin'
I just threw a party and I had a packed yard
hell yeah, everybody attended
Hell yeah, everybody was sinnin'
See me I was just mindin' my business
I see these niggas, yeah, they in they feelings
I fuck on yo' bitch and go ran it up
Push up wit' that stick, push up wit' dat dub
Niggas askin' me if I'ma hit, I'm like duh
Look at my swag, I'm fresh just like dove
And my bitch hot, she straight out the oven
I just wanna eat her out, like a muffin
And then sing to her, David Ruffin
These niggas be claimin they gangstas 
but really they wankstas, these niggas be bluffin'
I'm in New York wit' a banger, yeah, I got a cutter you know I be cuttin'
And don't give a fuck about shit
I finesse my auntie and shoot at my cousin
And you better not bring that bitch around me 
cause' you know I'ma fuck her, you know how I does it
If I like that bitch, give a fuck who she wit'
I'ma take her down, it ain't nothin'

If I like that bitch, give a fuck who she wit'
I'ma take her down, it ain't nothin'
If I like that bitch, give a fuck who she wit'
I'ma take her down, it ain't nothin'

yeah, lil' shawty she off the acid, yeah, lil' shawty goin skitz
I took her to my room and fucked the fuck out that bitch
Better not bring yo' ho round' me cause' I'ma fuck the fuck out that bitch
Just keep it on the low, just keep it to yourself
