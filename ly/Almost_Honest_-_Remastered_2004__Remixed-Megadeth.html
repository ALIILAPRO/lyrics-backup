		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I lied just a little 
When I said I need you 
You stretched the truth 
When you said that you knew 
Just can't believe it 
There's nothing to say 
I was almost honest, almost 
Living alone, can't stand this place 
It's four in the morning and I still see your face 
I was nearly pure 
When I said I loved you 
You were semi-sincere 
You said I'd bleed for you 
We were kind of candid 
Now you've gone away 
You were almost honest, almost 
Living alone, falling from grace 
I want to atone but there's just empty space 
I can't face tomorrow, now you're not coming back 
Walked off in the night and just left me the tracks 
I question your call by the tone of your voice 
I know I should hang up but I don't have a choice 
It happened that night when you told me to go 
Don't ask who's to blame, I don't know 
Almost, almost honest 
Almost, I was almost honest
