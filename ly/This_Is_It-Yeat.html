		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah (yeah) uhh (yeah) , uhh uhh, hmmm
Say YB yeah (yeah)

There's no we in me (No)
Saw that bag for me (Me)
I'm fresh like Mr clean (Fresh, fresh)
Lil' Kodak think it's me (Me, me, me)
I rock D&G man, it feel like a girl world
(yeah) , all on me, yeah
Push that start, I ain't using no key
(Skrrt, skrrt)
Mr crank, gotta keep it lowkey (Lowkey)
Ran off with the gas, he on E
I need some bread, need a wheat (yeah)
Off some molly, you know that I'm geeked
(I'm geeked)
I told 'em it's me, it's Yeat (It's Yeat)
I walked in and dropped me a bag on my feet
My family the east
So you know that we beasts

Can't ever go broke, man, that'd be a tragedy
Chasing the money
I lay with the cabbage green
In LA ballin', the Lakers the major team
This is it, yeah, yeah
This is it (Ok) , yeah, yeah
I rock with the bitch, yeah, yeah
You look at my wrist, yeah, yeah
Look at that bitch, yeah, yeah
You look at my wrist, lil' bitch, yeah
(yeah, yeah) rollin' a tray like an anaconda
Your bitch wanna suck on my dick
Little baddie (yeah, yeah)
Yeah, it is so cold out
Baby, go put on a muhfuckin' sweater
(Goddamn) cuttin' this muhfuckin' cheddar
No no more time, really gets better (Goddamn)
I went to tellin' the gang to get her
I got all this money, I got it together
(Goddamn) yuh, I'm fresh just like some jam
Yeah, yeah, fuck that shit
I don't got no pan yeah, yes
Got some guac and that shit in my hand
Yeah, yeah
Do all this 'cause I muhfuckin' can
I'm on the track like I'm Anthony Lamb
Trucin' these bitches like it on demand
I'm smokin' on OG, got it out the can (yeah)
Fuckin' these bitches, I got holy bam
M-m-m-mmm (yeah, yeah, yeah) yeah

There's no we in me (No)
Saw that bag for me (Me)
I'm fresh like Mr clean (Fresh, fresh)
Lil' Kodak think it's me (Me, me, me)
I rock D&G man, it feel like a girl world
(yeah) , all on me, yeah
Push that start, I ain't using no key
(Skrrt, skrrt)
Mr crank, gotta keep it lowkey (Lowkey)
Ran off with the gas, he on E
I need some bread, need a wheat (yeah)
Off some molly, you know that I'm geeked
(I'm geeked)
I told 'em it's me, it's Yeat (It's Yeat)
I walked in and dropped me a bag on my feet
My family the east
So you know that we beasts

This is it (yeah)
