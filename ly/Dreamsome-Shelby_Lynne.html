		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In the dark I can hear you whisper
Shadows still, move across the distance

What did you say, it´s okay
Did you miss me
Did you miss me

Make it mine, takin´ time, forgotten
Speak for me, silent plea, surrender

What did you say, it´s okay
Did you miss me
Did you miss me

You know at times I wondered
If you ever thought of me
And I wondered if you wanted to be free
Like me, and I needed to feel you and
I wondered did you miss me baby, oh yeah

Turn to gray, bluer shade, when the sun comes
Peaceful time, cease your mind, Dreamsome

What did you say, it´s okay, oh baby
Did you miss me
Did you miss me
Did you miss me
Did you miss me
