		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Today, I might just lay around
Listen to the same song
Cry for no reason at all
Get it out of my system
You know, I used to love getting bored
But now, without you, I have so much to time to think
There's nothing to think about anymore

I don't feel like myself right now
Feel like a stranger
Wonder who that person might be
And if you'd still love her
And today, I got upset over this song that I heard
And I guess I was just upset
'Cause why didn't I think of it first?

And tell me, why am I sad
When you are somewhere I don't want to go
Even though you invited me
And I still said no
