		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You were the world calling out my own name
You were the girl I fell beneath every day
You were the birds talking in my dream
You were the world I wish I'd never seen

You were the line, drawn in every way
You were divine, even though I'd say
You were the start of something I don't need
You were the world I wish I'd never seen

With or without you?
With or without you?
Better without you
Better without you
Better without you
Better without you
With or without you?
Better without you

Said I was more than a man in your way
Said I was yours 'til the end of the day
There was a time when I would have been
Over the moon sinking on my knees

You were the world calling out my own name
You were the girl I fell beneath every day
You were the birds talking in my dream
You were the world I wish I'd never seen

With or without you?
With or without you?
Better without you
Better without you
Better without you
Better without you
With or without you?
Better without you
