		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I just can't help thinking what you've done to me
You built a wall of love and tore it right down in front of me
And you think you know what's going on
You keep telling me that I am wrong
I don't care about what you do
Cause if you mess with me, I'll get rid of you.

[Chorus]
The picture you see is no portrait of me
It's too real to be shown to someone I don't know
And it's driving me wild

It makes me act like a child.

You think I am crazy, but what can I do
You waste your time, like my money
It ain't so funny, but it's true
Don't waste my money, baby
Now you can't tell me what's going on
And that I am weak while you are strong
What is it you need, that makes your heart bleed
Do you really know, cause it doesn't show.

[Chorus]

It makes me act like a child.

[Chorus]
