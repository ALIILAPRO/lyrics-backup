		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Move it away
Sing it for the yesterdays
Was I wrong to stay away?

Leave it in the cage
It's not the way that I wanna play
I'll just stay the same again

Or was I wrong?
Or is it okay to stay inside
And out of love?

You look like you did that day
Long hair and a mistake on your face
I know you know how to get out okay
So take a chance, don't hold back this way

Am I wrong?
Or is it okay to stay inside
And out of love?
Tell me I'm wrong
I'm just gonna give it a try
And hope that it's enough

Am I wrong?
Or is it okay to stay inside
And out of love?
Tell me I'm wrong
I'm just gonna give it a try
And know that it's enough

It's enough
It's enough
It's enough
Yeah, enough
