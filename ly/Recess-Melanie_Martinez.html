		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was too young to see the truth
In my grandma's lap, I'm drowning in her perfume
Too naive to even care
'Bout the words she whispered while she brushed out my hair

People gonna say
If you need a break, someone'll take your place
People gonna try
To tell you that you're fine with dollars in their eyes
(Just remember)

Don't let them fuck you, honey, no, oh
Don't let them try (ooh)
Don't let them hurt you, baby
Just say, "Recess, I'm tired"

Sittin' in my room, looking at all I've done
Everything I wanted has come to fruition
I should be happy but I can't get out my bed
Stressin' 'bout the voices screamin' inside my head

People gonna say
If you need a break, someone'll take your place
People gonna try
To tell you that you're fine with dollars in their eyes
(Just remember)

Don't let them fuck you, honey, no, oh
Don't let them try (ooh)
Don't let them hurt you, baby
Just say "recess," I'm tired

Where is my time?
Gone in my mind
Gone, I can't find
Euphoria
When I get upset
I think in my head
"I do as she says"

People gonna say
If you need a break, someone'll take your place
People gonna try
To tell you that you're fine with dollars in their eyes
(Just remember)

Don't let them fuck you, honey, no, oh
Don't let them try (ooh)
Don't let them hurt you, baby
Just say "recess," I'm tired
