		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The way you move
Has got me yearning
The way you move
Has left me burning
I know you know what you're doing to me
I know my hands will never be free
I know what it's like to be in chains

The way you move
Is meant to haunt me
The way you move
To tempt and taunt me
I know you knew on the day you were born
I know somehow I should've been warned
I know I walk every midnight to dawn
In chains

In chains, I'm in chains
In chains, I'm in chains

You've got me dying for you
It's you that I'm living through
You've got me praying to you
Saying to you anything you want me to
You've got me reaching for you
My soul's beseeching me too
You've got me singing to you
Bringing to you anything you ask me to

Oh

The way you move
Is mesmerizing
The way you move
It's hypnotizing

I know I crumble when you are around
Start to mumble a bit of a false sound
Stagger, stumble, shackled and bound
In chains

In chains, I'm in chains
In chains, I'm in chains

You've got me dying for you
It's you that I'm living through
You've got me praying to you
Saying to you anything you want me to
You've got me reaching for you
My soul's beseeching me too
You've got me singing to you
Bringing to you anything you ask me to

I'm in chains

In chains, I'm in chains
In chains, I'm in chains
In chains, I'm in chains
