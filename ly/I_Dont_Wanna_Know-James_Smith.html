		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Feels like we drove for a thousand miles
I would play you the songs that I wrote about you
I would sing you words that I would never say
Wish you'd never heard, if i'd known you wouldn't stay

I don't wanna know if you fall in love with someone new
If someone makes you happier than I could ever do
I don't wanna know

Watching the stories upon my phone
Seems like you found the one you want
And it just breaks me down like the car we used to own
Where our love was found, have you forgot about it all

I don't wanna know if you fall in love with someone new
If someone makes you happier than I could ever do
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know

If you fall in love with someone new
If someone makes you happier than I could ever do

If he makes you cry, if he makes you laugh
If he gives you all the things that we could never have
Cause I can't face the truth

I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know

If he makes you cry, if he makes you laugh
If he gives you all the things that we could never have
Cause I can't face losing you
