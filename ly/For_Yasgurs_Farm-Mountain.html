		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Who am I but you and the sun?
A slight reflection of everyone
Was it me who let you walk away?
Were you the one or is it we're the same?
What are we in time going by?
A simple story of a younger life
Having dreams and somehow through the day
We haven't come so far to lose our way

Look at me
I believe it's true
You're a part of me
I'm a part of you

Love is only what we come to live
The waking, breathing in all we give
A crystal passing reflected in our eyes 
Eclipsing all the jealousy and lies

Look at me
I believe it's true
You're a part of me
I'm a part of you

Quiet as the voices in a dream,
Without two shadows; the things I've seen
Remember the evening I let you walk away?
Were you the one, or is it we're the same?

Look at me
I believe it's true
You're a part of me
I'm a part of you
