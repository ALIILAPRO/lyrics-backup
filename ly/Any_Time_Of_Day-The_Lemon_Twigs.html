		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They say that people pass away
To make a space for all the young ones
Laughing, living for today
Along a golden coast of sunshine dancing
Close to someone they're romancing

Baby, I don't need someone to turn around
Maybe all you need are both feet on the ground
And you can make it bright any time of day

Sometimes you have to crawl
To know that gravity is working
'Til you're one day walking tall
And know that nothing is for certain
And no one can close the curtain but

Baby, I don't need someone to turn around
Maybe all you need are both feet on the ground
And you can make it bright any time of day

Always someone to be fooled around and fought with
Someone to get caught with
Someone to get lost with
Turning into all the people that we walk with
I've got no time to talk, I'm
Always changing

Maybe you don't need someone to turn around
Maybe all you need are both feet on the ground
And you can make it bright any time of day

Baby, I don't need someone to turn around (any time of day)
Maybe all you need are both feet on the ground
Baby, I don't need someone to turn around
Maybe all you need are both feet on the ground
And you can make it bright any time of day
