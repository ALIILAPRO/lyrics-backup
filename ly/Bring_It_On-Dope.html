		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bring it on
You say a lot of things
A lot of things you never do
Who'd want too be like you
And I really don't give a shit about the world
That job's for you
I just sit back and do the things that I want to

What you started ends with me

Get in line because I'm bringing it out
Get up tight because I'm bringing it outs
Step outside and we can bring it on out
Bring it on out bring it on

You do a lot of things
A lot of things you shouldn't do
It may catch up with you
And I really don't give a shit about the world
That cry's for you
I just sit back and do the things that I want to

What you started ends with me

Bring it on
Bring it
