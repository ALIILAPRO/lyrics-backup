		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If your daddy had a belt with his name engraved 
cnd your mama was a southern living queen
If your kinfolks all stayed right down the road 
You were raised up just like me
If you got a ball on the back of your truck
If you got some paint on a Carhartt shirt

cin't nothing like a long neck bottle bobbers on the water 
Crickets and the crawlers in a can
cin't nothing like front porch picking, Kentucky sipping
cnd living anyway you can
Naw it don't get better, Than me and her together 
Lights down with a vinyl on
cnd if that ain't something man, Y'all ain't nothing man
Nothing like me

I've been in and out of every little honky tonk
From the time I was twenty years old
cnd if I learned one thing from this road I've run
I still got some miles to go

I've had my share of long nights
Singing nitty gritty 
Till the lights come on and the bar goes empty
Man, don't get me wrong I love what I do 
But if I'm gonna tell you the truth 

cin't nothing like a long neck bottle bobbers on the water 
Crickets and the crawlers in a can
cin't nothing like front porch picking, Kentucky sipping
cnd living anyway you can
Naw it don't get better, Than me and her together 
Lights down with a vinyl on
cnd if that ain't something man, Y'all ain't nothing man
Nothing like me

If you love the life you got 
cnd you don't take it for granted
You thank the good Lord that you're still here in 
Naw you don't need much you like the simple things
Y'all if you know what I mean

cin't nothing like a long neck bottle bobbers on the water 
Crickets and the crawlers in a can
cin't nothing like front porch picking, Kentucky sipping
cnd living anyway you can
Naw it don't get better, Than me and her together 
Lights down with a vinyl on
cnd if that ain't something man, Y'all ain't nothing man
Nothing like me
