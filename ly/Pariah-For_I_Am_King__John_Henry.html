		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  To feel non-existent is so hard, hard to abide
Always on my own, it doesn't feel alright 
I don’t want to feel like this and be normal like everyone else
All I feel is emptiness, my self-esteem melts
Always in the shadow, never to be seen
Never in the light, I feel so in between 

Can you see me
Can you see what I have become
Do you hear me
Do you hear what I have to say

Dark is all I see, this life is not for me
How I wished for brighter days
I thought of a million ways
Do I really have to hit rock bottom
Before I turn this place into Sodom 

Can you see me
Can you see what I have become
Do you hear me
Do you hear what I have to say

I can’t let go what you did to me and how you made me feel 
I can’t forget what you did to me, what you did to me

I will crawl out of this darkness
That is holding, holding me down 
I am so fucking sick of this emptiness 
That is bringing, bringing me down
You can't wear my crown

Now you will
You will drown, in my misery
Pay for all the fucking shit you did to me
Drown, in my misery
I’ve had enough
You will drown, in my misery
Scream and beg, it won’t change a thing
Drown in my misery
I’ve had enough
