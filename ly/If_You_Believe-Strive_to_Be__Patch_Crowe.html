		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you believe
You can move the highest mountains
Cross the greatest oceans
And walk across the water, the water

You feel defeated, falling on your knees, and
Looking up for some hope tonight
You try to stand up, but you throw your hands up
Like you no longer have the strength to fight
'Cause you've seen too many sunsets
Too many days ending in the darkest night
But, on your own, you'll never know
You'll never know

If you believe
You can move the highest mountains
Cross the greatest oceans
Walk across the water, the water
Believe you can move the highest mountains
Cross the greatest oceans
Walk across the water
If you believe

They say that all you need is faith
But it's almost like you lost your way
Took a few wrong turns, took a few breaks
Falling behind now, looking for grace
'Cause you need someone to lift you up
Yeah, make right all the things you've done
'Cause on your own, you'll never know
You'll never know

If you believe
You can move the highest mountains
Cross the greatest oceans
Walk across the water, the water
Believe you can move the highest mountains
Cross the greatest oceans
Walk across the water
If you believe
If you believe, yeah

You can do anything
You can do anything
You can do anything
If you believe

If you believe
You can move the highest mountains
Cross the greatest oceans
Walk across the water, the water
Believe you can move the highest mountains
Cross the greatest oceans
Walk across the water
If you believe
