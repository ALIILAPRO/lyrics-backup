		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Just when things are getting complicated
In the eye of the storm
She flicks a red-hot revelation
Off the tip of her tongue
It does a dozen somersaults
And leaves you supercharged
Makes me wanna blow the candles out
Just to see if you glow in the dark

Shalalala
Shalalala
Shalalala
Shalalala

Home sweet home, home sweet home
Home sweet booby trap
I took the batteries out my mysticism
And put them in my thinking cap
She's got a telescopic hallelujah
Hanging up on the wall
For when it gets too complicated
In the eye of the storm

Shalalala
Shalalala
Shalalala
Shalalala
Ah

And in a hellcat spangled cavern
When your judgment's on the run
And you're acting like a stranger
'Cause you thought it looked like fun
And did you ever get the feeling
That these are things she's said before
Her steady hands may well have done
The Devil's pedicure
What you waiting for?
Sing another fucking

Shalalala
Shalalala
Shalalala
Shalalala
