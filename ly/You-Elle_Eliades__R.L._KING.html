		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You say take my hand
Follow me
I'm all for you babe
If you're for me
But I'm scared to trust
Cause I'm scared you'll break it
But if I don't trust
How we ever gon make it
I love, love you I do but I don't know what to do
I've never felt this way before
Nothing I wanted more
Than you
Than you
Than you
You
I wanted more than you
You
Last week I asked you
What's been on your mind
Am I on your time?
Like you are like you've been on mine
Baby I'm on a mission
To show you what you been missing
And no I don't (I don't)
Wanna waste your time
Show you all my love
Show you how it's meant to be
Some r-e-s-p-e-c-t
Baby I ain't like them other guys
And no I don't need to be between those thighs
You
Than you
Than you
Nothing I wanted more than you
You
This has to be the right time to do this
I wanna know you're in it for my whole life
I'm in it for the long ride
Always be by my side?
Can it be me and you?
And you
And you
Nothing I wanted more than you
You
