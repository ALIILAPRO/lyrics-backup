		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We’ve come this far together
We put our hands together
We fight and feel no longer
but we will not grow stronger here

The days are feeling colder
The night is growing stronger
Your heartbeat never louder
I cannot leave you in the dark

And when you wait for what is lost …
And when you wait for me …

I left you here. I don’t know why
What lies beneath, I can’t let go

Remorse is my companion
I never had to let you go
Step by step you break me
and now you slowly drag me down

At last it all is fragile
It took so long to understand
And looking back is painful
My shadow’s always at my back
