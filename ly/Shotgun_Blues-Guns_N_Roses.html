		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got the shotgun blues 
Shotgun blues 
I said I don't know what I did 
But I know I gotta move 
I got the shotgun blues 
Shotgun blues 
I can't wait here forever 
I got too much here to lose 

An now you're blowin' smoke 
I think you're one big joke 
Me...I gotta lot to learn 
An I'm still waitin' for the heads to turn 
You say I walk a line 
Fuck they move it every time 
You walk a mile in my shoes 
And then you tell me 'bout singin' the blues 
You get what you pay for 
An freedom's real high priced 
An while your rippin' off children 
Somebody's fuckin' your wife 
It's never made a difference 
It's only how you survive 

I got the shotgun blues 
Shotgun blues 
I said I don't know what I did 
But I know I gotta move 
I got the shotgun blues 
Shotgun blues 
I can't wait here forever 
I got too much here to lose 
An now you ask me why 
I said it's do or die 
I'll stick it right in your face 
And then I'll put you in your motherfuckin' place 
And you...you can suck my ass 
An I think it's so low class 
Me...I'm just so concerned 
I'm still waitin' for your ass to burn 
Ooooh you want a confrontation 
I'll give you every fuckin' chance 
With your verbal masturbation 
Me...I just like to dance 
How's that for provocation 
I'm just makin' a stance 
An I'm tired of the frustration 
Of livin' inside of your lies 
And I'm wired on indignation 
I said somebody's got to die 

I got the shotgun blues 
Shotgun blues 
I said I don't know what I did 
But I know I gotta move 
I got the shotgun blues 
Shotgun blues 
I can't stay here forever 
I got too much here to lose 
I got the shotgun blues 
Shotgun blues 
Listen motherfucker 
You're about to pay your dues 
I got the shotgun blues 
Shotgun blues 
If you're goin' up against me 
Then you know you're gonna lose 
I know 
I know (there's ways- that we- can find) 
I know 
I know 

You think anyone with an I.Q. over fifteen 
Would believe your shit...fuckhead 
Nothin' but a fuckin' pussy
