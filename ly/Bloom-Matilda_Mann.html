		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't be surprised when you open your eyes
And you find there's no one to hold
Thought I could stay but I'm just in your way
And this feeling's now getting old

Too young to make our promises made
I'll go wherever you'd go
Safer to stay and wait for the day
'Cause I'll do it better alone

I'd like to stay and make it all okay
But it's just too soon
And it's not me or you

Tell me if it's strange
And I'm maybe deranged
And you think it's a phase
But I know that it's not
I met you too soon
For anything to bloom

Don't be surprised when you open your eyes
And you find I'm suddenly gone
I gave you the signs and I walked on the line
For far too long

Too young to make our promises made
I'll go wherever you'd go
Safer to stay and wait for the day
'Cause I'll do it better alone

I'd like to stay and make it all okay
But it's just too soon
And it's not me or you

Tell me if it's strange
And I'm maybe deranged
And you think it's a phase
But I know that it's not
I met you too soon
For anything to bloom

I'd like to stay and make it all okay
But it's just too soon
And it's not me or you

Tell me if it's strange
And I'm maybe deranged
And you think it's a phase
But I know that it's not
I met you too soon
For anything to bloom
