		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I hear your heartbeat but you're never there
Like a mirage, you haunt me everywhere
All day long
I burn for you, lonely in the night
I tried to live alone, but I just can't get it right
Ya' know that, this town's like a Painted Desert
Dead heat, movin' in the city
I'm lost in a Painted Desert
In a Painted Desert without you

I've done some thinkin', now that you're not here
I know your reasons, and they're still not clear
All I'm sure of is what I got to lose
I tried to be a better loser, but it's just no use

Ya' know that this town's like a Painted Desert
Dead heat, movin' in the city
I'm lost in a Painted Desert
In a Painted Desert without you

Walkin' in the sundown, I search in vain
Waitin' on the wind that whispers out your name
Through concrete canyons echoing a world of other faces
No direction looks like home
Where is my oasis?

Ya' know that this town's like a Painted Desert
Dead heat, movin' in the city
I'm lost in a Painted Desert
In a Painted Desert without you
In a Painted Desert without you
Where is my oasis?
