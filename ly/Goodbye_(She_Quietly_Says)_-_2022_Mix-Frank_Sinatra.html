		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There is no great big ending, no sunset in the sky
There is no string ensemble, and she doesn't even cry
And just as I begin to say that we should make another try
She reaches out across the table looks at me and quietly says good-bye

There is no big explosion, no tempest in the tea
The world does not stop turning round, there's no big tragedy
Sitting in a coffee shop with cheesecake and some apple pie
She reaches out across the table looks at me and quietly says good-bye

Good-bye, said so easily, 
Good-bye, said so quietly
Good-bye, good-bye, good-bye, 

Just two always strangers avoid each other's eyes
One still make believing, one still telling lies, 
She tells me that I'm not to blame, but when I ask the reason why
She reaches out across the table looks at me and quietly says good-bye

Good-bye, said so easily 
Good-bye, said so quietly
Good-bye, good-bye, good-bye
She reaches out across the table looks at me and quietly says good-bye
