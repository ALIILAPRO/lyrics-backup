		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh I'm a mess right now
Inside out
Searching for a sweet surrender
But this is not the end
I can't work it out
How?
Going through the motions
Going through us

And oh, I've known it for the longest time
And all of my hope
All of my words are all over written on the signs
When you're on my road walking me home
Home, home, home, home

See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright I wanna feel your love
No, easy baby, maybe I'm a liar
But for tonight I wanna fall in love
And put your faith in my stomach

I messed up this time
Late last night
Drinking to suppress devotion
With fingers intertwined
I can't shake this feeling now
We're going through the motions
Hoping you'd stop

And oh, I've only caused you pain, you know
That all of my words will always be low
Of all the lies spoke
When you're on my road walking me home
Home, home, home, home

See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright I wanna feel your love
No, easy baby, maybe I'm a liar
But for tonight I wanna fall in love
And put your faith in my stomach

And for how long I love my lover
For how long I love my lover and now, now
For how long, long I love my lover, now, now
For how long, long I love my lover, now, now

For how long, long I love my lover, now, now (and I feel love)
For how long, long I love my lover, now, now (I feel it all over now, now, and I feel love)
For how long, long I love my lover, now, now (I feel it all over now, now, and I feel love)
For how long, long I love my lover, now, now (I feel it all over now, now, and I feel love)
For how long, long I love my lover, now, now (I feel it all over now, now, and I feel love)
For how long, long I love my lover, now, now (I feel it all over now, now, and I feel love)
For how long, long I love my lover, now, now
For how long, long I love my lover
