		  It's that time of year again?
Kool-Aid Man you ready for Christmas?

All I really want, really want for Christmas
All I really want, really want for Christmas
All I really want, really want for Christmas
Is everything on my list, baby
Hey

All I really want, really want for Christmas
All I really want, really want for Christmas
Is everything on my list, baby
Hey

Having a party on Christmas Eve
And I got a whole lot of Christmas glee
Whole lotta gifts I'd like to receive
And you know all year I been planting them seeds (Oh yeah!)
Everybody in here VIP
Ol' Saint Nick that's the MC
Got us getting turnt on some old CD's
Playing all your favourite songs from A to Z
Feliz Navidad, no eggnog, more Kool-Aid
Ohh yeah! (yeah)

All I really want, really want for Christmas
All I really want, really want for Christmas
All I really want, really want for Christmas
Is everything on my list, baby
All I really want, really want for Christmas
All I really want, really want for Christmas
All I really want, really want for Christmas
Is everything on my list, baby

Under the mistletoe, I got it made
Red cup, cherry lime-aid
So much food it's like a buffet
I got nips I'm the king of Spain
Lil' kids and your dancin' real silly
Trying to do that dance like Milli
Why you like it when I wear my grilly
Lil' snowman, why so chilly?
Feliz Navidad, no eggnog, more Kool-Aid
Ohh yeah! (yeah)

All I really want, really want for Christmas
All I really want, really want for Christmas
All I really want, really want for Christmas
Is everything on my list, baby
All I really want, really want for Christmas
All I really want, really want for Christmas
All I really want, really want for Christmas
Is everything on my list, baby, hey

Oh, oh yeah
Oh, oh yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh yeah
Oh, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh yeah
Yeah!

All I really want, really want for Christmas
All I really want, really want for Christmas
All I really want, really want for Christmas
Is everything on my list, baby
All I really want, really want for Christmas
All I really want, really want for Christmas
All I really want, really want for Christmas
Is everything on my list, baby
