		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Started kissing like I L
Oh I miss you like V E
Very much and you know Y
O I need U to read me
Spelling out what I can't say
Letters do what I can't babe
ILU with a heart babe
ILU with a heart babe
Started kissing like I L
Oh I miss you like V E
Very much and you know Y
O I need U to read me
Spelling out what I can't say
Letters do what I can't babe
ILU with a heart babe
ILU with a heart babe
Hold up
Whenever you come around oh I get nauseous
Like the butterflies in my stomach know you're sick
The way that you make me feel is so obnoxious
But honestly I would give
My head and my heart oh for better, for worse
The most I can give you in three little words
So let me write it out for you
Started kissing like I L
Oh I miss you like V E
Very much and you know Y
O I need U to read me
Spelling out what I can't say
Letters do what I can't babe
ILU with a heart babe
ILU with a heart babe
I want to be where you are in the morning
Baby it just don't stop
And the love that you give and the love that I've got is the only one I want
I still can't do it justice
This feeling you gave me
When you and me first
Started kissing like I L
Oh I miss you like V E
Very much and you know Y
O I need U to read me
Oh
Cause ILU with a heart babe
ILU with a heart
Started kissing like I L
Oh I miss you like V E
Very much and you know Y
O I need U to read me
Spelling out what I can't say
Letters do what I can't babe
ILU with a heart babe
ILU with a heart babe
ILU with a heart babe
