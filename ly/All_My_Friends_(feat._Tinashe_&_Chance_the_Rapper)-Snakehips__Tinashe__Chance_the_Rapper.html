		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh-hoo-hoo

We open with the vultures, kissing the cannibals
Sure I get lonely, when I'm the only
Only human in the heaving heat of the animals
Bitter brown salt, stinging on my tongue and I
I will not waiver, heart will not wait its turn
It will beat, it will burn, burn, burn your love into the ground
With the lips of another
Do you get lonely? Sure, I get lonely, sometimes

All my friends are wasted
And I hate this club
Man, I drink too much
Another Friday night I've wasted
My eyes are black and red
I'm crawling back to your bed

I hate the bar
Pharmacy addict hit the Wall Street traffic, took the car
We reinvent the wheel just to fall asleep at it, skrrr
Crash on the floor, catch the zzz's (uh)
Poppin' the polar opposite to the NZT (uh)
Hip-hop and the propaganda say they name brand (name brand)
But I done seen how the, did my main man (main man)
The nights we won't remember
Are the nights we won't remember
I'll be gone 'til November
All my city calls me Simba
Dreams are made for cages, nigga
Lions are for real, nigga
Dying is for real, niggas dying off of pills, nigga
Fridays are for chill and I escaped the treachery
I just had to rest in peace the recipe
The rest of us are praying that the sand will leave a tan
If you're up right now, hope you hear what I'm saying
Hope you hear what I'm saying

All my friends are wasted
And I hate this club
Man, I drink too much
Another Friday night I've wasted
My eyes are black and red (whoo!)
I'm crawling back to your bed

Do you get lonely?
Sure, I get lonely some nights
When the angels on my shoulder
Slumber and I'm stuck here with the vultures
Hissing and circling
You didn't call me, (call me, call me, call me)

Ohh, I'm crawling, crawling
Crawling back to you

All my friends are wasted (all my friends are wasted)
And I hate this club
Man, I drink too much (I drink too much)
Another Friday night I've wasted
My eyes are black and red
I'm crawling back to your bed
All my friends are wasted (all my friends are wasted)
And I hate this club
Man, I drink too much
Another Friday night I've wasted
My eyes are black and red
I'm crawling back to your bed
