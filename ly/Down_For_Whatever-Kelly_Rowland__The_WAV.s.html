		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm down for whatever
I'm down for whatever
When it comes to you
I could make love on the floor
I'm down for whatever
I'm down for whatever
Baby let's get creative
'Cause of you I am down
I'm down for whatever

There's no place I wouldn't go
Tonight I'm ready to take it anywhere
I'm amazed, by you all
You bring out a side I didn't know

Say the word, and I'll do anything, can't say no to you
It ain't juice, mixed with booze
No baby every word is true

I'm down for whatever
I'm down for whatever
When it comes to you
I could make love on the floor
I'm down for whatever
I'm down for whatever
Baby let's get creative
'Cause of you I am down

I'm down for whatever
I'm down for whatever
When it comes to you
I could make love on the floor
I'm down for whatever
I'm down for whatever
Baby let's get creative
'Cause of you I am down

I'm down for whatever
I'm down for whatever
I'm down for whatever
I'm down for whatever

Let's explore, see what we find
I'm waiting for you to discover me
No restraints, no regrets
Just give me your eye, I won't forget

Say the word, and I'll do anything, can't say no to you
It ain't juice, mixed with booze
No baby every word is true

I'm down for whatever
I'm down for whatever
When it comes to you
I could make love on the floor
I'm down for whatever
I'm down for whatever
Baby let's get creative
'Cause of you I am down

I'm down for whatever
I'm down for whatever
When it comes to you
I could make love on the floor
I'm down for whatever
I'm down for whatever
Baby let's get creative
'Cause of you I am down

I'm down for whatever
I'm down for whatever
I'm down for whatever
I'm down for whatever

Tonight, you're making everything feel right
Tonight, I wanna get high and touch the sky

I'm down for whatever
I'm down for whatever
When it comes to you
I could make love on the floor
I'm down for whatever
I'm down for whatever
Baby let's get creative
'Cause of you I am down

I'm down for whatever
I'm down for whatever
When it comes to you
I could make love on the floor
I'm down for whatever
I'm down for whatever
Baby let's get creative
'Cause of you I am down

I'm down for whatever
I'm down for whatever
I'm down for whatever
I'm down for whatever
I'm down for whatever
