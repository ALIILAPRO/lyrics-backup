		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Great John on the beat, by the way)

(Look, look)
Look how they treated a nigga
I know that they proud of me now
Said, "Look how they treated a nigga
I know that they proud of me now"
Look at me flex, enough with the stress
Enough with the stressin', nigga
Hmm, enough with the stress
Enough with the stressin', nigga

Look, I brought some bop, I don't dance
She givin' bop with no hand
That's two different situations, huh
Make movies, not situations, nigga
Don't turn this into a problem
Know they don't want problems with us
Tell 'em, "Bring out them bottles quicker"
'Cause I'm feelin' angry, I'll shoot the bitch up
Gang really bang, we gon' send this bitch up
Opps tryna F and 'em, fire the bitch up
Don't play with nobody (body)
Stare at me wrong, make a call to open this bitch up
He disrespectin' me, gettin' 'em outta here
Shout out my label, we winnin', we not a square (Winners Circle, bitch)
Look when I'm supposed to be chillin', huh
I'm supposed to be chillin'
But niggas keep gettin' out of place on me (say that, say that)
I don't wanna be a villain
But violence what they respect on me (say that, say that)
Came here to have fun, but guns 'round
Catch a price tag on me (boom, boom, boom)
Can't let 'em get the one-up
I can't let 'em flex on me (boom, boom, boom)

Look, look how they treated a nigga
I know that they proud of me now
Said, "Look how they treated a nigga
I know that they proud of me now"
Look at me flex, enough with the stress
Enough with the stressin', nigga
Hmm, enough with the stress
Enough with the stressin', nigga

Faded, feelin' faded
Now I'm finna go demon, try to play us (boom, boom, boom), huh
Gangin', we be gangin'
No, we won't tell anything, say none (say that, say that), huh
Them niggas frauds, flexin' and shit for the broads
Pull up, we put down 'em all (say that)
Ready for war, freestylin' but it's still hard
Bullets hit close from afar (say that, say that, say that)
Faded, feelin' faded
Now I'm finna go demon, try to play us (boom, boom, boom), huh
Gangin', we be gangin'
No, we won't tell anything, say none (say that, say that), huh
Them niggas frauds, flexin' and shit for the broads
Pull up, we put down 'em all (say that)
Ready for war, freestylin' but it's still hard
Bullets hit close from afar (say that, say that, say that)
