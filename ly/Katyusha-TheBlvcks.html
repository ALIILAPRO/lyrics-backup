		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  As the buds of pears and apples blossom
Over the river swiftly whirl the fogs
Came out strolling, a woman named Katyusha
Down the steep and rocky rivers slope
Came out strolling, singing by the river
About a silver eagle on the steppes
About her beloved whom she closely treasures
About the one whose letters she had saved

Oh you, song, the singing of a maiden
Soar behind the brightly shining sun
To the soldier at the far frontier
Tell this man, Katyusha says hi

Let his memories show a simple woman
Let him hear her tender, loving song
Let him guard his beloved motherland
And Katyusha shall keep their love safe
