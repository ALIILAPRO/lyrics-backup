		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I used to believe
I'd find love when I was young
That I'd find love before I die
Now it's just a broken dream
Now imagine
Imagine what it feels like
To be all alone in this world
With a broken dream

Used to believe when I was young
Soon I'd find forever love
Guess someone has to die alone
It'll be me 

Used to believe when I was young
Soon I'd find forever love
Guess someone has to die alone
It'll be me 

Oh I get it
We never talk about the ones who don't find love
Tell me what happens to the ones who don't find love
Can they die with a smile on their face?
And it hurts
Hurts to be alone
Trust when I say it hurts
When your biggest dream
Was to find love 

Used to believe when I was young
Soon I'd find forever love
Guess someone has to die alone
It'll be me 

Used to believe when I was young
Soon I'd find forever love
Guess someone has to die alone
It'll be me 

Never find love
Never find love 
Never find love 
Never find love
Never be in love
Never be in love
Never be in love
Never be in love
Never find love
Never find love 
Never find love 
Never find love
I get it

Never find love
Never find love 
Never find love 
Never find love
Never be in love
Never be in love
Never be in love
Never be in love
Never find love
Never find love 
Never find love 
Never find love
I get it
