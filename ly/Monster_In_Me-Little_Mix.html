		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Beautiful creatures, you and me
Every time that we touch it's dangerous
This spark is more than chemistry
Beautiful liars, drowning deep
Every night we fight and it's hot like hell
But it feels like heaven between the sheets

Every time we let go
I scream and I call for more

Touch me
Why don't we kill each other slowly?
What can I say, baby, what can I do?
The monster in me loves the monster in you
Hold me
Squeeze a little tighter 'til we can't breathe
What can I say, baby, what can I do?
The monster in me loves the monster in you
Monster in me, mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm, ayy, ayy
Loves the monster in you, mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm, ayy, ayy

Beautiful killer, cut me deep
Just a single kiss and I'm under your spell
Will you go in like I've never seen
Beautiful fire, love the heat, mm
Every night we fight and it's hot like hell
But I love the way that you make me scream

And every time I let go
I cry and I beg for more -ore

Touch me
Why don't we kill each other slowly?
What can I say, baby, what can I do?
The monster in me loves the monster in you
Hold me
Squeeze a little tighter 'til we can't breathe (can't breathe, baby)
What can I say, baby, what can I do?
The monster in me loves the monster in you
Monster in me, mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm, ayy, ayy
Loves the monster in you, mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm, ayy, ayy (ah, yeah)

Every moment we spend
Turning from friends to enemies
And fighting to hold on to each other
Every second we fall to fire below
It's so beautiful
The hell that we both made for each other
But it's all love and war
Louder we roar, crying for more
I know it's so wrong, but baby just

Touch me
Why don't we kill each other slowly?
What can I say, baby, what can I do? (Oh)
The monster in me loves the monster in you (babe)
Hold me
Squeeze a little tighter 'til we can't breathe (can't breathe, ooh)
What can I say, baby, what can I do? (Baby)
The monster in me loves the monster in you
The monster in me, yeah
(Wanting me, haunting you)
(Haunting me, haunting you, ooh) Oh
(Wanting me, haunting you) Oh
(Wanting me, haunting you, ooh)

Wanting me, haunting you
Haunting me, haunting you, ooh
Wanting me, haunting you
Haunting me
