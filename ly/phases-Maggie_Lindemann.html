		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You only want me in phases
Only hit me up when you're wasted
Hate it, treat me like a game, I won't play it
You only love me when you feel like it
I don't think love's supposed to feel like this

You started falling back into your old ways
You got me now so you don't treat me the same
Act sweet then you leave me in pain
I always take you back, I guess that makes me insane
It feels like you do this shit on purpose
Always getting mad, it makes me nervous
Pretty words are pretty fucking worthless
I'm pretty sure I don't deserve this

And I know that you won't change
I know that I can't stay
How many times can a heart break?

You only want me in phases
Only hit me up when you're wasted
Hate it, treat me like a game, I won't play it
You only love me when you feel like it
I don't think love's supposed to feel like this
Phases, took my heart, threw it on the pavement
Break it, just so you can stitch it up and save it
You only love me when you feel like it
I don't think love's supposed to feel like this

Lock me out the house, then you tell me that I can't leave
Tell me I'm the one then you say you can't stand me
Crying like a baby when I caught you cheating last week
Every promise that you make is a promise that you can't keep

And I know that you won't change
I know that I can't stay
How many times can a heart break

You only want me in phases
Only hit me up when you're wasted
Hate it, treat me like a game, I won't play it
You only love me when you feel like it
I don't think love's supposed to feel like this
Phases, took my heart, threw it on the pavement
Break it, just so you can stitch it up and save it
You only love me when you feel like it
I don't think love's supposed to feel like this

If you love me, if you don't, you should let me go
If you love me, if you don't, you should let me go
If you love me, if you don't, you should let me go
If you love me, if you don't, you should let me go

You only want me in phases
Only hit me up when you're wasted
Hate it, treat me like a game, I won't play it
You only love me when you feel like it
I don't think love's supposed to feel like this
Phases, took my heart, threw it on the pavement
Break it, just so you can stitch it up and save it
You only love me when you feel like it
I don't think love's supposed to feel like this

(Phases, phases, I know that you won't change)
(Phases, phases, I know that I can't stay)
You only love me when you feel like it
I don't think love's supposed to feel like this
