		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Come and see me and maybe you'll die
But I can keep you in artwork, the fluid kind
That's enough for excitements today
Prostrated faded, it's pay-to-play

Come and see me yeah, maybe you'll try
I've been holding these pyros till they could fly
Open up and enlighten again
Enjoy the skyline, it's an incremental end

Walk in on your own feet
Says the rover
It's my way or they all leave
Says the rover (ooh)
The rover

Ã‡a suffit, hell yeah, maybe it's time
You can't stick to the highways, it's suicide
I'm welling up with excitements again
The apex resolves, you need to tell your friends

Walk in on your own feet
Says the rover
It's my way or they all leave
Says the rover
The rover (ooh, ooh)

The rover (ooh, ooh)
The rover

Come and see me, yeah baby, let's cry
Satin face in some worlds we'd be too kind
Nature's subjected to fires again
Falling for my independence

Walk in on your own feet
Says the rover
You were high and on the wrong street
Till the rover
Said hop in, all in (ooh, ooh)
The rover
Hop in, all in (ooh, ooh)
The rover

The rover
All in, all in (ooh, ooh)
The rover
He barely has to seek repentants
