		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Speaking only to hear their own voice
Empty vessels making so much noise
For our sanity’s sake, we’ll torch the ground
And salt the earth in our wake
They rise just to drop like flies
I can’t watch as they breed and multiply
Draw blood, you parasites
Flatline, as you pull the splinters from your eye
I won’t watch you plead your case
High up on your soapbox stage
As you appoint yourself authority
Condemner of youth
Not even the truth will set you free
Who put the crown on your head?
You’re not a king of anything
You’ll burn in the eyes of the world
So cast your stones (and close your fists)
In a house of glass (you better not miss)
Is this the attention you crave?
You won’t find peace, may you turn in your grave
So bury the bones
Burn all the evidence and carry on like nobody knows
What you’ve been dragging around
The bloodied names and the rise of the body count
“Don’t dare to break the mould
Shut up and do as you’re told”
I don’t remember how the fuck it got so
Overcomplicated, the truth is overrated
And when the chips are down
They’ll burn it to the fucking ground
For the ones who refuse to admit
For the contrarian hypocrites
Those who live to provoke
As venom spills from your throat
I hope you choke
So sink your teeth in ‘til you
Draw blood, you parasites
Why don’t you show your face?
Step into the light
Who put the crown on your head?
You’re not a king of anything
You’ll burn in the eyes of the world
So cast your stones (and close your fists)
In a house of glass (you better not miss)
Is this the attention you crave?
You won’t find peace, may you turn in your grave
As you rise (you drop like flies)
I can’t watch (you multiply)
Why search for the source of a lie?
It’s easier to deride what you can’t deny
I won’t watch you plead your case
High up on your soapbox stage
As you appoint yourself authority
Condemner of youth, not even the truth
Will set you free
