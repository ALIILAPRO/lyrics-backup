		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Every time I open my mouth
I have regrets in my mind every time
And no one seems to figure me out
I guess it's stress
It's making me feel so depressed
Most my life I felt so tired
But every now and then when I try
I say

Keep it up and go on
You're only holding out for what you want
You no longer owe the strangers
It's enough, it's enough
Keep it up and go on
Yeah, you're only holding out for what you want
I know that it's so frustrating
It's enough, keep it up

Now I'm here and I wish that I wasn't
I'm in a place in front of a dozen
People I've never met
And I don't know if this is correct, uh
I guess I'm blessed
I never give myself respect
Most my life I'm asking why
But any time I give it a try, I say

Keep it up and go on
You're only holding out for what you want
You no longer owe the strangers
It's enough, it's enough
Keep it up and go on
Yeah, you're only holding out for what you want
I know that it's so frustrating
It's enough, keep it up

Yeah, it's enough
I've really had enough
I've paid the price, I'm done, no

Keep it up and go on
You're only holding out for what you want
You no longer owe the strangers
It's enough, it's enough
Keep it up and go on
Yeah, you're only holding out for what you want
I know that it's so frustrating
But it's enough, keep it up

(It's enough, it's enough)
(Keep it up, keep it up)
(Oh, no, no, mm)
