		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How much do I love you?
I'll tell you no lie
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

How many times in a day
Do I think of you?
How many roses
Are sprinkled with dew?

How far would I travel
Just to be where you are?
How far is the journey
How far is the journey
From here to a star?

How deep is the ocean?
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

How far would I travel
Just to be where you are?
How far is the journey
How far is the journey
From here to a star?

How deep is the ocean?
How deep is the ocean?
How deep is the ocean?
How deep is the ocean?
How deep is the ocean?
How deep is the ocean?
How deep is the ocean?
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?
