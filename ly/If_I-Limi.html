		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I felt alive
As long as you've been on my mind, yeah
We cannot run
Away from this feeling for long
Yeah
I guess it just happened for us
Written away in the stars
Cause I see myself in your eyes
Ooh oh oh
We can get lost in the dark
Looking for sunrise all night
I'm feeling my best in your arms
Ooh oh oh
If I held you close to my heart
And mended all of your scars
If I risked it all for the night
Baby, you and I could fall in love
If I held you close to my heart
And mended all of your scars
If I risked it all for the night
Baby, you and I could be a vibe
Ooh
Know you hate it
The time you wasted
All the fake love
Left you jaded
They can't read your moves
They're too basic
They don't know the you that I've met
I can make things feel alright
Shut the world out for the night
I know places we can hide
Ooh ooh oh
I guess it just happened for us
Written away in the stars
Cause I see myself in your eyes
Ooh oh oh
We can get lost in the dark
Looking for sunrise all night
I'm feeling my best in your arms
Ooh oh oh
If I held you close to my heart
And mended all of your scars
If I risked it all for the night
Baby, you and I could fall in love
If I held you close to my heart
And mended all of your scars
If I risked it all for the night
Baby, you and I could be a vibe
Could be a vibe
