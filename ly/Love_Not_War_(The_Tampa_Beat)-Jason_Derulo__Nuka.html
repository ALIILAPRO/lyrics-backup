		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Jason Derulo (yeah)
Oh, oh
Ooh

Bust it open for a gift
I put diamonds on your wrist
I can't buy your lovin'
It's never enough
I took that girl on a trip
'Cause we was arguin'
Ever since we stopped touchin'
We're not in touch

I know money can't buy, buy, buy your love
I guess I didn't try, try hard enough
But we could work this like a nine-to-five
Oh, oh
Mama told me stop playin', playin' all the games
Steady throwin' dollars, expectin' change
But every war ends the same

Can we just make love, not war?
Oh, oh
Can we just make love, not war?
Oh, oh

I solved my problems with a check
Now I'm payin' for it
You wanted nothin', uh
Nothin' but love
I can't lie, I'm a mess
I'm too jealous, yes
So hard to trust you
When I don't trust myself

I know money can't buy, buy, buy your love
I guess I didn't try, try hard enough
But we could work this like a nine-to-five
Oh, oh
Mama told me stop playin', playin' all the games
Steady throwin' dollars, expectin' change
But every war ends the same

Can we just make love, not war?
Oh, oh
Can we just make love, not war?
Oh, oh

And my people say
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Let's just trust in lovin', baby
But, shawty, I know

I know money can't buy, buy, buy your love
I guess I didn't try, try hard enough
Call, we could work this like a nine-to-five, five, five
Oh, oh, baby
Mama told me stop playin', playin' all the games (stop playin' the games)
Steady throwin' dollars, expectin' change
But every war ends the same

Can we just make love, and not war?
Oh, oh, baby
Can we just make love, not war?
Oh, oh
Not war, baby
