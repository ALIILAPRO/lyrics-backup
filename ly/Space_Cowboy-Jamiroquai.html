		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everything is good and brown
I'm here again
With a sunshine smile upon my face
My friends are close at hand
And all my inhibitions have disappeared without a trace
I'm glad, oh, that I found
Ooh, somebody who I can rely on

This is the return of the space cowboy
Interplanetary, good vibe zone
Say, at the speed of cheeba, you and I go deeper
Maybe I'm gonna have to get high just to get by
Now, you know I got that
I got that cheeba, cheeba kinda space cowboy vibe

Everything is good, oh, and green
Say, I'm red again
And I don't suppose I'm coming down
I can see clearly, so high in sky
A man with psychedelic picture frames
Of happiness to shade his eyes
He's glad, oh, that he found
Somebody who he can rely on

This is the return of the space cowboy
Interplanetary, good vibe zone
Say, at the speed of cheeba, help me go deeper
You and I, you and I, you and I, hey, oh

Now, this is the return of the space cowboy
He's got that, he's got that interplanetary, good
Good vibe zone

Oh, good times, hard times, good vibes, hey
Oh, I like what you're doing on that, yeah
This time

Oh now, now, this is the return of the space cowboy
Interplanetary, hmm, interplanetary, good vibe zone
At the speed of cheeba, oh, you and I, you and I go deeper
Hey, maybe I'm gonna have to get high this time

This is the return of the space cowboy
Interplanetary, good vibe zone
Say, at the speed of cheeba, oh we're going deeper
You and I, you and I, you and I
You and I, you and I, you and I
You and I, you and I, you and I, hey

We're going deeper, yeah
We're going deeper, yeah
We're going deeper, yeah

Now, this is the return of the space cowboy
Good times, hard times, good vibes, oh
Interplanetary, good vibe zone

Ha-ha-ha
Yeah, aw, hmm, I know from where it's comin' from

Now we're going, people
At the speed of cheeba
You and I go deeper
I'll stay with you on this
On this interplanetary level

This is the return of the space cowboy
Interplanetary, hey, a good vibe zone
Speed, speed, at the speed of cheeba
Oh, you and I, you and I, oh, you and I go
Hey, hey, hey, you and I go deeper, deeper
I wanna go, I wanna go deeper with you

You know, you got that, you got that space cowboy vibe
Interplanetary, good vibes, good vibes, good times
At the speed of cheeba, I got cheeba on the brain
Go now, gotta go, gotta go, gotta go
