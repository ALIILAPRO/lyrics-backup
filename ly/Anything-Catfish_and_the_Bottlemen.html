		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It gets difficult to talk
When you nearly deafen me 'cause you start laughing
But if it means that we get through
And though you'll mix up every detail
Of every story that you're ever gonna tell me
But if it means that we get through
Y'know, I never wanna trouble you
When you're working, so I always try to wait
But if it means that we get through
And when we drink it just gets funnier
And to be honest, I don't mind us drunk
But if it means that we get through

I won't smoke if you don't no more
'Cause I know you hate the taste of it
And I don't wanna picture our firstborn
If you've stopped discussing names with me
But if it means that we get through
Then you know I'm up for anything

Ya know I always try to settle you when I'm away
'Cause we struggle sometimes
But if it means that we get through
If it means that we get through
If it means that we get through

I won't smoke if you don't no more
'Cause I know you hate the taste of it
And I don't wanna picture our firstborn
If you've stopped discussing names with me
But if it means that we get through
Then you know I'm up for anything

Anything you need, at anytime at all
I want you to phone me
'Cause everything you feel on every night alone
Is because you need me

Anything you need, at anytime at all
I want you to phone me
'Cause everything you feel on every night alone
Is because you need me

I won't smoke if you don't no more
'Cause I know you hate the taste of it
And I don't wanna picture our firstborn
If you've stopped discussing names with me
But if it means that we get through
Then you know I'm up for anything

Ya know I always try to settle you when I'm away
'Cause we struggle sometimes
But if it means that we get through
