		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I could fall off today
And still steal a famous n*gga hoe
I'm a young fly n*gga fo' sho
Okay now put your ass on my dick
And pose on the sh*t
Okay now
Freak my sh*t, freak my sh*t, freak my sh*t
B*tch freak my sh*t
Freak my sh*t, freak my sh*t, freak my sh*t
B*tch freak my sh*t

I'm about to f*ck who I'm dancing with
I'm about to f*ck who I'm dancing with
I'm about to f*ck who I'm dancing with
Shout out to the f*ckin' DJ for playing this sh*t aye

Ass all over me
Drunk's the only way I'm supposed to be
My ex say I'm trippin'
The money made me different
I said b*tch you just addicted because of what a d*ck did
Do you like this position, do you like this position
Do the sh*t you sipping get you interested in kissing women
Is it f*ck your inhibitions, f*ck your inhibitions
Then bring that ass back like it's stuck in intermission aye
Cute chick with her hair curly
She ride a d*ck till it get early
Her pussy clean but she dance dirty
F*ck me you getting blown out b*tch I am Kirby
You been makin' love too long
Do me like ya n*gga gone, do me like ya n*gga gone
The baddest girls in LA and the bay
And I do em even when I'm on break

So if I fall off today
I still steal a famous n*gga hoe
I'm a young fly n*gga fo' sho
Okay now put your ass
On my dick
And pose on the sh*t
Okay now
Freak my sh*t, freak my sh*t, freak my sh*t
B*tch freak my sh*t
Freak my sh*t, freak my sh*t, freak my sh*t
B*tch freak my sh*t

I'm about to f*ck who I'm dancing with
I'm about to f*ck who I'm dancing with
I'm about to f*ck who I'm dancing with
Shout out to the f*ckin' DJ for playing this sh*t aye

If yo b*tch come up to me, homie that's macking
Swagg killing you in what you call your best outfit
Plenty more so it's for sure we getting on these whores
Have a orgy in this b*tch no more locked doors
You a wildflower, and I'm westin' on em
But I got my Jordan's on, so don't step on em
B up in here flexin', I might have to drop ya homes
Tell the muthaf*cking DJ to turn that waka on
But I'ma turn it down, because it's too much pussy
Throw my gold gold at these bird birds, call em Whoopi's
Can't do a sausage fest, come on girls make it juicy
Dancin' on me African booty booty call her Judy
Tonight is goin' down I only came out here for work
I said I like this girl but actions speak louder than words
I didn't do nothing, that b*tch came on to me first
But I can't lie, I had money told that b*tch to work

Okay now
Freak my sh*t, freak my sh*t, freak my sh*t
B*tch freak my sh*t
Freak my sh*t, freak my sh*t, freak my sh*t
B*tch freak my sh*t

I'm about to f*ck who I'm dancing with
I'm about to f*ck who I'm dancing with
I'm about to f*ck who I'm dancing with
Shout out to the f*ckin' DJ for playing this sh*t aye
