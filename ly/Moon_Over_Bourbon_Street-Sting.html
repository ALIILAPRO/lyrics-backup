		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's a moon over bourbon street tonight 
I see faces as they pass beneath the pale lamplight 
I've no choice but to follow that call 
The bright lights  the people  and the moon and all 
I pray everyday to be strong 
For I know what I do must be wrong 
Oh you'll never see my shade or hear the sound of my feet 
While there's a moon over bourbon street 

It was many years ago that I became what I am 
I was trapped in this life like an innocent lamb 
Now I can never show my face at noon 
And you'll only see me walking by the light of the moon 
The brim of my hat hides the eye of a beast 
I've the face of a sinner but the hands of a priest 
Oh you'll never see my shade or hear the sound of my feet 
While there's a moon over bourbon street 

She walks everyday through the streets of New Orleans 
She's innocent and young from a family of means 
I have stood many times outside her window at night 
To struggle with my instinct in the pale moonlight 
How could I be this way when I pray to god above 
I must love what I destroy and destroy the thing I love 
Oh you'll never see my shade or hear the sound of my feet 
While there's a moon over bourbon street
