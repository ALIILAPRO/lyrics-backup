		  (Fony Wallace biotch) nygah
(KAAN3X) yehh, yehh, yehh, yehh, yehh, yehh

Walkin' like I'm ten foot tall
Timb's on my feet
Saw a spider in the street like
Yeah, walkin' like I'm meant to ball
Spider on the beat, put the
Lighter on the tree, like yeah
Ah, tell me what's the vibe then bro?
Are we gonna have to fuck a
Pussy up tonight or something?
Right, gonna have a good night then bro
Wanna box on the beat? I
Could knock out his teeth, like yeah

Yeah, all these mindless drones are wack
Plenty pussies plottin'
That's a fuckin' fact
I done lost my noggin, had to take a nap
Now I'm back
Trynna save the scene from collapse (Wait)
Hold up, I'm puffin' this wax (Baked)
Six pounds of dope, and it's packed (Safe)
Me and Darkie with the strap
How the fuck you gon' mess with that? (Wait)

Hold up, I got on a sweater (Bape)
I'm high, I'm light as a feather (Vape)
They mad that we do it better
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ugh
I buy ten packs then I sell it right back
To the same motherfuckers sayin'
They do that
If you make rap then you probably cap
Don't cap, them tracks that you made is wack
You're so crap that it smell
Like you shat yourself
You should go check that, your tushy
"Man's not hot", he don't get no cat
Wearin' all black like a black cat
You're pussy

Walkin' like I'm ten foot tall
Timb's on my feet
Saw a spider in the street like
Yeah, walkin' like I'm meant to ball
Spider on the beat, put the
Lighter on the tree, like yeah
Ah, tell me what's the vibe then bro?
Are we gonna have to fuck a
Pussy up tonight or something?
Right, gonna have a good night then bro
Wanna box on the beat? I
Could knock out his teeth, like yeah

Black widow, black Zippo
You know we in the money
Now it's mad simple
We poppin' off and tourin' shows
I signed a bitches tit's
Then got my girl to sign it too
I hope her tit's get rich
Like, take ya' pic
Tag me and now you're clouted
Got so much cash on me, I'm drownin'
Twenties, fifties, hunnids and the thousands
Punchin' every fan that I encounter

Yeah, brown recluse
I'm inside everyday, brown recluse
On your phone, you should check your net-use
Wanna be up, but very few of us get to, yeah
Yeah if you were a Pok√©mon I
Wouldn't wanna catch you crack the safe
Just hope the cops don't catch you
I like racks
That's all a nigga trynna get to
Up the strap and then wet you, blegh!

Wal Walkin', wa-wa-walkin', ten-ten
Foot tall, ten-ten-ten foot tall
Wal Walkin', wa-wa-wa-, like I'm
Meant to ball, like I'm meant to ball
Wal Walkin', wa-wa-walkin', ten-ten
Foot tall, ten-ten-ten foot tall
Walkin', walkin', wa-wa-walkin', like I'm
Meant to ball, meant to ball
