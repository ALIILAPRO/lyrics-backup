		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Untouchable like a distant diamond sky
I'm reachin' out and I just can't tell you why
I'm caught up in you
I'm caught up in you

Untouchable, burnin' brighter than the sun
And when you're close, I feel like comin' undone

In the middle of the night, when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spellin' out your name
You gotta come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven

Oh, oh
It's half full and I won't wait here all day
I know you're sayin' that you'd be here anyway

But you're untouchable, burnin' brighter than the sun
And now that you're close, I feel like comin' undone

In the middle of the night, when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spellin' out your name
You gotta come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on
Oh, in the middle of the night, we can form this dream
I wanna feel you by my side standin' next to me
You gotta come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven

I'm caught up in you
Oh
Oh

But you're untouchable, burnin' brighter than the sun
Now that you're close, I feel like coming undone

In the middle of the night, when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spellin' out your name
You gotta come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, oh, whoa, oh

In the middle of the night, when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spellin' out your name
You gotta come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, come on
In the middle of the night, we can form this dream
I wanna feel you by my side, standin' next to me
You gotta come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven

Oh, oh
Oh
Oh

And in the middle of the night, when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spellin' out your name
You gotta come on, come on, uh, come on, come on
Come on, come on
Oh, oh, oh, oh

It's like a million little stars
Spellin' out your name
Spellin' out your name
Ooh
