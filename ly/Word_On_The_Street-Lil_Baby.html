		  We Global now

Word on the street, they got a lil' bitty hit out
Really run Atlanta, I can make a nigga get out
If anything, I have more respect for you bitches
Nigga, you a bitch, we don't shoot and miss (Nah)
Glock-19 unfold and it spit out
Double R underneath the door when I get out
Clutchin' on my fans, had to tell lil' bro to chill out
How the fuck your whole gang down the road and you still out?
Undercover rat, pussy nigga, you a sellout
Every show I get either packed or it sell out
I been ballin' hard, you on the bench, you gotta sit out
Know a nigga mad, he can't even put a hit out
Middle of the winter, drop top with a mink on
Bad lil' vibe, yeah, she say that's her theme song
I done made a whole million dollars off a flip phone
No Soulja Boy, that bitch ain't even have a ringtone

Skinny Mike Amiris like I skate
We just fuck around, we don't date
I went straight up there to Mars, so they hate
And I got a lot of cars, they all up to date
I was at the bottom, literally I was boxed in
Then I took off, I ain't have no other option
I was too calm, now a nigga just pop shit
I was in Japan, buyin' drip and blowin' Yen

Call overseas, tell them youngins to spin again
I don't throw rocks and hide my hand 'cause I'm a man
Million cash in the book bag, I'm a big dog
Threw my shot at any nigga, bitch, I think I'm Chris Paul
Sippin' all these meds, nigga gotta be throwed off
I was gettin' head, fucked around and I dozed off
Rolls Royce truck, crank it and let the nose out
Everything I said, I went did it, boy, I'm the chosen child

Skinny Mike Amiris like I skate
We just fuck around, we don't date
I went straight up there to Mars, so they hate
And I got a lot of cars, they all up to date
I was at the bottom, literally I was boxed in
Then I took off, I ain't have no other option
I was too calm, now a nigga just pop shit
I was in Japan, buyin' drip and blowin' Yen

Safe deposit boxes on fleek
And my bank account, I don't touch it, I'ma get it out the street
Got your vibe all on my drip, she say you cheap
And she know I'm havin' money, buy her titties, ass, and teeth
Catchin' three flights every day, the only time I get some sleep
Kept it real and they be cappin', really you can't compete
I spend it all on bullets, niggas don't wanna beef
Got a D-boy swag, pull up SRT
I ain't playin' with nobody, nobody gon' play with me
Got a driver for my car, he take me from A to Z
Got some homies on the yard I probably'll never see
If the money was the issue I promise they'd be free
They was sleepin' on me bad, they fucked around, woke up a beast
Switch it up, I went romantic, took my shawty out to Greece
Every city that I go to, gotta link up with the street
I'm too humble for 'em, guess that's why they thinkin' I was sweet

Skinny Mike Amiris like I skate
We just fuck around, we don't date
I went straight up there to Mars, so they hate
And I got a lot of cars, they all up to date
I was at the bottom, literally I was boxed in
Then I took off, I ain't have no other option
I was too calm, now a nigga just pop shit
I was in Japan, buyin' drip and blowin' Yen
