		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't dive too deep I'm in a submarine
You'll drown in seconds if you follow me
Do me dirty bitch fuck yo apology
I'll let yo bitch go wallaby on my dick then swallow me
That bitch boy thought I was his friend hey now that's just pretend
Because I said wassup to you doesn't mean I even fuck with you
I light my blunt then I ascend in the smoke & suspend
Running through my revenue, I smoke weed like I needed to

I told that bitch get the fuck up, off my, mother fuckin dick
Oil slick!
In the river and I'm bout to burn the bridge
Fuckin cringe, kill the people with a acid filled syringe
Then I'm pinched
Fuck a dream you
Know I'm still up in this bitch
Know I'm still up in this bitch
I'm still up in this bitch!
What the fuck
How the fuck
Am I still up in this bitch
