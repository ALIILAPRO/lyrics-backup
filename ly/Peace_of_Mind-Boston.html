		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now if you're feelin' kinda low 'bout the dues you've been paying
Future's coming much too slow
And you want to run but somehow you just keep on stayin'
Can't decide on which way to go
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I understand about indecision
But I don't care if I get behind
People livin' in competition
All I want is to have my peace of mind, yeah, whoa

Now you're climbin' to the top of the company ladder
Hope it doesn't take too long
Can'tcha you see there'll come a day when it won't matter?
Come a day when you'll be gone, whoa

I understand about indecision
But I don't care if I get behind
People livin' in competition
All I want is to have my peace of mind

Take a look ahead, take a look ahead, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Now everybody's got advice they just keep on givin'
Doesn't mean too much to me
Lots of people out to make-believe they're livin'
Can't decide who they should be, whoa

I understand about indecision
But I don't care if I get behind
People livin' in competition
All I want is to have my peace of mind

Take a look ahead, take a look ahead, look ahead
