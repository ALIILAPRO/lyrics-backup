		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  OK, alright people. Come on, pay attention,
Girls, come on,
I hope everybody remembers the cheer,
Because certain people last time did not remember the cheer,
So let's get it together. 
'Kay we got a game next week,
Alright, One, Two

[Chorus]
This, is, my, re, venge

I'm a little tease
Watch what I do
Here's a little taste
Of how its gonna be from now on

[Bridge]
Yo, fuck me and my friends
Yo, my friends and me
Aren't special enough
To make a case for Jealousy
Fuck the secret sauce
I'm Gothalicious with cheese
And all the gay things I say
Make such a pretty melody
Now I wanna say all those bad things about you, cheese
I make up things so everyone hates you

[Chorus]

I'm a little tease
Watch what I do
Here's a little taste
Of how its gonna be from now on

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

I'm a little tease
Watch what I do
Here's a little taste
Of how its gonna be from now on

[Chorus] 

Is, my, re, venge

[Chorus]

I'm a little tease
Watch what I do
Here's a little taste
Of how its gonna be from now on

[Chorus] 

Is, my, re, venge
