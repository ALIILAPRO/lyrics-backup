		  Woo, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Woo, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh

Why do boys think every song is about them?
Why do they think we ain't living without them?
Like a damsel in distress (damsel in distress)
As if you're always in my head (always in my head), no
Though you'll notice that's the part of the problem
'Cause on my list they are right at the bottom
See, when I'm with my friends (when I'm with my friends), yeah
We talk 'bout better things, things

Oh, I know that you're insecure, ear on the door
Oh, wish you could get some more, like a fly on the wall

I bet you're thinking 'bout (thinking 'bout)
What we're talking 'bout when you're not around
Well sorry, that's none of your business (ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)
None of your business, no (ooh, ooh, ah)
And when we're going out (going out)
You don't need to know about my whereabouts
Oh, now you wanna see what you're missing (ooh, ooh)
Well sorry, that's none of your business (ooh, ooh)
But I bet you wish it was

Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh

Now the thing about us, we are from different planets
We could explain but you wouldn't understand it
There are some things that we know (some things that we know), yeah
Which are better that you don't (which are better that you don't)
We're just talking about this, talking about that
It's our prerogative, we ain't keeping secrets
But we ain't gotta tell you shit, nah
We ain't gotta tell you shit

Oh, I know that you're insecure (insecure), ear on the door (ear on the door)
Oh, wish you could get some more, like a fly on the wall

I bet you're thinking 'bout (thinking 'bout)
What we're talking 'bout when you're not around (when you're not around)
Well sorry, that's none of your business (none of your business)
None of your business, no (oh)
And when we're going out (when we're going out)
You don't need to know about my whereabouts (about my whereabouts)
Oh, now you wanna see what you're missing (missing)
Well sorry, that's none of your business
But I bet you wish it was

Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, yeah
Ah-ah, oh no
And I bet you wish it was
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, yeah
You wish it was
But it's none of your business, ah

I bet you're thinking 'bout
What we're talking 'bout when you're not around
Well sorry, that's none of your business (none of your business)
None of your business
But I bet you wish it was
