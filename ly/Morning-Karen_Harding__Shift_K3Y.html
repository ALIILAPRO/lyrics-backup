		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't even care if there's no morning
No morning, no morning, no morning
I don't even care if there's no morning
No morning, no morning, no morning, no morning

Midnight stories keep me up
And I don't wanna close the book
In the dark, we find ourselves again
(Find ourselves again)

When the sun comes, could it be the end?
Or are were just in Elysium?
Standing, looking right over the edge

I hear you calling
And the night, it lasts forever
Let's forget to remember, together
As we're falling
We could stay this way forever and ever
But I don't even care if there's no morning

Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na, na
Na-na-na-na-na
I don't even care if there's no morning
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na, na
Na-na-na-na-na
I don't even care if there's no morning
No morning, no morning, no morning
No morning, no morning
I don't even care if there's no morning
No morning, no morning, no morning
No morning, no morning

The stars, they move across the sky
They're watching us with crystal eyes
A curtain of the night like a disguise

When the sun comes, could it be the end?
Or are were just in Elysium?
Standing, looking right over the edge

I hear you calling
And the night, it lasts forever
Let's forget to remember, together
As we're falling
We could stay this way forever and ever
But I don't even care if there's no morning

Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na, na
Na-na-na-na-na
I don't even care if there's no morning
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na, na
Na-na-na-na-na
I don't even care if there's no morning
No morning, no morning, no morning
No morning, no morning
I don't even care if there's no morning
No morning, no morning, no morning
No morning, no morning

I don't even care if there's no
I don't even care if there's no morn-
