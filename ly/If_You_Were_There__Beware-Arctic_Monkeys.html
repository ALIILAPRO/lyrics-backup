		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you were there, beware the serpent soul pinchers
Three-hundred and fifty "No, thank you"s and nobody flinches
Go on, girl, go on, give us something gruesome
We require your grief, the thugs help the thieves
As they're trying to rob the words from her gob and
Take the source of the innocence

If you were there, beware the serpent soul pinchers
Can't you sense she was never meant to fill column inches
Ain't you had enough? What you're trying to dig up
Isn't there to be dug, the thieves help the thugs
As they're trying to beat the good grace of a sweetheart
Out to the point she'll comply

And why leave her on her own?
If I'd have known then I wouldn't have said it
I wouldn't have said it if I would have known
Why leave her on her own?
If I predicted tears then I wouldn't have said it
I wouldn't have said it if I would have known

There's a circle of witches, ambitiously vicious they are
Our attempts to remind them of reason won't get us that far
But I don't know what it is that they want
I don't know what it is that they want
But I haven't got it to give
And she hasn't got it to give
