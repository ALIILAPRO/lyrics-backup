		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  See, first of all
I know these so-called players wouldn't tell you this
But I'ma be real and say what's on my heart
Let's take this chance and make this love feel relevant
Didn't you know I loved you from the start, yeah
When I think about all these years we put in this relationship
Who knew we'd make it this far? 
When I think about where we would I be if we were to just fall apart
And I just can't stand the thought of leavin' you

Meet me at the altar in your white dress
We ain't gettin' no younger, we might as well do it (we ain't gettin' no younger, girl)
Been feelin' you all the while, girl, I must confess (feelin' you all the while)
Girl, let's just get married
I just wanna get married
Meet me at the altar in your white dress
We ain't gettin' no younger, we might as well do it (so might as well do it, yeah)
Been feelin' you all the while, girl, I must confess (and I must confess)
Let's just get married (baby, lets get married)

Said I done it all 
But frankly, girl, I'm tired of this emptiness
I wanna come home to you and only you
'Cause makin' love to just anyone ain't happenin'
I just gotta be with you
Do you think about us finishin' somethin' we started so long ago? 
I wanna give you my all
Do you think about maybe us havin' some babies? 
Come on won't you be my lady forever, girl

I'm ready to commit to you
And I just can't wait for that night
'Cause I need you here with me
And let's start a family, oh-woah

Meet me at the altar in your white dress
We ain't gettin' no younger, we might as well do it (we might as well do it)
Been feelin' you all the while, girl, I must confess 
Girl, let's just get married
I just wanna get married
Meet me at the altar in your white dress (oh, oh-oh, oh)
We ain't gettin' no younger, we might as well do it (we ain't gettin' no younger, hey)
Been feelin' you all the while, girl, I must confess (married, married, married, married)
Let's just get married (all I want you to do is meet me at the altar, hey)

Meet me at the altar in your white dress
We ain't gettin' no younger, we might as well do it (baby, we ain't gettin' no younger)
Been feelin' you all the while, girl, I must confess 
(Feelin' you, feelin' you, feelin' you all the while, all the while)
Girl, let's just get married 
I just wanna get married (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Meet me at the altar in your white dress
We ain't gettin' no younger, we might as well do it (we might as well do it, baby)
Been feelin' you all the while, girl, I must confess (girl, I must confess)
Let's get married (let's get married, baby, said let's get married, baby)

Meet me at the altar in your white dress (baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, woah-oh)
We ain't gettin' no younger, we might as well do it 
Been feelin' you all the while, girl, I must confess 
Girl, let's just get married (let's get married, baby)
I just wanna get married (woah-woah-woah, woah)

Meet me at the altar in your white dress
We ain't gettin' no younger, we might as well do it (do it, do it, do it)
Been feelin' you all the while, girl, I must confess 
Let's get married
