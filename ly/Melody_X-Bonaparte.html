		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now you look for love in the times of hate
How many swipes for a blow of fate
You keep the light on
You keep the light on
You keep the night light on

Every day is like the same old song
Until everything right goes wrong
You keep the light on
You keep the light on
You keep the night light on

Hold your broken dream up high
Oh you know you try
Oh you know you try
It's the worst case scenario lullaby

And then the rent is just a little too late
Ain't gonna be no birthday cake
You keep the light on
You keep the light on
You keep the night light on

Hold your broken dream up high
Oh you know you try
Oh you know you try
It's the worst case scenario lullaby

Oh you know you try
Oh you know you try
It's the worst case scenario lullaby

Even if the cops come and knock on your door
And the pills spill out on the floor
You keep the light on
You keep the light on
You keep the night light on

Hold your broken dream up high
Oh you know you try
Oh you know you try
It's the worst case scenario lullaby

Something's gotta change
Something's gotta change
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on to something good

Something's gotta change
Something's gotta change
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on to something good

Try to sooth yourself to sleep my dear
You know this whole mess is born from fear
You keep the light on
You keep the light on
Keep the night light on

Keep the light on
The light on
The night light on
