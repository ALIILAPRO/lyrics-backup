		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Two hearts, one past i was your lover
Cruel words broke us you became another

I'm with the enemy in my bed
When the voice in my head
Tells me I should treat myself better
I know you don’t mean to be mean
When you’re hurting you'll see
You can see just how dark it is getting

So one hand is holding yours while
The other is waving goodbye
I love you, but it's your turn to cry
But one hand is holding yours while
The other is waving goodbye
I love you, but it's your turn to cry
It's your turn to cry

Poor you, so sad well I think it's time now
You’re too crying feel so bad
But can I lie down

The enemy in my bed
When the voice in my head
Tells me I should treat myself better
I know you don’t mean to be mean
When you’re hurting you'll see
You can see just how dark it is getting

So one hand is holding yours while
The other is waving goodbye
I love you, but it's your turn to cry
But one hand is holding yours while
The other is waving goodbye
I love you, but it's your turn to cry
It's your turn to cry

Feel my heart break feel my heart break
Feel my heart break
As I walk away (As I walk away)
Feel my heart break feel my heart break
Feel my heart break
As I walk away (As I walk away)

So one hand is holding yours while
The other is waving goodbye
I love you, but it's your turn to fight
But one hand is holding yours while
The other is waving goodbye
I love you, but it's your turn to cry
It's your turn to cry
It's your turn to fight
