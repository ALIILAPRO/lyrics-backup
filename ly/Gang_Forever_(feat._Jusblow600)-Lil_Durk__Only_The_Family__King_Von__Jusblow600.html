		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I done seen a killer get put on a stretcher
Love my brothers but we gotta do better
Gotta move around you ain't doing no better
Know a nigga switch up quick for that cheddar
Know one bitch suck dick for Margielas
Cant come around 'cause niggas to jealous
No sneak dissin' my niggas get extra
Gang, gang, gang, gang, gang forever

Gang, gang, gang, gang, gang forever
Gang, gang, gang, gang, gang forever
Gang, gang, gang, gang, gang forever
With my gang, gang forever
Gang, gang, gang, gang, gang forever
With my gang, gang, gang, gang, gang forever
With my gang, gang, gang, gang, gang forever
With my gang, gang, gang, gang, gang forever

Love my gang but we gotta do better
How you ridding and you told on the fellas
Ratatouille he gone snitch on some cheddar
Chase 'em down it don't matter the weather
Say its cappin' when I'm poppin' Margielas
Sneaky niggas tryna hold a vendetta
We was stuffin' thirty in a Beretta
Love my gang but we gotta do better

Case is federal baggin' is terrible
Streets on the schedule dope on a jet or two
Better go in 'cause this shit could get physical
I don't popped X and I mixed it with medical
I ain't never celebrate birthdays
I was down bad in the worst way
Why you come around in the first place
You gotta fuck blo on the first date
They say I'm an arrogant bastard
I hope in the coup and I smashed her
Won't see me again like Casper
Played your ass actor
Smoke my gas after
She be with the opps clap 'em
He died I don't know what happened
Spot news he trending after

Gang, gang, gang, gang, gang forever
Gang, gang, gang, gang, gang forever
Gang, gang, gang, gang, gang forever
With my gang, gang forever
Gang, gang, gang, gang, gang forever
With my gang, gang, gang, gang, gang forever
With my gang, gang, gang, gang, gang forever
With my gang, gang, gang, gang, gang forever

Bitch I'm wild insane forever
Keep your gone don't use you better
What these rats they want your cheddar
You cant name no niggas better
We get caught we gone forever
You get caught you out you tellin'
Killed that man 'cause he knew better
We gang bang, gang bang forever
We gang bang, gang bang forever
We gang bang, gang bang forever
We gang bang, gang bang forever
With my gang, gang forever
We gang bang, gang bang forever
We gang bang, gang bang forever
We gang bang, gang bang forever
With my gang, gang forever

With my gang, gang forever
With my gang, gang forever
