		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bite my hand (my hand)
Nothing of worth is ever coming to you (coming to you)
Fall into error and swim the sands (swim the sands)
Breathe through the dirt
Repeat your own point of view
We can learn to stand in no man's land (no man's land)

We fell in love with a death machine (death machine)
Too much will never be enough (be enough)
Push comes to shove but it's heresy just to be
Living is killing us
Living is killing us (is killing us)

Take the stand (take the stand)
God knows that there is nothing else you can do (else you can do)
Weaker together
A firebrand (firebrand)
Another rebel that'll split us in two
We're burning down a holy land

We fell in love with a death machine (death machine)
Too much will never be enough (be enough)
Push comes to shove but it's heresy just to be
Living is killing us

We built a home on a battleground
Misfortunes never come alone
Come quick, we've gotta turn this ship around
Fuck it, I'll do it on my own

We built a home on a battleground
Misfortunes never come alone
Come quick, we've gotta turn this ship around
Fuck it, fuck it, I'll do it on my own

We fell in love with a death machine (death machine)
Too much will never be enough (be enough)
Push comes to shove but it's heresy just to be
Living is killing us

We fell in love with a death machine (death machine)
Too much will never be enough (be enough)
Push comes to shove but it's heresy just to be
Living is killing us
