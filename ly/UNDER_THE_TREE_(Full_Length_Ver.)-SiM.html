		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Where are you at?
Where have you been?
問いかけに答えはなく

Where are we headed?
What did you mean?
追いかけても 遅く 遠く

A bird, a butterfly and my red scarf
Don't make a mess of memories
Just let me heal your scars
The wall, the owl, forgotten wharf
時が止まることもなく

We're getting older
Second, by second, by second

Why, oh, why
Why, oh, why
Don't you wanna stay with me?
Why, oh, why
Why, oh, why
Are you giving up on me?

I'll be waiting, waiting for you
Let me hold you under the tree
Under the tree
Ee-ee-ee
Ee-ee-ee-ee
I'll protect you
