		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They said I needed something in my life
Said I was doing dumb shit all the time
'Cause broken dreams won't pay your bills at all

I heard it was the wrong things I get right
I'm blaming all the monsters in my mind
With stories from outside these prison walls

'Cause even if we're hopeless
We know that this will hurt
Tomorrow is just a blur
And they can't control

Believers
Let's raise a toast
Enjoy the show, yeah
Believers
So incomplete
Yet all we need
Believers
Let's raise a toast
Enjoy the show

Said I wanna run but I'm terrified
Headed for the sun but I'm scared of heights
So you and me go falling through the dark (no, no)

Told me to be someone that I like
Instead of being someone in their eyes
Your battle scars make you look like a star (yeah)

'Cause even if we're hopeless
We know that this will hurt
Tomorrow is just a blur
And they can't control

Believers
Let's raise a toast
Enjoy the show, yeah
Believers
So incomplete
Yet all we need (oh yeah)
We are believers
Let's raise a toast
Enjoy the show

I want you to know that, believer
They can't control it, believer
I want you to know that, believer
They can't control it (they can't)

I want you to know that, believer
They can't control it, believer
I want you to know that, believer
They can't control it

No, they can't control it, ooh, ooh (hey)
