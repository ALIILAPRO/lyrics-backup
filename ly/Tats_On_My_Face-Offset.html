		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey
You know what I'm sayin'?
You know everything I do is legendary, you know what I'm sayin'?
I can never be stopped
I mean never

Tats on my face (Tats)
This Backwood an eighth (Hey)
Your trash, you're waste
I was on the Nawf smoking on shake (Nawf)
Thirty round on the Glock make you shake (Baow)
Chasing the bag, I race (Bag)
I make a plain bitch great (Plain bitch)
Look in his eyes, he hatin' (He hatin')
Feeling your vibe, you safe (I feel you)
Codeine survivor, patient (Woo)
Two mili' stashed in the basement (Two milli')
Thots want nails and laces (Huh?)
2019, I'ma take shit (Hah)
I do the green numbers, the Matrix (Matrix)
I got more M's than Macy's (M's)
Can't suck on no dick with braces (Nah)

How is you doin'? (Hi)
Not doing too well (Not doing too good)
I talk to myself (Who?)
In the mirror like, "Nigga, don't fail" (Nigga, don't fail)
I'm poppin' a pill (Poppin' em)
I keep thinking of death, I'ma kill (RIP)
They can't find my trail (They can't find me)
Tryna find myself (Tryna find me)
Quiet is kept (Shh)
Movin' in stealth (Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew)
McLaren seatbelts (Skrrt)
This how I felt (Hey, hey)
Jumped out the hole, whoa
Let's have a dripping contest (Whoa)
I couldn't afford the baguettes (Baguettes)
You can't survive without sex (Survive)
Bitch, I got M's, correct (M's)
Hundred round total, no wreck (Hey)
Two hundred thousand, bet (Yes)
Came from the 'partment with pest ('Partment)
Swerve on the bitch, hit the exit (Swerve)
Pour up the syrup with my breakfast (Syrup)
I go berserk when I'm flexing (Berserk)
Richard Mille, you get the message (Hey)
Blessings (Hey)

Tats on my face (Tats)
This Backwood an eighth (Hey)
Your trash, you're waste
I was on the Nawf smoking on shake (Nawf)
Thirty round on the Glock make you shake (Baow)
Chasing the bag, I race (Bag)
I make a plain bitch great (Plain bitch)
Look in his eyes, he hatin' (He hatin')

Hustler, hustler, hustler (Hustler)
I'm hiding the brick in the muffler (Hah)
It's a knock at my door, it's a customer (Fuck him up)
I can't leave with no fire, I'm uncomfortable (Fire)
Rap niggas sweet and they gullible (Sweet)
I'm poppin' shit like a toilet bowl (Ugh)
My lil' boy just made the honor roll (Woo)
Sipping codeine with no common cold (Hey)
I told you the truth
Hah, hah, laughing at you
I'm too geeked up, I can't even tie my shoe
Made the bitch shut up, I put her on mute (Shut up)
I'm balling, I'm dunking, I'm catching the oop (Ball)
Put on a plane with a tie and a suit
I'm a big dawg, you a big dawg, salute
I'm not gon' hate 'cause we make all the loot (Hey)
I am a bomb, nuclear, nuke (Ooh)
Bentayga three hundred, Richard Millie two (Woo)
I was 18, I was robbin' for two (Bags)
These niggas clique hoppin', these niggas be groupies (Woo)
Ain't stoppin', ain't floppin', I'm telling the truth (Truth)
Recorded the song with an M in the booth (Yeah)
I got a clue (Who?)
I send my dawg (Woof)
Get hit with the sawed-off, ooh

Tats on my face (Tats)
This Backwood an eighth (Hey)
Your trash, you're waste
I was on the Nawf smoking on shake (Nawf)
Thirty round on the Glock make you shake (Baow)
Chasing the bag, I race (Bag)
I make a plain bitch great (Plain bitch)
Look in his eyes, he hatin' (He hatin')
Feeling your vibe, you safe (I feel you)
Codeine survivor, patient (Woo)
Two mili' stashed in the basement (Two milli')
Thots want nails and laces (Huh?)
2019, I'ma take shit (Hah)
I do the green numbers, the Matrix (Matrix)
I got more M's than Macy's (M's)
Can't suck on no dick with braces (Nah)
