		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mornin' seeps through the blinds and joins us in bed and
You stir in your sleep, there goes fear embedding
What if I make you pancakes, but you choose to skip breakfast?
What if when you're fully awake, you come to your senses

Hours pass on the hood of your car, so little is said
I wait for your arms, but you gave your jacket instead
Am I at your disposal? You tell me I'm nice
But I know I'm only the hostel 'til there's a house that you like

It hasn't been long since the first kiss goodnight
Said I stole your heart, you called me a thief
This love's but a newborn, so why does it bite?
It hasn't even lost all its milk teeth
So why're you already anxious to leave?

I know soon enough we'll come apart at the seams
But just one empty kiss, and it's not as bad as it seems
We breathe for different reasons, both as petty I'd reckon
You for your, 'Well done's, and me for, 'You're welcome'

It hasn't been long since the first kiss goodnight
Said I stole your heart, you called me a thief
This love's but a newborn, so why does it bite?
It hasn't even lost all its milk teeth
So why're you already anxious to leave?
Ooh, oh
So why're you already anxious
To leave?
