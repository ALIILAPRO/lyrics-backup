		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby, it stung, now it's sweet
Watchin' you beg on your knees, oh my
Wipe my tongue 'cross your teeth
Just a little taste to remember me by
I'm the ice in your glass
I'm like the sand through your hands, oh my
Didn't know what you had
Gotta live with that for the rest of your life

I won't, won't lie
Last night I cried a little
Now I, I'm fine
Let you push me to the edge, 'bout to lose my mind

Understand it's out of your hands
Sleep tight where you've made your bed
Last kiss, leave your lips blood-red
Burning bridges, breaking dishes
Look, you made me something vicious
Understand it's out of your hands
Waste my time, better pay me respect
Last kiss, leave your lips blood-red
Burning bridges, breaking dishes
Look, you made me something vicious

Push you right to the edge
See you starting to sweat, oh my
Glad you have your regrets
Hope you feel like that 'til the day that you die
I'm the ice down your back
I'm like the sand through your hands, oh my
Didn't know what you had
Gotta live with that for the rest of your life

I won't, won't lie
Last night I cried a little
Now I, I'm fine
Let you push me to the edge, 'bout to lose my mind

Understand it's out of your hands
Sleep tight where you've made your bed
Last kiss, leave your lips blood-red
Burning bridges, breaking dishes
Look, you made me something vicious
Understand it's out of your hands
Waste my time, better pay me respect
Last kiss, leave your lips blood-red
Burning bridges, breaking dishes
Look, you made me something vicious

I won't, won't lie (won't lie)
Last night I cried a little
Now I, I'm fine
Let you push me to the edge, 'bout to lose my mind

Understand it's out of your hands
Sleep tight where you've made your bed
Last kiss, leave your lips blood-red
Burning bridges, breaking dishes
Look, you made me something vicious
Understand it's out of your hands
Waste my time, better pay me respect
Last kiss, leave your lips blood-red
Burning bridges, breaking dishes
Look, you made me something vicious
