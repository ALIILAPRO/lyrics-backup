		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't save time for the others
Couldn't save my life in the summer
She the only one that go stubborn
So fucked up, but I love her
Time move fast in the suburbs
All of their cash is a bother
I stay home for my mother
Others that'll never find recover
Watch me walk out
Spin me around
Heads still flip out
Making you proud
Watch me walk out
Spin me around
Heads still flip out
Making you proud
Am I making you proud
Am I making you proud
Am I making you proud
Special, special
You been upset I know
Devil, devil
You still dance with his cold
Special, special
Killed my thoughts long ago
Tremble, tremble
You still locked in that snow
Go back
King hail, like long last
Stings held, trust no act
Still fam that stab back
Front lines I'm on that
Crunch time we on that
Street signs, my bags packed
Washed eyes, dry laugh track
I can help myself
I been all alone
I'm the only one that know it
Ain't complaining though
I can help myself
I been all alone
I'm the only one that know it
Ain't complaining though
Special, special
You been upset I know
Devil, devil
You still dance with his cold
Special, special
Killed my thoughts long ago
Tremble, tremble
You still locked in that snow
