		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No you don't have to wear your best fake smile
Don't have to stand there and burn inside
Oh oh oh if you don't like it

She's working late and making eyes at the door
She's sick of everybody up on her floor
She wants the sun in her eyes but all she gets is ignored

She used to put it out and get it all back
But now she's slipping trying to carry the act
She's sweating under the lights, now she's beginning to crack

Woah

No you don't have to wear your best fake smile
Don't have to stand there and burn inside
Oh oh oh if you don't like it

And you don't have to care so don't pretend
Nobody needs a best fake friend
Oh oh oh don't hide it

No hesitation now she gets up and walks
She thinks of all the pain and pride that they caused
She emptied all the tip jars and won't get back what she lost

Outside the window with two fingers to show
She lifts her head up just to blow out the smoke
She doesn't have to look back to know where she's gotta go

No you don't have to wear your best fake smile
Don't have to stand there and burn inside
Oh oh oh if you don't like it

And you don't have to care so don't pretend
Nobody needs a best fake friend
Oh oh oh don't hide it

If you don't bleed it you don't need it anymore
If you don't need it get up and leave it on the floor
No more believing like it's a voice you can't ignore
If you don't need it you don't need it no

And you don't have to wear your best fake smile
Don't have to stand there and burn inside
Oh oh oh no if you don't like it

And you don't have to care so don't pretend
Nobody needs a best fake friend
Oh oh oh don't hide it

No you don't have to wear your best fake smile
Don't have to stand there and burn inside
Oh oh oh if you don't like it

Oh oh oh no if you don't like it
