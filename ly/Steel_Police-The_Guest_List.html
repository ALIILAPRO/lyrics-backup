		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take this pill 
It heals more than paper will 
You'll feel it coming over here over the hill and over him 
 
One more time 
You've lost all the passion in your eyes 
I feel it coming over here over the hill and over him 
Pulling on the shackles on my mind 
 
Two men and a gun 
Steel Police, Steel Police 
You sell your soul to the man 
Steel Police, Steel Police 
Go run on home to your mum 
Steel Police, Steel Police 
 
One more hit 
A flare from a sinking ship 
I feel it coming over here over the hill and over him 
Pulling on the shackles on my mind 
 
Two men and a gun 
Steel Police, Steel Police 
You sell your soul to the man 
Steel Police, Steel Police 
Go run on home to your mum 
Steel Police, Steel Police 
 
The lights they go around 
Don't fight, don't make a sound 
I feel it coming over here over the hill and over him 
The lights they go around 
Don't fight, don't make a sound 
 
Two men and a gun 
Steel Police, Steel Police (The lights they go around) 
You sell your soul to the man 
Steel Police, Steel Police (Don't fight, don't make a sound) 
Go run on home to your mum 
Steel Police, Steel Police (The lights they go around) 
You sell your soul to the man 
Steel Police, Steel Police (Don't fight, don't make a sound)
