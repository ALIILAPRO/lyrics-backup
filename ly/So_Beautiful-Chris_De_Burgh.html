		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm lying here tonight, thinking of the days we've had,
Wondering if the world would be so beautiful,
If I had not looked into your eyes,
How did you know that I've been waiting?
I never knew the world would be so beautiful at all;

I'm spending all the days, dreaming of the nights we've had,
I never knew that love would be a miracle,
When I think of all the ones before,
But now that I've found you I am flying,
I never knew that love would be so beautiful to me,
I never knew that love would be so beautiful to me;

And when we dance to the rhythm that is burning like a flame,
And when you touch me I can hardly move you take my breath away,
You give me all that I want to feel when we become as one,
And then you take me to the heaven of your heart;
Did nobody ever tell you, you're the best thing that has ever been;

Ah, you, ah, so beautiful, ah, so beautiful

I'm standing here tonight, thinking of the time we'll have,
I never knew that you would be so beautiful,
From the day you came into my life,
I just want to say, you make me happy,
I never knew that you would be so beautiful to me,
I never knew that you would be so beautiful to me;

So beautiful to me
So beautiful to me
So beautiful to me
To me;

I'm lying here tonight,
I'm dreaming here tonight,
I dance with you tonight
