		  Whoa
Whoa
Whoa
Whoa
Whoa
Whoa
Whoa
Whoa
Whoa

Ladies and gents, this is the moment you've waited for (whoa)
Been searching in the dark, your sweat soakin' through the floor (whoa)
And buried in your bones there's an ache that you can't ignore
Takin' your breath, stealing your mind
And all that was real is left behind

Don't fight it, it's coming for you, runnin' at ya
It's only this moment, don't care what comes after
Your fever dream, can't you see it gettin' closer?
Just surrender 'cause you feel the feeling takin' over (oh)
It's fire, it's freedom, it's floodin' open (oh)
It's a preacher in the pulpit and your blind devotion (oh)
There's something breaking at the brick of every wall, it's holding
All that you know (oh)
So tell me, do you wanna go?

Where it's covered in all the colored lights
Where the runaways are runnin' the night
Impossible comes true, it's takin' over you
Oh, this is the greatest show
We light it up, we won't come down
And the sun can't stop us now
Watching it come true, it's takin' over you
Oh, this is the greatest show

(Whoa) colossal we come these renegades in the ring
(Whoa) where the lost get found and we crown 'em the circus kings

Don't fight it, it's coming for you, runnin' at ya 
(Don't try to fight it, it's coming)
It's only this moment, don't care what comes after
(You know it's only this moment)
It's blindin', outshining (shining) anything that you know 
Just surrender 'cause you're comin' and you wanna go

Where it's covered in all the colored lights
Where the runaways are runnin' the night
Impossible comes true, intoxicatin' you
Oh, this is the greatest show
We light it up, we won't come down
And the sun can't stop us now
Watchin' it come true, it's takin' over you
Oh, this is the greatest show

It's everything you ever want
It's everything you ever need
And it's here right in front of you
This is where you wanna be (this is where you wanna be)
It's everything you ever want
It's everything you ever need
And it's here right in front of you (this is what you want)
This is where you wanna be
This is where you wanna be

When it's covered in all the colored lights
Where the runaways are runnin' the night (oh, oh yeah)
Impossible comes true, it's taking over you (hee)
Oh, this is the greatest show
We light it up, we won't come down
And the sun can't stop us now
Watching it come true, it's taking over you

This is the greatest show
When it's covered in all the colored lights
Where the runaways are runnin' the night
Impossible comes true, it's takin' over you
Oh, this is the greatest show
We light it up, we won't come down
And the walls can't stop us now
Watchin' it come true, it's takin' over you
Oh, this is the greatest show

'Cause everything you want is right in front of you
And you see the impossible is comin' true
And the walls can't stop us (now) now, (oh), yeah

This is the greatest show (oh)
This is the greatest show (oh)
This is the greatest show (oh)
This is the greatest show (oh)
This is the greatest show (oh)
This is the greatest show (oh)
(This is the greatest show)
This is the greatest show (oh) (this is the greatest)
This is the greatest show
