		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I walked in the party, no friends on my arm
You got my attention like a fire alarm
I don't want to lose ya, I don't want to lose ya
I'm just lookin' through ya, you see my Medusa

Money, money, money
Money, money, money
I just can't look away from it
I want it, want it, want it
When you try to leave
I got you paralyzed, fall for it every time

You got me screamin' at the top of my lungs
I must be dreamin' I can't get enough
You got me trippin' off that look in your eyes
What'd you do to me? I'm a sucker for green

Some is callin' it a sick obesssion
Nothin' wrong with bein' rich and blessed and
I just want a few yachts and mansions right now (right now, uh)
Birkin bags and big diamonds, droppin' racks on my island
Got a touch like a Midas
Touch it, touch it, love it, love it

Ooh, it's the way you keep lookin' at me
Ah, I can stand the heat of a million degrees (Fuego, oh)

Money, money, money (I just want your)
Money, money, money
I just can't look away from it
I want it, want it, want it

You got me screamin' at the top of my lungs
I must be dreamin' I can't get enough
You got me trippin' off that look in your eyes (let's go)
What'd you do to me? I'm a sucker for green
Forgot to mention, you stay in my head
You're my obsession, can't get out of bed
You got me trippin' off that look in your eyes
What'd you do to me? I'm a sucker for green

What would I do without ya? (Money)
We got a lil thang (Illuminati)
And I'm just lovin' that (cash, cash)
It's comin' and it's goin' so (fast, fast)
What would I do without ya? (Money)
We got a lil thang (Illuminati)
'Cause all I want is your dollar sign
Got me spendin' it all the time

Ooh, it's the way you keep lookin' at me
Ah, I can stand the heat of a million degrees (oh, Fuego, oh)

Money, money, money 
Money, money, money
I just can't look away from it
I want it, want it, want it

You got me screamin' at the top of my lungs
I must be dreamin' (I must be dreamin') I can't get enough
You got me trippin' off that look in your eyes
What'd you do to me? I'm a sucker for green
And I forgot to mention, you stay in my head
You're my obsession (you are my obsession), can't get out of bed
You got me trippin' off that look in your eyes
What'd you do to me? I'm a sucker for green

Big diamonds, my island
