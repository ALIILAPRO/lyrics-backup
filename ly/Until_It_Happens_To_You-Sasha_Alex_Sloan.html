		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You can have a friend get their heart broke
And you can be there when they need it most, but
You won't be the one falling off the deep end
You can have a friend lose somebody close
And you can be there when they need it most, but
You won't be the one having trouble sleeping

Somebody loses their somebody every day

But you'll never really know what it's like
'Til you wake up to some real bad news
You'll never really know how it feels
'Til it happens to you
No, you'll never really know what it's like
Even if you think you do
You'll never really know how it feels
'Til it happens to you

You can say sorry a million times
But even if you try, try to sympathize
You won't be the one picking up the pieces
You can do your best, call 'em every night
Listen to 'em say, say they're alright
But you know there's a chance they don't really mean it

Somebody loses their somebody every day

But you'll never really know what it's like
'Til you wake up to some real bad news
You'll never really know how it feels
'Til it happens to you
No, you'll never really know what it's like
Even if you think you do
You'll never really know how it feels
'Til it happens to you

You
'Til it happens to you

You'll never really know what it's like
'Til you wake up to some real bad news
You'll never really know how it feels
'Til it happens to you
No, you'll never really know what it's like
Even if you think you do
You'll never really know how it feels
'Til it happens to you
'Til it happens to you

(Somebody loses their somebody)
('Til it happens to you)
(Somebody loses their somebody every day)

You
Somebody loses their somebody
