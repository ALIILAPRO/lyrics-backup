		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If it was my last day on Earth
If it was my last day
If it was my last day on Earth
If it was my last day
If I close my eyes and the sun don't rise
Will I be okay?
If it was my last day on Earth
If it was my last day

If it was my last day on Earth, I wouldn't be in church
I'm sorry God but it's my last day in this universe
I need to see birds and buzzin' bees, green grass, evergreen trees
Not seeing people who have been mean to me
And why would I waste my time?
All my favourite people need teary-eye goodbyes
Talk, laugh, hug and give a bunch of hard high-fives
I did my best man
I gave this thing a good try

If it was my last day on Earth
If it was my last day
If it was my last day on Earth
If it was my last day
If I close my eyes and the sun don't rise
Will I be okay?
If it was my last day on Earth
If it was my last day

Wait, wait, wait
You're tellin' me I got 24 of these 60 minute things left?
Damn, I ain't get to be a billionaire yet
Fly around first class, private jet flex
Use a black Amex, get up out the duplexes
Buy a Lexus, take a road trip to a spaceship
Uh, and I'mma get on
Blast up in the sky and I'mma get gone
Gave up too much just to see one more dawn

If it was my last day on Earth
If it was my last day
If it was my last day on Earth
If it was my last day
If I close my eyes and the sun don't rise
Will I be okay?
If it was my last day on Earth
If it was my last day
