		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh-whoa-ooh
Ooh-whoa-ooh

Wiser, I should be wiser
Instead I'm too frightened to love again, oh
Trying, I should be trying
To figure out why I am the way that I am

I make memories
Got no one to share 'em with lately
'Cause nobody cares when you're lazy
Lazy with love, ooh-ooh

I gotta find somebody to lose already
No, I can't sit still because I'll get buried
Got my hopes up now but I ain't got many, no
I wanna die for someone
And find somebody to lose my head in
Nearly broke myself 'cause I got too selfish
Wanna fall in deep with a person I barely know
I wanna die for someone

Quiet, I stay quiet
I got enough violence goin' on in my mind, ooh
Guided, I'm misguided
Wastin' my time with easy goodbyes, ooh

I make memories
Got no one to share 'em with lately
'Cause nobody cares when you're lazy
Lazy with love, ooh-ooh

I gotta find somebody to lose already
No, I can't sit still because I'll get buried
Got my hopes up now but I ain't got many, no
I wanna die for someone
And find somebody to lose my head in
Nearly broke myself 'cause I got too selfish
Wanna fall in deep with a person I barely know
I wanna die for someone

Die, die, die, die for someone
Die, die, die, die for someone
Die, die, die, die for someone
I wanna die for someone
