		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bitch (You know what your problem is?
You never wanna take me out
All you wanna do is stay home and get high
Well, explain this to me
Every time I take you
Out, you complain that we don't get high
So which one is it?
Ugh, just shut up and turn up the music)
Since I was like 12
I'm up in a Scatpack runnin' from 12, yeah

Bitch
Yeah, you turned your back on me, I knew it
We talk love, yeah, I speak fluent
I was in love, but now I'm so clueless
Double G's on the belt
I told that bitch "I'ma see you in hell"
Sippin' on juice, since I was like 12
I'm up in a Scatpack, runnin' from 12, yeah
Fucking a bad bitch, feel like I'm drеaming
I got the stars on the roof, really glеaming
When I said "I love you"
You ain't say it back
She tryna sit on my lap
Yeah I like models and gas, stop
Just wait a minute
Make sure the windows tinted
Came with the racks out, don't wanna talk
Unless we talkin' 'bout some business
(Bitch) spin it back, smoking pack, i
Do not love you, i love racks
Yeah, my 'lil bro pop a tag
Switching lanes up in that Cat
G19, can't never lack
Lil' bitch, I'ma pioneer where my plaque?
Yeah, and this model bitch love my swag
This hoe better hope I ain't goin' out sad
(Bitch)
Changes, spilled lean on my Purple jeans
Block that bitch and hit "Delete"
I'm finna get necked up, then I leave
She kiss from the neck, up, yeah
I can't sleep
I told that bitch "Let go", yeah
I can't breathe
Knew from the get-go, now I can't leave
He turned to a gecko, he sip green

Yeah, you turned your back on me, I knew it
We talk love, yeah, I speak fluent
I was in love, but now I'm so clueless
Double G's on the belt
I told that bitch "I'ma see you in hell"
Sippin' on juice, since I was like 12
I'm up in a Scatpack, runnin' from 12, yeah
Fucking a bad bitch, feel like I'm dreaming
I got the stars on the roof, really gleaming
When I said "I love you"
You ain't say it back
She tryna sit on my lap
Yeah I like models and gas, stop
Just wait a minute
Make sure the windows tinted
Came with the racks out, don't wanna talk
Unless we talkin' 'bout some business
(Bitch)
