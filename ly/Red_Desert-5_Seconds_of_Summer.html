		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Red, red desert
Heal our blues
I dive deeper for you
What a blessing
To feel your love
Twilight moments with you

I've been asleep so long
I'm so far away
Visions I see are strong
I hear what they say
Won't you leave all your fears at the edge of the world
I'll tell you again like I told you before
I've been asleep so long
Wasting away

Tell me would you pack up all your bags, stay true to North?
You're the only one I do this for

Red, red desert
Heal our blues
I dive deeper for you
What a blessing
To feel your love
Twilight moments with you

It doesn't take too long (ah)
To heal and replace (ah)
The demons we're running from (ah)
They're begging to stay

Tell me would you pack up all your bags, stay true to North?
You're the only one I do this for

Red, red desert
Heal our blues
I dive deeper for you
What a blessing
To feel your love
Twilight moments with you

Red
Red
Red, red
Red, red

Red, red desert
Heal our blues
I dive deeper for you
(Diving deeper for you, diving deeper for you)
What a blessing
To feel your love
Twilight moments with you
(All these moments with you, all these moments with you)

Pack up all your bags, stay true to North
You're the only one I do this for
Red, red desert
Heal our blues
I dive deeper for you
