		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (C'mon)
My time to burn so sit back and check
The way I come through in the discotheque
I know you like what I got, my style
The original seventies dance floor hot new material
Name ain't down then you ain't coming in
Guest list on the door, you plus two friends
Just as long as they female and got a fit ass
Pole position never comin' in last

Bass line, yeah you know it's gonna get ya
Free your mind if the system will let ya
Peace time so it's time to shout
Guys in the back throw your hands about

Rock the party
We can go through the night
If you're living it up we're gonna let ya
If you're giving it up we're gonna get ya
Rock the party
If you're feeling all right
When you're having a good time together
And a Saturday night lasts forever

Yo can't hold me back, I rock the dance floor
Make a honey shake her booty so I kick it some more
You know the score how they rock a freaky move up on the spot
Never want to stop, temperature is hot
Now visual contact I got all that
Make 'em boogy for me when I verbally freak that
Line after line, keep on hitting with my rhyme
Now what you gotta do is bring your body next to mine
Check it out

Bass line, yeah you know it's gonna get ya
Free your mind if the system will let ya
Peace time so it's time to shout
Guys in the back throw your hands about

Rock the party
We can go through the night
If you're living it up we're gonna let ya
If you're giving it up we're gonna get ya
Rock the party
If you're feeling all right
When you're having a good time together
And a Saturday night lasts forever

Bass line is gonna get ya
On a Saturday night we're coming at ya

Bass line, yeah you know it's gonna get ya
Free your mind if the system will let ya
Peace time so it's time to shout
Guys in the back throw your hands about

Rock the party
We can go through the night
If you're living it up we're gonna let ya
If you're giving it up we're gonna get ya
Rock the party
If you're feeling all right
When you're having a good time together
And a Saturday night lasts forever
