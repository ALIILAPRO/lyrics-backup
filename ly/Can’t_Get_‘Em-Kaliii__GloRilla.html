		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  That's my motherfuckin' man
That's my motherfuckin' man
Bitch

You only want him 'cause I'm fuckin' him (goofy)
You the type of bitch that blow his phone up while I'm duckin' him (ugh)
Got him down bad, why you tryna see what's up with him? (Hah)
Walk around his crib in just my panties while you runnin' 'round in love with him (ooh)
He told me to tap in 'fore he get to tweakin' out (crazy)
Mad I never fucked him, no, he can't come to the house (nah)
Side hoes know to keep quiet, why the fuck you speakin' out? (Shh)
You used to be my biggest fan, what's all this beef about? (What happened?)

That nigga (that nigga?) 
That nigga (really?)
That ain't your nigga (that ain't your nigga) 
Bitch, that's my nigga (yeah, that's my shit)
I'm ridin' with him (I'm ridin', skrrt) 
I'm slidin' with him (I'm slidin', bitch)
And that's why every time you call him 
You can't get him (nah, you can't have him)
'Cause that's my nigga

Hey, Shelley, this Barbara
And, bitch, I'll beat your motherfuckin' ass 
You call my motherfuckin' phone again, ho
No, bitch, you need to go beat that nigga motherfuckin' ass 
If he call my motherfuckin' phone again
That's what's wrong with you hoes now

See, you the type of bitch that he can count on if he go to jail (stupid)
You can be that nigga peace, a bitch like me gon' give him hell (on God)
You tryna read that boy his rights, he buy me shit that I can't spell
You screamin' this your man, must be a secret, though, 'cause I can't tell (hmm)
Let that nigga give me brain, then leave that dumb shit up to you (dumbass)
You just gon' have to share him or just let him go, it's up to you
He can't possibly be in love with me (the fuck?), if he still in love with you
And stop tellin' folks it's up with me, 'cause I don't know what's up with you (bitch)
All up in your nigga bed (yup), watchin' all my favorite shows (haha)
And I'm on your nigga bad, come get me up off him, ho
You bitches is not my friends, y'all niggas is not safe
And since pussies got nine lives, I gotta get this pussy ate (on God)

That nigga (that nigga?) 
That nigga (really?)
That ain't your nigga (that ain't your nigga) 
Bitch, that's my nigga (yeah, that's my shit)
I'm ridin' with him (I'm ridin', skrrt) 
I'm slidin' with him (I'm slidin', bitch)
And that's why every time you call him 
You can't get him (Nah, you can't have him)
'Cause that's my nigga

Hey, Shelley, this Barbara
And, bitch, I'll beat your motherfuckin' ass
You call my motherfuckin' phone again, ho
No, bitch, you need to go beat that nigga motherfuckin' ass 
If he call my motherfuckin' phone again
That's what's wrong with you hoes now
