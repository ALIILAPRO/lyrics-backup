		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I fell in love with her blood red lips.
I went crazy when she moved her hips.
I wanna fuck her. She wants to fuck me
Cause I'm her lover and she's my lady.
The conversation start'd in a bar
When I spilled my beer in her bra.
She yelled at me and we started to fight.
That moment I knew that we will fuck for sure tonight.
Oh, I'm not a believer.
But after six tequilas I knew that we're soulmates.
She took me home and she took off her clothes.
I knew that tonight we're going deeper and deeper.

I never felt this way before
'Cause you're the girl that I adore.
I fell in love with you.
I fell in love with you again.
I never felt this way before.
I need your love and I want more.
I fell in love with you.
I fell in love with you again.

This was the best night of my life.
This was the best night of my whole fucking life.

It's been an unforgettable night.
Such a beauty in my arms.
Made all my wet dreams come true.
But the morning after I looked next to me
And reality hit me hard

'Cause there's a problem that I'm scared to describe.
My prom queen changed into a granny that night.
Saggy tits, fake teeth scared the shit out of me.
Oh, I fucked a zombie barbie.
Please God help me
'cause she makes me feel like I never felt before.
It's hard to admit she made me feel like a man
And it's still disgusting but I don't give a

I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck.
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck.

And everything she's got is more than I've ever wished.
She's a sexmachine. God's most beautiful gift.
She fucks as wild as an alligator
But after 15 mins I have to reanimate her.
Ohh and she's my movie star
Even if our romance is just more than bizarre.
It's a crazy story but the end is so sad.
My sweet granny princess fell in love with the death.

I gave my best for you.
I was searching for someone like you.
I gave my best for you.
I've been wishing this dream was true.

I don't care what they say.
Just stay by my side, baby.
You are the only one.
This is what I feel for you.
I don't care what they say
'cause you're the only one.
You are the one for me
And I just fucking love you cause
I don't give a fuck about superficiality
Because true beauty comes from the heart
