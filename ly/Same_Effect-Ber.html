		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My therapist told me that I, I think too much
And I'm still thinking about that
And then she said, said that I'm good
At taking a step
One step forward
And then two steps back
And I lie there half awake, stare at ceiling
While she explains it to me
Gives me her reasons
My therapist is your biggest fan
She mentions your name when I haven't asked
And I bet she's loving
You're pulling me right back

And I had to leave
The distance sucks, but every time we speak

You have the same effect
As the first day we met
I swear (mm, mm)
And I know we made a mess
But can we make amends?
Are we there yet? (Mm, mm)

Madeleine says I'm pretty bad at letting it all out
So she's coming over, and making me talk now
And now I'm convinced that everyone has a person they can't see
Someone they say they hate
But never wanna change

And I had to leave
The distance sucks, but every time we speak

You have the same effect
As the first day we met
I swear (mm, mm)
And I know we made a mess
But can we make amends?
Are we there yet? (Mm, mm)

I've got our songs in my head
And a knot in my chest
While I'm reading your texts again

'Cause you have the same effect
As the first day we met
I swear (mm, mm)

Mm, mm
Mm, mm
