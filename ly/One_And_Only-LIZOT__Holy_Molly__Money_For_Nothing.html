		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tears are running down your face
Don't you know it's too late?
I don't wanna hear you say you're sorry

So sad, you'll never find another me
But you know that, yeah, you know that now
Too bad, boy, you should get some therapy
But you know that, yeahy, you know that now

Tears are running down your face
Don't you know it's too late?
I don't wanna hear you say you're sorry, no
All of my love's erased
I'm someone that you can't replace
Now that you lost your one and only
Tears are running down your face
Don't you know it's too late?
I don't wanna hear you say you're sorry, no
All of my love's erased
I'm someone that you can't replace
Now that you lost your one and only

I bet you're caught up in some jealously
I can feel it, I can feel it now
I've said that someone else could fall for me
I can feel it, I can feel it now

Tears are running down your face
Don't you know it's too late?
I don't wanna hear you say you're sorry, no
All of my love's erased
I'm someone that you can't replace
Now that you lost your one and only
Tears are running down your face
Don't you know it's too late?
I don't wanna hear you say you're sorry, no
All of my love's erased
I'm someone that you can't replace
Now that you lost your one and only

Your one and
Your one and one only
I don't wanna hear you say you're sorry, no
Your one and
Your one and one only
Now that you lost your one and only
