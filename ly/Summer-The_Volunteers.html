		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Our eyes are closed
But we know when the sun is near us
We'll be in love forever
My door had been ripped out somehow
But now it's constantly fixed by you
I hate to admit it

Don't you let me slip away
When I fight for silly things
Don't show your back to me
When we fall down together
Don't you let me get away
When I pretend to be okay
Promise I'll be true to you

But somehow we will realize
Someday we'll stand here by the sun
Don't let me get away

Our eyes are closed
But we know when the sun is near us
We'll be in love forever
My door had been ripped out somehow
But now it's constantly fixed by you
I hate to admit it

Don't you let me slip away
When I fight for silly things
Don't show your back to me
When we fall down together
Don't you let me get away
When I pretend to be okay
Promise I'll be true to you

But somehow we will realize
Someday we'll stand here by the sun
Don't let me get away
