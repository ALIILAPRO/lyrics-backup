		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  State of life, may i live, may i love
Coming out the sky, i name me a name
Coming out silver word for what it is
It is very nature of the sound, the game

Shablamidi, shablamida
Shablamidi, shablamida
Shablamidi, shablamida

Siamese, indonese, to tibet treat the life
As a game, if you please (hey)
Coming up caribee such a freedom
Derives from a meditative state
Movin' on, believe that's it, call it magic
Third world, it is, i only guessed it

Shablamidi, shablamida
Shablamidi, shablamida
Shablamidi, shablamida

Shablimidi, shablamida
Shablimidi, shablamida
Shablimidi, shablamida

Shot to the soul the flame of oroladian
(the) essence of the word
The state of independence

Sounds like a signal from you
Bring me to meet your sound
And i will bring you to my heart

Love, like a signal you call
Touching my body, my soul
Bring to me, you to meet me here

Home, be the temple of your heart
Home, be the body of your love
Just like holy water to my lips
(hey, hey)

Yes, i do know how i survive
Yes, i do know why i'm alive
To love and be with you
Day by day by day by day

Time, time again, it is said
We will hear, we will see
See it all in his wisdom hear

His truth will abound the land
This truth will abound the land
This state of independence shall be
This state of independence shall be

Say, yeah -e-yay, yeah-e-yo
Yeah-e-yay, yeah-e-yo...
Be the sound of higher
Love today
Yeah-e-yeah (hey, hey)

Time, time again, it is said
We will hear, we will see
See it all in his wisdom hear

His truth will abound the land
This truth will abound the land
This state of independence shall be
This state of independence shall be
This state of independence shall be
This state of independence shall be
This state of independence shall be...
