		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Say what you want, this is true romance
I know you're older, but I really know I'm sure (I really know I'm sure)
Held my ticket since they landed at my door (landed at my door)
I've been a fan of you since two-thousand-and-four

You know you got me
So much I took my loving over there (loving over there)
I got a tattoo just to show how much I care (show how much I care)
But there's so many girls around you that I'm scared (scared)

Tell me, do you view me the same?
Or do you call me a stranger (stranger) a stranger (-ger)
'Cause, baby, I don't care about the fame
Tell me, why I don't play about you
Every song is about you (about you) about you (you)
And everybody's shoutin' out your name

I'm in the crowd, can you see my hand?
Bring me on tour, help me understand
I told you once before, this is true romance (true romance)
And now I can't be your friend, this is true romance

Tell me, do you view me the same?
Or do you call me a stranger (stranger) a stranger (-ger)
'Cause, baby, I don't care about the fame
Tell me, why I don't play about you
Every song is about you (about you) about you (you)
And everybody's shoutin' out your name

(Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah) (Name)
(Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah) (Name) (I'm in the crowd, can you see my hand?)
(Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah) (Can you see my hand?)
(Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
