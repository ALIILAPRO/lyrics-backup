		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's been a long hard day
And a long hard night
Been a hard year
Its been a hard life
But we're together
And that's all that matters now

Well the time has come
And the time has gone
Maybe I was born to be aloe
But we're together
And that's all that matters now

Been thrown by the wind
Drowned in the rain
I Walked through some things
You don't want me to explain
But we're together
And that's all that matters now

I can't get well
There's no cure for life
Let me down easy
At least tonight
We're together
And that's all that matters now
