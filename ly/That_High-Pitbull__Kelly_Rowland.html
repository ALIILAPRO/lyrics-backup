		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you came to get
If you came to get
If you came to get

If you came to get crazy
Then you came to the right place
DJ, drop, drop the bass
Shut down the place
Show these jokers who got the ace
These girls got sex written on their face
I'm in the zone ah
About to conquer everything like Rome
I'm feeling golden
Can't stop 'em, can't control 'em
Only hope to contain unless if you know 'em
Now it's time to get get get crazy
Get get get loose, get get get wild
Right right right now
Let's take over the world
Your way girl

So give me that high
Like you did last night, did last night
'Cause I was high
When you made me fly (made me fly)

So give me that high
Like you did last night, did last night
'Cause I was high
When you made me fly (made me fly)

I'm a biggidy mic checker, on biggidy big records
A biggidy big playboy with women for breakfast
You're mistaking if you're thinking it's just a song
This my life from dusk 'til dawn
I'm not the best, I'm just better
Yeah, they smart
Me? I'm clever
At 45 thousand feet
You think I care about the weather?
Okay, maybe a little
Turbulence is like fame
It's hard to get used to, especially with Youtube
Hah!
I know this different, ain't princess
And I ain't talkin about Lorenas in tutus
Hah!
Real life James Bond
Killin 'em in suits then choppin up the deuces
Hah!
Now let's take over the world
And let's do it your way girl

So give me that high
Like you did last night, did last night
'Cause I was high
When you made me fly (made me fly)

So give me that high
Like you did last night, did last night
'Cause I was high
When you made me fly (made me fly)

Harmandito pere
Kelly Rowland, esta mo blando viole
All them claimin' they know me but I don't know Romy
Or her friend's sister Naomi
I done put it my work
So every day is 15th and the first
Every day we sip vole
Every day we get crazy

He's telling me, me, me
He going high, high, high
He's telling me, me, me
He going high

So give me that high
Like you did last night, did last night
'Cause I was high
When you made me fly (made me fly)

So give me that high
Like you did last night, did last night
'Cause I was high
When you made me fly (made me fly)

Fly, fly, oh
Give me that high
