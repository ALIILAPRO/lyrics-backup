		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Who loves the sun?
Who cares that it makes plants grow?
Who cares what it does
Since you broke my heart?

Who loves the wind?
Who cares that it makes breezes?
Who cares what it does
Since you broke my heart?

Ba-ba-ba-ba
Who loves the sun?
Ba-ba-ba-ba
Who loves the sun?
Ba-ba-ba-ba
Not everyone
Ba-ba-ba-ba
Who loves the sun?

Who loves the rain?
Who cares that it makes flowers?
Who cares that it makes showers
Since you broke my heart?

Who loves the sun?
Who cares that it is shining?
Who cares what it does
Since you broke my heart?

Ba-ba-ba-ba
Who loves the sun?
Ba-ba-ba-ba
Who loves the sun?
Ba-ba-ba-ba
Not everyone
Ba-ba-ba-ba
Who loves the
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, sun

Ba-ba-ba-ba
Who loves the sun?
Ba-ba-ba-ba
Who loves the sun?
Ba-ba-ba-ba
Not just anyone
Ba-ba-ba-ba
Who loves the sun?

Ba-ba-ba-ba
Who loves the sun?
Ba-ba-ba-ba
Who loves the sun?
