		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Aye
Look at me now
I did it all they wondering how
Come to my city and copy my style
They want to be me
That ain't allowed
I never want to be part of the crowd
Good on my own, don't need 'em around
I beat 'em all now they want to test me
I be a legend like Lionel Messi
Back to ballin' I be lapping all of 'em
Looking for a new pack to roll 'em in
Labels mad 'cuz they all been offering
Realizing they can't control the kid
I be rolling like the secret service
I'm presidential I be moving urgent
Nowadays I'm only in the suburbs
When hopping into that new suburban
Could've given up back then
Never would've known how my life would end up
I been on top and I been on ten
Nothing ever changed I still been fed up
Got it on lock and I won't let 'em in
Coming for my spot but they cannot catch up
I started this shit as a hobby and look where it got me
I went from my room to the coast of Amalfi
Look at me now
I did it all they wondering how
Come to my city and copy my style
They want to be me
That ain't allowed
I never want to be part of the crowd
Good on my own, don't need 'em around
I beat 'em all now they want to test me
I be a legend like Lionel Messi
Nobody been coming close
Put in the work more than ever before
Out of this world and I been a star
Know that I've always been better than most
Or better than all
Idols becoming my rivals
Be ready for my arrival
Imma takeover
They melatonin the way they be sleeping on me
But I know that my time getting closer
Wake up
Out of your league I'm way up
I don't got time for a hater
And I feel bad for my neighbors
When I be working 'til three in morning
Shaking the walls that's how I'm recording
All of my songs be hitting
The bass be hitting
And these other rappers are boring, damn
Look at me now
I did it all they wondering how
Come to my city and copy my style
They want to be me
That ain't allowed
I never want to be part of the crowd
Good on my own, don't need 'em around
I beat 'em all now they want to test me
I be a legend like Lionel Messi
