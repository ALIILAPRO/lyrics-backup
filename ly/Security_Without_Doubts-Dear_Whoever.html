		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Forever is not long enough 
For everything you have for me

Now this took me by surprise
I can grasp the best part of my life. 
So I waited for the right way to state the stated 
Just the other day We would say forever.

I lost myself when I saw you
I took your hand and placed it in mine 
To be with you forever here on after

It wasn't hard for me to figure out
Security without any doubts. 
So I waited for the right way to state the stated 
Just the other day we would say

Forever is not long enough 
For everything you have for me. 

Forever is not long enough 
For everything you have for me. 
(Say forever)

I cannot take this in, 
I've been dead for far too long as it is, 
Take no regrets, instead embrace this, 
And we will take our, harmony.

I lost myself when I saw you
I took your hand and placed it in mine 
To be with you forever here on after
