Mom won't know
Run out the back door
He's passed out on the floor
Third time
Been caught twice
Forgive our neighbor Bob
I think he humped the dog

But good things come to those who wait
'Cause she laid me
And mom and dad possess the key
Instant slavery
No need explain the plan
No need to even bother
I'll pack my bags, I swear I'll run
Wish my friends were twenty-one

White lies
Bloodshot eyes
Breath of alcohol
Stole it from the mall
How's Chris
Marked with lipstick
Better call their fathers
Sleeping with your daughters

But good things come to those who wait
'Cause she laid me
And mom and dad possess the key
Instant slavery
No need explain the plan
No need to even bother
I'll pack my bags, I swear I'll run
Wish my friends were twenty-one

You don't belong
You left the kids to carry on
You planned their fall
Too bad you're wrong
Don't need a mom dad slave drive song
I time bomb
I time bomb
I time bomb
I time bomb
I time bomb

Turn low
The radio
I think I hear my dad
Yelling at the band

But good things come to those who wait
'Cause she laid me
And mom and dad possess the key
Instant slavery
No need explain the plan
No need to even bother
I'll pack my bags, I swear I'll run
Wish my friends were twenty-one

You don't belong
You left the kids to carry on
You planned their fall
Too bad you're wrong
Don't need a mom dad slave drive song
I time bomb
I time bomb
I time bomb
I time bomb
I time bomb
I time bomb
I time bomb
I time bomb
I time bomb
