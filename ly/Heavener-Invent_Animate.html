		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I will wait, as I'm already home, I'm already home
I will stay, if you're all on your own
Heavener

As water falls on where we slept, 
show what you saw and what you felt 
All in pain, hurt by the rain
Stuck in the same place
where we wept

So I will wait, cus I'm already home, I'm already home
I will stay, if you're all on your own, you won't be alone here with me

Sunshine, my light, you hold my heart
Sealed and untouched, afar 
Yeah you swim in pain, hurt by the rain
Stuck in a place, where we wept  

I will wait, as I'm already home, I'm already home
I will stay, if you're all on your own, you won't be alone 

the clouds will part
the sun will smile
and burn away the fear inside
My heart, my soul 
be with me til the end 
Stay awake my heavener

I will wait, as I'm already home, I'm already home
I will stay, if you're all on your own, you won't be alone here with me
