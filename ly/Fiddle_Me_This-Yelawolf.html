		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Before I say goodbye
I'd like to say good day
And I hope you say "good buy"
When they ask was it worth for you to pay
For my music, for pressin' play
For all the stress that went into my songs
My love and hate
The most honest I could be with you to date
Is to say thank thank you Shady
For lettin' me be me with no holds barred
Thank you for the chance to enhance this old car
This old jar of moonshine is but
Two fine lines on a blank sheet but so far
These two lines point directed to my home on the mothership sonar
Valet UFOs, I go park

The dirty south needs a soap bar
In the mouth of these MCs but
But who am I to judge on what they love?
I guess they enjoy being broke and co-stars
And I'm soakin' so hard
From the sweat that I could take my clothes off
I done fucked and raped the whole yard
Should sit back and shake the gold off
But I'm already gone
I got a vision like Teller, sons
In an envelope like letters
Lettuce, green, money, long
Wolfpacks in a calzone
I'll keep makin' these albums
Yeah you might have heard a dial tone
But I was on the other line when I hung up the phone
I'll send a postcard when I leave
I think about you when I dream
And when I'm up under the high beams
I reflect that shining
So you can feel the heat of light
A life of violence 'til I die in
Yeah I've done come a long way
From Dixie Land, take my hand

I'm talkin' lowriders, 77 Devilles
L-Dogs, nothin' but them 'Lacs
Sittin' on boxes in the front yard of the trailer park, yeah
One time for the single wives and the little cribs (one time)
Two times if you know what it's like to fuckin' live (two times)
Three times in a row you've been late on the rent (three)
Four times before you did the same old shit, yeah

Baby done grown up, workin' that bid like a grown up
Fuckin' toned up, let the Glock talk, I'ma gon' hush
Just like daddy taught me
Wait I didn't have one
Fuck it, I'm happy for him
'Cause he got a bad one
I popped outta that Easy Bake
Land of the 'Bama, clean and safe
Dropped outta high school, reason, hey
I'm already high from a seedless egg
And they wonder why I speak this way
And ye ain't ever seen this place
Well here's your American pie
It's a Dixie piece of cake
