		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I hear the first sets going by
Watching myself slowly die
Sharp is the pain leadin' through my heart
Slowly tearing me apart

What if you're an angel fallen from grace?
Yes, the fist that I hate
Pick me up from the gutter with a gentle kiss
The rips from my heart is showing me, how black it is!

Go!
Yeah I'll go!
It feels so cold
Yeah, I'm watching by
I'll die alone!

I hear the first sets walking by
Watching myself slowly die
Sharpening pain leadin' through my heart
Slowly tearing me apart

When you appear, as an angel
Looking me down, looking my way
Could you ever kill the pain in my heart?
Even though they say angels don't kill

Go!
Yeah I'll go!
It feels so cold
Yeah, I'm watching by
I'll die alone
Go!
Yeah I'll go
It feels so cold
Yeah, I'm watching by
I'll die alone!!
