		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Honey i can feel, all your tears from the past
And honey i can hear, voices that you try to hide

Mmm

Now you dont have to be scared again, your scars has started to heal
Cause baby im here, hold you under a thousand lights
Under a thousand lights


And if the lights gone off
You know i'd still hold you tight
if the sky is falling down
I'd give you all my warmth
Wooah..
I'll be by your side
I'll be by your side, alright?


No matter how hard, you're still who you are
An angel with no perfections 
Ohh you dont need wings to fly
And baby i know, its never been easy
But baby im here, hold you under a thousand lights
Under a thousand lights


And if the lights gone off
You know i'd still hold you tight
if the sky is falling down
I'd give you all my warmth
Wooah..
I'll be by your side
I'll be by your side


Wooah2x
Aaaaah2x


And if the lights gone off
You know id still hold you tight
And if the sky is falling down
I'd give you all my warmth 
Wooah ill be by your side
Wooah ill be by your side..


And if the lights gone off
You know id still hold you tight
if the sky is falling down
Id give you all my warmth
Wooah ill be by your side
And if u ever feel scared again
Just feel my beating heart
Cause ill be by your side..
Ill be by your side, 
Ill be by your side,
Ill be by your side,
alright?
