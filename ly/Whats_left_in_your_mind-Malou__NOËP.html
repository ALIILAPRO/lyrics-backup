		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lean upper high when I say your mind
May never will, when you look into my eyes
By now you trend for a little more
Forget all the best day, what's left in your mind?
Maybe I tweaked it
I might have this one thing, life, but love
For your mean thoughts
So I act on my things that I love

What's left in your mind? Little more
What's left in your mind? (Act on my things that I love)
What's left in your mind? Little more
What's left in your mind? (Act on my things that I love)

Lean upper high when I say your mind
May never will when you look into my eyes
By now you trend for a little more
Forget all the best day, what's left in your mind?
Maybe I tweaked it
I might have this one thing, life, but love
For your mean thoughts
So I act on my things that I love
What's left in your mind?

What's left in your mind?
What's left in your mind?
What's left in your mind? (For a little more)
What's left in your mind?
