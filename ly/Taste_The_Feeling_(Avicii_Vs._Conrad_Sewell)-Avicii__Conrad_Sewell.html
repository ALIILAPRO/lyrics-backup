		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It feels good, in my heart, in my soul,
When you're right here beside me
I don't ever want this day to end

We can watch the waves, have a Coke
And you sit here beside me
Take a little long my heart again
So we can feel whatever you feel
Together be real, together and

No one can stop me when I taste that feeling
Nothing could ever bring me down
No one can stop me when I taste that feeling
Nothing could ever bring me down

You make it easier to sing it
You make it easier to sing it

Feels good as we stand on the shore
And now our hearts are jumping
Grab another Coke and let's dive in
Oh, my love, there's a song in my soul
When you are around me
You make it easier to sing it
So we can feel whatever you feel
Together be real, together at

No one can stop me when I taste that feeling
Nothing could ever bring me down
No one can stop me when I taste that feeling
Nothing could ever bring me down

With every fading sunset
We see the stars aligned
We make the simple moments last for a lifetime
So, we can feel forever
You and me, together
We stay free forever
And be real together

No one can stop me when I taste that feeling
Nothing could ever bring me down
No one can stop me when I taste that feeling
Nothing could ever bring me down
You make it easier to sing it
You make it easier to sing it
