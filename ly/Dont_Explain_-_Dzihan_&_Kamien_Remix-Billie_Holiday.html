		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hush now, don't explain
Just say you'll remain
I'm glad you're back, don't explain

Quiet, don't explain
What is there to gain
Skip that lipstick
Don't explain

You know that I love you
And what love endures
All my thoughts of you
For I'm so completely yours

Cry to hear folks chatter
And I know you cheat
Right or wrong don't matter
When you're with me, sweet

Hush now, don't explain
You're my joy and pain
My life's yours, love
Don't explain

You know that I love you
And what love endures
Nothing rates above you
For I'm so completely yours

Cry to hear folks chatter
And I know you cheat
Right or wrong don't matter
When you're with me, sweet

Hush now, don't explain
You're my joy and pain
My life's yours, love
Don't explain
