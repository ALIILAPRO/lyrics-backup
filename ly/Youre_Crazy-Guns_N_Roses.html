		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been lookin' for a trace
Lookin' for a heart
Lookin' for a lover in a world
That's much too dark
You don't want my love
You want satisfaction oh yeah
You don't need my love
You got to find yourself another
Piece of the action, yeah

Said where you going
What you going to do
I've been looking everywhere
I've been looking for you

You don't want my love
You want satisfaction
I have got your satisfaction
You don't need my love
You got to find yourself another
Piece of the action

Because you're crazy hey hey
You're fucking crazy oh my
You know you're crazy oh child
I said you're crazy ay, ay, yeah
Yeah, aow
Oh!
Oh 

Say, boy, where you coming from
Where would you get that point of view
When I was younger said I knew someone like you

And they said you don't want my love
You want to satisfaction yeah
You don't need my love
You have got to find yourself another
Piece of the action

'Cause you're crazy, hey hey
You're fucking crazy, oh my
You know you're crazy, oh child
I said you're crazy
Oh, you're crazy
You know you're crazy
Well, you're crazy
You know you're crazy, oh
You know you are
Bring it down you're fuckin' crazy
