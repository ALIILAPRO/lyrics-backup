		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I need some time alone
Cold, my rhymes will turn your mind to stone
That's the work of Satan, niggas be hating but I'm a pot of gold
This ain't just me rapping, it's real and something you gots to know
Catch a mark nigga hating, get him a casket, that bastard's 'bout to go, whoa
Nasty baby I'm crazy the 90's raised me
I'm just as smart, probably smart as half the cats who play me
Brazy, dropping miss daisy hand on my strap
In my zone mind on my money like where that shit at?
I'm all alone that's my only hope
And be damned if I'mma chase that with some phony homes
On the real, it be the ones that say we got this, that you ain't alone
As long as I'm here to pull out that Glock 9 and cocked it
He mad you got rich but on the low you should've watched him
Cats conniving, head first into the livest object
That was your man now you 'bout to die quick over some fly shit
You feel reminded of your fast life ventures and winters
Blinded to the flashlight enters

I got a funky, funky style with a funky swag
I got a funky, funky style with a funky swag
I bought the funky, funky Nikes, got the hat to match
I bought the funky, funky Nikes, got the hat to match
I got a funky, funky style with a funky swag
I got a funky, funky style with a funky swag
And when I kill 'em with the flow ain't no coming back
And when I kill 'em with the flow ain't no coming back

I got a poor man's panache, I be stretching the cash
I'm a little passive aggressive, you get a stretcher when I'm mad
For the line, manic depressive, rappers stressin' me bad
Got too many less than impressive rappers left in my path
Better yet, we gonna leave 'em left in the past
Someone slides, this time I ride, you get left in the back
Who am I? I'm a titan so be expecting a clash
Start to waving arms at you, you'd think I'm catching a cab
No questions 'cause the answers
Look at Meth, breaking bad like he cooking meth in the lab
Still a lethal weapon but try and bless him with math
Rappers never learn their lesson so I ain't lettin' 'em pass
I ain't lettin' 'em brag, I ain't lettin' 'em swag
Fuck swag, just being blunt, while I'm plucking my ash
Y'all ain't up in my class in the building
It's A$AP Meth, quick to kill 'em, that's an ASAP death

I got a funky, funky style with a funky swag
I got a funky, funky style with a funky swag
I bought the funky, funky Nikes, got the hat to match
I bought the funky, funky Nikes, got the hat to match
I got a funky, funky style with a funky swag
I got a funky, funky style with a funky swag
And when I kill 'em with the flow ain't no coming back
And when I kill 'em with the flow ain't no coming back

Straight out the back, dog, I'm Shaq strong, I'm breaking backboards
Draped in Tommy, my bitch beside me, young god body
I play the back of clubs, click a file, young as a
Fools get rowdy, ain't nothing dumb, my guns from Saudi
High off the Maui, don't trip your weed, rollin' a fonzi
You know the fronto, send to your guapo, I'm head honcho
I sport the poncho, connect Vassandro, the illest y'all know
Killing 'em pronto, my funky fresh is filthy, designer
But check my rhymes, though, my verse is like atomic bombs, yo
Haters like side hoes, I peel off in the illest Tahoe
Watch out for potholes, H leanin', that's why he drive slow
Nast Diablo, the 90's era shit in effect
Clowns be watching, best protect yah necks

I got a funky, funky style with a funky swag
I got a funky, funky style with a funky swag
I bought the funky, funky Nikes, got the hat to match
I bought the funky, funky Nikes, got the hat to match
I got a funky, funky style with a funky swag
I got a funky, funky style with a funky swag
And when I kill 'em with the flow ain't no coming back
And when I kill 'em with the flow ain't no coming back
