		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I gotta tell you the truth
I'm full of broken pieces
And all my nights are sleepless
And I don't mean to intrude
This secret can you keep it?
Won't give up even if it

Takes me all night,
Takes my whole life,
Just won't feel right, (until I have you)
Tired eyes burn,
When will I learn?
Tell me what to do

I don't wanna go to bed
I don't wanna go to bed (no)
I don't wanna go to bed
I don't wanna go to bed without you

I don't wanna go to bed
I don't wanna go to bed (no)
I don't wanna go to bed
I don't wanna go to bed without you

Let's get this out of the way
Why should we wait forever?
We're meant to be together
I'm not ashamed to say (let me tell you one time)
You don't remember my name
But I still want you the same

Love at first sight,
Left me tongue tied,
Just won't feel right 
(Until I have you)
Tired eyes burn,
When will I learn?
Tell me what to do (tell me what to do)

(I'm sayin') I don't wanna go to bed
I don't wanna go to bed (no)
I don't wanna go to bed
I don't wanna go to bed without you

I don't wanna go to bed
I don't wanna go to bed (no)
I don't wanna go to bed
I don't wanna go to bed without you

I don't wanna go to bed without ya
No you no lie no sleep without ya
Go crazy in the, I go crazy without ya
E'ry dream, e'ry nightmare's about ya, I
Can't lie, got love at first sight
Love the first night, I took my first bite, I'm
Insane when I take aim, like,
King James with the mid-range bang!

Love at first sight,
Left me tongue tied,
Just won't feel right 
(Until I have you)
Tired eyes burn,
When will I learn?
Tell me what to do (ah, ah, ah, yeah)

I don't wanna go to bed (I don't wanna go to bed)
I don't wanna go to bed (I don't wanna go to bed)
I don't wanna go to bed
I don't wanna go to bed without you

I don't wanna go to bed
I don't wanna go to bed (no)
I don't wanna go to bed
I don't wanna go to bed without you

I don't want to go to bed (I don't wanna go)
I don't want to go to bed (I don't wanna go)
I don't want to go to bed
I don't want to go to bed without you

I don't wanna go to bed without ya
No you no lie no sleep without ya
This is Simple Plan Shorty!

I don't want to go to bed without you!

I said
I don't wanna go to bed without ya
No you no lie no sleep without ya
No you no sleep!

I don't want to go to bed without you
