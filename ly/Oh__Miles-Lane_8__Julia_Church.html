		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, Miles you changed this life for good
It spins in ways I never thought it could
Take all that we have grown and watch how it still blooms
Though I'm far from you

Oh, Miles I wish you could've stayed
Not only 'cause I feel your hurt the same
We push and pull and tried to stop the rain that left us soaked
I miss you the most

Oh, Miles where did you go?
When these are the times I need you the most
Oh my, what have I thrown away?

Away, away, away
Away, away, away, away
Away, away, away, away
Away, away, away, away
Away, away, away, away
Away, away, away, away
Away, away, away, away
Away, away, away, away
Away, away, away, away

Oh, Miles I hope you find the girl
That sends a shiver through your world
To watch the moment the sun disappears behind the hill
Our little world so still

Oh, Miles where did you go?
When these are the times I need you the most
Oh my, what have I thrown away?

Away, away, away
Away, away, away, away
Away, away, away, away
Away, away, away, away
Away, away, away, away
Away, away, away, away
Away, away, away, away, away

You found a way when nobody else was holding on
But I couldn't wait couldn't feel the way it was before
You found a way when nobody else was holding on
But I couldn't wait couldn't feel the way it was before
