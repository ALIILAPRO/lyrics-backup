		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  That's my model bitch, I love her (my model bitch)
Talk her shit, but fine as shit and softer than a feather (yeah)
Pull out your camera, take a pic' 'cause she look fly as ever (okay)
Poppin shit, poppin' shit
That's my gangster bitch, I love her (my gangster bitch)
Yeah, if I get my fye', know that she gon' bust it (yeah)
Yeah, and she down to ride, said that shit ain't nothin' (yeah, yeah)
And she ride or die, huh
Yeah, she ridin', (ridin'), huh, yeah, she ridin'
Love my mean bitch, what's up?
And she got an attitude, we always fussin' (we always fussin')
Yeah, her ass fat and she let me touch it (she let me touch it)
Huh, she just look so pretty, yeah, when we fucking (when we fucking)
Pop it, pop it, pop it, yeah, shit poppin' (pop it, pop it)

She pussy poppin' (pop it)
She bottle poppin' (pop it, pop it)
New pint, crack the seal open, watch it drop
That purple fallin', shawty, nah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
All I got, ya dig?
Ain't on shit, hell nah, no, they not that guy
Purple, what I sip, baby, I'm high, yeah, I'm way too high
What about what I smoke out the bag, can she tell or not
O-P-I-U-M, what I bleed 'til the day I die
Blood red, yeah, that's what I bleed 'til the day I die
And R.I.P. to all the OGs that came before I
I was so damn fire, I was really outside (outside)
Told my mama I'm gon' be rich, I looked her dead in the eye
And now I'm so damn rich, I never told a lie
And I ain't goin' for shit, nigga, no, not I (yeah, yeah)
But I hop in the whip with the stick, know I'm ready to ride
Gotta call up man for the blitz, know they ready to slide (ready to slide)
Hope you ready to die

(That's my, that's my, that's my)

That's my model bitch, I love her (my model bitch)
Talk her shit, but fine as shit and softer than a feather (yeah)
Pull out your camera, take a pic' 'cause she look fly as ever (yeah)
Poppin shit, poppin' shit
That's my gangster bitch, I love her
Yeah, if I get my fye', know that she gon' bust it (bust it, bust it)
Yeah, and she down to ride, said that shit ain't nothin' (that ain't nothin')
And she ride or die, huh
Yeah, she ridin', (ridin'), huh, yeah, she ridin' (ridin')
Love a mean bitch, what's up?
And she got an attitude, we always fussin' (we always fussin')
Yeah, her ass fat and she let me touch it (she let me touch it)
Huh, she just look so pretty, yeah, when we fucking (when we fucking)
Pop it, pop it, pop it, yeah, shit poppin' (shit poppin')
