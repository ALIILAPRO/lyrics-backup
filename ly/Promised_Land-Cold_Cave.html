		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's no resting for the wicked
Imagine how tired I am
I prayed for warmth and peace
But some winters never end
In California burning
Old haunts and a new romance
In life, we love
In death, we dance

I get a little too high
I get a little too low
Take my hand to the promised land

I wanna make your dreams come true
I wanna make your darkest dreams come true
Cherry kisses on the lips and
All gold grows under your rainbow
Can I just spend my life buried alive inside of you?

In life, we love
In death, we dance
In life, we love
In death, we dance

I get a little too high
I get a little too low
Take my hand
To the promised land

Long, long way to go
It's a cold, cold, cold road alone
It's a long, long, long way to go
It's a cold, cold, cold road alone

Blue days
Black nights
Purple haze
White light
Blue days
Black nights
Purple haze
White light

It's a long, long, long way to go
It's a cold, cold, cold road alone
It's a long, long, long way to go
It's a cold, cold, cold road alone
