		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't want the same disease
That everybody's got these days
I don't wanna live that way
I do not wanna live in pain
So take your parasites away
And keep 'em somewhere far from me
'Cause I don't want the same disease
That everybody's got these days

I don't wanna live that way
I do not wanna live in pain

Another fool in history
I'll tell you what it means to me
It's nothin' but lobotomy
It's nothin' but an angry sea 
Striking a wave
Wave with me
Oh, with me

It's comin' like a big freight train
It's spreadin' like a wild flame
You know it's comin' all our ways
So dig your dirt and make your grave
Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-mama, save me
Oh, come on and vaccinate me
'Cause I don't want the same disease
That everybody's got these days

I don't wanna live that way
I do not wanna live in pain

Another fool in history
I'll tell you what it means to me
It's nothin' but lobotomy
It's nothin' but an angry sea 
Striking a wave
Wave with me
Oh, with me
Oh, with me
