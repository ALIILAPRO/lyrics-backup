		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you really want smoke, we can get it in
Really fuckin' smish, we can get it in
Get on your grind shorty K
If you really want that smoke with me
We can get it in
I don't give a fuck about that bitch, I love my dividend
And if you want that smoke with me
We can get it in
And I don't give a fuck if you want smoke, can't never blink again
Come here baby girl, why you runnin', don't you run
You know I love money baby, so do you, let's have some fun
Try to fuck with us, I'm playin' around, you know I love my gun
In love with brickies, don't give hickeys, hold on baby, I ain't done
Shoulda seen the look up on his face, when I came around
Dropped the gun, take me, no trace, I was not around
Hollow tips that hit his face, now he on the ground
Come here baby, that's the case, better not make a sound
In love with violence since a youngin', think something's wrong with me
50 years old bitch, I'm youngin', there's something wrong with me
I'm still a kid, love playin' games, play along with me
I love playin', get the money fast, get along with me
I got caught up with my side chick, ain't know what to say
I said, baby, it's just my sister, shoulda seen her face
I don't got a sister, baby girl, you such a dummy
She was tweakin', hella mad, but I'm just laughin' cause it's funny
I said, fuck all of this drama, I'ma go and count some money
Shot a y'all up on my line, but it was fine, she got a dumpy
Oh my God, look at the time, I need some lean up in my tummy
He got walkie around the corner, better know that I was runnin
If he really want that smoke with me, we can get it in
I don't give a fuck about that bitch, I love my dividends
If you want that smoke with me, we can get it in
And I don't give a fuck if you want smoke, can't never blink again
Come here baby girl, why you runnin', don't you run
You know I love money, baby, so do you, let's have some fun
You try to fuck with us, I'm playin' around, you know I love my gun
In love with blickies, don't give hickeys
Hold on baby, I ain't done, shoulda seen the look up on his face
When I came around, dropped the gun, said there's no trace
I was not around, hollow tips that hit his face
Now he on the ground, come here baby, that's the case
Better not make a sound, been in love with violence since a youngin
Think something's wrong with me, 50 years old bitch, I'm youngin
There's something wrong with me, I'm still a kid, love playin' games
Play along with me, I love playin', get the money fast
Get along with me
We can get it in
We can get it in, if you want that smoke with me
We can get it in, if you want that smoke with me
We can get it in
