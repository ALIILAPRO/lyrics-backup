		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Love is a lie and
Love is a mess
Telling the secrets of loneliness
Our love survive
How does love survive?
Letters are written
Words are spoken
Some hearts are better left unbroken
How will love survive
How will love survive
Little by little, step by step
We were called the dirty pets
Heart to heart and side by side
Love will never hide

Locomotion tango on a lonely rainbow
We will dancin' baby
Don't wait for heroes
Locomotion tango on a lonely rainbow
We will dancin' baby
Romancin' lady

Locomotion in my heart
See you dancin' in the darkness
Locomotion let us start
Let us dancin' in the moonlight

Baby, you're waiting
Baby, you cry
See all the fools babe with their lies
Our love survive
How does love survive?
What does it take to kill your love?
What does it take to get that stuff?
Our love survive
How does love survive?
Little by little, step by step
We were called the dirty pets
Heart to heart, side by side
Love will never hide
