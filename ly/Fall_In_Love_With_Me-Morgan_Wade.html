		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't know what time zone you're in
But I, I hit you up like, I need a friend
And I know that you can't pretend
That this is a fairytale, and you ain't scared of how it will end

But it's fine, I don't care
Wanna take off your clothes, wanna mess up your hair
You said you love my honest words
I got shit better than this that you haven't even heard

Gonna make you fall in love with me
Get caught up in me while you're overseas
Wait until you see me in person
Make that feeling worsen, you'll be cursing

Can't you see I'm what you need?
Make you hit your knees, pull out that ring
Gonna make you fall in love with me
Gonna make you fall in love with me

You said you hate that I'm a writer
I've been working really hard, I've been pulling all-nighters
You text me from the yacht, you're sipping cider
Don't worry, I ain't tipping off Insider

But I'm drunk on Hemingway dreams
Fitzgerald ain't got nothing on me (nothing on me)
Like the Bible, make you believe
You were blind (you were blind), but you're gonna see

I'm gonna make you fall in love with me
Get caught up in me while you're overseas
Wait until you see me in person
Make that feeling worsen, you'll be cursing

Can't you see I'm what you need?
Make you hit your knees, pull out that ring
Gonna make you fall in love with me
Gonna make you fall in love with me

I'm gonna make you fall in love with me
Mm, gonna make you fall in love with me

I don't know what time zone you're in
But I, I hit you up like, I need a friend

I'm gonna make you fall in love with me
Get caught up in me while you're overseas
Wait until you see me in person
Make that feeling worsen, you'll be cursing

Can't you see I'm what you need?
Make you hit your knees, pull out that ring
Gonna make you fall in love with me
Gonna make you fall in love with me

Mm, gonna make you fall in love with me
Yeah, gonna make you fall in love with me
Gonna make you fall in love with me
Mm, gonna make you fall in love with me
