		  I-I-I-I-

No, you're not my friend, you're just a little bit lonely
There's no need for this pretend, no (yeah)
I still call it pretend 'cause I can see how you're wired 
And I don't mean to offend you 
'Cause I love watching you smile (smile)
The way that you feel (the way that you feel)
We took a step back, and now I'm missin' my meals (my meals)
So, why can't we just be who we are, baby?
Why can't we just be who we are, baby (ah, ah)

I almost fell in love, but I couldn't tell you (couldn't tell you)
I couldn't tell you (couldn't tell you)
I-, I couldn't tell you (I couldn't tell you)
I was giving up, but I couldn't tell you (couldn't tell you)
Would you bury me? Can't you bury me?
I almost fell in love, but I couldn't tell you (couldn't tell you)
I couldn't tell you (couldn't tell you)
I couldn't tell you (I couldn't tell you)
I was giving up, but I couldn't tell you (couldn't tell you)
Would you bury me? Can't you bury me?

I never wanna come unless you're comfortable
Ignore me when I get there, where do I go?
Half an hour passed and you already know
If I wasn't that bitch, then I'd be on the floor
I hit you up
Takin' a while, but I know that you're there
Followin' up
I'm always thinkin' ahead, I never said what we were

I almost fell in love, but I couldn't tell you (couldn't tell you)
I couldn't tell you (couldn't tell you)
I couldn't tell you (couldn't tell you)
I was giving up, but I couldn't tell you (couldn't tell you)
Would you bury me? C-c-can't you bury me?
I-I-I almost fell in love, but I couldn't tell you (couldn't tell you)
I couldn't tell you (couldn't tell you)
I couldn't tell you (couldn't tell you)
I was giving up, but I couldn't tell you (couldn't tell you)
Would you bury me? Can't you bury me?
