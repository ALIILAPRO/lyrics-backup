		  Bring all the birds out
Bring all the birds out
Bring all the birds out
Bring all the birds out
Bring all the birds out
Bring all the birds out
Bring all the birds out
Bring all the birds out

Bring all the birds out
Bring all the birds out

Lil Purpp bring all the birds out
Bring all the hoes out bring
All the money out it's a good day outside
So I just might go and
Bring the whole Rarri' out
Yoppa in the backseat and he got a 38
He just might let the bitch air it out
Walk in the party with an AK
Take out the bitches and thеn
I'ma clear it out
Two iPhones they ringing, two
IPhonеs they ringing, yeah
Two choppas they singing, bitches
In the kitchen, yeah
I'm on a whole 'nother level
I tell your bitch to put me on her pedestal
Laugh on you niggas, ahead of you
Try me, my niggas get rid of you

Bring all the birds out
Bring all the birds out
Bring all the birds out
Bring all the birds out
Bring all the birds out
Bring all the birds out
Bring all the birds out
Bring all the birds out
Bring all the birds out
Bring all the birds out
Bring all the birds out
Bring all the birds out
Bring all the birds out
Bring all the birds out
Bring all the birds out
I'm on a whole 'nother level


Bring all the birds out
Bring all the birds out
Bring all the birds out
Bring all the birds out
Bring all the birds out
Bring all the birds out
Bring all the birds out
Bring all the birds out
Bring all the birds out
Bring all the birds out
Bring all the birds out
Bring all the birds out
Bring all the birds out
Bring all the birds out
Bring all the birds out

Diamonds on me
Yeah they dancin' like Breezy
I take your bitch, yeah I'm slimy
I'm sleezy
Came out the mud, a young nigga was PZ
On the slow meth, bitch
I'm feelin' like Jeezy
Louis bag got a whole hundred racks in it
Diamonds in my teeth, finna go see a dentist
Bitch give me jaw, her name crystal
Lil Purpp shoot and he ball like the-


Bring all the birds out
Bring all the birds out
Bring all the birds out
Bring all the birds out
Bring all the birds out
Bring all the birds out
Bring all the birds out
Bring all the birds out
Bring all the birds out
Bring all the birds out
Bring all the birds out
Bring all the birds out
Bring all the birds out
Bring all the birds out
Bring all the birds out
Bring all the birds out
Bring all the birds out
Bring all the birds out
Bring all the birds out
Bring all the birds out
Bring all the birds out

Bring all the birds out
Bring all the birds out
Bring all the birds out
