		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Will you make it sound so pretty even when it's not?
Didn't choose but it's the only one we've got
And sometimes I get so tired
Of getting tied up in my thoughts
You're the only one that often makes it stop

God, it hurts to be human
Without you I'd be losing
And someday we'll face the music
God, it hurts to be human

But I've got you, you, you, you, you, you, hey
And you've got me, me, me, me, too

Like we're buckled and preparing before the crash
Like we're walking down a road of broken glass
Now if we defeat all odds
And it was us against the world
You can count on me
You know I'd have your back

God, it hurts to be human
Without you I'd be losing
And someday we'll face the music
God, it hurts to be human

But I've got you, you, you, you, you, you (Hey)
And you've got me, me, me, me, too
But I've got you, you, you, you, you, you (Hey)
And you've got me, me, me, me, too

Hope flows away
If you could spend a day in my shoes
Your mind would change
If you'd known what I've gone through
We want the same (Yeah, we do)
Maybe then you'll understand
How it hurts to be human

God, it hurts to be human
Without you (without you) I'd be losing (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
And someday we'll face the music
God, it hurts to be human

But I've got you, you, you, you, you, you, hey
And you've got me, me, me, me, too
But I've got you, you, you, you, you, you, hey
And you've got me, me, me, me, too

Oh God, it hurts to be human
