		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The evil of all evils lurks in the dark, hiding in the shadow of smiles
Ponder the perfect moment to strike- and laying the bait
Setting the trap for the moment to come, waiting for the eyes to be blind
Falsification of integrity, and taking the prey

Beware the wolf, don’t swim with sharks
Never go walking through woods in the dark
Sociopathic illusion is coming your way

Separate mother and child in the hunt, forcing the weakest to tire
Circling numbers as appetites growl- indifferent to loss
Greed and predation are fueled by the need, avarice born out of pride
The victim must die for the pack to survive at every cost


Beware the wolf, don’t swim with sharks
Never go walking through woods in the dark
Sociopathic illusion is coming to prey

Wolves will stalk in the dark

The evilest of evil lives in the hearts of many women and men
Dormant, emotionless, absence of grace-  and masked with a smile
Awakened by convenient fortuity, striking when defense is down
Narcissist draining the life from strong- and training the child

Beware the wolf, don’t swim with sharks
Never go walking through woods in the dark
Sociopathic illusion is coming to stay

Wolves will stalk in the dark
