		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, look

I mean this with love when I say it
I wanna answer the phone when you call me
The problem is, it's 10 a.M. And you're already drinkin'
You're probably already wasted
What's the point in having conversation with somebody that
Won't remember we had conversations, yeah, we always talk about the same things
We just say 'em different
Try to fix it, crazy, isn't it?
You say, "Mom was always proud" and played the videos of us as kids, I get it
I think that both of us live in the past, so we take for granted the present
Maybe next time I'm in Michigan, I'll come and visit
We ain't got a lot in common but both of us miss her
We could sit inside your smoke-filled livin' room, and tear up together, that's real

I might do some things you don't like
We all make mistakes, that's just life
They might say I changed, that's alright
That's alright, that's alright
That's just my life, my life, my life, my life
That's just my life, my life, my life, my life
That's just my life, my life, my life, my life
That's just my life, my life, my life, my life
My life, my life

You know my patience is very thin
Wish I was there again
I'm not embarrassed to say that we've always had issues
I'm embarrassed to say that we never took care of 'em, yeah
Pain will always find its way to the surface
No matter how deep you bury him
Growin' up, I felt like no one ever really got me, eventually
I took that out on relationships (woo)
I put my arm around you, and I mean it, I love you to death
These are the moments I know I'ma always hold onto and cherish 'em, yeah
Life's about taking chances, making moves
Not about what you did, it's what you do
Build on what you got and learn from what you lose
And never let people distract you from being you

I might do some things you don't like
We all make mistakes, that's just life
They might say I changed, that's alright
That's alright, that's alright
That's just my life, my life, my life, my life
That's just my life, my life, my life, my life
That's just my life, my life, my life, my life
That's just my life, my life, my life, my life
My life, my life

That's just my, that's just my, that's just my
That's just my, that's just my, that's just my
That's just my, that's just my, that's just my
(Oh no no no) Yeah
That's just my, that's just my, that's just my
That's just my, that's just my, that's just my
That's just my, that's just my, that's just my
Life

That's just my life, my life, my life, my life
That's just my life, my life, my life, my life
That's just my life, my life, my life, my life
That's just my life, my life, my life, my life
My life, my life
