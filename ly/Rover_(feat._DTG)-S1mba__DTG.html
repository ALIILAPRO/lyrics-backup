		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Shawty said she coming with her bredrins
'Cause she saw a young nigga pull up in a Rover
Now she say she wanna come over, yeah
But I don't want no love

I just wanna make the mu-la-la, yeah
The mu-la-la
I just wanna make the mu-la-la
Got 'em all screamin', oh la-la, yeah

Shawty said she coming with her bredrins
'Cause she saw a young nigga pull up in a Rover
Now she say she wanna come over, yeah
But I don't want no love

I just wanna make the mu-la-la, yeah
The mu-la-la
I just wanna make the mu-la-la
Got 'em all screamin', oh la-la, yeah

I don't want no love
You know me, I only think about funds
Me, I'm tryna do my own ting on my ones
I'm sorry darling I don't want no hugs, yeah, yeah, yeah
Had a couple gally tried to hold me down
But they ain't my queen, they can't take my crown
They tried to claim me like lost and found
But I only got love for the P's and the Pounds, yeah, yeah, yeah
I love being paid
I don't want you, no, I don't want bae
Tryna get my funds up in numerous ways
Couldn't give a damn what a nigga gotta say

I don't need your lovin'
So don't tell me nothin'
Oh, you think I'm bluffin'
When I say no cuffin'

Shawty said she coming with her bredrins
'Cause she saw a young nigga pull up in a Rover
Now she say she wanna come over, yeah
But I don't want no love

I just wanna make the mu-la-la, yeah
The mu-la-la
I just wanna make the mu-la-la
Got 'em all screamin', oh la-la, yeah

(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I ain't got time for a honey
But I got time for this money
Check the bright side, man it's sunny
I ain't being funny, I ain't into the love and I'm sorry, yeah
Because I've done this all before, yeah, yeah, yeah
Because I've done this all before, yeah
You might catch me in a four by four, that's a clover
You might catch me in a Rover, yeah
Or you might catch me on my Motorola
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I don't need your lovin'
So don't tell me nothin'
Oh, you think I'm bluffin'
When I say no cuffin'

Shawty said she coming with her bredrins
'Cause she saw a young nigga pull up in a Rover
Now she say she wanna come over, yeah
But I don't want no love

I just wanna make the mu-la-la, yeah
The mu-la-la
I just wanna make the mu-la-la
Got 'em all screamin', oh la-la, yeah

Shawty said she coming with her bredrins
'Cause she saw a young nigga pull up in a Rover
Now she say she wanna come over, yeah
But I don't want no love

I just wanna make the mu-la-la, yeah
The mu-la-la
I just wanna make the mu-la-la
Got 'em all screamin', oh la-la, yeah, yeah, yeah
