		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We ah sip the Henny for the day, baby
Bad man, we no stray, baby
Oops I done fell for your way, baby
I know girl but everyone falls

And I know from the first time, the first time
I seen your love, you got me baby
Even though girl I know that I will fall for you
You got to know that everyone falls
Oops I done fell so deep, baby
Oops I want you for me, baby
Oops I want you for me, baby
Oops I done fell so deep 'cause (uh)

Everyone falls in love sometimes
I don't know 'bout you but it ain't a crime
Need fi let me love you, love you, love you, love you for long time baby
Need fi let me touch you, need fi let me love you 'til the mornin', oh

Mmm, ah, mmm, ah, mmm, need fi let me love you
Mmm, ah, mmm, ah, mmm, need fi let me touch you
Mmm, ah, mmm, ah, mmm, need fi let me love you

We ah sip the Henny for the day, baby
Come my, my way baby
Top down on the highway, baby
Yuh need fi let me love you
Shawty she ain't even got a VISA
Out of town, one night teaser
Need to tell them other niggas ease up
I'm falling but everyone falls

And I know from the first time, the first time
I seen your love, you got me baby
Even though, girl, I know that I will fall for you
You got to know that everyone falls
Oops I done fell too deep, baby
Oops I think you got me, baby
Oops I want you for me, baby
I'm fallin' but everyone falls (uh)

Everyone falls in love sometimes
I don't know 'bout you but it ain't a crime
Need fi let me love you, love you, love you, love you for long time baby
Need fi let me touch you, need fi let me love you 'til the mornin', oh

Mmm, ah, mmm, ah, mmm, need fi let me love you
Mmm, ah, mmm, ah, mmm, need fi let me touch you
Mmm, ah, mmm, ah, mmm, need fi let me love you

And if you want me
You need fi let me love you now
It's true what I need
Is someone fi love me right now
It's true I'm a freak
It's time to love you now
And if you want me

Everyone falls in love sometimes
I don't know 'bout you but it ain't a crime
Need fi let me love you, love you, love you, love you for long time baby
Need fi let me touch you, need fi let me love you 'til the mornin', oh

Mmm, ah, mmm, ah, mmm, need fi let me love you

Mmm, ah, mmm, ah, mmm, need fi let me love you
Mmm, ah, mmm, ah, mmm, need fi let me love you, yeah
