		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Hey, Christmas time in Tennessee, y'all)

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
Take a look at the five and ten
It's glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see
Is the holly that will be
On your own front door

A pair of Hop a long boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben
Dolls that'll talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen
And mom and dad can hardly wait for school to start again

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel
One in the park as well
The sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
And soon the bells will start
And the thing that'll make them ring
Is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart, yeah

(Take me there boys)
(Do do do do do, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Hey, woo)

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see
Is the holly that'll be
On your own front door

Sure it's Christmas once more
Sure it's Christmas once more, yeah
