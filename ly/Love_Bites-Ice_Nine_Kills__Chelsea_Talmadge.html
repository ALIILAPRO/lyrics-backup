		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm tearing London limb from limb
It's tearing me apart, but it us or them
So howl at the moon, oh how can it be?
The softer the skin the sharper the teeth
(Yeah!)

So call the nurse, 'cause it's worse when I'm alone
I've fallen prey to a curse I can't disown
Is it all in my head?
When I'm at hands of a mental filled with doubt
But this is love I just can't live without
(Despite the thought of the dead)

So howl at the moon, oh how can it be?
The softer the skin the sharper the teeth
With nowhere to go, nothing to believe
I'm counting on beauty to kill off the beast
(Yeah!)

You bit off more than you could chew
But you taste too good to be true
Safe in my arms you will lay, 'cause every dog has its day
(Dog has its day)

So howl at the moon, oh how can it be?
The softer the skin the sharper the teeth
With nowhere to go, nothing to believe
I'm counting on beauty to kill off the beast
So howl at the moon, oh how can it be? (Oh how can it be?)
The softer the skin the sharper the teeth
With nowhere to go, nothing to believe (nothing to believe)
I'm counting on beauty to kill off the beast
So just put me down
