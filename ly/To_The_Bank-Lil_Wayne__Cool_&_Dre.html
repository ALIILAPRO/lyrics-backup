		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm twisting Medicinal
Pissing medicinal, spittin' that clinical
I'm in the delivery room, pockets pregnant, bitch tryna clip the umbilical
I ain't simple or typical, gen', or general
Nigga, I'm nuts, no genitals
I fell in love with them chemicals
I bust a few nuts and she swim in 'em
These niggas act tough and they feminine
Play no games, nigga, not even scrimmagin'
These niggas can't see me, no imagery
My pockets so fat, they hemorrhagin'
Damn, that's an injury, I gotta keep the same energy
My soda pink with that remedy
I can't rest in place 'cause they diggin' me, shit
Big Tune, I lick shots, them niggas lick wounds
Shoot up everything but the kids room
I walk out the bank like the men's room
I got paper like I'm a tribune
I fly a bitch out like a witch broom
I run in her mouth like some gym shoes
Cum all over her face, now, her skin smooth

Ho-ass nigga, camel toe-ass nigga
Pantyhose-ass nigga
Candy store-ass nigga
Sweet and sourdough-ass nigga
Don't know how it go-ass nigga
I'm a giant, I'ma come, and thump, fee-fi, and fo that nigga
Wait, I'm a baboon, I'm a tycoon
Bitch, it's Lil' Tune, elephant in the room
I'm the shit, the perfume, I'm the salt in the wound
And I walk on the moon, it's like carpet to Tune
I thought you was a goon, well, take off the costume
You soft as balloons, I play darts with balloons
Yeah, I make your heart, "Boom-boom-boom"
Yeah, I break her heart like the rules, yeah

Wait, I'm livin' the dream, piffin' the green
Sippin' the lean, give me a bean
Feelin' serene, I'm here with a queen
She here for a ring, I'm killin' her dreams
I'm killin' the scene
A nigga a king, they kissin' the ring
Yeah, bling-ity bling
Drippin', ravine, I'm with the regime
We finna rage against the machine

I'm twisting Medicinal
Pissing medicinal, spittin' that clinical
I'm in the delivery room, pockets pregnant, bitch tryna clip the umbilical
I ain't simple or typical, gen', or general
Nigga, I'm nuts, no genitals
I fell in love with them chemicals
I bust a few nuts and she swim in 'em
These niggas act tough and they feminine
Play no games, nigga, not even scrimmagin'
These niggas can't see me, no imagery
My pockets so fat, they hemorrhagin'
Damn, that's an injury, I gotta keep the same energy
My soda pink with that remedy
I can't rest in peace 'cause they diggin' me, shit
Big Tune, I lick shots, them niggas lick wounds
Shoot up everything but the kids room
I walk out the bank like the men's room
I got paper like I'm a tribune
I fly a bitch out like a witch broom
I run in her mouth like some gym shoes
Cum all over her face, now, her skin smooth
