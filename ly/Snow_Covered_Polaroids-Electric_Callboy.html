		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Good times on polaroids
Sleepless the nights
Moments gone with a smile
Turn from pale into white

And it turns around in my head
A movie scene of feelings we've had
Don't forget me
And don't forget us

When I say goodbye
Waving till you're gone
Wishing this moment could last forever

When I say goodbye
For the last time
Thinking of you and me forever

And since you've been gone
The memories so breakable
They don't let me forget
Feelings are a gift
But always untouchable

And it turns around in my head
A movie scene of feelings we've had
Don't forget me
And don't forget us

When I say goodbye
Waving till you're gone
Whishing this moment could last forever

When I say goodbye
For the last time
Thinking of you and me forever

Take my hand

I try to catch these moments
That dash along so fast
I hold these folded hands
They're praying for the past

I try to catch these moments
That dash along so fast
I hold these folded hands
They're praying for my past

And I try to catch these moments
That dash along so fast
I can't even figure out
What's happening to me
And now it's only you
The memory in me
The memory in me
