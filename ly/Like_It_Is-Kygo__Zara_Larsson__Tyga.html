		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Maybe you should leave this girl alone
But you won't
But you don't
Now delete my number from your phone
But you won't
You gotta go
Oh, line-by-line, gotta spell it right out
(Yeah)

I don't know what you're looking for
But I don't think it's me
I wish I could give you my all
Not caught in make believe
I don't feel how you feel
I'm just tellin' it like it is
I don't need you to say those words no more

I'm just tellin' it like it is (you got me, you got me)
I'm just tellin' it, tellin' it (you got me, you got me)
I'm just tellin' it like it is (you got me, you got me)
I'm just tellin' it, tellin' it (you got me, you got me)

I'm just tellin' it like it is (you got me, you got me)
I'm just tellin' it, tellin' it (you got me, you got me)
I'm just tellin' it like it is (you got me, you got me)
I'm just tellin' it, tellin' it (you got me, you got me)
I'm just tellin' it like it is

Yeah, hol' up, wait a minute, let's make this right
You're the only one thing that I need in my life
And I ain't never met a girl like you before
I could tell you everything if you need to know
We was perfect before and I made mistakes
Told you I was all in, we can raise the stakes
Even though I'm a player, I ain't contemplate
Now you on a vacay, hotel heartbreak
Champagne all day, on me, oh yeah
Miami with your friends, you ain't worried 'bout me
Got a room with a suite, so drunk, lose the key
And I know we ain't over so, the ring, you can keep, ayy
We be right back tomorrow night, yeah (tomorrow night)
It's for life, you know we ride or die, yeah (ride or die)
Single for the night but you still mine
And I'ma chill with this shawty just to kill the time, y'know

I'm just tellin' it like it is (you got me, you got me)
I'm just tellin' it, tellin' it (you got me, you got me)
I'm just tellin' it like it is (you got me, you got me)
I'm just tellin' it, tellin' it (you got me, you got me)

I'm just tellin' it like it is (you got me, you got me)
I'm just tellin' it, tellin' it (you got me, you got me)
I'm just tellin' it like it is (you got me, you got me)
I'm just tellin' it, tellin' it (you got me, you got me)

I'm just tellin' it like it is (you got me, you got me)
I'm just tellin' it, tellin' it (you got me, you got me)
I'm just tellin' it like it is (you got me, you got me)
I'm just tellin' it, tellin' it (you got me, you got me)
I'm just tellin' it like it is
