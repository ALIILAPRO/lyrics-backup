		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm a mess sometimes
Who knows it better than I do?
When I lose my mind
Nothing finds me like you do

You pick me up and pull me out of the darkest places
You always know the perfect words to say

I've been high, I've been low, when I get lost along this road
There's a voice that calls me home and keeps me going
And if I win or if I lose, I will always make it through
'Cause I know that I got you to keep me going
You keep me going (you keep me going)

When I hit the wall you're there right beside me
When the curtain falls and all I feel is empty

You pick up me up and dust me off when I'm on my knees
You always know the perfect words to say

I've been high, I've been low, when I get lost along this road
There's a voice that calls me home and keeps me going
And if I win or if I lose, I will always make it through
'Cause I know that I got you to keep me going
You keep me going, you keep me going

When the ground just shakes, my bones just ache
And the world stops turning round
When I'm giving up and I'm letting go all the walls start crashing down

I've been high, I've been low, when I get lost along this road
There's a voice that calls me home and keeps me going
And if I win or if I lose, I will always make it through
'Cause I know that I got you to keep me going
To keep me going

(I've been high, I've been low, when I get lost along this road)
Oh, you keep me going, if I win, or If I lose
You just keep me going
Yeah, you keep me going
You just keep me going
Oh, you keep me going

You keep me going
You keep me going
You keep me going
