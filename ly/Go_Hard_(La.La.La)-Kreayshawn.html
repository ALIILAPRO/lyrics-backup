		  Hey, bitch!
What's up?
You know I'd really like to do that
But I don't have any fucking money
Like, I don't have any fucking money

Hey, bitch
Do you really, really, really wanna go hard?
Go in the crib
Steal your stepfather's credit card
And take the car
Do circles in the parking lot
Scream at the top of our lungs like la la la
La la la la la la la la la la
We on that la la la la la la la la la la

Hey, bitch!
I see you working at the mall
At Forever 21, selling tanks and shawls
You wanna quit your job?
You need a place to go?
Girl, run your own show
But don't be on some ho shit
Bounce with something cute on
I kiss into a fog zone
I be really off
And searching for some water though
What it do, let it go
And go hard
Let me see you do it
Go hard, like real hard

Hey, bitch
Do you really, really, really wanna go hard?
Go in the crib
Steal your stepfather's credit card
And take the car
Do circles in the parking lot
Scream at the top of our lungs like la la la
La la la la la la la la la la
We on that la la la la la la la la la la

Girl, you need that new
Bottles on chill, I got that gold chain flu
Little lady on my side, show me how you ride out
Be a good one and I'll take you to my hideout
Pretty little bitch
Dripping like some water though
I be on that straw
And coming for that lo-lo
What I did
Let her go
She's back now
She went real hard until she threw her back out

Hey, bitch
Do you really, really, really wanna go hard?
Go in the crib
Steal your stepfather's credit card
And take the car
Do circles in the parking lot
Scream at the top of our lungs like la la la
La la la la la la la la la la
We on that la la la la la la la la la la

Silly girl
Take your jacket off
Get on the floor
Go hard, go hard
G-go hard, go hard, go hard
Damn
Do do do do do it like, do it like, do it like
Let me see you go hard, go hard, go hard
G-go hard, go hard

Hey, bitch
Do you really, really, really wanna go hard?
Go in the crib
Steal your stepfather's credit card
And take the car
Do circles in the parking lot
Scream at the top of our lungs like la la la
La la la la la la la la la la
We on that a la la la la la la la la la
