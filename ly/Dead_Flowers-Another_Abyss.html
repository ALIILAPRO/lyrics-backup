		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I am still invisible to you
Even after all you put me through
Every step I take
Is enough for you to break
I slowly fade away
Like the flowers on your grave, the flowers on your grave
Closer day by day
Until there's nothing left of me
I slowly fade away
Every time that I feel free
Someone has to disagree
Every step I take
Is enough for me to break
I slowly fade away
Like the flowers on your grave, the flowers on your grave
Closer day by day
Until there's nothing left of me
I slowly fade away
Like the flowers on your grave
Closer day by day, until there's nothing left of me
I slowly fade away
