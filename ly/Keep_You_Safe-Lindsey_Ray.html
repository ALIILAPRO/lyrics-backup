		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you ever lose your way
And everything is out of place
I'll be there to make to it all okay

Oooooh
I will light the path for you
I'll do all that I can do
To keep you safe

Anywhere the river flows
Anyway the trade winds blow
You don't have to face it on your own

Oooooh
I will right the stars for you
I'll do all that I can do
To keep you safe

Oooooh
I will light the path for you
I'll do all that I can do
To keep you safe
Oooooh
I will right the stars for you
I'll do all that I can do
To keep you safe
