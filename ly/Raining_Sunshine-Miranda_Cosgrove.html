		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sunshine, Sunshine, Raining, Sunshine
When you think all hope is gone
There's a place somewhere beyond
Take a chance and realize
It's right before your very eyes

Leave the Dark clouds far behind
And step outside, the weather's fine

It's raining sunshine
It's raining sunshine
All over mankind
It's raining sunshine

As real as it can be,
Believe in what you see.
Not just in your mind.
It's raining sunshine..

Sunshine, Sunshine, Raining, Sunshine (Raining sunshine)
Sunshine, Sunshine, Raining, Sunshine..

Somethin's in the atmosphere,
Don't be scared of what you fear. (Don't be scared)
Look around, the storm has passed,
Just hurricanes of happiness. (happiness)

Raise up your umbrellas high,
And stand beneath, the clear blue sky.. (the clear blue sky)

It's raining sunshine
It's raining sunshine (Oh)
All over mankind (Yeah)
It's raining sunshine

As real as it can be
Believe in what you see (It is)
Not just in your mind
It's raining sunshine..

Too many wonders to explain (to explain)
Rays of sunlight, drops of rain (drops of rain)
Coming down from up above (up above)
Cloudy with a chance of love. (chance of love)

Can't you feel it in the air?
Sweet sensations everywhere (Oooooh)
Whatever weather is in store,
Bring it on, because I want more..

Sunshine, Sunshine, Raining, Sunshine.. (I want moooore)
Sunshine, Sunshine, Raining, Sunshine..

It's raining sunshine (It's raining sunshine)
It's raining sunshine (Oh)
All over mankind (See the sun shine)
It's raining sunshine (Let it rain)

As real as it can be
Believe in what you see.. (Believe)
It's not just in your mind,
It's raining sunshine...
