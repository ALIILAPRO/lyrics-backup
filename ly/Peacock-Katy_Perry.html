		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wanna see your peacock, cock, cock
Your peacock, cock
Your peacock, cock, cock
Your peacock
I wanna see your peacock, cock, cock
Your peacock, cock
Your peacock, cock, cock
Your peacock

Word on the street, you got somethin' to show me, me
Magical, colorful, Mr. Mystery, ee
I'm intrigued, for a peek, heard it's fascinating
Come on, baby, let me see
What you hiding underneath
What's up your sleeve?
Such a tease, wanna see the show
In 3D, a movie, heard it's beautiful
Be the judge and my girls gonna take a vote
Come on, baby, let me see
What you hiding underneath

I want the jaw-droppin', eye-poppin', head-turnin', body-shockin'
(Oh, ayo, oh, oh, ayo)
I want my heart-throbbin', ground-shakin, show-stoppin', amazin'
(Oh, ayo, oh, oh, ayo)

Are you brave enough to let me see your peacock?
Don't be a chicken boy, stop acting like a biotch
I'm a peace out if you don't give me the pay off
Come on, baby, let me see
What you hiding underneath
Are you brave enough to let me see your peacock?
What you're waiting for, it's time for you to show it off
Don't be a shy kind of guy I'll bet it's beautiful
Come on, baby, let me see
What you hidin' underneath

I wanna see your peacock, cock, cock
Your peacock, cock
Your peacock, cock, cock
Your peacock
I wanna see your peacock, cock, cock
Your peacock, cock
Your peacock, cock, cock
Your peacock
I wanna see your

Skip the talk, heard it all, time to walk the walk
Break me off, if your bad, show me who's the boss
Need some goose, to get loose, come on take a shot

Come on, baby, let me see
What you hiding underneath

I want the jaw-droppin', eye-popin', head-turnin', body-shockin'
(Oh, ayo, oh, oh, ayo)
I want my heart-throbbin', ground-shakin, show-stoppin', amazin'
(Oh, ayo, oh, oh, ayo)

Are you brave enough to let me see your peacock?
Don't be a chicken boy, stop acting like a biotch
I'm a peace out if you don't give me the pay off
Come on, baby, let me see
What you hiding underneath
Are you brave enough to let me see your peacock?
What you're waiting for, it's time for you to show it off
Don't be a shy kind of guy I'll bet it's beautiful
Come on, baby, let me see
What you hiding underneath

I wanna see your peacock, cock, cock
Your peacock, cock
Your peacock, cock, cock
Your peacock, cock

Oh my god, no exaggeration
Boy, all this time was worth the waiting
I just shed a tear
I am so unprepared
You got the finest architecture
End of the rainbow-looking treasure
Such a sight to see
And it's all for me

Are you brave enough to let me see your peacock?
Don't be a chicken boy, stop acting like a biotch
I'm a peace out if you don't give me the pay off
Come on, baby, let me see
What you hiding underneath
Are you brave enough to let me see your peacock?
What you're waiting for, it's time for you to show it off
Don't be a shy kind of guy I'll bet it's beautiful
Come on, baby, let me see

I wanna see your peacock, cock, cock
Your peacock, cock
I wanna see your peacock, cock, cock
Your peacock
I wanna see your peacock, cock, cock
Your peacock, cock
I wanna see your

Come on, baby, let me see
What you hiding underneath
