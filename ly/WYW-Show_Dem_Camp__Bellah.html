		  And so what?
And so what? (No, no)
Oya no vex
Oya no vex, come back
(If it's spax then it's gotta be a)

I wish you the best, free from the stress
Pray that you're blessed, but then she wished me neglect
I know it's my fault, I failed all the tests
Been hundred percent but then the chain of events
Man, I couldn't be the guy that you need (guy that you need)
That's how you believe (how you believe)
It's somebody's son but that guy wasn't me
And everybody yarn that, the truth set you free
Except when you free them, man, that's when it's beef
I thought (i thought)
Why waste your time when it can't fly? (Time when it can't fly)
I know you say you love me, but I can't lie (can't lie)
These the kinds of feeling that you can't buy (you can't buy)
She said I was her worst by a landslide (landslide)
And this is where you get to see her bad side (bad side)
No matter how you try you're still the bad guy (bad guy)
And even though I told her it was me (told her it was me)
She looked the guys and yarn me something deep

I hope she cheats on you
I hope she makes a fool of you
I hope she carries belle for your friend, oh baby
I hope she, I hope she cheats on you
I hope she does nothing for you
I hope your happiness starts to fade away, yeah

For all the stress, yeah
I can't wish you the best, oh
You learned your lesson
Karma is the bitch you left me for
For all the stress, yeah
I can't wish you the best, oh 
You learned your lesson
Karma is the bitch you left me for

Truth be told, I've not been too honest
Now we're over, I get all my time, yeah
I don't wish you nothing but, pain, heartbreak (wow)
Wish you nothing but, pain, heartbreak
I hope she cheats on you

Well, I wished you would listen
Acting like you're the victim
Co-defendants in this love crime, so who's the villain?
Just hold your L, I know it's tough like the bluest denim
Do me I do you, God no go vex, true religion (live)
'Cause I had good intentions
My Pisces queen, just never thought you'd be fishy
In IG streams, drowning in all inhibitions
My guys keep seeing you with egbons you were tricking
Of course, you've been tripping
Now we were both on some toxic shit
But how my intuition hit was like a comic, kid
I just show me it's a marvel, no comic strip
Turns out there was some logic to this cosmic trip
'Cause now I found me a new jawn, brown skin unicorn
Body so soft it's like l'm laying on a futon (muah)
So get mad if you want, girl, I moved on
All I heard was, "nigga, you wrong"

I hope she cheats on you
I hope she makes a fool of you
I hope she carries belle for your friend, oh baby
I hope she, I hope she cheats on you
I hope she does nothing for you
I hope your happiness starts to fade away, yeah

For all the stress, yeah
I can't wish you the best, oh
You learned your lesson
Karma is the bitch you left me for
For all the stress, yeah
I can't wish you the best, oh 
You learned your lesson
Karma is the bitch you left me for

Um, I'm just no longer as fascinated (la-di-da)
Or as interested in like grand gestures of romance
Because sometimes when people are so quick
To pull out those grand gestures of romance (la-di-da)
You think it's their personality

Anything wey you like
From the same women that say we're not romantic
They're saying that this is a grand gesture of romance
I don't understand
I'm telling you and I'm showing you how I feel
If I talk, you'll say I'm lying, if I show, you'll say I'm lying
Then what am I supposed to do? I don't understand
