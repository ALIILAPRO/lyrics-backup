		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm in a million fuckin’ pieces
Pick me up off the floor ceaseless
Put me together and break me more

On the way to a new level
I'm levelin' up again call me the Alpha Mage
(Put a bullet in the Government)
I’ve had enough, should put it in a grave
Had to be the one to run up in
Front of the bus of a popular opinion
And become a martyr for
Smaller voices than mine

I just bought a bonesaw to cut my hands off
Had to get the cuffs off
You kept me down too long
And now I think twice
Fuck the advice, 'cause nobody knows
(Nobody knows)

Grippin' the sides of my face and I
Never wanna see anyone I know again
And I'm okay with enemies shaking
Hands over my grave saying
"Life is too short"
Everything is a pathetic aesthetic
Now don't worry
I'll keep on challengin' those
Who want sharper mentalities
As we get close to the death of society

(I'm not gonna make it)
(I’m not gonna make it)
I’m not gonna make it!
I'm not gonna make it! (Out of this)

I’m in a million fuckin' pieces
Pick me up off the floor ceaseless
Put me together and break me more
