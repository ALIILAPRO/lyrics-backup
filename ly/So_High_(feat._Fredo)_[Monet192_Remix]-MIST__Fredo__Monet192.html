		  Fred again
Preditah
Ah
I get, so high
(Temperature ri-i-i-i-i-i-i)

I get, so high
Girl you're a groupie, no need to lie
I get, so high
Get so, so high, 'til you feel to fly
I get, so high
She's so, so shy, 'til the night
(Temperature ri-i-i-i-i-i-i)
I was last year and I'm still the guy

Throw some sauce 'pon 'dem
So high, time to walk 'pon 'dem
Yeah I do set trends
Talk too much get sticky for you friends
Send a hitta to your ends
I don't dance, I ain't movin' my feet
Ah, 'cause I'm dancin' with heat
Bad B's got my tunes on repeat
Do it with ease, out 'ere tripling P's
Back to my grindin' again (I'm back)
Writin', rhymin' again
Firing skengs, yeah it's Fred yet again
Manna put a line in your ends
Aggy, so much gold it's chavvy
'Dem man are chatty like gyally
Big .44 called Maggie
What's my cologne? Creed and Cali

I get, so high
Girl you're a groupie, no need to lie
I get, so high
Get so, so high, 'til you feel to fly
I get, so high
She's so, so shy, until the night
(Temperature ri-i-i-i-i-i-i)
I was last year and I'm still the guy

Yo I've been stuck with my booty call
Furthermore I fell in love with my booty call
Girl you got junk, know your boot is full
In the eyes of a tug that is beautiful
When I'm on tour, you know who to call
I'm in Tom Ford, this ain't suitable
Diamonds, handbags, you suit it all
Kilos, gram packs, we move it all
"Oi Mist, are you takin' the piss?" (why?)
I swear you got a ring, that is made for a wrist
I swear I got a ting, that is made for my lips
I got a gun for him, I ain't making a diss
Gettin' so, so high, they hatin'
I can't say I don't know why
I'm feelin' scared when the po roll by (why?)
'Cause me and the bros got a pole close by
Bang!

I get, so high
Girl you're a groupie, no need to lie
I get, so high
Get so, so high, 'til you feel to fly
I get, so high
She's so, so shy, until the night
(Temperature ri-i-i-i-i-i-i)
I was last year and I'm still the guy

I get, so high
I get, so high (ah!)
I get, so high
(Temperature ri-i-i-i-i-i-i)
