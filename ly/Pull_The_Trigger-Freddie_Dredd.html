		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Who is Freddie with no gun?
I ain't playin', havin' fun
I just wanna live my best life
I will kill you and your ex wife
I'm living large but it ain't just big enough
I need these bodies dead, all stacked up
Keepin' all my shit, I keep a Glock up on my hip
You bitches wanna test my clip, I keep it loaded, never miss
I don't give two fuckin' shits you little rascal, let you run
Can't escape from Freddie's gun, snub nose .40s, which one?
Got my Glock, got my shawty, aimin' at the fuckin' party
Oh what's up, its yo' birthday, Freddie's got a little gift
Got some bullets flying through ya, shut the fuck up, stupid bitch
I'm not lyin', why you cryin'? Asking why you fuck with this

Cocked it back and now I'm aimin' at yo' head
Cocked it back and now yo' bitch ass friend is dead
Pull the trigger now yo' body filled with lead
Pull the trigger and I do not want no cred
Cocked it back and now I'm aimin' at yo' head
Cocked it back and now yo' bitch ass friend is dead
Pull the trigger now yo' body filled with lead
Pull the trigger and I do not want no cred
Cocked it back and now I'm aimin' at yo' head
Cocked it back and now yo' bitch ass friend is dead
Pull the trigger now yo' body filled with lead
Pull the trigger and I do not want no cred

Cocked it back and now I'm aimin' at yo' head
