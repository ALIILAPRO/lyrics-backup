		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I never owned a single thing
And I couldn't pay the bills
I'm on the straight and narrow now
But sometimes I miss the thrills
Of owin' people money
And causin' others harm
I wanna be dangerous
A reason for alarm

I wanna be a rebel
I wanna break some bones
Maybe they'll be yours
They might be my own
I wanna be a rebel
I can't get enough
I wanna be a rebel
I wanna smash shit up

I'm tryin' to live the good life now
'Cause I used to mess things up
Yeah, life's a little better now
No more pissin' in a cup
Everything's so pleasant
But sometimes I still miss the mess
My life's a little better now
But this I must confess

I wanna be a rebel
I wanna break some bones
Maybe they'll be yours
They might be my own
I wanna be a rebel
I can't get enough
I wanna be a rebel
I wanna smash shit up

Everything's so pleasant now
But sometimes I miss the mess
I'm on the straight and narrow now
But this I must confess

I wanna be a rebel
I wanna break some bones
Maybe they'll be yours
They might be my own
I wanna be a rebel
I wanna break some bones
Maybe they'll be yours
They might be my own
I wanna be a rebel
I can't get enough
I wanna be a rebel
I wanna smash shit up
I wanna smash shit up
I wanna smash shit up
