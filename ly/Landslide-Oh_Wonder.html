		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know it hurts sometimes
But you'll get over it
You'll find another life to live
I know you'll get over it
I know you're sad and tired
You've got nothing left to give
But you'll find another life to live
I know you'll get over it

So when you're caught in a landslide
I'll be there for you, I'll be there for you
And in the rain, give you sunshine
I'll be there for you, I'll be there for you
And every time that you're lonely
And every time that you're feeling low, you should know
I'll be there for you, I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you, you know

I know your hope is heavy
But you'll get over it
You'll find another life to live
I know you'll get over it
And I know you feel like everything
Is falling to the wind
But don't you let the thunder in
'Cause I know you'll get over it

So when you're caught in a landslide
I'll be there for you, I'll be there for you
And in the rain, give you sunshine
I'll be there for you, I'll be there for you
And every time that you're lonely
And every time that you're feeling low, you should know
I'll be there for you, I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you, you know

You fell down by the wayside
Love locked in an overflow
And you threw stones at the starlight
'Cause I stood on the sidelines telling you
That I get that you're lonely
And I see that you feel alone
But I heard in a heartbeat
I'll be there for you, you know

So when you're caught in a landslide
I'll be there for you, I'll be there for you
And in the rain, give you sunshine
I'll be there for you, I'll be there for you
And every time that you're lonely
And every time that you're feeling low, you should know
I'll be there for you, I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you, you know

I'll be there for you, I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you, you know
I'll be there for you, I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you, you know
I'll be there for you, I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you, you know

And every time that you're lonely
And every time that you're feeling low, you should know
I'll be there for you, I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you, you know
