		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I feel it comin' like a highball train
Barin' down on the end of the line
I see the black clouds followin' me
Like they're tied to the hands of time

I'm feelin' meaner than an old bobcat
I got the hammer down and won't look back
My mind is headed down a one-way track
I'm leavin' Lonesome Flats
I'm leavin' Lonesome Flats

I wish I had another day or two
But I don't have time to kill
You'll probably never see my face again
Once I make it across the hill (yeah)

I'm feelin' meaner than an old bobcat
I got the hammer down and won't look back
My mind is headed down a one-way track
I'm leavin' Lonesome Flats
I'm leavin' Lonesome Flats

Ooh yeah
I got to get away, get away, oh
I got to get away, get away, yeah
I got to get away, get away, yeah

Woo-hoo
Woo-hoo-hoo, hoo!

I'm gonna have to burn the whole place down
If they try to throw the brick at me
I'm gonna run from the things I've done
'Cause I'm guilty in the first degree, yeah

I'm feelin' meaner than an old bobcat
I got the hammer down and won't look back
My mind is headed down a one-way track
I'm leavin' Lonesome Flats
I'm leavin' Lonesome Flats, yeah

I'm feelin' meaner than an old bobcat
I got the hammer down and won't look back
My mind is headed down a one-way track
I'm leavin' Lonesome Flats
I'm leavin' Lonesome Flats, woo-hoo
