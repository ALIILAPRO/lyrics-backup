		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Had no plans to show up (ah, ah, ah)
Was about to leave (ah, ah, ah)
You came out of nowhere (ah, ah, ah)
With possibilities

Turning nothing into something
Oh, I like where this is going
I can feel it, feel it coming
I do, baby, do you? Oh

How did we get this close?
Wonder how far we go
Losing all self-control
What are we waiting for?
Dancing until they close
Hold me and don't let go
Don't wanna leave alone
What are we waiting for?

Keeping me distracted (ah, ah, ah)
Keep my mind at ease, mm (ah, ah, ah)
Middle of this madness (ah, ah, ah)
You're focusing on me, oh

Turning nothing into something
Oh, I like where this is going
I can feel it, feel it coming
I do, baby, do you? Oh

How did we get this close?
Wonder how far we go (ah, ah)
Losing all self-control (ah, ah)
What are we waiting for?
Dancing until they close
Hold me and don't let go
Don't wanna leave alone
What are we waiting for?

What are we waiting for?

I dunno how we got this close
I'm losing all my self-control
Hold on me tight and don't let go
Hold on me tight and don't let go (holdin' me tight)
I don't know how we got this close (ow)
I'm losing all my self-control
Hold on me tight and don't let go
What are we waiting for?

How did we get this close?
Wonder how far we go (oh)
Losing all self-control
What are we waiting for?
Dancing until they close
Hold me and don't let go
Don't wanna leave alone
What are we waiting for?

What are we waiting for?
Waiting for?
