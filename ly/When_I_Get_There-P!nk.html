		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I think of you when I think about forever
I hear a joke and I know you would've told it better
I think of you out of the blue
When I'm watching a movie that you'd hate
You'd say it, you were never one to hesitate
You were always first in line
So why would it be different for Heaven?
But I got a couple questions

Is there a bar up there where you've got a favorite chair?
Where you sit with friends and talk about the weather?
Is there a place you go to watch the sunset
And, oh, is there a song you just can't wait to share?
Yeah, I know you'll tell me when I get there

Do you think of me? Do you wish that I would slow down?
Are there some things that you've seen that feel like home now?
Are you up there climbing trees, singing brand new melodies?
I hope you are, I know you are

Is there a bar up there where you've got a favorite chair?
Where you sit with friends and talk about the weather?
Is there a place you go to watch the sunset
And, oh, is there a song you just can't wait to share?
Yeah, I know (I know) you'll tell me when I get there
Yea-yeah, you'll tell me when I get there

Will you save me a place with all those pearls of wisdom?
Yeah, I'll make some mistakes and you'll watch me as I live them
'Til I'm through, 'til I'm with you

Is there a bar up there where you've got a favorite chair?
Where you sit with friends and talk about, talk about the weather?
Is there a place you go to watch the sunset
And, oh, is there a song you just can't wait to share?
Yeah, I know (I know) you'll tell me when I get there, yeah

I think of you when I think about forever
