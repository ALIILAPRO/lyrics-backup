		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know that people change
But I thought that we would stay the same
In a web of your lies
Didn't give me a good reason why

A stupid fight
Set us alight

Why can't we talk about it?
You're always walkin' out
You make it worse
You never learn
I don't know how to fake it
When we're disintegrating
No return
We'll crash and burn

You picked him over me
And you left with no apology
Felt a knife in your back
Yeah, you thought I was the killer, you're lookin' in the mirror

Why can't we talk about it?
You're always walkin' out
You make it worse
You never learn
I don't know how to fake it
When we're disintegrating
No return
We'll crash and burn

Whoa
Whoa
Toxic games you play
Too high price to pay
Whoa
Whoa
Nothing's permanent so
Guess I gotta learn to let go

Why can't we talk about it?
You're always walkin' out
You make it worse
You never learn
I don't know how to fake it
When we're disintegrating
No return
We'll crash and burn
