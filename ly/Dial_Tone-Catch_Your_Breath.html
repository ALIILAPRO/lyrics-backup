		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I close my eyes
I can see a ghost from the past
And it cuts just like a knife
Hate to feel like this
But it happens all the time
Said you never understand me
Don't know who I am
Tell me I'm just like your father
I'm not the one who caved in
You disappeared without a trace
You never bothered to explain
You just walked away
All I wanted was an answer
All I needed was to know
Give me a reason
I need a reason
All those messages I left you
All those nights I spent alone
Give me a reason
Cause all that I hear is
A dial tone
Dial tone
When I close my eyes
I can feel you breathe down my neck
Now I'm only half alive
And I hate that I miss your smile
But it's only half the time
Now I'm up all night
Got me checking my phone
For the thousandth time
Told me that you
Never wanted
This to die
You disappeared without a trace
You never bothered to explain
You just walked away
All I wanted was an answer
All I needed was to know
Give me a reason
I need a reason
All those messages I left you
All those nights I spent alone
Give me a reason
Cause all that I hear is
All I wanted was an answer
All I needed was to know
Give me a reason
I need a reason
All those messages I left you
All those nights I stayed alone
Give me a reason
Cause I wanna hear it
I wanna hear the way you call to me
When you ever needed help
I never thought you be the reason
That I learned to hate myself
I don't care who you love
I don't have nothing to lose
But I just want to say one last thing to you
All I wanted was an answer
All I needed was to know
Give me a reason
I need a reason
All those messages I left you
All those nights I spent alone
Give me a reason
Cause all that I hear is
A dial tone
