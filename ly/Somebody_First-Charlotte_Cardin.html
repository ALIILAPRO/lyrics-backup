		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You keep the dog, I keep the friends, mm
Baby, I thought that was the deal
That's what we said
But I heard you'd be here tonight
So I guess I'll wear that skirt
That I hate, that you like

Oh, I ain't got nothing to prove
And you got everything to lose
I don't want no one getting hurt
Made a promise to myself
I won't let you fuck somebody first

Sitting by the pool, both on opposite sides
I'm 'bout to make a move right before your eyes
And although it's absurd
Made a promise to myself
I won't let you fuck somebody first

If you don't care, baby, I don't care, mm
You say you're done, but I know you're medium rare, mm
And I know that you miss me in my underwear
You brought a girl, but we both know that she don't compare

'Cause I ain't got nothing to prove
And you got everything to lose
I don't want no one getting hurt
Made a promise to myself
I won't let you fuck somebody first

Sitting by the pool, both on opposite sides
I'm 'bout to make a move right before your eyes
And although it's absurd
Made a promise to myself
I won't let you fuck somebody first
Sitting by the pool, both on opposite sides (oh, on opposite sides)
I'm 'bout to make a move right before your eyes
And although it's absurd
Made a promise to myself
I won't let you fuck nobody but me
