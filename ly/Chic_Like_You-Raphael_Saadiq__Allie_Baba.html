		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I need a chick like you
One licks a lollipop
Manolo Blancs, it's hot
Her seven spit like heaven

A chic like you
Can move and shake it fast
Boys wait for her to pass
Because that girl is bad

Chic like you
She soaks in green tea lotion
Her legs are so outspoken
You'll think this girl is naked

Chic like you
The girl is always sexy
She loves backseats in taxis
And talking good and trashy

I mean the chic like you like just won't stop
Unbutton the top and later hear that k-k-knee drop
I could take you to the Opera and back to the block
Manolos and Gucci Lyn this chic is hot

For real and I mean sizzling hips get the twistness
Switchin' she keep all the playas whistling
She do the foo in bikinis and heels
The way she lick the bits and suck the ice and give a grown man chill

Oh girl when the attendant flip her own whips
Flew a playa the Vegas's for their own chips
Life of the party, the two step queen
She rapped when she seen me with them painted on jeans

You know I don't hit no better than her
Feel like I'm drunk when I see her and I slur my words
She's sexy and classy and she's my type
We can make it last forever just one night what they do, why, why

Everyone buying your drinks, everyone wants the number
Its such a sexy show and she always dancing
Everyone buying your drinks, everyone wants the number
Its such a sexy show and she always dancing

I need a chic like you
That don't know when to quit
Likes me to jump on it
And I just met her girlfriends

Chic like you
One with an open mind
Lets me eat cherry pie
Oh my, oh my, oh my

Chic like you
Will always keep me guessing
What's under that long jacket
I got this real bad habit

Now if this sounds like you
Girl, let me come inside
'Cause I think that you might be
My type, my type, my type, my type, my type, my type
You might be my type, my type, my type, my type, my type, my type

And she is always dancing, always dancing
