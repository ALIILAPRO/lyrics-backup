		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I’ve been playing video games
For about thirteen hours
Watching, entire seasons
Between taking showers

I haven’t worked out
For a couple of weeks
But I’ll be running to the door
For my Uber Eats

I know, I was raised better than this
And I know, there’s a whole lot of things that I’ll miss
I could myself in a better position
If I just hang out my clothes and wash up the dishes

I’m not existential
I’m just barely getting by
Oh it’s just mental
Struggling with stuff inside
These thoughts might have potential
To kill if I’m not careful
I’m not existential I’m just
Barely getting by

The money I’ve been wasting
On my higher education
Was a misguided investment
In my own validation
Good thing you can’t smell me
Through my instagram

Damn…

I keep imagining how much better I’d be
If I just read these books I bought next to me
At least I learnt to shut up people who tell me it’s luck
I guess I mastered the art of not giving a fuck

I’m wasting my time
At he back of the line
Gonna have an argument with you
Back home in the shower
We can argue in my head
For hours and hours

I’m not existential
I’m just barely getting by
Oh it’s just mental
Struggling with stuff inside
These thoughts might have potential
To kill if I’m not careful
I’m not existential I’m just
Barely getting by

Nah Nah Nah
Nah Nah Nah
Nah Nah Nah Nah Nah Nah

Nah Nah Nah
Nah Nah Nah
Nah Nah Nah Nah Nah Nah

And If we talk about it
Well I’m gonna stress about it
And the thing about stress
Is I can’t do shit about it

And If I think about it
Well I’m gonna stress about it
And the thing about stress
Is I can’t do shit without it

Nah Nah Nah
Nah Nah Nah
Nah Nah Nah Nah Nah Nah

Nah Nah Nah
Nah Nah Nah
I can’t do shit with it

Nah Nah Nah
Nah Nah Nah
Nah Nah Nah Nah Nah Nah

Nah Nah Nah
Nah Nah Nah
Wish I’d do shit about it
But I can’t do shit without it
I guess that’s why
I’m barely getting by
