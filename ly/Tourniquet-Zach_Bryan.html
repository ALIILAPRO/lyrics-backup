		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's delays on the planes out of Eastern Montana
Where you told me you were leaving from
You've been stabbed in the back and the rest of your body
Won't you tell me where you're bleeding from

If you need a tourniquet or if you want to turn and quit
Know that I'll be by your side
You bled your whole soul into things you can't control
In a world you'll never satisfy

I bandage up your body and your bones and your bad days too
Take care of the blood that your love runs through
I know all the damage that some days in this dark world does
You were laughing last evening at something I dreamed of

When you finally feel the blood you spill into everybody else
I'll tourniquet your toes to the ground
Pull you in and hold you tight, love you through the heart of night
Spring your kind ass into town
You've been playing your guitar from arenas to the bars
Since you were old enough to rhyme a word
But your face is getting thinner
And you're praying for the winter
And I heard you fucked it up with her

I bandage up your body and your bones and your bad days too
Take care of the blood that your love runs through
I know all the damage that some days in this dark world does
You were laughing last evening at something I dreamed of

I bandage up your body and your bones and your bad days too
Take care of the blood that your love runs through
I know all the damage that some days in this dark world does
She were laughing last evening at something I dreamed of

There's delays on the planes out of Eastern Montana
Where you told me you were leaving from
You've been stabbed in the back and the rest of your body
Won't you tell me where you're bleeding from
