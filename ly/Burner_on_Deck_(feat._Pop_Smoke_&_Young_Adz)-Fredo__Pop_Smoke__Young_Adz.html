		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  (Yoz, what you tellin' me?)

Burner on deck, in Hakkasan or Nobu
Just put blonde dye in my hair, now I'm feelin' like Goku (oh)
Burner on deck, in Hakkasan or Nobu
Just put four in my cup, now my cup is purple
Burner on deck, in Hakkasan or Nobu
I just left with your girl, but we leave no clues
Lil' nigga, got a voice, fix that shit, that's ProTools
Young boy came up off crack cocaine, now I sell out the O2

Yo, we just got in with that burner (burner)
Turn your friend into a murder (murder)
They're takin' L's, they're learners
Tennis chains on me, I'm a server (server)
She got a big mouth, then I swerve her (swerve her)
Original, just like a Werther
He jumpin' the fence, hurdler
I just broke in your bitch, like a burglar (I'm in there)
Burglar (burglar), burglar (burglar), burglar (burglar)
Then I put Gorillaz, no BAPE, on
Slide on your block, any tape on (tape)
Save the game with no cape on (cape)
Came in the game in my apron (ayy)
She wanna eat out on a late one (late one)
Bussin' it open since day one
Day one (day one)

Burner on deck, in Hakkasan or Nobu
Just put blonde dye in my hair, now I'm feelin' like Goku (oh)
Burner on deck, in Hakkasan or Nobu
Just put four in my cup, now my cup is purple
Burner on deck, in Hakkasan or Nobu
I just left with your girl, but we leave no clues
Lil' nigga, got a voice, fix that shit, that's ProTools
Young boy came up off crack cocaine, now I sell out the O2

I just got the drop on my opp
He lackin' in the spot, we hop out and park it (bap)
Pop Smoke (Pop Smoke), Young Adz (Young Adz)
Huh, we hop out and spark 'em (woo)
Shoot up the scenery (scenery)
Dip off and change the artillery (artillery)
I do not play with no enemy (nah)
Because they're tryna get rid of me

Drop him, high road, see me in a foreign (foreign)
All black, feel like I'm in Gotham (Gotham)
The heroin come from a poppin' (poppin')
Got hit in his leg, hoppin' (hoppin')
Smokin' an opp got me coughin'
Schoolin' the yutes, I'm a buff him

Burner on deck, in Hakkasan or Nobu
Just put blonde dye in my hair, now I'm feelin' like Goku (oh)
Burner on deck, in Hakkasan or Nobu
Just put four in my cup, now my cup is purple
Burner on deck, in Hakkasan or Nobu
I just left with your girl, but we leave no clues
Lil' nigga, got a voice, fix that shit, that's ProTools
Young boy came up off crack cocaine, now sell out the O2
