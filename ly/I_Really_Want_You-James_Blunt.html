		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Many Prophets preach on bended knee
Many clerics wasted wine
Do the bloodied sheets 
On those troubled streets 
Mean I have wasted time?
Are there silver shores on paradise?
Can I come in from the cold?
I killed a man in a far away land
My enemy untold

I really want you to really want me
But I really don't know if you can do that (I really want you)
I know you want to know what's right
But I know it's so hard for you to do that (I really want you)
And time's running out as often it does
And often dictates that you can't do that (I really want you)
But fate can't break this feeling inside (now)
That's burning up through my veins

I really want you
I really want you
I really want you
Now

No matter what I say or do
The message isn't getting through
And you're listening to the sound
Of my breaking heart

I really want you 
I really want you 

Is a poor man rich in solitude?
Or will mother earth complained?
Did the beggar pray for a sunny day 
But lady luck for rain
They say a million people bow and scrape 
To an effigy of gold
I saw life begin
And the ship we're in 
And history unfold

I really want you to really want me
But I really don't know if you can do that (I really want you)
I know you want to know what's right
But I know it's so hard for you to do that (I really want you)
And time's running out as often it does
And often dictates that you can't do that (I really want you)
But fate can't break this feeling inside (now)
That's burning up through my veins

I really want you
I really want you
I really want you
Now

No matter what I say or do
The message isn't getting through
And you're listening to the sound
Of my breaking heart

No matter what I say or do
The message isn't getting through
And you're listening to the sound
Of my breaking heart
