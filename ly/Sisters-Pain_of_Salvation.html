		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When all are dizzy and happy from too much wine
I leave the party behind
To be alone with my thoughts and this spinning mind
Through this cold night
But there she stands

And she walks like you
And she smiles almost like you
A child of the wild just like you
Yes.

For a second I think I get a glimpse
Of the real her, behind
She's warm and fragile
With smiles that reach to her eyes
But just this moment,
A change so sublime

If she looked me deep into my eyes
And softly asked me too
I'd be in her bed and in her flesh
And waste a life I knew

So I hold my breath and close my eyes
And focus on the wine
Let this trembling moment pass us by
So I could say goodnight

But then, an impulse
I almost touched her face
Before I pulled back my hand
And we get nervous
We laugh and she spills her wine
Both so awkward, for what's on our mind

And she talks like you
And she smells almost like you
A child of the wild just like you
But she's not all you
Even strives not to be you
Just like every sister would do

And perhaps it's the want
Of you in her eyes
But I want her this one single time
...Just this one time

If she looked me deep into my eyes
And softly asked me too
I'd be in her bed and in her flesh
And waste a life I knew

So I hold my breath and close my eyes
And focus on the wine
Let this trembling moment pass us by
So I could say goodnight

If I'd looked into her eyes
And softly asked her too
She would give herself and give her flesh
And waste a life she knew

So we hold our breath, and close our eyes
And take a sip of wine
But this thirst has emptied every glass
And we should say goodnight

...God, help me say goodnight.
