		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ask me about me again
You know it hurts to feel it
You should read between these
Ask me about me again
Even when my heart declines
Nothing works when I don't
Go 'head, try me
'Cause I'm safe behind these walls
Think you can take me through the fog where I'm no challenge
Childish, childish
Yeah, you, you can try me

I've changed?
There's only been one thing that I've changed
Nothin' is ever enough
I don't have to tell you what I've changed, oh-oh, no
'Cause I couldn't tell you that I've changed (changed)
There's only been one thing that has changed (changed, changed)
Nothin' is ever enough (changed)
I don't have to tell you what I've changed, no-oh, no (changed, changed)
'Cause I couldn't tell you that

Wait, I think too fast at times
I try to keep it out
But it don't work even though I try to forget that
Even though I try to forget that
I know that it's hard to ignore it
I know that it's heartless to play me
Go 'head, try me

I've changed?
There's only been one thing that I've changed
Nothin' is ever enough
I don't have to tell you what I've changed, oh-oh, no
'Cause I couldn't tell you that I've changed (changed)
Only been one thing that has changed, changed, changed
Nothin' is ever enough (changed)
I don't have to tell you what I've changed, no-oh (changed, changed)
'Cause I couldn't tell you that

Hoping I've learned
Take back your word
Might hurt, but I won't hide
I know myself (I know myself), I know I wasn't
The only one that has been through what I have today
Can you wait for this second?
To please somebody else other than your needs (somebody else)
You've got a lot left under your seas (under your seas, yeah)
But your heart's not on your sleeve
Try to believe me though
Gotta listen, gotta learn, gotta live, gotta fight, gotta earn
And your mind's made up on me
I said your mind's made up on me
Gotta live, gotta learn
