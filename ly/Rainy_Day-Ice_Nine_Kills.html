		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Run

Crawl through the holes in the evidence
Where evil has taken up residence
No faith in what red and white will say
They save the truth for a rainy day

Fall through the cracks with the casualties
Where freedom's thrown out with morality
Become a soldier for the controller
Or battle 'til you beat the game

Are you listening to the whispering?
Is it sinking in 'cause it's sickening?
Will you take the bait while you suffocate?
'Cause you know, something is creeping in the dark

Run

A call to survivors has just come through
"Resist the zombie they'll make of you"
Call out the lies, blow the storm away
Don't save the truth for a rainy day

Are you listening to the whispering?
Is it sinking in 'cause it's sickening?
Will you take the bait while you suffocate?
'Cause you know, something is creeping in the dark

In the dark
(Something is creeping)
The dark
In the dark
(Something is creeping)

There is no next level
"All access denied"
Ignorance is past-tense
"Game over, you died"

Oh
Become a soldier for the controller
Or battle 'til you beat the game

Are you listening to the whispering?
Is it sinking in 'cause it's sickening?
Will you take the bait while you suffocate?
'Cause you know, something is creeping in the dark

Are you listening to the whispering?
Is it sinking in 'cause it's sickening?
Will you take the bait while you suffocate?
'Cause you know, something is creeping in the dark

In the dark
(Something is creeping)
The dark
In the dark

Run
Don't save the truth for a rainy day
