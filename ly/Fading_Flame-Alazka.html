		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Brought down to my knees
By all I couldn't foresee
A fading flame
Dying at the end of the day

I'm starting to sing
Of what could have been
It wasn't supposed to end this way

All we take for granted
All the absence of fear

Fading fast wearing out our lives
There won't be another chance
We've given everything
Not enough this time
There's no reason to pretend
No happy end

Now we're hanging by a thread
Believing that the cycle never ends
Grieving in regret

Look up to the sky
This time I can't deny
I can't pretend
This is not a certain end
And so we sing
Of fate, how it should have been
We're going down with our head held high
Yeah!

I know that our time has come
For the other side
We're going down
But we'll perish in style

Fading fast wearing out our lives
There won't be another chance
We've given everything
Not enough this time
There's no reason to pretend
No happy end
(No happy end)

Fading fast, wearing out our lives
There won't be another chance
(Fading fast)
We've given everything
Not enough this time
There's no reason to pretend
No happy end

We're fading fast
We've come a long way
And I won't pretend
A happy end
