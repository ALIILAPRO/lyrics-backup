		  (The end is the end, don't bless me father for I have sinned)

Father did you miss me,
Been locked up a while.
I got caught for what I did but took it all in style.
Laid to rest all my confessions I gave way back when.
Now I'm versed in so much worse,
So I am back again, and he said

For the lives that I take, I'm going to hell!
For the love that I make, I'm going to hell!

Gettin' heavy with the devil, you can hear the wedding bells.

Father did you miss me,
Don't ask me where I've been.
You know I know, yes, I've been told I redefine a sin.
I don't know what's driving me to put this in my head.
Maybe I wish I could die, maybe I am dead!
And he said

For the lives that I fake, I'm going to hell!
For the vows that I break, I'm going to hell!

For the ways that I hurt, when I'm hiking up my skirt.
I am sitting on a throne while they're buried in the dirt.

For the man that I hate, I'm going to hell!

Gettin' heavy with the devil, you can hear the wedding bells.

Please forgive me father,
I didn't mean to bother you.
The devil's in me father.
He's inside of everything I do.

For the lives that I take, I'm going to hell!
For the laws that I break, I'm going to hell!
For the love that I hate, I'm going to hell!
For the lies that I make, I'm going to hell!

For the way I condescend and never lend a hand.
My arrogance is making this head buried in the sand.
For the souls I forsake, I'm going to hell!

Gettin' married to the devil, you can hear the wedding bells.
