		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey who's coming with me, to kick a hole in the sky?
I love the whiskey, let's drink that shit til it's dry.
So grab a Jim Beam, JD, whatever you need.
Have a shot from the bottle, doesn't matter to me.
'Nother round, fill 'er up, hammer down, grab a cup, bottoms up!

This is what it's all about, no one can slow us down.
We ain't gonna stop until the clock runs out. (Bottoms up)
Hell can't handle all of us, so get your bottles up.
Drinkin' every drop until it all runs out.
'Nother round, fill 'er up,
Hammer down, grab a cup, bottoms up! Ooh, bottoms up.

So grab your best friends and make your way to the bar.
But keep your distance, we're gonna light it on fire.
We're drinking black tooth, eighty proof, straight gasoline.
Slam as much as you can take and hand the bottle to me.
'Nother round, fill 'er up,
Hammer down, grab a cup, bottoms up!

This is what it's all about, no one can slow us down.
We ain't gonna stop until the clock runs out. (Bottoms up)
Hell can't handle all of us, so get your bottles up.
Drinkin' every drop until it all runs out.
'Nother round, fill 'er up,
Hammer down, grab a cup, bottoms up! Ooh, bottoms up.

This is what it's all about, no one can slow us down.
We ain't gonna stop until they throw us all out.
Hell can't handle all of us, so get your bottles up.
Drinkin' every drop until it all runs out.

This is what it's all about, no one can slow us down.
We ain't gonna stop until the clock runs out. (Bottoms up)
Hell can't handle all of us, so get your bottles up.
Drinkin' every drop until it all runs out.
'Nother round, fill 'er up,
Hammer down, grab a cup, bottoms up!

'Nother round, fill 'er up,
Hammer down, grab a cup, bottoms up! Hey! Bottoms up.
