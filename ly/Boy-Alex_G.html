		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Stray dog is walkin' down the street
Next to another dog
They're eating mud and
Starting to smell me
Two babies, dangerous and free

When I got home I told my baby the story
She said to me
"I think you're funny, you saw what you wanted to see"
And I said

"I am not the boy you knew"
"I am not the boy you knew"
"I am not the boy you knew"
"I am not the boy"

Feel like a million eyes on me
Feel like a cannon ball, I see
A tree it loses all its leaves
And you are dead to me

You watch someone you know grow into static company
And now you see
Do you wish you were

I am not the boy you knew
I am not the boy you knew
I am not the boy you knew
I am not the boy
