		  Ah, woo
She know how to treat a nigga
Look (Great John on the beat by the way)
She know how to treat a nigga

Look, turn the lights on (that's shooter gang)
Shooter gang in the buildin', huh (shooter, shooter, that's shooter gang)
A hunnid straps, how you feelin'? (shooter gang, gang, gang, gang)
We came to, whoa, we came to, uh, look (that's shooter gang, shooter, shooter, that's shooter gang)
'Cause we came to send this bitch up (shooter gang, gang, gang, gang)
It's me, Sheff G, I'm the realest, it's fuck how you feelin', nigga
It's me, Sheff G, keep your distance, the gang ain't too friendly, nigga
Can't breathe (huh), bitches flockin', can't wait 'til they meet a nigga, huh, look
Shawty wildin', she know how to treat a nigga
They lovin' my style, they see me and they get to wildin' out, huh, huh
They never loved me then, I got rich and they love me now, huh
Anybody wanna get it, fuck that (ah, woo)
You get hit, you standin' with it
I got thirty rounds for any nigga, huh
You ain't get it, why you been in the streets? (Why you been in the streets?)
(Look) get to the money, man, you know that I gotta get to the breesh (breesh)
We eat good (good), feast (feast)
Get to the money, man, you know that I gotta get to the breesh (breesh)
Huh, and we eatin' good (way too hard)
She gon' dance, make it bounce, with no hands
She get litty, huh, Winner's Circle in yo' city, huh
Get to sprayin', no graffiti, huh (ayy, ayy, huh)
Look, count all your blessings, huh, look
Gang with me, huh, got all the weapons
Racin' forward, push on the gas like I'm racin' forward, ayy, ayy
Racin' forward, push on the gas like I'm racin' forward (Ayy, ayy)
I got the bag, I was waitin' on it, uh, uh, waitin' for it
I got the bag, I was waitin' for it
These niggas mad, waitin' on it
Tell them niggas

Turn the lights on (that's shooter gang)
Shooter gang in the buildin', yeah (shooter, shooter, that's shooter gang)
A hunnid straps, how you feelin'? (shooter gang, gang, gang, gang)
We came to, uh, we came to, uh, look (that's shooter gang, shooter, shooter, that's shooter gang)
'Cause we came to send this bitch up (shooter gang, gang, gang, gang)
It's me, Sheff G, I'm the realest, it's fuck how you feelin', nigga
It's me, Sheff G, keep your distance, the gang ain't too friendly, nigga
Can't breathe (yeah), bitches flockin', can't wait 'til they meet a nigga, huh, look
Shawty wildin', she know how to treat a nigga
