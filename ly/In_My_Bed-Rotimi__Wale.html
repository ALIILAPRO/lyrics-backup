		  (H-money)
Baby, baby, yeah

There's a meeting in my bed, oh
In my bed, oh
There's a meeting in my bed, oh
In my bed, oh
There's a meeting in my bed, oh
My bed, oh
There's a meeting in my bed, oh
In my bed, oh

Yeah, hol' up, uh
In it for two, that's me and you, that's very simple
Then I removed, okay we through but I ain't finished yet
Can I slide with you? (yeah)
Spend the night with you? (yeah)
Just let me write with the ink drippin' from my signature (oh oh)
I feel like your body inspire my intentions (yeah)
You left the squad hangin', it's only time with us (yeah)
You know I vibe different 'cause you know my mind different
Her eyes sayin' my room, her body sayin' "heaven", on God

Tell me what you want, I got repeat
Tell me what you need, I go knee deep, yeah
When I fall in love, I go deep, deep in
You could copy that like a CC it 
You look like you need prop up
Come get this vitamin D power, proper
Be ready to touch, when I reach it, yeah
I go eat it up, I no vegan, yeah

I make that ting go wilder
I go make that ting run water
I go make you sing my song

There's a meeting in my bed, oh
In my bed, oh
There's a meeting in my bed, oh
In my bed, oh
There's a meeting in my bed, oh
My bed, oh
There's a meeting in my bed, oh
In my bed, oh
In my bed, oh

Oh nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Meeting in my bed
Oh nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
In my bed

How you keep it sweet like that? (like that)
Love the pretty please like that (like that)
Fresher than Febreze like that
I be on my knees for that
How you touch my soul like Sunday (Sunday)
I touch your fifi the fun way (ah woah)
Everything you need, no cap
Call me when you need tap tap

I make that ting go wilder
I go make that ting run water
I go make you sing my song

There's a meeting in my bed, oh
In my bed, oh
There's a meeting in my bed, oh
In my bed, oh
There's a meeting in my bed, oh
My bed, oh
There's a meeting in my bed, oh
In my bed, oh
In my bed, oh

Oh nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Meeting in my
Oh nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Baby meet me in my bed
Oh nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Meeting in my bed
Oh nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
In my bed, oh

Baby, baby, yeah
