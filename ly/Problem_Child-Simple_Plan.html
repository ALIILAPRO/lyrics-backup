		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here we are again
Wake up 5 am
I didn't mean a word I said
Can we just pretend I can take it back?
Change the way the story ends
I remember when things were simple then
Didn't know we hurt this way

I would fall asleep, you would carry me
You would take my fears away
Am I messed up? forever flawed
Beyond repair but forever yours

All my life all I ever did was try and try
I never meant to be your problem child
Your problem child, yeah
I don't know why I always find the way to make you cry
I never meant to be your problem child
Your problem child, yeah

When you look at me I wonder if you see
All the things you thought I could be
All the crazy night, all the stupid fight
All the tears that filled our eyes

Am I messed up? forever flawed
Beyond repair but forever yours
All my life all I ever did was try and try
I never meant to be your problem child
Your problem child, yeah
I don't know why I always find the way to make you cry
I never meant to be your problem child
Your problem child, yeah

All my life all I ever did was try and try
I never meant to be your problem child
Your problem child, yeah
I don't know why I always find the way to make you cry
I never meant to be your problem child
Your problem child, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Your problem child, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Your problem child, yeah
