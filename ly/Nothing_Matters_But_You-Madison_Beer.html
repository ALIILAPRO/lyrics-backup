		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't know how I survived, before I met you
Watching you through glassy eyes, sinking into blue

If you never stop me (stop me)
Then I'll just keep falling

Nothing matters but you, ooh-ooh-ooh (ooh)
Nothing matters but you, ooh-ooh-ooh (ooh)
Nothing matters but you
Make a girl think the world's only spinning for you (ooh)
Nothing matters but

You belong to me tonight
Hold me while I cry (hold me while I cry)
Swimming underneath moonlight
Taken by the tide (taken by the tide)

If you never stop me (stop me)
Then I'll just keep falling

Nothing matters but you, ooh-ooh-ooh (ooh)
Nothing matters but you, ooh-ooh-ooh (ooh)
Nothing matters but you
Make a girl think the world's only spinning for you (ooh)
Nothing matters but you, ooh-ooh-ooh
Nothing matters but you
