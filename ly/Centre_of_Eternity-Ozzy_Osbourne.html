		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's no present there's no future
I don't even know about the past
It's all timeless and never ending
To take it in it's all too vast

It goes, forever and ever
You thought you knew but you never
There goes
Tomorrow

Journey to the center of eternity
Journey to the center of eternity

The time is coming but also going
And it's leaving never to return
Maybe forever it could be heaven
But if it's hell then you can watch me burn

It goes, forever and ever
You thought you knew but you never
There goes
Tomorrow

I got to travel forever
It's all within my mind
An endless path to endeavor
But forever is a long long time

There's no secrets and no corruption
In the center of infinity
There's no limits in non-existence
And no beginning to my destiny

It goes, forever and ever
You thought you knew but you never
There goes
Tomorrow

Journey to the center of eternity
Journey to the center of eternity
