		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Who shot you? I don't know, they got you
Way this shit going, man, it probably was your partner
And it hurt my soul when I don't be talking to my daughters
Free Big Meech, they gave him five plus a quarter
He ain't never tell, he got pride, that's his morals
Can't bump into them niggas, I can never keep it cordial
I support my brothers, put they music in my story (AyeTM)

Grew up with no cable
It's so crazy 'cause I bumped into a label, got some money from a label
They gon' rob until they stable
And if it's for my brother, ain't no favor, yeah
Gotta watch them niggas, they confusing
They gon' turn they back on you, they find out that you losin'
Watch the police on the Waze app, that's why I be cruisin'
R.I.P. to Nunu, put his face on a Cuban, yeah

If they don't support you
Niggas ain't for you
Niggas ain't loyal
Niggas don't love you
They'll take you
You ain't a snake but they'll make you
I hate a nigga who ungrateful
Been in the streets for so long, I can tell you who play cool

He ain't a shooter, he ain't shot shit
And he ain't rich 'cause he ain't got shit
At least keep a Kel-Tec in your pocket
And I knew it was lit when Rondo had a rocket
I'm recording in the Wraith room
I got a freaky lil' bitch, she play with grapefruit
She a lil' eater lil' bitch, she drinking Grey Goose
We do the dash on the E-way, gotta watch out for the state troops
In Boston, damn near fell out off them pills, huh
You call them niggas your brothers, they ain't real, huh
Your first time in the shootout gave you chills, huh?
Knew it was real when he lost his appeal, huh
You can't wake up and rob, that's a skill, huh
You can't wake up and kill, that's a skill, huh
Rich niggas come around her and steal her
Come around her and steal her

If they don't support you
Niggas ain't for you
Niggas ain't loyal
Niggas don't love you
They'll take you
You ain't a snake but they'll make you
I hate a nigga who ungrateful
Been in the streets for so long, I can tell you who play cool
