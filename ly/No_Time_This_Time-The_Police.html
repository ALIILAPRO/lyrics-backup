		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No time for the niceties of conversation
No time for smiles, no time for knowing
Less time for the intricacies of explanation
Less time for caring, even less for showing

If I could
I'd slow the whole world down
I'd bring it to it's knees
I'd stop it spinning 'round
But as it is
I'm climbing up an endless wall

No time at all, no time
No time this time
No time at all
No time at all
No time this time

No time for a quick kiss at the railway station
No time for a suitcase, sandwich and a morning paper
Only time for time tables, calls and transportation
No time to think, no time to dare

If I could
I'd slow the whole world down
I'd bring it to it's knees
I'd stop it spinning 'round
But as it is
I'm climbing up an endless wall

No time at all
No time this time
No time at all
No time this time

If I could
I'd slow the whole world down
I'd bring it to it's knees
I'd stop it spinning 'round
But as it is
I'm climbing up an endless wall

No time at all
No time this time
No time at all
No time this time
No time at all
No time this time
No time at all
No time this time
No time at all

No time at all
