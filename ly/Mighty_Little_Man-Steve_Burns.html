		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A tired man in his chair
He doesn't move he only stares
At the machine across the room
There's nothing there it's not getting through
He shakes his head
Finally stands up
Throws his hands up
In the air

A blinding flash across the room
A sudden crash
A sonic boom changes everything he knew
It's everything he's never seen
The biggest deal there's ever been
Described in light upon the screen
It said

Nobody else is stronger than I am
Yesterday I moved a mountain
I bet I could be your hero
I am a Mighty Little Man
I am a Mighty Little Man
I am a Mighty Little Man

From way up here you can't look down
As of now there is no ground
The microscope is turned around
Don't be alarmed don't make a fuss
He's still like you he's one of us
and he'll come back before too long

He takes a breath and clears his mind
Grabs his coat and steps outside
An empty street there's no one there
He lifts himself into the air
A billion thoughts expressed as one
Etched in words
Across the sun
It said

Nobody else is stronger than I am
Yesterday I moved a mountain
I bet I could be your hero
I am a Mighty Little Man

Nobody else is stronger than I am
Yesterday I moved a mountain
I bet I could be your hero
I am a Mighty Little Man
I am a Mighty Little Man

Nobody else is stronger than I am (I am a mighty little man)
Yesterday I moved a mountain
I bet I could be your hero (I am a mighty little man)
I am a mighty little man

Nobody else is stronger than I am (I am a mighty little man)
Yesterday I moved a mountain (I am a mighty little man)
I bet I could be your hero (I am a mighty little man)
I am a mighty little man

Nobody else is stronger than I am (I am a mighty little man)
Yesterday I moved a mountain (I am a mighty little man)
I bet I could be your hero (I am a mighty little man)

I am a mighty little man
I am a mighty little man
