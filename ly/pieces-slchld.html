		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Girl, you took my heart and you went too far
Heard some things and it broke my heart
Sure you know what you meant to me
Everything, you're my everything
I was bound to get hurt, yeah
She thought I was gonna be away for a while
But came back just in time
But you know where to be seen
Yeah, your love ain't what I need, you
Can tell what side I hate, yeah
So I just wanna know
Where you at and where you been?
Are you eatin'? Are you safe? yeah
You say I don't gotta know
Said that I'm the one
Who left you with the pain and thе hurtin'

Our love, our love is in piecеs
Surely some day, we'll heal from our mistakes
All the love when your heart is in pieces
Tell me love, how you been? Girl, I miss ya

So tell me why you wanna be alone?
So tell me why I have to be alone?

Our love, our love is in pieces
Surely some day, we'll heal from our mistakes
All the love when your heart is in pieces
Tell me love, how you been? Girl, I miss ya

I had a feelin' you would be there
I can't even lie, girl my faith you was real
Yeah i can't fathom doing dates now
Everything's so new since you left
The bed a wreck, yeah
All the pain I put you
Through waited for me daily
When I didn't do enough for you, yeah
And that's why I can't kinda hate ya
And that's why I can't kinda leave ya

So tell me why you wanna be alone?
So tell me why I have to be alone?

Our love, our love is in pieces
Surely some day, we'll heal from our mistakes
All the love when your heart is in pieces
Tell me love, how you been? Girl, I miss ya
Our love, our love is in pieces
Surely some day, we'll heal from our mistakes
All the love when your heart is in pieces
Tell me love, how you been? Girl, I miss ya
