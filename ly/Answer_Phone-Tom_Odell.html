		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Three, four)

Here I go again
Wasting all my days away
It's a funny thing how some things never seem to change
Twenty-seven years of age
Head spin like a satellite
If you thought I was gonna behave tonight, you're wrong

I'm drunk, and I'm a mess
Dressed up like it's Halloween
Dancing alone to "Billie Jean"
Praying that somebody takes me home
Praying that tonight I won't have to sleep alone
With your answering phone

Here I go again
Wasting all my money, babe
It's a funny thing how some things never seem to change
I'm sick of all this cheap cocaine
I ain't got no appetite
If you thought I was going to behave tonight, you're wrong

I don't wanna be a star
Famous on the party scene
Dancing alone to "Billie Jean"
Praying that somebody takes me home
Praying that tonight I won't have to sleep alone
With your answering phone

Smile
Smile
Smile
Smile, even if you're feeling sad
