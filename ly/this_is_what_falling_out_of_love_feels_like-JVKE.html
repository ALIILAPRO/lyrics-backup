		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I never thought it'd end this way
Lost the passion, got the pain
And every time I hear your name
It simply doesn't hit the same
What happens when the colors fade?
Butterflies, they fly away
And every time I hear your name
It simply doesn't hit the same

Ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh
It simply doesn't hit the same
Ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh
It simply doesn't hit the same

Run it up
Count up the bands and run it up
I'm out of love
Throwin' up the towel, I'm out of love
We touchin', the magic is gone
And I hate all our favorite songs
I swear, I tried singin' along
But everything 'bout it feels wrong

See your name up on my screen
The emoji's been gone for weeks
But I can't shake the way that I'm feeling
Like when something's droppin' from the ceiling
Like we're broken, don't know how to heal it
Can you feel it? Can you feel it?

I never thought it'd end this way
Lost the passion got the pain
And every time I hear your name
It simply doesn't hit the same
What happens when the colors fade?
Butterflies, they fly away
And every time I hear your name, oh
It simply doesn't hit the same

Ohh, ohh (it doesn't hit the same, yeah)
Ohh, ohh
It simply doesn't hit the same
Ohh, ohh (it doesn't hit the same, the same)
Ohh, ohh 
It simply doesn't hit the same
