		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Remember when
Never needed each other
The best of friends
Like sister and brother
We understood
We'd never be alone

Those days are gone
Now I want you so much
The night is long
And I need your touch
Don't know what to say
Never meant to feel this way
Don't want to be
Alone tonight

What can I do to make you mine?
Falling so hard, so fast, this time
What did I say?
What did you do?
How did I fall in love with you?

I hear your voice
And I start to tremble
Brings back the child that
I resemble

I cannot pretend
That we can still be friends
Don't want to be
Alone tonight

What can I do to make you mine?
Falling so hard, so fast, this time
What did I say?
What did you do?
How did I fall in love with you?

I want to say this right
And it has to be tonight
Just need you to know

I don't want to live this life
I don't want to say goodbye
With you I want to spend
The rest of my life

What can I do to make you mine?
Falling so hard, so fast, this time
What did I say?
What did you do?
How did I fall in love with you?

What can I do to make you mine?
Falling so hard, so fast, this time
Everything's changed
We never knew
How did I fall in love with you
