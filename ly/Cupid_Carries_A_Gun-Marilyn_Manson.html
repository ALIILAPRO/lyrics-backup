		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Pound me the witch drums, the witch drums
Pound me the witch drums
Pound me the witch drums, the witch drums
Better pray for hell, not hallelujah

I'm a coat of fists, dead and heartened spiders
Like two mangled crowns or the widest of the meanest coiled snakes
Folks said I look like death
Lived in the hotel of my eyes
Lives wide open like a whore
Painted in spit from the earth between her thighs

Keep your halos tight
I'm your god or your guardian
Keep your halo tight
One hand on the trigger, the other hand in mine
Because now, cupid carries a gun
Now, now, cupid, cupid carries a gun

Pound me the witch drums, the witch drums
Pound me the witch drums
Pound me the witch drums, the witch drums
Better pray for hell, not hallelujah

She had those crow black eyes
Starless but she fucks like a comet
Laid as still as a bible
And it felt like revelations when I looked inside

Keep your halos tight
I'm your god or your guardian
Keep your halo tight
One hand on the trigger, the other hand in mine

Keep your halos tight
I'm your god or your guardian
Keep your halo tight
One hand on the trigger, the other hand in mine

Because now, cupid, carries a gun
Now, now, cupid, cupid carries a gun

Pound me the witch drums, the witch drums
Better pray for hell, not hallelujah

Pound me the witch drums, the witch drums
Better pray for hell, not hallelujah

Pound me the witch drums, the witch drums
Better pray for hell, not hallelujah

Pound me the witch drums, the witch drums
Pound me the witch drums
