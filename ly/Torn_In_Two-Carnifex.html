		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Night, bleeds into day
Screams or whispers
It matters not what you say
Good or evil
Death will get anyway
Synthesized ideology
Theorizing infinity
Correlating contingency
All of them, are a part of me
Stilness, descending
Cold, dark, never ending
Comic polarity
Acceptance is understanding
Cold, dark never ending
Torn in two
Duality isn’t new
Fabric of humanity can’t escape reality
Heaven or hell you have to push through
Torn in two
There’s nothing you can do
Fabric of humanity can’t escape reality
Heaven or hell you have to push through
Life
Death
Rebirth
Life or death, tell me which matters more
The truth is a paradox, this is what you asked for
This what you asked for
Outside the moral universe
The more you remember, the more it hurts
Pain is just the first verse
Time doesn’t heal, it makes it worse
Torn in two
Duality isn’t new
Fabric of humanity can’t escape reality
Heaven or hell you have to push through
Torn in two
There’s nothing you can do
Fabric of humanity can’t escape reality
Heaven or hell you have to push through
Life
Death
Rebirth
Life or death, tell me which matters more
The truth is a paradox, this is what you asked for
This is what you asked for
