		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She don't listen to UK rap if it ain't Dave or Cench
She a six but her friend is a four
A three-way gonna make that ten
Are you sure you wanna make that wife?
We know her since way back when
If it's a Rolls then it gotta be a Cullinan
G63 if Mercedes-

Wide selection of gyal that we got right now
Go broke and watch them all leave us
I can't give a ho my jumper, she'll go home and put it on Depop
I'm in the car with my girl and my guy called me
I'm like, "Bro, you're on speaker"
Toxic relationship with my bitch
One day, we're split, now we're goin' Antigua
Three man jump out the four-door vehicle
It's a miracle if a boy don't get touched
Don't step on our block and trespass
Gotta check in and apply for a ESTA
Young G came to the Dragon's Den
He want a nine bar and he need a investor
Uberlux with a thot inside, she ain't comin' to fuck 
There's a key in the S-Class
Alright, I come a long way from a Vespa
When I put foot on the gas, wanna hear it rip, nah, I don't want a Tesla
Come a long way from givin' out testers
Crackhead itchin' like he got Eczema
'Member I tried do fraud on my metro
I got blacklisted like Skepta
Peculiar mixture in a Pyrex like Nesquik
Been livin' a movie since Block Busters, way before Netflix
I just made a play for a M, it's 11 AM, I ain't even had breakfast
She only listen to RapCaviar, she in her car playin' hella Americans (yeah)

She don't listen to UK rap if it ain't Dave or Cench
She a six but her friend is a four
A three-way gonna make that ten
Are you sure you wanna make that wife?
We know her from way back when
If it's a Rolls then it gotta be a Cullinan
G63 if Mercedes-Benz, huh

Missin' person, parents think he's a runaway
The mandem think I'm tapped, two of the same car in a different colorway
Can't turn no ho to a housewife, more time, just do it the other way
If I ask her to send me a foot picture, she'll think I'm a weirdo
Back then, man do a robbery, tell a civilian, "Don't be a hero"
Huh, she got curve like Andrea Pirlo
I know a chick that'll get into character 
Line man up while she nibble his earlobe
Nokia 9010, this phone come like the splits on Distro
Me and bro like Skep' and Frisco, disco, three man hop out the rental
No need for the drum and bass, call, bae, if you wanna see rude or mental
Huh, I feel like I'm Tony Soprano
Gold tips in a black beater, it's a man-eater like Nelly Fur-, Nelly
F-feel like I'm Nelly Furtado
Pay him a hundred grand in a Sunderland like Amad Diallo
Try come back from this one
My girl got a job, good salary and I'm still her main source of income
No expiry date on a, uh
Minor setback, man soon grip one

She don't listen to UK rap if it ain't Dave or Cench
She a six but her friend is a four
A three-way gonna make that ten
Are you sure you wanna make that wife?
We know her since way back when
If it's a Rolls then it gotta be a Cullinan
G63 if Mercedes-Benz

She don't listen to UK rap if it ain't Dave or Cench
She a six but her friend is a four
A three-way gonna make that ten
Are you sure you wanna make that wife?
We know her from way back when
If it's a Rolls then it gotta be a Cullinan
G63 if Mercedes-Benz
