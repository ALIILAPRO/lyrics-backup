		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Monkey see, monkey do
I don't know why I
Walk around, follow you
I don't know why I
Throw it out, keep it in
I don't know why I
Have to have poison skin
I don't know why I

Pay
Pay to play
Pay to play, pay to play

Walk an inch, take a mile
I don't know why I
Never fade, never smiled
I don't know why I
Never mind, eat and run
I don't know why I
Fuck your ass, for the fun
I don't know why I

Pay
Pay to play
Pay to play, pay to play

I don't know why I
I don't know why I

Pay
Pay to play
Pay to play, pay to play

Monkey see, monkey do
I don't know why I
Walk around, follow you
I don't know why I
Throw it out, keep it in
I don't know why I
Have to have poison skin
I don't know why I

Pay
Pay to play
Pay to play, pay to play

I don't know why I
I don't know why I

Pay
Pay to play
Pay to play, pay to play

Pay
Pay to play
Pay to play, pay to play
Pay to play, pay to play
Pay to play, pay to play
Pay to play, yeah
Yeah, yeah
