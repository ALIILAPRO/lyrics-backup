		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby, baby, baby
What's it gonna be?
Baby, baby, baby
Is it him or is it me?
Don't make me waste my time
Don't make me lose my mind, baby

Baby, baby, baby
Can't you stay with me tonight?
Oh baby, baby, baby
Don't my kisses please you right?
You were so hard to find
The beautiful ones, they hurt you every time

Paint a perfect picture
Bring to life a vision in one's mind
The beautiful ones
Always smash the picture
Always, every time

If I told you baby
That I was in love with you
Oh baby, baby, baby
If we got married
Would that be cool?

You make me so confused
The beautiful ones
You always seem to lose

Baby, baby
Baby (baby)
What's it gonna be baby?
Do you want him?
Or do you want me?

'Cause I want you
Said I want you
Tell me, babe
Do you want me?
I gotta know, I gotta know
Do you want me?
Baby, baby, baby, listen to me

I may not know where I'm going, babe, woo, oh yeah
I said I may not know what I need
One thing, one thing's for certain, baby
I know what I want, yeah
And if it please you, baby
Please you, baby
I'm begging down on my knees
I want you
Yes, I do
Baby, baby, baby, baby
I want you, woo

Yes, I do
