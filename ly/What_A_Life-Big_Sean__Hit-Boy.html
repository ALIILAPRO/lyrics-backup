		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Boy, uh, uh
Sick shit, straight up
Fuckin' for real? (Hit-Boy)
Boy, boy (Trap Adix)

Only get one life, swear I almost died twice (woo)
I went triple platinum more than three times, what a life, man (life)
Feel like God went and blessed me with the trick dice (bitch)
And I left her ass on read, even though it was enticin'
I ain't married yet, so it's rocky on my right hand (whoa)
And I'm on stage by myself, ain't with the hype man
Go ahead then, tell me what your price is
Mine's is a hundred B's, nigga, you can't swipe this

Lost my appetite the way you bitches be bitin'
I'm off no sleep, day shift, plus the night shift
Ho, quit askin' when I'm free, I'm always priceless
I ain't really rockin' with you, I ain't on that Mike shit (rock with you)
Man, fuck, I'm goin' right in
I ain't waitin' around, fuck all that, I'm goin' right in (right)
I ain't really rockin' with the type shit you typin' (uh)
That little shit you flexin', ain't nothin' when you got it (uh)
If you can fit it in your pocket, just stop it
If I lift it to my ear, just know that's really some light shit (light)
That's just how I'm rockin', I can't wait, I'm goin' right in (right in)
Jumpin' out the woo, I can't wait on you, I'm right in

Only get one life, swear I almost died twice
I went triple platinum more than three times, what a life, man (what a life)
Feel like God went and blessed me with the trick dice
And I left her ass on read, even though it was enticin'
I ain't married yet, so it's rocky on my right hand
And I'm on stage by myself, ain't with the hype man
Go ahead then, tell me what your price is
Mine's is a hundred B's, nigga, you can't swipe this (lil' bitch)

That's the mentality, stack the fatalities, pick 'em off gradually
For real, it's fans that got a tat' of me
My brother Jalen Rose got an academy
This shit is not a game, nigga (game)
Fuck you mean? I'm at the point where a nigga finally famous, give a fuck about no fame (fame)
Ask me where my LLC is, it's on my chain
If I die today, just know I live up to my
Man, niggas call me "Big", like the shit really my name
You know how I'm comin', I ain't even gotta explain
In the best shape of my life, she at the crib, she gettin' trained
Goin'-goin' 'gainst me is worse than goin' 'gainst the grain
At the frontline, give a fuck about no pain
Nah, for real, could fill a gallery up with a mind frame
You ain't comin' how I came
I ain't waitin' around, bitch, I'm goin' right in
Yeah I'm goin' right in, that's just how my life is

Only get one life, swear I almost died twice
I went triple platinum more than three times, what a life, man (what a life)
Feel like God went and blessed me me with the trick dice
And I left her ass on read, even though it was enticin'
I ain't married yet, so it's rocky on my right hand
And I'm on stage by myself, ain't with the hype man
Go ahead then, tell me what your price is
Mine's is a hundred, sike, bitch, I'm priceless

I'm at Ford Field like a tight-end
And I'm makin' sure all my loose ends tied in
I'm in love with the hustle, so it's never tied-ins
I ain't seen her ass in years, she just let me right in
Swerve, swerve, yeah
This shit off the dome, this shit off the dome, I'm goin' right in
I ain't even write it, but this shit been already written
