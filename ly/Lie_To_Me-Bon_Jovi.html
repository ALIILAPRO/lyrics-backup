		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Rumour has it that your daddy's coming down
He's gonna pay the rent
Tell me baby, is this as good as life is gonna get
It feels like there is a stranger standing in these shoes
But, I know I can't lose me, 'cause then I'd be losing you

I know I promised baby
I would be the one to make our dreams come true
I ain't too proud of all the struggles
And the hard times we've been through
When this cold world comes between us
Please tell me you'll be brave

'Cause I can realize the danger when forgiveness fades away
If you don't love me, lie to me
'Cause baby you're the one thing I believe
Let it all fall down around us, if that's what's meant to be
Right now if you don't love me baby, lie to me

Pour another cup of coffee, babe I got something to say to you
I ain't got the winning ticket
Not the one that's gonna pull us through
No one said it'd be easy, let your old man take you home
But know if you walk out on me
That darling, I'd be gone

If you don't love me, lie to me
'Cause baby you're the one thing I believe
Let it all fall down around us, if that's what's meant to be
Right now if you can't love me baby, lie to me
Baby, I can take it

It's a bitch, but life's a roller coaster ride
The ups and downs will make you scream sometimes
It's hard believing that the thrill is gone
But we got to go around again, so let's hold on

If you don't love me, lie to me
'Cause baby you're the one thing I believe
Let it all fall down around us, if that's what's meant to be
Right now if you can't love me baby, lie to me, lie to me
Baby I can take it
