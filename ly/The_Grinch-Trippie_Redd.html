		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Yo Pi'erre, you wanna come out here?)

Yeah, huh
Life is like a motherfuckin' dream (like a dream)
Fill my double cup up with some lean (with some lean)
Yeah, put my dick in your bitch spleen (bitch spleen)
Yeah, racks comin' in evergreen (evergreen)

Yeah, hold up, let me pop my shit
Pussy nigga talkin', we gon' leave him in a ditch
I'll kill my brother, pussy nigga, if he snitch
I was outside bein' bad with the Grinch
Nigga, bad with the Grinch

Yeah, yeah, trappin' out the motherfuckin' Ritz
Yeah, movin' bales, nigga, yeah, movin' bricks
Fuckin' on his thot and that bitch a redbone (redbone)
Yeah, yeah, put the bitch on (on)
I put niggas on like some motherfuckin' cologne
Fuck nigga, yeah I ain't singin', Post Malone, uh
With the gang, we keep a .57 (bah-bah)
And you know we keep some MAC-11s
I just love me some lethal weapons
Child of God, I'll send your ass to heaven 

Yeah, huh
Life is like a motherfuckin' dream (like a dream)
Fill my double cup up with some lean (with some lean)
Yeah, put my dick in your bitch spleen (bitch spleen)
Yeah, racks comin' in evergreen (evergreen)

Yeah, hold up, let me pop my shit
Pussy nigga talkin', we gon' leave him in a ditch
I'll kill my brother, pussy nigga, if he snitch
I was outside bein' bad with the Grinch
Nigga, bad with the Grinch
