		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven

Well, I wrote my number down
I never wrote it down before
Were gonna bring it over like something from a film
But I didn't have the bottle at all
Well, I were looking and you kept staring
Your thoughts pairing up with mine
And when you're so pretty and I'm so shy
You properly did give me the eye, though, I'm sure you did

Well, I went outside
Couldn't say I tried and I felt regret
Because you haven't bashed me and dashed back in
'Cause the ship hasn't sailed yet
But when I did I couldn't see your face
I could see your mates but that wouldn't do
Well, I dashed around, tried to find you
But you were nowhere to be seen, oh no, no

La-la-la, la-la-la, la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la, la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la, la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la, la, la-la-la-la

Well, she moved in ways that kept her there
In our minds for days and weeks and months
I was that amazed and there she stayed
Surrounded by the "What if's?" and the "Maybe's"
