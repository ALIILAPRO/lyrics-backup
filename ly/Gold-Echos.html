		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All I feel is emptiness here
Searching for what you want me to say
I'm terrified of their eyes when they stare
This loneliness won't go away

Your eyes say so much to me your eyes say so
Your eyes say so much to me your eyes say so
Your eyes say so much to me your eyes say so
Your eyes say so much to me your eyes say so

Nobody knows who I am
I've got intentions of gold with my plans
Nobody knows who I am
I've got intentions of gold with my plans

I've realized nothing I do feels right
Lost in my head and out of sight
Dreaming of the day when I leave
And what the world has left for me

Your eyes say so much to me your eyes say so
Your eyes say so much to me your eyes say so
Your eyes say so much to me your eyes say so
Your eyes say so much to me your eyes say so

Nobody knows who I am
I've got intentions of gold with my plans
Nobody knows who I am
I've got intentions of gold with my plans

Nobody knows who I am
I've got intentions of gold with my plans
Nobody knows who I am
I've got intentions of gold with my plans
