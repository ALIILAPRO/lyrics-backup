		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Keeping it locked away
A secret on every page
But now you're getting close
Feels like dragon's breath
Fire against my chest
Burning through the snow

I can't hide it, I can't hide it
From you
In ultraviolet, ultraviolet
You see through
Ooh, ooh
No, I can't hide it 
When you're ultraviolet
Ooh, ooh
No, I can't hide it

Ooh, ooh
No, I can't hide it
When you're ultraviolet
Ooh, ooh
No, I can't hide it

And you're reading all of me
And you're reading all of me
And you're reading all of me
Oh, oh
Not seeing what they see
Not seeing what they see, ohh

No, I can't hide it
No, I can't hide it 
When you're ultraviolet

And you're reading all of me
And you're reading all of me
And you're reading all of me
Oh, oh
Not seeing what they see
Not seeing what they see, oh

Ooh, ooh
No, I can't hide it
When you're ultraviolet
Ooh, ooh
No, I can't hide it

And you're reading all of me
And you're reading all of me
And you're reading all of me
Oh, oh
Not seeing what they see
Not seeing what they see, oh
