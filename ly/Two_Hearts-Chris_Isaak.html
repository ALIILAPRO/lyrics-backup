		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No stars in the sky
The night seems so dark around you
You won't say a word
And wonder why no one's found you
Waiting for love
Praying for love again

Love's a heavy weight, give it to me don't hesitate
Love's a heavy thing, too heavy for one heart to bring me your love
Give me your love again, it's not your fault
One heart can never win it takes

Two hearts, two hearts just to hold love
Two hearts, two hearts just to hold your love
Your love

And if your heart should ache
Remember me
And if your heart should break

Two hearts, two hearts they can mend it
Heartache, heartaches can be ended by love, by love

Love's a heavy weight
Give it to me don't hesitate
Love's a heavy thing
Too heavy for one heart to bring me your love
Give me your love again, it's not too late
One heart can never win, it takes two hearts

Two hearts just to hold love
Two hearts, two hearts just to hold your love
Your love
