		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been loving you too long to stop now

You were tired and you want to be free
My love is growing stronger, as you become a habit to me
Ooh, I've been loving you too long
I don't want to stop now, oh

With you my life has been so wonderful
I can't stop now

You were tired and your love is growing cold
My love is growing stronger as our affair, affair grows old
I've been loving you, oh, too long, long to stop now
Oh, oh oh
I've been loving you a little too long
I don't want to stop now
Oh, oh

Don't make me stop now, oh, baby
I'm down on my knees, just please, don't make me stop now

I love you, I love you
I love you with all of my heart
And I can't stop now
Please, please, please don't, don't make me stop now, yeah
Oh, talkin' 'bout heart and soul, crying
Crying out loud
