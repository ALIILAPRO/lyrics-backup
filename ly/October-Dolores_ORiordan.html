		  October, October
The summer is over
I'm going through changes
I see you again

It's so thought provoking
Emotion evoking
I can't turn around
I don't want to pretend

You stand in my way
With nothing to say
You think you're the world
I'm so lost without you
I'm sorry my friend
This is not the end
I'll do it without you
I'll do it again

October, October
The summer is over
I'm moving in circles
I'm trying to come in

It's my evolution
The only solution
The torment it's all that
I'm holding within

You stand in my way
With nothing to say
You think you're the world
I'm so lost without you
I'm sorry my friend
This is not the end
I'll do it without you
I'll do it again

You stand in my way
You've nothing to say
You think you're the world
I'm so lost without you
I'm sorry my friend
This is not the end
I'll do it without you
I'll do it again

Don't stand in my way
With nothing to say
And think you're the world
I'm so lost without you
I'm sorry my friend
This is not the end
I'll do it without you
I'll do it again
