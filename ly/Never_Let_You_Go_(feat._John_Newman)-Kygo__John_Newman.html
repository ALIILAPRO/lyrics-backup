		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Emotions like summer
We'll wake to a blue sky
And I turned to hold you
As we watched the sunrise
'Cause this is amazing
Running wild with you
My thoughts are hazy
This may be way too soon

But I will never let you go
Never let you go, I know
I will never let you go
Never let you go, no, no

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

I'm so lost in these summer nights
So lost in your crystal eyes
And even when this night is day
I won't regret the words I'm saying

Yeah I will never let you go
Never let you go, I know
I will never let you go
Never let you go, no, no

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

Through the longest of time I will never let you go
(Never let you go, I'll never let you go)
If we fall or stumble down I will always keep a hold
(Never let you go, never let you go)
Through the longest of time I will never let you go
(Never let you go, never let you go)
If we fall or stumble down I will always keep a hold, oh-no

Yeah I will never let you go
Never let you go, I know
I will never let you go
Never let you go, no, no

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
