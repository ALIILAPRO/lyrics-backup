		  Cook that shit up Quay
Baby
4 Pockets
Yeah that's my dawg, yeah

Yeah that's my dawg for sure
Yeah that's my dawg
Yeah that's my dawg for sure
Yeah that's my dawg
Me and my dawg
We gave 'em two in a row
Me and my dawg
We gave 'em two in a row
Deja keep on callin'
She say she ready to pull up
As soon as I get there, walk in
I'mma put her in a full nelson
I'm on my way, I'm goin' fast, I'm comin' home to get you
I'm on my way, I'm goin' fast, I'm comin' home to get you

Hundred thousand dollars on my neck
'Nother fifty thousand on my wrist
Every nigga with me real rich
Niggas havin' pressure 'bout a bitch
I got all my cases dismissed
I don't go back and forth on the internet
Real niggas don't get into that
I'm tryna get in her mouth, for real
I'm tryna get in her mouth
Me and my dawgs, me and my dawgs
We tryna run in your house
We want them bricks, we want the money
You can keep all of the pounds
I can't be fuckin' these lil bitty bitches
'Cause they be runnin' they mouthes
I'm really runnin' H-Town
Frank Mueller watch for my wrist
'Nother thirty thousand in my fit
Codeine all in my piss
I don't take drugs no more
Baby mama trippin' 'bout a bitch
I'm just tryna take care my kid
I been in the trenches getting rich
I don't know another way to go

That's my dawg for sure
Yeah that's my dawg
Yeah that's my dawg for sure
Yeah that's my dawg
Me and my dawg
We gave 'em two in a row
Me and my dawg
We gave 'em two in a row
Deja keep on callin'
She say she ready to pull up
As soon as I get there, walk in
I'mma put her in a full nelson
I'm on my way, I'm goin' fast, I'm comin' home to get you
I'm on my way, I'm goin' fast, I'm comin' home to get you

Bust down Rollies for the clique
Got these bitches dancing on the dick
They gon' wait in line for this drip
I'mma give her mine then dip
I'mma try to kill her for the real
Thirty thousand dollars in my ear
I ain't gotta sign no deal
Made a half a mil last year
I just came home from the can
Twenty days, whole hundred bands
Got a nigga feelin' like the man
All these bitches knowin' who I am
Hit the ground running, I ain't playin'
Put a hundred bricks in the van
Give a thousand pounds to my man
Blow the money fast as I can
Signed to the streets, no advance
Bitches tryna rip me out my pants
'Cause they heard a youngin' gettin' bands
They ain't know that I ain't goin' for nothin'
Only gave the bitch a couple hundred
Big dawg, nigga you a runner
Run off on the plug, change my number
Drop top coupes for the summer

That's my dawg for sure
Yeah that's my dawg
Yeah that's my dawg for sure
Yeah that's my dawg
Me and my dawg
We gave 'em two in a row
Me and my dawg
We gave 'em two in a row
Deja keep on callin'
She say she ready to pull up
As soon as I get there, walk in
I'mma put her in a full nelson
I'm on my way, I'm goin' fast, I'm comin' home to get you
I'm on my way, I'm goin' fast, I'm comin' home to get you

Just me and my dawgs
We gon' take 'em down two in a row
We gon' take 'em down two in a row
We gon' take 'em down two in a row
Just me and my dawgs
I'mma put her in a full nelson
As soon as I get there, I'mma put her in a full nelson
