		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now Mary
Can't you find a way
To bring me down?

I'm so sorry
That I had to go
And let you down

Knowing you I'll think
Things are gonna be fine
But then again you'll
Probably change your mind

I'm sorry Mary but
Being your mate
Means trying to find something
That you aren't going to hate

What a season
To be beautiful
Without a reason

Knowing you I'll think
Things are gonna be fine
But then again you'll
Probably change your mind

Mary
Can't you find a way
To bring me down?
