		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I don't see her each day, I miss her
Gee, what a thrill each time I kiss her
Believe me, I've got a case 
On Nancy with the laughin' face
She takes the winter and she makes it summer
And summer could take a few lessons from her
Picture a tomboy in lace
That's Nancy with the laughin' face
Did you ever heard mission bells ringin'?
Well, she'll give you the very same glow
When she speaks you would think it was singin'
Just hear her say hello
I swear to goodness you can't resist her
Sorry for you, she has no sister
No angel could replace
Nancy with the laughin' face
