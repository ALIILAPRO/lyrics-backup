		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do you remember the way that it used to be?
I waited for you
Kept on searching with me
Feeling free
Wanting to see each other all the time
Those were the days
Nothing to lose and nothing to find

See how you're laughing with those you don't know as well
I hear you saying I'm the one but I wish I could tell
Ain't it funny how time can make you realize and realize
And realize

But I'll take all of it
Don't want to leave it behind
I'll take all of it
If it's only real in my mind
Real in my mind
Real in my mind

Will you ever
Will you ever know the same love that I've known?
Will you ever
Will you ever know the same love that I've known?
Will you ever
Will you ever know the same love that I've known?
Will you, will you, will you?
Even when it's all on my own
All on my own
All on my own

Do you remember the way that it used to be?
I waited for you
You kept on searching with me
Feeling free
Wanting to see each other all the time
Those were the days
Nothing to lose and nothing to find
