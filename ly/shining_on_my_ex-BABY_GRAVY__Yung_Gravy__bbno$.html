		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  (It's bbno$)

Why she tryna bite me?
Why she tryna 'dict me?
Flow be kinda frightenin'
Pull up like it's Spike Lee
Better tread lightly
Neck, it look like ice cream
Teeth slightly gold
Yeah, it need a bit of whitening

Johnny Depp, Boba Fett, Elizabeth
Lil' check, lavishness 
Yeah, it's shinin' on my ex
Yeah, what's next? 
Huh, shinin' on my ex
Yeah, what's next? 
Bitch, shinin' on my ex
Yeah, what's next?
Off the Triple Sec, stuntin' on my ex
Gettin' PnB Rock type neck
That ain't a weird flex
Shinin' on my ex 
Yeah, what's next, bitch?
Shinin' on my ex 
Yeah, what's next, bitch?

Thank you (uh), next
Send a text to your next bitch while I'm fuckin' on your ex
And the text real direct (yup)
Wreck-it Ralph playin' HD 
'Cause the coochie gettin' wrecked (big time)
She like, "Damn, you romantic," aye, aye, aye, aye
Gravy speakin' Spanish like I ain't even planned it (whoa)
Hit it twice, then I vanish
Walk up out the crib with a ice cream sandwich

Shinin' on my ex with my neck, bitch
Got them brown hundreds, I don't need a switch
All these sound copies, I don't need a pitch
Why your girl ask me how the hell I get my clean fit?

Johnny Depp, Boba Fett, Elizabeth
Lil' check, lavishness 
Yeah, it's shinin' on my ex
Yeah, what's next? 
Huh, shinin' on my ex
Yeah, what's next? 
Bitch, shinin' on my ex
Yeah, what's next?
Off the Triple Sec, stuntin' on my ex
Gettin' PnB Rock type neck
That ain't a weird flex
Shinin' on my ex 
Yeah, what's next, bitch?
Shinin' on my ex 
Yeah, what's next, bitch?

Dude, I'd be pissed off if this song blew up on TikTok

Huh, I just copped a Honda, trip this shit (ooh)
And I'm with the quick, Denzel on my wrist
Your girl be tryna lick
You lookin' like some plaque, I'm a toothpick
Money feelin' exponential, glad I'm mathematic
Flip a bag, I'm acrobatic (woo)
Couple foreign ass rugs in my crib, Aladdin (Aladdin)
Money keep comin' in, always want Madden (mad)
Droppin' to the terrace, yeah, comin' for me clappin'
And the milli' gettin' close, yeah, I'm closin' in the gap (aye)

Huh, shinin' on my ex 
Yeah, what's next, bitch?
Shinin' on my ex 
Yeah, what's next? Huh
Shinin' on my ex
Yeah, what's next? (Yeah, what's next? Yeah, what's next?)
'Cause I'm shinin' on my ex, huh
Shinin' on my ex 
Yeah, what's next, bitch?
Shinin' on my ex 
Yeah, what's next?
Shinin' on my ex 
Yeah, what's next, bitch?
Shinin' on my ex,
Yeah, what's next, bitch?
