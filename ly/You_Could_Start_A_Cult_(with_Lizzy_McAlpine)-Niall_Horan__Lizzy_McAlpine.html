		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Darlin', I will give up everything
Who I'll be and who I am
You can have it all
Baby, you could start a cult, you see
Anywhere you go, I'll be
You are so much more than beautiful to me

Oh, I'll follow you 'til there's no tomorrow
I'll follow you 'til there's no tomorrow
I'll follow you 'til there's no tomorrow
I'll follow you

Swear you, you could start a war or two
Kingdoms fightin' over you
To wake up by your side is all I wanna do

Oh, I'll follow you 'til there's no tomorrow
I'll follow you 'til there's no tomorrow
I'll follow you 'til there's no tomorrow
I'll follow you

Baby, you could start a cult, you see
They will say that we're crazy
But you are so much more than beautiful to me
