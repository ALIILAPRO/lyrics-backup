		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Told myself I'ma put up this
Shot for Cal right quick
What up, Cal, man, how you been?
Still need to go trap shootin' pull

I got the whole world in my hands
I got God up inside me, you
See it in my stance, uh
I might fuck your girl tonight, man
I ain't goin' out sorry
These other niggas can
What I do? Keep my foot
On all these niggas necks
Where I been? NikeLab plottin' on a check
How I'm doin'? Not cool, too bad
I'm blessed heard you been in line forever
Well, that's too bad, i'm next

I got hoes that wanna fuck me
I just don't be hittin' up
Got a bitch that's so in love with me
I just can't give it up
I go sober then relapse
It's like I just can't get enough
All this shit up in my system
Make me struggle sittin' up, uh
Pleasе don't get too used to me
'causе I'm a rolling stone, bitch
Soon as I ain't diggin' what
We doin', then I'm gone, bitch
We could fuck forever long as
That's all that you want
Don't be shocked when I start actin'
Like I'm never by the phone, bitch
She say she ain't met nobody like me, baby
Get in line
Need to learn the difference between kind
And one of a kind
Fuck 'em like I love 'em, I
Ain't tryin', but fuck it, i'm tryin'
I can hit 'em both if I decide
Fuck one at a time stuntin' like my daddy
Stumblin' like my uncles
I got bad habit's, tryna be more humble
Stuntin' like my daddy
Stumblin' like my uncles
I got bad habit's, none of 'em is fumble, uh

I got the whole world in my hands
I got God up inside me, you
See it in my stance, uh
I might fuck your girl tonight, man
I ain't goin' out sorry
These other niggas can
What I do? Keep my foot
On all these niggas necks
Where I been? NikeLab plottin' on a check
How I'm doin'? Not cool, too bad
I'm blessed heard you been in line forever
Well, that's too bad, i'm next

I had enough (yeah)
Dealin' with these petty-ass
Pussy-ass niggas, it's been too rough
(yeah) icin' down my Icecream hoodies
With my chain, i'm Shia LaBust
(Down) down like hell
She down like hell 'cause she's a succubus
(Suck) she suck, you bust
(O oh) , how could I not cuff? (yeah)
In fact, I cuffed her bigger
Than Michael Jordan jeans, that's love
(2-3)
Or maybe that's fashion, maybe he braggin'
Maybe he ancient, maybe he dragon
Look at my nuts, see how they draggin'
Enemies bodies, see how they baggin' (yeah)
Ten toes down
(yeah) , look how they taggin' (yeah)
Please come Henny my cup
I wanna empty my cup (yeah)
So I don't feel empty when she
Give me that pussy deluxe (Mm-mm)
You get pussy in turns
(Woo) , I get pussy, no worries (yeah)
You had to use hella verbs but
We all get pussy in terms (yeah)
I'm clean like Lysol
She suck the black off me
Then suck the white off
You had your time to shine
But now it's time to cut the lights off
It's a check (yeah) , haha
It's a check, ha (Damn right) , yeah

Uh, I got the whole world in my hands
I got God up inside me, you
See it in my stance, uh
I might fuck your girl tonight, man
I ain't goin' out sorry
These other niggas can
What I do? Keep my foot
On all these niggas necks
Where I been? NikeLab plottin' on a check
How I'm doin'? Not cool, too bad
I'm blessed heard you been in line forever
Well, that's too bad, i'm next
