		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Yeah)
(Uh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Designer suites, Gucci Gloves, Chelsea boots
All my demons are cocaine fueled, electric cool
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Sugar tooth, caramel, silky smooth
Diving into Clase Azul swimming pools
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
A sex so good, make the neighbors smoke a cigarette
But I'm still bored to death

Think I'm getting too good, too good at raising hell
But I'm wearing it well
I'm getting too good, too good at raising hell
Oh, I'm ringing the bell

I run a hotel without any beds
Run a catwalk without any threads
Driving myself right into the storm
Burning my cash to keep myself warm
Staying at the party when everyone's left
What a good life, I'm living my best
I'm still bored to death

Think I'm getting too good, too good at raising hell
But I'm wearing it well
I'm getting too good, too good at raising hell
Oh, I'm ringing the bell

It' a little too easy, getting harder to please me
I know you're starving to feed me
You know that you need me
I'm getting too good, too good at raising hell
(Oh, yeah) too

Think I'm getting too good, too good at raising hell
But I'm wearing it well
I'm getting too good, too good at raising hell
Oh, I'm ringing the bell

It' a little too easy, getting harder to please me
I know you're starving to feed me
You know that you need me
I'm getting too good, too good at raising hell

Oh, yeah, too good
(Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
(Woo, woo, woo) aw come on, man, you know what I'm sayin'?
(Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
(Woo, woo, woo) turn around, show me somethin' stupid
Yeah, oh, oh
Yeah

Well, you know what we say
We say
(Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Woo, woo, woo, hey
(Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
(Woo, woo, woo)
Ah, we are, babe
