		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I caught your eye
Like to make you think that I’m shy
Say I look nice
‘Cause you know I need attention to thrive

I can be anyone and everybody wants to be me
I’ve got you fooled if you think you’re gonna get what you see
Everything you want, don’t you wish you’d get it for free

Don’t you wish you were me?
I bet you wish you were me

Stuck in this game but I love it
Burned out like my last cigarette
Everyone knows me, feels like I’m slowly
Dying but at least I’m cool on the Internet

Can’t trust my friends so I keep them close
Stab me in the back, saw it coming though
Cause I’ve got two faces, you don’t wanna meet the ugly one
I like to keep them scared
I’m a gemini nightmare

I can be anyone and everybody wants to be me
I’ve got you fooled if you think you’re gonna get what you see
Everything you want, don’t you wish you’d get it for free
Don’t you wish you were me?
I bet you wish you were me

Stuck in this game but I love it
Burned out like my last cigarette
Everyone knows me, feels like I’m slowly
Dying but at least I’m cool on the Internet
