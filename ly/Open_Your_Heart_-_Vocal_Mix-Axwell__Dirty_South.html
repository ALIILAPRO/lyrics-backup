		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wherever you go
I'll be with you
If you want to
Whatever you know
No lies, it's true
I'll be there too
If you need somebody
To care for you
Oh, let me be
The one to stay
The one to stand
Come and take my hand
Hey, don't you worry
Confide in me when I
Say not to worry
'Cause I'll be by your side
Hey, don't you worry
Confide in me when I
Say not to worry
'Cause I'll be by your side
Hey, don't you worry
Confide in me when I
Say not to worry
'Cause I'll be by your side
Hey, don't you worry
Confide in me when I
Say not to worry
'Cause I'll be by your side
Whoever you be
See the color
Doesn't matter
You can count on me
Ask a favour
Let me help you
If you need somebody
To care for you
Oh, let me be
The one to stay
The one to stand
Come and take my hand
Hey, don't you worry
Confide in me when I
Say not to worry
'Cause I'll be by your side
Everything gonna be alright
I see clearly
Oh, believe me
After darkness comes the light
Come on, trust me
Don't you worry
Hey, don't you worry
Confide in me when I
Say not to worry
'Cause I'll be by your side
Hey, don't you worry
Confide in me when I
Say not to worry
'Cause I'll be by your side
