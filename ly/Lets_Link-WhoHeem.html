		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
Huh
Baby
I like you, so what you tryna do?
I don't give a fuck 'bout your boyfriend (M.A. on the track)

I like you, I don't give a fuck 'bout your boyfriend
Come on, let's link, can't do what I do, I can beat it up with no hands
Treat you like you monarchy, we can slide out, touch bands
Come on, let's link, can't do what I do, I can beat it up with no hands
Come on with Heem (ah), come on with Heem (ah)
Come on, let's link (ah), come on, let's link (ah)
I like you, I don't give a fuck 'bout your boyfriend
Come on, let's link, can't do what I do, I can beat it up with no hands

Prada baby, she a flocker
Don't let any nigga hit, so they call her a bopper
Can't no bitch top her
She got a squabble like a nigga, yeah, she get it from her father
Sex in the City girls
Nails done, lemon braids, they're so pretty, girl, ah
She don't be in any world
Wrong shoe, wrong fit, no Cinderella, girl
Car basic
Bro big mad it's not him, now she chasin'
Two weeks, he couldn't find a replacement
He done lost a good bitch, downgraded to a basic
Lane switch
Bitch is lucky, call her sour folk 'cause she change
'Cause she don't care
Sold her nigga on OfferUp, notched up
Turned off her pipe and then she bossed up
On any bitch head who got a issue
Mace a bitch up, test jaw, she might spit too
Messy, take your nigga if she want to
Give him pussy, got him stuck, he said I love you on the first day
You bitches couldn't see her on her worst day
Fly bitch like first day of school on her birthday
Ooh, she nasty, F-R-E-A-K
Ride dick, bycic'
Make a nigga bust in a M-I-N
Oh, that's what I like, baby, ah
That's what I like

I like you, I don't give a fuck 'bout your boyfriend
Come on, let's link, can't do what I do, I can beat it up with no hands
I like you, I don't give a fuck 'bout your boyfriend
Come on, let's link, can't do what I do, I can beat it up with no hands
Treat you like you monarchy, we can slide out, touch bands
Come on with Heem, can't do what I do, I can beat it up with no hands
Come on with Heem (ah), come on with Heem (ah)
Come on, let's link (ah), what you tryna do? (ah)
I like you, I don't give a fuck 'bout your boyfriend
Come on, let's link, can't do what I do, I can beat it up with no hands
