		<p>
		  Gratias agimus
Agimus tibi
Propter magnam gloriam
Propter gloriam tuam
Domine Deus, Rex coelestis
Oh Domine Deus
Pater omnipotens

Don't go away, don't go away
Forever and ever we'll go on
Don't go away, don't go away
There's no other place where you belong
Don't go away

Oh Domine Deus
Pater omnipotens
Oh Domine Deus
Pater omnipotens

Don't go away, don't go away
Forever and ever we'll go on
Don't go away, don't go away
There's no other place where you belong

Don't go away, don't go away            (Oh Domine Deus)
I'll give in to you with all my love       (Pater omnipotens)
Don't go away, don't go away            (Oh Domine Deus)
Forever and ever we'll go on              (Pater omnipotens)

Oh Domine Deus (Oh Domine Deus)
Pater omnipotens

Don't go away, don't go away
Forever and ever we'll go on
Don't go away, don't go away                    (Oh Domine Deus)
There's no other place where you belong    (Pater omnipotens)

Don't go away, don't go away            (Oh Domine Deus)
Forever and ever we'll go on              (Pater omnipotens)
Don't go away, don't go away            (Oh Domine Deus)
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na                  (Pater omnipotens)
Don't go away, don't go away            (Oh Domine Deus)
Forever and ever we'll go on              (Pater omnipotens)
