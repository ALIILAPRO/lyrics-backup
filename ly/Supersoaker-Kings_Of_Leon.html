		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My motivation is going to soon, good vibrations all over you,
Act like you mean it, you mean it,
You gotta story you never tell, down in the delta ringing bells,
I've never seen it, seen it
Back of my mind I'm on my way, I see through smiles on every face
I don't believe it, believe it

Cause' I'm a Supersoaker red and white and blew 'em all away
With the kisses unclean as the words that you say
I don't mind sentimental girls at times
Miss don't walk away, walk away

The flags are flying across the plains
I got a secret picking in my brain
I wanna see you, see you
Yes, the sign is on my face
Don't know my home, I don't know my place
I just wanna be there, be there

'Cause I'm the Supersoaker, red white and blew 'em all away
With the kisses unclean as the words that you say

I don't mind sentimental girls at times
Miss don't walk away, walk away
I don't mind sentimental girls at times
Miss don't walk away, whoa oh oh

I don't mind sentimental girls at times
I just lay it on the line, on the line

I don't mind sentimental girls at times
Miss don't walk away, walk away
I don't mind sentimental girls at times
Miss don't walk away, oh oh oh oh
