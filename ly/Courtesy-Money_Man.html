		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  These red bottom boots bae, these ain't Timbs
On a DMT drug and I'm selling weed pens
Only real in the Circle, I don't fuck with fake friends
On this high grade flower, so I'm going up to Mercury (Yo Nflated, spice that bitch up)
Gave her CareCredit 'cause she said she wanted surgery 
I'ma get the pack there goin' with some urgency
All my diamonds flashing like an ambulance emergency
Vacuum seal it for you, I'ma show a little courtesy
I just left France, I got overseas currency
All my exes love me, they regret that we broke up
Two Latina bitches with me getting coked up
Plug got a nigga waitin', damn, what's the hold up?
When the shit done drying, I'ma buy the whole yield
They know I'm growing indoor, you can tell from the light bill

I'ma start a pandemic just like Chinese
Countin' up while watching Netflix, Stranger Things
Niggas ain't ballin', they can never ever make the team
Nigga, this is exotic weed, I don't do the nicotine
Pretty bitch ridin' with me, she got high self-esteem
Presidential Rollie, nigga, bustdown Jubilee
Bought a Trackhawk just to get from point A to B
Even when I was a child, niggas couldn't play with me

Told my old lady nigga touch her, I'ma kill his ass
Got a blue check, I ain't talkin' bout Instagram
Had to buy a Euro cut suit, I'ma businessman
I ain't got time for the gossip, I'ma busy man
I don't do the Gucci, nigga, I don't do the Dapper Dan
I'm the type to mail a bag of loud to my biggest fan
I can't let shit slide, I can't be the bigger man
I ain't talkin' college, but my shoes cost a couple bands
D&G on, lil' six-hundred on my belt
Don't need no shooters, I'll shoot 'em myself
Don't need to weapons, I'll serve 'em myself
I want that green like a motherfuckin' Celtic
All my shit fire, when I touch it, it's melted
I wanna touch on you bae, I swear that I can't help it (c'mon)
They don't want war 'cause them niggas gone lose
Told my lil' chick lose the damn attitude
I'm not afraid to get rid of you
Play with the gang, bullets riddle you
I am not normal, not typical
My African scammers Somalian
Got ZaZa smoke all in my oxygen

I'ma start a pandemic just like Chinese
Countin' up while watching Netflix, Stranger Things
Niggas ain't ballin', they can never ever make the team
Nigga, this is exotic weed, I don't do the nicotine
Pretty bitch ridin' with me, she got high self-esteem
Presidential Rollie, nigga, bustdown Jubilee
Bought a Trackhawk just to get from point A to B
Even when I was a child, niggas couldn't play with me
