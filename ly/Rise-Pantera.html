		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Go

We've got no time to lose
Your news is old news
Hate this, hate me, hate this
Right approach for the wrong

It's time to spread the word
Let the voice be heard
All of us, one of us, all of us
Dominate and take the motherfucking world

Mass prediction, unification
Breathing life into our lungs
Every creed and every kind
To give us depth for strength

Taught when we're young to hate one another
It's time to have a new reign of power
Make pride universal so no one gives in
Turn our backs on those who oppose
Then when confronted we ask them the question
What's wrong with their mind?
What's wrong with your mind?

It's time to rise
Rise, rise
It's time to rise

We've lived with past mistakes
And we've lived with our own
Forgive, forget forgive
Be a man, not a child

There are no tears for peace
Of the common sympathies
Educate, reinstate, educate
A thing of past, the trouble in the states

Mass prediction, unification
Breathing life into our lungs
Every creed and every kind
To give us depth for strength

Taught when we're young to hate one another
It's time to have a new reign of power
Make pride universal so no one gives in
Turn our backs on those who oppose
Then when confronted we ask them the question
What's wrong with their mind?
What's wrong with your mind?

It's time to rise
Rise, rise
It's time to rise

Mass prediction, unification
Breathing life into our lungs
Every creed and every kind
To give us depth for strength

Taught when we're young to hate one another
It's time to have a new reign of power
Make pride universal so no one gives in
Turn our backs on those who oppose
Then when confronted we ask them the question
What's wrong with their mind?
What's wrong with your mind?

It's time to rise
Rise, rise
It's time to rise
