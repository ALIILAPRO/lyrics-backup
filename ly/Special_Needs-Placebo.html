		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Remember me when you're the one who's silver screen
Remember me when you're the one you always dreamed
Remember me when everyone's noses start to bleed
Remember me, special needs

Just 19 and sucker's dream I guess I thought you had the flavor
Just 19 and dream obscene with six months off for bad behavior

Remember me when you clinch your movie deal
And think of me stuck in my chair that has four wheels
Remember me through flash photography and screams
Remember me, special dreams

Just 19 this sucker's dream I guess I thought you had the flavor
Just 19 and dream obscene with six months off for bad behavior
Just 19 and sucker's dream I guess I thought you had the flavor
Just 19 and dream obscene with six months off for bad behavior

Remember me

Just 19 this sucker's dream I guess I thought you had the flavor
Just 19 and dream obscene with six months off for bad behavior
Just 19 and sucker's dream I guess I thought you had the flavor
Just 19 and dream obscene with six months off for bad behavior

Remember me
