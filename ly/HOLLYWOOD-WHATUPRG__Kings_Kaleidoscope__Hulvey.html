		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Glory and praise to Thee
I'll follow the trail to Heaven, yeah
Glory and praise to Thee
I'll follow the trail to Heaven, yeah

Mm, in the limelight, it was so cold
Lucy had me in a chokehold
Way too long, way too long
Broke them chains and came back home
Okay let's go baby, I'm back, back, back
Back like I never left
2019, couldn't get no rest 10
21, and I haven't slept
Had to remind myself I'm blessed
I can't live my life depressed, I rest
In knowing the Father don't check for best
He's looking for spirit and truth
It feel like heaven on earth
It feel like heaven on earth
I had to give it to God
I graduate from the dirt
Don't gotta sway with the wind
If He's looking out for the birds
Look what He did in me
Look what He did in me
Praise to the Lord, praise to the Lord
Praise to the Lord I'm alive
Give you my heart, give you my soul
You got a hold of my life
No matter the cost, no matter the
Pain, I pick up my cross, stand on my faith
I know what I was and what I became
I'll die for Your name and live unashamed
Mm, mm (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Father, I am home again
It's a love that doesn't ever end
(Doesn't end, oh, no, no)
Through the times and times I fell in sin
(Time after time after time)
Lord, You call me, call me back again
(I don't know how You love me this way
But I'm Yours)
Father, I am home again (Father, I am home)
It's a love that doesn't ever end
(Doesn't end, oh, no, no)
Through the times and times I fell in sin
(Time after time after time)
Lord, You call me, call me back again
