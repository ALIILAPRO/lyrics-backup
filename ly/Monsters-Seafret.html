		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Cold in the dark 
With the sound of my heart
Hiding alone down on the floor
Out of my depth
And I'm holding my breath
Don't wanna go outside the door
 
Paralysed by my own emotion
Out of my mind looking for a way out of here
Terrified and my feet are frozen
Something inside got me wondering is this real?
Is this real?
 
I'm hearing voices in my head
I don't want to hear
I don't want to fear
 
Say you ain't afraid of nothing
Everybody's scared of something  
 
Smoke in my chest
From my last cigarette 
And the dogs start to howl at the moon
Black silhouettes come to haunt me again
Creeping out from the shadows of the room
 
Paralysed by my own emotion
Something inside got me wondering is this real?
Is this real?
 
I'm hearing voices in my head
I don't want to hear
I don't want to fear
I'm seeing monsters in my bed
I don't want to see
I don't want to fear
 
Say you ain't afraid of nothing
Everybody's scared of something  
 
I want to let you know
I ain't afraid no more
I want to let you know
 
I'm hearing voices in my head
I don't want to hear
I don't want to fear
I'm seeing monsters in my bed
I don't want to see
I don't want to fear
 
I want to let you know
I want to let you know
I want to let you know
 
Say you ain't afraid of nothing
Everybody's scared of something
