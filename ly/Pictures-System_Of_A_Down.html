		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Flaunt your will at every wheel
Perish it, your chocolate soul
Cobblestones under your wheels

I got pictures on my mind
I got pictures on my mind
I got pictures on my mind
I got pictures on my mind

Circumvent your thick ego
When in fights, they're on the go
You can't tell me that I'm real

I got pictures on my mind
I got pictures on my mind
I got pictures on my mind
I got pictures on my mind

Fear waits (fear waits)
For us (for us)
When the present can't be sealed
Away (away)
Gold dust (gold dust)
Now the dishes can be cleared

Fear waits
For us (for us)
'Til the moment is revealed (revealed)
Then turns (then turns)
To rust (to rust)
For the mighty conquered meal

Can't you look at my shaved ass
Ounce is gone, and God is once
You can't see me suddenly

I got pictures on my mind
I got pictures on my mind
I got pictures on my mind
I got pictures on my mind

I got pictures on my mind
