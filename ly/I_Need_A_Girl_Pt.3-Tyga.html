		  Cash Money, AP
Pour the Ciroc, yeah, I'm Puff Daddy
I need that girl that'll ri-ri-ride (5, 4, 3, 2, 1)

Yeah, I need a girl, girlfriend (yeah, I'm with you)
But I'm with you, spending most of my time
Does that make you my girl, uh, girlfriend?
Hoes text, I don't reply, baby mad like you must have a girl
Girlfriend, ooh, I think I like her (my girlfriend)
I want that girl to be my girl
'Cause when it's cold outside
I just lay up with bae

Fucking with my girl
Diamonds dancing in the club with my girl
Nigga, don't be bumping into my girl
Bruh, this ain't no thottie
Bruh, this ain't just anybody
I can't trust anybody but my girl
Spice girl, your smile lights up my world
Like a moth to the flame, my love is blind, you see my desires
I'm never sober, getting higher and higher with my girl
Yeah, I'm Puff Daddy
I need a girl that'll ri-ri-ride
Pour the Ciroc, yeah, yeah, I'm Puff Daddy
I need a girl in my life

Will you be my girlfriend? (yeah, I'm with you)
But I'm with you, spending most of my time
Does that make you my girl, uh, girlfriend?
Hoes text, I don't reply, baby mad like you must have a girl
Girlfriend, ooh, I think I like her (my girlfriend)
I want that girl to be my girl
'Cause when it's cold outside
I just lay up with bae

Fucking with my girl
Ooh, my, my, my, my girlfriend
Ooh, my, my, my, my girlfriend
My girl
Ooh, my, my, my, my girlfriend
Ooh, my, my, my, my
My girl

Is better than yours, aha
Is wetter than yours, aha
She coming to see me like I'm going on tour
I remember when she was unsure, oh, ayy
I had to call her and call her some more
Now when we copping, we call up the store
But the Porsche don't ri-ride it
My girl ain't inside it
My wrist like Visene
Her wrist just like mine
Crown and you're rich, yeah, you're my queen
Said I'm fortunate to have you, girl

I want you to be my girlfriend (yeah, I'm with you)
But I'm with you, spending most of my time
Does that make you my girl, uh, girlfriend?
Hoes text, I don't reply, baby mad like you must have a girl
Girlfriend, ooh, I think I like her (my girlfriend)
I want that girl to be my girl
'Cause when it's cold outside
I just lay up with bae

Fucking with my girl
Ooh, my, my, my, my girlfriend
Ooh, my, my, my, my girlfriend
Fucking with my girl
