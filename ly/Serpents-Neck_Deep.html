		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't get too close
That place is haunted
Fear not the ghosts
'Cause she sent them running

She sleeps beneath the surface
Consorting with the serpents
She strikes without a purpose

A dark face in a corridor
Deceptively beautiful
She's watching you
She's in everything you do
Her kiss it tastes so sweet
But left me with a lethargy
I couldn't shake, I made a grave mistake

I gave her my heart, she didn't want it
Took it anyway and put a dark spell on it
Since then I haven't been the same
Needed a victim and she got it
Took me in with her song, powerless to stop it
Some men don't dare to speak her name

She picked me up from my decline
Healed my wounds with love and wine
Dosed me up and closed my eyes
A taste of poison
She gave me all that I desired
Sung the songs of angel choirs
Preached the words of death and fire and left me burning

I gave her my heart, she didn't want it
Took it anyway and put a dark spell on it
Since then I haven't been the same
Needed a victim and she got it
Took me in with her song, powerless to stop it
Some men don't dare to speak her name

She sleeps beneath the surface
Consorting with the serpents
She strikes without a purpose
