		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

I feel the salty waves come in, I feel them crash against my skin
And I smile as I respire because I know they'll never win
There's a haze above my TV that changes everything I see
And maybe if I continue watchin', I'll lose the traits that worry me

Can we fast-forward to go down on me?

Stop there, and let me correct it
I wanna live a life from a new perspective
You come along because I love your face
And I'll admire your expensive taste, and
Who cares? Divine intervention
I wanna be praised from a new perspective
But leaving now would be a good idea
So catch me up on gettin' out of here

Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
(Can we fast-forward to go down on me?)
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

Taking everything for granted, but we still respect the time
We move along with some new passion knowing everything is fine
(Everything is fine)
And I would wait and watch the hours fall in a hundred separate lines
But I regain repose and wonder how I ended up inside (up inside)

Can we fast-forward to go down on me?

Stop there, and let me correct it
I wanna live a life from a new perspective
You come along because I love your face
And I'll admire your expensive taste, and
Who cares? Divine intervention
I wanna be praised from a new perspective
But leaving now would be a good idea
So catch me up on gettin' out of here
Catch me up on gettin' out of here

More to the point, I need to show
How much I can come and go
Other plans fell through
And put a heavy load on you, I know
There's no more that need be said
When I'm inching through your bed
Take a look around instead, and watch me go
Ah, ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah, ah

Stop there, and let me correct it
I wanna live a life from a new perspective
You come along because I love your face
And I'll admire your expensive taste, and
Who cares? Divine intervention
I wanna be praised from a new perspective
But leaving now would be a good idea
So catch me up on gettin' out of here
It's not fair, just let me perfect it
Don't wanna live a life that was comprehensive
'Cause seeing clear would be a bad idea
Now catch me up on gettin' out of here
So catch me up on gettin' out of here

Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
(G-g-go down on me)
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
(Can we fast-forward to go down?)
