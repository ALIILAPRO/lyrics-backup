		<p>
		  Alright children, the lights are out, and the party's over
It's time for me, Dr. D, to start running and say goodbye, for a little while
And I know you're gonna miss me, so I'll leave you with this
You know that big ball of radiation we call the sun
Well it'll burst you into flames if you stay in one place too long
That is if the static don't get you first
So remember, even if you're dusted, you may be gone,
But out here in the desert, your shadow lives on without you
This is Dr. Desert, signing off
