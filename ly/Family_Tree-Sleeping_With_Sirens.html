		<p>
		  Yeah
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa

Do I look defective, or am I infected?
Is this a lesson, some kind of lesson?
'Cause I feel rejected, and you, you walk out the door
I guess this house ain't a home
Not anymore, no
It's not the first time that I felt this way (felt this way)
Where I watch you pack it up and just be on your way
You don't care who you hurt
I think that you might be cursed
And what's worse, I think you cursed me the same

Oh, what a shame (what a shame)

Welcome to my family tree (family tree)
We may look perfect to some, but
The roots underneath are dead in the ground
You chose to walk away
I guess there's nothing else to say

Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa

You walked away
I'll never be the same
All you gave me was your last name

What are you running away from?
Does it make you feel better?
I hope that someday you will find yourself
Do you remember the card that you sent?
It's in a box on my shelf
I just wish you would have told me yourself

Welcome to my family tree (family tree)
We may look perfect to some
But the roots underneath
Are dead in the ground
You chose to walk away
I guess there's nothing else to say

Welcome to my family tree (family tree)
You carved your name in my heart
And then you set me free
And my tears fall down to the ground
You walked away, I'll never be the same
All you gave me was your last name

You made this house your home (you made this house your home)
Now it's a place I don't even know
With every word left unspoken (with every word left unspoken)
Now all I am is broken (now all I have is broken)
Is this what you call a family?
Is this what you call a family?
Guess we'll never know
We'll never know

Welcome my family tree
We might look perfect to some
But the roots underneath
Are dead in the ground
You chose to walk away
I guess there's nothing else to say

Welcome to my family tree (family tree)
You carved your name in my heart
And then you set me free
And my tears fall down to the ground
You walked away, I'll never be the same
All you gave me was your last name

Whoa, whoa, whoa (never be the same)
Whoa, whoa, whoa (carved your name)
Whoa, whoa, whoa (walked away)
Whoa (I'll never be the same)
All you gave me was your last name
