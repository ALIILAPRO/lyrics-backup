		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ayy, I need somebody phone
Charger, bra hold up, hold up
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy

I do Percs and I can't even eat
She keep sucking, I'm just tryna' sleep
My name Lucki with blessings on me
I got blessings and Glizzy with me
It's trouble, he looking for me
Bitch I'm cuckoo, Ja-money with me
That's my brother, he gunnin' for me
He keep woofin', he corny to me, ayy
Maybe you wanna love me, ayy
Baby you gonna love me, ayy
What I pour in this soda not cheap
I don't pour it, I can't get no sleep
I don't do this for Snap or IG
She keep saying her Snap and IG, ayy
I don't think your camera for me
Taking breaths, she keep fannin' for me
Wake a ho, ain't no Xannin' with me, ayy
I'm only Xannin' with me, ayy
These hoes be lyin' for free, ayy
I think she dying with me, ayy
You can't blame that on the drugs, ayy
My God, I'm dyin' for he, ayy
I'm rollin', I'm peelin' off E
In New York, I'm so lonely, I'm V
Model ho, she so bony tryn' feed
I pray all my niggas get freed
We still losin' from 2016
We still losin' from 2016
And I'm crying, I'm missin' the lean
Fuck aimin', I'm buyin' a beam
My brother keep lying to me
Fuck my brother, he not here with me
Ayy, fuck my brother, he not here with me
Free my brothers that's not here with me
Free my brothers that's not here with me
(Ayy, my brothers that's not here with me
Yeah)

Poppin' pills, I feel like a addict
Niggas bitches, they don't want no static
Niggas hate me but I ain't dead yet
If you shootin' it, I'm not impressed
(Pew pew pew)
Niggas bitches they know it though, cool
If you see me, don't play like we cool
OG Kush, it pick me back up
And the 30 on me leave you stuck (Pew)
I put trust in my nigga, he fell
Then I can't trust a nigga again
(Nigga, what?)
I put faith in a bitch and she fell
(Nigga, what?)
Then I want me some fucking revenge

Put my heart in the blunt like it's laced
Smoke it up and then go outer space
I don't talk and I don't want no friends
Ain't no comment, I don't do no hatin'
(Nigga, what?)
Closed circle with no interviews
We ain't takin no damn applications
Suck me up when I get out of bed
Hurry up 'cause I'm gettin' impatient
(I want the neck)
Only Benjis on me like I'm racist
'Cause I gotta keep blue on the faces
'Cause the blue in my pocket feel blessings
And I'm Crippin' but you get the message
In the cut, I be low with the tool
Yeah, yeah (Nigga, what?)
She fucked me and went back to her dude
Yeah, yeah yeah (Nigga, what?)
How could I not keep fucking her too?
How could I not? How could I not?
(yeah, nigga, what?)

Poppin' pills, I feel like a addict
Niggas bitches, they don't want no static
Niggas hate me but I ain't dead yet
If you shootin' it, I'm not impressed
(Pew, pew) yeah, yeah
Niggas bitches they know it though, cool
(All of them niggas)
If you see me, don't play like we cool
(All of them niggas)
If you see me, don't play like we cool
(All of you bitches)
OG Kush, it pick me back up
And the 30 on me leave you stuck
(Nigga, what?)
I put trust in my nigga, he fell
Then I can't trust a nigga again
I put faith in a bitch and she fell
Then I want me some fucking revenge (Glah)
All I'm seeking is fucking revenge (Glah)
Yeah, I want me some fucking revenge
