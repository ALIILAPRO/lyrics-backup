		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One of us, accept your feelings
One of us, let go of it all
One of us,  this is the real truth
One of us, break their control over you

Everything you've ever been told is a lie
This faith is a tool they've
Used to enslave you
You've been taught never to question or
Wonder why the cracks run deep
The cracks run deep the cracks run deep

Force fed this ideology indoctrinated so we
So we cannot doubt

Eyes wide open seeing (Wide open)
Deconstructing from the inside
Break free from who I was
(Break the shackles that you've
Placed on yourself)
Eyes wide open seeing (Wide open)
Deconstructing from the inside
Break free from who I was
(Break the shackles that you've
Placed on yourself)

I want to bring forth the dark
I want to be engulfed in flame
Tear down the church
And forever renounce his name

(Taken in his name) All their lives
Taken in his name (Taken in his name)
Hear their cries (Taken in his name)
Hear their cries

Fuck the salvation, let us be damned damned
Damned damned
Bring forth the dark engulf us in flames
Tear down the church engulf us in flames

Eyes wide open seeing (Wide open)
Deconstructing from the inside
Break free from who I was
(Break the shackles that you've
Placed on yourself)
Eyes wide open seeing (Wide open)
Deconstructing from the inside
Break free from who I was
(Break the shackles that you've
Placed on yourself)

Eyes wide open seeing (Wide open)
Deconstructing from the inside
Break free from who I was
(Break the shackles that you've
Placed on yourself)
Eyes wide open seeing (Wide open)
Deconstructing from the inside
Break free from who I was
(Break the shackles that you've
Placed on yourself)

Tear down the church
And forever renounce his name
