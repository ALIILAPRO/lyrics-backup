		  Hey! No alright, alright!
Bad boy, bad boy, alright, one, two, five uh!

요즘 나 조금 패닉 상황 (ha!)
솔직히 완전 홀릭인데 (hey!)
머릿속 어떤 녀석 그 생각 하나뿐이야
One one one one
One one one one, one one one one

Ah ah ah (alright, hey!)
친구들 say 걔는 안돼 너무 나빠 네가 다쳐
Ah ah ah (hey)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah) 누가 말려 내가 좋으면 가는 거죠 (oh, oh my god!)

Oh my god
He's a really bad boy
He's a really bad boy, ay
Oh my god
He's a really bad boy
He's a really really really really really bad boy

You're so bad boy
You're so bad boy
You're so bad bad bad
Bad bad bad bad bad boy

Bang bang pow he's a really bad boy
잘생긴 그 얼굴 하나 믿고 산대요
괜찮다면 널 내가 길들여 볼게 (boy)
Mine mine mine mine mine

Ah ah ah (alright, hey!)
멋대로 해 허락할게 있는 힘껏 나빠져 봐
Ah ah ah
그런 네가 변해갈 때 짜릿하지 (oh, oh my god!)

Oh my god (oh my god, oh my god)
He's a really bad boy
He's a really bad boy (oh my god)
Oh my god
He's a really bad boy
He's a really really really really really bad boy

You're so bad boy
You're so bad boy
You're so bad bad bad
Bad bad bad bad bad boy

아까워 다른 이 난 못 줘 
봐 내가 널 사랑하는데
누구라도 흠뻑 빠져버릴
(You're a bad boy and you're bad for me)
(You're a bad boy and you're bad for me)
(You're a bad boy and you're bad for me) 아무리 나빠도
(You're a bad boy and you're bad for me) 난 좋아
(You're a bad boy and you're bad for me) 봐 세상에 
(You're a bad boy and you're bad for me) 넌 빛이 나

(You're a bad boy and you're bad for me) 누구라도 흠뻑 
(You're a bad boy and you're bad for me) 빠져버릴걸
(You're a bad boy and you're bad for me) woah woa
(You're a bad boy and you're bad for me) You're a bad boy and you're bad for me

Oh my god
He's a really bad boy
He's a really really really really really bad boy
Oh my god
He's a really bad boy
He's a really bad boy (really really bad boy)
Oh my god
He's a really bad boy
He's a really bad boy (he's a really bad boy)

Oh my god
(He's a really bad boy, he's a really bad boy, he's a really bad boy)
He's a really bad boy
(Oh my god he's a really bad boy)
He's a really bad boy
(He's a really really really really really bad boy) umm
