		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I gave the best that you ever had
Gave you one dose and got you addicted
I could own that, all night and all day
Say you on my plate, girl, you so delicious
Last night we had a good time gettin' faded
Wake up in the morn', you was gone
It been on my brain all day replayin'
Like we had it on record
I miss every minute
I take plenty chances
My love for you has been a damn dimension
More than you imagine
I want all of them kisses
Mistletoe before Christmas
If you ain't got it, don't get it
If you got time, it's no limit

Baby, won't you give me something?
That I wanna do
When I see the sun set
Yeah, I think of you
I think of you
You're all I want too
Left panties by my nightstand
Now I think of you
I think of you

Loving my baby, can you give me the sweet talk?
Love's up and down, it's like living on a see-saw
Give me a favor, baby, why you blaming me for?
All I wanted was love, babe
Last night we had a real good time, we was naked
Bumping and making love
Got me with all these games you're playing
It's time for us to go
Don't care 'bout winning
Come on, baby, I got the answers
You ain't gotta be a dancer
All I need is your love
Girl, you won't change my mind
And I can see you hesitating
So, baby

Baby, won't you give me something?
That I wanna do
When I see the sun set (Oh girl)
Yeah, yeah I think of you (Baby)
I think of you
You're all I want too
Left panties by my nightstand
Now I think of you
I think of you

I wish everyday was your day off
Goin' hard every night like it's the playoffs
You give me the energy, I like to play hard
Tell me is the feelin' mutual or am I way off?
Be real, be real, stay real
Pour your heart out, baby, I won't let it spill
I know the ones before me probably said they never will
And breakin' promises will break you down 'bout how you feel
Is that an illusion, I'm not tryna add to the confusion
Break your all access codes and abuse 'em
You layin' all over me 'cause you understand me
Swear I love you so much, I love your whole family
Bedroom dresser, full of your panties
We make the room feel like summer Miami
No stressin' whenever you leave
'Cause ain't nobody in the world fuck you better than me

I think of you
