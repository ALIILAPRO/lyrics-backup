		  (We packin' Diamond Pistols)

Ayy, look at that boy, he lit, goddamn
He wildin' with your mami in Miami
Or an island sippin' Brandy, gettin' sandy and I'm smilin'
South Miami, hootenanny
Look at that boy, he lit, goddamn
He wildin' with your mami in Miami
Or an island sippin' Brandy, gettin' sandy and I'm smilin'
South Miami, hootenanny (whoa)

Got the Fanny, she deserve a Grammy
Lookin' for a mom like I'm lil' orphan Annie
Or Bambi, I'm comin' for your family
I don't want your bitch 'cause that ass flat, Stanley
I guess she from the wrong part of Florida
My whip, my cash, my bitch all flowin' us (baby)
I'm pourin' up, sittin' here ignorin' your bitch
She at church and she say I don't go enough
Snakes in the grass ain't slick, bitch, I'm owin' up
Kill the motherfuckers and the beat, call the coroner
Everything be goin' up, I'm winnin' just for showin' up
Gravy Train, bitch, yeah I got the secret formula, baby

Ooh, ooh, ooh, Jesus Murphy
Damn, why'd I have to snap?
Why'd your mama's ass just give my face a pimp slap?
Goodness

Look at that boy, he lit, goddamn
He wildin' with your mami in Miami
Or an island sippin' Brandy, gettin' sandy and I'm smilin'
South Miami, hootenanny
Look at that boy, he lit, goddamn
He wildin' with your mami in Miami
Or an island sippin' Brandy, gettin' sandy and I'm smilin'
South Miami, hootenanny (whoa)

Your mami always come in handy
She said I'm a sweetheart, Yung Candy
Tom Clancy, vag' vigilante
Gravy get up in it, every nook and cranny (honey)
I ain't gotta flex, baby, you know what I'm gettin' (whoa)
Two new hoes, a seven and eleven
New coupe, new shoes, thank you to my brethren
New, get the loot, tags haven as Heaven
Now we a the Fountainebleau
Pitbull in this bitch, stackin' ends too
Cuban dinner with your mom and her friends too
Say that shit again, if your dad did, I can too

You know what? Fuck that dance shit, drop some

Look at that boy, he lit, goddamn
He wildin' with your mami in Miami
Or an island sippin' Brandy, gettin' sandy and I'm smilin'
South Miami, hootenanny
Look at that boy, he lit, goddamn
He wildin' with your mami in Miami
Or an island sippin' Brandy, gettin' sandy and I'm smilin'
South Miami, hootenanny
Look at that boy, he lit, goddamn
He wildin' with your mami in Miami
Or an island sippin' Brandy, gettin' sandy and I'm smilin'
South Miami, hootenanny (whoa)
