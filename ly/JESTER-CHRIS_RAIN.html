		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm just a jester crying out for fucking help but ain't nobody tryna help
They always told me go to hell
Now I'm a goth star and now they care about my health
It's a story I could tell the story I could tell
I'm just a jester crying out for fucking help but ain't nobody tryna help
They always told me go to hell
Now I'm a goth star and now they care about my health
It's a story I could tell the story I could tell
I've been a diamond in the dirt and I fucking hate the underground
I've been a diamond in the dirt and I fucking hate the underground
I woke up and I found out I got cousins now
They write me letters and they say that we should definitely hang out
They treat me like I'm dumb and then they hold me upside down
And try to play it out and wanna act like brothers now
I won't open the door
And I'll hide in my home
I'll give you my all
But I'll suffer once more
I'm just a jester crying out for fucking help but ain't nobody tryna help
They always told me go to hell
Now I'm a goth star and now they care about my health
It's a story I could tell the story I could tell
I'm just a jester crying out for fucking help but ain't nobody tryna help
They always told me go to hell
Now I'm a goth star and now they care about my health
It's a story I could tell the story I could tell
