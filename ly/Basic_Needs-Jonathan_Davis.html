		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I may not act like I'm torn apart
But blood don't look deep red when the dark
Surrounds me
I may be frozen, numb from the fight
The pain belongs to me
But your love surrounds me
Surrounds me, surrounds me

I don't feel hunger, I don't need air
There's blood in my veins 'cause I know you are there
I don't need shelter, nothing at all
The reason I'm here
Don't you know that you're all of my basic needs

I may be crippled by my mind
Your silence haunts my head
And they always find me
I may be used to feeling this way
Almost forgot remembering too
Remind me, remind me, remind me

I don't feel hunger, I don't need air
There's blood in my veins 'cause I know you are there
I don't need shelter, nothing at all
The reason I'm here
Don't you know that you're all of my basic needs

I don't feel hunger, I don't need air
There's blood in my veins 'cause I know you are there
I don't need shelter, nothing at all
The reason I'm here
Don't you know that you're all of my basic needs
My basic needs
My basic needs
