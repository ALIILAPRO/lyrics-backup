		  (Dy Krazy)
Let's get it

Man, give that boy this message (let's get it), can't wait 'til foenem catch you (yeah)
Keep callin' me a rapper, I might be the one to stretch you (be the one to stretch you)
He claimin' that he gang, the only reason foenem loved him (let's get it)
I told him he a bitch, he ain't on shit, he nothin' special (what)
I just brought four strikers (strikers), foenem and them desperate (let's go)
But I just took the keys 'cause foenem arguin' over Teslas
Why you think that he gon' ride for you? He gon' do what I tell him (gang)
I don't stop at red lights anyway, it's green light when they catch you (yeah, yeah)
Grab that TEC, nah, ay (let's get it), grab that MAC, ay
Talkin' behind my back, nah, nigga (let's get it), he a rat, yeah
Tweakin' on the net, yeah, turn you to a pack, yeah
Turn up in that cat, yeah, that 40 Glock my gat, yeah (brra)
Von pass that strap, yeah
Take who chain? That's cap, yeah
That rap money in the trap, yeah
Play with me, get clapped, yeah
Pussy (bitch)

Hello
Yeah, you a bitch ass
Man, you know what the fuck it is, man
OTF gang, 300
Man, get your bitch ass outta here nigga
You know what the fuck it is with us nigga
You a ho

Yeah, so you tough, huh?
You ain't get enough, huh? Treat you like you Krump, huh? (Dope)
Oh, you think you turnt, huh? Come out cuts and dump some'
Like my cash in lump sums, niggas don't want these problems
She put coca on her gums, switches on our guns
We can't go for none, bitch, I put that on my son
Why you shoot him in his back? 'Cause that pussy tried to run
Get your hand out your pocket 'cause I know it ain't no gun

Are you turnt, huh? Are you geeked, huh?
Are you turnt, huh? Are you geeked, huh?
Are you turnt, huh? Are you geeked, huh?
Are you turnt, huh? Are you geeked, huh?
Are you turnt, huh? Are you geeked, huh?
Are you turnt, huh? Are you geeked, huh?
Are you turnt, huh? Are you geeked, huh?
Are you turnt, huh? Are you geeked, huh?
