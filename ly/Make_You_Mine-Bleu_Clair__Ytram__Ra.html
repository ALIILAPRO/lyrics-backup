		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Come closer
And bodies touching and moving in
Ain't need no closure
Oh, we both know what is going on and on

What do you want? 'Cause I can't seem to change your mind
In every single way, you tried to ask for me to stay
Just for me to go, and I can't make you mine

And I can't make you mine
And I can't make you mine
And I can't make you mine
And I can't make you mine
And I can't make you mine

(I can't make you mine)
(I can't make you mine)

On and on, what do you want?
'Cause I can't seem to change your mind
In every single way, you tried to ask for me to stay
Just for me to go, and I can't make you mine

And I can't make you mine
And I can't make you mine
And I can't make you mine
And I can't make you mine
And I can't make you mine

I can't make
Just for me to stay (I can't make)
I can't make
I can't make
