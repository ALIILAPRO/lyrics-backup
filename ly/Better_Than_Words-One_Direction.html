		  Better than words
More than a feeling
Crazy in love
Dancing on the ceiling

Every time we touch
I'm all shook up
You make me wanna
How deep is your love
God only knows, baby

Woo
I don't know how else to sum it up
'Cause words ain't good enough, ow
There's no way I can explain your love, no
I don't know how else to sum it up
'Cause words ain't good enough, ow
I can't explain your love, no
It's better than words
Better than words

Better than words
Drive ya crazy
Someone like you
Always be my baby

Best I ever had
Hips don't lie
You make me wanna
One more night
Irreplaceable (yeah), crazy (crazy)

Woo
I don't know how else to sum it up
'Cause words ain't good enough, ow
There's no way I can explain your love, no
I don't know how else to sum it up
'Cause words ain't good enough, ow
I can't explain your love, no

Everyone tries (They try)
To see what it feels like (Feels like)
But they'll never be right
'Cause it's better (better)
It's better

One more time
Better than words

Yeah

Woo
I don't know how else to sum it up (I don't know)
'Cause words ain't good enough, ow
There's no way I can explain your love, no
I don't know how else to sum it up (To sum it up)
'Cause words ain't good enough, ow (The words ain't good enough)
I can't explain your love, no

It's better than words
It's better than words
It's better than words
