		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They appear
I remember when the fire was security
Now it's killing me
A wolf can't hunt without its prey
So take me to my grave
The demons dance by the fireside
But tonight they migrate to my bedside

Burn the bed
Burn everything
It's a lie anyway

There's nowhere left to run
There's nowhere left for me to be
Without you by my side

I cry but if you take a closer look
You'll see it's a demon's eyes
There's no coming back for me
For my spirit guide is trapped inside my brain
I don't know who I am
In the name of the Father and the Holy Ghost
Close your gates, lock the doors, there is no hope

Burn the bed
Burn everything
It's a lie anyway

There's nowhere left to run
There's nowhere left for me to be
Without you by my side
How could the world take you from me
They all deserve to burn with me

What has the world come to
When a demon defiles a witch
Nobody trusts a word I say
I can't erase these memories
But I will erase humanity
Erase humanity

Burn the bed
Burn everything
It's a lie anyway

There's nowhere left to run
There's nowhere left for me to be
Without you by my side
How could the world take you from me
They all deserve to burn with me
