		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, It do not matter
Turn to a savage, pocket got fatter, she call me daddy
Smoking that gas, gone off that xanny, she on the powder
Nowadays I am on, my haters got sadder
Money got longer, speaker got louder, car got faster
Turn to a savage, pocket got fatter, she call me daddy
Smoking that gas, gone off that xanny, she on the powder
Nowadays I am on, my haters got sadder
Money got longer, speaker got louder, car got faster, yeah

Money so old, diamonds spoiled, yeah (yeah)
My lil' bitch so spoiled, yeah (yeah)
I rub her down in oil, yeah (yeah)
I got money now you know it, yeah (yeah)
Diamonds on my teeth, yeah (yeah)
Your shit look like foil, yeah (woo)
Chris Brown said these hoes ain't loyal, yeah
None of these hoes got no morals, yeah (yeah)
All my niggas G'd up, yeah (yeah)
My glasses be D'd up
Never thought it would be days I could kick my feet up (huh?)
Never though that she would need me that much if I leave her (leave her)

It do not matter
Turn to a savage, pocket got fatter, she call me daddy
Smoking that gas, gone off that xanny, she on the powder
Nowadays I am on, my haters got sadder
Money got longer, speaker got louder, car got faster
Turn to a savage, pocket got fatter, she call me daddy
Smoking that gas, gone off that xanny, she on the powder
Nowadays I am on my haters got sadder
Money got longer, speaker got louder, car got faster (yeah)
Turn to a savage, pocket got fatter, she call me daddy
Smoking that gas, gone off that xanny, she on the powder (what?)
Nowadays I am on, my haters got sadder (yeah)
Money got longer, speaker got louder, car got faster

All of this is faction, no time for acting, all this money lasting (oh)
Like go out to eat, get that blackened salmon
When I'm with my girl we're Pharrell and Vashtie (yeah, wait, huh?)
Damn, it we are not lasting (huh, what?
In that pussy you know I like it rough, then I'm just blasting
Yeah, tell that 'lil bitch that I'm really from Mars
Uh, yeah, bitch do not start
Pull up my car automatic, yeah, dealt with a star

It do not matter
Turn to a savage, pocket got fatter, she call me daddy
Smoking that gas, gone off that xanny, she on the powder
Nowadays I am on, my haters got sadder
Money got longer, speaker got louder, car got faster
Turn to a savage, pocket got fatter, she call me daddy
Smoking that gas, gone off that xanny, she on the powder
Nowadays I am on, my haters got sadder
Money got longer, speaker got louder, car got faster
