		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Pay your respects to the vultures
For they are your future
Our fathers and mothers have
They have failed to release us
Into the welcoming armsâ€¦
Of the Amethyst Deceivers

So pay your respects
To the vultures
And to the crows
And to the carrion crows
Those Craven Ravens
And to the carrion crows
And to the rooks
And to the vultures

For they are our future

Our fathers and mothers have
They have failed to release us
Into the welcoming arms
Of the amethyst

The little mushrooms
Those little mushrooms

Welcoming arms
Of the amethyst
Of the amethyst deceivers
