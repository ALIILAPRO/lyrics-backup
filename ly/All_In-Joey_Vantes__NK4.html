		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Skrrt off I been gone on 100
Lil faith walk no fear cause He on it
Stright grindin' an ever since I been ballin
Stright grindin'
I been all in
I been all in
I been all in
I been all in now we ballin
New with this pen but I aint playin' games
First step in came wit a bang
I don't need a nod I don't need the fame
Ever since God I ain't been the same
Boy I been ballin' puttin' my all in
Both feet in I been followin' my callin
Blessings been fallin' haters been stallin
I been on ten Im sprintin' yall joggin
We been runnin' it up
We ain't stoppin' at all
Still showin' the love
Had to look up above
Skrrt off I been gone on 100
Lil faith walk no fear cause He on it
Stright grindin' an ever since I been ballin
Stright grindin'
I been all in
I been all in
I been all in
I been all in now we ballin
Do do do do when I shoot
Open your drawer and give me all the loot
Been through the fire you know I'm the proof
Ha yea
I got the proof, yea
Read you like book fair I'm kinda scholastic
Currency digital gold into plastic
Get out my way or its gonna be drastic
Hop in that 458 and I smash it
Yea
Yea
These are X files like Mulder and Scully
Very next stop is the Eastside telly
Land anywhere like a miracle Sully
Boi it's Hot in hurrr like I'm channeling Nelly
Skrrt off I been gone on 100
Lil faith walk no fear cause He on it
Stright grindin' an ever since I been ballin
Stright grindin'
I been all in
I been all in
I been all in
I been all in now we ballin
