		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't play your rock 'n' roll to me
That ain't the way it's meant to be
I ain't so blind that I can't see
Just let it lie, let it be

So, don't play your rock 'n' roll, no
Don't play your rock 'n' roll, no
Don't play your rock 'n' roll to me, oh

Well I know you think I'm crazy, hangin' round
But I was sort of hopin' you'd change, from the girl I'd found
But your words just sound like rock 'n' roll lies to me
And they're just about as burned out, as a worn out forty-five
And you can't expect them to keep our love alive, oh

So, don't play your rock 'n' roll to me
That ain't the way it's meant to be
I ain't so blind that I can't see
Just let it lie, let it be

So, don't play your rock 'n' roll, no
Don't play your rock 'n' roll, no
Don't play your rock 'n' roll to me, oh

Well I guess you had me fooled, for a while
With your come-on looks, and your Mona Lisa smile
But your rock 'n' roll is getting out of time, to me
Go sing your lines to someone else, that someone else may be
The fool you always thought you saw in me, oh

So, don't play your rock 'n' roll to me
That ain't the way it's meant to be
I ain't so blind that I can't see
Just let it lie, let it be

Don't play your rock 'n' roll, no
Don't play your rock 'n' roll, no
Don't play your rock 'n' roll to me, oh
Just let it lie, let it be
Don't play your rock 'n' roll, no
Don't play your rock 'n' roll, no
Don't play your rock 'n' roll to me, oh
Just let it lie, let it be
Don't play your rock 'n' roll, no
Don't play your rock 'n' roll, no
Don't play your rock 'n' roll
