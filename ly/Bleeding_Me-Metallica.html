		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm digging my way
I'm digging my way to something
I'm digging my way to something better

I'm pushing to stay
I'm pushing to stay with something
I'm pushing to stay with something better

Whoa oh oh oh
Whoa oh

I'm sowing the seeds
I'm sowing the seeds I've taken
I'm sowing the seeds I take for granted

This thorn in my side
This thorn in my side is from the tree
This thorn in my side is from the tree I've planted
Ooh, it tears me and I bleed, yeah
And I bleed yeah, yeah, ha

Caught under wheel's roll
I take the leech, I'm bleeding me
Can't stop to save my soul
I take the leash that's leading me
I'm bleeding me, oh
Oh, I can't take it
Caught under wheel's roll
Oh, the bleeding of me
Of me, yeah
The bleeding of me

Caught under wheel's roll
I take the leech, I'm bleeding me
Can't stop to save my soul
I take the leash that's leading me
I'm bleeding me, whoa whoa
Oh, I can't take it
Caught under wheel's roll
Oh, the bleeding of me
Oh, the bleeding of me

Woo, ah
I am the beast that feeds the feast
I am the blood, I am release
Come make me pure
Bleed me a cure
I'm caught, I'm caught, I'm caught under

Caught under wheel's roll
I take the leech, I'm bleeding me
Can't stop to save my soul
I take the leash that's leading me
I'm bleeding me
Oh, I can't take it
I can't take it
I can't take it
Oh, the bleeding of me

(Come on, bleed me)

Ummm, yeah

I'm digging my way
I'm digging my way to something
I'm digging my way to something better

I'm pushing to stay
I'm pushing to stay with something
I'm pushing to stay with something better
With something better
