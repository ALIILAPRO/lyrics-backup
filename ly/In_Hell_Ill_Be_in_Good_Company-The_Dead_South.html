		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dead Love couldn't go no further
Proud of and disgusted by her
Push shove, a little bruised and battered
Oh Lord I ain't coming home with you

My life's a bit more colder
Dead wife is what I told her
Brass knife sinks into my shoulder
Oh babe don't know what I'm gonna do

I see my red head, messed bed, tear shed 
Queen bee, my squeeze
The stage it smells, tells, hell's bells
Miss-spells, knocks me on my knees
It didn't hurt, flirt, blood squirt 
Stuffed shirt, hang me on a tree
After I count down, three rounds 
In hell I'll be in good company

Dead Love couldn't go no further
Proud of and disgusted by her
Push shove, a little bruised and battered
Oh Lord I ain't coming home with you

My life's a bit more colder
Dead wife is what I told her
Brass knife sinks into my shoulder
Oh babe don't know what I'm gonna do

I see my red head, messed bed, tear shed 
Queen bee, my squeeze
The stage it smells, tells, hell's bells
Miss-spells, knocks me on my knees
It didn't hurt, flirt, blood squirt 
Stuffed shirt, hang me on a tree
After I count down, three rounds 
In hell I'll be in good company

In hell I'll be in good company

In hell I'll be in good company
