		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take me off to the seas
So I can clean this disease
Death will complete me
It is what I need

Ya! 

Take my evil, to the skies
Take my evil, all light dies

Shattering the skies above
I want to destroy all that you love
Shattering the skies above
I won't rest 'til I am drenched in blood

Take me into the seas
So I can clean, off this disease
Death will complete me
It is what I need

Take my evil, to the skies
Take my evil, all light dies

Shattering the skies above
I want to destroy all that you love
Shattering the skies above
I won't rest 'til I am drenched in blood

Take my evil, to the skies
Take my evil, all light dies

Shattering the skies above
I want to destroy all you love
I'm shattering (shattering the skies above)
Shattering the skies above
I won't rest 'til I'm drenched in blood
I'm shattering

Take my evil, to the skies
Take my evil, all light dies

Shattering the skies above
I want to destroy all that you love
Shattering the skies above
I won't rest 'til I am drenched in blood

Shattering the skies above
Shattering the skies (the skies above)
