		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Park it, lock it
Fendi in my pocket
Just tryna get my flock in
I'm cynical and honest
I'm down by the rocks
Life's a bank, try deposit
Pop wrists out the sockets
No drip I need new faucets

No tip when I get a new polish
No ship when I need a new rocket
No hit I might need a new following
New drip, it was all for the prominence

Jibbits out the Crocs, 'cause get it? I'm mature now
I sip then I floss, blame PR for the turnout
 
Please don't ever go 
Oh, I said please don't ever go 
No, no, no
Meet me on the coast
On the best side
With no palm trees
With no movies
Please don't ever go, yeah

Park it, lock it
Fendi in my pocket
Just tryna get my flock in
I'm cynical I'm honest
I'm down by the rocks
Life's a bank, try to pause it
Pop wrists out the sockets
No drip I need new faucets

No tip when I get a new polish
No ship when I need a new rocket
No hit I might need a new following
New drip, it was all for the prominence

Jibbits out the Crocs, 'cause get it? I'm mature now
I sip then I floss, blame my heart for this burnout
