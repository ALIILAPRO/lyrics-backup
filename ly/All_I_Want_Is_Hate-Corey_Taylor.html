		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's nothing you can say I want to hear
No song, no shit, no fear
Nothing in my space, get out of my face, I don't care
It's harder to be sick if you just suck
No if's and's what's or fucks
Nothing you can say, get out of my way, I don't care

All I want is hate
Destroy and consecrate
All I want is hate
Hate is all I want

There's nothing you can do I want to do
No hope, no life, no proof
Nothing really matters, nothing is real, I don't care
Something is just nothing with a plan
It's a nothing I don't really understand
Why be a pawn when you just don't fucking care?

All I want is hate
Destroy and consecrate
All I want is hate
Hate is all I want

All I want is hate
Destroy and consecrate
All I want is hate
Hate is all I want
Hate is all I want
Hate is all I want
Hate is all I want
