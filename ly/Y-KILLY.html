		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Why everybody they lookin' the same?
Why everybody tryna copy my chain?
All of these hoes want attention for free
Refurbished Rollies not impressing me
I'm never hiding, just posted my drop
Tryna get higher, I love when it drop
Caught me a liar and cut off his tongue
I can't get tired, I'm running it up
Most of my foes really move like some hoes
But the worst of it all
Is we started as friends
I love my bro, he on go
Got eleven on road 'causе he always
Keep one in the hеad
Issey Miyake I mix with the Arcy
Know she getting wet 'cause
We started a trend (What?)
If I wanna link I just text her a ping
She gon' drop everything 'cause she
Know what I meant (yeah, yeah)

Back on my bull, I'm seeing red
Merino wool, I don't get wet (yeah, yeah)
I bend the rules, lower my tax
Move like a fool, get pitched like a tent
(yeah, yeah)
Could make half a ticket if I checked my DMs
Back independent, got business expense
Bottega Veneta, spent five on a lens
Back of the 'Bach, not a regular Benz
Stay on the grind, I need something to show
Stay in the sky, I got places to go
Take all the phones at the
Back of the show 'cause
They doing the most and they dying to post
Most people I know are dying to live
I talk to God, but of course I have sinned
Knot in my pocket, there used to be lint
Gone like Team Rocket, I blast off again
Roll with a freak, I pull her hair
Don't really speak, nothing to share
Tints on the glass, you see the glare
Had to live fast 'cause life ain't fair
Down to my last, who would be there?
Down to my last, who'd have my back?
Bring racks with me everywhere
'Cause racks won't ever stab my back
(My back, my back, my back)

Why everybody they lookin' the same?
Why everybody tryna copy my chain?
All of these hoes want attention for free
Refurbished Rollies not impressing me
I'm never hiding, just posted my drop
Tryna get higher, I love when it drop
Caught me a liar and cut off his tongue
(yeah) i can't get tired, I'm running it up
(yeah, yeah)
Most of my foes really move like some hoes
But the worst of it all
Is we started as friends
I love my bro, he on go
Got eleven on road 'cause he always
Keep one in the head
Issey Miyake I mix with the Arcy
Know she getting wet 'cause
We started a trend (What?)
If I wanna link I just text her a ping
She gon' drop everything 'cause she
Know what I meant (yeah, yeah, yeah, what?)

Why everybody they lookin' the same?
Why everybody tryna copy my chain?
All of these hoes want attention for free
