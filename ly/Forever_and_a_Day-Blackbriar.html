		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You wanted forever and a day
But a day is all I could give away
You touched my heart, it is true
But it doesn't belong to you
Oh, it doesn't belong to you

My handsome poet, with golden eyes
Today I am yours, and today you are mine
But please do not ask when you'll see me again
For my heart belongs to another man
Oh, my heart belongs to another man

Such piercing eyes, as if you're mesmerized
Like I was some kind of myth
Someone you would die to be with
Such piercing eyes, mesmerized
Like I was some kind of siren

You made me smile, feel admired and free
Together with you on this deserted beach
This is how I will remember us
And I hope you will forget me not
Oh, I hope you will forget me not

Such piercing eyes, as if you're mesmerized
Like I was some kind of myth
Someone you would die to be with
Such piercing eyes, mesmerized
Like I was some kind of siren
And you would swim the wildest waters to get on my island

You wanted forever and a day
But a day is all I could give away

You wanted forever and a day
But a day is all I could give away
You wanted forever and a day
But a day is all I could give away
