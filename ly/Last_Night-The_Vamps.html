		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

I hold my hands up high
And throw my glass into the sky.
But when the morning comes,
We'll never see the sun.

And if the walls close in
Then let's just start it all again.
That's when the evening comes
Oh, yeah, the evening comes.

Whoa, oh oh oh oh oh
No we're not going home tonight
Waiting up for the stars to shine
And we'll do it, and we'll do it, and we'll do it again.

Wake up in the morning
With the sunlight in my eyes,
No, my head don't feel so bright,
What the hell happened last night?
Yeah, last night think we were dancing,
Singing all our favorite songs.
Think I might have kissed someone.
And if tomorrow never comes
We had last night.

Let's shut this party down,
And pull the building to the ground,
Yeah, girl let's live it up,
One night is all we got.

Let's dance until we die,
Nobody's going home tonight,
This kiss could be our last,
Come on and raise your glass.

Whoa, oh oh oh oh oh
No we're not going home tonight
Waiting up for the stars to shine
And we'll do it, and we'll do it, and we'll do it again.

Wake up in the morning
With the sunlight in my eyes,
No, my head don't feel so bright,
What the hell happened last night?
Yeah, last night think we were dancing,
Singing all our favorite songs.
Think I might have kissed someone.
And if tomorrow never comes
We had last night.

We do it all again
We do it all again
So bring your friends and tell a friend to bring another friend (we had last night)
We do it all again
We do it all again
By the end of tonight
We can all be friends (we had last night)
We do it all again
We do it all again
So bring your friends and tell a friend to bring another friend (we had last night)
We do it all again
We do it all again
By the end of the night

Wake up in the morning
With the sunlight in my eyes,
No, my head don't feel so bright,
What the hell happened last night?
Yeah, last night think we were dancing,
Singing all our favorite songs.
Think I might have kissed someone.
And if tomorrow never comes
We had last night.

Wake up in the morning
With the sunlight in my eyes,
No, my head don't feel so bright,
What the hell happened last night?
Yeah, last night think we were dancing,
Singing all our favorite songs.
Think I might have kissed someone.
And if tomorrow never comes
We had last night.
