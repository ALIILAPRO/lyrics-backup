		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How do I tell you I need you
When you steal the breath in my lungs?
My body shakes 'til the blood in my face
Makes me awkward smile and turn around

How do I hold these emotions
When you spin my world out of place?
One look at me it feels like everything
Is written in marker on my face

Ooh

Hoping maybe you could tell me now 
Am I the only one that's catching butterflies?
Am I a moth in your flame
Do you burn the same when I
Look in your eyes?
Do you get butterflies?
(Butterflies)

I don't know what I'd do without you
And that's why you're not here in my arms
I'm so scared to lose what we already have
Asking for everything that I want

'Cause maybe I raised all your red flags
And these green lights are just in my head
I swear that there's something we both can't explain
And I'm terrified to lose it

Ooh

Hoping maybe you could tell me now
Am I the only one that's catching butterflies? (butterflies)
Am I a moth in your flame
Do you burn the same when I

Hoping maybe you could tell me now
Am I the only one that's catching butterflies? (butterflies)
Am I a moth in your flame
Do you burn the same when I

Look in your eyes
Look in my eyes
Do you get butterflies?

(Butterflies)
