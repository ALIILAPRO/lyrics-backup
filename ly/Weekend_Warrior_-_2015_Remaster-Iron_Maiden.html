		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The rebel of yesterday, tomorrow's fool
Who are you kidding being that cool?

Trying to break away from running with the pack
But they ain't listening so you've gotta go back

You're a weekend warrior when
You're one of the crowd
But it's over
Just look at you now
Look at you now
Just look at you now
Just look at you now

You're not so brave the way you behave
It makes you sick, gotta get out quick
It's all bravado when you're out with your mates
It's like a different person goes through those gates
And the game begins
The adrenalin's high
Feel the tension 
Maybe someone will die
Someone will die
Someone will die
Maybe someone will die

A weekend warrior lately
A weekend warrior sometimes
A weekend warrior maybe 
You ain't that way anymore

A weekend warrior lately
A weekend warrior sometimes
A weekend warrior maybe 
You ain't that way anymore

You've gotta get out gotta get away
But you're in with a clique it's not easy to stray
You've gotta admit you're just living a lie
It didn't take long to work out why

It's hard to say why you got involved
Just wanting to be part
Just wanting to belong
To belong
To belong
To belong

A weekend warrior lately
A weekend warrior sometimes
A weekend warrior maybe you ain't that way anymore

A weekend warrior lately
A weekend warrior sometimes
A weekend warrior maybe you ain't that way anymore

Some of the things that you've done
You feel so ashamed
After all it's only a game Isn't it?
And after all the adrenalin's gone
What you gonna do on Monday?
What you gonna do?
What you gonna do on Monday?

A weekend warrior lately
A weekend warrior sometimes
A weekend warrior maybe you ain't that way anymore
A weekend warrior lately
A weekend warrior sometimes
A weekend warrior maybe 
You were never like that at all
