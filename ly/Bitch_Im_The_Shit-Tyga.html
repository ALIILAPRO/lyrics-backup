		  Bitch I'm the shit bitch I'm the shit
Bitch I'm the shit i ain't worried bout shit
Bitch I'm the shit bitch I'm the shit
I'm on my own shit
You don't see my outfit, bitch I'm
Ballin', ballin', ballin', ballin', ballin'
Bitch I'm the shit, see me
Ballin', ballin', ballin', ballin', ballin'
Bitch I'm the shit

Bitches all in my car
They wanna roll with a star
Got all these niggas mad, pop the trunk
Blast ya face off nigga you ain't met T-Raw
Hit the bass so hard
Got bitches takin it off
I can't fuck if she too tall
Gotta bitch that play ball
Foul the pussy, I charge
Make that ass applaud
I don't cuff her like the law
I fly bitch to Milan
She don't know what I'm on
I play the game so crazy
She thinkin' ain't shit saw
Wheel 'em in, wheel 'em in
Like Vanna White, Wheel of Fortune
While you all up up in her face
Man she thinkin' that shit torture
Win again, win again
Cause nigga I stay scorchin'
I'm the man man on fire
Kill your style like abortion

Bitch I'm the shit bitch I'm the shit
Bitch I'm the shit i ain't worried bout shit
Bitch I'm the shit bitch I'm the shit
I'm on my own shit
You don't see my outfit, bitch I'm
Ballin', ballin', ballin', ballin', ballin'
Bitch I'm the shit, see me
Ballin', ballin', ballin', ballin', ballin'
Bitch I'm the shit

Man these hoes problems
So I fuck 'em, never call'em
But I love love black woman
And they love what's in my wallet
Got gold on and it's frozen
See that Last King, move over
Talking loud like my motor
You want some scary shit like October
Take a seat, have a soda
While you starin' over your shoulder
You good man, we don't want you
And you faker than Willy Wonka
Real shit, I told you
New styles, I showed you
Got green like it's a locust
Why you on my bumper, I'm focused
Wheel 'em in, wheel 'em in
Like Vanna White, Wheel of Fortune
While you all up up in her face
Man she thinkin' that shit torture
Win again, win again
Cause nigga I stay scorchin'
I'm the man man on fire
Kill your style like abortion

Bitch I'm the shit bitch I'm the shit
Bitch I'm the shit i ain't worried bout shit
Bitch I'm the shit bitch I'm the shit
I'm on my own shit
You don't see my outfit, bitch I'm
Ballin', ballin', ballin', ballin', ballin'
Bitch I'm the shit, see me
Ballin', ballin', ballin', ballin', ballin'
Bitch I'm the shit
