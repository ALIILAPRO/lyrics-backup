		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's not Christmas, no
It's not Christmas, no
It's not Christmas
'Til somebody cries
 
(Ho, ho, ho, ho)

Everybody made it home for Christmas Eve
Tried to keep it cool around the Christmas tree
Every year we sing a little song to survive
That it's not Christmas 'til somebody cries
 
My boyfriend is a vegan, so they fed him fish
My uncle made it worse by talking politics
I had a few opinions might have started a fight
Well, it's not Christmas 'til somebody cries
 
It's not Christmas
'Til we all break down in tears
It's not Christmas
It's the best time of the year
 
Grandpa ate the gummies that we meant to hide
We tried to play it off like it's a holiday high
He unwrapped all the presents and he ruined the surprise
Well, it's not Christmas 'til somebody
 
Breaks into argument
Ooh, I used to fight it
We get emotional too
I won't deny it
I used to hide in my room but now I like it
'Cause it's not Christmas 'til somebody cries
 
It's not Christmas
'Til we all break down in tears
It's not Christmas
It's the best time of the year
 
It's not Christmas
'Til somebody cries
'Til somebody cries
 
Waking up too early in my childhood bed
The nieces and the nephews jumping on my head
They keep on asking questions like is Santa a lie
Well, it's not Christmas 'til somebody cries
 
It's not Christmas
It's not Christmas (have a holly jolly)
The secret is to sing a little song to survive
That it's not Christmas 'til somebody cries
Oh, it's not Christmas 'til somebody cries
It's not Christmas 'til somebody cries
