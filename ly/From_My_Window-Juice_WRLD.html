		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh, yeah
Ecstasy-takin', rock star steez
Ecstasy-takin', rock star steez
Yeah, I like that, uh

Ecstasy takin' rock star steez
Make a bad bitch get on her knees
Ask could she suck my dick? "Yes, please"
Put it in her throat, shorty choked then sneezed

I see the world from my window
I ain't goin' outside, see it through my window
Money from the record label, spend it all on ammo
Livin' in paranoia, got me livin' like I'm Rambo
Life is a TV show, if you try me, it'll be canceled
.223s stick you just like a IV, hospital
My wifey fuck me off of the whitey, Malcolm middle
Put it in her mouth, Juice WRLD popsicle

I'm official
I'm geeked out, ho
Molly Manson
The Devil tryna tease me, he snortin' in my mansion
Mario, Luigi, my bros to the bitter end
All I know is slatt shit and gang shit, fuck a friend
If she sendin' you ass pics, you should fuck her then
Take her to the palace just to put the Buck in Buckingham

It all started with three Xans
Switched up to the Percs, committed treason, uh
Now it's XO in my hand

I see the world from my window
I ain't goin' outside, see it through my window
Money from the record label, spend it all on ammo
Livin' in paranoia, got me livin' like I'm Rambo
Life is a TV show, if you try me, it'll be canceled
.223s stick you just like a IV, hospital
My wifey fuck me off of the whitey, Malcolm middle
Put it in her mouth, Juice WRLD popsicle

Her life's cursed
Took a wrong turn
Lesson relearned
Satan always comes back to burn
All the bridges
Impossible to give your soul away if it's not yours to give
Thankful that I know the truth, for others it's unfortunate
But I heard Hell has a lot of room, so get comfortable
Takin' drug after drug, numb the bitter truth
I'm a nice high guy, I could love the bitter you
'Member popping pills before it was cool
Getting ridiculed back in high school

I see the world from my window
I ain't goin' outside, see it through my window
Money from the record label, spend it all on ammo
Livin' in paranoia, got me livin' like I'm Rambo
Life is a TV show, if you try me, it'll be canceled
.223s stick you just like a IV, hospital
My wifey fuck me off of the whitey, Malcolm middle
Put it in her mouth, Juice WRLD popsicle
