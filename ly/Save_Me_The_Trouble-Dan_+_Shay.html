		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can tell by the way
That you're stirring your drink
Oh, we're already playing with fire
Said that you had to go
'Bout an hour ago
Baby, you're such a beautiful liar

It feels like a movie I've already seen
So right now I'm begging you please

Why don't you save me the trouble
Keep those pretty blue eyes to yourself
Why don't you save me the trouble
Give that heartache to somebody else

If you're the kinda girl that's only gonna wanna love and leave
A guy like me
Alone in this bar drinking double
Why don't you save me the trouble
Save me the trouble, baby

Now the closer I get
To the red on your lips
I can feel myself falling all crazy
'Cause just a little kiss and I could never get you out of my mind
So before you go wreck my whole life

Why don't you save me the trouble
Keep those pretty blue eyes to yourself
Why don't you save me the trouble (save me the trouble, baby)
Give that heartache to somebody else (somebody else)

If you're the kinda girl that's only gonna wanna love and leave
A guy like me
Alone in this bar drinking double
Why don't you save me the trouble
Save me the trouble, baby

Oh, oh

I know you know that I ain't strong enough
To tell girls like you no, no it ain't in my blood 

So just save me the trouble
Keep those pretty blue eyes to yourself
Why don't you save me the trouble (save me the trouble, baby)
Give that heartache to somebody else (somebody else)

'Cause you're the kinda girl that's only gonna wanna love and leave
A guy like me
Alone in this bar drinking double
Why don't you save me the trouble
Why don't you save me the trouble
Save me the trouble, baby
