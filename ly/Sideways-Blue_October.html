		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't need shit
And nothing hurts
I make money, fuck you
I bet you I can move mountains
To California
I take money, eat you up

We created a whole world 
Where we kept ignoring exactly how we felt
So don't let the music die
Don't let it bring you down, keep roaring
Say exactly how you feel 
When everything's sideways
When everything's sideways

I've never been responsible
But I don't give up
I make money, fuck you
I'm out here making idiots angry
So don't fuck this up (so don't fuck this up)
Like honey, eat you up (so don't fuck up)

We created a whole world 
Where we kept ignoring exactly how we felt
So don't let the music die
Don't let it bring you down, keep roaring
Say exactly how you feel 
When everything's sideways
When everything's sideways
When everything's sideways

We created a whole world 
Where we kept ignoring exactly how we felt
So don't let the music die
Don't let it bring you down, keep roaring
Say exactly how you feel 
When everything's sideways
