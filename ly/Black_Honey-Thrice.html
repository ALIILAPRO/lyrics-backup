		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I keep swinging my hand through a swarm of bees 'cause I
I want honey on my table
I keep swinging my hand through a swarm of bees 'cause I
I want honey on my table

But I never get it right
No, I never get it right

I keep swinging my hand through a swarm of bees
I can't understand why they're stinging me
But I'll do what I want
I'll do what I please
I'll do it again till I've got what I need

I'll rip and smash through the hornet's nest
Do you understand I deserve the best?
Till you do what I want
I'll do what I please
I'll do it again till I've got what I need

I try to stick this pin through a butterfly 'cause I
I like all the pretty colors
It just fell apart, so I flung it in the fire
To burn with all the others

'Cause I never get it right
No, I never get it right

I keep swinging my hand through a swarm of bees
I can't understand why they're stinging me
But I'll do what I want
I'll do what I please
I'll do it again till I've got what I need

I'll rip and smash through the hornet's nest
Do you understand I deserve the best?
Till you do what I want
I'll do what I please
I'll do it again till I've got what I need

This time, I'll get it right
This time, I'll get it right
It's gonna be this time, I'll get it right
God, let it be this time I get it right

So I'm cutting that branch off the cherry tree
Singing, "This will be my victory,"
Then I see them coming after me
And they're following me across the sea
And now they're stinging my friends and my family
And I don't know why this is happening
But I'll do what I want
I'll do what I please
I'll do it again till I've got what I need

I keep swinging my hand through a swarm of bees 'cause I
I want honey on my table
