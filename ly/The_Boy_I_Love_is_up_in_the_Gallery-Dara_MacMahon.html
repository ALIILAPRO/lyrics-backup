		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm a young girl, and have just come over
Over from the country where they do things big
And amongst the boys I've got me a lover
And since I've got a lover I just don't care a fig

The boy I love is up in the gallery
The boy I love is looking now at me
There he is, can't you see? Waving his handkerchief
As merry as a robin that sings on a tree

The boy that I love, they call him a cobbler
But he is not a cobbler, allow me to state
For Johnny is a tradesman and he works in the borough
Where they sole and heel them, whilst you wait

The boy I love is up in the gallery
The boy I love is looking now at me
There he is, can't you see? Waving his handkerchief
As merry as a robin that sings on a tree

Now, If I were a Duchess and had a lot of money
I'd give it to the boy that's gonna marry me
But I haven't got a penny, so we live on love and kisses
And be just as happy as the birds on a tree

The boy I love is up in the gallery
The boy I love is looking now at me
There he is, can't you see? Waving his handkerchief
As merry as a robin that sings on a tree
