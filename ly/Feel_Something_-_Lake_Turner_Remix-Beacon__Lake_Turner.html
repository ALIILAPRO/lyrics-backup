		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I’ma let your heart feel something,
I’ma let your heart feel doubt,
Gunna let you hide it from me,
While I’m in your life for now.

I could see you’re firing for me,
I was in your firing line,
I could hear you calling to me,
Get get out.

I’m let your heart feel something,
I’ma let your heart feel doubt,
Gunna start the fire in me,
Gunna let you put it out.

And I know you’re starving for me,
I could see your knives are sharp,
And a voice is calling to me,
Get get out.

Hold it for a second take,
I’ll find another role to play,
And see you again.
