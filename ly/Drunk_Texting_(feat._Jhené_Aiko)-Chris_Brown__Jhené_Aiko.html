		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Said I'm all up in my feelings
Doubled up on this shot
Got me feeling some type of way, told you I hate you, I don't mean it
And the only thing that I got
Is the pain that you've been feeding
Faded, faded, faded, all because of you
Now my current situation
Trying not to think of you, not to break the rules
Why's it always happen, when I get this way?
Just can't stop myself, so baby tonight

I'm blowing up your line
I got you on my mind
And the truth is hard to find, so I'll be
I'll be drunk texting, drunk texting, drunk texting you
Drunk texting, drunk texting you
Yeah, baby, I'll be drunk texting, drunk texting, drunk texting you
Drunk texting, drunk texting you

Drunk texting you
(Drunk texting you)
Drunk texting you
(Drunk texting you)

I'm looking at my phone thinking
Am I gonna hit send or nah?
It's gonna be one of them mornings when I wake up and regret it
The phone get no reply
I don't wanna make it obvious that I'm faded, faded, faded
Off a drink or two
And you know how it goes, this ain't nothing new
Why's it always happen, when I get this way?
No I just can't stop myself
So baby tonight

I'm blowing up your line (oh yeah)
I got you on my mind
And the truth is hard to find, so I'll be (I'll be)
I'll be drunk texting, drunk texting, drunk texting you
Drunk texting, drunk texting you
Yeah, baby, I'll be drunk texting, drunk texting, drunk texting you (girl, I'm drunk texting)
Drunk texting, drunk texting you

Intoxicated (intoxicated)
That's when I think of you the most
But after the tides, anything goes
When I put my pride aside
(I'll be doing the most)
Doing the most

I done spent 1, 2, 3 AM, thinkin' about you
Don't wanna be without you
'Cause I'm on the liquid courage
I hope this shit is worth it
'Cause if it ain't then it's all bad, all bad
So baby, tonight

I'm blowing up your line (I'm blowing up your phone)
I got you on my mind
And the truth is hard to find (yeah), so I'll be (I'll be)
I'll be drunk texting, drunk texting, drunk texting you
Drunk texting, drunk texting you
Yeah, baby I'll be drunk texting, drunk texting, drunk texting you ('cause I'm fucked up right now)
Drunk texting, drunk texting you

If by chance you're laying next to someone else right now (girl, I)
I-I hope it's the worst sex ever (yeah, yeah)
Hope it's the worst sex ever
