		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I look to the sky
the sun has faded away
the moonlight shines on me
the gods play their symphonies
I feel so lost I fall on my knees
I think about times and yesterday

All it does just to me
I cant\'t find the right words to say
I don\'t know how to find the way

...Here...here I am...life is bright...
...There\'s no sorrow...nothing can stop us...
...Showed us hope....and took my forest...
...Saw my perfect...in my hand...some death...
...Some cheer...that\'s real pain...
...Remoun you...I don\'t understand...
...I\'ve...I\'ve lost my hope...
...My...my will to live...
...Live so well...forever...all alone...
In my eyes you see no pride
In my eyes you see no light
In my eyes you see your tear
In my eyes you see my fear
In my eyes you see my love
In my eyes you see no glow
In my eyes you see my hate
In my eyes you see my fate

Forever all alone
