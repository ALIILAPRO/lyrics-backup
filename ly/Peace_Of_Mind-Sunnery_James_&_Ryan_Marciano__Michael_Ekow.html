		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Is it your vibe that’s calling
Tension high and you know I’m all in
Make me lose all my senses
Glance in your eyes got me so tempted

Three day get away a breather
Why don’t you come through to ibiza
Or anywhere where there’s sunshine
I got the vibe can make you unwine

I got the vibe can make you unwine
I got the vibe can make you unwine
I got the vibe can make you unwine
I got the vibe can make you unwine
I got the vibe can make you unwine
I got the vibe can make you unwine
I got the vibe can make you unwine

I got the vibe can make you unwine

Unwine
Make you

I can be
I can be

I can be your peace of

I can be
I can be

I can be your peace of

I can be
I can be

I got the vibe can make you unwine
I got the vibe can make you unwine
I got the vibe can make you unwine
I got the vibe can make you unwine

I can be
I can be your peace of mind

Give me your love and your time
I can be
I can be your peace of mind

Give me your love and your time
I can be
I can be your peace of mind

Give me your love and your time
I can be
I can be your peace of mind

Give me your love and your time
I can be
I can be your peace of mind

Give me your love and your time
I can be
I can be your peace of mind

I got the vibe can make you unwine

Unwine
Make you

I can be
I can be

I can be your peace of

I can be
I can be

I can be your peace of

I can be
I can be

Give me your love and your time
I can be
I can be your peace of mind

Give me your love and your time
I can be
I can be your peace of mind

Give me your love and your time
I can be
I can be your peace of mind

Give me your love and your time
I can be
I can be your peace of mind
