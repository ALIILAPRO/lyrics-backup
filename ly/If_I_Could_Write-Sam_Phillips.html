		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I could write I'd set all the words free 
to follow you
Tell you wonder, tell you secrets and solitude
I've had to let go of so much
It's hard to hold on now
Something far off is pulling me and
When I go this time I don't think I'm coming back

I took your ring that never comes aff and put it on
Sorry to lose you, sorry to keep you after you were gone
Nothing is small, nothing is unexpected
I want more
When I go this time I don't think I'm coming back

Desire's the element that I can't fight
Dream is the arm of God
Girl's looking for themselves in your eyes
I'm looking for you
What's this supposed to be some kind of perfect
I want more
When I go this time I don't think I'm coming back

Coming back
Coming back
Coming back
