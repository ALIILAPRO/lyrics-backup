		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (I should be your girl)
(Your girl, your girl)

See, I used to be so shy
Sit at home and fantasize (I should be your girl)
But I ain't wastin' no more time
'Cause I've got to make you mine

I'm gonna make you want to
Get with me tonight
I'm gonna put those naughty
Thoughts into your mind
I'm gonna show you clearly, I can rock your world
You're gonna know for sure
That I should be your girl

(Your girl, your girl)
See, I used to be afraid
But now baby, I can't wait (I should be your girl)
I just got to have your love
And enough's enough's enough

I'm gonna make you want to
Get with me tonight
I'm gonna put those naughty
Thoughts into your mind
I'm gonna show you clearly, I can rock your world
You're gonna know for sure
That I should be your girl
Baby, I should be your girl

(Your girl, your girl)
(I should be your girl)
(Your girl, your girl)
Baby
(Your girl, your girl)
I'm gonna be your girl (I should be your girl)

I'm gonna make you want to
Get with me tonight
I'm gonna put those naughty
Thoughts into your mind
I'm gonna show you clearly, I can rock your world
You're gonna know for sure
That I should be your girl
