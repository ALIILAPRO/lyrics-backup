		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The phone rings in the middle of the night
My father yells, "What you gonna do with your life?"
Oh, daddy dear, you know you're still number one
But girls, they wanna have fun

I could tell he the one 'cause they hatin' on him
Used to be a high roller, but I skated on him
When he went away, then I just waited on him
Came back, then I got X-rated on him
Never, never hesitated on him
Even though I had to go up, elevated on him
Had the trap house, but it got raided on him
But I kept a real player, never traded on him, uh
I mean, I wouldn't call them mini-me's
More like some goofy, dizzy, raggedy-ass enemies, I mean
One thing for sure, it ain't forgettin' me
Me and my girls been them hoes, whole squad them, uh
When the sun hit his eyes, I wanna star-star, tw-twinkle at night
Guys, I just can't say bye
Suddenly speak Thai, man, he samurai fly

Phone rings in the middle of the night
My father yells, "What you gonna do with your life?"
Oh, daddy dear, you know you're still number one
But girls, they wanna have fun
Oh, girls just wanna have-

I'm lookin' for (I'm lookin' for), I'm lookin' for my baby (I'm lookin' for)
I'm lookin' for (I'm lookin' for), I'm lookin' for my baby (I'm lookin' for)

Look-lookin' for my lip gloss and my liner (liner)
Lookin' for me, told him meet me at the diner (diner)
Got him smilin' 'cause he know I outshine her (shine her)
Had to-had to pop up just to remind her
Easy lil' ho, don't know my M.O
If I want your nigga, then just let him go
Can't sit in my seat, can't sit in my row
He been said I'm yes, he been said you no
He got a fetish for some pretty feet
He got that super bass, make my heart skip a beat, I mean
Red cups like double D's
Chanel bags everywhere, that's double C's
Uh, you rich bitch, buyin' your dreams
You know we gettin' to the bag, keepin' it a bean
(They said-) They said what? Oh, yeah, I seen
We doin' great, Alexander, word to McQueen

Phone rings in the middle of the night
My father yells, "What you gonna do with your life?"
Oh, daddy dear, you know you're still number one
But girls, they wanna have fun
Oh, girls just wanna have-

Just wanna, just wanna, just wanna have fun (have fun)
Just wanna, just wanna, just wanna have fun (have fun)
Just wanna have, just wanna have, just wanna have fun (wanna have fun)
Just wanna have, just wanna have, just wanna have fun (wanna have fun)
Just wanna have, just wanna have, just wanna have fun (wanna have fun)
Just wanna have, just wanna have, just wanna have fun (wanna have fun)

Just wanna, just wanna, just wanna have fun (have fun)
Just wanna, just wanna, just wanna have fun (have fun)
