		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I learnt to let go when I was younger
Scared of growing old
I would swim far into the ocean
And try to stay afloat
Until my lungs would cough up water
And sand would coat my bones, and I hope now
That someday I'll open up the flood gates
And let the lyrics flow
Someday I'll understand the dry taste
When the words are trapped below
Some days I wonder if my airway
Is clogged with all the quotes, that I wrote, now
 
I feel worthless
Maybe I should open the drawer
Burn the pages
Write poems with the ash on the floor
Pour the ink, into the sink
And watch it drain from the shore

I don't want love no more
Though it's the one thing I've been searching for
Though it's the one thing that I miss the most
Now I'm afraid to be alone

I learnt to grow old when I was younger
Scared of staying young
Afraid of the thoughts that I had conjured
That sat atop my tongue
Knowing I'd change the worlds opinion
If they would just, listen up
But they won't, now

I feel worthless
Maybe I should open the drawer
Burn the pages
Write poems with the ash on the floor
Pour the ink, into the sink
And watch it drain from the shore

I don't want love no more
Though it's the one thing I've been searching for
Though it's the one thing that I miss the most
Now, I'm afraid to be alone (I'm afraid to be alone)
To Be Alone

Looking in the mirror like
Maybe I will find myself tonight
I ask for a better mind
Then tap into the site through my third eye
I had never realized
I thought I had a chosen my design
I thought I was broken all this time

I don't want love no more
Though it's the one thing I've been searching for
Though it's the one thing that I miss the most
Now, I'm afraid to be alone
