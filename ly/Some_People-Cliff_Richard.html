		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Some people they tease one another
Take pride in themselves
Keeping the other one down
Well I'm not like that at all

Some people they hurt one another
They love to see
Hurt in the other one's eyes
Well I'm not like that at all

Some people are born for each other
They love to walk
Holding the other one's hand
They always understand
Some people cry
Some people know why

Oh ah ah
Some people they use one another
So aimlessly
Not like lovers do
Well I'm not like that at all

Some people they long for each other
They love to walk
Holding the other one's hand
They always understand
Some people cry
Some people know why

With a word unspoken
With a voice unheard
When a thought is broken
By a tender word
When a heart is moved
When a heart is thrown
The silence tells you
You're not alone

Some people are born for each other

(some people are born for each other)
They love to walk holding the other one
(some people they long for each other)
They love to talk holding the other one
(some people are born for each other)
They love to walk holding the other one
Holding the other one
Holding each other
