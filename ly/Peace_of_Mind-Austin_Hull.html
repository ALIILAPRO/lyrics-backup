		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I’m so tired, I’m so stressed out
I’m not motivated
All this money and attention 
Feels so overrated
Every day it’s like I wake up
Just to make a couple dollars
Sign some papers make some records
Talk with strangers, ooh

All that glitters isn’t gold
I’m losing control
Nothing is making me whole
All the drama and the stress
My life is a mess
The pressure is crushing my chest
I’m exhausted and I don’t know what to say 
Cause I’ve got everything I ever fucking wanted 
But I pray to find some peace of mind

Peace of mind
Man I gotta find some peace of mind
Peace of mind
I just gotta find some peace of mind
Some peace of mind
And I hope I find some peace of mind
Some peace of mind

I wake up, hit repeat
Same old shit like every week
Got too many people sending messages to go to sleep
I’m too deep, stretched too thin
All my walls are caving in
But I swear to god I’m okay
Least I really hope I am
Did I lose touch with reality
From chasing shit that doesn’t mean a goddamn thing?
(Mean a goddamn thing)
Trade my happiness for salary
And now I’m hanging on just by a god damn string
(By a goddamn string)

All that glitters isn’t gold
I’m losing control
Nothing is making me whole
All the drama and the stress
My life is a mess
The pressure is crushing my chest
I’m exhausted and I don’t know what to say 
Cause I’ve got everything I ever fucking wanted 
But I pray to find some peace of mind

Peace of mind
Man I gotta find some peace of mind
Peace of mind
I just gotta find some peace of mind
Some peace of mind
And I hope I find some peace of mind
Some peace of mind

Think I’m losing time
I’m losing sight
Got too caught up living in the grind
And I was blind
Put my family and friends aside 
And it ain’t right
But I hope I find some peace of mind
Some peace of mind

All that glitters isn’t gold
I’m losing control
Nothing is making me whole
All the drama and the stress
My life is a mess
The pressure is crushing my chest
I’m exhausted and I don’t know what to say 
Cause I’ve got everything I ever fucking wanted 
But I pray to find some peace of mind

Peace of mind
Man I gotta find some peace of mind
Peace of mind
I just gotta find some peace of mind
Some peace of mind
And I hope I find some peace of mind
Some peace of mind


Think I’m losing time
I’m losing sight
Got too caught up living in the grind
And I was blind
Put my family and friends aside 
And it ain’t right
But I hope I find some peace of mind
Some peace of mind
