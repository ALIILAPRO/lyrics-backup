		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (C Gutta)

I took you out them projects, we damn near lived on a jet
Bust you down when I met you, hope you never forget
I held you down and made sure you always look like a check
That way them hatin' hoes know you my bitch, real shit
Friends with benefits, girl, I hope you feelin' this
Every since I fucked another bitch, you don't take me serious
Don't I make you sleep in peace the way I be killin' it?
We caught feelings and our flight the same night, but I came twice
Diamond chain, Eliantte, she don't do no plain Jane
I'm insane, let's make a tape like Kim K and Ray J
Patek on your wrist too, upgrade all your whips, you
Bad, you don't need me for shit, baby, you be lit too

Loyal to my gang, it's on my ring and my chain
Only runnin' to the bank, I ain't chasin' no fame
Know it's money over bitches, but I'm stuck in my ways
I been with a lot of bitches, they don't love me the same
Look, I don't wanna be the person you blame
Only time I talk to tellers when I walk in the bank
Know it's money over bitches, but I'm stuck in my ways
I been with a lot of bitches, they don't love me the same

Don't complain or feel embarrassed when I call you, "My bitch"
I used to get way out of character, but you're so bad
I shouldn't be mad if niggas stare at ya
I can't find nobody to compare to ya
Me and you together, no stylist, it ain't fair at all
I'm fly as a bitch
I put my heart on my sleeve, now it's part of my fit
Part of my wrist, and bitch, got to Hell if you change on me
And I don't wanna be the person you bring, oh, no

Loyal to my gang, it's on my ring and my chain
Only runnin' to the bank, I ain't chasin' no fame
Know it's money over bitches, but I'm stuck in my ways
I been with a lot of bitches, they don't love me the same
Look, I don't wanna be the person you blame
Only time I talk to tellers when I walk in the bank
Know it's money over bitches, but I'm stuck in my ways
I been with a lot of bitches, they don't love me the same
Look

Loyal to my gang, it's on my ring and my chain
Only runnin' to the bank, I ain't chasin' no fame
Know it's money over bitches, but I'm stuck in my ways
I been with a lot of bitches, they don't love me the same, look
