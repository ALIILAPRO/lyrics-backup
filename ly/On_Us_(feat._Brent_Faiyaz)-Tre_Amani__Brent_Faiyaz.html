		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You don't want him 'cause you only fall in love with ballers
Gon' be danger, that's the only thing about us
Drive you crazy 'cause that paper always on us
Keep it on me
You don't want him 'cause you only fall in love with ballers
Gon' be danger, that's the only thing about us
Drive you crazy 'cause that paper always on us

Uh
Say you don't love me, you just lyin', see, I can read your mind
It's full of dollar sign deposits and Pradas in your closets
Conversations leave me blind, you turn me off like faucets
Like you better when I'm high, but that is not important
Bitch, we do this shit to masses, copped Amani's mom a mansion
Take vacations to Aspen, we relax to Tracy Chapman
Back home, it's fuckin' tragic, man, them streets is wreaking havoc
Kids eatin' 'cause they trappin', now they carry automatics
Homicides, multiply them bullets, bully mathematics
Got to come to my side, so you can fully understand it
But, fuck it, I'm romantic, rose petals on your mattress
Runways in Manhattan, we discuss the hottest fashion, on me

You don't want him 'cause you only fall in love with ballers
Gon' be danger, that's the only thing about us
Drive you crazy 'cause that paper always on us
Keep it on me
You don't want him 'cause you only fall in love with ballers
Gon' be danger, that's the only thing about us
Drive you crazy 'cause that paper always on us

See, mama taught me never talk to strangers
Especially ones that's hot and fun because you young and famous
So much money on my mind, I don't got time for waitin'
So sit your pretty ass down and have some conversations
Might just bulletproof the ride, these fuck niggas hatin'
Too much shit up on my mind, I need some isolation
I'ma fall way back until they call formation
Most these bitches only want you when you fuckin' make it
I done made it from the mud, I ain't have nothin', baby
And I ain't tryna risk it all, you must be fuckin' crazy
I wanna see you take it off, I wanna see you naked
Except them draws, keep 'em on and get that booty shakin'
I swear that shit amazing, crazy

You don't want him 'cause you only fall in love with ballers
Gon' be danger, that's the only thing about us
Drive you crazy 'cause that paper always on us
Keep it on me
You don't want him 'cause you only fall in love with ballers
Gon' be danger, that's the only thing about us
Drive you crazy 'cause that paper always on us (on us)
