		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Anxiety
Keep on tryin' me
Feel it quietly
Tryna silence me, yeah
Anxiety
Shake it off of me
Somebody's watchin' me (Great John on the beat, by the way)
It's my anxiety (grr)

Look, shit got me trippin'
Fightin' with my demons and my demons is winnin'
I feel like, don't nobody ever feel how I feel
And I ain't never sober, baby girl, I get high still
She said, "Boy, don't sip lean and pop pills"
It's fifty degrees and I can tell that you hot still
But I don't know what you on
Feels so right to do wrong
Can't buy love, it don't come with a coupon
And they'll never catch it like a nigga with no arms, uh
Baby, I'm trippin', my feelings been fryin' me, uh
I blame it all on anxiety
I had two chops with the sticks like I'm Chinese
Gotta keep it, I know how this life be (yeah, anxiety)
They showin' real love? That's unlikely
Fuck you, I ain't ask you to like me
Watch for that snake, he might bite me, uh
Watch out for anybody movin' spicy
Do what you do but just do it precisely, huh
They gotta talk to you nicely
Check on your head but it's nothin' like Nike
I just hope you ain't takin' it lightly (takin' it lightly)

Anxiety
Keep on tryin' me
Feel it quietly
Tryna silence me, yeah
Anxiety
Shake it off of me
Somebody's watchin' me
It's my anxiety (grr)

Feel like I'm stuck in a maze
I just try not to feel too amaze
Stand where I live 'til I lay in a grave
Sleepin' on me, been up for some days
Like, how you gon' shit where you lay, huh?
You keep the fame, I just wanna get paid
Jacques Cousteau with the wave, uh
Free all my niggas, the Harriet way
Like sometimes I feel like a slave to my feelings
I can't really even tell you how I'm feelin'
Bugged out, they gon' say I'm trippin' when I'm chillin'
Wonder who gon' hold it down until it's finished
This for the record, no Guinness, uh
You must be drunk if you think I won't drill 'em (yeah, anxiety)
Prayin' but they know you sinnin', uh
You gotta lose a lot before the winnin'
And most of the time, I be stuck in my mind
Made mistakes, ain't no way to rewind
But fuck it, we get over shit over time
It's all love 'til you get out of line
Like you knew one day you would shine, uh
You knew one day you would read through the lines
If they fuckin' with you, it's fine, uh
You just make sure you get back like a spine, uh

Anxiety
Keep on tryin' me
Feel it quietly
Tryna silence me, yeah
Anxiety
Shake it off of me
Somebody's watchin' me
It's my anxiety (grr)

Somebody's watchin' me
It's my anxiety (grr)
