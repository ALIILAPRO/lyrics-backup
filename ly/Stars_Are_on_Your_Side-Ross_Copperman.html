		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Somewhere past tomorrow
It's better than it seems
The life you live in dreams
If you're ever broken
There's always an open door
A beacon to the shore
Sometimes it takes dark yeah to feel a little light
Sometimes you need fire to see you through the other side
So get up off your knees
Hope is still alive
That place your searching for I know you'll find
Cause the stars are on your side
If you're holding breath
You're tired and your frail
Just exhale
Know you're bound for glory
That all is never lost
No matter the cost
Sometimes it takes dark yeah to feel a little light
Sometimes you need fire to see you through the other side
So get up off your knees
Hope is still alive
That place your searching for I know you'll find
Cause the stars are on your side
Sometimes it takes dark yeah to feel a little light
Sometimes you need fire to see the other side
So get up off your knees
Hope is still alive
That place your searching for I know you'll find
Cause the stars are on your side
