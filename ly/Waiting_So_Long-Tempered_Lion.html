		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Looking back and morning comes
Don't find your face in your glass
Take the moonlight by the tail
It's a rainy sight you're shading
What is that it's just the same
What is trying in your crown
I'm spending in my glass, walking back
So wear my glass you're fading
I'm waiting so long...
I'm waiting so long...
I'm waiting so long...
I'm waiting...
Blowing up the storm's around
Don't turn your face to your back
In a silence have a better dream
Sing into the wind you're shading
The rainy winds will wash away
All what your want in your crown
There is an end but it's endless
Though anywise we're fading
I'm waiting so long...
I'm waiting so long...
I'm waiting so long...
I'm waiting...
What is that it's just the same
What is trying in your crown
I'm spending in my glass walking back
So wear my glass you're fading
I'm waiting so long...
I'm waiting so long...
I'm waiting so long...
I'm waiting so long...
I'm waiting so long...
I'm waiting so long...
I'm waiting so long...
I'm waiting...
