		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't keep breathing, whoa-oh-oh
My world is sinking
You're leaving me out to dry

Do you ever feel alone?
Like the sky could come crashing down anytime now
Like a tight grip on your throat
You're lost and wandering
Flying' on broken wings

Feel your words like ice in my head
I can't rest, it's silence I dread
Feelings crushing burning my chest
Think it's enough, it's enough I've bled

I can't keep breathing, whoa-oh-oh
My world is sinking
You're leaving me out to dry
'Cause I don't wanna go back, go back
I don't wanna know that, know that
I can't keep breathing
Find me where the angels cry

This is a trauma in the making
And not even God can save me
Hide my bodies in the basement
And now all my demons chase, chase, chase, chase me

Feel your words like ice in my head (ice in my hand)
I can't rest, it's silence I dread
Feelings crushing burning my chest
Think it's enough, it's enough I've bled

I can't keep breathing, whoa-oh-oh
My world is sinking
You're leaving me out to dry
'Cause I don't wanna go back, go back
I don't wanna know that, know that
I can't keep breathing
Find me where the angels cry

And I feel so disconnected
From the ones who that said they cared the most
You don't need to pretend anymore
Watch me bleed on the pavement
Let me die, don't you save me
And my sky was the ceiling
And it broke, and it broke, don't you see it

I can't keep breathing, whoa-oh-oh
My world is sinking
(Find me where the angels cry)

I can't keep breathing, whoa-oh-oh
My world is sinking
You're leaving me out to dry
'Cause I don't wanna go back, go back
I don't wanna know that, know that
I can't keep breathing
Find me where the angels cry (find the angels)
