		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've seen a lot of heart break
Cried a lot of tears
I've turned a lot of lovers into enemies through the years, mm

I've spent a lot of time dodging exes in bars
Spent a lot of lonely nights trying to stitch my scars
It hits me hard

But here you are holding me so well
And here I am still asking myself

Are you the one
Or are you the one that could have been?
Is this the real thing
Or is it just safer to pretend?
Don't know if my heart can
Take another ugly end
It eats me up
It keeps me up
In my bed
Do I really love you?
Or am I afraid to say goodbye, again

'Cause its another six months getting out of that hell
What about the day that I see you with someone else? Mm-hmm
And part of me is sad
And part of me is guilty
Believe me when I say that killing you, kills me
Oh, it kills me

Are you the one
Or are you the one that could have been?
Is this the real thing
Or is it just safer to pretend?
Don't know if my heart can
Take another ugly end
It eats me up
It keeps me up
In my bed
Do I really love you?
Or am I afraid to say goodbye, again

Goodbye
