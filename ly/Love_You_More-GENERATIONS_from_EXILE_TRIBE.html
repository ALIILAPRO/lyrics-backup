		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah baby
I wanna tell you now ...
Baby I love you more
It's better when we are together
From the day we met
you are my treasure
It's hard to hang up
'cause I dig your phone call
(phone call)
You can count on me
I'm so into you
I won't let you down
my heart belongs to you
till the end of time ...
Telling all my friends
she's not like others
I've found my one, my only lover
Nothing can stop me now yeah
I'm crazy crazy crazy crazy
for you
Come close to me
and close your eyes
Don't fly away
girl hold me tight
I need you in my world
You're my everything
Wanna see your smile everyday
All my nights and all my days
Every minute every hour baby
I love you more
Catch a little kiss from the sky
Just wanna have you by my side
We will never ever
be apart I'm sure
And I will(And I will),
and you will(and you will)
write perfect love story
When you talk to me
the whole world stops and I...
Baby I really love you more

(Baby I love you more)
Waiting for love like
this forever
Sharing the moment
makes me wonder
Do I deserve this flower
oh my sweet girl(sweet girl)
But everytime I hold your hand
I got a feeling that
this burning will not end
'cause I feel something real ...
The rain is gonna wash away
your blue
Let's turn the page
let's make it through
Don't you know
I'll be true to you
I'm crazy crazy crazy crazy
for you
Come close to me
and close your eyes
Don't walk away girl
hold me tight
I need you in my world
You're my everything
You're the girl
I've been lookin' for
You're my hope and you're my all
Every minute every hour baby
I love you more
I'll be happy just to
call your name
I hope that you feel the same
We will never ever be apart
I'm sure
And I will(And I will),
and you will(and you will)
write a perfect love story
When you talk to me
the whole world stops and I...
Baby I really love you more
Every moment I spend with you
I feel the love grow deep inside
Beautiful gift,
it's just for youï¼†I
Suddenly you light up my life
I can see heaven in your eyes
Won't you stay here
forever my love
You're my everything
Wanna see your smile everyday
All my nights and all my days
Every minute every hour baby
I love you more
Catch a little kiss from the sky
Just have you by my side
We will never ever be apart
I'm sure (I love more)
You're the girl
I've been lookin' for
You're my hope and you're my all
Every minute every hour baby
I love you more
I'll be happy just to
call your name
I hope that you feel the same
We will never ever be apart
I'm sure
And I will(And I will),
and you will(and you will)
write a perfect love story
When you talk to me
the whole world stops and I...
Baby I really love you more

I love you from my heart
