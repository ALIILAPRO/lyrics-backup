		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Good morning, girl
Excuse me if I'm calling early
Got something on my mind
That I couldn't wait to tell you
It's not easy to say
So, may I ask you to play
Along with this small guessing game?

If it's a magazine
We are heading straight to gossip
If it's a hit parade
Girl, you know you're goin' to top it
And if the world of finance
Had a stock called romance
You'll soon be a billionaire

And I've been wanting to say it for a while
But each time I try
The words come out wrong
So, I guess the best way to tell you
Is calling you now
To play you this song
'Cause if my life is a tune
Then the chorus is you
And you got the right notes to make my heart go boom
And the lyrics
Are always saying

Oh, what a day
Can you hear the sound of knocking?
I'm standing at your door now
With some extra riddle-dropping
I guess if you are a book
Jane Austen is where I'd look
If you were a movie
To Dirty Dancing I'd be grooving

I've been wanting to say it for a while
But each time I try
The words come out wrong
So, I guess the best way to tell you
Is come to your door
To play you this song
'Cause if my life is a tune
Then the chorus is you
And you got the right notes to make my heart go boom
And the lyrics
Are always saying
I love you
I, I love you
I, I love you
I love you
