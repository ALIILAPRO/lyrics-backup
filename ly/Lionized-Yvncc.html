		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  See how dem fellas lionizing me
Jus bcuz dey had seen me
Werk it back sizeably

But ian one to steer speakinnem novelly

Dey heard dat Bobo only Comin out halloween
Bitch breakin my pelvis jump dere All on me
Act like deyn do da most dey like Im LowKey
Dis Bitch don't know how to give an apology

Boys is NOT cryptic, fellas not sinister
Dub 12 back dere onna wheel, bop Finisher

I stay putting chains on myself
N ionkno wut for
Kuz switch lane for bout nada but dey tryn go

What was I thinkin? cuz was fine at 99
Iain Botha explaining why we
Talking all the time
Hoo I could just make it off
My voice n den have children
Posed n Klamped n Hugged
Up inna damn building

Ok we go half but is you talkna dem?
Yeen gon make me look stupid
I'd rather have lupus

Yea was jus inflating my ego
Because I Ain venti
Sweep alladat under da rug car full henny

You only actin Lovey dovey cuz
You had too many i don’t wake up n go "hmm
I love being friendly"
Lizard brain, I jus wan Be Big Brute Lenny
I see muFuqqas Fake 4Ren inney damn Fendi

Ju think ju crasy?
Stab me w a mechanical pencil
More mad den lazy?
Now you not even a speckle

Do you wanna Hate me ok dat nun special
Time for damn wakey
Ian gon let dat ho embezzle

Now you got da goods
Best keep It nobody business
Bobo inexperienced, but dat my experience
Match a disorder feel like hoarder
Say dat im da only one
Who understand? Whoa der
