		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm tickled pink that things aren't going my way
Cuz that would be boring
Spent my last cent on cheese and champagne
What a wonderful morning!
Never mind she declined to the first date
It was only on my birthday
Never mind all the lines on the highway
Gimme time to reflect a bit cuz

I'm just having a good day
Having a good day
Having a real good morning
I'm just having a good day
Having a good day
Having a real good morning

I guess that things can only get better from here
But sometimes I wonder
I might have met the love of my life
But I lost her number
Never mind she declined to the first date
I went to Vegas with her room mate
Never mind all the lines on the highway
I aim to misbehave cuz
