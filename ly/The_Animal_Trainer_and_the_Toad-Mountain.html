		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  For many a year, I was so confused,
(An') Didn't know what to play.
But then I met a man, who picked up his horn,
An' showed us just what, to say.

He was skinny an' lean, an' he kept his nose clean,
An' he knew, how to write, them tunes,
Then came a day, we started to play, 
An' then we con-quered the moon.

I'm in a band.... a rock an' roll band.... 
I'm in a band, yeah, yeah.

We called him Beethoven, an' then we showed 'im, 
Exactly where we wanted to go,
So we started a band, and toured all the land,
A-rackin' in all, that dough.

We smoked a few cigs, an' played a few gigs,
An' never did delayed a one,
We covered the states, an' (we) hit the great lakes,
An' boy did we have us, some fun.

I'm in a band.... a rock an' roll band.... 
I'm in a band, yeah, yeah.

--- Honky-Tonkish Piano ---

I'm in a band.... a rock an' roll band....
I'm in a band, yeah, yeah.

We had an idea, so we put in in gear,
An' soon we were out on the road.
We did it to play, they started to say,
The animal trainer and the toad.

I'm in a band.... a rock an' roll band....
I'm in a band, yeah, yeah.
