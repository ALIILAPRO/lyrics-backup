		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Are we having fun yet? 
Tell me, are we done yet?
Tired of being cautious, cuttin' on my losses
You make me nauseous, yeah
Am I a regret yet? 
I thought you were my best bet
Was it worth what it costed? I am exhausted
You make me nauseous, yeah

You're overrated
Nothing else left to say
You got me feeling jaded
(Ah, ah, ah)

Na-na-na, not another breakup
When I think of you, I just wanna throw up
Na-na-na, no, I don't wanna get up
Lying in my bed, thinking love sucks
Na-na-na, not another breakup
When I think of you, gotta try to be tough
Na-na-na, now I'm all fucked up
Call it bad luck, why does love suck?

Do you think I'm stupid? 
I keep killing Cupid
Shot an arrow in my exes, this is my confession
Never learned my lesson, no
Your mouth is full of gossip
I'm offended that you're toxic (ew)
Your love is like a weapon, what is the obsession?
Time to learn my lesson (woah)

You're overrated
Nothing else left to say
You got me feeling jaded
(Ah, ah, ah)

Na-na-na, not another breakup
When I think of you, I just wanna throw up
Na-na-na, no, I don't wanna get up
Lying in my bed, thinking love sucks
Na-na-na, not another breakup
When I think of you, gotta try to be tough
Na-na-na, now I'm all fucked up
Call it bad luck, why does love suck?

Let's play a game of tic-tac-toe
I'ma go and make all my exes say, "Oh"
This is for the time that we dodged a bullet
I'm better off and, yeah, I know it
Let's play a game of tic-tac-toe
I'ma go and make all my exes say, "Oh"
This is for the time that we dodged a bullet
I'm better off and, yeah, I know it

Na-na-na, not another breakup
When I think of you, I just wanna throw up
Na-na-na, no, I don't wanna get up
Lying in my bed, thinking love sucks
Na-na-na, not another breakup
When I think of you, gotta try to be tough
Na-na-na, now I'm all fucked up
Call it bad luck, why does love suck?

Do you think I'm stupid? 
I keep killing Cupid (why does love suck?)
Na-na-na, now I'm all fucked up
Call it bad luck, why does love suck?
