		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh, yeah, uh, grease is the word.
I solve my problems and I see the light
We got a loving thing, we gotta feed it right
There ain't no danger we can go too far
We start believing now that we can be what we are
Grease is the word
They think our love is just a growing pain
Why don't they understand, it's just a crying shame
Their lips are lying only real is real
We stop the fight right now, we got to be what feel
Grease is the word
Grease is the word, is the word that you heard
It's got groove it's got meaning
Grease is the time, is the place, is the motion
Grease is the way we are feeling
We take the pressure and we throw away
Conventionality belongs to yesterday
There is a chance that we can make it so far
We start believing now but we can be who we are
Grease is the word
Grease is the word, is the word that you heard
It's got groove it's got meaning
(It's got the groove, It's got the groove)
Grease is the time, is the place, is the motion
Grease is the way we are feeling
This is the life of illusion
Wrapped up in trouble, laced with confusion
What are we doing here?
Uh, yeah, uh, yeah.
We take the pressure and we throw away
Conventionality belongs to yesterday
There is a chance that we can make it so far
We start believing now but we can be who we are
Grease is the word
Grease is the word, is the word that you heard
It's got groove it's got meaning (it's got meaning)
Grease is the time, is the place, is the motion
Grease is the way we are feeling
(Repeat Chorus)
Yeah
Grease is the word (is the word)
Is the word.
