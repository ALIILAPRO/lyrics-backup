		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, it's a marvelous night for a moondance
With the stars up above in your eyes
A fantabulous night to make romance
'Neath the cover of October skies

And all the leaves on the trees are falling
To the sound of the breezes that blow
And I'm trying to please to the calling
Of your heart-strings that play soft and low

And all the night's magic seems to whisper and hush
And all the soft moonlight seems to shine in your blush

Can I just have one more moondance with you, my love
Can I just make some more romance with you, my love

Well I want to make love to you tonight
I can't wait till the morning has come
And I know that the time is just right
And straight into my arms you will run

And when you come my heart will be waiting
To make sure that you're never alone
There and then all my dreams will come true, dear
There and then I will make you my own

Anytime I touch you, you just tremble inside
And I know how much you want me that you can't hide

Can I just have one more moondance with you, my love
Can I just make some more romance with you, my love

Well I want to make love to you tonight
I can't wait till the morning has come
And I know that the time is just right
And straight into my arms you will run

And when you come my heart will be waiting
To make sure that you're never alone
There and then all my dreams will come true, dear
There and then I will make you my own

Anytime I touch you, you just tremble inside
And I know how much you want me that you can't hide

Can I just have one more moondance with you, my love
Can I just make some more romance with you, my love

Can I just have one more moondance with you, my love
Can I just make some more romance with you, my love, my love, my love
I just want one more moondance with you
