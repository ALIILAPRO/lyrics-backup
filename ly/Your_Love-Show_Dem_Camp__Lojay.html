		  For me, baby
(If it's Spax then it's gotta be a)
Whine for me, baby
Whine for me, baby

Girl, I need your bottom, bottom (bottom)
All the way 'til sun up, sun up (sun up)
Be like say na kana, kana (kana)
When you blow the bana, bana (bana)
And na she say she willing to love (to love)
'Cause I give her reasons enough (enough)
Only me know why my feelings dey rush (dey rush)
I see the way I follow you, follow you 
For your love again (again)
Your love again (again)
I no fit throw your love away (away)
If I go live for another day ('nother day, oh)
All other girls for sockaway (away)
'Cause e be you I want, darling
And girl I need your love again (love again)
I only need your love again (again)
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa

Yo, I was greeting shawty like a blade
Soda, pami' and a spliff
Down to risk it all 'cause mami is legit (uh)
We caught each other's eyes and time cease to exist
I said "Omo, we go die here, keep whining dem hips"
Dj got the tunes, we caught in the mix
Hitting on the groove, see as we dey jig
I'm controlling the cruise, she calling me a trip
'Cause you know I be mumu when the heart is lifted
Two step, walk it out, mhm
Drop it down, mhm
Bartender come through, another round, yeah
Quarter past tipsy and still out on the town
We don't want it to end, we're on a cloud
So let the bill run up, run up
Let the turn up erupts into volcanic passion of summer lovers
Yeah, the pipework like a plumber, you know
Got your boy laying under covers, oh, yeah

Girl, I need your bottom, bottom (bottom)
All the way 'til sun up, sun up (sun up)
Be like say na kana, kana (kana)
When you blow the bana, bana (bana)
And na she say she willing to love (to love)
'Cause I give her reasons enough (enough)
Only me know why my feelings dey rush (dey rush)
I see the way I follow you, follow you 
For your love again (again)
Your love again (again)
I no fit throw your love away (away)
If I go live for another day ('nother day, oh)
All other girls for sockaway (away)
'Cause e be you I want, darling
And girl I need your love again (love again)
I only need your love again (again)
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa (yeah)

I put that booty in a coffin, we could do this often
Tell me slow down but that's really not my portion
Women in my circle, got a team full of bosses
Freed a couple babes omo had a couple loses
Really can't force it, some I had to forfeit
When it came to pies, they say show dem are remorseless
Bang bang omo that's the slang we endorsing
Finessing this corporate, we're never stepping office
Still, the vibe crazy, hail my lady (ha, yeah)
Sea side, palmwine, shit sound wavy
Hand on your waist beads, feeling like maybe 
I could risk it all omo please come save me

Your love again (again)
Your love again (again)
I no fit throw your love away (away)
If I go live for another day ('nother day, oh)
All other girls for sockaway (away)
'Cause e be you I want, darling
And girl I need your love again (love again)
I only need your love again (again)
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
