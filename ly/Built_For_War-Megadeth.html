		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Built for war, what do you think your fists are for? Built for war!

Listen, I didn't start this believe me, I will finish it
You called down the thunder too late now there's no way out
Nothing is gonna stop me until then better watch your back

Built for war, what do you think your fists are for? Built for war!

There is no retreating I will cut you down to size
You will beg for mercy a bad seed, you're as good as dead
Yield to new dimension Hell's coming, better say your prayers

Built for war, what do you think your fists are for? Built for war!
Built for war, are you looking at me, you want some more?
What do you think your fists are for?

One day you will face me and see the terror trapped inside
Final retribution torture and pure punishment
Vengeance running so deep a dungeon of agony awaits
Fear not as death surrounds you 
Bitch all you want, but here it comes

Built for war, what do you think your fists are for? Built for war!
Built for war, are you looking at me, you want some more?
What do you think your fists are for?
