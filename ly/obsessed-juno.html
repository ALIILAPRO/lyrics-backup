		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And I tell them to listen, but they never do
And I don't wanna sound like you
I'm doing something new
She say I'm just like the rest
I said she way too obsessed
I'm thinking one more day and
Then I'll be gone and she like, "Juno
Why you like that at all?"
And is it bad that I
Can't fight back at all?
You can't get to the top if
You ain't ready to fall
You got my name in your phone
But you ain't ready to call
And I tell them to listen, but they never do
And I don't wanna sound like you
I'm doing something new
She say I'm just like the rеst
I said she way too obsessed
I'm thinking onе more day and
Then I'll be gone and she like, "Juno
Why you like that at all?"
And is it bad that I
Can't fight back at all?
You can't get to the top if
You ain't ready to fall
You got my name in your phone
But you ain't ready to call

And I'm ten thousand miles away
From the rest of the world, it's a shame now
And she told me that I was to blame
For the way of the world, how it is now
Sick of the background
I lost it for a sec but I'm back now
I told myself that I'd never back down
I went and got it for myself, fuck a handout
I grab the wheel
It looks like I'm in command now

And I tell them to listen, but they never do
And I don't wanna sound like you
I'm doing something new
She say I'm just like the rest
I said she way too obsessed
I'm thinking one more day and
Then I'll be gone and she like, "Juno
Why you like that at all?"
And is it bad that I
Can't fight back at all?
You can't get to the top if
You ain't ready to fall
You got my name in your phone
But you ain't ready to call

Hello?
