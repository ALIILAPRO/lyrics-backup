		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can tell the way you looking at
Me bitch you think I ain't shit
Run up on me bitch I grip that
Clip and leave that face spl-

First things first fuck an intro aye
Got the shit that make you cock, lock and aim
Get your greasy ass hands off my name
If I see you talk down put the work like-
Hold it down, hold it down, hold
It down, hold it down, hold it down
I'll be riding through my town
Got more hit's than Tumblr genders
High rise get 22's like Bender
Got a lot to say, I'm out here getting paid
I stunt on my rivals like my name Amadeus
Heart broke once, said never again
Only regret: never got revenge
Haven't done shows my fans like "when?"
Only doing those when they're
Sell out events

Try to hold it down
Man I try to hold it down
I've been all around
Man I've been all around
Reminisce on Nuketown
Swear those were the days
Reminisce on Nuketown
Swear those were the days
Try to hold it down
Man I try to hold it down
I've been all around
Man I've been all around
Reminisce on Nuketown
Swear those were the days
Reminisce on Nuketown, bout to cock and aim

I can tell the way you looking at
Me bitch you think I ain't shit
Run up on me bitch I grip that
Clip and leave that face split
Sick of all these evil people
Bout to leave 'em nameless
Laughing at you while you beg
Forgiveness bitch you ain't shit
Run from the gun I've been looking for blood
Slumped up when I'm pumped
Up click clack done
Pray, devil came and opened the gates
Don't run away when I spray hope
You're good with the faith
Annihilation face the devastation
The satisfaction from the automatic
Run up on me gonna get a little problematic
When I pop the top can never get me to stop
I drop bombs on these streets
They can't handle the heat
I'm taking over like a motherfucking
King hear the sirens sing
The violence raining terror on
This silent era
I can tell the way you looking at
Me bitch you think I ain't shit
Run up on me bitch I grip that
Clip and leave that face split
Sick of all these evil people
Bout to leave 'em nameless
Laughing at you while you beg
Forgiveness bitch you ain't shit

Try to hold it down
Man I try to hold it down
I've been all around
Man I've been all around
Reminisce on Nuketown
Swear those were the days
Reminisce on Nuketown
Swear those were the days
Try to hold it down
Man I try to hold it down
I've been all around
Man I've been all around
Reminisce on Nuketown
Swear those were the days
Reminisce on Nuketown, bout to cock and aim
