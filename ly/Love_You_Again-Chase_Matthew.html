		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Gonna love you again, gonna love you again)
(I'm gonna love you like I'm never gonna love you again)

It's been a hell of a week, been countin' every minute
I know what's waitin' for me and I can't wait to get it
Let's leave my truck in the drive 'cause, girl, I'm on a mission
We can stay in tonight, but I got one condition
Yeah, I know we made plans with the neons
But you're lookin' lights out, turnin' me on

That black dress got your boy seein' red
Slippin' off your shoulders, pullin' me into bed
Make it last like it's the last time
Tonight, I'm gonna love you like I'm never gonna love you again
Let the midnight go where it's gonna go
Let the candlelight shadows put on a show
Talkin' sunset to sunrise
Tonight, I'm gonna love you like I'm never gonna love you again

(Like I'm never gonna love you again)

You got me drunk on your love, we're makin' every letter
If you gon' kiss me like you kiss me, make it last forever
'Cause you're the king- ize I wanna be on
Everything about you baby's turnin' me on

That black dress got your boy seein' red
Slippin' off your shoulders, pullin' me into bed
Make it last like it's the last time
Tonight, I'm gonna love you like I'm never gonna love you again
Let the midnight go where it's gonna go
Let the candlelight shadows put on a show
Talkin' sunset to sunrise
Tonight, I'm gonna love you like I'm never gonna love you again

(Gonna love you again, gonna love you again)
(I'm gonna love you like I'm never gonna love you again)
(Gonna love you again, gonna love you again)
(I'm gonna love you like I'm never gonna love you again)

That black dress got your boy seein' red
Slippin' off your shoulders, pullin' me into bed
Make it last like it's the last time
Tonight, I'm gonna love you like I'm never gonna love you again
Let the midnight go where it's gonna go
Let the candlelight shadows put on a show
Talkin' sunset to sunrise
Tonight, I'm gonna love you like I'm never gonna love you again

(Gonna love you again, gonna love you again)
Tonight, I'm gonna love you like I'm never gonna love you again
(Gonna love you again, gonna love you again)
(I'm gonna love you like I'm never gonna love you again)
