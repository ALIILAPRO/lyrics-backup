		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Got to get back to the telephone,
Make some money from a complete unknown.
I know everything that I've got to say,
I know 'cause I'm a good businessman.

I can make you rich, I can make you a name,
Promise you the world if you'll play my game.
If you don't want to play it, don't bother me.
That's why I'm a good businessman.

A good businessman, a good businessman,
A good businessman, a good businessman.

If I find that you ain't got no trust in me,
Then it's time to use my psychology.
I can change your mind, I can turn you around,
I know 'cause I'm a good businessman.

Let me tell you now, I don't need your respect,
Seems to me there's one thing that you forget:
I ain't in this business to be friends with you,
That's why I'm a good businessman.

A good businessman, a good businessman,
A good businessman, a good businessman.

(instrumental break)
Got to get back to the telephone,
Make some money from a complete unknown.
I know everything that I've got to say,
I know 'cause I'm a good businessman.

I can make you rich, I can make you a name,
Promise you the world if you'll play my game.
If you don't want to play it, don't bother me.
That's why I'm a good businessman.

A good businessman, a good businessman,
A good businessman, a good businessman.
