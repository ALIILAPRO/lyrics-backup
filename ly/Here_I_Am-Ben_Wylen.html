		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Ooh)
[Verse 1]
I rise up to the sun
It always seems to be waiting for me
Some days I feel like the wind
Don’t know where this all leads
Don’t know where it began
[Pre-Chorus]
But I’ve travelled all this way
In the end it’ll be worth the wait
[Chorus]
Here I am
I’m never letting go
But my hands are shaking
Heart is racing
Mind is breaking down
Here I am
I’m never going home
But my hands are shaking
Heart is racing
Mind is breaking
[Verse 2]
I gaze up at the moon
I ask myself did I come here too soon (I don’t know)
Some nights I feel like the rain
That plods on the street and
Trickles down the drain
But I’ve travelled all this way
In the end it’ll be worth the wait
[Chorus]
Here I am
I’m never letting go
But my hands are shaking
Heart is racing
Mind is breaking down
Here I am
I’m never going home
But my hands are shaking
Heart is racing
Mind is breaking down
(Ooh)
[Bridge]
I feel the hunger kicking in
I’m tired of being lost
I’m tired of the same
I won’t let anything stand in my way
I’ve seen enough to know
That to be free you must know pain
[Chorus]
Here I am
I’m never letting go
But my hands are shaking
Heart is racing
Mind is breaking down
Here I am
I’m never going home
But my hands are shaking
Heart is racing
Mind is breaking down
(Ooh)
(Ooh)
(Ooh)
