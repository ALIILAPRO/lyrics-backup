		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I’ve got to wear a different perfume
You keep on talking to yourself
I see no need to pretend
Please just tell’em the truth
I won’t avoid no confrontations
You keep on talking to yourself
Now it is time to break the spell
Please just leave me alone
Cause I’m running out of self control

Step right on to that stage and tell’em my name
If I try to live it up so much, why do you treat me this way

Put on a smile for this occasion
You keep on talking to yourself
I don’t know what I’m waiting for
Please just tell’em the truth
Let them know you have a problem
You keep on talking to yourself
Should I be taken for a fool
Please just leave me alone
Cause I’m running out of self control

Step right on to that stage and tell’em my name
If I try to live it up so much, why do you treat me this way

Do you care, do you bother
You keep on talking to yourself
Do you need some kind of proof
Please just tell’em the truth
If you got no one else to talk to
You keep on talking to yourself
I know I need another groove
Please just leave me alone
Cause I’m running out of self control

Step right on to that stage and tell’em my name
If I try to live it up so much, why do you treat me this way
I’m not afraid to do it, not afraid to say it - it doesn’t matter
Step right on to that stage and tell’em my name

You keep on talking to yourself
You keep on talking to yourself
You keep on talking to yourself
You keep on talking to yourself
You keep on talking to yourself
