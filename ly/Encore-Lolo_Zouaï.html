		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You get what you like
Got used to the life
Never gotta ask twice
Keep 'em waiting in line
All the others fake
They can't handle what it takes
You need somewhere to get away
From all the cameras in your face

I can make you feel like
Oh, excited
Oh, you know where to find it
Oh, tonight is
Front row show time, you're invited

He said, "if it's mine, it's yours"
Give me everything I want and more
Doing things we never done before
Say my name like you want an encore

Hey, low, low, low, low, love it when you drop it
Low, low, low, low, low, keep it going, low, low

Oui, bon appétit
Montre-moi comment tu vis
Give me the key
And let me take over the spotlight
Know you had enough
Take it off now, I wanna feel it on me
Candy so sweet
Jusqu'à lundi
Ooh, I think they caught us on the CCTV
I don't really care just keep on looking at me
Looking at me

Baby, can you tell I'm so (I'm so) excited?
No hands when I ride it
Oh, baby tonight is
Front row show time, you're invited

He said, "if it's mine, it's yours"
Give me everything I want and more
Doing things we never done before
Say my name like you want an encore
(Say my name like you want an encore)
He said, "if it's mine, it's yours"
Give me everything I want and more
Doing things we never done before
I'll make it-, for an encore

Low, low, low, low, love it when you drop it
Low, low, low, low, low, keep it going, keep it on the low
