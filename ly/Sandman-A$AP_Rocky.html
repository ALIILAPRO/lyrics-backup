		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh, A$AP, yeah
Welcome back
We've been missin' you
This what they been waiting for
Crash Course (rest in peace, uh, Eastside Stevie)

My mind like George Lucas, I think like Stanley Kubrick
House full of eucalyptus, that boy straight mucus
So, let's get straight to it, my chain is this humongous
Permanent bling my tooth is, yeah, I'm a strange human
This insane jewelry collection, it'll take a week to shoot it (word)
Record an album with Mercedes, let GQ EQ it (haha)
I think I'm Frank Lucas, slang where my boo thing school is (yeah)
A straight A-student (word), boy, the brain stupid
Leave it all in the past now, walls talkin' back now
Back to the wall, with your wall to the back, don't back down
Buck up, tell 'em how the fuck your mama ain't raise no bitch
Gloves on the dashboard, mask on the lat' now
MAC on the lap, on the hip while the red-blue lights in the background
Cops wanna pat down, just pray the clip don't (click, click)

Merci beaucoup, just like Moulin Rouge
And I know I can, can, and my spirit stand, stands
I say, "Voulez-Vous coucher for eternity"
Let's go meet the sandman, let our spirits dance, dance

Uh, on the skyway to Hell, with smiley face jewels
'Cause I'm a boss, I call the shots, you makin' calls
'Cause if I take a L, then they gon' take a loss
If I'm on my way to Hell, then I'ma take you all
Girl, I'm not supposed to be here still
Rap careers last three years still
I'm a G here, that's OG times three
Triple OG, still just shows I'ma be here, still at three-o
Got bitches on me, and the females still let 'em be here still
At twenty-six, my nigga OD off of lean, codeine and pills
He'll be here still

Merci beaucoup, just like Moulin Rouge
And I know I can, can, and my spirit stand, stands
I say, "Voulez-Vous coucher for eternity"
Let's go meet the sandman, let our spirits dance, dance

Rest in peace to Yams, I done lost some friends
Until we meet again, we gon' forever dance, sleep
Voulez-vous coucher for eternity
Let's go meet the sandman, let our spirits dance, dance

Uh, yeah, yeah (I'm just)
Uh, yeah, yeah (I'm just)
Uh, yeah, yeah (I'm just)
Uh, yeah, yeah (I'm just)

Merci beaucoup, just like Moulin Rouge
And I know I can, can, and my spirit stand, stands
I say, "Voulez-Vous coucher for eternity"
Let's go meet the sandman, let our spirits dance, dance
