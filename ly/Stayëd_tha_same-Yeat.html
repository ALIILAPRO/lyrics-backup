		  Yeah, I, I, I just walk in with the
I, I, with the same gang
I got rich with the same gang
I just walk around my mansion, let my nuts hang
I got rich with the same gang
Yeah, got y'all sweatin', yeah, the whole gang
I be higher than God, bitch, I'm a crane
I be walkin' 'round my mansion, let my nuts hang
I just pulled up on a side, ooh
Ayy, I like to give her surprise (get turnt, get turnt, get turnt)
I'm on the Perc', I been closin' my eyes
I can't even tell you nothin' but you're lyin'
I had to cut all my ties, I couldn't even tell 'em nothin' 'cause they fried

I just walked in, stepping in these Louboutins
And she walked in, she clinging on my fuckin' junk
Yeah, I was shippin' Za', I was shippin' skunk
I take the Perc' and meditate, I'm a fucking monk
Yeah, why the hell you wastin' all my time? Why you catfish?
I just blocked you on my phone, on my time, bitch
All my bitch the baddest, yeah, a fine bitch
Yeah, one of my bitch a junky, she a fried bitch
What you tell the cops? Yeah, lyin' snitch
I just touched an M, Buffett rich (milli')
I just bought a private jet, yeah, stupid rich
Bitch, it's been fuck what they said, yeah, TwizzyRich

Yeah, I, I, I just walk in with the
I, I, with the same gang
I got rich with the same gang
I just walk around my mansion, let my nuts hang
I got rich with the same gang
Yeah, got y'all sweatin', yeah, the whole gang
I be higher than God, bitch, I'm a crane
I be walkin' 'round my mansion, let my nuts hang
I just pulled up on a side, ooh
Ayy, I like to give her surprise (get turnt, get turnt, get turnt)
I'm on the Perc', I been closin' my eyes
I can't even tell you nothin' but you're lyin'
I had to cut all my ties, I couldn't even tell 'em nothin' 'cause they fried

I just walked in, steppin' in these Louboutins
And she walked in, she clingin' on my fucking junk
Yeah, I was shippin' Za', I was shippin' skunk
I take the Perc' and meditate, I'm a fuckin' monk
