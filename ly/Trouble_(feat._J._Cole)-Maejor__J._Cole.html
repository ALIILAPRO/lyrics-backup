		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I, I, I, I
I told you
Not to wear that dress at the club tryna dance up on me
I, I, I, I, I, I told you, not to push that thing on me
If you know I want it, uh, uh

It's gon' get you in trouble (ooh, ooh)
It's gon' get you in trouble (ooh, ooh)
It's gon' get you in trouble (ooh, ooh)
It's gon' get you in trouble (ooh, ooh)

Baby I told you
Not to wear them heels that make your legs look so sexy
I, I, I, I, I
I told you
Not to wear them heels that say I'm ready come get me
Uh, uh

They gon' get you in trouble (ooh, ooh)
They gon' get you in trouble (ooh, ooh)
They gon' get you in trouble (ooh, ooh)
They gon' get you in trouble

Go up to my room
You've been such a, such a bad girl
Such a sexy, naughty girl
You know what you doing baby
Go up to my room, girl
You've been such a, such a bad girl (Cole, where)
Such a sexy, naughty girl (whoa, whoa)

Yeah, invitations in the whirlwind
We both bad at it
Told myself no more hittin' niggas' girlfriends
That's my old bad habit
But here you go, wearin' that
Already know, what I'm staring at
I mean from top to bottom your body is problem so
Somebody better take care of that
And who
Better than, the nigga ain't let 'em in
When your man ain't home, you can let him in
Late night Letterman
I ain't gon tat-a-tale
Damn your ass bad as hell

It's gon' get you in trouble (ooh, ooh)
It's gon' get you in trouble (ooh, ooh)
It's gon' get you in trouble (ooh, ooh)
It's gon' get you in trouble (ooh, ooh)

I-I-I-I-I told you 
Not to stare at me like that while I'm performing
I, I, I, I told you
That that's gon' make us till the early morning
That's a warnin'

It's gon' get you in trouble (ooh, ooh)
It's gon' get you in trouble (ooh, ooh)
It's gon' get you in trouble (ooh, ooh)
Gon' get you in trouble (ooh, ooh)
