		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, you already know what it is (Swerve)
It's noisy off the set path
How can I make choices I've yet to discover we have?
Must need rehab
If you think you know me from the facets they show these folks to get money, I gotta laugh
How funny it is you don't realize the skill lies in knowing within the truth there's still lies
It's called being civilized
But not to trivialize your belief in the semi-fictionalized
I am who you see
What you hear is part of me
But there's so much more to me
So much more to be than just alive
A son, a brother, a husband, a father
But still can go even farther
With sheer will, can go harder
In that time, I went the hardest
More than this generic term: artist
A reality smith, you love my craftsmanship
Because I craft some shit to make my people proud
And so I speak aloud, but not loud enough yet
Or as loud as I can get
They think I ain't a threat
But all preconceived notions, I've arrived
To Offset

I was 17 years old when I had you (When I had you)
Tryna find my soul when I had you (When I had you)
I was oh so broke when I had you (When I had you)
Locked up down the road when I had you (When I had you)
Jordan, sorry I wasn't there for all your birthdays
I tried to hit, I wasn't rich, and had no workplace
My son Kody, he three, rappin' already like me
Ridin' in the car, you don't play me, then he gon' scream

Kalia, you my first, first daughter
I missed the first years of your life, I'm sorry
Tell the truth, I ain't really know if I was your father
Tell the truth, I really don't even know your mama
But I had to step up, my daddy had left us
Even though we gotta catch up, pray to God that he bless us
I'ma keep grindin' for my kids, never gon' let up
I'ma put the money up for y'all, I can't be selfish
Had a baby as a kid, mama kicked me out
Had to go and hit a lick, tryna put food in your mouth
Then I got caught for the shit, in the pen when she pushed you out
Your mama tried to push me down, ain't let me stay at the house

I was 17 years old when I had you (When I had you)
Tryna find my soul when I had you (When I had you)
I was oh so broke when I had you (When I had you)
Locked up down the road when I had you (When I had you)
Jordan, sorry I wasn't there for all your birthdays
I tried to hit, I wasn't rich, and had no workplace
My son Kody, he three, rappin' already like me
Ridin' in the car, you don't play me, then he gon' scream

I'm a father of four, gotta get that cash, gold
Keep my past closed, 'member I ain't had no dough
Spend a big bag on clothes, Gucci from the head to toes
Not two, not three, all four, that's all they know
Kulture, remind me of my grandma, feel like she is closer
Gotta thank your mama, she hold me like holsters
Gotta protect her from the world, I can't even post her
Ups and downs in this fame, roller coaster
If I don't ball, then everything 'round me fall
I'm prayin' to God to watch my kids, that's my all

I was 17 years old when I had you (When I had you)
Tryna find my soul when I had you (When I had you)
I was oh so broke when I had you (When I had you)
Locked up down the road when I had you (When I had you)
Jordan, sorry I wasn't there for all your birthdays
I tried to hit, I wasn't rich, and had no workplace
My son Kody, he three, rappin' already like me
Ridin' in the car, you don't play me, then he gon' scream
