		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Unstable heart, it's time now to sleep
The moon will be watching over your dreams
Unstable heart, it's time now to rest
Let today's worries come to an end
Oh unstable heart, you'll be okay
Someone will catch you if you fall today
Oh unstable heart, you'll be okay
Someone will catch you if you fall today
Unstable heart, it's what you need
Relax your mind and find clarity
Unstable heart, look for your peace
To let you hold on, even without me
Oh unstable heart, you'll be okay
Maybe I'll catch you if you fall today
Oh unstable heart, you'll be okay
Maybe you'll catch you if you fall today
Maybe you'll catch you if you fall today
Oh unstable heart, you'll be okay
Maybe I'll catch you if you fall today
Oh unstable heart, you'll be okay
Maybe you'll catch you if you fall today
Maybe you'll catch you if you fall today
