		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm reading through the Sunday paper and it's all bad news
I'm looking for a smile on the streets but it's just no use
Sing with me now

I jump into my car, turn the key, but it just won't start
I got a text from my ex, it's official she just broke my heart

Storm clouds are circling around
But I won't let that shit drag me down

So I'll be singing (I'll be singing)
I'll be singing (I'll be singing)
I'll be singing in the rain (singing in the rain)

So I'll be singing (I'll be singing)
I'll be singing (I'll be singing)
I'll be singing in the rain (singing in the rain)

I've got a song in my heart and I'm bulletproof
There's nothing in the world that's gonna kill this mood
No matter what life wants to throw my way
I'll be singing, I'll be singing in the rain

I went to see a fortune teller and she said I'm doomed
But what the hell does she know
Why she trying to break my groove

All of life's colors turn to gray
Then you turn around and you smile my way
Suddenly all my problems disappear on cue (all because of you)

Storm clouds are circling around
But I won't let that shit drag me down

So I'll be singing (I'll be singing)
I'll be singing (I'll be singing)
I'll be singing in the rain (singing in the rain)

So I'll be singing (I'll be singing)
I'll be singing (I'll be singing)
I'll be singing in the rain (singing in the rain)

I've got a song in my heart and I'm bulletproof
There's nothing in the world that's gonna kill this mood
No matter what life wants to throw my way
I'll be singing, I'll be singing in the rain

Storm clouds are circling around
But I won't let that shit drag me down, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

So I'll be singing (I'll be singing)
I'll be singing (I'll be singing)
I'll be singing in the rain (singing in the rain)

So I'll be singing (I'll be singing)
I'll be singing (I'll be singing)
I'll be singing in the rain (singing in the rain)

I've got a song in my heart and I'm bulletproof
There's nothing in the world that's gonna kill this mood
No matter what life wants to throw my way
I'll be singing, I'll be singing in the rain
