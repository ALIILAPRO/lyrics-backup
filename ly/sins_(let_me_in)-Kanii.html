		  You say that you need me
But I don't feel needed at all
Girl I been through your hardest
And you broke me regardless
Catch me before I fall down

So let me in
Don't give in
Trust me girl
Take all your sins
So let me in
Don't give in
Trust me girl
Take all your sins
So let me in
Don't give in
Trust me girl
Take all your sins
So let me in

So let me girl take girl take girl
So let me girl take all your sins
So let me girl take all your sins
So let me girl take all your sins

So let me in

Cause I can change your life
I can give you everything you've wanted
So keep me in your mind girl
And everything is fine

Cause we've been through everything woah
So let me in
