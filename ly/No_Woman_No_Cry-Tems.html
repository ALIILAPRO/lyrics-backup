		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No, woman, no cry
No, woman, no cry

I remember when we used to sit
In the government yard in Trenchtown
Oba, observing the hypocrites
Mingle with the good people we meet
Good friends we have and good friends we've lost
Along the way
In this great future, you can't forget your past
So dry your tears I say

No woman, no cry
No woman, no cry
'Ere, little darlin', don't shed no tears
No, woman, no cry

Said I remember when we used to sit
In the government yard in Trenchtown
And then Georgie would make the fire light, as it was
Log wood burning through the night
Then we would cook cornmeal porridge
Of which I'll share with you
My feet is my only carriage
No, I've got to push on through
So while I'm gone

Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be alright now
Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be alright now
Everything's gonna be alright

So woman, no cry, cry, cry
No, woman, no (no, woman, no cry)
No
No, woman, no cry, no cry
No, woman, no cry

Mmh, ooh
Ohh
