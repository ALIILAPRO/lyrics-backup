		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mob Ties This What You Look Like In God Eyes
Hop Out The Vette With The Frog Eyes
Never Trust Bitches They All Lies
All Of Yo Potnas Some Fall Guys
Hit They Ass Up And They Wont Slide
Call My Lil Blood Up & He Gone Ride
187 A   Homicide A Homicide

Mob Ties This What You Look Like In God Eyes
Hop Out The Vette With The Frog Eyes
Never Trust Bitches They All Lies
All Of Yo Potnas Some Fall Guys
Hit They Ass Up And They Wont Slide
Call My Lil Blood Up & He Gone Ride
187 A Homicide A Homicide

I Bought My Glock In This Bitch
I Aint Going For Nothing
Lil Bro Keep A Strap Put A Hole In Stomach
Fuck All Of That Hoe Shit
Lil Bro Why You Mumbling
Stop Loving Them Hoes
Bro They Not A Hundred
Sucked The Whole Click For A Lil Bit Of Money
Stay Down With My Dogs If I Call You They Coming
2 Niggas Pull Up But They Busting A 100
ummm Ahhhaa
Aint Part Of No Band
Drummers Hanging Out Of The Matt
We Gone Scoot Up Broad Day Like This
Were You At
I Love When She Say She Don't Need A Nigga
I Might Bust On Her Face Like A Feva Blister
On My Granny Grave A Different Nigga
Every Verse I Write Is Like A Bible Scripture
Im A Holly Nigga Yeah Yo Main Bitch
I Let My Potna Hit Her  Yeahhh

Mob Ties This What You Look Like In God Eyes
Hop Out The Vette With Frog Eyes
Never Trust Bitches They All Lies
All Of Yo Potnas Some Fall Guys
Hit They Ass Up And They Wont Slide
Call My Lil Blood Up And He Gone Ride
187 A Homicide A Homicide
Mob Ties This What You Look Like In God Eyes
Hop Out The Vette With Frog Eyes
Never Trust Bitches They All Lies
All Of Yo Patnas Some Fall Guys
Hit They Ass Up And They Wont Slide
Call My Lil Blood Up And He Gone Ride
187 A Homicide A Homicide
Sipping On Gin  In A St Laurent Fur
Im Just Digging Her Body
So In To Her Might Fuck On Her
Fuck Her Friend First Both Of The Hoes
Yeah They Digging My Verse
Digging My Style They Aint Know 
That I Got Em They Know How I Rock
And They Know That Im Popping
Nigga Approach Me Get Beat Up Like Rocky
Bitch I'm Just Hot Like A Motherfuckin Take
Don't Play With Me Nigga Don't Play You Bitches
I'm Focused On Ritches Ain't Worried About Niggas   
Run Up On Me Then I Keep This Bitch Loaded
Nigga I'm Pressure I Just Might Explode It
Applying Pressure To These Bitches And Niggas  
I Got To Get It For All Of My Siblings
I Want A Bag Y'all Focused On Ritches
Fuck The Hoes I Ain't Worried About Bitches

Mob Ties This What You Look Like In God Eyes 
Hop Out The Vette With The Frog Eyes
Never Trust Bitches They All Lies
All Of Yo Potnas Some Fall Guys
Hit The Ass Up And The Wont Slide
Call My Lil Blood Up And He Gone Ride
187 A Homicide A Homicide.
