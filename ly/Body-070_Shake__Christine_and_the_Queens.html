		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Never consider that you're just a woman in body
Never consider I forget about your body

Body, body, body
Body, body, body, body

Mmh
Never consider I never think about it daily
Never consider I can't pretend to see your

Body, body, body
Body, body, body, body
(let me show you where my mind is)

I think I got to know your body
I think I got to know your body (where you mind is)
We'll travel to the dream, stay flying (where you mind is)
I guess I found me a new high (yeah)

You took it personal
As soon as it got physical
She ran it up then ran off
But when the limelight's off
And when the party's over
And when the Novocaine don't work
I'll be the one touching on your

Body, body, body, body
I think I fell in love with your body
Body, body, body, body
I guess I found me a new high

Free as the wind as I fall out the window
And I think I'm moving
as pure as the blood in my

Body, body, body, body
I think I fell in love with your body
Body, body, body, body
I'm mad that I just get can't hide it

Say hello to your body
When I'm back out on the road
Talk to me with your body
When your words can't anymore
(Words can't anymore)
I wanted your body
But it came with your soul
