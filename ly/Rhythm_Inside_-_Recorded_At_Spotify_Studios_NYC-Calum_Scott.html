		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So many eyes, I can't see
I'm static, and I can't move my feet
From the moment, that you stood next to me
Feeling manic, I forgot how to speak

And there's a rhythm inside
That I can't slow down
In this moment in time
No, I won't stop now
Give up, my hand's up for love

And there's a rhythm inside
That I can't slow down
In this moment in time
No, I won't stop now
Give up, my hands up for love

It feels like I can be the one for your love
Come, show me what you're feeling
It feels like I can be the one for your love
Come, show me how you're feeling
Come, show me
Come, show me what you're feeling
Come, show me how you're feeling (Show me what you're feeling)

Time, only knows how to heal
Feels like magic, I don't know if this is real
When the lights go out, and my feet don't even wanna touch the ground
I feel the panic, of my world turned upside down

There's a rhythm inside
That I can't slow down
In this moment in time
No, I won't stop now
Give up, my hand's up for love

And there's a rhythm inside
That I can't slow down
In this moment in time
No, I won't stop now
Give up, my hand's up for love

It feels like I can be the one for your love
Come, show me what you're feeling
It feels like I can be the one for your love
Come, show me how you're feeling
Come, show me
Come, show me what you're feeling
Come, show me how you're feeling (Show me what you're feeling)
