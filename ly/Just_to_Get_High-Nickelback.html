		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  He was my best friend, I tried to help him
But he traded everything, for suffering
And found himself alone
I watched the lying, turn into hiding
With scars on both his lips, his fingertips
Were melted to the bone

But I can still remember what his face looked like
When I found him in an alley in the middle of the night
Tell me what you know! Tell me what you gone and done now!
Tell me what you know! Tell me what you gone and done now!
Gun would do the trick, get it over with
You're better off
To take all you've got and burn it on the spot
Just to get high, (high)

Three days no sleeping, he gave up eating
He sold his mother's rings, she said nothing
And pretended not to know
He started stealing, to supply the feeling
Found out he pulled a knife, on someone's wife
And held it to her throat

But I can still remember what his face looked like
When I found him in an alley in the middle of the night
Tell me what you know! Tell me what you gone and done now!
Tell me what you know! Tell me what you gone and done now!
Gun would do the trick, get it over with
You're better off
To take all you've got and burn it on the spot
Just to get high (high)

Tell me what did, where you gone and hid?
Show me!
What you really want, was it what you got?
Slowly!
Circling the drain, throw it all away
Just to get high, (high)
High, oh!

(High, high)
High
(High, high)
High

Tell me what you know! Tell me what you gone and done now!
Tell me what you know! Tell me what you gone and done now!
Gun would do the trick, get it over with
You're better off
To take all that you've got and burn it on the spot
Just to get high, (high)
Tell me what did, where you gone and hid?
Show me!
What you really want, was it what you got?
Slowly!
Circling the drain, throw it all away
Just to get high
Just to get high
Circling the drain, throw it all away
Just to get high
