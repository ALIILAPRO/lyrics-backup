		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take me now, baby here as I am
Pull me close, try and understand
Desire is hunger, is the fire I breathe
Love is the banquet on which we feed

Come on now, try to understand
The way I feel when I'm in your hands
Take my hand, come undercover
They can't hurt you now
Can't hurt you now
Can't hurt you now

Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to lust
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us

Have I doubt when I'm alone
Love is a ring, the telephone
Love is an angel disguised as lust
Here in our bed 'til the morning comes

Come on now try and understand
The way I feel under your command
Take my hand as the sun descends
They can't touch you now
They can't hurt you now
Can't hurt you now

Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to lust
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us

With love, we sleep
With doubt, the vicious circle turn and burns
Without you, oh I cannot live
Forgive, the yearning burning, I believe
It's time, too real to feel
Touch me now, touch me now, touch me now

Hey, because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to lust
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us

Because tonight there are two lovers
If we believe, in the night we trust
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us

If we believe, in the night we trust
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us

Oh, the night
Because the night
Because the night

Patti Smith!
Thank you everybody!
