		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I just wanna talk now
But honestly, I'm inside out
I'm blending with the walls, and
They're closin' on me, closin' on me
Tired of fake faces
Tellin' me as if they know
All of my pages
That I've never shown, I've never shown

Surrounded by
All my friends but I'm
Feelin' like I don't fit in
So I keep on pretendin' that
I'm not missin'
The way you feel
So I keep on pretendin'
You ain't on my mind

I don't feel like dancin'
Unless I'm there with you
'Cause when I'm by myself
I'm always thinkin' 'bout you
Now, I don't wanna go out
Unless you're comin' too
'Cause when I'm by myself
I'm always thinkin' 'bout you

I don't wanna dance unless you wanna
I don't wanna dance unless you wanna
I don't wanna dance unless you wanna
I don't wanna dance, I don't wanna dance
I don't wanna dance unless you wanna
I don't wanna dance unless you wanna
I don't wanna dance unless you wanna
I don't wanna dance, I don't wanna dance

You are my safety
I don't need to bite my tongue
Can say what I wanna say
I can be who I am, not just anyone

Surrounded by
All my friends but I'm
Feelin' like I don't fit in
So I keep on pretendin' that
I'm not missin'
The way you feel
So I keep on pretendin'
You ain't on my mind

I don't feel like dancin'
Unless I'm there with you
'Cause when I'm by myself
I'm always thinkin' 'bout you
Now, I don't wanna go out
Unless you're comin' too
'Cause when I'm by myself
I'm always thinkin' 'bout you

I don't wanna dance unless you wanna
I don't wanna dance unless you wanna
I don't wanna dance unless you wanna
I don't wanna dance, I don't wanna dance
I don't wanna dance unless you wanna
I don't wanna dance unless you wanna
I don't wanna dance unless you wanna
I don't wanna dance, I don't wanna dance

I don't wanna dance, wanna dance, now

I don't feel like dancin'
Unless I'm there with you
'Cause when I'm by myself
I'm always thinkin' 'bout you (I'm always thinkin' 'bout you)
Now, I don't wanna go out
Unless you're comin' too
'Cause when I'm by myself
I'm always thinkin' 'bout you

I don't wanna dance unless you wanna
I don't wanna dance unless you wanna
I don't wanna dance unless you wanna
I don't wanna dance, I don't wanna dance
I don't wanna dance unless you wanna
I don't wanna dance unless you wanna
I don't wanna dance unless you wanna
I don't wanna dance, I don't wanna dance
