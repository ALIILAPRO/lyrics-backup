		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Look at me, I feel homesick
Want my dog in the door
And the light in the kitchen
From the fridge, on the floor
And the faint overhearing
Of my mom on the phone
Through the walls of my bedroom
Things that I shouldn't know

Think the bus might be broken
'Cause the shocks never work
We're collectively hoping
That the drive will be short
People 24/7
It's the best and a curse
All they do is remind me
That I'm still introverted

I'm so high, but can't look down
Left my past life on the ground
Think I'm more alive somehow
I feel like myself right now

Pretty far from the ocean
Never thought that would hurt
Every lake here is frozen
Which is making it worse
This is somebody's hometown
Never been here before, mmm
Writing down every street sign
Missed the spelling, I'm sure

And I ended a friendship
On the day that I left
And though I really meant it
It still makes me upset
Am I losing my family
Every minute I'm gone?
What if my little brother
Thinks my leaving was wrong?

Oh, oh, I'm so high, but can't look down
Left my past life on the ground
Think I'm more alive somehow
I feel like myself right now

I'm so tired, but can't sit down
What if this is it for now?
Think I'm more alive somehow
I feel like myself right now
I feel like myself right now
I feel like myself right now
I feel like myself right now
Mmm
