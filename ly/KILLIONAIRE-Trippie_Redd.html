		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One time mi spring up this bumboclaat 
Mi waan hear this whole crowd say reload (killionaire)
(I'm shy, oh my God)

We don't get even
Look in my eyes, a demon
Bad lil' bitch, mamacita
Chops on my señorita
Bougie, a damn diva
They didn't damn believe us (yeah, uh)
We the goddamn achievers
Pussy, you best believe it

Pull up in fly attire, a dragon, a damn messiah
I pull up like Michael Myers, see, boy got the touch of Midas
I'm fly with no autopilot, I pull up, the tension heightened
I don't give a fuck 'bout a pussy-nigga, I step on you
I got that money, bitch, you could see it from head to toe
All that bullshit is for the birds, bitch, I'm a scarecrow
Me and my brothers, we stick together like Velcro
Ice on my wrist and put my bitch in Chanel, ho
Yeah, yeah, yeah, she wan' work for me, she wan' come and twerk for me
She gon' make it work for me, she wan' come and, huh
Slide out, do some dirt for me, she gon' go berserk for me
Pussy, was it worth defeat? (Baow, baow, baow)
Get to shootin', ain't no jersey, in the streets, bitch, I'm Curry
Icy like damn McFlurry, murder, take, can't do burglary
Muddy cup, like it dirt-dirty, we had to pay off the attorney
Prayed to God and he heard me, I could be anything like Kirby
Yeah, fresh as fuck, okay, then, he that boy, don't play with him
From that block since the playpen
It's a million opps, but a million racks I gotta rake in
Yeah, I run the mob, but I'm ready for combat like I'm Raiden
I rock Fear of God, nigga, fuck Satan
Say you with that murder gang shit, nigga, save it
I'm out in the Yams, I got fetti, I'm with the Haitians
All you niggas pussy, nigga, feed 'em the temptation

We don't get even
Look in my eyes, a demon
Bad lil' bitch, mamacita
Chops on my señorita
Bougie, a damn diva
They didn't damn believe us (yeah, uh)
We the goddamn achievers
Pussy, you best believe it
