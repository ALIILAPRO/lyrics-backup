		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Is anybody out there?
Is anybody listening?
Does anybody really know?
If it's the end of our beginning
A cry, a rush from one breath
Is all we're waiting for
Sometimes the one we're taking
Changes every one before

It's everything you wanted
It's everything you don't
It's one door swinging open 
And one door swinging closed
Some prayers find an answer
Some prayers never know
We're holding on and letting go

Sometimes we're holding angels
And we never even know
Don't know if we'll make it
But we know, we just can't let it show

It's everything you wanted
It's everything you don't
It's one door swinging open 
And one door swinging closed
Some prayers find an answer
Some prayers never know
We're holding on and letting go
Yeah, letting go

It's everything you wanted
It's everything you don't
It's one door swinging open 
And one door swinging closed
Some prayers find an answer
Some prayers never know
We're holding on and letting go

Oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh

It's everything you wanted
It's everything you don't
It's one door swinging open 
And one door swinging closed
Some prayers find an answer
Some prayers never know
We're holding on and letting go
