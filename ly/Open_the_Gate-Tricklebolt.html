		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You ascend your throne, hear the engines moan
The ones without sin will throw the first stone
The ones without sin should temper your pride
Cause those that don’t know sin can’t tell wrong from right

Open the gate let the spirit flow
I’m shifting gear, before the engine blows
Once in a while you’ve got to let me go
Cause then I open my gate and let my spirit flow

My hair is waving, goodbye to the past
I’ll keep the good things you keep the rest
That’s how we roll, huh? Uncle Sam
Faster, faster I increase the RPM

Open the gate let the spirit flow
I’m shifting gear, before the engine blows
Once in a while you’ve got to let me go
Cause then I open my gate and let my spirit flow
