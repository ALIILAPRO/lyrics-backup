		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I dreamt of a fever,
One that would cure me of this cold, winter set heart.
I dreamed of a fever
One that would cure me of this cold, winter set heart

With heat to melt these frozen tears
And burned with reasons as to carry on
Into these twisted months I plunge without a light to follow
But I swear that I would follow anything

If it would just get me out of here
And so you get six months to adapt
And then you get two more to leave town
In the event that you do adapt

We still might not want you around
And I fell for the promise of a life with a purpose
But I know that that is impossible now
And so I drink to stay warm

And to kill selected memories
Because I just can't think anymore about that or about her tonight
I give myself three days to feel better
Or I swear I'll drive right off a fucking cliff

Because if I can't learn to make myself feel better
Then how can I expect anyone else to give a shit?
And I scream for the sunlight or a car to take me anywhere
Just get me past this dead and eternal snow

Because I swear that I am dying, slowly, but it's happening
So if there is a perfect spring that's waiting somewhere
Just take me there and lie to me and say it's going to be all right
It's going to be all right, yeah, you worry too much, kid

It's going to be all right
