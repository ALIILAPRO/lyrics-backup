		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah

A good night, the best in a long time
A new friend turned me on to an old favorite
Nothing better than a dealer who's high
Be high, convince them to buy

What's my drug of choice?
Well, what have you got?
I don't go broke
And I do it a lot

Seems so sick to the hypocrite norm
Running their boring drills
But we are an elite race of our own
The stoners, junkies, and freaks
Are you happy?
I am, man
Content and fully aware
Money, status, nothing to me
Because your life's empty and bare

What's my drug of choice?
Well, what have you got?
See, I don't go broke
But I do it a lot
I do it a lot

Yeah

You can't understand a user's mind
But try, with your books and degrees
If you let yourself go and opened your mind
I'll bet you'd be using like me and it ain't so bad

What's my drug of choice?
Well, what have you got?
I don't go broke
And I do it a lot, I do it a lot
I said I do it a lot
I do it a lot 
I do it a lot
Said I do it a lot
