		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Some say I'm moving
From the wrong cloth
That I'm lost
But I'm on a reveling out
Got loose ends
Coming out

And if you close your eyes now
You can keep the world out
And if you close your eyes now
You can keep it spinning around

And I'm lost in the woods
And the darkness is coming
The storm is all around
Can you hear me cry?
If I'm lost in the woods
And the darkness is coming
The storm is all around

Feels like I'm floating
Down the river
That I know
Twisting and turning
When my head's gone down below

And if you close your eyes now
You can keep the world out
And if you close your eyes now
You can keep it spinning around

And I'm lost in the woods
And the darkness is coming
The storm is all around
Can you hear me cry?
If I'm lost in the woods
And the darkness is coming
The storm is all around
Can you hear me cry?

If I'm lost in the woods
And the darkness is coming
The storm is all around
And can you hear me cry?

If I'm lost in the woods
And the darkness is coming
The storm is all around
And can you hear me cry?

Oh-oh, oh-oh
Can you hear me cry?
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Can you hear me cry?
