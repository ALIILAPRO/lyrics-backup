		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I think of all the things I've done
And I know that it's only just begun
Those smiling faces
You know, I just can't forget them
But I love you

When I think of all the things I've seen
And I know that it's only the beginning
You know, those smiling faces
I just can't forget them
But for now I love you

Just for a little while
Oh baby, just to see you smile
Just for a little while

When I think of all the things I've done
And I know, that it's only just begun
Oh, smiling faces, Jesus
You know, I can't forget them
But for now, I love you
Watch this minute, baby
Now I love you
At least for now
I love you
