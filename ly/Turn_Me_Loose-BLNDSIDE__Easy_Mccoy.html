		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The kings back and the throne's mine
The future's here and it's my time
Straight shot, going for the head with it
Take his head off and say that I did it
Good riddance, say “hi” to the bad guy, back in business
If you took what's mine, I'm back to get it
There's nothing you can do, I'm back with vengeance

Now turn me loose

I'm bringing fire ‘til the final call
cin't nothing you can do, ‘cause I want it all
Legendary every day, I'm invincible
Came to play, you feel the heat
Break the chains and turn me loose

I'm bringing fire ‘til the final call
There‘s nothing you can do, ‘cause I want it all
Legendary every day, I'm invincible
Came to play, you feel the heat
Now's it's time to turn me loose

You can't hold me, I'm a go getter
I go hard and go to war with ya
I want freedom in its purest form
I can be the fire or the storm
No fear, never scared, forever dangerous
Got a wild heart you could never tame it
I'm legendary at the top, I'm above the law
I'm hard core, I give it to you raw

Now turn me loose

I'm bringing fire ‘til the final call
cin't nothing you can do, ‘cause I want it all
Legendary every day, I'm invincible
Came to play, you feel the heat
Break the chains and turn me loose

I'm bringing fire ‘til the final call
There‘s nothing you can do, ‘cause I want it all
Legendary every day, I'm invincible
Came to play, you feel the heat
Now's it's time to turn me loose

Uh, I'm bringing fire ‘til the final call
There ain't nothing you can do, ‘cause I want it all
Legendary every day, I'm invincible
Came to play you feel the heat
Now's it's time to turn me loose

Woah, woah, woah
Just turn me loose

I'm bringing fire ‘til the final call
There‘s nothing you can do, ‘cause I want it all
Legendary every day, I'm invincible
Came to play, you feel the heat
Now's it's time to turn me loose
