		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Some days I'm fine but some
Days I just wanna forget
Let it all out is what
I really should do instead (Oh oh oh)
Hold back the tears
Hoping one day the pain goes away (Oh oh oh)
Swallow my fear and accept that
There's no other way

Burn all the bridges that have been
In my heart long ago
You love someone but my heart
Isn't one that you chose
If I could say what was kept
Buried deep in my soul you would be mine
But I guess that's just how our lives go

(Burn all the bridges that have been
In my heart long ago)
(Burn all the bridges that have been
In my heart long ago)
(Burn all the bridges that have been
In my heart long ago)
(Burn all the bridges that have been
In my heart long ago)

Burn all the bridges that have been
In my heart long ago
You love someone but my heart
Isn't one that you chose
If I could say what was kept
Buried deep in my soul you would be mine
But I guess that's just how our lives go

(Burn all the bridges that have been
In my heart long ago)
(Burn all the bridges that have been
In my heart long ago)
(Burn all the bridges that have been
In my heart long ago)
(Burn all the bridges that have been
In my heart long ago)

Some days I'm fine but some
Days I just wanna forget
