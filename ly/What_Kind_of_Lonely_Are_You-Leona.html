		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I think we get creative with this
Feel like a child on their toes
Secrets spill right out of me
I want to feel more good things
And you're a good thing

I'm feeling myself, more than I've known
I'm feeling so much
More than I let on
I'm feeling biased
You, and what I'm used to
And I won't pry it out of you
Just to see, "what kind of lonely are you?"
I wanna pride in what I saw in you

I wanna be acquainted with this
Know everything, she let's me bend
And it's familiar, her on my skin
Say that I love her, and let her in

I'm feeling myself, more than I've known
I'm feeling so much
More than I let on
I'm feeling biased
You, and what I'm used to
And I won't pry it out of you
Just to see, "what kind of lonely are you?"
I wanna pride in what I saw in you

Feeling like the sun's in my chest
Losing all of this false pretense
Only to hold onto you
