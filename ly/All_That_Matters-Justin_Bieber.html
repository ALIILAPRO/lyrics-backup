		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, oh, just as sure as the stars in the sky
I need you to shine in my life
Not just for the meanwhile, for a long long time
Better believe it
Oh, oh, whenever you're not in my presence
It feels like I'm missing my blessings, yeah
So I sleep through the daylight, stay awake all night
'Til you're back again, oh yeah, yeah
You think I'm biased
To my significant other
You hit it right on the head
Only been missing my lover
Got a whole lotta texts in my phone and I don't reply
The next eight bars tell you why

You're all that matters to me, yeah, yeah
Ain't worried about nobody else
If I ain't with you, I'm not myself
You make me complete
You're all that matters to me, yeah, yeah
What's a king bed without a queen?
There ain't no "I" in team
You make me complete
You're all that matters to me

Take the gas out the car, it won't drive
That's how I feel when you're not by my side
When I wake up in the morning up under you and only you
Oh, oh, I'm grateful for your existence
Faithful, no matter the distance
You're the only girl I see
From the bottom of my heart, please believe

You're all that matters to me, yeah, yeah
Ain't worried about nobody else
If I ain't with you, I'm not myself
You make me complete
You're all that matters to me, yeah, yeah
What's a king bed without a queen?
There ain't no "I" in team
You make me complete
You're all that matters to me

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You're all that matters to me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You're all that matters to me
