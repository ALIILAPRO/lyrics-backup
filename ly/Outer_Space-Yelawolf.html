		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Kick me out the house?
Should kick your ass out the house
Call me a piece of shit? You're a piece of shit
Aw, come on
The fuck?
What the
The fuck is?
What the fuck? Aw fuck, hey!
Hey, hey, let me out!
Let me out!
This is not fuckin' funny!
Hey! Oh, oh fuck!
Oh shit, no!

Uh, uh, uh
One, two, uh

I am that motherfucker, Lord give me that deuce deuce
I'm out the roof like a chimney sweep, I'm on Jack and cola
Oh, snap that boy's about to go go pow pow, hold up
Dead at midnight, out like a convict
Trick I'm losing my shit, watch this
Throw a bottle, Fuck the world
I need fight tunes and mushrooms, I'm tripping
(Chicka Chicka) Who's bad?
Baby it's my turn
I want all of it, hey, let's go
Look at 'em hating on a trailer park pimp
Who? Me
It's a problem ain't it, man
You're fucking white, you better get used to it
Catfish Billy man
Check the 5-0, in the rear-view
Scheming on the Chevy 'cause the Chevy's a clear view
Tires wet, pulling me over with tattoos
I'm a pistol holder, an American fuck up
Money like a crook and I'm spending G's like I'm buying a soda
Check me out, CEO
Got pull like a monster truck so what's up
I earn my (shit), respect is a must
You fuck around with me (shit)
In the slug I trust
I got the Mossberg (shit)
Don't make me load that pump
James Brown motherfucker (shit)
I took her, I took her to the breakdown like this

Uh, uh, uh
Off the top, let's go!

Give me everything, take it all away
Lock me up and then throw away the key
Kick me down and then talk about my state
I'm not out of place, I'm from outer space
I'm not out of place, I'm from outer space
I'm not out of place, I'm from outer space

Give me everything, take it all away
Lock me up and then throw away the key
Kick me down and then talk about my state
I'm not out of place, I'm from outer space
I'm not out of place, I'm from outer space
I'm not out of place, I'm from outer space

Give me everything, take it all away
Lock me up and then throw away the key
Kick me down and then talk about my state
I'm not out of place, I'm from outer space
I'm not out of place, I'm from outer space
I'm not out of place, I'm from outer space

I'm not out of place, I'm from outer space
I'm not out of place, I'm from outer space

Give me everything, take it all away
Lock me up and then throw away the key
Kick me down and then talk about my state
I'm not out of place, I'm from outer space
I'm not out of place
