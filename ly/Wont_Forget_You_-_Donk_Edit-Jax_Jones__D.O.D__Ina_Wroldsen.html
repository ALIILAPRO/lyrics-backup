		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I won't forget you

You won't be lonely, I won't let you (ha, ha, ha, ha)
You won't be lonely, I won't forget you
(I won't forget you)

Stay with me, end of time
You're the constant in my life
Stay with me, no goodbyes
We can make it if we try

I won't forget you

Put your arms around me
I'll never let you go
Even when the dancing's done
You are not alone

Now my arms around you
Never say goodbye
Even when the lights are on
You will feel me right by your side

You won't be lonely, I won't let you
(You won't be lonely, I won't let you)
You won't be lonely, I won't forget you
(I won't forget you)

Stay with me, end of time
You're the constant in my life
Stay with me, no goodbyes
We can make it if we try

You won't be lonely, I won't let you
(You won't be lonely, I)
You won't be lonely, I won't forget you
(I won't forget you)

Stay with me, end of time
You're the constant in my life
Stay with me, no goodbyes
We can make it if we try

Never say good, go, go, alone
Never say good, never say good, go, go, alone
Never say good, never say good, go, go, alone
Never say good, never say good, go
(I won't forget you)
