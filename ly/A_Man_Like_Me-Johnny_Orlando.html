		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Innocent eyes look into mine
Baby, I see that you're falling up
It's gonna hurt when I let you down
It's not that I like to
Leave when it's right
But over and over again
I've only seen love that ends

Before you get too hurt
May I do it first?

I tried to warn you, I begged you to leave
But you tried to fix me, oh, don't be naive
You wanted somebody that I'll never be
But that's what you get
When your heart's in the hands of a man like me

Your tears hit the floor, like many before
From strangers to lovers to enemies
I wish I could be your remedy
I hate to say, "I told you so"
I'm not the type to get too close
I hope you learned your lesson
But you are no exception

Before you get to hurt
May I do it worse?
You know I'll do it worse

I tried to warn you, I begged you to leave
But you tried to fix me, oh, don't be naive
You wanted somebody that I'll never be
But that's what you get
When your heart's in the hands of a man like me

In the hands of a man like me
In the hands of a man like me
