		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Starting at the dawn of time, violence played its role
The male, the alpha, number one has controlled the tribe
Sticks and stones were used to kill, then moved on to blades of steel
Let the bodies lie, let the bloody bodies lie

Through the ages war sustained
Our final stand, unholy grail

Centuries, centuries of suffering
Centuries, centuries of blood

Weapons played a major part in the fall of those who fought
The evolution of the kill, more precision more refined

Desperate stages, chaos reigns
A worthless man, you die impaled

Centuries, centuries of suffering
Centuries, centuries of blood
Centuries, centuries of punishment
Centuries, centuries of suffering

What will be the final answer
Release the missile, drop the bombs
Mother earth lies devastated
Hallowed ground gets decimated

After all, every thing we do
As man evolves, so do the weapons used
Our world demise, centuries of suffering

Please tell me your final answer
Release the missile, drop the bombs
Mother earth lies devastated
Please no more
