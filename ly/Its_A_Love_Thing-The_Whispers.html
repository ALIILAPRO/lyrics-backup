		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's a love thing
It's a love thing
It's a love thing, thing

The look in your eyes
Is more than enough
To make my poor heart
Burst into flames

Knew from the moment we met 
That there was no doubt
That my life would never be the same

I could never hide the feelings 
That come over me
When you're near me 
I know that's how it's suppose to be 
My heart keeps telling me

It's a love thing, yeah 
Got me talkin' in my sleep 
About the love we made

It's a love thing
It's a love thing 
Love thing, yeah

Such a feeling I get
Whenever we touch 
Girl like no other 
I felt before 
It's still so new and yet 
I need you so much 
Got to make you mine
Forever more

You're the kinda woman 
That can turn my world around
Cause you show me what 
A selfish love is all about 
Without a doubt

It's a love thing
I feel that pounding in my heart
When you call my name 
It's a love thing

It's a love thing
Love thing, thing
It's a love thing

Every time that you're near
It becomes so clear
It's a love thing
It's a love thing
Love thing, yeah
