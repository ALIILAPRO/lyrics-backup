		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (DLo on the beat)

Yeah, got you a bag, a new Celine, is that okay with you?
I rock my jewelry when I sleep 'cause I got trustin' issues
And I had fucked you in my dreams right before I met you
I saw a cum stain on my sleeve, I left that hoodie with you
And I left cum stains on your jeans, yeah
Memories of me, ah
You say you wanna leave, ah
Just don't take anything

And you got hearts in your eyes
But I can tell that you've been with a lot of other guys
Look me in my face and you tell lies, you tell me lies
Niggas wanna take my chain but they not tryna die
Niggas I be with, they will leave you hospitalized
I don't go nowhere without my glove and my nine
I don't do no Percocets no more, I'm traumatized
I know my baby worried, I be clubbin' all the time
But you ain't even gotta worry, girl, 'cause you mine
You say I be in my bag, I ain't even in my prime
Rapping with melody, just like na, na-na-na
New Fashion Nova jeans got your thighs looking wide
You know what you're doing, baby, you're perfectly fine
Won't let nobody tell you that you thirsty, you're not
Even though them bitches used to curve me a lot
Even though them bitches used to curve, I spin the block (yeah)

Got you a bag, a new Celine, is that okay with you?
I rock my jewelry when I sleep 'cause I got trustin' issues
I had fucked you in my dreams right before I met you
I saw a cum stain on my sleeve, I left that hoodie with you
You got a cum stain on your jeans, ah
With a memory of me, ah
You say you wanna leave, ah
Just don't take anything

I won't leave you alone, on God, yeah, I promise, yeah
I'ma be down to the end, I'm being honest, yeah
Used to have Vans on my feet, now its Pradas, yeah
Use to shop at Target, now I'm racking up at Barneys, yeah
You can't bring sand to the beach, I brought a Barbie, yeah
I can put strings on a beat, I'm a guitarist, yeah
Adderall, Xans and the beans, you was on it, yeah
My niggas in the feds don't believe they belong in there
Don't you make a scene, its always something with you
I got my ratchet when I sleep 'cause I ain't fucking with you
I couldn't count all the receipts I got from fucking with you
And every time you look at me, I gotta tell you the truth

But if you wanna go
I know you don't wanna go
I know you think I'm a ho
Yeah, you know everything I do
But I don't wanna be alone
I don't really think you know
I hope, I just hope you know
That I don't want to leave you 'lone (I won't)

Got you a bag, a new Celine, is that okay with you?
I rock my jewelry when I sleep 'cause I got trustin' issues
And I had fucked you in my dreams right before I met you
I saw a cum stain on my sleeve, I left that hoodie with you
You got a cum stain on your jeans, ah
With a memory of me, ah
You say you wanna leave, ah
Just don't take anything
