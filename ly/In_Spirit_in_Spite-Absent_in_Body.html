		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  .in spirit in spite. 
All men unite. 
Plague god within. 
I'm shedding my skin. 
No love. 
Too much. 
Your touch. 
Enough. 
To have faith. 
Never too late. 
This body is bait. 
It is bait. 
I must and I will feed you with force. 
I must and I will poison the source the body lay still.
The cross on the hill I must and I will. 
Feed you with force. 
I must and I will poison the source. 
To bury all mine. 
The year of the swine and the fire calls. 
Put down. 
The misery of flesh. 
The mercy rule. 
Of a queen so cruel. 

.we all carry inside us the seeds of our own deaths. 
We will not surrender to threat. 
You conquered like cancer. 
The flag of defeat. 
You conquered like cancer. 
A beautiful dancer. 
The love of my life. 
The crowning disease. 
One more. 
One more moment to seize. 
And love has left my life. 
In everything. 
Anything. 
Who am I not to forgive you? 
Will I now outlive you? 
Will I see you again? 
Will I hear the slow beating of your wings? 
Seek solace in silence. 
Where I live and you will now forever hide. 
In spirit in spite. 
In heaven all our gods will unite. 
Am I worthy of your name? 
To carry the flame?
