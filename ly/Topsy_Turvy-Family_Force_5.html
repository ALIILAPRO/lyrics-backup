		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Maybe I'm crazy
What did I fall into
Lookin' for a key to a door that I can't get through
Just maybe
I'm crazy
Don't you know, don't you know I'm going under
Just maybe
In a world of wonder
Wonder

Topsy (topsy) turvy (turvy)
Wake me (wake me)
I've had enough
Topsy (topsy) turvy (turvy)
Don't know (don't know)
Which way is up
Or down
Tears on the ground
Whatever I'm dreamin' of
Topsy (topsy) turvy (turvy)
Wake me (wake me)
I've had enough

Talkin' to myself
What do I have to loose
Wish upon a star
Fell so far from the truth
Just maybe
I'm crazy
Don't you know, don't you know I'm going under
Just maybe
In a world of wonder
Wonder

Topsy (topsy) turvy (turvy)
Wake me (wake me)
I've had enough
Topsy (topsy) turvy (turvy)
Don't know (don't know)
Which way is up
Or down
Tears on the ground
Whatever I'm dreamin' of
Topsy (topsy) turvy (turvy)
Wake me (wake me)
I've had enough

I've lost my way
Hey
I want to come home
Someone take me away
Hey
I'm coming home

Topsy turvy
Wake me
I've had enough

Topsy (topsy) turvy (turvy)
Wake me (wake me)
I've had enough

Topsy (topsy) turvy (turvy)
Wake me (wake me)
I've had enough
Topsy (topsy) turvy (turvy)
Don't know (don't know)
Which way is up
Or down
Tears on the ground
Whatever I'm dreamin' of
Topsy (topsy) turvy (turvy)
Wake me (wake me)
I've had enough
