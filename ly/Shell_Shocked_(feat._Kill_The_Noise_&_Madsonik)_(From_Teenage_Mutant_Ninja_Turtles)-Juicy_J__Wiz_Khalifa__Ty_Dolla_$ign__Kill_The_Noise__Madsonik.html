		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Knock-knock, you about to get shell-shocked
Knock-knock, you about to get shell-shocked
Knock-knock, you about to get shell-shocked
Knock-knock, you about to get shell-shocked

That's my fam, I'll hold 'em down forever
Us against the world, we can battle whoever
Together, ain't no way we gon' fail
You know I got your back, just like a turtle shell
Nobody do it better
All my brothers tryna get some cheddar
We all want our cut like the Shredder
Me and my bros come together for the dough
Bought the orange Lamborghini, call it Michelangelo
With the nunchuck doors and I'm pullin' up slow
When we fall up in the party, they know anything goes
Check my Rolex, they say I'm the man of the hour
All this green in my pockets, you can call it turtle power

(All for one, we fight together)
Knock-knock, you about to get shell-shocked
(All for one, we ride together)
Knock-knock, you about to get shell-shocked
(All for one, we fight together)
Knock-knock, you about to get shell-shocked
(This family, we can bear any weather)
Knock-knock, you about to get shell-shocked

Uh ain't nothing that could come in between me and my brothers
We all around if it's going down
It's just us, all for one, yeah you hear 'em right
Our business done, we disappear into the night
Came up together, so we all down for the fight
Ain't nothing wrong with that
Family, ain't nothing strong as that
And I'll be posted up where the strong is at
Brothers by my side, city on my back, real heroes
That's what the people want
They ain't born, gotta create 'em
Sayin' we gone as soon as we save 'em
That's part of the plan
By my side I'ma keep my brothers
Live or die man we need each other, uh

(All for one, we fight together)
Knock-knock, you about to get shell-shocked
(All for one, we ride together)
Knock-knock, you about to get shell-shocked
(All for one, we fight together)
Knock-knock, you about to get shell-shocked
(This family, we can bear any weather)
Knock-knock, you about to get

Four hittas, four winners
Tryna tell 'em you don't wanna go to war with us
We be them, we be them (young riders)
Raised in the gutters, really started (from the bottom)
Hey, we all we ever had
We all we ever needed and we undefeated
We be goin' hard, and make it look easy
Gimme the whole pie, real cheesy
I told ya girl no, but you won't believe me
She takin' pics for me, told her smile for me
Pass her off, I'm a real team playa
Bandana on my face like a gangsta

Knock-knock, you about to get shell-shocked
Knock-knock, you about to get shell-shocked
Knock-knock, you about to get shell-shocked
Knock-knock, you about to get shell-shocked
