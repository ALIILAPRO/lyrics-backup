		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I kill myself in small amounts
In each relationship it's not about love
Just another funeral
And just another girl left in tears

And I'm waiting 
With the sound turned off, I'm waiting
Like a glass balloon, I'm fading
Into the void and then I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone

They said that hell's not hot
They said that hell's not hot

I gave my soul to someone else
She must have known that it was already sold
But it was never about her
It was about the hurt

So, I'm waiting
With the sound turned off, I'm waiting
Like a glass balloon, I'm fading
Into the void and then I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone

I kill myself in small amounts
In each relationship it's not about love
Just another funeral 
And just another girl left in tears

Waiting
With the sound turned off, I'm waiting
Like a glass balloon, I'm fading
Into the void and then I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone

Waiting
Waiting
I'm fading
I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone

They said that hell's not hot
They said that hell's not hot
They said that hell's not hot
They said that hell's not hot
