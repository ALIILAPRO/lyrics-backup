		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Where the girls are young and down
And hot as fuck
Where they're dancing in the streets
With nothing on

Drivin' all night, lost track of time
All these lonely roads aren't how
They used to feel
Big dreams in our eyes, carefree
Yet so blind
Been afraid of anything that's real
Watch the sunset through highway fields
(Highway fields)
If I could go back then I'd stay there
(I'd stay there)
Just us wrapped up in the Autumn air
(In the Autumn air)
Act like I don't but I'll always care
(I'll always care) oh babe, I'm gon' go

Where the girls are young and down
And hot as fuck
Whеre they're dancing in thе streets
With nothing on
We'll drive your car to the beach
With this song on repeat you showed me
We'll drive your car to the beach
With this song on repeat oh, baby

Stood on the edge we never said
Anything that felt too honest
In the backseat kicked off your Nikes
My hand in your jacket pocket but
Some love just lasts a season
It gets fucked up for no good reason (oooh)
Been trying to find the feeling that we had
Let's go back no one has to know
Just want to go

Where the girls are young and down
And hot as fuck
Where they're dancing in the streets
With nothing on
We'll drive your car to the beach
With this song on repeat you showed me
We'll drive your car to the beach
With this song on repeat oh, baby
