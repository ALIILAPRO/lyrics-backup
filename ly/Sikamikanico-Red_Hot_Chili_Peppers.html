		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everybody knows about Hollywood skunks
Soulfull sex and funky monks
My tencil town is made of steel
Let's whimp, let's shout, let's make a deal !

Hollywood and Hollywood not
We are so lively on the spot
Feel so alive, don't know where to stop
Are you def or dumb or what?!

Silly little creature, Sikamikanico
Sittin' on a bleature, Sikamikanico
I don't want a teacher, Sikamikanico
If we're gonna reach ya, Sikamikanico
Don't you know 'bout Frank Sinatra
That's all gone because I got up
We don't just play, we display
Gotta give it up, gotta do it my way

Shootin' my sex upto the cave
You might receive my radio wave
Shake it girl, you won't get hurt
I knock my dick into the dirt

Silly little creature, Sikamikanico
Sittin' on a bleature, Sikamikanico
I don't want a teacher, Sikamikanico
If we're gonna reach ya, Sikamikanico

Anybody want some, Sikamikanico
Everybody on the run, Sikamikanico
Rock it more breeza, Sikamikanico
If we're gonna treasure, Sikamikanico

Hey, Ho, Let's go
Mother Fucker, want to be a jigolo
Let me demolo how it goes
Under ho sittin on my big toe
Hey Joe, a radio chump
I'll never gonna overcome in Hollywood, I'll come alone
Oh no, it would now leave my nose that you blow
Hey ho, let's go

So big boy say you want bad news
We doubt our mama's been confused
It's plain to see we rock the groove
If you don't like it, time to move

And all the press, you don't amaze me
I'm not your dick so don't appraise me
Never gonna fit your critical shit
You better watch out, you might get hit

Silly little creature, Sikamikanico
Sittin' on a bleature, Sikamikanico
I don't want a teacher, Sikamikanico
If we're gonna reach ya, Sikamikanico

Anybody want some, Sikamikanico
Everybody on the run, Sikamikanico
Rock it more breeza, Sikamikanico
If we're gonna treasure, Sikamikanico
