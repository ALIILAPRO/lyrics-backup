		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Once two souls had such grand goals
Innocent, so impotent, no hands in control
Dear friends, always side-by-side
With dreams of being glorified as ironsides
New - in need of something new
Designing a great breakthrough
Finally fate-construed in you
Fun - none other's quite as fun
We'll rise above everyone
When every deed is done, begun

Sinister as the end draws nearer
Typical of the ones in fear
Morality will burn and wither
Tragedy is drawn to the bitter
Drawn to the bitter, drawn, drawn to the bitter
Tragedy is drawn to the bitter
Drawn to the bitter, drawn, drawn to the bitter
Tragedy is drawn to the bitter

Not a simple dream at all
Left and right, a sacrifice, tethered by resolve
Guiltless passion, lifetime spellbound
Fredbear's Diner, children's playground
Last - finally thriving at last
Odds are surely unsurpassed
We endured the trials and passed, steadfast
Strife - at last, after all our strife
The loss of a precious life
A part of me died inside that night

Sinister as the end draws nearer
Typical of the ones in fear
Morality will burn and wither
Tragedy is drawn to the bitter
Drawn to the bitter, drawn, drawn to the bitter
Tragedy is drawn to the bitter
Drawn to the bitter, drawn, drawn to the bitter
Tragedy is drawn to the bitter
Sinister, now the end is here
Critical, innocent die here
Justice fails, it shakes and shivers
Tragedy is drawn to the bitter
