		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I could have fucked her for days
But thinking about it, maybe I just thrive on the chase
And I'm in lust

And you 
Never take time to look through
Everything I try
Try to do for you

And you, you, you 
Need to prove, prove, prove you're in it
And let go of 
Every fear you had

Lay low, lay low, she knows, she knows
Blow white straight to my brain
Works best when she's complaining, ooh, ooh
And I said give me a break, I'm only human

Fucked with too many petty bitches, ain't got time for this shit
Those peasant pussies probably took it, but you'll take what you get
I know, I know it's supposed to be give and take
It's just a show, and I'm the one that takes the blame

Don't stop faking
My conscience ain't afraid of you yet
And if your soul's still fading
I'm done contemplating with it

You're not a victim of shit
I put myself on the back burner
Held myself back for you
I'm a disposable fix
I'm only stating the facts for you
Now I got nothing to lose
