		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Most of my life
I sat on my hands, I don't make a sound
Getting it right
I made all my plans, lost, never found
Your eyes, your smile can light up the night, night
Embers and neon signs paint up our sky, sky

Airplanes cut through the clouds
Like angels can fly, we'll never die
Sirens cut through the night
Like screams that are fire, rising up high
Like I've something to prove, nothing to lose
In this city, in this city, oh

Woah
Oh! Oh!

All of this time
I questioned myself, I never could wait
Looking for signs
Not asking for help, I know it's too late
A love lost and buried here, it comes to life, life
Make believe worlds make us all feel alive, live

Airplanes cut through the clouds
Like angels can fly, we'll never die
Sirens cut through the night
Like screams that are fire, rising up high
Like I've something to prove, nothing to lose
In this city, in this city oh

I never wanna wait for this
Harder that I was made for this
I won't fade into dark
I'm not gonna say that I'm sorry
Gonna see the end of this story
I won't fade into darkness

Airplanes cut through the clouds
Like angels can fly, we'll never die
Sirens cut through the night
Like screams that are fire, rising up high
Like I've something to prove, nothing to lose
In this city, in this city oh

Woah
Oh! Oh!

Woah
Oh! Oh!
