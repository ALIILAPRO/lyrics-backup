		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I will murder you 
I don't want to 
But I will punish you, if I have to 
I don't fuck with you 
Cause your vibe is wrong, and it fucks with me 
I don't play games 
So you never know, never never know 
You won't touch a bow till I'm touchin you 
If I lose control I'll start shooting you 
Till you like no no nooo 

I will murder you 
I don't want to 
But u'll start to lose 
Can't escape you 
Nigga we can go 
We can keep it low 
So everybody else don't have to know 

Another scrub shot down 
A scrub shot down 
Another scrub shot down 
A scrub shot down 
Another scrub shot down 
A scrub shot down 
Another scrub shot down 
A scrub shot down 
You lose, I'll do youuu 

Take a drink, ahhh, 
I can't drain myself and still keep it cool 
So I keep in mind do it on my own 
Show up at your home, in the danger zone 
How many times must I tell you before I finnaly got you 
You fool, I'll do you 

I just murdered you, cuz I wanted to 
Cuz you had to go, that's just how I move 
I won't waste no time, I will take your life 
Nigga take this nine, here is the finish line 

Another scrub shot down 
A scrub shot down 
Another scrub shot down 
A scrub shot down 
Another scrub shot down 
A scrub shot down 
Another scrub shot down 
A scrub shot down 
You lose, I'll do you
