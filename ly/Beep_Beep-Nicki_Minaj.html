		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Murda on the beat so it's not nice)

Ayy, yo
I drop a bag on a Rolls with the temp' tags
My niggas locked scammin' money off they Penpals
I know a bitch bust it open in the club
Introduce you to the plug
Ten plates feel like ten cash
I got the call, told him, "Meet me in the backstreet"
Got out the Jeep just to fuck him in the backseat
I'm not impressed, I say, "Yo, the D mad weak"
Hit my niggas up, I got him robbed and that ass beat
I told him marry, heavy chain, of a lifetime
Who wanna be a millionaire? I'm your lifeline
These bitches only checkin' for me when the lights on
Niggas always frontin' when they only did some light time
Beep, beep, beep, is that bleep?
Is that you talkin' to me? It's that deep?
If I don't even know you exist, is that beef?
When niggas get their jaw broke, wait, is that teeth?

Murder, murder, murder, murder (mm)
Murder, murder, murder, murder (mm)
Murder, murder, murder, murder (mm)
Murder, murder, murder, murder

Wait, is that teeth?
