		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tired and confused
Are you running from the west
Heart and and soul abused
Does your mind need a rest

I wouldn't cry, it might make a flood
And I don't know if I can swim that good
I wouldn't cry, it might make a flood
And I don't know if I can swim that good

I've been lonely, only
When I stop to think about you
So I don't stop, just keep on
Trying to keep my head above these blues

Down there in Rome
We're longing to go home
The last train has gone
The last bird has flown away

I wouldn't cry, it might make a flood
And I don't know if I can swim that good
I wouldn't cry, it might make a flood
And I don't know if I can swim that good

I've been lonely, only
When I stop to think about you
So I don't stop, just keep on
Trying to keep my head above these blues

I've been a fool and I've been a loser
I play it cool and I won't blow a fuse
I've been a fool and I've been a loser
Oh, not this time

I've been lonely, only
When I stop to think about you
So I don't stop, just keep on, yeah
Trying to keep my head above these blues

I've been lonely, oh only
When I stop to think about you
So I don't stop, just keep on
Trying to keep my head above these blues
