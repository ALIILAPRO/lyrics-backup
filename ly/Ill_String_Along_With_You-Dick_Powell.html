		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All my life I've waited for an angel
But no angel ever came along
Then one happy afternoon I met you
And my heart began to sing a song
Somehow, I mistook you for an angel
But now I'm glad that I was wrong

You may not be an angel
'Cause angels are so few
But until the day that one comes along
I'll string along with you

I'm looking for an angel
To sing my love song to
And until the day that one comes along
I'll sing my song to you

For every little fault that you have
Say, I've got three or four
The human little faults you do have
Just make me love you more

You may not be an angel
But still I'm sure you'll do
So until the day that one comes along
I'll string along with you

For every little fault that you have
Say, I've got three or four
The human little faults you do have, honey
Just make me love you more

You may not be an angel
But still I'm sure you'll do
So until the day that one comes along
I'll string along with you
