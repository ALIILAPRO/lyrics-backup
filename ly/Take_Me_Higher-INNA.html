		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Higher, higher, higher
Higher, higher, higher
Take me higher, higher, higher
Higher, higher, higher

Do you remember that summer we had it all
We spent our days in the ocean, under the sun
And when the night time was over we'd just begun
You don't know what's forgotten until it's gone
I know that we, we were on in a moment
How could this be, a woman
I should be free, but you know that I want you
Don't let me dance with myself all night long

You take me on, take me on, to the ceiling
Higher with every touch
You turn me on, turn me on, can you feel it?
I wanna be in love

Take me higher, higher, higher
Higher, higher, higher
Take me higher, higher, higher
Higher, higher, higher

Do you remember that summer we had it all
We spent our days in the ocean, under the sun
And when the night time was over we'd just begun
You don't know what's forgotten until it's gone
I know that we, we were on in a moment
How could this be, a woman
I should be free, but you know that I want you
Don't let me dance with myself all night long

You take me on, take me on, to the ceiling
Higher with every touch
You turn me on, turn me on, can you feel it?
I wanna be in love

Take me higher, higher, higher
Higher, higher, higher
Take me higher, higher, higher
Higher, higher, higher
