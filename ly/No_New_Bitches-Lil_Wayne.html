		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Wheezy outta here)

I can't believe you just swallowed a family
You tell me that pussy is my property
But I'm 'bout to leave it with property damage
And please do not go fuck the opp if I vanish
She sleep in my robe, that Versace, that's fancy
I'm sweet in her throat, her esophagus candy
Treat me like Mentos, got me jolly as ranchers

Girl, I got news for you
That man can't do what I do for you
I keep control on cruise so cool for you
Keep these hoes on snooze, no snooze button
I keep my focus on you, do the moves for me
Move with it
I get lost in it like a new city
Leave your drawers with me like a souvenir
I went long in it ain't no two minutes
I'ma ball in it, I'ma hoop in it

I don't talk shit, I keep my two pennies
I don't want shit unless you give it
No new bitches unless you kiss 'em
No-no new bitches unless you kiss 'em
No new bitches unless you kiss 'em
If I don't know shit, I know what to do with it
Lil mama you the shit, number two with it

I can't believe you just swallowed a family
You tell me that pussy is my property
But I'm 'bout to leave it with property damage
And please do not go fuck the opp if I vanish
She sleep in my robe, that Versace, that's fancy
I'm sweet in her throat, her esophagus candy
Treat me like Mentos, got me jolly as ranchers

Pop that pussy for a real nigga
I'ma pop that pussy like a pill, nigga
Tylenol PM, Advil, nigga
Make her drop that pussy like a spill, nigga
And I'ma mop that pussy like a spill, nigga
And I'ma cop, that pussy like to steal, nigga
And I'ma rock that pussy like Aaliyah nigga
And I'ma shock that pussy 'cause I'm ill, nigga (Wheezy outta here)
Make the pussy lips whisper in my ear, nigga
Making fuck faces ugly like Seal, nigga
Got a rubber on like a Richard Mille, nigga
Make her pop that pussy like a hair trigger
Bop-bop-bop that pussy like a snare, nigga
Got her legs bust open in the chair, nigga
Pussy so pink it look medium rare, nigga

I don't talk shit, I keep my two pennies
I don't want shit unless you give it
No new bitches unless you kiss 'em
No-no new bitches unless you kiss 'em
No new bitches unless you kiss 'em
If I don't know shit, I know what to do with it
Lil mama you the shit, number two with it

I can't believe you just swallowed a family
You tell me that pussy is my property
But I'm 'bout to leave it with property damage
And please do not go fuck the opp if I vanish
She sleep in my robe, that Versace, that's fancy
I'm sweet in her throat, her esophagus candy
Treat me like Mentos, got me jolly as ranchers
