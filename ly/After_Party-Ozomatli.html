		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wonder if we'll ever find a party that lasts all night.
There's a vibe in the city I've never felt before in my life.
Let's all rush and flow, make a big time aftershow party.
If we're gonna get it right got to hold each other tight tonight

And the people of the world say...
Oye Baby 
Oye Mami 
Donde Esta La After party

You offered a ride, a pleasant surprise
Your whip was on point but it couldn't outshine your eyes
Now I really know why we had to rush the flow darling
No we gotta get it right got to hold each other tight tonight

And the people of the world say...
Oye Baby 
Oye Mami 
Donde Esta La After party

I only want to hold your hand like darkness in the moon light And when you wrap your arms around me I know this is where we should be tonight

To feel this gotta use your soul
And it just ain't a party with no O-Z-O's
Jump back make you sweat your clothes 
And I bet you didn't know/ the whole band got flows
Little lady go on and do your dance
Homeboys stand up and shout
That's what I'm talkin' bout
Everybody go on and tell a friend
That band went and did it again
