		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's kinda bugged how I go sometimes 
Know they staring brain feels like a wheel lost with out the ball bearing 
Stuck contemplating on who I can trust 
But like lleullo in a bill my feelings just get crushed 
But that's why I stick with my duns like I stick with the guns 
Don't get mad rip your hun concentrate on my funds 
Lift heavy gats concealed by my waist 
Never get patted down when I step in the place 

Jiggied up, smoke the pot, confirm if it is real reefer or not 
Rally up, after this get followed straight to the crib 
Gem Star, double edge apply pressure 
Shave em down, blow marks right through your mecca 
want to be a thug, now you got the thug look, 
Stick em up, leave medicaid, with the real to push 
God body, with a rubber grip black shotti 
Pump one in his ass make that nigga switch hobbies 

A dossage, hand delivered, without postage 
Bring it to your door step quick on short notice 
Niggas get sniped like, Klonker Brockite 
Show em how to rock right, when bitches hold the mic, street life 

Why you have to raise me this way, You showed me how to survive the 
concrete, If I survive only time can say, You where a part of me

Why you have to raise me this way, You showed me how to survive the 
concrete, If I survive only time can say, You where a part of me

This is something you feel nigga, like the theme song from Hill Street Blues 
This is real, this is ill street news 
How he gone, and left his moms mind struck 
Now his brother ain't giving a fuck 
Little sister giving up the butt now, Dun don't wet that 
I want you to rest black, cause you better belive Noyd gon handle that 
'Cause when I get em, I'm gonna have em 
Pull out the sweeper, and spray it at them 

I ain't no killer, you know me 
But I'll be damned if I don't lie for my C-O-D 
And then this Old G, scold me and told me coldly 
You keep it up and you will be dead like your homey 
But I gotta redeem, get this cream by any means 
I never been clean 
Nigga, my whole click got dirty 
From the battles, to the trials and bloody up shirtsleeves 
Nigga you heard me, its gangsta 

Vision the canvas I paint a picture 
Similar to Ernies Barnes nigga 
But mines is more ghetto more guns more drugs, mostly thugs 
All my duns, their baby moms daughter and sons 
Dark blocks, with streets lamps shot the fuck out 
Park benches broke, a nigga stretched out 
Jumped off the roof to his death its real 
Hand Ball walls displayed with are I-P murials 
Those who sling, play the shadows by the building 
Devils spring, keep em going while the snows blowing 

Grams get dipped, 50's are moked, cookies are broke 
And spliced in large pieces for the fiends to smoke 
The sun set looks beautiful over the projects 
What a shame, its ain't the same where we stand at 
If you look close you can see the bricks chipped off 
Sometimes niggas miss when they lick off don't get clipped off 
Street life 

Why you have to raise me this way, You showed me how to survive the 
concrete, If I survive only time can say, You where a part of me

Why you have to raise me this way, You showed me how to survive the 
concrete, If I survive only time can say, You where a part of me
