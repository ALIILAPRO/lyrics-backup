		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Set two plates in an empty room
We woke up to what's lost too soon
Just a taste of what's left of us
Me and you
Take your glass and we fill it up
Some remorse in a coffee cup
Starin' into the bottom of this hopeless love

We thought for sure we had it all
But look at the two of us now

Just a table of fools, running around in circles
Unable to move, trying to find our first doors
Let's start over, even though we're nowhere
Turn this table of fools into another new

All the words I'm supposed to say
Stuck inside, they can find their way
Telling you, it will be okay
Kept repeating them every day

We thought for sure we had it all
But look at the two of us now

Just a table of fools, running around in circles
Unable to move, trying to find our first doors
Let's start over, even though we're nowhere
Turn this table of fools into another new

Like a song playing on repeat
Dancing around to the same beat
We both lost, but not ready to let go

Just a table of fools, running around in circles
Unable to move, trying to find our first doors
Let's start over, even though we're nowhere
Turn this table of fools into another new
Turn this table of fools into another new
