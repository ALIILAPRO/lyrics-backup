		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Say hello, who are you?
And we'll start from scratch again
Gotta go, talk to you soon
Day by day, I'm fading away

We get along just fine
I say everything you like to hear
It's funny how much I
Feel like I'm looking in a mirror

I can't remember who I am
Everything's a blur
Take me over

I'll become what you like
This is what you've wanted, right?
Sacrifice all I know
I will teach myself to let go

Copy that, copycat
Copy that, copycat

Say "Hello, what's up with you?"
I'm starting to talk like you do
Here we go, I'll be gone soon
Day by day, everything has changed

We've grown apart this time
I can't figure out the reason why
It's funny how much I'd
Kinda like to see you cry

I can't remember who I am
Everything's a blur
Take me over

I've become what you like
I am what you've wanted, right?
Sacrificed all I've known
I have taught myself to let go

Copy that, copycat
Copy that, copycat
Copy that, copycat
Copy that, copycat

(Copy that, copycat)
(Copy that, copycat)

I can't remember who I am
Everything's a blur
Take me over

I'll become what you like
This is what you've wanted right?
Sacrifice all I know
I will teach myself to let go

(Woah, woah)
Copy that, copycat
(Woah, woah)
Copy that, copycat
(Woah, woah)
Copy that, copycat
(Woah, woah)
Copy that, copycat
(Woah, woah)
Copy that, copycat
(Woah, woah)
Copy that, copycat
