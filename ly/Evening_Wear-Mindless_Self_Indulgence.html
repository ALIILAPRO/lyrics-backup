		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is my vindication
With a little decoration
No need to keep you waitin'
Be intimidated
By what we have created
Kiss underneath the radar

[Chorus]
I got myself a fuckin' life
Dressed up in evening wear
I dress myself in fuckin' lies
I don't care
Make-up won't help me oblige too much
It's not fair
To be compared to you [Repeat x2]
To be compared to

Just call me "Mr. Modest"
I got it and I flaunt it
You can applaud if you wanna
Cock-blockin' non-stoppin'
When this ass is a-rockin'
Do not come a knockin' 

[Chorus]

Everybody wants to join the club
Once you join the club, the innocence is gone
Everybody wants to be the bomb
But once you are the bomb, the innocence is gone
Everybody wants a big ol' slice
Of a little pie, the innocence is gone
Everybody wants in [Repeat x2]
Everybody wants

I got myself a fuckin' life
Dressed up in evening wear
I dress myself in fuckin' lies
Guess what?
I don't care
Make-up won't help me oblige too much
It's not fair
Dressed down until I disappear
But I won't do it alone
No I won't do it alone
Oh I won't do it alone
