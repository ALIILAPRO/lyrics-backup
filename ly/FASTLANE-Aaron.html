		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sixty seconds maybe
Is good enough
To cast out of beauty
This golden calf
Sitting in the corner
This is my place
Just like in the movies
My back's safe

Striking as the thunder
You've blown me
Steady, ready, fire
Just fire please
This room's filled with answers
Brightly smoking
Us two, broken flowers
In god's hand

Look what we're not
We drove down the fast lane
Two guns, just one shot
We drove down the fast lane

You used to keep me grounded
I watch the shore of his nape
Flared by the light
All I got are my keys to hold tight
Sharpening out your new fangs
You bit me strong
With words colder than this
October evening
Pull the triggered omen
You know my spots
My silver tongue has no keys
To close doors
This room is filled with the answers
Bloody as wine
To mark the lips of time

See what we're not
We drove down the fast lane
Two guns, just one shot
Us blown on the fast lane

You used to keep me grounded
While we drove down
We drove down the fast lane
Two birds, just one shot
Why we drove down
We drove down the fast lane
You used to keep me grounded
