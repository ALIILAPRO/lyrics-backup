		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You got the tenderness that I been searching for
Oh, I want some more (alright)
You got sweet lips like I did never taste before
Oh, I want some more

Everything you've got
Is just what I've always wanted
Right down to a T
Nothin' about you that don't please me

I'm just a kid and you're a walkin' candy store
Oh, I want some more

You got the tenderness that I been searching for
Oh, I want some more, yeah
You got sweet lips like I did never taste before
Oh, I want some more

Everything you've got
Is just what I've always wanted
Right down to a T
Nothin' about you that don't please me

I'm just a kid and you're a walkin' candy store
Oh, I want some more, yeah, yeah
