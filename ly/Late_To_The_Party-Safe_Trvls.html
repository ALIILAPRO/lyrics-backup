		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Please don't call me in the morning
It's way too early for that
I thought I told you I was on one
And I might never come back
We mixin' liquor with the soda
I need some ice in my glass
I thought I told you I was on one
And I might never come back
If you see it then you know it
And Imma drink it if you pour it
I'm not a singer I'm a poet
And if you feel it you know (Oh ohh)
So I, move through the city like a thief in the night
Told my baby that I really needa see you tonight
I needa see you tonight
Please don't call me in the morning
It's way too early for that
I thought I told you I was on one
And I might never come back
We mixin' liquor with the soda
I need some ice in my glass
I thought I told you I was on one
And I might never come back
I've been out the way I'm sorry
I think I'll be late to the party
I said please don't text or call me
Isn't it obvious?
Isn't it obvious, I said
Please don't call me in the morning
It's way too early for that
I thought I told you I was on one
And I might never come back
We mixing liquor with the soda
I need some ice in my glass
I thought I told you I was on one
And I might never come back
