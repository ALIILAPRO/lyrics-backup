		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sittin' here eatin' my heart out waitin'
Waitin' for some lover to call
Dialed about a thousand numbers lately
Almost rang the phone off the wall

Lookin' for some hot stuff, baby, this evenin'
I need some hot stuff, baby, tonight
I want some hot stuff, baby, this evenin'
Gotta have some hot stuff
Gotta have some love tonight

Hot stuff
(Baby, baby)
(Baby, baby, tonight)
I need hot stuff
(Baby, baby)
(Baby, baby, tonight)
I want some hot stuff
(Baby, baby)
(Baby, baby, tonight)
I need hot stuff
(Baby, baby)
(Baby, baby, tonight)

Baby, baby
Baby, baby, tonight
Baby, baby
Baby, baby, tonight
Baby, baby
Baby, baby, tonight
Baby, baby
Baby, baby, tonight

Lookin' for a lover who needs another
Don't want another night on my own
Wanna share my love with a warm-blooded lover
Wanna bring a wild man back home

Gotta have some hot love, baby, this evenin'
I need some hot stuff, baby, tonight
I want some hot stuff, baby, this evenin'
Gotta have some lovin'
Got to have love tonight

Hot stuff
(Baby, baby)
(Baby, baby, tonight)
I need hot stuff
(Baby, baby)
(Baby, baby, tonight)
I want some hot stuff
(Baby, baby)
(Baby, baby, tonight)
I need hot stuff
(Baby, baby)
(Baby, baby, tonight)
Lookin' for some hot stuff
Baby, baby
Baby, baby, tonight
I need hot stuff
Baby, baby
Baby, baby, tonight
Lookin' for some hot stuff
Baby, baby
Baby, baby, tonight
I need hot stuff
Baby, baby
Baby, baby, tonight
