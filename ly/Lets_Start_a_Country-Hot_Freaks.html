		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Live out on an island 
Don’t eat anything with eyes and 
Since i’ve never seen a carrot move
At least not of its own behalf
Spend the whole afternoon 
Thinking what i’m making you
Nothing ever going ever going wrong / Living in a vacuum
1 2 3 let’s start a country
1 2 3 just you and me
1 2 3 let’s start a country
How do you do that? How do you do that?

Could you do some of the legwork? 
Like filling out the forms and stuff
Because i’m a little busy / Thinking what i’m making you
Tonight its donut casserole
Tomorrow morning: donuts plain
Cause i know we both love donuts baby / Yeah that’s what i’m saying
We both know who the victim is here
When we disappear we won’t reappear
1 2 3 let’s start a country
1 2 3 just you and me
1 2 3 let’s start a country
How do you do that? How do you do that?

So i did a little research / Up late on this website
Turns out you can’t just do this type of thing
In fact it's kind of regulated
Cause everybody wants to get away
But no one ever does
They just get used to B.S.
Lets not let that happen to us
We both know who the victim is here
When we disappear we won’t reappear 
1 2 3 let’s start a country
1 2 3 just you and me
1 2 3 let’s start a country
How do you do that? How do you do that?
