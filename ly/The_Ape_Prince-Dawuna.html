		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Behind the wall
We take what we want
We're all dying, you know
So we might as well be happy

Behind the wall,
whispers the snake Nubunu,
He's lying, you know
That he wants you to be happy, yo

Take what you want, Do what you feel
(How long I been here?)
It's You who decides That which is real
(Who knows now I want to leave)

Some day I will

Behind the Wall
The ape run amok
The Lion and Gull
Beg their friend to calm his hunger

The fire in him threatens the flower gardens
The quiet and dim spaces
escape back to the sea

Escape body-mind
Break body-mind
Escape body-mind
One breath at a time

I'll sublime and peak over that

I wanna know all the world from me they've hidden
My eyes wanna see all the jewels of possibility
"I'll climb the Wall" Ape runs to tell his comrades.
"You try, you'll fall" Lion and Gull say unamused.
A man deserves all that his heart desires.
A child preserves that which will give him what he needs

"Just take heed or you'll meet your demise on that wall, no need to see the sea"
"Rise just to fall, Ape, can't you just feel ease, besides you've"
"Chased all the fawn and smoked all the trees they've--"
"Breazed past the wall and fled to the sea there."
"Fine, take your snake, rucksack and leave you..."
"Can't be convinced you've been deceived by him."

Providence
Silly ape, Silly
Love's all he needed all along.
