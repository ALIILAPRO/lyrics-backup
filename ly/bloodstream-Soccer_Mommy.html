		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Remembering running through my yard like a wild stream
Just a little kid, blood flowing into my rosy cheeks
Now a river runs red from my knuckles into the sink
And there's a pale girl starin' through the mirror at me
Maybe it's just a dream, wish I could go back to sleep

Hydrangeas bloomin' off the branches of park trees
It's a half-hearted calm, the way I've felt since I was thirteen
'Cause I may not feel it now, covered up the wounds with my long sleeves
But I know it's waiting there, swimming through my bloodstream

Happiness is like a firefly
On summer evenings
Feel it slippin' through my fingers
But I can't catch it in my hands

But I don't feel anything, I don't feel anything

What did you have that I didn't?
And why am I so fucked?
There's someone talking in my forehead
That says I'll never be enough
And happiness is like a firefly
On summer evenings
Feel it slippin' through my fingers
But I can't catch it in my hands
Catch it in my
