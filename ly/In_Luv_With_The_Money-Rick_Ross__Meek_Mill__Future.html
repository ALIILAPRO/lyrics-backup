		  Bossed up
It's Too Good To Be True
The biggest
Huh

I'm in love with my money
I'm in love (I'm in love, yeah), I'm in love (I'm in love)
I'm in love with my money (for real)
I'm in love (I fell in love), I'm in love (I'm in love)
I'm in love with my money 
I'm in love (I'm in love), I'm in love (I'm in love)
I'm in love with my money (for real)
I'm in love (I'm in love), I'm in love (I'm in love)
I'm in love with my money

How you niggas wanna play this, we can keep it basic
Killin' witnesses while out on bond and we beat the cases
Build the condo right on Collins, but can't become complacent
I'm the richest in the genre, and all my leaf is flagrant
Every day I'm livin' larger, that can't be debated
I got criminals and partners and all our secrets sacred
I got bitches like they bottles when I be out in Vegas (uh)
Ten million worth in diamonds, I feel so amazing (woo)
Garage full of muscle cars, it's like I'm Vin Diesel (boss)
How the fuck he was your boss when he didn't feed you? (How the fuck?)
Robert Smith numbers, Byron Allen hustle
Ricky Ross results, I need a big number (woo)

I'm in love with my money
I'm in love (I fell in love), I'm in love (I fell in love)
I'm in love with my money (for real)
I'm in love (I'm in love), I'm in love (I'm in love)
I'm in love with my money
I'm in love (I'm in love), I'm in love (I'm in love)
I'm in love with my money (for real)
I'm in love (I'm in love, huh), I'm in love (I'm in love)
I'm in love with my money 

Cauliflower the smoke, livin' like I was Sosa
Now it's slippery soap, on the shelf and your gross
I consistently post, goin' live from my sofa
Lamborghinis and bitches, ain't no need for no chauffeurs
Niggas wanna do dishes, better give me some distance (uh)
I'ma do you so dirty (ooh), can't believe that I did this (ooh)
Gucci luggage, I'm pimpin' (ooh), trust me, nigga, this pimpin' (ooh)
I bought all the new straps (huh), John Wick with the extensions (yes)
You want facts or the fiction (facts), hundred million I spend it (facts)
On the crib, it's a privilege (ooh), yeah, my jet is for business (ooh)
Double M is expensive (ooh), every brick is expensive (ooh)
I'ma end with this sentence (huh), let my dogs out the kennels

I'm in love with my money
I'm in love (I'm in love), I'm in love (I'm in love)
I'm in love with my money (for real)
I'm in love (I'm in love), I'm in love (I'm in love)
I'm in love with my money 
I'm in love (I'm in love), I'm in love (I'm in love)
I'm in love with my money (for real)
I'm in love (I fell in love), I'm in love (I fell in love)
I'm in love with my money
