		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You can't cut me loose until you show me
I told you the truth about the old me
And now you use confession as the proof
Do what you have to do
Go ahead and act the fool

What if in the end
You want so bad to forgive
But you cannot forget

So (so tied up)
We've been here before
So (so tied up)
You want something more
Lover, best friend, my worst enemy
You know I won't let you get away

I get you to swerve right outta fast lane
You still got champagne running through your veins
You dare me to step up and challenge you
Neither one of us can stand to lose
Stand to lose

Remember we said it'd be like after the rain
Washes away our sins
They never said that love is a twisted game
And no one ever wins

So (so tied up)
We've been here before
So (so tied up)
You want something more
Lover, best friend, my worst enemy
You know I won't let you get away

So so, so tied up
So, so, so, so tied up
So so, so tied up
So, so, so, so tied up

You threw me a rope
Opposites attract
I'm self absorbed and you're superficial
We round each other up
Being true to yourself could never be enough

(So so, so tied up)
I tried to let go
(So, so, so, so tied up)
We've been here before
Lover, best friend, my worst enemy
You know I won't let you get away

So tied up
So tied up
So tied up
So tied up
