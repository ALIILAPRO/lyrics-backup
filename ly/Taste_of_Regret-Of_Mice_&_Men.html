		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're wretched
Spewing venom
In every single lie that you tell

Feigning all emotion
When facing the consequence
Of your own personal hell

And there's no angel left to blame

When the devil on your shoulder
Who made you bolder
Is the one laughing in your face

What goes around comes around someday

And every time I think about the words you've said
I'm reminded just to bite my tongue instead
Until every last lyric's left covered in red
Because the taste of blood
Is better than the taste, better than the taste of regret

So while you're spitting into the hurricane
Trying to get rid of the bitterness

The acid from your tongue
Begins to erode again
While you sit and reminisce

So deep inside your own abyss

There is no feeling of misery
Like living in history
When you've been so poisonous

Karma comes back to sink it's fangs right in your neck

And every time I think about the words you've said
I'm reminded just to bite my tongue instead
Until every last lyric's left covered in red
Because the taste of blood
Is better than the taste, better than the taste of regret

Nothing can change the past, no
And time can't and won't unshatter the glass

What goes around comes around someday

And every time I think about the words you've said
I'm reminded just to bite my tongue instead
Until every last lyric's left covered in red
Because the taste of blood
Is better than the taste, better than the taste of regret
