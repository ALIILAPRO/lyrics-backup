		<p>
		  Oh

Oh ma how you be
Oh boo it's something bout cha I just wanna know 
And it's up to me
To give it to you till you just can't get enough
Uh keep a secret, oh mama can you keep a secret
But tell me can you keep a secret
Oh ma how you be
Oh ma how you be

Babe its automatic
The swagger that you got girl
Uh, your reputation as a hot girl
Shorty show me what it do, try to spit it to you
Holler at cha boy cause I just gotta have it
More than I've ever had to have it before
And I'm trying t put my bid in for sure (for sure)
I'm trying to get by your side
Before you get up outta here tonight

[Chorus]
Oh ma how you be
Oh boo it's something bout ya I just wanna know 
And it's up to me
To give it to you till you just can't get enough
Uh keep a secret, oh mama can you keep a secret
But tell me can you keep a secret
Oh ma how you be
Oh ma how you be

Now baby I'm trying to deal with ya (deal with ya)
No games dead trill with ya (trill with ya)
Because you walk it like you talk it girl
I just wanna be the one to give you what your missing
Girl check the flow (it's as right as it gets)
So what you know about a (DC Pimp)
I'm behind ya now (now)
Feeling on your waste (waste)
Whispering in ya ear (ear)
And let me just say
I'll have it hopping like a go-go girl
You gotta keep it on the low though girl
Shorty you way too fine to be by yourself tonight no

[Chorus]

When she steps in the building
Everybody is glad that she's around
Cause she's a supermodel 
Ooh shorty you looking so good
Finest thing in the town
She's a supermodel
Jazze Phizzel and Ginuwine ah

[Chorus]

She's a supermodel, oh
Ladies and Gentlemen, oh
It's the same ol' G, the same ol' Pheezay, hey
And it ain't really hard make it look so easy, so easy
You gotta put on ya velvet blazers for this, let's do velvet on this one man
That's beautiful, what is that velvet? Oh, ha, oh, ay
Grown folks to the front, oh, she's a supermodel when she's around
