		  Scream

Fell forth, destroy the source
Can't see, and my voice is hoarse
Try to wash your hands of us
But you should know better than to leave us in disgust

Let me take you right to the point
All you ever do is encage and disjoint
That does it, the time has arrived
Take it or leave it, you better not side

(You did it again)
All you ever did was doubt
(What do you want?)
Let me tell you what it's all about

One life, nine hearts
And eighteen hands that'll rip you all apart

We're here to decimate
To show you all we will never fall
And it's gonna get serious and critical
Don't stop because the feeling is terminal

Scream like you never have before
(Scream) scream 'til you can't scream anymore
(Scream) scream like your throat is bleeding
(Scream) scream 'til your heart stops beating
Scream for me

Get off of me and give a lie
Show the whole damn world that this will never die
No matter how the energies scatter
Got to know nothing exists but the dream

(Give it all)
'Til there's nothing left to give
(Save it all)
Quit saving you
If you're going to let the pain inside
Never under-estimate the way you live your life

(Scream) scream like you never have before
(Scream) scream 'til you can't scream anymore
(Scream) scream like your throat is bleeding
(Scream) scream 'til your heart stops beating
Scream for me

(All our lives)
All we ever sacrificed has paid
(Everything)
Everything is possible to me
(Why no fate?) 
Found everything that I had to take away
(Save your life) 
Save it all and make a better way
(All our lives)
All we ever sacrificed has paid
(Everything)
Everything is possible to me
(Why no fate?) 
Found everything that I had to take away
(Save your life) 
Save it all and make a better way

Yeah

This stress is a feeling that you can't compress
Everything you're going through is total stress
Are you going to be a momentary king or just a run around?
Or will you handle the matter and prove you exist?

(All our lives)
All we ever sacrificed has paid
(Everything)
Everything is possible to me
(Why no fate?) 
Found everything that I had to take away
(Save your life) 
Save it all and make a better way
(All our lives)
All we ever sacrificed has paid
(Everything)
Everything is possible to me
(Why no fate?) 
Found everything that I had to take away
(Save your life) 
Save it all and make a better way

Scream (scream, scream, scream, scream, scream, scream, yeah)
