		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All of these years and my life is still
Just tryin' to get up that great big hill of hope
For a destination
I realized quickly when I knew I should
That the world was made up of this brotherhood of man
For whatever that means

And so I cry sometimes when I'm lyin' in bed
Just to get it all out, what's in my head
And I, I'm feelin' a little peculiar
And so I wake up in the mornin' and I step outside
And I take a deep breath and I get real high
And I scream at the top of my lungs, "What's goin' on?"

And then I say, "Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey, yeah, yeah"
I say, "Hey
What's goin' on?"
Then I say, "Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey, yeah, yeah"
I say, "Hey
What's goin' on?"

And I try
Oh my God, do I try
I try all the time
In this institution
And I pray
Oh my God, do I pray
I pray every single day
For a resolution

And so I cry sometimes when I'm lyin' in bed
Just to get it all out, what's in my head
And I, I'm feelin' a little peculiar
And so I wake up in the mornin' and I step outside
And I take a deep breath and I get real high
And I scream at the top of my lungs, "What's goin' on?"

And then I say, "Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey, yeah, yeah"
I say, "Hey
What's goin' on?"
Then I say, "Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey, yeah, yeah"
I say, "Hey
What's goin' on?"

Then I say, "Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey, yeah, yeah"
I say, "Hey
What's goin' on?"
Then I say, "Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah" (Oh, no, no, no, no, no)
"Hey, yeah, yeah" (Hey, yeah, yeah)
I say, "Hey
What's goin' on?"

After all these years and my life is still
Tryin' to get up that great big hill of hope
For a destination
