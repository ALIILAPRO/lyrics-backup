		<p>
		  Oh, the heads that turn
Make my back burn
And those heads that turn
Make my back, make my back burn

The sparkle in your eyes
Keeps me alive
And the sparkle in your eyes
Keeps me alive, keeps me alive

The world
And the world turns around
The world and the world, yeah
The world drags me down

Oh, the heads that turn
Make my back burn
And those heads that turn
Make my back, make my back burn, yeah

Hey, yeah, hey, yeah 
Yeah-yeah

The fire in your eyes keeps me alive
And the fire in your eyes keeps me alive
I'm sure in her you'll find sanctuary
I'm sure in her you'll find sanctuary

And the world, the world turns around
And the world and the world, the world drags me down
And the world and the world and the world, the world turns around
And the world and the world and the world and the world
And the world drags me down

Ah, hey yeah, hey yeah
And the world (hey yeah, hey), and the world turns around (hey yeah, hey)
And the world, and the world (hey yeah, hey)
Yeah, the world drags me down (hey yeah, hey)
And the world (hey yeah, hey)
Yeah, the world turns around (hey yeah, hey)
And the world, and the world (hey yeah, hey), the world drags me down (hey yeah, hey)

Yeah hey, hey yeah
Sanctuary
