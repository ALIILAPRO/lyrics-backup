		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Road to ruin
No paper trail
No mercy shown
For heavens sake

Sheets on the wall
Ashamed to love
Frolic your faith
So refuse to come

Cheery call
Chug along
Knock it off till you see that beauty's gone

Perfect bloom
Perfect might
Sell it as this love crept out of sight

It's been a while I'm made of ribbon
He's been inside now I'm full of him
To here knows when, our clearance cold
I'm dressed for space, now can I go?

Well he needs me
Like a royal fox
Like he sorry's me
Like he smokes the rocks

Several masks
To last the year
Makes life dance
Right out of me

It's too hard to dream
Well fickle me
Put it in the icebox
Then we'll see

Wasting time
You've been caught
Bored unravelling
Knot for knot
