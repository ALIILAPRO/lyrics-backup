		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm spiraling on the kitchen floor
The drugs all don't work anymore
I reach for you, you let me drown
I think you like to let me down

My bedsheets all feel different now
Can't drive past your hometown
I see your face in every crowd
I call you but you don't turn around

You slept right through it all
You don't see how hard I fall

I hate how I love you
Miss my life before you
This never ending story
Sick of saying sorry
For how much I still love you
You're the one I run to
When I'm left with nothing
Please just give me something

You moved on so casually
When you meant the world to me
And I'm still waiting patiently
For a sign that you miss me

Years have passed and I can see
You barely even think of me
You fall in love so easily
With anyone who's not me

I hate how I love you
Miss my life before you
This never ending story
Sick of saying sorry
For how much I still love you
You're the one I run to
When I'm left with nothing
Please just give me something


You broke down all my walls
You made me feel so small
You slept right through it all
You don't see how hard I fall

I hate how I love you
Miss my life before you
This never ending story
Sick of saying sorry
For how much I still love you
You're the one I run to
When I'm left with nothing
Please just give me something
