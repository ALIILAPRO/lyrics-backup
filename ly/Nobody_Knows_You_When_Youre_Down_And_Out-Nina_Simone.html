		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well once I lived the life of a millionaire
Spending my money, I didn't care
Takin' my friends out for a mighty good time
Buyin' boot leg liquor, champagne and wine
Then I began to fall so low
Couldn't find me no friends
Had no place to go
And if I ever get my hands on a dollar again
I'm gonna hold on to it, till the eagle grins

I said nobody knows you
When you're down and out
In your pocket, you ain't got one penny
And your friends, you didn't have any
Just as soon as you get up on your feet again
Here they all come
They say that they're your long-lost friend
Oh lord without a doubt nobody wants you
Nobody needs you nobody wants you
When you're down and out

I say

Nobody wants you nobody needs you
Nobody wants you when you're down and out
