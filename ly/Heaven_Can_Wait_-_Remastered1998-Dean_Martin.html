		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You've got me crying crying crying crying crying
You've got me crying again
You've got me sighing again
What is this love all about

I'm in and I'm out
Your kisses right from the start
Came from your lips not your heart
You made me happy and then somebody new looks good to you

You got me crying again just a crying for you
You've got me crying again
You've got me sighing again
What is this love all about

I'm in and I'm out
Your kisses right from the start
Came from your lips not your heart
You make me happy and then somebody new looks good to you
You got me crying again just crying for you
