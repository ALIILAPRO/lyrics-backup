		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I had seven faces 
Thought I knew which one to wear
I'm sick of spending these lonely nights 
Training myself not to care

The subway is a porno 
The pavements they are a mess
I know you've supported me for a long time
Somehow I'm not impressed

But New York cares (got to be some more change in my life)
New York cares (got to be some more change in my life)
New York cares (got to be some more change in my life)
New York cares (got to be some more change in my life)

Subway she is a porno 
And the pavements they are a mess
I know you've supported me for a long time
Somehow I'm not impressed

It's up to me now turn on the bright lights
Oh, it's up to me now turn on the bright lights

New York cares (got to be some more change in my life)
New York cares (got to be some more change in my life)
New York cares (got to be some more change in my life)
New York cares (got to be some more change in my life)

It's up to me now turn on the bright lights
(Got to be some more change in my life)
Oh, it's up to me now turn on the bright lights
(Got to be some more change in my life)
