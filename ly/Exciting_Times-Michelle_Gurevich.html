		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Exciting times
Have arrived
It's your turn
In the light

The invisible hand
The wind at your back
One by one, lucky cards
Being stacked

cll the years
You worked for this
Now make sense
Dead-end roads
Stories untold
With no witness

Exciting times
Enjoy the ride
Feels like luck
May always stay
By your side
Exciting times

cll the world smiles with you
So much to look forward to
Just how long will it last?
There's no time to reflect
In exciting times

Have arrived
Only so many times
In a life

Come what may down the line
Throw your two cents in the pile
Cherish these precious
Exciting times
Exciting times
