		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You have become
What you have always been
Light flickering around
Peripheral vision

No words we can speak
Our paths have been chosen
All trails that we trek
Shall lead us back to here

Because our love comes again
Just when I've broken down I found
Love can come again

You gotta believe that love comes again
Just when I've broken down I found
Love can come again

Dig within me
Turn all the secret stones
Forests and fields
Brеathing with blood and bones

Still no words we can speak
Our paths to bе chosen
But all trails that we trek
Shall lead us back to here

Because our love comes again
Just when I've broken down I found
Love can come again

You gotta believe that love comes again
Just when I've broken down I found
Love can come again
Again, again, again
