Fourteen years old, I had sticks in my mama couch (what?)
Don't care 'bout rockstar, I trapped from my mama house (trapped from my mama house, what?)
Lord, forgive me for my sins
I pray for 'em daily (pray for 'em daily, what?)
Please Lord, forgive my brothers, uh, they spin on 'em daily (spin, spin, uh)
We trap on 'em daily (trap on 'em daily)
We get 'em goin' crazy (we get 'em goin' crazy)

We slidin' in your window, it's tinted (the tint)
We ride, we creep up with sticks (with sticks)
The Draco got binary traits (Homixide, Homixide)

Snot Gang, rock out, let's get it
We backdoor the trap, we takin' your shit (Homixide, Homixide)
We walkin' you down, you know we gon' spin it (Homixide, Homixide)
And if I lose count, I count it again
All these blue hunnids on me
Snatch you a line and get geeked
My niggas ain't showin' no love (Homixide, Homixide)
They walkin' you down for a feature (gang)
