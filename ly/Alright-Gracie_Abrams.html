		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I still avoid medication
I'd rather take a vacation
Drive around all of the outlets
Buy things and later regret it
Spend the whole week in Hawaii
Fall asleep under the palm trees
Down a whole bottle of whiskey
Countin' the people who hate me

I don't know if I'll be alright
What will it take to make this good?
Oh, someone tell me it gets better
Better, better, better
Because for tonight, I'm just not alright

What if I drove to you backwards? (Oh)
Jump in the shallow end headfirst (oh, oh)
Burn my emergency contact (oh)
Run for the hills when it gets bad (oh, oh)
What if I never move out? (Oh)
I'd live in the basement my whole life (oh, oh)
I got the chills when I said that (oh)
I never thought of a fallback (oh, oh)

I don't know if I'll be alright (alright)
What will it take to make this good?
Oh, someone tell me it gets better
Better, better, better
Because for tonight, I'm just not alright
