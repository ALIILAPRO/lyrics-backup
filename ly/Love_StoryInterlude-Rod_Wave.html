		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We can go anywhere you wanna go, across the globe, overseas, baby
And you ain't gotta pack no bag, we'll buy new clothes, let's hurry up and leave, baby
Sometimes I'm lost in my thoughts and I don't talk, don't mind me, baby
I just wanted you to know, you're all I want, you're what I need, baby
Hmm, yeah, yeah
Okay, and I just wanted you to know, you're all I want, what I need, baby

Yeah, okay, the missin' piece to my puzzle
I get high as fuck like no other
But I'm pretty sure that I love you
It's gon' take a minute to trust you
And it's been a while since we kicked it, in your eyes, I can see struggle
We can go anywhere in this world, we protected by my lil' brothers
And they don't play about me
I hope you know I'm nothin' what you heard or what you think of me
I hope you know that I can heal your broken heart, the pain I see
Just get on this plane with me

We can go anywhere you wanna go, across the globe, overseas, baby
And you ain't gotta pack no bag, we'll buy new clothes, let's hurry up and leave, baby
Sometimes I'm lost in my thoughts and I don't talk, don't mind me, baby
I just wanted you to know, you're all I want, you're what I need, baby
Hmm, yeah, yeah
Okay, and I just wanted you to know, you're all I want, what I need, baby

I can do this shit all night long
I can do this shit all night
I can do this shit all night long

Uh, lay your head on my chest, let my heart race
Right here in this dark place
All of your secrets are safe with me
No other place I'd rather be

I can do this shit all night long
I can do this shit all night
I can do this shit all night long
Mm, I can do this shit all night long
I can do this shit all night
I can do this shit all night long
All night long

Uh-huh
And we can do it all night
Or do it for the rest of your life
I'm nobody's man anyway
I didn't have no plans anyway
I am nobody's man anyway
And I didn't have no plans anyway

Lay your head on my chest, let my heart race
Right here in this dark place
All of your secrets are safe with me
No other place I'd rather be

I can do this shit all night long
I can do this shit all night
I can do this shit all night long
Oh, oh
I can do this shit all night long
I can do this shit all night
I can do this shit all night long
All night long
