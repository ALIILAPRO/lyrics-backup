		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Slow down, lie down
Remember it's just you and me
Don't sell out, bow out
Remember how this used to be

I just want you closer
Is that alright?
Baby, let's get closer tonight

Grant my last request
And just let me hold you
Don't shrug your shoulders
Lay down beside me
Sure I can accept that we're going nowhere
But one last time let's go there
Lay down beside me

Oh, I've found, that I'm bound
To wander down that one way road
Oh, and I realize all about your lies
But I'm no wiser than the fool I was before

I just want you closer
Is that alright?
Baby, let's get closer tonight

Grant my last request
And just let me hold you
Don't shrug your shoulders
Lay down beside me
And sure I can accept that we're going nowhere
But one last time let's go there
Ooh, lay down beside me

Oh, baby, baby, baby
Tell me how can, how can this be wrong?

Grant my last request
And just let me hold you
Don't shrug your shoulders
Lay down beside me
Sure I can accept that we're going nowhere
But one last time let's go there
Lay down beside me

Grant my last request
And just let me hold you
Don't shrug your shoulders
Lay down beside me
And sure I can accept that we're going nowhere
But one last time let's go there
Lay down beside me

Oh, oh, yeah, lay down beside me

One last time let's go there
Lay down beside me
