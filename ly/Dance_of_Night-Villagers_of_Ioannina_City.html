		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Awe tonight
The birth of new child
Has come back to life

Watch the sky
Planets are aligned
The stars collide

Feel the thunder
That cosmic thunder
Here's the water carrier

Set the pyre
Lift your spirit higher
Dance through the fire

Dancing around
Dancing around

Dance tonight
Spring has arrived
Nature has revived

The Earth is high
Longing for His night
The world has thrived
Dance together
Break that mental tether
Make that one step further

All together
Dance for his arrival
Ride the holy spiral

Dancing around

Dancing around
Moving in circles
Till the point that we reach to the edge of
The age of Aquarius

Singing along
Along with the angels
With all the spirits and animals
Become one with the universe

Dancing around
Moving in circles
Till the point that we reach to the edge of
The age of Aquarius

Singing along
Along with the angels
With all the spirits and animals
Become one with the universe

That's the new beginning
Open your eyes
Embrace the new beginning
Open your eyes
That's the new beginning
Open your eyes
Embrace the new beginning
Open your eyes

The Sun has finally come
That's the new beginning
Open your eyes
Embrace the new beginning
Open your eyes
That's the new beginning
Open your eyes
