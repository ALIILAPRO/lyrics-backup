		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I had the whole city on my whole city on my, whoa, whoa
Trapdoor shit, where I'm from, we hopped on shit
(Great John on the beat, by the way)
Whoa, what you say? Huh, look

Ooh, huh
Baddie, Betty Boo
She want some brand new shoes
She want me, but I want you (yeah, mhm)
I want a brand new coupe
Spent sixteen on shoes
Rock Mike Amiri, not Trues

Pop out, Balenciaga, I'm hot like lava
Drop ten bands on Prada, free Fross, he locked up
I just copped a chopper, my opps is washed up
They don't want no problems, they know we drop 'em
She said she want love, huh, told that bitch good luck
I want money, I want bucks, huh, but we still can go fuck
Ah, nah, that boy got back, back drippin'
Ah, nah, Sleepy a motherfuckin' savage
I'm with some money getters
Caeser taught me how to clip a nigga
We ain't playin', we'll clip a nigga
Go get a nigga, seen his bitch with him, like, huh, look

Ooh, huh
Baddie, Betty Boo
She want some brand new shoes
She want me, but I want you (yeah, mhm)
I want a brand new coupe
Spent sixteen on shoes
Rock Mike Amiri, not Trues

(Ooh), ooh (ooh), haha (yeah)
She do whatever I say do (no cap)
If not, she gotta move (skrrt)
I took one, she took two (ooh, ayy)
Shorty gon' love me and tell me the truth (ayy, uh)
I only leave when it's nothin' to do (ayy, uh)
She don't know none of my moves, huh (she don't)
Everywhere I go, I come with a tool (baow, baow)
They say they my man, but they love when I lose, look, uh
I'm in a bad mood, hoo (ayy)
Bino with me, bad dude (bad dude), uh
He put eighty fence on the tattoo (ayy, baow, ayy, uh, baow, uh)
Shawty go nuts, I'm a cashew, huh, yeah (glitt, baow-baow)
Ain't none of these rap dudes (lil' bitch)

Ooh, huh
Baddie, Betty Boo
She want some brand new shoes
She want me, but I want you (yeah, mm-hmm)
I want a brand new coupe
Spent sixteen on shoes
Rock Mike Amiri, not Trues

I had the whole city on my whole city on my, whoa, whoa, hold on
Trapdoor shit, where I'm from, we hopped on shit
Whoa, what you say? Huh, look
