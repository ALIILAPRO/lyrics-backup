		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I thought I'd be better as soon as my feet hit the floor
The sun through my window don't wake me up anymore
It feels like forever when you're caught in bad weather
Tomorrow is so far away
But nothing gets done with your hand on the gun
Thinking about yesterday

If not for the rain
I wouldn't notice the blue skies
If not for the sunshine
I wouldn't care for the shade
If not for the valley and all of this pain
The top of the mountain would seem just the same
Yeah, I wouldn't know a good day if not for the rain

When the light hits my eyes
It won't show the ways I've been worn
The darkness behind me, the pain, or the weight of the storm
The days will get longer and we'll just get stronger
For what we've been through in the end
It's part of the race, no matter the place
The sun's gonna shine again

If not for the rain
I wouldn't notice the blue skies
If not for the sunshine
I wouldn't care for the shade
If not for the valley and all of this pain
The top of the mountain would seem just the same
Yeah, I wouldn't know a good day if not for the rain

Oh, if not for the valley and all of this pain
The top of the mountain would seem just the same
Yeah, I wouldn't know a good day if not for the rain
Yeah, I wouldn't know a good day if not for the rain
