		<p>
		  Go down, go down, go down, yeah
Let me see you go to town, yeah
Go down, go down, go down, yeah
Let me see you go to town
Go down, go down, go down, yeah
Let me see you go to town, yeah
Go down, go down, go down, yeah, yeah, yeah

If you're down, boy, really down
Baby let me watch you go to town
It's your one chance, baby, never or now, yeah
Let me see you go to town, baby
Go to town, yeah
Baby let me watch you go to town
It's your one chance, baby, never or now, yeah, yeah, yeah

Go down, go down, go down, yeah
Let me see you go to town, yeah
Go down, go down, go down, yeah
Let me see you go to town
Go down, go down, go down, yeah
Let me see you go to town, yeah
Go down, go down, go down, yeah, yeah, yeah

Go to town with it
And she shave it all off, Charlie Brown with it
Looking all around, all the other girls sound fishy
He ain't ever caught a whiff, that's why he down with it
Yuh, bitch I'm telling you, this incredible, this shit edible
It's like caramel, kiss my genital
Mine taste medical (mayday)
Her's like chemicals (ayy, ayy)
If he gay, the way he taste, that shit turn hetero (Oh my God)
Can you see that? She need kneepads
I'm a bad bitch, fuck a pee-pad
Full of shit, if he don't eat it, he a D-bag
He can use a submarine, I'll call him seaman

If you're down, boy, really down
Baby let me watch you go to town
It's your one chance, baby, never or now, yeah
Let me see you go to town, baby
Go to town, yeah
Baby let me watch you go to town
It's your one chance, baby, never or now, yeah, yeah, yeah

Go down, go down, go down, yeah
Let me see you go to town, yeah
Go down, go down, go down, yeah
Let me see you go to town
Go down, go down, go down, yeah
Let me see you go to town, yeah
Go down, go down, go down, yeah, yeah, yeah

D to the TF, got your BF in my DMs
Got him all up in my hair, but it's not all mine, 'cause a bitch love FreeTress
So look baby don't lie, 'cause I can't believe my eyes
And her man between my thighs, whole time, yeah, I do my DIYs
And it's clean but, messy like a pizza
Spend time on the donkey, even though I yeehaw
Call it chunky monkey, I be texting peaches
He text me an eggplant, I text him a peanut (yeah)

If you're down, boy, really down
Baby let me watch you go to town
It's your one chance, baby, never or now, yeah
Let me see you go to town, baby
Go to town, yeah
Baby let me watch you go to town
It's your one chance, baby, never or now, yeah, yeah, yeah

Go down, go down, go down, yeah (baby, see you go down)
Let me see you go to town, yeah
Go down, go down, go down, yeah (baby, see you go down)
Let me see you go to town
Go down, go down, go down, yeah (baby, see you go down)
Let me see you go to town, yeah
Go down, go down, go down, yeah, yeah, yeah (baby, see you go)
