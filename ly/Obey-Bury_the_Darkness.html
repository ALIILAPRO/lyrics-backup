		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Euphoric for violence
Inflicting agony
So feral, no justice
Save us from tragedy
Use of force
Brutality
Beating down on me
What the fuck is this reality?
Obey
Follow what they say
Betray
They keep us in these chains
Scream
It's time to break away
Fuck authority
You can't control me
Obey
Follow what they say
Betray
They keep us in these chains
Scream
It's time to break away
Fuck authority
You can't control me
Mindless numbing medication
Killing us of aspiration
Trapped inside the simulation
Never ending desperation
Fuck
When you decide to see it from our eyes
This is a genocide
Conquer, divide
Dignified hypocrisy
Obey
Follow what they say
Betray
They keep us in these chains
Scream
It's time to break away
Fuck authority
You can't control me
Obey
Follow what they say
Betray
They keep us in these chains
Scream
It's time to break away
Fuck authority
You can't control me
Fuck you I'll do it my way
Fuck you I'll do it my way
Fuck you I'll do it my way
Fuck you I'll do it my way
Resist or die
Obey
Follow what they say
Betray
They keep us in these chains
Scream
It's time to break away
Fuck authority
You can't control me
Obey
Betray
Scream
Fuck authority
You can't control me
Obey
