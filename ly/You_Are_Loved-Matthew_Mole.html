		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ever since the day that we first met
God created love that He had kept
Now that I commit to you my life
We can only love each other more and more in time

You are loved
You are loved
And nothing's gonna change that I will
Love you till we're old and grey
And I'll love you when we're young

Don't be scared, it's alright
God has given us this love
And He will never let it fall apart
He will never leave our side, hmm

Every time you look into my eyes
I can see the passion you've acquired
Because everything you do you do with love
And every day you make me feel inspired to ignite

You are loved
You are loved
And nothing's gonna change that I will
Love you till we're old and grey
And I'll love you when we're young

Don't be scared, it's alright
God has given us this love
And He will never let it fall apart
He will never leave our side

And I'm falling more in love with you
I'm falling more in love with you
I'm falling more in love with you

Every time
That we close our eyes
We dream of life (Hmm)
And together we'll die (Hmm mm)

You are loved
You are loved
And nothing's gonna change that I will
Love you till we're old and grey
And I'll love you when we're young

Don't be scared, it's alright
God has given us this love
And He will never let it fall apart
He will never leave our side

You are loved
You are loved
And nothing's gonna change that I will
Love you 'til we're old and grey
And I'll love you when we're young

Don't be scared, it's alright
God has given us this love
And He will never let it fall apart
He will never leave our side
