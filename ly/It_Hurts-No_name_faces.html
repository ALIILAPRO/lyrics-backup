		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What is going on
I feel unease
Deep inside my chest
Lately I've tried to call
Countless times
You've closed the door completely

You've always been my angel by my side
So something must be wrong

I heard you I saw you by Coincidence
Wrapped around another man
Getting more intense
I lost my head started to scream
What the fuck is going on

How could you let me down
I trusted you you lied
You went behind my back
Broke my heart in pieces
Got me out of track
You didn't care about my pain
When you left
And flushed me down the drain
It hurts
It hurts

What did I do wrong
Why did you leave
What made you cross the line
Sometimes I blame myself
Should have known
But couldn't see the signs

How can I move on and trust again
My confidence is crushed

An anger erupting
I've lost my self control
All the disrespect and shame
Have taken it's toll
We had it all you didn't care
To even say it to my face

How could you let me down
I trusted you you lied
You went behind my back
Broke my heart in pieces
Got me out of track
You didn't care about my pain
When you left
And flushed me down the drain
It hurts

An anger erupting
I've lost my self control
All the disrespect and shame
Have taken it's toll
We had it all you didn't care
To even say it to my face

How could you let me down
I trusted you you lied
You went behind my back
Broke my heart in pieces
Got me out of track
You didn't care about my pain
When you left
And flushed me down the drain
It hurts
It hurts
