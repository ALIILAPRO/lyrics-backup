		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here comes the darkness
It's eating at my soul
Now that the spark has
Gone out of control
This fire is raging
I can't find the door
I just wanna die here
But you wanted more

You want me to burn
Want me to burn
Want me to hurt
And maybe I will finally learn

Here comes the darkness
It's eating at my brain
Now that the light has
Driven me insane
This fire is blazing
And I'm still inside
I just wanna die here
You wonÂ’'t let me out alive

You want me to burn
Want me to burn
Want me to hurt
And maybe I will finally learn
