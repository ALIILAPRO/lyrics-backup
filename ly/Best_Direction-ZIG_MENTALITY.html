		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And you thought
That the best of the best 
Would invest 
But possessions possess us 
Infest us all 

And the rest of us 
Stress to address
The distress 
That we dressed in a mess 
That we're blessed to own 

(I just wanna be) 
I just wanna feel the world keep spinning 

So you flex your obsession 
Expecting respect 
But rejection 
Instead redirects your fall 

Upset, you elect 
But regret 
That you're left disconnected 
Perfection erects us all
I'm way honest cuz I don't care
(I just wanna be) 

I just wanna feel the world keep spinning 
I just wanna feel the world keep spinning 

I don't need
I don't need 
I don't need
I don't need
I don't need
I don't need
I don't need 
I don't need

YOU!
