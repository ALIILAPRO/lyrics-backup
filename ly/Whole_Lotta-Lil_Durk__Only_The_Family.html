		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm in the studio with killers smoking cookies
And when I'm deep inside that pussy it get mushy
And she got caught with the swipes I had some rookie
Label me a kingpin feds tryna book me

And I need thirty for a show you try to book me
And I be watching for the hoes say they love me
And I be watching for the niggas say they love me
Say they love me

Grew up in the trenches with no leader
Balenciagas not no Reebok
She said she want her tummy tuck I told her detox
Walked inside Gucci spent two-hunnid for these socks

They'll stab you in your back that's a backstab
Judge give you twenty years off your background
And you can't pay your lawyers cause your guys clowns
When a nigga play with my gang that shit man down

When your homie on that stand put your head down
You'll be saying in your head put your hand down
See the opps be on my dick I turn them fans now
Get the whole hood rich that's the plan now

On a whole lotta gang shit yea
And a nigga can't change shit yea
And I'm riding for who I came with yea
And I'm dying for who I came with yea

Whole lotta money, money, money, money, money
Whole lotta killers, killers, killers, killers, killers
Whole lotta shooters, shooters, shooters, shooters, shooters
Whole lotta bitches, bitches, bitches, bitches, bitches
(Whole lotta)

You ever got snaked by your day ones
I heard them killers on my ass he ain't say nothing
And I was chewing on them Perkys 'til my pain gone
And that day that boy got shot I wish he stayed home

This rap shit who've thought I get paid off it
I remember OG going to the head office
And we'll sell our food stamps and get paid off it
He tried that dope and then he turned into a J off it

Niggas say they talk behind my back I say they stay talking
Police want me down bad, tried to charge for jaywalking
My little homie went out sad, let them niggas take from him
For the niggas go out sad, I can't put my face on it

On a whole lotta gang shit yea
And a nigga can't change shit yea
And I'm riding for who I came with yea
And I'm dying for who I came with yea

Whole lotta money, money, money, money, money
Whole lotta killers, killers, killers, killers, killers
Whole lotta shooters, shooters, shooters, shooters, shooters
Whole lotta bitches, bitches, bitches, bitches, bitches
(Whole lotta)
