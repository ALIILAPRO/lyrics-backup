		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Rest in peace, I can't feel my bones from my edge of my feet
Not a beast, I'm a creature eating rappers fuck it I beast if we meet
Bitch I smell like smoke
Better light some weed
Take a seat, I'm the one to chop you up and cook your meat

Hey, leave me out of all my pain
I ate the lies you fed my brain
Left me deserted, and for that I don't blame
Anything but what I've became

Aye, leave me out of all my pain
I eat the lies you fed my brain
But I don't got, nothing to blame
Anything but who I became

Hey, leave me out of all my pain
I ate the lies you fed my brain
Left me deserted, and for that I don't blame
Anything but what I've became
