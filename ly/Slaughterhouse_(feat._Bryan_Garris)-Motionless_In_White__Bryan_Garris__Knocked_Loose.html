		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Break down the wall again

You made a deal with the devil in a bloodbath
Now there's a price on your head, seal the contract
Automatic, systematic
We want our pound of flesh and we slice thick

Kill 'em all, kill 'em all, no successors
Flip the script and oppress the oppressors
Finding strength as we sift through the carnage
We want our pound of flesh and we'll take it

You fucking fascist
You fucking pig

You sit back as we collapse, packaged up and sold for scraps
Evade the butcher's tax, then write us off
And it's hard to stop the bleeding hung from hooks and barely breathing
But we'll break, break, break down the wall again

You tell your stories of the things that you've been through
But they're as false as the teeth that you lie through
Nobodies buying but you sell, sell, sell
In the land of the free, you're a slave to your wealth

You fucking fascist
Die you fucking pig
This is the consequence of opulence

You sit back as we collapse, left to fight over scraps
While you auction off our backs to buy your crown (force-fed the lies)
And it's hard to stop the bleeding hung from hooks and barely breathing
But we'll break, break, break down the wall again
Break, break, break down the wall

One mutilation under God
God in the cross, devil in the nails
Whatcha gonna buy with all your money in hell?
God in the cross, devil in the nails
Whatcha gonna buy with all your money in hell?

You sit back as we collapse, packaged up and sold for scraps
While you auction off our backs to pay the tax (eye for an eye)
Victims of your invention, all we've got are cruel intentions
But we'll break, break, break down the wall again
Break, break, break down the wall again

Cut you up, cut you up, cut you down at your knees
Watch you beg like a rat for your luxuries
Cut you up, cut you up, rip the teeth from your mouth
You won't survive in the slaughterhouse
Die

Cut you up, cut you up, cut you down at your knees
Watch you beg like a rat for your luxuries
Cut you up, cut you up, rip the teeth from your mouth
You won't survive in the slaughterhouse
