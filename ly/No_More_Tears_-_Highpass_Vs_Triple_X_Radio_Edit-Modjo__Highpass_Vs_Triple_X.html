		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Say it's not the end
I try to make amends
I say that we can take our chance
I'm dying since you went away

Pain, I've had my share (I've really had my share)
Waiting for you in vain (I've been waiting for you)
But now, I found myself
I've got to break my chains

No more tears to cry
Hope will free my mind

I can't understand
Why you want this to end
I know i got to take a stand
I'll never be some kind of friend

Sadness, I paid my dues (You know I paid my dues)
Hard times, I've had a few (I have had a few)
Tired of feeling blue (Sometimes I'm feeling blue)
I turn to someone new

[Chorus]
No more tears to cry
Hope will free my mind
A new sun will rise
Love will make it shine

Now I've drawn a line
I've kissed my past goodbye
I know that love will dry my eyes
And God knows time is on my side

Pain, I've had my share (You know I've had my share of)
Waiting, you didn't care (I've been waiting for you)
And now, I've found myself
I've got to break my chains

[Chorus]

When the one love you had left you hurting so bad
The world seems to fall apart, your life has turned into dark
But the sun will rise in somebody's loving eyes
It will light up your way, turning your night into day

[Chorus]
