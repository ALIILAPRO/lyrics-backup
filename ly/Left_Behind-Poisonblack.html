		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  ""\""The days of bending over are over!\""  I am closing Shutting down this need so vain For this time around I won't live the past again  I have chosen To leave your trap so far behind To bury your face I have failed but not this time  Then I feel you slashing through me  I am the one you tried to leave behind I am the guilt you'll always feel (taste the pain) Just pour me in and face the rain again (face the pain) And I will take you to the end  I'm inhaling The scent of everything I've done To bury disgrace Is to pull the trigger... I am done  Then I feel you slashing through me  I am the one you tried to leave behind I am the guilt you'll always feel (taste the pain) Just pour me in and face the rain again (face the pain) And I will take you to the end  [Solo: Laihiala]  Then I feel you slashing through me  I am the one you tried to leave behind I am the guilt you'll always feel (taste the pain) Just pour me in and face the rain again (face the pain) And I will take you to the end Just pour me in and face the rain again (face the pain) And I will take you to the end...""
