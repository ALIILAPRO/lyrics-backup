		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Castaways, we are castaways
Ahoy there, ahoy, we are castaways
We're stuck where we are with no house, no car
Castaways, ahoy, we are castaways

We were out at sea on a sailing ship
The rain began to rain and the wind began to whip
We felt the ship tip, it was going down
So we launched our lifeboat so we wouldn't drown

Castaways, we are castaways
Ahoy there, ahoy, we are castaways
On an island at sea
Just me
Me
And me!
Castaways, ahoy, we are castaways
