		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Woodstock woman rides coach into Coachella
Singing ""hold me closer tiny dancer""
She'll love you to death but wonders why she keeps on living
Praying one day she might know the answer

Broadway baby screaming ""Jesus won't you save me""
She barely makes a living as a drag queen
Practice her poses hoping someone will notice
She really hasn't loved herself much lately

And it might be longer than you thought
Till' your five miles high and rolling in the benjamins
So you live your life losing sleep
Cause you just can't seem to find th–µ perfect sentiment
And I might be wrong I might die young but it really seems to me
That maybe we're just living for a dream

Manchester monster, he's smoother than Sinatra
Wants to party like a rockstar till' he's dead
Drives from town to town singing Wonderwall with the windows down
He sees a life worth living in his head

But it might be longer than you thought
Till' your five miles high and rolling in the benjamins
So you live your life losing sleep
Cause you just can't seem to find the perfect sentiment
And I might be wrong I might die young but it really seems to me
That maybe we're just living for a dream

And it might be longer than you thought
Till' your five miles high and rolling in the benjamins
So you live your life losing sleep
Cause you just can't seem to find the perfect sentiment
And I might be wrong I might die young but it really seems to me
That maybe we're just living for a dream
