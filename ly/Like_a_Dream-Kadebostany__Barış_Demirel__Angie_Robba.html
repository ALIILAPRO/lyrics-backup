		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It was like a dream oh
The way you walked in oh
It was such a scene
From every angle
So symmetrical
Just like a God

Fly away, my sparrow blue
Mountains from a bird’s eye a view
May the breeze just carry you
Don’t forget me, it’s too soon

Cuz we were angels in past lives
Reincarnated many times
Born under the same star sign
Astro twins, we are undying

Like a dream
It was oh
Speechless I just froze oh
I felt seen
Delusional
Illusional
You showed me my reflection
With a crack in every mirror

Fly away, my sparrow blue
Mountains from a bird’s eye a view
May the breeze just carry you
Don’t forget me, it’s too soon

Cuz we were angels in past lives
Reincarnated many times
Born under the same star sign
Astro twins, we are undying
