		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And I was hoping that you had an atlas in your head
So fed up of the same old man
There's broken bedrooms and there are broken hands
You were so fed up of the same old broken man

And do you wanna, do you wanna?
Do you wanna make love to me?
I know you wanna, I know you wanna
I know you wanna make love to me

Oh, I came to tell you that you're my favorite girl
And would you like it if I put you into my world?
There's broken hearts in the basement and broken love on the street
You were so fed up of it always involving me

But do you wanna, do you wanna?
Do you wanna make love to me?
I know you wanna, I know you wanna
I know you wanna make love to me

Do you want, do you want to?
Do you wanna make love to me?
I know you want to, babe, know you want to
I know you want to make love to me
Do you wanna, do you wanna?
Do you wanna make love to me?
I know you wanna, babe, I know you wanna
I know you wanna make love to me

Do you wanna, do you wanna?
Do you wanna make love to me?
I know you wanna, I know you wanna
I know you wanna make love to me

Oh, I know
I know you wanna make love to me
Make, make, make
I know you wanna make love
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, you wanna make love
