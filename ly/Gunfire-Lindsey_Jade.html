		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Locked inside of my own mind
In a paradigm 
Doing time
I've been searching frantically 
Escape knows how to hide

Violence in my head
Gunfire
Gunfire
Gunfire
Bullets of distress
Gunfire
Gunfire
Gunfire

Self-inflicted my own crime
Maybe it's a lie
Maybe mine
I won't give up easily
Until my case is tried

Violence in my head
Gunfire
Gunfire
Gunfire
Bullets of distress
Gunfire
Gunfire
Gunfire

I can 
Break free from blame
From these chains
So untrue

Smoke and
Mirrors played
c losing game
Now I see through

Violence in my head
Gunfire
Gunfire
Gunfire
