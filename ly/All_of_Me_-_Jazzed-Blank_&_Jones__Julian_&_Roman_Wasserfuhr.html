		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Maybe I
I never wanted you to be controlling me
I only wanted you to be
Come call on me
I didn’t want to say
that I could corner me oh

Maybe I
I never wanted you to be controlling me
I only wanted you to be
Come call on me
I didn’t want to say
that I could corner me oh

Can’t breathe
never her to go
Can’t feel
never wanted her to go
every time i hear her name it makes me cold
feel it slip away I’m losing the control

oh if i could go back then i could save us
oh I wouldn’t be afraid to touch you
oh if i could go back then i could save us
yea i’d know what to say
I’d give you all my love
