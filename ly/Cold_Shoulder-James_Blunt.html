		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Scanning my mind
Looking for happiness I can't find
I know it's said a lot but time flies
Where did it all go wrong? It's all gone wrong
It's a short life
Sometimes I like to overanalyze
Don't need to say it's behind your eyes
Where has the love all gone? The love's all gone

Take me to the days when you caught my eye
And we'd just stay in bed and we'd talk all night
I wanna feel the love but the well's run dry
Oh, when did this get older? 'Cause now when I lean over
I get the cold shoulder

Red eyes
I wanna fix it but I'm dead inside
I had a memory that made me smile
Where did it all go wrong? It's all gone wrong
We're living fake lives
I read the truth between the white lies
Feels like I'm watching from the side-lines
Where has the love all gone? The love's all gone

Take me to the days when you caught my eye
And we'd just stay in bed and we'd talk all night
I wanna feel the love but the well's run dry
Oh, when did this get older? 'Cause now when I lean over
I get the cold shoulder
I get the cold shoulder

Baby, just be honest
Tell me I've still got it
Tell me you still want it
Say we haven't lost it
Baby, just be honest
Tell me I've still got it
Tell me you still want it
Say we haven't lost it now

Take me to the days when you caught my eye
And we'd just stay in bed and we'd talk all night
I wanna feel the love but the well's run dry
Oh, when did this get older? 'Cause now when I lean over
I get the cold shoulder

Be honest
Tell me I've still got it
Tell me you still want it
Say we haven't lost it
Baby, just be honest
Tell me I've still got it
Tell me you still want it
Say we haven't lost it now
