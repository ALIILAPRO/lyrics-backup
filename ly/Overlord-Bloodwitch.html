		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You killed 500 of my best men, you had them shaved & beheaded
The retribution for this insult upon me is nothing like you have seen yet
From all sides, we will rain down upon you with 200,000 men
I'll never stop, I'll never quit until you are pronounced dead

You'll fear me when you have crossed that line
I'll make you beg for your life in good time, I warned you
You'll fear me when you've crossed that line
I will make you grovel, I'll make you suffer
I am your Overlord

You see your army has split up into factions, dreading my villainy
I'll set about their execution by pouring molten lead within their eyes
From all sides, we will rain down upon you with 200,000 men
I'll never stop; I'll have your birthplace erased right off the map

You'll fear me when you have crossed that line
I'll make you beg for your life in good time, I warned you
You'll fear me when you've crossed that line
I will make you grovel, I'll make you suffer
I am your Overlord

When you meet me in the bottom, the world will be on fire
When you meet me in the bottom, the world will be on fire
And even though it gets dark, you won't have any place to hide
And even though it gets dark, you won't have any place to hide
You can't run forever, I'm gonna find you.
You can't run forever, I'll make you face me.
