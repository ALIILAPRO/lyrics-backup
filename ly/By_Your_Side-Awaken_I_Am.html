		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well what's left of me?
As I lay there silent with a blank stare,
I forget to breathe.
Now I'm grinding my teeth and I can't sleep,
Overthinking and feeling bitter,
As all of my patience slowly wears thinner.
You've taken the best of me,
Now I lay here fighting all your fake fears,
And I hate what's left but you know I can't let go.

You do this every time,
Now there's no one by your side,
But it's your fault when you fall for your own lies,
And you make your issues mine.

You've changed far from what you were,
And I gave everything I could,
Now we've both got problems, I know it,
But you let yours build up and surface.
And I hate what's left but you know I can't let go.

You do this every time,
Now there's no one by your side,
But it's your fault when you fall for your own lies,
And you make your issues mine.

I've seen this through too many times,
You look at me and say you'll try,
But your eyes still don't meet mine,
Then we pretend everything's fine.

You hold your hands against my face,
You pull me in then push away,
And no matter what I say,
It's still me that takes the blame.

And I hate what's left but you know I can't let go.
And I hate what's left but you know
