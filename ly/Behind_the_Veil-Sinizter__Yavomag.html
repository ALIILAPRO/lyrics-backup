		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Know I'm drippin' and my haters bums
I keep that smithy with extendo tucked
You try to run up and that mag gon' dump
I play that choppa like some bongo drums
I take one hit off of that wedding cake
And now my brain go into hyperspace
Like I'm TRON bitch I'm in cyberspace
Behind the veil, I know you can't relate
Bitch I'm driftin' and I'm swervin' like Le Mans race
Tote revolvers, like a Western, call me John Wayne
I'm like Jensen in this bitch, I do the Death Race
All that cap that you be doin', name ain't hold weight
Know I'm drippin' and my haters bums
I keep that smithy with extendo tucked
You try to run up and that mag gon' dump
I play that choppa like some bongo drums
I take one hit off of that wedding cake
And now my brain go into hyperspace
Like I'm TRON bitch I'm in cyberspace
Behind the veil, I know you can't relate
