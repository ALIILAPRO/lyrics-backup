		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm insane
It's my brain that's partly why you're gone
I'm afraid no one relates to my mistakes
You know I've got them memorized
You know I've got them memorized
The memories I'm haunted by keep pulling me
Back in when I feel so far away, so far away
It's tearing me up more inside to carry on this
Way when I feel so far away
When I'm far away
I'm insane
I'm wide awake at ten to eight
what a life
Thrown away and I'm to blame
Now I wear the shame
Like a noose that just gets tighter
The memories I'm haunted by keep pulling me
Back in when I feel so far away, so far away
It's tearing me up more inside to carry on this
Way when I feel so far away
When I'm far away
Pull back when I'm trying to leave
Left for dead all alone in the streets
Pull back when I'm trying to leave
I ain't staying this is how it'll be
Left for dead all alone in the streets
But the thought of you is following me
Just go
AWAY
AWAY
Pull back when I'm trying to leave
I ain't staying this is how it'll be
Left for dead all alone in the streets
But the thought of you is following me
The memories I'm haunted by keep pulling me
Back in when I feel so far away
When I'm far away
It's tearing me up more inside to carry on this
Way when I feel so far away, so far away
Far away
When I'm far away
Far away
When I'm far away I'm
Far away
When I'm far away
Far away
When I'm far away I'm
