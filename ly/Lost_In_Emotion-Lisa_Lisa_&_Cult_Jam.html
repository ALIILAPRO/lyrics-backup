		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hit the beat now
Lost in emotion
Some guys will promise you a
Marriage made in heaven
But I'm gonna stick to my guns
Like waitin for their love
that I might be gettin
My dreams have just begun
Am I awful to think of love
Are you free
And love for you, oh my
And come to see you oh oh
Lost in emotion
Telling you things you really shouldn't know
Oh baby, I'm lost in emotion
Am I fool at least my friends think so
Que sera Sera
Baby, whenever we're free, que sera sera
Between you and me
Just how true are the rumors I am hearing
About this crush you have on me
Maybe I'm blind but I just don't see it
But I want to believe what they say
I find myself telling you things
I don't even tell my best friend
I can't show it the emotions overflowin
Just wear it I'll dance around
Sometimes I wonder if I am in your heart
Even though I don't live there yet
I'm afraid it'll be cold and dark
I'm lost in emotion
Telling you things you really shouldn't know
I'm lost in emotion
Am I a fool, at least my friends think so
Que sera sera
Between you and me
A boy couldn't go
Baby am I a fool cause I don't know
Just how you feel
I'll be there for you all the time
Hit the beat now
When I'm feelin, I hate this feelin
Lost in emotion
