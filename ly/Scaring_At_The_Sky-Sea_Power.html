		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dear it's ok to go down
Nothing remains but a love that's sound
Just a little girl with the lovely hair
You feel like you're a failure
And it's enough to make you sick
To see the secrets of seeing
See the truth
When you die 
A little deeper little deeper little deep thrum
If we keep on falling will we hit the bottom?
Nothing much to talk about we're just passing time
And now
For the last time
In your nose 
Smell the roses
For the first time
Keeps going back 
Keeps going back
Dirt tracked on the floor
Like a cracked record
Scaring at the sky
For the last time
At least you gave it a try
For a long time
Scaring at the sky
It's ok to go down
Scaring at the sky
It's ok to go down
Scaring at the sky
It's ok to go down
