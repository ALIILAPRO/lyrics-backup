		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Keeper of the blackened flame
He cared not if it came with fame
Keeper of the unholy scrolls
Words covered the wounds where the world looks its toll
Hands reached out but darkness took its hold
Purveyor of the darkest night
Nocturnal leviathan
King of night-world
Defoliate, true art to create
Unhallowed forever be his name
Sorcerer, musically masterful
We will forever be your dark soldiers
Rise, and ride
Lead the dark armies of the night
Forever engraved
We will not forget your name
Crowned in Everblack
Crowned in Everblack
Forever engraved
We will not forget your name
Forever engraved
We will not forget your name
Crowned in Everblack
Rituals of the abysmal
A miasma in our hearts of loss untold
Not to be replaced
Verminous our fate
Nightbringers will not forget your name
Nightbringers will not forget your name
Never we will forget your name
Rise, and ride
Lead the dark armies of the night
Forever engraved
We will not forget your name
Crowned in Everblack
Rituals of the abysmal
A miasma in our hearts of loss untold
Not to be replaced
Verminous our fate
Nightbringers will not forget your name
