		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Right or wrong, we've been through it all
Can't believe it's over now
Understand that you'll love again
Word my friends say to me
On my own, all my hope is gone
I dig my knees into the ground
Oh I know, it's so hard to see
Look what you done to me

I'm falling
I'm falling
I'm falling again
I'm falling
I'm falling
I'm falling again

I don't know why I stayed so long
I always knew you'd let me down
I'm the man who belongs alone
Thought that was plain to see
Now you've come back into the fold
You're telling me you want me now
Let me go, leave my head alone
Look what you've done to me

We're falling
We're falling
We're falling again
We're falling
We're falling
We're falling again

Babe, we're falling
Only falling
Lord we're falling again
Babe, we're falling
Oh we're falling
So far we're falling
We're falling again
