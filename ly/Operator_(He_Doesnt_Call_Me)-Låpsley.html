		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Operator give me information)

My hearts been picked up way too many times
Wrong numbers fill my blood watch the spinning dials

You can measure my pressure but I'll blow up in a second
You can measure my pressure but I'll blow up in a second
Don't put me on hold please
Don't put me on hold please
Don't put me on hold please
Fly here and hold me

He doesn't call me so put me through operator
Maybe I'll leave him and fall in love with you operator
My baby doesn't call me so put me through operator
So tell me should I leave him and fall in love with you operator

The miles keep adding up voicemails of frustration
Long-distance takes it's toll give me information

You can measure my pressure but I'll blow up in a second
You can measure my pressure but I'll blow up in a second

Long distance
Long distance

He doesn't call me so put me through operator
Maybe I'll leave him and fall in love with you operator
My baby doesn't call me so put me through operator
So tell me should I leave him and fall in love with you operator

It's like I've got a broken heart
It's like I've got a broken heart and I need a kick-start
It's like I've got a broken heart
It's like I've got a broken heart and I need a kick-start
Broken heart, broken heart
Broken heart, broken heart
