		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  White shirt now red, my bloody nose 
Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes 
Creepin' around like no one knows 
Think you're so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for you 
Don't say thank you or please
I do what I want when I'm wanting to 
My soul? So cynical

So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy 
Chest always so puffed guy 
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type 
Make your girlfriend mad tight 
Might seduce your dad type 
I'm the bad guy, duh

I'm the bad guy

I like it when you take control 
Even if you know that you don't 
Own me, I'll let you play the role 
I'll be your animal
My mommy likes to sing along with me 
But she won't sing this song
If she reads all the lyrics
She'll pity the men I know

So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy 
Chest always so puffed guy 
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type 
Make your girlfriend mad tight 
Might seduce your dad type 
I'm the bad guy, duh

I'm the bad guy, duh

I'm only good at being bad, bad 

I like when you get mad

I guess I'm pretty glad that you're alone
You said she's scared of me?
I mean, I don't see what she sees
But maybe it's 'cause I'm wearing your cologne
I'm a bad guy 
I'm, I'm a bad guy 
Bad guy, bad guy 
I'm a bad
