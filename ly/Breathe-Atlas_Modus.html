		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I`ve been a part of it for a while
Everyone’s a part of it living a lie
The world is always dying every minute of your life
Can we start over now?
What’s the use of trying to climb the wall.
Searching for someone to hear my call
Stop pretending it’s under control
So let the world fall apart
Fill the hollowness inside of me
Put the verve just where it used to be
It’s an illusion we could not be free
The only way is just
Breathe
So Just breathe
Just breathe
So Just breathe
I’ve tried my best to find out if It’s wrong or right
It’s never-ending story I’ve been losing my mind
See from the beginning we are deaf and blind
And get you life back but
Everything’s around is a sign to stop
I believe we’re heading to the top
Where is the humanity? there’s hope
And there is no one here
We’re all the same ‘cause we’ve been poisoned
And finally I got what it was all about
I guess you wish to get your self saved
The only way is just
Breathe
So Just breathe
Just breathe
So Just breathe
The only way is just
Breathe
So Just breathe
Just breathe
So Just breathe
