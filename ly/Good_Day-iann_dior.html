		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm outta my mind
I'm outta my mind
And I can't take it
I can't take it

Who are you to tell me who to be?
I be walkin' on the moon off the shrooms and the lean
Got a grip on the world, I'm okay with who I am
I feel free, watch me soar, I love countin' up the ends

It's gon' be a good day
I'ma have a good day 'cause I had a long night
Rollin' with my niggas and they never switchin' sides
Smoke a OZ, man, I love to get high

Yeah
New whip, too quick for them fuck niggas (fuck niggas)
Can't vibe with you, I don't even fuck with you (nah-nah)
Like a bad dream, felt like I was stuck with you
But now I'm up and she wanna fall in love, how
How I feel? Man I'm feelin' great
Yeah, roll the Backwood', take it to the face
Remember I was down, but I won the race
I left my town, pull up in a Wraith
I left out of town, pull up in a Wraith
Talk to my accountant, hunnid in the bank, yeah (yeah)
So it's fuck what you think
I'm on my way
I love countin' blue faces

Who are you to tell me who to be?
I be walkin' on the moon off the shrooms and the lean
Got a grip on the world, I'm okay with who I am
I feel free, watch me soar, I love countin' up the ends

It's gon' be a good day
I'ma have a good day 'cause I had a long night
Rollin' with my niggas and they never switchin' sides
Smoke a OZ, man, I love to get high

(It's gon') it's gon' be a good day
I'ma have a good day 'cause I had a long night
Rollin' with my niggas and they never switchin' sides
Smoke a OZ, man, I love to get high
