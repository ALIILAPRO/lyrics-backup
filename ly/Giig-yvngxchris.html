		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Perfect)

Bentley Bentayga, I'ma take off
And if that nigga try to play soft
Glock gon' come off the pinch like the Playoffs
Pull up, my whole gang gon' chase y'all
.556 up in the K, rip his face off
I was in the back of the class with a bad bitch
I don't kick it with these niggas, they give me a bad image
I'ma beat that nigga ass like a mother with bad children
And lil' bitch, I'm in the SRT, I'm fast livin'
And lil' shorty got a BBL, her ass different
And these niggas wanna see me fail, I'm mad different
Backflippin', ass kickin', nigga, I make dirty look like racks to these niggas
I just took that nigga sack, I don't think I'll give it back to that nigga
You the type of nigga, rattin' to a nigga
I'ma go out if I have to, my nigga
I'm made for this season, I pray for these meters
I met her up on tour, I gave her big penis
She all in my pant, to get her litty
She said that she broke, she claimin' I'm the reason

I got thrax in my system
I pull tracks off your sister
She know that I'm that nigga
(Bitch, I be that nigga) (yeah, yeah)
(Bitch, I be that nigga) (yeah)
I got racks in my denim
Ho, relax, you can't get 'em
Told that bitch, you gon' fill 'em

I got thrax in my system
I pull tracks off your sister
She know that I'm that nigga
(Bitch, I be that nigga) (yeah, yeah)
(Bitch, I be that nigga) (yeah)
I got racks in my denim
Ho, relax, you can't get 'em
Told that bitch, you gon' fill 'em
