		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So sick and tired of living
And so afraid to die
I've lived so many lives
And still I wonder why
The way the world perceives me
Is not the way I am
The one half thinks I'm crazy
The other thinks I'm mad

I spent a long long time alone in my room
I need your help to get me out of this gloom

Can you hear them
All the voices in my head
They freak me out
Can you hear them
They won't be happy 'till I'm dead 
They freak me out

Ten thousand million nightmares
Temptation by the score
I used to get so high 
And still I wanted more
You think my time is wasted
In search of who I am
I tried to so hard to kill
The boy inside the man

I spent a thousand years one night in my room
I've lived so many lives and that is my doom

Can you hear them
All the voices in my head
They freak me out
Can you hear them
They won't be happy 'till I'm dead 
They freak me out

Can you hear them
All the voices in my head
They freak me out
Can you hear them
They won't be happy 'till I'm dead 
They freak me out

I never thought I'd smile again
Always thought I'd be here on my own
Sometimes when I'm down
You come and save me again
And again
And again
And again

I'll never understand it
It makes no sense at all
Just look at what I've done
It's time to count the score

I've spent a long long time alone in my room
I need your help to get me out of this gloom

Can you hear them
All the voices in my head
They freak me out
Can you hear them
They won't be happy 'till I'm dead 
They freak me out

Can you hear them
All the voices in my head
They freak me out
Can you hear them
They won't be happy 'till I'm dead 
They freak me out
