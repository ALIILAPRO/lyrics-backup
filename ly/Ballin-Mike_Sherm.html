		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Run it up kel
Ballin', everything flawless
I ain't gotta brag let my money do the talkin'
No employees, nigga, I was raised around the bosses
Niggas wanna funk, but they can't afford a coffin
Poppin', niggas steady watchin'
Louie's on my feet, commas sidekick to my pockets
Thought it was a room, nah. nigga that's my closet
Broke the money counter, I got rich nigga problems
Should I buy a Benz? Nigga, should I buy the Audi?
Chillin' on the jet now it's cloudy
Hit another state for a day then I'm outtie
I remember I was only poppin' in the county
Now a nigga always lose count when I'm counting
How the fuck you still ain't touch ten? Nigga childish
Workin' OT every week a hundred hours
Say I'm acting funny, wait 'til I drop the album
I'm a player, got hella flavor
Phones in the bucket everybody sign a waver
Nigga signed, only got a chain niggas slavin'
Sign to myself, every week, that's a payment
Made it, nerd niggas hatin'
Money stackin' up, I ain't even gotta save it
Niggas fake I can't even trust them when they bang it
Got a lot of change, but I'm still not changin'
Don't call me to link up, I ain't hangin'
Four deep, no strap, nigga playing
If rap don't work then it's back to the basics
Nigga took my swag I ain't mad I embrace it
Don't believe the 'Gram it's a whole lotta fakin'
A bag or the clout, what the fuck you nigga chasin'?
Me? I'll be tryna give motivation
Shit ain't gonna happen overnight, have patience
Buzzin', nigga, I be dummin'
Nigga hella cheap, they be ballin' on a budget
50 pop on me right now, that ain't nothin'
Before I let a bitch play a nigga I'm a dougie
Ain't finna talk about it, nigga, know how I'm comin'
Got the cheat codes, I just gotta push a button
From a place with a lot of hate, but I love it
They like "There he go" when they see me out in public
Bitch
