		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (He chants)
 
If I held my breath on you
I will die a thousand times
And if chewing was to show you how much I cared
I would have probably be wearing dentures by now
 
If I held my breath on you 
I will die a thousand times
And if chewing was to show you how much I cared
I would have probably be wearing dentures by now
 
Promises broken
Nemesis our token
Turned around and marched on out to a new home
Oh but wherever you've gone darling 
Don't forget to 

Treat others the way, you wanna be treated
Remember your days are fully numbered

(He chants march on)
 
If you held your breath on me
You would have died a million times
And if chewing was to show me how much I cared
You would have probably swallowed your tongue by now
 
All am trying to say is that you know very well that I left her for you
Now I guess you are doing the same old same thing to me now 
 
These days Hennessy dries my veins
Whilst our genesis flies back at me
Now heresy might be your new faith, faith
But whatever you believe in
Make sure you never forget to

Treat others the way, you wanna be treated
Remember your days are fully numbered

Treat others the way, you will want to be treated
Remember your days are fully numbered

Can't say anything for you no more
Nemesis is on your case baby
Next time
Treat others the way you will want to be treated
Else there will be punishment 
Oh and there she comes
Life ain't a bitch
Nemesis is
And she is the mother of Karma

So long you run
