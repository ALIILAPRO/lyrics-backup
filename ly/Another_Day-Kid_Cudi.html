		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Iffy, can't decide which one I want
All the girls at the party, come along, it's a party
We started (yeah)
Mixin' drinks, how much? Who knows
I pour one up for dead homies, the dearly departed, baby (yeah, yeah, uh) 
Ain't miss the moment, ain't no spillin' (yeah)
Dude I been livin', illin', tryna find the thing I'm feelin'
You feel it (whoa), all's good until I hit the ceilin'
Good riddance, I figured I'd be straight just need a minute
Just a second (yeah)
Always been another load in my zone, oh
Nothing else can fix the problem but this herb grown, grown
Yes that there, it got me on one (oh, yeah)
Ain't no tweakin', I'm professional
Better give a nigga room, I be back 'round two
It's the soldier in me (yeah), let them fuckers envy
217, Heaven-bound, who gon' trippin' with C? (Yeah)
The rager from the dark (get 'em)

Day fades and the sun goes away
Same old nigga and the same old pain
Ain't much changin' me, y'all (yeah)
Seems like ain't nothin' changin' me, y'all
Thank God it's all another day
But I can't go escape, what I have made
Nah, ain't much changin' me, y'all (yeah)
Seems like ain't nothin' changin' me, y'all (yeah)

Drop it (let's go)
Had me at hello, we in the spot
Can I stop it? (Yeah)
Ragin' with familiar names think they got it, not (not)
And you see me twisted on the low, there he go
Yeah baby, there he go, yeah, really, really (uh)
Don't be out there lookin' crazy, hazy, ho (ho)
In a sec I surf the waves formin' in my dome
We keep puttin' hope in coastin'
Ragin' through the day, sexy baby turn me on, oh (uh)
Hit me up, hit me, hit me, come on
Ready or not, nigga, coming with it, come on
With the team, hit me, hit me, oh no
Hit 'em up, and I'm rippin', rippin' indeed (yo)
And I'm comin' full blown 'til the tombstone (yeah)
How I'm livin', gotta push it, gotta set the tone (yeah)
It ain't nothin' to me baby, say I'm livin' long (go)

Day fades and the sun goes away
Same old nigga and the same old pain
Ain't much changin' me, y'all (yeah)
Seems like ain't nothin' changin' me, y'all
Thank God it's all another day
But I can't go escape, what I have made
Nah, ain't much changin' me, y'all (yeah)
Seems like ain't nothin' changin' me, y'all (yeah)

Tell me where you're goin'
Tell me where you're headed
