		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I dunno what to say (Say)
All I think about is how youʼre making me crazy
All night all day (Yeah)
Iʼll be walking round with a smile so blazing
You make me happier
I never thought in a thousand years
Youʼd be the one to make me feel this way

Yeah Iʼm gonʼ dance with you
For a night or two
Yeah Iʼm made for you
I know you see it too
Iʼll hold space for you
If you want me to
Yeah Iʼll wait for you
Thereʼs no rushing no

Ah yah yeah
Yeah you make me happier (Yeah)
Ah yah yeah
You make me happier (Ooh Oh Oh)
Ah yah yeah
Yeah you make me happier
Oh oh
Oh oh oh (Iʼm happy we could be more than friends)

Iʼm feeding you this love, can you feed back?
Iʼm giving you these kisses, can you kiss back?
I only re-up so I can relax
Just friends but thereʼs more I can see that
Lines crossed now my walls broken
Mali in my pocket like a token
Niliacha friendship cause kweli you be chosen
So hard to love but youʼre so soft spoken

I could play your favorite song on repeat
I would play your favorite song on repeat
Nikicook then it be your recipe
I could play your favorite song on repeat
And so it goes different colored racks and some gold, cause you wanted gold
Different colored racks for the bro, we be Sipping four
Hoping that the pain dip ka ni Chipo
And hoping that you stay in the places I go

Ah yah yeah
Yeah you make me happier (Yeah)
Ah yah yeah
You make me happier (Ooh Oh Oh)
Ah yah yeah
Yeah you make me happier
Oh oh
Oh oh oh (Iʼm happy we could be more than friends)
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah

Know in my heart Iʼm made for you
Iʼm made for you
Knew from the start youʼd want me too
Youʼd want me too
Cos youʼre running through my mind
Youʼre an angel you came and found me
Oh, oh
Oh oh oh
Yeah Yeah Yeah
Know in my heart Iʼm made for you
Iʼm made for you
Knew from the start youʼd want me too
Youʼd want me too
Cos youʼre running through my mind
Youʼre an angel you came and found me
Oh oh
Oh oh oh (Iʼm happy we could be more than friends)
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah

Oh yeah so we could be (Baby)

So we could be way more than just friends (More, Yah) So
We could be (Baby, baby)
So we could be way more than just friends
Yeah yeah yeah
So we could be (More, More)
So we could be way more than just friends (Yah)
So we could be (Ok, ok)
So we could be way more than just friends
