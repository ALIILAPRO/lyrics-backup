		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Its getting colder now 
 The sun goes down behind 
 The trees that use to show to the worry of your mind (?) 
 Its getting colder now 
 Since you walked out that door 
 The space you left is endless 
 The emptiness is grown 
  
 And all I know its getting colder now 
 I can't stand that you're leaving (?) 
 I know there is no rise 
 And all I know its getting colder now 
 And no one can replace you, I need you by my side 
  
 Is this really over now 
 Is this our last good bye 
 Will nothing left between us 
 Will nothing left to try 
 Is this really over now 
 Just look me in the eyes 
 See that you don't feel it 
 See that I'm not cry (?) 
  
 And all I know its getting colder now 
 I can't stand that you're leaving (?) 
 I know there is no rise 
 And all I know its getting colder now 
 And no one can replace you, I need you by my side 
  
 All I know 
 All I know 
 All I know 
 All I know 
  
 And all I know its getting colder now 
 I can't stand that you're leaving (?) 
 I know there is no rise 
 And all I know its getting colder now 
 And no one can replace you, I need you by my side 
  
 Its getting colder now 
 And no one can replace you, I need you by my side 
 I need you by my side 
 I need you by my side 
 Its getting colder now
