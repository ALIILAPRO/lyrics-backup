		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah

The sun
Yeah, it shines in me
Surfin' sonic vibes
Mission in the deep space
Here they comin', I'm not runnin'
Whoa
Ready this a warning
Warp in over-drive

Oh, we zoom
Stars and light
Yeah, we zoom
Endless night
As we go
Explore new heights
Baby, tell me if you ready

Oh
Through the galaxies, don't ask why
Take the journey y'all, you will find
In the darkest times, look for light
See my strength, I'm strong
Ain't no fear in me
Never say I can't survive
These worlds through space and time
I'll see you no goodbyes
I got hope and we fly
The sun will always shine
Goin' high, high, high
These worlds are yours and mine

Yo
Come on, come on, yeah
Come on, come on, yeah
We up, mm-mm
Come on, come on, yo
Come on, come on, yeah, yeah
Come on, come on
Yo, you're right and I'm right
Come on, na-na
Mm, oh
Come on, come on
Come on, come on

And we off to the beyond
Feel the feelin' in me, this callin'
In my mind, I'm explorin'
Lookin' deeper in me, I'm climbin'
No, I'm never losing this fight, mm
Oh, see, I'm survivin' this flight in life

Oh, we zoom, stars and light
Yeah, we zoom, endless night
As we go explore new heights
Baby, tell me if you ready

Oh
Through the galaxies, don't ask why
Take the journey y'all, you will find
In the darkest times, look for light
See my strength, I'm strong
Ain't no fear in me
Never say I can't survive
These worlds through space and time
I'll see you, no goodbyes
I got hope and we fly
The sun will always shine
Goin' high-high-high
These worlds are yours and mine

Never say I can't survive
These worlds through space and time
I'll see you, no goodbyes
I got hope and we fly
The sun will always shine
Goin' high, high, high
These worlds are yours and mine

Goin' high, high, high
Yo, never know it
Goin' high, high, high
