		  (Don't tell me I'm not good enough)

Times like this, I wish I never existed
Nobody wants to listen
I'm screaming out for help
Times like this, I wish that I could let go
And open up a window
Free to be myself

But then there's you standing over me
Tryna make a fool of me, tryna get the best of me, oh
Then there's you
Tryna shut me out, tryna kick me when I'm down
That ain't gonna stop me now, no

How does it feel to know that I don't care at all?
Your words don't mean a thing at all
I choose to rise, you choose to fall
How does it feel to know that I am capable
Of more than you will ever know? (Ah)

Don't tell me I'm not good enough (oh)
Don't you bring me down (oh)
I'm moving up (oh) and you're over now (oh)
You gave me fire (oh) 
Every time you came around (oh)
My feet are steady on the ground (oh)
And you won't knock me down

No more, no, no
Now I'm unbreakable
More, more, more (oh oh oh)
Now I'm unbreakable

Times like this, I'm picking up the pieces
I'm making up the reasons
Not to tell a soul
Times like this, I'd rather speak to no one
I just wanna move on
And stand up on my own

But then there's you standing over me
Tryna make a fool of me, tryna get the best of me, oh
Then there's you
Tryna shut me out, tryna kick me when I'm down
That ain't gonna stop me now, no

How does it feel to know that I don't care at all?
Your words don't mean a thing at all
I choose to rise, you choose to fall
How does it feel to know that I am capable
Of more than you will ever know?

Don't tell me I'm not good enough (oh)
Don't you bring me down (oh)
I'm moving up (oh) and you're over now (oh)
You gave me fire (oh)
Every time you came around (oh)
My feet are steady on the ground (oh)
And you won't knock me down

No more, no, no
Now I'm unbreakable
More, more, more (oh oh oh)
Now I'm unbreakable (yeah)

I remember getting teased as a kid
'Cause at the place that we lived
We never had it easy, believe me
But that don't excuse the things that we did
Couldn't accept that I was never accepted
Shed so many tears like I fell in depression
But if I changed, I wouldn't get called names
But it was all the same, I was feeling rejected
Putting someone down that's a low blow
What goes around comes around like a yo-yo
Wish that I could stop time like a photo
But we stand strong, bounce back like a pogo

Don't tell me I'm not good enough (what)
Don't you bring me down (oh)
I'm moving up (oh) and you're over now (oh)
You gave me fire (oh)
Every time you came around (oh)
My feet are steady on the ground (oh)
And you won't knock me down

No more, no, no
Now I'm unbreakable
More, more, more (oh oh oh)
Now I'm unbreakable
