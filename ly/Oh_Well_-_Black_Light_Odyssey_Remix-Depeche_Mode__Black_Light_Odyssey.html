		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh you've got a way about you
Oh I know so much about you, Girl

Life won't be the same without you
Life will surely be the one to tell

Listen to what she's trying to tell you
She could be the one who's going to save you

Oh well
Oh well

Life won't be the same without you
Life will surely be the one to tell

It's nothing to feel ashamed about
Nothing I can complain about

Oh well
Oh well
Oh well
Oh well

Listen to what she's trying to tell you
She could be the one who's going to save you

Oh well
Oh well

It's nothing to feel ashamed about
Nothing I can complain about

oh well
Oh well
Oh well
Oh well

Oh you've got a way about you
Oh I know so much about you, Girl

Life won't be the same without you
Life will surely be the one to tell

Oh well
Oh well
Oh well
Oh well
