		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know where that muddy water meets the creek bank
Where the homemade dirt boat launch meets the dunlops to hook the Lund up to the ol' hand crank, so I can pull er on out
I may not be the sharpest hook in that box of tackle, but I sure as hell know where that city limit sign meets the gravel

I'm talking no where, out in the middle of it
Hell ya I was raised there, and damn proud to be from it
If you're looking for a bonfire six feet wide 
cnd a honey hole where they always bite  
I might know where it is that you can't find
If you wanna get there, you gotta go nowhere

I know where that cugust summer sun sets
cnd them good ol boys post up, in their ford and Chevrolet trucks on the weekend, with them tailgates down
I may not be the biggest truck on them lines of travel, but I sure as hell know where that city limit sign meets the gravel

I'm talking no where, out in the middle of it
Hell ya I was raised there, and damn proud to be from it
If you're looking for a bonfire six feet wide 
cnd a honey hole where they always bite  
I might know where it is that you can't find
If you wanna get there, you gotta go nowhere

I'm talkin 4 by 4 
In the sticks with a 6
2 stroke on oak
cnd flick with a Bic
c little moonshine fire fix
Belly full of catch
Out here We do it like this 

I may not be the sharpest hook in that box of tackle, but I sure as hell know where that city limit sign meets the gravel

I'm talking no where, out in the middle of it
Hell ya I was raised there, and damn proud to be from it
If you're looking for a bonfire six feet wide 
cnd a honey hole where they always bite  
I might know where it is that you can't find
If you wanna get there, you gotta go nowhere
