		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Diamonds dripping down my throat
Why's it gotta be so addictive
Now I'm chasing after antidotes
For anything that tastes like a quick fix
'Cause days like this, no, nothing feels right
Nothing sticks I can't get out my mind
Tell myself to let it go
Oh, I wish that I could let it go

It's hard to keep it down now
But I need to let the fever sweat out

Now I can't stand still, should be running free
And all these nightmares used to be daydreams
Got my eyes wide open
Don't wanna care bout nothin'
Wish I could know less just go back to bed
'Cause all my pink skies have been painted red
If this is real don't show it, I wanna run blindfolded

Reality's a bitter taste
But fantasy can be so deceiving
All my good intentions gone to waste
I'll do anything to shut out this feeling
I can't go back, no, I've gone too far
I miss the way, that my eyes filled with stars
Tell myself to let it go but I don't
I wish that I could let it go

Now I can't stand still should be running free
And all these nightmares used to be daydreams
Got my eyes wide open
Don't wanna care bout nothin'
Wish I could know less just go back to bed
'Cause all my pink skies have been painted red
If this is real don't show it, I wanna run blindfolded

(Run blindfolded)

Take a sip have it anyway you want it
Drink it in let us finish what ya started
Throw a fit yeah I guess I should called it
Now it's stolen
I'm blindfolded

Stand still should be running free
And all these nightmares used to be daydreams
Got my eyes wide open
Don't wanna care bout nothin'
Wish I could know less just go back to bed
'Cause all my pink skies have been painted red
If this is real don't show it, I wanna run blindfolded
