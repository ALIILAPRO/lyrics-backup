		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let Icarus plummet as sun melts his wax
I'm gonna touch the sky much linger than that
On the wings of Eros I'll stretch them wide
Upon the winds of fortune I'm ready to glide
And I will hold the clouds

Yes I'll breath them in
I'm gonna be able to reach the heavens
On the wings of Eros I'll stretch them wide
Upon the winds of fortune I'm ready to glide
So now that you floating upon my crest

And learning to be completely weightless
You'll see though your body sleeps 
Your soul will never rest
And I see the opening before me
The womb to be no longer my home

Toward the unknown contractions propel me
I am released to be my own
I'm kicking inside feel me
On the wings of Eros I'll stretch them wide
Upon the wings of fortune I'm ready to glide
