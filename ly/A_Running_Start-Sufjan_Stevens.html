		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I imagine myself peaceful on the fire escape
Head first, my hands inside my t-shirt, as we run away
So now we have a running start
My body moves in mystic ways
I cross my arms to shield my heart
As everything turns into waves

I see the light upon the lake
The silver moon, the water snake
A pair of eyes, a gentle breeze
Forgotten tales, a wild beast
I know, I know the time has come
To ask you for a kiss
Don't go, my lovely pantomime
Receive of me my only wish

If I align myself with Pisces in a funny way
Can you, my lover, kiss my bracelet
And my shoulder blades
We've always had a running start
I jump between the trampolines
You throw your arms around my heart
As if to say you're all I need

The winter pines, the lonely drake
The light beneath the frozen lake
A pair of eyes, a gentle breeze
Forgotten tales, a wild beast
I know, I know the time has come
To ask you for a kiss
Don't go, my lovely pantomime
Receive of me my only wish
