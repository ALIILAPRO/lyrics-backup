		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And so, that is a nice little tangle
If I put this in the language
Of oriental philosophy and religion
It would be something like this

The Buddha said that wisdom
Must come only from the
Abandonment of selfish craving, or desire
The Buddha said that wisdom
Must come only from the
Abandonment of selfish craving, or desire

One who abandons that desire attains nirvana
Which is supreme peace liberation
Nirvana means, in Sanskrit blow out
That is, exhale the breath exhale the breath
The opposite, dеsire, is to breathe in
Now, if you brеathe in, and hold it
You lose your breath
But if you breathe out, it comes back to you
It comes back to you

The Buddha said that wisdom
Must come only from the
Abandonment of selfish craving, or desire
The Buddha said that wisdom
Must come only from the
Abandonment of selfish craving, or desire

So the principle here is if you want life
Don't cling to it let go
Let go
But the problem is if I desire not to desire
Is that not already desire?
How can I desire not to desire?
How can I surrender myself
When myself is precisely an urge to hold on
To cling?
To cling to life, to continue to survive
To survive to survive

The Buddha said that wisdom
Must come only from the
Abandonment of selfish craving, or desire
The Buddha said that wisdom
Must come only from the
Abandonment of selfish craving, or desire

I can see rationally
That by clinging to myself
I may strangle myself
I may be like a person who has a bad habit
As a result of which he is committing suicide
And he knows that but can't give it up
Because the means of death are so sweet
