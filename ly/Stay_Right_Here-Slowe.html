		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can you believe it? When you think of where we've been
It feels extraordinary to me
Now all that really matters, before the moment shatters
I know we’re right where we should be

And we could stay right here
We could stay right here
We could stay right here
We could stay right here

How did the years seem to pass us by?
Guess it was well worth the try
Because there’s something in our comfort that’s hard to replicate
I know just where I wanna stay

And we could stay right here
We could stay right here
We could stay right here
We could stay right here

Don’t want you to stray from me
Don’t know what you do to me
Don’t want you away from me
Faithfully, stay with me

And we could stay right here
We could stay right here
We could stay right here
We could stay right here

(Don’t want you to stray from me
Don’t know what you do to me
Don’t want you away from me
Faithfully, stay with me )
