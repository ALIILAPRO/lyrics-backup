		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Said you came down
From the valley to see me
But I swear you live down the street
Everyday now, it's a battle to see it
Why I left the way it used to be
Don't mind this feeling
I still want you next to me
You know you never get to see me
'Cause we're growing opposed
The more I see
The less I feel I need to know
But what I said from the start is
I only mean to be honest
But I can't stop to be your man
I'll never be the muse in your demise
Can't keep you waiting
'Cause what you seek
is an ocean deeper
than this wave that was built to fade
I just keep making my own way
'Cause what you seek
is an ocean deeper
than this wave that was built to fade
I just keep making my own way
Said you came down
From the valley to see me
But I swear you live down the street
Everyday now it's a battle to see it
Why I left the way it used to be
Don't mind this feeling
I still want you next to me
Said you came down
From the valley to see me
But I swear you live down the street
