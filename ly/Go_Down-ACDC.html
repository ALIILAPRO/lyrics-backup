		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ruby, Ruby, where you been so long
Done took to drinkin' whiskey
Baby since you been gone
Ain't no one I know do it as good as you

Lickin' on that lickin' stick the way you do
You got the lips to make a strong man weak
And a heathen pray
Tell you ain't just the way you speak

You know it's just the way you go down
Go down, go down, go down, go down
Go down, go down, go down, go down

Mary, Mary, you're the one for me
And the way you hum
Sting like a bumble bee
I'll be around to see you 'bout half past ten

Ain't felt this good
Since I don't know when
You got the touch that I need so much
In your finger tips

I got the honey that ya love to taste
On those lovely lips so go down
Go down, go down, go down, go down
Go down, go down, go down, go down

Baby rub it on
Why' know it's sticky and sweet
And it's been so long
And no else got a touch like you

I let you do the things to me
I let no other woman do
Feels good, feels good, oh yeah
You do it like you should

I loved you so much
Make me so glad I'm a man
Go down, go down, go down, go down
Go down, go down, go down, go down
Go down, go down, go down, go down
Go down, go down, go down, go down
Go down, go down, go down, go down
Go down, go down, go down, go down
Go down, go down, go down, go down
Go down, go down, go down, go down
Go down, go down, go down
