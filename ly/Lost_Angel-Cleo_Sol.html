		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was lost
But it's over now
I can change
I choose faith over doubt
'Cause I know
My time will come
And through love
Our souls unite
Our gods may be different
But they see us all the same
I can see
That I cannot exist
Without your presence

I was lost
(But it's over now)
I can change
I choose faith over doubt
'Cause I know
My time will come
And through love
Our souls unite
Our gods may be different
But they see us all the same
I can see
That I cannot exist
Without your presence

Only up above
Solely up above
I find my peace
Only up above

And I need my angel now
In us (I need my angel now)
When you're lost, look for an angel (angel now)
Lost angel, fightin' for your love (I need my angel now)
And when your heart is torn
Means your soul is born (angel now)
It means you got a conscience
There ain't no other substance (I need my angel now)
Hold your joy, hold your peace
Hold your love, hold your trust
You ain't ever gonna move if you don't get up (angel now)
When they try to break you down, get straight back up
For yourself, no one else (I need my angel now)
Don't be afraid to ask for help

(Angel now)
'Cause you're strong, you're not alone (I need my angel now)
I need my angel now
The angels are smilin' down, so pure (angel now)
Guide and protect us
When our soul is feelin' under pressure (I need my angel now)
Don't give up
No, don't, don't give up (angel now)
No (I need my angel now)

I was lost
But it's over now
I can change
I choose faith over doubt
'Cause I know
My time will come
And through love
Our souls unite

I was lost (only up above)
But it's over now
