		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ay, she already chose, why you trippin'?
She ain't that significant
Used to have a gimmick
Glad I never went big with it
Now I got the big wigs spendin'
I got Titos on the rocks
With some cranberry mixed in with it, ooh
She got a one bed one bath
And it smells like incense in it

I got a chick and she a bit dim-witted
But she real pretty and she slim thick with it
She let the whole imprint hit it
Now I'm cool I ain't got no real interest in it
I know my innocence gone
'Cause it's 80 proof liquor all up in my system
I'ont jerk it when I'm finna get some
And it paid off for me 'cause I'm finishing strong
But I don't let the kids live long
'Cause the utilities and the renter's insurance is enough already
Tryna' do the right thing but I bluffed already
Tryna' take it slow but I cuffed already

She already chose, why you trippin'?
She ain't that significant
Used to have a gimmick
Glad I never went big with it
Now I got the big wigs spendin'
I got Titos on the rocks
With some cranberry mixed in with it, ooh
She got a one bed one bath
And it smells like incense in it

Dirty clothes on the floor
Polaroids on the door
Told her we should talk more
But I'm going on tour
Psych major she a sophomore
Honda Accord on the parking deck top floor
Know its uncalled for
Got her on all fours 
We was playing Uno she said, "Draw four"
I said, "What you wearing drawers for?"
Bad biddies every city
Know that we got all sorts
My dawgs ride for me, yeah, they on board
Treat the 2fo' beat just like a longboard
Fire code, at the show
They want an encore
Ay, ay, they want an encore

She already chose, why you trippin'?
She ain't that significant
Used to have a gimmick
Glad I never went big with it
Now I got the big wigs spendin'
I got Titos on the rocks
With some cranberry mixed in with it, ooh
She got a one bed one bath
And it smells like incense in it
