		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Never gonna let you go away
You belong to me
And I'm never gonna let you go
Never gonna let you go away
We were meant to be in love, love

Take your time, Mark just sing it for 'em
I regret the moment, when I heard you say
You don't want no part of me no more
But I'm so glad, that you changed your mind
You're staying in my life forever more, forever more
'Cause I'll never

Never gonna let you go away
You belong to me
And I'm never gonna let you go
Never gonna let you go away
We were meant to be in love, love

Now I must admit, that I did you wrong
Hiding all your tears
When you cried for me to come back home
And then you tell me
Part-time loving just won't do
I can't say a word
Oh, I must have been a fool
But this time, this time, I'll never

Never gonna let you go away
You belong to me
And I'm never gonna let you go
Never gonna let you go away
We were meant to be in love, love

Now girl, I know
We've had our share of ups and downs
But we can make it, if we try
(only if we try)
And your friends are telling you
That I'm not the one for you
But I'll never, no no never, let you go

Never gonna let you go away
You belong to me
And I'm never gonna let you go
Never gonna let you go away
We were meant to be in love, love

Never gonna let you go away
You belong to me
And I'm never gonna let you go
Never gonna let you go away
We were meant to be in love, love
