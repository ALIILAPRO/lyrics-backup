		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Armour let it through
Borne the arboretic truth you kept posing
Sat down in the suit
Fixed on up, it wasn't you by finished closing
Ramble in the roots
Had the marvel, moved the proof be kneeled fine's glowing
Storing up the clues
It had its sullen blue bruised through by showing
Settle past a patience
Where wishes and your will are spilling pictures
Water's running through
In the valley where we grew to write this this scripture

Never gonna break, never gonna break
Never gonna break, never gonna break
Not for a part in any gamut of the dark

Doubled in the toes
Annex it, it minute closed in the morning
Did not lose it in the stack's stow
I'ma lay that call back on you
You know it won't beseech you
We're laying in an open field
I will let you grow
No need to know this
So carry on, my dear
What is clear up in the daylight is we're hung here
Fall is coming soon
A new year for the moon and the Hmong here

Never gonna break, never gonna break
Never gonna break, never gonna break
All that it seems
Bellows tracing through the streams
Never gonna break, never gonna break
Never gonna break, never gonna break
All at its seams
Swallows swelling for the beams
