		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was pulling out my hair
The day I got the deal, chemically calm
Was I meant to feel happy
That my life was just about to change?

One life pretending to be
The cat who got the cream
Oh, everybody said, "Marina is a dreamer"
People like to tell you

What you're gonna be is not my problem if you don't see what I see
And I do not give a damn if you don't believe
My problem is my problem that I never am happy
It's my problem, it's my problem on how fast I will succeed

Are you satisfied with an average life?
Do I need to lie to make my way in life?

High achiever, don't you see?
Baby, nothing comes for free
They say I'm a control freak
Driven by a greed to succeed
Nobody can stop me

'Cause it's my problem if I wanna pack up and run away
It's my business if I feel the need to smoke and drink and sway
It's my problem, it's my problem if I feel the need to hide
And it's my problem if I have no friends and feel I want to die

Are you satisfied with an average life?
Do I need to lie to make my way in life?
Are you satisfied with an easy ride?
Once you cross the line will you be satisfied?

Sad inside, in this life
Unsatisfied, praying
Sad inside, in this life
Unsatisfied, waiting

Are you satisfied with an average life?
Do I need to lie to make my way in life?
Are you satisfied with an easy ride?
Once you cross the line will you be satisfied?

Black, white (are you satisfied, are you satisfied?)
Black, white (are you satisfied, are you satisfied?)
Black, white (are you satisfied, are you satisfied?)
Black, white (are you satisfied, are you satisfied?)
