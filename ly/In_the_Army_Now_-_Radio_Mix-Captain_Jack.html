		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A vacation in a foreign land
Uncle Sam does the best he can
You're in the army now
Oh, oh, you're in the army now

Now you remember what the draft-man said
Nothing to do all day but stay in bed
You're in the army now
Oh, oh, you're in the army now

You'll be the hero of the neighborhood
Nobody knows that you left for good
You're in the army now
Oh, oh, you're in the army now
You're in the army now
Oh, oh, you're in the army now

Handgrenades flying over your head
Missiles flying over your head
If you want to survive get out of bed
You're in the army now
Oh, oh, you're in the army now

Shots ring out in the dead of night
The sergeant calls, "Stand up and fight!"
You're in the army now
Oh, oh, you're in the army now

Oh, oh, you're in the army now
You're in the army now
Oh, oh, you're in the army now
Oh, oh, you're in the army now

You're in the army now
in the army now

Oh, oh, you're in the army, in the army now
you're in the army now
Oh, oh, you're in the army now
