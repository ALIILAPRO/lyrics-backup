		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh
Hee-hee
Hoo-hoo
Hee
Hoo-hoo
Hee
Ooh
Oh
Chick, chicka

You know I can't get away from you, girl
(You've got me shakin')
I need all of the things you do, girl
(My body's aching)
Come on, baby, get up, and rock it to the rhythm
Put out your heart to me
And, lady, let me set you free

Our love will shine at the dawn of a brand new feeling
Just take your time and you'll see that the magic's on its way
Girl, if we try, we can set all our senses reeling
That's the day
You know I got the hots tonight
Night, girl, girl
Hee
Hoo

I go heart beating just for you, girl
(You've got me shakin')
I've tried all but I can't get you, girl
(My body's aching)
Come on, baby, get up, and rock it to the rhythm
(Rock it, baby)
Put out your heart to me
And, lady, let me set you free (let me set you free, girl)

Our love will shine at the dawn of a brand new feeling
Just take your time and you'll see that the magic's on its way
Girl, if we try, we can set all our senses reeling
That's the day
You know I got the hots tonight
Tonight, girl, girl

Baby, the love that is waiting inside your temper (hoo-hee, hee-hee)
Show me the passion I feel when I'm by your side (oh, girl)
This is the time to discover the dream we're living (hee)
Girl, can't you feel it?
Time of your life (aow)
(Ooh)
(Chicka, chicka)
(Hee)

(Don't you know?)
Our love will shine at the dawn of a brand new feeling
Just take your time and you'll see that the magic's on its way
Girl, if we try, we can set all our senses reeling
That's the day
You know I got the hots tonight
Our love will shine at the dawn of a brand new feeling (girl, yeah)
Just take your time and you'll see that the magic's on its way
Girl, if we try, we can set all our senses reeling
That's the day
You know I got the hots tonight
Our love will shine at the dawn of a brand new feeling (no other, no other)
Just take your time and you'll see that the magic's on its way
Girl, if we try, we can set all our senses reeling
That's the day
