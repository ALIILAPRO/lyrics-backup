		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The world is burning, I got worms in my brains
Gonna bleach my eyebrows, change my name
The world is burning and I laugh at the blaze
Gonna bleach my eyebrows, change my name

Play my life, like a video game
I don't mind, I'm driving through flames
And I'm riding through the desert with the sword on my back
I mean, like, what the fuck, monster truck, wanna go fast?

Orange juice and toothpaste
I roll around in blue paint
Thinking of new ways that I can self-sabotage
Oh, well, it's too late
My host body mutates
My head spins, my neck breaks
I love a self-sabotage

Brand new day, got a brand new grin (oh-oh)
Got a colony of ants underneath my skin (oh-oh)
My bones decay, now I'm gelatin (oh-oh)
I swear I'm better, swear I'm better
Miss parasite possessor

The world is burning, I got worms in my brains
Gonna bleach my eyebrows, change my name
The world is burning and I laugh at the blaze
Gonna bleach my eyebrows, change my name

Play my life, like a video game
I don't mind, I'm driving through flames
And I'm riding through the desert with the sword on my back
I mean, like, what the fuck, monster truck, wanna go fast?

Nothing matters, and I'll be fine
I keep my besties in big wheelies on my mind
I watch it splatter, into the sky
She's made of red-raspberry jelly and all American pie

Brand new day, got a brand new grin (oh-oh)
Got a colony of ants underneath my skin (oh-oh)
My bones decay, now I'm gelatin (oh-oh)
I swear I'm better, swear I'm better
Miss parasite possessor

The world is burning, I got worms in my brains
Gonna bleach my eyebrows, change my name
The world is burning and I laugh at the blaze
Gonna bleach my eyebrows, change my name

Play my life, like a video game, I don't mind
I'm driving through flames
And I'm riding through the desert with the sword on my back
I mean, like, what the fuck, monster truck, wanna go fast?
