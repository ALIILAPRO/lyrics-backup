		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is the end, I can't take anymore
This is where I'm fuckin' drawing the line
You talk a great game, trying to make a big name
Soon you're gonna run out of time
I've got news for you, I got nothing to lose
If you were smart you'd simply run and you'd hide
You're such a dumb punk, such a fuckin' weak chump
Don't have the balls to look me dead in the eyes

Boom!

You're a, you're a, you're a

You're a fake motherfucker, I hate you, motherfucker
I'll break you, motherfucker, you're mine
You're a joke, motherfucker, you gloat but you're a sucker
Such a fuckin' waste of my time
You smile and wave with your borrowed fame
But everybody sees through the lies
You're a fake motherfucker, you're dated, motherfucker
And you're never gonna get what is mine

Fake!
You're a fuckin' fake

What's in a name that could truly make me so sick
Think about the shit that you say
You'll wish you never crossed me, you had me then you lost me
You're losing all your bark when you beg
You've got a big mouth, makes me want to tear it out
Really don't have nothing to say
I'm not your scapegoat, ram it down your damn throat
For me it's just another day!

You're a, you're a, you're a

You're a fake motherfucker, I hate you, motherfucker
I'll break you, motherfucker, you're mine
You're a joke, motherfucker, you gloat but you're a sucker
Such a fuckin' waste of my time
You smile and wave with your borrowed fame
But everybody sees through the lies
You're a fake motherfucker, you're dated, motherfucker
And you're never gonna get what is mine

Fake!
You're such a, you're such a
You're such a, you're such a fake
You're a fuckin' fake
You're such a fuckin' fake
You're just a fake, fake, fake, fake

You're a fake motherfucker, I hate you, motherfucker
I'll break you, motherfucker, you're mine
You're a joke, motherfucker, you gloat but you're a sucker
Such a fuckin' waste of my time
You smile and wave with your borrowed fame
But everybody sees through the lies
You're a fake motherfucker, you're dated, motherfucker
And you're never gonna get what is mine

Fake!
You're a fuckin' fake
You're such a fuckin' fake
You're just a fake, fake, fake, fake
You're such a fuckin' fake!
