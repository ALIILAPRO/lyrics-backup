		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Oh, woah, woah, woah, Woah)

Oh, I wish you'd stop and talk to me
How I wish you gone and walk away
Oh, I wish you'd stop and talk to me
Oh, I wish you'd stop and walk with me

Oh, where'd you go? I wanna know
Don't leave me stranded, leave me cold
Soul to be sold soul to be sold
Let me know, it's getting old
Who have we told? I don't know under control
Under control

We don't need a reason
You part of the reason
That I can't feel it anymore
Body on the floor there's blood on the floor
And you at my door something can't ignore

Oh, I wish you'd stop and talk to me
How I wish you gone and walk away
Oh, I wish you'd stop and talk to me
Oh, I wish you'd stop and walk with me

Oh, where'd you go? I wanna know
Don't leave me stranded, leave me cold
Soul to be sold soul to be sold
Let me know, it's getting old
Who have we told? I don't know under control
Under control

Walk away i don't wanna talk today
I can't do this every day
I don't wanna go insane
I don't wanna go insane
But the second that you talk to me
Is the second that I entertain
Is the second that I entertain

Oh, I wish you'd stop and talk to me
How I wish you gone and walk away
Oh, I wish you'd stop and talk to me
Oh, I wish you'd stop and walk with me

Oh, where'd you go? I wanna know
Don't leave me stranded, leave me cold
Soul to be sold soul to be sold
Let me know, it's getting old
Who have we told? I don't know under control
Under control

Oh, I wish you'd stop and talk to me
How I wish you gone and walk away
Oh, I wish you'd stop and talk to me
Oh, I wish you'd stop and walk with me
