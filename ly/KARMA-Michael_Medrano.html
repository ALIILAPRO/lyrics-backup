		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm on your lips you're on the tip of my uhhn 
I got you heated, caught you slippin your tongue 
You got a taste and now you're beggin for more 
I'm only gettin started baby, come on

Everything I want comes right back to me
Every tongue that talks shit fall to their knees
Karma is a drug got you like a fiend 
If you want my love, you know where I'll be

Find me on the dance floor all night 
We could be together till the first light 
Ain't nobody better at what you like 
I can make you feel feel 
feel feel feel
Uhhn

Yeah, karma 
Give it to me
Yeah, karma 
Give it to me 

You look for something better, nothing compares 
You try to chase it but I'm already there 
I'm in your speakers, I'm the clothes that you wear 
I'm only gettin started baby, come here

Everything I want comes right back to me
Every tongue that talks shit fall to their knees
Karma is a drug got you like a fiend 
If you want my love, you know where I'll be

Find me on the dance floor all night 
We could be together till the first light 
Ain't nobody better at what you like 
I can make you feel feel 
feel feel feel
Uhhn


Yeah, karma 
Give it to me
Yeah, karma 
Give it to me 
(Give it to me)

I heard your record, it was dick in the mouth
That silver spoon ain't really helpin you out
I got you gaggin, got you kissin the ground
You want me gone, I always come back around
I always come back around
Yeah!

Give it to me
