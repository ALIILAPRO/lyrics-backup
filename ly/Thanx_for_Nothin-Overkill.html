		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ha ha hah!
Sick and tired of the same old shit
Fighting battles that I just can't win
How can you tell me what it is you want
When you don't even know yourself?
Live your life one death at a time
See the road, can't read the signs
All the wrongs just can't be right
Hear my bark before you feel my bite

If you could only see what you wanted us to see.
If we could only be what you wanted us to be.
I ain't fallin' for the tricks the schemes, the same old lies
When it's over cry for sympathy
Don't ask why.

Thanks for nothin'
Yeah I said nothin'
Next time better think before you speak!

I dunno if I can take no more
I'm baggin' it I'm out the door
How can you say you know what I mean
As you're pissin' all over my life?
Time is precious, time is mine
Waitin' here would just be fine
Bless my soul, time has come
Tide has turned! See Dick run!

If you could only see what you wanted us to be
If you could only be what you wanted us to see
I ain't fallin' for the tricks the schemes, the same old lies
When it's over cry for sympathy
Don't ask why!

Thanks for nothin'
Yeah I said nothin'
Next time better think before you speak!

You never think before you speak
Sometime think before you speak

I've been watching you
Barely stand to look you in the face
All tolerance not popularity
There is someone here to take your place

Why don't you think before you speak!
You never think before you speak!

If you could only see what you wanted us to be
If you could only be what you wanted us to see
I ain't fallin' for the tricks, the schemes, the same old lies
When it's over cry for sympathy
Don't ask why!

Thanks for nothing!
Next time better think before you...
Speak!..
