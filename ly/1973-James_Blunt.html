		  Simona
You're getting older
Your journey's been etched
On your skin

Simona
Wish I had known that
What seemed so strong
Has been and gone

I would call you up every Saturday night
And we'd both stay out 'til the morning light
And we sang, here we go again
And though time goes by
I will always be
In a club with you in 1973
Singing, here we go again

Simona
Wish I was sober
So I could see clearly now
The rain has gone

Simona
I guess it's over
My memory plays our tune
The same old song

I would call you up every Saturday night
And we'd both stay out 'til the morning light
And we sang, here we go again
And though time goes by
I will always be
In a club with you in 1973
Singing, here we go again

I would call you up every Saturday night
And we'd both stay out 'til the morning light
And we sang, here we go again
And though time goes by
I will always be
In a club with you in 1973
Singing, here we go again

I would call you up every Saturday night
And we'd both stay out 'til the morning light
And we sang, here we go again
And though time goes by
I will always be
In a club with you in 1973
Singing, here we go again

And though time goes by
I will always be
In a club with you in 1973
