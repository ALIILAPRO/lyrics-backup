		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I couldn't believe it
Soon as I bought my Cuban chain she called me back
Soon as I ice out on my wrist she got attached
And she on dick, she see this Glizzy got attachments
For all these bitch ass niggas that try to circle back
Slugga got hit up in the party, did a dance
Sizzlac dead and they don't post him on the 'Gram
Say free my niggas, swing his knife all in the can
You see that cut, and couldn't shake, he want 'em dead

Boy play with me we got Glocks and BMD's
And there's a difference from a robber and a thief
Taliban ain't doin' no drugs but when he kill shit he get geeked
I knew that nigga was dead when he popped up on my feed
My opps say Crippin', but lately they have to bleed
See, up that, Glock right on my lap not under the seat
Free my nigga he a nightmare, he a dream
Hit da floor, pray for my niggas for the mail they won't receive
They got my nigga behind the wall
And crodie killed so much shit that he had to find the Lord
And murda, murda, murda we broke more shit than the law
Lil' bitch I hit the beat and walk that shit just like a park
On lil' bro, put them youngins in the car and tell 'em go
Wrap the plug, if we can't get to him wrap his lil bro
From the 6ix, but I got thirty-six all in the brick
My OG he so goofy, he ain't know that I was hit

I couldn't believe it
Soon as I bought my Cuban chain she called me back
Soon as I ice out on my wrist she got attached
And she on dick, she see this Glizzy got attachments
For all these bitch ass niggas that try to circle back
Slugga got hit up in the party, did a dance
Sizzlac dead and they don't post him on the 'Gram
Say free my niggas, swing his knife all in the can
You see that cut, and couldn't shake, he want 'em dead

Uh, thought he was a shooter 'til he got his ass shot (bah)
Ain't runnin' out of money, bitch, we runnin' outta opps
Just caught a play for ten thousand, I spent that shit on Glocks
He spent ten on his chain, he shoulda saved it for a box
Swank hopped out with that ARP and knocked him out his socks
He called my phone laughin' told me, "Watch that shit on Fox"
They thought 'cause I got money that the murders gon' stop
Nah, I'm on that front line in the trenches with my 'ocks (yeah)
Ain't stoppin' 'til they all dead I put that on the code
My niggas down to roll, doin' life without parole
That fake ass gangster image he portrayed got exposed
When he went in front the judge and he told

I couldn't believe it
Soon as I bought my Cuban chain she called me back
Soon as I ice out on my wrist she got attached
And she on dick, she see this Glizzy got attachments
For all these bitch ass niggas that try to circle back
Slugga got hit up in the party, did a dance
Sizzlac dead and they don't post him on the 'Gram
Say free my niggas, swing his knife all in the can
You see that cut, and couldn't shake, he want 'em dead
