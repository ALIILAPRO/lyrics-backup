		<p>
		  All eyes on we
Let's run down dreams of ecstasy (yeah, yeah, yeah)
September breeze
All clear blue skies of poetry (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Seven seas
We're floating by the palm trees (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Come live your dreams in
Those simple letters, L-S
Those simple letters, L-S
Those simple letters, L-S

L
S
D

Uh
I'm here on Venus
I just can't stop the feeling
I see you
I'm here on Venus
I just can't stop the feeling
Oh-oh-oh
I'm here on Venus
I just can't stop the feeling
I'm here on Venus
I just can't stop the feeling

Welcome to the wonderful world of!
I'm here on Venus
It's not what they told you, it's-
It's what you told yourself!
I'm here on Venus (woo!)
Welcome to the wonderful world of!
I'm here on Venus

People of Earth, boys and girls, children of all ages
Welcome to the wonderful world of
Labrinth, Sia and Diplo
