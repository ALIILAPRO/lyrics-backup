		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Heart could find someone like you
You see the real me, no in betweens
I had nowhere to hide
You took away the walls around me
Made me feel safe to share the truth

I see the heavens open
A heart that once was broken
Is holding nothing back
Now that I found you

You hold me like a prayer
You touch me everywhere
A lifetime just ain't enough to love you true
Now that I found you

Believe, we're meant to be
Our chemistry will last forever
And through the years we'll see some tears
We'll conquer fears together we will grow

Looking in your eyes they tell me
I no longer have to be alone

I see the heavens open
A heart that once was broken
Is holding nothing back
Now that I found you

You hold me like a prayer
You touch me everywhere
A lifetime just ain't enough to love you true
Now that I found you

You, you see me
The real me
You believe in me

I see the heavens open
A heart that once was broken
Is holding nothing back
Now that I found you

You hold me like a prayer
You touch me everywhere
A lifetime just ain't enough to love you true
Now that I found you
