		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Is there life still inside of you?
Are there dreams that you're waiting to come true?
Have you been to the country fair?
By the looks of it you're barely there
I feel you slipping up
I feel that you're giving up
Giving up on you
Giving up on me
I'm giving up on you
You're giving up on me
We've given up on us
Have you got something to prove?
The bath is drawn, all hope removed
Locked away in your sunset eyes
A beautiful place where love crawls to die
I feel you slipping up
I feel that you're giving up
Giving up on you
Giving up on me
I'm giving up on you
You're giving up on me
Don't leave me alone
I know it's hard to stay
But don't throw yourself away
I know you've got to go
I wish there was another way
You've thrown yourself away
Giving up on you
Giving up on me
I'm giving up on you
You're giving up on me
We've given up on us
