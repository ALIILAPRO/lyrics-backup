		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I see you walk down the aisle
Everytime I notice your beautiful smile
You probably don't want anything from me
But I think of how it would be
If I put my arms around you daily
Can I get your number maybe
I’m in love with you baby
And everytime I see your eyes
I feel like I’m in paradise, in paradise

I´ve been waiting for a long time
But I finally want you to be mine
Everytime I look into your eyes
Oh baby I feel like, like I´m in paradise, paradise

I’d love to know what’s on your mind
Do you feel the same way cause it feels so right
Please just let me know
The feeling won’t let go
I think of how it would be
If I’d put my arms around you daily
Can I get your number maybe
I’m in love with you baby
And everytime I see your eyes
I feel like I’m in paradise, in paradise

I´ve been waiting for a long time
But I finally want you to be mine
Everytime I look into your eyes
Oh baby I feel like, like I´m in paradise, paradise

I’m so in love, can’t wait no more, no more
I feel like I’m in paradise
I’m so in love can’t wait no more
I feel like I’m in paradise, in paradise

I´ve been waiting for a long time
But I finally want you to be mine
Everytime I look into your eyes
Oh baby I feel like, like I´m in paradise
I´ve been waiting for a long time
But I finally want you to be mine
Everytime I look into your eyes
Oh baby I feel like, like I´m in paradise, paradise
I’m so in love, can’t wait no more, no more
I feel like I’m in paradise
I’m so in love can’t wait no more
I feel like I’m in paradise
