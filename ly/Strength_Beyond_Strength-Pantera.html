		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There is nothing 
No education 
No family life to open my arms to 
You'd say that my job is today, yet gone tomorrow 
I'll be broke in a gutter 
I know the opinion 
A broken record 
Fuck you and your college dream 
Fact is we're stronger than all 

You're working for perfect bodies
Perfect minds and perfect neighbors 
But I'm helping to legalize dope on your pristine streets
And I'm making a fortune 
You're muscle and gall 
Naive at best 
I'm bone, brain and cock 
Deep down stronger than all 

A sad state of affairs 
A crippled America 
A pipe dream 
Buttfucked 
Immune 
Stronger than all 

We've grown into a monster 
An arrogant, explosive motherfuck 
Hard as a rock 
Shut like a lock 
The president in submission 
He holds out his hand on your television and 
Draws back a stump 
It's too late for some, far too late 

Far too late!

Hail kings 
The new kings 
Stronger than all 

A simple process to legalize 
There would not be a choice but to take our side 
Be there no question of certain strengths 
Know this intention 
Forever stronger than all 
Stronger than all
