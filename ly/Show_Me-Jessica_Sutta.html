		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Say say what you wanna say say
Tell it to me every day day
But if you don't show me
Words words all they are is words words
Stupid poetry and verse verse do do you even know me

That first thing that I saw in your eyes
Did you mean, was it only lies, only lies
'Bout, 'bout have you ever thought
About how this is supposed to go, yeah
Do do you know, do you, oh

Love is not a gimme gimme,
If you really with me you gotta
Show me, show me
Show me, show me
Tell it to me with your mouth
But when it all comes down
You gotta show me show me
Show me, show me
You say it feels right say it to me all night
I don't think you understand
Love is not a gimmie gimmie
If you really with me, gotta show me
Show me, show me, show show me
Love, show me love, yeah

Eyes eyes eyes open up your eyes eyes
Don't hide what you got inside inside
If you wanna know me
Hey hey I'm not gonna stay stay
Kick it with you night and day day
No if you don't show me
Everything hidden in your heart
All your fears every single part, single part
'Bout, 'bout have you ever thought
About how this is supposed to go, yeah
So do you know, do you, oh

Love is not a gimme gimme,
If you really with me you gotta
Show me, show me
Show me, show me
Tell it to me with your mouth
But when it all comes down
You gotta show me show me
Show me, show me
You say it feels right say it to me all night
I don't think you understand
Love is not a gimmie gimmie
If you really with me, gotta show me
Show me, show me, show show me
Love, show me love
Show me love, show me love
Show, show me

Everything I got is everything you need
Everything you want is inside of me

Love is not a gimme gimme,
If you're really with me gotta
Show me, show me
Tell it to me with your mouth
But when it all comes down
You gotta show me show me
Show me, show me
You can say it feels right say it to me all night
I don't think you understand
Love is not a gimmie gimmie
If you really with me, gotta show me
Show me, show me, show show me
Love, show me love
Show me love, show me love
Show, show me love

Show me love
