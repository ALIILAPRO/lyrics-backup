		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Yeah)
(Call my brother Oomp)

Coming from the cracks and the crevices
Lookin' for a way back home (ooh)
Bae, I need your lovin', it's my medicine
Lookin' for a way back home (I feel like I'm fuckin' talking to myself, way back)

Today, I really got to know my feelings very well
When someone mentions love, it's gotta do with you (hey)
It's just a Sunday night, I'm 'round at my address
You need to give me time for me to look my best
It stuck out to me just when you knew who you are
You start to look around the place and then things fall apart
If I walk out my house, the more you still feel, listening (way back)
'Cause I came to tell you

I just walked ten miles
And every stop along my journey
I had wished that you might follow
You were never there behind me
I've got five minutes 'til curfew
And I'm still waitin' here for you
When you enter out the shadows
We can find our way together, maybe (hey)

Coming from the cracks and the crevices
Lookin' for a way back home (heart of gold, way back)
I swear to God, you got angel wings, you're heaven sent
Lookin' for a way back home (lookin' for a way back home, where are you?)

(Way back)
(I'm so glad to meet, just when you know who you are, are, are, are, are, are)
Lookin' for a way back home (lookin' for a way back home)
Woosh
