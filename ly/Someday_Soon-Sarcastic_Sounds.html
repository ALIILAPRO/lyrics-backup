		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey
Don't know what you got 'til it's too late
Don't know that you're dry 'til you feel the rain
Don't know that you're fine 'til you feel pain but that's okay
'Cause someday soon
Just a bit of time will heal your wounds
A little piece of mind was overdue
And it would be a crime to waste your
Youth

I've lost half my days stuck on tomorrow
Past mistakes and what path to follow
Just to have the present pass me by
I've been too obsessed with who I impress
I always compare and always have less
But I think that's part and parcel with being alive

So look around and smell the roses
Free your shoulders from the bullshi
There's no sense in tryna hold it
And there's no time to waste 'cause

Hey
Don't know what you got 'til it's too late
Don't know that you're dry 'til you feel the rain
Don't know that you're fine 'til you feel pain but that's okay
'Cause someday soon
Just a bit of time will heal your wounds
A little piece of mind was overdue
And it would be a crime to waste your
Youth

Some days I can't get off my phone
Or out my bed
Or out my feelings
Or out my head
It's like I'm never enough, the rain'll never let up again

I tell myself that my sorrow and therapy
Tomorrow ain't guaranteed
And wasting a single second is fucking embarrassing
A little cherry picking, a little more cherishing
'Cause I can't bring my problems underground when they bury me

So look around and smell the roses
Free your shoulders from the bullshit
There's no sense in tryna hold it
And there's no time to waste 'cause

Hey
Don't know what you got 'til it's too late
Don't know that you're dry 'til you feel the rain
Don't know that you're fine 'til you feel pain but that's okay
'Cause someday soon
Just a bit of time will heal your wounds
A little piece of mind was overdue
And it would be a crime to waste your
Youth
