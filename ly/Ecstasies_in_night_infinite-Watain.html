		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  On chariots of fire they approach
A violent force
That spurs the storm and spurs the lightning
Shine forth across the void
Prismatic revelations of eternal death
Vibrant in splendour
Youâ€™ll see them coming from afar
Across the heavens from the deeps of the underworld
They've come to claim what has been theirs for long
Their freedom, their ecstasy
To illuminate the outer limits
And mock the dawn
Like ecstasies in night infinite
Liberated from the fetters of fate
Instant yet constant, to become
The everglaring nuclear bliss
The architects of a new abyss
For we have come to claim what has been ours for long
Our freedom, our ecstasy
To illuminate the path within
To live and die
Like ecstasies in the night
Shine forth from worlds unborn
Blessed be those
That bask within thy radiation
Glorious victorious
Dart forth from storm rent chasm
As the future turns into hours
On chariots of fire they approach
A violent force, a sudden curse
That spurs the storm and kills the light
Through space and time now thrust
The next thousand years are but hours
Minutes and seconds then dust
