		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We got it started in the worst way
Just by the way you looked at me
Goddamn, it was a spectacle
We look fuckin' incredible now

It was a car crash
Two colors cross the intersect
Red light wasn't the problem
The stop sign drew us deeper in (yeah)

Chase me out of your bed just to tell me, "come back"
And the signals were mixed, so we crashed
Your bloodshot eyes tell me when
All the warring has ended, it was beautiful

I didn't mean It's caught in crossfire
It's fine, but then, you called me, "liar"
How could I be alright
Knowing where you are at night?
I know It don't feel right, feels right
Goodbyes just wake up by me

Chase me out of your bed just to tell me, "come back"
And the signals were mixed, so we crashed
Your bloodshot eyes tell me when
All the warring has ended, It was beautiful

Chase me out of your bed just to tell me, "come back"
And the signals were mixed, so we crashed
Your bloodshot eyes tell me when
All the warring has ended, it was beautiful (beautiful)

All the blood we spill just makes me want you bad
I can't even tell no more if what we have is good or bad
Anymore

Chase me out of your bed just to tell me, "come back"
Bloodshot eyes tell me when
All the warring has ended, It was beautiful
Chase me out of your bed just to tell me, "come back"
And the signals were mixed, so we crashed
Your bloodshot eyes tell me when
All the warring has ended, It was beautiful (beautiful)
