		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't know what a true love is
But I hope it feels like this
Maybe we're just two dumb kids on a one-way trip
Only two ways this could end

You talkin' and I can't even look into your eyes
I'm nervous, I'm stutterin', la-la-la-la-la-la
There's something that's tellin' me I gotta make you mine
I felt it, you felt it

First, it was just a rush, turned to a couple months
I lose track of time when I'm around you
I've never been in love, then it hit me like a truck

You got me like, ooh
There's a lot of things that I said I won't do
Everything changed the second I met you
I wasn't prepared for my dreams to come true
I'm stuck on you

I don't know what a true love is
But I hope it feels like this
Maybe we're just two dumb kids on a one-way trip
Only two ways this could end

Every second's a minute, a minute's quick to be finished
I'm countin' hours and hours, I know for life, I'm committed
And, baby, I don't know what a true love is
But I hope it feels, I hope it feels like this

Hope it feels like this
I hope it feels like

Coffee in the morning, you're my blanket on a rainy day
Let's just close the curtains and pretend that we on holiday
Body talkin', I love how you communicate
With you it's different, I don't feel like I could walk away

Came out of nowhere, hit me like a hurricane
Daydreaming, got me thinking 'bout you wide awake
My favorite thing to put a smile on your pretty face
There's nothin' left to say

You got me like, ooh
There's a lot of things that I said I won't do
Everything changed the second I met you
I wasn't prepared for my dreams to come true
I'm stuck on you

And, baby, I
I can't help to think that I'm out of my mind
Feelin' like a kid, it's been such a long time
You know that it's real when it comes without tryin'
I'm goin' in blind

I don't know what a true love is
But I hope it feels like this
Maybe we're just two dumb kids on a one-way trip
Only two ways this could end
