		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I thought I made it clear as crystal
It doesn't have to be this hard
But you ain't good at reading signals
When they come straight from the heart

You've been thinking, you've been thinking, overthinking, you've been thinking, babe
Just a little too much
I wish you knew what I want
I been looking, I been looking, I been looking in the mirror
Making little touch-ups

And I hope you know that I want you
I've been sitting here waiting
I've been waiting for you
I've sent out invitations
It's getting frustrating waiting for you
I think you know what I want
I think you know what I want
I think you know what I want
I think you know, I'm waiting for you

I'll take your hand and kiss your fingers
So you don't have to break the ice
No need for chill just lose your filter
I'm ready to dive in
Melt the ice and just swim

You've been thinking, you've been thinking, overthinking, you've been thinking, babe
Just a little too much
I wish you knew what I want
We been drinking, we been drinking, we been drinking, we been drinking, babe
Just a little too much

And I hope you know that I want you
I've been sitting here waiting
I've been waiting for you
I've sent out invitations
It's getting frustrating waiting for you
I think you know what I want
I think you know what I want
I think you know what I want
I think you know, I'm waiting for you
I think you know what I want
Now I think you know what I want
I think you know what I want
I think you know, I'm waiting for you

I'm waiting for you

I gotta have you
I've been sitting here waiting
I've been waiting for you
I've sent out invitations
It's getting frustrating waiting for you
I think you know what I want
Now I think you know what I want
I think you know what I want
I think you know, I'm waiting for you
I think you know what I want
Now I think you know what I want
I think you know what I want
I think you know, I'm waiting for you
