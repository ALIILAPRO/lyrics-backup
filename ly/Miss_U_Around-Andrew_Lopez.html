		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well all my friends are your friends now
There's no one there to pick me up when I'm down
Oh God I miss you around
Miss you around

Friday night I'm on my own again deciding if I should call you and tell you I need you
And if I did what would you do
I know we'll never be the same again but maybe just for the night we could talk like we used to
Then maybe you would come through

Do you ever think we could have been different or is everything according to plan?
And is it crazy for me to think that maybe I could still be your man?

Well all my friends are your friends now
There's no one there to pick me up when I'm down
Oh God I miss you around
There's only one good thing about this town
And that's the concrete of the pavement when I fall to the ground
Oh God I miss you around
Miss you around

Saturday morning I'm scrolling through the pictures of you out with my friends
I'm wondering when will this end?
I know it's all in my head
I left our group chat on read
I think I'm better off dead

But do you ever think we could have been different or is everything according to plan?
And is it crazy for me to think that maybe I could still be your man?

Well all my friends are your friends now
There's no one there to pick me up when I'm down
Oh God I miss you around
There's only one good thing about this town
And that's the concrete of the pavement when I fall to the ground
Oh God I miss you around
Miss you around

Oh God I miss you around
Miss you around
Oh God I miss you around

Well all my friends are your friends now
There's no one there to pick me up when I'm down
Oh God I miss you around
There's only one good thing about this town
And that's the concrete of the pavement when I fall to the ground
Oh God I miss you around
Miss you around
