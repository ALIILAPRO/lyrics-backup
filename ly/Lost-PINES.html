		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How did I get here
Thought we were nowhere close
To feeling alone, together

Don't want to stay here
Could we get better
I'd do whatever

Are you lost and too far to be found
I have fell and and forgot how to find you
Open your mind open your arms to me
Give me a sign that I can read
I would follow you to wherever


You know just how I want to be honored
You know I'd do whatever it takes
I would do anything
Would've give everything
But your lost
But your lost


Where do we go now
I'm a world unknown
Can't go it alone, forever

Don't want to stay here
Could we get better
I'd do whatever

Are you lost and too far to be found
I have fell and and forgot how to find you
Open your mind open your arms to me
Give me a sign that I can read
I would follow you to wherever


You know just how I want to be honored
You know I'd do whatever it takes
I would do anything
Would've give everything
But your lost
But your lost


Boy you say you're lost but I can't keep up with your running
Is that what you wanted, is that what you wanted
hmm
