		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You can be anyone you want to be
You can be free, you can be free
I believe you're the one who's meant for me
We can be free, just come with me
Fill the crown, let them know we're fed
Fill the crown, let them know we're fed
Fill, fill, fill, fill, fi-fi-fi-fill

Poison the children
No peace of mind
Poison the family
Make the children cry
Poison the fountain
Empty your mind
Follow the leader
The leader is blind

You can be anyone you want to be
You can be free, you can be free
I believe you're the one who's meant for me
We can be free, just come with me
Fill the crown, let them know we're fed
Fill the crown, let them know we're fed
Fill, fill, fill, fill, fi-fi-fi-fill

Baptize the children
Swallowed inside
Pray for the victims (pray for the victims)
Innocent lives
Poison the children
Watch from behind
Forgive your spirit
Forfeit your life

You can be anyone you want to be
You can be free, you can be free
You can live happily, just turn the key
We can be free, just come with me

Just come with me

If you're wanting somebody
Just call my name (just come with me)
I'll be there, believe me
I'll keep you safe (just come with me)
Fill the crown, let them know we're fed
Fill the crown, let them know we're fed
Fill, fill, fill, fill, fi-fi-fi-fill
