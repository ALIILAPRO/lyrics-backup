		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I love it, I hate it, I can’t get quite enough

I’ll let you take it off for me
I like it when you drop for me
Girl you so damn fine when you lookin up at me 
It feels so good when you put your trust in me 
You’re always good company

I love it, I hate it, I can’t get quite enough
You trust me I need you we can’t sleep till we touch
I want you I need you all of you like a drug
Not enough 

She put on show when she love like this
Never had a crush like this 
Damn we on a roll and shit
Never had a flow like this
God damn that body dropping low and shit
Dirty little stoner chick
And she lick like cone drip drip 
Baby want it all like this
So naughty when alone like this
Got us on the floor like this
She likes to record and shit
She given rewards like this
Ahh baby wanna show me what you know like this
Somewhere we could go like this
Somewhere all alone like this 
All alone like this

(2x)
I love it, I hate it, I can’t get quite enough
You trust me I need you we can’t sleep till we touch
I want you I need you all of you like a drug
Not enough 

(2x)
You know you like all those things we’re trying
You know you like all those things don’t hide it
