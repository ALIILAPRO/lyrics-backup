		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And I wanna believe you
When you tell me that it'll be okay
Yeah, I try to believe you
But I don't
When you say that it's gonna be
It always turns out to be a different way
I try to believe you
Not today, today, today, today, today

(I, yeah, yeah)
I don't know how I'll feel (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Tomorrow (tomorrow), tomorrow (tomorrow)
And I (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I don't know what to say (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Tomorrow (tomorrow)
Tomorrow is a different day

(Tomorrow)
It's always been up to you
It's turning around, it's up to me
I'm gonna do what I have to do
Just don't
Give me a little time
Leave me alone a little while
Maybe it's not too late
Not today, today, today, today, today, oh

(I, yeah, yeah)
I don't know how I'll feel (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Tomorrow (tomorrow), tomorrow (tomorrow)
And I (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Don't know what to say (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Tomorrow (tomorrow)
Tomorrow is a different day

Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah, yeah
And I know I'm not ready
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah, yeah
Maybe tomorrow
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm not ready
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah, yeah
Maybe tomorrow

And I wanna believe you
When you tell me that it'll be okay
Yeah, I try to believe you
Not today, today, today, today, today

Tomorrow, it may change 
Tomorrow, it may change
Tomorrow, it may change
Tomorrow, it may change
