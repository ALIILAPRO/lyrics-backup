		  (Bangerz, f***in' bangerz)
(Bangerz, f***in' bangerz)

All the way in the back, with a tree on my lap
All the boys like to ask me "what you doing with that"
Yeah yeah, you say you love me, I ain't fooling with that
They ask me how I keep a man, I keep a battery pack

One day he wants me, one day he wants me not
I don't do chances, 'cause time just ain't what I got
If he's like that, I got a world tour that they need me at
I can't be sitting 'round here waiting on a man
To tell me where the f*** my seat be at, where Mike Will at?

She be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (Bangerz)
She be struttin' that stuff, I be struttin' my stuff
She be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (Bangerz)
She be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (F***in' bangerz)
She be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (Bangerz)
She be struttin' that stuff, I be struttin' my stuff
She be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (Bangerz)
She be struttin' that stuff, I be struttin' my stuff

Flying high up on a bird like a phobiac
I slick caught her, eying down my purse where the dollars at?
I love when all the rents due on the first,
They can call a hearse 'cause if there's any violation I go off with that

Cat walk, slick talk, flirting with them big dogs
(Why I need his milli's when I got Billy on the speed dial)
(You know I'm on that meow) Quick to scratch your eyes out
Struttin' on the court, make them nervous, call a timeout

She be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (Bangerz)
She be struttin' that stuff, I be struttin' my stuff
She be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (Bangerz)
She be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (F***in' bangerz)
She be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (Bangerz)
She be struttin' that stuff, I be struttin' my stuff
She be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (Bangerz)
She be struttin' that stuff, I be struttin' my stuff

The play boss, the play, got to get that big rocks
Sit that on my hand, make that media big talk
The playin' boss, the play, sike that must be the purple
Got up in my brain, had me a little bit dismal

(Bangerz, f***in' bangerz)
(Bangerz, f***in' bangerz)
