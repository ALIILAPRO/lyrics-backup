		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Got 'em all wet
Got 'em all wet, shaking what they mama gave em

Make no mistake about it, she is dangerous
I'm ready for the punishment, she ties me up
'Cause she's got the hottest vibe and the body to ride
Workin' the floor like it's her nine to five
She's the type of girl who knows just what she wants
All the dude are trying to pick their mouths off the floor

Got 'em all wet

Let 'em sweat it all they want
Give it all they got
We got a good thing
They don't know it's a good thing
Let "em sweat it all they want
Give it all they got
Cause I can't wait to get you home
No I can't wait
To get you all alone

I'll say the things that they won't say
I'll do the things that make your legs shake
Cause she's got the hottest vibe and the body to ride
Workin' the floor like it's her nine to five
She's the type of girl who knows just what she wants
All the dude are trying to pick their mouths off the floor

Let 'em sweat it all they want
Give it all they got
We got a good thing
They don't know it's a good thing
Let 'em sweat it all they want
Give it all they got
Cause I can't wait to get you home
No I can't wait
To get you all alone

Let 'em sweat it all they want
Give it all they got
We got a good thing
They don't know it's a good thing
Let 'em sweat it all they want
Give it all they got
'Cause I can't wait to get you home
No I can't wait
To get you all alone

Got 'em all wet

To get you all alone

She's going home with me
She's going home with me
She's going home with me
They'll never believe so I'm making them see
She's going home with me
They'll never believe so I'm making them see
She's going home with me
They'll never believe so I'm making them see
