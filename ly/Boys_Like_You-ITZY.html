		  Hah!
Hmm

Why you calling me up saying sorry again?
Already told you we're done, why didn't you get?
Don't forget you're the one that tried to get with my friends
The end, the end, the end, the end

Well, you must be going crazy, thinking I'll be back, I'm sorry
'Cause you're crying like a baby, but do I look like your mommy?
Take a look into that mirror if u wonder why you lost me
Gotta sit down and shut up, you did it to yourself

Boy, you gonna diss me? Boy, I'm so pissed
Boy, you gonna miss me, boy, you are dismissed
'Cause I don't fall for boys like you (I don't fall for)
I don't fall for boys like you (I don't fall for)

Boy, you wanna date me? Boy, outta date, yeah
Boy, you wanna "What? No!", boy, outta my way
'Cause I don't fall for boys like you (I don't fall for)
I don't fall for boys like you (I don't fall for)

I see through sweet little lies and every excuse
When you start every fight, the blame is on you
One red flag and I'm gone already onto
The next, the next, the next

Well, you must be going crazy, thinking I'll be back, I'm sorry
'Cause you're crying like a baby, but do I look like your mommy?
Take a look into that mirror if u wonder why you lost me
Gotta sit down and shut up, you did it to yourself

Boy, you gonna diss me? Boy, I'm so pissed
Boy, you gonna miss me, boy, you are dismissed
'Cause I don't fall for boys like you (I don't fall for)
I don't fall for boys like you (I don't fall for)

Boy, you wanna date me? Boy, outta date, yeah
Boy, you wanna "What? No!", boy, outta my way
'Cause I don't fall for boys like you (I don't fall for)
I don't fall for boys like you (I don't fall for)

You can raise your voice, but know that you have no choice
Don't care what you do (you-hoo-hoo)
You can raise your voice, but know that you have no choice
Don't care what you do (you-hoo-hoo)

So turn around, walk away
You made your bed, so you gotta lay

Get outta my way

Boy, you gonna diss me? Boy, I'm so pissed
Boy, you gonna miss me, boy, you are dismissed
'Cause I don't fall for boys like you (I don't fall for)
I don't fall for boys like you (I don't fall for)

Boy, you wanna date me? Boy, outta date, yeah
Boy, you wanna "What? No!", boy, outta my way
'Cause I don't fall for boys like you (I don't fall for)
I don't fall for boys like you (I don't fall for)

You can raise your voice, but know that you have no choice
Don't care what you do (you-hoo-hoo)
You can raise your voice, but know that you have no choice
Don't care what you do (you-hoo-hoo)

Oh, you
