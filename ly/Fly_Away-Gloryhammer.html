		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wanna fly away on a unicorn

To a land of freedom and light

But I know that my destiny

Is to die in the ultimate fight

I wanna fly away cross the galaxy

To discover the force that's inside of me

I wanna fly away

I have discovered there's a world beyond Dundee

A vast eternal sea of stars

I've crossed the wastelands from the mountains to the sea

My quest is neverending

I wanna fly away on a unicorn

To a land of freedom and light

But I know that my destiny

Is to die in the ultimate fight

I wanna fly away cross the galaxy

To discover the force that's inside of me

I wanna fly away

The crystal citadel of Cowdenbeath is mine

This astral hammer holds the key

(FRAGMENTS OF A FALLEN STAR)

For countless centuries we've walked the cosmic line

It's time to break the prophecy

(ANSTRUTHER'S DARK PROPHECY)

By the power of this amulet I wield

I'll cross the threshold to a universe of steel

I wanna fly away on a unicorn

To a land of freedom and light

But I know that my destiny

Is to die in the ultimate fight

I wanna fly away cross the galaxy

To discover the force that's inside of me

I wanna fly away

On a quest that is calling me

To the other side of the galaxy

I know I'll find my destiny

In outer space in 1993

Yeah!

I wanna fly away on a unicorn

To a land of freedom and light

But I know that my destiny

Is the...Kingdom of Fife

I wanna fly away cross the galaxy

To discover the force that's inside of me

I wanna fly away

I wanna fly away

I wanna fly away

I wanna fly away
