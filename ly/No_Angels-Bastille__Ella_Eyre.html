		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A scrub is a guy who thinks he's fly
And he's also known as a buster
Always talkin' about what he wants
And just sits on his broke ass, so

No, I don't want your number
No, I don't wanna give you mine and
No, I don't wanna meet you nowhere
No, don't want none of your time

I don't want no scrubs
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side
Of his best friend's ride
Try to holla at me
I don't want no scrubs
Scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side
Of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me
Try to holla at me, at me

But a scrub's checkin' me and his game is kinda weak
And I know that he cannot approach me
'Cause I'm lookin like class and he's looking like trash
Can't get with no deadbeat ass, so

No, I don't want your number
No, I don't wanna give you mine, and
No, I don't wanna meet you nowhere
No, don't want none of your time

No, I don't want no scrubs
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side
Of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me
I don't want no scrubs
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side
Of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me, holla at me
Holla at me, holla at me

If you don't have a car and you're walkin'
Oh yes son, I'm talking to you
If you live at home with your momma
If you have a shorty but you don't show love
Wanna get me with no money
Oh no, I don't want no

No scrubs, no scrubs
No scrubs, no scrubs

No, I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side
Of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me
I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side
Of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me, try to holla at me
Holla at me, trying to holla at me

(Being as in love with you as I am)
