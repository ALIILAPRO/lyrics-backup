		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  From the reign I've built
Of shame and guilt
I go back and take a look,
At myself and what
I have done so far
At the bridge he's lying waiting till light

No choice to go
Backward, Inward
Okay generous
You're to cross the chamber

Going down I walk my way 'till now
Deep to the obscurity
Obliterating you in every way
With my life's insanity

Battered up again
I'm going right inside
Curled up on the floor
Wonder ways to kill the pain and
What doesn't kill you will only make you pissed off

Sweep back to kill
You can't make it go away
So let's, take a shot at me
Just when you punch me, I bleed

Going down I walk my way 'till now
Deep to the obscurity
Obliterating you in every way
With my life's insanity

No choice to go
Backward, Inwards
Okay generous
You're to cross the chamber

Going down I walk my way 'till now
Deep to the obscurity
Obliterating you in every way
With my life's insanity
