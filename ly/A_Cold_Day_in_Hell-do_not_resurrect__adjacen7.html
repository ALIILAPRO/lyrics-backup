		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Cryogenic all my pieces
Hollows popping through the chrome
Lava leaking from my body
Probly rotten to the bone
Nah I'm not fuckin with you leeches
Probly caught him at the store
That chopper spit bout 30 rounds
Now watch his body leave his soul
My flow enhancing
That boy just rancid
I told my mans
That my plans is to blow finances
And hella bandses
My tan Sig get so romantic
She got to chanting
And BLAM! bitch
It's underhanded
He lost a damn limb
I'm god again
Paint that wall again
Crank that bat and break his jaw again
So now that motherfucker cannot yawn again
I'm Spartacus
Sending DOOT! DOOT! DOOT! DOOT! through your cardigan
If I don't get what's mine then I might let these hollows off again, and...
Put a cap in his ass
Feel the wrath
I'ma drag to the back of house
Put a stack on X'ing him out
If a man wanna fuck with mine
Laugh at him now
Hit a nigga, put a rag in his mouth
I don't really think of asking twice
Blast and I'm out, what a god damn ass of a clown
Cut a fucker then I dug a ditch
Cuz I never knew another motherfucker
Wanna gut a motherfucker much as Rezzy
I'm in love with this
Cryogenic all my pieces
Hollows popping through the chrome
Lava leaking from my body
Probly rotten to the bone
Nah I'm not fuckin with you leeches
Probly caught him at the store
That chopper spit bout 30 rounds
Now watch his body leave his soul
My flow enhancing
That boy just rancid
I told my mans
That my plans is to blow finances
And hella bandses
My tan Sig get so romantic
She got to chanting
And BLAM! bitch
It's underhanded
He lost a damn limb
I'm god again
Paint that wall again
Crank that bat and break his jaw again
So now that motherfucker cannot yawn again
I'm Spartacus
Sending DOOT! DOOT! DOOT! DOOT! through your cardigan
If I don't get what's mine then I might let these hollows off again, and...
