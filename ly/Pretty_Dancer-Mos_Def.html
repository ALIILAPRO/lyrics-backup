		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Absolutely, Flaco!

Fresh and I'm fresh and my fresh just get fresher
Diamonds in production glow greater than the pressure
The none turn to some and the some turn to moire
The more turn to many and the many turn to all
Shoutin' on my nothing like it's nothing at all
To not knowin' what ya got 'til it got gone
Same song, new time signature
New brand hustle with the long time arithmetic
Bey, from the preacher man, number man, understand
Curves and sliders, overs and under-hands
Black Batman, knock 'em out the park
Pitch, quiet fire sniper not the one you tryna box with
Block work when the block turn jobless
And triple beams ain't the best means to weigh your options
Smarts! Get smart with your smartness
Too busy surviving to argue 'bout Darwin, Darling!

See me, huh, a pretty dancer
Need sugar, win Ali? pretty dance
See me do it
Ready, steady, step it out

Big swing swing with bangers and thing thingers
Soul glow zinging all over the ring finger
Yo yo! Don't play me so close
Make me tell you something that you ain't really ready to know
Fight camp you was in top form
Fight night, damn you ain't breakin' popcorn
Aw man word bond?
Word is bond! Ultimatum
Lights off, smelling salts, resuscitate 'em
I don't underrate 'em son, I don't nothing-reate 'em
All I do is pop pop, frustrate 'em
Exacerbate 'em, sharp shoot, lacerate 'em
Steady hustle, shuffle shuffle, fascinate 'em

Ecstatic nature black imagination activated
True and living elevated, you are rockin' with the greatest
Ecstatic nature black imagination activated
True and living elevated, you are rockin' with the greatest
It's like a dove from up above

See me, huh, a pretty dancer
Need sugar, win Ali? Pretty dancer
See me do it
Ready, steady, step it out
(Fly like a dove from up above)
See me, huh, a pretty dancer
Need sugar, win Ali? Pretty dancer
See me do it
Ready, steady, step it out

Fly like a dove from up above
Move (Fly like a dove from up above
Fly like a dove from up above)

Fly like a dove from up above (the greatest)
Fly like a dove from up above
Fly like a dove from up above
