		  Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah

There's been a lot of toasting a lot of guys have been up to her
But she told them she was waiting
For the one that God had sent to fulfil her kind of craving
A special kind of loving hmm one with love and understanding
Come raining come shining hmm people started to say that she wanted more than mr right
All that she wanted was the man that sees the light
They say she's a fool for being up too tight
When all that she wanted was good love no be fight
That special kind of girl hard to come by
This kind of girl na im I want to make wife
You're the one I say no more
Don't bother about what the people say cos I say

Every time that I look into your eyes I see fire in there fire
And if you look into my eyes you see desire in there desire
Girl if love is a crime then I'm willing to be wanted
If love is a crime I'm willing to be haunted
I've gotta lot of respect for you cos your kind is so rare so rare
It's kind of hard to imagine but I know you're out there you're out there
Girl if love is a crime then I'm willing to be wanted
If love is a crime I'm willing to be haunted

She said to me do you wanna be the last man standing
She said to me do you wanna be the one that 'll be complimenting me
Ooooh yeah girI wanna be your beginning and your ending
Oh I wanna be the only one that you'll be sending
I can't believe she's still a virgin a lot of guys have been up to her
But there's was no compromising she'd be strong
she'd keeping herself until the day of her wedding
Under the right ceiling with the right person
A person deserving all that special kind of loving

Every time that I look into your eyes I see fire in there fire
And if you look into my eyes you see desire in there desire
Girl If love is a crime then I'm willing to be wanted
Girl If love is a crime I'm willing to be haunted
I've gotta lot of respect for you cos your kind is so rare so rare
It's kind of hard to imagine but I know you're out there you're out there
Girl if love is a crime then I'm willing to be wanted
If love is a crime I'm willing to be haunted

So keep the fire burning
Keep the fire burning burning burning
Fire burning
Keep the fire burning keep it burning
Fire burning
Keep the fire burning burning burning
Fire burning e
Keep It burning keep It burning

If love is a crime then I like to dey go jail
I said If love is a crime I prefer to dey stay jail
E fire burning
Keep the fire burning keep it burning
Fire burning oh burning burning
See every time that I look into your eyes I see fire in there keep the fire burning
And if you look into my eyes you see desire in there keep the fire burning
Girl if love is a crime If love is a crime keep the fire burning
Girl If love is a crime If love is a crime keep the fire burning burning burning
