		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  He drowned in all our sins
He drowned in our mistakes
Fueled by the flood, we pay in blood
The curse of Crystal Lake

Ki-Ki-Ki, Ma-Ma-Ma
Ki-Ki-Ki, Ma-Ma-Ma
Ki-Ki-Ki, Ma-Ma-Ma

We've all been laid to rest
Our epitaph reads "Mommy knows best"
A word of warning from beyond the grave
That must be understood
Throats get slit in this neck of the woods

She raised him right and he'll come out to play
When mother whispers, "Thank God it's Friday"

He drowned in all our sins
He drowned in our mistakes
Fueled by the flood, we pay in blood
The curse of Crystal Lake
He's down there deep within
We've found there's no escape
You just scratched the surface of the curse of Crystal Lake

Caught undressed we were laid to rest
A drunken, sex-crazed teenage mess
Killed in the climax of debauchery, we learned the hard way
When he came for our lives on the thirteenth day

Did you know my son drowned in this lake
He should've been supervised
But the counselors were off having filthy sex
His name was Jason
And today is his birthday

She raised him right and he'll come out to play
When mother whispers, "Thank God it's Friday"

He drowned in all our sins
He drowned in our mistakes
Fueled by the flood, we pay in blood
The curse of Crystal Lake
He's down there deep within
We've found there's no escape
You just scratched the surface of the curse of Crystal Lake

Don't you know he'll never be gone for good?
So we'll never get out of the woods
A machete in one hand and an axe in the other
Steadfast in his mask in the shadow of mother
Ready to resume
You're all doomed

"Thank God It's Friday!
Kill for Mommy
Thank God It's Friday!"
He'll stop at nothing
Forever hunting
Jason's coming

He drowned in all our sins
He drowned in our mistakes
Fueled by the flood, we pay in blood
The curse of Crystal Lake
He's down there deep within
We've found there's no escape
You just scratched the surface of the curse of Crystal Lake

Ki-Ki-Ki, Ma-Ma-Ma

Ki-Ki-Ki, Ma-Ma-Ma
Ki-Ki-Ki, Ma-Ma-Ma
Ki-Ki-Ki, Ma-Ma-Ma
Ki-Ki-Ki, Ma-Ma-Ma
