		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm hanging with my friends
But I feel lonely
Tell me I should smile
But it's phony.
"Ladies let's go out!
Oh let's go out!
It's been a while" they said
"So let's paint the city red!"
The DJ's gonna drop the beat
No time for gazing at my feet
Call me back
I'm here
It is the time to make your move
Ya gave me one little kiss
But it ain't enough for you
Your dancing all night
Without a care
The only heart
I have to share
We said our goodbyes
With heavy air
So tap my number yeah
Call me back
I'm here
It is the time to make your move
Ya gave me one little kiss
But it ain't enough for you
Your dancing all night
Without a care
The only heart
I have to share
We said our goodbyes
With heavy air
So tap my number yeah
We drive under the stars
The town is pumping
Ladies search for that
special something
Hey let's check it out!
We check it out!
It's not our usual scene
Then I step into a dream
The DJ's gonna drop the beat
No time for gazing at my feet
Call me back
I'm here
It is the time to make your move
Ya gave me one little kiss
But it ain't enough for you
Your dancing all night
Without a care
The only heart
I have to share
We said our goodbyes
With heavy air
So tap my number yeah
Call me back
I'm here
It is the time to make your move
Ya gave me one little kiss
But it ain't enough for you
Your dancing all night
Without a care
The only heart
I have to share
We said our goodbyes
With heavy air
So tap my number yeah

Call me back
I'm here
It is the time to make your move
Ya gave me one little kiss
But it ain't enough for you
Your dancing all night
Without a care
The only heart
I have to share
We said our goodbyes
With heavy air
So tap my number yeah
Call me back
I'm here
It is the time to make your move
Ya gave me one little kiss
But it ain't enough for you
Your dancing all night
Without a care
The only heart
I have to share
We said our goodbyes
With heavy air
So tap my number yeah
