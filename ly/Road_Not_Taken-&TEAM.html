		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, we're going down, down
Are we lost or found (found)? (yeah)
Yeah, we're going down, down
それでも don't stop (ha-ha-ha)

Yeah, we're going round, round
Are we lost or found?
Yeah, we're going だんだん 近づいていた

Yeah, we're going round, round
Are we lost or found?

今走り出せ (won't give up)
No time to be afraid (keep it up)
運命変えるため 二つに一つ 僕は選ぶ
Road not taken

Yeah (goin' on) 探し求めて (runnin' on)
We're crossing, on our way
誰も行かない道を行け
Road not taken

惹かれてる 君の匂い
探す深い 森の中で
Dive in deeper まだ見えない
霧は深い stuck in the dark night

抗えない destiny 君に繋がる道なら
Going on and on and on and so on
Yeah, find you in the dark
Find you in the darkness

Knock, knock, knock, knock
Knocking on, let me go
傷重ねるたび前へ
So I'm rock, rock, rock, rock, rock with the way I flow 
今は孤独でも 耐えて進める my pace

Yeah, we're going down, down
Are we lost or found?
Yeah, we're going だんだん 近づいていた
Yeah, we're going round, round
Are we lost or found?

今走り出せ (won't give up)
No time to be afraid (keep it up)
運命変えるため 二つに一つ 僕は選ぶ
Road not taken

Change (goin' on)
This road is ours to make (runnin' on)
Yes, do you feel the same?
君の声がこの先に
Road not taken

近づく度 高まる heartbeat
すぐ会いたい 呼応する my skin
Ey 君の手 繋いで going our way
今ためらってる暇は無いね

Yeah, no matter what it takes, my fate
君に共鳴するまで
Shout it out, shout it out, shoutin'

Yeah, hear you in the dark
Hear you in the darkness
Non, non, non, non, non-stop and movin' on
導かれる my howling
So I'm lock, lock, lock, lock, locking on to the road
すり減る heartでも run straight to the day

Yeah, we're going down, down
Are we lost or found?
Yeah, we're going だんだん
近づいていた
Yeah, we're going round, round
Are we lost or found? (Yeah)

Yeah, we're going down, down
Are we lost or found?
Yeah, we keeping on now 'til the freedom's come
Yeah, we're going round, round
Are we lost or found?

今走り出せ (won't give up)
No time to be afraid (keep it up)
運命変えるため 二つに一つ 僕は選ぶ
Road not taken (oh)

Yeah (goin' on)
探し求めて (runnin' on)
We're crossing, on our way
君の声がこの先に
Road not taken
