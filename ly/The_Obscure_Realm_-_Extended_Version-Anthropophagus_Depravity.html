		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Crippled Immortality...

Rotten view of the darkside world
Disgusting and full of lust
Where abomination always reigns
Hunting human soul

Fall and suffer by worldly rot
Obliterating what they called beliefs

Destroyed and disappeared
Their burning corpses
cnd there is nothing left...


Torment is their punishment
Which one to dissolve the sin
Only scream you can only hear
For implore their salvation

Your kingdom created above the infamy


Have you ever thought of your suffering
This is the cause of your obedience

They ask for forgiveness and humiliate themselves
Killed and revived in this unholy realm
The vision of rotting torment is now revealed
Without mercy continue to be tortured

Exemption for desecration
Redemption through Lunacy
Through this realm of infinite darkness
The servants lying in suffering

You worship a flawed god
You worship a weak god


To those who are cursed,welcome to the obscure realm
