		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I keep playing it inside my head
All that you said to me
I lie awake just to convince myself
This wasn't just a dream

'Cause you were right here
And I should've taken the chance
But I got so scared
And I lost the moment again
It's all that I can think about
Oh, you're all that I can think about

Is your heart taken?
Is there somebody else on your mind?
I'm so sorry, I'm so confused
Just tell me, am I out of time?
Is your heart breaking?
How do you feel about me now?
I can't believe I let you walk away when
When I should have kissed you

I should've, I should've, oh, I should have kissed you
I should've, I should've, oh, I should have kissed you
I should've, I should've, oh, I should have kissed you
I should've, I should've, oh, I should have kissed you

Every morning when I leave my house
I always look for you, yeah 
I see you every time I close my eyes
What am I gonna go?

And all my friends say that I'm punching over my weight
But in my eyes I saw how you're looking at me
It's all that I can think about
Oh, you're all that I can think about

Is your heart taken?
Is there somebody else on your mind?
I'm so sorry, I'm so confused
Just tell me, am I out of time?
Is your heart breaking?
How do you feel about me now?
I can't believe I let you walk away when
When I should have kissed you

I should've, I should've, oh, I should have kissed you
I should've, I should've, oh, I should have kissed you
I should've, I should've, oh, I should have kissed you
I should've, I should've, oh, I should have kissed you

When you stood there, just a heartbeat away
When we were dancing, and you looked up at me
If I had known then that I'd be feeling this way
If I could replay I would never have let you go
No, oh, never have let you go
Am I out of time?

Is your heart taken?
Is there somebody else on your mind?
I'm so sorry, I'm so confused
Just tell me, am I out of time?
Is your heart breaking?
How do you feel about me now?
I can't believe I let you walk away when
When I should have kissed you

I should've, I should've, oh, I should have kissed you
I should've, I should've, oh, I should have kissed you
I should've, I should've, oh, I should have kissed you
I should've, I should've, oh, I should have kissed you
I should have kissed you
