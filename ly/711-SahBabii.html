I caught a rise, niggas was 'round, so I mossed him (mossed him)
Like a mosquito, you know that I offed him (he ain't 'bout the league)
Yeah, he's a Harlem Globetrotter (yeah)

Ayy, these niggas ain't built, why the fuck should I bother? (Why should I bother?)
Put cheese on a bitch if she come to me with that baby father (baby father)
It's crazy, but these hoes be lyin' (yeah)
You been runnin' your mouth, how the fuck you not tired?
I just smoked a opp, how the fuck I'm not high yet? (how the fuck I'm not high yet?)
She's in a new position sayin', "We should try it" (we should try it)
