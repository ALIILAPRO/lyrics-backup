		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Care for the open road 
Where dreamers before have gone
Eyes of aquamarine 
I don't trust myself with him
Can you get me some dopamine?
From a roadside vending machine
Standing on the edge of a dream 
I'm drowning in your smoke screen

Kissing in your limousine 
Under the cherry tree
Blossom falls around our feet 
Won't you remember me?
In every shade of pink 
Do you think of me?
Do you think of me, young wild and free?

He's no good for my self esteem 
How it died in a killing spree
All tangled in time machines 
And I'm always thinking of him
Said in love there's no guarantee
Broken by a famous scene
My dress is all elastin
And I'm gonna catch up with him

Kissing in your limousine 
Under the cherry tree
Blossom falls around our feet 
Won't you remember me
In every shade of pink 
Do you think of me?
Do you think of me, young wild and free?

Pale pink vintage flowers fall like kisses 
Snowstorm of a million wishes 
Is he thinking of me?
Tears on the dashboard 
Up on his high horse
Petals falling like confetti 
Icing on my cake is melting 
I have cracked the sugar coating 
Fallen to pieces, fallen to pieces

Kissing in your limousine 
Under the cherry tree
Blossom falls around our feet
Won't you remember me?
In every shade of pink 
Do you think of me?
Do you think of me, 
Young wild and free?
Do you think of me, 
Young wild and free?
Do you think of me, 
Young wild and free?
