		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I need you bad, I need you bad
I need you, I need you, I need you bad
I need you bad, I need you bad
I need you, I need you, I need you bad (shoulda been you)

I needed a little space
Honest, thought that you'd stay waiting
I made my last mistake, hmm-mmm
You're happy and I hate it

And now I know that I spoke too soon
Seeing how fast you made moves
I want you so bad (now I know)
I want you back, but you're gone

All on my own, I miss you
I know it's too late, can't handle that truth
I want you so bad (now I know)
I need you back, but you're gone

It should've been me all along (shoulda been you)
It should've been me every time I closed my eyes
Yeah, I can see, those times where I used to be
Well, oh God, it should've been me all along (shoulda been you)

Well, this was that, it seems
'Cause you don't think of me that often
How could I let you leave me, yeah?
Well, it's too late to stop ya

And now I know that I spoke too soon
Seeing how fast you made moves
I want you so bad (now I know)
I want you back, but you're gone

All on my own, I miss you
I know it's too late, can't handle that truth
I want you so bad (now I know)
I need you back, but you're gone

It should've been me all along (should a been you)
It should've been me every time I closed my eyes
Yeah, I can see, those times where I used to be
Well, oh God, it should've been me all along

It should've been, should've been me
It should've been me, should've been me all along
It should've been me all along

Hey, it should've been, should've been me
It should've been me, should've been me all along
It should've been me all along

Hey!
It should've been you
Work hard and gi' you everything, boo
Me tek you to me first Sting too
Tek you, tek your virginity like Indu
(It should've been you) me guess a so the thing go
A want brand new girl me a sing too
Different man you go swing to
Him go buy a fake ring too
Oh, should a never take me for granted
'Cause it should've been you all along
Now me know you feel like you haunted
Me a drive you crazy like a Vitara van
Gyal, you know you shouldn't leave all along
Pretend like you're happy, you'll a grieve all along (supposed to get married)
Cho, you mash up the plan
A next gyal a watch out your man (shoulda been you)

It should've been me all along
It should've been me every time I closed my eyes
Yeah, I can see, those times where I used to be
Well, oh God, it should've been me all along

It should've been, should've been me
It should've been me, should've been me all along (yeah)
It should've been me all along, ooh yeah

It should've been, should've been me
It should've been me, should've been me all along
It should've been me all along (woi-oy)
