		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's a hundred and three in the Valley
Blacktop is meltin' on our shoes
And I don't mean to make it all about me
But I used to believe no one could love you like I do
And I'm startin' to think that it might be impossible not to

There are days spent tangled up together
And sometimes you let me read your mind
Then there are nights you say you don't remember
When you stepped on the gas and you asked if I'm ready to die
You thought I'd never leave and I let you believe you were right

Walking alone in the city
Makes me feel like a man on the moon
Every small step I took was so easy
But I never imagined a dot quite as pale or as blue
You took it from me but I would've given it to you
