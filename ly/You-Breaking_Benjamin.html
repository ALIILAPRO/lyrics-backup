		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My hands are broken 
And time is going on and on it goes 
Forever 
(How long?) 
So I got high and 
Lived all that life had I have taken all 
For granted 

Promise me you'll try 
To leave it all behind 
'Cause I've elected hell 
Lying to myself 
Why have I gone blind? 
Live another life 

You
You 

The only way out 
Is letting your guard down and never die 
Forgotten 
(I know) 
Forgive me, my love 
I stand here all alone and I can see 
The bottom 

Promise me you'll try 
To leave it all behind 
'Cause I've elected hell 
Lying to myself 
Why have I gone blind? 
Live another life 

You
You
You
You
You
You
