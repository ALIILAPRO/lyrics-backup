		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Am I just cursed or gone insane?
The shadows whispering his name
It's no wonder he's the first
He will make your life worse
He loves your pain
He goes dashing for the wall
Never let go of the ball
This is your fate
Cause we risk it all just to win this fight
But victory lies in the hands
Of the creature of the night
From the depths, he came
Life won't ever be the same
You'll hear his name
And you'll know it's Mortis Game
He'll destroy your fame
He's the first to call you lame
You'll hear his name
And you'll know it's Mortis Game
He hides in a bush
Got it all figured out
His plan is to die
Trying to take down Sprout
He's the one who starts the scheme
He's forever on your team
Feeds on your hate
Once you think you're on a roll
Mortis summons all the trolls
This is your fate
Cause we risk it all just to win this fight
But victory lies in the hands
Of the creature of the night
From the depths, he came
Life won't ever be the same
You'll hear his name
And you'll know it's Mortis Game
So profane...
And there's no stopping this train
When you hear his name
Then you'll know it's Mortis Game
Cause we risk it all just to win this fight
But he'll keep pushing your team behind
Yeah you see your life slip away like sand
Cause victory lies in his hands
From the depths, he came
Life won't ever be the same
You'll hear his name
And you'll know it's Mortis Game
Cause he'll die in vain
Can't break free from all these chains
You'll hear his name
Then you'll know it's Mortis Game
You're stuck in the Mortis Game...
You're stuck in the Mortis Game...
