		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  ************** VERSE ****************

Knew that I would never stay a “bro”
And I tried to hold me back
When you call me tonight
I’ll try to remind
It’s only meant to be a night

************* PRE-VERSE ****************

And all the boys shouted
it’d be trouble yeah
`Dancing with a girl
That keeps one for the day
Loads of pretty babes
But I chose to play

************** CHORUS ****************

But baby
Just don’t make it right
Better live a thousand times
Than keeping one that sleeps at night
I know that you dreamt of it so hard
But is it criminal
criminal ?
Dancing with another boy
is criminal
But is it criminal ?
Criminal

************** VERSE 2 ****************

(She) Called me again for a second time
Or maybe it was the thirst
Didn’t pick up my phone
I did not wanna talk
I like your voice but not tonight

************** PRE-VERSE 2 ****************
Didn’t I tell you about your dangerous lies
Doing all you little business on the side

You’re a pretty girl
But I never said you’re mine

************** CHORUS ****************

But baby
Just don’t make it right
Better live a thousand times
Than keeping one that sleeps at night
I know that you dreamt of it so hard

But baby
Just don’t make it right
Better live a thousand times
Than keeping one that sleeps at night
I know that you dreamt of it so hard

But you’re a criminal
criminal
Dancing with another boy
is criminal
But you’re a criminal
Criminal
