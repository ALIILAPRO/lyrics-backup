		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's my calling
To deliver you some warm love

Five to nine
Yo

One simple phone call

It is made of dough, cheese and whatever you like
I don't care if you're on the east or the west side

Get away
Get away
Oh get away

Full speed ahead there is no foreplay

Stay at home
Stay at home
Stay at fucking home

Knock knock open up or I will pick your lock

Why
Oh please tell me why
I am gonna die
If I only try
Pineapples make me cry
Oh please tell me why
I am gonna die
Pizza homicide
By pizza homicide

Fuck fruits on my pizza
No pineapples on my pizza

Grease and meat is all I need
All I need

I can't take no more of your blasphemy

No apologies
Brutal brutality
Chop chop chop chop chop
Pizza homicide

They will find your body parts on the east and west side

Get away
Get away
Oh get away

Full speed ahead there is no foreplay

Stay at home
Stay at home
Stay at fucking home

Knock knock open up or I will pick your lock

Why
Oh please tell me why
I am gonna die
If I only try
Pineapples make me cry
Oh please tell me why
I am gonna die
Pizza homicide
By pizza homicide

Fuck fruits on my pizza
No pineapples on my pizza
Grease and meat is all I need
All I need

Why
Oh please tell me why
I am gonna die
If I only try
Pineapples make me cry
Oh please tell me why
I am gonna die
Pizza homicide
By pizza homicide
