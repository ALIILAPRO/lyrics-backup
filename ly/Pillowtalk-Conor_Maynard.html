		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Climb on board
We'll go slow in high tempo
Light and dark
Hold me hard and mellow

I'm seeing the pain, seeing the pleasure
Nobody but you, 'body but me, 'body but us
Bodies together
I love to hold you close, tonight and always
I love to wake up next to you
I love to hold you close, tonight and always
I love to wake up next to you

So we'll piss off the neighbors
In the place that feels the tears
The place you lose your fears now, reckless behavior
A place that is so pure, so dirty and so raw
In the bed all day, bed all day, bed all day
Fucking in, fighting on
It's our paradise and it's our war zone
It's our paradise and it's our war zone

So we'll piss off the neighbors baby
In the place that feels the tears the place you lose your fears now
Reckless behavior
A place that is so pure, so dirty and so raw
In the bed all day, bed all day, bed all day
Fucking in, fighting on
It's our paradise and it's our war zone
It's our paradise and it's our war zone
