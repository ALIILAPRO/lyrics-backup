		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Slow it down some 
No split clown bum 
Your old hit sound dumb 
Hold it now, crown 'I'm 
Where you found them at 

Got 'em 'round town 
Coulda drowned in it 
Woulda floated bloated 

Voted sugar coated 
Loaded hip shooter 
Draw for the poor 
Free coffee at the banks 
Hit through the straw 
None more for me, thanks 

That blanks the raw 
That dang sure stank lit 
Sank passed the pit for more hardcore prank spit 

Crank it on blast 
Roll past front street 
Blew the whole spot 
Like some old ass with skunk meat 

These kids is too fast 
Juiced off a junk treat 
Who could get looser off a crunk or a funk beat? 

Something is starting today 
Where did he go why you want it to be? 
Well you know November has come 
When it's gone away

Something is starting today 
Where did he go why you want it to be? 
Well you know, November has come 
When it's gone away

Baha
Can you dig it like a spigot 
My guess is yes you can 
Like, can I kick it?
Wicked 
Liquor shot 
If you happy and you know it 
As you clap your hands to the thick snot 
Of a poet flowin' 
Broke a pen and I'm in cope hymen 
Dope or rhymin all worth it then 
The Hope Diamond 
Required off the blackmarket 
Or wire tappin' 
Couldn't target a jar of spit 
The rapid fire spark lit 
Zzzz! 
A rapper bug zapper 
And it don't matter after if they's a thug or a dapper 
Plug yer trap or it's maximum exposure 
The beast got family in numbers asking 'em for closure 
Aw, send 'em a gun and tell 'em clean it 
Then go get the nun who said her son didn't mean it 
She wore a filled-in thong 
A billabong 
And said, nah, fo'realla 
The Villain on a Gorilla jawn? 

Something is starting today 
Where did he go why you want it to be? 
Well you know November has come 
When it's gone away

Something is starting today 
Where did he go why you want it to be? 
Well you know, November has come 
When it's gone away
When it's
When it's gone away
