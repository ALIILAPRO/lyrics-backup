		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's all that I have got
You pressed it in my side
As I begin to rot
You came on by
The words, they feel so stale
Our past lives
Return onto a way
To hold on time
Don't you ever feel
How could this be real?
And why should I reveal?
Waiting for the time

All of my lifetime
All of my lifetime

It's all that I am not
Forget the words you tried
As I begin to talk
You make your mind
So tired of turning pale
Our past lives
Return to how it stays
To hold on mine
Don't you ever feel
How could this be real?
And why should I reveal?
Don't you ever feel
How could this be real?
And why should I reveal?
Waiting for the time

All of my lifetime
All of my lifetime
All of my lifetime
