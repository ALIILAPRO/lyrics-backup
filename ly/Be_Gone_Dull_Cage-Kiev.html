		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The sun has finally come, and the time to toss in flowers, the patient say
A key lime pie, pulled apart for five to wash the last surprise
But this ain't rational, the dawn will burst, the room will flood with light
You were born a little low

And never mind the other 
You never mind the other
Let's go some more

Going further from the place we come and love, but fear the most
And change your mind, and now we'll nurse the way we feed like babies, on plastic bags
And tryin' to chase the light, the time arrives, the time that leads back home
It's not hard to let go

And never mind the other
You never mind the other 
Never mind the other
You never mind the other 

Never mind the other
You never mind the other
(Never mind the other)
