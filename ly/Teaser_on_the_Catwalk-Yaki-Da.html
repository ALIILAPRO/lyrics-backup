		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Didn't she let you down
She's a teaser on the catwalk

She's a teaser on the catwalk
Don't you believe in her
She's attractive and she knows it
Watch your step

You will ask me for a good time
But I might turn you down
I'm a woman of desire
You'll be one in the line
Can you understand if I say to you
You'll burn your fingers here
I'm an average fallen angel
But I'm here to stay

She's a teaser on the catwalk
Don't you believe in her
She's attractive and she knows it
Watch your step (repeat)

I will ask you for a favour
And you won't let me down
I'll be coming as a neightbour
And you're stuck in the jam
I'm a mastermind and a maneater
I'll catch you in my web
But when you have learned to love me
I'll be on my way

She's a teaser on the catwalk
Don't you believe in her
She's attractive and she knows it
Watch your step (repeat)

But you're flying round like a bumblebee
You're searching for a flower to pollinate
Irresistible, a forbidden fruit
Belonging to another, so innocent (repeat)

Ever since eternity man has had a hunger for passion
So taste it, feel it
Don't be afraid
You know the biggest fools are them
Who never even dare to try
Why don't you let your emotions get to you
Time to lose control

She's a teaser on the catwalk
Don't you believe in her
She's attractive and she knows it
Watch your step
