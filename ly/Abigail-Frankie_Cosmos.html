		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm just trying to know
What I wanna die surrounded by
Of all the books I'm halfway through
I could build a staircase up to you

Half a memory
Is tugging at me
Abigail, I want you to be
Alive with me

Can't believe who I used to be
What did I see in you?
Or you in me
Lets get some times to cut her slack
That version of myself I don't want back

If I die right now
I need you to see
Abigail, I want you to be
In love with me
Abigail, I want you to be
In love with me
