		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Right back at the start again
It's so hard to progress when your poison is your medicine
I keep fighting a battle I cannot win
'Cause every time I see your face
I'm pulled right back to you with no way to escape
A prisoner inside my mind
I'm trapped inside the walls of this flawed design
Nothing changes yeah we stay the same
As we've always been, like we'll always be
And every time we leave the sun for the rain
I'm reminded of what I've always seen
We keep repeating our mistakes like we love how it breaks
Will we ever collide for the last time
All we have to do is listen
We're caught up in a masquerade
But there's nowhere to hide from these acts and pointless games we play
We keep telling ourselves that it's all okay
But face it now it's all pretend
We can't go on like this no more it's all gotta end
We're prisoners that can't align
We're trapped together inside this flawed design
'Cause nothing changes yeah we stay the same
As we've always been, like we'll always be
And every time we leave the sun for the rain
I'm reminded of what I've always seen
We keep repeating our mistakes like we love how it breaks
Will we ever collide for the last time
All we have to do is listen
I'm gonna lose my sanity
'Cause once again we'll walk away
I'm losing my
I'm losing my sanity
I know we will
I know we will walk away
'Cause nothing changes yeah we stay the same
As we've always been, like we'll always be
And every time we leave the sun for the rain
I'm reminded of what I've always seen
We keep repeating our mistakes like we love how it breaks
Will we ever collide for the last time
All we have to do is listen
