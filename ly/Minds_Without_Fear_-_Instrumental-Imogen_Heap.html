		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Nearly every inch of us on the line
Plucking on the string of everything
That could have been
Such unrescued treasure fractals of her lives
Tham ja murh ja naseeba

Kahaan le aaye naseeba

If you move like lightning
Charging through the angry skies
And intercept on the arrow of time

Kahaan le aaye naseeba

But we just might make this up
With our heads held high
So this story continues with
Minds without fear

Baadal lehraaye maat ka jo

Ban jaa bijli baadal ko cheer tu

Rooh ko kar de yun roshan
Bas mushqil hai naamumkin toh nahi

Ban jaa bijli naseeba

Kahaan le aaye Naseeba

If you move like lightning
Charging through the angry skies
And intercept on the arrow of time

Kahaan le aaye naseeba

But we just might make this up
With our heads held high
And this story continues with
Minds without fear

Jhi jhi re jhi jhi re jhi jhi re jhi jhi re
Jhi jhi re jhi jhi re jhi jhi re jhi jhi re
Jhi jhi re jhi jhi re jhi jhi re jhi jhi re
Jhi jhi re jhi jhi re jhi jhi re jhi jhi re

Kahaan le aaye Naseeba

If you move like lightning
Charging through the angry skies
And intercept on the arrow of time

Kahaan le aaye naseeba

But we just might make this up
With our heads held high
So this story continues with
Minds without fear
