		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I see you when I close my eyes
I see you like I did that night
Now underneath the hi-lo lights
I see you there
I see you there

And I say
When I'm with you, well, it's just like it's the first time
Never thought that you would turn into my best life

Before the blur
Well there you were
Under the lights

And I said
When I'm with you, well, it's just like it's the first time

I see you when I close my eyes
I see you like I did that night
Now underneath the hi-lo lights
I see you there
I see you there

I see you when I close my eyes
I see you like I did that night
Now underneath the hi-lo lights
I see you there
I see you there

And I said
When I'm with you, well, it's just like it's the first time

April 7th never meant as much as that night
Before the blur
Well there you were
Under the lights

I see you when I close my eyes
I see you like I did that night
Now underneath the hi-lo lights
I see you there
I see you there

I see you when I close my eyes
I see you like I did that night
Now underneath the hi-lo lights
I see you there
I see you there

'Cause even when my heart stops beating
Even when my eyes go blind
All I need is your heartbeat beating
Next to mine
Next to mine
Next to mine

I see you when I close my eyes
I see you like I did that night
Now underneath the hi-lo lights
I see you there
I see you there

I see you when I close my eyes
I see you like I did that night
Now underneath the hi-lo lights
I see you there
I see you there

And I said
When I'm with you, well, it's just like it's the first time
