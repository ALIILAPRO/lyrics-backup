		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now I'm on the head of the arrow
And I'm the head of the fountain
Come to think about it, I can't wrap my head around it
Liquid nitrogen around us, flowing like a river downward
Stayin' stiff and rigid under pressure, crush you into powder
Pick petals from your flowers, oh, you love me, oh, you love me not
Now there's only one way down a tower, even if your hair is long
I claw my way towards the top and let it fall down to the bottom
Every day I swallow pain, but I still taste it

Wash, wash, wash, wash the pain away
Three, three, three, three stars on the shield, okay
Walk, walk, walk, walk, walkin' with the faith
Drip drop, rain won't stop on a sunny day
Wash, wash, wash, wash the pain away
Three, three, three, three stars on the shield, okay
Walk, walk, walk, walk, walkin' under faith
Drip drop, rain won't stop on a sunny day

Uphill, easy, the diamond top
We draw the line and then we cross
We hold the light, it opens up
Prepare the way, the trust in us
The void to face be bold enough
The faith corrupts, then self-destructs
I take that path, I make that jump
To drop below, to take me up

Show me the virtue of the way
Show me virtue, all the way

Show me the virtue of the way
