		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Harness all you've got, tell me
Boy I think it's time we slay their guesses
I've wrapped you in my justice as you walked in
Believe it or not, just take it in stride
It's burning, burning

Taking those limos of silence
I'm sliding the aisles of your lines
I'm wearing this new skin of patience
Alright

Tell me where's the limits of your own thirst
Boy I'll see us somewhere on its edges
You look like a baffle and I like it
Our sleeves are full of aces, let me game it
Your swell is burning 

Taking those limos of silence
While driving the highways of light
I'm wearing this new skin of patience 
Maybe I'm trying too hard 
Trying too hard 
We're trying too hard 
Alright 

Forget what you're not, this dance is your prey
Boundaries only waiting to be broken
Icons are not shimmering when it's pitch black
Let our initials burn in the same light
You're burning, burning
