		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  From a land across the ocean
To the western front where they served
Fought with courage and devotion
Preconceptions turned
As the spring offensive kept churning
Where the men would earn their name
See the tides of battle turning
And their foes ignite their flame

Hear the toll of the bell
Kept fighting for six months in hell
As the war rages on, they fight at the edge of the Argonne

Hear the toll of the bell, over six months in hell
Out of the trenches they came
As the war rages on, at the edge of the Argonne
Hellfighters earning their name

They would have no prisoners taken
And they never lost any ground
Earned the cross of war unshaken
Never turned around
As the armistice drawing closer, the 369th
Kept on fighting until it was over
And they were first to reach the Rhine

Hear the toll of the bell
Kept fighting for six months in hell
As the war rages on, they fight at the edge of the Argonne

Hear the toll of the bell, over six months in hell
Out of the trenches they came
As the war rages on, at the edge of the Argonne
Hellfighters earning their name

Hear the toll of the bell, over six months in hell
Out of the trenches they came
As the war rages on, at the edge of the Argonne
Hellfighters earning their name
