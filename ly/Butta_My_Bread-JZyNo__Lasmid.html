		  (Craze)
Nicki Minaj, come give me love
Gimme your body (ah, ah)
Butta my bread, sugar my tea
Gimme your coco (yeah, yeah)

Ain't nobody touching you
When they try it, they touching me (oh yeah, yeah)
Everybody crushing you
But I'm wanting to marry you

I no go carry another
You no say I be complete man, yeah
And your matter
E dey for my mind inside, yeah
Maame water
Baby, do me something nice, yeah
Girl, your matter
Girl, I love your body die, yeah
On me, on me, on me, on me, on me, on me, on me

Look at my big baby
The woman so nice and your skin so clean
She calling my love like a sweet 16
Over and over she can do my thing
(My thing, yeah)
She so in love with me
It's a blessing that I found a queen
And she doesn't care if I'm poor or rich
I give her my love 'til eternity

Oh no, no, no
Girl, I promise I will be there for you
Oh no, no, no
If you ever leave, I'll go hunting for you

My queen
Kiss you first thing in the morning, ah
For me
Baby, never treat you funny, oh

I no go carry another
You no say I be complete man, yeah
And your matter
E dey for my mind inside, yeah
Maame water
Baby, do me something nice, yeah
Girl, your matter
Girl, I love your body die, yeah

I no go carry another
You no say I be complete man, yeah
And your matter
E dey for my mind inside, yeah
Maame water
Baby, do me something nice, yeah
Girl, your matter
Girl, I love your body die, yeah
On me, on me, on me, on me, on me, on me, on me
On me, on me, on me, on me, on me, on me, on me
(Authentic mix)
