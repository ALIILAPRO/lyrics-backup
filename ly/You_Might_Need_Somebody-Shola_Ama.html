		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Need somebody 

Need somebody 
Need somebody 

When somebody reaches for your heart
Open up and let them through 
'Cause everybody 
Needs someone around 
Things can tumble down on you 

You discover when you look around 
You don't have to be alone 
Just one lover Is all you need to know 
When you're feeling all alone 

You might need somebody 
You might need somebody too 
(You might need somebody too)

You might need somebody 
You might need somebody too 
(You might need somebody too)

If there is fire stirring in your heart 
And you're sure it's strong and right 
Keep it burning through the cold and dark 
It can warm a lonely night 

You might need somebody 
You might need somebody too 
(You might need somebody too)

You might need somebody 
You might need somebody too 
(You might need somebody too)

You might need somebody 
You might need somebody too 
(You might need somebody too)

You might need somebody 
You might need somebody too 
(You might need somebody too)

Boy, you might need somebody too 
Need somebody

Boy, you're gonna need somebody too 
Need somebody

You might need somebody too, baby
Need somebody

Know i do

Everybody needs somebody
Need somebody

I know i need somebody

You're gonna need somebody too 
Need somebody

Too

I know i do

Need somebody

Too
