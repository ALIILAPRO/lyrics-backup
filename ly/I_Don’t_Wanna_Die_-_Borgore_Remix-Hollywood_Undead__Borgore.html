		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't wanna die,
I don't wanna die,
I don't wanna die
So you're gonna have to

I don't wanna die,
I don't wanna die,
No I don't wanna die
So you're gonna have to

Blood is getter hotter
Body's getting colder
I've told you once,
I'm the only one who holds her

I don't wanna die,
I don't wanna die,
I don't wanna die
So you're gonna have to

I look inside of myself,
And try to find someone else
Someone who's willing to die,
Instead of watching you cry for help.
I know that blood will be spilled,
And if you wont, then I will.
My grave will never be filled,
It's either kill or be killed.
So let heaven be told,
That some may come some may go,
Where I'll end up, I don't know.
But I ain't dying alone,
I keep on asking the question,
"Can I be saved by confession?"
You see this blood on my hands at least there's no reaching to Heaven.
I got to pick up the pieces,
I got to bury them deep
And when you look into my eyes
I'll be the last thing you see

I don't wanna die,
I don't wanna die,
I don't wanna die
So you're gonna have to.

I don't wanna die,
I don't wanna die,
No I don't wanna die
So you're gonna have to.

Words turned into blood, and the blood keeps on pouring,
From every pour I wipe it up, cause this just could be the moment
Now someone gotta die and now my only opponent
'Cause I won't watch my baby cry,
So I keep on just going.
Am I a man or a beast,
Its mother nature at least
Watch humanity cease,
Cause it's our human disease.
You got to kill when you gotta kill,
Yeah that's what they say.
And I can't go against God's will,
You better pray
'Cause I'm an angel, a demon.
Yeah I'm hell and I'm heaven
I'm everything you couldn't be, now you believe in the devil.
I got to pick up the pieces, I got to bury them deep
And when the dirt hits the coffin
Just go to sleep.

I don't wanna die,
I don't wanna die,
I don't wanna die
So you're gonna have to.

I don't wanna die,
I don't wanna die,
No I don't wanna die
So you're gonna have to.

Blood is getter hotter
Body's getting colder

I've told you once,
I'm the only one who holds her
I don't wanna die,
I don't wanna die,
I don't wanna die

Now that I see
I see you buried
Six feet below.

Another life, goes into the night.
I couldn't let him breathe,
'Cause I didn't wanna die

Now that I see
I see you buried
Six feet below.

It's not alright
Can't you hear me as I cry?
I couldn't let you live,
'Cause I didn't wanna die

I don't wanna die,
I don't wanna die,
No I don't wanna die

I don't wanna die,
I don't wanna die,
I don't wanna die,
So you're gonna have to.

I don't wanna die.
I don't wanna die.
No I don't wanna die
So you're gonna have to.
