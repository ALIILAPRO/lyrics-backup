		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't write me no more letters
My mailbox is full of bombs
Between you and the kooks on my block
I don't remember the good times
I wasn't there and you were kind
And my wife has some dogs in our yard
And I cannot hold a candle for every pretty girl
We were strangers many hours
And I missed you for so long
When we were lions, lovers in combat
Faded like your name on those jeans that I burned

But I am older now
And we did it when we were young
I am older now
And we did it when we were young

There are no reasons to believe
I buried my faith on the block
With your heart and your clothes
When I find
I don't feel you or recall
I'll put your bones out in the yard
Someone else to be called and called by
And I cannot hold a candle for every pretty girl
We were strangers many hours
And I missed you for so long
When we were lions, lovers in combat
Faded like your name on those jeans that I burned

But I am older now
And we did it when we were young
I am older now
And we did it when we were young
