		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Pick it up

Bet my money on a stupid horse, I lost that
So I ran out to the track to get my cash back
I just gotta leave this place with a big bag
So I found the fuckin' jockey and I grabbed that (pick it up)
Pushed him down to the ground and I punched him in his face (in his face)
Yeah, I stole his phone, that put him in his place (in his place)
Me on the horse, we ran out of the place (the place)
Then we took my Porsche back to my place

Stupid horse, I just fell out of the Porsche
Lost the money in my bank account, oh no
Stupid horse, I just fell out of the Porsche
Lost the money in my bank account, oh no
Stupid horse, I just fell out of the Porsche
Lost the money in my bank account, oh no
Stupid horse, I just fell out of the Porsche
Lost the money in my bank account

Woo
Pick it up

Stupid horse and a swordfish dancer (pick it up)
Bet my money on a fishnet carousel
Go, go, go, go, go so fast now
Go, go, go, go, go so fast now
Racing horses at the derby
Why am I never getting lucky?
I never have any money
I never win any money

Stupid horse, I just fell out of the Porsche
Lost the money in my bank account, oh no
Stupid horse, I just fell out of the Porsche
Lost the money in my bank account, oh no
Stupid horse, I just fell out of the Porsche (oh shit)
Lost the money in my bank account, oh no (oh no)
Stupid horse, I just fell out of the Porsche (oh no)
Lost the money in my bank account, oh no
Stupid horse, I just fell out of the Porsche (of the Porsche)
Lost the money in my bank account, oh no (oh no)
Stupid horse, I just fell out of the Porsche (of the Porsche)
Lost the money in my bank account
