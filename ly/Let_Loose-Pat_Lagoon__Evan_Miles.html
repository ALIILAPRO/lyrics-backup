		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let loose I wanna see what you can do
When you not with your crew
And it's just me you
No truce got it keep it real with the goon
Let it rain for a minute
Cuz I wanna fill the room like
What you singing ?
Why you dancing ?
Just here for the night why you asking ?
Just wanna get down to the bops
Wanna groove till the sound of the music just stops like
What you singing ?
Why you dancing?
Just here for the night why you asking?
I know what you want
I know what you need
Just want bitta fun with your friends
I can see, I can see , I can see

There's people talking
There's people watching
I can feel the tension
No need to mention
You got this ,you got this, you got this...

Let loose
Gotta let me yawn in the mornin'
Fat man pants and the slides that I'm wearing '
Twenty past no fucks given in the evening
Post dead pics on the insta
Why you creeping ?
Woman crush all day
This baddie thinks I'm schemin'
Messing with the boys
Chill yard just gassing
18 plus no kids stop asking
18 plus no kids stop asking
Fake IDs good whiskey and some flaggings
Trash remix these kids always lacking
No Budweiser boys start cracking
Polo and Golf and the tunes start blarin'
Too much heat so your parents stop caring
Burnt to crisp and you all start swearing
(And you all start swearing)
And you all start
Air Force 1s all white all black and suede with the gum soles
Recess bells and the city wanna come through
Blast this sound let it soar like a comet
Don't scroll pass this
Like share comment
Goods times take time
Gain it from the planet
Live a free life or wait
You can plan it
Or wait you can plan it
You can plan
Let's loose let looose
Let loose let loose

There's people talking
There's people watching
I can feel the tension
No need to mention
You got this ,you got this, you got this...
