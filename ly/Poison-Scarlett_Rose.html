		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The strongest man of them all
Has me writing a sad song
Are you insane, son?
It's just like the night of The Fall
Where is the drug that you have me hooked on?
And although I got men galore
You're in my pores, and Mon amour
Is there a cure? I'm not so sure
Cause I adore you
On my knees, here's my confession
Can't get rid of this infection
Running through my veins
Like you are poison
Poisonous snake
Sculpture carved in pure perfection
I cling to this fascination
Running through my veins
Baby, you're poison
Poison to me
When I sing I look at you
Tell me, how does it feel, now
To see I'm a star? (And I shine bright, shine bright)
Darling, snap out of the blue (Don't make me sad)
I'm in the Olympus
And I want you out
And although I got men galore
You're in my pores, and Mon amour
Is there a cure? I'm not so sure
Cause I adore you
On my knees, here's my confession
Can't get rid of this infection
Running through my veins
Like you are poison
Poisonous snake
Sculpture carved in pure perfection
I cling to this fascination
Running through my veins
Baby, you're poison
Poison to me
Come with me on the darkest night
I'mma help you stay awake (Don't close your eyes)
Don't know what took you that much time
Need the antidote today (Shoot it up!)
Diamond tears, you're like ice to me
Even if I'd give you fame (Do you know my name?)
I want you here right by my side
So I'll fix my past mistakes
On my knees, here's my confession
Can't get rid of this infection
Running through my veins
Like you are poison
Poisonous snake
Sculpture carved in pure perfection
I cling to this fascination
Running through my veins
Baby, you're poison
Poison to me
On my knees, here's my confession
Can't get rid of this infection
Running through my veins
Like you are poison
Poisonous snake
Sculpture carved in pure perfection
I cling to this fascination
Running through my veins
Baby, you're poison
Poison to me
