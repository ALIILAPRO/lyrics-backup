		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I count down all the hours
The days have been obsessed
The numbers they show
The victims of my fold

I want to end it all
Embrace the ones who call
Please answer me
I need to see
6121
I think that I hate everyone

Why have you abandoned me
You forsaken me
This is what you want from me
To die within


I tried to fly for the world to see
But now they're looking at me differently
I went too close to the sun
I'm burning away
I've paid my debts
These are all my grievances

Please save me
There's something wrong with me

The faces melt in my own head
My eyes go black
Now i can see the numbers on the wall
The meaning of it all
When all is said and done
You'll see 
6121

I think that I hate everyone

I tried to fly for the world to see
But now they're looking at me differently
I went too close to the sun
I'm burning away
I've paid my debts
Now judge my awakening 

Bleed
Your life for me
I am the end
Deliver me
