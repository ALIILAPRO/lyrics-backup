		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wanna turn those blue lights into strobe lights
Not blue flashing lights, maybe fairy lights
Those blue lights into strobe lights
Maybe even fairy lights, not blue flashing lights

Don't you run when you hear the sirens coming
When you hear the sirens coming you'd better not run
'Cause the sirens not coming for you
What have you done? You went to school that day
Was a bit late, but it wasn't Monday
Kept after class for answering back
You apologized, ain't no harm in that

(I wanna turn those blue lights) What have you done?
(Into strobe lights) There's no need to run 
(Not blue flashing lights) If you've done nothing wrong 
Blue lights should just pass you by (maybe even fairy lights)

Gun crime into your right ear
Drugs and violence into your left
Before white headphones flooding 
The auditory subconscious waves you accept
You're sitting on the 4 back home
(Where you're at G answer your phone?)
Pause the poison to answer his message
Your boy sounds rush, fears for his adolescent

(I wanna turn those blue lights) What have you done?
(Into strobe lights) There's no need to run 
(Not blue flashing lights) If you've done nothing wrong
Blue lights should just pass you by (maybe even fairy lights)

Tall black shadow as you're getting off the bush
Shadow shows no emotion, so what's even the fuss?
But the face of your boy casts a darker picture
Of the red handed act he's gonna whisper

Look blood, I'm sorry 'cause I know you got my back
He was running, I couldn't think I had to get out of that
Not long ago, you were miming to the "Shook Ones"
Now this really is part two, 'cause you're the shook one
Hands you the tool as you question your friendship
How's man like you gonna make me a convict?
Level of a felon when I've done nothing wrong
Blood on my hands, but I don't know where it's from, oh
You got blood on your hands, but you don't know where it's from

You'd better run when you hear the sirens coming
When you hear the sirens coming
Better run when you hear the sirens coming 
'Cause they will be coming for you
Run when you hear the sirens coming
Better run when you hear the sirens coming
When you hear the sirens coming
The blue lights are coming for you

(I wanna turn those blue lights) What have you done?
(Into strobe lights) There's no need to run 
(Not blue flashing lights) If you done nothing wrong
Blue lights should just pass you by hmm (maybe even fairy lights)

Run when you hear the sirens coming
Don't you run when you hear the sirens coming
Run when you hear the sirens coming
Don't you run when you hear the sirens coming
What have you done
Don't you run
Don't you run
Don't you run when you hear the sirens coming
