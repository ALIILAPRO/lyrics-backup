		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  White walls surround us,
No light will touch your face again
Rain taps the window
As we sleep among the dead

Days go on forever,
But I have not left your side
We can chase the dark together,
If you go then so will I

There is nothing left of you,
I can see it in your eyes
Sing the anthem of the angels
And say the last goodbye

Cold light above us,
Hope fills the heart and fades away
Skin white as winter,
As the sky returns to gray

Days go on forever,
But I have not left your side
We can chase the dark together,
If you go then so will I

There is nothing left of you,
I can see it in your eyes
Sing the anthem of the angels,
And say the last goodbye

I keep holding onto you,
But I can't bring you back to life
Sing the anthem of the angels,
And say the last goodbye

You're dead alive
You're dead alive
You're dead alive
You're dead alive

There is nothing left of you,
I can see it in your eyes
Sing the anthem of the angels,
And say the last goodbye

I keep holding onto you,
But I can't bring you back to life
Sing the anthem of the angels,
And say the last goodbye

Sing the anthem of the angels,
And say the last goodbye

Sing the anthem of the angels
