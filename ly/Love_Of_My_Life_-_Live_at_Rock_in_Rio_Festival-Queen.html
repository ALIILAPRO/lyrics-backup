		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Love of my life, you've hurt me
You've broken my heart and now you leave me
Love of my life, can't you see?
Bring it back, bring it back
Don't take it away from me, because you don't know
What it means to me

Love of my life, don't leave me
You've stolen my love, you now desert me
Love of my life, can't you see?
Bring it back, bring it back 
Don't take it away from me
Because you don't know
What it means to me

Obrigado

You will remember
When this is blown over
Everything's all by the way
When I grow older
I will be there at your side to remind you
How I still love you (I still love you)

I still love you 

Oh, hurry back, hurry back
Don't take it away from me
You don't know what it means to me
Love of my life
Love of my life
Ooh, eh (alright)
