		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got a love that keeps on fighting,
It keeps on.
I got a heart that keeps on trying,
It keeps on.
We got this planet, keeps evolving,
It keeps on.
Even when our hope is broken,
We keep on.

People,
There's so much for us to prove,
So keep on,
There's so much for us to do,
Just we can start a revolution,
You and me,
I say we start a revolution,
Just you and me.

Start revolution.
People.
Start revolution.

I got a love that keeps on fighting,
It keeps on,
I got a heart that keeps on trying,
It keeps on,
People,
Tell me what you gonna do,
So keep on,
Show me what you gonna choose,
'Cause we can start a revolution,
You and me,
I say we start a revolution,
Just you and me,
Start revolution.

People.

Start revolution.
