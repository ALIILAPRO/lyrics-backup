		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can I? Ok

I'm missing your bed
I never sleep
Avoiding the spots where we'd have to speak
And this bottle of beast is taking me home

I'm cuddling close to blankets and sheets
But you're not alone, and you're not discreet
Make sure I know who's taking you home

I'm reading your note over again
There's not a word that I comprehend
Except when you signed it
"I will love you always and forever"

As for now I'm gonna hear the saddest songs
And sit alone and wonder
How you're making out
And as for me, I wish that I was anywhere with anyone
Making out

I'm missing your laugh
How did it break?
And when did your eyes begin to look fake?
I hope you're as happy as you're pretending

I'm cuddling close to blankets and sheets
And I am alone
In my defeat I wish I knew you were safely at home

I'm missing your bed
I never sleep
Avoiding the spots where we'd have speak
And this bottle of beast is taking me home

Well, as for now I'm gonna hear the saddest songs
And sit alone and wonder
How you're making out
And as for me, I wish that I was anywhere with anyone
Making out

Your hair, it's everywhere
Screaming infidelities
And taking its wear

Your hair, it's everywhere
Screaming infidelities
And taking its wear

Your hair, it's everywhere
Screaming infidelities
And taking its wear

Your hair, it's everywhere
Screaming infidelities
And taking its wear
