		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dream about a day where I'll be happy somewhere else
Scared to love you, life is like I'm just a rag doll on your shelf

Oh, you're not a man
Not even a boy, you can't comprehend
I keep talking, why can't no one hear me?
I don't understand

Sent poison through my veins
Took something, never explained
Why can't nobody ever hear me out?
Poison through my veins
Took something, never explained
Why can't nobody ever hear me out? (hear me out)

Thanks for making me believe I was the one to blame
Your emotional deception made me think I was insane (ohh)

Oh, you're not a man
Not even a boy, you can't comprehend (ohh)
Everybody's watching like a show but they aren't listening

Sent poison through my veins
Took something, never explained
Why can't nobody ever hear me out?
Poison through my veins
Took something, never explained
Why can't nobody ever hear me out?

I guess that's just a part of me
That I will always have to grieve
Took my soul and let it bleed
You stole what should belong to me

Poison through my veins
Took something, never explained
Why can't nobody ever hear me out?
Poison through my veins
Took something, never explained
Why can't nobody ever hear me out?

Hear me out
Why can't you just hear me out?
