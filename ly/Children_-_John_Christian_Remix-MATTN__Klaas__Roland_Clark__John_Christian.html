		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Follow me
Follow me to the place where the sun meets the moon
Where all our differences fall away 
Like stars from space
Where rhythm and life are one and the same

Follow me into tomorrow
Where all that exists is time and space
And the anticipation of a brand new day
For us to sing, laugh, dance, and play

Follow me, follow me
Follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me
Follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me
Follow me, follow me, follow me, follow

Follow me (follow me)

Follow me to the place where the sun meets the moon
Where all our differences fall away 
Like stars from space
Where rhythm and life are one and the same

Follow me
Open your heart, let's take a chance
On the world
We can find peace with just one dance
Follow me
Open your heart, let's take a chance
On the world
On the world
On the world

Follow me
Follow me into tomorrow
Where all that exists is time and space
And the anticipation of a brand new day
For us to sing, laugh, dance, and play

Follow me, follow me
Follow me, follow me, follow me, follow

Follow me (follow me)

Follow me to the place where the sun meets the moon
Where all our differences fall away 
Like stars from space
Where rhythm and life are one and the same
