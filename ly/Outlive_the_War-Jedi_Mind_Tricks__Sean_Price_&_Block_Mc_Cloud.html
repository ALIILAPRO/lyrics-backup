		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You don't really want a close encounter
This dude's talkin' like he
Knows the bouncers
I move up on ya face for talkin' outta place
Get your spine ripped out
By Jedi Mind Tricks, ouch!
And ain't nobody gangsta, we just fight good
Left jab, uppercut, then a right hook
Jedi Mind spit rhymes like I write hooks
Type you don't wanna fight wit
Jedi Mind Tricks

Hey yo, great rap outta BC, the track
The beat beast master, heat clapper
Speakin' the facts
Keys to the 'Lac, weed in the back
Foot on the gas
Squeezin' the gat, leave it at that
My foot in yo' ass
Listen, bust your rat, you
Scream, Ruck is back, bitch
"You gonna fuck up your career
You hear?" Fuck the rap shit
I make the same money when
I hustle this crack shit
Probably make more cause a nigga
Don't pay no taxes
Access the gun's off the earth axis
Axis of evil
The eagle 'll leave your hat split
Ruck flow is like "Fuck you, God"
I don't wanna rhyme
I need a construction job
Listen, backpack rap, Jansporter crew
Big guns and fast cars, Transporter, too
I camcord your crew with a clip in they mouth
Sean Price, fuck you riffin' about?
Shut the fuck up, yeah

You don't really want a close encounter
This dude's talkin' like he
Knows the bouncers
I move up on ya face for talkin' outta place
Get your spine ripped out
By Jedi Mind Tricks, ouch!
And ain't nobody gangsta, we just fight good
Left jab, uppercut, then a right hook
Jedi Mind spit rhymes like I write hooks
Type you don't wanna fight wit
Jedi Mind Tricks

I put you in the fuckin' torture rack
I carry forty gats and pure black
That send you and your spiritual to
Where the Lord is at
You read "Behold a Pale Horse"? Well
I authored that and on top of that
Vinnie the owner of a gorgeous gat
I don't trust nobody, cousin
I'm a cautious cat i see inside your eyes
It's where demonic forces at
Fuck around and get laced with the Luger
If you sympathize with the
Hellinization of Judah
My place is the future
Everybody say "The boy nice"
Philly to Brooklyn
Brooklyn to Philly with Sean Price
I'm not sayin' I'm the nicest around
I'm just sayin' I'm the nicest with
The knife and the pound
I'm strikin' you down
Pazienza always on the block
You the type to take a L
And fuckin' call the cops
Cross the other side of street
Because you saw it's hot
Call me Mike Fratello baby, cause
I call the shots, yeah, pussy

You don't really want a close encounter
This dude's talkin' like he
Knows the bouncers
I move up on ya face for talkin' outta place
Get your spine ripped out
By Jedi Mind Tricks, ouch!
And ain't nobody gangsta, we just fight good
Left jab, uppercut, then a right hook
Jedi Mind spit rhymes like I write hooks
Type you don't wanna fight wit

I'm comin' at you with various weapons
Hittin' your body in various sections
Even the mutha fuckin' devil was
There when I blessed him
Better selection of clappers then you
Jesus Price, Pazienza better rappers then you
I've had it with you
Every rhyme I write a testament
About the war and our apocalyptic president
About how I studied the science of raw
How I carry Desert Eagle's and
Defy it's a law my violence is pure
Walk the battlefield with stainlesses
They say I'm deranged
Disconnected and dangerous
My rap is sharp enough to slash
Your fuckin' veins and wrist
I'll put a knife into my heart
To see if pain exists
My forty cal' is fuckin' dyin' to bust
It could teach you how to bleed and
How to die in the dust
Yeah, I'm tryin' to organize
With people I identify
While Bush and Cheney sit
And celebrate a genocide, yeah

You don't really want a close encounter
This dude's talkin' like he
Knows the bouncers
I move up on ya face for talkin' outta place
Get your spine ripped out
By Jedi Mind Tricks, ouch!
And ain't nobody gangsta, we just fight good
Left jab, uppercut, then a right hook
Jedi Mind spit rhymes like I write hooks
Type you don't wanna fight
Wit, Jedi Mind Tricks, ouch!
