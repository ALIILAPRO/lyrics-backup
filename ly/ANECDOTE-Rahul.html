		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Truth be told,
I could do with lies
who am I?
I want ooh and ahh's on the day I die
I can not decide
It's okay outside
I need me a light and the way of right,
right away.
Don't be switchin' sides with the same old signs,
I don't play.
My new shawty dime
I prefer the fines I don't pay.
Still I'm waiting for a brighter day,
Andal√©
On an anecdote of I might day today,
what a day.

Oh my God bitch I feel amazing
This lil maze I been facin' feel like the matrix

Hate me, love me,
it don't really change shit

Just hold me down, I'ma hold us till we hit the pavement.

Truth be told, I could do with lies.

We gon' be alright, you just hold on tight.
I could use a hand, cause it's out of mine.
We come and go, come and cry, you could say goodbye.
Don't wait-till it's too late.

Truth be told I could do with lies.
