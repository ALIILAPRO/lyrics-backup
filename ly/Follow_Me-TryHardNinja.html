		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  He's been waiting abandoned and patient
So long (Long)
Long (Long)
A savage masked ghost story from the past
He roams (Roams)
Roams (Roams)

He said follow me
Follow follow follow
Over 30 years ago
When he took them down below
And tonight he walks again
So step inside enjoy the show

Follow me
Then you'll see
Follow follow follow follow
But the truth is hard to swallow
Follow me
Then you'll see
Follow follow follow follow
Follow me see a nightmare in action

Deeds so rotten came back to haunt him
They know (Know)
Know (Know)
Forever changed he wears his spring locked grave
Alone (Alone)
Alone (Alone)

He said follow me
Follow follow follow
All the horrors have been sealed
Boarded up they were concealed
But its time for the real monster's face to finally be revealed

Follow me
Then you'll see
Follow follow follow follow
But the truth is hard to swallow
Follow me
Then you'll see
Follow follow follow follow
Follow me see a nightmare in action
