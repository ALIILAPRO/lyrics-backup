		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You make a promise
I don't believe it like usual
You say you'll stop it
You must think that I'm delusional

When we're together I still feel alone
You drive me crazy while I drive you home
Never say thank you, just goodbye
So

Hush, baby, don't say a word
I've heard enough from you
Hush, baby, it's all a blur
But still I can see right through

Your lips say one thing,
Your eyes say another
I can't believe
That I was your lover and a lie
A lover and a lie

Made my decision
I can't get back all the time you stole
You say you'll fix it
It's gonna take a whole miracle

I figured out that I'm better alone
Instead of just watching you stare at your phone
Why won't you look me in the eyes?
So

Hush, baby, don't say a word
I've heard enough from you
Hush, baby, it's all a blur
But still I can see right through

Your lips say one thing,
Your eyes say another
I can't believe
That I was your lover and a lie
A lover and a lie

Hush
Your eyes say one thing
Your lips say another
Hush
Your eyes say one thing (one thing)
Your lips say another

(Hush, hush, hush)
Your lips say another
