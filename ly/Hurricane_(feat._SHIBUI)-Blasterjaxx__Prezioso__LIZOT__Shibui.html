		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fade away like a hurricane, we fought until the end
And again we're risin' and gettin' up from the water
Today, we're gonna fade away like a hurricane, we fought until the end
And again we're risin' and gettin' up from the water

Today, we're gonna fade away
The harder to say
The better the way
But they can't beat your count (whoa)
This is not a lie
You glow in the light
You don't ever need to run

Today, we're gonna fade away like a hurricane, we fought until the end
And again we're risin' and gettin' up from the water
Today, we're gonna fade away like a hurricane, we fought until the end
And again we're risin' and gettin' up from the water
Today, we're gonna fade away like a hurricane, we fought until the end
And again we're risin' and gettin' up from the water
Today, we're gonna fade away like a hurricane, we fought until the end
And again we're risin' and gettin' up from the water

We might just fade away, we don't care what they say
Everything will go, will go in place
And if you fear the pain, there's no one else to blame
So are you ready now to play the game?

Gotta make, gotta make, gotta make more
Nobody, nobody, nobody knows
Nobody knows what's right in front of you
Follow me, follow me, follow me home
Nobody, nobody, nobody knows
Nobody knows what's right in front of you

Today, we're gonna fade away like a hurricane, we fought until the end
And again we're risin' and gettin' up from the water
Today, we're gonna fade away like a hurricane, we fought until the end
And again we're risin' and gettin' up from the water
Today, we're gonna fade away like a hurricane, we fought until the end
And again we're risin' and gettin' up from the water
Today, we're gonna fade away like a hurricane, we fought until the end
And again we're risin' and gettin' up from the water
