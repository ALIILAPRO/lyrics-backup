		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hello, my friend
I'm gonna be here 'til the end
Of the universe, if I can
I wanna fly, up in the sky, sky, sky

I wanna dance with you
Take my hand, and I'll show you a few moves
This is it; no more sorrow
Leave the living for today, and dying for tomorrow

No, I can't tell you how to say goodbye
Cause' I've been waiting most of my life
Behind the curtain, she's staring at my grave
She slowly dances on her hospital bed, hospital bed

Well, I say what I mean
And I got all I need
But I stand at nineteen
Fell from the heavens, I'm the sun king
What ya got? What ya need?
Thank your god, and get off your knees
'Cause you're giving just to please
Oh, leave the living for today, and dying for tomorrow

No, I can't tell you how to say goodbye
'Cause I've been waiting most of my life
Behind the curtain, she's staring at my grave
She slowly dances on her hospital bed, hospital bed

(Oh!)
(Okay!)
(No, no, no, no, no, no, no)
(Ow!)

Well, I saw the world at its worst
And I lived with Jesus first
I am so blessed and cursed
Layin' in the back of this Cadillac hearse
I saw an angel cry
You saw the devil die
Well, I have the last goodbye
Layin' in the back of this Cadillac hearse

Well, no, I can't tell you
How to say goodbye

No, I can't tell you how to say goodbye
'Cause I've been waiting most of my life
Behind the curtain, she's staring at my grave
She slowly dances on her hospital bed, hospital bed...
