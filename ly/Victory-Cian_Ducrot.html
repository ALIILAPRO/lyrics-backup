		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ever since I was a little kid
I was never a favorite
But I dreamt of growing up
And maybe, one day I'd change it
But I got used to it
Having no one to play with
Even grown-ups walking out
Oh, I remember the day that

I was standing in front of you, picking sides in our living room
Who would've thought I'd be losing you?
I remember I'd have begged if you'd asked me to
Anything just not to lose, left your kid with some issues

Then I grew up a bit, realized I was different
Well, it was not that I wished it, but it was hard not to hear it
In every school kid and I tried not to give it worth
Or stir the pot and make it worse
Or just end up getting hurt

Oh, I've got so much to say
The life we live makes us this way

Oh, just leave me in your memory
'Cause my heart can't take the part where you come back to me
Oh, yes, I know it's for the best of me
If I never fought, then you'd never have to leave
And the sweeter the-
The sweeter the victory, victory
The sweeter the victory, victory

Am I just the product of a boy who wasn't loved by his father?
Spent my life chasing praise, just to end up a monster
I got a note from my doctor, he said to not even bother
'Cause, when you're messed up as a kid
You'll pass it on to your daughter

And it gets worse on your partner
All the pain that I'm harboring
Shoots me down like an armory
But it's always been part of me
Learn to live by the glory of knowing
It doesn't hold me and choke me
And now I'm looking at these pictures on my phone when you're gone
And thinking, maybe I messed up and I was wrong
Maybe I messed up and I was wrong

Oh, I've got so much to say
The life we live makes us this way

Oh, just leave me in your memory
'Cause my heart can't take the part where you come back to me
Oh, yes, I know it's for the best of me
If I never fought, then you'd never have to leave
And the sweeter the-
The sweeter the victory, victory
The sweeter the victory, victory

All of my life, never felt so right now
The sweeter the victory, victory
All of my life, never felt so right now
The sweeter the victory, victory
