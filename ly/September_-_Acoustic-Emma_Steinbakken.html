		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I broke down in September
God knows why, 'cause we're both to pretty to complain
It rained, you said, "It's okay"
But I still broke down (in September)
You said forever
I said sure
If you want to
That's all cool
But summer's gon' be over soon
(Over soon)
 
September came and I raised hell
September came and I raised hell, ooh
No one's as pretty as you
But no one raise hell like we do
High up in the sky and we raised hell
So close to heaven but we raised hell, ooh
No one's as pretty as you
But no one raise hell like we do
 
High up in the sky and we raised hell
No one's gone there like we do
No one's gone there like we do
High up in the sky and we raised hell
No one's gone there like we do
No one's gone there like we do

We asked for trouble
Everything we touched would burst like a, burst like a bubble
No bother, we needed each other
So let there be trouble
You said forever
I said sure
If you want to
That's all cool
But summer's gon' be over soon
(Over soon)
 
September came and I raised hell
September came and I raised hell, ooh
No one's as pretty as you
But no one raise hell like we do
High up in the sky and we raised hell
So close to heaven but we raised hell, ooh
No one's as pretty as you
But no one raise hell like we do
 
High up in the sky and we raised hell
No one's gone there like we do
No one's gone there like we do
High up in the sky and we raised hell
No one's gone there like we do
No one's gone there like we do

September came and I raised hell
September came and I raised hell, ooh
No one's as pretty as you
But no one raise hell like we do
High up in the sky and we raised hell
So close to heaven but we raised hell, ooh
No one's as pretty as you
But no one raise hell like we do
 
High up in the sky and we raised hell
No one's gone there like we do
No one's gone there like we do
High up in the sky and we raised hell
No one's gone there like we do
No one's gone there like we do
