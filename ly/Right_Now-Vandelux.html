		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She said we’re way too far
To turn back now
I can feel the weight
Trying to hold us down

She said we’re way too far
And I don’t know how
But I’ve never felt as good
As I do right now

I’ve never felt as good
As I do right now

I’ve never felt as good
As I do right now

I’ve never felt as good
As I do right now

She said we’re way too far
To turn back now
I can feel the weight
Trying to hold us down

She said we’re way too far
And I don’t know how
But I’ve never felt as good
As I do right now

I’ve never felt as good
As I do right now

I’ve never felt as good
As I do right now

I’ve never felt as good
As I do right now
