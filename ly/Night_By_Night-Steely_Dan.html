		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's a beggars life, said the Queen of Spain 
But don't tell it to a poor man
Cause he's got to kill for every thrill 
The best he can
Everywhere around me 
I see jealousy and mayhem 
Because no men have all their peace of mind 
To carry them
Well I don't really care 
If it's wrong or if it's right 
But until my ship comes in
I'll live night by night

When the joker tried to tell me 
I could cut it in this rube town
When he tried to hang that sign on me
I said take it down
When the dawn patrol got to tell you twice 
They're gonna do it with a shotgun 
Yes, I'm cashing in this ten-cent life 
For another one

Well I ain't got the heart 
To lose another fight 
So until my ship comes in
I'll live night by night

Well I don't really care 
If it's wrong or if it's right 
But until my ship comes in
I'll live night by night
