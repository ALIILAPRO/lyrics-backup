		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She's the kinda girl that turns a breath into a gag 
She blows me away kicks me up in the morning 
Her kinda of loving turns the greatest fuck into a drag 
But here's the real work of art 

she gives me kiss and caress and a smack with a frying-pan 
Wam bam spit teeth enjoy the fun 
Love me, then leave, me then love me again 
I'm still standing I'm addicted to the pain 

oh, goodness, gracious, vicious 
I'll be chopped and thrown to the fishes
I hope the fish don't find me delicious 

cause now my baby's come back
Waho! waho!
Cause now my baby's come back
Waho! waho!

I've gotten used to sit down and watch tv 
But now her flashy little tush wants to be my widescreen 
She's back, waho, waho!
Let's go!

I always hoped for this kinda woman to come my way 
The one who could shake me with the tip of her finger 
I'm shaken like a sissy in a hockey game 
Ain't got the looks of a rock'n'roll singer 

I'm all ripped up and I love it 
I'm smashed to pieces and I love it 
Love me then leave me then love me again 
I'm still standing I'm addicted to the pain 

she's giving me a big fat lip 
And when she's on that lippy-trip 
I wanna go back to the fingertip 

cause now my baby's come back
Waho! waho!
Cause now my baby's come back
Waho! waho!

I'm so used to sit down and watch tv 
But now her flashy little tush wants to be my widescreen 
She's back, waho, waho!
And a one and a two

now my baby's come back
Now my baby's come back

I'm gonna find them fish, delicious x3

now my baby's come back
Waho! waho!
Cause now my baby's come back
Waho! waho!

I've gotten used to sit down and watch tv 
But now her flashy little tush wants to be my widescreen 
She's back, waho, waho!

cause now my baby's come back
Waho, waho
She's come baaaaaack 
Cause now my baby's come baaaaack

she's come back,back,back,back,back
Waho, waho!
