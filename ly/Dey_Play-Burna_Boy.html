		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dey play

No be chise oh
Make we dey check for the light, oh
Olorun, ati wise oh
A de ti economize, oh
Olorun, on a mission
How many men follow me come?
Olorun, no dey think am
Akoba adaba, Olorun ma jaa ri

Eh-eh, ekelebe chasing
Eke-ekelebe chasing
I'm on the move like I'm speed-racing
So fast they couldn't believe it
Eh-eh, ekelebe chasing
Eke-ekelebe chasing
I'm on the move like I'm speed-racing
So fast they couldn't believe it

Dropped out of school from the first day
My teacher no get money
And my customers dem they call me
Last time I check I was balling
On a Sunday
Open the bank on a Sunday
Olorun, for God's sake
Shey you no dey see money walk, ay?
One Ferrari dey play
Two Lamborghini dey play, Maybach dey play
Drop top, the Rolls-Royce dey play
Soon I go wake up in a new Bugatti, dey play

Eh-eh, ekelebe chasing
Eke-ekelebe chasing
I'm on the move like I'm speed-racing
So fast they couldn't believe it
Eh-eh, ekelebe chasing
Eke-ekelebe chasing
I'm on the move like I'm speed-racing
So fast they couldn't believe it

Ooh, too many mileage
Man never sleep for like nine days
Phone dey vibrate, dem dey find me
If na fine babe, make she slide in
Oya je a lo Jaye
Lo do lai Shade
Alhaji Bashiru ko'wo wole
Dey play, just dey play
Straight from Archipelago
Private jet ni ma 'n fà agbo
Omo, these days, dem just dey take the trap like joke
And then they trap the ma 'n fà agbo (woohoo)

Eh-eh, ekelebe chasing
Eke-ekelebe chasing
I'm on the move like I'm speed-racing
So fast they couldn't believe it
Eh-eh, ekelebe chasing
Eke-ekelebe chasing
I'm on the move like I'm speed-racing
So fast they couldn't believe it

My lord, I've thought of an idea
Come on out of it
This time I guarantee you'll get what you want
But you'll have to be patient
Why?
If you could be a little bit patient
Then I guarantee you'll learn all the Wu-Tang secrets
