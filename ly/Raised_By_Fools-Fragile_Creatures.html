		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Get ready
Now pack your bags
I feel unsteady now
'Cause there's something off
The less that you know
They say it's better
But I just don't know
How can things get better
If we don't know
Stopped knowing
Right from wrong
Truth from fiction
In the lines of this song
While you were waiting
For the high to come back
Was it pushing you forwards
Or was it wolves at your back?
The less that you know
They say it's better
But I just don't know
How can things get better
If we don't know
What's going on
What's going on here?
What's going on?
Were you raised by fools?
Do you bend to their rules?
And now you're confused
How can things get better?
What can we do?
What's going on?
What's going on here?
What's going on?
What's going on? (What's going on?)
What's going on? (What's going on?)
What's going on? What's going on?
What's going on? What's going on?
What's going on? What's going...
