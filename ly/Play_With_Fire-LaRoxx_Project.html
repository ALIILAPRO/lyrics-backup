		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When you need my love
I am standing right there by your side
When you need my touch
I am holding my arms open wide

I hear your heartbeat in the night
I can see your eyes shining bright
I wanna play with fire
I wanna play with you
I wanna play with fire
And I know you want me too

I am standing by
And I'll be there whenever you call
I will care for you
And it's whether you rise or you fall

I hear your heartbeat in the night
I can see your eyes shining bright
I wanna play with fire
I wanna play with you
I wanna play with fire
And I know you want me too

I hear your heartbeat in the night
I can see your eyes shining bright
I wanna play with fire
I wanna play with you
I wanna play with fire
And I know you want me too

I wanna play with fire
I wanna play with you
I wanna play with fire
And I know you want me too
