		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I had told you that I need you
Would you throw it in my face?
If I had told you that I want you
Would you still look at me the same?

All I know is gone
Lost inside a moment
That I can't control
If all I know is wrong
Don't know what to feel
Was any of it real?

If you had told me I were breaking down
Would I have even changed?
Or were we passed the point of no return
It's too late to be saved

All I know is gone
Lost inside a moment
That I can't control
If all I know is wrong
Don't know what to feel
Was any of it real?

It's salt in the wound 'cause I 
Just cannot find the reason
I know that I don't feel right 
And I can't shake the feeling

All I know is gone
Lost inside a moment
That I can't control
If all I know is wrong
Don't know what to feel
Was any of it real?
