		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was riding on a bike
On a very late night
She gave me chills, I'm for real
Hey
I'm the one with soul, and I know your role
A real one for sure (for sure)
I won't fuel your coke, I won't fuel lipo
Oh no, no no

Oh yeah yeah, no
Oh yeah yeah, oh
Oh yeah yeah, oh
Look at that stand right there, that stand right there
That stand right there
Oh yeah yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah yeah

If I stunt and if you don't
I'll walk past the street
Next to my bike
Child on the front
Child on the bike like we livin' overseas
I had a dream these niggas stood over me
I had a bad bitch and she ate it off a cake
Drunk off your love and I just stood by the sink
Look in these eyes, they disguise, you the mink
I just popped like rubber bands on it
Her booty fly like LA, I just land on it
Yeah, top notch, Saran on it
Baby tell me where we stand
Her booty big as a Sedan, I'm like

Oh yeah yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah yeah
Look at that stand right there, that stand right there
That stand right there
Oh yeah yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah yeah

Now I be cruisin' to Lil Uzi
Talking shit so pass the toupee
We made a deal, ain't nothin' to do with it
I want head like a dinner date
I remember you popped your first bottle
I remember I had my first toddler
Nothin' changed, I remember I had my third toddler
Yeah lil Wanda, she was my sherm partner
Free lil unfunk he got an urg doctor
I ranned off on some of my cursed doctors
Dropped the racks right on 'em like a girl got 'em
I'm just singing babe, this your world, yeah yeah
And if I like 'em and you love 'em they deserve partners
You left a bag for me to see
You left a bag and now you hurt me
I only helped you pack your bag because you urk me
Do it hurt when you gone? I'm like

Oh yeah yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah yeah
Look at that stand right there, that stand right there
That stand right there
Oh yeah yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah yeah

Fuck 'em all and fuck what they thinkin'
First it wet then it multiplying
You still piped, you ain't take it down yeah
Mekhi Phifer, let's throw it down, yeah yeah
Bae you know that it's goin' down
I'm they ticket, they hold me down
And I'm so in love with the town
Much respect when you come around
I was riding on a bike
On a very late night
She gave me chills, I'm for real
