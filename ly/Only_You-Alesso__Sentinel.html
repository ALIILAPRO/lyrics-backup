		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We know it's over but it's alright
We'll keep dancin' in these bright lights
Boy, just take me for a night drive
'Cause I can't breathe

We know we're broken but it's alright
Babe, just hold me 'til the sunrise
You know it's only a matter of time
Just me and you tonight

Only you and I
Just me and you tonight

Only you and I
Babe, it's only a matter of time
Always you and I
Just me and you tonight

We know it's over but it's alright
We'll keep dancin' in these bright lights
Boy, just take me for a night drive
'Cause I can't breathe

We know we're broken but it's alright
Babe, just hold me 'til the sunrise
You know it's only a matter of time
Just me and you tonight

Only you and I
Babe, it's only a matter of time
Always you and I
Just me and you tonight
