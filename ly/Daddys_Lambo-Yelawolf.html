		  Hillbilly in Beverly Hills
(And so, Drama Beats)
Hold on

Damn rich, peanut butter guts and a Lamborghini, whoa
You must have white bread, let's make a sandwich (yeah)
Now, I ain't never seen money like you got (no)
Nobody got that kind of money in the Boondocks (no)
So if you take me up and show me the balcony 
lookin' over the Hollywood valley I'll make your balloon pop
Pop stars like you, you need a dude like me
To appreciate your wealth
I know you got an elevator in your house
But with me you appreciate the steps
Act like you don't wanna see how much it is Jack Daniels you can handle
You wanna drink and get cut like Rambo (Rambo)
And let me drive your Daddy's Lambo

Take me up to Beverly Hills to your Daddy's mansion
Let me see Hollywood for real
Lights, camera, action
I've seen you partying with keel, entertainment channel
One thing I gotta know
Can I drive your Daddy's Lambo?
Lambo, oh, oh (yeah)
Your Daddy's Lambo?
Lambo, oh, oh
Can I drive your Daddy's Lambo?
Lambo, oh, oh (yeah)
Your Daddy's Lambo?
Lambo, oh, oh
Can I drive your Daddy's Lambo?

Your young and reckless (yeah)
nice little diamond necklace (yeah)
Got a pint-sized vodka drink and your pretty in pink
Wanna go get breakfast?
Though you ain't never been to Waffle House
Always hanging in guys and dolls (yeah)
If you came to the shop, I'll put you in a Chevy AM
Reach out to the mall (come on)
Yeah, I came to the club in a pair of Famous jeans and DTA hoody
But walking through party with rogue status 
Looking for Beverly Hills goodies (what else?)
Yelawolf and I'm an Alabama boy
Got more bounce than a salamander, boy
Need a rich girl like I need a headache
But I'll take it if I can drive your Daddy's toy

Take me up to Beverly Hills to your Daddy's mansion
Let me see Hollywood for real
Lights, camera, action
I've seen you partying with keel, entertainment channel
One thing I gotta know
Can I drive your Daddy's Lambo?
Lambo, oh, oh (yeah)
Your Daddy's Lambo?
Lambo, oh, oh
Can I drive your Daddy's Lambo?
Lambo, oh, oh (yeah)
Your Daddy's Lambo?
Lambo, oh, oh
Can I drive your Daddy's Lambo? (Yeah)

What you got in that tote bag?
That one of a kind Prada
That beautiful behind inspires me
Makes one of my rhymes hotter
Your dada made a fine daughter (yeah)
Make me wanna turn this wine from water (yeah)
Keep the party going in and that 808 bumping 
'Cause Drummer made a beat that'll climb the chart up (yeah)
Money, money, money, money, money ain't it funny 
What a honey and a Lamborghini will do?
Some will run into a hundred dollar bill 
And drill a dick on anytime, unhappy with a 24-inch shoes
But come and explore this dude
Analyze my swing
It's Slick Rick and Bobby, baby
Gotta let me drop that thing, come on

Take me up to Beverly Hills to your Daddy's mansion
Let me see Hollywood for real
Lights, camera, action
I've seen you partying with keel, entertainment channel
One thing I gotta know
Can I drive your Daddy's Lambo?
Lambo, oh, oh (yeah)
Your Daddy's Lambo?
Lambo, oh, oh
Can I drive your Daddy's Lambo?
Lambo, oh, oh (yeah)
Your Daddy's Lambo?
Lambo, oh, oh
Can I drive your Daddy's Lambo?

Just whip it around you know
Up the hills
I ain't gon' wreck it, I promise
Sit your drunk ass back
Drama Beats, Yelawolf, Ghetto Vision
What up Rob Dyrdek? Fantasy Factory, bitch
Holla at G
