		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is a war against all
Let the world dissolve away
Rotting flesh aftermath
There is no escape
No matter what you say
What you say

This is our fate
No one can escape
Dead hearts don’t fear death
Take your fears and lay them to rest
This is a war against all
Only the strong survive
We’ll Watch the weak fall
Where were going, we’re going alone
If we make it back, no-one really knows
Look into the still waters of death
It’s your face it reflects
This is how the knife gets twisted
Scream into the void, but no one ever listens
This is how the knife gets twisted
Disease of humanity, survival of the hated
Look into my heart
You’d know that I was gone
Make space in hell
Cause you know I won’t be long
Need another body to feed to the machine
Blood and guts
It’s all it really needs
This is hell
And its all in your mind
External man
Born to die
This is a war against all
Only the strong survive
We’ll watch the weak fall
Where were going, we’re going alone
If we make it back, no-one really knows
Look into the still waters of death
It’s your face it reflects
This is how the knife gets twisted
Disease of humanity, survival of the hated
Let the world dissolve away
Rotting flesh aftermath
There is no escape
