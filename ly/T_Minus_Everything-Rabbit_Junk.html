		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  On the next level next level

T Minus Everything
You bring what you can bring
You stay light on your feet
You spend your life running
Pulling me like gravity
The beast is fully hungry
I try to crawl away i will not be prey today

In Armageddon without a weapon
Pushing forward but don't know my mission
So it's on to the next level
No turning back next level

In Armageddon without a weapon
Pushing forward but don't know my mission
With the touch of a fiery demon
To deliver the final lesson
One step ahead of the devil
I see, I see the next level yeah!

T minus everything you win what you can win
And what you leave behind
Make sure they never find
Kill it like a hemorrhagic virus
They're trying to divide us
The enemy is spineless and self-righteous

T minus everything no time to even begin
With the touch of a fiery demon
To deliver the final lesson
One step ahead of the devil
I see, I see the next level
So it's on to the next level yeah!

In Armageddon without a weapon
Pushing forward but don't know my mission
With the touch of a fiery demon
To deliver the final lesson
One step ahead of the devil
I see, I see the next level
With the touch of a fiery demon
To deliver the final lesson
One step ahead of the devil
I see, I see the next level yeah!
T minus everything on the next level
T minus everything on the next level
