		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I lie awake and dread the lonely nights
I'm not alone
I wonder if these heavy eyes, can face the unknown
When I close my eyes I realize
You'll come my way
I'm standing in the night alone
Forever together, oh

We're the dream warriors
Don't wanna dream no more
We're the dream warriors
And maybe tonight
Maybe tonight you'll be gone

I feel the touch comin' over me
I can't explain
I hear the voices callin' out
Callin' my name
It's the same desire to feel the fire
That's comin' your way
I'm standing in the night alone
Forever together, oh

We're the dream warriors
Don't wanna dream no more
We're the dream warriors
Maybe tonight you'll be gone
We're the dream warriors (dream warriors)
Ain't gonna dream no more
And maybe tonight
Maybe tonight you'll be gone

Sweet revenge, the bitter end
This time
Break the spell of illusion
Bound together waiting for you

Dream warriors
Don't want to dream no more
We're the dream warriors
Maybe tonight you'll be gone
We're the dream warriors (dream warriors)
Ain't gonna dream no more
We're the dream warriors (dream warriors)
And maybe tonight
Maybe tonight you'll be gone
(Dream warriors)
Maybe tonight you'll be gone
(Dream warriors) 
Forever
(Dream warriors)
Maybe tonight you'll be gone
Dream warriors
Dream warriors
