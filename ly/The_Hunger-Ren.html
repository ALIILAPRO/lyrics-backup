		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Poison in my veins lights a flame in my brain
That maintains the pain that may change my frame of mind
Blind, I design rhymes, intertwined, double time
Genuine Frankenstein
I made a monster
Conquer, music scene, golden ticket, Wonka
Conjour, lyrics in my belly, I got thunder
Younger, everybody wishes they were younger
The older I'm getting, the more I feel the hunger (Get 'em)
Belter like a welterweight helter-skelter need Alka-Seltzer (Get 'em)
Alpha, Beta, Delta, I help you into the fall out shelter (Get 'em)
Melt a mind or two with these rhymes,
You might find you never felt (Get 'em)
A feeling like this feeling, be believing I'm a demon, I'm a devil
Fuck the game, completed every level, I'm a vessel
For spirits to channel out of my lyrics, I'm a rebel
I raise my fist, the anti-capitalistic pissed I revel
In society collapsing Fantastic, now pump the treble
Tick-tock off the top of the tip of my tongue, I am tapping telepathy
Terrify them with the terrible telekinesis tantrum
Yes, I torture the enemy
Slowing the flow and then growing the flow,
And I swallow the flow like a Toblerone (Get 'em)
I'mma feast on the flow, I'm a beast with the flow
Then I'm switching it up and I'm taking it low
Kiddie with a black heart in a car park by Primark
Jamming Django Reinhardt
Living like a rockstar, refine rap to a fine art, Vincent Van Gogh
I start
Making my mark like Frankie Sinatra
King, call me Arthur
And my style is homegrown like growing cali weed
Don't need no personal trainer, I got trainers on my feet (Ay!)
You know I got the soul in my bowl when I eat
You know I'm staying grounded when I grind up my beef
But if you got a problem, my brother,
I might just put on some rubber gloves
And just choke you 'till larynx ruptures,
And blood, it just bubbles up
And the bubbles just double up, and you struggle, but luck is up
'Cause I'm subtle at covering up the trouble
Cover up the crime scene, 1990, that's my scene!
My teen years were spent rolling the Thai-green
Obscene fiend in a pair of baggy jeans
Putting backy with the green, roll a fatty dopamine
Starts flowing, my cerebellum glowing
The pendulum is slowing
I'm swinging and I'm swaying but I don't know where I'm going
Mind running Jessie Owens, Hallelujah, Leonard Cohen
All these seeds that I've been sewing slowly growing like trees
I grow, then I preach
Scrap that, I teach
Teach over beats
To all those that seek
Teach on these streets
Streets can be bleak
But bleak was the place where I rose to my feet
