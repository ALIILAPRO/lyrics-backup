		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Anxiety beating my ass again
Why oh why i don't know why I try
Youre not there i should die
Hold me close hold me tight

I been feeling so down down
I been feeling so down

Thinking I need a hug maybe I need a drug
Maybe I need your love do you believe in us?

Enough to let go if you had to if you had
II've been feeling so down down
II've been feeling so down
Now you’re so far away I
Can't even see your face
All the pain that I could take
This shit feels like I'm bouta break
And all the things I do for us
I'd give it just to find your love
There ain't nobody I can trust

II've been feeling so down down
II've been feeling so down
