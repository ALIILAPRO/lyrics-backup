		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And I been chillin', watchin' the ocean with you
Baby, yup, we're the slow-motion crew
And we up in the cloud lands when
People change, but not us
And we just chillin', kickin' it, kissed by the sun
Could be soaked to the skin in a monsoon
I know she got the good vibes when
Seasons change but we're the same

Even if I lost all my money
This river runs deep, honey
And I don't need to speak a single word
'Cause you got me howlin', howlin'
Even if my jokes aren't funny
My tongue tied up, honey
And I don't need to speak a single word
'Cause you got me howlin', howlin'

'Cause you got me howlin', howlin'
'Cause you got me howlin'

And I be runnin', possessed by ya low, low voodoo
Fired up like a wolf on a full moon
And we stuck in the La La Land
The tides will turn without us
And I'll be killin' time like I might be a cartoon
Take it in, we a life-like haiku
I know we got the good vibes when
Pieces fall right into place

Even if I lost all my money
This river runs deep, honey
And I don't need to speak a single word
'Cause you got me howlin', howlin'
Even if my jokes aren't funny
My tongue tied up, honey
And I don't need to speak a single word
'Cause you got me howlin', howlin'

'Cause you got me howlin', howlin'
'Cause you got me howlin'

Mm, ayy, ah
Play me like a bass guitar
Simmer down and mess me up
Trippin' like I'm Jimi at Woodstock
Mm, ayy, ah
Drive me round in your red Ford
Shivers down my spinal cord
Oh, oh, oh, oh
'Cause you got me howlin', howlin'

Even if I lost all my money
This river runs deep, honey
And I don't need to speak a single word
'Cause you got me howlin', howlin'
Even if my jokes aren't funny
My tongue tied up, honey
And I don't need to speak a single word
'Cause you got me howlin', howlin'

Hold up
