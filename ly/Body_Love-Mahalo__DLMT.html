		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I just want to get to know your body love
Rock with my body love
Talk with your body

I just want to get to know your body love
Let's get rid of boundaries
Cause I know the way to touch you
When you speak that language
I can't get enough
I can understand it
Take my hand and let me show you

Rock with my body love
Talk with your body love
Rock with my body love
Talk with your body

Rock with my body love
Talk with your body what
Rock with my body love
Talk with your body
