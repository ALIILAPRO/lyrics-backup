		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ladies and Gentlemen 
Ev'ry duke and earl and peer is here 
Ev'ryone who should be here is here. 
What a smashing, positively dashing 
Spectacle: the Ascot op'ning day. 
At the gate are all the horses 
Waiting for the cue to fly away. 
What a gripping, absolutely ripping 
Moment at the Ascot op'ning day. 
Pulses rushing! Faces flushing! 
Heartbeats speed up! I have never been so keyed up! 
And second now They'll begin to run. Hark! 
A bell is ringing, They are springing Forward Look!
It has begun...! What a frenzied moment that was! 
Didn't they maintain an exhausting pace? 
'Twas a thrilling, absolutely chilling Running of the 
Ascot op'ning race.
