		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

The walls are falling again
I hear you calling my name
I want you
You're the match and the flame
Oxygen to the brain
Yeah, I want you

You already know
The way you turn it on
You're so electrical
Come on

I come alive
You start me up a million times
And I'm terrified
That you could leave me crying

Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Look, I need you around
Got my head in the clouds
Come over
It's a quarter past two
I'm staying up for you
Just to hold ya

You already know
The way you turn it on 
You're so electrical
Come on

I come alive
You start me up a million times
And I'm terrified
That you could leave me cryin'

Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
