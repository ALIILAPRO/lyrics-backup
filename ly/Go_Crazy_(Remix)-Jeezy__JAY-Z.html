		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Guess who's bizzack
Still smell the blow on my clothes
Like crispy cream I was cooking them o's
Like horseshoes I was tossin' them o's
Time to re-up gotta recycle the flow
I'm emotional
I hug the block
I'm so emotional
I love my glock
Cash rules everything around me
So what's realer
'Bout the scriller, call me a ghost face killa
It's kinda hard to be drug free
When Georgia Power won't give a nigga lights free
Switched hustles been killin' 'em ever since
Been paid to tell the truth, dog, it only make sense

When they play that new Jeezy all the dope boys go crazy
And watch the dope boys go crazy
I pop my collar then I swing my chain
You can catch me in the club pimpin' doing my thang
When they play that new Jeezy all the dope boys go crazy
And watch the dope boys go crazy
Pop your collar then you swing your chain
All the gangstas in the street that be doin' they thang, ay

Buy 18 the hard way
Now have a humble nigga thinkin' 'bout gun play
Now who the fuck want to play with guns
A lot'a holes a lot'a blood dog
That shit ain't fun
So I suggest that you don't play with my chain
Or I'll send these hollow's at you
Let them play with ya brain
The streets is watchin'
The name is warm
The product's white
A star is born
Pimpin' I'm so fly
I take this parachute off
I might fall and die
Wrap the work like spandex with the latex
Then we ship it outta town
Call it safe sex

When they play that new Jeezy all the dope boys go crazy
And watch the dope boys go crazy
I pop my collar then I swing my chain
You can catch me in the club pimpin' doing my thang
When they play that new Jeezy all the dope boys go crazy
And watch the dope boys go crazy
Pop your collar then you swing your chain
All the gangstas in the street that be doin' they thang, ay

Uh, more than a hustla I'm the definition of it
Master chef, lord of the kitchen cupboard
More than a street legend, homey it's Hova
More than a relief pitcher, I'm the closer
The Mariano of the Marriott, ah
If money talks, the whole world's 'bout to hear me out
See I'm a hustler's hope, I'm not his pipe dreams
So when they speak of success, I'm what they might mean
Attract money my worst color is light green
My favorite hue is Jay-Z blue
Don't follow me young'n, follow my moves, I'm not a role model
A bad influence got the world drinkin gold bottles
When puff was in that tub spillin mo'
I was at my video, cris' on the speedboat
In my lifetime nigga, go through your research
St. Thomas my nigga, that was me first
Chrome shoe'd the GS, I came feet first
In the game like a baby boo on the breach birth
I got the keys if you need work
I can kingpin you a line, the diamond of time (uh)
My niggaz love it when I talk like this
My corporate people start buggin' cause I talk like this
The corporate thugs is like, "Nah Hov, talk that shit"
The dope boys go crazy when they hear that boy Jay-Z
See I'ma '80s baby, master Reganomics
School of hard knocks, everyday is college
You ain't did nothin I ain't did, nigga pay homage
Or pay the doctor, I sprayed lami's
Still, the time'll reveal, you know I'm bein honest
Ya ain't put my coat yet and I keep my shit in coat check
They say the truth shall come to the light
So everybody grab your shades 'cause your boy that bright

When they play that new Jeezy all the dope boys go crazy
And watch the dope boys go crazy
I pop my collar then I swing my chain
You can catch me in the club pimpin' doing my thang
When they play that new Jeezy all the dope boys go crazy
And watch the dope boys go crazy
Pop your collar then you swing your chain
All the gangstas in the street that be doin' they thang, ay
