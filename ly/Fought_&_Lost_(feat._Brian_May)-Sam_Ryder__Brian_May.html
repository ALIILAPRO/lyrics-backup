		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Congratulations on your jubilation
Our hearts are breaking underneath all the applause
This devastation is of our own making
But we've never tasted this much bitterness before

And everybody falls
But some of us are born to fight, and fight, and fight some more

So, we will see you here
Same time, same place, next year
And you may win this battle but you'll never win the war
Better to have fought and lost than never fought at all

Go take a bow
Your audience is waiting
We'll take the shadows since the limelight isn't ours
We wanted it so bad
Gave it all we had
Oh, but wanting it doesn't always make it yours

This time was ours to lose
But fortune favors those who ride the storm and make it through

So, we will see you here
Same time, same place, next year
And you can take this battle 'cause we're gonna win the war
Better to have fought and lost than never fought at all

So, here on the same ground
When the tables have turned around
Oh, and your tears fall as your world is crashing down
I hope when you see me
You remember that feeling
Oh, 'cause we've both seen the world from both sides now

And everybody falls
And life will tear you down to show you what's worth fighting for

Oh, we will see you here
Same time, same place, next year
And you may win this battle but you'll never win the war
Better to have fought and lost than never fought at all

Better to have fought and lost than never fought at all
