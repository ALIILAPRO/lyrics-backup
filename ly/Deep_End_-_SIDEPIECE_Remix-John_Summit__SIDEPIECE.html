		  I've been tryin' not to go off the deep end
I don't think you wanna give me a reason
I've been tryin' not to go off the deep end
I don't think you wanna give me a reason
I've been tryin' not to go off the deep end
I don't think you wanna give me a reason
I've been tryin' not to go off the deep end
I don't think you wanna give me, me

I've been tryin' not to

I've been tryin'
I've been tryin'
I've been tryin' not to
I've been tryin' not to
I've been tryin'
I've been
I've been
I've been
I've been
I've been

I've been tryin' not to

I've been tryin'
I've been tryin'
I've been tryin' not to go off the deep end
I don't think you wanna give me a reason
I've been tryin' not to go off the deep end
I don't think you wanna give me a reason
I've been tryin' not to go off the deep end

I've been tryin' not to go off the deep end
I don't think you wanna give me a reason
I've been tryin' not to go off the deep end
I don't think you wanna give me a reason
I've been tryin' not to

I've been tryin'
I've been tryin'
I've been tryin' not to
I've been tryin' not to
I've been tryin' not to
I've been
I've been
I've been
I've been
I've been

I've been tryin' not to

I've been tryin'
I've been tryin' 
I've been tryin' not to go off the deep end
I don't think you wanna give me a reason
I've been tryin' not to go off the deep end
I don't think you wanna give me a reason
I've been tryin' not to go off the deep end
