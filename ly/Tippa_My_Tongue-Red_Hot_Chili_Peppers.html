		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ya, ya-ya-ya, ya-ya-ya, ya-ya-ya, ya
Well, I'm an animal
Somethin' like a cannibal
I'm very flammable
And partially programmable
Centuries of overuse
Now I wear it nice and loose

Ya, ya-ya-ya, ya-ya-ya, ya-ya-ya, ya
Well, it's ubiquitous
Tell me, can you stick to this?
I'm on the brink of this
And tell me what you think of this
I'm in the Beauregard's
Slow me down if I get hard

We've only just begun
Funky monks are on the run
Gonna, gonna, gonna get you with the tip of my tongue
And when you walk away
I know what the kids would say
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah
Gonna get you now

Her perfume smells like gasoline
My girlfriend's trash is nice and clean
Acid landing on my tongue
I think you know we've just begun
She don't want the ladies room
Transatlantic super groom

Your hairplane is a monument
The sexy art of continence
And now I know you by your scent
Let it be, we both get bent
Need a minute to repair
Sunny-siders always share

We've only just begun
Funky monks are on the run
Gonna, gonna, gonna get you with the tip of my tongue
And when you walk away
I know what your kiss would say
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah
I'm gonna get you with the tip of my gun

Ya, ya-ya-ya, ya-ya-ya, ya-ya-ya, ya
Well, I believe in love
Perfectly receivin' love
It's vociferous
Then come and get a whiff of this
I'm at the pyramids
Never had a fear of kids

Ya, ya-ya-ya, ya-ya-ya, ya-ya-ya, ya
I'm on the precipice
I come and make a mess of this
It's the apocalypse
I try to get a sock of this
I'm at the county fair
Haystack ride, I'll pull your hair

We've only just begun
Funky monks are on the run
Gonna, gonna, gonna get you with the tip of my tongue
And when you walk away
I know what your kiss would say
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah
Gonna, gonna, gonna get you with the tip of my gun
We've only just begun
Funky monks are on the run
Gonna, gonna, gonna get you with the tip of my tongue
And when you walk away
I know what your kiss would say
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah
Gonna get you now
