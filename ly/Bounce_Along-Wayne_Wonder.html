		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby... Oh...
Beautiful girl I mess wit you 
Wish you would love me I progress one 
She gave me what I've been looking for

Says she wants a man like me in her life
Not from the minta minta goals alright
She talk about her lady's every night...
I don't want to talk about 

What I had before
So what I want to do right now
Is give you love galore
Baby...

[Chorus]
Bounce along, bounce along
Only you can turn me on
Bounce along, bounce along 
Bounce along, bounce along
Only you can turn me on 
Bounce along, bounce along

Maybe all I believe is what seen in you
Love every single thing you do
Clearly I can see you want me too
Lately I've been talking to my self

Saying I don't need nobody else
'Cause all I'm searching for I found in you
I don't want to sleep alone
Without you in my bed

'Cause when you're not around my love
You're messing up me head
Baby...

[Chorus]

Beautiful girl I mess with you 
Wish you would love me I progress one 
She gave me what I've been looking for
Says she wants a man like me in her life

Not from the minta minta goals alright
She talk about her lady's every night...
I don't want to talk about 
What I had before

So what I want to do right now
Is give you love galore
Baby...

[Chorus]

[Repeat: x4]
Bounce, Bounce,
Bounce Along

I don't want to sleep alone
Without you in my bed
'Cause when you're not around my love
You're messing up me head
Baby...

[Chorus]

Maybe all I believe is what seen in you

'Cause all I'm searching for I found in you
I don't want to sleep alone
Without you in my bed

'Cause when you're not around my love
You're messing up me head
Baby...

[Chorus: x2]
