		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You drive fast, you're heading west
Every sharp turn is a blow to my chest
We lie stagnant in your bed
Saying things we've never said
Drunken runaways to your left
All these sirens in your head
You just don't know where to run
Follow streetlights to the sun
Smashing chairs against the wall
Chasing stairways just to fall
Breaking down the bathroom door
"I won't hurt you anymore"

Spread out records on the floor
I'm falling on my knees
I said I couldn't find them
And I'm sorry but I gave them all away
I just don't know what to say
Losing feeling every day
I'm a hypocrite, I know
Doing better on my own

When everything's turning
Who do you love?
Who do you love?

Now everything's changing
But it's always you
It's always you

When everything's turning
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
