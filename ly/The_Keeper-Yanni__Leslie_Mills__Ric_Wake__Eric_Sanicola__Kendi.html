		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been like a bird without song for awhile
Dry like a lake without rain for awhile
You suddenly stepped in my life
and made me cry, like an angel
Ooh, you're something else, like a smile without end

Come into my life
Go a little deeper
Come into my life
You could be the keeper

You're pulling me closer and you're flowin' in
With every emotion that rushes me on
To your love, light me up
Oh, you could be the keeper

I've been like a home without people for awhile
Empty like a poem without words for awhile
You suddenly stepped in my life
And made me shine, like a diamond
Ooh, you're somethin' else, like a dream without end

Come into my life
Go a little deeper
Come into my life
You could be the keeper
(All I have)
You're pulling me closer and you're flowin' in
(All I have)
With every emotion rushes me on
To your love, light me up
Oh, you could be the keeper

Aah

Ooh, you're something else, like a dream without end
Come into my life
Go a little deeper
Come into my life
You could be the keeper
(All I have)
You're pulling me closer and you're flowin' in
(All I have)
With every emotion rushes me on
To your love, light me up
Oh, you could be the keeper

All I have
All I have
Turn me on to your love, light me up
Oh, you could be the keeper
Turn me on to your love, light me up
Oh, you could be the keeper
