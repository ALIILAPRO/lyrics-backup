		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've woken up to my thoughts comin' 'round
And I've givin' in to this game that ain't real
I figured out, where do you go if you can't play games?
Play me, play God, the love was overrated
You know what you were doin'
And you know what you was sayin'
Why'd you point the blame
When it's you you should be blamin'?
I wish you found the man that you thought I'd want to be with
I wish you found the man that you thought I should've been with

I met a man who told me that he'd hold me when he can
Told me I'm broken, but I'll take you
And I was in the wrong
I met a man, did everything he could to put me down
Just to build me right back, I was never broken
'Cause broken is the man

Can you believe I put myself through that all?
Just to realize you mean nothing to me
I let you in, I let you play around with my flaws
My mind, my traits in every conversation
I'm such an open book, I have no filter, I just say shit
Next time that little voice in my head begins to question
Listen to it 'cause you're never, ever gonna save them
And you know that it wasn't love

I met a man who told me that he'd hold me when he can
Told me I'm broken, but I'll take you
And I was in the wrong
I met a man, did everything he could to put me down
Just to build me right back, I was never broken
'Cause broken is the man
