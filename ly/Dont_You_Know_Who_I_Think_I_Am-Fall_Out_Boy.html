		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Whoa, oh, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
A penny for your thoughts, but a dollar for your insides
Or a fortune for your disaster
And I'm just a painter and I'm drawing a blank

We only want to sing you to sleep
In your bedroom speakers, whoa
We need umbrellas on the inside
Get me just right

They say quitters never win
But we walk the plank on a sinking ship
There's a world outside of my front door
That gets off on being down

Oh, oh, oh, oh

I could learn to pity fools as I'm the worst of all
And I can't stop feeling sorry for myself
Whoa oh oh oh

We only want to sing you to sleep
Your bedroom speakers, whoa
We need umbrellas on the inside
Get us right

They say quitters never win
But we walk the plank on a sinking ship
There's a world outside of my front door
That gets off on being down

They say quitters never win
But we walk the plank on a sinking ship
There's a world outside of my front door
That gets off on being down

We only want to sing you to sleep
(In your bedroom speakers, whoa)
We only want to sing you to sleep

They say quitters never win
But we walk the plank on a sinking ship
There's a world outside of my front door
That gets off on being down
They say quitters never win
But we walk the plank, and we walk the plank
There's a world outside of my front door
That gets off on being down

(We're broken down on memory lane
We're alone together; we're alone (whoa)
Broken down on memory lane
We're alone together; we're alone)
