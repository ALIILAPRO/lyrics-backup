		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So scared that you don't want me here
In the corner of the living room
Reading subtitles, 'cause I can't hear
The show you put on for noise
While you're laughing in the kitchen
Pouring drinks over ice
And I am not the type to go out every night
'Cause I just need some time
To know what's wrong in my head

Pulling out the pages that I wrote for you
Hoping you don't think that I'm dependent
'Cause I know the truth
Might be too much, I'm not enough
I'm always disappointed in the things I write
Even when I speak 
It seems the words'll never come out right
Coping alone, just bring me home

And it's happened again
Another friend said, "Marry me"
While unknowingly signing away the life he wanted
I'm glad, but none of our parents stayed together
I hate to be a bummer but I'm three more beers
From calling a cab
So I can sleep to shake this dread
I won't wake up unless you ask if I am okay

Pulling out the pages that I wrote for you
Hoping you don't think that I'm dependent
'Cause I know the truth
Might be too much, I'm not enough
I'm always disappointed in the things I write
Even when I speak it seems
The words'll never come out right
Coping alone, just bring me home
Just bring

Just bring me home
Just bring me home
I don't want to talk on the balcony
Just want to drink 'til I kill what's gotten into me
Just bring me home
Just bring me home
Just bring, just bring, just bring me home

And I just need some time to know what's wrong in my head
