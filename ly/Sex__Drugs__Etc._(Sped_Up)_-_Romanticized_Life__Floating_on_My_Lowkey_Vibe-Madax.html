		  Late night telephone
Calling all the wallflowers I know
Out the dark and into the light
Half love, half regret
Dressing up for polaroids and cigarettes
Socialize, romanticize the life
Floating on my lowkey vibe
Floating on my lowkey vibe, vibe, vibe
I don't need that late night high
I'm floating on my vibe
Vibe, vibe, vibe, vibe, vibe
Bulletproof passengers
On the road to sex, drugs, etc.
Get out the dark and into the light
Everywhere I go I know that I don't want to be
Part of something I won't ever need
Your socialized, romanticized life
Floating on my lowkey vibe
Floating on my lowkey vibe, vibe, vibe
I don't need that late night high
I'm floating on my vibe
Vibe, vibe, vibe, vibe, vibe
Out of touch in harmony
Designer drugs from dead end streets
Break the air to feel the fall
Or just feel anything at all
Floating on my lowkey vibe
Floating on my lowkey vibe, vibe, vibe
I don't need that late night high
I'm floating on my vibe
Vibe, vibe, vibe, vibe, vibe
Floating on my lowkey vibe
Floating on my lowkey vibe, vibe, vibe
I don't need that late night high
I'm floating on my
