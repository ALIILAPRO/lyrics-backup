		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Egan)

Nothing is lost and nothing's gained,
It's the same old situation again,
No, I can't give or take anymore.

Gets so lonely there's really nothing left to say,
Gets so lonely and everything's so far away.

No one is right and no one's wrong,
How can I say right now which side I'm on?
No, I can't give or take anymore.

Gets so lonely there's really nothing left to say,
Gets so lonely and everything's so far away.
