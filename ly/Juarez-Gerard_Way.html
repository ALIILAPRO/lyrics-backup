		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't swim, don't rub it in
I'm gonna run a little faster
I can't swim, so plug it in
Me and my heavy metal master

Down and around when the cops come down and
Down and around when the cops come down on you
Jump around to the cop-show sound
Sing death to the crown, man

I can't swim, don't rub it in
I'm gonna run a little faster
I'm breaking
I'm running scared
I'm selling glitter for the plaster
Down and around when the cops come down and
Down and around when the cops come down on you
Jump around to the cop-show sound
Sing death to the crown, man

We got it
You got it, you got it, you got it, you got it, we got it now
I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it now

I can't swim, so plug it in
I'm gonna run a little faster
I can't swim, so plug it in
Me and my heavy, my heavy girl
Down and around when the cops come down and
Down and around when the cops come down on you
Jump around to the cop-show sound
Get straight 'cause I'm down, man

I can't swim
