		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The phone rings
Another peaceful moment is lost
Latifah's chest jingle in "Set It Off"
I press pause in the bed as a king
I let it ring 4 or 5 times
Answer while I'm puffin' my green
It's Tamika sayin', "Hi Nas"
I caught a flashback of her askin' me was I asthmatic 'fore I tapped that
She offered me dinner under the moon
I said, "Sorry I made plans at Ray's Boom-Boom Room"
Nine push-ups, Strength's gone at the tenth one so why hook up
The pimp's gone off the Platron Tequila
Put on my Lee's and the original Fila's
Sedated from L's, 380 cocked, naked ladies laid up in tails
Like Whodini I chose, gazelles don't lean on my nose
Drivin' by the clubs gleamin' and go
Heads turn it's a freak show
I need them to know When will they learn
Nas need a queen not a hoe to
Point out my enemies, a girl who's into me
But not a hype chick someone with proper energy
Someone who's into me but won't fuck with my enemies
And you can sing along 'cause I'm feelin' ya energy

Hey Nas, how ya doin'?
Take my name, and my number
Meanwhile, we'll be groovin'
But let's take, it, slow

One for the honeys who roll blunts up but don't smoke
Two for the few who see potential in you when you broke
Three for the G they got, they game is hot I give it to you
Double life wife play with the man that's livin' with you
Here's the issue, A woman gotta be stunnin'
Get to a man's heart through his stomach
You gotta be skilled in the culinary arts
Know a brother stay mad hungry when he spark
Hit the museum, maybe Central Park, you mentally smart
Picture we in Tiffany, you becomin' my counterpart
If I want Chinese then you buy me a wok
If you want barbecue I call Professor and Ock
Cause you point out my enemies, someone who's into me
But not a hyper chick someone with the proper energy
A girl that's into me who won't fuck all my enemies
And you could be the one 'cause I'm lovin' ya energy

Hey Nas, how ya doin'?
Take my name, and my number
Meanwhile, we'll be cruisin'
But let's take, it, slow

Slow is the way
Holdin' hands, tongue and hickeys
Hope and I pray where I run at you run away with me
That's if my gun get busy we gotta get outta there
Hear sirens jump in the stick drop a Sedan and hide for years
Like no one else in the world did this except for us two
You gotta trust me, I gotta trust you
If coppers bust me it's me you rescue, this to the death boo
You rep me respectfully that's how I rep for you
Retired from pimpin', perspire is drenchin'
As we, suck and fuck each other's minds out commission
Time's out forbidden
Until we pass out, that's when we stop
We give it all we got, give it all we got, we hot
Give it all we got, give it all we got we rock
Give it all we got, give it all we got
You 'bout the baddest thing
Since Michael had Billy Jean
And Prince gave you diamond's and pearls
But to be my queen you must
Point out my enemies, a girl who's into me
But not a hype chick someone with proper energy
Someone who's into me who won't fuck all my enemies
And you can be the one 'cause I'm feelin' ya energy

Hey Nas, how ya doin'?
Take my name, and my number
Meanwhile, we'll be groovin'
But let's take, it, slow

I can be, what you said
That you need, I can be, all that
I can be, I can have your back, baby
I can be, what you said
That you need, I can be, all that
I can be, I can have your back, baby
