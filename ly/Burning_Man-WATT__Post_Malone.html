		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ohh, ha!
Ohh

Baby, got the beat that won't stop, the feeling gets stronger
Baby, got the hand that keeps feeding me, no more hunger
Get high, get lost in paradise
This feeling's all we got tonight
Baby, I'm a burning man, baby
Burning man, baby

Ay, I felt something I never had before
I'm paranoid, I keep peeking out the peephole
On the mother ship, sippin' on some Pinot
In the mirror, I seen a list of people
I sped off and landed in Nevada
What happened next just don't really matter
Can't take everything, seems so scattered (ha!)
Takes hold of my breath, oh, like asthma
Hey, and I'm all out of Tequila (ay)
And me and lil' mama drop more Acid than a Beatle (ay)
I'm trippin' too hard I had to ditch her on the d-low
Hop in the El Dorado, I'ma see you se√±orita

Baby, got the beat that won't stop, the feeling gets stronger
Baby, got the hand that keeps feeding me, no more hunger
Get high, get lost in paradise
This feeling's all we got tonight
Baby, I'm a burning man, baby
Burning man, baby

I didn't want it, but fuck it, I guess I'm really in it
Blood is rushing, my heart is going a mile a minute
My Mr. Mojo is rising, Forever 27
I say hello to heaven, yeah yeah
Five days in and I lost my soul (yeah)
All these women and all these drugs (yeah)
Find myself when I lost control 
Who knew a bad trip could be beautiful?

Baby, got the beat that won't stop, the feeling gets stronger
Baby, got the hand that keeps feeding me, no more hunger
Get high, get lost in paradise
This feeling's all we got tonight
Baby, I'm a burning man, baby
Burning man, baby

Yeah, yeah
Baby, got the beat that won't stop, the feeling gets stronger
Baby, got the hand that keeps feeding me, no more hunger
Get high, get lost in paradise
This feeling's all we got tonight
Baby, I'm a burning man, baby
Burning man, baby
