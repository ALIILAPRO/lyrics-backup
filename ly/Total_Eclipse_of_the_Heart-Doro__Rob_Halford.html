		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Turn around
Every now and then I get a little bit lonely
And you never coming ′round
Turn around
Every now and then I get a little bit tired
Of listening to the sound of my tears

Turn around
Every now and then I get a little bit nervous
That the best of all the years have gone by
Turn around
Every now and then I get a little bit terrified
And then I see the look in your eyes

Turn around, bright eyes
Every now and then I fall apart
Turn around, bright eyes
Every now and then I fall apart


Turn around
Every now and then I get a little bit restless
And I dream of something wild
Turn around
Every now and then I get a little bit helpless
And I'm lying like a child in your arms

Turn around
Every now and then I get a little bit angry
And I know I′ve got to get out and cry
Turn around
Every now and then I get a little bit terrified
But then I see the look in your eyes

Turn around, bright eyes
Every now and then I fall apart
Turn around, bright eyes
Every now and then I fall apart

And I need you now tonight
And I need you more than ever
And if you only hold me tight
We'll be holding on forever
And we'll only be making it right
′Cause we′ll never be wrong
Together we can take it to the end of the line
Our love is like a shadow on me all of the time


I don't know what to do and I′m always in the dark
We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks
I really need you tonight
Forever′s gonna start tonight
Forever's gonna start tonight

Once upon a time, I was falling in love
Now I′m only falling apart
There's nothing I can do
A total eclipse of the heart

A total eclipse of the heart

And I need you now tonight
And I need you more than ever
And if you only hold me tight
We'll be holding on forever
And we′ll only be making it right
′Cause we'll never be wrong
Together we can take it to the end of the line
Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time (all of the time)

I don′t know what to do, I'm always in the dark
We′re living in a powder keg and giving off sparks
I really need you tonight
Forever's gonna start tonight
(Forever′s gonna start tonight)

Once upon a time, I was falling in love
But now I'm only falling apart
Nothing I can do
A total eclipse of the heart

A total eclipse of the heart
A total eclipse of the heart

A total eclipse of the heart
