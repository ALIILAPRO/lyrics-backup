		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  (Yo, ADP on beats, boy)

Anything can happen when you out here poppin' every night
Gotta risk it all tryna live a legendary life
Gotta keep the boomy on you, even when it's close friends
Tryin' not to mix the money up with emotions
Anything can happen when you out here poppin' every night
Gotta risk it all tryna live a legendary life
Gotta keep the boomy on you, even when it's close friends
Tryin' not to mix the money up with emotions

Bentley, just touched the second gear
Followed up, I say a prayer
Neve know, can't be too prepared
Champagne flutes to catch my tears
Hope this year gon' be my year
Mama told me that I was rare
Chrome Hearts shades to hide my glare
Both eyes closed, don't fuckin' care
Nigga, yeah-yeah-yeah
Dreams of a Porsche kept me up at night
Facts, nigga, I'm not tryna act polite, though
True story, they don't see the sacrifice
They might take a nigga back tonight

Anything can happen when you out here poppin' every night
Gotta risk it all tryna live a legendary life
Gotta keep the boomy on you, even when it's close friends
Tryin' not to mix the money up with emotions
Anything can happen when you out here poppin' every night
Gotta risk it all tryna live a legendary life
Gotta keep the boomy on you, even when it's close friends
Tryin' not to mix the money up with emotions

Yeah, load up the jet, I'm ready (load it)
I'm tryna live this shit legendary (livin' it)
I got these niggas upset already
All these diamonds that's on me, they necessary
I got King in my blood, it's hereditary (yeah)
She show me love like it's February (she did)
I fell asleep, I was in that pussy
When I woke up she givin' me head already, yeah (woo)
She wanna' spoil me (spoil me)
I just want loyalty (loyalty)
Yeah (yeah)
Choppa' in a Lamborghini, that shit feel like royalty (royalty)
Yeah (yeah)
Niggas know it when they see me, it ain't no extortin' me (whoa)
See me in traffic, it's action, no lackin', I'm movin' accordingly
I'm watchin' Kanye on the television, talkin' Trump
He's supportin' him (damn)
I got some niggas with tunnel vision, and a plug
They deported them (damn)
I know some niggas that's jealous of me for my hood
They wanna slaughter me (brrt)
I know they never can get to me
I done got rich, man, these niggas is history

Anything can happen when you out here poppin' every night
Gotta risk it all tryna live a legendary life
Gotta keep the boomy on you, even when it's close friends
Tryin' not to mix the money up with emotions
Anything can happen when you out here poppin' every night
Gotta risk it all tryna live a legendary life
Gotta keep the boomy on you, even when it's close friends
Tryin' not to mix the money up with emotions
