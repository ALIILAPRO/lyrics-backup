		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This shit is going overtime it's getting hard to breathe
Oh I'm scared for your honesty
Oh this feeling now never seems to leave me
Every time I'm losing it
I
Don't know where to start
On the contrary I
Can't get enough
Enough of you
I need
I need to know
You'll give better love baby no not like before yeah
I see
I see
Seeing that you're eyes are looking at the lips you loved yeah
I mean
I mean
Not to get it twisted do you fear what I fear?
Going round in circles know you'll be where I'll be
So I need to know
Sometimes I think were better off babe
But don't think that we should lose this my babe
Don't think that we should go our separate ways
Baby girl we keep on trying
And I think that there is beauty inside that
Every time we face to face
Demons in the way
Trying to cast them out yeah
But I guess they're here to stay
I
Don't know where to start
On the contrary I
Can't get enough
Enough of you
I need
I need to know
You'll give better love baby no not like before yeah
I see
I see
Seeing that you're eyes are looking at the lips you loved yeah
I mean
I mean
Not to get it twisted do you fear what I fear?
Going round in circles know you'll be where I'll be
So I need to know
