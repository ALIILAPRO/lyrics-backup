		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  'Cause I'm useless, when you're stuck in my mind
I've been foolish, think of you all the time
Play some music, like a harp in the sky
I'ma lose it if you're not by my side

I've been watchin' you and I've been tryna decide
If I could ever remind you of what you really like
And I know it's not possible, but I wish you would try
'Cause it keeps on playing back in my head a million times

'Cause I'm useless (oh), when you're stuck in my mind
I've been foolish (oh), think of you all the time
Play some music (oh), like a harp in the sky
I'ma lose it (oh), if you're not by my side (side, yeah)

I've been losin' sleep and I've been thinking 'bout why
You used to tell me that I'm all that you need in your life
And you said I was your soulmate, but that was just a lie (ooh)
It's alright, we're way too young to be givin' out advice

'Cause I'm useless (oh), when you're stuck in my mind
I've been foolish (oh), think of you all the time
Play some music (oh), like a harp in the sky
I'ma lose it (oh), if you're not by my side (side, yeah)

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
