		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  See my blessings, feel my essence
Look how I just stepped in
Please don't try my patience
Glory to god of mercies
Gone off the high, I'm surfing
Touching cloud-nine, I'm searching
Don't touch me I get nervous, get nervous

'Cause I got too much
'Cause my money gets too long
Looking at me you get goosebumps
Baby wanna roll with a rude one
Say she want money, get her boobs done
Come to the crib, take your shoes off
Now you wanna act brand new huh?
Sure you wanna act brand new huh? Move on

Call me when the money come, come, come, come, come
Call me when the money come, come, come, come, come
To the money I'ma run, run, run, run, run
To the money I'ma run, run, run, run, run

Call me when the money come, come, come, come, come
Call me when the money come, come, come, come, come
To the money I'ma run, run, run, run, run
To the money I'ma run, run, run, run, run

It wasn't the way I squint my eyes when I'm serious
Or when I catch you stare at me making my bed in the mirror
I needed a cleanse, anointing my mind, my spirit
The evil-er eye has warned me of your intentions

It's 'cause my money's just too long
Thought of me spending gives you goosebumps
Now lie to me, tell me I'm wrong
My heart I was making a home
Angel in light till she grew horns
Boo like 'Gatti, she was two-toned
My shawty amour
This the life that I want

Call me when the money come, come, come, come, come
Call me when the money come, come, come, come, come
To the money I'ma run, run, run, run, run
To the money I'ma run, run, run, run, run

Call me when the money come, come, come, come, come
Call me when the money come, come, come, come, come
To the money I'ma run, run, run, run, run
To the money I'ma run, run, run, run, run
