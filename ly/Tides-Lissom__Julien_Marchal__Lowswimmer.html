		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When you left me laying
On that ashen parkway
I won't come back to you soon
Back to your moon it was April, May, and
Everything was all sideways
Seeing in velvety hues desperately blue

Still, an exit made it's way to you slowly
Look how your jealously moves empathy brews
And in your heavy way incessantly outplayed
See your supremacy bloom
It tends to feed you it tends to leave you

Are we loved? Still trying
Lost in it, untying
So, which one? Your tide's in
Under it, I'm dying
Your sun's up high enough
I'm lit up, I'm lit up i'm waiting

In the lunar rays in the cavity, I wake
I won't come back to you soon
Back to your moon
