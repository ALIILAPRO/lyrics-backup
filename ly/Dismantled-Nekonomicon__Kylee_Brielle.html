		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Get up
Get out
Get down
Turn all the lights on
Put on a little bit of make-up for the show, son
Drag it
Pull it
You know where to hide it
They won't be asking if they
Don't know where to look, hun
It's Time to let it go
This is your greatest show
But in the frost
Everybody looks a little lost
Your howl can be heard from the shadows
They fear the music you can compose
And we all fall down
To the ground
Like everybody's watching us
Dancing all around
Like a body on a meat hook
To the rhythm of the nightmares
You cover up your skin
Don't know where to begin
Are you jealous of the shape of their hourglass?
You're not a big mistake
And it's not too late
Ignorance is bliss
Cause they just don't know what they're missing so
Get up
Get out
Get down
You show them who you are
Don't let the status quo stop your afterglow
Mistakes has happened before
One day they'll be begging for more
And we all fall down
To the ground
Like everybody's watching us
Dancing all around
Like a body on a meat hook
To the rhythm of the nightmares
We all fall down
To the ground
Like everybody's watching us
Dancing all around
Like a body on a meat hook
To the rhythm of the nightmares
Can't always hide in the shade
We all get stuck in our corners
That hook cant feel much better
Safety won't last forever
No
You are a fighter
Keep fighting
Keep dancing
Drag your enemies down
And we all fall down
To the ground
Like everybody's watching us
Dancing all around
Like a body on a meat hook
To the rhythm of the nightmares
We all fall down
To the ground
Like everybody's watching us
Dancing all around
Like a body on a meat hook
To the rhythm of the nightmares
