		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When he calls my number 
If I die before I wake 
Don't anybody wonder 
If I was washed in the blood and saved 
Do me one last favor 
When my day is done 
Put me on that slow train 
Back to where I'm from 

Lay me down 
Outside my hometown 
Lay me down 
Down on family Ground 

Please don't shed a tear babe 
When my sun has set 
Cause we made something good babe 
cnd I ain't got one regret 
I'll be going home sweet home 
Back on family ground 
Where the ones who came before me 
Finally settled down 

Lay me down 
Down on family Ground 

Lay me down 
Outside my hometown 
Lay me down 
Down on family Ground
