		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I stood there beside myself
Thinking hard about the weather
Then came by a friend of mine
Suggested we go out together
Then I knew it from the start
This friend of mine would fall apart
Pretending not to see his gun
I said let's go out and have some fun

I know you know
We believe in a land of love
I know you know
We believe in a land of love

I have always thought about
Staying here and going out
Tonight I should have stayed at home
Playing with my pleasure zone
He has always been so strange
I'd often thought he was deranged
Pretending not to see his gun
I said let's go out and have some fun

I know you know
We believe in a land of love
I know you know
We believe in a land of love
