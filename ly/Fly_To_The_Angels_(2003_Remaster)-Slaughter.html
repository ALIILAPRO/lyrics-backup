		<p>
		  Pictures of you
Oh, they're still on my mind 
You had this smile 
That could light up the world 
Now when it rains 
It seems the sun never shines 

And I drive
Down this lonely, lonely road
Ooh, I got this feelin'
Girl, I gotta let you go

'Cause now you've got to fly high (fly high)
Fly to the angels
Heaven awaits your heart 
And flowers bloom in your name 
Whoa oh
You've got to fly (fly high)
Fly to the angels 
All the stars in the night
Shine in your name

Though it hurts me way deep inside
When I turn and look and find 
That you're not there
I try to convince myself 
That the pain
The pain is still not gone 

Still I drive
Down this lonely, lonely road
Ooh I got this feelin'
Girl, I've got to let you go 

But now you've got to fly (fly high)
Fly to the angels 
Heaven awaits your heart 
And flowers bloom in your name 

Whoa 
You've got to fly (fly high) 
Fly to the angels 
All the stars in the night 
Shine in your name

Fly

And still I drive down 
This lonely, lonely road 
Ooh, I got this feelin'
Oh, I can't let you go 

But I know 
That you've got to fly (fly high) 
Fly to the angels
Heaven awaits your heart 
And flowers bloom in your name 
Whoa oh oh oh 
You've got fly (fly high) 
Fly to the angels 
All the stars in the sky 
Shine in your name, yeah 

I'm gonna miss you 
Miss you, girl
