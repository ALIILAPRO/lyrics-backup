		  (Mike WiLL Made-It)
Big booty hoes
And, I'm callin' out the big booty bitches
Pop yo' shit, bitch, pop yo' shit, bitch
Pop yo' shit, bitch
On the gang

Don't call me sis, I am not ya sister, I will fuck yo' man
I know how to throw that ass, and, a bitch can throw them hands
Yo' nigga a sucker buster (mhm), he ain't breakin' off no cash (nah)
My nigga be swipin' cards, he gon' teach me how to scam (hey)
He say I got a smart ass mouth and it's gon' get me fucked up (so?)
Gon' put this pussy in his mouth, and make him shut the fuck up (shh)
My opp posted her nigga, know I'm finna snatch him right up (periodt)
My booty jiggle when I walk, and it's tiger-striped up
Throw that ass all in this booth, if you ain't twerkin' then record it (yeah)
Lurkin' on my page, you gon' see nothin' but ass up on this story (ass)
Love to piss my nigga off, him talkin' shit be gettin' me horny (hmm)
Tryna find out who I'm fuckin', better off go findin' Dory
Got a lot of hoes, but, only one can say he fuckin' me (stamp that)
I just made one-fifty in a night, you hoes can't fuck with me (bitch)
I'm who bitches wanna be, and who them niggas love to see
You catch me in the party, know it's blickies in this club with me (fah, fah, fah)

Big booty hoes
And, I'm callin' out the big booty bitches
Pop yo' shit, bitch, pop yo' shit, bitch
Now pop it
Pop yo' shit, bitch, pop yo' shit, bitch
Now pop it
Pop yo' shit, bitch, pop yo' shit, bitch
Big booty hoes
And, I'm callin' out the big booty bitches
Pop yo' shit, bitch, pop yo' shit, bitch
Now pop it
Pop yo' shit, bitch, pop yo' shit, bitch
Now pop it
Pop yo' shit, bitch, pop yo' shit, bitch (huh)

Ain't no fallin' off, ho, I'll be dammed I let them catch me slippin'
And, yo' music wack as fuck, it come on in the car, I skip it
Yeah, I get delusional at times, at least I can admit it
Yeah, you got some money, fuck up out my face if you don't spend it
Five percent on all my windows, but you can't even see in here (uh-uh)
All up in the opps party, like who said I can't be in here? (The fuck?)
Everywhere I go, you gotta know I'm smokin' weed in there
Pussy wet as hell, that boy gon' fuck around and ski in here (woo)
All my bitches gang for real, that gang-gang shit be what we on (gang)
Pull up to the store, ho, get on point, and get up off that phone
Pillow talkin' 'bout me, you a hater, bitch, yo' cover blown (hatin'-ass)
That ho really green as hell, and I'm happy yo' true colors showed
Ain't never had a nigga took from me, I'm like fifteen and O
Yeah, I gotta couple bodies, but that shit ain't no secret though
They say I can't keep a nigga, but they know I keep some hoes
I ain't tryna shit on bitches, but don't give me a reason though (on gang)

Big booty hoes
And, I'm callin' out the big booty bitches
Pop yo' shit, bitch, pop yo' shit, bitch
Now pop it
Pop yo' shit, bitch, pop yo' shit, bitch
Now pop it
Pop yo' shit, bitch, pop yo' shit, bitch
Big booty hoes
And, I'm callin' out the big booty bitches
Pop yo' shit, bitch, pop yo' shit, bitch
Now pop it
Pop yo' shit, bitch, pop yo' shit, bitch
Now pop it
Pop yo' shit, bitch, pop yo' shit, bitch 

Pop yo' shit, bitch, pop yo' shit, bitch, pop yo' shit, bitch
Pop yo' shit, bitch, pop yo' shit, bitch
Pop yo' shit, bitch, pop yo' shit, bitch
On the gang
