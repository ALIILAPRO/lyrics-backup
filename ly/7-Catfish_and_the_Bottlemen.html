		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Larry, call a load of smoke in
I wanna lose a couple days
We've probably never struggled coping but
I never want to
Promise again that I would call her
Forget the time 'cause I'm seven hours behind
It's probably good I didn't call, though
But I always want to

And I'd beg you
But you know I'm never home
And I love you but I need another year alone
And I've tried to
Ignore it every time you phone
But I never come close

And I don't think through things
I never get time
'Cause I don't think things through

Larry call a load of smoke in
I wanna disappear for days
We've probably never struggled sleeping but
I never want to
Promise again that I would call her
Forget the time 'cause I'm seven hours behind
It's probably good I didn't call though
But I always want to

And I'd beg you
But you know I'm never home
And I love you but I need another year alone
And I've tried to
Ignore it every time you phone
But I never come close

I don't think through things
I never get time
'Cause I don't think things through
I don't think through things
I never get time
'Cause I don't think things through

And I'd beg you
But you know I'm never home
And I love you but I need another second to myself
And I've tried to
Ignore it every time you phone
But I never come close

(I don't think through things, I never get time) I'd beg you but you know I'm never home
(I don't think through things, I never get time) and I love you but I need another year alone
(I don't think through things, I never get time) and I've tried to ignore it every time you phone
But I never come close
