		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Look, false personas, all is hopeless in the game now
The wrong devotion flows through those who chase the same clout
The pollen floating through the industry got this congested
I'm XXL if they fit the pen in
Fuck who they pick as freshman
I SMS it, DM it and double send it 'til they get the message
I road tripped and left with
Nothing, I been in city of angels long enough to sit and question
Their successes, who they pay, and who they get in bed with
Ooh, I can't trust a nigga (Nah)
You rub a nigga wrong
Heard to get to your position that you'd suck a nigga off
And cover ups are troublesome
They're here a couple months then back up on the struggle bus
I see, the shoe fitting well on you cinderella boys
'Cause dressins feminine stepping in as a selling point
Renting toys, taking pics, hope you break a thousand likes
Claim you 'bout that life but niggas never see you out at night

I'ma need you to vacate the premises
You really reaching to maintain your relevance
The main reason why I don't have any friends in this
Is when I'm in the room, I'm addressing the elephants
And they paying for plays and traffic
They better off playing in traffic
I've peeped game for a while, I ain't quick to judge
But I can see 'em breaking character, the jig is up

The ones that claim that they the realest always wind up being fakest
Paying for them follows, every like and every favorite
The industry's a lie, I just wish that they would rap more
Artists bigger than me seem to never seem to use they platform
I've sold out shows without selling out my soul
I'm played in different states without me ever leaving home
I made a decision to go independent
When I wasn't winning 'cause trying to fit in
Ain't something to live with, when living the life I was given
I get it but I know I'll actually make it one day
When I step in the booth, I treat each record like a Sunday
A cracker sipping wine, and leave confessions for my one takes
Tracking every move, I'm face to face with Alan Nunn May
That relationship's a one way
Wanna talk numbers? Wanna talk about specifics?
If it was up to plays, I wouldn't drive around a Civic
My accomplishments is whispered by my critics
The ones that ride with me reap the benefits that come with it
I'm saying

I'ma need you to vacate the premises
You really reaching to maintain your relevance
The main reason why I don't have any friends in this
Is when I'm in the room, I'm addressing the elephants
And they paying for plays and traffic
They better off playing in traffic
I've peeped game for a while, I ain't quick to judge
But I can see 'em breaking character, the jig is up
