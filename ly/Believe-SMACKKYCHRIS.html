		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know you so well, so well
I mean, I can do anything that he can
I know you so well, so well
I mean, I can do anything that he can
I'm in pain, wanna put ten shots in my brain
I've been tripping 'bout some things, can't change
Suicidal, same time I'm tame, picture this, in bed, get a phone call
Girl that you f**ked with killed herself
That was this summer and nobody helped
And ever since then, man, I hate myself
Wanna f**king end it, pessimistic
All wanna see me with no pot to piss in
But n***as been excited 'bout the grave I'm digging
Having conversations about my haste decisions
F**king sickening
At the same time, memory surfaced through the grapevine
'Bout my uncle playing with a slipknot
Post-Traumatic-Stress got me f**ked up
Been f**ked up since a couple months they had a n***a locked up
I know you so well, so well
I mean, I can do anything that he can
I know you so well, so well
I mean, I can do anything that he can
