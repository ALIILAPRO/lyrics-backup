Yeah
Hot hot hot
Hot hot hot
Hot hot hot
Hot hot hot
Let's make it hot
Give me all that you got
Drop it on me mama
Big squat
Haters can't tell me
Zip squat
See it right through like
Zip lock
Point blank period
Big dot
Her boyfriend furious
Big clot
Fast And The Furious
Spin block
Girlfriend curios heard I got a big Whoohooo
She wanna sample aye
Burn that bitch up
Like candle flame
One thing can't say my name in vain
That's hot tea
Watch the handle frame
I'm Too spicy
Got you dripping in sweat
You icy I melt that
It's dripping it's wet
Should charge a hi fee
Pack a punch Hi-C
I got high heat
One hundred percent
I
Hit them with that one-two
Cha Cha
Serving food
Come through bite my salsa
You know what it is
I'm hot like my chick
I'm hot as it gets
You know what I mean
I didn't go to college, but I still keep it 100 degrees
Aye my price going up gasolina
Stay on your toes my ballerina
Tapitoe or Valentina
Spice your life
Got what you need
Big drip Aquafina
Your chick, my cocina
Shining like a sunbeam huh
Tell em get your sunscreen up
Cause bitch I'm
Hot hot hot hot hot hot
Bitch I'm
Hot hot hot hot hot hot
Bitch I'm
Hot hot hot hot hot hot
Bitch I'm
Hot hot hot hot hot hot
Let em know that it's hot
It's burning up
Let em know, let em know
It's burning up
Let em know that it's hot
It's burning up
Let em know, let em know
It's burning up
Let em know that it's hot
It's burning up
Let em know, let em know
It's burning up
Let em know that it's hot
It's burning up
Let em know, let em know
It's burning up
Let em know that's it
Set the roof on fire let the mothafucka burn up
Bring the house down how else do you turn up
Hot in the mouth and I'm spitting inferna
Cold hearted people never really concerned us
Can't touch this this too Tsss
Burn that bitch like Tsss
Come to your two senses
You ain't about it and I sensed it
It's going up like my thermostat
Like weed best believe I'm burning that
Once you get me ain't no turning back
I bring that heat ain't no that learning that
It's going up like my thermostat
Like weed best believe I'm burning that
Once you get me ain't no turning back
I bring that heat ain't no that learning that
Cause bitch I'm hot
