		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take my time wit' it, when I'm up in it
She be screaming out whoa-oh-oh
She wanna ride in it, she wan' get high in it
When she see me, she like whoa-oh

Take my time wit' it, when I'm up in it
She be screaming out whoa-oh-oh
She wanna ride in it, she wan' get high in it
When she see me, she like whoa-oh
I be thumbing through these bands, no, I can't live without them
Bought this bitch Balenci' 'case she don't like fits without 'em
When you see me, its all black, know that's my type
Ain't gotta tell 'em 'cause they know

Piece of mine to take
It's mine to take, need time for myself
This where I decide to cut the ties
And live my life for myself

Open up my eyes, see I'm dealing with this shit
Open my mind, you won't like what you get
Ain't been doing right, yeah, I hate to admit
But I don't care, yeah, I don't care
On edge, on edge, yeah, I don't care
My days don't end well, I don't care
I'm at war with myself, ain't nobody else here

Take my time wit' it, when I'm up in it
She be screaming out whoa-oh-oh
She wanna ride in it, she wan' get high in it
When she see me, she like whoa-oh-oh

I be thumbing through these bands, no, I can't live without them
Bought this bitch Balenci' 'case she don't like fits without 'em
When you see me, its all black, know that's my type
Ain't gotta tell 'em 'cos they know-ow-ow

Piece of mine to take
It's mine to take, need time for myself
This where I decide to cut the ties
And live my life for myself
