		  Mr. Worldwide!
Ha ha ha
With the mami, with the sexiest body
J.Lo, let's ride!

I would like, to get, to know you, baby
Like, to get, a piece of that sexy body
I would like to get, to know you, baby
Like, to get, a piece of that sexy body
Like, to get, a piece of that sexy body
A piece of that sexy body

I got the flow that took over the globe, yeah
I got the cribs on the island for sure, yeah
I got the jet fueled up, ready to go
I put my money where my mouth is
I got the bread to blow
Baby believe me, baby you need me
Don't deceive me, then we'll be straight
And whenever you see me
Baby just tease me
I like a little foreplay, yeah that's great
Now you're thinking that you know me
But you don't 'cause I do things these men won't
These boys act like they're ballers
But they ain't
I definitely do the things that they can't
I'm in my own world, girl, no rules, no laws
No thongs, no bras
Now show me that sexy body, baby, I wanna see it all

I would like, to get, to know you, baby
Like, to get, a piece of that sexy body
I would like, to get, to know you, baby
Like, to get, a piece of that sexy body
Like, to get, a piece of that sexy body
A piece of that sexy body

S for the sex
E for the e in
X, forget about your ex
Y, 'cause baby, I'm up next
B for the best
O for the one
D 'cause I'm down
Y, yolo, done
Home run, grand slam
I am, the man
You're the biddy-bing-bing-bang-bang, that thang
Now I'm actin' a fool, girl ain't no rules
Why hit one when I can hit a few?
It's been like that since high school
If it ain't broke, why fix it? 
This shit, gon' gift it
Word to the wise; keep it long distance
Don't need assistance, so mind your business
I hit and run, but when it comes to a sexy body, you're the one

Got a feeling that maybe this just was meant to be
Let's go, oh
Wanna feel you come in close like you belong to me
There's one thing I don't know

I would like, to get, to know you, baby
Like, to get, a piece of that sexy body
I would like, to get, to know you, baby
Like, to get, a piece of that sexy body
I would like, to get, to know you, baby
Like, to get, a piece of that sexy body
I would like, to get, to know you, baby
Like, to get, a piece of that sexy body
Like, to get, a piece of that sexy body
A piece of that sexy body
