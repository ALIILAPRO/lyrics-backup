		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take me to heart, I'll always love you
And nobody can make me do wrong
Take me for granted, leaving love unshown
Makes will power weak and temptation strong

A woman's only human, you should understand
She's not just a play thing
She's flesh and blood just like her man
If you want a do right, all day's woman
You've gotta be a do right, all night man

Yeah, yeah, they say that it's a man's world
But you can't prove that by me
And as long as we're together, baby
Show some respect for me

If you want a do right, all day's woman
You've gotta be a do right, all night man

Oh, a woman's only human, this you should understand
She's not just a play thing
She's flesh and blood just like her man
If you want a do right, all day's woman
You've gotta be a do right, all night man
You've gotta be a do right, all night man
