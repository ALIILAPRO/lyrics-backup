		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Declare this an emergency
Come on and spread a sense of urgency
And pull us through
And pull us through

And this is the end
This is the end
Of the world

And it's time we saw a miracle
Come on, it's time for something biblical
To pull us through
And pull us through

And this is the end
This is the end
Of the world

Proclaim eternal victory
Come on and change the cause of history
And pull us through
And pull us through

And this is the end
This is the end
Of the world
