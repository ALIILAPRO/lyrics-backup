		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell me about you, tell me your secrets
Tell me and tell nobody else
'Cause I can be jealous or I can be selfish
I can be more than you could bare
I wish it were easy, if lovin' was easy
I'd run my hands along your hair
And tell you about me, tell you about me
Lay down my guard for something else

What you got is what I want
What you are is what I need for me
What you got is what I want
What you are is what I need for me

What I need for me, what I need for me
What I need for me, what I need for me

Has no one told you you're beautiful?
You're all you need to be
Why you being so cynical of what you mean to me?
Has no one told you you're precious, told you're perfect
Told you you're all the world could want?
Baby, you're reckless, but you'll never wreck this
Baby, with me you've always won

What you got is what I want
What you are is what I need for me
What you got is what I want
What you are is what I need for me

What I need for me, what I need for me
What I need for me, what I need for me
