		<p>
		  That girl will never be mine
First time
I saw her at the front door
That girl
Her face on every billboard
Hands down
You won't believe the way she laid her eyes on me
Six feet
What was I thought I got I'd get for
So fly
We got into a small talk
Too bad
She had to move along
One smile and she was gone

Can't explain
I never thought that I was gonna loose my head
Call me insane
There's got to be a way

How can I get next to her?
Now, tell me how it's gonna be done
Will I win or lose this one?
Don't care about the fact
She's in a different league
They say it's no use that I try
That girl will never be mine

Next thing
She's livin' in my TV
And that girl
Is stealin' every daydream
Tough love
She had to be the one for me
When I just sing away
Last night ran into a big thing
Guess what
She didn't want to see me
They said I was outta line
Who's wrong, who's right this time?

Can't explain
I never thought that I was gonna lose my head
Call me insane
There's got to be a way

How can I get next to her?
Now, tell me how it's gonna be done
Will I win or lose this one?
Don't care about the fact
She's in a different league
They say it's no use that I try
That girl will never be mine

That girl
Is freakin' me out
Don't care about the fact
That she's all that
That girl
Is pullin' out the down
There's no way for me to stop

That girl
Tearin' up the big screen
That girl
Stealin' every daydream
Tough love
She had to be the one for me
She will be mine
No matter what they try to say
There's got to be a way

How can I get next to her?
Now, tell me how it's gonna be done
Will I win or lose this one?
Don't care about the fact
She's in a different league
They say it's no use that I try
They say it's no use that I try
That girl will never be mine
