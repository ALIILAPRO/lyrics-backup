		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Another time
In the age of wonder
Another world 
Another time
This land was green and good
Until the crystal cracked!
Once more, they will replenish themselves
Change and then wait
The power of their source...
The crystal...
The crystal...
The crystal
The power of their source...
The crystal
Oh my God, this is embarrassing
Oh my God, this is embarrassing
Oh
Oh my God, this is embarrassing
Oh my God, this is embarrassing
Oh my God, this is embarrassing
Oh my God, this is embarrassing
Oh my God, this is embarrassing
Oh my God, this is embarrassing
Oh my God, this is embarrassing
Oh my God, this is embarrassing
Uh-Oh, I don't want you to trip like me I want you to have fun
Me and you
Oh my God, this is embarrassing
Uh-Oh, I don't want you to trip like I do
Uh-Oh
Oh my God
Aaaah!

Oh my God, this is embarrassing

Don't want you to trip like I do
Oh my God
Aaaah!
