		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I really hope I can do it
'Cause they're all depending on me
I know that I must leave the only home I've ever known
And brave the dangers of the forest
Saving them before they're eaten
I mean, how hard can that be?

Looking up at a sunny sky, so shiny and blue and there's a butterfly
Well, isn't that a super fantastic sign
It's gonna be a fantastic day
Such marvelousness
It's gonna bring, got a pocket full of songs that I'm gonna sing
And I'm ready to take on anything
Hooray!
Some super fun surprise around each corner
Just riding on a rainbow, I'm gonna be okay

Hey!
I'm not giving up today
There's nothing getting in my way
And if you knock knock me over
I will get back up again, oh
If something goes a little wrong
Well you can go ahead and bring it on
'Cause if you knock knock me over, I will get back up again
Whoa oh oh oh oh, get back up again, whoa oh oh oh oh oh

I'm marching along I got confidence
I'm cooler than a pack of peppermints
And I haven't been this excited since
I can't remember when!

I'm off on this remarkable adventure
Just riding on a rainbow
What if it's all a big mistake
What if it's more than I can take
No I can't think that way 'cause I know that
I'm really, really, really gonna be okay

Hey!
I'm not giving up today
There's nothing getting in my way
And if you knock knock me over
I will get back up again, oh
If something goes a little wrong
Well you can go ahead and bring it on
'Cause if you knock knock me over, I will get back up again

Whoa oh oh oh oh, get back up again, whoa oh oh oh oh oh (I'm okay)
Whoa oh oh oh oh
And if you knock knock me over, you knock knock me over
I will get back up again
