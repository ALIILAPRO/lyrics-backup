		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've really got to use my imagination
To think of good reasons 
To keep on keepin' on

Got to make the best of a bad situation
Ever since that day 
I woke up and found
That you were gone

Darkness all around me 
Blackin out the sun
Old friends call me
But I just don't feel like talkin to anyone

Emptiness has found me
And it just wont let me go
I go right on livin'
But why I just don't know

Staring down reality
Don't do me no good
'Cause our misunderstanding
Is too well understood

Such a sad, sad season
When a good love dies.
Not a day goes by
When I don't realize

I've really got to use my imagination
To think of good reasons
To keep on keepin' on

Got to make the best of a bad situation
Ever since that day
I woke up and found
That you were gone
