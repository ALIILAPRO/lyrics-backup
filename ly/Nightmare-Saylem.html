		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Cover the mirror and windows at night
Avoid your reflection and turn out the light
Don't say my name
Though I know that you might
Your curiosity will kill you
Hiding beneath all the blankets for cover
Don't sneak a peek of what is floating above you
Yeah it's floating above you

Welcome to the nightmare
You look like you've seen a ghost
Gripping at the bedsheets
Screaming bloody murder in your home
You think you're alone?

Sticks and stones may break my bones
But ghosts will never haunt me
But when I lay myself to sleep
There's something right beside me
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But ghosts will never haunt me
But when I lay myself to sleep
There's something right beside me

Welcome to the nightmare
You look like you've seen a ghost
Gripping at the bedsheets
Screaming bloody murder in your home
Welcome to the nightmare
You look like you've seen a ghost
Gripping at the bedsheets
Screaming bloody murder in your home

It's all fun and games until the person in the mirror
Is someone staring back with a face that you can't remember
Tearing at the seams
But I don't really see a problem
Couldn't drown my demons
So I decided to join them
You think you're alone?

Welcome to the nightmare
You look like you've seen a ghost
Gripping at the bedsheets
Screaming bloody murder in your home
Welcome to the nightmare
You look like you've seen a ghost
Gripping at the bedsheets
Screaming bloody murder in your home
