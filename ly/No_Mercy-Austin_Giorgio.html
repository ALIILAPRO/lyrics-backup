		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I will send you
To your knees praying
With my name
Rolling off your tongue
I will take you
Right to the forbidden
So good it must be sinning
I'll let you be the judge
Baby I can lock the door
You hold the keys
Yeah I'll write the song
You're the symphony
We know who's in control
No mercy show me how you love babe
Burning gasoline in my veins
Search me you're the judge and jury
So love me love me with no mercy
Why don't you love me
No mercy
Why don't you love me
No mercy
So why don't you love me
No mercy
With no mercy mercy
You look stunning
In that Valentino
One zip and the sleeves go
Right on the floor
I'm over your shoulder
Kissin your skin
It feels like heaven
Far from innocent
You like your necklace
The shape of my hand
You clasp it in
Baby I can lock the door
You hold the keys
Yeah I'll write the song
You're the symphony
We know who's in control
No mercy show me how you love babe
Burning gasoline in my veins
Search me you're the judge and jury
So love me love me with no mercy
Show me how you love babe
How you love me
Gasoline in my veins
In my veins
Show me how you love babe
How you love me
With no mercy mercy
