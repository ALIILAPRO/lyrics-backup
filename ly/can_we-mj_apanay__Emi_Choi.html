		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can we
Dance in the moonlight
Hold hands if the mood's right
Make plans till the sunrise
And sleep till noon I'll take you to
The beach, get our toes wet
And leave after sunset
And I would do it all again
'Cause I don't want my day to end with

Always runnin' in circles
Tryin' to make up my mind
Should I ask you
I'm too scared to ask
But I'll probably ask you this time
Spent a couple of hours
Alright, a couple of days
Tryin' to choose where I wanna take you
And rehearsing what I'm gonna say

'Cause I have been plannin' for quite a long while
Been askin' your friends how to best make you smile
And I don't wanna mess up like I always do
When I try to say this to you

Can we
Dance in the moonlight
Hold hands if the mood's right
Make plans till the sunrise
And sleep till noon I'll take you to
The beach, get our toes wet
And leave after sunset
And I would do it all again
'Cause I don't want my day to end with

Boy you're running in circles
You're always in my mind
I'm wondering when you will tell me
That you really wanna be mine
Spent a couple of hours,
And a couple of days
Thinking that maybe I read the wrong signs
And that you just don't feel the same way

'Cause I have been waiting for quite a long time
Been patiently giving you reasons to find
The courage to say what you're wanting to do
I just wanna hear this from you

Can we
Dance in the moonlight
Hold hands if the mood's right
Make plans till the sunrise
And sleep till noon I'll take you to
The beach, get our toes wet
And leave after sunset
And I would do it all again
'Cause I don't want my day to end with

You
La ra, ra, da ra ra
La ra, ra, da ra ra
You
La ra, ra, da ra ra
La ra
Can we
