		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There are things in life you learn
And oh in time you'll see
It's out there somewhere
It's all waiting
If you keep believing
So don't run
Don't hide
It will be alright
You'll see
Trust me
I'll be there watching over you

Just take a look through my eyes
There's a better place somewhere out there
Just take a look through my eyes
Everything changes
You'll be amazed what you'll find
(There's a better place)
If you look through my eyes

There will be times on this journey
All you'll see is darkness
But out there somewhere
Daylight finds you
If you keep believing
So don't run
Don't hide
It will be alright
You'll see
Trust me
I'll be there watching over you

Just take a look through my eyes
there's better place somewhere out there
Just take a look through my eyes
Everything changes
You'll be amazed what you'll find
(There's a better place)
If you look through my eyes

All the things that you can change
There's a meaning in everything
And you will find all you need
There's so much to understand
Take a look (take a look) through my eyes
there's a better place somewhere out there
Just take a look (take a look) through my eyes
Everything changes
You'll be amazed what you'll find
(You'll be amazed if you just take a look)
Look through my eyes there's a better place somewhere out there
Just take a look through my eyes
Everything changes
You'll be amazed what you'll find
If you look through my eyes
Just take a look through my eyes
If you look through my eyes 
Take a look through my eyes
