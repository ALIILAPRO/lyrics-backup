		  Eldee the don
Sarz on the beat
It's Trybe records oshe
You see this chemical
If you use it to wash this paper

3k BIS na wash
They say dem don turn am to 1 5 na wash
20kobo for phone call na wash
Contract line na sign say you dey ball na wash

Me I don't go to the Mainland na wash
I stay close to Banana Island na wash
Excuse me what is BRT na wash
When in the club I chill in VIP na wash

Huh I'm going to feature Wyclef na wash
Jonathan dey pick my call himself na wash
Ooooh Jay Z too dey ping me jor na wash
I been dey follow Messi play before na wash

See me I only fly first class na wash
Na me wey produce fimile for Kas na wash
This my new gbedu na him sure pass na wash
Ask my mom I came first in every class na wash in every class

We dey wash
Everybody's always tryna be posh
Pretending like say we dey floss
But if you really check am na wash
We dey wash

We dey lie
To look better than the next we try
And everybody is a balling guy
But if you really check am na wash
We dey wash

Louis Vuitton na wash
Fendi Gucci Prada Ferragamo na wash
She say her shoe na Chris Lobu ton na wash
She say she no dey wear tailor Lauren na wash

I've never eaten amala na wash
I've never tasted alomo or paraga na wash
Me I've never taken okada na wash
I've never ever had pure water na wash

I only wear human hair o na wash
It's from Dubai me I don't ever shop here o na wash
I have four Blackberry handsets na wash
I'm going to have my wedding in Seychelles na wash

Noo I don't kiss on the first date na wash
After clubbing I can't go to a guys place na wash
Without make up I still have a fine face na wash
I'm serious this is my first time noww na wash

We dey wash
Everybody's always tryna be posh
Pretending like say we dey floss
But if you really check am na wash
We dey wash

We dey lie
To look better than the next we try
And everybody is a balling guy
But if you really check am na wash
We dey wash

Fashola is a close friend na wash
Dem show my video for CNN na wash
O boy see as I dey pop Rose na wash
I'm a friend of Aliko Dangote na wash

I no dye wear one shoe twice na wash
When I dye shop I no dey ask for price na wash
I only basmati rice na wash
Barack Obama dey call me for advice na wash

You see the Lord sent me to you na wash
It is well just sow a seed or two na wash
The more you sow the more you reap na wash
Do more my guy don't be cheap na wash

I'm a youth too I share your plight na wash
That's why I'm here to fight for your right na wash
Vote for me and I will give you light na wash
After we win everything will be alright na wash alllright

We dey wash
Everybody's always tryna be posh
Pretending like say we dey floss
But if you really check am na wash
We dey wash

We dey lie
To look better than the next we try
And everybody is a balling guy
But if you really check am na wash
We dey wash

We dey wash
Everybody's always tryna be posh
Pretending like say we dey floss
But if you really check am na wash
We dey wash

We dey lie
To look better than the next we try
And everybody is a balling guy
But if you really check am na wash
We dey wash
We dey wash

Na wash
