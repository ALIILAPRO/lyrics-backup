		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Pull up
Mad as hell, I hate this fucking place
4g on my waist
I send that pussy to it's grave
Okay, my ex a fucking thot
I told that bitch move out my way
I got these ropes around my neck
So kick the chair and watch me sway
Okay like, pull up
Mad as hell, I hate this fucking place
4g on my waist
I send that pussy to it's grave
Okay, my ex a fucking thot
I told that bitch move out my way
I got these ropes around my neck
So kick the chair and watch me sway, sway
Sway watch me sway, sway, sway
Watch me sway
Watch me sway, sway, sway, sway, sway
Watch me sway

Yeah tell it n' sell it motherfucker
Then chop off the roof, yuh
Crank it n' skirt it n' buy
It, then we gotta zoom, yuh
Raid it n' snatch it n' bag
It, then you gotta move, yuh
Pack up n' load it n' light it
Then he gotta snooze
Bitch got me fucked up, look like a typo
Hoe not important, that bitch be a side note
Dick like the horn of a rhino
Deep in that bitch till
Her motherfuckin' eyes roll
Doing this shit with my eyes closed
Boy I got shit that will blast in a silo
Cutting his shit
Watch him motherfuckin' die slow
Leaving his body in the back of a bi-lo
Clap on, clap off, hit that bitch raw
Now her man singing them sad songs
Wax on, wax off, wax on, wax off
Fist put a crack in the asphalt, uh
Tick tock, tick tock, check my wrist watch
I ain't got time for no pish posh, uh
Bitch I'm pissed off, get yo' shit rocked
Pussy mutha fucka
You can get yo' shit tossed

Pull up
Mad as hell, I hate this fucking place
4g on my waist
I send that pussy to his grave
Okay, my ex a fucking thot
I told that bitch move out my way
I got these ropes around my neck
So kick the chair and watch me sway, sway
Sway watch me sway, sway, sway
Watch me sway
Watch me sway, sway, sway, sway, sway
Watch me sway
