		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm standing here alone now, afraid of the dark
Watch your light shine on me, sure the way's not too far
I just can't make a move anytime you are near
Feel it crawling up inside

The moment that I met you, got under my skin
With your flawless smile and the way you movin'
A flower in the glass dome, you're out of my reach
You're beautiful, beautiful

I just wanna take, take, take you the way you are
I wanna make, make, make you my shooting star
I wanna take, take, take you the way you ared
I will never be the same again with you
The same again with you

I just wanna take, take, take you the way you are
I wanna make, make, make you my shooting star
I wanna take, take, take you the way you are
I will never be the same again with you

Let's start off drinking up now, or we'll stand here instead
As you mesmerize me, oh this life is not fair
I wish I'd be the man that you dream of at night
I'd do anything for you

I'm waiting for a chance to get closer to you
Now my feet don't listen and my voice breaks down too 
A flower in the glass dome you're out of my reach
Forever untouchable

I just wanna take, take, take you the way you are
I wanna make, make, make you my shooting star
I wanna take, take, take you the way you are
I will never be the same again with you

Talk to me for a little while
'Cause I can't wait one more night
Every time that I see your smile
I just wanna be by your side

'Cause I am paralyzed any time our eyes meet
And my heartbeat's going much faster
Everything I want is to be with you
I wanna get close to you

I just wanna take, take, take you the way you are
I wanna make, make, make you my shooting star
I wanna take, take, take you the way you are
I will never be the same again with you

'Cause everything I feel every time our eyes meet
It's my heartbeat going much faster
Everything I want I just wanna get close to you
We will never be the same again
