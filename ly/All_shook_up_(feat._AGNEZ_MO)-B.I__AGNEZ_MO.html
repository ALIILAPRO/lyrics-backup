		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She said let me wear your jacket, take it off
I said "baby you can have it, have it all"
Know it sounds a bit dramatic
But I never had this
Just want it to last

When we're out all night sippin' Mai Tais
Getting drunk off of your eyes
Doing it every day
Making me wanna stay-ay-ay

It's way more than a one night
Feeling more like a lifetime
I'll do it every day-ay-ay-ay

My b-b-baby got me all shook up
So suffocating, but that's all I want
I used to run the other way
Call it love, then get my space
But tonight I'm getting closer, yeah

My b-b-baby got me all shook up
So suffocating, but that's all I want
I used to run the other way
Call it love, then get my space
But tonight I'm getting closer, yeah

My b-b-baby got me
All shook up
Really got me all
All shook up, yeah
All shook up
Really got me all
All shook up, yeah

All shook up like Elvis
Got me so helpless
No helping the way I'm melting up around you all day 'n night
You make me wanna freeze the time
I'm falling
Down bad and I need assistance
Got a taste, I'm addicted
Turned around, yeah, I'm twisted on you

Shook up, leavin' me shakin'
Callin me sugar, makin' me crazy
Makin' me check on my phone on the repeat
Got me all starin' at texts on the daily
And I be never like this not ever
Like this rarely hangin' on barely
Top speed barreling' think I need clarity now
'Cause this is all wearin' me out, wow

My b-b-baby got me all shook up
So suffocating but that's all I want
I used to run the other way
Call it love then get my space
But tonight I'm getting closer, yeah

My b-b-baby got me
All shook up
Really got me all
All shook up, yeah
All shook up
Really got me all
All shook up

취한 듯해 술 한 모금 없이
이 혼란스러움이 나쁘진 않지
취한 듯해 술 한 모금 없이
이 혼란스러움이 (wow)

My b-b-baby got me all shook up
So suffocating, but that's all I want
I used to run the other way
Call it love, then get my space
But tonight I'm getting closer, yeah

My b-b-baby got me
All shook up
Really got me all
All shook up, yeah
All shook up
Really got me all
All shook up
