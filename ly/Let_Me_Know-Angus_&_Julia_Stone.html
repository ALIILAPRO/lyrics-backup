		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do I stay? Do I go?
Waiting for someone to let me know
'Cause that old town's got me blue
Hm, it's not so neat without you

Waiting for someone to walk up and let me know
Waiting for someone to walk up and let me know
Waiting for someone to come up and let me know (do I stay or do I go?)
Waiting for someone, my friend (do I stay or do I go?)
Waiting for someone (do I stay or do I go?)
Do I stay or do I go? (Waiting for someone, come on, let me know)
Stay (do I stay or do I go?) Do I go?

See the snow melt
See the snow melt cold in your hand
Ah, where'd you land? Where did you go?
Hm, this tired old town, it's not so neat without you

Waiting for someone to walk up and let me know
(Do I stay or do I go?)
Waiting for someone to walk up and let me know (where did you go?)
(Do I stay or do I go?)
Waiting for someone to come up and let me know
(Do I stay or do I go?)
(Waiting for someone) walk on, walk on, my friend
(Do I stay or do I go?)
Waiting for someone, come up, let me know
(Do I stay or do I go?) Do I stay? Do I go?
(Waiting for someone, come on, let me know)
Do I stay? Do I go? (Waiting for someone, come up, let me know) 
Do I stay or do I go?
Waiting for someone, come on 
(Waiting for someone to walk up and let me know) 
Do I stay? Do I go?
(Do I stay or do I go?)
Do I stay? Oh, do I go? (Do I stay or do I go?)

(Do I stay or do I go?)
(Do I stay or do I go?)
(Do I stay or do I go?)
(Do I stay or do I go?)
(Do I stay or do I go?)

Waiting for someone, come up, let me know (do I stay or do I go?) 
Waiting for someone
(Do I stay or do I go?)
Do I stay? (Waiting for someone, come up, let me know) 
Do I stay or do I go? (Waiting for someone)
(Waiting for someone to walk up and let me know)
(Do I stay or do I go?)
Do I stay? (Do I stay or do I go?) Oh, gonna walk on, my friend
