		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let me take you on a journey below
Where you'll forget about reality
And all you know stuck inside a glitch like
An animatronic that broke
Someone is pulling the strings
We're the stars of the show!

Welcome to the cemetery of abominations
The forgotten monsters Scott Cawthon's making
If you come with us we've
Got a coffin waiting
You know you've got to run when we all awaken

Who do we trust? What do we need?
This is inception and I went a level too deep
Between the lines I need to read
So we can be released from these evil dreams

This RPG is hard to beat with so
Many secrets that they keep beneath
Want some pizza? Come and eat a piece
Sing the chorus, make it cheesy please!

I'll be your friend, right till the end
Join the party!
Don't be afraid, we'll find a way
Join the party!
Follow the pack, we'll have a blast
Join the party!
I'm here for you, we'll make it through
Join the party!
Join the party! Join the party!

There's more to this than
Simple 8-bit gimmicks
Every line of dialogue has
Gotten awful cryptic
If i'm picking a fight then
I'm going to finish it
Foxy jump-scare RAH! How'd you miss it?

Did you catch that attack? Mimic it quick
Bonnie's getting us buffed with
His sick rifts
Bytes and chips, tricks, gifts, and glitches
Living on the flip side, life is twisted

The hands of time will not stop ticking
Find all the clocks, this is your mission
Got a slot open, need fill the position
Which one of you will make
The most efficient addition?

We're all broken, but we've got these tokens
You can just ask Fredbear how
We keep it golden

I'll be your friend, right till the end
Join the party!
Don't be afraid, we'll find a way
Join the party!
Follow the pack, we'll have a blast
Join the party!
I'm here for you, we'll make it through
Join the party!
Graveyards and dungeons, darkness, disaster
Death and destruction, demented and shattered
If we're just puppets then who is our master?
This ain't the end yet
It's just the next chapter

I was an animatronic, but I became a weapon
With a pretty dark past
That I ain't forgetting
Don't mess with us unless you
Want a painful lesson
Because we're dishing out bites like it's 87'

You will never be safe
We got insane aggression
It ain't a question why
We became an obsession
We will not be slaves to ScottGames forever
It's no wonder Freddy Fazbear's
Name is legend!

We'll never let you go
In case you didn't know!

I'll be your friend, right till the end
Join the party!
Don't be afraid, we'll find a way
Join the party!
Follow the pack, we'll have a blast
Join the party!
I'm here for you, we'll make it through
Join the party!
