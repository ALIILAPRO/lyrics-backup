		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Majestic with his dark beauty full of pain
Under the sky he stays and is wandering in the lust night
He is looking for the next victim the next lost soul
Fallen angel from heaven needs some victim

He's so sad in this moment he is looking for you
On God's soul you pray your prayer but for you
Want the Light of Angel
Light of Lucifer
The moon reveals the Hope of, Hope of Prodigy

You will cry this night when the Angel of Lust will come
To bring you with him to hell
You will cry this night when the Angel of Lust will come
To bring you with him to hell

Oh yeah

He's so sad in this moment he is looking for you
On God's soul you pray your prayer but for you
Want the Light of Angel
Light of Lucifer
The moon reveals the Hope of, Hope of Prodigy

You, Virgin of the lake your tears are pearls
Drained by the Angels sharp tongue let you fall into the embrace of evil
God cannot save you this night
Lucifer master of elegant brutality
Virgin enchanted by the penetrating glance of her master she is crying
I hear her sobs
The night with his wings covers the ceremony of souls

You are the virgin of Lucifer
You will burn in the Lake of Flames
You will enter the infernal world

You are the virgin of Lucifer
You will burn in the Lake of Flames
You will enter the infernal world

You are the virgin of Lucifer
You will burn in the Lake of Flames
You will enter the infernal world

You are the virgin of Lucifer
You will burn in the Lake of Flames
You will enter the infernal world
