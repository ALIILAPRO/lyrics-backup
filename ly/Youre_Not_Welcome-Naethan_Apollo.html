		  Hello!

I don't start fights but I'll handle you just fine
Usually I'm very kind to others
But I won't think twice if you step to me or mine
You're a slimy little motherfucker

Uh-oh, don't you know?
You're not welcome 'round here
I think you should go
'Fore you cause some drama
Uh-oh, don't you know?
I'm the one you should fear (should fear)
Talk to me if you've got a problem (got a problem)

I can't believe you used to truly scare me
You were like a ghost story told to keep me wary
But I never listened, no, I slept good 'til morning
And when our paths finally crossed, I didn't heed the warning
Then push, push, push, push
Yeah, you pushed me to the edge
I used to dread the thought of falling quickly
But now, I just wish that you'd send me off that ledge
So I can finally fucking take you with me

Uh-oh, don't you know?
You're not welcome 'round here
I think you should go
'Fore you cause some drama (cause some drama)
Uh-oh, don't you know?
I'm the one you should fear (should fear)
Talk to me if you've got a problem (got a problem)

Uh-oh, don't you know?
You're not welcome 'round here
I think you should go
'Fore you cause some drama (cause some drama)
Uh-oh, don't you know?
I'm the one you should fear (should fear)
Talk to me if you've got a problem (got a problem, got a problem)
(Got a problem, got a problem, got a problem, got a problem)

Uh-oh, don't you know?
You're not welcome 'round here
I think you should go
'Fore you cause some drama (cause some drama)
Uh-oh, don't you know?
I'm the one you should fear (should fear)
Talk to me if you've got a problem

Uh-oh, don't you know?
You're not welcome 'round here
I think you should go
'Fore you cause some drama
Uh-oh, don't you know?
I'm the one you should fear
Talk to me if you've got a problem
