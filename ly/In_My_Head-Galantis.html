		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's been just four days
But it's outta my hands
When I wake alone
I am catching my breath
And when I close my eyes
I get lost in your face
I'm gonna fall fall hard
No I don't give a damn

I wanna love out loud
But I'm scared to say
It's like a ton of bricks
That won't fade away

I do it for you
I do it for you

Now you're in my head
And it's outta my hands
When you're in my thoughts
I don't wanna pretend
And I lose control, with you
But you're in my head
But you're in my head

I do it for
I do it for 

Think I won't feel a thing
If I give it some time
But your love is a wave
Washin' over my mind
When I stand my ground
I only get high
Being next to you
My heart is on fire

Now you're in my head
And it's outta my hands
When you're in my thoughts
I don't wanna pretend
And I lose control, with you
But you're in my head
But you're in my head

I do it for
I do it for 

I do it for
I do it for
