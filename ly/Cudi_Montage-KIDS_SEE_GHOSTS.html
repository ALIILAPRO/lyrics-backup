		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Find my back
In the cold, trapped in another soul, they can hear me holler
I'm colder than the game, see 'em all strapped
And they can't move and I'm sinkin' lower
Heaven gonna help me, 'cause I feel the world weighin' on me heavy, tryna keep it steady
Ready for the mission, God shine your love on me, save me please
If I'm goin' alone, I've been gone for so long
Ain't nobody, you can't hear a word
Perched in the night, lookin' out nowhere
Where's home? I done hit a nerve
Pain in my eyes, in the time I find, I'm stronger than I ever was
Here we go again, God shine your love on me, save me please

Hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah
Stay strong
Hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah
Stay strong
Hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah
Save me, Lord
Hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah
Stay strong
Hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah
Save me, Lord
Hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah
Stay strong
Hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah
Save me, Lord
Hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah

Everybody want world peace
'Til your niece get shot in the dome-piece
Then you go and buy your own piece
Hopin' it'll help you find your own peace
Bring light to what they don't see
Auntie cryin' on the concrete
Talkin' to dispatcher when the phone beep
On the other line was the homies
Told her that you ain't comin' home, B
When she heard the news it hurt her bone-deep
Caught with the rifle with the long reach
Just another cycle of the lonely
All growin' up in environments
Where doin' crime the requirement
They send us off to prison for retirement
Hopefully Alice Johnson will inspire men

Lord shine your light on me, save me, please (hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah)
Stay strong
Lord shine your light on me, save me, please (hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah)
Stay strong
Lord shine your light on me, save me, please (hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah)
Save me, Lord
Yes, shine your light on me, save me (hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah)
Stay strong
Lord shine your light on me, save me, please (hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah)
Save me, Lord
Lord shine your light on me, save me, please (hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah)
Stay strong
Lord shine your light on me, save me, please (hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah)
Save me, Lord
Lord shine your light on me, save me, please
Lord shine your light on me, save me, please (hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah)
Stay strong
Lord shine your light on me, save me, please (hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah)
Stay strong

Both sides lose somebody
Somebody dies, somebody goes to jail
woah, woah
Stay strong
Light on me, save me please (hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah)
Stay strong
Lord, shine your light on me, save me, please (hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah)
Stay strong
Shine your light on me, save me, please (hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah)
Save me, Lord
Shine your light on me (hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah)
Stay strong
