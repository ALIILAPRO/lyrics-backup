		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I feel no pain anymore since you've gone away
I'm not the same anymore just a cold embrace
I see the light through the dark but I hide my face
How do we find our way to a better place

I feel no pain anymore since you've gone away
All of the fear inside of me fades away

And down again I've fallen
Through the same
Empty self-inflicted void again
How long can we survive in this cold world

How long have I been asleep
And how long have I been waiting for a change
I didn't think it would turn out like this
All I ever wanted was to just exist
And be fearless

And down again I've fallen
Through the same
Empty self-inflicted void again
How long can we survive in this cold world

I feel like I've fallen down again
Again
I feel like I've fallen down again
Again

And down again I've fallen
Through the same
Empty self-inflicted void again
How long can we survive in this cold world
