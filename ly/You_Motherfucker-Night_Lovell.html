		  (Killa, haha)
(Man gone, james)

Walking through my thoughts (uh), 'cause I live inside my head (head)
All this money that we got (uh), it ain't change the way we play
Watch me, step in the place (ayy), and I'ma show you how we get (get)
Realest niggas on this side (side), no, we cannot be your friends, ayy, ayy (uh, uh)
Uh, no, we are not alike (alike)
That nigga called you pussy (pussy), but you never put up a fight (a fight)
You try to take my life (life), my niggas is on your block (your block)
You probably work with the cops (the cops), my niggas never got caught
Uh, bitch, okay
I really want that nigga dead (dead)
Twenty bands (uh), forty bands (ayy), put that money on your head (your head)
Never trust no bitch (bitch)
Your bitch probably gon' snitch (snitch)
You niggas know where I live (live), thirteen past six (oh yeah)
Why you on my dick (yeah), try to take my shit? (Shit)
Made that nigga throw a fit (fit), 'cause your shit don't hit (don't hit)
There's nothing else I can say (say), you better find another way (way)
Look you niggas in the face (the face), I can tell that you're all fake (uh, bitch)

It's too much on my mind (mind), all these problems that I find (find)
You can keep on trying (trying), but just know you're not my kind (my kind)
Fuck you from behind (behind), blowing out your fucking spine (your spine)
But I won't make you mine, I'll just pass you to the side, ayy
Aim to kill so I'm loading up this clip
Plus, I got your bitch, on my dick is where she sit (uh)
If I make you mad, you can run into this fist (fist)
'Cause I know you niggas wish (uh), you could do the shit I did, ayy
I've been focused on my sanity, it's crucial (crucial)
If I let that go, I'll just end up in a loophole
Could've sold my soul (yeah), stayed the same, where's my kudos? (Kudos)
Still it's fuck the world (damn), I'm just being truthful (true)
This ain't nothing new, I've been planning since the start (start)
Knew what I'd become since I saw the first spark (spark)
Hate when niggas tell me that they think that this was luck (luck)
You jealous of my ways, bitch, I don't give a fuck (motherfucker)

Bitch
Bitch, I don't give a fuck
Ayy, uh, ayy, okay
