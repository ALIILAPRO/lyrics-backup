		  Game over
Flip, Flip, Flip, Flip
Flip, Flip, Flip, Flip (game over)

Ah shit, y'all done fucked up
And let me in this bitch
I'm just your average hood nigga
With dreams of gettin' rich (but you don't hear me)
My crib big like a football field
You might fuck around and think
I signed a football deal (but you don't hear me)
I take 15 minutes to drop a track (yeah)
I take half a minute to load my gats (but you don't hear me)
I make em bounce all across the globe
I'm a pimp, I got your ho
Takin' off her clothes (but you don't hear me)
A franchise like a Houston Rocket (Houston Rocket)
Every eight months is
When I usually drop it (but you don't hear me)
I got the streets on lock, I like my beats with knock
You know my heat stay cocked, nigga

(Now who they want?)
Flip, Flip, Flip, Flip
(Game over) Flip, Flip, Flip, Flip (now who they want?)

Look, I'm a Cristal nigga and you a red-winer
You just an opening act
But I'm the headliner (But you don't hear me)
I'm about to ship 3 mil off top
You got your deal off your man
I got my deal off props (But you don't hear me)
I'm "Connected" like Dub and Mack 10
With Ice Cubes in my watch
And Dubs on the black Benz (But you don't hear me)
I'm getting paid 'cause I do all the work
It's rainy days if we don't move
All our work, we go berzerk (But you don't hear me)
I'm on the block fam, in the cream drop Lam
Most of y'all cats with deals, y'all ain't hot man (But you don't hear me)
I'm 'bout to do it again, you 'bout to lose it again
It's show and tell motherfucker, I'm a prove it again

(Now who they want?)
Flip, Flip, Flip, Flip
(Game over) Flip, Flip, Flip, Flip (now who they want?)

The game over, cause shit about to change over
It's 'bout time cause hip-hop
Need a make over (But you don't hear me)
If most producers want to charge too much
But around my way that's how
You get fucked up (But you don't hear me)
You might think we all beats and rhymes
But way before this rap shit, nigga
The streets was mine (But you don't hear me)
I got that hot shit, that "Thug Life" 'Pac shit
That get hot shit, that B.I.G. "Ready to Die" shit

(Now who they want?)
Flip, Flip, Flip, Flip
(Game over) Flip, Flip, Flip, Flip (now who they want?)
