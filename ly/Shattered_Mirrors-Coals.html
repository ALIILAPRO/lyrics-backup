		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Anemic mornings enchain me to the bed
They dry my lips and I nibble on them, habitually
I can't eat yet, but in special moments
I can ravage the whole fridge

My mother lied to me
That youth is a gladness
I am only a poor construction of human anxiety

My mother lied to me
That youth is a gladness
I am only a poor construction of human anxiety
Dear God, pull me out of this hell
Dear God, pull me out of this hell
Dear God, pull me out of this hell, of this hell, of this hell

I imprecate when the night starts
Window separates me from the beast
You're not there, but I feel your presence
You were my parasite, I am bursting

My mother lied to me
That youth is a gladness
I am only a poor construction of human anxiety

My mother lied to me
That youth is a gladness
I am only a poor construction of human anxiety

Dear God, pull me out of this hell
Dear God, pull me out of this hell
Dear God, pull me out of this hell, of this hell, of this hell

I have been trying to get up for a few days
To approach the mirror
When I reach for my reflection
A whisper emanates
From behind the glass
"You are nothing, you are nothing"
"You are nothing, you are nothing"

Later I shatter my mirror
I burst again
I hide under the quilt
Bed is my house
