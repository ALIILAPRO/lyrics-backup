		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There is a house in New Orleans
They call it the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin of many a poor girl
And me, oh Lord, I'm one

If I had listened of what my mama said
I'd be at home today
Bein' so young and foolish, my Lord
Let a gambler lead me astray

My mother is a tailor
She sews new blue jeans
And my sweetheart is a drunkard, Lord
Drinks down in New Orleans

Go tell my baby sister
Never do what I have done
Shun that house in New Orleans
They call it the Rising Sun

Goin' back to New Orleans race is almost won
Goin' back to spend my life
Beneath, beneath, beneath, oh Lord
Beneath, oh now, beneath, the rising
Rising sun now, now

Ain't comin' back ain't comin' back
Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, baby
Yeah, come-a back, back, back
Yeah, come-a back yeah, come-a, yeah, come-a
Yeah, come-a back yeah, come-a back
