		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm wicked 
I'm wicked that just means -
Know that shit just explains me, how my mind work
(OhKay)

Chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop
Chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop
Chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop
Chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop

Chopstick make a nigga cha, cha, cha
I can't believe what I just heard the opps outside
Come on bro let's hurry up and make the block hot
"Nardo y'all should let 'em slide," blah, blah, blah

Uh-uh, come on let's go right now
It don't gotta be night time
I pull up with that stick swingin' like I lost my sight, ah
Pour 'round and rounds, they bite, ah
Get hit and see the light, ah
Get hit and it get bright, ah
Get hit you lose your life, ah
Get hit and then you dead, die
See red I got a red eye
We laid him down 'round 9 P.M. 
You would think he had a bedtime
Switch on the Glock, that's fed time
Look Wick ain't got damn mind
Remember me and Ian went on that uh-huh 
I'm trippin' never mind
Get low, tip toe, creep (what all you need?)
Ski mask, chopstick, me (how it go?)
Hopped out, boom-boom, sleep
Come with me and I'll teach you how to work that muhfuckin'

Chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop
Chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop
Chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop
Chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop

Pull up shinin' all my jewelry on (all my fuckin' jewelry on)
We don't got no heart but all us got chrome (all us got that chrome)
We like some fuckin' pillows, everybody touch dome (everybody touch dome)
We like some laxative, we all get shit gone (all us get shit gone)
All us was wearin' masks before that coughin' shit (before that COVID shit)
Been stayin' away from niggas before that COVID hit
Opps don't come out and they blame that Corona shit
But when I catch 'em I got a shot for 'em 
And I ain't talkin' 'bout no vaccine, bitch

Chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop
Chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop
Chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop
Chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop

Chopstick make a nigga cha, cha, cha
I can't believe what I just heard the opps outside
Come on bro let's hurry up and make the block hot
"Nardo y'all should let 'em slide," blah, blah, blah

Chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop
Chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop
Chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop
Chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop
