		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was aiming for the sky,
ended up flat on the ground
But once again the sun is rising,
I better keep on walking
Keep on walking

I have a long road ahead of me
It's cloudy and dark it's hard to see
Will I ever get through to the end?
Been down this sling so many times before
And I told myself I would do it no more
Now I'm back on the same road again

I was aiming for the sky,
ended up flat on the ground
But once again the sun is rising,
I better keep on walking
Keep on walking

I was aiming for the sky,
ended up flat on the ground
But once again the sun is rising,
I better keep on walking
Keep on walking

There's some twists and turns I've gotta clear
But when I'm done the end will soon appear
I can leave my troubles behind

I was aiming for the sky,
ended up flat on the ground
But once again the sun is rising,
I better keep on walking
Keep on walking

I was aiming for the sky,
ended up flat on the ground
But once again the sun is rising,
I better keep on walking
Keep on walking

I never stopped believing
I know what I should do,
just let the light guide me through

I was aiming for the sky,
ended up flat on the ground
But once again the sun is rising,
I better keep on walking
Keep on walking

I was aiming for the sky,
ended up flat on the ground
But once again the sun is rising,
I better keep on walking
Keep on walking

I was aiming for the sky,
ended up flat on the ground
But once again the sun is rising,
I better keep on walking
Keep on walking

I was aiming for the sky,
ended up flat on the ground
But once again the sun is rising,
I better keep on walking
Keep on walking
