		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Broken dreams and cigarettes again and again
Reelin' in my inner thoughts again and again
I just need a head rush again and again
I just need something that's not the same old thing

And in my presence, I can't get enough
An urgent message, I need a head rush
And in my presence, I can't get enough
An urgent message, I need a head rush

Oh, would I love to see the stars from the beaches up on Mars
Would I love to have a day on Neptune, in outer space
I pretend I'm a rocket man, explorin' places I've never been
When I'm caught, don't reel me in, let me go and let me swim
Oh, would I love to see the stars from the beaches up on Mars
Would I love to have a day on Neptune, in outer space
I pretend I'm a rocket man, exploring places I've never been
When I'm caught, don't reel me in, let me go and let me swim
Oh, would I love to see the stars from the beaches up on Mars
Would I love to have a day on Neptune, in outer space

I pretend I'm a rocket man
