		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey hello, I'm making friends with the bugs in my head
we're taking it slow
There's someone playing with me, gotta find the real enemy
And I won't stop until you're down below
I will crash, I will burn, 'til a find a place to call home 

Fear won't make me stay
I need to get away

Ima walk 'til I find my way to paradise
no more talk, I ain't stopping till I get it right
There's no walls in the prison that can hold me down, no
Let's get the fuck out of here

Oh ey Oh, I'm out of here
Oh ey Oh, I'm so out of here
Oh ey Oh, I'm out of here
Oh ey Oh, I'm so out of here

Why, oh why
Does it feel like this road isn't real
There's nowhere to go
Say goodbye
Ima ride to the far end of time
I've had it, For sure
There's something coming for me, gonna let you know what I see
I'm in a place where you are in control
And I am breaking out, I can't live inside your heaven no more

Fear won't make me stay
I need to get away

Ima walk 'til I find my way to paradise
no more talk, I ain't stopping till I get it right
There's no walls in the prison that can hold me down, no
Let's get the fuck out of here

Oh ey Oh, I'm out of here
Oh ey Oh, I'm so out of here
Oh ey Oh, I'm out of here
Oh ey Oh, I'm so out of here


I know there's something better out there
I want a piece of the unknown
I'm on the edge
The next step makes me stronger
Cause I know that I'll never feel alive this way

Ima walk 'til I find my way to paradise
no more talk, I ain't stopping till I get it right
There's no walls in the prison that can hold me down, no
Let's get the fuck out of here

Yeah!
Oh ey Oh, I'm out of here
Oh ey Oh, I'm out of here
Oh ey Oh, I'm out of here
Oh ey Oh, I'm so out of here
Oh ey Oh, I'm out of here
Oh ey Oh, I'm so out of here
