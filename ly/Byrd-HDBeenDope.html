		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Labb, Labb, Labb

Bitch I got problems on
Problems on problems on
Problems on problems on
Problems on i'll solve 'em
I run through the money
The pressure be calling
Left all my blessings
I feel like I'm falling
The birdie is back (Birr)
Tell me I'm garbage
I'm going through something
That's why I ain't calling
Phone in progression it's all that I wanted
A foe in affection i summon and dub it
'Cause bitch I got problems on
Problems on problems on
Problems on problems on
Problems on i'll solve 'em
I run through the money
The pressure be calling left all my blessing
I feel like I'm falling
The birdie is back (Birr)
Tell me I'm garbage
I'm going through something
That's why I ain't calling
Phone in progression it's all that I wanted
A foe in affection i summon and dub it

Why you be all on my line about nothing?
Why won't you go get you
A dollar or something
Don't hang with a nigga who lying for nothing
I see that we're different
You riding, I dub 'em
I don't do discussions on
Bragging 'bout hundreds
Don't go to your places
I know that they're sunken
Don't call me your brother
I barely could trust y'a
I talk to a shorty she bagging or bugging
And I'ma need all of my dollars on corpus
So hand me the money I'll divie the pie
I'ma give all of my people a portion
To build them a fortune on flipping the rye
I can't be mixy when iffy the vibe
And 40 on 50 it's really the time
Why are you all on my phone like you want me?
Like you wasn't pushing the kid to the side
I don't know if you bitches
Is thinking I'm blind
Cross all my crosses and dot all my i's
Done with your efforts
I'm dealing with pressures
I know it's a lesson
That's word to the wise (Labb)
Dubbing the mixers I'm mixing
I know I been missing
I needed some personal time
Fuck all the pictures the mentions
I don't want your digit's i mean it
I'm staying inside

'Cause bitch I got problems on
Problems on problems on
Problems on problems on
Problems on i'll solve em
I run through the money
The pressure be calling left all my blessing
I feel like I'm falling
The birdie is back (Birr)
Tell me I'm garbage
I'm going through something
That's why I ain't calling
Phone in progression it's all that I wanted
A foe in affection i summon and dub it
'Cause bitch I got problems on
Problems on problems on
Problems on problems on
Problems on i'll solve em
I run through the money
The pressure be calling left all my blessing
I feel like I'm falling
The birdie is back (Birr)
Tell me I'm garbage
I'm going through something
That's why I ain't calling
Phone in progression it's all that I wanted
A foe in affection i summon and dub it
