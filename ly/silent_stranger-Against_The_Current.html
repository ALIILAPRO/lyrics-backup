		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Who are you with the lights out? (Lights out)
I don't feel right when I'm all alone
My human natures makes me a stranger
To everyone I know

I know it's all lies
I brought to life
Now I don't know how to be someone real
Hate that I fake the way that I feel

Voices fill my head with noises
Drain me of this poison (poison)
'Cause I'm not who you think I've been
Frozen, I'm someone I don't know and
The cycles never broken (broken)
And I'll die a silent stranger

(But I'm not who you think I've been)

Feels like I'm hiding in my skin (my skin)
I'm such a coward and they all know
I'll never let them see my face
Cover my tracks and run away

I know it's all lies
I brought to life
Now I don't know how to be someone real
Hate that I fake the way that I feel

Voices fill my head with noises
Drain me of this poison (poison)
'Cause I'm not who you think I've been
Frozen, I'm someone I don't know and
The cycles never broken (broken)
And I'll die a silent stranger

(And I'll die a si-, and I'll di-di-di-)
Voices fill my head with noises
Drain me of this poison (poison)
And I'll die a silent stranger

Voices (voices) fill my head with noises (noises)
Drain me of this poison (drain me of this)
(Poison) 'cause I'm not who you think I've been
Frozen (frozen), I'm someone I don't know and
The cycles never broken (know and)
And I'll die a silent stranger
