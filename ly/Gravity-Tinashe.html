		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  First things first, I hope you rollin' up
When we get faded I, I can open up
I've been drownin' in my dreams again
Fooled me once, can't fool me twice
But it'd be nice
I can't decide if I should trust my heart or trust my eyes
It's a fight, I know my worth and we're on a ride
But I'd be satisfied with who you are inside (who you are inside)
So stay here tonight

Keep fallin' into me (ah)
And I'll keep fallin' into you (ah)
When I feel spaces we could fill (ah)
Gravity pulls me down back to you

Hang it up, clothes line
I don't need a cosign
I believe in soul ties
We been here the whole time
And fightin' with my heart and my head over you is a battle, but I'm so tired
What am I to do when I knew I could take 101 to the westside? (Ooh, oh)
The room is gettin' bright
The things I've been ignorin' are all comin' to the light
You could slide, slide
Stick side by
That's my guy
See it, wide eyes, wide eyes

Keep fallin' into me (ah)
And I'll keep fallin' into you (ah)
When I feel spaces we could fill (ah)
Gravity pulls me down back to you

Mm
No
Ooh
Ooh
Pullin' me, pullin' me (no, no)
Pullin' me, pullin' me (no, no)
Pullin' me, pullin' me (no, no)
Pullin' me, pullin' me (no, no)
Pullin' me, pullin' me (no, no)
Pullin' me, pullin' me (no, no)
I think I'm fallin' in love
Pullin' me, pullin' me (no, no)
Pullin' me, pullin' me (no, no)
Pullin' me, pullin' me (no, no)
I think I'm fallin' in love
Pullin' me, pullin' me (no, no)
Pullin' me, pullin' me (no, no)
Pullin' me, pullin' me (no, no)
