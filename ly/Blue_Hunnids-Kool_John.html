		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She gon' shake it for them blue hunnids
She gon' shake it for them blue hunnids
Take her home, she gon' do somethin'
She gon' shake it for them blue hunnids
She gon' shake it for them blue hunnids
She gon' shake it for them blue hunnids
Take her home, she gon' do somethin'
She gon' shake it for them blue hunnids

Everyday I'm countin' blue hunnids
Broke niggas always wanna hold somethin'
She don't smoke, but she gonna roll somethin'
Got a bad bitch, she ready to fuck somethin'
How you get that ass all up in them jeans?
She threw it back, I went deep
How you get that ass all up in them jeans?
She threw it back, I went deep
She made one cheek move, she made the other cheek move
Booty like ooh, tell me what you're tryna do
She made one cheek move, she made the other cheek move
Booty like ooh, tell me what you're tryna do

She gon' shake it for them blue hunnids
She gon' shake it for them blue hunnids
Take her home, she gon' do somethin'
She gon' shake it for them blue hunnids
She gon' shake it for them blue hunnids
She gon' shake it for them blue hunnids
Take her home, she gon' do somethin'
She gon' shake it for them blue hunnids

Yeah, she gon' shake it for them blue hunnids
Come through, she let the crew run it
You ain't gettin' money, you ain't 'bout nothin'
You ain't gettin' money, you ain't 'bout nothin'
I got hella hoes on the internet but I ain't into that
I'm somewhere focused on a bigger check
All the big girls, get loose with it
All the model hoes, let Su hit
She made one cheek move, she made the other cheek move
Booty like ooh, tell me what you're tryna do
She made one cheek move, she made the other cheek move
Booty like ooh, tell me what you're tryna do
Yee!

She gon' shake it for them blue hunnids
She gon' shake it for them blue hunnids
Take her home, she gon' do somethin'
She gon' shake it for them blue hunnids
She gon' shake it for them blue hunnids
She gon' shake it for them blue hunnids
Take her home, she gon' do somethin'
She gon' shake it for them blue hunnids
