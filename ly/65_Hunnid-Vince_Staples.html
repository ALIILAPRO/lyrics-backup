		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Birds and the bees
Come and fuck wit a G
Hot as 65 hunnid degrees
Hard on a ho
Drop your drawers to the floor
Gangsta guy, baby girl get on your knees

65 hunnid degrees
Block been hot 'bout
65 hunnid degrees
Block been hot 'bout
65 hunnid degrees
Block been hot 'bout
65 hunnid degrees
Block been hot 'bout

Runnin' to get to that check, I'm comin'
Jumpin' out of that back seat bussin'
Buss buss missions with the blower as a youngin'
Back when Killa Mo had 'em coppin' Crystal through the prison door
Feel the 4
When I'm feelin' low
Time to stretch a nigga
Ridin' through your section
Shit, I hope you got protection with you
Hop out when the cops out
Shit, I'm cold with my .45, brown rag, green light
Yoda time

Birds and the bees
Come and fuck wit a G
Hot as 65 hunnid degrees
Hard on a ho
Drop your drawers to the floor
Gangsta guy, baby girl get on your knees

You alone
Car full of niggas but you alone
It's time to show how much you love your homies
One nigga outside
Two niggas up inside the store
One nigga gon' die
The other two can come along
Gloves with the disguise
Bang the set before you blow
Don't stop 'til he drop
Don't shoot for the skies or shoot for his toes
I told you before
That niggas gotta die for this shit to survive
Is you wit it or not?
Get to knockin' then
Problem is, lotta niggas scared of the consequence
Common sense missin' from your head when the pressure on
Niggas from my home ain't enrolled in the colleges
Fuck a class, junkies hittin' glass
Get the money long
Gleamin' with the tents and the stash, no tags
Bumpin' on the ave
Gettin' cash until a nigga's gone
And ain't shit wrong with the truth
Got the juice
Woulda threw that nigga bishop off the roof

Birds and the bees
Come and fuck wit a G
Hot as 65 hunnid degrees
Hard on a ho
Drop your drawers to the floor
Gangsta guy, baby girl get on your knees
