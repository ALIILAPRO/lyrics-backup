		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Me and $lick committed seven deadly sins
Again in the 7th Ward in the 7th Ward
Smurf call me up to pick him up
Whenever he got in the 7th Ward
In the 7th Ward
I was out of weed and threw a fit
I must admit it in the 7th Ward
In the 7th Ward
Black $uicide, Southside across the lake
We in the 7th Ward in the 7th Ward

May Satan bless my enemies
You want a verse? It's never free
Don't like me? Well, I can agree
I only speak in blasphemy
Like my bitches watery
Drugs up in my arteries
Don't give a fuck 'bout loyalty
'cause murders in my pedigree
Kill 'em with efficiency
I got no life expectancy
Smoking in the first degree
Backwoods wrap around my tree
I'm everythin' they wanna be
I'm everythin' you're not
May all my haters drop
May all you bitches rot

Me and $lick committed seven deadly sins
Again in the 7th Ward in the 7th Ward
Smurf call me up to pick him up
Whenever he got in the 7th Ward
In the 7th Ward
I was out of weed and threw a fit
I must admit it in the 7th Ward
In the 7th Ward
Black $uicide, Southside across the lake
We in the 7th Ward in the 7th Ward

They be like "Hustle God, can
You become a savior, can you save me?"
Hit that feat for my music, it keep 'em crazy
Take a cab by any means
That's on the daily estate
And you started just for safety, mane
I wake up and hit that scale out of Memphis
Trip back and forth they got
Lighters smoking me out, zips
Know I'm cruisin' with $crim and
Squad on some mob shit
They be alright when I pull up
And cut em up quick nigga

Me and $lick committed seven deadly sins
Again in the 7th Ward in the 7th Ward
Smurf call me up to pick him up
Whenever he got in the 7th Ward
In the 7th Ward
I was out of weed and threw a fit
I must admit it in the 7th Ward
In the 7th Ward
Black $uicide, Southside across the lake
We in the 7th Ward in the 7th Ward
