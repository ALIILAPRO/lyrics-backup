		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We are the dark romantics
The dark romantics in our candle's glow
We are the dark romantics
And our dreams are where the poets go

Go

The photograph child
Holds her head in shame
While the crystal wild
Fears a statue with no name

The velvet touch
Of the warmest mystery
Is where our kind
Welcomes serenity

We are the dark romantics
The dark romantics in our candle's glow
We are the dark romantics
And our dreams are where the poets go

Your eyes are shut
To the world that we hold dear
You mock the way we paint ourselves
You mock our theatre tears

We bow in love
I know the angel's smile
Drinking on emotion
Lighting altar fires

We are the dark romantics
The dark romantics in our candle's glow
We are the dark romantics
And our dreams are where the poets go

Oh, we will be
Impassionate and delicate
Oh, we can see
All that God has given
It's surreal
Surreal

The photograph child
Holds her head in shame
While the crystal wild
Fears a statue with no name

Oh, we are the dark romantics
The dark romantics in our candle's glow
We are the dark romantics
And our dreams are where the poets go

We will be
Impassionate and delicate
Oh, we can see
All that God has given
It's surreal
Oh surreal

We are the dark romantics
The dark romantics in our candle's glow
We are the dark romantics
And our dreams are where the poets go
