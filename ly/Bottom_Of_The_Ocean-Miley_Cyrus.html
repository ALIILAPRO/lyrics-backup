		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's been in the past for awhile
I get a flash and I smile
Am I crazy
Still miss you baby
It was real
It was right
But it burned too hot to survive
All that's left
Is all these ashes

Where does love go
I don't know
When it's all said and done
How could I be losing you forever
After all the time we spent together
I had to know why
I had to lose you
Now you just become
Like everything I'll never find again
At the bottom of the ocean

Do do do, do do do do
Do do do, do do, do
Do do do, do do do, do

In a dream you appear
For awhile you were here
So I keep sleeping
Just to keep you with me
I draw a map
Connect the dots
With all the memories that I got
What I'm missing
I'll keep reliving

Where does love go
I don't know
When it's all said and done
How could I be losing you forever
After all the time we spent together
I had to know why
I had to lose you
Now you just become
Like everything I'll never find again
At the bottom of the ocean

This is it
Let go
Breathe
You don't have to love me for me 
To baby ever understand
Just know I love the time we both had
And I don't ever wanna see you sad
Be happy
And I don't wanna hold you
If you don't wanna tell me
You love me babe
Just know I'm gonna have to walk away
I'll be big enough for the both of us to say
Be happy

Do do do, do do do do (be happy)
Do do do, do do, do (be happy)
Do do do, do do do, do (be happy)

Mmhmm, be happy
