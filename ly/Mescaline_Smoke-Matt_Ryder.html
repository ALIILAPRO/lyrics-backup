		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Smoking outside the party,
Looking around cos your lonely,
Do you see me know?
Im bleeding out.

This rooms too loud,
So, get me out,
Smoke crawling in my lungs,
Blood falling from her tongue,
Chemical dreams on your mind,
And you're feeling the lies.
Oh she cries out,
Then I black out.

Smoking outside the party,
Looking around cos your lonely,
Do you see me know?
Im bleeding out.
Smoke it outside of school now,
Rolling around cos your phased out,
Do you see me now?
Im bleeding out.

I’ll see you round,
She’s on the, chemical compound,
Drop your sound,
She’s sensitive now.
All she wanna do now is take me from the truth now,
She is found and I’m alone now.

Smoking outside the party,
Looking around cos your lonely,
Do you see me know?
Im bleeding out.
 (i’m cold now)
Smoke it outside of school now,
 (on the outside)
Rolling around cos your phased out,
 (get me out now)
Do you see me now?
 (get me out now)
Im bleeding out.

Driving around oh,
Looking for the sun, no,
Take me away,
The place only you know,
If you’re so self assured,
Then show me the way.

Smoking outside the party,
Looking around cos your lonely,
Do you see me know?
Im bleeding out.

Smoke it outside of school now,
Try and feel something, lights out,
He’s tripping out, i’m,
Bleeding out,
Im cold now,
On the outside,
Get me out now,
Get me out now.
