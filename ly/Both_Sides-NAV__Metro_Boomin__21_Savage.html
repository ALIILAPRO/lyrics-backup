		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If Young Metro don't trust ya, I'm gon' shoot ya

Get my Maybach washed at the studio
I'm passing out xans to the groupie hoes
I got five on a Lamb' like Coolio
Multi-million, now I'm hanging with the shooters tho
Yeah, bust downs, got a few of those
Yeah, bitch stop calling my phone up, I'm in the studio
Nigga we ain't doing no Twitter, lil nigga get super soaked
Nigga we ain't playing both sides, lil nigga who you rooting for?

My life is a secret, everything confidential
Rollie Presidential, working on my mental
Ready for the pressure, 38 special
Aiming at your temple, shooters behind me driving in a rental
Told his momma, "Sorry for your loss, did you get the flowers that I sent you"
Used to sell my beats for two bills, now you can't even get a sample
Momma found the work in the closet
I was making shoe box deposits
Ain't looking back, change the topic
Park a Bentley coupe in the projects
Tell my ex bitch, I'm doing great, yah
So much ice, I need some skates, yah
Playing two sides, my shooter put three in his face, yah
I just spent eleven on my waist, yah
I dress like a star, my closet running out of space, yah

Get my Maybach washed at the studio
I'm passing out xans to the groupie hoes
I got five on a Lamb' like Coolio
Multi-million, now I'm hanging with the shooters tho
Yeah, bust downs, got a few of those
Yeah, bitch stop calling my phone up, I'm in the studio
Nigga we ain't doing no Twitter, lil nigga get super soaked
Nigga we ain't playing both sides, lil nigga who you rooting for?

Woah, Gucci jacket, inside pocket, hold the ratchet
OG Kush I'm smoking on a potent package
Saint Lauren diamond on my me
And I got a gun on me
Can't no infiltrators come around me
Told my son don't suck his thumb around me
Issa lotta bloodhounds around me
You can get gunned down around me
Yeah, all my friends bad guys
Search him at the door, he might be wearing a wire
In a foreign, drinking syrup, that's a DUI
Police ass nigga you the FBI

Get my Maybach washed at the studio
I'm passing out xans to the groupie hoes
I got five on a Lamb' like Coolio
Multi-million, now I'm hanging with the shooters tho
Yeah, bust downs, got a few of those
Yeah, bitch stop calling my phone up, I'm in the studio
Nigga we ain't doing no Twitter, lil nigga get super soaked
Nigga we ain't playing both sides, lil nigga who you rooting for?

I'm sleeping, where the killers at?
Yeah, I'm hanging on a fed block
Yeah, Glock 40 with a red dot
Yeah, ten racks for a headshot
