		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do you know how lucky I feel I am
To find a man who loves me as I am
Never tried to change a single part of me
You're easy to love
With those qualities
And every day you teach me more and more
Inside me I'm all aglow
And every night you think of only me
OOh you keep me satisfied
You do all the things I like
I want your
Oh I want your soul
Do you want it right now
Or can I let go?
I want you so bad
Give me all you have
I can show you how
Do you want it right now
Right now Right Now Right Now
I got to know
I want to know
I got to know
Do you want it want it right now babe
Show you how if you want it right now
Do you want it want it right now babe
Got it here if you want it right now
Do you want it
Everyday
Do you want it
Everyday
