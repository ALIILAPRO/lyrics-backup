		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh, yeah
I didn't wanna listen to what you were sayin'
I thought that I knew all I need to know
I didn't realize that somewhere inside me
I knew you were right but I couldn't say so

I can take care of myself, yeah, you taught me well

I learned from you that I do not crumble
I learned that strength is something you choose
All of the reasons to keep on believin'
There's no question, that's a lesson, that I learned from you

We always don't agree on
What is the best way
To get to the place that we're going from here
But I can really trust you, and give you the distance
To make your decisions without any fear

I'm grateful for all of the times
You opened my eyes

I learned from you that I do not crumble
I learned that strength is something you choose
All of the reasons to keep on believin'
There's no question, that's a lesson
I learned from you

You taught me to stand on my own

And I thank you for that

You saved me, you made me,
And now that I'm looking back

I can say

Whoa!

Hmm, hmm, yeah!

I learned from you that

I learned from you

I do not crumble
I learned that strength is something you choose

Something you choose

All of the reasons to keep on believin',

Keep on believin'

There's no question, that's a lesson that I learned from you

Whoa!
I learned from you

I learned that strength is something you choose
Something you choose

All of the reasons to keep on believin',
There's no question, that's a lesson that I learned from you

Yeah!

I learned from you
