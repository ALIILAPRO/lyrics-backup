		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I asked your boss for your number
I never wondered which way you would go
You woke me up from my slumber
Now let me make you work slow
It's not a lot, but all I want to do
Is skip town on a weekend with you
There's still so much to discover
There's still a lot we don't know

Come alive (come alive, come alive) 
Give it up, girl before you lose your mind
Come alive (I can tell if you realize, I can tell)
They got you under pressure, doing overtime

Come alive (come alive) 
Give it up, girl before you lose your mind
Come alive (I can tell if you realize, I can tell)
They got you under pressure, doing overtime

You're working double just to have a life
I like to think that it's just a phase
Treading anything that takes your time
Seconds pass and you're on your way
Help me understand what you need
Help me figure out what isn't right
Consider swimming if you start to sink
Or you could get left behind

Come alive (come alive, come alive) 
Give it up, girl before you lose your mind
Come alive (I can tell if you realize, I can tell)
They got you under pressure, doing overtime

Come alive (come alive, come alive) 
Give it up, girl before you lose your mind
Come alive (I can tell if you realize, I can tell)
They got you under pressure, doing overtime

The night shift
The day shift
We could go anywhere and they won't say shit
I wish I could lay you down right now on the kitchen floor
'Cause we got something so real
However they feel doesn't really matter no more
So let's see you walk up out of that door

Come alive (come alive, come alive) 
Give it up, girl before you lose your mind
Come alive (I can tell if you realize, I can tell)
They got you under pressure, doing overtime

Come alive (come alive, come alive) 
Give it up, girl before you lose your mind
Come alive (I can tell if you realize, I can tell)
They got you under pressure, doing overtime

Come alive (come alive, come alive) 
Come alive 
Come alive (I can tell if you realize, I can tell)
Come alive, come alive (come alive)
Come alive
Come alive, come alive (I can tell if you realize, I can tell)
Come alive
