		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is your day, love
This is the day that you can't get away
I been waiting all day, love (I been waitin' on ya)
Waiting for your embrace, love (hello, love)
This is the day, love (everybody's searching for you)
Every prayer that I prayed, feelings I can't escape
(Everywhere there's pain, we been missin' ya)
It's so hard to explain, love (we need you more than ever before)
Still it's a beautiful day, love (I know I do)
It's a beautiful day

See I admit, I didn't know much
Much about love, the way it was supposed to be
I was born into a world so cold
How I could I forget (let's go)
The many dark days
The times I felt betrayed, by the ones that were supposed to love me
It's the only kind of love I've known (truth is)

That's the reason why a love that's born to die is so hard to believe
(You don't throw me away)
So maybe I'll take a chance and try love (but promise me)
Don't say goodbye love (c'mon)

This is your day love
This is the day that you can't get away
I been waiting all day love (it's so good to see you)
Waiting for your embrace love (hello, love)
This is the day love
Every prayer that I prayed, feelings I can't escape
It's so hard to explain love (you're like a mystery)
Still it's a beautiful day love (yeah, talk to 'em)
It's a beautiful day

See I admit today's kinda love ain't the same kinda love
This one leaves you feeling empty (ha, you can keep that mid love)
I don't wanna be let down again

Been around the world and I-I-I, know it's going crazy
I cried so many nights and I-I-I, need someone to save me
No greater love or sacrifice (nothing like that)
Love on the cross you paid the price (thank you)
That's why I trust you with my life, and I take the chance and try love (please)
Don't say goodbye love

This is your day love
This is the day that you can't get away
I been waiting all day love (I've been waiting my whole life)
Waiting for your embrace love (I'm not gon' let you go this time)
This is the day love (you see, love isn't love)
Every prayer that I prayed, feelings I can't escape (until you give it away)
It's so hard to explain love (find somebody)
Still it's a beautiful day love (and love somebody)
It's a beautiful day

If I didn't get it right yesterday
You've given me a chance to try love again (yes, it's a beautiful day)
And even though life didn't start out easy
That's not the way it has to end (yes, it's a beautiful day)
See, I learned love's not the enemy
But I had to look deep down within (it's gonna be a beautiful day)
For God so loved the world
Now let's let real love begin

My love never disappears
My love
Like always, everyday, feel this love

Get out and touch somebody
Love somebody
Hold somebody
Get out and touch somebody
Love somebody
Hold somebody
Get out and touch somebody
Love somebody
Hold somebody
Don't you know that you just may be the only Jesus that they see

Get out and touch somebody
Love somebody
Hold somebody
Get out and touch somebody
Love somebody
Hold somebody
Get out and touch somebody
Love somebody
Hold somebody
Don't you know that you just may be the only Jesus that they see

Get out and touch somebody

My love never disappears
My love, loves to draw you near
Forget every scar and fears

Like always everyday feel this love that I made for you
