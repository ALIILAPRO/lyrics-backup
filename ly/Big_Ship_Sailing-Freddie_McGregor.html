		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sailing, sailing, sailing

Say when I'm ready you must hold on steady
We're moving off at lightening speed, yeah
Take a seat and wait 'till I'm ready
I'm coming so hold on steady, yeah

Big ship sailing on the ocean
We don't need no commotion
Big ship sailing on the ocean
Big ship sailing on the ocean
Big ship sailing on the ocean

There's a time when the sea gets rough
The wind is blowing and the fishes keep movin'
What are you doing mister man
Sit down hold on tight, get ready 'cause youre sailing

Big ship sailing on the ocean
We don't need no commotion
Big ship sailing on the ocean
Get ready 'cause we're moving
Big ship sailing on the ocean
Big ship sailing on the ocean

Say when I'm ready you must hold on steady
We're moving off at lightening speed, yeah
Take a seat and wait 'till I'm ready
I'm coming so hold on steady, 'cause

Big ship sailing on the ocean
We don't need no commotion
Big ship sailing on the ocean
We got to come over
Say we're sailing on the ocean

Say there's a time when the sea gets rough
The wind is blowing and the fishes keep movin'
What are you doing mister man
Sit down hold on tight, get ready 'cause youre sailing

Big ship sailing on the ocean
We don't need no commotion
Big ship sailing on the ocean
We got to come over
Big ship sailing on the ocean
Big ship sailing on the ocean
