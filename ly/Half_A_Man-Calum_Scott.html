		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You made me
Feel like we're seventeen
Like in those movie scenes
Where they fall in love
And what I'd do
To always wake up with you
Closer than a tattoo
On your skin

I got caught in the moment
But nobody told me
You'd bring me to my knees
You're all that I want
And I need you to see

That you make my heart beat
You are the air that my lungs need
You know the language my soul speaks
That nobody else understands
Oh, when you found me
Lost, all alone, I was empty
But you came along and you saved me
You make me all that I am
Without you I'm half a man
Ooh

Promise me
That you'll never change a thing
There's nobody quite the same
As you

Let's stay here in the moment
And never be found
'Cause you bring me to my knees
You're all that I want
And I need you to see

That you make my heart beat
You are the air that my lungs need
You know the language my soul speaks
That nobody else understands
Oh, when you found me
Lost, all alone, I was empty
But you came along and you saved me
You make me all that I am
Without you I'm half a man
Without you I'm half a man
Without you I'm a half a man
Without you I'm a half a man

'Cause you make my heart beat
You are the air that my lungs need
You know the language my soul speaks
And you make me all that I am
And without you I'm half a man
