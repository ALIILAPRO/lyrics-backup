		  (Rio)
Bur gang, leave a nigga cold
(What's happening TT?)

It ain't my business, it ain't my beef, I ain't on no side
Y'all got guns and we got guns but we don't post ours
Look, you poppin' like the giant, he just 4'5"
Told him hit 'em in the leg and make them niggas your size
These niggas gon' end up dead, they keep on playin' both sides
These niggas gon' end up dead, they keep on playin' both sides
They gon' need a lot of black suits, a bunch of bowties
They gon' need a lot of black suits, a bunch of bowties

I made it from the skreets, it ain't no mercy on these skreets
It's hot as mercury, these boys'll merk you on these skreets
These bitches double dutch so quick to jump in nigga's sheets
Got niggas slick, competin' with niggas I ain't even competin'
If you talk behind my back no need to dap me when you see me
'Cause I ain't gon' shed no tear when they pick you up off the cement
A real dope boy, I make it flood in any season
While rappers goin' broke and blame corona as the reason
I showed some niggas kindness, they mistook that I was weak
I told them I was stackin', they just thought that I was cheap
If I took it, I was mad, I still ain't finna give it back
No oops, my bad, consider that shit as a tax
So buy some Stacy Adams and a couple ties to match
This MAC came with a shoulder scrap, the only thing retract
4PF and 1017, 4 ties, we flat
And we ain't with that pity-pat shit, we ra-ta-ta-tat

It ain't my business, it ain't my beef, I ain't on no side
Y'all got guns and we got guns but we don't post ours
Look, you poppin' like the giant, he just 4'5"
Told him hit 'em in the leg and make them niggas your size
These niggas gon' end up dead, they keep on playin' both sides
These niggas gon' end up dead, they keep on playin' both sides
They gon' need a lot of black suits, a bunch of bowties
They gon' need a lot of black suits, a bunch of bowties

Doin' songs for Gucci Mane, now I done ran them stupid bands up
Make no stupid, shoot your mans up, it's a robbery, put your hands up
The see me, they switch the channel, I'm the real deal, Atlanta
Ain't no monkeys in the middle, play both sides, you get dismantle
Tuck my shit, I got my hammer, fuck that bitch, ain't got no manners
Can't hit that shit, that's not my standard
She caught my drift, she like me grandma
I keep me a dirty Fanta, ridin' 'round in this dirty Phantom
I'm 'bout gettin' business and I ain't sendin' no worries at 'em
I ain't with no chitter-chatter, keep a bad one
Her ass fatter than the last one
We be takin' shit, no askin', we be breakin' bricks out plastic
Everybody lit, go ask, I be in the 'Vette, the fast one
And I got the CA, you don't wanna see bae

It ain't my business, it ain't my beef, I ain't on no side
Y'all got guns and we got guns but we don't post ours
Look, you poppin' like the giant, he just 4'5"
Told him hit 'em in the leg and make them niggas your size
These niggas gon' end up dead, they keep on playin' both sides
These niggas gon' end up dead, they keep on playin' both sides
They gon' need a lot of black suits, a bunch of bowties
They gon' need a lot of black suits, a bunch of bowties
