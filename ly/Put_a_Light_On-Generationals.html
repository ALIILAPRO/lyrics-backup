		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This one wicked road
You're gonna make it right 
You found your way to go 
You gonna take that right

You're gonna wait too long
You're gonna wait till night
You're gonna wait too long
You're gonna wait till night

Was that the thing you heard? 
Was that the thing you said? 
I try to find the way 
Then maybe walk away! 

The miles are way too long 
The skies are way too bright 
You know them way too long 
To run away tonight! 

Don't need to fall 
The way that you go on tonight 
'Cause the light on me and my blue skies playing
The light on me and my blue skies playing

The sun will make them dry 
The sun will make them dry 
The sun will make them dry 
The sun will make them dry 

This one wicked road
You gonna make it right 
You found your way to go 
You gonna take that right

You're gonna wait too long
You're gonna wait till night
You're gonna wait too long
You're gonna wait till night
