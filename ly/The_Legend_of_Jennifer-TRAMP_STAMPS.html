		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There’s a story of a girl with a demon in her body
A long, brown hair soul-sucking kind of hottie
Got a movie star mouth
Chew you up, spit you out
She’s the reason people say what goes around comes around

When the lights go out, you’re home alone
Remember that I told you so
She wears hell better than clothes
And always gets revenge

Watch out don't look
She's your nightmare of a dream
Go home run fast if you don’t 
She’ll eat your heart out of your chest
Got your insides on her dress
Blood's her favorite shade of red
Say your prayers and go to bed

Jennifer Jennifer
Jennifer Jennifer

There's a story of a boy who was way too into virgins
Instead of looking inward, he sacrificed a person
You could say it went wrong, I would say it went right
'Cause the world's a better place with every single bite

Do something when she says don't
Remember that I told you so
She’ll get right down to the bone
And always gets revenge

Watch out don't look
She's your nightmare of a dream
Go home run fast if you don’t 
She’ll eat your heart out of your chest
Got your insides on her dress
Blood's her favorite shade of red
Say your prayers and go to bed

Jennifer Jennifer
Jennifer Jennifer


There’s a story of a girl with a demon in her body
A long, brown hair soul sucking kind of hottie
