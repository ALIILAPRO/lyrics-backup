		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, uh

Niggas talkin' smack about God, I bring the devil to him
I put some young niggas on, I know that'll do it
Just 'cause I birthed you don't mean I won't hurt you (uh)
And I ain't breakin' a sweat, it's not worth you (nah)
Ain't messin' up the brand for you dumb fucks
Niggas goin' broke betting cribs on these niggas you can't trust (at all)
You think you're threatin' me? You can't, swaak
Lies, you tellin' stories, man, you sound Like Nhlanhla Lux (haha)
Nigga don't tempt me, your tank on empty
I'm still hood in this two-tone Bentley (see me?)
I came with a message
Boy, your ancestors sent me to tell you that you can't fuck with Nyovesti (uh)
Look at all the bullshit I survived
When I pull up, it looks like a minister arrived
It's just black tuxedo, Clyde and Oskido (woo)
I mean you got fans but you ain't fuckin' with me though (nah)
It ain't the same
Dude, I came and I changed rules
And she ain't never hanged with us if she still faithful (haha)
Y'all see me though, I'm really go-realer (that's facts)
But it's easier to say we all fill-up (right?)
If life was a movie and I'd give it a title
I'd call it - Material: The Serial Killer (uh)
We all victims of this fuckin' system (it's fucked up)
Got a better chance if you with him (that's facts)
I cracked the code
I got it but I'm back fo' more
Tweezy, let's run it back, let's go (uh)

We just fly private, baby, we be in the clouds (uh)
They be poppin' Molly just to feel like they are gods
I know that they see me, they just scared to show me love (uh)
This ain't Balmain baby, this is Balmain

This ain't Balmain baby, this is Balmain
This ain't Balmain baby, this is Balmain
This ain't Balmain baby, this is Balmain
This ain't Balmain baby, this is Balmain

Nigga, I came at the back of a van
I don't like y'all, it's hard to pretend
But it's mutual, so fede voetsek
I'm the one y'all wanna ridicule? (Uh)
She wanna poke a man it's easy for me to pick and choo-
It's the move that got these fickle dudes touched
I know my daddy proud 'cause he livin' through us
Mama was a teacher, daddy became a principal
We smoke it on the island and sell it like it's medicinal
Big body Benz, I can talk to all you little dudes
I'm dead serious, I am living proof
That when you put the work in
Everything works out
Get fly all day, and then I bring the birds out
I pay all the bills, my lady don't bring her purse out
Damn, they used to love a nigga but they hurt now
It's too much
Your lady will get chewed up
I'm opening a new club
Everyday is some new bucks
A new truck, assumang
La bowa, ra di chuna
We grindin' and we suit up
Bo buda, magowa (ooh-ooh, ah)

We just fly private, baby, we be in the clouds
They be poppin' Molly just to feel like they are gods
We just fly private, baby, we be in the clouds
They be poppin' Molly just to feel like they are gods
I know that they see me, they just scared to show me love
This ain't Balmain baby, this is Balmain
I know that they see me, they just scared to show me love
This ain't Balmain baby, this is Balmain

This ain't Balmain baby, this is Balmain
This ain't Balmain baby, this is Balmain
This ain't Balmain baby, this is Balmain
This ain't Balmain baby, this is Balmain
