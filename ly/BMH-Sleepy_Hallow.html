		<p>
		  Haha, hold on
Hold on, hold on
(Great John on the beat, by the way) hold on, hold on

Look, please don't blow my high right now (right now)
I'm somewhere in the sky right now, you could die right now
You was always not around, huh, look (facts)
Now I'm up, I was down, wanna fuck with me now
Say what's up to me now, huh (wait, wait)
I guess it's up to me now, guess it's, look, huh

Like fuck it, I'm done with them (I'm done)
Can't put trust in none of 'em, look (in none)
Get popped like a Perc' or somethin'
Shawty wanna give me top like a shirt or somethin', huh (ah, wait, hold on)
Who the boys? We ain't heard of them (we ain't heard)
They ain't really spinnin' blocks, they ain't murder nothin', uh (they spinnin')
Throw shots to your turb' or somethin'
Pull up, post up on the curb or somethin', look (post up, post up)
I'm drippin' like water, Fiji (Fiji)
Sleepy did it, now they thinkin' it's easy, huh (drip, drip)
They said they love me (love it), need me
I'll go broke and I could bet you they leave me, huh (they outty)
But fuck it, I'm back on the road (I'm back)
You know Sleepy gotta go (gotta go)
Lil' bro been wildin', he just wanna pour
Hit a lick and split the tolls, huh
Hit a lick and let me know (let me know, let me know)
Catch an opp and it's a score, huh (it's a score)
It ain't shit to let it blow, huh (let me know, let me know, let me know)
It ain't shit to let it blow (hold on, hold on)

Look, please don't blow my high right now (wait, whoa)
I'm somewhere in the sky right now, you could die right now (hold on, hold on)
You was always not around (never), huh, look (hold on)
Now I'm up, I was down, wanna fuck with me now (whoa, whoa, wait)
Say what's up to me now, huh (hold on, ha)
I guess it's up to me now, guess it's, look, huh (wait, haha, hold on)

I guess it's up to you, gang, huh (what?)
Fuck niggas can't hang, look (uh-huh)
Sit your five-dollar ass down 
A billi' gon' make change (b-b-b-b-boom)
Back out, bro slidin' in a Range, huh (skrrt)
Fuck her, I don't know her name, huh (skrrt)
I don't love her, she for gang, huh (no love)
Better stay up in your lane, look 
The plug named Carlito, huh (whoa, whoa)
If he got them cards, he let me know
I'm in the trap with bro (that's a fact)
Back then, we ain't have no clothes (no clothes)
Now we cash out, all facts for gold
Hold on, better watch your hoe (better watch her)
Lil' bitch tryna take my soul
Better pipe down, better watch your tone
Don't text, don't call my phone (whoa, whoa)
Only one thing that I think you should know, like (hold on)
Don't text, don't call my phone
Only one thing that I think you should know

Look, please don't blow my high right now (wait, whoa)
I'm somewhere in the sky right now, you could die right now (hold on, hold on)
You was always not around (never), huh, look (hold on)
Now I'm up, I was down, wanna fuck with me now (whoa, whoa, wait)
Say what's up to me now, huh (hold on, ha)
I guess it's up to me now, guess it's, look, huh (wait, haha, hold on, whoa)
