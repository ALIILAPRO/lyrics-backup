		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Somebody pinch me now, me think me dreaming
You fuck a gyal and now she breeding
Yuh too insecure, you up inna yuh feelings
A weh you mean you a leave me?

Weh you expect me fi do? (Stay)
Me woulda do anything fi you (so stay)
Ooh, baby, I'm sure ('bout wah?)
Me cyaan' do this anymore

Yo, me shouldn't fuck her (so why you dweet then?)
Me shoulda lowe her (fuck di gyal and now she breeding)
Me lose such a good woman fi a one night stand
(Well, me nah come back, no)
Yo, me shouldn't fuck her (fuck her)
Me shoulda lowe her (lowe her)
Me lose such a good woman fi a one night stand

Fuck love, me can't do it 'cause you're 
Toxic and me nuh deserve this
You take me from a situation I was hurt in
It's funny how you turn around a do di same thing
I'm a real girl, so I'm a real things
All the money and the bling, baby, it don't mean a thing
You're innocent
You can keep the diamonds and the ring
Cah fi mi love nuh cost a thing
See when you a leave out, when you sneak out
You a tell me you a sleep out, you a sleep out
Me give you mi heart and you abuse it, use it
Say you lose it, fuck you and yuh bitch, my nigga, deuces

'Cause if me stay it nah go be an easy fare
Me stay you a go sneeze 'til you 'wake 
Why man love cheat? Dem gwan like a di least (least)
And if me lef', you know you cyaan' eat, cyaan' sleep 
You a say you shouldn't fuck her

Yo, me shouldn't fuck her (so why you dweet then?)
Me shoulda lowe her (fuck di gyal and now she breeding)
Me lose such a good woman fi a one night stand
(Well, me nah come back, no)
Yo, me shouldn't fuck her (fuck her)
Me shoulda lowe her (lowe her)
Me lose such a good woman fi a one night stand

Pull up inna yuh yaard, inna di crown 
Don't leave me alone 
Now tell me how the fuck you find out?
And me love you and you know
Tired fi quarrel 
How much time me a go tell you sorry? 
Me a di worst tears from mi eyes
'Cause me know yuh hurt

Yo, me shouldn't fuck her (so why you dweet then?)
Me shoulda lowe her (fuck di gyal and now she breeding)
Me lose such a good woman fi a one night stand
(Well, me nah come back, no)
Yo, me shouldn't fuck her (me shouldn't fuck her)
Me shoulda lowe her (lowe her)
Me lose such a good woman fi a one night stand

Yeah, yeah, weh yuh phone deh pon?
You nah hear me a call you?
'Mount a time me call you, enuh?
Reminiscing how you just give me your heart
And me bruk it regardless
You nuh see di phone a ring?
