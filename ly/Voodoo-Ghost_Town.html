		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I hate the way your making me act around your friends,
And the way you keep saying you won't let me in.
Now I'm starving for your attention.
While your begging for my affection.

And my habit of crawling in your bed at night,
Is leading you to thinking that this is for life.
But I'm starving for your attention.
While your begging for my affection.

Suffering is easy with a villain like me.
Now your contemplating leaving but you can't escape the,
Thoughts of what they told you would happen in the end.
Now I bet your really wishing that we had never met.

I'm thinking back to when we met in that ghost town,
and how it felt to be held and never let down.
My lifeless touch was just touch that you were waiting for.
My evil ways were always there, Just couldn't see before.

Tear me limb from limb.
I'm just a voodoo doll.
Stick a needle in my eye,
So I can finally cry.
So I can finally cry.

Now I feel the pain of your lighter's flame burning at my feet.
You make it hard to sleep.
Got another plan, gonna make me suffer till I lose my mind.
Gonna make me feel it till you take my life.
You got an evil mind.
I taught you just in time.

Tear me limb from limb.
I'm just a voodoo doll.
Stick a needle in my eye,
So I can finally cry.
So I can finally cry.

Tear me limb from limb.
I'm just a voodoo doll.
Stick a needle in my eye,
So I can finally cry.
So I can finally cry.

My lifeless touch was just touch that you were waiting for.
My evil ways were always there, Just couldn't see before.
Got another plan, gonna make me suffer till I lose my mind.
Gonna make me feel it till you take my life.
You got an evil mind.
I taught you just in time.
You scream, "You're finally mine."
But babe I'm still alive.

Tear me limb from limb.
I'm just a voodoo doll.
Stick a needle in my eye,
So I can finally cry.
So I can finally cry.

Tear me limb from limb.
I'm just a voodoo doll.
Stick a needle in my eye,
So I can finally cry.
So I can finally cry.
