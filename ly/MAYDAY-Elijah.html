		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah I feel fine, just living the dream
Spending all my time relaxing on the edge of my seat
I never don't mind, but if you're asking me
There's no honesty
Because honestly
I haven't been myself that I've know lately
(Is this who I am?)
So sick and tired of fucking faking
(When I'm breaking down)
Mayday I'm calling
Somebody save me now
Mayday I'm falling
I gotta find a way out
The sinking surrounds me
I scream but I'm drowning
Mayday I'm calling
Somebody save me
I'm going down
I take it all back, just forget what I said
I don't sleep but there's no reason to get up outta bed
It's my last act, but I don't wanna admit
I'm lost in my head
Stuck in my head
I haven't been myself that I've know lately
(Is this who I am?)
So sick and tired of fucking faking
(When I'm breaking down)
Mayday I'm calling
Somebody save me now
Mayday I'm falling
I gotta find a way out
The sinking surrounds me
I scream but I'm drowning
Mayday I'm calling
Somebody save me
I'm going down
The only thing I know right now
Is there's no happy ending
In my head I scream so loud
But I swear no one can hear me
The only thing I know right now
Is there's no happy ending
In my head I scream so loud
I need someone to save me
Mayday I'm calling
Somebody save me now
Mayday I'm falling
I gotta find a way out
The sinking surrounds me
I scream but I'm drowning
Mayday I'm calling
Somebody save me
I'm going down
I'm breaking down
