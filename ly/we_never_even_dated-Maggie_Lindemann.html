		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Holding on to moments that are no longer mine
Swear I'm not crying, there's just something in my eye
Loving you is hard, but I know loving me is harder
Wish we had a little longer

Said your girlfriend hates me 'cause she knows how you felt
Does she know I'm jealous? Hoped that you'll never tell her
That I looked at you with hearts in my eyes
Would you be surprised?

So I'll delete your number, pretend you don't exist
Tell myself it's nothing, when we both know it is
If you ever call me to tell me you want me then I'll tell you too
Mmh, I'll be waiting for you

I still keep your sweater at the back of my drawer
I put it on when my heart needs moral support
Missing you is hard but I hope missing me's harder
Does the distance makes us fonder?

Tell your girlfriend that I hate her too
'Cause you never looked at me, the way that you did her
When you're showing hearts in your eyes
Why am I so surprised?

So I'll delete your number, pretend you don't exist
Tell myself it's nothing, when we both know it is
If you ever call me to tell me you want me then I'll tell you too
Mmh, I'll be waiting for you, I'll be waiting for you

I'll be waiting for you, I'll be waiting for you
I'm still waiting for you
