		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been
Trying to ignite it
But I can't fucking fight it
Anymore
I live
Ain't ready to die yet
Dancing till the night ends
I belong
So decrepit
Like a broken record
My soul eclectic
I'm prone to wreckage
I'm alive with a vibe
And they can't suppress it
Go for the neck
And I'm tempted to end it
My mind is insidious
I've been envisioning
Killing the sin in it
Reaching for peace
And sleep with the innocent
Under the sheet of deceit
Where I'm living in
This is imprisonment, isn't it?
The pain is limited
Faith is infinite
Straying away from the illness
Look at the sickness the pills did
Life is a gift
Here to uplift
Everything else is a trivial blip
This ain't a glitch
This is a vibe
I know I belong
I'm still alive
I've been
Trying to ignite it
But I can't fucking fight it anymore
I live
Ain't ready to die yet
Dancing till the night ends
I belong
I've been
Like a star
Burning up in flames
Cause we are
We are
Grateful we're alive today
I've been
Trying to ignite it
But I can't fucking fight it anymore
I live
Ain't ready to die yet
Dancing till the night ends
I belong
