		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Any nigga couldn't sit in my chair
Yeah it's on nigga, this is my year
I done ran through all this fly gear
Louboutin shoes more than five pairs
You don't like me, what the fuck do I care?
I get money what the fuck do I care?
I was posted on the block where
Try to rob and you get shot there
I'm a monster, I'm a goblin
I go hard and I'ma rock it
I spent thirteen on the wallet 
just a black card in the wallet
Fuck a car key push to start it
Thought I told y'all I'm an artist
Got a baddie in the valley 
out in Cali pushing gardens

Can't fuck with the extra shit
Every time I go out it's an extra bitch
Tryna get in my bed to have sex and shit
I just wanted some head like the exorcist
I got ninety-nine problems and messages
Don't be asking me why I won't text you bitch
Wrap your legs around me like we wrestling
Get on your knees don't you be so damn hesitant
When I get your body I'ma be alright
And when I get a 'Rari you can be inside it
I'ma get another one and let you drive it
Baecation for an extra night
And I won't tell nobody all your secrets 
I can keep a secret girl, I know you need somebody
And I really need somebody
So tell me you're that somebody, girl

I think I might be too late but I'm sorry
I'm sorry baby, but you should thank me
Appreciate me, congratulate me
I got money I don't need to stress a bitch

I got ninety-nine problems and messages
I got ninety-nine problems and messages
I got ninety-nine problems and messages
I got ninety-nine problems and messages (I got ninety-nine problems and messages)
I got ninety-nine problems and messages (I got ninety-nine problems and messages)
I got ninety-nine problems and messages (I got ninety-nine problems and messages)
I got ninety-nine problems and messages (I got ninety-nine problems and messages)
I got ninety-nine problems and messages (I got ninety-nine problems)

I got twenty-one questions for you that I wanna know
Would you make me look stupid?
I'm really feeling the way that you moving
I just wanna know if you finna come through tonight
I can promise you that I'ma do you right
You gon' wish you can go back and do it twice
I can pick you up in an Uber ride
Get high on the way to a flight
Would you ride for me? Would you lie for me?
When you come around good vibes with me
I rock with you, do you rock with me?
I swear other bitches do not get me
Don't be scared baby this is my city
But just in case I keep a 0.9 with me
I was hoping you can grind with me
It gets lonely on this side baby
But can you stay the fuck off my Instagram?
I don't know why my phone's always in your hand
Baby I try to get you to understand 
mind your business you know I'm a businessman
I'ma give you the time of day when I can
Took a minute for me to be who I am
My finesse I can turn a five to a ten
I been travelling they don't know where I am, but

I think I might be too late but I'm sorry
I'm sorry baby, but you should thank me
Appreciate me, congratulate me
I got money I don't need to stress a bitch

I got ninety-nine problems and messages
I got ninety-nine problems and messages
I got ninety-nine problems and messages
I got ninety-nine problems and messages (I got ninety-nine problems and messages)
I got ninety-nine problems and messages (I got ninety-nine problems and messages)
I got ninety-nine problems and messages (I got ninety-nine problems and messages)
I got ninety-nine problems and messages (I got ninety-nine problems and messages)
I got ninety-nine problems and messages (I got ninety-nine problems)

(I got ninety-nine problems and messages)
(I got ninety-nine problems and messages)
