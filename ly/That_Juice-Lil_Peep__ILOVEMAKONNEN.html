		  (I'm a punk star, bitch)

I keep that juice, she keep that juice
She keep that too, she, me, and you
Look at my roof, I got no roof
She in that mood, she, me, and you
I keep that juice, she keep that juice
She keep that too, she, me, and you
Look at my roof, I got no roof
She in that mood, she, me, and you, yeah

Yeah, she gon' roll with the crew
I'ma roll 'bout two, ayy
We rollin' on beans
Fuckin' with the whole team, ayy, yeah
That juice got us drunk
I'm high, smell like skunk
That gas what we pass
Police mad, kiss my ass
'Cause I'm out here, stay ridin'
God damnit, I'm flyin'
I feel like a motherfuckin'
Sailboat in the ocean, way I keep going
In these motherfuckin' waves, ayy
I just like to fucking party all night,
And spend my day at the raves
'Cause I'm so fly
Ayy, and I'm so high, ayy
And you feel it too
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy

I keep that juice, she keep that juice
She keep that too, she, me, and you
Look at my roof, I got no roof
She in that mood, she, me, and you
I keep that juice, she keep that juice
She keep that too, she, me, and you
Look at my roof, I got no roof
She in that mood, she, me, and you, yeah
