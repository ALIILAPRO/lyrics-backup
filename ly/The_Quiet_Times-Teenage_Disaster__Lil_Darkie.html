		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everything's falling apart (yungspoiler)
Everything's falling apart

And I can't stand this silence
It's getting far too hard to cope this time
And I tried i won't survive, no

Ripped each others throats out till
The sun comes up again
Drinkin' and drivin' and I won't
Survive in this world
Told you I'm over this shit
(I'm over this shit, yeah) swap to the left
(The left) and forget I
Existed (Forget I existed)
Tried to cut her off, but she persisted
I guess I gotta hide like I used to
I don't mind the quiet times
But the walls are closing in
I can't feel myself within
And I'm losing everything

And I can't stand this silence (Woo)
It's getting far too hard to cope this time
And I tried (And I tried)
I won't survive, no (Ha)
It's getting far too hard to cope this time
And I tried

And I can't stand this silence
It's getting far too hard to cope this time
And I tried (And I tried)
I won't survive, no

I don't mind the quiet times anymore
(yungspoiler) yeah

Waking with the daylight
Thank God the sun come up again
Drinkin' and drivin'
You will not survive in this world
There's no way over this shit
(No way over this shit)
Won't turn to my left
(My left) and forget you
Existed (Forget you existed)
I won't give you love and stay persistent
I guess I'll do what's right
Like I used to do
I don't mind the loudest noise
'cause it's all from within
It has to end if it began (yeah)
We have all of everything

And I can't stand this silence (Woo)
It's getting far too hard to cope this time
And I tried (And I tried)
I won't survive, no

(Spider Gang)
