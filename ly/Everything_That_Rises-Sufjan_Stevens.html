		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can you lift me up to a higher place?
Forget everything that was before
Turn your face around like the salted sphere
Turn yourself around to see what once was there

Everything that rises must converge
Everything that rises in a word
Everything that rises must converge
Everything that rises

Jesus, lift me up to a higher plane
To a higher plane
Can you come around before I go insane?
Before I go insane?
Cast me not in hell where the demons rage
Where the demons rage
Turn yourself around to see what I can save
To see what I can save

Everything that rises must converge
Everything that rises in a word
Everything that rises must converge
Everything that rises

Turn yourself away from the wickedness, I said
Evil comes to play in the image of the dead

Everything rises, must converge
Everything rises in a word
Everything rises, must converge
Everything rises

Everything rises, everything rises
Everything rises, everything rises
Everything rises, everything rises
