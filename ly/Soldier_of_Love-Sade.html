		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've lost the use of my heart
But I'm still alive
Still looking for the life
The endless pool on the other side
It's a wild, wild west
I'm doing my best

I'm at the borderline of my faith
I'm at the hinterland of my devotion
In the front line of this battle of mine
But I'm still alive

I'm a soldier of love
Every day and night
I'm a soldier of love
All the days of my life

I've been torn up inside (oh)
I've been left behind (oh)
Tall I ride
I have the will to survive

In the wild, wild west
Trying my hardest
Doing my best
To stay alive

I am love's soldier

I wait for the sound (oh, oh)

I know that love will come (that love will come)
Turn it all around

I'm a soldier of love
Every day and night
I'm a soldier of love
All the days of my life

I am lost but I don't doubt, oh
Tall I ride, I have the will to survive
In the wild, wild west
Trying my hardest
Doing my best
To stay alive

I am love's soldier

I wait for the sound
I know that love will come
I know that love will come
Turn it all around

I'm a soldier of love
I'm a soldier
Still wait for love to come
Turn it all around
Still wait for love to come
Turn it all around
Still wait for love to come
Turn it all around
Still wait for love to come
Turn it all around

I'm a soldier of love
I'm a soldier

Still wait for love to come
Turn it all around
Still wait for love to come
Turn it all around
Still wait for love to come
Turn it all around
Still wait for love to come
