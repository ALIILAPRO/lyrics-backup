		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You say you want love, babe
You say you can give it to me just how I, yeah, I need
And you think of roses and daisies
And I think of passion and fire like Hades
You say all the time, peace and quiet
But for my love, I need a riot, a riot

I hope you'll capture my drift
I said, "I need a riot"
I don't want no sinking ship

But I need better than the typical
"Honey, I'm home" shit
Why we can't be making love?
Are you tired of this?

Said that you'd be working late
For the third time this week
Watch your love go astray
'Cause our love's too routine
Too routine

Love's too routine
Love's too routine
Too routine
