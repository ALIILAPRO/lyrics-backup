		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Across the miles, it's funny to me
How far you are but how near you seem to be
I could talk all night just to hear you breath
I could spend my life just living this dream
You're all I'll ever need

You give me strength
You give me hope
You give me someone to love, someone to hold
When I'm in your arms, I need you to know
I've never been, never been
This close

With all the loves I used to know
I kept my distance, I never let go
But in your arms I know I'm safe
'Cause I've never been held and I've never been kissed
in this way
You're all I'll ever need, you're all I'll ever need 

You give me strength
You give me hope
You give me someone to love, someone to hold
When I'm in your arms, I need you to know
I've never been, never been
This close

Close enough to see it's true
Close enough to trust in you
Closer now than any words can say

And when, when I'm in your arms, I need you to know
I've never been, I've never been
This close

You give me strength
You give me hope
You give me someone to love, someone to hold
When I'm in your arms, I need you to know
I've never been, I've never been
This close
