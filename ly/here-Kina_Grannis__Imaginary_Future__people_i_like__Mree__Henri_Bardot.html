		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was on the couch looking out
When I pictured you there
And the palms of your hands
They were in my hair
And you told me
Don't worry just be here
Stretched out on the floor
Looking crooked at the door
Where I saw you off
Tried to make out your face from the parking lot
Thought I'd know what to say
But I could hardly talk
Something that you said
When you sat me on the bed
Broke my heart
If there's a hell you were there
Trying just to walk
But the time was the only thing standing
It's more than a handful
Blinded I try to be helpful
But I don't know if i can do this without you
Feels like a lot's going wrong
Woke up in the night to a song that reminded me of
The long winding one that you used to hum
And you were there for a moment
You were there for a moment
It's more than a handful
Blinded I try to be helpful
But I don't know if I can do this without you
Feels like a lot's going wrong
Lying in silence
It feels like you're here with me hiding
And I thought that I knew how to find you
But sometimes your mind lets you down
