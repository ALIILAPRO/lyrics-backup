		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Quiet day, outside
No wrong, no right
Some men will fight, some die
Some live by the night and some by the sword of the samurai
Wild west, no law
Hot Sun, quick guns
Put a bullet through a mothafucka'
It gets done
Some live by the pipe and some by the sword of the samurai

If you the son of your family, commit harakiri
Loud music in my headphones, I'm hard of hearing
I'm walking through the desert and my skin start peeling
Some people spend their life ignoring their own heart's feelings
I'm watching Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke
I used to listen to C418 and early Coldplay
I think today will be a good day, like I was O'Shea
I make eggs with toast and bacon and a cup of OJ
I'm slaying demons, I feel like I am Inosuke
Life's a game, so is switch, but I really don't play
They told me I would never make it, that there could be no way
I told my mama what I'm making, all she said was, "No way!"
I'm in Italy enjoying gelato and sorbet
This shit it take you a year to do, it might take me four days
I'm going all around the country, we got lots of tour days
Pop out if you a hater, lemme see the look on your face

Brown boy is flying (Brown boy is flying)
Brown boy is flying (That brown boy is flying again)
Brown boy is flying (Brown boy is flying)
Brown boy is flying (That brown boy is flying again)

Q-Q-Quiet day, outside
No wrong, no right
Some men will fight, some die
Some live by the night and some by the sword of the samurai
W-W-Wild west, no law
Hot Sun, quick guns
Put a bullet through a mothafucka'
It gets done
Some live by the pipe and some by the sword of the samurai
