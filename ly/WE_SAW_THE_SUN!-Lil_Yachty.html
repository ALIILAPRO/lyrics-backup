		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Whoa
Sun coming out and I still feel numb
In the dark my secrets hide, I run
A few more drops upon your tongue
A night to remember that can't be undone

Head spun, meanwhile you're done
Had a little too much fun
I cannot stop touching you
This just took my high to the moon

It don't get no better
Moments like this reveal the truth
Alone with only you
Take a picture 'cause we'll need proof
Nobody will believe we saw the sun
If this don't work out, remember all we've done
Ooh

It don't get no better
Take a picture, 'cause we'll need proof
Nobody will believe we saw the sun
If it don't work out, remember what we've done

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Just let your imagination run wild
Let your heart be your guide
And the time you sat around worrying about it and trying to plan out painting
You could have completed a painting already
Let it happen
Let it happen
And I would spend sometimes weeks 
Just working on a picture, drawing it out 
Getting all the little sketches and stuff
And then I'd go back and spend maybe a month trying to fill in the blocks
And here we let it happen, it comes from up here
It's in you, and you put it on the canvas, okay?
Let's see
