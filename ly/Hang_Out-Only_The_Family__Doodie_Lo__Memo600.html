		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bitch I'm street, real and I keep my steal
'Cause niggas try to kill since I signed that deal
They wanna trust me pull up on they block with all these Glocks and it get messy
12 get on this car bitch I'ma stretch out they won't catch me

They won't arrest me (uh)
I get loco with this 4-0
Shoot a fuck nigga brain
He cant hang out
He ain't gang how
Fuck nigga get stained
Fuck nigga get banged
Reach for my chain

He can't hang out he a lame he a hoe
Had the bread for my bro he pillow talking to these hoes
Tuck your chain now 'cause my shawty he on go
In the trenches pouring fours smoking sour with my woes

We can bang out if a lame drop a load
We don't hang with the folks, Got the P's for the low
Jewelry bling blow bitch my chain it'll glow
Think I'm a lame I'ma blow and my youngins on go

You can't hang with me if you ain't never caught a body
I was trapping since a youngin getting money was a hobby
Lil' bro just got a stick with a glizzy it got a switch on it
Put some money on your head and them killas they gonna sit on you

Fuck nigga, ain't got shit on me
Fuck you, and your big homie
Never lacking, keep them sticks on me
Your brother grave, I'll spit on it
He can't hang around he a fan he ain't gang
Get the fuck from 'round me you a pussy you a stain
(Gang)

He can't hang out he a lame he a hoe
Had the bread for my bro he pillow talking to these hoes
Tuck your chain now 'cause my shawty he on go
In the trenches pouring fours smoking sour with my woes

We can bang out if a lame drop a load
We don't hang with the folks got the P's for the low
Jewelry bling blow bitch my chain it'll glow
Think I'm a lame I'ma blow and my youngins on go
