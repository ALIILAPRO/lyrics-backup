		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You say that you don't like them
But I see you all the time
I peep shit, it's so unfair the things you do

You say that you don't like them
But I see you all the time
I peep shit, it's so unfair the things you do

But I see you all the time the things you do
But I see you all the time the things you do
But I see you all the time the things you do
But I see you all the time the things you do

You say that you don't like them
But I see you all the time
I peep shit, it's so unfair the things you do

But I see you all the time the things you do
But I see you all the time the things you do
But I see you all the time the things you do
But I see you all the time the things you do

You say that you don't like them
But I see you all the time
I peep shit, it's so unfair the things you do
