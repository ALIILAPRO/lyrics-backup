		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hit me, uh
Two times, uh 

Redhead Kingpin, Tim Dog, have you seen 'em?
Kwame, King Tee or King Sun
Super Lover Cee, Casanova Rud
Antoinette, Rob Base never showin' up

You see Black Sheep, Group Home, Busy Bee?
Ask L'll and Al Skratch, 'Where My Homies?'
Leave it to y'all, these niggaz left for dead
Last week my man swore he saw Special Ed

Rap is like a ghost town, real mystic
Like these folks never existed
They the reason that rap became addictive
Play they CD or wax and get lifted

I recommend when your kid turn ten
Let him hear Spice 1, made plenty noise
Positive K, Father MC, the Skinny Boys
Where are they now?

Hey, where are, where are they now, hey
Where are they now?
Hey hit me, where are they now?
Hit me

See I remember them forever, the original Spinderella
Lakim Shabazz, 9 Double M
Fu-Schnickens, Buckshot, Finesse, and Sequence
Who was a Rappin' Duke, da-ha, silk tie and leather was cute

Body and soul was Dee from Pump It Up's group
Oaktown 357, J.J. Fad too
Had pop hits and gold ropes
Where my man Young MC and Tone Loc?

Kris Kross, the BO$$, Divine Styler
Def Jef of course let's break it down ta
Mic Geronimo, Pharcyde and Coolio
I heard Craig Mack back in the studio

Have you seen these lost MC's?
Funky Four Plus One, Force M.D.'s
Miss Melody, I hope she packin' a bankroll
As well as educated rap for ice and Kangol

Shante, she from around my way yo
EPMD, K-Solo, where are they now?

Hey, where are, where are they now, hey
Where are they now?
Hey hit me, where are they now?
QB, hit me

First off this ain't no diss record
This for some of my homies that were misrepresented
Legends of the game, y'know?
What up to Moe Dee the legend? Rest in peace Cowboy, yeah

All the rappers, male, female, DJ's, e'rybody
Rest in peace Jam-Master Jay, the whole crew, word up
Juice Crew All-Stars, MC Shan, Tragedy, Craig G
Yeah, nigga, yeah, nigga

Shan whaddup baby?
Where are they now?
