		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mmm, baby, I don't understand this 
You're changing, I can't stand it
My heart can't take this damage 
And the way I feel, can't stand it 

Mmm, baby, I don't understand this 
Girl, you're making it hard for me 
Girl, you're making it hard for me 
Girl, you're making it hard for me, 
Baby, I don't understand
						
Girl, you're making it hard for me 
Girl, you're making it hard for me 
Girl, you're making it hard for me
						
Mmm, baby, I don't understand this 
You're changing, I can't stand it
My heart can't take this damage 
And the way I feel, can't stand it 
Mmm, baby, I don't understand this 

Girl, you're making it hard for me 
Girl, you're making it hard for me 
Girl, you're making it hard for me
Baby, I don't understand 					
Girl, you're making it hard for me 
Girl, you're making it hard for me 
Girl, you're making it hard for me
