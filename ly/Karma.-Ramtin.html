		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Gofti pashimoonet misham inam haghighate
Taghsire salighame, maleh maneh
[You said I would regret you and this is true
Blame it on my taste, it belongs to me]

By the day
Or by the night
Say my name, I'll be by your side
Do me wrong, I'll still do you right
You turned against me and it's suicide

Karma Chameleon
It's always been you and I
And girl it's still you and I 
Faded I'm sippin' strong
Nights when you stared in my eyes
And said you want this for life

Now I'm going Karma Chameleon
Faded I'm sippin' strong
The coupe got no ceilings, huh?
And I got no feelings, nah 
These demons deceive you, huh?
A Machiavellian
It's always been you and I
And girl it's still you and I

Gofti pashimoonet misham inam haghighate
Agar delet dige aroom nashe vazifate
Harchi khasti behet dadam gofti bazam kame
Taghsire salighame, maleh maneh
[You said I would regret you and this is true
If your heart never heals, it's what you deserve
I gave you everything you wanted and you said it's still not enough
Blame it on my taste, it belongs to me]

Girl by the day I'm your Superman
In the night I'm your Romeo
I thought you were my Lois Lane
Kryptonite to my heart of gold
Now you're dealing with all the pain
Of the life that you had before
So tell me a hundred lies
I could tell you a hundred more

Karma's a ceiling fan
Got my enemies ducking low
With my bro's out in SOHO
We stacking Bills like it's Buffalo
Got no gimmicks for promo
You know I'm way too original
I don't do subliminals
I go where my feelings go

Karma Chameleon
It's always been you and I
And girl it's still you and I 
Faded I'm sippin' strong
Nights when you stared in my eyes
And said you want this for life

Now I'm going Karma Chameleon
Faded I'm sipping strong
The coupe got no ceilings, huh?
I got no feelings, nah 
These demons deceive you, huh?
A Machiavellian
It's always been you and I
And girl it's still you and I 

By the day
Or by the night
Say my name, I'll be by your side
Do me wrong, I'll still do you right
You turned against me and it's suicide

I thought you
Knew better
I'm praying that you
Do better
Forever
Don't you tell me it's whatever

Gofti pashimoonet misham inam haghighate
Harchi khasti behet dadam gofti bazam kame
Taghsire salighame, maleh maneh
[You said I would regret you and this is true
I gave you everything you wanted and you said it's still not enough
Blame it on my taste, it belongs to me]
