		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh, yeah, yeah
You know how we pulling up
(It's JoeFromYO)
Yeah
(Elo on the beat)

You know how we pulling up
We might not be big, but you can't fight no bullets, so don't try to bully us
Fuck around and catch a headshot, red dot
Hit 'em up
And even with my eyes closed now, I see how they don't fuck with us
But, fuck it, you know me, you know I'm gon' to run it up
Plus I'm gon' double up, up, up
I used to be regular, now I'm a young nigga stackin' my Benji's up, up, up
They call me a singer, I'm rapping with melodies, nigga, like, na, na, na, na, na
And I'm a bread winner, yeah, nigga, so I'm stacking my cheddar up, up, up
You know how we pulling up, yeah, nigga, you know how we

Give it up
I swear nigga, you a dead, dead nigga, you tried to set me up
Niggas be scared, they go to the feds and they start to singing, na, na, na
Be careful with these rat niggas out here actin' like they with you, nah, nah, nah
It's only my niggas, we get high nigga, smokin' la-la-la, la-la
Some fly niggas and we always gon' keep it a 100 like 95 plus 5
I know many men wishin' death up on me, niggas is tryna take my life
So I keep a friend with a F&N, that nigga always by my side

You know how we pulling up, yeah, nigga, you know how we pulling up
We might not be big, but you can't fight no bullets, so don't try to bully us
Fuck around and catch a headshot, red dot
Hit 'em up
And even with my eyes closed now, I see how they don't fuck with us
But, fuck it, you know me, you know I'm gon' to run it up
Plus I'm gon' double up, up, up
I used to be regular, now I'm a young nigga stackin' my Benji's up, up, up
They call me a singer, I'm rapping with melodies, nigga, like, na, na, na, na, na
And I'm a bread winner, yeah, nigga, so I'm stacking my cheddar up, up, up
You know how we pulling up, yeah, nigga, you know how we

Huh, yeah, you know how we pulling up
Back to back in foreigns, when I start the engine, I push a button
Still reminiscing them days people said I wouldn't be good, nah
Had my head down, now I hop in the Wraith and see stars when I'm lookin' up
And I dare a nigga try bully us (bully us)
Got a choppa with big bullets if he thinkin' he big and tough
I'm with Boogie, my hoodie up (hoodie up)
I go 7:30 with this 30 off Perky's, I'm booted up
Run up, I'm shootin' somethin'
Glock 19, with a beam, make a move and I prove a point
Hop out that Urus truck
Know we coming with the nineteen whenever we hit the club, yeah

We pulling up
We might not be big, but you can't fight no bullets, so don't try to bully us
Fuck around and catch a headshot, red dot
Hit 'em up
And even with my eyes closed now, I see how they don't fuck with us
But, fuck it, you know me, you know I'm gon' to run it up
Plus I'm gon' double up, up, up
I used to be regular, now I'm a young nigga stackin' my Benji's up, up, up
They call me a singer, I'm rapping with melodies, nigga, like, na, na, na, na, na
And I'm a bread winner, yeah, nigga, so I'm stacking my cheddar up, up, up
You know how we pulling up, yeah, nigga, you know how we
