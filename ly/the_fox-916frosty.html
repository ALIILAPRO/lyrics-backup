		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  916frosty woah, okay, woah, let's go
Woah, it's on, woah, we on
Woahh, it's party time, let's go
I'm on it, the army 916,  the army
The army, the army yeah, yeah,  yeah, yeah

Let the army attack (Gerreaux, turn it up) 
Don't mean to be mean
You fuckin' around, that ain't what I need
I talked to the fox, he said, "Follow me"
I'm lookin' around, like, how could it be?
I'm covered in ash, I'm covered in spleens
What the fuck does it mean?
I sat with the fox, he told me
"Don't leave"

Ayy, I came back like boomerang
I make it clear likе Blu ray (Like Blu ray)
My wifey turn to Two-Face (Yеah)
She tryin' to take my blue face
I need my baby badly
I still walk in these alleys (yeah)
Losing track, don't keep tally
When I'm alone, I'm happy
Sippin' on Wock, and I'm drownin' today
Sippin' on Wock, and I wither away
I'm with the fox, and
I'm runnin' and gunnin'
And fuckin' on baddest bitches out of state
(yeah) i'm with the foxes, not the hounds
I'm out in LA, Chinatown
Why they still looking me at me and my crown?
Why they still waiting on my fall down?

Let the army attack, don't mean to be mean
You fuckin' around, that ain't what I need
(Help)
I talked to the fox, he said, "Follow me"
I'm lookin' around
(Help) , like, how could it be?
I'm covered in ash, I'm covered in spleens
(Help) what the fuck does it mean?
I sat with the fox (I sat with the fox)

Ooh, ooh (Oh oh) turn around, turn around
Before you leave (Oh, woah)
Is this the game you want to play
When you're dealing with me?
(Hey, you, get your damn hands off her)
Woaah, woah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Drop a hit, they come back
I'm the Pied Piper
Got a friend that's a fox
But he's not Swiper and I met a southern
Sweetie straight from Carolina (Ooh ooh)
I ain't like the way she taste
So I don't pipe her
Why my girl a vampire but I didn't bite her?
Let her party her own, everybody pipe her
How you thought we were in love?
It was just a cycle
When she see me after midnight
It's an all-nighter
Get ready for your classtime
Leaders of the new school (Ayy)
Bitch, I said it if I meant it
That's a new rule (Woah)
Why these Internet artists be thinkin'
That they're too cool? (Oh, woah)
Stepping out (Oh, woaah)
E-boy flexing on the 'Gram, got no value
Stop earning motherfucking racks
Don't know how to
Ex-bitch keep on coming back
(Oh, woah) , she my pal too
Pull up to our spot
Reminiscing when I had you
Had you, trashed you
Nothing like the past you
People gon' grow and change, but to me
You're stuck like tattoo (Tattoo)
If I knew what you was gonna do
I would have stabbed you
I just met a fox, and he told me
"Don't tell around you"
I know a lot about you kids, but you doubt me
Lot of racks inside the bank
That's just what I need
Cannot lie 'bout the fakes
Everything I seen i promise, one day
I'ma make you feel this pain (What?)
Yeah, and I don't know where to be, no
Yeah, where you really want to be, girl?
'Cause I don't wanna let you
Go to where there's demons (Oh)
Now you tell me you don't want to be my BB
(O oh) 'Cause you won't want me 'til you
Know you're gonna need me (Woah)
Ran out of rations, all I hear is
"Can you feed me?"
(Swear to fucking God, let's show these
People how we do this shit
916 way for life) woah, oh, oh, yeah
Yeahh

Time to go to bed (scorpio)
It's a lot to handle, babe
So we'll take things from the road
'Cause we're living in a plastic dream
They made us fiend for it
