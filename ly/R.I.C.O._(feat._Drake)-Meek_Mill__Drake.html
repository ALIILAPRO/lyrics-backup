		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, views, views, views
Yeah, yeah, alright

Old ways, new women, gotta keep a balance
The girl of your dreams to me is probably not a challenge
I've been counted out so many times, I couldn't count it
Funny how now my accountant is havin' trouble tryna count it
To the people that think that I owe you shit
Payback's a bitch and you know that shit
Y'all niggas gettin' too old for this
Please don't think nobody notices
I've been up for way too many days
Y'all sleep enough for me anyway
Y'all don't be doin' shit anyway
Y'all are not true to this anyway
OVO, East End, Reps Up, we might just get hit with the R.I.C.O
Everyone home for the summer, so let's not do nothing illegal
I go make fifty million and I give some millions to my people
They gon' go Tony Montana and cop them some Shaq at the free throws
But they're from the 'Way fam, there's not much to say fam
They told me to tell you, you mans are some wastemans
And stay in your place fam
My dad is from Memphis, and I am the king
I should probably just move into Graceland
Madonna's a ting I know and I'm the king of pop
I'm building Never-Never Land
How he hate me when I never met the man? Woo

We might just get hit with the R.I.C.O

Meek Milly
'Cause we in the field with them birds like we play for the Eagles
I'm on probation so let me not talk what's illegal (switch it up)
Today I woke up with my dream girl, she rich as a Beatle
For my teachers that said I won't make it here
I spend a day what you make a year
I had to drop this to make it clear
That I got it locked like Jamaican hair
All theses choppers poppin', niggas wildin', violence
Why we even gotta take it here?
Why we even gotta play these games?
Run up on me, catch a facial there
It's the Chasers, what you thought?
I come through my block like I'm Rico
Poppin' a wheelie, no squealie, can't talk to the cops, that's illegal
I was like more a Rich Porter, no double-crossing on my peoples
I take an M to the table and split it with my niggas equal
I'm back on that hood shit, yeah, that wish you would shit
I'm talking that cross you, that fade you fourth quarter
Like Jordan, we back on that bullshit
We came up from nothing
We started on list's most wanted but now it's the Forbes list
We really was doing shit
I can hear echoes from feds on this beat from informants
I think they recording
Shh-shh-shh, listen, you hear that?

We might just get hit with the R.I.C.O
We might just get hit with the R.I.C.O
