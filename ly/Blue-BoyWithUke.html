		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I like everything that's blue
Like the color of my room
But almost every day
The skies are colored grey
I do the best that I can do
I like everything that's blue
Like when her eyes shine like the moon
Like a slap against my face, I love the aftertaste
I've got nothing left to lose

The ocean says that I can go wherever, but it lies
I tried so hard to be myself despite this weather
We're up all night 'cause we don't like the treasure
That we find, I'll write the wrongs that wrote to get us back together

I-I-I-I, I-I
I tried so hard to be myself despite this weather
I-I-I-I, I-I
I tried so hard to be myself despite this weather

I like everything that's blue
Like the TV when it's news
I'm trying not to rest, but I'm lying on my bed
With myself inflated bruise
I like everyth-, wait

I'll keep you from my heart, far away from harm
Got teeth along my arms when I hold you
I'll keep you in the dark, where I don't know where you are
It's so hard, but I have to
So run away from me, I'm not what you see
Tearing down the lights in my bedroom
It's better if I'm blind and I don't know where to find you

The ocean says that I can go wherever, but it lies
I tried so hard to be myself despite this weather
We're up all night 'cause we don't like the treasure
That we find, I'll write the wrongs that wrote to get us back together

I-I-I-I, I-I
I tried so hard to be myself despite this weather
I-I-I-I, I-I
I tried so hard to be myself despite this weather

Blue
If only I had thought it through
I'm running out of breath, and it seems as if you're deaf
I liked everything with you
