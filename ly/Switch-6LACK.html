		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm thinking 'bout a Yamaha (ay)
I'm thinking 'bout a Yamaha
To get away from all the cameras
I'm over it, don't wanna fantasize
Fate is 'round the corner right (Fate is 'round the corner right)
It hit me right between the eyes (Hit me right between the eyes)
It's funny when they switch and pick a side
Ain't nobody gotta go through what I'm going through, no
But it seems like they all know what I'm supposed to do so
Let switch bodies for a day
You could me be and I could be you
Juggle the pile of shit that's bound to come through
You can have it since it's automatic

Now switch (switch)
Tell me how it feels (feels)
To be somebody else (else)
Now switch (switch)
It wasn't what you thought it was (was)
Another story to tell

Well, well
Well, well, well, well
Well, well, well, well
Well, well
Well, well, well
Well, well, well, well
Well, well

So tell me lies, tell me lies, tell me lies
You and I rather die, you and I
Entertain these other bitches and now we're not
Entertain these other niggas should know that
If I give you my heart, would you hold that?
Would you put it on safe or would you fold that?
If I find out you cheating then just know that
I'ma kill you and that hoe, ain't no going back
That what she told me and how could I blame her?
A small town girl, now she all famous (switch)
Maybe it's my fault now, ain't like I've been livin' in the dark now
I told you everything from the start
And you the one who had a change of heart
Girl, you can have it after all the damage

Now switch (switch)
Tell me how it feels (feels)
To be somebody else (else)
Now switch (switch)
It wasn't what you thought it was (was)
Another story to tell

Well, well
Well, well, well, well
Well, well, well, well
Well, well
Well, well, well
Well, well, well, well
Well, well

I'm thinking I should speed it up
And get away from all the media
I'm human, don't you think I had enough?
My women claiming that I switched on her
Only 'cause I hit a switch on her
She wasn't really good at keeping up
