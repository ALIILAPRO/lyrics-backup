		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know that I will love again
I'll meet someone and we'll make amends
I'm sure she'll be a gentleman
And I will be content

I know that I will be fulfilled
See the world and pay my bills
Have a drink and eat my fill
Of dinners and free will

But if you come to me
In my home with my three kids
If you asked me to leave
To be with you and split
Well, I'd at least have to think about it

You never love the same amount
But you spent a week at my mother's house
And honest, I can tell you now
I love you more than my future spouse

And if you come to me
When I've promised to commit
If you told me that you loved me
And asked me for a kiss
Well, I'd at least have to think about it

You are my Achilles heel 
The weakness only I can feel
I've been a liar and you've been a pill
But I'd still have to think about it

Things just won't be the same
And I'm scared to death 
That I'll scream your name
And still, there's not a thing that I'd change
And that's okay, when I think about it
