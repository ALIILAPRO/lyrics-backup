		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  True love is hard to find
I need you by my side
'Cause everything's alright 
When I hold you through the night
You caught me by surprise
Was searching my whole life
Let's give it a try

I realize I don't want to wait
I know that that's a lot to say
I'm grateful now we're not alone
I know you're busy everyday
I need you with me anyway
I wonder, how far can we go?

I'll love you 'til I don't exist here anymore
You're what I'm looking for
We can make it work for sure
I'll love you 'til I don't exist here anymore
You're my one and only

You make me feel less lonely
Every time you hold me
You got my heart exploding
You're my one and only

I realize I don't want to wait
I know that that's a lot to say
I'm grateful now we're not alone
I know you're busy everyday
I need you with me anyway
I wonder, how far can we go?

I'll love you 'til I don't, exist here anymore
You're what I'm looking for
We can make it work for sure
I'll love you 'til I don't exist here anymore
You're my one and only
