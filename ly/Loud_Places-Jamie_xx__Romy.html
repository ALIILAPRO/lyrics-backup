		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I go to loud places to search for someone
To be quiet with who will take me home
You go to loud places to find someone who
Will take you higher than I took you
Didn't I take you to higher places you can't reach without me?
Reach without me?

I feel music in your heights
I have never reached such heights

I go to those places where we used to go
They seem so quiet now
I'm here, all alone
You go to new places with I don't know who
And I don't know how to follow you

Higher
I take you higher and I'll take you
Didn't I take you higher?
I take you higher
I take you higher and I take you
Didn't I take you higher?
Didn't I take you to higher places you can't reach without me?
Reach without me

I feel music in your heights
I have never reached such heights
Oh
I feel music in your heights
I have never reached such heights

I feel music in your heights
I have never reached such heights
You're in ecstasy without me
When you come down
I won't be around
