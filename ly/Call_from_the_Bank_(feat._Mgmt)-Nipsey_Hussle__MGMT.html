		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh
Uh

Look 
Just got a call from my bank
To tell me that we hit again, and keep doin' my thing
The boys on fire, money wires everyday
It's a natural known fact I'm the hottest in LA
It's All Money In, that's all I gotta say
Got 'em reppin' down in Diego, Las Vegas to the Bay
Even on the east they never hesitate
They shoutin' out my words from the crowd towards the stage
And you know I'm gettin' paid 
Yeah, you know I'm gettin' paid, paid

Look 
Marathon life it's all about the pace
Lot of niggas runnin' sprints but they never win the race
You don't see me at the shop, I'm probably outta state
In my fly hotel workin' on my mixtape
Standin' on the couches later on that day
Champagne, models pourin' bottles on their face
The S is for success and that's why I love the hate
They mad 'cause I can, and I'm happy 'cause they can't
Yeah, I'm happy 'cause they can't
Uh, it's that feel good, you know

Shout out to my enemies 
Shout out to the fact's we the ones that they pretend to be
Rappers with their gangbang identity
But imitation is the highest form of humility
Then my phone rang, it was Killa B
Thats a bad bitch, plus she get her cheese
Know I'm feelin' her, I know she feelin' me
But we don't even fuck, we do some different things
Take her to the turf, she trynna take me to her church
Just be yourself, that's the only way to make it work
Sweet Sadie, drop top Mercedes
Blowin' that Obama with some old school, playin'
PCH, switchin' lane feels amazin'
Life is everythin' that I said I would make it
Love my niggas, so bread I'm gon' break it
Twenty racks, fifty racks, hunnid racks, run it back
If that ain't fly Crippin', what the fuck is that?
Type of life I'm livin' you know nothin' bout
Gotta fly first class if you wanna talk
Louie on the duffle bag pick a airport
We can be there tonight baby therefore

You know, I gotta say, the motherfuckin' marathon continues
Uh, uh, uh, yeah, yeah
Late night, top off 
Her hair blowin' in the wind, nigga smokin' on that good
Feelin' oh so hood, yeah, told you, yeah, this is volume one
Aight, Hussle, motherfucker 
Hey, Ralo (Ralo)
Yeah, yeah
Hey
Yo
