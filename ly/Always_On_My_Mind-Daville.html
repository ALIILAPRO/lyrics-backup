		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm thinking about you
Girl, oh, I miss you
Baby, ever since that day you went away
I can't live without you

You're always on my mind
You're always on my mind
You're always on my mind
Girl, you're on my mind

I gave you all of me
And now you're not here with me
Nothing will ever change
My love for you remains the same
I can't wait to see you again

You're always on my mind
You're always on my mind
You're always on my mind
Girl, you're on my mind

If I don't see you today
I hope I see you tomorrow
Girl, I gotta let you know how I feel
This love is real and I don't wanna fool myself
It belongs to you and no one else

You're always on my mind
You're always on my mind
You're always on my mind
Girl, you're on my mind

Yeah, you're on my mind
You're always on my mind
Girl, you're on my mind
You're always on my mind

Yeah you're on my mind
You're always on my mind
Girl you're on my mind
Always on my mind
