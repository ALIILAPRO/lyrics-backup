		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (I can feel it) (happening) (I can feel it) (happening) (I can feel it)
Can't go with the flow, got to make waves
Even though, I look at the sand and I'm just one grain
But my intuition says there's a bigger mission
I must embrace
So I'm, I'm pushing my thoughts to a new place

I'm kicking and screaming, 'cause it won't be easy
To break all the patterns
If I'm not evolving, I'm just another rumor
Taking up oxygen

It's something bigger than me
I can feel it beginning
Something bigger than me
Yeah, I can feel it opening

Try to ignore it, but it keeps on growing out of control
It's something bigger than me
I can feel it happening

So I'll speak my truth
Though my voice shakes
Try to summon the strength
To look fear in the face

But I'm kicking and screaming, 'cause it won't be easy
To break all the patterns
If I'm not evolving, I'm just another rumor
Taking up oxygen

It's something bigger than me
I can feel it beginning
Something bigger than me
Look, I can feel it opening

Try to ignore it, but it keeps on growing out of control
It's something bigger than me
I can feel it happening (happening)

(Oh I can feel it) (happening) (I can feel it) (happening) (I can feel it)

It's something bigger than me
Something bigger than me
Yeah, I can feel it opening

Try to ignore it, but it keeps on growing out of control
It's something bigger than me
I can feel it happening (happening)
(I can feel it) (happening) (I can feel it) (happening) (I can feel it, I can feel it)
