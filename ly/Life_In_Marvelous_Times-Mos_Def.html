		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bright moments

Bright moments always come back vivid

The fifth great was epic citywide test pressure
The pre-crack era!

Mr. Schollmen, what a prick, attitude matches wardrobe, uglier then sin

This is Bed Stuy 82'
9th floor three tiny rooms one view
Buck-town, Roosevelt house
They green grass is green
Our green grass is brown

Shots rang my phone wasn't touch tone
A heavy beef in the street
ET had to flee

Grey heavens! Good grief!
Hungry bellies!
Bright gold on they teeth!

The windows on the ave look like sad eyes
They fix their sharp gaze on you when you pass by
And if you dare to stand, you can see 'em cry

You can watch em scowl
Feel them prowl
Wall and study every inch about you
Fast math measuring what you amount to

The laughter, the screams!
The numeral, the song of Psalms
The book of dreams!

Ends don't meet where the arms can't reach
Mean streets
Even when its free it ain't cheap
On going saga, terminal diagnosis
Basic survival requires super heroics

No space in the budget for a cake
It's when you gotta fly by night to save the day

Crash-landings routinely happen
Some survive, others never rise from the ashes

Watching asphalt and observing the Sabbath
Creates an ecstatic and there you have it

From teenage love
Praying in tongue
Strange fruit, batty boots and native drums

From hence I come
So here we go
Signs and wonders all along the road

Some lies open
Some lies close
Some stretchers role with no lies at all
Some riders don't know what they riding for

Hands on the wheel and their mind is gone
Wherever you ride, whatever your name
This raw cold life is a beautiful thing

And we are alive in amazing times
Delicate hearts, diabolical minds

Revelations, hatred, love and war
And more and more and more and more
And more of less than ever before
It's just too much more for your mind to absorb

It's scary like hell, but there's no doubt
We can't be alive in no time but now!

It's just another shot to the heart
It's just a sure shot in the dark
It's just another place in the stars
Wonders on every side, life in marvelous times
Life in marvelous times
Bey! 
Right, everywhere
All over the world, you can feel it
All over the world, feel it
Spirits rise everywhere
It's just a sure shot to the heart
It's just a sure shot in the dark
It's just another place in the stars
Wonders on every side, life in marvelous times
Life in marvelous times
Now, always
