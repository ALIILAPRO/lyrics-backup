		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're my number one reason why I hate my phone
You're like a dirty shitty laundry nobody wants
Keep on coming like a plague, you know it will coming back again and again
I hope to never see you again
Wish I can bang your head against the wall
I'd be happy to watch you bleed, until your body chilled
But that shit is against the law
If I could I wanna drown you and all of your clown like friends too
They're a bitch like you when I pulled out my G2
Well, fuck you
Fuck you
Ain't nobody give a damn 'bout you or your goddamn bullshit
A fool like you better back to the zoo
Well, fuck you
Fuck you
You're like a God's biggest problem when you open your mouth
The only fools to blame when we all go south
You know I don't hate you
How about a shut eye? For the rest of your life
I hope to never see you again
Wish I can bang your head against the wall
I'd be happy to watch you bleed, until your body chilled
But that shit is against the law
If I could I wanna drown you and all of your clown like friends too
They're a bitch like you when I pulled out my G2
Well, fuck you
Fuck you
Ain't nobody give a damn 'bout you or your goddamn bullshit
A fool like you better back to the zoo
Well, fuck you
Fuck you
