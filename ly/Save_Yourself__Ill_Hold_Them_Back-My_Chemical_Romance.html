		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Are y'all ready where you are?
Are y'all ready where you are?
Are y'all ready where you are?

Na na na na na, na na na na na
Na na na na na, na na na na na

Right now

I hope you're ready for a firefight
'Cause the devil's got your number tonight (they say)
We're never leaving this place alive
But if we sing these words we'll never die

Get off the ledge and drop the knife
Not a victim of a victim's life
Because this ain't a room full of suicides
We're believers, I believe tonight

We could leave this world, leave it all behind
We could steal this car if your folks don't mind
We could live forever if you've got the time

Na na na na na, na na na na na (if you save yourself tonight)
Na na na na na, na na na na na (if you save yourself tonight)

I'll tell you all how the story ends
Where the good guys die and the bad guys win (who cares)
It ain't about all the friends you've made
But the graffiti they write on your grave

And all of us who've seen the light
Salute the dead and lead the fight
Who gives a damn if we lose the war
Let the walls come down
Let the engines roar

We could leave this world, leave it all behind
We could steal this car if your folks don't mind
We could live forever if you've got the time, oh, oh, oh
I'm the only friend that makes you cry
You're a heart attack in black hair dye
So just save yourself and I'll hold them back tonight

Are y'all ready where you are? 
If you save yourself tonight
'Cause they're coming for you
Can you save yourself tonight? 

Right now

Cannot hold them back

We could leave this world, leave it all behind
We could steal this car if your folks don't mind
We could live forever if you've got the time

You motherfucker (whoa)

Through the broken glass and the morning light,
Be a burning star if it takes all night
So just save yourself I'll hold them back tonight

Na na na na na, na na na na na (if you save yourself tonight)
Na na na na na, na na na na na (can you save yourself tonight?)
