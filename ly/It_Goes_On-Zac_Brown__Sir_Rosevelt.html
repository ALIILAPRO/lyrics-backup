		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When you heart's on the edge
Barely hanging on like a midnight cigarette
When the nights don't seem to end
And that lonely wind is singing you to sleep once again

I won't make a promise I can't keep
Like a river flows to the ocean deep

It goes on and on
Bound to forever
Even when we're gone
It goes on and on
We'll be together
At the rising of the dawn
It goes on

When your mind's on the loose
Slowly wearing out like a faded old tattoo
When the days all look the same
When that lonely wind keeps singing only you can ease the pain

That's the kind of bond that you can't break
Like looking up at all the stars in space

It goes on and on
Bound to forever
Even when we're gone
It goes on and on
We'll be together
At the rising of the dawn
It goes on

Digging through the sands of time to find my way back home
Your memory's the thing that keeps me hanging on
To know I'm not alone, we're stronger than the bonds of blood
Even on the darkest days together through the valley of the gun

It goes on and on
Bound to forever
Even when we're gone
It goes on and on and on
We'll be together
At the rising of the dawn
We'll be together
At the rising of the dawn
