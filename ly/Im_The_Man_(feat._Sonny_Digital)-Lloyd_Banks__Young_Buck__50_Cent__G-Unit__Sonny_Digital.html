		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I came in the world cryin' and fussin'
Nigga, we ain't have nothin'
Every ghetto I know the same
We try to make a little change
Preacher man come around talkin'
I don't wanna hear it, keep walkin'
I'mma put the powder in the pot
Whip it 'til I'm pullin' off a lot
Imagine when I pull it off the lot
New shit come without a top
Once I'm on I ain't never gon' stop
Bitch, I'm on, I ain't never gon' stop

I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man
I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man

Aye, came in the game gettin' money
Flippin' chickens, whip it, gettin' money
Niggas get to playin' with the money
Clique bang for the money, shit changed over money
They love to see a nigga on the bottom
Catch a come up, gotta keep it on the low
A nigga plug bless a nigga with a whole
Wanna break the bitch down into 36 O's
Looky here, bitch, I'm A-okay
Shorty wanna fuck with me
Stripping, yeah, the jiggy, nigga
Later, she gon' hit my line
We ain't gon' waste no time
She sucking and we fucking like she need me
While she make a bankroll easy
All the light in the room from the T.V
We gettin' it on then I'm gone
It's the type of shit that a nigga be on

Too much on my mind right now
I'm on the grind right now
Looking for me, sucker, then I need to be found right now
I got my nine right now
Bitch, I'll blow your mind right now
I ain't fucking around right now
Better get in line right now
Or fuck around and die right now
Hope you understand that

Bitch, I'm the man, ho, I'm the man, you know I'm the man
Bitch, I'm the man, ho, I'm the man, you know I'm the man
Bitch, I'm the man, ho, I'm the man, you know I'm the man
Bitch, I'm the man, ho, I'm the man, you know I'm the man

Came in the game gettin' money
I fuck with all the bitches gettin' money
But you love playing games with the corny shit
Messin' with a nigga, I only bought it 'cause I want it
You love to see a nigga at the bottom
You tried to come up, you don't keep it on the low
They like a drug, don't like you to call them hoes
I'm trying to break a booty down like 36 O's
I think I love a big fat A-O-D, make that bitch cum for free
Look at mommy shake it, I'mma call her, she gon' hit my line, fall in love every time
But if I don't pay she gon' leave me, never had a real reason, all I get is bits and pieces
And I believe it, I ain't think this shit was easy, who am I now?

Too much on my mind right now
I'm on the grind right now
Looking for me, sucker, then I need to be found right now
I got my nine right now
Bitch, I'll blow your mind right now
I ain't fucking around right now
Better get in line right now
Or fuck around and die right now
Hope you understand that

Bitch, I'm the man, ho, I'm the man, you know I'm the man
Bitch, I'm the man, ho, I'm the man, you know I'm the man
Bitch, I'm the man, ho, I'm the man, you know I'm the man
Bitch, I'm the man, ho, I'm the man, you know I'm the man

Know I'm the man, hoe I'm the man
Think she ain't special, watch how she change for a nigga, oh naw
They not on my level, that's why I look at you different, yeah yeah
