		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here's a toast to you it's been too long
And we're drinking 'til the night is gone
Where did you go? What have you seen?
And over there
Does the air taste differently?

Where did you go?
Where did you go?
I don't know

Where did you go?
Where 
Did you go?

I don't know
I don't know

But I know you're watching over me
You help us through the good and through the pain we breathe
One day we'll wake up from this crazy dream
We'll meet again
After my lights dim out
And I'll be wondering

Where will we go?
Where will we go?
I don't know

Where will we go?
Where 
Will we go?

I don't know
I don't know

Where will we go?
Where will we go?
I don't know

Where will we go?
Where 
Will we go?

I don't know
I don't know
