		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Come on! Hey! Don't 
Tell us what you want,'cause we don't 
Give a fuck about you and your kind
You! You better take a step back where ever 
The fuck you came from

No! You ain't one of us and to be tag along 
You're too ugly and blunt
Why? Is it so hard to get that we don't 
Need you, stupid cunt!

If you don't know how to resent one another
To gain the new way of power,
It'll get to the point where no one gives a fuck
What you may think of us or what you may not

Stop! Are you ever gonna stop tryin' to be 
On the way that we want to go?
Fuck! It's pissing the fuck out of us when 
You don't understand the word, no

Now, you're tellin' that you'll win the 
War that's only battled 'cause you're 
Too dumb to die, That's right! 
You can take your war and shove it up your 
Ass, then close your eyes and say goodbye

If you don't know how to resent one another
To gain the new way of power
It'll get to the point where no one gives a fuck
What you may think of us or what you may not

We're hate crew, we stand and we won't fall
We're all for none and none for all
Fuck you! We'll fight til' the last hit
And we sure as hell ain't taking no shit
