		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Valentine in December
You say you love me but you don't remember (Gave you my heart)
My name you caused me pain
All girls are the same in the end

One time in December
Girl don't you remember
I said I love you say it back you could never
That tore me apart
Yea you punctured my heart
Wish I knew from the start
That you were a pretender

Crazy thinking we were meant to be
Don't know how you became my only enemy
Find your reflection, look deep in your soul and ask again if this is who you really wanna be

Memories drowning up in Hennessy
Thinking 'bout when you had a little empathy
Why you been lyin', tryna fuck me mentally
Lost in the night but daily I pretend to be

R-R-Reminiscing on the older me
The older me that I can barely remember
Sacrificed my life to you don't know why you still chose to throw my heart in the blender

Valentine in December
You say you love me but you don't remember
My name you caused me pain
All girls are the same in the end

(All girls are the same)
They're rotting my brain
Take me back to when we were so young, so faded
Don't believe my life's gon' have to change

Valentine in December
Gave you my heart but now I'm the offender (Gave you my heart)
My name you caused me pain
All girls are the same (All girls are the same)
