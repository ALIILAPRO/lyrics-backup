		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Out on the wiley, windy moors 
We'd roll and fall in green. 
You had a temper like my jealousy: 
Too hot, too greedy. 
How could you leave me, 
When I needed to possess you? 
I hated you. I loved you, too. 

Bad dreams in the night. 
They told me I was going to lose the fight, 
Leave behind my wuthering, wuthering 
Wuthering Heights. 

Heathcliff, it's me--Cathy. 
Come home. I'm so cold! 
Let me in-a-your window. 

Heathcliff, it's me--Cathy. 
Come home. I'm so cold! 
Let me in-a-your window. 

Ooh, it gets dark! It gets lonely, 
On the other side from you. 
I pine a lot. I find the lot 
Falls through without you. 
I'm coming back, love. 
Cruel Heathcliff, my one dream, 
My only master. 

Too long I roam in the night. 
I'm coming back to his side, to put it right. 
I'm coming home to wuthering, wuthering, 
Wuthering Heights, 

Heathcliff, it's me--Cathy. 
Come home. I'm so cold! 
Let me in-a-your window. 

Heathcliff, it's me--Cathy. 
Come home. I'm so cold! 
Let me in-a-your window. 

Ooh! Let me have it. 
Let me grab your soul away. 
Ooh! Let me have it. 
Let me grab your soul away. 
You know it's me--Cathy! 

Heathcliff, it's me--Cathy. 
Come home. I'm so cold! 
Let me in-a-your window. 

Heathcliff, it's me--Cathy. 
Come home. I'm so cold! 
Let me in-a-your window. 

Heathcliff, it's me--Cathy. 
Come home. I'm so cold!
