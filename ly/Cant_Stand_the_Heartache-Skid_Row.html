		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fall in love with a twisted lady
Suicide with a cover girl
Spend all your time then you got stuck paying the price

Whoa, uptown, kick it down, into a spin
Face the wall, take it all, you just can't win

Can't stand the heartache, so bleeds the red, red rose
Time heals a broken heart, but that's just the way it goes
I can't stand, I can't stand the heartache

No, you got caught in the line of fire, a bystander innocence
You held your own 'til it wasn't yours anymore
Waste away another day into the night
You're at home by the phone, it don't seem right

Can't stand the heartache, so bleeds the red, red rose
Time heals a broken heart, but that's just the way it goes
I can't stand, I can't stand the heartache

You held me like a prisoner
And I don't know
Why I stayed here from the start

Whoa, uptown, run me down under your wheels
I pray, one day, you'll know how it feels

Can't stand the heartache, so bleeds the red, red rose
Time heals a broken heart, but that's just the way it goes
I can't stand the heartache, so bleeds the red, red, red rose
Time heals a broken heart, but that's just the way it goes
I can't stand the heartache, so bleeds the red, red rose
Time heals a broken heart, but that's just the way it goes
I can't stand the heartache
