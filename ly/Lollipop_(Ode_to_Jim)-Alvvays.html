		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Saw Jim Reid in the corridor
And I wondered if he could ever see me that way
He was on my list at the grocery store
When you grabbed my wrist and said you liked my keychain
Read your feature in the weekly paper
And honestly, I found it a little bit bloated
Friday, we fell through the coffee table
And that's when I discovered that my heart exploded
How? How?

You're a lollipop
In the form of a lightning bolt
You're a lollipop in my hair
But I'm a gumdrop
Am I ever gonna fit that mould?
'Cause I don't have the patience to wait in line for you

When I came back to apologize
You asked me if I was intrigued by LSD
I sat next to you on the picnic bench
And before I knew it, you were flying next to me
I met your baby at the exposition
And frankly, I found it a little unnerving
I let you know when we were driving home
And all I can remember is the fact that we're swerving

You're a lollipop
In the form of a lightning bolt
You're a lollipop in my hair
How could I ever obtain you?
But you're a doorstop
When you're lying on the bathroom floor
And I don't have the time to wait in line for you
How could I ever betray you?

Alter my state to get through this date
(You're alone in this picture and it swallows me whole)
Alter my state to get through this date
(You're alone in this picture and it swallows me whole)
Alter my state to get through this date
(You're alone in this picture and it swallows me whole))
Alter my state to get through this date
(You're alone in this picture)
Alter my state to get through this date

You're a lollipop 
In the form of a lightning bolt (How could I ever obtain you?)
You're a lollipop in my hair (How could I ever betray you?)
You look like Iggy Pop
Circa '73 or '4 (How could I ever obtain you?)
Because I don't have the time wait in line for you (How could I ever betray you?)
Wait for you
