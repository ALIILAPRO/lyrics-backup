		  (Hey Wheeler, you're late again)
(Good, this fuckin' job sucked a fuckin' dick anyway)

This nine to five can suck my cock
I'd rather eat shit than punch that clock
Monday through Friday is a hassle
Everybody here is an asshole

Today's the day I grow some balls
Stop jackin' off in the bathroom stall
And blowin' my load in the sink
And tell 'em what I really think

Fuck this job
Fuck you boss
Fuck your profit
And fuck your loss
Fuck you Linda at the front desk too
Guy in the mailroom, fuck you
This whole company can slob my knob
Fuck all y'all
Fuck this job

Without me here this place is screwed
Y'all don't know half the shit I do
You shoulda understood from the get go
I oughta be runnin' this shithole

Ps, I pissed in the coffee pot
Took a big dump in the parking lot
Hid a dildo in the drawer
Kiss my ass
I'm out the door

Fuck this job
Fuck you boss
Fuck your profit
And fuck your loss
Fuck you Linda at the front desk too (what?)
Guy in the mailroom, fuck you
This whole company can slob my knob
Fuck all y'all
Fuck this job

I'm off to chase my dreams
Crush more pussy than you've ever seen
I guess what I really mean is

Fuck this job
Fuck you boss
Fuck your profit
And fuck your loss
Fuck you Linda at the front desk too (what?)
Guy in the mailroom, fuck you
This whole company can slob my knob
Fuck all y'all
Fuck this job

Fuck this job
Fuck you boss
Fuck your profit
And fuck your loss
Fuck you Linda at the front desk too (what?)
Guy in the mailroom, fuck you
This whole company can slob my knob
Fuck all y'all
Fuck this job

Fuck all y'all
Fuck this job
