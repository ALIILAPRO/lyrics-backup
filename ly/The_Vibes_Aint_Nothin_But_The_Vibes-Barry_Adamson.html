		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ok, what have we got here
Horny black boy with frisky white girl
Eye each other across the room and 
The chemistry is unbearable and

Definitely not on anyones agenda
He suggests they go to someplace they won't be seen
And she thinks otherwise
Finally they agree to go 

And put up with Dunkin donuts
The usual story, they fall in love
Under the hail of spit they ignore
All the while secretly conspiring to murder each other 

Hoping that will eleviate the slightly more
Uncomfortable feelings that may arise 
In a situation like this
But behind closed doors 

The eyes of the world
Becoming their wallpaper
They melt into a beautiful example
Of a power that definitely exists

And come together on a warm moonlit night
In spite of themselves
Ummmm, a likely story
