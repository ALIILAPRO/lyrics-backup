		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Even though my heart is weak
Even when my arms are empty
Even if they don't believe
It doesn't mean it isn't true
Even though I'm black and blue
Even when they tell me not to
Even if I end up used
It doesn't mean I'm the fool

'Cause magic takes time
And I've got my sights
And they're set on you
And one day, this rhyme
Might make you smile
And then I'll sing, "Hallelujah"

In the dark, I see
Through the raging sea
And I'll be ready
You are worth the road to maybe
I don't break so easily
I can take if you unleash
All your worry, all your doubt
Please believe in me

It's magic, my love (oh yeah, oh yeah)
The way you feel (the way you feel)
It's magic, my love (oh yeah, oh yeah)
But still so real (but still so real)

I don't care where you have been
I don't mind your lips on my skin
I don't know where to begin
But I'd like to end with you
I wanna feel like this
I can't forget your kiss
And every time I wish
I wish that I could be the one you choose

It's magic, my love (oh yeah, oh yeah)
The way you feel (the way you feel)
It's magic, my love (oh yeah, oh yeah)
But still so real (but still so real)

With your eyes on me, I start to tremble
Always you, has been forever
Blurry lines I can't remember
Fighting words I wanna tell ya
With your eyes on me, I start to tremble
Always you, has been forever
Blurry lines I can't remember
Fighting words I wanna tell ya

And it's hard to be
Close enough to breathe
I'm in your space
But I tread so carefully
I would dive into you deep
I would chance my defeat
All my worry, all my doubt
I am laying at your feet

It's magic (it's magic), my love (my love)
The way you feel (the way you feel)
It's magic (it's magic), my love (my love)
But still so real (but still so real)

With your eyes on me, I start to tremble
Always you, has been forever
Blurry lines I can't remember
Fighting words I wanna tell ya
I don't care where you have been
I don't mind your lips on my skim
Blurry lines I can't remember
Fighting words I wanna tell ya
