		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Say something awful
As if fucking the world is your right
And I watch you stumble
Drunk out into the night to cat call ladies

You're thirsty for blood
You're picking a fight
And I wanted to ask you
Man, what do you do in the daylight
So bum me a cigarette, buy me a beer
Till I'm happy to be here, happy to be here
With all of my family, hookers in heels
And the men who watch them
Like hungry black eels

Run into me Sunday
Tell me you had one hell of a time
And through the haze and the gun smoke
I'm forced to believe
You're probably right someone lies bleeding

Someone got violent and did not think twice
And I watched you my brother
Making a fool of the moon tonight
So bum me a cigarette, buy me a beer
Till I'm happy to be here, happy to be here
With all of my family, hookers in heels
And the men who watch them
Like hungry black eels am I just a spark?
