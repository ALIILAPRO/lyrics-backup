		<p>
		  I need someone
I need someone
I need someone
I need you (you, you, you, you, you, you)
I need you (you, you, you, you, you, you)
I need you

When it come, the musical ting called
Let it be smooth like a ball
All-maximum crew, stand up, turn up
Get rowdy, buck wild and get ready to be wild now
'Cause me alone and a likkle drink

Come on
I need someone (come on)
I need you
Come on
I need someone (come on)
I need you

I need you

I need someone
I need someone
I need someone
I need you (you, you, you, you, you, you)
I need you (you, you, you, you, you, you)
I need you

When it come, the musical ting called
Let it be smooth like a ball
All-maximum crew, stand up, turn up
Get rowdy, buck wild and get ready to be wild now
'Cause me alone and a likkle drink

Come on
I need someone (come on)
I need you
Come on
I need someone (come on)
I need you
