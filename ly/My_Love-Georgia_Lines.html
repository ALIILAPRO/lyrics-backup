		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Chorus: 
My love, 
I'll keep chasing till the end of the road
Till you say why don't you leave me alone 
But your something I can't live without 

My love,
If you tell me I'll be fine on my own
I'll keep driving till the end of the road 
But your something I can't live without 

Verse: 
I was fine in the morning, I'm healing in time 
Till I see you moving on with life 
I hide all this emotion, hide inside
It seems your dancing in this midnight 
All of these voices, All of these words 
Poisoning the well I'm drinking from 
And all of these stories, they're all lies, searching for a new vice

Chorus: 
My love, 
I'll keep chasing till the end of the road
Till you say why don't you leave me alone 
But your something I can't live without 

My love,
If you tell me I'll be fine on my own
I'll keep driving till the end of your road 
But your something I can't live without
