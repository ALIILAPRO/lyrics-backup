		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
Baby, I'm a certified smacker
Plies, Kodak
I'm a real deal sniper, ya nah I mean?
Yeah, yeah
I know you ain't never been with no real hitter
No real nigga
I'm talm 'bout like, a nigga that really got a sack though
I'm talm 'bout like bein' cuffed by the boss and not the runner (2-3-9-5-4)
Yeah, that way

Have you ever made love to a real hitter? (Yeah)
A nigga that always in the field, probably finessin'
Probably out here drug dealin' (I wanna know) 
I'ma love you like I might die tomorrow, ayy
I'ma love you like I might die tomorrow, ayy
I'm probably gettin' money if I ain't call you, baby
I'm probably gettin' money if I ain't call you, baby

I done came back from pissin' inside the Trump hotel
'Fore I take it in, I got to catch me one more sale
Name saved up under "Febreze" 'cause she ain't got no smell
I can hit it from the back, ain't got to hold my breath
All these hundreds on me got me startin' to look like a scammer
All that ass she got back there startin' to look like a pamper
Pull up on your ass with a bag just like I'm Santa
Plug name Julio but he don't play for Atlanta 
The only millionaire you know that wear Dope Boy Ree's
You ain't never fucked a nigga that had this much cheese
I'm just tryna run you crazy like they tried Kanye
Treat you like the mailman, make you come once a day (yeah)

Have you ever made love to a real hitter? (Yeah)
A nigga that always in the field, probably finessin'
Probably out here drug dealin' (I wanna know) 
I'ma love you like I might die tomorrow, ayy
I'ma love you like I might die tomorrow, ayy
I'm probably gettin' money if I ain't call you, baby
I'm probably gettin' money if I ain't call you, baby

Baby, you know I'm out here in these streets, I gotta get it
If I ain't on the corner, I'm in the 'yo, bae, I be busy
But you gotta pray for me 'cause these niggas be hatin' in my city
And you gotta thank God everyday he be lettin' you be with me
I'ma get in that lil' pussy like I'm just gettin' outta prison
And word around town, he bagged a nigga but he didn't
I'm Sniper Gang baby, I got more stripes than the Navy
And ain't nothin' changed because I motherfuckin' made it
I'm a real hitter, I'm a real nigga, I'ma treat you like a lady
I'm a real hitter, so every pistol I got, it ain't on safety
And if I ain't call your back, then bae, I'm gettin' to that money
But I'ma come through, and I'ma fuck ya like the police lookin' for me

Have you ever made love to a real hitter? (Yeah)
A nigga that always in the field, probably finessin'
Probably out here drug dealin' (I wanna know) 
I'ma love you like I might die tomorrow, ayy
I'ma love you like I might die tomorrow, ayy
I'm probably gettin' money if I ain't call you, baby
(Baby, you ain't never been with no real hitter like that)
I'm probably gettin' money if I ain't call you, baby (yeah)

I get your hair done so much, they start to think you a beautician
These lil' niggas tryna come up, only reason they diss me
Your last man bought you bebe but I'll buy you Givenchy
Biggest thing he ever did for you was take you to chili's
Keep a bank in my pocket, call me plies Fargo
Sex game undefeated, think I'm a hundred to nought
I don't go nowhere for free, if you got a check, I'll go
Your last man, he was petty, tell him I said so
I be hustling so hard, I lose track of the days
That lil' pussy was so sorry, I called it minimum wage
'Fore you leave this earth, baby, you better get you a hitter
Talkin' one that got a bag and drop that rod like a killer, yeah

I just wanna know
Have you ever made love to a real hitter?
