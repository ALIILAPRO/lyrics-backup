		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Once upon a time was a fool who thought he'd find
Hoo, hoo

Once upon a time was a fool who thought he'd find
Purpose in his life along the way
Don't you run and hide from the truth you decide
Everything that lives is gone to waste

Hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo

Once upon a time was a fool who thought he'd find
Purpose in his life along the way
Don't you run and hide from the truth you decide
Everything that lives is gone to waste
