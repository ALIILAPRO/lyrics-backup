		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Gloria, I smell it on your breath
Gloria, booze and peppermint
Gloria, no one said enough is enough
Gloria, they found you on the floor
Gloria, my hand was tied to yours
And, Gloria, did you finally see that enough is enough?

Did you know me when I was younger then?
I could take the whole world with me
I would find myself feelin' alone
Heaven, help me now, Heaven, show the way
Get me back on my own two feet
I would lie awake and pray you don't lie awake for me

Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh


Gloria, you crawled up on your cross
Gloria, you made us sit and watch
Gloria, no one said enough is enough

Heaven, help me now (hey, hey), Heaven, show the way (Heaven, show)
Get me back on my own two feet
I would lie awake and pray you don't lie awake for me
Every night away (every night), every day alone (every day)
Get me back on my own two feet
I would lie awake and pray you don't lie awake for me

Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh

Gloria, will you just decide?
Gloria, there's easier ways to die
Gloria, have you had enough?
