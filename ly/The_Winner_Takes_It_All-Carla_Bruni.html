		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't wanna talk 
About the things we've gone through 
Though it's hurting me 
Now it's history 
I've played all my cards 
And that's what you've done too 
Nothing more to say 
No more ace to play 

The winner takes it all 
The loser standing small 
Beside the victory 
That's her destiny 

I was in your arms 
Thinking I belonged there 
I figured it made sense 
Building me a fence 
Building me a home 
Thinking I'd be strong there 
But I was a fool 
Playing by the rules 

The gods may throw a dice 
Their minds as cold as ice 
And someone way down here 
Loses someone dear 
The winner takes it all 
The loser has to fall 
It's simple and it's plain
Why should I complain?

I don't wanna talk
If it makes you feel sad
And I understand
You've come to shake my hand
I apologize
If it makes you feel bad
Seeing me so tense
No self-confidence

The judges will decide
The likes of me abide
Spectators of the show
Always staying low
The game is on again
A lover or a friend
A big thing or a small
The winner takes it all

The winner takes it all
The winner takes it all
The winner takes it all
