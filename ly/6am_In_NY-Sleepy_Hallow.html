		  (Great John on the beat, by the way)

I know money make 'em change, they ain't the same
And I don't want your love, you can keep it if it's fake
I don't think they really love me always
I don't think they really wanna be around me all day
Can't nobody make the pain go away, uh
Can't nobody make the sunshine when it's gon' rain, look

Would you rather cry in a Benz or a Wraith? Huh?
Would you rather die real or live fake?
You can see it in my eyes, I ain't really been okay
I used to be the nigga they thought would've been a waste
Now I'm runnin' up the cake, I got shows in every state
I'll probably pull up early just to catch 'em while it's late
Chopper take a nigga out, I ain't talkin' 'bout no date
I hit you with your spouse, give a fuck about the place
I was trappin', you was up on the couch, look
Brand new designer, I can't spell that shit out, huh
I want some money, you just lookin' for clout, huh
We make it ugly if you runnin' your mouth, huh

I know money make 'em change, they ain't the same
And I don't want your love, you can keep it if it's fake
I don't think they really love me always
I don't think they really wanna be around me all day
Can't nobody make the pain go away
Can't nobody make the sunshine when it's gon' rain, look

We just hit another lick, ooh yeah, niggas lit
Got all these blue hundreds, you can tell a nigga Crip
.40 on me for the hit, couple thousand for the 'fit
And you can call it showin' off, I'ma call it drip
Scammers loadin' up the bit', shooters loadin' up the clip
I know you see us goin' up, see us gettin' rich
I can't stop until the whole gang litty, look
And to the top, I'm takin' whole gang with me, look
She said she love me, I don't know her name
Pour me up some codeine
Pull up in a big body same color cocaine
I just wanna ball like I'm playin' for the A
Runnin' through this money, I can't take it to the grave

I know money make 'em change, they ain't the same
And I don't want your love, you can keep it if it's fake
I don't think they really love me always
I don't think they really wanna be around me all day
Can't nobody make the pain go away
Can't nobody make the sunshine when it's gon' rain
