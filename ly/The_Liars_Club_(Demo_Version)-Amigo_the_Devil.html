		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The Liars Club
Left my house with a book of matches
To try to burn this city down.
Instead I drove into the ocean,
And started swimming till I drowned.
Cause I'm a liar, liar,
Blood on fire
As drunk as I was,
And the ship sailed by.
And the sharks in the water made me realize that death is real
There's nothing at all that makes you feel as small as dying will.
Ghosts have a way to make regrets feel so alive,
But it's the deaths in us all that keep the hope of finding something better.
I left my house with that book of matches,
And all the worst intentions found.
I locked my kids down inside the basement,
And burned their dreams straight to the ground.
Cause I'm a liar, liar,
Blood on fire
As fucked as I was,
As the ship sank down.
And the sharks in the water made me realize that death is real
There's nothing at all that makes you feel as small as dying will.
Ghosts have a way to make regrets feel so alive,
But it's the death in us all that keeps the hope of finding something better.
