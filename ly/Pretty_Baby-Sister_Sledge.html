		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Pretty baby grew into a lady
The people don't know
What your mama know, they don't
Pretty baby

In the light of the dawn
A pretty babe was born
Her mother, she had sworn
To take good care of her

Every night Mom would pray
Her life would not be torn
Her clothes would not be worn
Until they dropped off of her

My child, you dear
Don't have no fear, I'll shed the tears
Keep your head clear, my pretty baby

Pretty baby grew into a lady
The people don't know
What your mama know, they don't
Pretty baby

Little girl, I want you to attend the finest schools
And never be a fool, I've got experience
Learn all that you can, you'll find that in the end
You'll learn how to depend on yourself

It makes me glad
You have the things I didn't have
Never be sad, my pretty baby

Pretty baby grew into a lady
The people don't know
What your mama know, they don't
Pretty baby

The people don't know
What your mama know, they don't
The people don't know
What your mama know, they don't

The people don't know
What your mama know, they don't
The people don't know
What your mama know, they don't

Pretty baby grew into a lady
Pretty baby grew into a lady

The people don't know
What your mama know, they don't
The people don't know
What your mama know, they don't
Pretty baby

Pretty baby grew into a lady
Pretty baby grew into a lady

The people don't know
What your mama know, they don't
The people don't know
What your mama know, they don't
Pretty baby
