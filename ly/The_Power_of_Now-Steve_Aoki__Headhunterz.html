		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, I'm haunted by
The ghost of you
Tryna keep from going under
But I can't get over you

Memories, memories
Everything you said to me, said to me
Oh, but now you're dead to me, dead to me
Now you're just a memory, memory

Ghost of you
Ghost of you
Ghost of you

Now you're just a
Now you're just a
Now you're just a memory

Memory

Haunted by the ghost of you
Haunted by the ghost of you

All my life, I've been haunted
Haunted by the ghost of you
And I think I'm going under
And I can't get over you

Memories, memories
Everything you said to me, said to me
Oh, but now you're dead to me, dead to me
Now you're just a memory, memory

Haunted by the ghost of you
Haunted by the ghost of you

Now you're just a memory

Memory

Now you're just a memory
