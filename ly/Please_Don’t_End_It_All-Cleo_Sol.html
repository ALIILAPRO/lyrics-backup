		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So far from who you used to be
Things didn't work out
But please don't end it all
'Cause God is still writin'
And you're nearly there

You're gonna find your way
And all it takes is better days
'Cause everybody's going through changes
Live your truth
By grace, hold my hand, don't be afraid
Everybody's going through changes
Ooh

I know that you lost your way
Drowned yourself in doubt
But please don't end it all
'Cause God is still writing
He'll never let you fall

You're gonna find your way
And all it takes is better days
Everybody's going through changes
Live your truth
By grace, hold my hand, don't be afraid
'Cause everybody's going through changes
Ooh
Oh, changes

Changes
Everybody

(You're not alone) woo
(Don't end it all)
(You're not alone)
(Don't end it all)
(You're not alone)
(Don't end it all)
