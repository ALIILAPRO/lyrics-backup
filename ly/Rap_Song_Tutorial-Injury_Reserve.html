		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Step 1: Choose your drums
Step 2: Assemble your drums
Step 3: Add your melody
Step 4: Write a hook
Step 5: Record your hook

Yeah, yeah, new chores, got some bread in mind
I want the two-doors, ain't no givin' rides
Oh, you wanna fight me? You can get in line
You can have your own steez, I invented mines
Yeah, new chores, got some bread in mind
I want the new Rollie, but the simple kind
Oh, you wanna fight me? You can get in line
The way I walk around, you'd think I invented time, yeah

Step 6: Mix and add your hook

New chores, got some bread in mind
I want the two-doors, ain't no givin' rides
Oh, you wanna fight me? You can get in line
You can have your own steez, I invented mines, yeah
Yeah, new chores, got some bread in mind
I want the new Rollie, but the simple kind
Oh, you wanna fight me? You can get in line
The way I walk around, you'd think I invented time, yeah

Step 7: Repeat with verse

New chores, yeah, "New Freezer" shit
New nigga, you can tell by my demeanor
I'm just thinkin' ahead, stackin' big boy chips
Left arm four time the size on some Hellboy shit
My son gon' want his gadgets too, on some Elroy shit
And he'll be workin' for that tool on some bellboy shit
I'll be drape-draped up like Joaquin in Her
Maybe throw some threes on so they don't think I defer
Oh my god

Congratulations, you have made one rap song
Repeat 10 to 12 times to create a rap album

New chores, got some bread in mind
I want the two-doors, ain't no givin' rides
Oh, you wanna fight me? You can get in line
You can have your own steez, I invented mines, yeah
Yeah, new chores, got some bread in mind
I want the new Rollie, but the simple kind
Oh, you wanna fight me? You can get in line
The way I walk around, you'd think I invented time, yeah
