		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I go from door to door
I’ts in my stories, what they adore
They ask me: “Should I let you in?”
You should know where I’ve been

I am the wanderer
I tell my stories to you
I am the wanderer
Please don’t tell yours, too

Oh, i’m getting old
But my stories got to be told
Then I’m done and free
But they keep on telling them to me

I am the wanderer
I tell my stories to you
I am the wanderer
Please don’t tell yours, too


I am the wanderer
I tell my stories to you
I am the wanderer
Please don’t tell yours, too
