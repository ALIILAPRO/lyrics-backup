		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey baby, why you being so shady lately?
Oh, what you talkin' bout girl?
What's goin' on huh?

You know I told you, girl you're always on my mind.
You know that I'm crazy about ya, I need you right by my side.
And I want you, girl
And I need you, girl
You're the only girl in my life
Psyche!
I'm the gift that just keeps on givin'.
I'm a slut and I won't stop, ohhh.
Like a drink that I can't stop sippin'
Red cup, you know I fly solo.
Shawty wanna romp,
Tell her bring her friends
Do it every night
Party never ends.

Like a drink that I can't stop sippin'
Red cup, you know I fly solo
Solo
Solo
(Hey boys, mmm, it's lacey, baby)
I fly solo
You know I told you boy, you're always on my mind
You know that I'm crazy about ya, I need you right by my side.
And I want you, boy
And I need you, boy
You're the only boy in my life
Psyche!
I'm the gift that just keeps on givin'
I'm a slut and I won't stop, ohhh
Like a drink that I can't stop sippin'
Red cup, you know I fly solo
Shawty wanna romp
Tell her bring her friends
Do it every night
Party never ends

Like a drink that I can't stop sippin'
Red cup, you know I fly solo
Solo

Uh yea
Cash cash in the house, baby
Solo
Spizzy spose
I fly solo
It's cute you want a marriage
Ring finger karat
So you can call up karen and tel her "He went to Jared!"
What up spizzy spose, cougar
You are not enough
T-shirt; a polo, logo, bro go, lift your solo cups
Girl, I'm a lone wolf. And a free bird
Lynard Skynard.
I'm a sinner, talkin' women to dinner.
Go tel your parents. I'm not awesome, I'm awful.
I won't settle down, like jamestown, drive 'round hat crooked lookin' for the brothel
Yeah man, I'm tired of being single.

Dude maybe I should settle down a bit
Psyche!
I'm the gift that just keeps on givin'
I'm a slut and I won't stop, ohhh
Like a drink that I can't stop sippin'
Red cup, you know I fly solo
I'm the gift that just keeps on givin'
I'm a slut and I won't stop, ohhh
Like a drink that I can't stop sippin'
Red cup, you know I fly solo
Shawty wanna romp
Tell her bring her friends
Do it every night
Party never ends

Like a drink that I can't stop sippin'
Red cup, you know I fly solo
Yeah. Solo. 
Cash Cash 2010, baby
I fly solo!
