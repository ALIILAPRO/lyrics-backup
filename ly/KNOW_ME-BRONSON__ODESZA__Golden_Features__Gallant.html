		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Yeah) Karma never used to move so fast, move so fast
Now every second that you can't go back 
Your pulse reacts, ohh (yeah)

Dozen times you tried to bridge that gap
Embrace your past, discouraged
You just keep running in place
Hoping you can change all that, change all that

'Cause I know you've been losing sleep at night, at night
Even though you say you're satisfied, you lied, you lied

You say you're fine but in your mind
It's like you know me for the first time
Seeing the signs, you realize
It's like you know me for the first time

Scratched the surface but you're in too deep, in too deep
Paranoid you might admit defeat
So you don't speak, no, no (yeah)
Took a minute for yourself to see
You're not lonely or damaged
Girl, you're looking for release
You know you can reach for me if you need

'Cause I know you've been losing sleep at night, at night
Even though you say you're satisfied, you lied

You say you're fine but in your mind
It's like you know me for the first time
Seeing the signs, you realize
It's like you know me for the first time

It's like you know me for the first time

It's like you know me for the first time
