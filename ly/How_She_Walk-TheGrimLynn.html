		  [Intro]
Say look at how she walking when she walk to me
She talk when she talk to me

[Hook]
Look at how she walk when she walk to me
Look at how she talk when she talk to me
You think she fucking with you but she fuck with me
You think she fucking with you but she fuck with me

Just look at how she talk when she talk to me
Look at how she walk when she walk to me
You think she fucking with you but she fuck with me
You think she fucking with you but she fuck with me

[Verse 1]
So long I've been on this road
I done fuck so many niggas hoes
It ain't my fault i just hope you know
Should have did you're research before you chose
We made love as our drinks spilled
The moonlight is the source of a free will
The early morning trips forplaying B pill
She said her husband has it all but she cheat still
And i ain't saying she's a bad girl, a bad girl
I just won't be cuffing that girl, not that girl
Cause she can't make up her mind
But I'll still fuck her time to time

[Hook]
Look at how she walk when she walk to me
Look at how she talk when she talk to me
You think she fucking with you but she fuck with me
You think she fucking with you but she fuck with me

Just look at how she talk when she talk to me
Look at how she walk when she walk to me
You think she fucking with you but she fuck with me
You think she fucking with you but she fuck with me
