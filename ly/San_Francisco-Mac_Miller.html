		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, welcome to the dark side of my bizarre mind
I'm trapped inside of this amusement park ride
There's an atom bomb inside my hard drive
I'm holdin' the apocalypse (apocalypse)
Let's take a ride and get lost in this metropolis (metropolis)
Just realized that I'm an idiot
Wearin' my disguise, my real face is fuckin' hideous
My pretty bitch watchin' insidious with her pussy out (pussy out)
Aw, sookie-sookie now (aw, sookie-sookie now)
Rapper terrorist, rarer than good parents is
Puttin' hard drugs inside of all your baby's carriages
Arrogance, throwin' cherry bombs where the sheriff lives (sheriff lives)
Just because that shit's hilarious (shit's hilarious)
And I inherited the thirst for self-destruction and I'm scared of it
I wanna be buried with a novel and a chariot (and a chariot)
I'm a bigger illusion than good marriages (marriages)
Or what it means to be American
Whoa

I took acid in San Francisco
Stripped butt-naked, caused a panic at the disco
Fell for the bimbo who was dancin' at the strip show
I gotta stop thinkin' with my dick-hole (ya)
I took acid in San Francisco
Stripped butt-naked, caused a panic at the disco
Fell for the bimbo who was dancin' at the strip show
A genius still thinkin' with his dick bone

Out in Wichita, Kansas, smokin' meth with all the locals (all the locals)
Askin' them to teach me how to yodel
Suppose I'll die alone from an overdose of some sort
In a motel while some whore I'm fuckin' runnin' to the drug store
I hacked into the motherboard, argued on a public forum
Uploaded a virus to the network, then unplugged the cord (unplugged the cord)
The laws are not important
If you scared, lock your door then (door then)
Okay, uh, I always feel like a foreigner
Morphin' into some sort of sorcerer (sorcerer)
I'm Yuri's brother if it's Lord of War
What would I be normal for?
I'm goin' door-to-door shootin' pornos with a good script (good script)

I took acid in San Francisco
Stripped butt-naked, caused a panic at the disco
Fell for the bimbo who was dancin' at the strip show
I gotta stop thinkin' with my dick-hole (ya)
I took acid in San Francisco
Stripped butt-naked, caused a panic at the disco
Fell for the bimbo who was dancin' at the strip show
A genius still thinkin' with his dick bone
