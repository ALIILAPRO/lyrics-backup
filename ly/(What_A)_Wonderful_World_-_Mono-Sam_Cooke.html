		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't know much about History
Don't know much Biology
Don't know much about a Science book
Don't know much about the French I took

But I do know that I love you
And I know that if you love me too
What a wonderful world this would be

Don't know much about Geography
Don't know much Trigonometry
Don't know much about Algebra
Don't know what a slide rule is for

But I do know one and one is two
And if this one could be with you
What a wonderful world this would be

Now, I don't claim to be an A student
But I'm trying to be
For maybe by being an A student, baby
I can win your love for me

Don't know much about History
Don't know much Biology
Don't know much about a Science book
Don't know much about the French I took

But I do know that I love you
And I know that if you love me too
What a wonderful world this would be

La ta ta ta ta ta ta (History)
Hmm (Biology)
Oh, la ta ta ta ta ta ta ta (Science book)
Hmm (French I took)

Yeah, but I do know that I love you
And I know that if you love me too
What a wonderful world this would be
