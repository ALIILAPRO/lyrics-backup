		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do you dream alone
Under the moon?
Is it brighter, brighter
When I'm with you?
Is the afterglow strong enough
To light this fire, fire
Back in us? Ooh-whoa

Mixed emotions
Hearts still open
Though we're far apart

I get this feeling
I wanna be where you are
I wanna be where you are
I wanna be where you are
I get this feeling
I wanna be where you are
I wanna be where you are
I wanna be where you are

Are you wide awake?
Counting the stars
Or just lying, lying
In the dark? Ooh-whoa

Mixed emotions
Hearts still open
Though we're far apart

I get this feeling
I wanna be where you are
I wanna be where you are
I wanna be where you are
I get this feeling
I wanna be where you are
I wanna be where you are
I wanna be where you are

I wanna be where you are

I get this feeling
I wanna be where you are
I wanna be where you are
I wanna be where you are
I get this feeling
I wanna be where you are
I wanna be where you are
I wanna be where you are
