		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're so cold whenever you're next to me
I start to lose hope
So tell me do you hate me

My words are contradictory to everything inside of me
There's nowhere left to hide
When feelings creep into the outside
I never said what you what you did to me
Because weakness is something that I never want you to see
But you'll always be

A piece of my broken mind
(That I can't leave behind)
You make me feel numb inside
You're so cold
Whenever you're next to me 
I start to lose hope
So tell me do you hate me
These haunting memories
They're all that I can see
You love to watch me bleed
So tell me 
Do you hate me

I hope that you are satisfied by
Every single tear I cried
I couldn't breathe
And I didn't want to believe
That you would ever want to hurt me
Make me feel like I'm not worthy
I feel so sick
I just want to finally escape this

piece of my broken mind
(That I can't leave behind)
You make me feel numb inside
(Slipping away this time)
You're so cold
Whenever you're next to me 
I start to lose hope
So tell me do you hate me
These haunting memories
They're all that I can see
You love to watch me bleed
So tell me 
Do you hate me

You said you'd try to take the best of me
You meant everything you said to me
What's left if I hate the rest of me
You tried to take the best of me

You'll never take the best of me

You'll never take the best of me

You're so cold
Whenever you're next to me 
I start to lose hope
So tell me do you hate me
These haunting memories
They're all that I can see
You love to watch me bleed
So tell me 
Do you hate me

You're so cold
So tell me to you hate me

You're so cold
So tell me to you hate me
