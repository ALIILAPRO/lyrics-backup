		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't play with my world
Don't mess with my mind
Don't question my space-time
My cosmos is mine

Don't toy with my heart
Don't knock down my shrines
Don't alter my headlines
My cosmos is mine

No war, no war, no war
No more, no more, no more, no more
No fear, no fear, no fear, no fear
Not here, not here, not here, not here

No rain, no clouds
No pain, no shrouds
No final breaths
No senseless deaths

Don't stare at my soul
I swear it is fine (don't mess with my mind)
Its borders are outlined (don't question my space-time)
My cosmos is mine (my cosmos is mine)
My cosmos is mine

My cosmos is mine (don't play with my world)
My cosmos is mine (don't mess with my mind)
My cosmos is mine (don't question my space-time)
My cosmos is mine

(Don't play with my world)
(Don't mess with my mind)
(Don't mess with my mind)
