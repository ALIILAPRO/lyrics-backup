		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I often think about the way you'll think about me when we're old
I always thought that we could be the greatest story ever told
But there's a rock inside my sock, I'll keep on walkin' 'cause it's cold
And I can't stop the clock from tickin', I know that it's just the beginnin'

Don't forget
This story's not over yet
Time passed like a cigarette
Turning into smoke between our fingers
Tell me you won't forget
Remember the night we met
Rewind like an old cassette
And I'll be the song that's on your speakers

Playing for you, you, you
Playing for you, you, you
I'll be playing for you, you, you
And I'll be the song that's on your speakers

I often wonder why I wonder how I'll feel in thirty years
About the time we spent together, will the memories disappear?
It might sound crazy, but my baby, that's the thing that I most fear
Oh, I can't stop the world from spinnin', I know that it's just the beginnin'

So please, don't forget
This story's not over yet
Time passed like a cigarette
Turning into smoke between our fingers
Tell me you won't forget
Remember the night we met
Rewind like an old cassette
And I'll be the song that's on your speakers

Playing for you, you, you
Playing for you, you, you
I'll be playing for you, you, you
And I'll be the song that's on your speakers

And if one day, the image starts to fade
Don't worry, babe, oh, that would be okay
I'll give you all the memories that I saved
Just leave me with a picture, just a picture of your face

I won't forget
This story's not over yet
Time passed like a cigarette
Turning into smoke between our fingers
Tell me you won't forget
Remember the night we met
Rewind like an old cassette
And I'll be the song that's on your speakers

Playing for you, you, you
Playing for you, you, you
Playing for you, you, you
And I'll be the song that's on your speakers
Playing for you
