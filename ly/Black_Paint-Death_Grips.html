		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Drop the curtains soaked in shadow, more shade
Black, black paint
Drip freak freak seek seek so cold today
Black, black paint
Making sounds that don't deserve us like blou
Black, black paint
Those are my Satanic urges right now
Right, right now

I'm down for
Boom, boom boom
Boom boom boom
Sic-sic-sic-sic
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

I require privacy
I'm always thinking finally
Dreaming, feigning

Raised up over out my smoke, black paint
Black, black paint
I am gonna take your coat, say thanks
Black, black paint
Sick people felt light up your eyes somehow
Black, black paint
Those are my Satanic urges right now
Right, right now

I'm down for
Boom, boom boom
Boom, boom boom
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

I require privacy
I'm always thinking finally
Dreaming, feigning
Changing, cheating

Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
Boom, boom, boom boom, boom, boom, boom
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
I don't have enough power
I was staring right at her
Hold, hold, hold
This statue, this statue
Black, black paint
Black, black paint

Black, black paint
Black
You think I could hold
This statue off the balcony
I think I'll stay a while
I think I'll stay a while
Spin the bottle

Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom boom
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom boom
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

I require privacy
I'm always thinking finally
I require privacy
I'm always thinking finally
Dreaming, feigning
Changing, cheating
