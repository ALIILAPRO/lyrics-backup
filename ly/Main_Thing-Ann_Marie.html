		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wanna be your escape
When you feel the walls are closing in
I wanna heal your pain
Baby, you know you can call on me
Baby, we're one in the same
You know I get you like you get me
Boy, fuck what they say
We gon' let 'em hate, yeah

'Cause you know if nobody got you
You know I do
I won't judge you, I got a past too
I won't change only if you stay the same
Yeah make it flood, fuck me real good
Baby, let's just it understood

Wanna be your main thing
I wanna drive you crazy i wanna be your baby
He say, "Bae, you changed me"
I wanna be your main thing
Boy, you know you drive me crazy
Boy, you know you're my baby
He say, "Bae, you changed me"

I wanna be the one you run to
Whatever it is, I got you
You're the first nigga I'm attached to
Got your name on my heart like a tattoo
These other niggas can't get close to me
I love your demeanor, that shit dope to me
You had me the moment you spoke to me
Baby, you don't gotta question my loyalty

'Cause you know if nobody got you
You know I do
I won't judge you, I got a past too
I won't change only if you stay the same
Yeah make it flood, fuck me real good
Baby, let's just it understood

Wanna be your main thing
I wanna drive you crazy i wanna be your baby
He say, "Bae, you changed me"
I wanna be your main thing
Boy, you know you drive me crazy
Boy, you know you're my baby
He say, "Bae, you changed me"

I wanna be your main thing
I wanna drive you crazy
I wanna be your main thing
He say, "Bae, you changed me"
I wanna be your main thing
Boy, you know you drive me crazy
Boy, you know you're my baby
He say, "Bae, you changed me"
