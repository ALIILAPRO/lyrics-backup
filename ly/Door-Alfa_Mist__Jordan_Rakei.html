		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Something there in the corner of my eye
Hidden beneath the sun-kissed sky
Swaying off the trees were the vines
They look like braids in the moonlight
Lights off but cars outside
Is this place still vacant tonight?

Turn the handle just to see what's inside, but, oh
But, oh, to my surprise

It was fate, it was us
When you opened that door
Hold on for me
It's the faith in our love
When I reached out for more
Hold on for me

Something sad seemed to reason with my doubt
Guiding me through the hideout
Thread me a lifeline before I drown
I've been here for a while now
Lights off in the rest of town
Still vacant in the early hours

Turn the handle just to see what's out, but, oh
But oh, to my surprise

It was fate, it was us
When you opened that door
Hold on for me
It's the faith in our love
When I reached out for more
Hold on for me

It was fate, it was us
When you opened that door
Hold on for me
It's the faith in our love
When I reached out for more
Hold on for me
Hold on for me (hold on)
Hold on for me
