		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No never wanna entertain ya
But it's hard keeping myself in restraints, yeah
And I fall back
Then I cave in
Driving 50 in a 30
Need to pace that
Ooo common sense don't
Come easy when it's you against me though
Pour a chaser for the nasty taste you leave, oh
Keep hitting it
All on me though
In and out, like a drive thru
You got me in and out
When I'm coming through
They can't save me
I've fallen too soon
They call me Stacy
Oooo I'm lovin' it
Oooo like a drive thru
Oooo I'm lovin' it
Oooo like a drive thru
You don't be passing out receipts, yeah
You pull your magic oh you're keeping me intrigued, yeah
When you pop out, I be slipping
Caught me stripping dirty naked on the weekends ohh
Party on me uh
You're dripping on tripping on me uh
Alle alle alle ally oop in my hoop
Got me spinning in circles in your room on a loop
In and out, like a drive thru
You got me in and out
When I'm coming through
They can't save me
I've fallen too soon
They call me Stacy
Oooo I'm lovin' it
Oooo like a drive thru
Oooo I'm lovin' it
Oooo like a drive thru
Chase me down
Make me delirious
Close the blinds
We getting serious
Kill the lights
Keep it mysterious
Camp inside
DAMN
In and out, like a drive thru
You got me in and out
When I'm coming through
They can't save me
I've fallen too soon
They call me Stacy
Oooo I'm lovin' it
Oooo like a drive thru
Oooo I'm lovin' it
Oooo like a drive thru
