		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got a lot of things
I have to do
All these distractions
Our futures coming soon
We're being pulled a hundred different directions
But whatever happens I know I've got you

You're on my mind you're in my heart
It doesn't matter where we are
It'll be alright
Even if we're miles apart

All I wanna do, is be with you, be with you
There's nothing we can do just wanna be with you
Only you
No matter where life takes us nothing can break us apart
You know its true
I just wanna be with you

(Be with you)

You know how life can be
It changes over night
It's sunny then raining, but it's alright
A friend like you
Always makes it easy
I know that your kidding me every time

Through every up through every down
You know I'll always be around
Through anything you can count on me

All I wanna do, is be with you, be with you
There's nothing we can do just wanna be with you
Only you
No matter where life takes us nothing can break us apart
You know it's true
I just wanna be with you

I just wanna be with you
