		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, oh yeah oh yeah
Oh oh oh yeah oh yeah
She so bad, caught her walking down the street
Oh yeah, me and shawty gotta meet
She so bad, she ain't even gotta speak
Swear she got it from her hair to her feet

Make up on fleek
Her hair on fleek
Eyebrows on fleek
Her nails on fleek
Yeah, shawty on fleek
Shawty on fleek
Make up on fleek
Her hair on fleek
Eyebrows on fleek
Her nails on fleek
Yeah, shawty on fleek
Shawty on fleek

I was on South street when I seent her
Body of a goddess, she a diva
Everything about her say keeper
Shawty got it all, that's why I just gotta meet her
Her bags say Birkin, yeah
Ass so perfect, yeah
And I can tell just by how it's moving
That she doing it on purpose, yeah
She look like it's real, like Chanel
MAC lipgloss on, I can tell
It's crazy how she look like an angel
But them red bottoms give them bitches hell
I swear she the number one stunner
Can't see them other girls, I don't want them
And plus, she by herself, there's no distractions
So I'm about to go and get her number

She so bad, caught her walking down the street
Oh yeah, me and shawty gotta meet
She so bad, she ain't even gotta speak
Swear she got it from her hair to her feet

Make up on fleek
Her hair on fleek
Eyebrows on fleek
Her nails on fleek
Yeah, shawty on fleek
Shawty on fleek
Make up on fleek
Her hair on fleek
Eyebrows on fleek
Her nails on fleek
Yeah, shawty on fleek
Shawty on fleek (Everything on fleek)

Girl, you on fleek and you know it (know it)
Everything you do, you own it (girl you own it)
All of this money, I'll blow it
All on you, shawty, all on you
Cause your ass on fleek
Yeah, your bag on fleek
You throw that designer on
Yeah, your swag on fleek
I swear you're the baddest girl that I seen all week
God damn, everything on fleek

Her make up on fleek
Hair on fleek
Eyebrows on fleek
Nails on fleek
Shawty on fleek
Shawty on fleek
Oh ah ah
