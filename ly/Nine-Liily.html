		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I smile at my shadow
As it laughs back at me
My hands feel like they're shrinking I can barely feel my feet
Reminds me of old Sunday's when the world on its tee
Never felt so normal but so weird to be a freak

Nine times I've lied
Nine times you've healed
Nine times I wonder why you've ever stayed with me

What if I can't bleed when I cut with your razor
What if I can't see the way you go down
What if I don't know if this is the end all
Nine times I've tried to be with you my dear

If I can paint a picture of the future I would
But darling I can tell you, won't be easy if I could
Never did I feel like I needed relief
From the suffering I went through just to get back on my feet

Nine times I've lied
Nine times you've healed
Nine times I've wonder why you've ever stayed with me
Nine times I've shied away from you
Nine times I've ran away

What if I can't bleed when I cut with your razor
What if I can't see the way you go down
What if I don't know if this is the end all
Nine times I've tried to be with you my dear

Nine times oh I feel it
Nine times oh I feel it
Nine times oh I feel it
Nine times oh good lord I feel it
