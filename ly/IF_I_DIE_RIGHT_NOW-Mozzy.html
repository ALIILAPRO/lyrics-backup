		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's times I wanna be alone
Granny died on the same couch I use to sleep on
I can hear voices that's sayin', "Keep goin'"
(Keep goin', don't stop now, nigga, just keep goin')
Destined for greatness, I been knowin'
Just happy I get to show it, watch hell of my niggas blow it
Apprehended for a blower that carried multiple bodies
Dropped on his lawyer to show him I really got him
Still lil' Tim if you knew me 'fore I was Mozzy
Shit brazy we really made it
Square footage outrageous for this location, overly spacious
Forgiatos sittin' under the spaceship, pure motivation
Wake up every daily and chase it, I'm heartbroken
I had to ask the streets why you break it
All my niggas gon' keep takin' 'em
Overdosin' ain't that far off it's relatable
Held my head high even when I'm incapable
To see how far we take it gon' continue to hustle
Strength and growth was birthed through continuous struggle
Ayy, look what we endured and we still ain't crumble
Still ain't fumbled I know they waitin' for dat
Fuck a hourly wage ain't got the patience for dat
Mama understand she can't save me I'm black
Father understand he can't save me I'm black
Ain't say nothin' 'bout them skits so my gangsta intact
Too broke to leave, felt like I was chained to the trap
Disappointed, whole time we raisin' a rat
Missin' my nigga ain't tryna talk to the sky
We was just makin' plans to live right before bruh died
"I'm short on time," that's what I tell the homies in the pen
That be mad that I won't answer for weeks
Like you don't remember times when I was broke
And I hit you niggas phone for a put on, you ain't answer for me?
Damn it feel to finally land on my feet
Damn it feel good finally stand on my feet
As a man should
Missin' Granny fried chicken with the canned goods
It be the streets that prepare us for our manhood
Had to squabble up, just makin' sure our hands good
You'll never hold me down the way that Ant would

If I die right now 
Is any the niggas I call brothers gon' miss me the way the fans would?
If I die right now 
Is any the niggas I called brothers gon' miss me the way the fans would?

If I die right now 
Is any the niggas I called brothers gon' miss me the way the fans would?
If I die right now 
Is any the niggas I called brothers gon' miss me the way the fans would?
