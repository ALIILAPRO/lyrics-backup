		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It must be nice, it must be nice
To have Washington on your side
It must be nice, it must be nice 
To have Washington on your side

Ev'ry action has its equal, opposite reactions
Thanks to Hamilton, our cab'net's fractured into factions
Try not to crack under the stress, we're breaking down like fractions
We smack each other in the press, and we don't print retractions
I get no satisfaction witnessing his fits of passion
The way he primps and preens and dresses like the pits of fashion
Our poorest citizens, our farmers, live ration to ration
As Wall Street robs 'em blind in search of chips to cash in
This prick is askin' for someone to bring him to task
Somebody gimme some dirt on this vacuous mass so we can at last unmask him
I'll pull the trigger on him, someone load the gun and cock it
While we were all watching, he got Washington in his pocket

It must be nice, it must be nice
To have Washington on your side
It must be nice, it must be nice 
To have Washington on your side

Look back at the Bill of Rights

Which I wrote

The ink hasn't dried
It must be nice, it must be nice
To have Washington on your side

So he's doubled the size of the government
Wasn't the trouble with much of our previous government size

Look in his eyes

See how he lies

Follow the scent of his enterprise

Centralizing national credit
And making American credit competitive

If we don't stop it we aid and abet it

I have to resign

Somebody has to stand up for the South

Somebody has to stand up to his mouth

If there's a fire you're trying to douse

You can't put it out from inside the house

I'm in the cabinet, I am complicit in
Watching him grabbin' at power and kissin' it
If Washington isn't gon' listen
To disciplined dissidents, this is the difference
This kid is out

Oh
This immigrant isn't somebody we chose
Oh
This immigrant's keeping us all on our toes
Oh
Let's show these Federalists who they're up against
Oh

Southern motherfuckin'

Democratic Republicans

Oh

Now follow the money and see where it goes

Oh

Because every second the Treasury grows

Oh

If we follow the money and see where it leads
Get in the weeds, look for the seeds of
Hamilton's misdeeds

It must be nice, it must be nice

Follow the money and see where it goes

It must be nice, it must be nice

The emperor has no clothes

We won't be invisible, we won't be denied
Still
It must be nice, it must be nice
To have Washington on your side
