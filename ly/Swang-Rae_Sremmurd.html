		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mmm, boy, it's nasty (mm-mm)
Know some young niggas like to swang (yeah, mm-mm)
Know some young niggas like to swang
Know some young niggas like to swang (uh)

Know some young niggas like to swang (swang)
Know some young niggas like to swang (swang)
Big bank take lil' bank
Everyday spillin' up drank (drank)
She want the whole crew, shawty brave (brave)
When the money talks, what is there to say? (Just say it)
Blow away, watch it blow away (blow, blow)
When I die can't take it to the grave (yo)

Hop out, drop, top, fuck y'all talkin' I need it right now (hey)
Cash in the air, yeah, what goes up gotta come down (woo)

Gettin' dough ain't a thing change (nothin' change)
Coasting, grippin' grain (Grip)
Goin' thorugh the money like a phase (like a phase)
Don't say my name in vain (woo, woo)
I'm so glad that you came (yeah)
All these bad bitches gettin' slain (slain)
Broke ass nigga get a clue (clue)
All these niggas know how we do (let's go)

Know some young niggas like to swang (swang, swang)
Know some young niggas like to swang (swang, swang)
Big bank take a little bank
Everyday spillin' up drank (drank)
She want the whole crew, shawty brave (Shawty brave)
When the money talks, what is there to say? (what is there to say?)
Blow away, watch it blow away (watch it blow away)
When I die can't take it to the grave (watch it blow away, watch it blow away, blow away)

Hop out, drop, top, fuck y'all talkin' I need it right now
Cash in the air, yeah, what goes up gotta come down (ayy, ayy)

I know some young niggas from the bottom
They'll do anything for a dollar (dollar)
I coulda went to school to be a doctor (doctor)
But I dropped out and chose to be a baller (woo)
Switchin' lanes, spittin' game in my new drop (drop)
Still on a paper chase that don't ever stop (never)
Everybody with me family, that's how we rock (rock, rock)
Party at the mansion, we bout to flood the spot
Sremmlife!

Know some young niggas like to swang (swang, swang)
Know some young niggas like to swang (swang, swang)
Big bank take a little bank
Everyday spillin' up drank (drank)
She want the whole crew, shawty brave (Shawty brave)
When the money talks, what is there to say? (what is there to say?)
Blow away, watch it blow away (watch it blow away)
When I die can't take it to the grave (watch it blow away, watch it blow away, blow away)
