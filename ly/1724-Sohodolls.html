		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You took me to regents park,
It was chill and it was dark.

You took me to regents park,
It was chill and it was dark.

With your lips on top of mine,
And your blonde hair and blue eyes.

With your lips on top of mine,
And your blonde hair and blue eyes.

We went out to see live bands,
In the shadows of my hand.

We went out to see live bands,
In the shadows of my hand.

Typical north south collide,
Love to hit you, hate to fight.

Typical north south collide,
Love to hit you, hate to fight.
