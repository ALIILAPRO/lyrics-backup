		  Un
Twa
Triet
Feuer
You know, it feels good
To stay out this late
The last guy I knew
Said be home by eight
You know it's gettin' hard
To not come up to you
Cause when I heard your voice
You threw me out of tune
What do I do yeah
What do I do yeah
What do I do yeah
What do I do
And oh, shit
I think it's time that I admit
You're just my type
Do you get it
So I gotta ask
Do you like the girl in red
And god damn
Things are getting way out of hand
And in the background there's a baby grand
Hyping me up
So I just stood there and said
You know I really like you
But are you like
You know
She walks away and laughs
And I feel like an ass
So then I go back home
I don't check my phone
I woke up the next day
A DM said hey
It was the girl from that
Party that I was at
What do I do yeah
What do I do oh
What do I do yeah
What do I do
I said hey sorry if I was too straightforward
She said no it's not that honestly I was honored
I said then why'd you turn away
And sneer
She said it's just that we already went on a date last year
Oh shit
I fucked this one up I will admit
I've got the memory of a goldfish
But since I'm here now do you wanna try this one again
And GOD DAMN
She tells me we had a one night stand
And if she recalls it was quite grand
But I fucking swear that I've never seen her before
No no no no no
Hold on hold on hold on
Since I saw her like a year before
She grew out her hair
And she like started wearing makeup again
So then I didn't feel like such a fucking asshole for not recognizing her
That's a lil problematic Rio, dontcha think
