		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Even though I changed)
(Doesn't mean you changed)
(I was just supposed to change)

(Even though I changed)
(Doesn't mean you changed)
(You ain't never gonna change)
(Ever, ever gonna change)
(Look at you)

So many things are changing
I'm in world that's breaking, my heart
No longer feel the same things
So if I fall, just save me from myself

Honestly
Honesty
Is the rarest thing alive
I just need your belief
Then I'll be fine

How do you run before learning to walk?
How to have faith before taking the fall
Without the night the sun couldn't show you
Her light
Her light
Her light
Her light, oh

(Even though I changed)
(Doesn't mean you changed)
(You ain't never gonna change)
(Ever, ever gonna change)
(Look at you)

There ain't no competition
When you trust intuition, you win
Just close your eyes and listen
Get out the stupid system, somehow

Honestly
Honesty
Is the rarest thing alive
I just need your belief
Then I'll be fine

How do you run before learning to walk?
How to have faith before taking the fall
Without the night the sun couldn't show you
Her light
Her light

How do you run before learning to walk?
How to have faith before taking the fall (gotta have faith)
Without belief, the sun couldn't show you
Her light
Her light
Her light
Her light, oh

Her light
Her light
Her light
Her light
Her light
Her light
Her light
Her light
Her light
Her light
Her light
Her light
Her light
Her light
