		  (Hitkidd, what it do, man?)
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Spend that shit, I'm worth it (hmm)
Thick, look better in person (mmh)
Hair, nails, match my Birkin (yeah)
I don't block hoes, keep lurking, ah
Real hot girl shit (yeah, yeah)
This pussy bomb (yeah), explosive (baow)
It's soaking (ah), osmosis (mwah)
I'm stompin' on hoes so muhfuckin' hard
I'm knockin' out Mario tokens (baow, baow, baow)
Your bitch, she regular (yeah)
I'm hot, be careful (ha, tss, ha)
She average (yeah), I'm pressure, yeah (I'm pressure)

I'm pressure, I'm pressurelicious, yeah (mwah)
I'm pressure, I'm pressure, I'm pressurelicious, yeah
She pressurelicious and I crave it
Take a picture of my bag
Now these bitches pressed to get it (now these bitches pressed to get it)
Take a picture, shake my ass
Now your nigga pressed to hit it, pressurelicious (baow, baow-baow-baow)

If it's worth it, I'm booking a jet
If it's worth it, I'm spending a check
I done broke out a switch
I done put a whole thing in your chest
When we fuckin', we makin' a mess, yes
Back stroke, left stroke, deep stroke, your throat
Slow stroke, shawty know that's a go (ayy)

He know I'm really square business
I pull up, the AMG tinted, working him out
He sweatin' like it's been hours, it only been a few minutes
He say he toxic, I said, "Okay, well, I'm poison" 
Spit in my mouth, I enjoy it, talk my shit
I'ma pull a him on him, don't play, I am not one of them (ah)

I'm pressurelicious, yeah (mwah)
I'm pressure, I'm pressure, I'm pressurelicious, yeah
She pressurelicious and I crave it
Take a picture of my bag
Now these bitches pressed to get it (now these bitches pressed to get it)
Take a picture, shake my ass
Now your nigga pressed to hit it, pressurelicious (baow, baow-baow)

Between my pussy and this drip
You might wanna watch out, nigga, don't slip (nigga, don't slip)
I'm talkin' 'bout tight, I'm talkin' 'bout grip (hey, hey)
I'm stackin' up more than a Blood and a Crip (Blood and the Crip)
Niggas admire the way that I'm built
Might let him spank it and give me a whip (spank it and give me a whip)
I ain't doing nothin' extra, this is strictly for my pleasure, ah

I'm puttin' it down on an Adderall
Went for two hours on Adderall
Went for three hours on Adderall
Hit it, four hours on Adderall
Piping you down on an Adderall
Piping it up on an Adderall
Knocking you off on an Adderall
Pussy so good, I eat it
Five in the morning, I need it
Knocking the bed off the hinges
Get in your mouth like a dentist
Really I belong in the Guinness
Pressure, she good for the image
I put her in vintage
I'ma take care of the business
Drop a bag, it hit different
I'ma give away my thots for a rich bitch, woo
Fuck me and call me toxic, she no different
Every time I pull out my cock, she gon' kiss it
Mouthing me off in the car, she just kiss it (mwah)

I'm pressurelicious, yeah (mwah)
I'm pressure, I'm pressure, I'm pressurelicious, yeah
She pressurelicious and I crave it
Take a picture of my bag
Now these bitches pressed to get it (now these bitches pressed to get it)
Take a picture, shake my ass
Now your nigga pressed to hit it, pressurelicious (baow)

Hold up (ooh), I'ma put my demon in her veins, for sure (hey)
Ayy, you know I like Chanel, daddy, keep me in Coco ('Co)
I'ma hit it and I'm gon' keep on all my chains, for sure (whoa)
Gotta treat these niggas like birds, I get that bread, then I go, ah (whoa, whoa, ah)
