I'm-I'm, yeah, runnin', runnin' outta time
For real, fuck
Runnin', runnin' outta time

Yo, listen up

Yeah, shit all used to be fine

It's gettin' harder to climb
I'm runnin', runnin' outta time
Shit, fuck
Runnin', runnin' outta time
I'm, yeah, runnin', runnin' outta
Yo
Shit all used to be fine
Now it's sour like lime
This shit is fuckin' with my mind
I'm runnin', runnin' outta time
For real, yeah
Runnin', runnin' out of time
I'm, yeah, runnin', runnin' outta

A misfit
Conflicted
Yeah, kinda twisted
Grim Reaper kissed him
Shit, think he's addicted
Hold up, yo
Is that a line he's sniffin'?
For real
Shit, fuck was he thinkin' (thinkin')
Yeah, man is missin' (missin')
All these drugs that he's mixing (mixing)
All these things that he's wishing (wishing)
Never came to fruition (yeah)
Yeah, fuck
Shit came back to trip him (yeah)
Yeah, yeah, uh, uh

Shit all used to be fine
Now my card gets declined
It's gettin' harder to climb
I'm runnin', runnin' outta time
Yeah, yeah, uh
Runnin', runnin' outta time
I'm, yeah, runnin', runnin' outta
Yo
Shit all used to be fine
Now it's sour like lime
This shit is fuckin' with my mind
I'm runnin', runnin' outta time
For real
Runnin', runnin' out of time
I'm, yeah, runnin', runnin' outta

I lost it
Yeah, never listen (ooh yeah)
Yeah, kinda flopped it (ooh yeah)
He failed the mission (ooh yeah)
Shit lacked 'tuition
Yeah
Like why is he fishin'
The fuck is he lookin' for over there? (Yeah, yeah)
Uh, he was looking for the light
He was looking for the flame
He was looking for the spark
He was looking for the lane
Looking for the shame, looking for the dark
Looking for the fame, looking for the pedal
Tryna numb the pain
Looking for the stars, studying the game

Yeah, shit all used to be fine
Now my card gets declined
It's gettin' harder to climb
I'm runnin', runnin' outta time
Shit, fuck
Runnin', runnin' outta time
I'm, yeah, runnin', runnin' outta
Yo
Shit all used to be fine
Now it's sour like lime
This shit is fuckin' with my mind
I'm runnin', runnin' outta time
For real, yeah
Runnin', runnin' out of time
I'm, yeah, runnin', runnin' outta
