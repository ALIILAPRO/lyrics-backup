		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No, you're too caught up 'tryna notice him noticing you
To see how I've been giving too much
(No, I shouldn't reach for love)
But I'm too caught up analyzing the things you say
'Stead of listening to the way you talk
(It just confirms that I've lost)

I've been using all my nights
Spend every second wondering 'bout the heights
Waste all my time ignoring all the clear signs
No, you were never ready for us
It's selfish thinking it was

'Cause you're too caught up on the drama from yesterday
While I'm thinking 'bout everything we have
Wish you could see all the plans
That I've been caught up 'tryna organize in my head
While you're still thinking if he said enough
I wish I knew when to stop, stop, stop, oh

Using all my nights
Spend every second wondering 'bout the heights
Waste all my time ignoring all the clear signs
No, you were never ready for us
It's selfish thinking it was

'Cause I needed someone who cared
You needed somebody there
I said things I couldn't bear for anybody else
I wish I left it alone
'Cause now I'm needing to know
Was I the one or just a fill-in for another soul?

Just a fill-in for another soul
'Cause now I'm needing to know
Was I the one or just a fill-in for another soul?

Yeah, I've been racing through my mind again
Stuck overthinking all the time I spent
Yeah, been holding on to every shred of hope
So girl, I'm needing to know, know, know

I needed someone who cared
You needed somebody there
I said things I couldn't bear for anybody else
I wish I left it alone
'Cause now I'm needing to know
Was I the one or just a fill-in for another soul?

Just a fill-in for another soul
'Cause now I'm needing to know
Was I the one or just a fill-in for another soul?
