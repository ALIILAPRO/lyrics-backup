		  Yo, this is Nappy Roy Radio live
With your boy T-Pain, we love rap music
Listen, uh, we got a caller on line one
Caller, what's your problem?
"Hello, I'm on the radio with T-Pain"
How's it goin'? Yeah
"It ain't goin' good
My girl ain't doin' the things she used to do at all"
I got just what you need
Brand new Chris Brown, T-Pain
You heard it here first, Nappy Boy Radio (what them boys gonna do for me?)
We love you (ah)

Hey, she want that lovey-dovey (lovey-dovey)

In her mind she fantasize
'Bout getting with me
They hating on me (hating on me)
They wanna diss this (diss this)
Because she mine and so fine
And thick as can be

Hey, she want that lovey-dovey (lovey-dovey)
That kiss kiss (kiss kiss)
In her mind she fantasize
'Bout getting with me
They hating on me (hating on me)
They wanna diss this (diss this)
Because she mine and so fine
And thick as can be

I'm a country boy from Tappahannock
V.A. is where I reside so shawty understand it
And I know I just turn eighteen
And I get a little mannish
And you see this bandanna hanging

You never seen it
So get it, shawty
We parking lot pimping in my donk
And I know what you want (hey)

She want that lovey-dovey (lovey-dovey)
That kiss kiss (kiss kiss)
In her mind she fantasize
'Bout getting with me
They hating on me (hating on me)
They wanna diss this (diss this)
Because she mine and so fine 
And thick as can be

Hey, she want that lovey-dovey (lovey-dovey)
That kiss kiss (kiss kiss)
In her mind she fantasize
'Bout getting with me
They hating on me (hating on me)
They wanna diss this (diss this)
Because she mine and so fine (whoa)
And thick as can be

I'm the epitome of this demonstration
I got the remedy, you feeling me
So why is you hating?
And my anatomy is birdlike
Yeah, you heard right
Girl, I'm the king so that means I'm fly

If you wit' it, girl

Roll with me

So get it, shawty
We parking lot pimping in my donk
