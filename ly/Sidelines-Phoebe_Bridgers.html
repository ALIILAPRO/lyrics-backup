		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm not afraid of anything at all
Not dying in a fire, not being broke again
I'm not afraid of living on a fault line
'Cause nothing ever shakes me, nothing makes me cry

Not a plane going down
In the ocean and drowning

Watched the world from the sidelines
Had nothing to prove
'Til you came into my life
Gave me something to lose
Now I know what it feels like
To wanna go outside
Like the shape of my outline

I'm not afraid of going back to school
I gave it up the first time, but I'll try again
I'm not afraid of getting older
Used to fetishize myself
Now I'm talking to my house plants

Not of being alone, oh
In a room full of people

Watching the world from the sidelines
Had nothing to prove
'Til you came into my life
Gave me something to lose
Now I know what it feels like
To want to go outside
Like the shape of my outline

And I used to think
You could hear the ocean in a seashell
What a childish thing
