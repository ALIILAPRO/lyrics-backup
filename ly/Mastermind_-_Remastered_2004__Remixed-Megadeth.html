		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Anonymous existence, rendered useless to mankind 
Destroy the logic volume in the confines of the mind 
En massed and purposeless, marching in a perfect line 
Neo-neuro torture, mental meltdown, a heinous crime 
Mastermind, I tell you what to think 
I tell you what you need 
I tell what to feel 
Invade the core of souls to wipe the lives away 
Design vacant beings, welcome the inhuman race 
Encrypted horror codes, directive psyche overwrite 
Processing brains to pabulum 
Delete and format living drives 
I tell you what's real 
Hail to the power age, lest the viral hour comes 
Raise the flag of voltage, bow to circuitry unknown 
Kneel before the processor, lords of static laugh 
Electrons in submission, you must know who I am 
I tell you what to think 
I don't care what you thought 
I tell you what to get 
I don't care what you got 
Mastermind
I don't care what you got
Mastermind
Mastermind
Mastermind
