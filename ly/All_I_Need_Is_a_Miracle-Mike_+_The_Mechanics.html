		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I said go if you want to go
Stay if you want to stay
I didn't care if you hung around me
I didn't care if you went away
And I know you were never right
I'll admit I was never wrong
I could never make up my mind
I made it up as I went along

And though I treated you like a child
I'm gonna miss you for the rest of my life

All I need is a miracle, all I need is you
All I need is a miracle, all I need is you
All I need is a miracle, all I need is you

I never had any time
And I never had any call
But I went out of my way just to hurt you
The one I shouldn't hurt at all
I thought I was being cool
Yeah, I thought I was being strong
But it's always the same old story
You never know what you've got 'til it's gone

If I ever catch up with you
I'm gonna love you for the rest of your life

All I need is a miracle, all I need is you
(All I need is a miracle) all I need is a miracle, all I need is you
(All I need is a miracle) all I need is a miracle, all I need is you

And if I ever catch up with you
I'm gonna love you for the rest of your life

All I need is a miracle, all I need is you
(All I need is a miracle) all I need is a miracle, all I need is you
(All I need is a miracle) all I need is a miracle, all I need is you
(All I need is a miracle) all I need is a, all I need is a
(All I need is a miracle) all I need is you 
(All I need is a miracle) all I need is you (all I need is a miracle)
(All I need is a miracle, all I need is a miracle
(All I need is a miracle) all I need is a miracle
(All I need is a miracle)
