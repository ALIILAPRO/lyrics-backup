		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  An adorable star, we can see from afar
But a truth it belies
All who enters her dies
Hear the beating of wings as the pendulum swings
And we can't believe it's ever gonna end

You know blood is thicker than water
But you just want everyone to get along

For the candles in the darkness
Burning up the sorrow
There's no end to sadness
We didn't learn
For the broken hearted people
Diamonds now surround us
So out of our mind
Leave the past behind

We're a binary heart
Tear each other apart
Growing from the same stem
They were us, we were them
On a course to collide
Is it strength not to hide?
Let the politics decide, you're not a friend

You know blood is thicker than water
But you just want everyone to get along

For the candles in the darkness
Burning up the sorrow
There's no end to sadness
We didn't learn
For the broken hearted people
Diamonds now surround us
So out of our mind
Leave the past behind

Binary, a centrifugal force
Pushing us far away, that's our eternity
Binary, we can't escape the force
Crushing us, gravity is our eternity

For the candles in the darkness
Burning up the sorrow
There's no end to sadness
We didn't learn
For the broken hearted people
Diamonds now surround us
So out of our mind
Leave the past behind

For the candles in the darkness
Burning up the sorrow
There's no end to sadness
We didn't learn
For the broken hearted people
Diamonds now surround us
So out of our mind
Leave the past behind

Binary, a centrifugal force
Pushing us far away, that's our eternity
Binary, we can't escape the force
Crushing us, gravity is our eternity
