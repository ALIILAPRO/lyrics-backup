		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I saw a pic of you, without a ponytale
At night I think of you, no matter the details
But since we said goodbye
I finally feel alright
It's just like seeing the sunrise but without you by my side, and now
I know, it's better this way, so many things to say and
I, remember that day, I won't forget that face
And you, you were the poison not the medicine that when i was on my knees, you tried and took me everything
I deleted your photos
I cancelled your number
I'm feeling so stuck
(Because at the same time i'm wasting half of my life)
And now i'm feeling so focused
I'm searching an answer
This world is confused and
I'm learning the lesson
(A diamond born under pressure)
I tried the fucking impossible but it wasn't enough
I tried to remember the promise you made me when I was lost
And while I was in my bed screaming and crying and calling your name again and again you packed your bags and went away with your friends
'Cause I feel broken
This life unspoken
'Cause I feel broken
This life unspoken
Made us alone (woo woo)
So it's no longer the time for
The time for
The time for us
But I'm not ready to go
And say goodbye
Goodbye
I've been treated like a fool
Enough of being misunderstood
Sick of all your lies again and again
I feel lost
The loneliness now starts to get loud
And it's fading you away
Did it have to go this way?
Did distance kill us, or did we kill ourselves?
Why didn't it go another way?
But I still wonder if I feel lonelier nowâ€¦
'Cause I feel broken
This life unspoken
Made us alone (woooo)
So it's no longer the time for
The time for
The time for us
And now i'm ready to go
And say goodbye
And say goodbye
