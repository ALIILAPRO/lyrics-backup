		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Alright
Everybody listen
Listen to the melody
'Cause we need each and everyone of you
To go long with the song
You ready?
Sing it with me

When we go up
We do it loud
They never believe what we're talking about

When we go up
We do it loud
They never believe what we're talking about

When we go up
We do it loud
When we go up
We do it loud
When we go up
We do it loud

Snare to the kick to the bass makes them jump

When we go up
We do it loud
They never believe what we're talking about

When we go up
We do it loud
They never believe what we're talking about

When we go up
When we go up
When we go up
When we go up
When we go up
When we go up

Snare to the kick to the bass makes them jump
