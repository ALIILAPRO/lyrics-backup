		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  VERSE 1: ABHI & JAY]
novocaine all my days feeling numb
propane raps, Hank Hill with the thumb
slow days, on my own way to the grave
I’ma cold case, no cocaine on the gum
see me down under up down slam down with the thunder
ice cold moves, booth hot like the summer
grind on a hunnid times two
in the box locked up, go-ing up till we run it
It’s just me verse the universe, I run it
and we done one hundred percent to gain damn near 
nothing
but fuck it, you can’t stomach the work, you won’t serve 
me a word, keep running
get a taste of the falls, hit the walls, on the daily
pacing phases, to my face, nothing faze me
besides the lot of things on my mind i need to say
bit afraid, so I guess they can wait just another day
I think I might be A-okay
If I wait just another day
[CHORUS: JAY]
I got to tell ya
getting blinded by the lights
I got to tell ya
bout the chaos in my mind
I got to tell ya
all these nights we’re not together
forgot to tell ya
[VERSE 2: ABHI & JAY]
I got to tell you, I ain’t tryna make no promise 
not nothing that could weigh down conscious
pay the bills and the rest fi ll pockets
still sometimes you be obnoxious
just want it diff erent when i’m having you around me, 
all night, no sleep, we down here
whenever we here, no problems
losing track o’ time, till it fi nds us
down with ya till I make me a thousand
white picket fences, pool house loungin,
sounding good to me if you round with it
I kill the demons we hit the ground running
my stress gon’ need a vest round the chest
reshape my world in 7 days or less
on the chase like the days, chased ice cream 
trucks
got us moving fast but it’s never enough
chorus x2
