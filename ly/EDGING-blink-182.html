		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I ain't that cool, a little fucked in the head
They'll be hangin' me quick when I'm back from the dead
Get the rope, get the rope
Get the rope, get the rope
I'm a punk rock kid, I came from hell with a curse
She tried to pray it away, so I fucked her in church
Don't you know? Don't you know?
Don't you know? Yeah, don't you know?

They say
"You're not safe here if I stay
With a knife that sharp, no way"

No, I leave them broken-hearted
Oh no, look at the mess we started
Oh no, I lead the broken hearts this way (this way)
Whatcha say? (Whatcha say?)
Wanna play?

Yeah, don't be fooled, I'm only lettin' you down
They pursued me on foot, but I hid in the crowd
Like a ghost, like a ghost
Like a ghost, like a ghost
The seats of my car are filled with cigarette burns
I got a fire in my eye, a little blood on my shirt
Let's hit the road, hit the road
Hit the road, hit the road

I know
There's a special place in hell
That my friends and I know well
There's a perfect place to go
When it's time to lose control

No, I leave them broken-hearted
Oh no, look at the mess we started
Oh no, I lead the broken hearts this way (this way)
Whatcha say? (Whatcha say?)
Wanna play?

Nightmare, daydream (no, oh no, oh no, oh no)
You can't save me (oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no)

No way, no, I leave them broken-hearted
Oh no, look at the mess we started
Oh no, I lead the broken hearts this way (shit)
Oh no, I leave them broken hearted
Oh no, look at the mess we started
Oh no, I lead the broken hearts this way
Whatcha say? Every day
It's a waste, wanna play?
