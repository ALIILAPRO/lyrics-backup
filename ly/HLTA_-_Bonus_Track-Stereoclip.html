		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  On the one hand you let go of everything and you live in the eternal now because that's all there is,
you see, memory is an illusion, it's all gone, so everything you know about that makes an impression on you it's no longer there thats the meaning of Maya
there is only the eternal now, there's only the present moment, never would be anything else
because even what you remembering it's happening in the present, the memory is in the eternal now isn't it, you see
so it all really absolutely here
but on the other hand what's fun
to drag it out and to make it echo and to get involved and to fall in love and to become attached
it's just like riding a bicycle, it's a balance trick
