		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  At the mantle of the heart, a river flows inside
We drain ourselves in steady streams, until the river runs dry
At times these tides define us, deny us of ourselves
A finite source of optimism that leaves a hollow shell
And as the seasons pass, and winter's numbing cold gives way to pain
We light these fires to sit beside as we pray like hell for rain 

But when the night grows cold, and when the fire fades
At the hour before the dawn, the last embers burn til day
It's all I hang my hope upon you can't take that away from me

Every morning in the mirror I see my worst enemy reflected in me
Cos I'm a born unbeliever, a cynical soul, I can only trust as far as I see

But every time I close my eyes, I'm who I used to be
I never thought I'd feel so cold, until the fire faded out in me

I've never felt so cold

Such sacrifice for so little to show
To learn these lessons I never wanted to know
That we will all die alone, 
And how my blood remains on the tip of the blade as it severs the flesh from the bone
So far beyond the below

I was there when they sowed the seed
I was there when the rats came out to feed
And when the rain came, it extinguished the flame in me

As I slept, the seeds of doubt were sown
I tore my heart apart for this, 
In hopes my light would grow

And I dreamt about a place where all our virtue could withstand
I woke in fright, appalled to find the blood was on my hands 

But every time I close my eyes, I'm who I used to be
I never thought I'd feel so cold, until the fire faded out in me

I've never felt so cold
