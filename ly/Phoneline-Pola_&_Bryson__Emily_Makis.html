		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In the party, tryna disconnect
Out of body, in my element
Nearly flying, ready to transcend
Then I hear my phone ring and it's you again

Complaining, so restraining
Won't you loosen your grip
Need space here, solo raving
Give me less of your lip and pace it
Cool it with the statements
Cool it with the sensitive, but no
I still hear the tone

You must be out of your mind
Blowing me up on my Phoneline
(Why you blowing up my Phoneline)
Call me and I'ma decline
(I'm gon' decline)
And I'm gon' get back in my own time
Won't lie, I'm about to leave you on silent

(Out of your mind)
I'm about to leave you on silent
(Why you blowing up my phoneline)
Call me and I'ma decline
And I'm gon' get back in my own time
Won't lie, I'm about to leave you on silent

(Out my head)

Still in the party, tryna disconnect
But you gon' stop me
You won't get out my head
So cool it with the statements
Cool it with the sensitive, but no
I still hear the tone

You must be out of your mind
(Out of your mind)
Blowing me up on my phoneline
(Why you blowing up my phoneline)
Call me and I'ma decline
(I'm gon' decline)
And I'm gon' get back in my own time
Won't lie, I'm about to leave you on silent

I'm about to leave you on silent
(Why you blowing up my phoneline)
Call me and I'ma decline
And I'm gon' get back in my own time…

It’s you, you or this
Real or bliss
I can hardly follow
You wanna take
My one escape
Like we can’t talk tomorrow

You, you or this
Real or bliss
I can hardly follow
You wanna take
My one escape

I’m about to leave you on silent
