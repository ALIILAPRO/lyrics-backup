		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wish that everything just came easy babe
Wish that you
Wish that you just tell me what it's like
Wish that everything just came easy babe
So much love for you
So much love for you
So much love
But you mess up my head
Get out my bed
Don't know what to say
Don't know what to say
But you mess up my head
Get out my bed
Don't know what to say
Can't seem to say the words it's all over
Still wanna get closer
Closer to you baby
And I can't feel a thing
I can't feel a thing
My bae stuck in my mind
Baby it won't stop
All of these roadblocks
We seem to go off on everything
Though we know that
Can't seem to hold back
Know we got each other to blame
Know we got each other to blame now
Girl it feels like you wanna runaway now
Don't you say it's okay now
Cause it feels like you wanna runaway now
Don't you say it's okay
No it ain't right baby
We ain't fine yeah
Yeah
Wish that everything just came easy babe
Wish that you
Wish that you just tell me what it's like
Wish that everything just came easy babe
So much love for you
So much love for you
So much love
But you mess up my head
Get out my bed
Don't know what to say
Don't know what to say
But you mess up my head
Get out my bed
Don't know what to say
