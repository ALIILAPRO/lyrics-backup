		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Christ, why you picking up your phone this late?
I only called you 'cause I knew that it 5AM in LA
She tell me he gon' flip me like he flip his cousins back South
But she don't know that I went from cunt to dick early this month
I hate it when crater face creator of the human race
Come to me in my wet dreams and try to tell me to give face
I met a ho back home talking soliloquy's, made of silicone
Her bones overlapped, she was like a rake in his lap
When you leave me I need to go take my mind off your dick
Get some yogurt covered pretzels and a pound of a clit
But that don't mean that you can leave me
Just to leave me this way
I'm still a hot topic on the black market
Currency favourite these days
She think I'm current 'cause they call me a contemporary slug
The kind that leave no trace, remorse
Go down with my shirt buttoned up
I don't lean on you, you lean on me, I'm skinny, call that Maybelline
Site specific to my picnic, fork and knife when I get thicket
But you wouldn't know that 'cause we ain't gon' through that
Canadian school girl land act, connected anime drool black

Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
Angelina? Is that you?
Thought I seen ya? Mmmhmm

Let me put my hands on your knees, I'm Angelina Jolie
Hands on your knees, Angelina Jolie
Lemme put my hands on your knees, you can braid my hair
Do a fat criss cross in the back somewhere, ha

I'm a chew up that up, slew of medium sized businesses
Get my eyes on the candidates running for presidencies
Set a good president in my school girl tribe
We hang from trees like we apples in the Eden vibe
I'm a business meeting on judgement day
When the heavens open up to the birds of prey
With an orange wedge smile on a poster bitch
Now you bird watchers wonder why they call me bitch

Angelina? Is that you?
Thought I seen ya? Mmmhmm
