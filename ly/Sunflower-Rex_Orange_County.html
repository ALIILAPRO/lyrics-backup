		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  Whoa
I want to know where I can go
When you're not around and I'm feeling down
So won't you stay for a moment so I can say
I
I need you so, 'cause right now, you know
That nothing here's new, and I'm obsessed with you
Then I fell to the ground and you smiled at me and said

I don't wanna see you cry, mm-mm
You don't have to feel this emptiness
She said, "I'll love you 'til the day that I die"
Well, maybe she's right
'Cause I don't wanna feel like I'm not me
And to be honest, I don't even know why
I let myself get down in the first place

Tryna keep my mind at bay
Sunflower still grows at night
Waitin' for a minute 'til the sun's seen through my eyes
Diggy-down, down, do-down-down
Diggy-dig-down, do-do-do-roo
Waitin' for a minute 'til the sun's seen through my eyes

You know you need to get yourself to sleep
And dream a dream of you and I
There's no need to keep an open eye
I promise I'm the one for you
Just let me hold you in these arms tonight
I'm lucky to be me and you can see it in my face
Back when I fucked my shit up too many times
Why would I let myself get down in the first place?

Tryna keep my mind at bay
Sunflower still grows at night
Waitin' for a minute 'til the sun's seen through my eyes
Diggy-down, down, do-down-down
Diggy-dig-down, do-do-do-roo
Waitin' for a minute 'til the sun's seen through my eyes

And so she sat me down and told me that I didn't have to cry
Said I didn't need to get down or feel empty inside
And then told me that she'll love me for as long as she's alive
And well, maybe she's right
'Cause I hate it when I feel like I'm not me
See, I honestly don't even know why
I, I honestly don't even know why

Tryna keep my mind at bay
Sunflower still grows at night
Waitin' for a minute 'til the sun's seen through my eyes
Diggy-down, down, do-down-down
Diggy-dig-down, do-do-do-roo
Waitin' for a minute 'til the sun's seen through my eyes
