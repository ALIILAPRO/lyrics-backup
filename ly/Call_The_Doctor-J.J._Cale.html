		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Somebody call for the doctor, 
I think I'm sick
Ain't had my medicine 
In over a week
My mind's fine but 
My body feels weak
Call the doctor, 
I think I'm sick

A shady lady took 
All my bread
Ravished my body, lord, 
And messed with my head
I don't know but 
I've had my fill
Call the doctor 
And tell him I'm ill

My money's gone and 
I've got no place to go
I don't believe 
I've ever felt so low
If you've got the time 
While you hang around
Call the doctor 
And tell him I'm down
