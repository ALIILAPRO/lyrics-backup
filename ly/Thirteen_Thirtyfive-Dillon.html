		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Strongest taste
Loudest drop
Head is filled
The thought, unlocked

Strongest taste
Loudest drop
Head is filled
The thought, unlocked

Strongest taste
Loudest drop
Head is filled
The thought, unlocked

Strongest taste
Loudest drop
Head is filled

You'd be thirteen
I'd be thirty-five
Gone to find a place for us to hide

Be together, but alone
As the need for it has grown

You'd be thirteen
I'd be thirty-five
Gone to find a place for us to hide

Be together, but alone
As the need for it has grown, yeah

Cha cha, cha cha, cha cha
Cha cha, cha cha

A cave or a shed
A car or a bed
A hole in the ground
Or a burial mound
A bush or a tree
Or the aegean sea, will do for me

Cha cha, cha cha, cha cha
Cha cha, cha cha, ha

I can say that you look pretty
You turn my legs into spaghetti
You set my heart on fire

For you I found a vent
In the bottom of a coal mine
Just enough space for your hands in the inside

If you go
Do let me know

You'd be thirteen
I'd be thirty-five
Gone to find a place for us to hide

A den or a dessert
Perhaps an ink squirt
A cellar, a wishing well, a war
Or a guarantee, will do for me

For you I found a cell
On the top floor of a prison
Just enough space for you to fit your feet in

If you go
Do let me know

For you I found a cell
On the top floor of a prison
Just enough space for you to fit your feet in

If you go
Please let me know

I go running with a heart on fire
