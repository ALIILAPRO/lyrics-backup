		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Trust all the things
I tell you are true
Dress up in your best
So I can be proud of you

And never believe I won't turn on you
And never believe I do this for you

you're leading me on again,
And I find it,
Yeah I like it
And I'm reeling in awe for sure,
Now I know it was given to me,
Given to me, given to me

How I wish I could
Be rid of this ennui
Make you regret and,
Make you afraid of me

And never believe I do this for me
And never believe Ill do this gently

you're leading me on again,
And I find it,
Yeah I like it
I'm reeling in awe for sure,
Now I know it was given to me,
Given to me, given to me

you're leading me on again,
And I find it,
Yeah I like it
I'm reeling in awe for sure,
Now I know it was given to me,
Given to me, given to me

can't believe in broken promises
And render conscious all of me
Ill tell you its all for you
Then deny it

you're leading me on again,
And I find it,
Yeah I like it
I'm reeling in awe for sure,
Now I know it was given to me,
Given to me, given to me
