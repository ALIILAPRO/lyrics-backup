		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Blessings, blessings on blessings
On God, God, God
Woo
(Sad Pony)
God, God, God (BNYX)

There's a river that I go to and it heals me
Recently became a mama and it thrills me
Even when the water's rocky and it chills me
When He tells me to be still, somehow it stills me
Ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah (God, God, God)
Ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, oh (God, God, God)

Blessings, blessings on blessings
On God, God, God (oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Blessings, blessings on blessings
On God, God, God

I know I can really say, "I'm truly proud of you"
And no matter what they say, I never doubted you
I completely understand what you gotta do, ooh
Do what you gotta do

There's a river that I go to and it heals me
My cup runneth over it, ain't never empty
Even when I give it my all, I still have plenty
Stop beatin' up on yourself, handle it gently

Blessings, blessings on blessings
On God, God, God
Blessings, blessings on blessings
On God, God, God

There's a river that I run to when I'm empty
It keeps flowin' every mornin', grace and mercy
When I'm walkin' through the valley, I will not fear
I will never be convinced that He is not there, oh
Be courageous
He never changes
There's a Father who is present and He sees us
Make no mistake about it, his name is Jesus (Jesus)

Blessings, blessings on blessings
On God, God, God
Blessings, blessings on blessings
On God, God, God (ooh)

When I was five, I got down on my knees and prayed to you
I found my peace in Your presence, I put my faith in You
I saw the blessings come down when I start praisin' You
You gave me spiritual gifts I was afraid to use
Ain't never leave me (leave me)
Always receives me ('ceives me)
That's why they can't get me
I know He is always with me (He's always with me)

Blessings, blessings on blessings
Every single day (on God, God, God)
He is always with me
Blessings, blessings on blessings
Every single day, yeah (on God, God, God)
(God, God, God)
(God, God, God)
