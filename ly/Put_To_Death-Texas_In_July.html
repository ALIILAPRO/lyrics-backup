		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Spread the weight, find the balance with time
Find out the footing is feigned (the footing is feigned)
Take a fall, scratch the skin unscathed
Combat commotion on the climb

Miles and miles, retracing the steps
Of previous footprints that marched to their death
Cautious to the fatigue that's creeping in
The calamity upon us is spinning on its head

The seal is broken at the entryway
Yet passage is held up at the start
Secrets drafted on an empty page
Long written things that we forgot (that we forgot)

Rectify crippled pieces forced to fit
Who only wanted some guidance
Terminate masses marched for death
Resisting form in defiance
Put to death
Put to death

We never said the truth was easy
But something must be said
We never said the truth was easy
But that's all we have left
You'll want it in the end

Miles and miles, retracing the steps
Of previous footprints that marched to their death
Cautious to the fatigue that's creeping in
The calamity upon us is spinning on its head

Mindless (mindless) marching (marching)
To their death (to their death)
Seeking (seeking) solace from this desolate wasteland
Miles and miles, retracing the steps
Of previous footprints that marched to their death

Fuck all your bluffing while you sit and do nothing
Fuck all your bluffing while you sit and do nothing and you knew
All this suffering would cause an uprising
You'll be put to death
Put to death
