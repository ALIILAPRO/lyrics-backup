		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I just woke up in the morning, uh
I just woke up in the morning, I got mud in my cup (woke up)
I just woke up in the morning, I got mud in my cup (woke up)
At least I woke up today

Had to get rich like that, I ain't pick no side (yeah)
Heard you got skipped like that, get finessed all the time (yeah)
Blew a dub on a beat, not a quarter, not a dime (no more)
You ain't gettin' nothin' else no more, why you lyin'? (Oh)
How it feel to be rich like this? Yeah, it got me cryin'
Won't talk to the cops, we quiet, yeah, what crime? (Shh)
Put a mil' in my watch (milli'), hundred time
She show love to my crotch (yeah, for really), all the time

I just called my twizz up, told him we got the world (got the world)
I called all my bitches up, told 'em we run the world (run the world)
I just called my mama up, told her this my run (really, really)
Told you I done turned it up, told you I done turned it up (really, really)
I be making album after album, got like twenty hits
Pulled up on my shawty, what she did? Drank up all my kids
Bitch, we in NY, as deep as it gets, we chill at the Ritz
I can't make my mind with these drugs, no, I can't pick
Uh, whoa, no, don't worry
All my pockets filled up with racks, they so glory
No, baby girl, don't try me, this not Maury
Most y'all lost, find yourself just like you Dory, let's go

I just woke up in the morning, uh
I just woke up in the morning, I got mud in my cup (woke up)
I just woke up in the morning, I got mud in my cup (woke up)
At least I woke up today

Had to get rich like that, I ain't pick no side (yeah)
Heard you got skipped like that, get finessed all the time (yeah)
Blew a dub on a beat, not a quarter, not a dime (no more)
You ain't gettin' nothin' else no more, why you lyin'? (Oh)
How it feel to be rich like this? Yeah, it got me cryin'
Won't talk to the cops, we quiet, yeah, what crime? (Shh)
Put a mil' in my watch (milli'), hundred time
She show love to my crotch (yeah, for really), all the time
