		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She was only seventeen when Producer Man came offering
That all her dreams would come true
He said, "Come here, sweetie, I can make you a star
I just want to see you flourish and I know you'll make it far"
What she couldn't see
Was he was in it for the money, oh-ohh

Money, oh-ohh
Money, money
Money, oh-ohh
Money, money

Got the girl to move to L.A.
Got the paperwork so she could sign her life away
And it was in his plan to work her 'til he got his pay, au
He said, "Sign right here," and sign she did
He knew that she was too young to know what she wanted
And now she's in the hands of good ol' Producer Man

Money, oh-ohh
Money, money
Money, money
Money, money

Knew his way to get the girl to listen
Made her into someone she isn't
Gotta listen well, only matters how you'll sell (sell)
Sweetie, this was part of the deal
What you thought was fake on the money is real
It was too late now, caught herself with no way out (out)

Money, oh-ohh
Money, money
Money, money
Money, money

I am your only chance
And you know you want it bad
I'll make you a deal you can't refuse
A deal you'll never lose

I am your only chance
And you know you want it bad
I'll make you a deal you can't refuse
A deal you'll never lose

Sign on the line
'Cause you're running out of time
Those who have a chance will trust in Producer Man
