		<p>
		  Good morning there
What a way to start the day
With everything laid bare
Hair on the pillow like a frame

If I could capture every fleck of light
I'd capture all and anything
I'd wager that nobody's ever felt the way we feel
When I asked you to be all of life
I knew for every second of our ups and downs
They'd turn around like grass upon the wheel
Like grass upon the wheel

Well, I get lost inside my head
In this chaos, you're my calm
And I will find my feet again
'Cause even the worst days of my life will always end

At midnight in your arms
At midnight in your arms

Sorry I missed your call
It was silent for the song
Let me know when you're free to talk
I won't miss it for the world, no, I won't

I could not wish for more in life
Than just a hint of when you smile
I could go blind and I'd still know your scent 
Whenever you'd appear
I have moments when I doubt myself
But feeling low should still be felt
It's natural to be consumed with unrelenting fear
With unrelenting fear

I worry 'til there's nothing left
But in this darkness, you're my sun
I will find my feet again
'Cause even the worst days of my life will always end

At midnight in your arms, hey, hey
At midnight in your arms, hey, hey
At midnight in your arms, hey, hey
At midnight in your arms, hey, hey
At midnight in your arms
