		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Been weeks I been living and your smiles are giving me all types of treble

Weak knees I been given and those nights are making me star-struck and metal

Stay free
Don't go
'Cause we don't need no

Try to be living as your vice and can you be my type?

'Cause we need to be given a good life and can I be your type of metal?

Stay free
Don't go
'Cause we don't need no shows

We don't need no shows
We don't need no shows

Pay for the devil a plug to a pedal I'm your type
Weak knees from the level I'm sick from the treble I'm your type of metal

Weak knees don't go
'Cause we don't need no shows

She's sweet as battery, man I got nothin'
You kiss an enemy's hands, I got nothing
We got an animal band and that's something
It's not love if it's just fucking

We don't need no shows
We don't need no shows
We don't need no shows
We don't need no shows
