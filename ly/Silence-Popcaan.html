		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, ta na na na na
Ta na na na
Ta na na na
Dre Skull, woi

Watch who you tell when you a buy new Bimma'
Careful do you confide inna
A nuh anybody pour my drinks
A nuh anybody buy my dinner
So hard fi trust your enemy, hard fi trust your friend
Trust your friend, me nah lie
Me love me family but me nuh trust the whole a dem
Whole a dem
Might sound fucked up, but that's how me feel
Big up Unruly cuz up a sunny nil
All a me long time bredda from Titchfield
Long time petro them a hold it on the battlefield
Some of them heart filled with grudge
My thugs are the realest thugs
And my heart clean, filled with love
And mi meditation sharp like studs

Den Dre Skull, evil them send me say the whole of them a miss
Go fi di psalms them a send for the chalice
Them just a watch me like a radio analyst
But me unstoppable memba me tell you this
In the music I'm like a fucking senator
Them a di fucking janitor
None of my link no regular
Mad sick, head no good like predator

Watch who you tell when you a buy new Bimma'
Careful do you confide inna
A nuh anybody pour my drinks
A nuh anybody buy my dinner
So hard fi trust your enemy, hard fi trust your friend
Trust your friend, me nah lie
Me love me family but me nuh trust the whole a dem
Whole a dem
Might sound fucked up, but that's how me feel
Big up Unruly cuz up a sunny nil
All a me long time bredda from Titchfield
Long time petro them a hold it on the battlefield
Some of them heart filled with grudge
My thugs are the realest thugs
And my heart clean, filled with love
And mi meditation sharp like studs

Thank God I'm blessed so
Badmind can't defeat me, yeah
Every day Jah surround me
When me cry out Him hear my plea, yeah
Some girl work every day 'til them knee them knock
Some can't manage the pressure and go turn pon crack
Some man sit down and a hope sufferation stop
Too much ghetto youth a fall fi the system trap
Hombre a from me likkle bit nigga fi what me want
No man a reap from the seed when me plant
Sleepless days, sleepless nights
Whole heap a rough road where me walk, true
No, man a win in advance
Dutty badmind, you nah stand a chance
Me and Dre Skull collect the check
Dem then them see the few black Bimma' pass
Anyhow

Watch who you tell when you a buy new Bimma'
Careful do you confide inna
A nuh anybody pour my drinks
A nuh anybody buy my dinner
So hard fi trust your enemy, hard fi trust your friend
Trust your friend, me nah lie
Me love me family but me nuh trust the whole a dem
Whole a dem
Might sound fucked up, but that's how me feel
Big up Unruly cuz up a sunny nil
All a me long time bredda from Titchfield
Long time petro them a hold it on the battlefield
Some of them heart filled with grudge
My thugs are the realest thugs
And my heart clean, filled with love
And mi meditation sharp like studs

Yeah, ta na na na na
Ta na na na
Ta na na na
Dre Skull, woi
