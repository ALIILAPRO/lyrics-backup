		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Never before have I seen you look so blue 
Can't find a cure and nothing comforts you 
The light at the end of the tunnel 
Doesn't shine at the end of the day 

[Chorus]
Every time you cry 
Save up all your tears 
I will be your rainbow when they disappear 
Wash away the pain 
'til you smile again 
I will be the laughter in your eyes 
Every time you cry Every time you cry 

Time has a way of wounding what has healed 
What can I say, I know just how you feel 
Your soul is dark and troubled 
Like a river running wild 

[Chorus]
Well you know that's what I'm here for 
And I will give you when you need more 
There'll be no hesitation 
I will reap no reward 

[Chorus: x2]
