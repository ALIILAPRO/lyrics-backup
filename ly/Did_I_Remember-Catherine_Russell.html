		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Did I remember
To tell you I adore you
cnd I am living for you alone

Did I remember 
To say I'm lost without you
cnd just how mad about you I've grown

You were in my arms
cnd that was all I knew
We were alone, we two
What did I say to you

Did I remember 
To tell you I adore you
cnd pray forever more you'll be mine
