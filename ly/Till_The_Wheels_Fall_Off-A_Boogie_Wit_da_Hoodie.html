		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  (It's JoeFromYO)

Gotta stay packing if you think I'm lacking
Might not never, just come and see
Don't give me a reason to squeeze, my nigga
Know I got the juice like a Sunny D
If I do it for you and you do it for me
Let's just ride 'til the wheels fall off
If you do it for me, I'm gon' do it for you
If I don't, cut my ten toes off, yeah

And I'm getting paid for real, for real
G-ride the wave
Most of my niggas do pills still
Try to tell them to stay away
I just hope you feel me, my nigga
Forget all the money and all the fame
This is the real me, my nigga
I swear to God, this shit will never change
If there was a problem with me
Then you never heard about it, it wasn't ever me
Niggas be wildin' nowadays
Shootin' shit up just to get to my MVP
I ain't fuckin' around this time
That's word to my mother, that's word to Melody
And if it go down this time, I'm ready
I put that on everything, word to me
(Yeah)

I'm ready, my nigga, I put that on everything
I'm ready, my nigga, I'm like yeah, yeah (yeah), look
I'm a certain nigga, curve a bitch for actin' different
Know I prefer baddies only, real specific
She prefers only Birkin purses, I know, yeah (yeah)
And saying whatever in person
And doing whatever in person
Ain't gotta be perfect, baby
Just don't pull up looking like whatever in person
I am not an internet person
I really wear hoodies in person

Yeah
And we ain't got mob ties, but we really gotta move like the mob (yeah)
And if I ain't have long johns on, put the .22 in my sock (yeah)
And if I get rode on, I'ma spin the block two hundred times
And my niggas got told on, FaceTime in V12 from the time
And I know shit get real nowadays, yeah, shit get litty
Lamborghini, black and blue, looking like the new TRON in my city
Like I'm Jimmy
And I don't wanna see the ending, baby, I'm still having fun with the beginning
And all my day ones with me, and I'm still real, yeah
Still hangin' 'round niggas that used to go five-five with me
Like a half an hour, 30 on me just in case they want my time to stop ticking
Richard Mille 'bout a half a million, coulda bought a house, my nigga
Me and my girl just finished arguing, I don't wanna take no pictures
Don't think I'm crazy, baby
'Cause I go crazy 'bout you
Keep a .380 with me
That shotty'll rock your body
I don't need no stylist, stop it (stop)
Just in case they pocket watching
I pulled up with a pocket rocket
I can make you famous
Buy the flyest, nigga, I Saint Laurent it
These niggas be broke
They don't want no beef, they don't want know Johnny Rockets
I don't need no lease, gettin' money OD
Anything I drive, I buy
Skeleton AP or the Patek Philippe
What's next? I haven't decided

Gotta stay packing if you think I'm lacking
Might not never, just come and see
Don't give me a reason to squeeze, my nigga
Know I got the juice like a Sunny D
If I do it for you, then just do it for me
Let's just ride 'til the wheels fall off
If you do it for me, I'm gon' do it for you
And if I don't, cut my ten toes off
