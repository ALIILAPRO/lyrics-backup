		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Got an attitude
Thinking that he's always right
Blowin' smoke rings
Making me wanna fight

I never look back
At all the things I've ever done
I never look up
Seeing that he's on the run
Seeing that he's on the run

It's a big thing
Everything the heart desires
And now I have to
Try to out do the fight

I caught a big break
Went to play in the road
I saw you laughing
Even though you know it's old

Even though you know it's old
Even though you know it's old

Even when you're on the run
Even when you're on the run
Even when you're on the run

Even when you're on the run

Even though you know it's old
