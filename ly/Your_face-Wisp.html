		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Is this all real
You're stuck in my head

Drowning
Falling
Into you

You look at me the same
But I can't reciprocate
Fragrant air
And then I see your face
I see your face
I see your face

I want to feel
Only when I'm with you

Black and white
I'm stuck in the loops of your mind
Black and white
I wish that I could call you mine

There's no going back

You look at me the same
But I can't reciprocate
Fragrant air
And then I see your face
I see your face
I see your face
