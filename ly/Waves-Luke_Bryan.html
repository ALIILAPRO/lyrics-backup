		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's like the sun went down just to frame your face
Like they played that song just to see you sway
Like that old surf shop had you in mind
With what you got on, making those tan lines

It's like the ocean knows we're laying
On this beach tonight
It's like the sand's been waiting
For you to come alive 'cause

You were made for summer
Just like these stars we're under
Were made for lighting this July sky up
Blanket down made for me and you tied up
All night long, over and over
Crash into me and pull me closer
Kiss by kiss, one after another
Don't let go, baby, let this summer
Just keep on coming in waves
Keep coming in waves
Keep on coming in waves
Keep coming in waves

Wish I could bottle up the taste on your lips
That margarita saltwater sunburned sip
It's like I feel that sun right next to me
Yeah, girl, your touch is a hundred degrees

Boardwalks were made for dancing
And flip flops were made to lose like
This night was meant to happen
And, girl, I was made for you like

You were made for summer
Just like these stars we're under
Were made for lighting this July sky up
Blanket down made for me and you tied up
All night long, over and over
Crash into me and pull me closer
Kiss by kiss, one after another
Don't let go, baby, let this summer
Just keep on coming in waves
Keep coming in waves
Keep on coming in waves
Keep coming in waves

Keep on coming in waves
Keep coming in waves
Keep on coming in waves
Keep coming in waves

Baby, you were made for summer
Just like these stars we're under
Were made for lighting this July sky up
Blanket down made for me and you tied up
All night long, over and over
Crash into me and pull me closer
Kiss by kiss, one after another
Don't let go, baby, let this summer
Just keep on coming in waves
Keep coming in waves
Keep on coming in waves
Keep coming in waves
