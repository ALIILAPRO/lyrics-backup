		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're the prince to my ballerina
You'll feed all the people's parking meters
You encourage the eating of ice cream
And you would somersault in sand with me

You talk to loners
You ask 'how's your week?'
You give love to all
And give love to me
You're obsessed with hiding
The sticks and stones
And feel the unknown
You feel like home
You feel like home

You put my feet back on the ground
Oh, did you know you brought me home
Yeah, you were sweet and you were sound
Can you save me

You're the wars in my summer's breeze
You're the ivories in my ebony key
You would share your last jelly bean
And you would somersault in sand with me

You put my feet back on the ground
Oh, did you know you brought me home
Yeah, you were sweet and you were sound
You save me

You put my feet (back on the ground)
Oh, did you know you brought me (home)
Yeah you were sweet and you were (sound)
See I have tried
You still bring me around 'n around 'n around

'n around 'n around 'n around
Yeah yeah oh oh
You brought me around
Yeah yeah oh oh
