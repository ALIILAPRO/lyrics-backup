		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Another day another dollar gone
When I get up in the morning I just can't go on
I feel the outstretch turns of time
I ain't lyin'

But somethin's callin' from down deep within
Like I finally started livin' for myself again
I saved the outstretch lands of time
Changed my mind

'Cause I wanna run that race
I wanna run that race
I do it on my pace
As long as I get to run that race again

I feel discouraged and I doubt myself
But you know you can't blame it on nobody else
Only you know where it is
You belong, sing along

We gotta run that race
We gotta run that race
I do it on my pace
As long as we get to run that race again

When I lay my head on my pillow at night
I think about what still going right
Thank the stars up above
There's still things left I know

I wanna run that race
I wanna run that race
I wanna run that race, yeah
