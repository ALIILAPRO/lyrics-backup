		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Some people say a man is made outta mud
A poor man's made outta muscle and blood
Muscle and blood and skin and bone
With a mind that's weak and a back that's strong.
You load sixteen tons, what do you get
Another day older and deeper and debt
St Peter don't you call me 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store.

I was born one mornin' when the sun didn't shine
I picked up my shovel and I walked to the mine
Loaded sixteen tons of No. 9 coal
And the store boss said well bless my soul.
You load sixteen tons, what do you get
Another day older and deeper and debt
St Peter don't you call me 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store.

I was born one mornin' it was drizzlin' rain
Fightin' and trouble are my middle name
Raisin' the cane, break by an old mountain lion
Ain't no hightoned woman makes me walk the line.
You load sixteen tons, what do you get
Another day older and deeper and debt
St Peter don't you call me 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store.

If you see me comin' better step aside
A lotta men didn't, a lotta men died
One fist of iron the other of steel
If the right one don't get you then the left one will.
You load sixteen tons, what do you get
Another day older and deeper and debt
St Peter don't you call me 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store
