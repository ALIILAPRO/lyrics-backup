		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm on the run
And I gotta prove I'm the one
Sometimes it ain't fun
But babe can you love me like a loaded gun
Promise that I'll do the same
Through all the pleasure and pain
And I know that so much has changed but baby we made it through all of that rain
Got to the point where I don't hold my tongue baby I'm feelin' too numb
I feel the smoke in my lungs, I don't know if I can trust anyone
This is the life that I'm leadin'
Ever since I turned 21
I might've fallen to pieces
But they won't be phasin' me none
Out on my own, don't hit my phone, whenever you think that you need some
It's me and my baby, we speed through the city and we make the best of these re-runs
I paid the price want a refund
This world is so cold that's why we numb
But I cut 'em off and I did it like nothin' and now I'm enjoyin' the freedom
I'm on the run like I'm dodgin' the case
I'm on the run like I'm duckin' the Jake's
I'm way too numb like I took Novocaine cuz of all the lies that they said to my face
Baby they won't take the blame
Baby I don't want this pain
And I don't have time to explain cuz I gotta go and just hop on this plane
I'm on the run
And I gotta prove I'm the one
Sometimes it ain't fun
But babe can you love me like a loaded gun
Promise that I'll do the same
Through all the pleasure and pain
And I know that so much has changed but baby we made it through all of that rain
