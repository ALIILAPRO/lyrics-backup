		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You were at my door
I heard you knockin', but I didn't care at all
I had been in all night, just starin' at the wall
I didn't really want to see you anymore

Comin' from the road
You took your coat off and you threw it on the floor
You said I can't believe you wanna hurt me so
I said I'm not supposed to be like this you know
Well I just had to let you go

What's on your mind
When you're lost in time
What's on your mind, tell me why
Why does it have to be this way?

You were in that dream
That I was dreamin' I was dreamin in a dream
Your nylon dress and I was floatin' back downstream
I wanted love to come and swallow everything
Ohh

Everything it's real
Sooner or later, doesn't matter how you feel
You slammed that door shut on the night of glass and steel
I cannot blame you for believing what you believe
Well I just had to let you go

What's on your mind
When you're lost in time
What's on your mind, tell me why
Why does it have to be this way?
Why do you always stay
Miles away, and to steps behind
Where the past is still livin'
Beautiful and forgiven
Do you not see
That you live in a dream
Hey

What's on your mind
When you're lost in time
What's on your mind, tell me why
Why does it have to be this way?

What's on your mind
When you're lost in time
What's on your mind, tell me why
Why does it have to be this way?

What's on your mind
When you're lost in time
What's on your mind, tell me why
Why does it have to be this way?
