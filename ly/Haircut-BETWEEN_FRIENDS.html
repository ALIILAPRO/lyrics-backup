		<p>
		  One, two, three, four, go

Woke up this morning, where were you?
You look so sad when you don't get what you want
You say I'm smarter than you thought (yeah)
Kept our receipts back of my truck in a box

So, I cut my hair
You know I can't go without you
I said it, I'd do it again
If you'd like me to (yeah)

You tell me you think I'm different (mh, yeah)
You like when I wear it short or up on my head
I love the way we have fun now (woo)
I wanna tell you I love you

So I cut my hair (yeah)
Yeah, I cut my hair for you (yeah)
You know I can't go without you
I said it, I'd do it again
If you'd like me to (yeah)

So I cut my hair (yeah, you know I cut my hair)
Yeah, I cut my hair for you (cut my hair for you)
You know I can't go without you
I said it, I'd do it again
If you'd like me to (yeah, yeah)

La-la, la-la-la (yeah)
La-la, la-la-la-la-la (now I might cut my hair)
La-la-la-la-la
La-la, la-la-la-la-la (yeah, I cut my hair for you)
La-la, la-la-la (I said I might cut my hair for you)
I said it, I'd do it again, yeah
