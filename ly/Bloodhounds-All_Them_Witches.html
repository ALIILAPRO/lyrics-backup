		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Got killed a man at midnight
Now the hunter on my trail

And if they even catch me
No one is gonna pay my bill

'Cause I killed a man at midnight
Now I gotta leave this town
Split!

I killed a man at midnight
But now the hunter on my trail

I can hear them telling news now
They gonna catch me now I'm running wild to loose
Yeah, I'm running

I killed a man, killed a man at midnight
Ain't nobody gonna pay my bill

I killed a man, killed a man at midnight
Well if my younger brothers came to pay off

I killed a man, killed a man at midnight
Well now the hunter on my trail
On my trail
