		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  History repeat itself, they be on your ass when they come
It's the first day of Ramadan, can't break my fast with a blunt
I smile when I see my brother daughter and my daughter on the phone
They killed Casper, that was my dog, that was him on "TherlBread" song

They hate me so much, they can't even tell you what I done did wrong
I done sent money to the county jails, I done put money on the phone
And I'm mad as hell 'cause when Von died, they ain't put him in the wall
See, you gang, but at the same time, brodie, just please go get involved
Go pick up a gun, check on his mama, check on his son
'Fore Muwop went to jail, him and Lil Boona was havin' fun
Commissary slips in the county jail, my name was on more than one
Body for body, you can't do that, he got more than one
It's been a long time since I cried
Know brodie bigger than brodie, but you know brodie gon' hurt his pride
Used to call me every day, but it slowed down when he got denied
I just did two hundred and seventy-five push-ups, my arms tired
You live the life like I live, you would've gave up
Go out in Vogue, but only me and you can save us
Your enemies be frenemies, them niggas dangerous
I'ma tell you more about my life, just let me flame up
If Durk your family like you say, why you ain't rich yet?
Personal problems inside my life I ain't even fixed yet
Cousin havin' a meetin' inside the hood, why would I risk that?
If I ain't got a hundred million dollars cash, I ain't rich yet
But I'll still give niggas belt to ass, I'll risk that
Orientation 'cause my daughter smarter than her whole class
Sit back and tell my mama she was right about my old friends
Durkio's a savage, the same time, that boy a romance

I love savages, I love my savages
I love savages, I love my savages
I love savages, I love my savages
I love savages, I love my savages

History repeat itself, they be on your ass when they come
It's the first day of Ramadan, can't break my fast with a blunt
I smile when I see my brother daughter and my daughter on the phone
They killed Casper, that was my dog, that was him on "TherlBread" song

And this for my brothers
And if you got a brother
Somebody you consider your brother that was once just your friend
But they earned your trust and you considered them your brother
We ain't gotta talk every day
We ain't gotta hang out every day
We ain't gotta call each other every day
Just when you call me or when I get the word
Or I get that kite in the air and I know you need me
Just come 'cause I'm comin'

History repeat itself, they be on your ass when they come
It's the first day of Ramadan, can't break my fast with a blunt
I smile when I see my brother daughter and my daughter on the phone
They killed Casper, that was my dog, that was him on "TherlBread" song
