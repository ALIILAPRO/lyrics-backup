		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You can take a horse to the water but you can't make him drink
Oh no, oh no, oh no

A friend of mine in so much misery
Some people sail through life, he is struggling
I said, "Hey man, let's go out and get some wisdom"
First he turned on me, then turned off his nervous system

You can take a horse to the water but you can't make him drink
Oh no, oh no, oh no
You can have it all laid out in front of you but still won't make it think
Oh no, oh no, oh no

Someone I love has got a problem
Some people thirst for truth, he would like a drink
I said, "Hey man, this could be risky"
He said everything's okay, as he downed another bottle of whiskey

You can take a horse to the water but you can't make him drink
Oh no, oh no, oh no
You can have it all staked out in front of you but still won't make it sink
Oh no, oh no, oh no

Preacher at my church likes to talk about Satan
Could be that he knows him, he acts like he's possessed
I said, "Hey man, let's hear about God's realization for a change"
He said, "We ain't got time for that, first you must hear of the evils of fornication"

You can take a horse to the water but you can't make him drink
Oh no, oh no, oh no
You can have it all staked out in front of you but still won't make it sink
Oh no, oh no, oh no
