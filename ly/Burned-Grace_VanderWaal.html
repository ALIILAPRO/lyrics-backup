		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You tell me that I'm crazy
Doing this alone
You don't need to save me
Oh, how I've grown

I am capable of everything you can see
But now I want to change

Just blow out the candles
Oh little boy, when will you learn?
You don't play with fire
Unless you wanna get burned
Wanna get burned
Just blow out the candles
Oh, how the tables they've turned
You don't play with fire
Unless you wanna get burned
You wanna get burned
Wanna get burned
Wanna, wanna get burned

Something's just so crazy
Things you'll never know
There's always that I would maybe
That keeps stringing you along

'Cause I am capable of everything you can see
But now I want to change

Just blow out the candles
Oh, little boy, when will you learn?
You don't play with fire
Unless you wanna get burned
Wanna get burned
Blow out the candles
Oh, how the tables they've turned
You don't play with fire
Unless you wanna get burned
Wanna get burned

What is that, that I see
Floating right in front of me
Lock the doors, try to leave
But now it's clear to me

You didn't blow out the candles
Oh, little boy, you'll never learn
You don't play with fire
But you're already burned
You're already burned
Blow out the candles
Oh, little boy, you'll never learn
You don't play with fire
But you're already burned
You're already burned

Wanna get burned
Wanna, wanna get burned, burned
Wanna get burned
Wanna, wanna get burned, burned
Wanna get burned
Wanna, wanna get burned (get burned, get burned, get burned, get burned, get burned, get burned)
