		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Girl I know, I know you bought me the watch
You ain't get it back though
My name on the back though (ooh)
I flipped the lock to the back door (ooh)
And took the key under the mat though (yeah)
I know you hate that
But you did some things that you cannot take back
I needed change
Left a nickel for a dime
That is a payback
"What you sayin'?
Bitch I'm over you and I ain't playin'
Should've been a one night stand
But here we go again

I wish that I loved you
Or that I cared (right, right)
Or that I'd even give a damn if you were here
But you're gone so it's fuck you
I'm a player
I am everything that you wanted but you're scared

I wish I could say, "I love you" ("I love you")
Or that I cared (right, right)
Or that I'd even give a damn if you were here
But you're gone so it's fuck you
I'm a player
I am everything that you wanted but you're scared

Ay, please never call me
Do not mention me in any stories
Do not show up at the homie's party
Come up to me and then say, "I'm sorry"
You're just a
You just a, hold up, lemme stop
The Henny shots got the petty talk comin'
I don't wanna have them thoughts runnin'
Can't believe that I bust in a thot's stomach
Fuck is wrong with you?
I don't even get along with you
(Not even a little bit) 
But the head was phenomenal 
Used to do that in the car with you (ha, true)
Used to travel around the world just for the rendez-vous (come through) 
Now I gotta get high just to deal with you, these are the chronicles

I wish that I loved you
Or that I cared (right, right)
Or that I'd even give a damn if you were here
But you're gone so it's fuck you
I'm a player
I am everything that you wanted but you're scared

I wish I could say, "I love you" ("I love you")
Or that I cared (right, right)
Or that I'd even give a damn if you were here
But you're gone so it's fuck you
I'm a player
I am everything that you wanted but you're scared

Yeah, yeah

I wish that I loved you
Or that I cared (right, right)
Or that I'd even give a damn if you were here
But you're gone so it's fuck you
I'm a player
I am everything that you wanted but you're scared

I wish I could say, "I love you" ("I love you")
Or that I cared (right, right)
Or that I'd even give a damn if you were here
But you're gone so it's fuck you
I'm a player
I am everything that you wanted
Everything that you wanted
