		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Leave it in the driveway, bitch, I'm done
Makin' me cry and pull out my gun
I'm gonna shoot this if you run
Blow my brains out just for fun
I can't sleep and I can't eat
The same old shoes still on my feet
Same old grass still on my lawn
But, it died since you've been gone

Hold on to me
I got one more question
Hold on for me
Did you learn your lesson?

Little Bo Peep
Been in the same old jeans
I'm in the same white tee that I wore last week
If she don't love me for my money
Then she love me for me
Baby, I've been gettin' money so it's easy to see
Every time I spend a hundred
She get somethin' for free
All my friends think I'm buggin'
And she ain't fuckin' with me
Got me thinkin' like it's nothin'
She ain't fuckin' with me
But she got me goin' crazy when she fuckin' on me, yeah

Hold on to me
I got one more question
Hold on for me
Did you learn your lesson?

Leave it in the driveway, bitch, I'm done
Makin' me cry and pull out my gun
I'm gonna shoot this if you run
Blow my brains out just for fun
I can't sleep and I can't eat
The same old shoes still on my feet
Same old grass still on my lawn
But, it died since you've been gone

Hold on to me
I got one more question
Hold on for me
Did you learn your lesson?
