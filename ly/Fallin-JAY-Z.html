		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know I shouldn't have did that
I know it's gon' come right back
I know it's gon' destroy everything I made
It's probably gon' get your boy sent away
But this game I play, ain't no way to fix it
It's inevitable that I'm (fallin')

Said where I would stop before I even started
When I get to one brick, then the game I would depart with
Got to one brick then I looked to the sky like
"Sorry, God, I lied but give me one more try"
Got to two bricks, new cars, new whips
But niggas never learn 'til they end up in the news clip
The irony of selling drugs is sort of like you using it
Guess it's two sides to what substance abuse is
Can't stop, won't stop, addicted to this new shit
Brand new convertibles, I'm so ruthless
Front row fight night, see how big my tube is
Fuck HD, nigga, see how clear my view is?
(Fallin') But there's a price for overdoing it
Doing it this big will put you on the map
Stick-up kids is out to tax
Plus the FBI boys with the cameras in the back
Damn

I know I shouldn't have did that
I know it's gon' come right back
I know it's gon' destroy everything I made
It's probably gon' get your boy sent away
But this game I play, ain't no way to fix it
It's inevitable

Now you (fallin'), when you should've fell back
Now you (fallin'), right into they lap
Fallin', they applauding, they screaming at the screen
Damn, you fucked up like your favorite movie scene
Godfather, Goodfellas, Scarface, Casino
You seen what that last run did to De Niro in Heat
Can't beat the odds, can't cheat the Gods
Can't blow too hard, life's a deck of cards
Now your tumbling is humbling, you're fallin', you're mumbling
Under your breath like you knew this day was coming
(Fallin') Now let's pray that arm candy
That you left your ex for stay down and come in handy
'Cause come January it gets cold, when the letters start to slow
And your commissary's low, and your lawyer screams appeal
Only thinking about a bill and your chances are nil
Damn, gravity's ill

I know I shouldn't have did that
I know it's gon' come right back
I know it's gon' destroy everything I made
It's probably gon' get your boy sent away
But this game I play, ain't no way to fix it
It's inevitable 

But you're (fallin'), and you can't get up
All you do is push-up, pull-up, sit-up
Locked down the town now belongs to the squares
Who said they won't make the same mistake that got you there
And your arm candy sweet on them
And the women that you left for this heifer
Got a college degree coming
Bad news keeps coming, hard to keep something on your stomach
You're sick 'bout what your life is becoming
(Fallin') But your use-to's, has-beens
Ragging bad 'bout all the new dudes
Talking tough on the Youtube
'Bout what you used to do
But that's old school to the new crew
They doing numbers like Sudoku
They're the new you, and it's damn near inevitable
They'll experience deja vu too
Fight and you'll never survive
Run and you'll never escape
So just fall from grace, damn

I know I shouldn't have did that
I know it's gon' come right back
I know it's gon' destroy everything I made
It's probably gon' get your boy sent away
But this game I play, ain't no way to fix it
It's inevitable that I'm 

Fallin', seems like I'm fallin'
Fallin', seems like I'm fallin'
Fallin', seems like I'm fallin'
Fallin', seems like I'm fallin'
Fallin', seems like I'm fallin'
Fallin', seems like I'm fallin'
Fallin', seems like I'm fallin'
Fallin', seems like I'm
