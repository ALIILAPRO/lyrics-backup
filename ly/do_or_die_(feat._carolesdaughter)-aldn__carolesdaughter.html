		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I feel like this is do or die
I'm making a decision here, it makes me wanna cry
B707 got me feeling fucking high
But I'm not even worried if I make it out alive
I lay my head onto your chest
I swear I did my best
To keep you in my heart
When it's all falling apart
I know this is the worst of me
I'm not an enemy

They say, if I give up, I'm worried you might have a breakdown
Everything you say right now is
Stressing me out, I haven't eaten for some days now
You never used to talk like this
Texts from my exes and cigarettes, is frequent
No second guessing and do it but you already know
We can't keep this up, I'm worried you might have a breakdown
You never used to talk like this

I watched some people passing by
I wonder if they hate me when I look 'em in the eyes
Opiates and cigarettes to help me pass the time
I'm making bad decisions but oh well, I'm gonna die
You lay your heart upon your sleeve
Bunny, I don't wanna leave
Run my fingers through your hair
Just so you know that I care
I know this is the worst of me
I'm not an enemy

They say, if I give up, I'm worried you might have a breakdown
Everything you say right now is
Stressing me out, I haven't eaten for some days now
You never used to talk like this
Texts from my exes and cigarettes, is frequent
No second guessing and do it but you already know
We can't keep this up, I'm worried you might have a breakdown
You never used to talk like this
