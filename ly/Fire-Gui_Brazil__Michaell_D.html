		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do you believe in God, for the flame of the holy spirit just born inside of our hearts

Do you Believe that with me?

So, i will be talking about this fire
The flame of the holy Spirit, The Fire of God inside of our hearts

This is what to be driving us
Guide us in every step we take
Why do i say that you?
The flame of the Holy Spirit

I Want The Fire of God in my Life
