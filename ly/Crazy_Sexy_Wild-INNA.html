		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Heart beats steady, baby, ready to play
Just let the disco light come and take us away
I feel the heat like a fire bring it closer to me
Just let it out

Is like a spark burning steady from the east to the west
I feel the bass beating louder bring it out of my chest
I like the way that you do it, 'cause you do it the best
So glad I've found you

You and I will dance untill we die
Crazy, sexy, wild, we just wanna let it out
Touch my body with the music, baby, you know I want it

You and I will dance untill we die
Crazy, sexy, wild, we just wanna let it out
Touch my body with the music, baby, you know I want it

Move to the right, right
Up and down crazy, sexy wild

Move to the right, right
Pump it loud, crazy, sexy, wild

Move to the right, right
Up and down crazy, sexy wild
Move to the right, right
Up and down crazy, sexy, wild

You and I will dance untill we die
Crazy, sexy, wild, we just wanna let it out
Touch my body with the music, baby, you know I want it

Heart beats steady, baby, ready to play
Just let the disco light come and take us away
I feel the heat like a fire bring it closer to me
Just let it out

You and I will dance untill we die
(You and I)
Crazy, sexy, wild, we just wanna let it out
(You and I)
Touch my body, with the music, baby, you know I want it
(You and I)

You and I will dance untill we die
Crazy, sexy, wild, we just wanna let it out
Touch my body with the music, baby, you know I want it

You and I will dance untill we die
Crazy, sexy, wild, we just wanna let it out
Touch my body with the music, baby, you know I want it

You and I will dance untill we die
Crazy, sexy, wild, we just wanna let it out
Touch my body with the music, baby, you know I want it

You and I
You and I

You and I

You and I
