		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So messed up I want you here 
And in my room I want you here 
And now we're gonna be face to face 
And I'll lay right down in my favorite place 
Yeah you know what that is 

Now I want to be your dog 
Now I want to be your dog 
Now I want to be your dog 
(C'mon) (I want to be your dog you know it) 

Ooh give it to me 
Now I'm ready to close my eyes 
Yes now I'm ready to close my mind 
Now I'm ready to feel your hands 
Lose my heart on the burning sand 

Now I want to be your dog 
Now I want to be your dog 
Now I want to be your dog 
(C'mon) (I want to be your dog you know it) 
 
 Do it 
Yeah that's right 

So messed up I want you here 
And in my room I want you here 
And now we're gonna be face to face 
And I'll lay right down in my favorite place 
Yeah you know what that is 

Now I want to be your dog 
Now I want to be your dog 
Now I want to be your dog 
(C'mon) (I want to be your dog you know it) 

Well come on 
I'll be your dog
