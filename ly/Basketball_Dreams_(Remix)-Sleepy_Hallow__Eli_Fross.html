		  (Great John on the beat, by the way)
Basketball dreams
I hit the block and shot a different type of three
Look, huh

Remember I had basketball dreams, uh
I hit the block and shot a different type of three, huh
Said they love me, I don't know what that mean, huh
Started ballin', now these bitches playing D, huh
Smokin' gas so my pockets never E
I'm in somethin' fast, and it's probably AMG, huh
Fear no man, I know everybody bleed, huh
Stuck up in my ways, I'm a different type of breed, huh

I'm the wave, I hope everybody see, huh
Ocean on my neck, I pull up smoking out the B, huh
But she want me to fuck and make her famous
She think I made it
That's the reason when I pull up she be naked, uh

She gon' throw it to me, never take it
And my pockets full of dead niggas' faces
(Mmm, mm-mm, never take it)
(And my pockets full of dead niggas' faces)
Look

Remember I had basketball dreams, uh
I hit the block and shot a different type of three, huh
Said they love me, I don't know what that mean, huh
Started ballin', now these bitches playin' D, huh
Smokin' gas so my pockets never E
I'm in somethin' fast, and it's probably AMG, huh
Fear no man, I know everybody bleed, huh
(Stuck up in my ways, I'm a different type of breed, huh)

Yeah, yeah, I'm a different type of breed
And shoutout to my moms, she had a different type of seed
My family built different, got a different type of tree
Had a dream to play the A, but then I started bangin' Bs
Hol' up, huh, yeah, it was hard for you to see
That storm was getting stronger, still gon' push by any means
Ain't ballin' for no trophy, got a trophy for the streets
Ain't get to go to college, but the drugs gave me degrees
Got a emotional budget, I can't go over that
And you could call me a addict 'cause I still play the trap
Sometimes I trip on my doley, so I just smoke the pack
And I don't lean on no shoulders, I just be sippin' that
And you know that I know that you know that I know 
That you know that I know that the drugs be gettin' to me
And you know that I know that you know that I know that I be fucked up, so good luck
Baby, I feel good on my worst day
And everyday I fuck her good like it's her birthday
And niggas out here always bitchin' 'bout them storm days
Lil' nigga, I still be punchin' through them earthquakes

Remember I had basketball dreams, uh
I hit the block and shot a different type of three, huh
Said they love me, I don't know what that mean, huh
Started ballin', now these bitches playing D, huh
Smokin' gas so my pockets never E
I'm in somethin' fast, and it's probably AMG, huh
Fear no man, I know everybody bleed, huh
Stuck up in my ways, I'm a different type of breed, huh
