		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's really hard
I can't cry in your arms
'Cause you're not here
It's not your fault
And if it was I wouldn't care

My heart is bigger
Than the distance in-between us
I know it 'cause I feel it beating

So strong it'll knock you down
So strong, so strong

Over here
I can't count the miles away
From where I wanna be
I bet your skin is warm
And that you're smiling

Yeah, that's what I always
Loved the most about you
You're so strong
Come and knock me down, hey

Baby, if I'm half the man I say I am
(Whoa-oh-oh), if I'm a woman with no fear
Just like I claim I am, (whoa-oh-oh)
Then I'll believe in what you say
There's nothing left for you to do
The only proof that I need is you

I'll get in my car
Drive it faster than I ever did before
Head out west until I finally reach the shore

And then I'll swim out to wherever you are
And we'll ride the undercurrent
Down to the floor

Making friends with all
The unfamiliar creatures
And pushing back
All the unnecessary pressure
Come up for air just so you
Know we won't drown

You're so strong
The world can't keep us down, hey

Baby, if I'm half the man I say I am
(Whoa-oh-oh), if I'm a woman with no fear
Just like I claim I am, (whoa-oh-oh)
Then I'll believe in what you say
There's nothing left for you to do
The only proof that I need is you

Yeah, ooh, yeah, hey
Yeah, ooh, yeah, hey

So do you love me? (Yeah)
All you gotta do is say yes
Now do you love me? (Yeah, hey)
And I won't ever second guess

Now do you love me? (Yeah)
All you gotta do is say yes
Now do you love me? (Yeah, hey)
Then you already proved it

Yeah, yeah, hey

Baby, if I'm half the man I say I am
(Whoa-oh-oh), if I'm a woman with no fear
Just like I claim I am, (whoa-oh-oh)
Then I'll believe in what you say
There's nothing left for you to do
The only proof that I need is

Baby, if I'm half the man I say I am
(Whoa-oh-oh), if I'm a woman with no fear
Just like I claim I am, (whoa-oh-oh)
Then I'll believe in what you say
There's nothing left for you to do
The only proof that I need is you
