		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  That's too much sauce
That's too much sauce

Patek Philippe, the plain one
That's too much sauce
Hermes in the A
That's too much sauce
They let me know before I was famous
I had too much sauce
Audemars, Hublot now
That's too much sauce
That's too much sauce
Got too much sauce
That's too much sauce
I got too much sauce
Patek Philippe, the plain one
That's too much sauce
Got diamonds on all on my fingers
That's too much sauce

Yeah, all of my diamonds they shine
Haters like "knock that off"
All of your diamonds are fake, need to stop that dawg
You really kissin' that girl like she ain't top me though
Shaquille O'Neal with the haters 'cause I'm blockin' y'all
Yeah, yeah, that's too much sauce
Rockin' VLONE when I'm rockin' Off-White (That's too much sauce)
Yeah, she smile at me on her teeth with that ice (That's too much sauce)
Smokin' that gas got me high like a kite
Too much sauce
Diamonds they look like Dasani huh, more like Voss
That boy saw my chain, he said "what's the cost?", aye
You wanna know the amount? Can you count?

Patek Philippe, the plain one
That's too much sauce
Hermes in the A
That's too much sauce
They let me know before I was famous
I had too much sauce
Audemars, Hublot now
That's too much sauce
That's too much sauce
Got too much sauce
That's too much sauce
I got too much sauce
Patek Philippe, the plain one
That's too much sauce
Got diamonds on all of my fingers
That's too much sauce

Too much sauce
Diamonds they look like Dasani, more like Voss
Young man, young man, young man turned myself right to a boss
Like yeah, coppin' no matter the cost, like yeah
(That's too much sauce)
Fuck that bitch and her friend right in my Benz (Too much sauce)
Think me and Future fucked on the same twins, damn
Wait, now I'm getting money
Niggas actin' like they been knew us, aye
Fake energy don't move us
Diamonds they wide like a coupe
Diamonds they straight from the jeweler
Drugs got me lost like Bermuda

Patek Philippe, the plain one
That's too much sauce
Hermes in the A
That's too much sauce
They let me know before I was famous
I had too much sauce
Audemars, Hublot now
That's too much sauce
That's too much sauce
I got too much sauce
That's too much sauce
I got too much sauce
Patek Philippe, the plain one
That's too much sauce
Got diamonds on all of my fingers
That's too much sauce

Too much sauce
Diamonds they look like Dasani
