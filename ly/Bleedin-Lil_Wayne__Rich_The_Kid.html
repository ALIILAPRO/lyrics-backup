		  Uh, uh (MonstaBeatz)

Uh, look at my eyes, they bleedin', uh
Look at your guys, they bleedin', uh
Look at this fire I'm breathin', uh
Look at my blood, it's freezin', uh
Reppin' this 5, I bleed it, uh
Slapped to my Slime, I'm sneezin', uh
Lookin' behind, I'm leadin' uh
Open your mind, I'll read it, uh
Look at your bride, she cheatin', uh
Open her mouth, I feed it, uh
Open her mouth, she speechless, uh
Over and out, I'm leavin', err
Look at my tires, they screechin', yeah
Livin' like Tide, they bleach me, yeah
Feds been tryna' Big Meech me, damn
Feds never fled, they greedy, man
Red-red-red, repeat it, flag
Red-red-red-reheat it, yeah
Look at my eyes they bleedin', yeah
Look at my eyes they bleedin'

Come along, come along, come along, come on
Woman on woman on woman on woman
Come on her tongue and watch the other one tongue her
She sat on my thumb and my thumb in her thumper
That woman start jumpin', that pussy start thumpin'
That cookie start crumblin', that shit been on dumpin'
I was lookin' so scrumptious, I done gave the hoe the munchies
Said her hair was in the way, so I gave the hoe my scrunchie, uh
Tony Montana no Dungy, uh
Really financial no budget, uh
Pretty bitch sandwich, no mustard, uh
She swallow a whole family, no guzzlin' uh
I buy a whole Lamb and don't touch it, uh
Pop a whole Xan, feel nothin', uh
Rob her old man, he had nothin', uh
Hollygrove, man, still bloodin', uh

Look at my eyes, they bleedin', uh
Look at your guys, they bleedin', uh
Look at this fire I'm breathin', uh
Look at my blood, it's freezin', yeah

Look at my eyes, they bleedin'
Look at your bitch sip semen
Look at my life, I'm dreamin', yeah
She want the dick, she fiendin', yeah

Look at my eyes, they bleedin', uh
Look at your guys, they bleedin', uh
Look at this fire I'm breathin', uh
Look at my blood, it's freezin', uh

You tryna' lock a bitch down like the precinct (like the precinct)
I'ma hit it from the back, he police it, yeah
All red 'Rari, I'm bleedin', baby
Ridin' 'round with the stick, so you know somethin' sick
I don't want no bitch gon' make my life all crazy
Need a bitch like Megan, have a trust fund baby
Might make a Mili
Puttin' money on your head, I mean it (I mean it)
Niggas stressin' for the fame, I don't need it (I don't need it)
Gave a bitch a baby, told her keep it, it's a secret, shhh
Young Money, Rich Forever (Rich Forever)
We get the money and stick together (what?)
Look at my wrist on another level (yeah)
She sing on my dick like a acapella (whoa)

Look at my eyes, they bleedin', uh
Look at your guys, they bleedin', uh
Look at this fire I'm breathin', uh
Look at my blood, it's freezin'

Look at my eyes, they bleedin'
