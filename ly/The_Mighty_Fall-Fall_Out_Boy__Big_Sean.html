		  Oh god!
Sean Don
Fall Out, Boi!

Did you trip down 12 steps into Malibu, ooh ooh
(Malibu, ooh, ooh, oh,)
So why the hell is there a light that's keeping us forever
Bel Air baby, did you get dressed up,
Pretty pout, pout
Until you bottomed up, oh
I can't stop it when there's chemicals keeping us together
I'm singing

Whoa
How the mighty fall
The mighty fall
The mighty fall
They fall in love
How the mighty fall
The mighty fall
The mighty fall
Oh how the mighty fall in love

Your crooked love is just a pyramid scheme
And I'm dizzy on dreams (and I'm dizzy on dreams)
But if you ask me two's a whole lot lonelier than one
Baby we should have left our love in the gutter where we found it
(Gutter where we found it)
'Cause your only crime is that you got caught
I'm singing

Whoa
How the mighty fall
The mighty fall
The mighty fall
They fall in love
How the mighty fall
The mighty fall
The mighty fall
Oh how the mighty fall in love

It's getting clear
You're never coming clean
Lock you up inside, and swallow, swallow the key

Hello?
Yeah I know you said not to call unless I'm dying
But I'm driving and I can't stop staring at my eyelids
But even though my eyes closed, I still see you
I just hope that when you see me I'm not see-through
You know how we do

Sometimes I swear, I need a day just for me to lay
With some T and A, but the way we, they way we is do deeper
Baby straight up chemistry DNA
Make me wanna give you every dollar out my B of A
Like, I let her climb on top
I'm either fuckin or workin', so the grind don't stop
They say I got screws missing, well hell, only when I'm missing you
And hell yeah I'm a dick, girl, addicted to you

Whoa
How the mighty fall
The mighty fall
The mighty fall
They fall in love
How the mighty fall
The mighty fall
The mighty fall
Oh how the mighty fall in love
