		  Let's just put this plan in motion
Tri-flag does not deserve our respect
In fact, it deserves our disrespect
It deserves our

I realize there's a fundamental difference between Gen Z's and boomers, and this is it
When a boomer wants to insult you, so say you get cut off in traffic
Hey, fuck you, suck my dick
Gen Z's have done something very interesting

You cut off a Gen Z in traffic, and they go
Hey, fuck you, I'm gonna suck your dick
That represents not a person, or a people, or a community, but an agenda
My six-year-old is transgender

That's right. Transgender children exist
They go, Hey, pull that car over, I'm sucking your feets
Sorry I'm late, I cut off a Gen Zer and he was sucking me off
Yo, I'm not gay, but it's the last day of pride, you know

I believe in purity
So I can receive
I was seeing him, I was kind of just using it as a psychology experiment
and I didn't really like the guy

I more just wanted to see if I could break his heart
Top three best blowjobs I've ever had
Oh my god
It's like, dude, no wonder we're making 30 cents more a dollar
