		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Oh) 두 눈을 자는 척 꽉 감아도
Ha 숨을 내쉬어봐도 uh
결국엔 다시 또 oh, I
운은 나쁘진 않은가봐 또 (huh)
항상 최악은 (huh) 피해 가거든 oh, I

Oh 걱정은 마
불안이 다가오면 난 더 멀리 달아날테니
Stay with me and let's get lost

Oh, no, what should we do?
I'm spinning slowly (spinning, spinning, spinning, spinning)
I hate this city and everything, oh
Won't you forgive me? Oh
Hold, would you hold me? (Would you, would you, would you, would you)
I've been thinking too hard to say it, oh
Won't you leave with me? Oh

까맣게 젖은 밤
숨어 있는 나를 봤어도
Please don't call on me
마음은 참 이상해
지나쳐간다면 붙잡고 싶으니 

Oh, I 더 걱정은 마
위로가 다가 되면 난 그저 더 작아 질테니
Just feel me and let's get lost

Oh, no, what should we do?
I'm spinning slowly (spinning, spinning, spinning, spinning)
I hate this city and everything, oh
Won't you forgive me? Oh
Hold, would you hold me? (Would you, would you, would you, would you)
I've been thinking too hard to say it, oh
Won't you leave with me? Oh

Where do we go?
말해놓곤 이 좁은 곳 돌아 계속 oh
Unbelievable
너가 내 옆에 아직도 있다는건 oh

What should we do? (Ooh)
What should we do?
What should we do?
