		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Christmas) the snow's coming down
(Christmas) I'm watching it fall
(Christmas) lots of people around
(Christmas) baby, please come home
(Christmas) the church bells in town
(Christmas) all ringing in song
(Christmas) full of happy sounds
(Christmas) baby, please come home

They're singing "Deck The Halls"
But it's not like Christmas at all
I remember when you were here
And all the fun we had last year

(Christmas) pretty lights on the tree
(Christmas) I'm watching them shine
(Christmas) you should be here with me
(Christmas) baby, please come home

They're singing "Deck The Halls"
Not like Christmas at all
I remember when you were here
All the fun we had last year

(Christmas) oh, if there was a way
(Christmas) I'd hold back these tears
(Christmas) oh, but it's Christmas day

(Please) please
(Please) please
(Please) please
(Please) please
(Please) please
(Please) please

Oh, come home
Oh, babe
You know I need you
Oh, come home
I gotta have you
You know I need you
(Christmas) woo

I gotta have you
I said, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
It's Christmas, Christmas, Christmas, Christmas, yeah
