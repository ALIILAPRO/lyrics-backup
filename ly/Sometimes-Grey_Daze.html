		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sometimes, things just seem to fall apart
When you least expect them to
Sometimes you want to pack up and leave behind
All of them and their smiles

I don't know
What to think anymore
Maybe things will get better
Maybe things will look brighter
Maybe, maybe, maybe

Sometimes, people surprise you
And people surprise me
But I guess that's the price we pay
For wanting so badly

I don't know
What to think anymore
Maybe things will get better
Maybe things will look brighter
Maybe, maybe, maybe
Maybe, sometimes

Sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes

I don't know
What to think anymore
Maybe things will get better
Maybe things will look brighter
Maybe, maybe, maybe

I don't know
What to think anymore
Maybe things will get better
Maybe things will look brighter
Maybe, maybe, maybe, yeah

Sometimes
