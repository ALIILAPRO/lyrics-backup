		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I just roll around 
With the windows tinted
5 Percent it down
Represent my city
Know I hold it down
I can't roll it down 
Anywhere I go
Everywhere I go they know they know that

Top and windows down how we ride ride ride
Ooh she caught the vibe and she wanna slide slide slide
Slippery slope like woop
213 Wit the troop 
Juno and MIKNNA got the juice
Never no flukes

This ain't the first time we done this
Love from the city we run shit
She want that ice like a tundra 
100 Foot drops like a bungee
Ooh wee, pull up red carpet to the function
The homie just got out the pen
They worried bout losing and winning again
I feel like I'm living again

Wake up, get sun, roll up, get some
Get lunch, stretch out, think about what your day bout
Never really fit no day jobs
Never really cashed on paystubs
Paid rent, paid bills, when will I get me a mill?
When will i get me a deal?

I want a house on the hills
Foreign the body and wheels
But none of that shit make you real 

Jealousy, envying others
Hoping that money won't change us
Money will show true colors 
Seen both sides of the spectrum

Look at my class, no lecture
Still I gotta throw the west up
Fuck about how you feel
I'ma go get that money still

You and your opinions, give a fuck bout those
I'm just getting money, I'm gon fuck these hoes
Double dipping flipping bags, til I can't bag more
So I stack it up, til I'm back, back home

Top and windows down how we ride ride ride
Ooh she caught the vibe and she wanna slide slide slide
Slippery slope like woop
213 Wit the troop
Juno and MIKNNA got the juice
Never no flukes

I just roll around 
With the windows tinted
5 Percent it down
Represent my city
Know I hold it down
I can't roll it down 
Anywhere I go
Everywhere I go they know they know that
