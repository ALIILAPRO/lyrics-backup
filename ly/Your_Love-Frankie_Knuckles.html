		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't let go

When I'm with you I believe that your love is true
When we love you turn me out, you know what to do
Visions really blow my mind fantasizing all the time

When your body's next to me, I begin to sweat
When we touch I lose control, now you know what's next
Fantasizing all the time, move your body next to mine

Well, I need your love
Well, I need your love
Well, I need your love

Don't make me wait too long
Oh, I need your touch
Don't make me wait for your love

I can't let go
I can't let go
I can't let go

I can't let go
I can't let go
I can't let go
I can't let go
I can't let go
I can't let go
I can't let go
I can't let go
I can't let go
