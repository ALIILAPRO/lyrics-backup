		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know how to hurt 
I know how to heal
I know what to show 
And what to conceal 
I know when to talk 
And I know when to touch 
No one ever died from wanting too much 

The world is not enough 
But it is such a perfect place to start, my love 
And if you're strong enough 
Together we can take the world apart, my love 

People like us 
Know how to survive 
There's no point in living 
If you can't feel the life 
We know when to kiss 
And we know when to kill 
If we can't have it all 
Then nobody will 

The world is not enough 
But it is such a perfect place to start, my love 
And if you're strong enough 
Together we can take the world apart, my love 

I feel sick 
I feel scared 
I feel ready 
And yet unprepared

The world is not enough 
But it is such a perfect place to start, my love 
And if you're strong enough 
Together we can take the world apart, my love 

The world is not enough 
The world is not enough
No, nowhere near enough
The world is not enough
