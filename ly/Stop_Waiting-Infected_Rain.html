		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  "Waiting for someone to save us
Waiting for something to change
Waiting someone to forgive us
Waiting and swallowing the rage 

Days keep passing in breathless expectation 
Fear had taken the best of us
Here we are again, expecting a salvation
Waiting for someone to be sorry for us

We are always waiting
What are we waiting for?
What are we waiting for?
We are expecting a salvation
Waiting for someone to be sorry for us

Never forget what you're really fighting for
Never forget what you live for
Let go the substance of your nightmares
Let go the fear...

As long as the heart keeps beating
As long as your scars keep on healing
As long as the heart keeps beating
As long as your scars keep on healing

We are always waiting
What are we waiting for?
What are we waiting for?
We are expecting a salvation
Waiting for someone to be sorry for us
We are always waiting
What are we waiting for?
What are we waiting for?
We are expecting a salvation
Waiting for someone to be sorry for us

Fight, fight, fight for your dreams
Fight, fight, get up from your knees
Fight, fight, fight for your dreams
Fight, fight, get up from your knees
Fight, fight, fight for your dreams
Fight, fight, get up from your knees
Fight, fight, fight for your dreams
Fight, fight, fight, fight,get up from your knees

Get up, get up from your knees
Fight, fight for your dreams
Get up, get up from your knees
Fight, fight for your 

Get up, get up from your knees
Fight, fight for your dreams
Get up, get up from your knees
Fight, fight for your dreams
Get up, get up from your knees
Fight, fight for your dreams
Get up, get up from your knees
Fight, fight for your dreams"
