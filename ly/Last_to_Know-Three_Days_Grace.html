		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She just walked away
Why didn't she tell me?
And where do I go tonight?
This isn't happening to me
This can't be happening to me
She didn't say a word
Just walked away

You were the first to say
That we were not okay
You were the first to lie
When we were not alright
This was my first love
She was the first to go
And when she left me for you
I was the last to know

Why didn't she tell me
Where to go tonight?
She didn't say a word
She just walked away

You were the first to say
That we were not okay
You were the first to lie
When we were not alright
This was my first love
She was the first to go
And when she left me for you
I was the last to know

I'll be the first to say
That now I'm okay
And for the first time
I've opened up my eyes
This was my worst love
You'll be the first to go
And when she leaves you for dead
You'll be the last to know

I'll be the first to say
That now I'm okay
And for the first time
I've opened up my eyes
This was my worst love
You'll be the first to go
And when she leaves you for dead
You'll be the last to know
