		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm leaving
I won't be back again
You know it's been a long time coming
But I'm gonna miss her in the end

Oh, take me back to them old times
To where I didn't have a care
I've taken the time to notice
All the good times being shared
Oh, I'll miss the drinks on Fridays
After we've been working on the land
But if I could have, oh, one more day
You know I wouldn't, anyway

'Cause I gotta be leaving, oh
Won't be back again
Well, you know it's been a long time coming
I'm gonna miss her in the end
Ooh

Oh, I know we gotta make some changes
Find me a place to call my own
So many good times and memories
You know I'll miss that old home

Say my goodbyes to old Rosie, ooh
Buried in the yard
Is there something in this land
To help me understand?

Why I gotta be leaving
Won't be back again, oh
Well, you know it's been a long time coming
And I'm gonna miss her in the end

And I hope one day I'll see you again
Reminisce on all the times we shared as friends
So much time gone by
Oh, look how you have changed
But I hope you found someone to love you
Like I did, then

Before I had to be leaving, oh
I won't be back again, oh
You know it's been a long time coming
But I'm gonna miss her in the end, baby

Know I gotta be leaving
I won't be back again, oh
But you know it's been a long time coming
I'm gonna miss her in the end, oh

I've got to be, I've got to be
I've got to be leaving
Well, you know it's been a long time coming
I'm gonna miss her in the end, hey, hey
