		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Who knows how long?
I've been awake now
The shadows on my wall don't sleep
They keep calling me
Beckoning

Who knows what's right?
The lies keep getting thinner
My age has never made me wise
But I keep pushing on and on and on and on

There's nothing left to say now oh oh
There's nothing left to say now oh oh

I'm giving up, giving up he he
Giving up now
I'm giving up, giving up he he
Giving up now

There's nothing left to say now oh oh
There's nothing left to say now oh oh

I'm giving up, giving up he he
Giving up now
I'm giving up, giving up he he
Giving up now

Below, my soul
I'm feelin' injured
Collapsing as it sees the pain
If I could only shut it out

I've come too far to see the end now
Even if my way is wrong
But I keep pushing on and on and on and on

There's nothing left to say now oh oh
There's nothing left to say now oh oh

I'm giving up, giving up he he
Giving up now
I'm giving up, giving up he he
Giving up now

There's nothing left to say now oh oh
There's nothing left to say now oh oh

I'm giving up, giving up he he
Giving up now
I'm giving up, giving up he he
Giving up now

I keep fallin', I keep fallin' down
I keep fallin', I keep fallin' down

I keep fallin', I keep fallin' down
I keep fallin', I keep fallin' down

If you could only save me
I'm drowning in the waters of myself

There's nothing left to say now oh oh
There's nothing left to say now oh oh

I'm giving up, giving up he he
Giving up now
I'm giving up, giving up he he
Giving up now

There's nothing left to say now oh oh
There's nothing left to say now oh oh

I'm giving up, giving up he he
Giving up now
I'm giving up, giving up he he
Giving up now

Where do we go from here?
I threw some rocks up at your window
I broke some rocks right through your window

Timber timber, we're falling down
Let the forest hear us out

Bumba rumba rum awh awh
Bumba rumba rum awh awh

Why can't I see what's right in front of me

We fall, we falling
We fall, we falling
We fall, we falling
We fall, we falling
