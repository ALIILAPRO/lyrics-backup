		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Crimson's ruled these pages for so long
Stories stained so deep
They won't wash off no
All these days have turned my colors to
The darkest shades of black
Have I lost something I'm never getting back

Play the last song for the lost soul
Breathe it in and breathe it out again
Write the last wrongs for the right goal
Line 'em up, I've paid the consequence
Just tie this rope around my neck
Oh the blade falls quicker
Until this beating leaves my chest
Oh the blood runs thicker

Count these years with fingers on my fists
No, revenge won't save this life I've lived
All these scars have turned my colors
To the darkest shades of black
I've walked this road so far
I'm never coming back, no

Play the last song for the lost soul
Breathe it in and breathe it out again
Write the last wrongs for the right goal
Line 'em up, I've paid the consequence
Just tie this rope around my neck
Oh the blade falls quicker
Until this beating leaves my chest
Oh the blood runs thicker

The melodies for justice never served
The lyrics only sing to mark my words, oh

Play the last song for the lost soul
Breathe it in and breathe it out again
Write the last wrongs for the right goal
Line 'em up, I've paid the consequence
Just tie this rope around my neck
Oh the blade falls quicker
Until this beating leaves my chest
Oh the blood runs thicker
Oh the blade falls quicker
Oh the blood runs thicker
