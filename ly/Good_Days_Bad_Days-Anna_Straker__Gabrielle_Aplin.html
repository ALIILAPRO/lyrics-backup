		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm hungover again
I went out with my friends
They said it'd be fine
To get out of my mind
Now I'm stuck in my bed
Didn't bail on my plans
So I can sit here and cry
And think of the time in 2009
When I said the wrong thing
I remind myself that it's okay
You can feel the love without the pain
Here's to the good days, to the bad days
To the breakups and the birthdays
Here's to the best days, to the worst days
'Cause I know that I'll be okay
Here's to the good days, to the bad days
To the mistakes and the first dates
Here's to the best days, to the worst days
'Cause I know that I'll be okay
When I look at my phone
I can feel so alone
Stop convincing myself
That everyone else is doing better than me
'Cause at 10:23
Still don't never ground me
Everything that I got
Doesn't feel like a lot
When I'm unhappy
But I tell myself that it's okay
You can feel the love without the pain
Here's to the good days, to the bad days
To the breakups and the birthdays
Here's to the best days, to the worst days
'Cause I know that I'll be okay
Here's to the good days, to the bad days
To the mistakes and the first dates
Here's to the best days, to the worst days
'Cause I know that I'll be okay
I'll be okay, I'll be okay, I'll be okay
'Cause I know that I'll be okay
I tell myself that it's okay
You can feel the sun without the rain
And darker nights make brighter days
You can feel the love without the pain
Here's to the good days, to the bad days
To the breakups, and the birthdays
Here's to the best days, to the worst days
'Cause I know that I'll be okay
Here's to the good days, to the bad days
To the mistakes and the first dates
Here's to the best days, to the worst days
'Cause I know that I'll be okay
I'll be okay, I'll be okay, I'll be okay
'Cause I know that I'll be okay
I'll be okay, I'll be okay, I'll be okay
'Cause I know that I'll be okay
