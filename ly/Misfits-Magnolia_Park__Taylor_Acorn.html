		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You make me fucking sick
And twisted (twisted)
You're always taking shots 
You missed me (you missed me)
Branded me with blood and lipstick (lipstick)
Can't get you off my tongue
Thought we were fucking done
We're misfits

You write it on the wall
The silence takes control
Your face just says it all
A death grip on my soul
I'm buried in the ground
A secret safe and sound
I'll never fit your role

Yeah, I'm about to lose it (lose it)
And I just can't refuse it (refuse it)
And girl you got a screw loose
Screws loose
Do you know that you're abusive

You make me fucking sick
And twisted (twisted)
You're always taking shots 
You missed me (you missed me)
Branded me with blood and lipstick (lipstick)
Can't get you off my tongue
Thought we were fucking done
We're misfits

(Keep hearing your name)
(And I wish I could forget it)
(You burned a hole in my head)
(And now I'm falling apart)
(You say you're sick of the cycle)
(But you're the one making it spin)
(Here we go again and again)

Yeah, I'm about to lose it (lose it)
And I just can't refuse it (refuse it)
And girl you got a screw loose
Screws loose
Do you know that you're abusive

You make me fucking sick
And twisted (twisted)
You're always taking shots 
You missed me (you missed me)
Branded me with blood and lipstick (lipstick)
Can't get you off my tongue
Thought we were fucking done
You make me fucking sick
And twisted (twisted)
You're always taking shots 
You missed me (you missed me)
Branded me with blood and lipstick (and lipstick)
Can't get you off my tongue
Thought we were fucking done

You make me fucking sick
And twisted 
You're always taking shots 
You missed me 
Branded me with blood and lipstick 
Can't get you off my tongue
Thought we were fucking done

(We're misfits)

We're fucking misfits
We're misfits
