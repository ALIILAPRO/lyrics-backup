		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
When you meet me, when you see me
You know how to holla
You know who I am

Ix-nay on the bullshit, man
When I roll back to Cleveland, I can't believe them
Sounds of the non-believers
Outcast 'til I'm in dirt before it did hurt
Now I can overstand how you could dismiss or front on
Ask me how I feel about the ones with closed eyes
My words how I feel exactly are, "Fuck that"
I don't give a damn 'bout nan one hater talking down
Don't be afraid at all, y'all
All I ask of all y'all is to please 

Embrace the martian, embrace the martian
I come in peace but I need y'all rockin' with me
Please, embrace the martian
And this is how it sounds

See I must tell you all now
Keep on acting funny, cool with me
I am here to change that
How you're thinking often and it's startin'
I am here to show you how it feels to be new
Look at what I made you, guide to teach you
Honest but insecure, cool, and you are fooled
By the heavy-heavy amounts of
Malarkey mixed with garbage, I am it, dawg
Don't be afraid at all, y'all
All I ask of all y'all is to please

Embrace the martian, embrace the martian
I come in peace but I need y'all rockin' with me
Please, embrace the martian
And this is how it sounds

Embrace the martian, embrace the martian
I come in peace but I need y'all rockin' with me
Please, embrace the martian

License to ill
I promise I won't turn the whole world to Cloverfield
On the real, yeah, I will
I'll destroy it and then rebuild just for thrills
Sometimes you got to do it
Sometimes you show the tough love
No one is above
What you are hearing now, dude
No matter who else included, I'm saluted
I'm saluted (yeah)
No matter who else included, I'm saluted (yeah, yeah)
I'm saluted

Oh
Whether you appeal or not
This is the real
Real recognize real
You
You are me
Like it or not and I
I am you
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Embrace the martian, embrace the martian
I come in peace but I need y'all rockin' with me
Please, embrace the martian
And this is how it sounds

Embrace the martian, embrace the martian
I come in peace but I need y'all rockin' with me
Please, embrace the martian
And this is how it sounds

Ooh, ooh
And this is how it sounds
In my mind, ooh
Hm (Plain Pat, what up?)
