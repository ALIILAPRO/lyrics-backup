		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The beat crying for me, it's shedding tears
The woman that I want with, she is
I want to grab her close, but she's never near
The love that we had, it just disappeared
The shit is gone, up and vanished
The cheating that I did left her f- damaged
And now that she's gone its too much to manage
A hard pill to swallow, but I understand it
She said she wanna try some new things
Out in VC, she probably got a new fling
But behind every summer, there's a new spring
At the dispensary, tryna cop some Blue Dream
Smoke a little, pour yourself some drink
Meditate upon your life, take some time to think
I'd give you everything, plus a kitchen sink
My love is on the edge, its at the f- brink

It's love that really helps
Be-
It's love that really helps
Believe in-

Darling, darling, I can stay awake all night
Baby, baby, I will make mistakes all right
'Cause the body asks so much, and your body asks so much
Of me
Sweet dreams

So we the love they was dreaming of?
You know the couple they be speaking of
They'll look at the past, and wanna bring it up
But we ain't never look back, we say they jinxing us
'Cause all we need is trust, we don't need to rush
They wish us luck, and we don't need it much
Louis V cuff link, Louis V clutch
His, and hers, when we splurge, everything is us
Yeah, everything is us
Tables turned, now I'm saying everything was-
Once, upon a time or two
Too many times a white lie was a fight with you
Too many hoes on my line, I was lying too
But ain't a woman in the world I would've wifed but you
We was cool as crew, now its who's who?
What we use to do, became what we ain't use to

It's love that really helps
Be-
It's love that really helps
Believe in -

Darling, darling, I can stay awake all night
Baby, baby, I will make mistakes all right
'Cause the body asks so much, and your body asks so much
Of me
Sweet dreams
