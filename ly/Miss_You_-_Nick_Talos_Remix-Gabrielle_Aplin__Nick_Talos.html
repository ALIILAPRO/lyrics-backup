		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So what you been doing?
I've been loving my life waking up on my own
Are you doing the same thing?
You can say if you like but I don't need to know
And I, I've been wondering why we've been waste all this time
So what you been doing?
I thought that I saw you, I guess I was wrong
Are you doing the same thing?
Convincing yourself you're better alone
And I could tell you how you never left my mind
Then you tell me that you miss me and I'm like
Oh God, I miss you too
It's all I ever do
I'm coming back to you
And I won't let go
Oh God, I miss you too
We got making up to do
I'm coming back to you
And I won't let go again
Oh, I won't let go again
So what were we thinking?
You got me a cab and we said we were done
And I thought I was fine
But the days were so long and they rolled into one
And I, I couldn't believe you were taking it in your stride
Then you tell me that you miss me and I'm like
Oh God, I miss you too
It's all I ever do
I'm coming back to you
And I won't let go
Oh God, I miss you too
We got making up to do
I'm coming back to you
And I won't let go again
Oh, I won't let go again
Will you be my best friend?
Will you be my last?
I need somebody who can love me like that
You be my best friend
Will you be my last?
I need somebody who can love me like that
Oh God, I miss you too
It's all I ever do
I'm coming back to you
And I won't let go
Oh God, I miss you too
We got making up to do
I'm coming back to you
And I won't let go again
Oh, I won't let go again
Will you be my best friend?
Will you be my last?
I need somebody who can love me like that
Will you be my best friend?
Will you be my last?
I need somebody who can love me like that
