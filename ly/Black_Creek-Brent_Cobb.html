		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Help me escape from this deserted sea
Lord I think that the devil might be after me
I don't want to waste my integrity
I'm just a man livin' a one night stand, I tell you what I need

Oh Black Creek, take me to that place
Wash my sins away
Oh Black Creek, take me to that place
Wash my sins away

Just a little taste, that's all I need
Fruitful harvest in a wicked garden off a forbidden tree
A simple scheme from judging fate
Simple as it may be, it's more than I can take

Oh Black Creek, take me to that place
Wash my sins away
Oh Black Creek, take me to that place
Wash my sins away

Guitar man, play me a tune
I got one foot tappin' and nothing to lose, I'm lost
I don't want to be found
The end for me could be comin' real soon
I'd like a glass of tea mixed with a sassafras root 
And a breath of higher ground

Oh Black Creek, take me to that place
Wash my sins away
Oh Black Creek, take me to that place
Wash my sins away
Won't you wash my sins away
