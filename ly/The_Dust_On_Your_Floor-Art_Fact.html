		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One touch from your hand
A look from your eyes
Enough to make me fall
That's what I want when you call

One thing to decide
A word from your mouth
Enough to make me cry
That's what I want when you pass by

The dust on your floor
Don't want to taste it anymore
All the moves that we make combining the actual purpose and mistakes

On nails for a day
On ice, are we not?
Afraid to say too much
So scared if we not keep in touch

I just don't know if we can make it
Together forever
Please stay where you are
I want to know that I can have you

The dust on your floor
Don't want to taste it anymore
All the moves that we make combining the actual purpose and mistakes
