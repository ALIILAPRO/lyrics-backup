		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So watch the sun as it falls
It's just like life, it comes and goes
And my friend, through some rough town
Show me everything, there is to life like

Had a smile with tears in your eyes
Tears in your eyes, tears in your eyes
Tears in your eyes, eyes

Say, we can make this better if we try
Just let the fire burn just a little while
Sit and watch these words turn to dust
Watch the smoke in the sky, just us

Had a smile with tears in your eyes
Tears in your eyes, tears in your eyes
Tears in your eyes, eyes

Another day, another town
You turn to me and say, "Everything is fine"
No need to worry, you've been kind
These things that I love they take some time

Had a smile with tears in your eyes
Tears in your eyes, tears in your eyes
Tears in your eyes, eyes
