		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Defaced
Dethroned
The fate
Unknown
Unsure
Unkempt
His pride
None left

Snatched with rage, his gift was thrown
Blindly into the depths below
Irretrievable under that stone

Almost stopped it
On the brink
Somehow
He still thinks
Today is
Just a blip
The footnote that ends
His entry at the center
Of all self-respecting
Encyclopedias

That face he will not see again
Will always be with him will never leave
Will mock him in his sleep, remind him

In every reflection, translucent and shimmering
Those marbles appearing to make him

Weightless as ever, forever weak
Forever needing a distraction to speak

Elephant eyeballs hovering over all thought
With lips ever puckered, aimless fishes within

He's still in, still in, (?)
He looks capable
(?)

He'll never tell anyone, and no one will ever find out
It will always be with him no doubt
He wants to feel sympathy for him
But he'll come back again and again
Oh-oh oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
