		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I seek to speak the words of wisdom
I seek to speak the words of truth
So I,
I reach out for the heavens
I reach out for the stars

Are the answers out there?
Or do we all wait until the end?
I need a reason to care,
A new light and eternal flame
All I want to know,
Is are the answers out there?
Yeah

I feel the need to seek perfection
I feel the want to even more
From my life
I reach out for the heavens
I reach out for the stars

Are the answers out there?
Or do we all wait until the end?
I need a reason to care,
A new light and eternal flame
All I want to know,
Is are the answers out there?
Yeah (Yeah)

Yeah,
Yeah,
Yeah,

Yeah,
Yeah,
Yeah,

Are the answers out there?
Or do we all wait until the end?
I need a reason to care,
A new light and eternal flame
All I want to know,
Is are the answers out there?
Yeah
