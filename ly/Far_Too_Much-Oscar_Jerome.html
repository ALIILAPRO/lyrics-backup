		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Please don't make me choose yeah
(Every time I wonder, just a little longer)
Because there's far too much to loose yeah
(Every time the feeling's only getting stronger
There's ones and then there's twos yeah
(Let me hold you, hold you, hold you, hold you close now)
So lets follow all the clues

Hey don't be late now
Hey life wont wait now

Please don't make me choose yeah
(Every time I wonder, just a little longer)
Because there's far too much to loose yeah
(Every time the feeling's only getting stronger
There's ones and then there's twos yeah
(Let me hold you, hold you, hold you, hold you close now)
And this one was made for you

Hey don't be late now
Hey life wont wait now
Hey don't be late now
Hey life wont wait now

Please don't make me choose yeah
(Every time I wonder, just a little longer)
Because there's far too much to loose yeah
(Every time the feeling's only getting stronger)
There's ones and then there's twos yeah
(Let me hold you, hold you, hold you, hold you close now)
And this one was made, this one was made for you

Hey don't be late now
Hey life wont wait now
Hey don't be late now
Hey life wont wait now

(Every time I wonder, just a little longer
Every time the feeling's only getting stronger
Let me hold you, hold you, hold you, hold you close now
Ooooh)

Hey don't be late now
Hey life wont wait now
Hey don't be late now
Hey life won't wait now
