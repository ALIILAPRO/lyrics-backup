		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Somewhere deep down in time
some old faded feelings of mine

I can't reach them, there aint no key
Its just laying there, its covered up for me

Somewhere deep down in the sea
Some old faded memories of me

I can't reach them, there aint no key
But if you really like to see it, search for mozes he could split the sea

Great times, great memories
Its not gone but its all covered up for me
Its not gone but it is what it is
You are my atlantis

Blue, you and me are through
Blue, anoter point of view
You are my atlantis but i dont think i would send this note to you 
Baby we are through

Great times, great memories
Its not gone but its all covered up for me
Its not gone but it is what it is
You are my atlantis

Great times, great memories
Its not gone but its all covered up for me
Its not gone but it is what it is
You are my atlantis
