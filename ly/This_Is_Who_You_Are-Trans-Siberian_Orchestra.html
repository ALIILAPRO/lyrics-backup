		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sometimes
Slowly
Time brings revelation

Waiting
Softly
For someone to believe

That the ghosts we've hidden or left to die
Have now arisen and will arrive
To say what has happened
Say what has happened
Say what has happened
To me

And who would have thought
That you'd be the one
That I would have found here waiting

Lost in this night
Until you arrived
And always too blind to see

And who would have thought
That after this time
That I'd be the one you're saving

Now undisguised
The ghosts that survive
Now say what was meant to be

I never wanted to give my life away
Who ever thought it would matter any way

Wandering inside this night
Finding pieces of a life
Never sure I'd ever know what it means

It's the strangers in your life
That you'd never thought you'd meet
It's the hand that picked you up
When you're laying in the street

It's the hand that cut you down
It's the dream that someone shared
When you thought that all was lost
It's the friend that wasn't there

You can run from all the memory
But never get that far
For in the end they'll find you
For this is who you are

Change one note
Change one line
Nothing's going to be the same
Change one loss
Change one cut
Everything is re-arranged

Every act
Cruel or kind
Lost inside our memory
If you look
There in time

You'll find it in
Find it in
Find it in
You'll find it in me
