		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lemme tellya 'bout Him, Jesus is His name
And I'm all about Him
I live to bring Him praise
He is the way and the truth and the life
God is three in one
Reigning undefeated, our God has overcome

Jesus (Jesus) Jesus (Jesus) Jesus (Jesus)
Lemme tellya 'bout Him

King of kings, Lord of lords
There is no one like Him
There is none at all
Alpha and Omega, resurrected Saviour
Jesus is His name lemme tellya 'bout Him

Huh, closer than a brother
He will never leave
God is my provider, He is all I need
He is God Almighty, He will never change
We cry holy, holy, Name above all names

Most High (Most High) Most High (Most High)
Most High (Most High)
Lemme tellya 'bout Him

King of kings, Lord of lords
There is no one like Him
There is none at all
Alpha and Omega, resurrected Saviour
Jesus is His name lemme tellya 'bout Him

Yeah, there's a billion angels
Bowed before Your throne
There's a sound of all the saints
As we praise You alone
King above all kings, Lord above all lords
You're the one who is and
Was and reigns forevermore
Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord Almighty
Worthy to receive the, power and the glory
There is no one like Him
There is none at all
Jesus is His name, tell 'em, tell 'em
Tell 'em alright, alright, hey!

Jesus (Jesus) Jesus (Jesus) Jesus (Jesus) Jesus (Jesus)
Jesus (Jesus) Jesus (Jesus) Jesus (Jesus)
Lemme tellya 'bout Him
Tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em
