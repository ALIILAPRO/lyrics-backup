		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got this target
Right here on my back
They're aiming where I was
Not where I'm at
They ain't stopped me
Since I was eighteen
I'm moving faster
Than my enemies

I can't slow down
I can't get stuck
I'd rather die than have to hang it up

Don't wanna look up
And it be over
Don't want to wish that
I had longer
It's my time
Yeah it's my town
I pray my feet won't ever slow me down
Don't fail me now

I saw my last dream
Roll out around me
I'm trying to chase me
Down a fantasy
I felt this moonlight
Reach down and touch me
I need another night
Before you leave

Don't wanna look up
And it be over
Don't want to wish that
I had longer
It's my time
Yeah it's my town
Whoa it's my town
It's my town
I pray my feet won't ever slow me down
Don't fail me now
Don't fail me now
I pray my feet won't ever slow me down

Don't fail me now
Don't fail me now
I pray my feet won't ever slow me down

Don't fail me now
Don't fail me now
I pray my feet won't ever slow me down

It's my town
It's my town
It's my town
It's my town
I pray my feet won't ever slow me down
Feet don't ever slow me down
Feet don't ever slow me down

Don't fail me now
Don't fail me now
I pray my feet won't ever slow me down
