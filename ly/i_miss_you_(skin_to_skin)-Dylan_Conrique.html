		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All those nights where we'd laugh until the sun came up
I had to have you
And no matter how late it got
I didn't even care if my mom found out
I had to

Now I'm lying in my bed
I've been in it since you left
Truth is nothing that you said
Can make me love you less

I hate myself for missing, missing you
I know I'm not supposed to
I wish I could forget you but it's so hard to
I know I'm not supposed to

I, I miss you
I, I miss you (I)
I, I miss you (I, I)
(Miss you, miss you)

Reckless nights
It was dangerous but you got me so high
What happened to you?
'Cause we went from skin to skin to you never wanna see me ever again
Said you had to, why'd you have to?

Now I'm lying in my bed
I've been in it since you left
Truth is nothing that you said
Can make me love you less

I hate myself for missing, missing you (woah)
I know I'm not supposed to
I wish I could forget you but it's so hard to
I know I'm not supposed to

I, I miss you
I, I miss you (I)
I, I miss you (I, I)
(Miss you, miss you)

All those stupid fights that I'd go 'til I cry
I don't know how to leave them behind
Venom falls from your lips
The same ones I used to kiss
And I'm trying to get you out of my mind

I hate myself (I hate myself) for missing, missing you (miss you)
I know I'm not supposed to
I wish I could (I wish I could) forget you but it's so hard to (hard to)
I know I'm not supposed to

I, I miss you
I, I miss you (I)
I, I miss you (I, I)
(Miss you, miss you)
I, I miss you
I, I miss you
I, I miss you
