		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  Eyes, can see it in your
Eyes, can see it in your
Eyes, can see it in your
Eyes, can see it in your
Eyes, can see it in your
Eyes, can see it in your
Eyes, can see it in your

When dawn breaks, see it in your eyes
This seems fake, superheroes disguise
When dawn breaks, see it in your eyes
This seems fake, superheroes disguise
When dawn breaks, see it in your eyes
This seems fake, superheroes disguise
When dawn breaks, see it in your eyes
This seems fake, superheroes disguise

You can go to sleep now, baby
I've got the world outside
You can go to sleep now, girl
I've got the world outside
You can go to sleep now, baby
I've got the world outside
You can go to sleep now, girl
I've got the world outside (I've got the world)

When dawn breaks, see it in your eyes
This seems fake
When dawn breaks, see it in your eyes
This seems fake, superheroes disguise
When dawn breaks, see it in your eyes
This seems fake, superheroes disguise

Eyes, can see it in your
Eyes, can see it in your
Eyes, can see it in your
Eyes, can see it in your
Eyes, can see it in your
I'm sleeping, but you're still awake
I'm sleeping, but you're still awake

You can go to sleep now, baby
I've got the world outside
You can go to sleep now, girl
I've got the world outside
You can go to sleep now, baby
I've got the world outside
You can go to sleep now, girl
I've got the world outside (I've got the world)

'Cause I'm sleeping, but you're still awake
Yeah I'm sleeping 'cause you're still awake
'Cause I'm sleeping, but you're still awake
Yeah I'm sleeping 'cause you're still awake

You can go to sleep now, baby
I've got the world outside
You can go to sleep now, girl
I've got the world outside
I've got the world outside
While you're still awake
While you're still awake
While you're still awake
I'm sleeping, but you're still awake
I'm sleeping, but you're still awake
