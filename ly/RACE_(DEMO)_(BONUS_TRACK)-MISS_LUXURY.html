		  Lady's, start your engines!
LETS RIDE!

How many laps you wanna take to meet me?
You'll never catch up only if you pay me
I'm high on fuel don't take a bullet to slow this down
I'm undefeated ready to attack for the crown
I'm gonna ruin you
Kill you watch you levitate
Your 15 minutes of fame slowly disintegrates
I'm competition my engine is scary to face
These bitches want me to race them but baby come get a taste

This ain't a race cause I just always win
Your lack of taste will always be a sin
You're just the duchess I'm the king and queen
You should've known the hot bitches are mean
Hundred miles per hour is not enough for you
My force of friction is hot and fast to screw with you
I got the looks and the plastic to cover up this face
Just give up baby just know you'll never win the race

How many laps you bet to think you'll beat me?
Is the carpet comfortable do you even see me?
Your energy is about as low as your IQ
Is that enough to take the crown? bitch you're through
I'm gonna ruin you
Kill you watch you levitate
Your 15 minutes of fame slowly disintegrates
I'm competition my engine is scary to face
These bitches want me to race them but baby come get a taste

This ain't a race cause I just always win
Your lack of taste will always be a sin
You're just the duchess I'm the king and queen
You should've known the hot bitches are mean
Hundred miles per hour is not enough for you
My force of friction is hot and fast to screw with you
I got the looks and the plastic to cover up this face
Just give up baby just know you'll never win the race

Hundred miles per hour is not enough for you
My force of friction is hot and fast to screw with you
Screw with you
Screw with you
Screw with you
Screw with you

This ain't a race cause I just always win
Your lack of taste will always be a sin
You're just the duchess I'm the king and queen
You should've known the hot bitches are mean
Hundred miles per hour is not enough for you
My force of friction is hot and fast to screw with you
I got the looks and the plastic to cover up this face
Just give up baby just know you'll never win the race
