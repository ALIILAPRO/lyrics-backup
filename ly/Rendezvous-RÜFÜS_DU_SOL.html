		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm alright, I want to get some
Through the night, be my lover
I've been waiting all this time
I want to get it, be my lover today, yeah
I want to get it, be my lover today, yeah

I'm alright, I want to get some
Through the night, be my lover
I've been waiting all this time
I want to get it, be my lover today, yeah
I want to get it, be my lover today, yeah

Don't say you don't want me
'Cause I'm too caught up on it
Don't think that I'm leaving
'Cause I won't give it up again

Don't say you don't want me
'Cause I'm too caught up on it
Don't think that I'm leaving
'Cause I won't give it up again

Don't say you don't want me
'Cause I'm too caught up on it
Don't think that I'm leaving
'Cause I won't give it up again

Don't say you don't want me
'Cause I'm too caught up on it
Don't think that I'm leaving
'Cause I won't give it up again

Looking fine, taking me under
Don't be shy, be my lover
Your lips are on my mind
You won't forget it, be my lover today, yeah
You won't forget it, be my lover today, yeah

Don't say you don't want me
'Cause I'm too caught up on it
Don't think that I'm leaving
'Cause I won't give it up again

Don't say you don't want me
'Cause I'm too caught up on it
Don't think that I'm leaving
'Cause I won't give it up again
