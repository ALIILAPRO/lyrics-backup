Hey, I want it all, don't have to choose
And when the heart wants what it wants, what can I do?
So I'll take that one, that one, yeah, that one too
Luxury and opulence, Cartiers and Tesla X's
Calabasas, I deserve it
Call me crazy, call me selfish
I'm the baddest and I'm worth it

Gimme just a little bit more, little bit of excess
Oh, me, oh, my
I don't wanna hear "No, no"
Only want a "Yes, yes"
Oh, me, oh, my
Gimme just a little bit of (excess, excess)
Oh, me, oh, my
Gimme just a little bit more, little bit of excess
Gimme just a little bit more, little bit of excess
Oh, me, oh, my
I don't wanna hear "No, no"
Only want a "Yes, yes"
Oh, me, oh, my
Gimme just a little bit of (excess, excess)
Oh, me, oh, my
Gimme just a little bit more, little bit of excess

Flex
When all that's left is immaterial
And the price we paid is unbelievable
And I'm takin' in as much as I can hold
Here are the things you'll never know
Make me less, so, I want more
Bought a zip-code, at the mall
Call me crazy, call me selfish
Say I'm neither, would you believe her?

Gimme just a little bit more, little bit of excess
Oh, me, oh, my
I don't wanna hear "No, no"
Only want a "Yes, yes"
Oh, me, oh, my
Gimme just a little bit of (excess, excess)
Oh, me, oh, my
Gimme just a little bit more, little bit of excess

Oh, me, oh, my
Where did it go awry?
When all this time, Heaven was in our eyes
So, say goodnight, forget about it 'til the end of time
Yeah, I want more, more, more, more
More, more, more, more, more

Gimme just a little bit more, little bit of excess
Oh, me, oh, my
I don't wanna hear "No, no"
Only want a "Yes, yes"
Oh, me, oh, my
Gimme just a little bit
Oh, me, oh, my
Gimme just a little bit more, I need it now
Gimme just a little bit more, little bit of excess
Oh, me, oh, my
I don't wanna hear "No, no"
Only want a "Yes, yes"
Oh, me, oh, my
Gimme just a little bit
Oh, me, oh, my
Gimme just a little bit, little bit of

A little more (excess, excess)
A little bit more (excess, excess)
A little bit more (excess, excess)
