		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Haters call me bitch
Call me fagot call me whitey
But I am something that you'll never be

(Hey)
I won't look prettier if I smile for the picture
Motherfuckers never liked me then and they
Sure won't like me now
Don't try to drag me down with your cliche
Your fake grin fits your faker face
But I find pleasure in your misery

Yeah
I will step on you on my way up
And I will step on you on my way back down
I will step on you on my way up
And I will step on you on my way back down
Haters call me bitch
Call fagot call me whitey
But I am something that you'll never be

(Hey)
Haters call me bitch
Call me faggot call me whitey
But I am something that you'll never be

(Hey)
I'll be your scapegoat, I'll be your saviour
I'm the better of two evils
I'm the better of two evils (yeah yeah yeah)
I want to hang all you cattle
With your velvet rope
Motherfuckers step up and get into
An orderly line.
I'll Show you how to make a muscle:
It takes less strength to grin than
It does to spit on all you
Paparazzi Nazis

Yeah
I will step on you on my way up
And I will step on you on my way back down
Haters call me bitch
Call me fagot call me whitey
But I am something that you'll never be

(Hey)
Haters call me bitch
Call me fagot call me whitey
But I am something that you'll never be

(Hey)
I'll be your scapegoat, I'll be your saviour
I'm the better of two evils
I'm the better of two evils (yeah yeah yeah)
Don't try to lead me to temptation
Don't try to lead me to temptation
Don't try to lead me to temptation
Don't try to lead me to temptation
I've been delivered and I already know the way
Haters call me bitch
Call me fagot call me whitey
But I am something that you'll never be

(Hey)
Haters call me bitch
Call me faggot call me whitey
But I am something that you'll never be

(Hey)
I'll be your scapegoat, I'll be your savior
I'm the better of two evils
I'm the better of two evils (yeah yeah yeah)
