		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hear you whisper to me
From a darkened room these
Echos left inside my head won’t end til they consume me
I hear you callin'
I hear you callin' me out
You keep on takin'
You keep on takin' me down
I know
I walk on a tight rope
Nervous shaking in my legs has got me lookin' psycho
I feel you comin'
I feel you comin' around
To you I’m nothin'
I feel it start to slip
It seems to be a habit
I’m closer to the edge than I have ever been
Maybe I am cursed
Maybe I am gifted
Something tore inside of me
Now everything has shifted
I’ve been feelin' twisted
I’ve been feelin' twisted
Call me paranoid
Call it my addiction
But I could lose my head
With just a little bit of friction
I’ve been feelin' twisted
I’ve been feelin' twisted
I entertain the thoughts that always seemed to walk alone
I hardly notice as my fingers turn to icy tones
They say they’ll hold me
They wanna own me
But in the end the feelings lonely
(I wait too long)
Oh tell em no
Go on tell em no
(I wait too long)
Now they open up all the doors I own
(I wait too long)
Step out just to breathe
You don’t see what I see
What’s real to you don’t seem to real to me
I feel it start to slip
(And I know that)
It seems to be a habit
(And I see that)
I’m closer to the edge than I have ever been
Maybe I am cursed
Maybe I am gifted
Something tore inside of me
Now everything has shifted
I’ve been feelin' twisted
I’ve been feelin' twisted
Call me paranoid
Call it my addiction
I could lose my head
With just a little bit of friction
I’ve been feelin' twisted
I’ve been feelin' twisted
I hide in places you can’t see
But you know walls have eyes here
Watching the ones that lie here
They close
They close their eyes so they breathe
Can’t help but lose your mind here
Won’t even know you died here
Fade off
I stare right through a haze
Of pictures from before
As focus starts to fade
There’s nothing left to hold
Hold
It’s so cold
Call me paranoid
Call it my addiction
But I could lose my head
With just a little bit of friction
I’ve been feelin twisted
I’ve been feelin twisted
