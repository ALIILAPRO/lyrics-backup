		  Ayy, ayy, ayy
I don't wanna flex but ya owe me, ayy
I don't wanna, woah, ayy, woah, ayy, ayy
I don't wanna flex but ya owe me, ayy
Woah, ayy, ayy woah, ayy, ayy
Woah, ayy ayy, ayy
I don't wanna flex but ya owe me
Ayy, ayy, woah ayy, woah, ayy
I don't wanna flex but ya, ayy, woah
Ayy, ayy

I don't wanna flex but ya owe me, ayy, ayy
Molly wit' emotions, that's the
Old me, ayy, ayy
Two times two my Hi Tech I am frozen, ayy
Ayy hurtin' your own feelings
'cause you're nosey, ayy
Caught up in a daze just another phase, ayy
I don't know me sober, ayy
You don't know me period, ayy
Baby don't be scared, ayy
Think I'm from the dead, ayy
Picture dark and perfect, ayy
I think I'm the film, ayy
I might spike myself, ayy
Can't do Sprite with 'Tech, ayy
Lone all by myself, ayy
Can't do bro and friend, ayy
Don't deserve my win, ayy
Don't deserve my sin, ayy
I'm off X I'm bussin', ayy
I might Kodak jig, ayy

I don't wanna flex but ya owe me
This shouldn't do my dash
'cause you're nosey
I don't wanna flex but ya owe me
I don't wanna flex but ya, woah
I don't wanna flex but ya' owe me
Woah, woah, ayy, ayy
I don't wanna, but ya, woah, ayy
Woah, woah, woah ayy, woah, woah
Woah ayy, woah
