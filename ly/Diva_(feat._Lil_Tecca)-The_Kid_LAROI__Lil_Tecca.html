		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  That lil' bitch a diva, fuck and leave her
My life is a movie directed by Tarantino
Shawty is a dancer, I'm not talking Billie Jean, hoe
Oh, whoa, fuck, we know, I swear I hate these hoes
We know shawty is a eater
We know why she wanna see us
We know that she wanna be us
Oh, whoa, fuck, we know, I swear I hate these hoes

Yeah, you know, yeah, we know
Psych, you don't know
Keep it on the low-low
Told a nigga, "Lay low" (lay low)
Seven digits on the payroll (seven on the payroll)
Speakin' Guapanese to Guapo, ayy
Skrrt off, Tahoe with the tint, though (top, top)
I don't want to friends, though (at all)
I don't trust many men, ayy (many men)
And I got a small circle
It's me and many bands
I got a pack and I did it again
I ain't gon' lie, I ain't go to France
Young nigga been busy, I didn't get a chance
Glizzy finna hit him, make a nigga dance
And shawty, she a diva (diva)
She a diva (diva)
Got stripes like a cheetah (cheetah)
Like art, Mona Lisa (Lisa)
And we shootin' a movie
That's my life, I could teach ya
Never lie, don't mean to preach her
They talk, don't believe 'em

That lil' bitch a diva, fuck and leave her
My life is a movie directed by Tarantino
Shawty is a dancer, I'm not talking Billie Jean, hoe
Oh, whoa, fuck, we know, I swear I hate these hoes
We know shawty is a eater
We know why she wanna see us
We know that she wanna be us
Oh, whoa, fuck, we know, I swear I hate these hoes

Me and Tecca goin' crazy
Gettin' money, but it don't faze me
And I got your bitch, wanna face me?
She been a dub lately
Shit changed, but it ain't change me
I show up to the show and they pay me
Gettin' drip, I might skrrt to the Macy's
Countin' rackades, a nigga get lazy
Band Man, Band Man, yeah, that's what they call me
23 should be all on my back the way that I be ballin'
All these sign of me everywhere, lil' nigga, I ain't want it
Low key, yeah, I want it, your bitch, yeah, she want it

That lil' bitch a diva, fuck and leave her
My life is a movie directed by Tarantino
Shawty is a dancer, I'm not talking Billie Jean, hoe
Oh, whoa, fuck, we know, I swear I hate these hoes
We know shawty is a eater
We know why she wanna see us
We know that she wanna be us
Oh, whoa, fuck, we know, I swear I hate these hoes
