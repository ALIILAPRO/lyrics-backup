		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Yung Lan on the track)
(James about that check, boy)

I fear no man, Alhamdulillah
He took the stand, he broke my heart
I keep that fye on me like Jah
Lose two of yours, take one of ours
(Lose two of yours, take one of ours)
'Cause we gon' spin like no tomorrow
Can't sit back like Rosa Parks
Shots hit yo' melon
I don't even respect no nigga that tellin' on niggas that tellin'
You might do life, get caught as a two-time felon with these weapons
All this money put niggas in coffins way too often
I got something for you, I know my lawyer ain't takin' no losses

I'm loading these clips tonight, I told my mama I'm sorry
'Cause if they piss me off then I'ma kill somebody
I'm addicted to violence, I be movin' in silence
Steppin' we leave a footprint, burnin' money like incense
Used to struggle to pay rent, up all night we on Adderall
Fuck the ops, we gon' dead 'em all
We feel like Russians, we want war
Push up with Drac's, we gon' up the score
We gon' shoot 'til our fingers sore
Can't leave the house without my weapon, it's dangerous
Like an artist this here we 'gon paint it
Like the weather them bullets be rainin'
Real nigga in my DNA, I can't change it
No Santa, but with these ARPs, we gon' keep sleighing

I fear no man, Alhamdulillah
He took the stand, he broke my heart
I keep that fye on me like Jah
Lose two of yours, take one of ours
(Lose two of yours, take one of ours)
'Cause we gon' spin like no tomorrow
Can't sit back like Rosa Parks
Shots hit yo' melon
I don't even respect no nigga that tellin' on niggas that tellin'
You might do life, get caught as a two-time felon with these weapons
All this money put niggas in coffins way too often
I got something for you, I know my lawyer ain't takin' no losses
