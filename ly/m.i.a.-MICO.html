		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Seems like it was just last night
I was all set up for the highest heights
Oh yeah
How'd I fuck it all up again, again
Eighteen, yeah, I got big dreams
But it don't mean shit if I can't stop dreaming
Every second, yeah, I could've been there, right then
Taking over my thoughts, no I can't let it go
Say I just need to focus, but that's what I don't do best
Yeah, here we go again
Didn't mean to go MIA, IA
Got lost inside my twisted head
Couldn't go my way, too late
All my efforts to a wasted end
No, I don't really mean to
It's not how it seems
Swear I want it
Didn't wanna go MIA, IA
Yeah, I'm stuck up at the start again
Up high, tryna fake my pride
When I know deep down that I have no fight
One hit could knock me out and I'd be better off dead, yet
I'll say all this shit, how I'll make it work
And then I trip down all the steps and hurt my head
And end up eating all the words that you said
Taking over my thoughts, no I can't let it go
Say I just need to focus, but that's what I don't do best
Yeah, here we go again
Didn't mean to go MIA, IA
Got lost inside my twisted head
Couldn't go my way, too late
All my efforts to a wasted end
No, I don't really mean to
It's not how it seems
Swear I want it
Didn't wanna go MIA, IA
Yeah, I'm stuck up at the start again
Yeah, didn't wanna go MIA, IA
I, I
Didn't wanna go MIA, IA
Got lost inside my twisted head
Couldn't go my way, too late
All my efforts went wasted
Wish that I could skip ahead
MIA
Ooh
Ooh-hoo
