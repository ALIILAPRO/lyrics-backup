		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Go past the photograph and take a right
It's in the hallway under the exit
Thank you for trying to be polite
But, babe, I think we're already past that

You can be mean to me
I'm not gonna stop you
You can be a dick to me
It's what I'm used to

I can't believe I let you touch my body
I can't believe I let you get inside
You know what you did
You know what you took from me
It makes me sick to think about that night

I'd like to think you got a good heart
And your dad was just an asshole growing up
But I don't see you trying that hard to be better than he is
When will it ever get any better?
When's it gonna get any better?
When will it ever get any better?
When's it gonna get any better?
