		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm taking it slowly, you'd never know
How quick it gets lonely here at the top
Her skin feels unholy but I'm still drawn
The morals I'm holding, you know they're gone

No God, no religion
Just bad, bad decisions
No God, no religion
Just bad, bad decisions

You can be all I got, what's the difference?
Hennessy and a lot of bad decisions
All I know, all I know is bad, bad decisions

I'm only human but I'm afraid 
I may never learn from all my mistakes
Don't know what I'm doing but that's okay 
'Cause I like it that way

No God, no religion
Just bad, bad decisions
No God, no religion
Just bad, bad decisions

You can be all I got, what's the difference?
Hennessy and a lot of bad decisions
All I know, all I know is bad, bad decisions
You can be all I got what's the difference?
You and me and a lot of bad decisions
All I know, all I know is bad, bad decisions

Bitter ends to the nights
I'm along for the ride
Out of breath, out of time
Everything has a price

Bitter ends to the nights
I'm along for the ride
Out of breath, out of time
Everything has a price

You can be all I got, what's the difference?
Hennessy and a lot of bad decisions
All I know, all I know is bad, bad decisions
You can be all I got, what's the difference?
You and me and a lot of bad decisions
All I know, all I know is bad, bad decisions
