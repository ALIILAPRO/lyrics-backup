		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, I came upon a child of God
He was walking along the road
And I asked him, "Where are you going?"
And this he told me

"Well, I'm going on down to Yasgur's farm
Gonna join in a rock 'n' roll band
I'm going to camp out on the land
I'm gonna try an' get my soul free"

We are stardust
We are golden
And we've got to get ourselves
Back to the garden

"Then can I walk beside you?
I have come here to lose the smog
And I feel to be a cog in something turning"

"Well, maybe it's just the time of year
Or maybe it's the time of man
I don't know who I am
But life is for learning"

We are stardust
We are golden
And we've got to get ourselves
Back to the garden

By the time we got to Woodstock
We were half a million strong
And everywhere there was song and celebration

And I dreamed I saw the bombers
Riding shotgun in the sky
They were turning into butterflies
Above our nation

We are stardust
Billion year old carbon
We are golden
Caught in the devil's bargain
And we've got to get ourselves
Back to the garden
