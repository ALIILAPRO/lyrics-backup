		  Tough love
Tough love
I'm above it
Oh-oh, ooh

I be in my head sometimes
Heavy in my passion
This my pleasure
I know about passion, hmm
I just need that person, hmm
Baby, I know you
Baby not normal
This not my voice
Speakin' through your wine red lips
Ice in my fire, no tension
I just got my fuck into my senses
If you're not my height, you're not that high
Bliss will help my mind
Shame on me for how I've been livin'

Hey, never had a plan B
Say you wanna sit by me
When you wanna hang all week
She just put her bitch on me
And they cryin' with me
Maybe some' smoke weed
I be goin' crazy
Surely you were my family

I be in my head sometimes
Heavy in my passion
This my pleasure
I know about passion, hmm
I just need that person, hmm
Baby, I know you
Baby not normal
This not my voice
Speakin' through your wine red lips
Ice in my fire, no tension
I just got my fuck into my senses
If you're not my height, you're not that high
Bliss will help my mind
Shame on me for how I've been livin'

Tell me, baby, is it real?
Or are you alone as well?
Drownin' in your feelings too deep
You know that I'll be right there
It's not hard to understand
We want a home to go to, but got more live too live
Made a lot apart and feeling every emotion at once
For someone, now I'm fallin', I'm standin' in love
I won't have to go around searchin' for the real
I think you already know it
It's the regular things that you do that really keep me goin'
Be the quiet ones that just walk by that you never really notice (notice)
Same ones I had runnin' in and out never took me out of focus
Ow

Oh, oh, ooh
