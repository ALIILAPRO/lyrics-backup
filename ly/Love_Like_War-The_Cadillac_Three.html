		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, I was drinking whiskey
You were drinking wine
Only the trash man knows the truth
'Cause empty bottles don't lie
And Sunday morning hurts, don't it
What did we say?
Eyes straight full of Marlboro Reds
And the hole in the front door screen says

We were up all night
Breaking each other's hearts
Throwing four letter words 'round
Like kisses in the dark
When we both know that last swig of Drum
Is the last thing we need
'Cause the devil's in the buzz

I hate you, I love you
I never wanna see you again
Baby, hang on, let me hold you
And we're back in the sheets again
Making love like war is over
And nobody won
Making love like war is over
And nobody won, yeah

When does it all begin?
And where does it end?
The times we came out clean
I can count on one hand
Oh, maybe it's all me
Or maybe it's all you
But when fire and gasoline come together
It's only gonna lead to

We were up all night
Breaking each other's hearts
Throwing four letter words 'round
Like kisses in the dark
When we both know that last swig of Drum
Is the last thing we need
'Cause the devil's in the buzz

I hate you, I love you
I never wanna see you again
Baby, hang on, let me hold you
And we're back in the sheets again
Making love like war is over
And nobody won
Making love like war is over
And nobody won, yeah

(I hate you, I love you)
(I never wanna see you again)
(Baby, hang on, let me hold you)
(And we're back in the sheets again)
(Making love like war is over)
(And nobody won)
(Nobody won, nobody won)

I was drinking whiskey
You were drinking wine
Only a trash man knows the truth
Those empty bottles don't lie
