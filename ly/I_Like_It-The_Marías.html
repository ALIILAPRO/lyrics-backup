		  Physical
Spin your body round' you know the way I like
Sugar babe
Take me to the moon 'cause I'm feeling right
Call me when you're holding it down
Yeah and I'll come around
Baby if I'm holding a drink
It doesn't mean anything
Baby girl
You don't gotta see me any other night
Oh cause baby I'm
Always a step ahead of your other guys
Call me when you're holding it down
Yeah and I'll come around
Baby if I'm holding a drink
It doesn't mean anything
Keep thinking Ima be your reason to
Call me up
Baby don't hold me up
Yeah cause I like it
I like it
So baby don't hold me up
Baby don't hold me up
Sugar babe
Take me to the moon 'cause I'm feeling right
Call me when you're holding it down
Yeah and I'll come around
Baby if I'm holding a drink
It doesn't mean anything
Keep thinking Ima be your reason to
Call me up
Baby don't hold me up
Yeah cause I like it
I like it
So baby don't hold me up
Baby don't hold me up
Keep thinking Ima be your reason to
Call me up
Baby don't hold me up
Yeah cause I like it
I like it
So baby don't hold me up
Baby don't hold me up
