		  Hmm, hmm, hmm
Hmm, hmm, hmm
Hmm, hmm, hmm
Hmm, hmm, hmm
Hmm, hmm, hmm
Hmm, hmm, hmm
Hmm, hmm, hmm

Nobody ever knows 
Nobody ever sees 
I left my soul 
Back there now I'm too weak 
Most nights I pray for you to come home 
Praying to the Lord 
Praying for my soul 

Now please don't go 
Most nights I hardly sleep when I'm alone 
Now please don't go, oh no 
I think of you whenever I'm alone 
So please don't go 

Hmm, hmm, hmm
Hmm, hmm, hmm
Hmm, hmm, hmm
Hmm, hmm, hmm

'Cause I don't ever want to know 
Don't ever want to see things change 
'Cause when I'm living on my own 
I'll wanna take it back and start again 
Most nights I pray for you to come home 
Praying to the Lord 
Praying for my soul 

Now please don't go 
Most nights I hardly sleep when I'm alone 
Now please don't go, oh no 
I think of you whenever I'm alone 
So please don't go 

I send so many messages you don't reply
I gotta figure out what am I missing babe 
Singing now oh oh oh
And I need you now, I need your love oh oh oh

Now please don't go 
Most nights I hardly sleep when I'm alone 
Now please don't go, oh no 
I think of you whenever I'm alone 
So please don't 
Please don't go 

Please don't go 
Please don't go oh no
I think of you whenever I'm alone 
So please don't go
