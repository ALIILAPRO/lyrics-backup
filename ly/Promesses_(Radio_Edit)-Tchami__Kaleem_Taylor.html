		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If the rain was coming
Will you break my heart?
Break this promise?
If the rain was coming
Will you break my heart?
Break this promise

If the rain was coming
Will you break my heart?
Break this promise?
If the rain was coming
Will you break my heart?

If emptiness is in your promesses
Then there's no need to even promise me
If emptiness is in your promesses
Then there's no need to even promise me

Ooh yeah, I don't need you too now
What's the deal, aw yeah, won't you be, promise me
Ooh yeah, I don't need you too now
What's the deal, aw yeah, won't you be, promise me

If the rain was coming
Will you break my heart?
Break this promise?
If the rain was coming
Will you break my heart?

If emptiness is in your promesses
Then there's no need to even promise me
If emptiness is in your promesses
Then there's no need to even promise me

If emptiness is in your promesses
Then there's no need to even promise me
If emptiness is in your promesses
Then there's no need to even promise me
