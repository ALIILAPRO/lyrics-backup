		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Look at your world 
Isn't it beautiful to drain
How much is it worth 
When there's nothing left for you to take 
 
Oh what a privilege it is getting old 
I hope I live to be so cynical 
Why should we dare to live forever
If nobody cares to change for the better

Yeah
Yeah

Leaving a trace
Building a monolith so large
They can see it from space 
a scar that remains after you're dead and gone 

Oh what a privilege it is getting old
I hope I live to be so cynical
Why should we dare to live forever
If nobody cares to change for the better

Yeah
Yeah 
Yeah
Yeah

Do we bloom or decay
nothing golden ever stays
Do we burn out or fade
When there's nothing left to drain 

Yeah 

oh what a privilege it is getting old
