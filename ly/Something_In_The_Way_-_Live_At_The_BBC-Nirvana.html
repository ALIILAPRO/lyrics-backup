		  Won't you believe it? It's just my luck
Won't you believe it? It's just my luck
Won't you believe it? It's just my luck
Won't you believe it? It's just my luck

No recess
No recess
No recess

Won't you believe it? It's just my luck
Won't you believe it? It's just my luck
Won't you believe it? It's just my luck
Won't you believe it? It's just my luck

No recess
No recess
No recess

You're in high school again
You're in high school again
You're in high school again
You're in high school again

You're in high school again
You're in high school again
You're in high school again

No recess
No recess
No recess

No recess
No recess
No recess
No recess
