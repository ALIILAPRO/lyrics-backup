		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A wretched spawn of misery and pain
A being shaped by fear and disdain
Raised in the shattered ruins of a home
No one to turn to. no one to call his own
No hope, no light
No salvation in sight
No hope inside
The harbinger of the coming blight
Born into torment, a child of despair
Raised by the wicked, with no soul to ensnare
Tortured and beaten, with every breath
Bathed in darkness, to breed evil and death
Lost in the void of life
Bringing chaos and strife
The spawn of darkness, abandoned at birth
A life of horror, with no sense of worth
A curse upon his bloodline
Only power and fear ruled his mind
The return of the bringer of death
His eyes
A window to the night
A chasm void of light
His mind, a twisted labyrinth
His soul, a bridge to the abyss
The darkness that surrounds him
A shadow that he cannot shake
Raised in the shattered ruins of a home
No one is there. You're all alone
Shh
Lost in the void of life
Bringing chaos and strife
The spawn of darkness, abandoned at birth
A life of horror, with no sense of worth
A curse upon his bloodline
Only power and fear ruled his mind
The return of the bringer of death
His eyes
A window to the night
A chasm void of light
His mind, a twisted labyrinth
His soul, a bridge to the abyss
No hope inside
Mind void of light
You know that
I
Am
The
Sycophant of life
Chaos reigns
There's no turning back
No hope inside
Mind void of light
You know that
I
Am
The
Sycophant of life
