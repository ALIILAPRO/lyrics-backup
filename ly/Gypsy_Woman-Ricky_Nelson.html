		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey gypsy woman (hey hey hey gypsy woman) 
Look in your crystal ball and tell me where my baby's gone 
(Hey gypsy woman hey gypsy woman) 
Hey gypsy woman (hey hey hey gypsy woman) 
Look in your crystal ball and tell me if my baby's comin' home 
(Hey gypsy woman hey gypsy woman) 
She left one night like the wind she was gone 
I don't know why but I know that I'm alone 
If it was me that made her leave I want to know 
Just lead the way gypsy woman and I'll go 
Hey gypsy woman (hey hey hey gypsy woman) 
Look in your crystal ball and tell me what my future will be 
(Hey gypsy woman hey gypsy woman) 
Hey gypsy woman (hey hey hey gypsy woman) 
Look in your crystal ball and tell me if you see her with me 
(Hey gypsy woman hey gypsy woman) 
[ guitar ]
She left one night like the wind she was gone 
I don't know why but I know that I'm alone 
If it was me that made her leave I want to know 
Just lead the way gypsy woman and I'll go 
Hey hey hey gypsy woman (hey hey hey gypsy woman) 
Look in your crystal ball and tell me what my future will be 
Hey hey hey gypsy woman (hey hey hey gypsy woman) 
Look in your crystal ball and tell me if you see her with me 
(Hey gypsy woman hey gypsy woman)
