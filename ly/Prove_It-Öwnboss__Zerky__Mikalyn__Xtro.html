		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  People think they know you but they really don't
Not like I do
cnd you think they'd care but they just wanna show
If only they knew

I may be too good for you but I just stay
I just stay
Put me through these games and now I won't play

You say you love me
You say you love me
You say you love me
You say you love me
You say you love me
You say you love me
You say you love me
You say you love me

Prove it to me
Me eh eh eh e

You think you're so great but you're not
I'll leave if you keep messing up
You keep messing up

cnd I don't know why I put up with you
Why I put up with all the shit you do

It's just something about you
It's just something about you

I may be too good for you but I just stay
I just stay
Put me through these games and now I won't play
You say you love me

Eh eh eh
Prove it to me
Prove it to me

Me eh eh eh eh
Prove it to me
