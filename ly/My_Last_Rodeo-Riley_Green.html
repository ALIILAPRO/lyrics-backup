		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  He was running on fumes
Laid up in that hospital room
Never seen him look so old
He don't know how to quit
No, he'd keep giviner hell right 'til the very end
'Cause that's the only way he knows
I could feel the truth in his old calloused hands
When he took his last breath, looked at me and said

This ain't my last rodeo
No, it's just time for this old man to get this show on the road
When life throws you off your saddle
Don't think you lost the battle
Just climb back up and turn another row
The good Lord might want to call this cowboy home
But this ain't my last rodeo

He said a man is
Only as good as the woman that he's got standin' beside him
So I thank the good Lord every day 'cause mine is
Somewhere up there and waiting on me to ride in
Boy, that'll be the day
And I'm so close, I can smell her perfume
And I can't wait to watch her light up the room

So this ain't my last rodeo
No, it's just time for this old man to get this show on the road
When life throws you off your saddle
It don't mean you lost the battle
Just climb back up and turn another row
The good Lord might want to call this cowboy home
But this ain't my last rodeo

I know my time's coming soon
So all I'm asking you to do
Is bury me in my boots

'Cause this ain't my last rodeo
No, it's just time for this old man to get this show on the road
When life throws you off your saddle
It don't mean you lost the battle
So don't shed a tear for me now when I go
The good Lord might want to call this cowboy home
This ain't my last rodeo

This ain't my last rodeo
This ain't my last rodeo
