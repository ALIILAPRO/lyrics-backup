		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Alone deep in the dark
I hide all my sorrows from you
I tried to cover this pain
That flows through my veins all this time

I'm slowly decaying
My head is fading
I feel like I'm bleeding
I'm down and forsaken

I bear all this hate
My heart is begging to fade
But I stayed kept looking and found that
Nobody stands by my side

I'm slowly decaying
My head is fading
I feel like I'm bleeding
I'm down and forsaken

The pressure I kept inside
I'm totally drowning I cannot take this anymore
These tension hate and anger
Vanquish my life all alone

I'll break all of your rules
I have to be free from your chains
But I'm lost nowhere to go
No one to blame but my own

I'm slowly decaying
My head is fading
I feel like I'm bleeding
I'm down and forsaken

The pressure I kept inside
I'm totally drowning I cannot take this anymore
These tension hate and anger
Vanquish my life all alone

Nothing has changed
Everything remains the same
I'm left here and bounded
By this hatred forever

The pressure I kept inside
I'm totally drowning I cannot take this anymore
These tension hate and anger
Vanquish my life all alone

It's late I know its the end
But I'm back from where I begun
