		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The promise cast, the hopeful lured
Stabbing by the pointed words
Tortures of the damned you'll find
Guilt preys upon the human mind

All you know and all you feel
Is all there is and all that's real
Innocent told you're a worthless pain
Eventually drives all insane

Bleak optimism gained
A lame excuse to hide the pain
Instinct stifled be ashamed
For what you feel is right and sane

Suffering, told what you feel and need is wrong
When conflicting with the machine
The machine that's run so long

Suffer the masses, contradicting views inside
Suffer the masses, the personality divides
Suffer the masses, what's told and what you know
Suffer the masses, now, now the neuroses grows

Generations handed down
The false smile to hide your frown
Instinct stifled don't be afraid
For what you feel is right and sane

The promise cast, the hopeful lured
Stabbed by the pointed words
Tortures of the stabbed you'll find
As guilt devours your broken mind
