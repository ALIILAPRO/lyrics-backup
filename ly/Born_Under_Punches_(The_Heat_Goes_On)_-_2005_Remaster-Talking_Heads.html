		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take a look at these hands.
Take a look at these hands.
The hand speaks. The hand of a government man.
Well I'm a tumbler. Born under punches.
I'm so thin.

All I want is to breathe. I'm too thin.
Won't you breath with me?
Find a little space, so we move in-between. In-between it.
And keep one step ahead, of yourself.

Don't you miss it, don't you miss it.
Some 'a you people just about missed it! Last time to make plans!
Well I'm a tumbler...
I'm a Government Man.

Never seen anything like that before.
Falling bodies tumble 'cross the floor. Well I'm a tumbler!
When you get to where you wanna be. Thank you! Thank you!
When you get to where you wanna be. Don't even mention it!

Take a look at these hands. They're passing in-between us.
Take a look at these hands.
Take a look at these hands. You don't have to mention it.
No thanks. I'm a Government Man.

And the heat goes on...And the heat goes on...And the heat goes on...
And the heat goes on...Where the hand has been...And the heat goes on...And the heat goes on...And the heat goes on...
And the heat goes on...And the heat goes on...And the heat goes on...And the heat goes on...
...Where the hand has been...And the heat goes on...And the heat goes on...

I'm not a drowning man!
And I'm not a burning building! (I'm a tumbler!)
Drowning cannot hurt a man!
Fire cannot hurt a man. (Not the Government Man.)

All I want is to breathe. Thank you. Thank you.
Won't you breath with me?
Find a little space...So we move in-between. I'm so thin.
And keep one step ahead of yourself. I'm catching up with myself.

All I want is to breathe.
Won't you breath with me. Hands of a Government Man.
Find a little space so we move in-between.
And keep one step ahead of yourself. Don't you miss it! Don't you miss it!

And the heat goes on...And the heat goes on...And the heat goes on...And the heat goes on...Where the hand has been...And the heat goes on...And the heat goes on...And the heat goes on...And the heat goes on...
Where the hand has been...And the heat goes on...And the heat goes on...And the heat goes on...
And the heat goes on...
