		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wanna see you before this night ends
Want you to love me, we'll play pretend
Because lately I'm addicted to your love
I need your love
'Cause tonight
You never know we just might die
I can't get you out my mind
And I've been waiting my whole life
Baby, I know everything has been so crazy
I've fallen addicted to your love
Imma kiss your body, every spot
Girl, we can't waste no time, not even one minute
You have more than my mind, you have my heart in it
I'll give you all I've got if you just come get it
I don't need kisses through the phone, I need to feel your lips
I wanna see you before this night ends
Want you to love me, we'll play pretend
Because lately I'm addicted to your love
I need your love
I cannot pretend, this might be the end
But when I touch your skin, that's when the night begins
Please don't tell your friends, keep it me and you
Been through this before, must be deja vu
And when I hold you close I will not let go
Lost inside your mind, lost inside your soul
Numb from all the love might be cuz I'm young
You say that you need me
Come show me you need me
And I keep so much love for you
That I've gone blind to any mistakes
When we fuck I swear you take away my pain
'Cause tonight
You never know we just might die
I can't get you out my mind
And I've been waiting my whole life
I'll eat that pussy from the back and make you squirt uh-huh
Way I work that body out you'd think you hurt uh-huh
Say you love Rihanna, baby, make it work uh-huh
Kiss your mouth after your pussy like dessert ah ah
Baby, I'm so freaky
And this is all about tonight
I need your body heat
I wanna fit between your thighs
I want you stuck on me
Want you to suck on me, fuck on me, feel on me
Don't become a memory
I wanna see you before the night ends
Want you to love me don't play pretend
You're not a girl I'm just messing with
I take you serious for selfishness
You never know we just might die
I can't get that out my mind
I can't get that out my
Let's take no chances
If this is out last night, let's just vibe, let's just live it
And I want you, you want me, but I'll admit it
You being all at home, all alone, that's not living
But that's not my business
Who am I kidding
Because I don't know if you mean all the things
That you say, that you did to me last night
Occasionally fight don't know what's wrong or right
So much on my mind
I wanna see you before this night ends
Want you to love me we'll play pretend
Because lately I'm addicted to your love
I need your love
