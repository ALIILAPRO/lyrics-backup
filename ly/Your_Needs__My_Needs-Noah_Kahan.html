		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh well, who was I?
Who was I to watch you wilt?
You ain't gotta tell me what it means
Trace the outlines of your dreams
You'll always be a flower on my skin
And the pain that I am in
It's all the same
The losing touch, the waiting game
You cross that county line
I promise to be there this time, alright?

You were a work of art
That's the hardest part

Howling like dogs in the light of the moon
Holding our breath after 1:32
You asked me why I wasn't sayin' a word
I'm namin' the stars in the sky after you

It was a work of art
That's the hardest part

To spiral out, to try and float
To see a friend, to see a ghost
Bitter-brained, always drunk
Rail-thin, Zoloft
Subtle change, shorter days
Dead-eyed, dead weight
Your life, your dreams
Your mind, your needs
My needs
Your needs, my needs

To spiral out, to try and float
To see a friend, to see a ghost
To see a ghost, to see a ghost
To see a ghost
