		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Have you ever felt it could all go away 
If you blink
If you never stop running you won't fall behind
So you think
And you wonder in your heart
If you're still not who you are
Who are you?
Nothing's as it seems till it all falls apart

If you have a dream, go chase it
If you feel hope, don't waste it
If you find love, embrace it
And never take a single breath for granted
The story's yours, go write it
Tomorrow's undecided
Our days are counted on this planet
Never take a single breath
Take a single breath for granted

Maybe it's time you bet on yourself
Listen to your heart
Just listen to your heart and nobody else
So go find out who you are
Only you know who you are
Who are you?
'Cause all you have to lose 
Is your best life yet
So go ahead

If you have a dream, go chase it
If you feel hope, don't waste it
If you find love, embrace it
And never take a single breath for granted
The story's yours, go write it
Tomorrow's undecided
Our days are counted on this planet
Never take a single breath
Take a single breath for granted

Sometimes the greatest moment we'll ever know
Are when we're letting go, so let go
And maybe our brightest days still wait for us
In the unknown

If you have a dream, go chase it
If you feel hope, don't waste it
If you find love, embrace it
And never take a single breath for granted
If you have a light, go find it
The story's yours, go write it
Our days are counted on this planet
So never take a single breath 
Take a single breath for granted
