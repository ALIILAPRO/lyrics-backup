		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh God, please don't take my child
He's not ready to die
Oh God, he's going to take him from us!
I hear him comin'! I hear him coming!
No, coming!
(Mmm. Him. Him. Him. Him.)
Oh God, please don't take my child
(What's this?)
He's not ready to die
Oh God, he's gonna take him from us!

Still right here shorty, told you I got you
Like the way I scooped you when them faggot niggas shot you
I'ma hold you down and I mean that for real
But everytime you beef with a nigga, I end up having to kill
It ain't like that and hey forget about them two kids
'Bout to get a deal and I'm just as nice as you is
Oh you think
Nah, I'm just playing whassup got some new bitches, I know you tryna get fucked
Not really
What, I ain't your man no more
Just because a nigga, don't need a hand no more
You know how we do, if one goes soft
We all take the pussy and go up in her raw
It's like now, where you going, I ain't tryin' to take it
Fucking with a nigga like you, I won't make it
It'll be what it is
Yo, you in for the night
I'm 'bout to take it to the crib
You get home, aight?

The snakes (snake), the rats (rat)
The cat and the dog
How you gonna live
When you're in the fog
The snakes (snake), the rats (rat)
The cat and the dog
How you gonna live
When you're in the fog

Yo, I ain't fucking with this nigga no more, word to my mother
Fuck it, so you know I'm for sure, word to my brother
It's like he's gotten worse than before, son of "I wonder"
What type of dirt this nigga got in store for me to get under?
Then I get the call
Yo, X
Police just killed your cousin, underneath the projects
Don't get vexed, niggas'll pay, 'member I got you
Told you I got you
Dawg, I got you
I'm in a catch twenty-two, but them niggas got to pay
But I know he gon' be asking for a favor one day
But fuck it, I ain't got no choice in the matter
Them faggots killed my peoples, and I wanna see 'em splatter
That's what I'm talking 'bout, we ain't on no kid shit
And I'ma use the same gun that you killed them two kids with
Is that hard to live with? Nah
See, you still a playa
But what you want from me?
Ahh, I'll tell you later

The snake (snake), the rats (rat)
The cat and the dog
How you gonna live
When you're in the fog
The snakes (snake), the rats (rat)
The cat and the dog
How you gonna live
When you're in the fog

Shit is all over the news, bomb goes off in Central
What the fuck have I gotten myself into?
The mental, is like, get the fuck outta there
I'm out
Hey, going somewhere?
Nah
What the bag for
Fuck it, what you want?
Can your nigga come inside, for a minute and puff a blunt?
Here we go again
After what I just gave you
Wasn't acting like that, when you asked for that favor
Yo, I ain't ask you for shit!
Oh yes you did
When you really needed something then you allowed me to give
You sold me your soul when you didn't say no
Just let a nigga go, and gimme what you owe
Fuck was you thinking? Ain't shit for free
Ain't a motherfucker you know, can defeat me
Forgive me Father, for I have sinned
And with your help, I know the Devil won't win

Kill kill kill, kill kill kill
Take you all on our way to hell
Kill kill kill, kill kill kill
We're gon', do do it, do it well
Kill kill kill, kill kill kill
Take you all on our way to hell
Kill kill kill, kill kill kill
We don't want to do it and we do it well

This is Marilyn Manson, DMX, Ruff Ryders
This is Marilyn Manson, DMX, Ruff Ryders, Swizz Beatz
DMX Ruff Ryders Swizz Beatz Ruff Ryders Swizz Beatz
