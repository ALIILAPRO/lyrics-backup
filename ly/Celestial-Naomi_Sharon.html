		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can tell your thoughts are 'bout me
I can tell you're talking to see
We should make some time to dive in

I feel it for you, feel it for you
I feel it for you, feel it for you
Down under, I still adore you, still adore you
Come around to me, come around for me

I know what a man is, a million dollars
I know what a man is, a million dollars
I know what a man is, a million dollars
Ooh-ooh-oh

I feel it for you, feel it for you
I feel it for you, feel it for you
Down under, I still adore you, still adore you
Come around to me, come around for me

Time over potential
I'll be your reflection
You need to align and dive in
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh

I feel it for you, feel it for you
I feel it for you, feel it for you
Down under, I still adore you still adore you
Come around to me, come around for me

Mm-mm-hmm, mm-mm-hmm
Mm-mm-hmm
