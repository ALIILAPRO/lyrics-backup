		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When the night is closing 
Eyes are running wild 
Then I hear you humming 
All night long 

The sign I see it 
Tell me am I true 
All I need from you is 
All I see 

This city's paved with cold 
Playboys buying fun 
Seems there is no hunter left 
Without his hunting gun 

Can you feel the light 
The air is wild open 
Oh you see the light it's coming through 
It's there in the distance 
Always offered to me 
Always coming over a hill 

Oh your see-saw smile 
Lasts me all night long 
Like a siren's curl 
When the night is long 

Now come hold my hand 
No bad vibe hearts 
Hold my hand you know 
This journey could be long 

Yeah the seasons come in 
All the nights are woven 
All the nights we'll see them through 
Ah, no hundred men now 
Would dare cut into us 
We'll go on and see it through 

When the night has come in 
Your eyes are running wild 
Then I hear you humming 
All night long 

Yeah the sign I see it 
Yeah the times I see it 
All I need to know from you 
Is all I see 

Can you feel the light 
The air is wild, open 
Oh you see the light, 
It's coming through 
It's there in the distance 
Always offered to me 
Always coming over a hill 
Yeah the seasons come in 
All the nights are woven 
All the nights we'll see them through 
Ahh no hundred men now 
Would dare cut into us 
We'll go on and see it through [Repeat until fade]
