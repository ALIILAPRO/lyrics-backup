		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Time won't stop
For me or you
Drunk at the bar
With An attitude
I don't know where i can go
My house doesn't feel
Like it's a home to me
Time won't stop
For me or you
Drunk at the bar
With An attitude
I don't know where i can go
My house doesn't feel
Like a home to me
Right Now
Right Now
Right Now
Right Now

Time won't stop
For me or you
Drunk at the bar
With An attitude
I don't know where i can go
My house doesn't feel
Like it's a home to me
Time won't stop
For me or you
Drunk at the bar
With An attitude
I don't know where i can go
My house doesn't feel
Like a home to me
Right Now
