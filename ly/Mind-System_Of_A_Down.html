		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, baby come close to me
Let me love you
Oh, baby come close to me
Let me feel you

Look at each other, look at each other, look at each other
Look at each other, look at each other, look at each other
Look at each other, look at each other, look at each other

Go away, go away, go away, go away

Well now mutually, mentally molested children of a mother
Mutually, mentally molested children of sin
Oh no, the ever so popular beating that took you under
Oh no, the ever so popular beating that broke your skin

Free thinkers are dangerous
Blame hate for fate's seed

Go away, go away, go away, go away

Well you need the ones you love, love the ones that you need
Need the ones you love and love the ones you bleed
Lives rearranged and lives in my range, can you see?
Lives rearranged and lives in my range, can you see?

Free thinkers are dangerous
Blame hate for fate's seed

Die, die, die, die
Gonna let you mother fuckers die, gonna let you mother fuckers die
Gonna let you mother fuckers die, gonna let you mother fuckers die

Look at each other
Look at each other
Look at each other
