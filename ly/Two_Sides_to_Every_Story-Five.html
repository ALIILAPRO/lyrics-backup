		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah, c'mon

Two sides, from the heart
Well, It's alright, alright

Want to know a bout me
Well, It's it's the way it's got to be
There's more you to me than what you see
On TV Screens is make believe

Think you know about us
Well, it's an element of trust
Come tlk to me respectfully
'Cause thease days we're public property

Oh oh From the heart
Oh oh oh like us from the start

Because there's two sides to every story
Think you gotta know me
You gotta show me
But it's alright, Don't be sorry
It's just the way I am

Because there's two sides to every story
Think you gotta know me

But I'm telling you once again
You gotta go for what I am 
You gotta go for what I am 

Yeah, yeah It's alright
I'm tellin' you
There's two sides
Yeah, yeah It's alright
It's just the way I am

Do you care a bout me
Or the picture that you see
Are we just a face without personality
Yeah, yeah

Do you care about us
Or the funkin' that we bust
There's more to us than magazines and
Dance routines
And a teenage dreams

Oh oh From the heart
Oh oh oh like us from the start

Because there's two sides to every story
Think you gotta know me
You gotta show me
But I'm telling you once again
You gotta go for what I am 

But I'm telling you once again
You gotta go for what I am 

Yeah, Yeah it's alright
I'm tellin' you
There's two sides
Yeah, yeah it's alright
It's just the way I am
Because there's two sides to every story
Think you know me
You gotta show me
But it's alright, Don't be sorry
It's just the way I am

Because there's two sides to every story
Think you know me
You gotta show me
But I'm telling you once again
You gotta go for what I am
