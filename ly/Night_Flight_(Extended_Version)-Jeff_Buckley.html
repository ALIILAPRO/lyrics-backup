		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I received a message from my brother across the water
He sat laughin' as he wrote the end's in sight
So I said goodbye to all my friends
And packed my hopes inside a matchbox
'Cause I know it's time to fly

Oh yeah, come on, come on now won't meet me in the morning, 
Meet me in the middle of the night
Oh the morning light is comin', 
Don't it make you wanna go and feel alright

Uh
Oh I just jumped a train that never stops,
So now somehow I'll know I never finished payin' for my ride
Just n' someone pushed a gun into my hand
Tell me I'm the type of man to fight the fight that I'll require

Oh yeah, come on, come on now won't meet me in the morning, 
Won't you meet me in the middle of the night, night, night
Oh the morning light is comin', 
Don't it make you wanna go and feel alright

Alright, alright
Oh, mama, well I think it's time I'm leavin'
Nothin' here to make me stay
Whoa, mama, well it must be time I'm goin'
They're knockin' down them doors
They're tryin' to take me away

Please Mr. brakeman, won't you ring your bell
Won't you make it loud and clear
Please Mr. fireman, won't you ring your bell?
Tell the people they got to fly away from here

Uh, I once saw a picture of a lady with a baby
Southern lady, had a very, very special smile
We are in the middle of a change in destination
When the train stops, all together we will smile
Oh yeah, come on, come on now won't you meet me in the morning
Won't you meet me in the middle of the night, night, night
Oh, oh everybody know the mornin' time is comin'
Don't it make you wanna feel alright
Ah, ah, yeah
Make me feel alright
alright, alright
Make me feel alright
Hmm hmm yeah alright, alright
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah shit
Fuck that pissed me off
