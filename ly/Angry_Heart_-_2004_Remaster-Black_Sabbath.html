		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I still remember how it used to be
I thought the only thing
That mattered was me
You always told me it was just insane

To feel such joy
While others feel pain
There's no way to change this angry heart
'Cause when love goes

It will tear you apart
And it's been this way since time began
It's a desperate search for a promised land
And the years slip by like so much sand

So many people who are dying to live
It tortures my heart
They've got so much to give
I never saw it as a battle before

To win the fight
There has to be more
And there's no way to change this angry heart
'Cause all these fears

Will tear you apart
And it's been this way since time began
It's an endless journey, it's the fate of man
To live each day and never understand

And it's been this way since time began
It's a desperate search for a master plan
And the years slip by like water through your hands
