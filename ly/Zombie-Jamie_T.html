		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Love she sees apart from me, possessed behind the eyes
Apart from frightening, the moaning and biting, seems to be a nice guy
And I know what she thinks when she looks at me, when she looks with such despair
You're not the only one around here who needs a bit of fresh air

'Cause I'm a sad sack, post teen, could have been a love machine
No dream, concrete, walking like a zombie
Like a zombie

And I'm a coal train, fast lane, caught up in a dirty rain
No pain, no gain, working like a zombie
Like a zombie

Well this old place here, man it's falling apart
She's on the road as she goes, but she won't get far
I'm on a show to parole to the toad in a hole
I've gotta grow some roots, gotta prop up the bar

I've got bloodshot eyes and there's blood in my teeth
I've got a ripped up jacket and a friend who's a thief
Well I'm a coughing out my mouth, trying to pull it out
But the fire inside keeps burning, burning out

'Cause I'm a sad sack, post teen, could have been a love machine
No dream, concrete, walking like a zombie
Like a zombie

And I'm a coal train, fast lane, caught up in a dirty rain
No pain, no gain, working like a zombie
Like a zombie

Oh you're running the situation
Don't be afraid to be a friend
'Cause I won't hurt you girl, or leave you unsaid
You make me live enough to love again

'Cause I'm a sad sack, post teen, could have been a love machine
No dream, concrete, walking like a zombie
Like a zombie

And I'm a coal train, fast lane, caught up in a dirty rain
No pain, no gain, working like a zombie
Like a zombie

'Cause I'm a sad sack, post teen, could have been a love machine
No dream, concrete, walking like a zombie
Like a zombie

And I'm a coal train, fast lane, caught up in a dirty rain
No pain, no gain, working like a zombie
Like a zombie
