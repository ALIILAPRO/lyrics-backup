		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Call me on your way home
Don't matter the time
Or whenever you feel low
Wanna just say hi
Tell me 'bout a good day
Or even just to cry
Call me on your way home

When it's midnight
And your mind is a mess, wanna run away darling
Feels like hell 'cause no one really understands you
Know you're not alone
I'll go anywhere the wind blows
I'll walk you back 'til you say the doors closed
Call me on your way home

If something at the party
Made you think of me
If you ain't breathing hardly
From your anxieties
Doesn't matter if you're wasted
If you're sober
Yeah, you always got my shoulder
Call me on your way home

When it's midnight
And your mind is a mess, wanna run away darling
Feels like hell 'cause no one really understands
Know you're not alone
I'll go anywhere the wind blows
Yeah, I'll walk you back 'til you say the doors closed
Call me on your way home
Call me on the way home

There's a sad song on the radio
At a red light and you just don't know if it feels right
Pick up the phone and call me on the way home
If you don't know we'll you know it now
I wonder if you're safe and sound
If you need me I'll be around
Just call me on the way home

When it's midnight
And your mind is a mess, wanna run away darling
Feels like hell 'cause no one really understands
Know you're not alone
I'll go anywhere the wind blows
Yeah, I'll walk you back 'til you say the doors closed
Call me on your way home
