		  why r u so obsessed with meee
i just wanna know
why r u so obsessed with meee
i just wanna know

ur so obsessed with me but i don\'t blame u shawty
u wanna party everyday u wanna party
my heart been empty for so long and u aint fit in
but no one can decline that ur extremely pretty

ur so obsessed with me even when i do nothing
baby is it love or ur just aint tapped in
ur so obsessed when i post snippets and i drop em
ur such a nasty bitch possessed like can u stop it????

it doesn\'t happen that anything will return
i started treating em like instrument became mature
i got like hella plans those obviously should work
these bitches only ruin lives but idc and move on

ur so obsessed with me but i don\'t blame u shawty
u wanna party everyday u wanna party
my heart been empty for so long and u aint fit in
but no one can decline that ur extremely pretty

why r u so obsessed with meee
i just wanna know
why r u so obsessed with meee
i just wanna know

ur so obsessed with me even when i do nothing
baby is it love or ur just aint tapped in
ur so obsessed when i post snippets and i drop em
ur such a nasty bitch possessed like can u stop it????

ur so obsessed with me even when i do nothing
baby is it love or ur just aint tapped in
ur so obsessed when i post snippets and i drop em
ur such a nasty bitch possessed like can u stop it????
