		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And when I fall apart
And when my head it's in pieces
You pull me out the dark
Always you and me you and me
You're my dynamite
 
Hey
 
Now I've felt what the pain
From true sadness is like
I really need your embrace
I'm like a moth to a flame
And when my feelings reach you
I'm no longer confused
I'm teary eyed but with you they start to dry
 
It's only you
You're my everything
You get me though
So comfortably
You got a good heart
You're more than enough
You see through the scars
 
And when I fall apart
And when my head it's in pieces
You pull me out the dark
Always you and me you and me
You're my dynamite
 
You're my guiding star
And when my eyes lose direction
You pull me out the dark
Always you and me you and me
You're my dynamite
 
You say it's okay to fail
And I'm here when you fall
All that matters is that
You even get up at all
 
You said I know that'll fly
My blue bird in the sky
You'll hit a high
Then suddenly doubts will die
 
It's only you
You're my everything
You get me though
So comfortably
You got a good heart
You're more than enough
You see through the scars
 
And when I fall apart
And when my head it's in pieces
You pull me out the dark
Always you and me you and me
You're my dynamite
you and me you and me
You're my dynamite
you and me you and me
You're my dynamite
