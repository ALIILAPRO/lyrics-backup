		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Cold light wakes me in the morning
Your side is empty, I was calling out to you
I was calling out to you

There's broken bottles around me on the floor
There's broken bottles around me like a technicoloured hue
Like a technicoloured hue

You left your number on my bed
Saying this is all that you gotta do
But its not my fault that my phone went dead
Oh I would do it again, I'd do it again

And all of the nights and all of the days
Yeah we're watching them fading away
And oh what a life when you're rolling the dice
When I'm gambling all of the time
But I don't need your love

I just need you talking next to me when I wake up, wake up
Talking next to me when I wake up next to you
When I'm hungover too
Because you're the only one who comes when I'm lonely
You're the only one who comes when I'm lonely for you
When I'm lonely for you

All that I need is
Sweet escape
And all that I need is
Sweet escape

And all of the nights and all of the days
Yeah we're watching them fading away
And oh what a life when you're rolling the dice
When I'm gambling all of the time

And I don't need your love
Oh I just need your
Ohh oh oh oh oh
Well I'm leaving now
And oh oh oh oh oh
I'm leaving now
And oh oh oh oh oh
I'm leaving now
And oh oh oh oh oh
I'm leaving now

And all of the nights and all of the days
Yeah we're watching them fading away
And oh what a life when you're rolling the dice
When you're gambling all of the time
And all of the nights and all of the days
Yeah we're watching them fading away
And oh what a life when you're rolling the dice
When I'm gambling all of the time
Because I don't need your love
I just need you now
And I don't need your love
I just need you now
