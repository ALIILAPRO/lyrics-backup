		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been keeping things inside
Taking up space 'til I got someone
I could open my mind up to
I guess it worked pretty good 'til now
But shit's kinda getting serious
I think I'm running out of room

Everyone's got someone built custom
To give their darkness to
I wish I had someone, could trust 'em
But loyalty 
Don't come for free

'Cause all my friends are fake, fake, fake, fake
They just want me for the day, day until they don't
I stay up wondering
What if I broke my legs?
What if I changed my name?
Would you still love me the same?
Or are you just as fake?
Like all my friends are fake

Sorry if I got you wrong
Didn't mean to judge you by your cover
I've been burnt so many times
It's hard to turn it off

Everyone's got people they see through
But I see through everyone
So if you want me to believe you and need you
Might take some time to recognize

'Cause all my friends are fake, fake, fake, fake
They just want me for the day, day until they don't
I stay up wondering
What if I broke my legs?
What if I changed my name?
Would you still love me the same?
Or are you just as fake?
Like all my friends are fake

Sorry if I got you wrong
Didn't mean to judge you by your cover
I've been burnt so many times
It's hard to turn it off

All my friends are fake, fake, fake, fake
They just want me for the day, day until they don't
I stay up wondering
What if I broke my legs?
What if I changed my name?
Would you still love me the same?
Or are you just as fake?
Like all my friends are fake

Like all my friends are fake
