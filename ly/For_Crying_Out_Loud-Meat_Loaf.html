		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was lost till you were found
But I never knew how far down
I was falling before I reached the bottom
I was cold and you were fire
And I never knew how the pyre 
Could be burning 
On the edge of the ice field

And the now chilly California wind
Is blowing down our bodies again
And we're sinking deeper and deeper into the chilly California sand
Oh I know you belong inside my aching heart
And can't you see my faded Levis bursting apart
And don't you hear me crying
Oh babe, don't go
And don't you hear me screaming
How was I to know?

I'm in the middle of nowhere
Near the end of the line
But there's a border to somewhere waiting
And there's a tankful of time
Oh give me just another moment to see the light of the day
And take me to another land where I don't have to stay

And I'm gonna need somebody to make me feel like you do
And I will receive somebody with open arms, open eyes,
Open up the sky and let the planet that I love shine through

For crying out loud 
You know I love you
For crying out loud 
You know I love you
For crying out loud 
You know I love you

I was damned and you were saved
And I never knew how enslaved 
I was kneeling in the chains of my master

I could laugh but you could cry
And I never knew just how high 
I was flying
Ah, with you right above me

And the now chilly California wind
Is blowing down our bodies again
And we're sinking deeper and deeper into the chilly California sand
Oh I know you belong inside my aching heart
And can't you see my faded Levis bursting apart
And don't you hear me crying
Oh Babe, don't go
And don't you hear me screaming
How was I to know?

I'm in the middle of nowhere
Near the end of the line
But there's a border to somewhere waiting
And there's a tankful of time
Oh give me just another moment to see the light of the day
And take me to another land where I don't have to stay

And I'm gonna need somebody to make me feel like you do
And I will receive somebody with open arms, open eyes,
Open up the sky and let the planet that I love shine through

For crying out loud 
You know I love you
For crying out loud 
You know I love your
For crying out loud 
You know I love you
For crying out loud 
You know I love you

For taking in the rain when I'm feeling so dry
For giving me the answers when I'm asking you why
And my oh my 
For that I thank you

For taking in the sun when I'm feeling so cold
For giving me a child when my body is old
And don't you know 
For that I need you

For coming to my room when you know I'm alone
For finding me a highway and driving me home
And you gotta know 
For that I serve you

For pulling me away when I'm starting to fall
For revving me up when I'm starting to stall
And all in all 
For that I want you

For taking and for giving and for playing the game
For praying for my future in the days that remain
Oh Lord 
For that I hold you

Ah but most of all
For cryin' out loud
For that I love you

Ah but most of all
For cryin' out loud
For that I love you

Ah but most of all
For cryin' out loud
For that I love you

When you're crying out loud
You know I love you
