		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Treat me like your last cigarette, ah
Put me down and pick me up again, ah
You can be the dagger that I put in my own back
Make tonight the night we both regret

I'm the queen of self-sabotage
I already decided on
You remind me of myself
You're dragging me through hell, I know
I'm the blade you've been counting on
But you don't wanna cut it off
You're water and I'm fire
Why's the flame keep getting higher?

Back off, before I destroy you
Oops, I didn't mean to, only do it 'cause I have to
Use you, only to destroy me
Gonna make you love me, it'll be the death of us, so what?

Treat me like your last cigarette, ah
Put me down and pick me up again, ah
You can be the dagger that I put in my own back
Make tonight the night we both regret

Every time you leave, you leave with a piece of me
Gotta tripwire the door, make you come back for m-m-more
'Cause I can't get rid of the marks
Got your claws on my mind, on my heart
But here we are, tattooing the scar

Back off, before I destroy you
Oops, I didn't mean to, only do it 'cause I have to
Use you, only to destroy me
Gonna make you love me, it'll be the death of us, so what?

Back off, back off
Oops, I didn't mean to hurt you
Back off, back off
Oops, I didn't mean to hurt you
