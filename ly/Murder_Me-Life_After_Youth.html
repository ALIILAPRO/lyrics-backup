		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey 
Killing some time, singing a song
Hate all your friends, but we got along
Taking a walk, looking at birds
Dying inside (The back of a hearse)
 
I don't know what to think
Somebody, murder me
I don't feel anything 
Somebody, murder me
Hey
Sleeping a lot, ready to die
She wants me gone, I'm already trying
Telling the truth, losing my mind
She wants my best, but its so hard to find
I don't know what to think
Somebody, murder me
I don't feel anything 
Somebody, murder me
Always on my own
Always all alone
(Always alone)
I don't know what to think
Somebody, murder me
I don't feel anything 
Somebody, murder me
