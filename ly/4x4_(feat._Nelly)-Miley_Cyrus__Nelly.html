		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Round and round and away we go
Round and round and away we go
Four by four and away we go
High not low and away we go
Round and round and away we go
And away we go and away we go
Four by four and away we go
High not low and away we go

I'm a female rebel, can't you tell?
Banged on the dashboard, just chipped a nail
Lean out the window, it's when I go
Driving so fast 'bout to piss on myself
Driving so fast 'bout to piss on myself
The police wanna get him and put him in jail
I'm a do whatever to get him his bail
Hooked on donuts and rooster tails
I'm in that passenger seat flying high in the air
And we're driving fast 'till we're plum out of gas

Round and round and away we go
Round and round and away we go
Four by four and away we go
High not low and away we go
Round and round and away we go
And away we go and away we go
Four by four and away we go
High not low and away we go

I'm a female rebel, can't you see?
Riding 'round your backyard to the beat
Pulling out the steering wheel right from the seat
Pumping his brakes to the sound of the beat
Pumping his brakes to the sound of the beat
You don't understand what he's doing to me
Deep down inside like a pit bull in heat
He's almost coming so we head for the streets
I'm in that passenger seat flying high in the air
And we're driving fast 'till we're plum out of gas

Round and round and away we go
Round and round and away we go
Four by four and away we go
High not low and away we go
Round and round and away we go
And away we go and away we go
Four by four and away we go
High not low and away we go

It's twelve o'clock and I don't want to party
My pit bull friend and my big truck hobby
A little bit of dirt never hurt nobody
Now I got dirt all over my body
Might as well, light a ale
His big fog lights is bright as hell
Calls 'em off, starts to yell
He hits the gas so I grab the rail

Are you sure you wanna ride with me?
If you scared don't lie to me
I'm a crazy mother fucka from the mid west
With a Mississippi flow and all in dress
And a four by four with the alter steps
Doing donuts underneath the old chest
I need a chick on time 'cause mine be early
Think I ride or I die down to six thirty
Straight up chick like twelve o'clock
I don't know where yet, that's what she tell the cops
Sits down for a nigga, raise her hand for a nigga
I solemnly swear he was with me all day
To the judge, he the one I love
Hell they can't tell, she don't even budge
Round and round we go
Don't stop 'till I tell you so

I'm in that passenger seat flying high in the air
And we're driving fast 'till we're plum out of gas

Round and round and away we go
Round and round and away we go
Four by four and away we go
High not low and away we go
Round and round and away we go
And away we go and away we go
Four by four and away we go
High not low and away we go

I'm a female rebel, can't you tell
Can't you tell, can't you tell
I'm a female rebel, can't you tell
Can't you tell, can't you tell
