		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't talk to my man like that
I like it when you like it
My, my, my, my man
My, my, my, my man
Don't talk to my man like that
I like it when you like it
My, my, my, my man
My, my, my, my man

You know which one you want
I don't care which one you want
You can take whatever
I don't care what you do
I will always, watchin' for you
This is the only one you want
You will watch yourself after
If you get them dirty, I don't know

Don't talk to my man like that
I like it when you like it
My, my, my, my man
My, my, my, my man
Don't talk to my man like that
I like it when you like it
My, my, my, my man
My, my, my, my man

I was waiting for this moment to arrive
I was driving in the car and I mash my car
I was playing on my iPad and I broke my iPad
I am going to my house, see my dad
I am saying hi to my dad and I have to go change
I'm playing basketball
This is how much I want to, bare court
Ten thousand days and I know
Ten thousand weekends and you know
Ten thousand hours and you know
Ten thousand everything and you know
And you know how much (ha-how)

Don't talk to my man like that
I like it when you like it
My, my, my, my man
My, my, my, my man
Don't talk to my man like that
I like it when you like it
My, my, my, my man
My, my, my, my man

This is the one you want, ayy
This is the one you want, ayy
You got the one percent for it
You can go ask for it, other person
I don't got it, I don't get it
I don't fake it, I don't lick it
You don't want to eat a lollipop
I don't know who sells ice pops
I don't know who sells lollipops
I don't know who sells lollipops
Go ask to a cloud, I don't know
Go ask to a cloud, I don't know
You can go ask somebody else
I do not have the skills for it
I just have the skills for the basketball game
Or the soccer game, or the tennis game, or the golf game

Don't talk to my man like that
I like it when you like it
My, my, my, my man
My, my, my, my man
Don't talk to my man like that
I like it when you like it
My, my, my, my man
My, my, my, my man
