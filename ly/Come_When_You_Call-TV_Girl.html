		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The sound of mass confusion
Reverberated down the hall
Into the ears of a stoic roommate
Who put her headphones on

But in the space between the songs
(That's where she paid the most attention)
Beneath the crack on the door
(The candle flickered and got extinguished)

The reassuring hum of the freeway
As she drifted off to sleep
And it was five o'clock in the morning
You had no good reason to leave

Ooh baby I'll come when you call
(I'll come when you call)
I'll come when you call
(I'll come when you call)
I'll come when you call
(I'll come when you call)
I'll come but that's all
(I'll come when you call)

Linda Ronstadt on the stereo
She was singing Warren Zevon
Hold me tighter Carmelita
Make the night not last so long
And if it seems so peaceful now
(Why don't you wait until the morning light?)
And catch the eye of the stoic roommate
(As you leave without saying goodbye)

And if you're ever let to wonder
Why anything goes right
Thank the god of bad decisions
The queen of lonely nights

Ooh baby I'll come when you call
(I'll come when you call)
I'll come when you call
(I'll come when you call)
I'll come when you call
(I'll come when you call)
I'll come but that's all
(I'll come when you call)
