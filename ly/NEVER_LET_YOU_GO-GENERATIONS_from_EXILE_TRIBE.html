		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Never let you go
Never let you go
What you waiting for?
From this moment I'm yours
Hurry baby open up the door
Today is a special day
for you and I
Come on let's celebrate
Oh I'll never say never
Stay just the way you are
I swear I'll love you forever
Our bittersweet memories
shine like melodies
Do you hear
the perfect harmony?
Look into your eyes, your heart
I see you've been through
hard times
But it's a brand-new life
Let's fly away
from here together
I'll never...
Never let you go
Never let you go
I'll hold your hand now
Are you ready
for the new world?
Wanna make you smile, wanna
wipe your tears away my love
You're the one,
you are my everything
I can do whatever (you desire)
Baby I I I can be stronger
now oh baby
Never let you go
Never let you go
When two become one
We will share one heart
It's gonna be alright
From this moment you're mine
Hurry baby open up your mind
Tonight is a special night
for you and I
Come on let's celebrate
When the sky is falling down
And the world is tumbling down
I swear you will be safe
and sound
Close your eyes 1,2,3
Just let it be
Feel the magic,
feel it in the air
Look into my eyes
Believe in me
I'll be true to you
Don't you say good bye
Let's reach out to the stars
together
I'll never...
Never let you go
Never let you go
Over the rainbow
Are you ready
for the new world?
Tell me what you want,
baby let me
make your dreams come true
You're the one,
you are my everything
I can do whatever (you desire)
Baby I I I can go higher
now oh baby
Never let you go
Never let you go
When two become one
We will share one heart
For the first time in my life
I see the light
For the first time I know why
I'm standing here
It's crazy oh baby
just feel my love inside
I'll never...
Never let you go
Never let you go
I'll hold your hand now
Are you ready
for the new world?
Wanna make you smile,
wanna wipe your tears
away my love
Don't you feel it?
Never let you go
Never let you go
Over the rainbow
Are you ready
for the new world?
Tell me what you want,
baby let me
make your dreams come true
You're the one,
you are my everything
I can do whatever (you desire)
Baby I I I can be stronger
now oh baby
Never let you go
Never let you go
You will never be alone
We'll be together forever
Never let you go
Never let you go
When two become one
We will share one heart ...
