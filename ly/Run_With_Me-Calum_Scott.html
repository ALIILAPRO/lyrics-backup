		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you pray and it just don't work
I'll be, I will be your church
I'll answer and answer all that I can

If you're down and it can't get worse
Give me all the pain and hurt
Promise you'll put your hand in my hand

And run with me, run with me, run
Jump with me, jump with me, jump
The world ain't got nothing on us
So run with me, run with me, run

And run with me, run with me, run
And jump with me, jump with me, jump
The world ain't got nothing on us
So run with me, run with me, run

We'll build, we will build a home
And we'll watch all the flowers grow
Until our bones, until our bones can't hold

Ooh yeah and
And take my heart if yours don't beat
And take my lungs if yours can't breathe
And if you need, you can take my body

And run with me, run with me, run
And jump with me, jump with me, jump
The world ain't got nothing on us
So run with me, run with me, run

And run with me, run 
(Run with me, run with me, run with me)
(Run with me, run with me, run with me)
(Run with me, run with me)

Wait
Oh, I'll wait
For a lifetime by your side
And I'll stay
Won't you stay
Until the world is ours

And run with me, run with me, run
Jump with me, jump with me, jump
The world ain't got nothing on us
So run with me, run with me
Run with me, run
