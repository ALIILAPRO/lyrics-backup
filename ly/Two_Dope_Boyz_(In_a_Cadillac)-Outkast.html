		  (Greetings, earthlings)

From the bottom of my lungs a nigga be blowin', spittin' his game
Comin' up on ya from the South, the A-T-Liens ain't changed
Cooler than most players claim to be
A nigga that's from the A-Town see
The home of the Bankhead Bounce, Campbellton Road and other city streets
Enough of the verality, fallacy, butter we speak not fiction
Speakin' of pullin' yo' girl lookin' at Jheri curls you bitches
Every time I rhyme for y'all, I'm lookin' to prove a point
Kickin' a freestyle every now and then
But mostly after joint
See I smoke good cause see it go good wit them flows, why
The nigga the B-I-G like Tony Rich nobody knows why
But me and my folks, cause y'all niggas jokes like the joker
I'm sick of these wack ass rappers like I'm tired of hoes in chokers

Who them boys that be havin' the crunk every occasion
This side niggas dustin', that side niggas lacin'
But in the middle we stay calm, we just drop bombs
Askin' where we come from, South Post slums

It's just two dope boys in a Cadillac
It's just two dope boys in a Cadillac

This ol' sucka MC stepped up to me
Challenged Andre to a battle and I stood there patiently
As he spit and stumbled over clich√©s, so called freestylin'
Whole purpose just to make me feel low, I guess you wilin'
I say, "Look boi, I ain't for that fuck shit, so fuck this"
Let me explain on this child style so you don't miss
I grew up to myself not 'round no park bench
Just a nigga bustin' flows off in apartments

Now who them boys that be havin' the crunk every occasion
This side niggas dustin', that side niggas lacin'
But in the middle we stay calm, we just drop bombs
Askin' where we come from, South Post slums

It's just two dope boys in a Cadillac
It's just two dope boys in a Cadillac

It goes chromes to the Fleetwoods, coupes to the 'Villes
Hittin Girbauds and off these flows we havin' the player chill
In this atmosphere this ain't no practice here we cuttin' the fool now
I'm doin' ya at the house and throwin' you out because I'm through now
Don't you love the way we claimin' Bankhead, stankhead
Lookin' around the SWATS for the herb that's never tainted
Fainted when you heard the bourbon servin' on the block
And all you bitin' individuals need to check yourself and stop

Yeah tight like nuts and bolts, sluts and hoes that get evicted
I'm dealin' with Queens in my castle ain't worth it to risk it
Now tricks be lookin' at me like I'm they way up out the pro-jects
Can't put you on my payroll, and no I ain't got no Rolex
Or no diamond at the exit with a sign sayin' "We'll rap for food"
My face is bawled up 'cause I ain't in a happy mood
While my partner got the squeegee and the Windex
'Cause somewhere in my life I done went wrong just like a syntax
Error, bring the terror to your dome like P.E.
Prone to finish this out because this be a free-style (ow, oh)

Now who them boys that be havin' the crunk every occasion
This side niggas dustin', that side niggas lacin'
But in the middle we stay calm
We just drop
