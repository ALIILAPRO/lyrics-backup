		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby baby I swear to you
Baby baby I'm here for you

I don't know why
Why I did those things to you
What went through my mind
And I don't know why
Why I broke your heart in two
Guess that I was blind

Baby how I wish you could forgive me
One more time

And I swear
I'll be there
Anytime you want me to
I'll be true
Here to you
Don't leave me lonely
'Cause I need you

I've been a fool
Now I can see the price to pay
I can't run and hide
'Cause I'm losing you
And my chances slipped away
With each time I lied

Baby how I wish you could forgive me
One more time

And I swear
I'll be there
Anytime you want me to
I'll be true
Here to you
Don't leave me lonely
'Cause I need you

Baby living without you
Will tear me apart
When I know how it could have been
But I don't care what it leads to
Let&acute;s make a new start
And give love a chance to win cause
Baby I swear

And I swear
I'll be there
Anytime you want me to
I'll be true
Here to you
Don't leave me lonely
'Cause I need you

Baby baby I swear to you
Anytime you want me too
Baby baby here for you
