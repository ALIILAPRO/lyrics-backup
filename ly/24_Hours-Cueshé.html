		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been lying here and wide awake
Till the night dies out and day to break
Every minute seems like endless hours
When I'm with you 

I miss your eyes, your smile and lovely face
I can't forget your sweet embrace
We both could share our endless dreams
If you were here 

CHORUS:
Doesn't matter if I'm alone
I got a place I call my own
I don't care if you're away
Cause I know you'll be back someday, someday 

I guess it's better if we were off that way
We'll find ourselves and come with me
If I could have one wish then I will beg
For you to stay 

CHORUS 

I've been lying here and wide awake
The sun has come for the moon to take
I never thought that we could end like this
Wish you were here 

CHORUS
