		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  With your hands on your ears
I see you reading
And it doesn’t even matter that
Everyone can see you
In you there is no masquerade
Just purity and realness
From head to toe discrepancy
Unlike anyone here

In you there is a fire
Your warmth shines onto me
I bet you find bestsellers and
Crimes exactly as unreadable
In you I see a lighting
And if it struck me I wouldn’t mind
You're beautiful because you wear your
Dismay in your smile

In you there is no imitation
Just a delicate strong mind
And with an attitude like that
I believe you can survive
In you there is a rose, to harm anyone
You're too shy but your intentions of revolt
Are bursting inside
In you there is a darksome cloud
With a very friendly vibe
A gloomy look is simply the
Most soothing in our time

With your hands on your ears
I see you reading
And it doesn’t even matter
That everyone can see you
In your face I see happiness
With a shimmer of decline
I bet your bookshelf looks similar to mine
