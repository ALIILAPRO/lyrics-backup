		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know you want it, come and get it, I'ma give it to ya
I know you want it, come and get it, I'ma give it to ya
I know you want it, come and get it
I'ma give it to ya
I know you want it, come and get it, I'ma give it to ya
I know you want it, come and get it, I'ma give it to ya
I know you want it, come and get it
I'ma give it to ya

Yeah, I took a little break for trafficking freight, yeah yeah
3 Litre CSL on a late plate
In Bape, got Bowie banging in the tape
Big brick Nokia and man playing Snake
I see that yellow bone, she got mad yellow cake
Says she's available today for a date
Missed call tennis
Now I'm getting jealous, maybe I was overzealous
See, I tend to oversell it
But when I first saw her, it was end credits
Got the text, dipped on the fellas
Straight to her premises, it's always the premise
Satisfaction guaranteed, that's a promise
She's not one for chat, I'm just being honest
And maybe I want more than just right now
Laying that pipe down, neighbours saying pipe down
I turn up and turn the lights down
Money on the nightstand, making all the right sounds
Use a glove when we're getting off
Costs too much to take it off
I love her too much to pay in duds

I know you want it, come and get it, I'ma give it to ya
I know you want it, come and get it, I'ma give it to ya
I know you want it, come and get it
I'ma give it to ya
I know you want it, come and get it, I'ma give it to ya
I know you want it, come and get it, I'ma give it to ya
I know you want it, come and get it
I'ma give it to ya

Yeah, uh, uh, uh, I'm dead serious
I'm ready now, I wanna get serious
I'm looking for the girlfriend experience
I'm looking for a girl with experience
She don't watch my appearance
I'm paying for the pleasure of this here appearance
I think I might let her meet the parents
To be fair, I could do without their interference
You're near, you're in the area
'Cause yeah you met my search criteria
I call her at work for a word with her
Must be abroad 'cause my phone bill's murder, love
You wanna be my Valentine's?
Dirty spa weekend at Bannatyne's
Submariner, maritime
Married at the Marriott in summertime
Said I'm the only one she bangs now
Stopped escorting, she's only doing cams now
We're making all these plans
'Til I posed as a punter and caught her with her pants down
Heartbroken, I'm at wit's end
She's never accepted by my friends
It's cool 'cause I never liked them

I know you want it, come and get it, I'ma give it to ya
I know you want it, come and get it, I'ma give it to ya
I know you want it, come and get it
I'ma give it to ya
I know you want it, come and get it, I'ma give it to ya
I know you want it, come and get it, I'ma give it to ya
I know you want it, come and get it
I'ma give it to ya
