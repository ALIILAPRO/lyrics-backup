		<p>
		  In the dark times
Will there still be singing?
Yes, there will be singing
About the dark times

I don't wanna be dark
But I don't know where else to
I don't wanna be dark
But I don't know where else to
I don't wanna be dark
But I don't know where else to
I don't wanna be dark
But I don't know where else to start
When there's no light

In the dark times
Will there still be laughing?
Yes, there will be laughing
About the dark times

I don't wanna be dark
But I don't know where else to
I don't wanna be dark
But I don't know where else to
I don't wanna be dark
But I don't know where else to
I don't wanna be dark
But I don't know where else to start when there's no light

Right outside your search lays inner peace
There's light behind the sky, you fail to see, so bleak
Tell me where to start
Tell me where to start

In the dark times
Will there still be singing?
Yes, there will be singing
About the dark times

I don't wanna be dark
But I don't know where else to
I don't wanna be dark
But I don't know where else to
I don't wanna be dark
But I don't know where else to
I don't wanna be dark
But I don't know where else to start
When there's no light
I don't know where else to start when there's no light
I don't know where else to start when there's no light
I don't know where else to start when there's no light
