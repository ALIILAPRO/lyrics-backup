		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You came in to my life like a hurricane
Blowing all the grief away like a storm

You were bad but you were good
You never did the things you should
And you were wrong but you were right
You said we only get one life

And I said you were much, too much
You drove me crazy
Much, too much
Too much for me and now I regret it

'Cause you're gone, gone, gone
Like the summer goes at the end of September
Gone, gone, gone
Like the snowfall at the end of spring
Now you're out of my life 'cause I did you wrong
It's something that you'll always remember
And now you're gone, gone, gone
Forever and more
Forever and more

You were always last to leave the party
And you were always first to say, "I'm in"

You were good and you were bad
You thrilled me but you drove me mad
Yeah, you were right and I was wrong
And I never felt something so strong

And I said you were much, too much
You drove me crazy
Much, too much
Too much for me and now I regret it

'Cause you're gone, gone, gone
Like the summer goes at the end of September
Gone, gone, gone
Like the snowfall at the end of spring
Now you're out of my life 'cause I did you wrong
It's something that you'll always remember
And now you're gone, gone, gone
Forever and more

Came into my life like a hurricane 
(Like a hurricane)
Turned my world upside down
And I'll never be the same

Now you're out of my life 'cause I did you wrong
It's something that you'll always remember
And now you're gone, gone, gone
Forever and more
Gone, gone, gone
Like the summer goes at the end of September
Gone, gone, gone
Like the snowfall at the end of spring
Now you're out of my life 'cause I did you wrong
It's something that you'll always remember
And now you're gone, gone, gone
Forever and more
Forever and more
Forever and more
Forever and more
