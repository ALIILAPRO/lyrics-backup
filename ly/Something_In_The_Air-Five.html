		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Reminisce girl on the way that it was
Everything that I had was yours
Give me kiss girl like you used to do
I'm gonna take my time with you
Make it feel like what you felt before
Now you're back 'cause you want some more
I can't help but feel the way I do
And girl I got this to say to you

They're runnin' around my mind got thoughts of you and me all the time
Well baby you've got to let me know what I gotta do
'Cause if you'd only tell me
Maybe you could help me
Try to understand how to get with you

All the boys on the right give it up this time
All the girls on the left give it up this time
'Cause all the boys on the right want to check you out
And all the girls on the left want to show you how

Now it's on girl, got the best of you
Now I want to take the rest of you
I don't want to take it slow with you
I want to rock with you I want to roll
If you want girl we can take a ride
I'll be fine with you by my side
I can't help but feel the way I do
So I've got this to say to you

They're runnin' around my mind got thoughts of you and me all the time
Well baby you've got to let me know what I gotta do
'Cause if you'd only tell me
Maybe you could help me
Try to understand how to get with you

All the boys on the right give it up this time
All the girls on the left give it up this time
'Cause all the boys on the right want to check you out
And all the girls on the left want to show you how

Give me kisses, lay it on, rock it to the break of dawn
I can do it nice and soft and give you everything you want
'Cause what you need's what I got don't forget it
Baby I'm a-waiting right here come and get it
Kissin' necks, I'll perplex, any way you want to flex
We should get together just to check out if our love connects
Tell me now are you feelin' how I'm feelin'
I got a freaky feelin' deep inside this could be real and check it out

'Cause if you'd only tell me
Maybe you could help me
Try to understand how to get with you

All the boys on the right give it up this time
All the girls on the left give it up this time
'Cause all the boys on the right want to check you out
And all the girls on the left want to show you how

All the boys on the right give it up this time
All the girls on the left give it up this time
'Cause all the boys on the right want to check you out
And all the girls on the left want to show you how

There's something in the air to end
