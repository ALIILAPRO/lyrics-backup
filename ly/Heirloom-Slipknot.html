		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When the beating hearts make the beating start
It means they've found you out
Nothing hurts you more until you can't ignore
It's something to cry about
Now before you know it, the scars begin to show it
No place where you feel safe
So much for getting better
It's just a matter of when to run away

A moment never lasts that long
A moment never lasts so long right now
No matter how the past has gone
You'll always have the past along for a lifetime now
But you can't run to ground
Oh, you can't run to ground

When the hurting stops and the voices drop
It means the guilt kicks in
They say they didn't mean it
They say they're gonna fix it
When they yell it means they care (are you getting it?)
Staring daggers, pressing kisses, hiding bruises
When exactly does this feel like love?
Now the question begs, when you're the one who hates
What in the hell are you passing on?

A moment never lasts that long
A moment never lasts so long right now
No matter how the past has gone
You'll always have the past along to last a lifetime now

But you can't run to ground
Oh, you can't run to ground
A moment never lasts that long
A moment never lasts so long right now
No matter how the past has gone
You'll always have to pass a lifetime now
A moment never lasts that long
A moment never lasts so long right now
No matter how the past has gone
You'll always have the past along to last a lifetime now
