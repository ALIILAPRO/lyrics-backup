		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Rise up in the unity
The time has come overthrowing the impossible
Embrace the eternity
Praise and cheer every moment of this miracle
Carry on till we hit the bottom
Even god could never take our freedom
Now sing to the melody
The strength inside shall make us unbeatable

We are the victors
We are the ones who rule the night
We are believers
We are the future and the light

Stand up in the unity
幾度となくうちひしがれようとも
ここにいる証
すべからく時代に刻もう
同じ旗のもとで
鬨の声を響かせて
Now sing to the melody
未来を抱く者達の讃歌を

We are the victors (we are the victors)
We are the ones who rule the night (we are the ones who rule the night)
We are believers (we are believers)
We are the future and the light (we are the future and the light)
 
Stand up in the unity
幾度となくうちひしがれようとも
不可能を可能に
覆す力と誓いを
同じ旗をかかげ
鬨の声を響かせて
Now sing to the melody
世界を掴む者達の讃歌を

We are the victors (we are the victors)
We are the ones who rule the night (we are the ones who rule the night)
We are believers (we are believers)
We are the future and the light (we are the future and the light)
We are the victors (the ones who rule the night)
We are the ones who rule the night (the future and the light)
We are believers (we are the victors)
We are the future and the light (the future and the light)
We are the victors
We are the future and the light
