		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Look at you, in denim and bows
I know the mode, the mode is lethal
Say you wanna show me your place
The place is here, the here is inside you
Where did you come from, you?

Pretty, critical mass
Your body has the body power
Layin' at the foot of a linden
In the navel ring, inventing June
Where did you come from, you?

And what I want is, to walk beside you
Needing nothing, but the sun that's in our eyes
Paint the picture in blood and butter
Holy water, fire in sky

Let me dive through your face
To the sweetest kind of pain
Call you up, nothin' to say
No, I don't need no one entertaining
When the world is a bed
Give me green and ribbon red
Oh, get closer than your new tattoo

Look at you all mythicalogical and wikipediated
Look how I forget who I was
Before I was the way I am with you
Where did you come from, you?

And what I want is, to walk beside you
Needing nothing, but the sun that's in our eyes
Paint the picture in blood and butter
Holy water, fire in sky

Let me dive through your face
To the sweetest kind of pain
Call you up, nothin' to say
No, I don't need no one entertaining
When the world is a bed
Give me green and ribbon red
Oh, get closer than your new tattoo

Closer than your

Ra, ra, ra, ra, ra, ra, ra, ra, ra, ra, ra, ra
Ra, ra, ra, ra, ra, ra, ra, ra, ra, ra, ra, ra
Ra, ra, ra, ra, ra, ra, ra, ra, ra, ra, ra, ra
Ra, ra, ra, ra, ra, ra, ra, ra, ra, ra, ra, ra
Ra, ra, ra, ra, ra, ra, ra, ra, ra, ra, ra, ra
Ra, ra, ra, ra, ra, ra, ra, ra, ra, ra, ra, ra
Ra, ra, ra, ra, ra, ra, ra, ra, ra, ra, ra, ra
Ra, ra, ra, ra, ra, ra, ra, ra, ra, ra, ra, ra
