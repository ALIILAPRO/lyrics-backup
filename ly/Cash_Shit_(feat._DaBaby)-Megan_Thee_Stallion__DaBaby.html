		  Real hot girl shit
Yeah, I'm in my bag, but I'm in his too
And that's why every time you see me, I got some new shoes
Ah, muah, ay, look
(Lil Ju made this beat)

Bitch, I'm a star, got these niggas wishin'
He say he hungry, this pussy the kitchen
Yeah, that's my dawg, he gon' sit down and listen
Call him a trick and he don't get off', hold up
Bitch, I'm a star, got these niggas wishin'
He say he hungry, this pussy the kitchen
Yeah, that's my dawg, he gon' sit down and listen
Call him a trick and he don't get offended
He know he giving his money to Megan
He know it's very expensive to date me
Told him go put my name on that account
Because when I need money, I ain't tryna, hold up
He know he giving his money to Megan
He know it's very expensive to date me
Told him go put my name on that account
Because when I need money, I ain't tryna wait

I can't be fucked with, no
Ho you can't touch this, ay
Bitch, I do rich shit, huh
My money thick thick, ay
Walk with a limp, limp, huh
I'm on some pimp shit, ay
He say, "You all about money," yeah
I'm on that cash shit, huh
I'm in my bag, bitch, huh
I'm on your ass, bitch, huh
I'm in that new new shit
You on that last year, huh
Bitch, I do pimp shit, huh
Ho, you on simp shit, ay
He say, "You all about money," yeah
I'm on that cash shit, ah

You know why these bitches love me? (why?)
'Cause Baby don't give a fuck (what you do?)
I be fixin' the weave while she suckin' my dick
Pull it out, then I titty fuck (uh, uh)
I fuck her from the back and she nasty, killin' her
Know how I give it up (yeah, yeah)
I be cool on 'em, bitch, ain't no pressure (uh-uh)
'Til I met this lil' freak, her name Megan (ooh)
This lil' thing here a stallion, look how she walk
Look how she talk, she sexy (muah)
I like when they pretty and ghetto (uh-huh)
Type of bitch that don't even say hello (yeah, yeah)
And whenever we fuck, she be fuckin' me back
Put her in the headlock with my elbow (mmh)
Now she done reversed it
Got up on the dick and ride the shit like a Camaro, uh

I can't be fucked with, no
Ho you can't touch this, ay
Bitch, I do rich shit, huh
My money thick thick, ay
Walk with a limp, limp, huh
I'm on some pimp shit, ay
He say, "You all about money," yeah
I'm on that cash shit, huh
I'm in my bag, bitch, huh
I'm on your ass, bitch, huh
I'm in that new new shit
You on that last year, huh
Bitch, I do pimp shit, huh
Ho, you on simp shit, ay
He say, "You all about money," yeah
I'm on that cash shit, ah (hey, hey, look)

I don't be stressin' 'bout none of these niggas
When they be talkin', I don't even listen
Tellin' me secrets, I probably forget it
But I'ma tune in when he say he gon' lick it
He told 'em send me a pic 'cause he miss me
I told him send me a stack if he really
I don't be trusting these tricks 'cause they tricky
Send him a pic of somebody else titties
I'm a finesser and I'm a fly dresser
Move to the top floor and flew in my dresser
My bitches hustle, make money together
Your bitches birds and they flockin' together
I can't decide if I want the new Louis
Dapper Dan yellow, I'm always in Gucci
Your mama don't bring your dad to the mall
'Cause when he be in there she know he be choosin'

I can't be fucked with, no
Ho you can't touch this, ay
Bitch, I do rich shit, huh
My money thick thick, ay
Walk with a limp, limp, huh
I'm on some pimp shit, ay
He say, "You all about money," yeah
I'm on that cash shit, huh
I'm in my bag, bitch, huh
I'm on your ass, bitch, huh
I'm in that new new shit
You on that last year, huh
Bitch, I do pimp shit, huh
Ho, you on simp shit, ay
He say, "You all about money," yeah
I'm on that cash shit, ah
