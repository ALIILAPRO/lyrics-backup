		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It has come to our attention that a mysterious force is loose
Somewhere in outer space
"The mysteries of creation are there
"Up in the sky?"
"Up in the sky"
The moon and the planets are there
And new hopes for knowledge and peace are there
And therefore as we set sail, we ask God's blessing
On the most hazardous, and dangerous, and greatest adventure
Of which man has ever embarked
Prepared for liftoff

I-Self-Lord-And-Master shall bring disaster to evil factors
Demonic chapters, shall be captured by Kings
Through the storms of days after
Unto the Earth from the Sun through triple darkness to blast ya
With a force that can't be compared
To any firepower, for it's mindpower shared
The brainwave causes vessels to circulate
Like constellations reflect at night off the lake
Word to the Father and Mother Earth
Seeking everlasting life through this Hell for what it's worth
Look, listen and observe
And watch another C-Cipher pullin' my peeps to the curb
Heed the words, it's like ghetto-style proverbs
The righteous pay a sacrifice to get what they deserve
Cannot afford to be confined to a cell
Brainwaves swell, turnin' a desert to a well
Experience the best teacher, thoughts will spray
Like street sweepers Little Daddy street preacher
Illustrious feature, narrator you select
Accompanied by Deck plus the DJ you respect
The seven-and-a-half combine, over the front line
The ten percenters, promotin' slander in the airtime
Bear in mind jewels be the tools of the trade
Sharp blade, heavenly praise and dues are paid

Above the crowds, above the clouds where the sounds are original
Infinite skills create miracles
Warrior spiritual, above the clouds
Raining down, holdin' it down

Yeah, I leave scientists mentally scarred, triple extra large
Wild like rock stars who smash guitars
Poison bars from the Gods bust holes in your mirage
And catch a charge, shake 'em down like the riot squad
And they deserve ruin like ancient Rome, I span the universe
And return to Earth to claim my throne
The maker, owner, plus soul controller
Ayatollah rest in the sky, the cloud's my sofa
Stand like Colossus, regardless to whom or what
Numerous attempts at my life, so who to trust?
Who but us to supply you with the fire?
The burning truth, 150 Absolut proof
On the mic like Moses spoke in golden scribe
Survivor of the oldest tribe whose soldiers died
I notified families, we shed tears and more
But our hands on the ammo 'cause the battle's still on
Sound the horn, we come rumblin' through the function
Precise laser beam technique to touch somethin'
When we die hard, the'll build the monument to honor us with
Humongous effect in the world, we could have conquered it

Above the crowds, above the clouds where the sounds are original
Infinite skills create miracles
Warrior spiritual, above the clouds
Raining down, holdin' it down
Above the crowds, above the clouds where the sounds are original
Infinite skills create miracles
Warrior spiritual, above the clouds
Raining down, holdin' it down
