		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's so many times that I
That I have lost my mind
Whoever wonders that I
Can't test but I, can't lie
I've tried savin' my face but
Not sure that's what I wanted
No I, oh, I
I thought I did before

"This life ain't what you asked," as I thought out loud
I travelled far for this, do you wonder why I still drown?
And I hold my breath, and I take a chance, you're too used to this now
When there's no air left, well, who's pullin' me up? Mm

I could tell that I'm missed, I'm surely down
But that will never stop me
I have always had this crown
But they can only taste it, now
I could tell in the midst, I'm surely down
But that will never stop me
I have always had this crown
But they can only taste it, now

What you say? This ain't right, this went left
Come back home, I ain't got time for this
Who you love, who you blame, who asked for this?
When did you make up your kind that I had time for this?
Been too long, two months, but now I called you up
Yeah, you were there, but you know nothing about me
How'd you learn if you don't hear the words I said?
Maybe you could feel it through my pain instead

I could tell that I'm missed, I'm surely down
But that will never stop me
I have always had this crown
But they can only taste it, now
I could tell in the midst, I'm surely down
But that will never stop me
I have always had this crown
But they can only taste it, now
