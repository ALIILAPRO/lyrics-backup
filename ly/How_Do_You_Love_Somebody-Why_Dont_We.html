		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Every day, every night, I can only think of us
On the coast, in July, when you thought you said too much
Guess it don't always go like the stories we've been told
'Cause you're gone and you're fine, I'm laying here fucked up

Oh, I wonder
Did emotions fade with the summer
Like an ocean wave, took me under
And you left without a sound

Baby, baby, tell me how
How do you love somebody?
How do you love somebody else?
'Cause when you left I lost myself
Baby, baby, tell me how
How do you love somebody?
How do you numb the pain so well?
'Cause when you left I lost myself
How do you love somebody else?

Seven missed calls, you're really keeping your distance
I know that I tried, and givin' you what you're missin'
Stab my back, no chance to heal at all, oh, whoa

Ooh, I wonder
Did emotions fade with the summer (summer)
Like an ocean wave, took me under
And you left without a sound

Baby, baby, tell me how
How do you love somebody?
How do you love somebody else?
'Cause when you left I lost myself
Baby, baby, tell me how
How do you love somebody?
How do you numb the pain so well?
'Cause when you left I lost myself
How do you love somebody else?

I just don't get it, how you left so quick
Just fifteen minutes, now you textin' him
I just don't get how you left so quick
You broke my heart and I'm a mess again
I just don't get it, how you left so quick
Just fifteen minutes, now you textin' him
You broke my heart and I'm a mess again

How do you love somebody?
How do you love somebody else?
'Cause when you left I lost myself
Baby, baby, tell me how
How do you love somebody?
How do you numb the pain so well?
'Cause when you left I lost myself
How do you love somebody else? (Yeah)

Always go like the stories we've been told
'Cause you're gone and you're fine, I'm laying here fucked up
