		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  He's dressed like, is dressed like a baller
We switching every kind of pose up
Highways and country lands we roll up
He give it to me anyway that I want it, babe
Anyway that I want it
Drunk or sober, he never let me down when he go lower
Then baby always hold me when it's over (he give it to me)
He give it to me, anyway that I want it, babe
Anyway that I want it

When he moves in, I cave in, want him to dive in my ocean
Take off our labels on the coffee table
Two A.M. and we've just begun

The way that he touch me, no, I can't get enough
He keeping me up all night long
He motivate me, yeah, that's my baby
He really hit me with my body talk
He got me singing ooh la, la, la, la, la, la, ey
I'm catching feelings
Ooh a, la, la, la, la, la, ey
He got me singing ooh la, la, la, la, la, la, ey
He motivate me, yeah, that's my baby (that's my baby, huh)

Don't matter, no, don't matter where we go
He get it, gon' get it, get it when he get home
One look at my body, hooked and away we go
He get it, gon' get it, get it tonight

When he moves in, I cave in, want him to dive in my ocean
We take off our labels on the coffee table
Two A.M. and we've just begun

The way that he touch me, no, I can't get enough
He keeping me up all night long
He motivate me, yeah, that's my baby
He really hit me with my body talk
The way that he touch me, no, I can't get enough
He keeping me up all night long
He motivate me, yeah, that's my baby
He really hit me with my body talk
He got me singing ooh la, la, la, la, la, la, ey
I'm catching feelings
Ooh la, la, la, la, la, la, ey
He got me singing ooh, la, la, la, la, la, la, ey
He motivate me, yeah, that's my baby (that's my baby, huh)

He motivate me, motivate me
The only guy that gets to date me (oh that's my baby, yo)
He motivate me, motivate me (yeah, that's my baby)
When he's with me bitches hate me (he motivate me)

The way that he touch me, no, I can't get enough
He keeping me up all night long
He motivate me, yeah, that's my baby
He really hit me with my body talk
He got me singing ooh la, la, la, la, la, la, ey
I'm catching feelings
Ooh la, la, la, la, la, la, ey
He got me singing ooh, la, la, la, la, la, la, ey
He motivate me, yeah, that's my baby (that's my baby, huh)

He motivate me, motivate me
The only guy that gets to date me (oh that's my baby, yo)
He motivate me, motivate me (yeah, that's my baby)
When he's with me bitches hate me (that's my baby, yo)
He motivate me, motivate me (oh la la la)
The only guy that gets to date me
He motivate me, motivate me
Yeah, when he's with me bitches hate me
