Hello, do you need your fuckin' face touched?
With a metal fist, I'll leave you picked up
Blood on the machete, make the blade rust
Infection in the cut, it's leakin' out pus
I'm a big dog, you a fucking cat, dawg
You gonna need an army just to have your back, dawg
And this .556 will stop them in their tracks, dawg
You won't even have the time to react, dawg

Fist into the face, ice pack to the eye
Do you wanna die? Do you want your mom to cry?
Kicks into the head, bash into the brains
And I'ma keep swinging 'til you do not look the same
Now let's play stupid games and win stupid prizes
Now let's play with this gun and try not to fire it
Now let's play stupid games and win stupid prizes
Now let's play with these drugs and fight with our vices (ewok, ewok)

Bentley truck, stick shift, it be shootin' by (vroom, vyoom, vroom)
Bitch, do you really wanna play do or die? (No-no, no-no)
Princess cuts got my fucking wrist slit, it's a suicide (splash, splash, splash)
All I fucking rock is Rick drip (ewok, ewok)
Ain't no suit and tie, bitch, I'm super fly (no-no, no-no, no-no)
I be shooting guys, big MAC, bitch, it's supersize
Bitch, I'm super high, selling two for five (ewok, ewok)
You either shoot or die

Fist into the face, ice pack to the eye
Do you wanna die? Do you want your mom to cry?
Kicks into the head, bash into the brains
And I'ma keep swinging 'til you do not look the same
Now let's play stupid games and win stupid prizes
Now let's play with this gun and try not to fire it
Now let's play stupid games and win stupid prizes
Now let's play with these drugs and fight with our vices

(Good times)
And fight with our vices
