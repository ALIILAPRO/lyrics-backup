		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fell back into my open mind 
Convinced you won't be hard to find 
I've been expecting you to call
Cause I'd find you in any world 

Set out no doubt cause every time 
When all is lost I see the signs 
And you'll be waiting after all 
Cause I'd find you in any world 

And they said to just sit still
Apparently I'm just a girl 

Who cares for fancy people 
Who can't even fall in love 
I'd rather travel round 
To find in this gold fish bowl 

Who cares about the system 
And everything they stole 
Cause I'll find you 
In this paper mache world 

Turned round to see where you had gone 
You called to say you won't be long 
But ever second passes by 
I must've cried a million times
