		  Verse

In the heat of it all
I wasn't ready to fall
oh, this aint like me.

I wanna know

In the rush of the lights
Pull me into the night
I will go blindly. 

Ohh, 


Chorus 

I wanna know now
what it feels like to love you, 
what it feels like to love you.

I wanna know, wanna know, wanna know now
What it feels like to lose you 
what it feels like to lose you, oh now



Verse 2

I've been watching you move
and everything that you do
ooh darling, where you been?

I can picture your hands
and the way that they dance
all over my skin.


Chorus

I wanna know now
what it feels like to love you, 
what it feels like to love you.

I wanna know, wanna know, wanna know now
What it feels like to lose you 
what it feels like to lose you, oh now



Last Chorus

In the heat of it all
I wasn't ready to fall
oh, this aint like me.

I wanna know

In the rush of the lights
Pull me into the night
I will go blindly. 


I wanna know.
