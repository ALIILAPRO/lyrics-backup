		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh my friends, I've begun to worry, right
Where I should be grateful
I should be satisfied
Oh my heart, I would clap and dance in place
With my friends
I have so much pleasure to embrace

But my heart is returned to sister winter
But my heart is as cold as ice

Oh my thoughts, I return to summertime
When I kissed your ankle
I kissed you through the night
All my gifts, I gave everything to you
Your strange imagination
You threw it all away

Now my heart is returned to sister winter
Now my heart is as cold as ice

All my friends
I've returned to sister winter
All my friends, I apologize, apologize
All my friends
I've returned to sister winter
All my friends, I apologize, apologize
All my friends
I've returned to sister winter
All my friends, I apologize, apologize

La la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la

La la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la

And my friends, I've
Returned to wish you all the best
And my friends, I've
Returned to wish you all the best
And my friends, I've
Returned to wish you all the best
And my friends, I've
Returned to wish you a happy Christmas
To wish you a happy Christmas
To wish you a happy Christmas
To wish you a happy Christmas
To wish you a happy Christmas
