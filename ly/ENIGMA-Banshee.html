		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Should have plucked out both the eyes
So he could never view me
Wash away my crimes with his lifeless body
At the mercy of the sea
Woke up can't believe I'm real
I've believed so many lies
Then all the fog around me cleared
I am my own fantasy
I am whole
I am found
I am god
Enigma
I am whole
I am god
Enigma
Enigma
Should have plucked out both the eyes
Watch my pupils widen
Birth of venus
Force of nature
All the things you couldn't hide
Fairy flowers every hour of the day
An offering
Every breath takes me back home
Kneel before myself and pray
I am whole
I am found
I am god
Enigma
I am whole
I am god
Enigma
Enigma
I won't hide in my shadow anymore
I tried
Then my words got stuck inside my throat
And I choked and almost died for you
What a waste of time
I won't hide in my shadow anymore
I tried
Then my words got stuck inside my throat
And I choked and almost died for you
What a waste of time
