		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The winds of darness blow again
ridden by the mares of night
they beckon me in dreams and visions
from far beyond creations light
they sing to me
wrathful beasts of satans fire
they urge me further on my path
now soaked in froth and dark desire
at the threshold of the inverted womb
I stand

Surrounded by darkness

Amidst it's blackened clearness 
there is naught to veil my sight
I can behold as they ascend
the malformes horrors of the night
and feel the crosses turn
each sense grow dim as if one with the dead
and as I fall on my knees to the ground
I am fed with the fumes of shallow graves

Into the starless night
I follow the stench
urged on by a thirst
that can not be quenched
into the starless night
I must go
the urge is so strong
it's all that I know
satan's hunger satan's hunger

The luring lament of a witch
the psalmes of angels fallen
the chanting of the undead
they echo in the wind
sanity and senses with the darkness now aligned
like tentacles and angelwings in foulest love entwined
and the graves begins to open

The brightest light will always cast the darkest shadows
shadows in which the truth lies concealed
for deep in the tunnels beyond
the dream of this world
the mysteries truely reveal

Into the starless night
I follow the stench
urged on by a thirst
that can not be quenched
into the starless night
I follow the call
urged on by a lust
that eliminates all
satan's hunger. satan's hunger!
