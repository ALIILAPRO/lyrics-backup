		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (On one, two, three)

Step up, jump in, sink or swim
Can't breathe kinda feeling
Head first, both feet
Leap, way deep, dive in

Want to love, the two of us
On three, jump

(One, two, three)

The two of us, on three
I count's on you, you count on me
Let's plan not to land
And get lost somewhere in between
The earth and sky, we'll just fly
The two of us, on three (jump)

Standing on the edge, scared to death
Never felt this emotion (ah-ah, ah-ah)
Letting go, holding you (ah-ah)
Weightless, floating, flying frozen (ah-ah, ah-ah)
(Ah-ah)

Oh, it's falling in love, the two of us
On three, jump

(One, two three)

The two of us, on three
I count's on you, you count on me
Let's plan not to land
And get lost somewhere in between
The earth and sky, we'll just fly
The two of us, on three (jump)

There's a glow on my skin
Sweat in your hair
Heat in the wind
Love in the air

Jump (on three)
(One, two three)

The two of us, on three
I count's on you, you count on me
Let's plan not to land
And get lost somewhere in between
The earth and sky, we'll just fly
The two of us, on three (jump)

The two of us, on three
I count's on you, you count on me
Let's plan not to land
And get lost somewhere in between
The earth and sky, we'll just fly
The two of us, on three (jump)

Ooh, sorry
Jump
