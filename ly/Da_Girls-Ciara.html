		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is for the girls
This is for the girls

This is for the girls getting money
This is for the girls that don't need no man
This is for the girls that's in love with theyself
This for all the girls that done did it by theyself
This for all the girls that's I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T
This for all the girls that be living stress free
This for all the girls on a mission like me
This for the girls
This for all the girls around the world
This is for the girls
This for all the girls around the world, yeah

Get that money sis (sis)
Keep them on they tip (on you)
They be trying to press you
But you ain't pressed on it (on you)

I'm way too fine to be inside, I'm outside
Having my own shit, booking my own trips
Don't ever let him disrespect you and call you out your name
You'll have these boys obsessed
They can't stop mentioning your name (boy, stop)
I'm bad, I'm gorgeous, I'm very important
How you calling me a snack?
You know I'm seven courses

This is for the girls getting money
This is for the girls that don't need no man
This is for the girls that's in love with theyself
This for all the girls that done did it by theyself
This for all the girls that's I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T
This for all the girls that be living stress free
This for all the girls on a mission like me
This for the girls
This for all the girls around the world
This is for the girls
This for all the girls around the world, yeah

I'm bad and paid
I move like the niggas move
I got foreign chains too
It ain't really nothing that I can't do
I speak for the baddies
Bank account look like phone numbers
All of our cheques got four commas
Running this thing for more summers
Designer my clothes, the cover of Vogue
I wanted some flowers
Mister Wilson pulled up in the Rolls (skrrt)
Pulled off in a ghost
When I post up my pic they say, "Goals"
Money long, weave too
Girls love girls, of course we do

This is for the girls getting money
This is for the girls that don't need no man
This is for the girls that's in love with theyself
This for all the girls that done did it by theyself
This for all the girls that's I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T
This for all the girls that be living stress free
This for all the girls on a mission like me
This for the girls
This for all the girls around the world
This is for the girls
This for the girls
This for all the girls around the world
It's strictly for the girls

This is for the girls getting money (ayy)
This for the girls that don't need no man
This for the girls that's in love with they self
This for all the girls that done did it by they self
This for all the girls that's I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T
This for all the girls that be living stress free
This for all the girls on a mission like me
This for the girls
This for all the girls around the world
This is for the girls
This for all the girls around the world, yeah

This is for my girls
This is for my girls
This is for my girls
