		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've trampled on that road 
That you think you own 
You have that smart ass attitude 
It's time to stop the fiction 

I live it every day 
While you're mind's far away 
I'm out here putting pride on the line 
And you case on me with pure respect 
One chance at one thing 
Hard time is coming 
My time, your pain 
I reign on you 

You, you think you own 
I take away 
Take it with me 
You think you own 
I took away 
Made it my own 

Most regular people would say 
It's hard and any streetwise son of a bitch knows 
Don't fuck with this

Most regular people would say 
It's hard and any streetwise son of a bitch knows 
Don't fuck with this 

There's so many times 
You practice in your mirror 
To be just like me 
But you just can't see 
You ain't got the balls, son 

I fight for love of brother 
Your friends fight one another 
You can't see because your head's up your ass 
And just in cast you think you're bad 
I crush your rush 
I rule you fool 
I'm immovable stone in your world of weak, I speak 

You, you think you own 
I take away 
Take it with me 
You, you think you own 
I took away 
Made it my own 

Most regular people would say 
It's hard and any streetwise son of a bitch knows 
Don't fuck with this

Most regular people would say 
It's hard and any streetwise son of a bitch knows 
Don't fuck with this

Most regular people would say 
It's hard and any streetwise son of a bitch knows 
Don't fuck with this

Most regular people would say 
It's hard and any streetwise son of a bitch knows 
Don't fuck with this
Don't fuck with this
