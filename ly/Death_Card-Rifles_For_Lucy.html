		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Rise under someone else's spiral
Heads headed straight for trial
Wipe the spit off of my face she said
Death augurs no disgrace
But I'm wired for escape
Could you tell me where this line
Finally ends, finally ends
I stick my tongue in your direction
Another slut for dumb affection
How do I escape this boredom
Hey anxiety drop the phone
Now there's no one here to guide me
Spare the pity while I die alone
Fall, like marble princes lost
To a history filled with naught
But the ghosts of blood and flesh you fed to
Gods of voracious greed and lust
To ensure the milk you sucked
Would spare you this
Embarrassing, common end
Buck naked at the end of a rainbow
Muddy toes and a broken halo
I wrote you letters but you don't remember
Tombstone, name unknown
Care to meet me in December
For these lips and a pot of gold
Last gasp for a moment
Before we can blink it's through
