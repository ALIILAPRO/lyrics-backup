		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been lookin' for somebody to love
Somebody to love
Hot nights dancin' 'til there's sweat drippin' off
There's sweat drippin' off

I see you lookin' over
I see you come my way
Before I can let you closer
You gotta make me stay

So if you want me like ooh-na-na
You better show me that you're the one
Caress my body like ooh-la-la
Come on and show me how you samba
So if you want me like ooh-na-na
You better show me that you're the one
Caress my body like ooh-la-la
Come on and show me how you samba (woo)

Yeah
I heard baddies don't blush for bruddas that's cheap
Keepin' it hush, the money on me
There ain't no judgment, gimme instructions
I wanna touch it, rub it and squeeze
Fly to the sun like Icarus (ah)
Twerk it, shake it, jiggle it (ah)
Ask this Spice what she really, really on right now
'Cause I really wanna zig-a-zig, ah
Doin' the mad ting
You and all of your bad friends
Native tongue and your accent
Come in the section with me

So if you want me like ooh-na-na
You better show me that you're the one
Caress my body like ooh-la-la
Come on and show me how you samba (let's go)
So if you want me like ooh-na-na
You better show me that you're the one
Caress my body like ooh-la-la
Come on and show me how you samba

Come on and show me how you samba
