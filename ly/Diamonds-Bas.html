		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Nothin' you could do about it, I'ma stay free
Either way you go about it, I'ma stay me
Livin' out my dreams don't be tryna wake me up
You ain't go for yours, niggas divin' waist deep
Every damn day, dog, my diamonds HD
That's for everyday that I had to think cheap
Now we on the road and the commas go for eons
You ain't go for yours, niggas divin' waist deep 
But-

I'ma take leaps, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'ma take leaps, yeah, yeah
I'ma take leaps, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'ma take leaps, yeah, yeah

Shorty tryna give me mine
But I needed more space (I need room)
I was sittin' courtside (shit clear)
I seen her there both days (who you know here?)
Bitch, who the fuck you know here? (You not low)
I never fold or fall for your ways or reasons
I'm so resolves in my ways
I chart a course with thoughts, got no flares or beacons
I hope you saw it my way
Wonder where the day goes?
I been outta line, if love is all you need then
Let me spend my pain
Young nigga make it rain on
Hunnid on the wrist just to make it rain on
Look at all the whips spick and they span
And you feel like you the man
But you cannot rub the stain off
No, you cannot rub the stain off

Nothin' you could do about it, I'ma stay free
Either way you go about it, I'ma stay me
Livin' out my dreams don't be tryna wake me up
You ain't go for yours, niggas divin' waist deep
Every damn day, dog, my diamonds HD
That's for everyday that I had to think cheap
Now we on the road and the commas go for eons
You ain't go for yours, niggas divin' waist deep 
But-

I'ma take leaps, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'ma take leaps, yeah, yeah
I'ma take leaps, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'ma take leaps, yeah, yeah
