		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey Mrs. Dramaqueen
What a nice movie scene
Pack up your bags
Piss off and don't call me back

Don't call me back

Oh my good she keeps talking and talking
"Don't drink too much" nanananana

Fuck you Dramaqueen

You have more shoes than a brain can have cells
You fucked my fridge up
With your diet coke, hell
Warm beer at a campfire sucks

End or beginning
It's always the same thing
Cracks in your head
Instead a place in your bed

Sometimes forever
It's always the same thing
You're too precious
To be mislead

Hey Mrs. Dramaqueen
What a nice movie scene
Pack up your bags
Piss off and don't call me back

Hey Mrs. Dramaqueen
What a nice movie scene
Pack up your bags
Piss off and don't call me back

I hate indie rock
No more romantics
I want sex and blood
Almost orgasmic
It's time for Rock 'n' Roll

This is not
This is not
What I'm longing for
This is not
This is not
What I'm longing for

Light my loincloth, Mowgli runs free
Light my loincloth, Mowgli runs free

This is not what I'm longing for

End or beginning
It's always the same thing
Cracks in your head
Instead a place in your bed

Sometimes forever
It's always the same thing
You're too precious
To be mislead

Hey Mrs. Dramaqueen
What a nice movie scene
Pack up your bags
Piss off and don't call me back

Hey Mrs. Dramaqueen
What a nice movie scene
Pack up your bags
Piss off and don't call me back

Wooohooo, I fuck you Dramaqueen
Nice and slowly
Nice and slowly
How you like that?
