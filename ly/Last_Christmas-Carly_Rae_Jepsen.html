		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I gave you my heart
Merry Christmas

Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance but you still catch my eye
Tell me baby, do you recognize me?
It's been a year, you know it doesn't surprise me
Merry Christmas, I wrapped it up and sent it
Merry Christmas, I love you and I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now
I know you'd fool me again

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (special)
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (special)

(Special)
(Special)
(Special)

A crowded room, friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God, I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A man undercover but you tore me apart
(Merry Christmas)
(Merry Christmas)
Now I've found a real love, you'll never fool me again

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (special)
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (special)

(Special)
(Special)
(Special)
(Special)
