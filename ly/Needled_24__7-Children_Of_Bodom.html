		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Since day one I've been crass and far beyond
I couldn't laugh, I couldn't cry
Before you judge me, take a look at yourself
Condescending, outliving in a lie

Despite all the pain in my heart grinding through
It ain't due that you hate what I hate what you do

Despite all the piety you've been consuming thus far
A backstabbing motherfucker to the bone is what you are

And every day when the knife in my back starts to twinge and turn
My eyes are catching fire and my heart starts to burn
One foot away from you is like a bit closer to heaven
Then again it's like being needled twenty-four seven

You look down to me to see the scum of the earth to be
Fuck yeah, that's me, vile and obscene
I ain't happy about it but at least I don't judge and decree
To be better than another human being

Every day when the knife in my back starts to twinge and turn
My eyes are catching fire and my heart starts to burn
One foot away from you is like a bit closer to heaven
Then again it's like being needled twenty-four seven

Despite all the piety you've been consuming thus far
Can anyone, somebody tell me what the fuck is going on?

Every day when the knife in my back starts to twinge and turn
My eyes are catching fire and my heart starts to burn
One foot away from you is like a bit closer to heaven
Then again it's like being needled twenty-four seven

"Death? What do you all know about death?"
