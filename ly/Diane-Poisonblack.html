		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  ""\""Hoe-Hoe-Hoe\""  I see you're shaking your ass on your slut-athon Still too fat to be fucked but hey keep going on You've painted your eyes and your scars all black Denying what you are  You've crossed the line there's no turning back With your wet cow-eyes you wave the \""fuck me\"" flag Sucking the fingers pointed at you Denying what you are  You say: See you on the other side What the hell is this other side? Diane - Tell me is your hell freezing over? Diane - Is the hunt finally over?  Drop dead gorgeous is what you're not Two tits and a hole is all that you've got You search for a heartbeat amid the dead Becoming what they are  Now open your eyes and see you're lying on a bed Aching all over as you've fucked with the dead Tears run down your (s)cum-stained face You are what you are  You say: See you on the other side What the hell is this other side? Diane - Tell me is your hell freezing over? Diane - Is the hunt finally over? Diane - Tell me what is behind those eyes? Diane - Is life regrets and lies?  Diane - Tell me is your hell freezing over? Diane - Is the hunt finally over? Diane - Tell me what is behind those eyes? Diane - Is life regrets and lies?""
