		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Say a little prayer for you

The moment I wake up
Before I put on my makeup (makeup)
I say a little prayer for you
While combing my hair now
And wondering what to wear now (wear now)
I say a little (for you)
Oh, baby

(Forever) forever, (forever) ever
You'll stay in my heart and I will love you
(Forever) forever, (and ever) ever
We never will part, and oh, how I love you
(Together) together, (together) together
(That's how it must be) to live without you
Would only be heartache for me
Ooh

I run for the bus, dear
While riding I think of us, dear (us, dear), hey
I say a little prayer for you, oh (oh, shawty)
At work I just take time
And all through my coffee break time (break time)
I say a little prayer for you

(Forever, forever) forever (ever)
(You'll stay in my heart and I will love you) oh yeah
(Forever and ever) ever
(We never will part, oh, how I love you) oh, I will love you
Together (together), together yeah
(That's how it must be to live without you) oh yeah

Would only be heartbreak for me
Only be heartbreak for me, ooh
