		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm gonna give you my
Undivided loving baby
You'll feel it body, mind, heart and soul
Come on and give me your
Undivided loving baby
You'll taste the sweetest love
You've ever known

Say you don't know what you've
Got until it's gone
It's easy to forget the beauty in someone
Taking them for granted,
You're with them everyday
Little by little the love slips away

When you love someone
Really love somebody
You've got to learn,
Learn to let the feelings show
Once I had someone,
Someone who really loved me
Won't make the same mistake,
This time I'll never let you go

I'm gonna give you my undivided loving baby
I want you body, mind, heart and soul
Come on and give me your
Undivided loving baby
You'll taste the sweetest love
You've ever known

Think of all you've done for me
Words can not express
The joy I feel inside you bring
Me such happiness
Working through the day
With one thing on my mind
I can't wait to be alone with you tonight

When you love someone, really love somebody
Show me how you feel in every way
Show me how you feel
Show me that you need me
Hold me close, promise me you'll stay

I'm gonna give you my undivided loving baby
I want you body, mind, heart and soul
Come on and give me your
Undivided loving baby
You'll taste the sweetest love
You've ever known

Come on and give me your
Undivided loving baby
Undivided love
Come and give me your
Undivided loving

I'm gonna give you my undivided loving baby
You'll feel it body, mind, heart and soul
Come on and give me your
Undivided loving baby
You'll taste the sweetest love
You've ever known

[repeat to fade]
