		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fragile, like a baby in your arms
Be gentle with me, I'd never willingly do you harm
Apologies are all you seem to get from me
But just like a child, you make me smile when you care for me
And you know

It's a question of lust, it's a question of trust
It's a question of not letting what we've built up crumble to dust
It is all of these things and more
That keep us together

Independence is still important for us though
(We realize)
It's easy to make the stupid mistake of letting go
(Do you know what I mean?)
My weaknesses, you know each and every one
(It frightens me)
But I need to drink more than you seem to think before I'm anyone's
And you know

It's a question of lust, it's a question of trust
It's a question of not letting what we've built up crumble to dust
It is all of these things and more
That keep us together

Kiss me goodbye when I'm on my own
But you know that I'd rather be home

It's a question of lust, it's a question of trust
It's a question of not letting what we've built up crumble to dust
It is all of these things and more
That keep us together
It's a question of lust, it's a question of trust
It's a question of not letting what we've built up crumble to dust
It is all of these things and more
That keep us together

It's a question of lust, it's a question of trust
It's a question of not letting what we've built up crumble to dust
It is all of these things and more
That keep us together
It's a question of lust, it's a question of trust
It's a question of not letting what we've built up crumble to dust
It is all of these things and more
That keep us together
