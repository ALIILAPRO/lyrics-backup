		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I always hoped that it
Could be something else
I couldn't think about it cos
It made me too depressed
And in my head it rang like silver bells
To think that even one single
Wound could be healed

But on a clear and cloudless day
It feels like the planet's atmosphere
Is stitched together by everyone's pain
And we just breathe it in
But they want something that
They couldn't get

Something that no longer exists
Or that doesn't yet and we try so hard
And we try to make something out of this

Sad and rainy day

I always hoped that it
Could be something else
I always hoped that it
Could be something else
I always hoped that it
Could be something else
I always hoped that it
Could be something else

I'M TIRED i'm out of breath
I'm scared of everything that's left
I just want some gentleness
But tension and despair is all we ever get

Are u ok?

Sorry, um

No no but like are-

Got kinda carried away there

I'm saying are you actually

Ok

Whatever

Lemme try this one more time

Building it out of ashes

Building it out of trash it's
All we've got left building it out of ashes
Building it out of trash it's
All we've got left

Motherfucker yeah!

On a clear and cloudless day
It feels like the planets atmosphere

Haha motherfucker yeah

Is stitched together by everyone's pain

Building it out of ashes
Building it out of trash it's
All we've got left building it out of ashes
Building it out of trash it's
All we've got left building it out of ashes
Building it out of trash it's
All we've got left building it out of ashes
Building it out of trash it's
All we've got left

I need somewhere to spit in here

Like my-
