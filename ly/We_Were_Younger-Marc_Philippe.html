		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And maybe I don't want your love
And maybe I don't want your love

And maybe
And maybe
And maybe
And maybe

You don't have to wait, you know my name
Sunshine and rain, some things don't change
Thinking about the days we were young, we were younger
Innocent in our ways, we were dumb, we were dumb, girl
But nothing really mattered, oh, I could always count on you
We were young, we were younger
Your touch will leave me breathless
Let me give it back to you

And maybe I don't want your love
And maybe I don't want your love
And maybe, oh my, oh my
You're my broken heart
You're my broken heart
And maybe I don't want your love
And maybe I don't want your love
And maybe, oh my, oh my
You're my broken heart
You're my broken heart

And maybe I don't want your love

We were young, we were younger
We were young, we were younger

And maybe I don't want your love
You don't have to wait, you know my name
Sunshine and rain, some things don't change
Thinking about the days we were young, we were younger
Innocent in our ways, we were dumb, we were dumb, girl
But nothing really mattered, oh, I could always count on you
We were young, we were younger
Your touch will leave me breathless
Let me give it back to you

And maybe I don't want your love
And maybe I don't want your love
And maybe, oh my, oh my
You're my broken heart
You're my broken heart
And maybe I don't want your love
And maybe I don't want your love
And maybe, oh my, oh my
You're my broken heart
You're my broken heart

And maybe I don't want your love
And maybe I don't want your love
And maybe, and maybe
And maybe I don't want your love
And maybe I don't want your love
And maybe I don't want your love
And maybe I don't want your love, want your love
And maybe I don't want your love
We were young, we were younger

And maybe I don't want your love

Oh my, oh my
You're my broken heart
You're my broken heart

And maybe I don't want your love
And maybe I don't want your love
And maybe I don't want your love
Oh my, oh my, you're my broken heart
And maybe I don't want your love, want your love
You're my broken heart
And maybe I don't want your love
