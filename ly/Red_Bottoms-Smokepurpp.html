		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Told her get that money, yeah
She love my red bottoms on her thousand dollar furniture
I'll be pourin' fours and fours, 'til the sun come up
I'll be sippin' 'til the sun come up, 'til the sun come up

Told her get that money, yeah
She love my red bottoms on her thousand dollar furniture
I'll be going frozen frozen, 'til the sun come up
I'll be sippin' 'til the sun come up, 'til the sun come up

Okay, stop, yeah
I ain't got no heart, yeah,
Addict at my heart, yeah,
I can't park my car, yeah
I think they forgot
I think they forgot, yeah
I been getting guap, yeah
Ice all on my watch, yeah

I think that they noticed
I've been feeling lost, yeah
Drugs got me lost, yeah
I feel like I'm floatin'
Floatin' through dimensions
I can't break the tension
I don't need attention

Told her get that money, yeah
She love my red bottoms on her thousand dollar furniture
I'll be going frozen frozen, 'til the sun come up
I'll be sippin' 'til the sun come up, 'til the sun come up

Okay
Told her get that money, yeah
She love my red bottoms on her thousand dollar furniture
I'll be going frozen frozen, 'til the sun come up
I'll be sippin' 'til the sun come up, 'til the sun come up
