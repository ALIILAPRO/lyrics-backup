		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I could be your boy
And you could be mine
Oh oh oh oh oh
I could be you toy
It would be fine
Oh oh oh oh oh
I could be your boy
And you could be mine
Oh oh oh oh oh
Bring me all your joy
It would be fine
You are in or not
Coming after you
I am really hot
I know you are too
I could be your clown
I will make it right
Don't say a word
Stay over tonight

I could be your boy and you could be my girl
(I could be your boy)
Come on, rock my world
I could be your boy and you could be my girl
(I could be your boy)
Come on, rock my world
I could be your boy and you could be my girl
(I could be your boy)
Come on, rock my world
I could be your boy and you could be my girl
(I could be your boy)
Come on, rock my world

Oh oh oh oh oh

I can't be you girl
Look at yourself
Oh oh oh oh oh
Maybe you have taken me
For someone else
Oh oh oh oh oh
I can't be your girl
Tu me fatigue
Oh oh oh oh oh
This is not your world
Boy your out of your league
Oh oh oh oh oh

Popsicle French boy, sure of yourself
I could get to know you but I just want to dance
I'm gonna make it clear
Parler vous fran√ßais
Ce n'est pas possible
Now, get out of my way

I could be your boy and you could be my girl
(I could be your boy)
Come on, rock my world
I could be your boy and you could be my girl
(I could be your boy)
Come on, rock my world
I could be your boy and you could be my girl
(I could be your girl)
Come on, rock my world
I could be your boy and you could be my girl
(I could be your boy)
Come on, rock my world
I could be your boy and you could be my girl
(I could be your boy)
Come on, rock my world
I could be your boy and you could be my girl
(I could be your boy)
Come on, rock my world
I could be your boy and you could be my girl
(I could be your girl)
Come on, rock my world
I could be your boy and you could be my girl
(I could be your boy)
Come on, rock my world
