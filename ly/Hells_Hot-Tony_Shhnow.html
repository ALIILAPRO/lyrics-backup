		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (You're minor, we're major)
I don't give a fuck
(Don't you just hate it when
You tryna' make a jugg)
(Major out here fuck niggas)
(And the bitch keep blowing up your phone)
(Dj Yung Rel what it do?)
(Drop that exclusive hoe)

Hells hot I hope you burn bitch
Ain't no money, I ain't concerned
I ain't jealous, I wait my turn
You get straightened out like a perm
Hoe you really get on my nerves

Hells hot I hope you burn hoe
She say I'm a animal
I dog her then I gotta' go
If it ain't no money in the
Topic I'ma tell you no
If you ain't come here to spend the
Night then what you here for
I don't want the model hoes
I want a real hoe ratchet bitch
She wanna' shake her ass
Until the club close
I don't got no ones on me
Tonight cause' I don't touch those
My palms itching, keep in touch
That's why these strippers touch toes
I'm Stephen Curry with that thirty
I clutch folks
I close doors, handle mine, I'ma big roll
Get your roll on, get your roll on
I wake up early in the morning
And I cut the stove on
Right wrist heavy, left wrist heavy
I'm on kickstand
I don't need no one in here to help me
My bitch extra sexy, but she super stressful
I put that bitch in Prada cause'
I think this hoe the devil

Hells hot I hope you burn bitch
Ain't no money, I ain't concerned
I ain't jealous, I wait my turn
You get straightened out like a perm
Hoe you really get on my nerves

Hells hot I hope you burn bitch
Ain't no money, I ain't concerned
I ain't jealous, I wait my turn
You get straightened out like a perm
Hoe you really get on my nerves

(Dj Yung Rel whats up?)
