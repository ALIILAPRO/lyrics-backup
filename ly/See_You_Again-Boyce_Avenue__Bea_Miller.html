		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

Damn, who knew?
All the planes we flew
Good things we've been through
That I'll be standing here talking to you
About another path
I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up
Look at things different, see the bigger picture
And those were the days
Hard work forever pays
And now I see you in a better place

How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through, you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride

It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

Aah-ooh-ooh-oh
Aah-ooh-ooh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh, uh, uh-uh-uh-uh

Oh, first you both go out your way
And the vibe is feeling strong
And small turn to a friendship
A friendship turn to a bond
That bond will never be broken
The love will never get lost
(Ey-yeah-yeah-yeah-ey-yeah-yeah)
And when brotherhood come first
The line will never be crossed
Established it on our own
When that line had to be drawn
That line is what we reach
So remember me when I'm gone

How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride

So let the light guide your way, yeah
And hold every memory as you go
And every road you take
Will always lead you home, home

It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

Aah-ooh-ooh-oh
Aah-ooh-ooh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh, uh, uh-uh-uh-uh (when I see you again)
(See you again) aah-ooh-ooh-oh
Aah-ooh-ooh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (uh, uh)
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh, uh, uh-uh-uh-uh (when I see you again)
