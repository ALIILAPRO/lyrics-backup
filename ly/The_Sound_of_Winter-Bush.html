		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mind strong, body strong
Try to find equilibrium
Head straight, screwed on
We screwed up for too long
I don't want to lean on the waves
I watched the storm evaporate
I think of you and starry skies
That keeps you so alive

Let's walk through the fire together
Disappear in the golden sands

It's all in your face
I see a break
It's like the sound of winter
The bleeding of love
The silent escape
You've got to hang on to yourself
It's like the sound of winter

Medusa smiles and Judas lips
Open arms and finger tips
Love bites, and recompense
I'll be with you until the end

Let's walk through the fire together
Disappear in the golden sands

It's all in your face
I see a break
It's like the sound of winter
The bleeding of love
The silent escape
You've got to hang on to yourself

All in your face
I see a break
It's like the sound of winter
The bleeding of love
The silent escape
You've got to hang on to yourself
It's like the sound of winter

Hang on to yourself
Hang on to yourself

It's like the sound of winter

It's all in your face
I see a break
It's like the sound of winter
The bleeding of love
The silent escape
You've got to hang on to yourself
It's like the sound of winter

It's like the sound of winter
Hang on to yourself
Hang on to yourself
