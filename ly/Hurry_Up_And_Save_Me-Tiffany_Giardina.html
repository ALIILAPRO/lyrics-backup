		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm going through the same day
Same place, same way I always do
Then I saw you from the corner of my eye
And it hit me like a ton of bricks,
I can't lie
Oh you got to me
My life was alright living in black and white
But you changed my point of view

Show me your colours
Show me your colours
'Cause without you I'm blue
(Without you I'm blue)

Hurry up and save me
Hurry up and save me
Hurry up and save me
Hurry up and save me
I just wanna feel alive
And I do when I'm with you

Hurry up and save me
Hurry up and save me
Hurry up and save me
Hurry up and save me
I just wanna feel alive
And I do when I'm with you

(Show me your colours
Show me your colours)

I have to have control of myself
My thoughts, my mind
Cause the way it's going down
In my life I feel like a prisoner
In a light
Are you feeling me
'Cause the way you make my
Break my ,shake my, walls around
I feel like I'm breaking out

Show me your colours
Show me your colours
'Cause without you I'm blue
(Without you I'm blue)

Hurry up and save me
Hurry up and save me
Hurry up and save me
Hurry up and save me
I just wanna feel alive
And I do when I'm with you
(Hurry hurry up)

Hurry up and save me (Save me)
Hurry up and save me (Save you)
Hurry up and save me (Save me)
Hurry up and save me
I just wanna feel alive
And I do when I'm with you

My window's opened up
Tonight I'm crawling out
Will you be there are you waiting
Will you be there will you save me

(So just save me, so just save me)
(Save me, save me) You can save me
(Save me, save me) I know you can save me
So just, so just save me
Without you I'm blue

Hurry up and save me
Hurry up and save me
Hurry up and save me
Hurry up and save me
I just wanna feel alive
And I do when I'm with you

Hurry up and save me (I'm blue)
Hurry up and save me (Are you)
Hurry up and save me (Are you)
Hurry up and save me (Are you)
I just wanna feel alive
And I do when I'm with you

Hurry up and save me (Save me)
Hurry up and save me (Save me)
Hurry up and save me (Save me)
Hurry up and save me (Save me)
I just wanna feel alive
And I do when I'm with you

Hurry up and save me (Save you)
Hurry up and save me (Save me)
Hurry up and save me (Save you)
Hurry up and save me (Save me)
I just wanna feel alive
And I do when I'm with you (Save you)
Save me, save me
