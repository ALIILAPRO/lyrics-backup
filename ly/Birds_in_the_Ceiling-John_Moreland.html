		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The night is sinking, and I'm in need of a song
There were birds in the ceiling, talking about feelings all summer long
Celestial bodies beam down on casinos
Our fathers still cling to their obsolete ethos

You made your house with the world burning down around you
Now that I think of it, I guess that's what we all do
I wanna build a new one, high atop a mountain
Where you'll lock me in your kindness and never let me out again

So let a bird be a bird, let a train be a train
Let the sky be the sky, let the rain be the rain
Let a curse be a curse, let a blessing be a blessing
Death alone is certain, but life is a beautiful question
