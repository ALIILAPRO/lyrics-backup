		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Down the hill
Near the river
Is what used to be our tree
You've been gone for days
Without a trace
All I see are fallen leaves

Ever since that day
I tried to find you
But the rain won't go away
Listen to the wind
Would he call my name
Cause I'm screaming yours again and again

And it hits so hard
To feel these scars
Cut deep on my heart

If I can't follow you this time
(Let you go)
Will you wait for me on the other side
The moment you lost faith
When there was no way out of this
How could I've known
That I had to let you go

It's been a year
Since you're gone
Since I came to see our tree
Have you left behind
Something more to find
But the roots beneath my feet

How can I keep calm
I believed in you
But the rain won't cease to fall
The wind has died
It never said a word
The echoes of my screams have gone unheard

And it's still so hard
To wear these scars
So deep on my heart

The rain is gone

One more time I'm walking down the hill
One more try to find a reason to
Feel alive
Now I know
After every storm
A flower will be born

If I can't follow you this time
(Let you go)
Will you wait for me on the other side
The moments in the rain
Have washed away the pain
And now I know
That I had to let you go
