		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You move like the clouds 
I fall like the rain 
You blocking me out
I swallow the pain 
You told me to go
I thought I could wait
You taught me
(Oh you taught me)
I don't have the strength 

But maybe in another life 
But maybe in another life
I'll meet you at a better time
In a better place 
In another life

All of these clouds
Take up your head 
And all of these doubts 
Are too much to bear
I gave you my hand
Tryna get you out of here 
I thought I could carry you
Waiting for the sky to clear 
Too much dirt on our shoes for a clean slate 
When I tell you how I feel now it just feels strange
It was never what I wanted but I need space 
I promise I'll still love you when we meet again

But maybe in another life 
But maybe in another life
I'll meet you at a better time
In a better place 
In another life

But maybe in another life (maybe in a another life)
But maybe in another life (maybe in a another life)
I'll meet you at a better time
In a better place 
In another life

And one day the sun will shine
Under the clear blue skies 
All of our dreams 
Won't go to waste

I know we can make it right 
When all of our stars align 
All of our dreams 
Fall into place

But maybe in another life 
But maybe in another life
I'll meet you at a better time
In a better place 
In another life
