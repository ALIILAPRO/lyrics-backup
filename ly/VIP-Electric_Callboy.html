		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey my friends
A warm welcome to you
You already know me
From that TV show

People just love me
For everything I am
The money and the girls
The American Dream

Wake up haters I'm a V.I.P
I know that everybody wants to be like me
I'm a rich kid, a rockstar, a man of the world
But no one must know that I am up to no good
So come on
Come on

I look like a young God
With these muscles made of steel
I got a secret weapon
It's called sex appeal

The boys getting jealous
The girls fall in love
I got money, sex and power
But the world is not enough

Wake up haters I'm a V.I.P
I know that everybody wants to be like me
I'm a rich kid, a rockstar, a man of the world
But no one must know that I am up to no good
So come on

Sometimes I feel like my money
Keeps my friends from getting closer
When I turn around, look at all I've got
It's so easy for me to not give a fuck

Wake up haters I'm a V.I.P
I know that everybody wants to be like me
I'm a rich kid, a rockstar, a man of the world
But no one must know that I am up to no good
So come on

Wake up haters I'm a V.I.P
I know that everybody wants to be like me
I'm a rich kid, a rockstar, a man of the world
But no one must know that I am up to no good
So come on

So come on
Yeah

Wake up haters I'm a V.I.P
I know that everybody wants to be like me
I'm a rich kid, a rockstar, a man of the world
But no one must know that I am up to no good
So come on
So come on
So come on
So come on
