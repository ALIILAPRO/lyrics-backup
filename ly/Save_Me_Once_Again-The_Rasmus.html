		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Like a stone
I'll go down
I'm too far 
To be found
Got no place
For the storm
All the love 
That I found
Couldn't turn me around
Drift away 
All alone

Don't say this is the end (oh-oh-oh-oh)
I think I'm lost again (oh-oh-oh-oh)

Thank you for your patience
The time that you gave me
I think I never knew
You were trying to save me
Free me from the shadow
That lay on my shoulder
Please don't say it's over, it's over, it's over

I confess
I was weak
Got my heart
Full of greed
Wanted more
Than I need

I'm standing on the edge (oh-oh-oh-oh)
Afraid of emptiness (oh-oh-oh-oh)
Don't leave me
I'm begging you my friend

Thank you for your patience
The time that you gave me
I think I never knew
You were trying to save me
Free me from the shadow
That lay on my shoulder
Please don't say it's over, it's over, it's over

Don't say that it's the end (oh-oh-oh-oh)
I think I'm lost again (oh-oh-oh-oh)
I'm standing on the edge (oh-oh-oh-oh)
Don't leave me
I'm begging you my friend
Save me once again

Would you save me once again?
Would you save me once again?
