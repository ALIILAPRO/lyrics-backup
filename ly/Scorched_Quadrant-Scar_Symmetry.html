		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now gaze at this ashen world
A declaration of defeat
Awaiting the final strike
Drones will spearhead the descent
Dive down to the barren ground
Search for survivors in the filth and grime
Drones search high and low
Above and below
Exterminators without remorse or guilt
From scanning satellites
We're guided out of sight
As furious shapes emerge
Discovered targets die
Our way the wicked's coming
Drones deployed to destroy
Now observing out of sight
Scanners pick up human scent
Errors as they calculate
Inconclusive
Inferno upon the earth
Besieged scorched quadrant set ablaze
The machines deployed
Craft sent to destroy
Determination ignited their circuits
From scanning satellites
We're guided out of sight
As furious shapes emerge
Discovered targets die
Our way the wicked's coming
Drones deployed to destroy
Carrion of disease, causing certain mutation
Suffer those who survived
Politics of the tech generation
Forced, I slowly will become
A born transgressor
To restore what still remains
An example to alternate the platforms of war

For I've seen a vision
The source undefined
I find myself immersed in conversation with the sky

Guided to the catacombs
By a coming race
From scanning satellites
We're guided out of sight
As furious shapes emerge
Discovered targets die
Our way the wicked's coming
Drones deployed to destroy
The quadrant burning bright
Scorned stands the sheltered site
Victorious grueling scourge
Those guided out of sight
Await the great undoing
And avoid their downfall
Carrion of disease, causing certain mutation
Suffer those who survived
Politics of the tech generation
