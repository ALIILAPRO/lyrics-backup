		  This is my deviant
This is my deviant
This is my deviant
This is my deviant
This is my deviant
This is my deviant
This is my deviant
This is my deviant

Down these vibrant hallways
I lead the choirs I have formed
(This is my deviant)
(This is my deviant)
As I hide my message
In the numbers we perform
(This is my deviant)
(This is my deviant)

A terminal shade is hanging over the stage
You tell me that it's obvious but
I'll never see it
I'll never see it
A subliminal rage is slowly straining the cage
The future sure looks ominous
You can almost feel it
I almost feel it

Lend me your ears
I promise this won't take long
(Won't take long)
Surrender to fear
I promise this won't take long
(Won't take long)

A terminal shade is hanging over the stage
(This is my deviant)
(This is my deviant)
I'll never see it
(This is my deviant)
I'll never see it
(This is my deviant)
A subliminal rage is slowing straining the cage
The future sure looks ominous
You can almost feel it
I almost feel it
