		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ahem
You ready, man?
Okay, yeah

Lookin' out my window, feelin' the crescendo
Sunset on a quiet sea
Sitting with the ones that I'll forever love
We're waitin' on a flash of green

And even when the nights got cold (got cold)
You have always held me close (me close)
You're the only rock that I could ever stand on
You're the only one for me

The sun goes up, the sun comes down
This old world keeps spinnin' 'round
I'm here travelin' down this long and winding road
Seasons come and seasons go
They take me high, then leave me low
But I'm still standing on the only rock I know
You're my cornerstone
Oh, oh, oh, no matter where I go, my cornerstone

Bible by my bedside, sweatin' through a long night
Wrestling the hounds of shame
Tryna turn the hands back on a troublin' past
Every move I make's in vain

But even in the shifting winds
You are who You've always been
You're the only rock that I could ever stand on
Through it all You remain

The sun goes up, the sun comes down
This old world keeps spinnin' 'round
I'm here travelin' down this long and winding road (this winding road)
Yeah, seasons come and seasons go
They take me high, then leave me low
But I'm still standing on the only rock I know
You're my cornerstone
Oh, oh, oh, no matter where I go, my cornerstone
Oh, oh, oh, no matter where I go, Mister Zach Williams

On Christ, the solid rock I'm standin'
All of the ground is sinking sand
On Christ, the solid rock I'm standin'
All of the ground is sinking sand
On Christ, the solid rock I'm standin', yes Lord

You're the only one that I will build my life on
Through it all You remain

The sun goes up, the sun comes down
This old world keeps spinnin' around
And I'm here travelin' down this long and winding road
Seasons come, seasons go
I've been high and I've been low
But I'm standing on the only rock I know
You're my cornerstone
Oh, oh, oh, no matter where I go, my cornerstone (all of the ground is sinking sand)
Oh, oh, oh, no matter where I go (all of the ground is sinking sand)

The sun goes up and the sun comes down (all of the ground is sinking sand)
And I build my life on this solid rock (all of the ground is sinking sand)
Oh, yeah

You are the only rock I stand on
