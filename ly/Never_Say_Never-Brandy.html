		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  [Chorus]
Who would ever thought a guy
Would want a girl like me
Who would ever thought that I
Would  fall so easily
Who would ever thought that we
Would finally come to be
I guess they just don't know
How much you mean to me
Who would ever thought that they
Would have some words to say
We'll go on anyway
It's alright, it's okay
Take what ever comes our way
Together we will stay
I got three words to say
Never say never

I can't believe they'd stop our happiness
By trying to pull us down with such a mess
Why can't they let us live just like the rest
And keep us out of all of this crazy madness
Now when they talk I think it's just a shame
That all they do is sit and think my name
When all that I do is mainly
Sit and think about my baby and me

Now baby they can't believe that
You and me are together
That's why they should have never
Never say never
There were times when we thought that
You an me could never be together
That's why we should have never
Never say never

[Chorus]

Now there's a lot of talkin' goin' round
About the way me and you gettin' down
What are they jealous are they hatin' me
I guess they all have their own Ph.D's
I wish that they would just stop sweatin' me
Stop trying to get the best of me
No matter what they say baby
We gotta move on because we're gonna be happy

We didn't let the thoughts that we had
We didn't let the words that they said
Keep us from the love we now have
Never say never
Simply for me to see when
Never would've been never allowed
Now that we are together
Never say never

[Chorus]

Never say, never say, never [Repeat: x8] 

[Chorus: x3]
