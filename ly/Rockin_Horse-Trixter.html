		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Telephone rings and she's got me hangin' on the wire
Tells me she's had enough of the same damn thing
What's wrong with Mr.Right
He ain't got the tools to satisfy you
Say the word 'cause I got your ticket to fly
1,2,3,4, lady needs the rockin' horse
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
C'mon baby won't you get on top of my rockin' horse
'Cause playin' safe ain't gonna get you what you need
3 a.m. I ain't supposed to hear the doorbell ring
Well push came to shove now she's got me ready to sing
I got her motor runnin'
She made my pistons burn and burn
And burn like fire and lit my last cigarette
1,2,3,4, lady loves the rockin' horse
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
C'mon baby won't you get on top of my rockin' horse
Feel the thunder below it's gonna make you scream
C'mon honey won't you get on top of my rockin' horse
'Cause playin' safe ain't gonna get you what you need
There ain't no way around it
You've got to live and learn
Sometimes you think you've found it
But you're bound to get burned
C'mon baby won't you get on top of my rockin' horse
Feel the thunder below it's gonna make you scream
Let's go honey won't you get on top of my rockin' horse
'Cause playin' safe ain't gonna get you what you need
