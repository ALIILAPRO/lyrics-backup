		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Solo-Mustaine
Mean and infectious
The evil Prophets rise
Dance of the Macabre
As witches Streak the sky
Decadent worship of
Black Magic sorcery
In the womb of the Devil's Dungeon
Trapped without a plea
Solo-Mustaine

See thing in agony
Necrosis is the fate
Pins sticking through the skin
The venom now sedates
Locked in a pillory
Nowhere to be found
Screaming for your life
But no one hears a sound
Help me
Prepare the patients scalp
To peel away
Metal caps his ears
He'll hear not what we say
Solid steel visor
Riveted cross his eyes
Iron staples close his jaws

So no one hears his cries
The skull beneath the skin
Now your drawn and quartered
Your bones will make the x
Symbol stands for poison
And it's chained to your head
And as we fold your arms
To make the holy cross
We cross the crucifix
Religion has been lost
The skull beneath the skin
Solo-Mustaine
