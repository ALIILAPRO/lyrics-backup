		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Climb aboard a butterfly
An' take off on the breeze
Let your worries flutter by
An' do the things you please
In a land where dollar bills
Are fallin' off the trees
On a dreamer's holiday!

Every day for breakfast
There's a dish of scrambled stars
An' for lunchin' you'll be munchin'
Rainbow candy bars
You'll be livin' a la mode
On Jupiter and Mars
On a dreamer's holiday!

Make it a long vacation
Time, there is plenty of
You need no reservation
Just bring along the one you love

Help yourself to happiness
An' sprinkle it with mirth
Close your eyes an' concentrate
An' dream for all you're worth
You will feel terrific
When you get back down to earth
From a dreamer's holiday!

(You, climb aboard a butterfly)
(An' take off on the breeze)
(Let your worries flutter by)
(An' do the things you please)
In a land where dollar bills
Are fallin' off the trees,
On a dreamer's holiday!

(Every day for breakfast)
(There's a dish of scrambled stars)
(And for lunchin' you'll be munchin')
(Rainbow candy bars)
You'll be livin' a la mode
On Jupiter and Mars
On a dreamer's holiday!

Come on, we're gonna make it a long vacation
Time, there is plenty of
You need no reservation
Just bring along the one you love

Help yourself to happiness
An' sprinkle it with mirth
Close your eyes an' concentrate
An' dream for all you're worth
You will feel terrific
When you get back down to earth
From a dreamer's holiday!
