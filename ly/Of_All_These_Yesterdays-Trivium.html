		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take away all of this pain
Life feels like it's all in vain
Life feels like it's all in vain

Blindingly it seeps through the trees
Burning bright, subconscious streams
Falling light, dismantled dreams

We are too far gone
We are too far gone
We are too far gone
We were, never meant to make it this far

We are too far gone
We are too far gone
We are too far gone
We were, never meant to make it this far

I feel the rage
And it burns the pages
Of all these yesterdays

We are all damaged and wrong
Practicing for death alone
Practicing for death alone
Hope has gone cold with its cause
Lost inside its every flaw
Life is finally swallowed raw

We are too far gone
We are too far gone
We are too far gone
We were, never meant to make it this far

I feel the rage
And it burns the pages
Of all these yesterdays

I'm covered fast
In the falling ashes
Of all these yesterdays

With the end in sight
I clench what's left of light
Pressing against my head
And dream of the color red

With the end in sight
I clench what's left of light
Pressing against my head
And dream of the color red

I feel the rage
And it burns the pages
Of all these yesterdays

I'm covered fast
In the falling ashes
Of all these yesterdays

I feel the rage
And it burns the pages
