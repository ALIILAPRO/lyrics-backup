		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Cancelled the hot hipster threesome for you
'Cause I preach a freedom, but you're a fucking great excuse
Plus I'd rather get naked and swim in your blow-up pool
And dry our dolphin bodies off and question your tattoos

'Cause he's so pretty when he goes down on me
Cold-skinned eager, baby, blue shirt out the laundry
He tells me he's gentle when he wants to be
So I think he wants to be gentle with me

Such a short drive to get to the touch tank to you
Deep sea pearl, my soft manta ray (manta ray)
Tender two fingers that touch the display
I used to dive deep 'til I got splashed in the face

He's so pretty when he goes down on me
Cold-skinned eager, baby, blue shirt out the laundry
He tells me he's gentle when he wants to be
So I think he wants to be gentle with me

You took my breath away
So now I can't suck in my stomach around you anymore
We're too old to live with our parents
Do you wanna wake up to me every morning?
Every morning
Every morning
I'm swimming into you
Into the ocean in a parachute
I'm swimming into you
And jumping to the ocean

He's so pretty when he goes down on me
Cold-skinned eager, baby, blue shirt out the laundry
He tells me he's gentle when he wants to be
So I think he wants to be gentle with me
