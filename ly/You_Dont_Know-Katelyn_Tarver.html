		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know you got the best intentions
Just tryna find the right words to say
I promise I've already learned my lesson
But right now, I wanna be not okay

I'm so tired, sitting here waiting
If I hear one more "Just be patient"
It's always gonna stay the same

So let me just give up
So let me just let go
If this isn't good for me
Well, I don't wanna know

Let me just stop trying
Let me just stop fighting
I don't want your good advice
Or reasons why I'm alright

You don't know what it's like
You don't know what it's like

Can't stop these feet from sinking
And it's starting to show on me
You're staring while I'm blinking
But just don't tell me what you see

I'm so over all this bad luck
Hearing one more "Keep your head up"
Is it ever gonna change?

So let me just give up
So let me just let go
If this isn't good for me
Well, I don't wanna know

Let me just stop trying
Let me just stop fighting
I don't want your good advice
Or reasons why I'm alright

You don't know what it's like
You don't know what it's like

Don't look at me like that
Just like you understand
Don't try to pull me back

Let me just give up
Let me just let go
If this isn't good for me
Well, I don't wanna know

Let me just stop trying
Let me just stop fighting
I don't want your good advice
Or reasons why I'm alright

You don't know what it's like
You don't know what it's like
You don't know, you don't know, you don't know
You don't know what it's like
You don't know what it's like
You don't know, you don't know
You don't know what it's like
You don't know what it's like
