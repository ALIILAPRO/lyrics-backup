		  (Cannon)

They say I left the hood, but I got it on my back (on my back)
Ask Gotti, yeah, I got it on my back (on my back)
Took a trip outta town, went and got 'em, brought 'em back
Mister El Chapo, underground, now I'm back (yeah)
Ask Sno, nigga, I got it on my back (ask Sno)
Ask your ho, nigga, I got it on my back (ask your ho)
Who want a load? Nigga, I got 'em in the back (in the back)
We sell 'em whole, and you can't return 'em back (let's go)

Damn, bald head, Pac shit
Plus my main thing like to eat with chopsticks (damn)
I can whip a dream with a fork, nigga (fork, nigga)
Yeah, play that Pyrex like a sport, nigga
The highway hot, nigga no shade (shade)
Picked up a hunnid packs, split it two ways (ayy)
Damn, that's fifty here, and fifty there
Get it in the attic, money in the air
That soda in that yola caught a fade, bitch
Clean it up with the same card we play Spades with
The streets ain't a game, you can't renege (nah)
Grown man shit, you can't play kids
You ever been to Hell? Been off in a cell? (Damn)
Two codefedants, you better not tell (nah)
Water in the vision bowl, yeah you know the smell
Breakin' out the weight set, yeah you know the scale
Even got our stamps on it, yeah you know the brail (ayy)
Feds put the dogs on it, smell it like it's quail (ooh)
Blowin' money fast, yeah I lived to tell the tale (Tale)
They say that I'm irrelevant, it ain't no way in Hell

They say I left the hood, but I got it on my back (on my back)
Ask Gotti, yeah I got it on my back (on my back)
Took a trip outta town, went and got 'em, brought 'em back
Mister El Chapo, underground, now I'm back (yeah)
Ask Sno, nigga, I got it on my back (ask Sno)
Ask your ho, nigga, I got it on my back (ask your ho)
Who want a load? Nigga, I got 'em in the back (in the back)
We sell 'em whole, and you can't return 'em back (let's go)

This money standin' tall, nigga, Yao Ming
Five tickets off a whole load of greens
Yeah, and I ain't talkin' soul food
I just put a quarter mil' in an old school
Niggas talkin' brick talk, to me that's old news (old news)
Niggas braggin' on they plug when they owe dude
I don't gotta tell (tell)
Nigga, I'm in the lab (kitchen)
I want twenty for a half, forty for a slab (bricks)
And a ten for a quarter if you can do the math
Your bitch deepthroat, I call her lil' giraffe (ugh)
And I'm a plug's first pick if they had a draft
I put bricks in the Uber, used to be a cab (yeah)
Long story short, and the short story long (story long)
I'ma get money, try to free 'em 'til they home ('til they home)
Eight figure nigga, boy I came up sellin' zones
2020 Rolls truck, I set it on chrome (on chrome)
Bitch want a Chanel, she gon' hold a sack
He think I'm a pussy, he must be on crack
Shawty like that Rolls truck, I got 'em back to back
They tryna say I left the hood, when I got it on my back (got it on my back)

Ask Sno, nigga, I got it on my back (ask Sno)
Ask your ho, nigga, I got it on my back (ask your ho)
Who want a load? Nigga, I got 'em in the back (in the back)
We sell 'em whole, and you can't return 'em back (let's go)
They say I left the hood, but I got it on my back (on my back)
Ask Gotti, yeah I got it on my back (on my back)
Took a trip outta town, went and got 'em, brought 'em back
Mister El Chapo, underground, now I'm back (yeah)

Ask Sno, nigga, I got it on my back (ask Sno)
Ask Gotti, yeah I got it on my back (on my back)
Who want a load? Nigga, I got 'em in the back (in the back)
Ask Gotti, yeah I got it on my back (yeah)
They say I left the hood but I got it on my back (on my back)
Mister El Chapo, underground, now I'm back
