		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She makes me smile
She thinks the way I think
That girl makes me wanna be better
Took her down Bleecker Street
Saw she drank the way I drink
I kiss the sky to send her blue a letter
That girl
Makes me wanna be a better man
Ye should she see fit
Gonna treat her like a real man can
She's fearless, she's free
Oh she is a real live wire
And that girl
She's got me feeling so much better
Oh you trade all the money in the world
Just to see this girl's smile
All the while, she'll make you feel so much better

Oh that girl, makes me wanna be a better man
And should she see fit, gonna treat her like a real man can
Ah, ah, la la la
Come on in my arms
You make me feel alright
You make me feel alright
You know I might get eager
I might lose my cool
Feel like I'm in detention
In the office at the school
And you'll either love me love me
Or you hate me
But I can see you've got no time
For the in-between
But the reflection in your eyes
Gonna look so much better
I said that girl makes me wanna be a better man
Yeah yeah yeah
And should she see she fit, gonna treat her like a real man can

Gonna treat her like a real man can
Gonna treat her like a real man can
Gonna treat her like a real man can
