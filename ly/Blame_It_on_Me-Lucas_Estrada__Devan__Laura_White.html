		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There must be something in the water The way we fight is getting out of hand But I still believe
That we're meant to be
And I know
That every battle makes us stronger

When it's said and done
I'm not going anywhere I'm sticking with you Oh
You'll still be the one
We can fight forever we got nothing to lose

I can blame it on you Blame it on me
On me on me on me on me You can blame it on you Blame it on me
On me on me on me on me

On me on me On me on me On me on me On me on me

I feel our troubles growing deeper But not enough to put us out of love You're still what I need
You get all of me
And I know
With you the grass is never greener

When it's said and done
I'm not going anywhere I'm sticking with you Oh
You'll still be the one
We can fight forever we got nothing to lose

I can blame it on you Blame it on me
On me on me on me on me You can blame it on you Blame it on me
On me on me on me on me X2

When it's said and done
I'm not going anywhere I'm sticking with you Oh
You'll still be the one
We can fight forever we got nothing to lose
