		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's no pain in paradise
No heartbreak in Heaven
No Mondays or traffic lights
How could it be real?
You're up near the satellites
You left in a second
Yeah, that was the only time the earth stood still

Velvet skies when I close my eyes
Free-falling into another space and time
I miss you and your electric life
(Shine on bright)
Beautiful to the bitter end (ah)
You blew away like glitter in the wind (ah-ah)
I miss you and your electric life
Ah ah ah, your electric life
Ah ah ah, your electric life
Ah ah ah, your electric life
Ah ah ah, your electric life

Take a look at the milky way
At 11:11
Are any of these shooting stars
A message from you?
Is there any other way?
Got millions of questions
But one always breaks my heart (it breaks my heart)
And so does the truth

Velvet skies when I close my eyes
Free falling into another space and time
I miss you and your electric life
(Shine on bright)
Beautiful to the bitter end (ah)
You blew away like glitter in the wind (ah-ah)
I miss you and your electric life
Ah ah ah, your electric life
Ah ah ah, your electric life
Ah ah ah, your electric life (your electric life)
Ah ah ah, your electric life

Ah ah ah, your electric life
Ah ah ah, your electric life
