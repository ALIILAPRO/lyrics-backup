		  Stamp on the ground
Jump, jump, jump, jump
Moving all around
Tep tep da dow
Stamp on the ground
Jump, jump, jump, jump
Moving all around
Jumping all around

Jumping all around

Drop the beat

Jumping all around

We're sending out an invitation
To everyone in every nation
But don't sleep get on the run
Stop thinkin' and have some fun

Stamp on the ground
Jump, jump, jump, jump
Moving all around
Tep tep da dow
Stamp on the ground
Jump, jump, jump, jump
Moving all around
We're jumping all around

Stamp on the ground
Jump, jump, jump, jump
Moving all around
Tep tep da dow
Stamp on the ground
Jump, jump, jump, jump
Moving all around
We're jumping all around

Drop the beat

So come and join our love foundation
Go feel the heat, the sweet vibration
'Cause we are about to ignite
And we wanna go out tonight

Stamp on the ground
Jump, jump, jump, jump
Moving all around
Tep tep da dow
Stamp on the ground
Jump, jump, jump, jump
Moving all around
Jumping all around

Jumping all around

Drop the beat

Jumping all around
