		<p>
		  Ponyo, Ponyo, Ponyo, fishy in the sea
Tiny little fishy, who could you really be?
Ponyo, Ponyo, Ponyo, magic sets you free
Oh, she's a little girl with a round tummy

Tip, tippy toe, jump, jump, and hop
Now that I've got my legs, I cannot stop
Pat, paddy pat, waving hello
Come and hold hands with me, dancing we go
My feet are skipping, my heart, too
Happy happy are we all!
Maybe I might love you
Maybe I might love you
So hold on tight and hold me close
You're my hero

Ponyo, Ponyo, Ponyo, fishy in the sea
Tiny little fishy, who could you really be?
Ponyo, Ponyo, Ponyo, magic sets you free
Oh, pretty little girl will you
Swim back to me?

Yum, yummy yum, I smell a treat
Let's fill our tummies now
Good things to eat
Peek, peek-a boo, that's what we'll do
"I see my favorite boy, he sees me too!"
My cheeks are rosy from smiling
Laughing, laughing are we all
Maybe I might love you
Maybe I might love you
So hold on tight and hold me close
You're my hero

Ponyo, Ponyo, Ponyo, fishy in the sea
Tiny little fishy, who could you really be?
Ponyo, Ponyo, Ponyo, magic sets you free
Oh, she's a little girl with a round tummy
