		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You joined the gang
And you're down for the cause
You want to be like one of us
All of your life, try to make some sense of it

You got distracted, you're in the wrong lane
It's not the first time we'll miss the train
All of your life, try to make some sense of it

You lost your hope but then you found it
You like the word but can't pronounce it
You like the song the way it sounded, oh

I talked to God, what's happened to me?
Should I be scared if you're answering?
All of your life try to make some sense of it

You lost your hope but then you found it
You like the word but can't pronounce it
You like the song the way it sounded, oh

You lost your hope but then you found it
You like the word but can't pronounce it
You like the song the way it sounded, oh

All of your life, try to make some sense of it

All of your life, try to make some sense of it

All of your life, try to make some sense of it

All of your life, try to make some sense of it
