		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey

Jenny Jenny who can I turn to?
You give me something I can hold on to
I know you'll think I'm like the others before
Who saw your name and number on the wall

Jenny I've got your number
I need to make you mine
Jenny don't change your number

Eight six seven five three oh nine
Eight six seven five three oh nine
Eight six seven five three oh nine
Eight six seven five three oh nine

Jenny Jenny you're the girl for me
Oh, you don't know me but you make me so happy
I tried to call you before but I lost my nerve
I tried my imagination but I was disturbed

Jenny I've got your number
I need to make you mine
Jenny don't change your number

Eight six seven five three oh nine
Eight six seven five three oh nine
Eight six seven five three oh nine
Eight six seven five three oh nine

I got it (I got it) I got it
I got your number on the wall
I got it (I got it) I got it
For a good time, for a good time call

Hey, Jenny don't change your number
I need to make you mine
Jenny I've called your number

Eight six seven five three oh nine
Eight six seven five three oh nine
Eight six seven five three oh nine
Eight six seven five three oh nine

Jenny Jenny who can I turn to 
(Eight six seven five three oh nine)
For the price of a dime I can always turn to you 
(Eight six seven five three oh nine)

Eight six seven five three oh nine
Eight six seven five three oh nine
Eight six seven five three oh nine
Eight six seven five three oh nine (five three oh nine)
Eight six seven five three oh nine (five three oh nine)
Eight six seven five three oh nine (five three oh nine)
Eight six seven five three oh nine (five three oh nine)
