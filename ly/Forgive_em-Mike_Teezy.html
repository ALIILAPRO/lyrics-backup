		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  cye I had some beef with the devil
So I had to hop in the stu (I did!)
If we start talking bout opps
Well I probably got me a few (I do!)
You can keep talking about me
cs long as you keeping your cool
Lord forgive 'em (Lord forgive them please)
Yeah cause they do not know what they're doing
Forgive 'em
They do not know what they're doing
Forgive 'em
They must not know what they're doing
I had some beef with the devil 
So it's only right that I hop in the stu
To my opps, I forgive 'em
They must not know what they're doing

They must not know what they're doing
I guess it's time that I school 'em
It's Jesus who reigns over me
cnd they unconsciously let the enemy rule them
If they're serving discord in the Kingdom of God
Well I'm pushing the plate cause I'm full then
Just like crabs in a bucket that's swimming around
If you're tryna get out, you'll get pulled in
(don't get pulled in now)
But the fact of the matter is
This ain't even flesh and blood
That we battling
It's really the enemy
Using your brother or sister 
Tryna get you mad again
Pushing your buttons
Tryna get you saying something 
That'll pull you right back to sin
Man if you're tired or feel like you're losing the fight
Let me give you a hack to win
If you wanna start living (I do!)
Well you gotta forgive 'em

cye I had some beef with the devil
So I had to hop in the stu (I did!)
If we start talking bout opps
Well I probably got me a few (I do!)
You can keep talking about me
cs long as you keeping your cool
Lord forgive 'em (Lord forgive them please)
Yeah cause they do not know what they're doing
Forgive 'em
They do not know what they're doing
Forgive 'em
They must not know what they're doing
I had some beef with the devil 
So it's only right that I hop in the stu
To my opps, I forgive 'em
They must not know what they're doing

cye yeah 
They must not know what they're doing
cye yeah 
They must not know what they're doing
Forgive 'em

Yeah cause they do not know what they're doing
Forgive 'em
They do not know what they're doing
Forgive 'em
They must not know what they're doing
I had some beef with the devil 
So it's only right that I hop in the stu
To my opps, I forgive 'em
They must not know what they're doing
