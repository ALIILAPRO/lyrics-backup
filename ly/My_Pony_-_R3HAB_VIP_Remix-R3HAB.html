		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (If you want it, let's do it
Ride it, my pony)

Don't you hold back
You should know that I like
The way you move
You're sure inviting
I'm deciding that I
Will leave with you

Look at you in that dress
You got the things I want
Oh, you're so dangerous
I'm longing for your touch
Love how you take control
When you're on top of me
So won't you take me there
'Cause I know what you need
Oh yeah

If you want it, let's do it
Ride it, my pony
My saddle's waiting
Come on, jump on it
If you want it, let's do it
Ride it, my pony
My saddle's waiting
Come on, jump on it

Do it, ride it
Come on, jump on it

Don't you slow down
In the first round as you
You hold the reins, whoa, yeah
You're hypnotizing
I'm testifying, girl, you
You drive me insane

Look at you in that dress
You got the things I want
Oh, you're so dangerous
But I'm longing for your touch
Love how you take control
When you're on top of me
So won't you take me there
'Cause I know what you need
Oh yeah

If you want it, let's do it
Ride it, my pony
My saddle's waiting
Come on, jump on it
If you want it, let's do it
Ride it, my pony
My saddle's waiting
Come on, jump on it

Do it, ride it
Come on, jump on it

Oh yeah
If you want it, let's do it
Ride it, my pony
My saddle's waiting
Come on, jump on it
If you want it, let's do it (let's do it)
Ride it, my pony
My saddle's waiting
Come on, jump on it
