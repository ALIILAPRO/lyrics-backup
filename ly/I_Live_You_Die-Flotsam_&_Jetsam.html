		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Your life passes you by, I live, you die
The arena's mine, I live, you die

Entry of the gladiators, 264 B.C
The emperors and nobles have made a pawn of me
I battle slaves and freemen and wild blood thirsty beasts
The red sand surrounds me, so they can't see them bleed

Your life passes you by (I live, you die)
The Reaper is near
Again the arena is mine (I live, you die)
I live, you die

Sword drawn and battle ready, Trajan in command
Fight 'til death 100 days, corpses of 2000 men
The masses they decide the fate of a fallen man
Thumbs down in drunken haste, life's taker and giver I am

Your life passes you by (I live, you die)
The Reaper is near
Again the arena is mine (I live, you die)
I live, you die

Innocent children dressed like the sacred lamb
Taken for Nero's slaughter, as the people look away
To the pit dogs they are prey, the people look away

I live, you die

Persecuted Christians in the blood soaked ring
Many over many lose their lives, peace to their soul it brings
The thrills from the kills, those that I have slain
Are keeping my heart pounding, I live another day

Your life passes you by (I live, you die)
The Reaper is near
Again the arena is mine (I live, you die)
I live again
Your life passes you by (I live, you die)
The Reaper is near
Again the arena is mine (I live, you die)
I live, you die
Die, die, die
