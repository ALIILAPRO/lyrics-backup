		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Snapshot is a hunting term
Either stay in position or you're gonna learn
I'm a provider and I gotta earn
So sit your ass down, baby, wait your turn

You fool, you barely even know yourself
You fooled you and I'll do you one better
The old rules are unwritten
We can have our blood soaked baptism

Shame? I'm not ashamed
I built this place
It's not a home, more like a cage
Where nothing's safe
So you can play or turn away
'Cause in the end
We all receive what we emit
It's not a safe house, it's a cage

Take a snapshot and remember this moment
We all make shitty choices but now you gotta own it
He hid out in the bushes, sleuthing only money buys
That was the night I found out that you were uncivilized

You're a fool who can barely control yourself
Who fooled you into thinking your words matter?
The old rules are unwritten
You can have your blood soaked masochism

Shame? I'm not ashamed
I built this place
It's not a home, more like a cage
Where nothing's safe
So you can play or turn away
'Cause in the end
We all receive what we emit
It's not a safe house, it's a cage

First head down the street
Then up the stairs
Bedrooms on the left
I'll meet you there
Fall asleep in peace
It's different when you wake
Much to your surprise
The whole mood has changed
Now your feet are bound
And your hands are chained
The red light is on
And it's facing your way
Now you're just like me
Always on display
For the whole world to see
Humiliated and betrayed
So play your position
Change your face
This is our kingdom
We built this place
So play your position
Change your face
This is our kingdom
We built this place

Shame? I'm not ashamed
I built this place
It's not a home, more like a cage
Where nothing's safe
So you can play or turn away
'Cause in the end
We all receive what we emit
It's not a safe house, it's a cage
