		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Boy listen carefully to me now
Cause this is something every man should know
Oh this is a lesson about how 
You treat your girl right just let it show
That you love her that you need her say 
That you want her in every way
You gotta show your girl a little respect 
Or you won't get nothing back but hate

It's those little things that mean so much
You gotta treat her right
Or get out of her sight

Do you really want me am I really special
Taking is so easy boys giving back unusual 
If you really want me don't make me wait too long 
Respect and love is the key just listen to my song
Safe is how she wants to feel 
Protect her with all you've got 
Oh she wants to know your love's for real 
And be a good lover make her hot
Then she'll do everything love you day and night 
She'll do anything just do her right 
It's those little things that mean so much
You gotta treat her right 
Or get out of her sight

[Chorus:]

Girls don't give up, give your best 
No part time job, no time to rest
Let him know what's up before 
So he can give you more and more
