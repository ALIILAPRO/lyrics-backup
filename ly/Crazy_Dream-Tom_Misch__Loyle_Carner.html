		  Crazy dream 
Crazy dream
Crazy dream
Crazy dream
Crazy dream
Crazy dream
Crazy dream
Crazy dream

And as I wake up from this crazy dream
I hope that things remain as they seem
'Cause as I wake up from this crazy dream
From this dream

I had a dream about you last night
And we were listening to Pharcyde
Something to something started spinning in the past life
So I kept the singing to the bar side, we were on the last ride
Saying it's the past but the present moving fast I ain't thinking bout the last time
It's fine, but they were saying did you ask my
Brothers if I'm ready for the last line
Never in the way you move with
It's bugging me out
I kept squeak, left feet don't trouble me now
It gets peaked if the D starts loving the sound
But we were running from the beast, start fucking around
'Cause if I break the singular jack, cause a little bit of trouble fill a fifth of the yack
It's not that quick to react if I finish the pact we move forward now, I'm bringing it back

And as I wake up from this crazy dream
I hope that things remain as they seem
'Cause as I wake up from this crazy dream
From this dream
Crazy dream 
Crazy dream
Crazy dream
Crazy dream
Crazy dream
Crazy dream
Crazy dream
Crazy dream

She was saying
Don't start but we feel it at the same time
Won't part, but repeat it in the same shine
So dark gotta kneel it in the rain, it's fine
Lost part but she's reeling 'n the blame is mine
Is mine, mine, mine

And as I wake up from this crazy dream
I hope that things remain as they seem
'Cause as I wake up from this crazy dream
From this dream
And as I wake up from this crazy dream
I hope that things remain as they seem
'Cause as I wake up from this crazy dream
From this dream
Crazy dream 
Crazy dream
Crazy dream
Crazy dream
Crazy dream
Crazy dream
Crazy dream
Crazy dream
