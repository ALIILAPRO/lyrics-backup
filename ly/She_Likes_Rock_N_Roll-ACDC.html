		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A little game of falling down,
You rock 'n' roll when the call come 'round,
Come on baby, and make some time,
Made in the shade and you wished it'd turned around,
You're gonna rock, you'll roll the night away,
You're gonna roll baby, and I'll make the grade,
We gonna rock you now, rockin' and rollin' all in the town,
You're gonna make it right, we're gonna need to rock all night,

She digs rock 'n' roll,
She likes rock 'n' roll,
You want rock 'n' roll,
I need rock 'n' roll everyday,
And all through the night,

We are a gang coming down,
We're gonna rock all night,
Rockin' rollin' all the time
She may be home, rollin' out the grove,
You know that rock and rolls, squeezing out the tube,

She digs rock 'n' roll,
She likes rock 'n' roll,
You want rock 'n' roll,
I need rock 'n' roll,
Everyday, and through the night,
She digs rock 'n' roll, she gives rock 'n' roll, she gives me rock 'n' roll,
I like rock 'n' roll,

I gotta dance all night long,
And rock into the room,
She likes sugar, and I like honey too,
We gonna rock it,
Ain't gonna mess around with you,

She digs rock 'n' roll,
She likes rock 'n' roll,
You want rock 'n' roll,
I need rock 'n' roll,
Everyday, and through the night,

She digs rock 'n' roll,
She gives rock 'n' roll,
She lives rock 'n' roll,
I like rock 'n' roll,
We gonna rock 'round, rockin' rollin' all in the town,
We're gonna make it right,
We're gonna make it rock all night,
We're gonna rock 'round,
Rockin' rollin' all in the town,
We're gonna make it right,
We're gonna make it rock all night
