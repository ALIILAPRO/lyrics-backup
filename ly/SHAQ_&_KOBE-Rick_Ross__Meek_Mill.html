		  What is this?
(Maybach Music)
I like this Maybach Music
Sweet
Hahahaha

Niggas wanna see you lose when you're makin' moves (moves)
We bringin' tools in any rooms, we tryna break the rules (rules)
Niggas is haters, they ain't goons, we tryna make them fool (fool)
I never thought I'd make the Forbes before I make the news (never)
Havin' a threesome with some bitches, it's still ain't amusin' (I ain't)
I pick and choose, put on my jewels, it's like I lit the fuse (it's lit)
I call the shots, and all the killers be like, "What's the move?" (Let's get it)
Hundred grand, you and your little man gets split in two (splitter)
Mmm, my life got way realer
Playin' with them millions and they turned me to a made nigga
Any way, and the cash is type reactive when they play with 'em
Statements got retracted when niggas ratted, 'cause we sprayed niggas
Mafioso sippin' Lobos
Jumpin' on the chopper to the yacht off the gold coast
We was totin' choppers on the block, sellin' coco
Now we treatin' models like they thots out in SoHo (yeah)
Thirty mill' in cash, do these niggas bad (bad)
They never thought I'd go this far just from a pen and pad (pad)
I seen my dawg kill my dawg, just to get his stash
He went up top, they banged him out, got that nigga slayed

(Too much)
Too much money and power
Walk up in the spot, a bunch of steppers, we tuckin' the chopper (huh)
Too much money and power (too much)
Hustlin' twenty-four hours (twenty-four hours)
Too much money and power
Stumble into the penthouse with a baddie to fuck in the shower (huh)
Too much money and power (too much)
Hustlin' twenty-four hours

I left your team of niggas in the red tape (huh)
Diggin' through they pockets, left they shoes unlaced
Homicide on another case
Mouth wide, gold teeth with a pale face (bang)
My niggas couldn't read, had impediments (huh)
But they never would leave any evidence (huh)
Your mother still in pain, it been a few days
What you know, this all it came with minimum wage
They thought it was a game 'til the shots rang
Six niggas layin' on the same box spring
How you dead broke but got a dope charge?
Gotta rob a bank just to post bond (huh)
Got this chopper with me for the close calls
Helicopter on the roof since I won't walk (God)
Killin' niggas in the streets, I call it a feast
Twenty million, I can see, and all in a week (boss)
We only on the yachts with tequila shots (huh)
It's only paperwork when we leave the lot
Calamari in California, yeah, I want a kiss
All you envious devil demons, you can suck a dick (bitch)
I hope you die slow with your blindfold (huh)
Ya bitch still at home with her mind blown (huh)
I got a pool of parrots and some buffalos (woo)
And I got a pool in Paris in a bungalow (ha-ha-ha)
Still flippin' numbers talking summer sauce
Everybody get to eat, that's what a winner called (Double M)
Sippin' champagne, I own it myself (boss)
You niggas better learn to own you some wealth

(Too much)
Too much money and power
Walk up in the spot, a bunch of steppers, we tuckin' the chopper (huh)
Too much money and power (too much)
Hustlin' twenty-four hours (twenty-four hours)
Too much money and power
Stumble into the penthouse with a baddie to fuck in the shower (huh)
Too much money and power (too much)
Hustlin' twenty-four hours

Some of this shit too good to be true
(M-M-M)
