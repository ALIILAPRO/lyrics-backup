		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We are the new breed
We are the future
We are the new breed
We are the future

We are immune to life itself
Cold rules are reality
We are immune to life itself
Cold rules are reality

Born, bred, beaten
Born, bred, beaten

We have control of destiny
We have control of what's to be
We have control of destiny
We have control of what's to be

Born, bred, beaten
Born, bred, beaten

New breed, new breed
New breed, new breed

We are immune to life itself
Cold rules are reality
We have control of destiny
We have control of what's to be

Born, bred, beaten
Born, bred, beaten

New breed, new breed
New breed, new breed

New breed, we are the new breed
New breed, we are the future
New breed, we are the new breed
New breed, we are the future

New breed
New breed
New breed
