		  Fade out

In the morning, the lights will fade out
Fade out
In the morning, the lights will fade out
Fade out

You bring me something I cannot define
Feels like a river is flowing inside
You're my reflection, no, I won't deny
When I'm all in, I won't leave your side

I want you to stay, I want you to stay near
Bring me your company to keep me warm
Lie down with me, lie down with me now
In the morning, the lights will fade out

In the morning, the lights will fade out
Fade out
In the morning, the lights will fade out
Fade out

In your heart when you're with me
Far apart when you're gone
In your heart when you're with me
Far apart when you're gone

In the morning, the lights will fade out

In your heart when you're with me (yeah)
Far apart when you're gone (yeah)
In your heart when you're with me (yeah)
Far apart when you're gone

I want you to stay, I want you to stay near
Bring me your company to keep me warm
Lie down with me, lie down with me now
In the morning, the lights will fade out

In the morning, the lights will fade out
Fade out
In the morning, the lights will fade out
Fade out
