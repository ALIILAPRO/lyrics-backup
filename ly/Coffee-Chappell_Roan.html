		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can't meet you for dinner at the Italian place
It's where I met your family, some words were exchanged
I'd suggest the jazz bar on MaryAnn Street but
You'd buy me a drink and we know where that leads, so

I'll meet you for coffee 'cause if we have wine
You'll say that you want me, I know that's a lie
If I didn't love you, it would be fine
I'll meet you for coffee, only for coffee
Nowhere else is safe, every place leads back to your place

You said let's do the park 'cause I love the park
That may be true but god forbid it gets dark
Here come the excuses that fuel the illusions
But I'd rather feel something than nothing at all, so

I'll meet you for coffee 'cause if we have wine
You'll say that you're sorry, I know that's a lie
If I didn't trust you, it would be fine
I'll meet you for coffee, only for coffee
Nowhere else is safe, every place leads back to your-

We've done this before
And I don't need it anymore

So let's not do coffee, let's not even try
It's better we leave it and give it some time
If I didn't love you, it would be fine
'Cause If we do coffee, it's never just coffee
It's never just coffee
