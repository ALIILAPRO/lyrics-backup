		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  East of the sun and west of the moon
We'll build a dream house of love, dear
Near to the sun in the day
Near to the moon at night
We'll live in a lovely way, dear

Living our love at pale moonlight
Just you and I, forever and a day
Love will not die, we'll keep it that way

Up among the stars we'll find
A harmony of life to a lovely tune
East of the sun and west of the moon, dear
East of the sun and west of the moon

Just you and I, forever and a day
Love will not die, we'll keep it that way

Up among the stars we'll find
A harmony of life to a lovely tune
East of the sun and west of the moon, dear
East of the sun and west of the moon
