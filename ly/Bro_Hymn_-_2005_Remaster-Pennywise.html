		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  To all my friends present, past and beyond
Especially those who weren't with us too long
Life is the most precious thing you can lose
While you were here the fun was never ending
Laugh a minute was only beginning
Canton, Colvin, Nichols, this one's for you

Ever get the feeling you can't go on
Just remember whose side it is that you're on
You've got friends with you 'til the end
If you're ever in a tough situation
We'll be there with no hesitation
Brotherhood's our rule we cannot bend

When you're feeling too close to the bottom
You know who it is you can count on
Someone will pick you up again
We can conquer anything together
All of us are bonded forever
If I die, you die that's the way it is

To all my friends, present past and beyond
To all those who weren't with us too long
Life is the most precious thing you can lose
While you were here the fun was never ending
Laugh a minute was only the beginning
Canton, Colvin, Nichols, this one's for you
