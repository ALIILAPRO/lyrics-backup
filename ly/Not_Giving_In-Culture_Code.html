		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Is this what giving up feels like?
I don't know, I don't know
Tell me, have I lost my mind? Nowhere to go
So far from home
Is this what giving up feels like?
I don't know, I don't know
Tell me, have I lost my mind?
So I break these walls
And hold my head up high
And I'm scared my blinding to the day I die
As a rain falls down
There's no one to survive, to survive
So I break these walls
And hold my head up high
No, I'm not giving in

No, I'm not giving in
No, I'm not giving in, in, in, in, in

No, I'm not giving in giving in
No, I'm not giving in giving in
No, I'm not giving in

No, I'm not giving in
No, I'm not giving in

No, I'm not giving in
No, I'm not giving in
No, I'm not giving in
No, I'm not giving in

No, I'm not giving in
