		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You always knew how to creep into my head
Always finding ways to sleep in my bed
You have always kept me hypnotized
You will never have the key to my heart
Pay attention to the things that I said
I had told you I was sick of crying
When you gave me promises of paradise 
Then took them back again before my eyes

Here we go, at it again you see 
This position is not for me 
And it just wasn't meant to be 
The decision is mine to leave you 

So I've grown so tired of the mind games you play
So warm in the night yet so cold in the day

You always knew how to creep into my head
Always finding ways to sleep in my bed
You have always kept me hypnotized
You will never have the key to my heart
Pay attention to the things that I said
I had told you I was sick of crying
When you gave me promises of paradise 
Then took them back again before my eyes

Here we go, at it again you see 
This position is not for me 
And it just wasn't meant to be 
The decision is mine to leave you 

So I've seen the light and I'm moving along
It never was right and I'm done with your wrong

I've grown so tired of the mind games you play
So warm in the night yet so cold in the day

You always knew how to creep into my head
Always finding ways to sleep in my bed
You have always kept me hypnotized
You will never have the key to my heart
Pay attention to the things that I said
I had told you I was sick of crying
When you gave me promises of paradise 
Then took them back again before my eyes

You always knew how to creep into my head
Always finding ways to sleep in my bed
You have always kept me hypnotized
You will never have the key to my heart
Pay attention to the things that I said
I had told you I was sick of crying
When you gave me promises of paradise 
Then took them back again before my eyes
