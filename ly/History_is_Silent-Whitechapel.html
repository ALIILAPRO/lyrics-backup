		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The noise of a memory will fade and the silence of history will stay
Another day wishing to find myself with both feet in my grave
My darker thoughts are born again
It's not ok to have a knife in your chest and still be able to breathe
When will the air not feel so cold
 
And I dread December
I crave the summer days when we were young
But summer came with more of the same
The same old song that cuts so deep
It's sad to say, I crave my grave
 
Dead and gone
But my wounds still bleed the same
And I just won't die
I've tried everything but I feel no pain
As my body swings
I still feel the cold air rushing through my lungs
History is a silence that's so deafening
 
Misery how beautiful you look tonight in this shallow grave
It's not deep enough
What's it like to be where the grass is always green
Remind me, I can't remember
 
The noise will fade and the history will stay forever
 
And I dread December
I crave the summer days when we were young
But summer came with more of the same
The same old song that cuts so deep
It's sad to say, I crave my grave
Put me in my grave
Put me in my grave
My Grave

Dead and gone
But my wounds still bleed the same
And I just won't die
I've tried everything but I feel no pain
As my body swings
I still feel the cold air rushing through my lungs
History is a silence that's so deafening
