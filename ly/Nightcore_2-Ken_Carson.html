		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah

The way she move, the way that she move, the way that she move
The way she move, the way that she move, the way that she move
The way that she move, the way that she move, the way that she move
The way that she move, the way that she move, the way that she move
I think I'm fallin' in love with you
Fendi, Gucci, Prada, anything for you
Balenciaga, yeah, yeah, on her boot
AR-15, on me right now, I'm ready to shoot

Yeah, I'm ready to shoot
Yeah, I'm ready to go
They say he had that bread and then we turned him into toast
I fuck on these hoes with the same energy I rock these shows with
And I ain't never gotta reload because I'm always overloaded
Lil' boy, you so broke, you better sell your soul 'cause you ain't ever sold shit
I'm always catchin' plays, ayy, ayy, just like a goalie
Chrome Hearts on my wrist, ayy, this a Rollie
BD, BD, bust down, this bitch frozen
Like a wide receiver, I had your ho wide open
Hell nah, I don't need her, I just want her for the moment
If you ain't ready to die 'bout me right now, leave me alone then
I be locked out, huh, and I be zoned in
I mean I be locked in and zoned out
I meant to text you back, huh, but I forgot
If I wanted to see her face, I would have flew her out
I'm havin' birds in the trap, I feel like Travis Scott
Yeah, the way lil' shawty movin', huh, I can't believe my eyes
She ain't got no waist but she got perfect titties and some thighs
I don't know if I want her or her right now, I can't decide
They said if you lyin' then you flyin', bitch, I'm fly
Yeah, lil' bitch, I'm fly, yeah, look up in the sky, yeah
It's not a plane, it's not a bird
It's X-Man, bitch, fuck what ya heard
I'm on cloud nine right now, that's why my words slurred
If niggas try me and my gang, yeah, yeah, we ready to purge
The way lil' shawty movin', yeah, yeah, I need her
The way lil' shawty movin', huh, she got me lost for words
And I don't know what's worse, my ambitions or my grim thoughts about her
She asked me why my cross upside down, I told her I'm cursed (cursed)

The way she move, the way that she move, the way that she move
The way she move, the way that she move, the way that she move
The way that she move, the way that she move, the way that she move
The way that she move, the way that she move, the way that she move
I think I'm fallin' in love with you
Fendi, Gucci, Prada, anything for you
Balenciaga, yeah, yeah, on her boot
AR-15, on me right now, I'm ready to shoot
