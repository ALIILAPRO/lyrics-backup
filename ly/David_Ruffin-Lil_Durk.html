You ever woke up out your sleep like is you gon' die in the trenches?
You ever thought it'd be your dawg when they described the witness?
I wrote a letter to authorities when they threw out the tenants
To claim that shit that bronem claim, you know that shit a privilege
For Pat I'll throw them tears, I remember the night they took him
I treat them hoes with a lil' respect 'cause that could be my sister
They had gave police them guns, when they pulled up, they booked 'em
We catch a opp, he get baptized like I was never Muslim
Like wipe your nose, I love you, bro, stop fuckin' with Ashton Kutcher
Funeral home be extortin' me 'cause I be paying for bookings
Won't send no hunchos to the county 'cause you be paying for pussy
Could've went to college, but instead I'm in this van with hoodlums

And that shit all facts
I tried to give my dawg a pound but he want all crack
Like fuck the feds, you threaten my kids, I'm gettin' 'em all whacked
I spent like ninety on a Cuban, that shit prong set
Most of them OG's get out the feds, they know they all rats, nigga
All these niggas tryna live my life
They don't know what I go through
They ain't gon' do what they supposed to

I had to get it out that mud 'cause we was pain and suffering
And we was stuck inside the hood, we mix our Percs with 'Tussin
I know a killer got in that jam, we call him David Ruffin
And they didn't even use his statement, so he sang for nothing
They had a bitch up on that case but she the lamest bustin'
I fucked her but she still showed up at court, I came for nothing
I appreciate my war scars, show me I came from nothin'
My daddy got back off that L, like who get life for hustlin'?
I'm still a voice inside the trenches, don't make me say it again
DJ playin' the opps inside this club, he better not play it again
See dissin' me and go OT gon' get your hood shot
I can tell the streets what I been through just off my mugshots

And that shit all facts
I tried to give my dawg a pound but he want all crack
Like fuck the feds, you threaten my kids, I'm gettin' 'em all whacked
I spent like ninety on a Cuban, that shit prong set
Most of them OG's get out the feds, they know they all rats, nigga
All these niggas tryna live my life
They don't know what I go through
They ain't gon' do what they supposed to
