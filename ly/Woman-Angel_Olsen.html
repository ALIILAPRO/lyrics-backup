		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You can leave now if you want to
I'll still be around
This parade is almost over
And I'm still your clown

I've been thinking
How your smile seems to last forever
Even if it's just a while
We are there together
There together

With no promise of the future
Am I not allowed
To think kindly of a stranger
Who reflects the sound
Of my heartache
As it's beating
My life to the ground
To the ground
To the ground
To the ground
To the ground

And I could still breathe for you
Open up and scream for you
Tell me what I wouldn't do
Tell me that love isn't true
Tell me that love isn't true
Tell me that love isn't true

I dare you to understand
What makes me a woman
What makes me a woman
What makes me a woman

I'd do anything
To see it all
The way that you do

I'd do anything
To see it all
The way that you do

But I'd be lying
Baby
But I'd be lying to you
