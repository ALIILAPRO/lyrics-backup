		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  Ooh-ooh-ooh, ta-ra, uh-uh-uh, ta-ra, ooh-ooh-ooh, yummy, yummy
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ta-ra, uh-uh-uh, ta-ra, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

Those hungry eyes
Tracing my body lines
All night, baby, you can't hide
Got a sweet tooth, wishing I could feed you, mm

Got-got that cinnamon, cinnamon pie
Watch it dripping down, down my thigh
Ain't no innocent, innocent mind
In this club tonight

I know you want my body
Baby, I'll give you one more taste
Don't rush and take it slowly
Can eat it all in just one day
I got a lot of sugar
That's what you get when you eat cake
I know you want my body
Want body, baby, you say

Ooh-ooh-ooh, ta-ra, uh-uh-uh, ta-ra, ooh-ooh-ooh, yummy, yummy
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ta-ra, uh-uh-uh, ta-ra, ooh-ooh-ooh, yummy, yummy
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ta-ra, uh-uh-uh, ta-ra, ooh-ooh-ooh, yummy, yummy
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ta-ra, uh-uh-uh, ta-ra, ooh-ooh-ooh, yummy, yummy

Emergency
All night long you can eat
Not talkin' 'bout su-sushi
Make your heart's keep getting on this to this, mm

Got-got that cinnamon, cinnamon pie
Watch it dripping down, down my thigh
Ain't no innocent, innocent mind
In this club tonight

I know you want my body
Baby, I'll give you one more taste
Don't rush and take it slowly
Can't eat it all in just one day
I got a lot of sugar
That's what you get when you eat cake
I know you want my body
Want body, baby, you say

Ooh-ooh-ooh, ta-ra, uh-uh-uh, ta-ra, ooh-ooh-ooh, yummy, yummy
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ta-ra, uh-uh-uh, ta-ra, ooh-ooh-ooh, yummy, yummy
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ta-ra, uh-uh-uh, ta-ra, ooh-ooh-ooh, yummy, yummy
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ta-ra, uh-uh-uh, ta-ra, ooh-ooh-ooh, yummy, yummy

Ooh-ooh-ooh, ta-ra, uh-uh-uh, ta-ra, ooh-ooh-ooh, yummy, yummy
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ta-ra, uh-uh-uh, ta-ra, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

Yummy, yummy
I know you want my body
Baby, I'll give you one more taste
Don't rush and take it slowly
Can't eat it all in just one day
I got a lot of sugar
That's what you get when you eat cake
I know you want my body
Want body, baby, you say

Ooh-ooh-ooh, ta-ra, uh-uh-uh, ta-ra, ooh-ooh-ooh, yummy, yummy
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ta-ra, uh-uh-uh, ta-ra, ooh-ooh-ooh, yummy, yummy
