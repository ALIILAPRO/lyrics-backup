		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wait,
Feels like we were moving on 
Scars you left are barely gone
But all that changed
Second you walked in the room
You hate this place, so why you here alone? 

There's no way to hide it anymore 
Cause the bottle your holding
Slipped now it's broken 
Look at you through pieces on the floor 
There's no point in acting 
Cause it's all in the fractures

You & me
We got history
Are we meant to be?
But our chemistry's 
Slippery 
Bitter sweet
Grit my teeth
Fuck it 
If we fall across that line 
Would we be different this time? 
You & me
We got history
Are we meant to be?

Here,
Washing my head out in the sink
Why do I have to overthink?
Does that mean I'm not over it?
For you
Are you really done with me?
Or will our history repeat?

There's no way to hide it anymore 
Cause the bottle your holding
It slipped now it's broken 
Look at you through pieces on the floor 
There's no point in acting 
Cause it's all in the fractures

You & me
We got history
Are we meant to be?
But our chemistry's 
Slippery 
Bitter sweet
Grit my teeth
Fuck it 
If we fall across that line 
Would we be different this time? 
You & me
We got history
Are we meant to be?
