		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  2020 was a goddamn joke, least that what it felt like
Had a lot of motherfuckers showing true colors
Had to tighten up the belt right (Tighten up the belt)
When you hit the bottom you can see the top, Heaven and Hell like
Lost a lot of good people didn't get the flowers, couldn't tell 'em what they smelled like
I don't want to be a pessimist, I'm just tryna keep it G when I'm expressing it
Man it's beautiful when entering the element
And I militate a battle like a regiment (Goddamn)
We are not existing here to be so desolate
Man the way this shit is going, need a therapist
If I may I might contend you I'm a specialist
Stomping through this motherfucker, breaking sediment (Nigga huh?)
I'm incapable of settling
I done worked too hard to let the fucking Devil in
It ain't really hard to see what my impression is
Jealousy is something that ain't never prejudice
Some people hate the way you moving and progressing in
Ain't nothing when you moving Mountain Everest
I'ma give it where it's due, so where my credit is?
I ain't folding, that's just how my whole genetics is

Now, now that your circle getting small
I am, I am so appalled, I'ma try to put it simply (Damn)
And now I'm feeling certain I was called by the fucking rap gods
They applaud him for the wizardry (Goddamn nigga)
Generally speaking, dominating every season
I'll be chiefing, I'm on of some of that dispensary
Shit is like a fucking documentary
Thou shalt protect thine energy
Now, now that your circle getting small
I am, I am so appalled, I'ma try to put it simply (Yes sir)
And now I'm feeling certain I was called by the fucking rap gods
They applaud him for the wizardry (Y'all know what it is)
Generally speaking, dominating every season
I'll be chiefing, I'm on of some of that dispensary
Shit is like a fucking documentary
Thou shalt protect thine energy

Okay I had to take a quick breather
Me and Holliday been bobbing, man this shit's heater (Shit's mad)
Baby I be going live, I'm a big streamer
Fucking through it every time through the sick speaker
Okay I had to take this shit deeper
I be jumping for it all I'm a big leaper
I just let it come to me, lil' boy you been eager
You claiming Joey ain't the shit, you niggas been tweakers (Nigga, huh?)
Twitter fingers, you a big tweeter
Y'all been reaching with a shovel tell 'em dig deeper
Narcoleptic on a nigga, man y'all been sleepers
A lot of people with some clout that I done been featured
I done told you if you fucking with me mentally
I ain't finna send it back what you done sent to me
Y'all know me and I'm a preacher so religiously
I'm too involved, I'm protecting all my energy
I will build real slow and the rap's gon' blow
On the map I know, got my hat real low (Goddamn)
And the mask on bro, and the bat don't show
Where I'm at lil' bro? Circle back lil' hoe
Uh, too trill, I'ma kill, kill, kill
Fucking pew, pew, pew on a blood sucking leech, nigga
Coattail on the real, real, real
You done built, built, built something that they can't take, nigga

Now, now that your circle getting small
I am, I am so appalled, I'ma try to put it simply
And now I'm feeling certain I was called by the fucking rap gods
They applaud him for the wizardry (Goddamn)
Generally speaking, dominating every season
I'll be chiefing, I'm on of some of that dispensary
Shit is like a fucking documentary
Thou shalt protect thine energy
Now, now that your circle getting small
I am, I am so appalled, I'ma try to put it simply (Ah)
And now I'm feeling certain I was called by the fucking rap gods
They applaud him for the wizardry (Oh Goddamn)
Generally speaking, dominating every season
I'll be chiefing, I'm on of some of that dispensary (Wooh)
Shit is like a fucking documentary
Thou shalt protect thine energy
