		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Okay, so I literally just listened to it
And I love it, I love that second verse
And everything else you put in it
Like oh my god
Afta

I roll the woods and I light that shit
She like "Why the black shades?" my future bright as shit
And if she let me hit the high note, I’ll bite that shit
I guess I’m different and I like that shit
I said I like that shit

Yeah, I said I like that shit
I know I’m fly, not like those guys you sharing flight paths with
Circle the skies and find my target, then I snipe that shit
Fucking disgusting in your ears, I never type that shit
Yeah, not the type to fall easy
Every week I’m spreading different cheeks
So when I sit to speak she gon read me
And she don’t even believe me
I don’t believe her when she said she needs me
She only hit me past 7 or 8, when her heavenly gates dropping dead And away
And the demon in me get to squeezing
I get to pleasing
(Hold up, keep it lowkey)
Tell me the reason
Motherfucker get to scheming
Fuck a deal I got my freedom
Fuck a three I hit a threesome
Turning like Gilbert Arenas
Fuck a game, I win the season
Visions of filling arenas
Oh Oh
Yeah

I roll the woods and I light that shit
She like "Why the black shades?" my future bright as shit
And if she let me hit the high note, I’ll bite that shit
I guess I’m different and I like that shit
I said I like that shit

Yeah-yeah, Mmm
Supreme visions of these bitches
Just because I’d rather not think machine codes control decisions
My intuitions said credit limits could let me get it
But get indebted to moneylenders and then forget it
But shit forget it
(I roll the woods and I-)
Mmmm
(I told you to keep it lowkey)
They don't wanna hear you talk money and hoes
Then when they talk sometimes it gets to my dome
Fuck it I'm letting you know
Money stays rising in pressure, I'm cooking the dough
And even your favorite artists wanna cook up some beats with your boy
Man you already know
Ohh
Yeah
(ooo)


I roll the woods and I light that shit
She like "Why the black shades?" my future bright as shit
And if she let me hit the high note, I’ll bite that shit
I guess I’m different and I like that shit
I said I like that shit
(It)
