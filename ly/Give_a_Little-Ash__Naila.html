		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been walking on roads
'Till I found myself walking
I'm walking alone

Walking to find
Walking to find that kind 
Of piece of mind

And it's been days I wait 
I wait to see you smiling 
And it's been days I wait 
I wait to see you smiling 

So give a little piece of your love
Give a little piece of your heartache
Give a little piece of your touch
Give a little piece of your heartbreak 

So give a little piece of your love
Give a little piece of your heartache
Give a little piece of your touch
Give a little piece of your heartbreak 

I'm walking higher
Walking alone in the road
I caught on fire

You brought me down
Brought me in and around 
You brought me higher

And it's been days I wait 
I wait to see you smiling
And it's been days I wait 
I wait to see you smiling

So give a little piece of your love
Give a little piece of your heartache
Give a little piece of your touch
Give a little piece of your heartbreak 

So give a little piece of your love
Give a little piece of your heartache (And what you need I don't know)
Give a little piece of your touch
Give a little piece of your heartbreak (And what you need I don't know)
