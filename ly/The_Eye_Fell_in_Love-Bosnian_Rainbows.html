		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The eye, the eye, the eye fell in love
With the man, the man, the man dressed in black
The leg, the leg, the leg wanted to
Kiss the man, the man, the man dressed in blood

Tell me, where is all the pain left in this world?

The eye, the eye, the eye fell in love
With the man, the man, the man dressed in black
The eye, the eye, the eye fell in love
Kiss the man, the man, the man dressed in blood

Tell me, where is all the pain left in this world?

The eye, the eye, the eye fell in love with the letter S, O, U, L

I fell for the golden stare, time has kept me away, away from you
I fell for the golden stare, future once held by us is left, is left alone

And she, she fell in love with ocean sands
No one could believe this man would love her back again
