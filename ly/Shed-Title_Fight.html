		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're cold
Like the blood that runs through your veins
I've been told
There's a black spot next to your name
You can't seem to erase
Shed your skin, change your face
But you're all the same
You're all the same

Shed your skin
Find a better body to fit in

I've lost track
Of all the times you betrayed
I've lost faith
In the friendships I have made
Drag you down and put you in your place
But shed your skin, change your face

Shed your skin
Find a better body to fit in
Shed your skin
Find a better body to fit in
