		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Rah, it's BKay, unah?)

Back streets, gotta move lowkey
Cah one wrong move and I might get done
Before I thought 'bout going A Jewellers
Stupid, I thought 'bout buying a gun
Got one on my left and she brown like Henny
The one on my right is white like rum
I'm telling my bro don't quit
Put in the work and your time will come
They're lying on us
We ain't from the road, apparently and we ain't on none
Can't style on us
I don't need no Rollie, I'm still gon' buss
My old man told me, "Quiet your noise
You don't gotta kick up a fuss"
Trigger finger, click it and buss
Dinger whip with the stiffest clutch

Bando, kway, no reception
Bad B stressed, I don't show her attention
We don't ever go to no restaurants
Cinema date, she don't know that tension
I'm in the deep end, no lengthen
Give me that real deepthroat, no Lemsip
Tempted, tempted
Who's got a mash?
New plates cah the dots too vintage

Bando, kway, no reception
Bad B stressed, I don't show her attention
We don't ever go to no restaurants
Cinema date, she don't know that tension
I'm in the deep end, no lengthen
Give me that real deepthroat, no Lemsip
Tempted, tempted
Who's got a mash?
New plates cah the dots too vintage

Wadz went half on my studio time
Them times all I had was a ten sheet
They showed me love when my belly was empty
Bare red eye, now they jelly, they envy
Envy, pree my Givenchy
They didn't think that I had it in me
Harry wan' pin-up Pinero
I gave him a chunk of the dark, no Filly
Just left, she sent me a text
She miss me already, bae, don't be silly
My baby think that she know everything
So I don't need Siri
As a pickney, I didn't watch Disney
Channel, my telly didn't have that many
Somedays dinner Nutella and bread
Nowadays it's the tagliatelle

Bando, kway, no reception
Bad B stressed, I don't show her attention
We don't ever go to no restaurants
Cinema date, she don't know that tension
I'm in the deep end, no lengthen
Give me that real deepthroat, no Lemsip
Tempted, tempted
Who's got a mash?
New plates cah the dots too vintage

Bando, kway, no reception
Bad B stressed, I don't show her attention
We don't ever go to no restaurants
Cinema date, she don't know that tension
I'm in the deep end, no lengthen
Give me that real deepthroat, no Lemsip
Tempted, tempted
Who's got a mash?
New plates cah the dots too vintage

Bro had to fling on a tracky
Couldn't disguise this ting in his slim fits
Big ZK on waist, now he's limping
Stay with my darg, my darg like Tin Tin
Come up off hard cocaine not pimpin'
Bad B nearly had man simpin'
Lost my mind like what was I thinkin'?
Way too wet, nearly had man sinkin'
Came home, OT, I was stinkin'
After my shower, I'm back in a dusty trap
Felt sorry for boss when I bumped that cab
But I got no choice, I'm sorry, my bad
One day I'll pay mumsy back
For the times that I had my fam going mad
Tell the council that we don't need that flat
They can take that back
Got a brand new gaff

Bando, kway, no reception
Bad B stressed, I don't show her attention
We don't ever go to no restaurants
Cinema date, she don't know that tension
I'm in the deep end, no lengthen
Give me that real deepthroat, no Lemsip
Tempted, tempted
Who's got a mash?
New plates cah the dots too vintage (Rah, it's BKay, unah?)

Bando, kway, no reception
Bad B stressed, I don't show her attention
We don't ever go to no restaurants
Cinema date, she don't know that tension
I'm in the deep end, no lengthen
Give me that real deepthroat, no Lemsip
Tempted, tempted
Who's got a mash?
New plates cah the dots too vintage
