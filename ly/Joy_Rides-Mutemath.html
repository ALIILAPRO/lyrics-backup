		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It all went wrong today
We'll dream the night away
And maybe there's a trace
Of a brighter side
Cause if we're out of those
It's over I suppose
So smile

[Chorus:]
Let your tears fall off tonight
Joy rides on the sun
Everything will be alright
Joy rides on the sun
There's a new spark in the sky
Mornings gonna come
Let your tears fall off tonight
Joy rides on the sun

Give me the sad news first
Cause the good news is probably worse
My feelings don't get hurt anymore
It's always do or die
And I don't have the time
So smile

Let your tears fall off tonight
Joy rides on the sun
Everything will be alright
Joy rides on the sun
There's a new spark in the sky
Mornings gonna come
Let your tears fall off tonight
Joy rides on the sun

Hold on
The world is our merry-go-round
Hold on
The world is our merry-go-round
Hold on
The world is our merry-go-round
Hold on
The world is our merry-go-round
Hold on
The world is our merry-go-round
Hold on
The world is our merry-go-round

Let your tears fall off tonight
Joy rides on the sun
Everything will be alright
Joy rides on the sun
There's a new spark in the sky
Mornings gonna come
Let your tears fall off tonight
Joy rides on the sun
