		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There was Christ in the metal shell
There was blood on the pavement
The camera will make you God
That's how Jack became sainted

If you die when there's no one watching
Then your ratings drop and your forgotten
If they kill you on their T.V.
You're a martyr and a lamb of God

Nothing is gonna change
Nothing is gonna change 
The world

There was Lennon in the happy gun
There were words on the pavement
We were looking for the lamb of god
We were looking for Mark David

If you die when there's no one watching
Then your ratings drop and your forgotten
If they kill you on their T.V.
You're a martyr and a lamb of God

Nothing is gonna change the world
Nothing is gonna change
Nothing is gonna change the world
Nothing is gonna change 
The world

It took three days for him to die
The born again to buy the serial rights
Lamb of God have mercy on us
Lamb of God will you grant us

Nothing is gonna change the world
Nothing is gonna change
Nothing is gonna change the world
Nothing is gonna change 
Nothing is gonna change the world
Nothing is gonna change
Nothing is gonna change the world
Nothing is gonna change 
The world

If you die when there's no one watching
Then your ratings drop and your forgotten
But if they kill you on their T.V.
You're a martyr and a lamb of God

Nothing is gonna change 
The world
