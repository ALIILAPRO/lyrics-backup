		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (This-this is Jay P Bangz)

Butterfly setting just to cover up my scars, nigga
Sharpen up the instrument soon as we touched the yard, nigga
Gang, and that's dependent, they can't keep them boys apart, nigga
Yeah, there go them Bompton and Oak Park niggas
Everybody eat, catch a body, you gon' starve, nigga
Claimin' everybody, you gon' know we was involved, nigga
Pull up in somethin' brazy, push a button, it's gon' start, nigga
Yeah, there go them Bompton and Oak Park niggas (yeah, ayy)

Four-hundred chains hang as I gang bang
Same nigga with the thirsty's, bitch, I ain't change
Down to ride, Piru Blood, that's the same thing
I know some villains, know their families and the Bid Gang (Brr)
Nigga, I'm un-fuck-with-able, I bet there tinner fold
Turn around and hit 'em both, bitch, I'm out to get the dope
Two brand new Glock .9's, they identical
Thought he got hit by one blick, but he got hit with both
Through the ride, I missed you thugs, just know a nigga with you, Blood
100k for the lawyer fee, that's how I send my love
That's still my thug, hold it down, I'm with you Blood
Bompton Pirus, make sure it's chunky when you throw it up

Butterfly setting just to cover up my scars, nigga
Sharpen up an instrument soon as we touched the yard, nigga
Gang, and that's dependent, they can't keep them boys apart, nigga
Yeah, there go them Bompton and Oak Park niggas
Everybody eat, catch a body, you gon' starve, nigga
Claimin' everybody, you gon' know we was involved, nigga
Pull up in somethin' brazy, push a button, it's gon' start, nigga
Yeah, there go them Bompton and Oak Park niggas

Dumbing since a youngin' taught you power in my voucher (Yeah)
Really go and tell you how I'm 4th without a doubt (Doubt)
And I lay down 12th for hella years, you know the route (12th)
And I put in work for 33rd, watch your mouth
Green stole the slimy like 18 throughout the drought (Huh)
Temple full of killers, I 'member Charlise' house (Yeah)
I was F-A-B-in', and when flinchin' they knock you out
When Zenni was sellin' ounces for Taco and Rico went down
I prefer to die on Pebble Beach if I'ma drown
Move to Oak Park B if lil' Tim and 'em wasn't 'round
Bang in peace to Ray, we name the block after that child
Know you out there smilin' through that shit that make you proud

Butterfly setting just to cover up my scars, nigga
Sharpen up an instrument soon as we touched the yard, nigga
Gang, and that's dependent, they can't keep them boys apart, nigga
Yeah, there go them Bompton and Oak Park niggas
Everybody eat, catch a body, you gon' starve, nigga
Claimin' everybody, you gon' know we was involved, nigga
Pull up in somethin' brazy, push a button, it's gon' start, nigga
Yeah, there go them Bompton and Oak Park niggas (yeah, ayy)

As the pandemic continues
Gang activity is spiking throughout Sacramento
And now to a developing story in Compton
Where the murder rate is up twenty-five percent here to date
The pandemic had led to increased gang activity
According to LAPD officials, with one Compton resident saying
Quote, "the streets are on fire"
