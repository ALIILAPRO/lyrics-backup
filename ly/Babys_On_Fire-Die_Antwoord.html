		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby's on fire

Boom, boom boom
It's show time, motherfucker, it's on
Apocalypse now, I'm dropping this bomb
You can't fuck with this song
I stick to this spliff I'm not clampin this bong

I'm a wild child, I don't wanna go to bed
Uh shit sorry man I'm stoned again
Aooooh and now everything's getting so psychedelic
When I'm doos dronk and forget all my fuckin lyrics
Like umm ah who gives a fuck?
Don't worry bout it just blow a kiss to me

I like danger I mean it's a mystery
I'm a lucky ducky gettin' mad shit for free
I rap more bling than Mr. T
I make it look easy 'cos it is to me
My daddy says is like a to see
A South African cherrie makin' history

Baby's on fire
She got me going fuckin crazy since

O jirre god se jesus

Baby's on fire
She got me going fuckin crazy since

O jirre god se Jesus

Baby's on fire

Hi-Tek drop that four to the floor
I get real paid what you think I do this for
My bodyguard help me get to the bar
Niell Blomkamp's making me a movie star
A lotta bad boys want a piece of me
If you're lucky boy, I'll let you sneak a peek
My Zef-style's motherfuckin' freaky-deak
I don't want beef 'cos I don't eat no meat
Fuck your whole shit up when I freak the beat
I love it when Jimmy talks sweet to me
I take a trip down memory lane
Like, yo fuck fifteen seconds of fame
I'm a young blood coming up fresh in the game
Yo-landi Visser, motherfucker yo remember the name

Baby's on fire
She got me going fuckin crazy
O jirre god se jesus

Baby's on fire
She got me going from
O jirre god se jesus

Baby's on fire

Ah, freak out!
No need to get so deep, notin quite like a motherfuckin techno beat
A techno beat, A techno beat a techno a techno a techno beat
You know me, maar ek ken jou nie

Ek ken jou nie, ek ken jou nie, ek ken jou, ken jou, ken jou nie

Baby's on fire

Baby's on fire
She got me going from
O jirre god se Jesus

Baby's on fire
She got me going from
O jirre god se Jesus

Baby's on fire
Flame on, motherfuckers
