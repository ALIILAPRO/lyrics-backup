		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  War, war is coming with me
Our only hope is tearing down the foundation of angelic sounds
Lord, lord forgive this troubled man
He comes for what he lost and he'll take every life until he's found
 
Wipe your tears my dear sweet elder
Compulsion is inherited, compassion can mend a broken man
But I'm beyond the point of the love you send
I have an urge to taste blood on my tongue
A passion to watch the whole world burn
The innocent child you once knew is dead, he's dead
 
So long, throw me to the wolves
I'm a lost cause drowning in the weight I pull
I'm way too deep in the thought of making my life miserable
Don't dwell on a worthless life, we exist in a different light
The ancient blood calls out my name

War, war is coming with me
Our only hope is tearing down the foundation of angelic sounds
Lord, lord forgive this troubled man
He comes for what he lost and he'll take every life until he's found
 
Peace be with you all
I'm a neglected memory you never saw
The abyss will take me now to where I belong

So long, throw me to the wolves
I'm a lost cause drowning in the weight I pull
I'm way too deep in the thought of making my life miserable
Don't dwell on a worthless life, we exist in a different light
The ancient blood calls out my name
 
This is the end of me
I tried so hard to keep it together
But I'm lost without them
So long, so long misery

War, war is coming with me
Our only hope is tearing down the foundation of angelic sounds
Lord, lord forgive this troubled man
He comes for what he lost and he'll take every life until he's found
 
We are free from the grasp of the earth
And into the void of the universe
So long, so long to our misery
