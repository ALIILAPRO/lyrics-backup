		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah

World goes round, life I chose
What comes next I never really know
A million miles left to go,
Them guns go pow, but I'm ready for the war!
'Cause I'll never run away,
From who knocking at my door
I never paid attention to whoever tells me no
I'll take your crown, take your town
Better stay ready, better stay ready
If the sky start falling now
And the World stop turning 'round
Oh yeah, did you give your everything?
You better give your everything!

'Cause if you wanna ride with me
Oh yeah, make me come alive baby
Oh yeah, so if you wanna ride with me
Oh yeah, if you wanna ride with me
Show me how bad do you want it?
How bad do you want it?

Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
How bad do you?

Coming for it all, going for the gold
Hot behind the wheel, I'll never lose control
Sun go down, the night unfold
Run free & wild, do anything I want!
'Cause I'll never run away,
From who knocking at my door
I never paid attention to whoever tells me no
I'll take your crown, take your town
Better stay ready, better stay ready
If the sky start falling now
And the World stop turning 'round
Oh yeah, did you give your everything?
You better give your everything!

'Cause if you wanna ride with me
Oh yeah, make me come alive baby
Oh yeah, so if you wanna ride with me
Oh yeah, if you wanna ride with me
Show me how bad do you want it?
How bad do you want it?

Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
How bad do you?

Better show me now
Before your time run out
Better show me
Before your time run out
Show me how bad do you want it?
How bad do you want it?
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
How bad do you want it?
