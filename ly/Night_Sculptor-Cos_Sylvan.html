		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Were I to write myself
Que Sera, whatever is hell

My sinner sighs through white wax teeth
And there's grease stains where his hands have been

Out under a glassy eye, patterned on
The moon in the summer sky
Hung around my neck
I want to take it off

Come alone
It's pride that owns the night here
The light is old, it keeps me close
And without fear

With eyes like cut stained glass
He'll bite your tongue
And drink your past

Out under a glassy eye, patterned on
The moon in the summer sky
Hung around my neck
I want to take it off

Come alone
It's pride that owns the night here
The light is old, it keeps me close
And without fear

Come alone
It's pride that owns the night here
The light is old, it keeps me close
And without fear
Let him draw you out
And cast doubt on everything
He'll laugh with his hands nailed down
