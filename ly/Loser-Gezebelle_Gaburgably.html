		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm such a fucking loser
Cause I don't see the point
In leaving behind my toys
And spending a life employed
I'm such a fucking loser
I just get to have fun
If you don't get to have fun
Then what's the point it just seems dumb
Nothing in life is guaranteed
If I'm a loser I agree
If I'm a loser let me be
I went to forage
Deep in the forest
It's what feels right and what I like naturally
We weren't meant to feel agony
We're just meant to live happily and
Adventure through the world
But there's graphs and tax and girls
Nothing ever goes my way
It's likely that you'd say the same
There's no way out
You could quit, or die, or drop out
But then you would shout
I'm such a fucking loser
Cause I don't see the point
In leaving behind my toys
and spending a life employed
I'm such a fucking loser
I just get to have fun
If you don't get to have fun
Then what's the point, it just seems dumb
