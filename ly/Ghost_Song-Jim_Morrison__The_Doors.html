		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Awake
Shake dreams from your hair
My pretty child, my sweet one
Choose the day and choose the sign of your day
The day's divinity
First thing you see

A vast radiant beach and cooled jeweled moon
Couples naked race down by its quiet side
And we laugh like soft, mad children
Smug in the woolly cotton brains of infancy
The music and voices are all around us

Choose they croon the ancient ones
The time has come again
Choose now, they croon
Beneath the moon
Beside an ancient lake

Enter again the sweet forest
Enter the hot dream
Come with us
Everything is broken up and dances

Indians scattered on Dawn's Highway bleeding
Ghosts crowd the young child's
Fragile eggshell mind

We have assembled inside
This ancient and insane theater
To propagate our lust for life
And flee the swarming wisdom of the streets

The barns have stormed
The windows kept
And only one of all the rest
To dance and save us
From divine mockery of words
Music inflames temperament

Oh, great creator of being
Grant us one more hour
To perform our art and perfect our lives

We need great golden copulations

When the true king's murderers
Are allowed to roam free
A thousand magicians arise in the land

Where are the feast were promised?
