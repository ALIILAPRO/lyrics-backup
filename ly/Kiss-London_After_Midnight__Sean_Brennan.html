		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You'll never understand
The meaning in the end
We're standing at the gate
You'll meet the darker fate

Your purity and rage
Your passion and your hate
You promised more than bliss
With your God and with your kiss

I'm on my knees
I beg your mercy
My soul is my loss
I'm well hung from your cross

Take me
Take me in your arms my love and rape me
Don't hide behind your rage
I know you love me
And always will

You're my possession
Of that my love there really is no question
Don't hide behind your rage
I know you love me
And always will

My better half it's true
Has seen the darker side of you
Innocence stripped away
At least I've the brighter fate
