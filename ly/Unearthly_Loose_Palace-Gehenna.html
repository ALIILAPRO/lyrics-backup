		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This night is silent, I set the world ou of its track
until only ashes circle around the moon
Close your eyes, follow me blindly
Goddess let my ice cold semen of gods flow through

Your only prayer...

Close your eyes and walk my path
I alter the moons direction
Look around never stop to speak
The star seams to move towards them

Sun groaning in ice, so no longer will the sun shine
nor the snake leave its shiny skin
O children of the dark will you run with me?
Find the palace
By way a higher bidding

Your only prayer be heard

Come with me I heard their screams
Frightfully as I watched them... die

Can you know?
Burn
Can you match me?
Soon
Can you leave?
The sun
Can you feel?
Burn

Your only prayer be heard

Sun groaning in ice; so no longer will the sun shine
O children of the dark will you walk my path?
