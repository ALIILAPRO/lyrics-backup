		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So, the season of the fall begins
Down the crossroads in a sleepy little inn
By the fire when the sun goes down

But the night becomes you
And the secrets of the rain

Forever Autumn

And the season of the fall begins
Out the night-lands when the thunderstorm sets in
The secrets clear in the cloudy night

But the night becomes you
And the secrets of the rain, they will stay the same
And the time will come soon 
With the secrets of the rain, and the storm again

Coming closer every day, forever Autumn

And the season of the fall begins
Past the passing-bell, past willows weeping
A ripple forms on the brinks of time

But the night becomes you
And the secrets of the rain, they will stay the same
And the time will come soon 
With the secrets of the rain, and the storm again

Coming closer every day, forever Autumn
