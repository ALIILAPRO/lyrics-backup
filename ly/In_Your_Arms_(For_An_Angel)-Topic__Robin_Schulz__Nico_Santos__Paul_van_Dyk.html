		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My heart was way too lonely
If you saw it closely, you'd see the scars, oh yeah
But all the things you showed me
Make me feel so holy, that's what you are

And I feel it coming, you're in my, my mind
Everything that we're doing
Feels right, oh, I love the way that you're moving
You're my limelight, I don't wanna lose you right now
Lose you right now

Take me in your arms, take me in your arms
Don't let go, no, just hold me again
Take me in your arms, take me in your arms
'Cause you know I feel whole on your skin

Take me in your arms
Take me in your arms
Take me in your arms

You're taking all my feelings
Wide awake and dreaming, I found it all, oh yeah
I'm living in the moment
With you's where my home is, can't get enough

And I feel it coming, you're in my, my mind
Everything that we're doing
Feels right, oh, I love the way that you're moving
You're my limelight, I don't wanna lose you right now
Lose you right now

Take me in your arms, take me in your arms
Don't let go, no, just hold me again
Take me in your arms, take me in your arms
'Cause you know I feel whole on your skin

Take me in your arms
Take me in your arms

Take me in your arms, take me in your arms
Don't let go, no, just hold me again
Take me in your arms, take me in your arms
'Cause you know I feel whole on your skin
Take me in your arms
