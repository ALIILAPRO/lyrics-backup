		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dancing by night
Do your eyes search the floor for me?
Dancing by night
Do your eyes search the light for me?

I'm sorry if I always seem to slip away
I disappear when you get close
I know I always seem to make the same mistakes
But I'm hoping that won't matter anymore

I know my hands are in the air
Doesn't mean my heart ain't broken no more, yeah
I know I've pushed your love away
But I won't make that mistake anymore

Dancing by night
Do your eyes search the floor for me?
Perfect by now
Does the crowd start to feel lonely?

I'm sorry if I always seem to slip away
My heart veins always seem to close, mmhm
A love, their arms too strong
It makes the same mistakes
But I'm hoping that won't happen anymore

I know my hands are in the air
Doesn't mean my heart ain't broken no more, yeah
I know I've pushed your love away
But I won't make that mistake anymore

I know my hands are in the air
Doesn't mean my heart ain't broken no more, yeah
I know I've pushed your love away
But I won't make that mistake anymore

Dancing, dancing by night
I'll keep dancing, just dancing by night
Come and see me dance
Keep on dancing
See me dancing
Ah, yeah-ah
