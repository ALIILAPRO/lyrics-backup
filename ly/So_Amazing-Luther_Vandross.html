		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Love has truly been good to me
Not even one sad day
Or minute have-I had since you've come my way
I hope you know I gladly go
Anywhere you take me

It's so amazing to be loved
I'd follow you to the moon in the sky above

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, I got

Got to tell you how you thrill me
I'm happy as I can be
You have come and it has changed my whole world
Bye bye sadness, hello mellow
What a wonderful day

It's so amazing to be loved
I'd follow you to the moon in the sky above, above

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, my God

And it's so amazing, amazing
I could stay forever, forever
Here in love and wouldn't leave you never
'Cause we've got amazing love
Truly it's amazing, amazing
Love brought us together, together
I would leave you never and never
Guess we've got amazing love

Ooh, so amazing and I've been waiting
For a love like you

It's so amazing to be loved
I'd follow you to the moon in the sky above

Ohh and it's love, it's so
It's so amazing to be loved
I'd follow you to the moon in the sky above

And you and I, it's so
It's so amazing to be loved
I'd follow you to the moon in the sky above

Yeah-yeah, ayy, yeah-yeah

It's so
It's so amazing to be loved
I'd follow you to the moon in the sky above
