		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And I had a dream
About my old school
And she was there all pink and gold and glittering
I threw my arms around her legs
Came to weeping (came to weeping)
Came to weeping (came to weeping)

And I heard your voice as clear as day
And you told me I should concentrate
It was all so strange and so surreal
That a ghost should be so practical
Only if for a night

And the only solution was to stand and fight
And my body was bruised and I was set alight
But you came over me like some holy rite
And although I was burning, you're the only light
Only if for a night

And the grass was so green against my new clothes
And I did cartwheels in your honor
Dancing on tiptoes, my own secret ceremonials
Before the service began
In the graveyard doing handstands

And I heard your voice as clear as day
And you told me I should concentrate
It was all so strange and so surreal
That a ghost should be so practical
Only if for a night

And the only solution was to stand and fight
And my body was bruised and I was set alight
But you came over me like some holy rite
And although I was burning, you're the only light
Only if for a night

My doe, my dear, my darling
Tell me what all this sighing's about
Tell me what all this sighing's about

And I heard your voice as clear as day
And you told me I should concentrate
It was all so strange and so surreal
That a ghost should be so practical

Only if for a night (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah ohh oh)
Only if for a night (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah ohh oh)
Only if for a night (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah ohh oh)
Only if for a night (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah ohh oh)

Only if for a night (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah ohh oh)
Only if for a night (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah ohh oh)
Only if for a night (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah ohh oh)
Only if for a night (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah ohh oh)
