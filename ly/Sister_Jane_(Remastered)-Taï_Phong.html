		  Sister Jane

Ah, Sister Jane
You left me blind and I'm lost
Ah, Sister Jane
Don't let the sun go down on me
Don't want to wake you
Save me from falling down

Ah, Sister Jane
You changed my way of life and
Ah, Sister Jane
You left me all alone but now
My mind is open
I reached the day you brought

You should go and see
Please, look in my eyes
I just want to cry
'Cause it's hard to be
All alone and blue, ah ah

Ah, Sister Jane
You left me blind and I'm lost
Ah, Sister Jane
Don't let the sun go down on me
Don't want to wake you
Save me from falling down

You should go and see
Please, look in my eyes
I just want to cry
'Cause it's hard to be
All alone and blue, ah ah

Ah, Sister Jane
You changed my way of life and
Ah, Sister Jane
You left me all alone but now
My mind is open
I reached the day you brought

Ah, Sister Jane
You left me blind and I'm lost
Ah, Sister Jane
Don't let the sun go down on me
Don't want to wake you
Save me from falling down
