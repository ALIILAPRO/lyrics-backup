		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Father they have written
On the point of no return
Soldiers they will come and
Oh they're coming to burn
(I said) Oh boy, we need your hope to live
Oh boy, you have so much to give
Oh boy, don't let it get you down

Who, baby, who will save the world ? (it's not too late)
Who, baby, who will save the world ? (all heroes hesitate)
I'm too young to die
I'm too young to die

Father, I've been looking
Through a rainbow of tears
Found yourself so lonely
Oh they're drowning in my fear
(I said) Oh boy, I'm old enough to know
Oh boy, that it hurts to grow
Oh boy, don't let it get you down
