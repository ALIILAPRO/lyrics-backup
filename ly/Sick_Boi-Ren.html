		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  "Hi Ren thank you for coming in today"
"Thanks for seeing me"
"Looking at your file here it seems there's a very apparent interplay
With your emotional state and your physical body.
Have you heard of the trauma response?"
"Um, I don't think so"
"Basically our bodies can get stuck in a negative feedback loop
Our subconscious can repeat patterns from the past which can
Have a pretty drastic downstream effect on our biology...
Essentially...
Your mind is making you sick"
Sick boy sick boy
Bitten by a tick boy
Looking for that fix boy
Anabolic steroids
Stem cell poster boy
Pass out, white noise
Quick fix, snake oil
I'm about to break boy
Oh, what a shame he's in pain have another go
Take another pill, here, take a couple more
Let see how your doing in another week or so
You'll be feeling worse when the side effect'll show
De-realization medical patient
Loosing patience with the process
Walking hand in hand with satan
Complications with the medication
Inflammation, dehydration, inhalation aggravation
Building up a toleration
Drown sucker, drown sucker, drown sucker, drown
I've been feeling like I'm drowning with my feet upon the ground
I've been screaming I've been shouting I but I never make sound
I've been looking for a way out but I always seem to drown
"Is this all making sense Ren?"
"Yeah, I think so"
"Good, what I propose we do is try to pinpoint the exact experiences
From the past that are keeping you stuck
What can you tell me about your childhood?"
"I can't really think..."
"Its okay if nothing comes up right away
What I'd like you to do is take some deep breaths with me
In and out, In and out
Good now tell me the first thing that comes to your mind..."
I feel like its not me, its the world that's sick
We're given everything we need and we commodities it
We consume, we destroy like we're parasitic
Science tells us that its suicide and still we commit
Im not sick, we are sick, we are standing on a cliff
In the name of progress we jump off the precipice
I'm not sick I'm the virus, you're the virus, hypocrite!
How can you sit there with that smile on
And tell me that I'm sick?
Sick boy, sick boy, looking for a fix boy
Push it down in public quick pose for the pic boy
Record label meetings that commodify your gift boy
Why you so upset?
Don't you wanna be a rich boy?
Fuck no
Industry is cut throat
I've been doing bits by myself swimming back stroke
Walking on a tight rope
Rapping with a slit throat
The way that we persist is like the ending of a bad joke
As the people evolve
We're complacent to assailants
And we do what we're told
Counter intelligence, a sight to behold
Rape the earth of all resources and we bleed it for gold
We bleed it for wealth, we bleed it for fame
But when you bleed it can you tell me what the fuck will remain?
And I bleed in myself
I bleed in my brain
While I'm bleeding, I'm the reason
'Cause I'm doing the same
