		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I needed to start running away
We're no good, it's me I'm trying to save
Treading water we're just numbing the pain
Spinning round as we circle the drain
Pick the pieces up and turn it around
I bring the hammer down

Walk out

Somehow I couldn't say to you, the things to make it right
The words just came out wrong and then we'd end up in a fight
'Cause I guess I fucked up, messed this luck up
And I blame myself
But man, I gotta let it go
Take a shot and let it roll
Then I can almost clear my head
'Til I'm alone laying in bed
Thinking
Get the fuck away from me
Get the fuck away from me
Get the fuck away from me
Get the fuck away

I needed to start running away
We're no good, it's me I'm trying to save
Treading water we're just numbing the pain
Spinning round as we circle the drain
Pick the pieces up and turn it around
I bring the hammer down

Walk out
Oh

Between the cocaine and the lies
The truth and alibis
Excuses don't mean anything when tears run down our eyes
All I do is remember, last September
Sitting in your car
And hearing "Man, I gotta go"
And I wish it wasn't so
But we were circling the drain
But we were circling the drain
Just can't change
Get the fuck away from me
Get the fuck away from me
Get the fuck away from me
Get the fuck away

I needed to start running away
We're no good, it's me I'm trying to save
Treading water we're just numbing the pain
Spinning round as we circle the drain
Pick the pieces up and turn it around
I bring the hammer

Get the fuck away from me
Get the fuck away from me
Get the fuck away from me
Get the fuck away
Get the fuck away from me
Get the fuck away from me
Get the fuck away from me
Get the fuck away, come on

I needed to start running away
We're no good, it's me I'm trying to save
Treading water we're just numbing the pain
Spinning round as we circle the drain

We needed to start running away
We're no good, we were just trying to save
Treading water we're just numbing the pain
Spinning round as we circle the drain
Pick the pieces up and turn it around
And bring the hammer down
Bring the hammer down
