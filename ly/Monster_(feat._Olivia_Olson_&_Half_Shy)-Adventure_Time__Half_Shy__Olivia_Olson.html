		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know we'll never grow old together
'Cause you'll never grow old to me
You're the pink
In my cheeks and I'm scared
'Cause it means I'm a little bit soft

So don't beat yourself up, Honey
It wasn't just the sun I was hiding from
We were messed up kids
Who taught ourselves how to live
So scared that I'm not good enough

I've always felt like a monster
Long before I was big
Only seen as a monster
Just say I'm used to it
And I grew tough 'cause love
Had only hurt me back
But loving you's
A good problem to have
And I'm used to that
But I could get used to this

The warmth of your hand in mine
Just feels like its meant to be
But im cold on the outside
To keep myself self couldn't be too soft

So don't beat yourself up, Honey
It wasn't just the sun I was hiding from
We were messed up kids
Who taught ourselves how to live
So scared that I'm not good enough

I've always felt like a monster
Long before I was big
Only seen as a monster
Just say I'm used to it
And I grew tough 'cause love
Had only hurt me back
But loving you's
A good problem to have
And I'm used to that
But I could get used to this

Ooh, yeah I'm used to that
But I could get used to this

And we'll never grow old together
'Cause you'll never grow old to me
You're the pink in my cheeks and I love
That it means I'm a little bit soft
You're the pink in my cheeks and I love
That it means I'm a little bit soft
