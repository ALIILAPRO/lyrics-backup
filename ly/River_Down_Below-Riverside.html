		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  ""I'd like to tell you What I dream about I'd like to say How much I miss you But I say sorry So come my darling Come to me I'm sorry I'm dying on the tree I'd like to tell you That it's not too late I'd like to say That I won with myself But I say sorry So come my darling Come to me Sorry I'm dying on the tree With the world beneath my feet  So you found me after all Pile of rocks And two nailed boards  Linger beside me You're all I have left Tell me the story of your life There's so much that I have got to find out Until the next darkness arrives I do not have too many requirements Only one wish Before you go And before I crumble back into the dust Take me to the river down below Take me to the river down below  Stay Sit down And get some rest Since you came across my place  Linger beside me You're all I have left Tell me the story of your life There's so much that I have got to find out Until the next darkness arrives I do not have too many requirements Only one wish Before you go And before I crumble back into the dust Take me to the river down below Take me to the river down below  And before I crumble back into the dust... And before I crumble back into the dust...""
