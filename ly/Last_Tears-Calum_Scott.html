		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Most of my friends
They stop calling by now
'Cause every time they do
I'm still crying over you

'Cause even my mother
She still asks about you
'Bout when you're coming home
And I keep telling her you won't

'Cause what goes up
Must come down
I'm messed up
Can't sleep now
If that's love
Count me out

'Cause I remember the first time
You called me
The first time
You kissed me
The first time you said you missed me
And I said I missed you too
I remember the first time
That we fought
The first time
We made up
That first house we ever moved into

There's a first time for everything
But these'll be the last tears I cry for you
These'll be the last tears I cry for you

Speak of the devil
Why you calling me now?
Too little and too late
I was sad, now I feel great

'Cause what went up
Came back down
You're messed up
I see that now
If that's love
Count me out

'Cause I remember the first time
You called me
The first time
You kissed me
The first time you said you missed me
And I said I missed you too
I remember the first time
That we fought
The first time
We made up
That first house we ever moved into

There's a first time for everything
But these'll be the last tears I cry for you

But these will be the last tears I cry for you
These'll be the last tears I cry for you
These'll be the last tears I cry for you
So, these'll be the last tears I cry for you
