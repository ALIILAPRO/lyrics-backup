		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hello, old lady 
I know your face well 
I know it well

She says
I'll be sitting in your mirror
Now is the place where the crossroads meet
Will you look into the future? 

Never, never say goodbye 
To my part of your life
No, no, no, no, no
Oh, oh, oh

Let me live
She said 
C'mon and let me live, girl 
She said
C'mon and let me live, girl 
(C'mon and let me live) 

This moment in time
(She said) 
It doesn't belong to you
(She said) 
It belongs to me

And to your little boy and to your little girl
And the one hand clapping
Where on your palm is my little line
When you're written in mine 
As an old memory? 

Never, never say goodbye 
To my part of your life 
Oh no, no, no, no, no 
Never, never, never 
Never, never let me go 

She said
C'mon and let me live, girl
(C'mon and let me live) 
She said 
C'mon and let me live, girl 
(C'mon and let me live) 

I put this moment here 
I put this moment here 
I put this moment
Over here 
Over here 

Can't you see where memories are kept bright? 
Tripping on the water like a laughing girl 
Time in her eyes is spawning past life
One with the ocean and the woman unfurled 
Holding all the love that waits for you here 
Catch us now for I am your future 

A kiss on the wind and we'll make the land 
Come over here to where When lingers
Waiting in this empty world
Waiting for Then, when the lifespray cools 
For Now does ride in on the curl of the wave 
And you will dance with me in the sunlit pools 

We are of the going water and the gone 
We are of water in the holy land of water 
And all that's to come runs in 
With the thrust on the strand
