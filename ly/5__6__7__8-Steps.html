		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's time to begin - now count it in
5-6-7-8

My boot scootin' baby is drivin' me crazy
My obsession from a Western, my dance floor date
My rodeo Romeo, a cowboy god from head to toe
Wanna make you mine, better get in line
5-6-7-8

My boot scootin' baby is drivin' me crazy
My obsession from a Western, my dance floor date
My rodeo Romeo, a cowboy god from head to toe
Wanna make you mine, better get in line
5-6-7-8

Foot kickin', finger clickin', leather slapping, hand clappin'
Hip bumpin', music thumpin', knee hitchin', heel and toe
Floor scuffin', leg shufflin', big grinnin', body spinnin'
Rompin' stompin', pumpin' jumpin', slidin' glidin', here we go

My boot scootin' baby is drivin' me crazy
My obsession from a Western, my dance floor date
My rodeo Romeo, a cowboy god from head to toe
Wanna make you mine, better get in line
5-6-7-8

Tush pushin', thunder footin', cowgirl twistin', no resistin'
Drums bangin', steel twangin', two steppin', end to end
Hardwood crawlin', some four wallin', rug cuttin', cowboy struttin'
Burnin' yearnin', windin' grindin', let's begin the dance again

You're mine, all mine now, bubba
Gonna rope you in, so count me in
5-6-7-8

My boot scootin' baby is drivin' me crazy
My obsession from a Western, my dance floor date
My rodeo Romeo, a cowboy god from head to toe
Wanna make you mine, better get in line
5-6-7-8

My boot scootin' baby is drivin' me crazy
My obsession from a Western, my dance floor date
My rodeo Romeo, a cowboy god from head to toe
Wanna make you mine, better get in line
5-6-7-8

My boot scootin' baby is drivin' me crazy
My obsession from a Western, my dance floor date
My rodeo Romeo, a cowboy god from head to toe
Wanna make you mine, better get in line
5-6-7-8
