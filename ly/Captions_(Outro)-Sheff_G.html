		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Great John on the beat, by the way)

Look, my niggas make it hot up in the winter
My niggas make it hot up in the wintertime, look
Yeah, I pray to God but I'm a sinner, yeah, huh
Yeah, I pray to God but I'm a sinner, I know

They like, "How you take them losses and keep pushin' forward?"
I keep a chin up like a boy in front me, nigga, huh
Like, "How you deal with all them haters say they gunnin' for you?"
Lil' bro gon' wet you for the team, it ain't no water boy
This ain't no pencil when it's lead up in that backpack
Take twenty-one if you wan' play, but this ain't Blackjack
I put that silence in your city, ain't no rap cap
Heard shit got lit, ain't have no stick
Guess he can't match that
I smash the gas up on you niggas, tell 'em speed up
Heard traffic slow up on they block, now that's a speed bump
They look up to me like I'm taller, wanna be us
Might have a daughter or some sons, each one gon' teach one
Each one gon' teach one
To all the pussies who done faked on me
Like I ain't raised my hand, bet you never hear from me
My feelings numb, could carry onions, still no tears from me
I was scorin', never need no one to cheer for me
(Huh, wasn't there for me)

Look, my niggas make it hot up in the winter
My niggas make it hot up in the wintertime, look
Yeah, I pray to God but I'm a sinner, yeah, huh
Yeah, I pray to God but I'm a sinner, I know

They like, "How you take them losses and keep pushin' forward?"
Wintertime, they like, "How you take them losses and keep pushin' forward?"
Pushin' forward, pushin' forward, pushin' forward
