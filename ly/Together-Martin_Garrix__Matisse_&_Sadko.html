		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Diamonds in the dust
That is all we are
Some of us give up
Some dream of the stars

There's a change in the wind that's blowing
And I've still got blood in my heart
Though we might not know where we're going
I promise we'll never be apart

Just pick me up
And never let me go
We don't need much
As long as we're together, together, together
(Together, together, together)
(Together, together, together)
We don't need much
As long as we're together, together, together

As long as we're together, together, together
As long as we're together, together, together

Heads under the sun
Wait for night to fall
Some get what they want
Some they lose it all

There's a change in the wind that's blowing
And we've still got blood in our hearts
Though we might not know where we're going
I promise we'll never be apart

Just pick me up
And never let me go
We don't need much
As long as we're together, together, together
(Together, together, together)
(Together, together, together)
(Together, together, together)
(Together, together, together)
(Together, together, together)
(Together, together, together)
We don't need much
As long as we're together, together, together
