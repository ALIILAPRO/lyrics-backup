		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Said, I don't know if I've ever been good enough
I'm a little bit rusty and I think my head is cavin' in
And I don't know if I've ever been really loved
By a hand that's touched me, and I feel like something's got to give
And I'm a little bit angry, well

This ain't over, no, not here, no
Not while I still need you around
You don't owe me, we might change, yeah
Yeah, we just might feel good

I wanna push you around, well, I will, well, I will
I wanna push you down, well, I will, well, I will
I wanna take you for granted
I wanna take you for granted
Yeah, yeah
I will

She said I don't know why you ever would lie to me
'Cause I'm a little untrusting when I think that the truth is gonna hurt you
And I don't know why you couldn't just stay with me
Couldn't stand to be near me when my face don't seem to wanna shine
'Cause I'm a little bit dirty, oh, well

Don't just stand there, say nice things to me
'Cause I've been cheated, I've been wronged, and you
You don't know me, yeah, I can't change
I won't do anything at all

I wanna push you around, well, I will, well, I will
I wanna push you down, well, I will, well, I will
I wanna take you for granted
I wanna take you for granted
Yeah, well, I will

Oh, don't bowl me over
Just wait a minute, well, it kinda fell apart
Things get so crazy, crazy
Don't rush this, baby
Don't rush this, baby, baby

I wanna push you around, well, I will, well, I will
I wanna push you down, well, I will, well, I will
I wanna take you for granted
I wanna take you, take you
Yeah, well, I will
