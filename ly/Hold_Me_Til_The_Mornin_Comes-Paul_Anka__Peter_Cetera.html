		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Two broken hearts
Neither one knows what to say
Both falling for love
But not quite all the way

Look at us now
Reaching back for yesterday
And wanting to know
If the other wants to stay

After all I'm the one who said we're through
Now I can't live without you anymore
And out there lost is a dream that can't come true
Is it worth the reaching for
Do you need me anymore,
Darling

[Chorus]
Hold me till the morning comes
Until I see your smile
Take all the sadness from your eyes
Hold me till the morning sun
Let me stay we've just begun
I wanna stay with you

Well shall we start
A tender world that we can share
And if we believe
In time we will get there

Look at us now
Wanting more than words can say
Both falling in love
But this time all the way

Out there lost are the words I still love you
Are they worth the reaching for
Do you love me anymore, darling

[Chorus]

Hold me till the morning comes
Until I see your smile
Take all the sadness from your eyes (no more, no details)
Hold me till the morning sun
Let me stay we've just begun
I wanna stay with you

[Chorus]

Would you love me in the morning (would you love me?)(love me)
Will you still be there in the morning (would you love me?)
Or would you leave without a warning (say you stay)
(Say you'll stay by me) (say you love me too)
Say you love me too (don't run away)
