		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Yeah, Banx & Ranx)

Oh I
I feel like I can be myself with you
All these feelings came out of the blue
I found love, I'm lost in your perfume
It takes me over

Oh, won't ya come closer?
Your head on my shoulder
Can't keep my composure
Not gonna lie

Sugar, don't you know that you the reason why?
Why I get up in the morning
It's the sugar in your love and you're the reason why
I'm addicted to you, darling
We ain't even sleepin', we be up all night
Making love until the morning
Sugar, don't you know that you the reason why? The reason why
The reason why (the reason)
The reason why
You're the reason why

Yuh know seh yuh get anyting weh yuh want
You nuh beg, you nuh borrow, you nuh fear none at all
See, the love weh me give yuh make nuff man come like war
You have my body just ah rev like a car (ah you)

You know seh mi ready fi di jet
Anytime me step, ready fi di ting fi connect
Land di big ting pon de set
Grab up me neck, bawl, mi ah bawl, mi ah bawl

Oh, won't ya come closer? (Closer)
Your head on my shoulder (tonight)
Can't keep my composure
Not gonna lie

Sugar, don't you know that you the reason why?
Why I get up in the morning
It's the sugar in your love and you're the reason why
I'm addicted to you, darling
We ain't even sleepin', we be up all night
Making love until the morning
Sugar, don't you know that you the reason why? The reason why
The reason why (the reason)
The reason why
You're the reason why (get up in the morning)

Oh, won't ya come closer? (Closer)
Your head on my shoulder (tonight)
Can't keep my composure
Not gonna lie

Sugar, don't you know that you the reason why
Why I wake up in the morning
It's the sugar in your love and you're the reason why
I'm addicted to you, darling
We ain't even sleepin', we be up all night
Making love until the morning
Sugar, don't you know that you the reason why, the reason why
The reason why
The reason why
You're the reason why
(I get up in the morning)
