		  Hey

She said, "I really miss the old you"
Then found someone better (whoa)
I really miss the old me (yeah, yeah)
Maybe he was better, oh, oh, oh

But I realize I'm doin' fine
I just start thinkin' crazy when you're on my mind (crazy when you're on my mind, yeah)
You'll be okay and I'll be alright
But I've gotta say

If we're said and done I know, I shouldn't say that
I still care, but I still care
And even when you're movin' on I hope you know that
I'll be there, I'll be there

I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you
Even if you don't want me to
I'll be there for you
Be there for you
I'll be there for you
Even if you don't want me to
I'll be there for you
(Yeah)

I really gotta ask myself (oh)
If I knew you weren't good for me then
Why do I want you back right now? Oh
Like you think I would've asked by now (oh)
I'm in the palm of your hand, and then you don't give a damn
Was it easy to let me go? (Say it)
Say it quick, love my name when you sayin' it
I don't even know why I'm sayin' this
'Cause nothin' I'm sayin' is gonna change this

But I realize I'm doin' fine
I just start thinkin' crazy when you're on my mind
You'll be okay and I'll be alright
But I've gotta say

If we're said and done I know, I shouldn't say that
I still care, but I still care
And even when you're movin' on I hope you know that (I hope you know)
I'll be there, I'll be there

Be there for you
Ooh, ooh
I'll be there for you
Ooh, ooh

Be there for you
I'll be there for you
Even if you don't want me to
I'll be there for you
