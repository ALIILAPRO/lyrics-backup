		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  As I recall when my stomach turned 
And I was hiding away from myself 
Away from you 
Like nothing but something was terribly wrong 
And I admit that I was only waiting for the right time (right time) 
Right moment for you to look away 
Though you never did I pretended for a while 
So I could walk where I don't belong 

I remember every word you said 
Come back in time come back 
And I remember I was too beaten 
Pitiful so pitiful 

But I know as they hammered those nails 
Into your beautiful hands 
Your eyes they tried to search for mine 
But I look away 
Now your eyes are the only thing that can save me 
I'm still afraid of them piercin' 
You break into my prison 
Just pretended for a while 
My soul is sad and I walk away 

I remember every word you said 
Come back in time come back 
And I remember I was too beaten 
Pitiful so pitiful 

Pitiful 
Pitiful 
Pitiful 
Pitiful 
So pitiful 

And I remember every word you said 
But this time I won't look away 
And I remember every word you said 
And this time I won't look away 

And I remember every word you said 
Come back in time come back 
And I remember I was so beaten 
Pitiful so pitiful 

And I remember every word you said (pitiful) 
Come back in time come back (pitiful) 
And I remember I was too beaten (pitiful) 
Pitiful so pitiful
