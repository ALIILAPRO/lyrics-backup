		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Girl, you tried to break my heart, did it make you happy? (Did it make you happy?)
You supposed to hold me down, but it didn't happen (you supposed to hold me down)
Now I'm over it
Thank God I'm over it (thank God)
Tired of stressin' about what I can't control
I think I'm better on my own (hey)
I kicked all the fuck niggas out my circle
Y'all don't know how this shit feel, they really hurt you (phew)
But I'm nonchalant, they never gon' know
Word to my mama, she ain't never raise no ho (word to my mama)
My heart ain't racin', it's barely beatin' slow
If they want smoke, if I see 'em, it's a go (smoke)
Fuck that nigga, fuck that bitch (fuck 'em)
Fuck everybody 'cause you know they gon' switch (hey)

Fuck them niggas and them bitches, everybody (hey)
Fuck them niggas and them bitches, everybody (hey)
(This that shit that make me turn demon)
Fuck them niggas and them bitches, everybody (woo)
(This that shit that make me turn demon)
Fuck them niggas and them bitches, everybody
(This that shit that make me-)

Baby, we just fuckin', this is not no love at first sight (it's not)
I can't take you serious, I fucked you on the first night (first)
Had that thing squirtin', pussy poppin' like a Perc', right? (Squirtin')
Said I broke your heart and hurt your feelings, it ain't work, right? (Hey)

Fuck them niggas and them bitches, everybody (fuck 'em)
Fuck them niggas and them bitches, everybody (everybody)
Fuck them niggas and them bitches, everybody
Fuck them niggas and them bitches
Fuck them niggas and them bitches (let's roll)

Girl, fuck that nigga, he ain't 'bout shit (nothin')
You could be my engineer, shorty, how you bounce it (bounce it)
Promise if you suck it, baby, I could make your mouth rich (promise)
Put pearls on your neck, I bet I make it match your outfit (match it, woo)
Keep it low, don't you announce it
Quick to cut you off, nigga, I ain't with the nonsense (nah)
Fuck gettin' it out the mud, bitch, I had to move a mountain (mud)
Diamonds on my neck, that shit pure water like a fountain (pure water)
Yeah, I'm taking your bitch, I take her for ransom (ransom)
She lyin', she tellin' me that it ain't even my money, she say that I'm handsome (cap)
She hop in the whip, she throwin' that ass, she throwin' that shit like a tantrum (throw it)
I'm pullin' her hair, she don't even care, she want me to bust like a handgun (go)
I turn her to my favorite stripper (stripper) 'cause I'm that nigga (nigga)
My watch worth six figures (figure), my bank bigger (bigger)
She want me fuck the best friend and (friend and) the big sister (sister)
I bend her up, we playin' Twister (Twister), and then I kick her (outtie)
Out the crib when I'm finished (woo), go figure (woo)
I just popped a E-Pizzle (E), my blunt lit up (lit up, hey)
I had way too much sizzurp (sizzurp) in my liver (liver, woo)
I keep me two freaky bitches (freaky), they both scissor (woo, woo, woo, hey)

Fuck them niggas and them bitches, everybody (fuck them niggas and them bitches)
Fuck them niggas and them bitches, everybody (fuck them bitches)
Fuck them niggas and them bitches, everybody (everybody) 
Fuck them niggas and them bitches
Fuck them niggas and them bitches (hey, fuck everybody)
