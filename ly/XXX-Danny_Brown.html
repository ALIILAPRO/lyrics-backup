Colder than them grits they fed slaves
Me to rap is like water to raves
Ak's with bayonets on deck, rep my set
Sorta like Squidward and his clarinet
I'm in ya bitch mouth but she fantasizing
Staring at the skinny's, said it's so tantalizing
Dawg, I'm strategizing, plotting on the throne
Master of the ace, sitting on chrome
Dark nights, tryna sleep, stomach on fire
Delusional from hunger, so I couldn't get tired
Imagining the equalizer goin' from green to red
Words that rhyme together just appear all in my head

And I'm sorta like Neo with the Matrix code
Try to escape it, hoping the drugs'll numb my soul
Say I'm getting old, time's running out
Repeating instrumentals, tryna figure patterns out
I never leave the house, ain't slept in three days
Popping pills, writing, drinking and smoking haze
Weaving kicks and snares, tryna dodge these hooks
Keepin' it original, something that's overlooked
The way a nigga goin', might go out like Sam Cooke
Or locked up, calling home for money on my books
'Cause if this shit don't work, nigga, I failed at life
Turning to these drugs, now these drugs turned my life

And it's the downward spiral, got me suicidal
But too scared to do it, so these pills'll be the rifle
Surpassing all my idols, took the wrong turn
But can't go back now, so let that blunt burn
'Cause now it's my turn if I fuck it all up
It took a while to get here, now I depend on these drugs
Uh, I took a while to get here, now I depend on these drugs
Triple X
