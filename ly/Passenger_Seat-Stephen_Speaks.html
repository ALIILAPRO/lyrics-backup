		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I look at her and have to smile
As we go driving for a while
Her hair blowing in the open window of my car, and
And as we go the traffic lights
Watch them glimmer in her eyes
In the darkness of the evening

Oh, and I've got all that I need
Right here in the passenger seat
Oh, and I can't keep my eyes on the road
Knowing that she's inches from me

We stop to get something to drink
My mind clouds and I can't think
Scared to death to say I love her
Then the moon peek from the clouds
I hear my heart it beats so loud
Try to tell her simply

That I've got all that I need
Right here in the passenger seat
Oh, and I can't keep my eyes on the road
Knowing that she's inches from me

Oh, and I know 
That this love, it'll grow

Oh, and I've got all that I need
Right here in the passenger seat
Oh, and I can't keep my eyes on the road
Knowing that she's inches from me

I look at her and have to smile (I've got all that I need)
As we go driving for a while
Her hair blowing in the open window of my car, and (I've got all that I need)
And as we go the traffic lights (I've got all that I need)
Watch them glimmer in her eyes
In the darkness of the evening, oh, oh oh (I've got all that I need)

And I've got all that I need
Right here in the passenger seat
Oh, and I can't keep my eyes on the road
Knowing that she's inches from me

Oh, oh, oh

And I've got all that I need
Right here in the passenger seat
and I can't keep my eyes on the road
Knowing that she's inches from me
