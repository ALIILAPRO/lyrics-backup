		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We're sorry
But you're no longer needed
Or wanted
Or even cared about here 
Machines can do a better job than you
This is what you get for asking questions 

The unions agree
'Sacrifices must be made'
Computers never go on strike
To save the working man you've got to put him out to pasture 

Looks like we'll have to let you go
Doesn't it feel fulfilling to know
That you-the human being-are now obsolete
And there's nothing in hell we'll let you do about it 

Soup is good food-(We don't need you any more) 
You made a good meal-(We don't need you any more) 
Now how do you feel-(We don't need you any more) 
To be shit out our ass 
And thrown in the cold like a piece of trash 
We're sorry
You'll just have to leave
Unemployment runs out after just six weeks 
How does it feel to be a budget cut?
You're snipped
You no longer exist 

Your number's been purged from our central computer
So we can rig the facts
And sweep you under the rug
See our chart? Unemployment's going down
If that ruins your life that's your problem 

Soup is Good Food, Etc. 
We're sorry
We hate to interrupt
But it's against the law to jump off this bridge 
You'll just have to kill yourself somewhere else
A tourist might see you
And we wouldn't want that 

I'm just doing my job, you know
So say uncle
And we'll take you to the mental health zoo
Force feed you mind-melting chemicals
Til even the outside world looks great 

In hi-tech science research labs
It costs too much to bury all the dead
The mutilated disease-injected
Surplus rats who can't be used anymore 

So they're dumped (with no minister present)
In a spiraling corkscrew dispose-all unit
Ground into sludge and flushed away
Aw geez 

Soup is good food 
You made a good meal, etc:. 
We know how much you'd like to die
We joke about it on our coffee breaks
But we're paid to force you to have a nice day
In the wonderful world we made just for you 
"Poor Rats", we human rodents chuckle
At least we get a dignified cremation
At yet
At 6:00 tomorrow morning
It's time to get up and go to work
