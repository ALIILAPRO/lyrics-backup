		  Jaiye
Jaiye
Jaiye
Jaiye Juls baby

I might move to Miami
Beach house after my Grammy
Speak it into existence
Continue to mind my business
I don't fuck with no players
Don't do heartbreaks or favours
I ain't got no behaviour
Steady makin' my paper

I drink it straight fuck a chaser
I can't bring no dishonour
Never steal like Winona
Keep it cool like Corona
Yeah good girl come from the Niz
I take chance and take risk
Fuck you think that this is

Ooh oh ooh oh ooh oh
Fed up sometimes
Ooh oh ooh oh ooh oh
Too blessed sometimes
Too blessed sometimes
Too blessed sometimes
Ooh oh ooh oh ooh oh
Too blessed sometimes
Blessed sometimes
Ooh oh ooh oh ooh oh

Jaiye jaiye jaiye
Ou seriye laiye
Jaiye jaiye jaiye
Ou seriye laiye
Jaiye jaiye jaiye
Ou seriye laiye
Jaiye jaiye jaiye
Ou seriye laiye

Jaiye jaiye jaiye

Ooh oh ooh oh ooh oh
Ooh oh ooh oh ooh oh

I manifest whatever it is I desire
My vibration is higher
Even when my soul is on fire
I don't like to complain but I feel beat up and tired
I never put my feet up and fight it
I face my fears I'm not hiding
Trust me man go hard to the bone like marrow
Man go sweet like mango
You wanna get beats Let's tango
Niggas street nigga mango
Don't come near with no scandal
Don't come near with no fuckery
When niggas sound broke couldn't trust me

Gyaldem preed I'm with yeah
The gyaldem preed I'ma ugly
They wanna get feely and touchy
Smile-dem weak them it must be
Came from the ground but now man's here though
Say that I need my cheers though
Say that I need my flowers but I'm not gone yet, man's still here though

Ooh oh ooh oh ooh oh
Fed up sometimes
Ooh oh ooh oh ooh oh
Blessed sometimes
Too blessed sometimes
Too blessed sometimes
Ooh oh ooh oh ooh oh
Too blessed sometimes
Blessed sometimes
Ooh oh ooh oh ooh oh

Oh Juls baby
