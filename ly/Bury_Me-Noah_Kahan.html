		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I never found a heart I couldn't break
For you I hoped my parts would rearrange
You'd see a change
You'd see a change
Oh, I don't know

'Cause honey now this house feels like a grave
And now I cannot help but take the blame
For every stain
For messes I've made with your heart

They're already living six feet underneath, can't you see?

So our times come around
And our wounds run deep
There ain't no words to speak
Honey, bury me

Watch it fall, let it drown
In a deep blue sea
Baby, bury me
Honey, bury me

If I could find a way to change our fate
Would any of our demons be erased?
Oh, could I change?
Oh, could I change
Help, I don't know

'Cause honey there's no shame in letting go
I guess I'll see you at the funeral
I'll be alone
You'll be alone
Oh, aren't we all?

They're already living six feet underneath, can't you see?

So our times come around
And our wounds run deep
There ain't no words to speak
Honey, bury me

Watch it fall, let it drown
In a deep blue sea
Baby, bury me (bury me)
Honey, bury me

Faking sleep but my eyes haven't closed
I know you're dreaming of letting me go
Can you feel the dirt down below?

So our times come around
And our wounds run deep
There ain't no words to speak
Honey, bury me

So, watch it fall let it drown
In a deep blue sea
Baby, bury me (bury me)
Honey, bury me

Bury me (bury me)
Bury me
Bury me
Bury me

Bury me 
Bury me
Bury me
Bury me
