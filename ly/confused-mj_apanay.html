		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I never fell in love with someone like you
But now you got me confused
'Cause all the things that you do
They get my heartbeat racin' faster 
Than the girls from before
And now I'm thirstin' for more
But girl I need 'a be sure

When I first saw you in the city of LA 
I thought there wasn't any way
'Cause your too pretty for my tastes yeah
But you were lookin' at me from the far end of the room
And every time I looked at you
You turned your head away so cute

Now I
I'm fallin' head over heels
'Cause when I'm with you all I feel is
I want you to be mine
But I
I'm finding it hard to go for it
'Cause what you should probably know is

I never fell in love with someone like you
But now you got me confused
'Cause all the things that you do
They get my heartbeat racin' faster 
Than the girls from before
And now I'm thirstin' for more
But girl I need 'a be sure
'Cause I don't let just anybody
In my life, my life
'Cause I've been hurt way too many times, many times

Before you get closer tell me more about yourself
'Cause I don't know you all too well
But there's so much I wanna tell you
'Cause even if we're strangers you're the only one I trust
But I don't wanna say too much
Don't wanna say that I'm in love

'Cause I
I tend to fall way too fast
And I don't want these feelings to pass
Without even trying
But I
I'm finding it hard to go for it
'Cause what you should probably know is

I never fell in love with someone like you
But now you got me confused
'Cause all the things that you do
They get my heartbeat racin' faster 
Than the girls from before
And now I'm thirstin' for more
But girl I needa be sure
'Cause I don't let just anybody
In my life, my life
'Cause I've been hurt way too many times, many times
But by any chance if you don't mind, don't mind
Would you still be mine
