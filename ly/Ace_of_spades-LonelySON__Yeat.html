		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah I pop a lil pill now I'm Neo
I chill with the gang it's a trio
And I just keep fucking on Leo's
You know I gotta stay away from the cheap hoes

Yeah I gotta stay away from the fake
I just ran up my money yeah my cake
I can not save no hoe I don't wear capes
I'm making this money chilling with the gang
Yeah fuck with the bro he gotta green dot
I'm putting all my hoes in the same pot
I'm putting all my hoes inna group
I'm smoking on flame watch out it might burn you
Yeah hoe I ain't mean to hurt you
I'm going in on that bitch like a curfew
True Religion yeah I keep a horseshoe
Fuck with the gang I bet they gone murk you

Yuh I pop a lil pill now I'm Neo
I chill with the gang it's a trio
And I just keep fucking on Leo's
You know I gotta stay away from the cheap hoes
Yeah you know that I gotta get it
Stuff in my pockets that bitch barely fit in
Yeah you snitch why you admit that
I just keep it real but they won't admit that

Yuh I pop a lil pill now I'm Neo
I chill with the gang it's a trio
I just keep fucking on Leo's
You know I gotta stay away from the cheap hoes

From the cheap hoes

(Yeah, Huh)
An I just keep stacking my cho's
I need some more designer clothes
I need some more designer hoes
Designer drugs they got me off of the floor
Yeah they got me off of the shits
Might just go flick up take pics
Might just go run on your bitch
Huh might just go hit me a lick
Might just go hit me a stain yeah for the money I gain
Yeah I'm staying true to myself I'm just living I gotta maintain
I ball like I'm Carter no Wayne
I stack up that money to get me a house and then I go cop me a chain
(Yeah, Phwoah)
You ain't even I'm my lane
Nah no no you ain't even in my way
I fucked that bitch so hard she wet like rain I gave her the pain
I'm playing with that little bitch heart yeah like it was a game
I told my momma that I gotta go get the change yeah no can't be a lame

Pop a lil pill now I'm Neo
I just go chill with the gang yeah and that bitch a trio
Woah and I just keep fucking on all these hoes I think they was Leo's
Yeah cause you know I can't be out here fucking on cheap hoes

Yuh I pop a lil pill now I'm Neo
I chill with the gang it's a trio
And I just keep fucking on Leo's
You know I gotta stay away from the cheap hoes
Yeah you know that I gotta get it
Stuff in my pocket that bitch barely fit in
Yeah you snitch why you admit that
I just keep it real but they won't admit that

(Ayy, Geo got them bands huh?)
