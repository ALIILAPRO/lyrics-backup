		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All the ghostly streets are bare
The boarded windows scream despair 
And I, walk on
There used to be a city here
When hope was full and dreams were clear
But now, they're gone
Through rusted memories 
Our sleepless eyes see
Night surrender into the dawn

Out of the ashes comes a new fire
Turning the darkness into a burning sun
Out of the ashes wings headed skyward 
I will rise like a bullet that's flyin' from Heaven's gun
Heaven's gun

Iron hands of trusted kings 
Have stolen almost everything
Call it, even
Deep in my own conquered heart 
Tomorrow is a work of art 
I still, believe it
They didn't kill me
Someday it will be 
My turn at the top of the world

Out of the ashes comes a new fire
Turning the darkness into a burning sun
Out of the ashes wings headed skyward 
I will rise like a bullet that's flyin' from Heaven's gun

It's not about destiny
It's not about fate
It's all about courage 
And refusing to break (refusing to break)
It's all about livin' up
All about not givin' up
Would you walk through hell to find yourself 
You can hold your head up while this world goes down in flames

Out of the ashes comes a new fire
Turning the darkness into a burning sun 
Out of the ashes wings headed skyward
We will rise like a bullet that's flyin' from Heavens gun

It's not about destiny
It's not about fate (from Heaven's gun)
It's all about courage and refusing to break (out of the ashes)
It's all about livin' up
All about not givin' up
We will rise like a bullet that's flying from Heaven's gun

It's not about destiny
It's not about fate
It's all about courage 
And refusing to break (refusing to break)
It's all about livin' up
All about not givin' up
We will rise like a bullet that's flying from Heaven's gun
