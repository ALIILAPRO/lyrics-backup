		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Flashing lights and pulsing sirens
But I can't hear a thing
I can feel the crowd around me but
I'm thinking of your skin
Now I'm on my victim game shit
Telling them that I need some air
They can tell I'm miles away
I'm questioning myself
It's like I almost care

I thought that you could save me
I thought that you could save me
And now you put your all
In saving someone else
When you never learned how to save yourself

I hope my friends don't find out
You posted about this club
That's why we're here right now
And I know you're still around
Even passed you by the door
No, I swallow my fears even faster
Than I pour my next
Drink about opinions that I'm trying
Not to care about
Is that who you were to me?
Never think of who I'm using just
To make me feel cared about
Is that what you took from me?

I thought that you could save me
I thought that you could save me
And now you put your all
In saving someone else
When you never learned how to save yourself

Can you see me spiraling out?
It's more that I can take
I can feel your circling in

I thought that you could save me
I thought that you could save me
And now you put your all
In saving someone else
When you never learned how to save yourself
