		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm stuck inside of these walls with you
I don't recognize who I've turned into
I'm losing hope in getting myself back
Everything around me starting to turn black

Don't tell me you're hurt again
Tell me how wrong I am
Tell me how it's all my fault
Yeah, I've met my match again
Starting from scratch again
Where is the pleasure in all this pain?

Don't you lie to me, say, "It's all okay"
When it feels like I'm drowning
Well, I hate to say goodbye but it's time to go
All I need is, all I need is
All I need is someone else

All I need is someone else
All I need is someone else

I've never felt more divided than now
Every word that leaves your lips never means how it sounds

You've conquered the best of me
Could've just set me free
The games that you play are just sickening
And now I'm beside myself
Don't want your fucking help
Let me just go, let me just go

Don't you lie to me, say, "It's all okay"
When it feels like I'm drowning
Well, I hate to say goodbye but it's time to go
All I need is, all I need is
All I need is someone else

All I need is someone else
All I need is someone else
