		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fast, on a rough road riding
High, through the mountains climbing
Twisting, turning further from my home.
Young, like a new moon rising
Fierce, through the rain and lightning
Wandering out into this great unknown.

And I don't want no one to cry, but tell em'
If I don't survive

I was born free
I was born free
I was born free
Born Free

Free, like a river raging
Strong, if the wind I'm facing.
Chasing dreams and racing father time.
Deep like the grandest canyon,
Wild like an untamed stallion.
If you can't see my heart you must be blind.

You can knock me down and watch me bleed
But you can't keep no chains on me.

I was born free
I was born free
I was born free
Born Free

And I'm not good at long goodbyes but look down
Deep into my eyes.

I was born free!

Hey yaya yayaya
Oh hoo

Calm facing danger
Lost, like an unknown stranger
Grateful for my time with no regrets.

Close to my destination
Tired, frail and aching
Waitin' patiently for the sun to set

And when its done believe that
I will yell it from that mountain high

I was born free
I was born free
I was born free
Born Free

And I will vow to the shining seas
And celebrate God's Grace on me.

I was born free
I was born free
I was born free
Born Free

Oh, oh oh oh wah hoo
