		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh

I'll dive in deeper, deeper for you
Down to the bottom, 10,000 emerald pools
Down to the bottom, 10,000 emerald pools
Under water
Time is standing still
You're the treasure
Dive down deeper
Still, all I need is you
You're all I need to breathe
All I need is you

I'll make a living, trying to get away
10,000 fathoms, under a tidal wave
It can never pull me away
No way
Under water
Time is standing still
You're the treasure
Dive down deeper
Still, all I need is you
You're all I need to breathe
All I need is you!
You're all I need to breathe

Down to the bottom, 10,000 emerald pools
You're all I need to breathe
I'll dive in deeper, deeper for you
You're all I need to breathe

All I need is you
All I need is you
It can never pull me away
Time is standing still
Dive down deeper
Still, all I need is you
You're all I need to breathe
All I need is you
