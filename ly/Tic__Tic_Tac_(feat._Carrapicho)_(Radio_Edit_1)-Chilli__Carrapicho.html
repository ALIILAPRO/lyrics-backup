		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do you really wanna know?
'Bout the boy from my show

Bate bate o tambor
Eu quero é tic, tic, tic, tic, tac
Bate bate o tambor
Eu quero é tic, tic, tic, tic, tac

Bate bate o tambor
Eu quero é tic, tic, tic, tic, tac
Bate bate o tambor
Eu quero é tic, tic, tic, tic, tac

Do you really wanna know?
'Bout the boy from my show
Yes, I wanna know
'Bout the boy from my show

Do you really, really wanna know?
'Bout the boy from my show
Yes, I wanna know
'Bout the boy from my show

It's about that time for us to get down
Hips off the ground, work it all around
Don't be afraid to bend your knees
And do what you please (down)

Bate bate o tambor
Eu quero é tic, tic, tic, tic, tac
Bate bate o tambor
Eu quero é tic, tic, tic, tic, tac

Bate bate o tambor
Eu quero é tic, tic, tic, tic, tac
Bate bate o tambor
Eu quero é tic, tic, tic, tic, tac

I was gone Caribbean nightlife
All was right for falling in love
Come on and sing with me
Come on and dance with me
Now it's time for falling in love

Bate bate o tambor
Eu quero é tic, tic, tic, tic, tac
Bate bate o tambor
Eu quero é tic, tic, tic, tic, tac

I was gone Caribbean nightlife
All was right for falling in love
Come on and sing with me
Come on and dance with me
Now it's time for falling in love

I see you're dancing up a storm
In the club with your friends
Get it straight, we're lifting off
Yo, peep me dance
Since you like to get off
When the music gets turnt
And I was thinking to myself
"Hmm, what I could do with that?"
My king wears a crown
I love the way you break it down
And it wouldn't surprise me
If he got around
It's all good, boo, I like your style
So let's chill for a while

Bate bate o tambor
Bate bate o tambor
Bate bate o tambor
Eu quero é tic, tic, tic, tic, tac
Bate bate o tambor
Eu quero é tic, tic, tic, tic, tac

I was gone Caribbean nightlife
All was right for falling in love
Come on and sing with me
Come and dance with me
Now it's time for falling in love

Is it that time for us to get down?
Yes, it's time for us to get down
Is it really that time for us to get down?
Yes, it's time for us to get down

Now, la-di-da-di
We like to party
Who like to party?
We like to party
Now, la-di-da-di
We like to party
Who likes to party?
We like to party

Bate bate o tambor
Eu quero é tic, tic, tic, tic, tac
Bate bate o tambor
Eu quero é tic, tic, tic, tic, tac

Bate bate o tambor
Eu quero é tic, tic, tic, tic, tac
Bate bate o tambor
Eu quero é tic, tic, tic, tic, tac
