		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah I pray you don’t forget me
I can’t rush perfection so just call me when you ready
She ain’t sending screenshots girl she talking cause she petty
Please don’t hang the phone up you’re the only one who get me
Are you ready for the hard times ready for the change?
Ready for the money and the power and the fame
Are you ready for the fake love, fake smiles
Fake people acting like they helping you for own personal gain
Conversations with my shawty like iv been stressed
I been working hella hard for this I need rest
Always be careful who you telling all your secrets
Cause all the wounds close range are the deepest
Yeah I gotta hold it down I gotta do it for the set
Shout out to my niggas treating women with respect
I’m seeing all the people I looked up to in the flesh
I know I’m next, and if I win I’m finna win until the end
I see these niggas firing their shots tryna vex me I know they envy me
But I don’t fire shots at niggas who ain’t a threat to me
Working so hard all my enemies give respect to me
Matching watch pieces and they each sold separately
I don’t write fast but I wright right
Yes I still connect to public wifi
And every time I walk into the store I know the options are galore
But it’s still something that I might buy
She that I’m ready soon as you say I’m ready
And I want you to focus but I’m scared that you’ll forget me
Yeah I pray you don’t forget me
I can’t rush perfection so just call me when you ready
She ain’t sending screenshots girl she talking cause she petty
Please don’t hang the phone up you’re the only one who get me
