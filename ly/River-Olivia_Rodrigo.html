		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's comin' on Christmas, they're cuttin' down trees
They're puttin' up reindeer and singin' songs of joy and peace
Oh, I wish I had a river
I could skate away on
But it don't snow here, it stays pretty green
I'm gonna make a lot of money then I'm gonna quit this crazy scene
Oh, I wish I had a river
I could skate away on

I wish I had a river so long
I would teach my feet to fly
Oh, I wish I had river
I could skate away on
I made my baby cry

He tried hard to help me, you know, he put me at ease
And he loved me so naughty, made me weak in the knees
Oh, I wish I had a river
I could skate away on
I'm so hard to handle, I'm selfish and I'm sad
Now I've gone and lost the best baby that I ever had
Oh, I wish I had a river
I could skate away on

I wish I had river so long
I would teach my feet to fly
Oh, I wish I had a river
I could skate away on
I made my baby say goodbye

It's comin' on Christmas, they're cuttin' down trees
They're puttin' up reindeer and singin' songs of joy and peace
Oh, I wish I had a river
I could skate away on
