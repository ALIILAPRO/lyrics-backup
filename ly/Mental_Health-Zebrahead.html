		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let's go

The lights are on but there is no one home
Yeah, I'm the type of guy that shouldn't be left alone
They say just one more night of observation
There's nothing like a permanent vacation

I break down like you want me to
But I will not give control to you
Sniff like a pound of glue
Forget all the things you'll put me through

Dial up the residue
Now I'm nuts, just like a blue cashew
I go psycho, psycho
Psycho, psycho

And all I want is to go home just for a bit
But these padded rooms are the shit

Whoa, I'm happy in my mental health
Whoa, these conversations with myself
Whoa, they say that only time will tell
Whatever I'm happy in my mental health
I'm happy in my mental health

1, 2, 1, 2, 3, go

Hey, meet a friend of mine, now where'd he go?
He's probably sitting there but you would never know
They say just one more shock, try not to resist
They say lie down and bite on this

You let the shocks away
But the voices in my head are here to stay
No bullshit tests today
I get more drugs than the DEA

One day they'll do a play
They take your shoelaces away
We go psycho, psycho
Psycho, psycho

And all I want is to go home just for a bit
But these padded rooms are the shit

Whoa, I'm happy in my mental health
Whoa, these conversations with myself
Whoa, they say that only time will tell
Whatever I'm happy in my mental health

Straitjacket, bad habit
'Cause I live for the havoc
This static, illmatic
Double dose is just like magic

Straight jacket, let's have it
You pump up all my panic
Welcome, this is my life
A padded room up in the attic

And all I want is to go home just for a bit
But these padded rooms are the shit

Whoa, I'm happy in my mental health
Whoa, these conversations with myself
Whoa, they say that only time will tell
Whatever I'm happy in my mental health

Psycho, psycho
I'm happy in my mental health
Psycho, psycho
I'm happy in my mental health

Psycho, psycho
I'm happy in my mental health
Psycho, psycho
I'm happy in my mental health
