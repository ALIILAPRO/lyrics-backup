		  What you gonna do? You wanna get down?
Tell me, what you gonna do? Do you wanna get down?
What you gonna do? You wanna get down?
What you gonna do? You wanna get down? Tell me

Get down on it, get down on it
Get down on it, get down on it, come on and
Get down on it, get down on it
Get down on it, get down on it

How you gonna do it if you really don't want to dance
By standing on the wall?
(Get your back up off the wall) Tell me
How you gonna do it if you really don't wanna dance
By standing on the wall? Get your back up off the wall

'Cause I heard all the people sayin'
Get down on it, come on and
Get down on it, if you really want it
Get down on it, you gotta feel it
Get down on it, get down on it
Get down on it, come on and 
Get down on it, baby, baby
Get down on it, get on it
Get down on it

I say people (what?) What you gonna do?
You gotta get on the groove
If you want your body to move, tell me, baby

How you gonna do it if you really don't want to dance
By standing on the wall? 
(Get your back up off the wall) Tell me
How you gonna do it if you really won't take a chance
By standing on the wall? Get your back up off the wall
'Cause I heard all the people sayin'

Get down on it, get down on it, get down on it
Get down on it, when you're dancin'
Get down on it, get down on it
Get down on it
Get down on it, get down on it
Get down on it, come on and
Get down on it, baby, baby 
Get down on it, get on it
Get down on it, sha-baba-daba-doo

What you gonna do? (Uh) Do you wanna get down? (Ah)
What you gonna do? (Uh, ah)
Get your back up off the wall
Dance, come on, get your back up off the wall
Dance, come on

Get down on it, come on and
Get down on it, if you really want it
Get down on it, you gotta feel it
Get down on it, get down on it
Get down on it, come on and
Get down on it, get down on it
Get down on it, while you're dancin'
Get down on it, get down on it
Get down on it, get down on it
Get down on it, ooh yeah
Get down on it, you move me baby, when you move
Get down on it, get down on it
Get down on it, get down on it
Get down on it, get down on it
Get down on it, get down on it
Get down on it, get your back up the wall
Get down on it, get down on it
