		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You got a bad reputation in my neighborhood 
You drive me mad with temptation 'cause it tastes so good 
You know I wouldn't walk away, even if I could 
It took one night, one try, ayy 
Damn, I'm hooked

You were there when I was low, you held me high 
And baby when you take control, we can go all night 
Every single place we go, you start a fight 
But then you kiss my neck, and take a bite 

Everybody says I'm sleeping with the enemy 
I don't even care if you're gonna be the death of me, me, me 

You got a bad reputation in my neighborhood 
You drive me mad with temptation 'cause it tastes so good 
You know I wouldn't walk away, even if I could 
It took one night, one try, ayy 
Damn, I'm hooked 

Ooh, I'm hooked 
Ooh, I'm hooked 

I know that I shouldn't touch but you twist my heart 
'Cause I can never get enough once the feeling starts 
Baby, I'm the gasoline and your kiss is the spark 
But you take the wheel and crash my car 

Everybody says I'm sleeping with the enemy 
I don't even care if you're gonna be the death of me, me, me 

You've got a bad reputation in my neighborhood 
You drive me mad with temptation 'cause it tastes so good 
You know I wouldn't walk away, even if I could 
It took one night, one try, ayy 
Damn, I'm hooked 
 
Ooh, I'm hooked 
Ooh, I'm hooked

You got me under your influence 
I swear I'm never gonna give you up, up, up, up, up, up, up 

You got a bad reputation in my neighborhood 
You drive me mad with temptation 'cause it tastes so good 
You know I wouldn't walk away, even if I could 
It took one night, one try, ayy 
Damn, I'm hooked 

Ooh, I'm hooked 
Ooh, I'm hooked, oh
