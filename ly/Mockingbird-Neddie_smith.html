		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now hush, little baby, don't you cry Everything's gonna be alright
It's different that a burly bop, little lady I told ya, daddy's here
I'm takin' Greece for a ransom, grandpa
I know mommy's not here right now And we don't know why

We fear how we feel inside It may seem a little crazy, little baby
But I promise mama's gon' be alright
I don't wanna rap for the time, it's long I say how I feel, it just happens to rhyme
I thought my problems were goin' I got me some money, this ain't what I had in my mind

I've been in the States for a month Now I'm hearin' my dog say I've left him behind
She give me head on a flight when we land The clock go back, I'm ahead of my time
O-sixteen, OG told me I should be in the trap But I'm rappin' instead, done it again
Half past ten, just made me a ten, they ain't got a bit

Hunting there, but I run out of lead One cool mate, broski, blimey your head
We the ones putting up, that's not them They got more money than cents
Don't let that hand of you in my system I'll get your body, next day I forget it
Nigga, Dre just caught a body And that's on the gang, nigga, I was just with him

We all my realin' niggas, all my villain niggas All my killin' niggas out the caves
Since a youngin' nigga, I've been drillin' niggas But I'm sorry I'm stuck up in my ways
Ain't nobody ever gave me shit With this big tip, I had to get paid
And it's time, Gator, go and stay And you know the streets gettin' laid

Baby, welcome to the party I'm off the money, it's in the league
That's why I'm over-retarded That's why I'm over-retarded
Baby, welcome to the party I hit the boy up and then I go skate in the Rory
Baby, welcome to the party

I don't wanna rap for the time, it's long I say half floor, it just happens to rhyme
I fought my problems with Bo and I got me some money This ain't what I had in my mind
I've been in the States for a month Now I'm here and my dawg say I've left him behind
She give me head on a flight when we land The clock go back, I'm ahead of my time

O-sixteen, OG told me I should be in the trap But I'm rappin' instead, done it again
Half past ten, just made me a ten, they go out of bed
Hunting there, boy, run out of lead One cool mate, pussy, plumb out your head
We the ones puttin' on, bless not them They got more money than sex

Ayy, I don't cop things for resale Don't do iCloud, don't do email
Feds wanna pop up man and wild Man like Chubbs, the detail
Back when Ricky was doin' up Teasdale I was doin' dinner with Teensy
I didn't trust no one, swore I got lined He just got too breezy

Knee cold, never move, knee key Sweat suit, Nike, sweat suit, DG
If man get beaky, ring ring, call up GG
Dorm, I'm neatly Used to look up to a man from certain
Ends with the short on the repeat Thought he was a bad boy then

Till a man got pinched and man went PC Man went PC just like Della and Windows
Some man been those Before I was ever around Kendo's
I was in Enzo, dreamin' up Enzo's The woman I do end up with
Has to be a bag out just like Munchie Can't have no pretentious thing

When I know this shit gets bumpy
I don't wanna rap for the time it's long I say how I feel, it just happens to rhyme
I thought my problems would go when I got me some money
This ain't what I had in my mind I've been in the States for a month

Now I'm here and my dawgs say I've left them behind
She give me head on a flight when we land The clock go back, I'm ahead of my time
0-6-8-O-G told me I should be in the trap But I'm rappin' instead
Done it again, 4 plus 10 Just made me a 10, they ain't got a blimp

Hunting there by runner left One cool mate, pussy, plumb out your head
We the ones putting on West, not them They got more money than cents
Little bitch, little baby, don't you cry Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffened up, curled up up, little lady I told ya, daddy's here to hold ya

Through the night
