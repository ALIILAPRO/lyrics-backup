		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  See'est la vie
Have your leaves all turned to brown
Will you scatter them around you
See'est la vie

Do you love
And then how am I to know
If you don't let your love show for me
See'est la vie

In the night
Do you light a lover's fire
Do the ashes of desire for you remain

Like the sea
There's a love too deep to show
Took a storm before my love flowed for you
See'est la vie

Like a song
Out of tune and out of time
All I needed was a rhyme for you
See'est la vie

Do you give
Do you live from day to day
Is there no song I can play for you
See'est la vie
