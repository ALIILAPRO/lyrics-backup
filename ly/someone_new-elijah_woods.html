		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I miss the way we touch when we started to fall in love
No, I couldn't get enough of you
In the backseat of my truck, looking back when we were young
Nothing else would matter, just us two

But the years pass too fast
Where did this love go, oh?

'Cause I bet it all on us, running out of chances
Hate it, but I knew all along
That you're stealing all my love, holding it for ransom
Baby, it's alright we were wrong
It's got me like, "Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh"
I know that we'll both find someone new 
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh)
I know that we'll both find someone new

I've got this heaviness in my chest, and my head is still a mess
'Cause I know what comes next with you
Summer nights I won't forget but I guess it's for the best
'Cause we know better than to fight the truth (oh-oh, ooh-woo)

But the years pass too fast
Where did this love go, oh?

'Cause I bet it all on us, running out of chances
Hate it, but I knew all along
That you're stealing all my love, holding it for ransom
Baby, it's alright we were wrong
It's got me like
I know that we'll both find someone new 

Sleepless, do I ever cross your mind?
What went wrong in between you and I?
Maybe we were broken by design
Broken by design

'Cause I bet it all on us, running out of chances
Hate it, but I knew all along (all along)
That you're stealing all my love, holding it for ransom
Baby, it's alright we were wrong
It's got me like
I know that we'll both find someone new
I know that we'll both find someone new
