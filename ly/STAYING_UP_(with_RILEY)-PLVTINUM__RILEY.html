		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do whatever you say
Get lost in the duvet
Staying up, staying up, uh

Two more Addies in the back of a taxi
Ten more minutes till we're
Out of the backseat
Didn't think it was that hard
'til you asked me
"Are you okay or falling apart?"
I don't really know anymore
'Cause I've been mixing up with blow
And I swore that I would never act like you
Or any bitch that I ran through, yeah, yeah
Out the taxi and we're into the room
My plug is in the tanker
You just hitting my phone
I know you know what you're doing
So I'm gonna smoke it alone
Now I'm finna sleep with you
In my row, yeah
Yeah
If you ask me, my other bitch is texting
But she trashy
I know you wanna sit in, just ask me
Or head out to the condo in the valley

Do whatever you say
Get lost in that duvet
Staying up, staying up
Wrapped up in that new bae
Why don't you remove it?
Staying up, staying up

You say it's something that
You really wanna do
I never really wanted anyone but you, baby
The way it feels when we groove, baby
I, ninety down the freeway
Didn't make it past the foyer
Staying up, staying up, staying up
Staying up with me
With me
Just stay up with me

Twenty-two attitude on a Friday
Put my record on her story and she tagged me
She said "for the record, if you want me
You can have me"
(Have me, have me, if you want me
You can have me)
III don't even know who you are
But we can get acquainted in
The backseat of my car
Ninety down the three oh-two
But I can't keep my eyes off you
Said you love my music
I said "is that a fact?"
'Cause you wouldn't know a title of
A song in my past
She said "this is crazy, don't overreact"
But I got a little movie
We should reenact, yeah
Yeah
If you ask me
The jewels around my neck are kinda flashy
They'd look better with you
Wrapped around me
Let's skip the conversation, baby, shall we?

Do whatever you say
Get lost in that duvet
Staying up, staying up
Wrapped up in that new bae
Why don't you remove it?
Staying up, staying up

You say it's something that
You really wanna do
I never really wanted anyone but you, baby
The way it feels when we groove, baby
I, ninety down the freeway
Didn't make it past the foyer
Staying up, staying up, staying up
Staying up with me
With me
Just stay up with me, with me

Just stay up with me
