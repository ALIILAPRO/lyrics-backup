		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So this is Christmas
And what have you done
Another year over
A new one just begun

And so this is Christmas
I hope you have fun
The near and the dear ones
The old and the young

A very merry Christmas 
And a happy New Year
Let's hope it's a good one 
Without any fears

And so this is Christmas 
For weak and for strong
The rich and the poor ones
The war is so long

And so happy Christmas 
For black and for white
For yellow and red ones 
Let's stop all the fights

A very merry Christmas 
And a happy New Year
Let's hope it's a good one 
Without any fears

And so this is Christmas 
And what have we done
Another year over
A new one just begun

And so happy Christmas
We hope you have fun
The near and the dear ones
The old and the young

(A very merry Christmas)
A very merry Christmas
(And a happy New Year)
Ooh, oh
(Let's hope it's a good one)
It's a good, it's a good one
Without any fear

And so this is Christmas 
And what have we done
Another year over
A new one just begun
