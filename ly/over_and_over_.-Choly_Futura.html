		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Moments they pass, you're going to last
Broke my wrist, Used my watch as a cast
The clock don't even move, the hands follow my path
It never truly healed, I wallow in cash
And stuff in paraphernalia, I know you're paranoid of failure
Look back at the trauma and question did your parents now fail ya ?
Over and over again, I'm tired of the fake charisma
Meaningless conversations why you been so distant?
Maybe it been me who really just won't listen
Everything you inspired you won't ever hear my vision

I lost track of time, pride wouldn't let me speak, So I was pantomime
Attention Seeker, just so you get a glimpse of mine
Sleepless nights, I met Luna sometimes
Meaningful conversations up late, better than vacation
Connection, it feel you ain't really been so vacant
Maybe you can show me more than these faceless faces
If I stepped over the gates here, maybe we can talk bout heavenly places
Have you mentioned me lately?
You've been a recurring theme, It's barely been a few weeks
Why does this mean this much to me, that's the problem with me
Dreaming in Dreams, Making more than what it seeming to be
Rewrite my words, just so I can keep a piecing of these
Memories that constantly bleed, black Rainbows what they meaning to me?
