Damn, girl
Where you learn to do all that?
Ayy, can I tell you something? Listen

Girl, the sex was crazy (crazy)
Better yet amazing (amazing)
Don't be sad (don't be sad)
I ain't going nowhere (going nowhere)
Let's just lay and talk (lay and talk)
Girl, I know you feel it (feel it)
This chemistry that we got (we got)
So don't be shy (don't be shy)
I ain't going nowhere (going nowhere)
I'm here for the night (for the night)

So move closer, bring your body to mine
Let me hold you right (hold you right)
Don't be mad (don't be mad)
I ain't going nowhere (going nowhere)
I'ma sleep here by your side (by your side)

You probably think I'm shady, girl, I know, but I
Ain't gon' fuckin' bounce (fuckin' bounce)
I'm feeling you, I wanna get to know you so
Let's have pillow talk (pillow talk)

You probably think I'm shady, girl, I know, but I
Ain't gon' fuckin' bounce (fuckin' bounce)
I'm feeling you, I wanna get to know you so
Let's have pillow talk (pillow talk)

When I saw you after my show (after my show)
Your friends were acting like hoes (acting like hoes)
But you were different (you were different)
You weren't impressed (you weren't impressed)
By all my money (all my money)
Or fancy shit (fancy shit)
Girl, you're skin is so smooth (skin is so smooth)
And you smell good just like some new shoes 
(Just like my Bathing Apes)
I see you smiling (see you smiling)
Is that a sign (that a sign)
That you feeling me too? (me too)
Girl, I hope so

You probably think I'm shady, girl, I know, but I
Ain't gon' fuckin' bounce (fuckin' bounce)
I'm feeling you, I wanna get to know you so
Let's have pillow talk (pillow talk)

So move closer, bring your body to mine
Just like my Bathing Apes
