		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Heading home on the ocean road
Too much love in these hollow coves
You don’t ever want to see us go
We’ll be down in those hollow coves
That’s a ticket to the after show
Find a reason and just let go
Down and lost here
Down and lost here
You don’t ever want to see us go
We’ll be down in those hollow coves
That’s a ticket to the after show
Find a reason and just let go let go
Fell in love that day
Looking up at fate
As the sky turns golder
I turn to you
Now the nights are colder
But I’m next to you
Down and lost here
Down and lost here
You don’t ever want to see us go
We’ll be down in those hollow coves
That’s a ticket to the after show
Find a reason and just let go let go
You don’t ever want to see us go
We’ll be down in those hollow coves
