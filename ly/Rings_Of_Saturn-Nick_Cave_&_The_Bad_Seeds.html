		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Upside down and inside out and on all eights
You're like a funnel-web
Like a black fly on the ceiling
Skinny, white haunches high and skyward
And a black oily gash crawling backwards across the carpet to smash all over everything
Wet, black fur against the sun going down
Over the shops and the cars and the crowds in the town

And this is the moment, this is exactly where she is born to be (ooh ooh oh, ooh ooh oh)
Now this is what she does and this is what she is (ooh ooh oh, ooh ooh oh)
And this is the moment, this is exactly where she is born to be (ooh ooh oh, ooh ooh oh)
This is what she does and this is what she is (ooh ooh oh, ooh ooh oh)

Her eyes that look at me through her rainy hair
Two round holes where the air buckles and rushes in (ooh ooh oh, ooh ooh oh)
Her body, moon blue, was a jellyfish (ooh ooh oh, ooh ooh oh)
And I'm breathing deep and I'm there and I'm also not there (ooh ooh oh, ooh ooh oh)
And spurting ink over the sheets but she remains, completely unexplained 
Or maybe I'm just too tongue-tied to drink it up and swallow back the pain
I thought slavery had been abolished
How come it's gone and reared its ugly head again?

And this is the moment, this is exactly where she is born to be (ooh ooh oh, ooh ooh oh)
Now this is what she does and this is what she is (ooh ooh oh, ooh ooh oh)
And this is the moment, this is exactly where she is born to be (ooh ooh oh, ooh ooh oh)
This is what she is and this is what she does (ooh ooh oh, ooh ooh oh)

And this is the moment, this is exactly where she is born to be
Now this is what she does and this is what she is 
And this is the moment, this is exactly where she is born to be 
This is what she does and this is what she is 

And now she's jumping up with her leaping brain
Stepping over heaps of sleeping children (ooh ooh oh, ooh ooh oh)
Disappearing and further up and spinning out again
Up and further up she goes, up and out of the bed (ooh ooh oh, ooh ooh oh)
Up and out of the bed and down the hall where she stops for moment and turns and says
"Are you still here?" (ooh ooh oh, ooh ooh oh)
And then reaches high and dangles herself like a child's dream from the rings of Saturn
