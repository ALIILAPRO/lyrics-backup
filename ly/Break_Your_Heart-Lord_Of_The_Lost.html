		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You must break your heart

Don't you think I'm sorry
I'm scheming and so cold
I have lost my conscience
But I never lose control

If you fall in love
Don't give me your heart
But if you do so still
You must break your heart
Don't lay it in my hands
'Cause I will break your heart
Don't you understand? I will be your end

I can deal with pieces i can deal with parts
But don't you give me everything
Don't you go so far

If I touch you fondly don't give in to me
But if you do so still

You must break your heart
Don't lay it in my hands
'Cause I will break your heart
Don't you understand?

You must break your heart
Don't lay it in my hands
'Cause I will break your heart
Don't you understand? I will be your end
You must break your heart
Don't lay it in my hands
'Cause I will break your heart
Don't you understand?

You must break your heart
Don't lay it in my hands
'Cause I will break your heart
Don't you understand?

You must break your heart
Don't lay it in my hands
'Cause I will break your heart
Don't you understand?

I will be your end (If you fall in love)
I will be your end
(Don't give me your heart)
I will be your end (If you fall in love)
Don't you understand?
(Don't give me your heart)
I will be your end
