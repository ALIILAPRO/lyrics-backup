		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I toss and turn
All summer long
The days go fast
They're nearly gone
You walk into the room
I just got to know
Are you
What I've
Been waiting for?
You make me wanna sin
I know you feel it too
I wanna spend a
Hot Summer Night
With you
I want you skin to skin
I feel your every move
I wanna spend a
Hot Summer Night
With you (you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you)
I wanna spend a
Hot Summer Night
With you
I wanna spend a
Hot Summer Night
With you

I wanna spend a
Hot Summer Night
With you

I wanna spend a
Hot Summer Night
With you
Your look is so
Mysterious
Like it's making up
For wasted love
When the sun's going down
It's the two of us
It is you
That I've
Been waiting for?
You make me wanna sin
I know you feel it too
I wanna spend a
Hot Summer Night
With you
I want you skin to skin
I feel your every move
I wanna spend a
Hot Summer Night
With you (you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you)
I wanna spend a
Hot Summer Night
With you
I wanna spend a
Hot Summer Night
With you

I wanna spend a
Hot Summer Night
With you

I wanna spend a
Hot Summer Night
With you
