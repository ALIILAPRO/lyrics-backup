		  (This a Hood Famous production)
(Go Grizz)
(Winners Circle)

I still got family in the hood, this shit for real
And I swear they on my mind when I'm off them pills
Only thing on they mind, go and kill
Told my granny I can't deny, gotta pay her bills
She said I'm the reason for his death, it gave me chills
I thought my life was supposed to change when I got that deal
So this is how it feel (yeah), this is how it feel

Niggas' vibes different, you even smile different
I even fall out with the niggas that I know'll ride with me
I lost cousins to these streets, it make my high different
I left Ikey around some pounds when the job missing
I put my bitch on JetSmarter, she even fly different
Thirty pair of Amiri jeans, I say my fly different
Even though I'm rich, I'm still not 'round, so all my guys trippin'
I know y'all miss me, I miss y'all too, but I'm out the Chi with it
Whoever thought the bitch we slept around was scandalous
If you gon' cheat on him, don't cheat on him with the fellas
I'm around millionaires, I'ma change, let them tell it
Everybody around me gang, we rebellious

I still got family in the hood, this shit for real
And I swear they on my mind when I'm off them pills
Only thing on they mind, go and kill
Told my granny I can't deny, gotta pay her bills
She said I'm the reason for his death, it gave me chills
I thought my life was supposed to change when I got that deal
So this is how it feel (yeah), this is how it feel

A lot of nights I be smiling, but I still be so lonely
Deedee my roadie, so I'ma know how he feel if he lose his motion
Nowadays, you ask a nigga for a favor, he gon' think you owe him
Shit built in me since 2012, you play and I'ma show 'em
They'll bust your brain, you think I'm playin', you better tuck your chain
Nowadays they goin' off the murders, they don't go off names
But let a nigga play with me, his life gon' go in flame
They say I got some kids out right now that I do not claim
I know I don't so, lil' bitch, chill, you steady chasing fame
I'm tryna figure out why you squeal and got a big name
Take my pain, my pain away, away, away, away

I still got family in the hood, this shit for real
And I swear they on my mind when I'm off them pills
Only thing on they mind, go and kill
Told my granny I can't deny, gotta pay her bills
She said I'm the reason for his death, it gave me chills
I thought my life was supposed to change when I got that deal
So this is how it feel (yeah), this is how it feel
