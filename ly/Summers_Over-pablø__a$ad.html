		<p>
		  Look
Come spend the night up
Ay Ima get you right up
Reignite ya
I Re-invite ya when summers over
I get colder
I keep wishing you were here

So won’t you lie ah ah ah I
Here by my side
Ima get you turning up
I want you here tonight
So won’t you lie ah ah ah I
Wont you lie by my side
Wont you lie ah ah ah
I ah I ah I ah oh

Let it be one time
Let it be one night
Let me see you one time
Now shit ain’t right
Got a girl back home that’s mine
I need you and oh I love how you
Let me down how you let me down girl
Oh oh oh yeah yeah
Damn she got me faded
Face it I’m thinking wishing you loved me
Got me saying Il make It
I hate it cause you don’t trust me
no I see you running again
Nah she run it for me
She running from me
Go and put that on me

Take it off for me again
Cause baby we are more than friends
Do it all over again
Over and over yeah

Come spend the night up
Ay Ima get you right up
Reignite ya
I Re-invite ya when summers over
I get colder
I keep wishing you were here

So won’t you lie ah ah ah I
Here by my side
Ima get you turning up
I want you here tonight
So won’t you lie ah ah ah I
Wont you lie by my side
Wont you lie ah ah ah
I ah I ah I ah oh

Ain’t no city lights lonely nights
Hit that club in minus 45
Ain’t home at night only right
It’s only right I’m getting high just
To get me by you know I tried
Nah but tell me who you chasing
Tell me I’m invasive
Tell me how it gon change oh
But I ain’t see a change yet
When summers over I get colder
I keep wishing you were here

So won’t you lie ah ah ah
Here by my side
Ima get you turning up
I want you here tonight
So won’t you lie ah ah ah
Wont you lie by my side
Wont you lie ah ah ah
I ah I ah I ah oh
