		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I haven't been eating
I can't seem to sleep and
I hate to admit that I'm really not okay
I'd ask how you're doing
But you're probably happy
And if that's the case
I wouldn't know what to say
I did this to myself
And now I feel like hell
You let me go so easy
You never fought to keep me
You did this to yourself
I hope you feel like hell
For leaving me so easy
Why was it so easy
It doesn't affect you
You're not sad about it
The joke was on me for how easily you moved on
You don't ask how I'm doing
I'm out here assuming
You don't really care
You're happier now that I'm gone
I did this to myself
And now I feel like hell
You let me go so easy
You never fought to keep me
You did this to yourself
I hope you feel like hell
For leaving me so easy
Why was it so easy
I did this to myself
I know that I need to
Get on without you
But how do I stop
Electricity in my veins
I feel the pressure
The need to get better
But when I am cured
I'll still hold onto the pain
I did this to myself
And now I feel like hell
You let me go so easy
You never fought to keep me
You did this to yourself
I hope you feel like hell
For leaving me so easy
Why was it so easy
I did this to myself
And now I feel like hell
You let me go so easy
You never fought to keep me
You did this to yourself
I hope you feel like hell
For leaving me so easy
Why was it so easy
I did this to myself
And tell me how it feels to be stuck
Between the things you broke and things you messed up
If I'm the queen of tears you're the king of lies
Cause if you wanted it you would've tried
And tell me how it feels to be stuck
Between the things you broke and things you messed up
If I'm the queen of tears you're the king of lies
Cause if you wanted it you would've tried
