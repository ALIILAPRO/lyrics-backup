Where are my African queens at
It’s about potential in the princess see your king’s back
See king knows what good thing when he meet that
And know she God sent
So there are ready to receive that
You know the one with dark skin
And don’t bleach that
Pray so much that they have bruises
On their knee caps
And in the bedroom they show you
Where the freaks at
When the loving takes you higher
Than an emergency drug see that
She makes her own Gs
Get her own B plan
But her self esteem is at work
Best believe that
Still you give her the world
If you can be right
And when she cooks good Lord
It’s a fish jack
Friends first then lovers
That’s the key man
If she trust you go ahead
Take a leap chap
Now if a man gat you sprung
It’s a wrap
Now give this to my kings and queens

Omode yi ragabomi o
Mofe no wo
It's your birthday ragabomi o
Mofe no wo
Omode yi sheru bawon se o
Mofe no wo
It's your birthday ragabomi o yeah
