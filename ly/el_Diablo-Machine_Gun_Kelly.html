		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ronny J, please turn me up

Tell all my competition that I love 'em
But I brought 'em back just to kill 'em again
Tell all the listeners that I said, "Fuck 'em"
If they thought I'd never be breathing again
I keep some drink in the cup
In case anyone got some more beef, I can eat 'em again
I made a promise to beat they ass up
Like Adonis, survive, I'll meet 'em again

Fuck your big bro, uh
We the ones that got it when the rent's low
I make it happen again
I'm back to rappin' again, 808s slappin' again
Light it and pass it again
Know what I'm packin' again, I'm an assassin again

I shoot dice, yeah, gamble with my life, yeah
No invites, yeah, keep my circle tight, yeah
All my hoes, yeah, keep that sugar spice, yeah
For the bros, yeah, I do not think twice, yeah

I got a combination to a safe in the back of the bank that be storing my shit
Just had a conversation with a girl that I dated, now she out here whoring and shit
I got a reputation to be doing and showing up 4 in the morning and shit
I had a altercation down in Florida, I threw his face on the floor in the shit

Fuck a bitch, though, huh
Y'all ain't want us before we rich, ho
I can't go back to this shit
I need a castle and shit, I'm on some Dracula shit
I used to have to heat up pans of water to shower
But y'all don't know half of this shit, no

I shoot dice, yeah, gamble with my life, yeah
No invites, yeah, keep my circle tight, yeah
All my hoes, yeah, keep that sugar spice, yeah
For the bros, yeah, I do not think twice, yeah

Diablo
Stop the debate if my name isn't mentioned
In this generation as one of the greatest
From lyrics to cadence, I changed the way rappers rock out on them stages
I saw people take it, and they are more famous
So I ain't get credit, I had to be patient
I know people hate me just by my appearance
You motherfuckers can't be serious, ayy

I shoot dice, yeah, gamble with my life, yeah
No invites, yeah, keep my circle tight, yeah
All my hoes, yeah, keep that sugar spice, yeah
For the bros, yeah, I do not think twice, yeah
I shoot dice, yeah, gamble with my life, yeah
No invites, yeah, keep my circle tight, yeah
All my hoes, yeah, keep that sugar spice, yeah
For the bros, yeah, I do not think twice, yeah

Diablo
(Diablo)

The last album was like a year and a half ago?
Yeah, 2016
Yeah, oh wow
'17
Oh, okay, yeah, yeah
You've had a whole lotta shit happen in between then
Yeah, a whole lotta shit
