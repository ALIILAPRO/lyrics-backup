		  [Kazy Lambist x5]
You make me boogie in my head
I'm just chubby in your head, son

I enjoy swimming in the Hudson
Let's go naked don't need no option

[LC Elo x2]
You make me boogie in my head
I'm just chubby in your head, son
I enjoy swimming in the Hudson
Let's go naked don't need no option

[Kazy Lambist]
Oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah

[Kazy Lambist, LC Elo x2]
I am just swimming in the Hudson
Let's go naked don't need no options

[Kazy Lambist]
You make me boogie in my head
I'm just chubby in your head, son
I enjoy swimming in the Hudson
Let's go naked don't need no option

[LC Elo]
You make me boogie in my head
I'm just chubby in your head, son
I enjoy swimming in the Hudson
Let's go naked don't need no option

[Kazy Lambist]
 You make me boogie in my head
I'm just chubby in your head, son
I enjoy swimming in the Hudson
Let's go naked don't need no option
