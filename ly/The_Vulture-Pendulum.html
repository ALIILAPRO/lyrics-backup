		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's the rise of the vulture,
I'm feeling the panic
All those who are nervous,
With loss of dynamic
If your pride's been poisoned,
If your heart is sour
Hear the sound of the war drums,
We're taking the power

(We're taking the power
We're taking the power!
(We're taking the power)

It's the rise of the vulture,
Gonna keep on climbing
No chance of escape,
No use in hiding
Into the eye of the storm,
With the silver lining
To the point where it breaks,
Gonna keep on grinding

(We're taking the power)
We're taking the power
(We're taking the power)

Overboard
Under pressure
Overboard
Under pressure
Overboard
Under pressure
Overboard
Under pressure

We're taking the power
(We're taking the power)
We're taking the power
(We're taking the power)
We're taking the power
(We're taking the power)
We're taking the power
(We're taking the power)
