		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Given all the silence
I could see the sky was taking its place
If we're giving it all a title
I'll concede I might've made a mistake

'Cause I feel love, throwing it all away
I'm sleepless

Seven years of verses, I guess that I deserve it
I made a mistake
So keep it on the surface
And tell me that was worth in all the ways that it would break

'Cause I feel love, throwing it all away
I'm sleepless, knowing you're all the same
How'd only I feel it?
How'd only I feel it?

It's taken all the ivy from your throat
Does it feel anymore like home?
I made the walk from Albany to Rome
But it feels there's nowhere more to go

'Cause I feel love, throwing it all away
I'm sleepless and tell me you're all same
How'd only I feel it
How'd only I feel it
How'd only I feel it
