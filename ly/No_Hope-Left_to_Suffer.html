		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You rid the earth one by one 

And in this moment I see the world and it’s fucking bleak 
Without a single doubt 
Where is the substance 
Incomplete as I’m bleeding out my lungs won’t make a sound 

Worthless 
my soul won’t love an inch without seeing you rot beneath the dirt 
I’m fucking bleeding out 
Where does the evidence start making differences in your fucking eyes 
It all points to you 

Seconds go by I can see them as they slip away 
My life is flashing an endless series of searing pain 
The only reason we’re alive is to die 
But death won’t ever look me in the eye. 

Silence 
fills the room as you suck away the breath of a tortured soul 
I would have never imagined 
It coming to close to home 

And in this moment I see the world and it’s fucking bleak 
Without a single doubt 
Where is the substance 
Incomplete as I’m bleeding out my lungs won’t make a sound 

I’m fucking bleeding out 
Without a single doubt, without a single doubt 
I’m fucking bleeding out 
My lungs won’t make a sound, my lungs won’t make a sound 

Consciousness leaking out through my open wound 
My thoughts are shattered like my broken body 
My eyes are open a pathetic attempt to see 
Trying desperately to find what’s left of me 

I never had a fucking choice 

The only reason we’re alive is to die
But death won’t ever look me in the eye
