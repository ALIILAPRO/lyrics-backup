		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You suck my blood like a leech
You break the law and you breach
Screw my brain 'til it hurts
You've taken all my money
And you want more
Misguided old mule with your pigheaded rules
With your narrow minded cronies
Who are fools of the first division

Death on two legs
You're tearing me apart
Death on two legs
You never had a heart of your own

Killjoy, bad guy, big talking small fry
You're just an old barrow boy
Have you found a new toy to replace me?
Can you face me?
But now you can kiss my ass goodbye

Feel good? Are you satisfied?
Do you feel like suicide?) (Think you should)
Is your conscience all right
Does it plague you at night?
Do you feel good? (Feel good)

(Ah) Talk like a big business tycoon
You're just a hot air balloon
So no one gives you a damn
You're just an overgrown schoolboy
Let me tan your hide
A dog with disease
You're the king of the sleaze
Put your money where your mouth is, Mister Know-All
Was the fin on your back
Part of the deal? (Shark) 

Death on two legs
Tearing me apart
Death on two legs
You never had a heart (you never did) 
Of your own (right from the start)

Insane, should be put inside
You're a sewer rat decaying in a cesspool of pride
Should be made unemployed
Then make yourself null and void
Make me feel good (I feel good)
