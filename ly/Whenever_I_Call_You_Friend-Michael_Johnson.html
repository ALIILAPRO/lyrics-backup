		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Whenever I call you friend
I begin to think I understand
Anything we are, you and I have always been
Ever and ever

I see myself within your eyes
And that's all I need to show me why
Everything I do always takes me home to you
Ever and ever

Now I know my life has given me more than memories
Day by day, we can see
In every moment there's a reason to carry on

Sweet love's showin' us a heavenly light
I've never seen such a beautiful sight
See love glowin' on us every night
I know forever we'll be doin' it right

Whenever I call you friend
I believe I've come to understand
Everywhere we are, you and I were meant to be
Ever and ever

I think about the times to come
Knowing I will be the lucky one
Ever our love will last
I always want to call you friend

Sweet love's showin' us a heavenly light
I've never seen such a beautiful sight
See love glowin' on us every night
I know forever we'll be doin' it right
