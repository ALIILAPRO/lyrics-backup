		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What is a man that stays true to the game
But has to cheat a little to get by
Well that's a person that I know too well
Don't want to know but I don't have to ask why
Everyone like a loaded gun
You want some shit I'll fuckin' pound you, son
Don't need a reason, pain I'm feelin'
I gotta vent or else I blow inside

Introspection, termination
Can't tell right from wrong
Fed up with this whole system
It's gone on far too long

You tell a thousand lies been told a thousand times
Your words we hear but we cannot sympathize
Thousand lies been told a thousand times
Hard as nails the power to survive

What's a man that stays true to the game
But can't believe some of the things he sees
Anger's a gift and I won't be kept down
In poverty there is no democracy
Used needle and a crack vile
A broken bottle and a bullet shell
This urban life is so volatile
An inner city or a concrete hell

Introspection, termination
Can't tell right from wrong
Fed up with this whole system
It's gone on far too long

You tell a thousand lies been told a thousand times
Your words we hear but we cannot sympathize
Thousand lies been told a thousand times
Hard as nails the power to survive

So pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, get up

What is a man don't stay true to the game
Don't care for no one, only cares for his greed
He's playin' God killin' thousands of people
'Cause the power is the fix that he needs
Racist goal of the white devil
I watched our soul burnin' over oil
A politician got no feelin'
It makes my motherfuckin' cold blood boil

Introspection, termination
Can't tell right from wrong
Fed up with this whole system
It's gone on far too long

You tell a thousand lies been told a thousand times
Your words we hear but we cannot sympathize
Thousand lies been told a thousand times
Hard as nails the power to survive

Slow
Slow
Slow
