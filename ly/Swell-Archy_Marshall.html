		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A new place to drown
(New place to drown)
(New place to drown)

Well, I might have found, a new place to drown my sorrows and everything else
Fuck, my mental health
Went down the drain as well
It burns in hell, but you can't tell, you just swell, you just swell, you just swell

Argh shit now what have I done
I may have fucked away the one true girl under the sun
You piercing in and out of life, oh how you live it free
But your tiny eye cannot see
Simple things, lies and deceit
But you live with me
As they live with me
And on delivery
They sing your symphony
Girl you go its a bit a simple of me
Why'd you dance simple of me

A new place to drown
(New place to drown)
(New place to drown)

See well, I might have found, a new place to drown my sorrows and everything else
Well, fuck my mental health
Went down to this world
To be burnin' in hell, but you can't tell, you just swell
