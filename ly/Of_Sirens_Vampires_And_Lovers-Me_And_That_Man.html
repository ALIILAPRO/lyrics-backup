		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I dreamt you were a siren
And you sang your strange songs to me
I felt a strange kind of magic
And dived into your deep black sea

She said, she said come
Come to me

I dreamt you were a vampire
You sank your sharp teeth into me
You wanted to be my one true love
For all of eternity

She said, she said come
Come to me
Come to me

She said, she said
Come to me

Then I dreamt you were my lover
And I lay between your silky legs
You held my head so tightly
I prayed that this moment would never end

She said, she said
Come to me
She said, she said
Come to me
Come to me

She said, she said
Come to me
