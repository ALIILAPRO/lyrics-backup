		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can anybody help me I'm outta plans
Guess I left my world in somebody's hands
I don't like to hurt but but everyone gets weak
Someone to rely on that's what I really need

Now here we stay its all that were worth
I've been through the pain and been dragged through the dirt
Whatever they tell you were bigger than words
I've been where your standing I know how it hurts
Let this be a song now and this be a day and we stand together well be okay
Because were survivors were making it work expecting the best when they hope for the worst

One love, this is the way we found
One love, even though they'll let you down
One love,nobody's perfect now
One love,don't let that hold you down

One love, lets stick together now
One love,we got to stand our ground
One love, its easy to believe in
One love, believe in you and me
One love

Now I cud try and fix this all by myself
But I know it'd turn out better if you help no one likes to hurt
But but everyone gets weak someone to rely on that's what everybody needs

Now here we stay its all that were worth
I've been thru the pain and been dragged thru the dirt
Whatever they tell you were bigger than words
I've been where your standing I know how it hurts
Let this be a song now and this be our day and we stand together well be okay
Because where survivors were making it work expecting the best when they hope for the worst

One love, this is the way we found
One love, even though they'll let you down
One love,nobody's perfect now
One love,don't let that hold you down

One love, lets stick together now
One love,we got to stand our ground
One love, its easy to believe in
One love, believe in you and me

One love its one love
I'm here to tell you its one love oh
One love said its one love
Sing with me one love
One love to be oh that's all we need
One love.
