		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Say good night
Cuz' this 45 tucked
Aim down sight
Imma drain that blood

Imma donate brains
To your car headrest
JFK
You don't need no vest

Bitch!

Fuck you and your sympathy
I just wanna die in peace
Fuck you and your sympathy
I just wanna die in peace
Fuck you and your sympathy
I just wanna die in peace
Fuck you and your sympathy
I just wanna die in peace

Givin a motherfucker what they need
Not what they want
They need to shut the fuck up
So their teeth is what I stomp

Watch him su su studder
When I'm changing up my tone
Dyll is the beheader
If you try to take my throne

Overthrown the lames
So now I'm at where I belong
He's blessed fuckin breathing
But he's not blessed for very long

Fuck you, your fa√ßade, is showing like its bomb
I'm blowing up like the taliban
Tally up all my arms
I'm constantly underfire
I'm wired to kill em all
You fuckers are petty liars
Imma purging em til I'm gone

You got a big ass forehead
Fuck you feelins im morbid
Runnin my church no Mormon
Tie him to the car and floor it
Kill a whole man and move on
Sippin that tea that oolong
Hate little kids like Kumon
Hole in yo head don't move wrong

Holo through his head if he talk about some goofy shit
Lay him down with lead hoe in a hooligan
Who again I'm the the nigga that would go and shoot again
Find where you stay burn your crib make you move again
I don't got no hobbies I prefer a little homicide
Fiddle with my fingers on the trigger pick out who to die
Should I hang him by the neck and frame a sudden suicide
Point the trigger to myself and try to figure who am I

Obviously probably a mufuckin prodigy
Hold the gun solemnly keep yo apology
Skin him to death and then watchin his body bleed
Killing that boy for a want and not just the need
When you with me make sure you talkin properly
You are not human to me you my property
Been a whole god so nobody is stoppin' me
Pastor pranav or at least call me father p

Kick from the k got my wrist feelin sore
I got holo after holo leave that boy on the floor
Imma kool aid man through the wall or a door
Put the knife to his head till he dead kill the whore

I don't got no hobbies I prefer a little homicide
Fiddle with my fingers on the trigger pick out who to die
Should I hang him by the neck and frame a sudden suicide
Point the trigger to myself and try to figure who am I
I don't know so I am slow el ey dying
Talk bout the smoke but you always just typing
Sharpen my nails but this world has been filing
Walk what I talk and bitch and I'm always smiling
