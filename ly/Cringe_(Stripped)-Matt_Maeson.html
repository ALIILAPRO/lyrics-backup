		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lover come over
Look what I done
I been alone so long
I feel like I'm on the run

Lover come over
Kick up the dust
I got a secret
Starting to rust

She said I'm looking like a bad man
Smooth criminal
She said my spirit doesn't move like it did before
She said that I don't look like me no more, no more
I said, "I'm just tired"
She said, "You're just high"

I said I saw you in the water
I said I saw you in the water

Lover come hold me
Heads on the fritz
Body intoxicated 
Feelings comfortably mixed
Lover come hold me
Could you forget?
I got a secret
Digging a ditch

She said I'm looking like a bad man
Smooth criminal
She said my spirit doesn't move like it did before
She said that I don't look like me no more, no more
I said, "I'm just tired"
She said, "You're just high"

I said I saw you in the water
I said I saw you in the water

Sweating all your sins out
Putting all your thoughts back together
Oh, we just don't blend out
All of my attempts seem to weather

Oh, I make you cringe now
Don't I make you cringe?
Oh, I make you cringe now
Don't I make you cringe?

She said I'm looking like a bad man
Smooth criminal
She said my spirit doesn't move like it did before
She said that I don't look like me no more, no more
I said, "I'm just tired"
She said I'm looking like a bad man
Smooth criminal
She said my spirit doesn't move like it did before
She said that I don't look like me no more, no more
I said, "I'm just tired"
She said, "You're just high"
I said I saw you in the water (do I make you cringe?)
I said I saw you in the water (do I make you cringe?)
I said I saw you in the water (do I make you cringe?)
I said I saw you in the water (do I make you cringe?)
