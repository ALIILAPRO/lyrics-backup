		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Feeling left out from the pack, you gotta go rogue
Five years from now, will this even matter? You hope
You don't know where to go
Construction every turn up on the road
Live life thinkin' why it's goin' so slow
Lookin' at the clock, wonderin' why mama's not home
You waited way too long
You noticin' a pattern in your home
Fuck all the good times, it's a past tense
I sleep and wake up when the world ends
Those memories, they so hard to forget
Question every day, "Are we there yet?"

Gone too far to change
Time to get your rollerblades
That smile is worth the wait
Here comes better days

All these thoughts I have in my head
Got me blinded from the sunset
I'm tryin' hard to stop the rain
'Cause smilin' doesn't feel the same
I just called to tell you, "Drive safe"
Will I see you in the mornin'?
'Cause I just wanna feel your touch
'Cause I don't think I had enough

The smiles turn to frowns quick
Need a break from night shifts
That's where the hours pass too slow
Leave no time to grow
My favorite things
Milk with cookies and cream
I swear, where did the good times go?
It don't show no more
Polaroid photos looking like a movie scene (ayy)
Thank you for the memories, I don't know what it means (ayy)
It's broken, don't know how to fix it, I need a minute
I never go away like a hiccup, I'm far from finished
Just made me happy, girl, I need it right now
A couple laughs and then I'm out the picture, sun down
This ain't the time to cry
We don't have much time

Gone too far to change
Time to get your rollerblades
That smile is worth the wait
Here comes better days

All these thoughts I have in my head
Got me blinded from the sunset
I'm tryin' hard to stop the rain
'Cause smilin' doesn't feel the same
I just called to tell you, "Drive safe"
Will I see you in the mornin'?
'Cause I just wanna feel your touch
'Cause I don't think I had enough
