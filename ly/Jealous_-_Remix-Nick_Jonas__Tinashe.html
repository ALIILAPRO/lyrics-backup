		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't like the way he's looking at you
I'm starting to think you want him too
Am I crazy? Have I lost ya?
Even though I know you love me, can't help it

I turn my chin music up
And I'm puffing my chest
I'm getting red in the face
You can call me obsessed
It's not your fault that they hover
I mean no disrespect
It's my right to be hellish
I still get jealous

'Cause you're too sexy, beautiful
And everybody wants a taste
That's why (that's why)
I still get jealous
'Cause you're too sexy, beautiful
And everybody wants a taste
That's why (that's why)
I still get jealous

I wish you didn't have to post it all
I wish you'd save a little bit just for me
Protective or possessive? Yeah
Call it passive or aggressive

I turn my chin music up
And I'm puffing my chest
I'm getting red in the face
You can call me obsessed
It's not your fault that they hover
I mean no disrespect
It's my right to be hellish
I still get jealous

'Cause you're too sexy, beautiful
And everybody wants a taste
That's why (that's why)
I still get jealous
'Cause you're too sexy, beautiful
And everybody wants a taste
That's why (that's why)
I still get jealous

We're the only ones invited (invited)
I said there's no one else for you (for you)
'Cause you know I get excited, yeah
When you get jealous too

I'll turn my chin music up
And I'm puffing my chest
I'm turning red in the face
You can call me obsessed
It's not your fault that they hover
I mean no disrespect
It's my right to be hellish
I still get jealous

'Cause you're too sexy, beautiful
And everybody wants a taste
That's why (that's why)
I still get jealous
'Cause you're too sexy, beautiful
And everybody wants a taste
That's why (that's why)
I still get jealous

Oh (that's why)
I still get jealous
Oh (that's why)
I still get jealous
