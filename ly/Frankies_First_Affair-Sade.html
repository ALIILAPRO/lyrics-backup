		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Frankie, didn't I tell you
You got the world in the palm of your hand?
Frankie, didn't I tell you
They're running at your command?
You know the tricks
As if they're your invention
It wasn't your intention Frankie
To fall in the trap you made

Ohh it's a crying shame, mmh
You left a trail of destruction
Heartbreaker you know now
They really did care 'cause it's your first affair

Frankie, didn't I tell you 
The lion would come in for the kill?
Frankie, didn't I say 
He had power over your sweet skill?

So where is the laughter
You spat right in their faces?
Didn't I tell you Frankie
That you might run out of races?

Ohh it's a crying shame, mmh
You couldn't win the game
Heartbreaker this time (this time)
It's your first affair

Frankie, Frankie's first affair (it's your turn to cry heartbreaker)
Frankie, Frankie's first affair
It's your turn to cry

It's a crying shame
Heartbreaker
You know now they really did care
'Cause it's your first affair

Frankie, Frankie's first affair
Frankie, Frankie's first affair

(It's your turn to cry, it's your turn to cry
(It's your turn to cry, it's your turn to cry)

Don't you realize 
They really, really, really did care?
The party's over, now you discover
It's your turn to cry

And don't you realize
Ooh, it's the toughest game
Yes it is, yes it is
The party's over, it's your turn to cry

Wha da an dee da do, wha da an dee da do
Mmh
Wha da an dee da do, wha da an dee da do
It's your first affair
