		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Your discretion
It's your discretion, yeah
Your discretion)
This my life, I'ma do what I want
Bank account on NBA, I'm sittin' courtside (yeah)
New one plastic, put some titties on a four-five
Talkin' to him 'fore his trial, pray he beat his charge
Call my phone, I ain't with the with the textin', I ain't C.J. Stroud

This a six-figure vehicle
Still park it on the front street
I'm a codeine drinker
She a Taylor Port junkie
Soon you touch down, pick a pill
I'm way higher than you
Heard you're tryna turn off fatigue
I'm gettin' tired of the usual
She keep livin' life off of memes, yeah
You don't even post none of you
Tell the waitress, "Don't forget the 19'"
All the pretty girls love '42

Where you been?
Coincidence I'm always in the same club that you in
I let you in
But you let me out the same door you came through
Wonder who else done got these recordings of you
Wonder who else done got these same portraits of you
Won't force it on you, no abortions on you
Head game cold, I put a North Face on you
They done doubted a nigga, I'm still up in the hood though I made it out this shit
You never felt money, I ain't see the drought, pull up like I committed
Shot niggas, hit the courtroom, have a lot to say
Been a minute since I brought this watch out so I'll be out the way
I done lost it all before, I know how it feels, for real
Tryna put a play together just to make sure that we all rich
Been knew I was the one, I come through rockin' Kapital
Get the baby wipes, I done filled the Goyard bag with dog shit (yeah, yeah)

This a six-figure vehicle
Still park it on the front street
I'm a codeine drinker
She a Taylor Port junkie
Soon you touch down, pick a pill
I'm way higher than you
Heard you're tryna turn off fatigue
I'm gettin' tired of the usual
She keep livin' life off of memes, yeah
You don't even post none of you
Tell the waitress, "Don't forget the 19'"
All the pretty girls love '42 (hmm)

Doggy trim, so they pulled him from the pin like grenade
All these hoes fake fruity like Minute Maid (yeah)
She turned box, she realize her ex-nigga had a pussy (hmm)
Cops pulled us over, I started sweatin', I had a fully 
I give you a million dollars worth of game like I'm Gillie
Invest a quarter at my tables, light his chairs like I'm chilly
At twelve o'clock, I had that shit goin' up like a wheelie (yeah)
Her and all her friends wanna fuck me off a P-P-P-P-P (damn)
Man, these niggas made you act just like an arcade (hmm)
Put a bad bitch in a Rolls and let her stargaze (yeah)
Took her out her jurisdiction like a cop chase (huh)
Fuck them niggas, what they on? I'm on a mission (the fuck?)
You think I treat my baby mama like I'm Tristan? (Damn)
They Twitter talkin, they treat life like a fiction
Everybody 'round me get to blitzin' (brrt)

This a six-figure vehicle
Still park it on the front street
I'm a codeine drinker
She a Taylor Port junkie
Soon you touch down, pick a pill
I'm way higher than you
Heard you're tryna turn off fatigue
I'm gettin' tired of the usual, oh
She keep livin' life off of memes, yeah
You don't even post none of you
Tell the waitress, "Don't forget the 19'"
All the pretty girls love 42
