		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's not her fault that she's so irresistible
But all the damage she's caused isn't fixable
Every twenty seconds you repeat her name
But when it comes to me you don't care
If I'm alive or dead

So objection, I don't wanna the be the exception
To get a bit of your attention
I love you for free and I'm not your mother
But you don't even bother

Objection, I'm tired of this triangle
Got dizzy dancing tango
I'm falling apart in your hands again
No way, I've got to get away

Next to her cheap silicone I look minimal
That's why in front of your eyes, I'm invisible
But you gotta know small things also count
You better put your feet on the ground
And see what it's about

So objection, I don't wanna the be the exception
To get a bit of your attention
I love you for free and I'm not your mother
But you don't even bother

Objection, the angles of this triangle
Got dizzy dancing tango
I'm falling apart in your hands again
No way, no no no no way

I wish there was a chance for you and me
I wish you couldn't find a place to be
Away from here

This is pathetic and sardonic
It's sadistic and psychotic
Tango is not for three
Was never meant to be
But you can try it
Rehearse it
Or train like a horse
But don't you count on me
Oh, don't you count on me, boy

Objection, I don't wanna the exception
To get a bit of your attention
I love you for free and I'm not your mother
But you don't even bother

Objection, I'm tired of this triangle
Got dizzy dancing tango
I'm falling apart in your hands again
No way, I've got to get away

Get away
Get away
Eh, eh, eh, get away
Ah-ha-ho, ah-ha-ho, aha
Ah-ha-ho, ah-ha-ho, aha
Uh-uh
I'm falling apart in your hands again
Get away
I'm falling apart in your hands again
Get away, get away
