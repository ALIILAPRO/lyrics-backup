		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Babygirl can't you see? 
My own life is a movie 
Made of glasses of wine 

For the perfect life 
Without waste of time

For the love of god 
cnd no trouble of mind 

Depend on me 
cnd you'll regret

The pain I had
I'll never forget

(Fake promises)
(Fake promises)
(Fake promises)
(Maybe you made)

500 miles per hour
I'll drive you over 
No matter what it takes
Probably without brakes

cgainst the laws and counting 
I'll drive you over 
Even if I think about her

For the perfect life 
Without waste of time

For the love of god 
cnd no trouble of mind 

Depend on me 
cnd you'll regret

The pain I had
I'll never forget

(Fake promises)
(Fake promises)
(Fake promises)
(Maybe you made)

Fake promises
Fake promises 
Maybe you made
Maybe you made
