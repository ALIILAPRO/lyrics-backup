		  Ladies and Gentlemen
Live from Madison funky garden, five
Let's get ready to rumble

Get on down in the gutter getting nasty
Bring that funky rhyme don't waste my time let's do this
There's a game that I know you will not play
No time to waste 'cause times a test let's do this

You got to work that body baby come on ladies show me
What you got ready or not 'cause here I come knocking
Bring the beats to keep the whole block
Rocking gimme some room and let me get down
Can't hold back 'cause da Five's in your town

Everybody got to grab somebody wow let's party

Don't stop baby, baby shake if you really
Want it Shake it baby Shake it now

Bring that beat five boys want bass
Got me stomping freak DJ spin that deck five girls caress
Hey ladeez got hip hip Five, four, three, two freak me
Show me what you got, how do you want to be rude boys got to
Get raw split the decks and open up the dance floor

Don't stop baby, baby shake if you really
Want it Shake it baby Shake it now

Little Jack Horner sat in the corner sucking on some
Butter in came Bo Peep naked to her feet
Ppp Poor Boy start to stutter Humpty Dumpty sat on the wall
And da brother turned up da bass
We were freaking down to da funky sound
And everybody had food that day

Let me see ya freak dat funk
Let me see ya freak dat funk
Let me see ya freak dat funk
Let me see ya freak dat funk

Yo ladies in the house tonight you're looking so fly
We got to rip the roof off this joint here we go ya
Gots to repeat after me come on ladies, let's break it down
One time ladies

When I say Five you'll say rock five rock, five rock 
When I say Five you'll say rock five rock, five rock
When I say Five you'll say rock five rock, five rock
When I say Five you'll say rock five rock, five rock
