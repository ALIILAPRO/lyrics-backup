		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lord, I went to the doctor, he took one look
He said, the trouble with you ain't in my book
I'll tell you what it is but it ain't good news
You've got an awful bad case of them low down blues

I've got the mean old miseries in my soul
I went to the river but the water's too cold
I've walked the floor till I've wore out my shoes
Lord, they're killin' me, I mean them low down blues

Lord, I never knew a man could feel so bad
I never knew livin' could be so sad
All I do is set and cry
Lord, I'd have to get better, before I could die

I've got the mean old miseries in my soul
I went to the river but the water's too cold
I've walked the floor till I've wore out my shoes
Lord, they're killin' me, I mean them low down blues
