		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Walking 
Through shadowed streets 
We're dancing 
in the kitchen 
Till your lips touch my cheeks 
Holding 
The heart I've found 
I've never felt so close to you
My deep and hallowed ground 

Pull me closer now 
I'm laying with your sun kissed hair 
Whilst you're still in my towel 
Tell me 
You've found your sound 
Coz I could be that melody 
you sing into the clouds

cnd oh I will 
Oh I will I will I will I will 
cnd I will I will I will I will 

Until the morning sun arrives 
You can be my light 
In the cold and darkened sky
I will be your guide 
Until the morning sun arrives 
You can be my light 

Cold touch 
Thoughts so loud 
Im dreaming of your head rest on my chest 
I'm warmer now 
Breaking 
The faults I've known 
Coz I'm just gonna love you like the first day that you called 

cnd oh I will 
(Don't you know) 
Oh I will I will I will I will 
(Don't you know )
cnd I will I will I will I will
(Don't you know)
Oh I will I will I will I will
(Don't you know)
cnd I will I will I will I will 

Until the morning sun arrives 
You can be my light 
In the cold and darkened sky
I will be your guide 
Until the morning sun arrives 
You can be my light
