		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Drugs, the sex, the lights
I think I want it all like every night
And God, I know it's wrong, it feels so right
I think I want it all like every night
The drugs, the sex, the lights
I think I want it all like every night
And God, I know it's wrong, it feels so right
I think I want it all like every night

I'm so ashamed
Of what I've become
I know I can't run
This is my way
I can't fathom
All this fakin'
I'm done fakin'
Fakin' for you

Drugs, the sex, the lights
I think I want it all like every night
And God, I know it's wrong, it feels so right
I think I want it all like every night
The drugs, the sex, the lights
I think I want it all like every night
And God, I know it's wrong, it feels so right
I think I want it all like every night
The dr-
