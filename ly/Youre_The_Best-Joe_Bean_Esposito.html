		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Try to be best
'Cause you're only a man
And a man's gotta learn to take it

Try to believe
Though the going gets rough
That you gotta hang tough to make it

History repeats itself
Try and you'll succeed

Never doubt that you're the one
And you can have your dreams

You're the best around
Nothing's gonna ever keep you down
You're the best around
Nothing's gonna ever keep you down
You're the best around
Nothing's gonna ever keep you down

Fight 'til the end
'Cause your life will depend
On the strength that you have inside you
Ah, gotta be proud
Standing out in the crowd
When the odds and the game defy you

Try your best to win them all
And one day time will tell
When you're the one that's standing there
You'll reach the final bell

You're the best around
Nothing's gonna ever keep you down
You're the best around
Nothing's gonna ever keep you down
You're the best around
Nothing's gonna ever keep you down
Oh-oh

Oh, You're the best around
Nothing's gonna ever keep you down
You're the best around
Nothing's gonna ever keep you down
You're the best around
Nothing's gonna ever keep you down

Fight 'til you drop
Never stop
Can't give up
'Til you reach the top (fight)
You're the best in town (fight!)
Listen to that sound
A little bit of all you got
They'll never bring you down

You're the best around
Nothing's gonna ever keep you down
You're the best around
Nothing's gonna ever keep you down
You're the best around
Nothing's gonna ever keep you down
You're the best around
Nothing's gonna ever keep you down
You're the best around
Nothing's gonna ever keep you down
You're the best around
Nothing's gonna ever keep you down
