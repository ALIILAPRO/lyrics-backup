		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby (have have, have, have, have, baby)
Baby (have have, have, have, have)
Baby, you can have what you want
You know, whatever you point at, it's yours (have have, have, have, have)
It's yours (oh)

Girls just wanna have
Girls just wanna have
Girls just wanna have
Luckily I'm havin' (I got that)
Mmm (yeah, I got that too)
Mmm (ooh-ooh-ooh)

Something's tellin' me you never had a shoppin' spree in New York
Well, something's tellin' me that I went and had to get the whole key to your heart
I confess that I don't usually do this
It's something about you, that I care for you

I put her to the side, like what am I missin'?
I hit her from the side, on one of my visits
She gave me a vibe, it was part of my sickness (yeah, yeah)
It's lookin' like you need me now
I know you wanna see me now
Wishin' you could meet me now
I got it, babe, I'm havin' today

Girls just wanna have
Girls just wanna have
Girls just wanna have
Luckily I'm havin' (I got that)
Mmm (yeah, I got that too)
Mmm (ooh-ooh-ooh)

Something's tellin' me you never had a shoppin' spree in New York
Well, something's tellin' me that I went and had to get the whole key to your heart
I confess that I don't usually do this
It's something about you, that I care and care for you

(Have have, have, have, have)
Girls just wanna have
(Have have, have, have, have)
Girls just wanna have
(Have have, have, have, have)
Girls just wanna have
(Have have, have, have, have)
Luckily, I'm havin' (I got that)
