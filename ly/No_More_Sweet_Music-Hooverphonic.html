		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was told about a second chance
Now I know that's not a rule in a game called romance
I was fooling around
Foolin' around

we lie and we cheat
Desire indeed
I knew where this would lead us to when I
Was fooling around
I was fooling around
Foolin' around

No more
No more sweet music
Just straight, tell me straight
If you got to do what you got to do
No more
No more sweet music
Just straight, tell me straight

We know there is no happy end
But still I'm tempted every time
We're fooling around
Foolin' around
We are fooling around
Foolin' around

Now we know there is no second chance
In this lost game of romance
Too much fooling around
Foolin' around
Too much fooling around
Foolin' around

No more
No more sweet music
Just straight, tell me straight
If you got to do what you got to do
No more
No more sweet music
Just straight, tell me straight

If you got to do what you got to do
Know there is no second chance
If you got to do what you got to do
Not in this game called romance
If you got to do what you got to do
There won't be a happy end
If you got to do what you got to do
Know that there wasn't and won't be a chance

No more
No more sweet music
Just straight, tell me straight
If you got to do what you got to do
No more
No more sweet music
Just straight, tell me straight
