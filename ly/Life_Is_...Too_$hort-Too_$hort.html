		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I remember how it all began
I used to sing dirty raps to my East Side fans
Back then I knew ya couldn't stop this rap
No M.C. could rock like that
Then the new style came, the bass got deeper
Ya gave up the mike and bought you a beeper
Do ya wanna rap or sell coke?
Brothers like you ain't never broke
People wanna say it's just my time
Brothers like me had to work for mine
Eight years on the mic and I'm not jokin'
Sir Too Short comin' straight from Oakland
California, home of the rock
Eight woofers in the trunk, beatin' down the block
Short dog, I'm that rappin' man
I said it before and I'll say it again

Life is too short
Too short
Life is too short
Too short

Life is to some people unbearable
Committin' suicide and that's terrible
Was it much too much or nothing' big?
If ya live my life, you'd be fightin' to live
Life is to me my main asset
I be doin' all right and keep it just like that
Chill out at the house and pump that bass
I'm tryin' to get rich as I rock the place
Everybody's got that same old dream
To have big money and fancy things
Drive a brand new Benz, keep your bank right here
Never hear me stutter once because I talk real clear
It's on you, homeboy, watcha gonna do?
You can take my advice and start workin', fool
Or you can close your ears and run your mouth
And one day, homeboy, ya soon find out

Life is too short
Too short
Life is too short
(Too short)

Life is too short, would you agree?
 
While I'm livin' my life, don't mess with me
It's been a long time, baby, since I first got down
But I still keep makin' these funky sounds
Cause I don't stop rappin', that's my theme
I make a lot of money, do you know what I mean?
Like this, complicated ya must stay up
Ya asked a simple question boy, don't say "What?"
Ya only live once and ya callin' it hell
Policeman tryin' to take ya to jail
You could give a man time but you don't know
I a matter of time, I'll be runnin' the show
Now another young buck wants to be on top
Makin' big money, slangin' hop
The task force tryin' to peel your cap
Turn around, homeboy, ya better watch your back

Life is too short
Life is

You can take back all the things you give
But ya can't take back the days you live
Life is to some people who've been on earth
Livin' every single day for what it's worth
I live my life just how I please
Satisfy one person I know that's me
Work hard for the things I achieve in life
And never rap fake when I'm on the mic
Cause if a dream is all you got, homeboy
Ya gotta turn that dream into the real McCoy
Not time to waste, just get on that case
Ya can't be down 'cause ya need to taste
A good life livin' like a king on a throne
Gettin' everything ya want
And tryin' to have all your own
Its your life
Don't be stupid though
Cause when ya waste it, you'll know

Life is
Life is
All right, that's it
