		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well you've got me dancing in a figure of eight,
Don't know if I'm coming or going, I'm early or late.
Round and round the ring I go,
I want to know, I want to know,
Why can't we travel a continuous line?
Make love reliable covenant all the time.
Up and down the hills I go, I got to know, I got to know.
Is is better to love another
Than to go go for a walk in the dark?
Is it better to love than to give in to hate?
Yeah we'd better take good care of each other
Avoid slipping back off the straight and narrow,
It's better by far than getting stuck in a figure of eight.

Well figure it out for yourself little girl,
It don't go nowhere at all,
It's nothing more than a tape loop in a big dance hall.

You've got me running

You've got me running
