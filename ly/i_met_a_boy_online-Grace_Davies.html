		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I met a boy online
We talk all the time
He lives in my city
And tells me I'm pretty
Does he know he lies?

I met a boy online
I wish he was mine
But it's just a distraction
It won't ever happen
He's wasting his time

'Cause what if he sees me in person
And hates me like I do?
He'll pretend that it's not true
But it's always the same

Then I'll lie in my bed
And go cry to my friends
It's a routine
'Cause why would he want me
When I am this way?
Oh, why would he want me

I met a boy online
He calls every night
Right when I need him
And I get a feeling
He's reading my mind

And maybe he'll find out
What's feeding my doubts
See, I've never felt wanted
If I'm being honest
I don't know how

And what if he sees me in person
And hates me like I do?
He'll pretend that it's not true
But it's always the same

Then I'll lie in my bed
And go cry to my friends
It's a routine
'Cause why would he want me
When I am this way? Oh

I wish I could let you inside
Let you love me
Let you love me, oh
I wish I could change up my mind
And let you love me
Let you love me, oh 

But what if he sees me in person
And hates me like I do?
Don't pretend that it's not true
It's always the same

Then I'll lie in my bed
And go cry to my friends
It's a routine
'Cause why would he want me
When I am this way? Oh
Why would he want me?
Why would he want me?
Why would he want me?
