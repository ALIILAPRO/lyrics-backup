		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't concentrate with you there looking at me
I can't seem to get a single thing done today
I don't want this feeling to ever go away
I want to climb inside you every single day

Oh, you know it's no rush, but

Do you think we'll last forever
No pressure though, would you just tell me yes or no
Do you think we'll last forever
Is this the end now babe? 
Or is it just the beginning

I'm on a ride, on a ride, on a ride
And it's first class
I'm alright, I'm alright, I'm alright
It's just a heart attack

No, no, no, no, no
I feel okay
You just made my heart race
You know it's hard to tell 'tween love and panic in the first place

I sit and watch the seconds walking by
Like tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick
I, everyone keeps telling me
"Can't you just enjoy this?" (Enjoy this)

Do you think we'll last forever
No pressure though, would you just tell me yes or no
Do you think we'll last forever
Is this the end now babe? 
Or is it just the beginning

I'm on a ride, on a ride, on a ride
And it's first class
I'm alright, I'm alright, I'm alright
It's just a heart attack

"You know that I love you babe" (do you feel the same way?)
"You know that I love you babe" (do you feel the same way?)
"You know that I love you" (do you feel the same way?)
"You know that I love you babe" (do you feel the same way?)
"You know that I, I, I" (do you feel the same way?)

Darling, tell me all your dreams have come true
'Cause everything I do baby, I do it for you
Tell me that you want me, 'cause I've got to admit it
If you're with someone else I don't think I could exist
Oh, you know I worship you night and day
Oh, just tell me you feel the same
Oh
Oh
