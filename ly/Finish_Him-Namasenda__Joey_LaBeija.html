		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  He don't even know how
It started but I'm gone now
Played me for a fool, that was wrong
Shot him with his own gun
Saw him when I came in (came in)
Tells me I'm mistaken (mistaken)
He can't even fake it (fake it)
Who you think you're playin', playin', playin'?

Ghost him, dump him, finish him
Caught him textin', finish him
Candy-colored lies, yeah, I'm sick of it
Idiotic smile, been a while, finish him
Roast him, block him, finish him
No shame, go insane, finish him
He don't even try and I'm sick of it
Leave it all behind, say goodbye, finish him

Ghost him, dump him, finish him
Caught him textin', finish him
Candy-colored lies, yeah, I'm sick of it
Idiotic smile, been a while, finish him
Roast him, block him, finish him
No shame, go insane, finish him
He don't even try and I'm sick of it
Leave it all behind, say goodbye, bye

I don't think you know me
But I fuck all your homies
You play yourself when you try to play me
No, I can never be jealous, I'm too petty
I see through your deep sea of lies, deep dive
But I will hang you out to dry, so don't try it
Make you cry at the drop of a dime
Because your heart is still mine, all mine

Ghost him, dump him, finish him
Caught him textin', finish him
Candy-colored lies, yeah, I'm sick of it
Idiotic smile, been a while, finish him
Roast him, block him, finish him
No shame, go insane, finish him
He don't even try and I'm sick of it
Leave it all behind, say goodbye, finish him

Ghost him, dump him, finish him
Caught him textin', finish him
Candy-colored lies, yeah, I'm sick of it
Idiotic smile, been a while, finish him
Roast him, block him, finish him
No shame, go insane, finish him
He don't even try and I'm sick of it
Leave it all behind, say goodbye, finish him
