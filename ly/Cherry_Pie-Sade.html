		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Got to find out what I meant to you
You're the one who broke my heart
Got to find out what I meant to you
You're the one who broke my heart

When I met you boy, you were as sweet as cherry pie
That smiling eye you were as wild as Friday night
I should have known however hard you try
Change'd come and strangle it
It was bound to die

You were sweet as cherry pie
Wild as Friday night
Sweet as cherry pie
Wild as Friday night

Gotta find out what I meant to you
You're the one who broke my heart in two
Gotta find out what I meant to you, oh boy

Gotta find out what I meant to you
You're the one who broke my heart in two
Where were you just when I needed you?

You gave me your soul for at least a day
"Listen boy, there was a time when I wanted you to stay"
You'll know the cost, it's you who's gonna pay
I'm stronger now, I loved you then
I'll ask you anyway

You were sweet as cherry pie
Wild as Friday night
Sweet as cherry pie
Wild as Friday night

Gotta find out what I meant to you
You're the one who broke my heart in two
Where were you just when I needed you, boy?

Gotta find out what I meant to you
You're the one who broke my heart in two, ooh
I needed you

(Ba-da-da-do-do, do-do)
(Ba-da-da-do-do, do)
(Ba-da-da-do-do) You teased me
(Ba-da-da-do-do, do)

(Ba-da-da-do-do, do-d)
(Ba-da-da-do-do, do) You broke my heart
(Ba-da-da-do-do)
(Ba-da-da-do-do, do) You broke my heart

Ooh-ooh
Hoo, hoo

You were the only one
You were the only one
You're a son of a gun

You were the only one
You were the only one
Oh boy, you broke my heart

Sweet as cherry pie
Sweet as cherry pie

Gotta find out what I meant to you
You're the one who broke my heart in two
Gotta find out what I meant to you, oh boy

Gotta find out what I meant to you
Where were you just when I needed you?
Gotta find out what I meant to you, boy

Ooh

Where were you when I needed you?
You were the only one
You were the only one
Son of a gun

You were the only one
I'm feeling strong
I loved you then
So I ask you anyway

Gotta find out what I meant to you (sweet as cherry pie)
You broke my heart
Gotta find out(sweet as cherry pie)
Gotta find out what I meant to you
You tease me

You were the only one (wild)
You were the only one (as Friday night)
Son of a gun

You were the only one (sweet)
You were the only one (as cherry pie)
