(Mello made it right)

I need to pour me up a cup just to feel somethin'
I feel like I been through so much, I don't even feel nothin'
And I know sometimes, it might be hard for you to love me
And even though I may not show it, I need it from you

I thought that I was back on track but I feel lost again
You gotta learn to trust yourself, these people not your friends
Where would they be if I was down at sticks and rocks again?
They only love me 'cause I'm countin' up these knots with them
I know I'm just guap to them
I seen money change my friends, I seen money change these hoes
I see motherfuckers change, 'cause of the shit that I got on
It's like I've been seein' the real ever since I got on
And since I stopped doin' favors, I been in the wrong

I need to pour me up a cup just to feel somethin'
I feel like I been through so much, I don't even feel nothin'
And I know sometimes, it might be hard for you to love me
And even though I may not show it, I need it from you

Oh, I need it, I need it
I need that, oh, I need that
Oh, I need it, I need it
I need that, oh, oh, oh, oh

Oh, woah, here I go, tryna fight myself again
It's late as fuck, I'm thinkin' like, "How did I get everythin'?"
Found myself in tears again with everythin' that I ever feared
I promised that I wouldn't lose myself, but damnit, here I am
I'm in my head constantly, and like right now, I need you right there
I'm in my bed prayin' up to the sky hopin' that God can hear
This shit ain't fair, now that I got brown, 'posed to be happy, yeah
That shit be cool, but nothin' is

I need to pour me up a cup just to feel somethin'
I feel like I been through so much, I don't even feel nothin'
And I know sometimes, it might be hard for you to love me
And even though I may not show it, I need it from you

Oh, I need it, I need it
I need that, oh, I need that
Oh, I need it, I need it
I need that, oh, oh, oh, oh
