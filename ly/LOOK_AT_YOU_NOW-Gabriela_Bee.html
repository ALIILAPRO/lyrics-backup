		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Listen to the music 
I want you to know that the storm is over 
You were feeling clueless 
But all it took was finding a 4 leaf clover 

And now you’re home 
You’re safe right now and you’re family is happy 
It goes to show 
That nothing lasts forever

I wish you knew
Of what was waiting 
It’s all for you 
Don’t feel so jaded 
Made it to June 
The sun is coming out (out)

Look at you now 
You’re alive 
Oh look at you now 
You’re alright 

When the nights are cold 
But the worlds on fire 
And you’re scared to fall cause it feels too high oh 

Look at you now 
You’re alive

Remember what you told me 
You felt like everybody you love’s gonna leave you
But are you really lonely?
Or did you forget 
You’re surrounded by people who love you for you?

When you lash out cause you’re scared of you’re feelings 
They wont ignore you 
Cause nothing lasts forever 

Oh look at you now 
You’re alive 
Oh look at you now 
You’re alright 

When the nights are cold 
But the worlds on fire 
And you’re scared to fall cause it feels too high oh 

Look at you now 
You’re alive

Now you see me 
Now they see me
Now I see me
Now I see me
X2

Look at you now 
You’re alive 
Oh look at you now
You’re alright

When the nights are cold 
But the worlds on fire
And you’re scared to fall
Cause it feels too high oh 

Look at you now
You’re alive 

Listen to the music
I want you to know that the storm is over
You were feeling clueless 
But nothing lasts forever
