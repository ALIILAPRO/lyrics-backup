		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You look indescribably good irrevocably grand
With you by my side is where I wanna stand

It’s inequivicolly great to be out here this late
With you on my arm-- Oh God, you got charm!

Cause we’ve found ourselves in quite a situation
And when I’m by your side I feel elation
You kiss me slow but without hesitation
You threw me straight into
Inarticulation

It’s undeniably swell and if you can tell
I’m sorry it’s weak the way I speak of this treat

And if tomorrow’s the same who cares if it rains
Just please do not focus the way they approach us

Cause we’ve found ourselves in quite a situation
And when I’m by your side I feel elation
You kiss me slow but without hesitation

You threw me straight into
Inarticulation

And are you pretty or handsome
My words are on ransom
Are you dashing or gorgeous
My vocab’s atrocious

Are you God are you Jesus?
This rhyme is egregious
Whatever the words are
I feel I’m on Venus

And although I’m inept
To truly speak to your depth
And I’m probly insane
To even rack through my brain

Further moreover,
My rhyme’s getting closer
Whatever the words are
You’ve won me right over

Cause we’ve found ourselves in quite a situation
And when I’m by your side I feel elation
You kiss me slow but without hesitation
You threw me straight into
Inarticulation

We’ve found ourselves in quite a situation
And when I’m by your side I feel elation
You kiss me slow but without hesitation
You threw me straight into
Inarticulation
