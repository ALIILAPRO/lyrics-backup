		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It better be somewhere
It better be better being ‘dead'
‘cus it doesn't feel it i wasn't living
Though I wasn't feeling half as bad
I made a killing watch me be always
Watching the exit's out the back
Watch me be spinning stood in the hallway
Laying me back across your chest
Let me be swimming in the taste of my liver
The taste of my stomach giving in
I wasn't hindered but I barely got anywhere
Barely got anything barely got started
And you said "did it always?"
Getting in bed with all the guilt
I didn't plan it this semi-god living
The risible thoughts I hated having
Bury them deeper and I hate that I froze up
Whenever I tried to lay it out
But I wasn't lying
And it was brave to be honest
But I know I was hardly like a lion
I'm just glad that I said it
So let me just lay, man -
If it set me off laughing
I couldn't control it -
You just let me replay it
And you let me eat lightning
I totally get it

When you rested your head on
Me, that was when I split in two
That left me empty you said you were sorry
You said you had sounded like a giant
I barely heard it
