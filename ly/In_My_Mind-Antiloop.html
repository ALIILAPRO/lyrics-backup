		<p>
		  Welcome to my head again
I usually make plans so I can cancel them
And yeah I really wish I could explain the hell
I’m sad, angry, but happy when I’m mad
And no one understands me
Damn, now I am alone again and
I may cry a little but I’m fine with that
Yeah, there was a time I used to dance with death but I got over that
And now I write instead

But there’s no peace in my mind
You know sometimes I hate myself
But there’s no peace in my mind
You know sometimes I hate myself

Just another Friday night
I know you are longing for a stable life
but all I ever did is trying to survive
if I could, I would,
but we both know I’m dead inside
I’ve seen so many PhDs
Still my thoughts are speaking way too loud to me and So I took some pills to get a little peace in me, hardly did I know they’d be erasing me

But there’s no peace in my mind
You know sometimes I hate myself
But there’s no peace in my mind
You know sometimes I hate myself

I woke up just in time
Think I’m doing fine
Waiting for a sign and I don’t know why
I woke up just in time
think I’m doing fine
Waiting for a sign til the end of time
But there’s no peace in my mind
You know sometimes I hate myself

But there’s no peace in my mind
You know sometimes I hate myself
But there’s no peace in my mind
You know sometimes I hate myself
