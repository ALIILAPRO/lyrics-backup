		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey, it's Renn
Would you ride for me baby
Would you lie to me baby
Get outside for me baby
Yeah yeah
Cuz if you ride for me baby
You might die for me baby
You can't lie to me baby
Nah nah
And yeah I need it right now
Freaky little shawty
Tell you what it's all about
Uh uh
And yeah I need it right now
Hands up like a zombie
Gonna tear this shit down
Yeah yeah
So what you tryna do
Baby I'm a straight shooter
That's just how I move
So we're not going on on and on like goofs
Chemicals ain't romance
Paragraphs don't last
Yeah yeah
So all I'm gonna say
You better go big
Or get outta my way
Are we locked in
Do you got that loyalty
Do I scare you
Is it too much
Uh uh
Would you ride for me baby
Would you lie to me baby
Get outside for me baby
Yeah yeah
Cuz if you ride for me baby
You might die for me baby
You can't lie to me baby
Nah nah
And yeah I need it right now
Freaky little shawty
Tell you what it's all about
Uh uh
And yeah I need it right now
Hands up like a zombie
Gonna tear this shit down
Yeah yeah
Do you toss and turn for my energy
Make up an excuse to get next to me
Do you find the tension unsettling
Am I all alone in that
No reciprocating
Are you running from the one
Why you running from the one
Do I scare you
Is it too much
Tell me now would ya
Would you ride for me baby
Would you lie to me baby
Get outside for me baby
Yeah yeah
Cuz if you ride for me baby
You might die for me baby
You can't lie to me baby
Nah nah
And yeah I need it right now
Freaky little shawty
Tell you what it's all about
Uh uh
And yeah I need it right now
Hands up like a zombie
Gonna tear this shit down
Yeah yeah
