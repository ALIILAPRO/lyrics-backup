		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ain't got nothing to lose right here
I didn't want them to like me in the first place
I don't need to share my purpose, no
But I would if it would be worth it

What's perfect to me, it's not worth it to them
It's just the way you see, you see
What's perfect to them, it's not worth it to me
It's just the way you see, you see

I told my mama she should stop working
Seeing your hands getting rubbed on the floor
Till the skin peels off is not worth it
Me and my little brother put the work in
Preparing that work like a surgeon
I sticked to my raps and he stick to the streets
Had to tell my little bro it's not worth it

Leave that shit alone before it's burning
Before the feds come in again
S400 and I'm spinning rims
Ain't no debate, we the realist in this shit

I got no tears left to cry
On this side, on this side
Nothing seems alright
Until it's alright

Ain't got nothing to lose right here
I didn't want them to like me in the first place
I don't need to share my purpose, no
But I would if it would be worth it

What's perfect to me, it's not worth it to them
It's just the way you see, you see
What's perfect to them, it's not worth it to me
It's just the way you see, you see

Some might think I'm blind
But it's too hard to find what I call inner peace
So I choose another way
Unknown to me
I choose freedom, I keep faith
