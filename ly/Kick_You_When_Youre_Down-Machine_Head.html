		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Love for my love, hate for my hate
Strength for my strength, pain for my pain
Pride for my pride, match it inside
Trust that I find in you
But it's hard and it's brutal, it's nasty and rude and
It's dirty and mean when they treat you like yesterday's
News
They want to keep us all down town, frowned, underground
But no one is keeping me down
Fuck no

I'll keep my head high

'Cause they will always kick you when you're down

Life for my life, soul fore my soul
Truth for my truth and heart for my heart
Drive for my drive, match it inside
Fight for this fight and don't you ever never
Give up, give up you gotta play like a master of chess
It's a long road and it's mental endurance stress test
Sometimes you fight and you win, sometimes you fight and
You lose
It's the fighter in you
Not to lose

So keep you head high

'Cause they will always kick you when you're down

You have to trust in yourself
You must believe in yourself
You have to follow your heart
You overcome, improve, endure

Love for my love, hate for my hate
Strength for my strength, pain for my pain
Pride for my pride, match it inside
Keep up your drive and fight to fight
Because some shit ain't right
Don't lose our sight
Get our heads right
Shine our star too bright
Nothing in life is for sure
It's just a gamble
So play it for all that it's worth

And don't forger to keep our heads high

'Cause they will always kick you when you're down
They will always kick you when you're down
And don't you let their kicking get you down

You have to trust in yourself
You must believe in yourself
You have to follow your heart
You overcome, improve, endure
