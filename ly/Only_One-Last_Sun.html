		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lay me down
Lay me down my lover
Spin me round
Safe and sound
Till I’m found my lover
Keep you close
I’ve been, I’ve been
I’ve been running on fume
You are
You are the only
I’ve been, I’ve
I’ve been chasing up high
You are, you are the only drugs
I’ve been, I’ve been
I’ve been running
You are
You are the only
I’ve been, I’ve
I’ve been chasing
You are, you are the only drugs
Lay me down
Lay me down my lover
Spin me round
Safe and sound
Till I’m found my lover
Keep you close
You are the only one
You are the only drug
I’ve been, I’ve been
I’ve been running on fume
You are
You are the only
I’ve been, I’ve
I’ve been chasing up high
You are, you are the only drug
I’ve been, I’ve been I’ve been running
Running, You are
I’ve been, I’ve been  I’ve been,  running
I’ve been, I’ve been  I’ve been,  running
You are the only one
You are the only drug
You are the only one
Lay me down
Lay me down my lover
Spin me round
Safe and sound
Till I’m found my lover
Keep you close
Lay me down
Lay me down my lover
Spin me round
Safe and sound
Till I’m found my lover
Keep you close
