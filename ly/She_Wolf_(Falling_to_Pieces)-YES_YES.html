		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A shot in the dark
A past, lost in space
And where do I start
The past, and the chase
You want to be gone
Like a wolf, a predator
I feel like a deer in the light
Your love be in that frozen time
Hungry for that flesh of mine
But I can't compete with the she wolf, who has brought me to my knees
What do you see in those yellow eyes
Cause I'm falling to pieces
I'm falling to pieces
I'm falling to pieces
I'm falling to pieces
Falling to pieces
Your love be in that frozen time
Hungry for that flesh of mine
But I can't compete with the she wolf,
Who has brought me to my knees
What do you see in those yellow eyes
Cause I'm falling to pieces
I'm falling to pieces
I'm falling to pieces
I'm falling to pieces
Falling to pieces
