		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A sky red from the blood
Rose cheeks dull from the mud
Hands worn through from the sludge
A self no longer begrudged
And murder is a potion of love
Sacrifice devotion thereof
And he without sin never was
Now a changing of the guard has begun
A kingdom that belies the internal
Is a prison of the mind that's infernal
And eternal is the lie turned plague
So I've dug this grave so my truth won't fade
I feel the war paint on my face
I feel the ground tremble and quake
I feel my heart sync to the pace that these war drums make
I feel alive and awake
And all I see is war path ahead of me
Each and every step I welcome readily
And if my lack of fear bring the death of me
Let the spirits of my ancestors envelop me
So know this is that armageddon coming
A flood that goes beyond the refuge high upon the summit
A sun become hole, black hold on consumption
Spun inside itself into a beacon that has summoned
That creature of the deep that leaves a pit inside your stomach
That rumbling beneath that bodes arrival from above, and
That nature of the beast that feeds upon the will to numb it
That monster brought the seed of life, well now I have become it

And I feel like I've got a gun
Like I've been changed more ways than one
And this whole world has just begun
And it's so nice to meet me

A self once masked by these stains
That filth washed out with the rain
When I'm done only thing that remains
Is a tombstone etched with my name
Look into a face that has changed
Recognize the corpse in that grave
Resurrect, what's lost can be saved
I am now free, once slave
And I am not a part of a game
I am not a moth to a flame
I am both man and brigade
I won't be denied or restrained
I am what the weak can't obtain
I am what survives if it's slain
I am rest in peace if you aim
No I am not built of the same

And I feel like I've got a gun
Like I've been changed more ways than one
And this whole world has just begun
And it's so nice to meet me

Behold a pale horse in my gaze
High upon it Death in a rage
He said he had the truth that I crave
So my sword through his chest I gave
Ain't no one command I behave
Never put my faith in plans best laid
And I don't follow rules that you made
I think it's time I set this whole bitch ablaze
On the precipice of slaughter is the Lord
Angels and those demons come together with a cause
And I don't think you really know the meaning of a storm
Let this serve a lesson on the essence of reform
Hatred without focus make the eager man fall
Violence without purpose make the mighty man small
Vengeance without mercy leave the noble man flawed
And insurrection mounts behind those battle lines drawn
But future is beholden to the present moment cast
And prudence don't repeat the futile habits of the past
And courage is to he that sheds his skeletons as last
These trains of thought now heading toward a devastating crash
Bloodshed to that order like a flower to a thorn
Beauty know perfection like a child know the law
And I advise you heed these words enlightened and forewarned
Truth in what you are an oath of life to which I've sworn

And I feel like I've got a gun
Like I've been changed more ways than one
And this whole world has just begun
And it's so nice to meet me
