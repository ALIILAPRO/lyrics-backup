		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, the times are slowly changing
Baby, even when it's live
You can press pause and rewind
You knew it'd go amazing, but is this what you had in mind?
Oh, there's nothing you can't find

It's two thousand and thirteen, all across the galaxy
It's two thousand and thirteen

On the back of a transmitter, there's a little shiny fruit
And it's coming after you
As for Instagram and Twitter, she got caught in both lassos
And neither one will cut her loose

It's two thousand and thirteen, all across the galaxy
It's two thousand and thirteen
Yeah

So, baby, take a walk with me
Past flying cars and time machines
There's magic like you won't believe, no

It's two thousand and thirteen, all across the galaxy
It's two thousand and thirteen, all across the galaxy
