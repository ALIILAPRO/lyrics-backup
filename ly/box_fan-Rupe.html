		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  On the phone in the parking lot
Pretending to be what I'm not
Maybe if I say I'm into sports
I'll be the one that they adore
By myself in a crowded room
Social settings are my doom
Why am I here? I don't fit in
I'm living to see when the night will end

All my friends are out today
For some reason I just want to stay
Will I regret it? I don't know
Will my true colors ever show
Overhear talks about the party
People asking if they'll see me
I tell 'em I hope you understand
I'd rather fall asleep to the sound of my box fan

I tell 'em I hope you understand
I'd rather fall asleep to the sound of my box fan
I tell 'em I hope you understand
I'd rather fall asleep to the sound of my box fan
I tell 'em I hope you understand
I'd rather fall asleep to the sound of my box fan
I tell 'em I hope you understand
I'd rather fall asleep to the sound of my box fan
