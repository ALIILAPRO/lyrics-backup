		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Steve's going to London
Shaun's stuck in a suit
Tom sleeps on his best friend's lawn
Like every other afternoon
Steve's going to London
Dan peed in the pool
Tom fell for his best friend's mom
But what the hell you gonna do?

Hey-hey, look around, look around
Wouldn't it be nice for someone to miss ya?
Hey-hey, funny how all the things
That you used to like, now they depress ya
While you try to find some meaning in your life
Before you're gone
There's a song that don't mean anything at all
And it sounds like

Steve's goin' to London
Shaun's stuck in a suit
Tom sleeps on his best friend's lawn
Like every other afternoon
Steve's goin' to London
Dan peed in the pool
Tom fell for his best friend's mom
But what the hell you gonna
What the hell you gonna do?

Hey-hey, look around, look around
Wouldn't it be nice to see me on TV?
I'd dress to the nines with a smile
And you'd probably think that that was the real me

While you try to find some meaning in your life
Before you die
Here's a bunch of random shit to waste your time
And it sounds like

Steve's going to London
Shaun's stuck in a suit
Tom sleeps on his best friend's lawn
Like every other afternoon (every other afternoon)
Steve's going to London
Dan peed in the pool
Tom fell for his best friend's mom
But what the hell you gonna
What the hell you gonna do?
What the hell you gonna do?

(You, you make this rather snappy, won't you?)

I try hard to write a cool song
So I start with something simple, like trying to put my shoes on
Now something kinda clicked, 'cause you relate a bit
But no one's gonna care about a shoe song
I try hard to write a cool song
But I gotta make it matter so maybe I'll throw the news on
Could I relate the shoes to 2022
Or maybe an election down in Tucson?
I try throwing something cool on
So I'm listening to Kendrick and playing the Swimming Pools song
But why did I do that? 'Cause now I hate my track
I'm quite aware I'll never write a cool song
But who really needs a cool song?
There's so many better melodies, why do you need a new one?
So stop writing a song about writing a song
You're losing their attention, buddy, move on

Steve's going to London (what the hell?)
Shawn's stuck in a suit
Tom sleeps on his best friend's lawn
Like every other afternoon (every other afternoon)
Steve's going to London
Dan peed in the pool
Tom fell for his best friend's mom
But what the hell you gonna
What the hell you gonna do?
What the hell you gonna do?
What the hell you gonna do?

Steve's going to London
Steve's going to London
Steve's going to London
Steve's going to London (let's go, let's go)
Steve's going to London
Steve's going to London (I know, I know, I know)
Steve's going to London
Steve's going to London
Steve's going to London
Steve's going to London
Steve's going to London
