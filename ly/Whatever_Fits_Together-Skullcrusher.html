		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I left home in the summer
I cried in the stairway
When I hugged my brother
I tried to hide my face
Slipped away like a sweaty hand
Let go and forgotten
Went along with whatever
Thought I knew what I wanted
Never knew what I wanted
What do I want?
Do I want?

I awoke in a warm bath
With words still in my head
They remain unspoken
And follow me to death

What do I want?
Do I want anything?

Do you ever look back?
Does it all fit together?
If we're here, does it matter?
(If we're here, does it matter?)
