		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Through paralysis I've been summoned
Ridding this life of a pitch-black entity
I am light and your end is coming
Just a blight in my veins
I'm cutting it out
Just a blight in my veins
I'm cutting it out
I'm enlightened
BLEGH!
This won't get the best of me
This won't get the best of me
Sightless blight swimming in my life it's far from graceful
(Just a pain fueled flame)
Senseless fight trying to take my mind I'm done being peaceful!
Cast aside your concept of light
Everything you're fighting for is waiting inside
I will cut this blight that is bleeding me dry
Taking its life so it can't take mine
Sad and how pathetic is the way it tries to feed on me
Kill it
Kill it
Kill it
I'm left broken from the loss of sleep
I'm exposed
Burning up slow
Sinking in the sand
To the vile below
Little did I notice there's something that I was born to be
Linking everything that I've known
It's time for me to see
Stars in me
Guide my fate
Break
These ties - that have kept you blank
Inside
All for
Grace
This time I will find a way
Cut the ties
Sightless blight swimming in my life it's far from graceful
(Just a pain fueled flame)
Senseless fight trying to take my mind I'm done being peaceful!
Cast aside your concept of light
Everything you're fighting for is waiting inside
I will cut this blight that is bleeding me dry
Taking its life so it can't take mine
Time
Is up, it's clear
I've got to step to face my fear
So I created a space
And I invited it in
I can feel
The balance of everything I've ever known has shifted
With symbiotic limbs
It tightens grip on my legs
I scream
Its fucking over
This life is not yours it's mine
I'll fucking lock you here and throw the key
It's finally over
Everything was different yet the same
Fell astray from the path but became what I needed to be
Everything was different yet the same
I was led in the dark
But I finally broke free
I've become the light
Fell astray from the path but became what I needed to be
I've become the light
I was led in the dark
But I finally broke free
