		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (That be Maaly Raw) 

Had to flex up, got my check up, I'm so special, yeah-yeah (ayy)
Count your blessings, I'm the next one and the best one, yeah-yeah
I'ma be this way all until I'm in a wheelchair (yeah)
Talking to my friends, can't believe that we still here

Woah, you ain't even know I was real (ain't know it)
You ain't even know I'm on a pill (yeah)
You ain't even know my niggas kill, that's for real, yeah

Fuck-nigga hate me, told him that shit will not break me (yeah)
Bet that girl would never play me (huh?)
I had to spin like I'm Kobe (ayy)
Had to hit three like I'm KD (KD)
I put the bezel on Rollie
Flood that whole thing like a AP (goddamn)
Pull up, like damn, Mercedes, like

I can't die (yeah)
I can't die (yeah)
I'm alive

High as the ceiling, like go through the red light, I got my cheddar right (skrr, ooh)
Diamonds they dancin' like you cut the light off, you seein' me, candle light (ayy)
She knock on my door, at 11:04 and this a no panty night (yeah, yeah)
I tried to whip at a foreign time (yeah), look at my wrist, I paid forty twice (yeah)

Had to flex up, got my check up, I'm so special, yeah-yeah (ayy)
Count your blessings, I'm the next one and the best one, yeah-yeah
I'ma be this way all until I'm in a wheelchair (yeah)
Talking to my friends, can't believe that we still here

Woah, you ain't even know I was real (ain't know it)
You ain't even know I'm on a pill (yeah)
You ain't even know my niggas kill, that's for real, yeah

Extra hundred thousand likes because she in my photo (photo, yeah)
Please don't try to dap me up because you not my bro-bro
Loose diamonds all in my pendant lookin' like a snow globe (ah)
Got your girl straight off the promo, then I fucked her on my GoPro
Tried to take me out my zone
They can't get me out my zone (yeah, yeah) 
man, they want me out my zone (yeah)
Got a song that went gold, got another one that went platinum
I'm on fire, I ain't never cold 
No matter what, stick to the code (code)
Start gettin' money, I ain't never walked
No matter what, better not talk
You might take that loss, saw your girlfriend in the dark
No, it ain't my fault, Master P, it ain't my fault (yeah)
Come with life, fuck the cost, turn my side to a boss (boss, Lil Uzi)

Had to flex up, got my check up, I'm so special, yeah-yeah (that be Maaly Raw) (ayy)
Count your blessings, I'm the next one and the best one, yeah-yeah
I'ma be this way all until I'm in a wheelchair (yeah)
Talking to my friends, can't believe that we still here

Woah, you ain't even know I was real (ain't know it)
You ain't even know I'm on a pill (yeah)
You ain't even know my niggas kill, that's for real, yeah
