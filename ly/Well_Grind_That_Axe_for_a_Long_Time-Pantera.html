		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wears ten crowns, dragons' heads
Southern are the sons, Lords unmatched
Your eyes don't look right
Should they be trusted now?
Trashed-mouth gods, avoided kings
Spirit of revolt, the ghost of youth

Every fucking year it stays the same
Everybody changes to suit the day
Out of pride I'll isolate my fears
Never turned our backs on why we're here
We'll grind that axe for a long time

Follow close, train of fools
Just like them, just like you
Their eyes don't seem right
Easily impressed plague
Dressed up fake, no respect

Every fucking year remains the same
Everybody sucks up to suit the day
Out of hate I'll isolate myself
Through the worst we still marched into hell

We'll grind that axe for a long time
We'll grind that axe for a long time, and I'll say it again
We'll grind that axe for a long time, and a-fuckin'-gain, I'll say
We'll grind that axe for a long time
Ah, the smell in the air is chicken shit

We'll grind that axe for a long time
We'll grind that axe for a long time
We'll grind that axe, we'll grind that axe
We'll grind that axe for a long time

Every fucking song remains the same
To everyone who sucks-up for the fame
Out of strength you know we speak the truth
Every trend that dies is living proof
We'll grind that axe for a long time
