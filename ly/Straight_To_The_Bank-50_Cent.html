		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, when I'm out in N.Y., boy it's blunts and phillies
When I'm out in L.A., boy it's wraps and swishes
Now Blood walk to this, now Crip walk to this
Now throw it up, raise it up for that gangsta s***
Now Blood walk to this, now Crip walk to this
Now throw it up, raise it up for that gangsta s***

I'm in my Lambo, maggot, my fo' fo', faggot
Doors lift up I'm like Go-Go Gadget
See the s*** I got on, homey I hate too
My teflon arm brought my government issues

I'll hit your vertebrae, bullets rip through tissues
Your wife on the futon huggin' the shih tzu
Homey you a b****, you got feminine ways
Heard you got four lips and bleed for seven days
I got fo' fifths and bananas on the case
And got more whips than a runaway slave
Me and Yayo go back like some high top fades

When I made fifty mill, Em got paid
When I made sixty mill, Dre got paid
When I made eighty mill, Jimmy got paid
I ain't even gotta rap now life is made
Said I ain't even gotta rap, I'm filthy mayne

I'm laughin' straight to the bank with this
(Ha ha ha ha, ha, ha ha ha ha ha)
I'm laughin' straight to the bank with this
(Ha, ha ha ha ha ha, ha, ha ha ha ha ha)
I'm laughin' straight to the bank with this
(Ha, ha ha ha ha ha, ha, ha ha ha ha ha)
I'm laughin' straight to the bank with this
(Ha, ha ha ha ha ha, ha, ha ha ha ha ha)
I'm laughin'

I see nothin' but hundred dollar bills in the bank roll
I got the kind of money that the bank can't hold
Got it off the street movin' bundles and loads
Seventy Three Caprice, old school when I roll
Breeze pa** with the E Pa** f*** the toll

No more platinum, I'm wearin' gold
I'm internationally known as the kid with the flow
That brings enough dough, it's never enough though
S*** I need mo', I need s*** out the sto'
Baby Blue was old fresh out the flo'

Stashbox by the dashbox in case they want war
Make the purple bring the green in, f*** the law
I'm oh so raw, I'm hot I'm sure
I'm like the coolest motherf***er around the globe boy
I set the club on fire I told ya
I'm the general, salute me soldier

I'm laughin' straight to the bank with this
(Ha ha ha ha, ha, ha ha ha ha ha)
I'm laughin' straight to the bank with this
(Ha, ha ha ha ha ha, ha, ha ha ha ha ha)
I'm laughin' straight to the bank with this
(Ha, ha ha ha ha ha, ha, ha ha ha ha ha)
I'm laughin' straight to the bank with this
(Ha, ha ha ha ha ha, ha, ha ha ha ha ha)
I'm laughin'

Now work it out now, shorty work it out
I wanna see you break it down
Now back it up now, you know what I'm about
It's like a bank job, I'm rentin' them out
Now work it out now, work it out, work it out
Now work it out now, work it out, work it out
