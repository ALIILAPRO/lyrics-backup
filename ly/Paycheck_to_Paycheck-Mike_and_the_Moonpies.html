		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Woo-hoo

On Monday mornin' I'm a-hemmin' and a-hawin' 
Tryin' to get myself in gear
I'm on a hard-hat crew 'cause the bills are due 
And I'm in up to my ears
But come Friday night I'll be feelin' right
When I'm cashin' my check downtown
Where the liquor's sold and the beers are cold 
And the jukebox turned up loud

I'm livin' paycheck to paycheck
One quarter at a time
I just dropped one in the jukebox
I can't hold myself in line
Tell the I.R.S. to shove it
And give me eleven twenty-nine
I'm livin' paycheck to paycheck
And I don't waste a dime

Woo-hoo
Woo-hoo

I been churnin' and a-burnin' 
And a-workin' on the weekends for goin' on fifteen years
I tried to save my pay for a Chevrolet 
But then I spent it on fifteen beers
Now I got a bank loan on a two tone Pontiac GTO
Well Paycheck in the tape deck and blarin' on the radio

I'm livin' paycheck to paycheck
One quarter at a time
I just dropped one in the jukebox
I can't hold myself in line
Tell the I.R.S. to shove it
And give me eleven twenty-nine
I'm livin' paycheck to paycheck
And I don't waste a dime

I've got an empty bottle and a broken heart 
And you're still on my mind
I'm livin' paycheck to paycheck
And I don't waste a dime

I'm livin' paycheck to paycheck
One quarter at a time (woo-hoo)
And I don't waste a dime (woo-hoo)
Woo-hoo
