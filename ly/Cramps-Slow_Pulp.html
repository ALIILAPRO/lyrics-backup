		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She seems so ambitious 
Talking and she's spitting
And I think I know what I'm missing
There's nothing better 
Watch out for Heather

I play out the same scene 
Bleeding on my new sheets
I wanna bake out on the concrete
There's nothing better 
Than keeping it together

I'll take anything (I'll take anything)
That you wanna give (that you wanna give)
But I want everything (everything)

Be a better lover 
I know that I'm a runner
Oh no, I think I've become her
There's nothing better 
Than being the protector

Out of a routine 
The only one I've ever seen
I wanna be a foolproof machine
There's nothing better 
Wanna be like Heather

I'll take anything (I'll take anything)
That you wanna give (that you wanna give)
But I want everything (everything, everything)
Everything (everything, everything)

I'll take anything (I'll take anything)
That you wanna give (that you wanna give)
But I want everything (everything, everything)
Everything (everything)

I'll take anything (I'll take anything)
That you wanna give (that you wanna give)
But I want everything (everything)
