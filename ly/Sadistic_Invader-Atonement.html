		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Feel the sadistic invader
See as he's raping the land
Blood spills by a damnator
Serving for satans left hand

Burning fire in his eyes 
Being an unholy sacrifice 
This is what we have feared
Now they are here
Sadistic Invader

Being dark as the night 
With him he surely brings fright
Women needs to beware 
No right lives will he ever spare

Women and children they will cry 
It's no thing we can deny
This is what we have feared
Now they are here
Sadistic Invader 

I will bring you salvation 
I wanna see that they die
They'll bring you devestation
Nothing they'll do is right 

Women and children they will cry 
It's no thing we can deny
This is what we have feared
Now they are here
Sadistic Invader
