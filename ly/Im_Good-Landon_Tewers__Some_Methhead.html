		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I don't catch a break
If I'm in seventh place
Trust me I'm good
Yeah I don't need a name
I'll be doing fine in a 2005 car in cheap clothes
Yeah I've had a couple deals
A couple court appeals
Spent some time erasing
No drink here is wasted
I don't give a fuck about what daddy gave you, no ain't got no patience
Yeah I ain't got no time, I'm just living life
I ain't gotta prove shit
I don't wanna move quick
Take my name off the magazine page and put the new kids
I'm singing ooo I'm good
Got friends and family, they don't fail me
Keep your check bitch I'm prevailing
Ooo I'm good
Yeah falling alseep
Awake in a dream
Please leave me here now 
Yeah don't even speak
All of my friends who were taken too young are still in this place
Sure, I understand there's much to repair
I'm dreading the process 
Just counting my losses
I won't forget all of the people that pushed me through the worst phase
Yeah I aint got no time
I'm just living life
I aint gotta prove shit
I don't wanna move quick
Delete my name from the depths of your brain I'm begging please
