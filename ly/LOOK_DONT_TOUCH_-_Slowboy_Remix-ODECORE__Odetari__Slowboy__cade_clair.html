		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mm-mm, I can't let go
Girl, you really got my soul
Mm-mm, I can't let go
Girl, you really got my soul
Mm-mm, I can't let go
Girl, you really got my soul
Mm-mm, I can't let go
And she really work that pole

Go ahead, get whatcha want
Don't check the price, not allowed
I buy the bitch what she want
I don't check the price, not at all

Yeah, I like to stare, stare, stare
(Don't touch it, don't touch it)
Stare, stare, stare
(Don't touch it, don't touch it)
Stare, stare, stare
(Don't touch it, don't touch it)
Stare, stare, stare
(Don't touch it)
At least I keep it real

At least I kept it real
That's something that you couldn't do
Tell me how you feel
Yeah, okay
I been runnin', I been gettin' fake
Surrounded by these girls, I'm feeling jaded
They see my name and now they gettin' naked
I'm way too high tonight, I might not make it

Yeah, I like to stare, stare, stare
(Don't touch it, don't touch it)
Stare, stare, stare
(Don't touch it, don't touch it)
Stare, stare, stare
(Don't touch it, don't touch it)
Stare, stare, stare
(Don't touch it)
At least I keep it
At least I keep it real

You put all this shit on me
Only go when you lonely
I thought that you were chosen
Bitch took my heart and she froze it, whoa
When I get my bitches, I pass 'em to 'Tari
Turn me to a dog, baby, I'm sorry not sorry
I showed you the real and you showed me the fake
What the fuck did you think?

Don't touch it, don't touch it
Don't touch it, don't touch it
Don't touch it, don't touch it
Don't touch it
At least I kept it real
At least I kept it real

Yeah, I like to stare, stare, stare
(Don't touch it, don't touch it)
Stare, stare, stare
(Don't touch it, don't touch it)
Stare, stare, stare
(Don't touch it, don't touch it)
Stare, stare, stare
(Don't touch it)
At least I keep it
At least I keep it real
