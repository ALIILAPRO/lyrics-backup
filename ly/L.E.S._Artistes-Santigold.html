		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What I'm searching for
To tell it straight, I'm trying to build a wall
Walking by myself
Down avenues that reek of time to kill
If you see me keep going
Be a pass by waver
Build me up, bring me down
Just leave me out you name dropper
Stop trying to catch my eye
I see you good you forced faker
Just make it easy
You're my enemy you fast talker

I can say I hope it will be worth what I give up
If I could stand up mean for the things that I believe

I can say I hope it will be worth what I give up
If I could stand up mean for the things that I believe

What am I here for?
I left my home to disappear is all
I'm here for myself
Not to know you
I don't need no one else
Fit in so good the hope is that you cannot see me later
You don't know me
I am an introvert an excavator
I'm duckin' out for now
A face in dodgy elevators
Creep up and suddenly
I found myself
An innovator

I can say I hope it will be worth what I give up
If I could stand up mean for the things that I believe

I can say I hope it will be worth what I give up
If I could stand up mean for the things that I believe

Change-change, change, change
I want to get up out of my skin
Tell you what
If I can shake it
I'm 'a make this
Something worth dreaming of

I can say I hope it will be worth what I give up
If I could stand up mean for the things that I believe

I can say I hope it will be worth what I give up
If I could stand up mean for the things that I believe

I can say I hope it will be worth what I give up
If I could stand up mean for the things that I believe
