		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Red lips on a cigarette
Lives a life with no regrets
And it makes me wonder
Acts tough but she's struggling
Camouflage but it's wearing thin
I think she's going under

Dancing through the night in electric light
Wishing it could be this way forever
You don't have to hide, I'll be by your side
It's better when we do it together

Most of us are strangers who want someone to save us
We're looking out for angels and something we can hold on
We hear sirens and suffer in the silence
Getting tired of trying and tired of being alone, oh

Reach out when you're feeling low
Tell me everything I need to know
I want to see you smiling
Come on tell me how it really is
I'm sick of keeping up appearances
Don't tell me you've stopped fighting

Dancing through the night in electric light
Wishing it could be this way forever
You don't have to hide, I'll be by your side
Always better when we do it together

Most of us are strangers who want someone to save us
We're looking out for angels and something we can hold on
We hear sirens and suffer in the silence
Getting tired of trying and tired of being alone, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

I see you start to move and then I watch you freeze
Thinking they won't care for anything you speak
I don't wanna lose you, I need you with me
I don't want to sit and watch history repeat
I see you start to move and then I watch you freeze
Thinking they won't care for anything you speak
I don't wanna lose you, I need you with me
I don't want to sit and watch history repeat

Most of us are strangers who want someone to save us
We're looking out for angels and something we can hold on
We hear sirens and suffer in the silence
Getting tired of trying and tired of being alone, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
