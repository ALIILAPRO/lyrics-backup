		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're breaking my paradise
Hearing an echo cry
Don't be fool for stealing hearts
Dreamland at your fate
You never find your way
Don't be fool for tears of love
All precious memories, you had through the years
All they are passing one by one
You kill the memories
Wave off the pain and tears
Baby, together we are strong

Ten thousand lonely drums
Are playing in my heart
Ten thousand drums of dreaming fell apart
Ten thousand drums are playing just for you
Ten thousand drums are saying I'm missing you

Oh, my drums
They're playing in your mind
Thinking of endless lovers
Some too hard
Oh my drums
I never let you go
They give the mimic of a lonely drum

Like a hero will smile again
If you will play this game
Don't be a thief for stealin' hearts
Like all the thousand smiles
It takes a little while
Don't be fool for tears I love
Welcome to paradise
If you will realize
Then passing one by one
You kill the memories
Wave off the pain and fears
Baby, together we are strong
