		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's a man lying down
in a grave somewhere
With the same tattoos as me
And I love him, I love him, I love him…

There's a man lying down
in a bed somewhere
With a different set of sex aspects
And I hate him, I hate him, I hate him
I hate him, my eyes…

This is me here now
Pining like a dog
Whining like a dog in a thick harbour fog
Waiting for a ship that will make him sick

And when the ship comes - big trouble
His trouble will begin

And the church bells chime
The colour of wine
And the angels devil fight
To snatch back the last time

This is the dark age of love

And I love him, I love him, I love him…

There's a man laying down
Somewhere…
