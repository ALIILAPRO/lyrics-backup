		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's by Yamaica Productions, baby
Crud
Mad

It's bait, they're fake
I was sleeping, then a man got snaked
Tryna rob Russ, what a big mistake
Talk about drill, then I come first place
Ching that head, neck, belly or face
Man try run, then give him a chase
Anyone get set, I don't mind race
Slap this one, make your whole block shake
Make a block vibrate
Mention sister and I get irate
Man put- in a spliff, not grave
They don't wanna buck Russ adding up K's
Got all my opps on ropes
These music boys don't want no smoke
Paigon gyal love to use their throat
Bad boy dip, make scream out woah
Make the gyaldem work, twerk
She got contour on my shirt
Step in the dance, the gyaldem flirt
Thought it was cologne how the man disperse
Outside like a fox
Can't wait 'til I get that drop
Victim, they make me lean and bop
If the mandem lurk then you can't go shop
It's mad, I got options
Ten-ten girls that I'm choppin'
Hop in, straight on my John, she's sloppin'
We don't care if the neighbours watchin'
Hold up-hold up shawty
Peng lighties and caramel Barbie
Don't wife her if she still goes carni'
Boujee bitch, like my lady's classy
Skid 'round there, nearly ripped man's tyre
Two man step with smoke and fire
Lock and load when I back this fire
Dem man are good liars
Peng gyal got their eyes on Russ
Tek' time girl, I don't want no hug
Opp thots tryna show man love
And all the olders on the ends are rubbed
Touch anyone, not kids and women
Me and bro-bro need .44's twinnin'
Life ain't sweet, got gyal where you're livin'
Christian but I done 'nuff sinnin'
Splashy, show them Olympic chingin'
Mad me, straight to your gaff I'm headin'
It's fryin', the beef ain't deadin'
Everything's hot like my gyal from Reading
Russ with a Russ, I'm a real cash earner
Can't size up, rudeboy, you're a worker
When I was young, went halves on burners
Need a big Mac with fries, no burger
Attempt was the case but I wanted murder
Russ and Buni, the whole gang's lurkin'
Pull up on them when man's not workin'
Bronze gyal love the dick, man's surfin'
