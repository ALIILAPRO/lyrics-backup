		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't wanna look down, when I can't get up
And I feel like I'm dying
All these helpless thoughts
Got me feeling fucked up
But I gotta learn to help myself
Everything around me's falling down
Broken now I'm lost inside the sound
(Sound)

I'm holding onto something more, oh
I hear the screams inside these walls, walls
I know that I'm tryna fight a losing fight
Tryna hold on while feeling like I'm gonna die
I'm holding onto something more
I'm breaking out tonight
(Breaking out tonight)

I don't wanna look down, I can't get up
I'm sick of trying
All these haunted dreams have fucked me up
But I gotta learn to help myself

Everything around me's falling down (down)
Broken now I'm lost inside the sound, oh

I'm holding onto something more, oh
I hear the screams inside these walls, walls
I know that I'm tryna fight a losing fight
Tryna hold on while feeling like I'm gonna die
I'm holding onto something more
I'm breaking out tonight

Backed down, almost lost my faith
Backed down, almost lost my faith
Tryna get back what I can't replace

Ticking like a time bomb
Pressure's got me feeling numb
I just wanna walk away, ooh
Ticking like a time bomb
Pressure's got me feeling numb
Oh God, I wanna feel it, feel it

(Kick it) yeah
Everything around me's falling down
Broken now I'm lost inside the sound

I'm holding onto something more, oh
I hear the screams inside these walls, oh no
I'm holding on
I'm holding on

I'm holding onto something more, oh
I hear the screams inside these walls, walls
I know that I'm tryna fight a losing fight
Tryna hold on while feeling like I'm gonna die
I'm holding onto something more
I'm breaking out tonight
