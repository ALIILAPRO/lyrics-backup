		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Real bitches back in
I came here to win, you hoes came here to pretend
I'ma show you rap hoes how to get y'all shit off
Yeah

First thing first (huh?)
I ain't gotta fuck a rap nigga for a verse (not at all)
And I ain't never let a nigga treat me for a purse
So all you unemployed hoes, come and get this work (work)
You bitches sleezy, this shit way to easy
City lil' me, I'm puttin' on like Jeezy (I'm puttin' on)
I ain't asthmatic, but this spit game wheezy (hah-hah)
Put these rap hoes on the plate just to feed me, I'm gettin' greedy
I'm big Key (yeah)
I'm not sweet, I check hoes (check 'em)
Steady shittin' on these bitches, where the Pepto
Your nigga want a taste, I give him wet nose
Takin' bitches' niggas, ho you lucky if you make it home

I'ma real bitch (real bitch), don't fold
Fuck a nigga get paid, that's code (that's code)
I don't choose, bad bitches get chose
These hoes way too weak, I'm cold
I'ma real bitch (real bitch), don't fold
Fuck a nigga get paid, that's code (that's code)
I don't choose, bad bitches get chose
These hoes way too weak, I'm cold

I'ma real bitch, with a real bag
Ayy, word to Miami, bitch, I'm real bad
New nigga, new money that's a real grab
I ain't stuntin' no nigga that I been had (Gloss)

I'ma real bitch, you a fake bitch, red flag (red flag)
What you doin'? Nothin' shit, makin' hoes mad (on God)
Bitch, I just signed with QC and got a big bag (big bag)
And finna show you why these ratchet bitches real bad
Watch me take yo' nigga, like I take his dick
He want dog ass bitch, until I show him some tricks (come here)
I'm a big dog, bitch, don't compare me to simps (don't compare me, ho)
My two kids was born rich, why you work at a temp'?

I'ma real bitch (real bitch), don't fold
Fuck a nigga get paid, that's code (that's code)
I don't choose, bad bitches get chose
These hoes way too weak, I'm cold
I'ma real bitch (real bitch), don't fold
Fuck a nigga get paid, that's code (that's code)
I don't choose, bad bitches get chose
These hoes way too weak, I'm cold

My neck and my wrist
He ain't gotta cheque, he ain't talkin' 'bout shit
Doggin' these niggas every time that I spit
Say he want Lakeyah, I done came up on a lick
Ice out my neck, and my wrist
He ain't gotta cheque, he ain't talkin' 'bout shit
Doggin' these niggas every time that I spit
Say he want Lakeyah, I done came up on a lick
Nigga, run me that shit
