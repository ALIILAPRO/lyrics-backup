		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What's in the back of my mind, sittin' in the back of that thang
With the two double R sittin' in the back of my brain
Anywhere but here, that's what I told my sofa
And this shit gettin' heavy, weight of the world on my shoulders
Think you figured it out, but you don't have a clue
Think you on top of the world but the world on top of you
I started hustlin' for draws and now there's plaques on the walls
Think I'm sellin' my soul? Then you can come get 'em all
Trade 'em all for my dawgs, yea, I'm talkin' to you
Where did we go wrong? Because I don't have a clue
You just wanna hit the mall and buy a new pair of shoes
But it's real consequences nigga remember the rules
So I regret the day you ever serve that nigga
Took 5 years of your life, you didn't deserve that nigga
I guess power and pain look it's somewhat the same
I lost my dawg to the fame, I charge it all to the game

Please Lord forgive him, you know he got that thug in him
We lust for alcohol and we love women
And ain't nobody gave us nothin', so we drug dealin'
You know we coppin' Louie loafers just to thug in 'em
And when you made it that far, you should be makin' a toast
Got the seats reclined and I be doin' the most
In the back of this Holy Ghost

I said we came so far but yet it feel so surreal
Hood nigga, half a mili, automobile
I'm talkin' real luxury, don't feel a bump in the road
We ain't like the rest of these niggas that fall out over hoes
Thought you my nigga forever, thought that you could be trusted
Man I found out you takin' it, really had me disgusted
Nigga, who am I kiddin'? It felt like a heart attack
Cause I gave you my heart and didn't ask for it back
And to be honest with you, I really thought we were brothers
Fuck everyone in this world as long as we have each other
Woulda done anyything, took a trafficking charge
Everyday on my head just to see you livin' large
Gangster pitted it kills, gave you your first mill
And I ain't tell you to blow it, I ain't tell you to throw it
You fell a victim to pressure, yea, I know it can stress ya
But you're only a man, homie, I can't be mad at ya

Please Lord forgive him, you know he got that thug in him
We lust for alcohol and we love women
And ain't nobody gave us nothin', so we drug dealin'
You know we coppin' Louie loafers just to thug in 'em
And when you made it that far, you should be makin' a toast
Got the seats reclined and I be doin' the most
In the back of this Holy Ghost

How can ya see out the windows between your shades and your tint
Sippin' good in the back, I'm like fuck it, I'm bent
If it don't make dollars, then it don't make any sense
They sayin' I owe 'em dollars and that don't make any sense
Almost fell for the bait, almost fell for the hate
And I'm the same nigga that let you niggas eat off my plate
Saw that shit from the door, knew that shit from the go
I guess this how I go, sit back and laugh at the show
Remember back in the day a nigga took your shit
Told you don't put it there and a nigga stole your brick
Didn't I put ya back on, did I handle ya wrong?
When niggas start actin' weak that means it time to be strong
See I kept it so real, I ain't keep it real with myself
I'm gone be real with you niggas, I gotta be real with myself
And I'm gone be real with ya homie, look you don't got me convinced
Is this payback for my sins? I guess I gotta repent

Please Lord forgive him, you know he got that thug in him
We lust for alcohol and we love women
And ain't nobody gave us nothin', so we drug dealin'
You know we coppin' Louie loafers just to thug in 'em
And when you made it that far, you should be makin' a toast
Got the seats reclined and I be doin' the most
In the back of this Holy Ghost
