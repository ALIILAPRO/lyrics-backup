		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fasten your seatbelts we'll take off this ride 
I'll do it, I'll do it with you

Flap your wings into the dark misty sky
I'll do it, I'll do it with you

Conquer the clouds that holds heavy rain
I'll do it, I'll do it with you

Lift each other up, yeah
We shall rise above the ashes
And I know that we'll arive
Together, together, together, together, together

No wind that we can't break
No dreams that we can't chase
No fall that we can't face
Together we fly 

No wind that we can't break
No dreams that we can't chase
No fall that we can't face
Together we fly

I'm armed unafraid because you cleared up my sky
I'll be here, I'll be here with you

Turbulent flows will not shake our souls down
I'll fight it, I'll fight it with you

Lift each other up, yeah
We shall rise above the ashes
And I know that we'll arive
Together, together, together, together, together

No wind that we can't break
No dreams that we can't chase
No fall that we can't face
Together we fly

It haunts me and taunts
The hustling winds, they despise me
Catches whispers around me
Should I fight? Should I cry?

Ohh... The loss and the shatter
As you're here it doesn't matter
Your wings protect all my power
You're my flight, you're my guide

It causes no shiver
The flames will not die or wither
Because you brought me the star
I know we where born to shine
Shine

No wind, that we cannot break
No dreams, that we cannot chase
No fall that we cannot face
Together, together, together we fly 

Together, together, together, together, together we'll fly 
High
No fall that we can't face together we fly

No wind
No wind
That we can't break 
No dreams 
No dream
That we can't chase
We can't chase
No fall that we can't face together we fly
No wind that we can't break
No wind that we not we not, we cannot chase

No fall that we can't face
Together we fly
Together we fly
No wind that can't break
No dreams that we can't chase
That We Cannot chase, ohh yeah
No Fall that we can't face
Together, together 
We fly
