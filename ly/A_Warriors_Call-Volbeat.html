		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let's get ready to rumble

Feel the fire, he's entered the ring
His mindset only knows how to win
This Danish fighter will break you in two
You will feel all his power

The Viking warrior Mikkel Kessler
Will now brand his name, in the back of your head, yeah
You'll feel the floor again, unleashing his hell
You will not even hear the bell
Maybe you're strong, but you don't stand a chance

Feel the power of a warrior, fight fight fight fight
Let's get ready to rumble, fight fight fight fight

Breaking your record and breaking your bones
Born a warrior with a code
A champion feeding your face with a fist
You will feel all his power

The Viking warrior Mikkel Kessler
Will now brand his name, in the back of your head, yeah
You'll feel the floor again, unleashing his hell
You will not even hear the bell
Maybe you're strong, but you don't stand a chance

Feel the power of a warrior, fight fight fight fight
Let's get ready to rumble, fight fight fight fight
A gladiators left hand hook, fight fight fight fight
Feel the pain tomorrow

Behold, here comes the son
Believe it, he was born to be the chosen one
The call is for a warrior
His name will echo on the sea and on the ground

Feel the fire, he's entered the ring
His mindset only knows how to win
This Danish fighter will break you in two
You will feel all his power

The Viking warrior Mikkel Kessler
Will now brand his name, in the back of your head yeah
You'll feel the floor again, unleashing his hell
You will not even hear the bell
Maybe you're strong, but you don't stand a chance

Feel the power of a warrior, fight fight fight fight
Let's get ready to rumble, fight fight fight fight
A gladiators left hand hook, fight fight fight fight
Feel the pain tomorrow

Behold here comes the son
Believe it, he was born to be the chosen one
The call is for a warrior
His name will echo on the sea and on the ground
