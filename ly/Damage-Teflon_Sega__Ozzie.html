		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So you tell me that you're coming down
And you tell me you need me around
And you blame it on the drugs 
I don't give a f*ck cus the damage is done
You got secrets I don't need to ask
You'd only tell that its in the past 
Another Bullet in the gun
I don't give a f*ck 
Cus  the damage is done 
Now we're hollow on the inside
Now it defines us
And you talk about suicide
It's the way you manipulate 
And you want me right back there
This time I'm not scared
I don't care

I'll be anywhere but there, there, there, there
I don't f*cking care, care, care 
I'll be anywhere but there

Better on my on so much better on my own 
If you need me there I don't care
Better on my on so much better all alone
If you need me there I don't care
Took over my mind 
Till my thoughts turned black
Water into wine there's no turning back
Poison in my lungs its a heart a attack
I won't come back

I'll be anywhere but there, there, there, there
I don't f*cking care, care, care 
I'll be anywhere but there
