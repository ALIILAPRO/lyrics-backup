		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm livin' this life to the fullest
I don't wanna hear no shit you wouldn't
'Cause you could it but you couldn't
Will I show a nigga how to do it?
Pull up on, already see him lookin'
Done get your girl tooken
I'm ridin' through
Creepin' and I'm cookin'
And don't you even try to play stupid
I'm really gonna do it
All I do is play my own music
'Cause all you lil' rap niggas clueless
You foolless to even do it

Yuh, ayy
Bitch, Baby Bone, quit, I break a bitch back
No slack, get my MAC
I gave that pussy toe tag
Big bags in the all-black Volvo
Look over my shoulders, I can't trust a soul
(I can't trust a soul)
Too many rappers I know been killed
For less than a mill' (Bitch)
Off of the realest
(yeah) , too many people dead
Feed on that fuck shit, suckin' it for clout
(Ayy, ayy, yuh)

I'm doin' what I can to keep a balance
Why you hoes still being slick?
Why you gotta act childish?
Pull up, flip a show and then we out it
I don't think he goin' this hard
I don't think that he about it
She trippin', I'ma make her way up out it
I don't break a sweat for nobody
Nigga, no way around it
Pull up to a nigga like I found him
Hollow Squad came too deep
Look at how we gon' surround 'em

Bitch, I'm rich, he ain't gonna bloat it
Semi-automatic, mama told me
"Keep it loaded" broken bones, bloodshed
Dead eyes and a mouth from me
Overdosin' now and nobody will ever notice
Bitch, I'm floatin', look at my stash sheet
Baby mama still think I'm a deadbeat
This world will never accept me
Fuck your life, don't even look at me
