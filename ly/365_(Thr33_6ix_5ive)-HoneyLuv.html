		  We go up, down, left, right
Think I need you by my side
Three hundred and sixty-five, sixty-five
We go up, down, left, right
Think I need you by my side
Three hundred and sixty-five, sixty-five

We go na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na
We go, we go na-na-na-na-na

We go, we go up, down, left, right
Think I need you by my side
Three hundred and sixty-five, sixty-five
We go up, down, left, right
Think I need you by my side
