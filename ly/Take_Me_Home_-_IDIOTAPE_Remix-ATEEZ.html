		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey

Locked inside the dark
Where I'm suffocating deeper, I'm just falling down
Deeper, I'm falling down

Blocked in every way
I can't even choose my way around I'm terrified
I'm getting terrified

No one here, no one, not anyone
Nobody cares about me
That cold looks you give that gaze you give
Make tears in my eyes

아름다울수록 가시가 박혀 쓰려와
망가지는 걸 알면서도 난 또 기로 앞에
눈물 닦아 사방이 검붉기에
왼쪽 가슴에 신념을 달고 날아

Somebody takes me home
I don't wanna be alone anymore every night
That place of my dreams
Somebody takes me there
Getting out of the gray city following the light
To that place in our memory

Over and over again

Yo
누군가는 날 가두고
또 누군가는 날 구조해
그 누군가가 날 등지면
누군가는 날 위로해
Alone, alone, alone, I'm not alone
외딴섬이라도 무인도는 아니니깐 alive, yeah

Why always me?
What I do wrong?
What am I in the rain for, in the rain for?
Rain in my tears, pouring in my eyes
Is it something that you sent to me? Oh, no

Gonna get out of here
Go back to my dreams right now
So tell me how to go to other side

Somebody takes me home
I don't wanna be alone anymore every night
That place of my dreams
Somebody takes me there
Getting out of the gray city following the light
To that place in our memory

Under the red sun I stand
Let's hold hands 'til the sun falls down
With warm eyes I wanna melt your soul
If we share our dreams
You can feel the vibe and just smile away
Go back to the place in time

People cannot live alone
Don't leave me now (don't leave me now)
Don't leave me now (don't leave me now)
Oh, take me home

Take me please out of the dark
Take me please out of the calm
고통을 받을 자격 나조차도 없어
돌려줄게 받고 사라져줘 take me now

Somebody takes me home
I don't wanna be alone anymore every night
The place of my dreams
Somebody takes me there
Getting out of the gray city following the light
To that place in our memory
(Hey)
