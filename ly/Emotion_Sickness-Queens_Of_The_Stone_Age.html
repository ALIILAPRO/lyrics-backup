		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Use once and destroy
Single servings of pain
A dose of emotion sickness
I just can't shake
Then my fever broke

You got no possessions, just depression, girl
See the sights
Hold your breath, feel as you might
Whoa, let some pieces free
You're atrocious, f-ferocious, yeah
Change the price, out of my mind like a slice
Yeah, absolutely

Don't care for me
Baby, don't care for me
Had to let her go, oh
Baby, don't care for me
Baby, don't care for me
Had to let her go, oh

Gotta vacuum all the perfume, yeah
Hit the lights
Keep your chin out of sight
Whoa, it's givin' me the creeps
Why don't you come? Go and get some, girl
Put up a fight
Well, let's have it right now

Baby, don't care for me
Baby, don't care for me
Had to let her go, oh
People come and go on the breeze
For a whole life, possibly
I don't really know, oh

The flick of the switch
So smooth and clean
The regrow is so painful, believe you me
Then my fever broke
Then my fever broke
Then my fever broke

Baby, don't care for me
Baby, don't care for me
Had to let her go, oh
People come and go on the breeze
For a whole life, possibly
I don't really know, oh

Baby, don't care for me
Baby, don't care for me
Had to let her go, oh
People come and go on the breeze
For a whole life, possibly
I don't really know, oh
