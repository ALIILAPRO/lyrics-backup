		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There we were in the back of that old Z71
The road was dirt, a couple kids waitin' on the sun
Cherry red, and baby, I still recall the taste
We were a few beers shy of freedom, I had my hands around your waist

You said, "Babe, I'm gettin' cold"
I said, "Climb on in my jacket"
You already know
Like my heart, you can have it

Ooh, I don't remember what the radio was playin'
I was hangin' like the moon on all the words your lips were sayin'
All I know is there was magic in that Chevy
Baby, you were glowin', God was throwin' stars like confetti, ah
Stars like confetti, ah

Yeah, rusted truck, dusted-up boots and high on a perfume buzz
That see-forever sky wasn't near as high as us
Yeah, our hearts were beatin' faster than a runaway midnight train
We couldn't say forever, but we said it anyway

Baby, hold me tight
And never let me go
Look up at the sky
Heaven's puttin' on a show

I don't remember what the radio was playin'
I was hangin' like the moon on all the words your lips were sayin'
All I know is there was magic in that Chevy
Baby, you were glowin', God was throwin' stars like confetti, ah
We made a wish on every one, ah
We held on 'til it was done, whoa

I don't remember what the radio was playin'
I was hangin' like the moon on all the words you're sayin'
All I know is there was magic in that Chevy
Baby, you were glowin', God was throwin' stars like confetti, ah
Stars like confetti, ah

I don't remember what the radio was playin'
I was hangin' like the moon on all the words your lips were sayin'
All I know is there was magic in that Chevy
Baby, you were glowin', God was throwin' stars like confetti, ah
We made a wish on every one, ah
Yeah, we held on 'til it was done, whoa
Stars like confetti, ah
No, no, no
