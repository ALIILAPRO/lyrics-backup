		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Woah yeow

They try kicking and screaming
Contation break us apart
In life .....will hold you down
I'm sorry give my life to you
Another day you fall and I get away
Pushing and screaming cause
They found

Hey

Take my hand and fly
Will you ever be that tall
Don't you be afraid
We're not gonna fall

Did you think
I'd let you mix it up
Give me a reason bitch
You're gonna fuck it up

Hey

Take my hand and fly
Will you ever be that tall
Don't you be afraid
We're not gonna fall

Hey


Do you believe in what we've got
Try it, one shot
We stand once and for all
We're not gonna fall

Well you thought you had the authority
To slay and kill the minority
Together we stand tall
Not gonna crash, not gonna fall

Did you think I'd let you mix it up
Give me a reason bitch
We're gonna fuck you up
It's real, into the charge

At the end we're standing up
