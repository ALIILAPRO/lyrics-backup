		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know 
Caught up in the middle 
I cry, just a little 
When I think of letting go
Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry, just a little 
When I think of letting go

Know you wanna get behind the wheel, but only one Rida
Eyes shut, still got me swimming like a diver
Can't let go, I got fans in Okinawa
My heart to Japan, quake losers and survivors
Norway, no, you didn't get my flowers
No way to say it better, but the killer was a coward
Face just showers, the minute in a hour
Heard about the news, whole day went sour
Bitter moments got me feeling like a lemon-head
Put you in the box just as poisonous as cigarettes
There go my regards but regardless I get arrested
Ain't worried about the killers, just the young and restless
Get mad 'cause a quarter million on my necklace
D.U.I., never said I was driving reckless
You and I know that jealously is not impressive
Oh no, I can't stop, I was destined

I know 
Caught up in the middle 
I cry, just a little 
When I think of letting go
Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry, just a little 
When I think of letting go
I know 
Caught in the middle 
I cry, just a little 
When I think of letting go
Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry, just a little 
When I think of letting go

Champagne buckets still got two tears in it
And I put that on my tattoo of Jimi Hendrix
Get the pressed leather outfit all in it
'Cause the press tell it all, get a meal ticket
Clean next, get the call, just a lil' visit
Sacrifice just to make a hit still vivid
Reality, see when you're blessed just kill critics
Bugatti never meant I'm rich, just God fearing
Look at me steering, got the blogs staring
Gotta good feeling, Mr. Mike Caren
Tell his Billie Jeans, I'm on another planet
Thank E-Class, Big Chuck and Lee Prince Perries
Buy my mama chandeliers, I'm in tears, dammit
Thirty years you'd thought these emotions vanish
Tryna live, tryna figure how your sister vanish
No cheers, I know you wouldn't panic

I know 
Caught up in the middle 
I cry, just a little 
When I think of letting go
Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry, just a little 
When I think of letting go
I know 
Caught in the middle 
I cry, just a little 
When I think of letting go
Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry, just a little 
When I think of letting go

When I need a healing, I just look up to the ceiling
I see the sun coming down, I know it's all better now
When I need a healing, I just look up to the ceiling
I see the sun coming down, I know it's all better now
When I need a healing, I just look up to the ceiling
I see the sun coming down, I know it's all better now
When I need a healing, I just look up to the ceiling
I see the sun coming down, I know it's all better now

I know
I know
I know
I know
I, I, I, I
I think of letting go, go, go

I know 
Caught in the middle 
I cry, just a little 
When I think of letting go
Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry, just a little 
When I think of letting go
I know 
Caught in the middle 
I cry, just a little 
When I think of letting go
Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry, just a little 
When I think of letting go
