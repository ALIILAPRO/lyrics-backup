		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  Nah-nah, nah-nah, nah-nah-nah
Nah-nah, nah-nah, nah-nah-nah

I dream in color and I sleep on a canvas
I think we all need each other
Empathy, that could be our advantage
Bad bitch speak Creole and Spanish
She look this way, then I'm likin' my chances
Oh, man, why I go on these tangents?
Bird's eye view, this shit panoramic
Still fightin' off my paranoia, shit too real, just fired my lawyer
Trust issues, I'm needin' to fix it, that could be an empire destroyer
You seen what happened to Julius Caesar
Stevie Wonder told me, "You are a leader"
My girl'll forfeit a tennis match to meet my grandmama
Man, she truly a keeper (huh)

And I know why these blessings is comin'
Rich as hell, won't stress over nothin'
I don't listen to the public opinion
Their portrayal, it is just an assumption
And I don't really know what a nigga been fightin' for, but I'm fightin' for it
And every song that I record be savin' lives, I'm type important
If I shoot my shot (mmm, swish, mmm, Michael Jordan)
And if I get a lot (it came from the mic recordin')

Hold on, uh
Baby, that's the difference
From other niggas makin' bad decisions
Good music, that attract the business
My last album was a fuckin' classic
You can listen to that shit from start to finish
Got good intentions and my heart relentless
Drive a Honda Civic with the windows tinted
Plus a Lamb' truck, but that shit was rented
Never no pretendin', let's be transparent
I learned that shit from my grandparents
I've been meditatin', tryna gain clearance
But this life shit isn't coherent, it's a bitch
Wonder why I'm so down with the shits?
Single mom, no co-parents in this bitch
Used to walk to the library for the Wi-Fi
It was like four Karens in that bitch
But what's your purpose? What's your motives?
What's your dreams? What's your goals is?
Are your thoughts pure? Are you focused?
This a real nigga diagnosis
Are your friends real? Are they bogus?
Are they by your side at your lowest?
Though I'm not so easily broken
But at times, I feel hopeless

Huh, and I know why these blessings is comin'
Rich as hell, won't stress over nothin'
I don't listen to the public opinion
Their portrayal, it is just an assumption
And I don't really know what a nigga been fightin' for, but I'm fightin' for it
And every song that I record be savin' lives, I'm type important
If I shoot my shot (mmm, swish, mmm, Michael Jordan)
And if I get a lot (it came from the mic recordin')

Mmm-mm, oh (oh-oh-oh)
Mm-mm
Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm

Nah-nah, nah-nah, nah-nah-nah-nah, yeah, yeah
Nah-nah, nah-nah, nah-nah-nah-nah, yeah, yeah
