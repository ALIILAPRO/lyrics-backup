		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Verbal couture
Parkour
With the metaphors
The flow house of horror
Dead bolted with metal doors
Grinch bitch
Six sense
With a nose drip
Mind skydive
Sniffing bumps
In the cockpit
Locksmith of Hip Hop
Appraisal the wrist watch
The rocks bout the size
As the teeth in Chris Rock's mouth
Sock out the mic
Prototype for Adderall
Your work killing fiends
Cause you cut it with Fentanyl
So much coke
Just to sniff need a ski lift
Flip your table over
If you cut it with the bullshit
Nose bleeds red carpets
But it just blend in
Snapping pictures
Feeling my chest being sunk in
Live a fast life
Seen many die slowly
Unhappy when they left
So I try to seize the moment

Funny how it happens
Who ever would imagine
That jokes on you
But Satan the one laughing

Ain't it funny how it happens
Ain't it
Ain't it funny how it happens
Ain't it
Ain't it funny how it happens
Ain't it

I can sell honey to a bee
In the fall time
Make trees
Take back they leaves
Octopus in a straight jacket
Savage with bad habits
Broke serving fiends
Got rich became a addict
Ain't it funny how it happens
Who would ever would imagine
Nose running right now
Could ya pass me a napkin
Managed to somehow
To have the upper advantage
Panic when the drugs are gone
And nobody is answering
Ain't it funny how it happens
Ain't it
Ain't it funny how it happens
No way to mask it
A lot became has beens
Rolling up that 100 dollar bill
Till they cash in
Thinks it gone last
Going too fast
Man it's fucked up
Ain't it funny how it happens

Ain't it funny how it happens
Ain't it
Ain't it funny how it happens
Ain't it
Ain't it funny how it happens
Ain't it
Ain't it funny how it happen

Upcoming heavy traffic
Say ya need to slow down
Cause you feel yourself crashing
Staring in the devil face
But ya can't stop laughing
Staring in the devil face
But ya can't stop laughing
It's a living nightmare
That most of us might share
Inherited in our blood
It's why we stuck in the mud
Can't quit the drug use
Or the alcohol abuse
Even if I wanted to
Tell you what I'm gonna do
I'ma wash away my problems
With this bottle of Henny
Anxiety got the best of me
So popping them Xannies
Might need rehab
But to me that shit pussy
Pray for me y'all
Cause I don't know what coming to me
Bought a 8 ball of coke
And my nigga on the way
Got 3 hoes with him
And they all tryna play

Ain't it funny how it happens
Who ever would imagine
Jokes on you
But Satan the one laughing

Ain't it funny how it happens
Ain't it
Ain't it funny how it happens
Ain't it
Ain't it funny how it happens
Ain't it
