		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Nightmares come as they go
Recurring as they show
The movie I've seen
way too many times
Don't ask me how it all ends
Just count your stars and pray
That there wont be
a part for you to play

Let me break it down
While you're racking up your brain
It's a constant downpour
And never only rain

Push me for more mileage
Or drive me fuckin' insane
It don't matter to me
Just pick a lane
You've been on this trip before
How long until you learn
I'm a suicide bomber
Born to crush and burn
Flying on a suicide bomber

Let me break it down
While you're racking up your brain
Its a constant downpour
And never only rain

Flying on a suicide bomber
We're gonna crash
We're gonna crash
We're gonna burn
We're gonna burn

Flying on a suicide bomber
We're gonna crash
We're gonna crash
We're gonna burn
We're gonna burn
