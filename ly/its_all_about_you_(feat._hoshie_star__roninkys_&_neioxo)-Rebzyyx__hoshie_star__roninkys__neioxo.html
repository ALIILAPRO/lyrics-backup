		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How did I find a girl like you?
Take my money, it's nothing to me at all
It's all about you
It's all about you
It's all about you
I get sad when you have to go
Write all about you all in my notes
Waiting for you, I hope you know
I hope you know
I hope you know

How did I find a girl like you?
Take my money, it's nothing to me at all
It's all about you
It's all about you
It's all about you
I get sad when you have to go
Write all about you all in my notes
Waiting for you, I hope you know
I hope you know
I hope you know

Wake up in the morning and I'm feeling like shit
Get out of bed and my fuckin' head hurts
Said "I bet you love me", do you really mean it?
I don't know if I believe it
Maybe I'm just stupid, I don't know
I fucking hate this feeling I'mma go
Out into the park and kill myself, oh
You see me go-oh

You see me go
You can watch me grow
And I don't know (I don't know)
If I need you (if I need you)
I wish I did (wish I did)
You're in my head
But you make me, feel fuckin' dead

You're my favorite chick
I don't want something after this
We should stick together, I don't wanna split
Promise we're forever, don't go back on it
You're my favorite drug
I just wanna give you all my love
Lay in bed, we can kiss and hug
Hope you know you're my favorite one

I don't pop Xans, baby, you're my drug
We can lay here in the graves I dug
Thoughts of you, yeah, they'll never stop
We can lay here in the graves I dug
I know I'm full of cuts, but I want you in my arms
I know I fucking suck, but I need you and it's hard
Pass me like a blunt, baby, take it way too far
And my life's a broken dream, wake me on the boulevard

Baby, please trust me
I know you wanna be with me
But baby, please don't leave
I know you're obsessed with me
You're obsessed with me, yeah
I know that you won't hurt me
Baby, please tell me you love me

How did I find a girl like you?
Take my money, it's nothing to me at all
It's all about you
It's all about you
It's all about you
I get sad when you have to go
Write all about you all in my notes
Waiting for you, I hope you know
I hope you know
I hope you know

How did I find a girl like you?
Take my money, it's nothing to me at all
It's all about you
It's all about you
It's all about you
I get sad when you have to go
Write all about you all in my notes
Waiting for you, I hope you know
I hope you know
I hope you know

I'm watching you and I'm waiting
For the perfect time to start participating
and you signal me to stay
But I open my mouth anyway
