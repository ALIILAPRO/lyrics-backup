		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We've got a bit of love hate
Take me to the edge then you hit the breaks
I say it's over one day
Then I'm crawling back begging you to stay

Make up then we break up all the time

Say that I hate a song
Then you go request it the whole night long
Some people say it's so wrong
But even when we fight, girl, you turn me on

Make up then we break up all the time

We're like na, na, na
Then we're like yeah, yeah, yeah
Always like na, na, na
Then we're like yeah, yeah, yeah

No we can't make up our minds
'Cause when we think we got it right

We go na, na, na, na, na, na

You were at a party too late
When I do the same all you do is complain
You know that it drives me insane
But when I get with you girl, you make it okay

Make up then we break up all the time

We're like na, na, na
Then we're like yeah, yeah, yeah
Always like na, na, na
Then we're like yeah, yeah, yeah

No we can't make up our minds
'Cause when we think we got it right

We go na, na, na, na, na, na

Na, na, na, yeah, yeah, yeah
Na, na, na, yeah, yeah, yeah

Oh, it drives me mad

Na, na, na, na, na, na

We're like na, na, na
Then we're like yeah, yeah, yeah
Always like na, na, na
Then we're like yeah, yeah, yeah

We're like na, na, na
Then we're like yeah, yeah, yeah
Always like na, na, na
Then we're like yeah, yeah, yeah

No, we can't make up our minds
'Cause when we think we've got it right

We go na, na, na
