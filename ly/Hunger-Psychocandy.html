		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The thirst
My mouth feels dry
And the hunger
Is all that's left inside
And the fiending
About to lose my mind
And the creeping
I need it tonight
I'll wait to see
The shadows calling me
Alone, I'm ready
Tonight I'll follow them
Away from here
And fill the longing
I have felt inside
I need to satisfy
The thirst
I can't see straight
And the hunger
Is keeping me awake
And I wonder
How long I can wait
Cause I'm fearing
It might be too late
Don't fade away
I feel you haunting me
The cold is now
My comfort holding me
You're close
I almost hear your heartbeat
The ghost I know
I can't let go
The thirst
Has taken its toll
Draining my soul, losing control
The hunger
Has taken me whole
I'll waste away
Outside your door
Just for one taste
One moment to be yours
I need one taste
So pure, never again
If you would feed the hunger
This could end
