		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Serving the faith 
Abduction the oath 
It lie in wait for the offering 
Religion is old 
For drawing the young 
Purity withers and dies 
Never return to the ones that provided 
Children draining parents of will 
I hold out my hand to bloodless child 
I'm taken by the one I was saving 
From death (death, death, death)

By demons, be driven (driven)
By demons, be driven (be driven)
Oh

Beckon the call, beckon the call
Beckon the call, beckon the call
Beckon the call, beckon the call
Beckon the call, beckon the call

With decline in mind, end not far 
We're left hanging alone here 
He pulls us from nails 
Shatters our bones 
Leaving us crippled and strewn 
Boiling my corpse in the blood of his children 
Praying for his god to prevail 
Burying us with loved ones 
To sleep with shelled children
Of the sixth dimension (dimension, dimension, dimension)

By demons, be driven (driven)
By demons, be driven (be driven)
Oh

Beckon the call, beckon the call
Beckon the call, beckon the call
Beckon the call, beckon the call
Beckon the call, beckon the call

By demons, be driven (driven)
By demons, be driven (be driven)
Oh

Beckon the call, beckon the call
Beckon the call, beckon the call
Beckon the call, beckon the call
Beckon the call, beckon the call

By (beckon the call, beckon the call) (by demons)
Demons (beckon the call, beckon the call) (be driven)
Be (beckon the call, beckon the call) (by demons)
Driven (beckon the call, beckon the call) (be driven)
