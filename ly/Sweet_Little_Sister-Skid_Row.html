		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She blew my mind behind a record machine
She was a shitload of trouble called the Subway Queen
Had a hip with bad habits and a shake that was a bit obscene

One night I caught her running out the cellar door
There was about a million people lying flat on the floor
For such a sweet little lady, I would swear she's rotten to the core
Oh yes

She got her hands in the cookie jar
Smiling like an alligator
Makin' headlines in the back of the car
Tight-lipped now but sink ships later

Well, I know a thing or two about a 
Sweet little sister
Her mom would kill her if she knew what she do, she's my
Sweet little sister
She'll love you black and blue
Sweet little sister
She's Mona Lisa with a new tattoo
She's my sweet little
Sweet little sister 

Say, every quittin' time is another disease
Too many cowboys ridin' high, shootin' low at the knees
The back hand boogie is the price you pay for being the squeeze

The petting's getting heavy, got a tongue in her ear
Her friend is doing time for kickin' ass on a queer
They're in a mental state and all their friends are here
Oh yes

She's tellin' lies through her burgundy lips
Angel on a mission of mercy
She'll get you dancin' with the crack of the whip
She'll take you up to heaven in her rocket ship

I know a thing or two about a 
Sweet little sister
Her mom would kill her if she knew what she do, she's my
Sweet little sister
She'll love you black and blue
Sweet little sister
She's Mona Lisa with a new tattoo
She's so sweet, oh, sweet as candy

She got her hands in the cookie jar
Smiling like an alligator
Makin' headlines in the back of the car
Tight-lipped now but sink ships later

I know a thing or two about a 
Sweet little sister
Her mom would kill her if she knew what she do, she's my
Sweet little sister
She'll love you black and blue
Sweet little sister
She's Mona Lisa with a new tattoo
She's my sweet little
Sweet little sister
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
