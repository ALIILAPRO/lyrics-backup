		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Up late, all night
I don't even need a reason why
Your love is so right
I can't wait until the mornin' light
To get back, when I'm through
And bring my lovin' on home to you

Hey, honey don't you understand?
I been workin' all day, doin' the best I can
Got that easy lovin' if you'd take my hand
I'm a hard-workin' man
I'm a hard-workin' man, yes, I am

Just wait, payday
I'm gon' take you somewhere far away
Us two, sky blue
But first, I got to make a run or two
Bossman, he's on the line
Said he's gonna give me overtime, yes he is, girl

Hey, baby, don't you understand?
I been workin' all day, doin' the best I can
Got that easy lovin' if you'd take my hand
I'm a hard-workin' man
I'm a hard-workin' man, bet your life I am

Hey, honey don't you understand?
I been workin' all day, doin' the best I can
Got that easy lovin' if you'd take my hand
I'm a hard-workin' man
I'm a hard-workin' man, yes, I am
Hey, honey don't you understand?
I been workin' all day, doin' the best I can
Got that easy lovin' if you'd take my hand
I'm a hard-workin' man
I'm a hard-workin' man, yes, I am

Hard-workin' man, baby
A hard-workin' man
Ooh-oh, bet your life I am, baby, ooh
I'm a hard-workin', darlin', ooh
