		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Another little abuse, another pointless excuse
Another joke that's not to laugh at
Another day, feeling like I don't belong
I really don't belong

So, I end another day, feeling totally betrayed
Say hello to anger, did you miss me?
I know it so well, like a long time friend
Who smiles while poisoning me

And I don't know, if they still love me
And I don't know, if they still care
But all I really know is I am sorry
I let you let me grow, so unprepared

I'm pulling at the root to tear you off me
To see if I'll have something left
And even if it means, I'm starting over
And everything I made with you means nothing

Well, that doesn't matter
I'm alone and I'm free
'Cause there's nothing really wrong with me
And I know it doesn't matter
No matter what they tell me
Done living for someone else's time
On someone else's dime
So I'm drawing my line in the sand
'Cause I know it doesn't matter

Another thing to remake, another patient mistake
Another self humiliation
A better day, happy that I won't belong
Does anyone belong?

So, I end a lonely day feeling totally okay
Wave goodbye to anger, will you miss me?
I knew it so well, like a long time friend
We'll never be friends again

I don't really know if they still love me
And I don't know if they still care
But all I really know is I'm not sorry
'Cause I am on my own with no one there

So make me feel alone when they are with me
It sounds insane, but au contraire
I'm cutting off the parts, that kill the body
Because they never played me fair and square

And I feel fucking awesome
I'm alone, and I'm free
'Cause there's nothing really wrong with me
And I know it doesn't matter
No matter what they tell me
Done living for someone else's time
On someone else's dime
So, I'm drawing my line in the sand
'Cause I know it doesn't matter

I don't really think about your love now
And I don't think that I still care
I know without a doubt, if you could see me
I would ruin your week, your month, your year

'Cause you don't have a victim you can poison
So now the poison's all you have
I'm living a new life and don't regret it
And you just have the memory
Bet you'll never forget it

Because now I'm alone and I'm free
'Cause there's nothing really wrong with me
And I know it doesn't matter
No matter what they tell me
Done living for someone else's time
On someone else's dime
So I'm drawing my line in the sand
'Cause I know it doesn't matter
(Do they even know what love is?)
Yeah, I know it doesn't matter
(Are they growing tired of this?)
Yeah, I know it doesn't matter
(On my own I'll float above this)

And I don't really know
