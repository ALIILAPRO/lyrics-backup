		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  went out to a protest on the strand
a young girl held a sign above her head that read
you will die of old age 
and  we will die of climate change
her parents stayed at home and washed their hands
they said 

oh that silly jane, she's tryna save the world again
oh that silly jane, she's tryna changes our minds again

when all is said and done
more is said than done

freedom ain't a choice with which your born
to love and to be loved is to be scorned
I wanna see the world some day
before it all starts to decay 
does that just make me part of the problem 

I don't need a battleship
to get my point across

when all is said and done
more is said than done

(we're at the point of devolution
midst a personal demolition
we're at the point of devolution) 

but then she showed me love
but then she showed me hate
but then she showed me hope
yeah things turned out just great

I don't need a battleship
to get my point across

oh that silly jane, she's tryna save the world again
oh that silly jane, she's tryna changes our minds again
