		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I look around me, nothing is the same
I make a puzzle of what still remains
It's I like I don't remember who I am
So I keep untangling tangles while I'm getting older
My feet are on the ground and the world feels colder
And oh I wonder if I'll see you again

But when you're crushed by the patterns that come and go
And bleed into the centerfold
Remember the only thing that matters

I can feel you here, feel you there, feel you right, baby
I can feel your waist 'cross the space and the time
It hits me like a flood, like a stun, like a light, like a meteorite (meteorite)
I can feel you here, feel you there, feel you right, baby
I can feel your waist 'cross the space and the time
It hits me like a flood, like a stun, like a light, like a meteorite (meteorite)

Our length is dawn into the dusk
You spend it only if you must
Though we never seem to have enough, we tried
You live with all the skeletons
I know I'm not the only one
I'd hate for them to have to come alive

But when you're crushed by the patterns that come and go
And bleed into the centerfold
Remember the only thing that matters

I can feel you here, feel you there, feel you right, baby
I can feel your waist 'cross the space and the time
It hits me like a flood, like a stun, like a light, like a meteorite (meteorite)
I can feel you here, feel you there, feel you right, baby
I can feel your waist 'cross the space and the time
It hits me like a flood, like a stun, like a light, like a meteorite (meteorite)
