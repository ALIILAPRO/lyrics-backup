		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We hear stories growing up
About the man that saved the day
We see movies bout the two
Who found their love that got away
But no one ever wants to teach
The harsh realities that made lose myself
I guess oh well
I had to lose me first to find myself
I had to get so sick to care about health
I had to lose some friends cause no one's helping me
If this here's life
Why's no one telling me?
It's the same reasons I sing on beat
They just
Too busy to care bout me
I mean
At this point
Who can I believe
If it came from me?
I do better when I'm laying in my bedroom
Anxiety through the roof and that's true
But I'm praying that I'm getting out of hell soon
I'm colorblind to the toe
Still I don't know what's a life without blue
Therapist on my phone preaching how can I lose?
Got a fucked up head this ain't the life that I choose
But i'm holding on for now
We hear stories growing up
About the man that saved the day
We see movies bout the two
Who found their love that got away
But no one ever wants to teach
The harsh realities that made lose myself
I guess oh well
I had to lose me first to find myself
I had to get so sick to care about health
I had to lose some friends cause no one's helping me
If this here's life
Why's no one telling me?
It's the same reasons I sing on beat
They just
Too busy to care bout me
I mean
At this point
Who can I believe
If it came from me?
I do better when I'm laying in my bedroom
Anxiety through the roof and that's true
But I'm praying that I'm getting out of hell soon
I'm colorblind to the toe
Still I don't know what's a life without blue
Therapist on my phone preaching how can I lose?
Got a fucked up head this ain't the life that I choose
But i'm holding on for now
