		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's no difference between you and I
We share the same sunshine from the same sky
When it rains, it rains on both you and I

Gotta sink or swim, now it's do or die
It goes "hashtag, bodybag"
Toe tag
Shot in the chest
"Hashtag bodybag"
Even when I'm on my last breath

'Til we get reciprocity
How can we stand by?
Yesterday, I turned on the TV
I saw another man down
He was screaming
He can't breathe no more
He held his hands high
But then he got struck down
Oh, he got struck down

I saw the body drop
On the six o'clock
I saw the body drop
On the six o'clock
Struck down, struck down

There's no difference between you and I
Same space and time that we occupy
We all just looking for a piece of the pie
We went blind, going eye for an eye

It goes "Hashtag bodybag"
Toe tag
Shot in the chest
"Hashtag bodybag"
Even when I'm on my last breath

'Til we get reciprocity
How can we stand by?
Yesterday, I turned on the TV
I saw another man down
He was screaming
He can't breathe no more
He held his hands high
But then he got struck down
Oh, he got struck down

I saw the body drop
On the six o'clock
I saw the body drop
On the six o'clock
Struck down, struck down

I won't give no fucks
I won't take no shit
Try to burn me down
Get this whole place lit
I won't give no fucks
I won't take no shit
They said they want war, this is it

Let the body drop!

Then let the body drop!
Then let the body drop!
Then let the body, drop!
