		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I cannot feel the things that you said
And I cannot heal from the ways that I bled
And I cannot find a reason to try
But I cannot bear to say goodbye
And I cannot stop myself from falling
And I cannot heal from what was something
But I can't stop crying from
The things that you say
But I try my hardest and it won't go away
And everything's turning in a wave I fell
But I am still lost, stuck in my shell
And my body's starving, I can't stop myself
So I search for someone
But there's nobody else
I can't stop hurting from the
Pain that I bled
And I keep replaying the things that you said
But I cannot find a light in this dark
So how can I heal a hole in my heart?
I cannot feel the things that you said
And I cannot heal from the ways that I bled
And I cannot find a reason to try
But I cannot bear to say goodbye
And I cannot stop myself from falling
But I cannot heal from what was something
And I can't stop crying from
Things that you say
But I try my hardest and it won't go away
And everything's turning in a wave I fell
But I am still lost, stuck in my shell
And my body's starving, I can't stop myself
So I search for someone
But there's nobody else
I can't stop hurting from the
Pain that I bled
And I keep replaying the things that you said
But I cannot find a light in this dark
So how can I heal a hole in my heart?
