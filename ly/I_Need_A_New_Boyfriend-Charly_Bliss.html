		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We're at a party
And he won't even talk to anybody
He's just sitting alone, don't get me started
It took me three hours just to get him out of the house
And now he's bumming me out again

Everyone said that I should get out
I built him up and he let me down
Now that I think about it

I need a new boyfriend
I need a new boyfriend
Cause when I cry he doesn't understand
Plays my emotions like a baby grand
I need a new boyfriend
I need a new boyfriend
Cause he never even liked my band
Every compliment was so backhanded
The more that I think about it
I need a new boyfriend

I knew he loved me
At least he tried really hard
And so I'm sorry
But it wasn't enough to keep it running
It took me three years but I finally figured it out
I think I'm just too fun for him

Everyone said I'm better without
I built him up and he let me down
Now that I think about it

I need a new boyfriend
I need a new boyfriend
Cause when I cry he doesn't understand
Plays my emotions like a baby grand
I need a new boyfriend
I need a new boyfriend
Cause he never even liked my band
Every compliment was so backhanded
The more that I think about it
I need a new boyfriend

I need a new boyfriend
I need a new boyfriend
Cause he never even liked my band
Every compliment was so backhanded

I need a new boyfriend
I need a new boyfriend
Cause when I cry he doesn't understand
Plays my emotions like a baby grand
I need a new boyfriend
I need a new boyfriend
Cause even though we had a five-year plan
I couldn't stay with him another second

The more that I think about it
I need a new boyfriend
