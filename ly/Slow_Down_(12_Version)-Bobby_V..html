		  Tim and Bob
Bobby Valentino
You know how we do
It's another one

I saw you walking
Down on Melrose
You looked like an angel
Straight out of Heaven, girl
I was blown away by
Your sexiness
All I have to do is 
Catch up to you

Slow down 
I just wanna get to know you
But don't turn around
'Cause that pretty round thing looks good to me
Slow down 
Never seen anything so lovely
Now turn around
And bless me with your beauty, cutie

A butterfly tattoo
Right above your navel
Your belly button's pierced too 
Just like I like it girl
Come take a walk with me
You'll be impressed by
The game that I kick to you
It's so third row and real

Like a flower fully bloomed in the summertime
You're ready
To be watered by this conversation
You're ready
I'm in awe 'cause you shine like the sun
Let me be the one to enjoy you (enjoy you)
Let's kick it girl

So slow down 
I just wanna get to know you
But don't turn around
'Cause that pretty round thing looks good to me
Slow down 
Never seen anything so lovely
Now turn around
And bless me with your beauty, cutie

Slow down 
I just wanna get to know you
But don't turn around
'Cause that pretty round thing looks good to me (slow, yeah)
Slow down 
Never seen anything so lovely
Now turn around
And bless me with your beauty, cutie

Oh baby 
You know by now that I want you bad
I'm floating on thin air 
I can't come down
Cupid hit me already damn
Now I can't leave 
'Til seven digits are in my hand
My hand, yeah yeah

Like a flower fully bloomed in the summertime
You're ready
To be watered by this conversation
You're ready
I'm in awe 'cause you shine like the sun
Let me be the one to enjoy you (enjoy you)
Let's kick it girl

Slow down 
I just wanna get to know you
But don't turn around
'Cause that pretty round thing looks good to me
Slow down 
Never seen anything so lovely
Now turn around
And bless me with your beauty, cutie

Slow down 
I just wanna get to know you
But don't turn around
'Cause that pretty round thing looks good to me
Slow down 
Never seen anything so lovely
Now turn around
And bless me with your beauty, cutie

(Oh look so good, look so good, yeah)
Slow down never seen anything so lovely
Cutie

Slow down 
I just wanna get to know you
But don't turn around
'Cause that pretty round thing looks good to me
Slow down 
Never seen anything so lovely
Now turn around
And bless me with your beauty, cutie
