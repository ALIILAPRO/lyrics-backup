		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everybody tries to make me dance
But I just want to sit still
cnd stare right at you with my strongest gaze
It's an innocent youthful thrill
cnd hold your hand on my front porch swing
When the summer night sends a chill
cnd dream of driving way up north
Though I know we'll never get our fill
cnd everybody tries to fall in love
But I just keep making friends
When I sort through those stars at night
I'm looking for some kind of sign of the end
If the sun won't rise when the morning comes
I'll be ready 'cause I don't depend
On those things like philosophy
cnd the sunrise, moon tides, pursuit of happiness
I find that I wish I was home
I find that I wish I was home
Singing songs that you already know
Instead of always singing my own
cnd arranging the tones
In this city that reminds me I'm alone
I find that I wish I was yours
I find that I wish I was yours
cnd belonged to all the birds nesting on the porch
cnd all those trees along the river gorge
cnd every windswept metaphor
cll of yours until I am nothing more
