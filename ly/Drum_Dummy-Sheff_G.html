		  Look
What they done for me?
Free my homies, fuck them courts, they still will ball for me 
See them talkin' on the net, but then they run (run from me)
Call up cuzzo with that, huh
Call 'em drum dummy (drum dummy)
Bitch, I don't need no feeling, need no lovin', they could take it
Why you got a gun, bro, don't you know the folks be hatin'?
I don't feel no pressure when I'm in this shit
No, I don't feel no pressure when I'm in this shit

Look, fuck it, huh
What they done for me, huh?
Free my homies, fuck them courts, they still will ball for me (ball for me)
See them talkin' on the net, but then they run from me (run from me)
Call up cuzzo with that, huh
Call 'em drum dummy, huh (drum dummy)
Bitch, I don't need no feeling, need no lovin', they could take it
Why you got a gun, bro, don't you know the folks be hatin'?
I don't feel no pressure when I'm in this shit
No, I don't feel no pressure when I'm in this shit

Look, go ask 'em, huh
What they done for me, huh?
Bitch, you used to front a lot, she wanna love on me
Ayy, look
Now she wanna rub on me, huh
Hold my gun for me, thinkin' she the one for me, huh
Look, I'm up, they wanna see me back down, huh
Yeah, they left me, the same ones, they turnin' back now, huh
Love to see my family happy, shit we blessed now, huh
Yeah, we blessed now, remember when we stressed out, nigga
100K just for this necklace, this bitch two-toned, nigga
She just pull up, get to neckin', say we too grown for this
Took some losses, I'm still winnin', I'ma keep on winnin', huh
There was nobody lookin' out for me, huh
Fuck the opposition, heard they out for me, huh
I have all my hitters going out for me, huh
Look, huh, switchin' routes for me, huh
Look, huh, runnin' out for me, huh

What they done for me?
Free my homies, fuck them courts, they still will ball for me (ball for me)
See them talkin' on the net, but then they run from me (run from me)
Call up cuzzo with that, huh
Call 'em drum dummy, huh (drum dummy)
Bitch, I don't need no feeling, need no lovin', they could take it
Why you got a gun, bro, don't you know the folks be hatin'?
I don't feel no pressure when I'm in this shit
No, I don't feel no pressure when I'm in this shit

(Great John on the beat, by the way)
