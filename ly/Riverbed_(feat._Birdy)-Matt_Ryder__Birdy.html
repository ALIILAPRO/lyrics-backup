		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They found us
Standing on the riverbed
And we wasted all our chances
Look at what we're up against
Oh

I broke my own heart
I've never felt so far from love
But still, we hold fast
Nothing grows in the dark
It always fell apart for us
As we go under
Hearts intertwined with each other

Nothing ever hit hard enough
It was always our weakness
The last time I dreamt of us
Was like a premonition

They found us
Standing on the riverbed
And we wasted all our chances
Look at what we're up against
Oh
They found us
Reaching for a broken breath
I've seen the way it's gonna end
We're standing on the riverbed

Standing on the riverbed

I'm on the dark side of the truth
'Cause no one's ever gonna tell you, oh-oh
But I mirror how you move
And when you lose I lose

Nothing ever hit hard enough
It was always our weakness
The last time I dreamt of us
Was like a premonition

They found us
Standing on the riverbed
And we wasted all our chances
Look at what we're up against
Oh
They found us
Reaching for a broken breath
I've seen the way it's gonna end
We're standing on the riverbed

They found us
Standing on the riverbed
And we wasted all our chances
Look at what we're up against
Oh
They found us
Reaching for a broken breath
I've seen the way it's gonna end
We're standing on the riverbed
