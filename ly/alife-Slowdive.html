		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Two lives are hard lives with you, oh
Two lives are hard lives with you, oh
Two lives are hard lives with you, oh

Hey, just look at us now
Time made fools of us all
Look but we don't understand
We try but we don't look around

Looking down
Looking around

Two lives are hard lives with you
Two lives are hard lives with you

Down where the river runs through
The town, there's a memory of you
Don't look, don't look at me now
Time has got me somehow
It's you and only you
You and only you

Two lives are hard lives with you, oh
Two lives are hard lives with you, oh
Two lives are hard lives with you, oh
Two lives are hard lives with you, oh

Down where the river runs through
The town, there's a memory of you
Don't look, don't look at me now
Time has got me somehow

Two lives are hard lives with you, oh
Two lives are hard lives with you
