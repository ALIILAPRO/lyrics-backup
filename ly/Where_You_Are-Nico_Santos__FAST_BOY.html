		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You know that I can't stop 'til I get to where you are
Get to where you are, gotta get to where you are

We're swimmin' in the smoke, baby, we've been on our own
When the night's gettin' cold, I find you
The city is amazin', I'm drippin' in my face
There's one thing I would say right to you

Ah-aha-ah-ah
I've been chasin' the feeling
Ah-aha-ah-ah
Just something to believe in

You know that I can't stop 'til I get to where you are
Get to where you are, wanna fall into your arms
Know it's way too late to be so far apart
Shortcut to your heart, can I get to where you are?

You know that I can't stop 'til I get to where you are
Get to where you are, wanna fall into your arms
Know it's way too late to be so far apart
Shortcut to your heart, can I get to where you are?

Get to where you are
Know I gotta get to where you are
Know I wanna fall into your arms
Know I gotta get to where you are, gotta get to where you are

In the jungle of concrete, I've been runnin' through the streets
And I hope they would guide me to ya
Need a taste of somethin' different, countin' on my tunnel visions
On the second way, the view is just too high

Ah-aha-ah-ah
I've been chasin' the feelin'
Ah-aha-ah-ah
Just somethin' to believe in

You know that I can't stop 'til I get to where you are
Get to where you are 'til I fall into your arms
Know it's way too late to be so far apart
Shortcut to your heart, can I get to where you are?

You know that I can't stop 'til I get to where you are
Get to where you are, wanna fall into your arms
Know it's way too late to be so far apart
Shortcut to your heart, can I get to where you are?

Get to where you are
Know I gotta get to where you are
Know I wanna fall into your arms
Know I gotta get to where you are, gotta get to where you are
