		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was scared of dentists and the dark
I was scared of pretty girls and starting conversations
Oh, all my friends are turning green
You're the magician's assistant in their dream

Ooh, ooh-ooh, and they come unstuck

Lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you, when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat 'cause
You're gonna sing the words wrong

I love you
To the Riptide
And they come unstuck

There's this movie that I think you'll like
This guy decides to quit his job and heads to New York City
This cowboy's running from himself
And she's been living on the highest shelf

Ooh, ooh-ooh, and they come unstuck

Lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat 'cause
You're gonna sing the words wrong

To the Riptide
I love you
To the Riptide
And they come unstuck

Lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat 'cause
You're gonna sing the words wrong

Ooh, ooh-ooh, ha ah ah, and they come unstuck
