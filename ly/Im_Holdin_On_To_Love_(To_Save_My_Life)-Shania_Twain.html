		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't need a shrink to tell me what to think
There ain't no missing link in my love life
It's alright, I ain't that uptight
No, I don't need a psychic 'cause I don't really like it
When someone tries to tell me just what my future holds
I already know

Your love keeps me alive
You're all I need to survive
I got you by my side

So I'm holdin' on
I'm feelin' strong, baby you're the one
For all my life
Yeah, I'm holdin' out, there ain't no doubt
I can't live without you all my life!
I'm holdin' on to love to save my life

Oh, I don't need to get all caught up on the net
'Cause I'm already set
Can't you understand? Already got my man
No, I don't need proof to show me the truth
Not even Dr. Ruth
Is gonna tell me how I feel, I know our love is real

Well, your love keeps me alive
You're all I need to survive
I got you by my side

So I'm holdin' on
I'm feelin' strong, baby you're the one
For all my life
Yeah, I'm holdin' out, there ain't no doubt
I can't live without you all my life
I'm holdin' on to love to save my life
Oh, save me, kiss me

I'm holdin' on to love to save my life
Oh, I'm holding, oh yeah, oh

Well, your love keeps me alive
You're all I need to survive
I got you by my side

So I'm holdin' on
I'm feelin' strong, baby you're the one
For all my life
Yeah I'm holdin' out, there ain't no doubt
I can't live without you all my life!
I'm holdin' on to love
I'm holdin' on to love to save my life
Save me, save me, save me
Save my life
