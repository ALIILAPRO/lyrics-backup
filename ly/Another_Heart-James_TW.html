		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We met when I was only Just 17
And everything we did was so new to me
Oh It’s was you my love 

Took me to places that I’d never been
Showed me the brightest future I’d ever seen
Oh It was you my love
But it wasn’t true my love

Nothing ever goes the way you plan it
It takes a little time for you to understand it
Over time I’ve learnt whatever happens
Is gonna happen either way

But I wasn’t ready for goodbye
I would’ve stayed right by your side
But you can’t say the same
Cause you’re the one that walked away

Oh I tell myself that I’ll be fine
Then wipe the tear drops from my eyes
I’ll pick up the parts
While you go and break another heart

I gave you everything &
You wanted more
You pick me up to drop me
When you were bored
That was cruel my love

Im not the first you’ve broken
I should’ve know
If you don’t want me then
I'm better alone
That’s the truth my love
Yeah that’s the truth my love 

But I wasn’t ready for goodbye
I would’ve stayed right by your side
But you can’t say the same
Cause you’re the one that walked away

I tell myself that I'll be fine
Then wipe the teardrops from my eyes
I'll pick up the parts
While you go and break Another Heart

Cause nothing ever goes the you plan it
Even though it hurts one day you’ll understand it
I’m stronger now because of all that’s happened
I would’ve have it
Any other way

But I wasn’t ready for goodbye
I would’ve stayed right by your side
But you can’t say the same
Cause you’re the one that walked away

I tell myself that I'll be fine
Then wipe the teardrops from my eyes
I'll pick up the parts
While you go and break Another Heart
