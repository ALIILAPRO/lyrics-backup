		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  With one light on in one room
I know you're up when I get home
With one small step upon the stair
I know your look when I get there

If you were a king up there on your throne
Would you be wise enough to let me go
For this queen you think you own
Wants to be a hunter again

Wants to see the world alone again
To take a chance on life again
So let me go

The unread book and painful look
The T.V's on, the sound is down
One long pause
Then you begin

Oh look what the cat's brought in
If you were a king up there on your throne
Would you be wise enough to let me go
For this queen you think you own

Wants to be a hunter again
Wants to see the world alone again
To take a chance on life again
So let me go
Let me leave

For the crown you've placed upon my head feels too heavy now
And I don't know what to say to you but I'll smile anyhow
And all the time I'm thinking, thinking

I want to be a hunter again
I want to see the world alone again
To take a chance on life again
So let me go
(Repeat)

Let me leave 
Let me go.
