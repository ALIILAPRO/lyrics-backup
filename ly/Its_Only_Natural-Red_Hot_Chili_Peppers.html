		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She was a London girl, knew enough now to get herself alright
He was a Southend boy, not enough smile, but he sure could fight
She was a daddy's girl, pride of all Brixton with dragon sight
But she can't go home tonight

It's only natural
And lovers will show you how to break it down
In spite of attraction, well
It's only natural
And people will show you how to break it down
In spite of your love, steady up

They were a perfect pair, a clash of two beauties and the rash of vein
Nobody knows just when lightning will strike but it always came

And she can't go home tonight
No, she can't go home tonight

It's only natural
And lovers will show you how to break it down
In spite of attraction, well
It's only natural
And people will show you how to take it down
In spite of your love, steady up

But she can't go home tonight

It's only natural
And lovers will show you how to break it down
In spite of attraction, well
It's only natural
And people will show you how to break it down
In spite of the love
It's only natural
And lovers will show you how to break it down
The perfect subtraction, well
It's only natural
And people will show you how to take it down
In spite of the love, steady up
