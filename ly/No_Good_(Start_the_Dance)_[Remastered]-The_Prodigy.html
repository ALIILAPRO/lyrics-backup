		  Come on, who can, who can, can hear the bass drum? 
Come on, who can, who can, can hear the bass drum? 

Come on, who can, who can, can hear the bass drum? 
Come on, who can, who can, can hear the bass drum? 

You're no good for me, I don't need nobody 
Don't need no one, that's no good for me
