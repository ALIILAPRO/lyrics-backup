		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tremble you weaklings, cower in fear 
I am your ruler, land, sea and air 
Immense in my girth, erect, I stand tall 
I am a nuclear murderer, I am Polaris 
Ready to pounce at the touch of a button 
My systems locked in on military gluttons 
I rule on land, air, and sea 
Pass judgment on humanity 
Winds blow from the bowels of hell 
Will we get warning? Only time will tell 
Satan rears his ugly head to spit into the wind 
I spread disease like a dog 
Discharge my payload a mile high 
Rotten egg air of death wrestles your nostrils 
Launch the Polaris, the end doesn't scare us 
When will this cease? 
The warheads will all rust in peace! 
Bomb shelters filled to the brim 
Survival such a silly whim 
World leaders sell missiles cheap 
Your stomach turns, your flesh creeps 
High priest of holocaust, fire from the sea 
Nuclear winter spreading disease 
The day of final conflict all will pay the price 
The third world war rapes peace, takes life 
Back to the start, talk of the part 
When the earth was cold as ice 
Total dismay as the sun passed away 
And the days were black as night 
Eradication of Earth's population loves Polaris
