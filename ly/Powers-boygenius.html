		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How did it start? Did I fall in to a nuclear reactor?
Crawl out with acid skin or something worse
A hostile alien ambassador

Or am I simply another of the universe's failed experiments?
Either way, I have been wondering just how it is (how it is)
I have never heard (never heard)
The tale of how I got my powers

Thrust into being, careenin' along
On a crooked little trajectory
Dissolving in movement, a body in orbit
Or a roach on his way to the gutter

The tail of a comet burned up in an instant
The destruction of matter
It's no object to be seen in the Supercollider
Just a light in the tunnel or whatever gets scattered
Light flashing before the eye of whatever comes after
The force of our impact, the fission
The hum of our contact, the sound of our collisions
