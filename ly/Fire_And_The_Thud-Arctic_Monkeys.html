		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You showed me my tomorrow
Beside a box of matches
A welcome threatening stir
My hopes of being stolen
Might just ring true
Depends who you prefer
But if it's true you're gonna run away
Tell me where, I'll meet you there

Am I snapping the excitement?
If I pack away the laughter
And tell you how it feels
And does burden come to meet ya?
If I've questions of the feature
That runs on your dream reel?

The day after you stole my heart
Everything I touched told me
It would be better shared with you, with you 
And now you're hiding in my soup
And this book reveals your face
And there's a splashing in my eyelids
As the concentration continually breaks

I did request the mark you cast
Didn't heal as fast
I hear your voice in silences
Will the teasing of the fire be followed by the thud?

In the jostling crowd
You're not allowed to tell the truth
And the photo booth's a liar (liar)
And there's a sharpened explanation
But there's no screaming reason to inquire
I'd like to poke them in their prying eyes
With things they never see if it smacked them in their temples
