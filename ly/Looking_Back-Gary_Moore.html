		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was looking back to see
If she was looking back to see
If I was looking back at her.

I saw her walking down the street,
Though little does she look so sweet.
I followed her for half a mile,
I had to stop and talk a while.

I was looking back to see
If she was looking back to see
If I was looking back at her.

She had a yellow golden hair,
I'm gonna follow everywhere.
She had a wiggle when she walk,
I wanted her to stop and talk.

You know that I was looking back to see
If she was looking back to see
If I was looking back at her.
Yeah!

She had a yellow golden hair,
I'm gonna follow everywhere.
She had a wiggle when she walk, yeah,
I wanted her to stop and talk.

You know that I was looking back to see
If she was looking back to see
If I was looking back at her.

You know that I was looking back to see
If she was looking back to see
If I was looking back at her.

You know that I was looking back to see
If she was looking back to see
If I was looking back at her.
