		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I picked you out of in a crowd
Of a thousand faces
Yeah, I found you, ooh, ooh, ooh
I chose the whys and the whens
All around and places
Yeah, I chose you, ooh, ooh, ooh

I let you see me
Let you believe it was your move
So smooth, my rules

Well, you think you are the one
Who got me, boy
No, I got you
I've been playing with you
Like a little toy
Yeah, I got you
I got you
I got you

You'd be surprised all the
Times that I almost told you
But I stayed cool, oh
I almost broke, but
I knew I would get to hold you
Cause I'm no fool, oh

You came back to me
And did the very thing I knew
That you'd do, oh ooh oh

Well, you think you are the one
Who got me, boy
No, I got you
I've been playing with you
Like a little toy
Yeah, I got you
I got you
I got you

You gave me all control
(I got you)
I took your heart and soul
(I got you)
For me, I'm gonna roll
I got you, you, you, ooh

(I got you, oh yeah)
(I got you, and I love it)
(I got you)
(Yeah, I got you)
(I got you, and I love it)
(I got you)
(Yeah, I got you)

Well, you think you are the one
Who got me, boy
No, I got you
I've been playing with you
Like a little toy
Yeah, I got you
I got you
I got you

(I got you, and I love it)
(I got you)
(Yeah, I got you)
(I got you, and I love it)
(I got you)
(Yeah, I got you)
