		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's no need to fear, Underdog is here.

When criminals in this world appear,
And break the laws that they should fear,
And frighten all who see or hear,
The cry goes up both far and near for

Under, Under, dog
Under, Under, dog

That's the superhero bluff
Crooks and bandits give it up
There's no reason to be so mean
When these dogs have overseen

Send for rescue, here it comes
This canine is number one

Speed of lightning, roar of thunder,
Fighting all who rob or plunder
Underdog, Underdog.

When in this world the headlines read
Of those who's hearts are filled with greed
And rob and steal from those in need.
To right this wrong with blinding speed goes

Under, Under, dog
Under, Under, dog

Coming at you right on time
Saving lives and stopping crime
Don't you worry, he'll be there
So you bad guys you beware
To do wrong when he's around
Guess who's coming to your town

Come on baby it's no wonder

Speed of lightning, roar of thunder,
Fighting all who rob or plunder
Underdog, Underdog
