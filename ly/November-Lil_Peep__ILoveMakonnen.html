		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now that months have passed 
I don't think about our past
I know it wouldn't last 
So I'm not mad about what we had
I know you're feeling sad
Still crying every night
I know seasons change 
And you're not feeling right (yeah)

You held me close, I remember (yeah)
I left you cold in December (yeah)
You watched me break and don't say a thing
You can't hear a thing so I'll scream out
I'm all alone in November
She's never here when I need her
I try a lot, and I cry a lot
And I'm trying hard not to bleed out

You don't wanna share your love but 
I keep making moves for us and
You don't wanna gain my trust so
You could get it lost in lust and
I just wanna fall in love but 
I don't wanna fall with some 'cause 
They be down in the dust and 
Only got time for jokes, yeah

You held me close, I remember
I left you cold in December
You watched me break and don't say a thing
You can't hear a thing so I'll scream out
I'm all alone in November
She's never here when I need her
I try a lot, and I cry a lot
And I'm trying hard not to bleed out

(I'm trying hard not to bleed out)
(Never close)
(When I need ya)
(When I need ya)
(When I need ya)
