		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Somewhere in between here and heaven
Somewhere in between where and why
Somewhere in another dimension
I can hear you asking me why

Why?
Why?

Tell me, can you hear me? I'm calling
Tell me you can hear me, don't cry
Tell me that you're not feeling lonely
Somewhere in between where and why

I will wait for you
Will you wait for me?
I will wait for you
Will you wait for me?

Tell me
Tell me
Tell me
Tell me

Somewhere at the crossroads of nowhere
Somewhere at the crossroads of why
Somewhere in another dimension
I can hear you asking me why

Why?
Why?

Will you wait for me?
I will wait for you
Will you wait for me?
I will wait for you

Tell me
Tell me
Tell me
Tell me

Somewhere in between here and Heaven
Somewhere in between where and why
Somewhere in another dimension
I can hear you asking me why

Ooh, ah
Ooh, ah
Ooh, ah
Ooh, ah
