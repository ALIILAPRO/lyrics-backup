		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There you are alone
With no hope of ever having
Something to be proud of
Something earned without begging
Yes, I know you're a person
A person close to me
Who do think you are, and what more do you want from me?

(Ball tongue) you got the dykes off, I think they'll mind me
(Ball tongue) I'm a vagabond, we are justified
(Ball tongue) congrats, you just fucked up my make-up and shit
(Ball tongue) what have you done for me?

Why are you at home
Buried in your self-pity?
Why do you insist on living the life clean out of me?
Yes, I know you're the person
The person that took time with me
Does it give you the right to expect your life revolves around me?

(Ball tongue) you have come to take from your buddy
(Ball tongue) you have never been so funky
(Ball tongue) the higgle got sick of me
(Ball tongue) ah, to live to fight another day

(Ball tongue) you're the drug addicted from me
(Ball tongue) unidentified enemy
(Ball tongue) come fucking back to save us and gave up
(Ball tongue) they've come to deliver me

You were my brother (where does our friendship end?)
You were my brother (where does our friendship end?)
You were my brother (where does our friendship end?)
You were my (I'm not gonna give in)

You were my brother (where does our friendship end?)
You were my brother (where does our friendship end?)
You were my brother (where does our friendship end?)
You were my (I'm not gonna give in)

How can you fucking doubt me? But not again (there you are alone)
How can you fucking doubt me? But not again (with no hope of ever having)
How can you fucking doubt me? But not again (something to be proud of)
How can you fucking doubt me? But not again (something earned without begging)

How can you fucking doubt me? But not again (yes, I know you're a person)
How can you fucking doubt me? But not again (a person close to me)
How can you fucking doubt me? But not again (who do think you are?)
How can you fucking doubt me? But not again

(Ball tongue) they've driven right by my friends
(Ball tongue) they've taken the take above me
(Ball tongue) they're a psycho monkey
(Ball tongue) they've come to enslave me

(Ball tongue) they've jacken themselves onto me
(Ball tongue) your fuckin' gangster signs
(Ball tongue) they've come not to save them, but they take
(Ball tongue) fuck'n death to fuck'n me

(Ball tongue) Berome's dead at the technodrome
(Ball tongue) you're right, he's dead, tear gas dropped, but who was it?
(Ball tongue) you tried to put the blame over on to me
(Ball tongue) never die Never die

(Ball tongue) and don't ever come get your boy
(Ball tongue) hauled to the morgue, let him go
(Ball tongue) he wasn't dead, and then they knocked him on the head
(Ball tongue) no more, he's rid of you, you're a dyke
