		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When you come
Will you call my name?
Give me a reason
To wonder why
Give me a reason
To wonder why
When you come
Will you call my name?

Give me a reason
To wonder why
Give me a reason
To wonder why
Did you mean to touch me that way?
Did you mean all the things you said?
Come and tell me
I'm the only one
Come and tell me
I'm the only one

Speak of the devil
And she will appear
Afraid of the runner
It draws herself clear
Oh, the runner
What does she say?

When you come
Will you call my name?
Give me a reason
To wonder why
Give me a reason
To wonder why
When you come
Will you call my name?

Wish I knew how
To walk away
Make it so easy
But then you say
Wish you knew how
It has begun
Wish I knew how
I've come undone
