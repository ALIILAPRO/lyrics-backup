		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Three leagues down the soft side
Of where you left my
Gold rose crown, you broke down
And left me with a
Chest hum, a black gun, and forty dollars
Chest hum, a black gun, and forty dollars

Three weeks down, I drowned myself in whiskey
Came back round, and drowned out
And left me with a
Chest hum, a black gun, and forty dollars
Chest hum, a black gun, and forty dollars

Streetlights talk the same way
My mother told me
I walk the same way my father told me
Back straight, chest out, just like a soldier
Back straight, chest out, just like a soldier
Wise men talk the same way my mother told me
I walk the same way my father told me
Back straight, chest out, just like a soldier
Back straight, chest out, just like a soldier

You go down south, south
You go down south, south
You go down south, south
You go down south, south
You go down south, south
You go down south, south
You go down south, south
You go down south, south
You go down south, south
You go down south, south
You go down south, south
You go down south, south

Streetlights talk the same way
My mother told me (You go down south, south)
I walk the same way my father told me
(You go down south, south)
Back straight, chest out, just like a soldier
(You go down south, south)
Back straight, chest out, just like a soldier
(You go down south, south)
Wise men talk the same way my mother told me
(You go down south, south)
I walk the same way my father told me
(You go down south, south)
Back straight, chest out, just like a soldier
(You go down south, south)
Back straight, chest out, just like a soldier
(You go down south, south)
