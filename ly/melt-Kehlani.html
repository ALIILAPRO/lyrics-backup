		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  But I can't tell where your hair ends and mine begins
If I ain't have all these tattoos, I would think that it's your skin
If I move too quick past you, I would think it's my reflection
Being this close isn't close enough
You can tell every time we touch, every time we, oh

Wish I could build me a cute apartment
One-bedroom right where your heart is
Inch of space feels broken-hearted
Across the bed feels way too far and
I wonder when they see just one, do they see us two?
Ooh, oh-whoa

It's when I melt into you, whoa-oh, oh
I melt into you, whoa-oh, oh
It's when I melt into you, ah-ah
I melt into you, melt into you, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, I
Oh-oh-oh

Matching your breath, follow your chest, up and down
Hopin' you let secrets spill out your mouth, and
Inhale, exhale, breathe me in
With every breath, I'm sinkin' in
No way to describe it, I'm a riot
If I wake up, and I'm somehow beside you
Instead of inside you, that shouldn't surprise you
You don't even notice, no need to remind you

Wish I could build me a cute apartment
One-bedroom right where your heart is
Inch of space feels broken-hearted
Across the bed feels way too far and
I wonder when they see just one, do they see us two?
Oh-oh-oh

It's when I melt into you, whoa-oh, I
I melt into you, whoa-oh, oh
It's when I melt into you, ah-ah-ah
I melt into you, oh, I melt into you, oh, I

Where do you end?
Where do I begin?
Start over again
Feels like we're meltin', meltin'
Where do you end?
Where do I begin?
Start over again
Feels like we're meltin', meltin'
