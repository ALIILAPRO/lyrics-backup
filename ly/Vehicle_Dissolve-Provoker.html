		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Chorus)
It's a new type of technology
Don’t you wanna know what it's like
I just want you to acknowledge me
Maybe with it we can feel alive
And I know its an oddity
Cold corners in receptacles 
Is it better to live honestly
than a future with a little lie
In a place where we don’t ever die

(Verse)
Running out of time
I don’t wanna do it another night
Waking up inside a mind
Pull away the plug evade the plight 
Clean the mind
Clean the mind
Clean the mind

(Bridge)
Feed me to the machine
Into pieces cut up
Don’t awaken my sleep unless I birth in new life 
Feed me to the machine
Into pieces cut up
Don’t awaken my sleep unless I birth in new life 
 
(Chorus)
It's a new type of technology
Don’t you wanna know what it's like
I just want you to acknowledge me
Maybe with it we can feel alive
And I know its an oddity
Cold corners in receptacles 
Is it better to live honestly
than a future with a little lie
In a place where we don’t ever die

(Verse)
Running out of time
I don’t wanna ruin another night
Wasting in limits of mine
Pull away the plug enable sight
clean the mind
clean the mind
clean the mind
