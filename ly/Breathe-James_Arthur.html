		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We're all strangers
Fighting in the streets with no common ground
We're just ragers
Tryna find release when there's none around
Then there's you
You don't feel that much a stranger
You stand out from all the crowds
I don't feel that much in danger
I was lost 'til I found you

Baby, baby, won't you please come rescue me?
I don't really wanna stay if you're not
All I know is that I need you, baby
Hold me close so I can finally breathe

We're all strangers
Fighting gravity, stuck here on the ground
We're just ragers
Tryna keep the peace when there's none around
Then there's you
You're my little ray of sunshine
You are immortality
You make me forget about time
And how it's comin' for me, so

Baby, baby, won't you please come rescue me?
I don't really wanna stay if you're not
All I know is that I need you, baby
Hold me close so I can finally breathe
Finally breathe
Finally breathe
Hold me close so I can finally

When you tell me that you love me, babe
You bring the sun and take away my pain
And the anxiety is miles away
I didn't know that I could feel that way
I didn't know life was so beautiful 'til I held you
Oh yeah

Your eyes make me feel like I'm up floating on air
When you look at me, fuck everything else but you, yeah
I don't wanna be there, so

Baby, baby, won't you please come rescue me?
I don't really wanna stay if you're not
All I know is that I need you, baby
Hold me close so I can finally
Hold me close so I can finally
Hold me close so I can finally breathe
