		<p>
		  I could aim
But I could not fire
Got a bullet to spare
To kill my desire

Who's calling the shots?
One of us must make the peace
To have or to have not
The fire has got to cease

I'm loaded
Don't know where to point this thing
It's a sin
How we hit where it hurts

Who's calling the shots?
One of us (one of us) must end this masquerade
To have or to have not
Let's heal the wounds that we've made

It's a war of the hearts (it's a war of the hearts)
It's a war of the hearts

Got a bullet to spare, don't want to send it your way

Who's calling the shots?
One of us (one of us) must make the peace
To have or to have not
The fire has got to cease

It's a war of the hearts (it's a war of the hearts)
It's a war of the hearts

I'm loaded
Don't know where to point this thing
(It's a sin) it's a sin
How we hit where it hurts (how we hit where it hurts)

One of us (one of us)
Gotta end this masquerade
Gotta heal the wounds that we've made
I've got a bullet to spare
Don't want to send it your way
If you want to end it
If you want to end it, just say

It's a war of the hearts (it's a war of the hearts)
It's a war of the hearts
(gotta end this masquerade)

I've got a bullet to spare
And we don't want to send it your way
If you want to end it (it's a)
If you want to end it (war of the)
Just say (hearts)

It's a war of the hearts
It's a war of the hearts
It's a war of the hearts
