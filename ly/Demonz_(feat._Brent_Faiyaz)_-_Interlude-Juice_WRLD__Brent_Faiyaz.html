		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can't ever do right, can't lose this fight, I'm already low
I think the demons are winning

I can't ever do right, I can't lose this fight, I'm already low
I think I need new beginnings
I think the demons are winning
They beat me up
Don't wish me away, wish me luck, yeah-yeah
I'll be good either way
Who am I to say what good ain't?
I'm finding my way, my way (way)

You can feel it inside you
Don't let it in, it likes you
Don't let it in, feel it inside you
Don't let it in, it likes you
