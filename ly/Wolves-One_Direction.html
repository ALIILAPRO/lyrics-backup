		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I hear them calling for you
I hear them calling for you

I feel the waves getting started
It's a rush inside I can't control
Your eyes keep pulling me in
I know, I know, I know
Your friends all talkin' 'bout me
They say I got no chance at all
Your fire is burning deep
In my soul, my soul, my soul

I ain't up for debating
Ain't in it for the taking
We got the world shaking

In the middle of the night when the wolves come out
They head straight for your heart
Like a bullet in the dark
One by one, I take them down
We can run and hide, ain't goin' down without a fight
I hear them calling for you
I hear them calling for you
In the middle of the night when the wolves come out
They head straight for your heart
They come straight for your heart
I hear them calling for you
I hear them calling for you

I keep on holding tight now
'Cause your body's telling me don't let go
We are gonna be starting up trouble
I know, I know, I know
Just getting my demons out, wouldn't ever doubt
Your beauty could start a war
As you walk in the dining room

I ain't up for debating
Ain't in it for the taking
We got the world shaking

In the middle of the night when the wolves come out
They head straight for your heart
Like a bullet in the dark
One by one, I take them down
We can run and hide, ain't goin' down without a fight
I hear them calling for you
I hear them calling for you
In the middle of the night when the wolves come out
They head straight for your heart
They come straight for your heart
I hear them calling for you
I hear them calling for you

I wish it wasn't true
But the whole world's tryin' to get a piece of you
And my heart keeps fighting in this battle of fools
Gotta make it through, gotta make it through

In the middle of the night when the wolves come out
They head straight for your heart
Like a bullet in the dark
One by one, I take them down
We can run and hide, ain't goin' down without a fight
I hear them calling for you
I hear them calling
In the middle of the night when the wolves come out
They head straight for your heart
They come straight for your heart
I hear them calling for you
I hear them calling for you
