		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When you're near me,
I close my eyes
I want to feel you by my side
When you kiss me
I close my eyes
Want you by my side

Chorus

When I realise
There's no "tell me lies"
Then I know it's Once in A Lifetime
Making love to you
Everything is new
You know you're my Once in A Lifetime

When you touch me,
I burn inside
Cold shiver down my spine
When you take me
.............
I can't get enough

Repeat chorus

Once in a Lifetime 3x

Giving all I've got
And you left me not
You're my lover Once In A Lifetime
Taking care of you
Everytime it's new
You know you're my Once In A Lifetime

Chorus 3x
