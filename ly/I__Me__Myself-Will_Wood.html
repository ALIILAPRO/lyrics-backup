		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been feeling lightheaded
Since I lost enough weight to fit back in my skin
Flower petals and feathers tether me to the ground
Pound for pound
Take my tea with formaldehyde for my
Feminine side since the day that I died
While I whittle my bones until I'm brittle
Am I pretty now
For some reason I find myself
Lost in what you think of me
And too confused to choose who I should be
And now you've got me thinking
I wish I could be a girl, and that way
You'd wish I could be your girlfriend, boyfriend
Am I pretty enough to lie to
I wish I could be a girl, and that way
You'd wish I could be your girlfriend, boyfriend
Just little old me in a big, big world
Little old me in a big world
I wish I were a girl
I've been feeling lighthearted
Since I gained enough weight back to cover my bones
I get dressed up in shadows one leg at a time
We're so alike
But if the shoe fits, then I won't try it on
You'll be walking out early, but the show must go on
No, I know that I'm wrong
But I love how you're on my side when I cross that line
It's been a point of contention between myself and this
Body that they stuck me in
The privilege of being born to be a man
And now you got me thinking
I wish I could be a girl, and that way
You'd wish I could be your girlfriend, boyfriend
Am I pretty enough to lie to
I wish I could be a girl, and that way
You'd wish I could be your girlfriend, boyfriend
Just little old me in a big, big world
Little old me in a big world
I wish
Eating your prosthetic meat/meet your anesthetic criteria
Pathetic seeing you be copacetic/come acetic
Say my name like a slur, but I've been called worse
And I've heard it all before, no this isn't a first
Let me be the void you fill with
Taxidermy fingerprints, taxonomize our differences
I am quantum physics
My witness brings me into existence
I wish I could be a girl, and that way
You'd wish I could be your girlfriend, boyfriend
Am I pretty enough to love back
No not yet
I wish I could be a girl, and really
I'd prefer it if you would use I, Me, Myself
Am I pretty enough, am I pretty enough
To fucking die
Little old me in a big world
Well I would give you my whole world
Little old me in a big world
I wish
All identities are equally invalid
Don't you think that there's a chance that you could live without it
All identities are equally invalid
Don't you think that there's a chance that you could live without it
All identities are equally invalid
Don't you think that there's a chance that you could live without it
All identities are equally invalid
Don't you think that there's a chance that you
