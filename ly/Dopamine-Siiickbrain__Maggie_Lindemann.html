		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I will be your nicotine and
Wrap your heart in dopamine
I know 
morning till the nighttime 
I’ll be there at the right time 
just know, it’s alright 

Ash me out but can’t let go 
Feels just like I just sold my soul 
Burned my skin 
Your hearts a hole 
hate you but I can’t let go
Where the fuck is my control 
Where’s my control
Have I sold my soul? 

I will burn for days and days 
Heart so slow but still it breaks
We’re melting
Into nothing 

I’m sick of it 
I’m sick of it yeah 
Something doesn’t feel right 
I’m sick of it 
I’m sick of it 
But at least I’ll say try yeah 

I’ll be your protector when walking home 
don’t wanna be someone that you don’t know 
oh my baby, what have we done 
I need one more second with you alone 

Ash me out but can’t let go 
Feels just like I just sold my soul 
Burned my skin Your hearts a hole 
hate you but I can’t let go
Where the fuck is my control 
Where’s my control
Have I sold my soul? 

I will burn for days and days 
Heart so slow but still it breaks
We’re melting
Into nothing 

I’m sick of it 
I’m sick of it yeah 
Something doesn’t feel right 
I’m sick of it 
I’m sick of it 
But at least I’ll say try yeah 

Violate 
I’m so afraid 
I dissassociate 
Lost in pain 
Take the blame 
I’m not okay
