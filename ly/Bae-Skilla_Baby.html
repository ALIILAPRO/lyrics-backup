(Djaxx got that star shit on him)
Ha

You know you a bad bitch, classy nails, French tip
These bitches can't sit with you, white toes for the hoes
Chanel bag off the Chanel swag, I swear I'm feelin' you
You ain't just cute, you gettin' money too
I'm finna trick on who?

Bae, you know you fine, don't you?
Bae, you know you fine
Bae, you know you fine, don't you?
Bae, you know you fine
Bae, you know you fine, don't you?
Bae, you know you fine
Bae, you know you fine, don't you?
Bae, you know you fine

Ha, you can go bust down, middle part or side
You can go bob, or you can go blonde
You got your own shit, you don't stay with these niggas
You got your own business, got more pape' then these niggas
They think you mean, you ain't got shit to say to these niggas
You'll play with your pussy 'fore you play with these niggas, ha

You know you a bad bitch, classy nails, French tip
These bitches can't sit with you, white toes for the hoes
Chanel bag off the Chanel swag, I swear I'm feelin' you
You ain't just cute, you gettin' money too
I'm finna trick on who?

Bae, you know you fine, don't you?
Bae, you know you fine
Bae, you know you fine, don't you?
Bae, you know you fine
Bae, you know you fine, don't you?
Bae, you know you fine
Bae, you know you fine, don't you?
Bae, you know you fine

You keep gettin' more Birkins, woo
Don't hurt 'em
You know you be on your shit, you make these niggas so nervous
I ain't go lie you bad bad, you got bitches mad-mad
You was thick before the surgery
Now you got ass-ass

You know you a bad bitch, classy nails, French tip
These bitches can't sit with you, white toes for the hoes
Chanel bag off the Chanel swag, I swear I'm feelin' you
You ain't just cute, you gettin' money too
I'm finna trick on who?

Bae, you know you fine, don't you?
Bae, you know you fine
Bae, you know you fine, don't you?
Bae, you know you fine
Bae, you know you fine, don't you?
Bae, you know you fine
Bae, you know you fine, don't you?
Bae, you know you fine
