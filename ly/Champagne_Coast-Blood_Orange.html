		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Finishing eight or nine?
Tell me, what's the perfect time?
Told you I'll be waiting
Hiding from the rainfall

Come into my bedroom
Come into my bedroom
Come into my bedroom
Come into my bedroom

Tell me, what's the joy of giving if you're never pleased?
On my last strength against all that you believed

Come into my bedroom (young as I want to know)
Come into my bedroom (I'll never let you go)
Come into my bedroom (trading a baseball lover)
Come into my bedroom (as I face the snow)

Young as I want to know
I'll never let you go
Trading a baseball lover 
I face the snow

Come into my bedroom
Come into my bedroom
Come into my bedroom
Come into my bedroom

Finishing eight or nine?
Tell me, what's the perfect time?
I told you I'll be waiting
Hiding from the rainfall
Tell me, what's the joy of giving if you're never pleased?
On my last strength against you
Baby, tell me what you need
Young as I want to know
I will never let you go
Trading a baseball lover as I face the snow
So, tell me, what's the joy of giving if you're never pleased?
On my last strength against you
Baby, tell me what you need

Finishing eight or nine?
Tell me, what's the perfect time?
I told you I'll be waiting
Hiding from the rainfall
Tell me, what's the joy of giving if you're never pleased?
On my last strength against you
Baby, tell me what you need
Young as I want to know
I will never let you go
Trading a baseball lover as I face the snow
So, tell me, what's the joy of giving if you're never pleased?
On my last strength against you
Baby, tell me what you need

Finishing eight or nine?
Tell me, what's the perfect time?
I told you I'll be waiting
Hiding from the rainfall
So, tell me, what's the joy of giving if you're never pleased?
On my last strength against you
Baby, tell me what you need
Young as I want to know
I will never let you go
Trading a baseball lover as I face the snow
So, tell me, what's the joy of giving if you're never pleased?
On my last strength against you
Baby, tell me what you need
