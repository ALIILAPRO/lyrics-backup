		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And when we come for you
We'll be dressed up all in blue
With the ocean in our arms
Kiss your eyes and kiss your palms

And when it's time to pray
We'll get dressed up all in grey
With metals on our tongues
And silver in our lungs

Say my name
And every color illuminates
We are shining
And we will never be afraid again

Say my name

Say my name
As every color illuminates
We are shining
And we will never be afraid again

Say my name
And every color illuminates
And we are shining
And we will never be afraid again

And when we come for you
We'll be dressed up all in blue
With the ocean in our arms
Kiss your eyes and kiss your palms

And when it's time to pray
We'll be dressed up all in grey
With metal on our tongues
And silver in our lungs

Say my name
As every color illuminates
We are shining
And we will never be afraid again

(Say my-) say my name

Same my name
As every color illuminates
We are shining
And we will never be afraid again

Say my name
And every color illuminates
We are shining
And we will never be afraid again
