		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Some nights you lie
Some nights you don't
But they all feel the same
Sometimes you wish you could turn to stone
And be perfect always
I, I can't feel like this no more

In the crowd alone 'cause no one wants to know you
Do they?
Don't they?

Right here but no one's watching

Here comes the invisible man
That no one turns to see
I'm just another dumb fool who'll never go down in history
Yeah, you're standing there with the homecoming king
Turn the silver spoon into a diamond ring
Can he make you disappear without anyone noticing?
Yeah, fuck the homecoming king

You see your life is drawn out
Don't feel the world that you know
Caught in the tower singing
Oh no, that's not the life I chose

Most days you rise and start to fade
'Cause no one loves you
Avert their eyes and look away
Life without virtue
I, I can't feel like this no more

You walk these halls and feel the same
'Cause you can't find your place

Right here but no one's watching

Here comes the invisible man
That no one turns to see
I'm just another dumb fool who'll never go down in history (hey)
Yeah, you're standing there with the homecoming king
Turn the silver spoon into a diamond ring
Can he make you disappear without anyone noticing?
Yeah, fuck the homecoming king

And I stare the fan on the ceiling
All night, all night
All these memories won't stop running
My mind, my mind

And the rats in the walls keeps scratching
My life, my life
And all the voices won't stop laughing
I can't fight again

Here comes the invisible man
That no one turns to see
I'm just another dumb fool who'll never go down in history (hey)
Yeah, you're standing there with the homecoming king
Turn the silver spoon into a diamond ring
Can he make you disappear without anyone noticing?
Yeah, fuck the homecoming king

You see your life is drawn out
Don't feel the world that you know
Caught in the tower singing
Oh no, that's not the life I chose

You see your hands are tied now
Just like your eyes will stay closed
Come in the tower singing
Oh no, that's not the life I chose
