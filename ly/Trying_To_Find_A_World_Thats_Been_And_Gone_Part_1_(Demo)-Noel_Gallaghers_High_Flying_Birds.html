		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If only you and I could try
To turn the page like the winds of change
That come around now and then
The cold against my shoulder
Always seems to be there
D'you think I'll ever learn?

You give me the will to carry on
In a place where I belong
As we try to find a world that's been and gone

You give me the will to carry on
In a place where I belong
As we try to find a world that's been and gone

As we try to find a world that's been and gone
As we try to find a world that's been and gone
As we try to find a world that's been and gone
