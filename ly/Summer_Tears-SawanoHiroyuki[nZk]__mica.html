		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The tears were streaming
down my faceon such a lovely day
The light it danced
and sparkled around the harbor,
boats all sailed away
What a lovely day
for the tears I hide
All the people
walking on the riverside
Oh Ain't it nice.
Sir Will you take our photo,
they have to say
Picture postcards won't help me
I'm broken inside
As the happy children all run by
I can't feel sunny days
Something is taking my heart
far away
If you weren't really the one
I have to fill my emptiness
The sun won't dry
my summer tears

Havana girls are so much fun
but I just can't today
The one I know I really...
Again my heart cries
out in pain for you
What a heavy day /
Don't think I can't play
Paradise became a prison
when you went away
I'm gonna get myself real drunk
and think of time we shared
Picture postcards won't help me
I'm broken inside
As the happy children all run by
I can't feel sunny days
Something is taking
my heart far away
If you weren't really the one
I have to fill my emptiness
The sun won't dry
my summer tears
The road leads to the sea
Then I'm left standing
crying for you
If you weren't really the one
Why do I feel
all hope is now gone?
The sun won't dry
my summer tears
