		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She's fallin' in love now, losin' control now
Fightin' the truth, tryin' to hide
But I think it's alright, girl
Yeah, I think it's alright, girl
She's fallin' in love now, losin' control now
Fightin' the truth, tryin' to hide
But I think it's alright, girl
Yeah, I think it's alright, girl

She's falling but she doesn't think he'll catch her
'Cause her last relationship was a disaster
Accusations everyday, she didn't know why
All her calls would be ignored, he's on his own time
Should've ended it before it started
All she ever got was broken hearted
He was cheating on her, tryna flip it
Back on her like a victim
Now she all alone and starting over
Now she got baggage on her shoulder
But the new guy really loves her
She loves him, but she doesn't trust herself anymore

She's fallin' in love now, losin' control now
Fightin' the truth, tryin' to hide
But I think it's alright, girl
Yeah, I think it's alright, girl, ooh
She's fallin' in love now, losin' control now
Fightin' the truth, tryin' to hide
But I think it's alright, girl
Yeah, I think it's alright, girl, ooh

Despite her past, she can't help the attraction
He tells her that he's nothing like the last one
He redefines in every way what love is
She fell for him and hasn't gotten up since
Every now and then she goes off though
Beatin' on his chest like a bongo
He understands she's coming from a hurt place
Answers all the questions on her survey
Doesn't get jealous, doesn't break trust
Doesn't call a ho after hang-ups
Gives her everything she ever wanted
And even though she still feels haunted

She's fallin' in love now, losin' control now
Fightin' the truth, tryin' to hide
But I think it's alright, girl
Yeah, I think it's alright, girl, ooh
She's fallin' in love now, losin' control now
Fightin' the truth, tryin' to hide
But I think it's alright, girl
Yeah, I think it's alright, girl, ooh
