		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Why would Thy care?
Thou must just be bluffing
Being sad makes me happy
The truth is nothing

The carriage rake
Rattles
As my brain throbs with pain
Garbot he calls
Brain plunders, the shame

This looming temptation
Charisma elates them
When we talk of the times
We talk in the past tense

This looming temptation
Charisma elates them
When we talk of the times
We talk in the past tense

Are these talks just ploys
That caplets won't shake?
Crumble cracked conscience
End my dismay

This looming temptation
Charisma elates them
When we talk of the times
We talk in the past tense

This looming temptation
Charisma elates them
When we talk of the times
We talk in the past tense
