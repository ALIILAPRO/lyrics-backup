		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And I still wonder how it goes
The harmony
The drift of things
The chalk line left in open skies
By silent memory lanes of flights

Mirror the lines traced in my hand
Once a clear read
Now faded land
And that I used to understand
I wonder
Where they end

Maybe one day
I will call your name
Will it sound just like the rain falling?
Will it feel just like the rain?

Well maybe one day
I will read your name
Will it call me like a rain fallin'
Will it shine just like the rain?

And when the day breaks
And gives back the shape to all things
Spreading onto the concrete lands

Its quiet razor-bladed beams
Oh, I remember how your gait beamed
It could be as strong as wind on wings
Blowing in a random blaze
The balance of all things

Maybe one day
I will call your name
Will it sound just like the rainfall
Will it shine just like the rain?

Maybe one day
I will read your name
Will it call me like a rain falling
Will it shine just like the rain?
