		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Echoes through my heart
Echoes through my heart (oh)
Echoes through my heart
Echoes through my heart

Oh, my deepest lonely, why don't we waste another day
Starin' out my window at the mornin' rain?
Oh, my deepest lonely, they never listen anyway
In the witchin' hour, while the city sleeps, we're wide awake

Oh, my deepest lonely
Mm
Oh, oh, my deepest lonely
It's me and you again

When there's dark clouds overhead
When there's dark clouds overhead
It's me and you again

Only you can hold me when I'm slippin' away
Dancin' in the shadows of our sweet escape
Only you can solve me, misunderstood in my ways (Oh)
Underneath you know I keep a fire ablaze

Oh, my deepest lonely
Mm
Oh, oh, my deepest lonely
It's me and you again

When there's dark clouds overhead
When there's dark clouds overhead
It's me and you again

Echoes through my heart
Echoes through my heart (oh)
Echoes through my heart
Echoes through my heart (oh)
Echoes through my heart
Echoes through my heart (oh)
Echoes through my heart
Echoes through my heart (oh)

When there's dark clouds overhead
When there's dark clouds overhead
It's me and you again

Oh, my deepest lonely, why don't we waste another day
Starin' out my window at the mornin' rain?
