		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We keep spendin' most our lives
Livin' in the gangsta's paradise

As I walk through the valley of
The shadow of death
I take a look at my life
And realize there's nothin' left
'Cause I've been blastin' and
Laughin' so long, that
Even my momma thinks that my mind is gone
But I ain't never crossed a
Man that didn't deserve it
Me be treated like a punk
You know that's unheard of
You better watch how you talkin'
And where you walkin'
Or you and your homies might
Be lined in chalk
I really hate to trip, but I gotta loc
As they croak
I see mysеlf in the pistol smoke
Fool, I'm the kinda G thе
Little homies wanna be like
On my knees in the night
Sayin' prayers in the streetlight

They've been spendin' most their lives
Livin' in the gangsta's paradise
They've been spendin' most their lives
Livin' in the gangsta's paradise
We keep spendin' most our lives
Livin' in the gangsta's paradise
We keep spendin' most our lives
Livin' in the gangsta's paradise

Look at the situation they got me facin'
I can't live a normal life
I was raised by the state
So I gotta be down with the hood team
Too much television watchin' got
Me chasin' dreams
I'm a educated fool with money on my mind
Got my ten in my hand, and a gleam in my eye
I'm a loc'd out gangsta, set trippin' banger
And my homies is down
So don't arouse my anger
Fool, death ain't nothin' but
A heartbeat away
I'm livin' life do or die, what can I say?
I'm 23 now, but will I live to see 24?
The way things is goin', I don't know

Tell me, why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me?

They've been spendin' most their lives
Livin' in the gangsta's paradise
They've been spendin' most their lives
Livin' in the gangsta's paradise
We keep spendin' most our lives
Livin' in the gangsta's paradise
We keep spendin' most our lives
Livin' in the gangsta's paradise

Power and the money, money and the power
Minute after minute, hour after hour
Everybody's runnin'
But half of them ain't lookin'
It's goin' on in the kitchen
But I don't know what's cookin'
They say I gotta learn
But nobody's here to teach me
If they can't understand it
How can they reach me?
I guess they can't, I guess they won't
I guess they frontin', that's why I know
My life is out of luck, fool!

They've been spendin' most their lives
Livin' in the gangsta's paradise
They've been spendin' most their lives
Livin' in the gangsta's paradise
We keep spendin' most our lives
Livin' in the gangsta's paradise
We keep spendin' most our lives
Livin' in the gangsta's paradise

Tell me, why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me?
Tell me, why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me?
