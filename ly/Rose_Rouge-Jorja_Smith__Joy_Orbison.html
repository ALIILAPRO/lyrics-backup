		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, Lord you don't need to bless him no more
You know that he's a sinner, oh Lord
Help me pray

I want you to get together
Put your hands together one time

I want you to get together
Put your hands together one time

I want you to get together
Put your hands together one time

I want you to get together
Put your hands together one time
And help me pray for a sinner from the ghetto, oh Lord

I want you to get together
Put your hands together one time

I want you to get together
Put your hands together one time

I want you to get together
Put your hands together one time
I want you to get together
Put your hands together one time

Oh Lord, help me please
Oh Lord, oh Lord
Oh Lord, oh Lord, oh Lord
