		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How long could you wait for someone you love?
Just looking for the tunnels of light coming down from above
I was waiting by the phone, the moment you call, the moment you gave
Just tell me all your secrets and lies, your barricades

When it gets dark, straight from the youth
Holding me back from falling, through tunnels of light emitted by you
I was waiting by the phone, the moment you called, the moment you gave
Where would I be without your secrets and lies, your barricades

Don't run away, don't run away, don't run away, don't run away
Just barricade now
Don't run away, don't run away, don't run away, don't run away
Just barricade now, oh

A memory of you plucked from the pool
Just tell me have I met you before, did we play the fool
Serenade me while I sleep, build up the walls, keep us out of sight
My memory's playing tricks and game, the madness you loved, the tunnels of light

Don't run away, don't run away, don't run away, don't run away
Just barricade now
Don't run away, don't run away, don't run away, don't run away
Just barricade now, oh
Don't run away, don't run away, don't run away, don't run away
Just barricade now
Don't run away, don't run away, don't run away, don't run away
Just barricade now, oh

Don't run away now, just barricade now

Don't run away, don't run away, don't run away, don't run away
Just barricade now, don't run away now, don't run away now
Don't run away, don't run away, don't run away, don't run away
Just barricade now, oh
Don't run away, don't run away, don't run away, don't run away
Just barricade now, don't run away now, don't run away now
Don't run away, don't run away, don't run away, don't run away
Just barricade now, oh

How long could you wait for someone you love?
Just looking for the tunnels of light coming down from above
