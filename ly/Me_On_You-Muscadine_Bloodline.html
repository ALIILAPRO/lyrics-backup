		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Girl, I hope your daddy doesn't own a gun
If he does, then I'm done from the things that you're doing to me
You run the coop and you rule the roost with a shake to your sugar 
They don't serve at dairy queen
You wrote the book and you set the hook 
And you 'bout to light the fuse and that's

Me on you
Like white on rice in your mama's jambalaya you ain't had in while
Me on you
Like black on night by the mighty Mississippi 
She's a-running for miles
Well, I know you know you gone and took control of me 
And there's nothing that I can do
'Til the break of dawn or the cows come home
I'll be right where you want me to be 
And that's me on you

Good God almighty and Lordy have mercy
Little mama got me fumblin', stumblin' by the way that she walks
I need your kiss like a catfish need a stank bait
Can't take the way you done and dropped my jaw
You cross the line, you take your time 
And you know I'm 'bout to be about it

Me on you
Like white on rice in your mama's jambalaya you ain't had in while
Me on you
Like black on night by the mighty Mississippi 
She's a-running for miles
Well, I know you know you gone and took control of me 
And there's nothing that I can do
'Til the break of dawn or the cows come home
I'll be right where you want me to be 
And that's me on you

Me on you
Like white on rice in your mama's jambalaya you ain't had in while
Me on you
Like black on night by the mighty Mississippi
She's a-running for miles
Me on you
Like white on rice in your mama's jambalaya you ain't had in while
Me on you
Like black on night by the mighty Mississippi 
She's a-running for miles
Well, I know you know you gone and took control of me 
And there's nothing that I can do
'Til the break of dawn or the cows come home
I'll be right where you want me to be 
And that's me on you
Oh, and that's me on you
