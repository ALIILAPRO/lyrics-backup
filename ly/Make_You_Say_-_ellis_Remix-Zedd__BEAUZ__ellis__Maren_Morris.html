		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You'll miss the weeks, the days, the hours
When all the loneliness kicks in
You'll buy them drinks and send them flowers
But they won't love you like I did

You'll learn one day
I'm one in a million
Maybe in a billion
And when it's too late
Oh, I got a feelin'
You'll be in your feelings

Go ahead, walk away
You're gonna miss the way I used to make you say
Oh my God, night and day
You're gonna miss the way I used to make you say

You're gonna miss the way I used to make you say

We had some highs and lows and in-betweens
We could've stayed and worked it out
You got your arms around her when you sleep
But I'm the one you dream about

You'll learn one day
I'm one in a million
(I'm one in a million)
Maybe in a billion
(Maybe in a billion)
And when it's too late
(Too late)
Oh, I got a feelin'
(Oh, I got a feelin')
You'll be in your feelings
(You'll be in your feelings, babe)

Go ahead, walk away
You're gonna miss the way I used to make you say
Oh my God (oh my God), night and day (night and day)
You're gonna miss the way I used to make you say

You're gonna miss the way I used to make you say

Go ahead, walk away
You're gonna miss the way I used to make you say
Oh my God, night and day
You're gonna miss the way I used to make you say
