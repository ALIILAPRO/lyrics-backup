(Kick it, fool)
('Mano)

It's Big Chant to you
I stick and move, nigga know I don't play that
Ain't no cappin' shit, we clappin' shit
Nigga know I'ma spray that
The opps goin' down, down
Finna make my way downtown
My trap nigga take me to pound town
Your girlfriend a ho, been around, 'round
Real right big B's, I throw it
I'm a real-ass P and they know it
Got bands, don't flex, nigga, blow it
Yeah, I'm really that bitch and I show it
How much I got? It's a whole lot
Kiss on that bitch, she a whole thot
Run in yo' trap, I'ma stick up the whole spot
Boy, you be everywhere hoes not

Want some? Yeah, want some? (Want some?)
Want some? Yeah, want some? (Want some?)
Why these bitches starin' at me like they want some? (Like they want some?)
Nigga, give me money like you owe me some (like you owe me some)
Ayy, I don't want your nigga, I just want his bands, want some? (Racks)
I walk outta Saks with a couple of bags, want some? (Racks)
Shooters behind me, they right in the van, who want some? (Who want some?)
Yeah, want some? (Want some? Yeah)
Want some? (Want some?)

I ball like I'm out in the big leagues
Don't pay for pussy, get freebies
I'm right at your nail, like some BBs
All these eyes on me, see these VVs
Like Rihanna, all my niggas need me
Can't BM me, I ain't Nene (hell no)
I'll have your ho whinin' like Cece
Like Megan, I need me a big freak (big freak)
Nigga send me that Cash App (Cash App)
Ain't no linkin', we past that
Sneak the blick' in the party, we crash that
Say he want smoke, we can match that
Talkin' behind me, I'm smashin'
I'm drippin' like all about action
Put it on him in designer fashion
Yeah, I want it all, if you askin'

Want some? Yeah, want some? (Want some?)
Want some? Yeah, want some? (Want some?)
Why these bitches starin' at me like they want some? (Like they want some?)
Nigga, give me money like you owe me some (like you owe me some)
Ayy, I don't want your nigga, I just want his bands, want some? (Racks)
I walk outta Saks with a couple of bags, want some? (Racks)
Shooters behind me, they right in the van, who want some? (Who want some?)
Yeah, want some? (Want some? Yeah)
Want some? (Want some?)

Want some? (Want some?)
(S.K.)
(Kick it, fool)
