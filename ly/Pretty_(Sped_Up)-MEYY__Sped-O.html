		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby est une déese, ok
Sculptée par la mer
Je te jure je suis obsessed, ok
Un éclat si clair
Si tu veux tu me rejoins backstage (Let me take you there)
J'admire ta silhouette submergée dans les lumières 

Tell me that you, feel like i do
Tell me you feel this thrill
Concept of true, beauty is you 
You look like honey and milk
I sink into, all that you do
You're paper and i'm ink

Babygirl you are so pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty
Babygirl you are so pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty
Venus made you just to trick me, trick me, trick me, trick me,
Cause babygirl you are so 
Venus made you just to trick me

The only reason that I came through tonight
Is cause i know u were invited
Only reason that this dress is skintight
Is cause i thought that you would like it
I'm only going to smoke this cigarette outside
Because I want you to light it
The only reason I came through tonight
Is because i really like you

And i can no longer hide it
I want to unravel your mind and
The laces that close up your tight dress, white dress
Tell me that you, feel like I do
Cherrykisses super smooth
Tell me all that baby
Tell me you like me too


Babygirl you are so pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty
Babygirl you are so pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty
Venus made you just to trick me, trick me, trick me, trick me,
Cause babygirl you are so 
Venus made you just to trick me
