		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I talk to the people that lie beneath these stones 
Imagining they listen makes me feel less alone
I pick up the broken flowers sometimes I dig a hole
To welcome in the new ones introduce them to the old

I can use a chisel and a polisher the same
Iʼll put anything youʼd like to say under a name
And Iʼll put on my suit make sure my tie is straight
Lend a hand to the mourning sending loved ones on there way

Well I ainʼt afraid of dying cause I know where Iʼll go
There Iʼll live forever on the streets made of gold
Till then Iʼll keep on workin you wonʼt hear me complain 
And every day Iʼll tip my hat to the rock that says my name

I hired on out of high school in 1968
My wife and I picked out a spot right up by the gate
It ainʼt much but every morning the sun shines on that ground 
One of these days when I clock out thats where Iʼm laying down

Well I ainʼt afraid of dying cause I know where Iʼll go
And there Iʼll live forever on the streets made of gold
Till then Iʼll keep on workinʼ you wonʼt hear me complain 
And every day Iʼll tip my hat to the rock that says my name

Born in Alabama 
June 1 9 5 0
Throw the dirt on top of me sow the seed and let it grow

Well I ainʼt afraid of dying cause I know where Iʼll go
There Iʼll live forever on the streets made of gold
Till then Iʼll keep on workin you wonʼt hear me complain 
And every day Iʼll tip my hat to the rock that says my name

Someday when Im under it I hope youʼll do the same
Stop by sometime and tip your hat to the rock that says my name

Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal: But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal: For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
Matthew 619-21 KJV
