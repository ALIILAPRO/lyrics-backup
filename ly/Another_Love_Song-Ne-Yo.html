		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  La la la la la
La la la la
La la la la la
Oh, I'mma sing it again say
La la la la la
La la la la
La la la la la

It's your eyes, I swear they look at me and I hear melodies
Sweetest melodies
Mix it with your smile babe
And come together for the perfect harmony
Prettiest song they'll never be

Now, ain't got no game babe
Ain't got no game
But, ain't got no shame babe
Ain't got no shame
And I don't know what it is
When I hear your name

Suddenly I just gotta sing
You make me wanna sing, another love song
Loud enough for everybody to hear
You make me wanna sing, another love song
And it started from the day you appeared

You make me wanna sing
You make me wanna sing
Girl you make me wanna sing
You make me wanna sing, another love song

It's your mouth, girl when you're smiling
Know you're smiling just for me
Nobody but me girl
Say the word babe
And anything you want that's what's it gonna be
I promise that's what's it gon' be

Ain't got no game babe
Ain't got no game
But, ain't got no shame babe
Ain't got no shame
And I don't know what it is
When I hear your name

Suddenly I just gotta sing
You make me wanna sing, another love song
Loud enough for everybody to hear
You make me wanna sing, another love song
And it started from the day you appeared

You make me wanna sing
You make me wanna sing
Girl you make me wanna sing
You make me wanna sing another love song

Sing it with me say
La la la la la
La la la la
La la la la la
Oh, I'mma sing it again say
La la la la la
La la la la
La la la la la
If you love somebody sing it with me
La la la la la
La la la la
La la la la la

Girl you make me wanna sing another love song
Loud enough for everybody to hear
You make me wanna sing, another love song
And it started from the day you appeared
You making me wanna sing
You make me wanna sing

Said you make me wanna sing
You make me wanna sing, another love song
