		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got up feeling so down
I got off being sold out
I've kept the movie rolling
But the story's getting old now, oh yeah
I just looked in the mirror
And things aren't looking so good
I'm looking California and feeling Minnesota, oh yeah

(So now you know) who gets mystified
(So now you know) who gets mystified

Show me the power child
I'd like to say
That I'm down on my knees today
Yeah, it gives me the butterflies, gives me away
'Til I'm up on my feet again
Hey, I'm feeling
Oh, I'm feeling outshined, outshined, outshined, outshined

Oh yeah
Yeah

Someone let the dogs out
They'll show you where the truth is
The grass is always greener
Where the dogs are shitting, oh yeah
Well, I'm feeling that I'm sober
Even though I'm drinking 
Well, I can't get any lower
Still I feel I'm sinking

(So now you know) who gets mystified
(So now you know) who gets mystified

Show me the power child
I'd like to say
That I'm down on my knees today
Yeah, it gives me the butterflies, gives me away
'Til I'm up on my feet again
I'm feeling 
Oh, I'm feeling outshined, outshined, outshined, outshined

Oh yeah, ooh

Outshined, oh-oh 
Oh-oh, oh

(So now you know) who gets mystified

Show me the power child
I'd like to say
That I'm down on my knees today
Yeah, it gives me butterflies, gives me away
'Til I'm up on my feet again
Oh, I'm feeling 
Oh, I'm feeling 

Show me the power child
I'd like to say
That I'm down on my knees today
And yeah, it gives me the butterflies, gives me away
'Til I'm up on my feet again
Oh, I'm feeling
Oh, I'm feeling
Outshined, outshined, outshined, outshined
