		  (Yeah)
(Yeah)

So you say you're movin'
Out of state, soon as you
Graduate, interesting (yeah)
Anyway, you're leavin'
Need a hug? Okay then
Call me up, no thanks, man (yeah)

I'm too busy, don't have time for

Drugs (drugs), drugs (drugs)
I just came here for the drugs

Everybody's either here for the drugs
Or the sex or the money or the fame
He's on the phone asking someone for the plug
And she's on the couch small talking, dropping names
I'm not here for nameless faces
Pointless talking, conversations (drugs)
Drugs (drugs), drugs
But I just came here for the
