		  (Konvict, Konvict)

Oh-whoa, oh-whoa
Oh-whoa, oh-whoa
Oh-whoa, oh-whoa
Oh-whoa, oh-whoa

I peeped you on the phone
Just showin' off ya stones
And notice that that pinky ring is bright enough, baby
I know you're not alone
But I could just be wrong
The way them fellas houndin' and sizin' you up, baby

And I like the way you take advantage of
Every man you love
(I see) and I know your game, girl
But I don't mind if you come and play with us
Just don't talk too much
(I see) so cute you don't have to say a word

See, all those guys wanna come treat you right
'Cause you're sweeter than apple pie
Everything that you want you got
Girl, you know that you need to stop
Most beautiful thing in sight
Always takin' on the spotlight
Always in the club lookin' hot
Girl, you know that you need to stop

Always talkin' 'bout what you got (ay)
Always talkin' 'bout what you got (ay)
Always talkin' 'bout what you got (ay)
Girl, you know that you need to stop (ay)
Always talkin' 'bout what you got (ay)
Always talkin' 'bout what you got (ay)
Always talkin' 'bout what you got (ay)
Girl, you know that you need to stop (ay)

Girl, I can tell you want something to love
That's why you hold on to everything that pass you by
Can't resist, girl, and I can't lie
Now tell if you are here for me
Or everybody watchin' you shake from left to right
The way you move got me hypnotized

And I like the way you take advantage of
Every man you love
(I see) and I know your game, girl
But I don't mind if you come and play with us
Just don't talk too much
(I see) so cute you don't have to say a word

See, all those guys wanna come treat you right
'Cause you're sweeter than apple pie
Everything that you want you got
Girl, you know that you need to stop
Most beautiful thing in sight
Always takin' on the spotlight
Always in the club lookin' hot
Girl, you know that you need to stop

Always talkin' 'bout what you got (ay)
Always talkin' 'bout what you got (ay)
Always talkin' 'bout what you got (ay)
Girl, you know that you need to stop (ay)
Always talkin' 'bout what you got (ay)
Always talkin' 'bout what you got (ay)
Always talkin' 'bout what you got (ay, Akon)
Girl, you know that you need to stop (ay)

Can't keep my eyes away from you, girl 
When you get on the floor and do what you do
And everybody wanna come back to that body 
The kind that remind me somethin' like you
'Cause you're that type to drive a man crazy 
Will snatch him away from his lady
No matter how hard the man hold back 
He'll end up callin' you baby
And they never really know what to do 
Once you expose that thing you do
You had him crawlin' on hands and knees 
And ya find a way to get 'em out that cheese
And while you thinkin' you the only dude 
She off in the mall livin' off of you
Lettin' everybody know she got you 
And now you feel like a fool

See, all those guys wanna come treat you right
'Cause you're sweeter than apple pie
Everything that you want you got
Girl, you know that you need to stop
Most beautiful thing in sight
Always takin' on the spotlight
Always in the club lookin' hot
Girl, you know that you need to stop

Always talkin' 'bout what you got (ay)
Always talkin' 'bout what you got (ay)
Always talkin' 'bout what you got (ay)
Girl, you know that you need to stop (ay)
Always talkin' 'bout what you got (ay)
Always talkin' 'bout what you got (ay)
Always talkin' 'bout what you got (ay)
Girl, you know that you need to stop (ay)
