		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I have finally found a way to live
Just like I never could before
I know that I don't have much to give,
But I can open any door

Everybody knows the secret,
Everybody knows the score, yeah yeah yeah
I have finally found a way to live
In the color of the Lord

I have finally found a place to live
Just like I never could before
And I know I don't have much to give,
But soon I'll open any door

Everybody knows the secret,
Everybody knows the score
I have finally found a place to live, oh
In the presence of the Lord
In the presence of the Lord

I have finally found a way to live
Just like I never could before
And I know I don't have much to give,
But I can open any door

Everybody knows the secret,
I said everybody knows the score
I have finally found a way to live, oh
In the color of the Lord
In the color of the Lord
