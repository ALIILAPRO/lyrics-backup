		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can tell by the way you feel
Something ain't going your way
Jeans too tight, and your hair ain't right
We all get some of those days
Oh, throw that mirror away
Oh, you know it's gonna be okay

Take it down
Shake it out on the floor
You'll get over it
Let it drop, make it stop, oh

When you feel like nothin'
Everybody's somethin'
You and your friend
Everybody jump in
Look at us now
Everybody shout out
Oh, in the spotlight

No matter what you're outside
Get in with your inside
Open your eyes, you deserve a spotlight
Don't be from them, everybody's something
Oh oh, oh oh, in the spotlight
Oh oh, in the spotlight
Oh oh, in the spotlight
Oh oh, in the spotlight

I got an "uh oh" on my face
Wish I could press delete
We all got something we don't like
Even Angelina Jolie
Oh, throw that mirror away
Oh, don't be goin' M.I.A

Take it down
Shake it out on the floor
You'll get over it
Let it drop, make it stop, oh

When you feel like nothin'
Everybody's somethin'
You and your friend
Everybody jump in
Look at us now
Everybody shout out
Oh, in the spotlight

No matter what you're outside
Get in with your inside
Open your eyes, you deserve a spotlight
Don't be from them, everybody's something
Oh oh, oh oh, in the spotlight
Oh oh, in the spotlight
Oh oh, in the spotlight
Oh oh, in the spotlight

I can tell by the way you talk that talk
That somethin' ain't going your way
'Cause your jeans too tight, and your hair ain't right
Well, we all get some of those days

Just take another deep breath
Try to reach your reset
You know that I can relate
Put your hands in the air
Now let me hear you shout out
Well, get outta my way

Take it down
Shake it out on the floor
You'll get over it
Let it drop, make it stop, oh

When you feel like nothin'
Everybody's somethin'
You and your friend
Everybody jump in
Look at us now
Everybody shout out
Oh, in the spotlight

No matter what you're outside
Get in with your inside
Open your eyes, you deserve a spotlight
Don't be from them, everybody's something
Oh oh

When you feel like nothin'
Everybody's somethin'
You and your friend
Everybody jump in
Look at us now
Everybody shout out
Oh, in the spotlight

No matter what you're outside
Get in with your inside
Open your eyes, you deserve a spotlight
Don't be from them, everybody's something
Oh oh, oh oh, in the spotlight
Oh oh, in the spotlight
Oh oh, in the spotlight
Oh oh, in the spotlight
