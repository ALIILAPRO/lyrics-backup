		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sometimes I wonder if everything changed
How could we make out?
And now suddenly thunder and everything's changed
There's this big dark cloud
Hovering

Hovering, hovering, hovering
You always said that we'd make it through
Troubling, stumbling, fumbling
For the words to say that I'm leaving you
I'm leaving you

We go through the motions like everything's settled
But it's inside out
And it makes us uncomfortable still holding on
When there's all this doubt
Hovering

Hovering, hovering, hovering
You always said that we'd make it through
Troubling, stumbling, fumbling
For the words to say that I'm leaving you
I'm leaving you

And maybe we're just older (older)
Just a little older (older)
And 'cause the fact that this is over
The fact that this is over with you's been

Hovering, stumbling, fumbling
You always said that we'd make it through
Troubling, stumbling, fumbling
For the words to say that I'm leaving you
Leaving you

Troubling, stumbling, fumbling
For the word to say that I'm leaving you
You always said we'd make it through
You always said we'd make it through
