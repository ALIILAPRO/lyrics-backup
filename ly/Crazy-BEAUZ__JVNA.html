		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When there's no hope hiding
No chance concealing
What deep down I felt for you
I regret for losing
The one who loved me
For who I can't go back to
Walking through all the dust
Memories in frame
A past we simply let fade
But I don't close the door
Waiting the chance
For when we'll be back again
You make me feel so crazy
Still in love with you
You make me feel amazing
When I'm next to you
You make me feel so crazy
My heart breaks for you
Can't help but knowing
That I'm still in love with you
You make me feel so
When there's no hope loving
For you who saw me
Before I knew who I'd be
What I have around me
Means nothing to me
If I can't share it with you
Walking through all the dust
Memories in frame
A past we simply let fade
But I don't close the door
Waiting the chance
For when we'll be back again
You make me feel so crazy
Still in love with you
You make me feel amazing
When I'm next to you
You make me feel so crazy
My heart breaks for you
Can't help but knowing
That I'm still in love with you
You make me feel so
