		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Alright

Won't you come into my room, I wanna show you all my wares
I just want to see your blood, I just want to stand and stare
See the blood begin to flow as it falls upon the floor
Iron Maiden can't be fought, Iron Maiden can't be sought

Oh well, wherever, wherever you are
Iron Maiden's gonna get you, no matter how far
See the blood flow watching it shed up above my head
Iron Maiden wants you for dead

Won't you come into my room, I wanna show you all my wares
I just want to see your blood, I just want to stand and stare
See the blood begin to flow as it falls upon the floor
Iron Maiden can't be fought, Iron Maiden can't be sought

Oh well, wherever, wherever you are
Iron Maiden's gonna get you, no matter how far
See the blood flow, watching it shed, up above my head
Iron Maiden wants you for dead

Won't you come into my room, I wanna show you all my wares
I just want to see your blood, I just want to stand and stare
See the blood begin to flow as it falls upon the floor
Iron Maiden can't be fought, Iron Maiden can't be sought

Oh well, wherever, wherever you are
Iron Maiden's gonna get you, no matter how far
See the blood flow, watching it shed, up above my head
Iron Maiden wants you for dead

Oh, oh
Yeah-yeah
