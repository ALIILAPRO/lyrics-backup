		  Free

I wasn't born to be an angel
I cut my feet along the road
But it reminds me of the days where I was happy
Playing games with neighbor's kids I hardly know
And they say I was born to be a suspect
I carry all the fault
And it still bothers me the way I went about it
But I had to leave, you know I had to go

And I knew in time I'd find the end to all the answers
And I knew in time I'd find I'd carried all the pain
But I knew in time I'd find a way to just forgive myself
To forgive myself for leaving you that way

But now I'm free, my darlin'
But now I'm free, my darlin', my darlin'
But now I'm free, my darlin'
Now I'm free (I'm free, my darlin', I'm free, my darlin'), my darlin', my darlin'

And I'm ashamed of all the things you've ever said I've done
Oh, I promise you that I'm ashamed about it
But you never took the blame
No, no, no, not even once
While I carry mine alone and drink about it
And I was reaching for your hand
I would look you in the eye
I was lyin' on the floor, I was fightin' for my life
But you never took the blame
While I still carry mine, I

But now I'm free, my darlin'
Now I'm free, my darlin', my darlin'

And since I went away, yeah, I know you think about us
But you haven't got the head and heart to show it
Oh, but it wasn't only you, yeah, I was angry too
So I'll take my bow and I'll accept my moment

And I knew in time I'd find the end to all the answers
And I knew in time I'd find I'd carried all the pain
But I knew in time I'd find a way to just forgive myself
To forgive myself for leaving you that way

I'm free, my darlin'
I'm free, my darlin'
I'm free, my darlin'
I'm free
I'm free, my darlin'
I'm free, my darlin' (darlin', darlin', darlin')
I'm free, my darlin'
I'm free
I'm free, my darlin'
I'm free, my darlin'
I'm free, my darlin'
I'm free
I'm free, my darlin'
I'm free, my darlin'
I'm free, my darlin'
I'm free
Let me be free
