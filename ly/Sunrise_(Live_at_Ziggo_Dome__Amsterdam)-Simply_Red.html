		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  As I look into your eyes I see the sunrise
The light behind your face helps me realize (sunrise)

Will we sleep and sometimes love until the moon shines
Maybe the next time I'll be yours and maybe you'll be mine (sunrise)

I don't know if it's even in your mind at all
It could be me
At this moment in time is it in your mind at all?
It should be me, it could be me
Forever
Forever

Wandering through life, will love come home to you?
And the love you want forever, will they be true to you?

Will we sleep and sometimes love until the moon shines?
Maybe the next time I'll be yours and maybe you'll be mine (maybe mine)

I don't know if it's even in your mind at all
It could be me
At this moment in time, love's indescribable
It should be me, it could be me
Forever

Easy, ready, willing, over time
Where does it stop, where do you dare me to draw the line?
You've got the body now you want my soul
Don't even think about it, say "no-go"

(Sunrise) I don't know if it's even in your mind at all
It could be me
At this moment in time is it in your mind at all?
It should be me, it could be me
Forever

(Sunrise) at this moment in time is it in your mind at all?
It should be me, it could be me
Forever
Forever

(Sunrise)
