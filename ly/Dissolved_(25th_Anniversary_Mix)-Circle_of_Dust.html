		  (There exists no dream worth chasing if it cannot satisfy)
(There exists no god worth serving if he cannot hear your cries)
(There exists no dream worth chasing if it cannot satisfy)
(There exists no god worth serving if he cannot hear your cries)

Your wealth
Your pride
Dissolved
In time

Your wealth
Your pride
Dissolved
In time
Reduced
To dust
Your worthless treasures rust

Reduced
To dust
Your worthless treasures rust

Your wealth
Your pride
Dissolved
In time
Reduced
To dust
Your worthless treasures rust

Your wealth
Your pride
Dissolved
In time
Reduced
To dust
Your worthless treasures rust

Your wealth
Your pride
Dissolved
In time
Reduced
To dust
Your worthless treasures rust

(There exists no dream worth chasing if it cannot satisfy)
(There exists no god worth serving if he cannot hear your cries)
(There exists no dream worth chasing if it cannot satisfy)
(There exists no god worth serving if he cannot hear your cries)
