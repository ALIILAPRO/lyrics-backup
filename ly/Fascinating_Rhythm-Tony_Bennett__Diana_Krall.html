		  Fascinating rhythm
You've got me on the go
Fascinating rhythm
I'm all a-quiver

What a mess you're making
The neighbors want to know
Why I'm always shaking
Just like a flivver

Each morning I get up with the sun
To find at night no work has been done

I know that
Once it didn't matter
But now you're doing wrong
When you start to patter
I'm so unhappy
Won't you take a day off?
Decide to run along
Somewhere far away off
And make it snappy

Oh, how I long to be the girl I used to be
Fascinating rhythm
Oh, won't you stop picking on me?

Fascinating rhythm
You've got me on the go
Fascinating rhythm
I'm all a-quiver

What a mess you're making
The neighbors want to know
Why I'm always shaking
Just like a flivver

Each morning I wake up with the sun
To find at night no work has been done

I know that
Once it didn't matter
But now you're doing wrong
When you start to patter
I'm so unhappy

Won't you take the day off?
Decide to run along
Somewhere far away off
And make it snappy

Oh, how I long to be the girl I used to be
Fascinating rhythm
Oh, won't you stop picking on me?

Fascinating rhythm
Won't you stop picking on me?

Fascinating rhythm
Won't you stop picking on me?
