		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've tried to write
A million other songs, but
Somehow I can't move on, oh, you're gone

Takes time, alright
And I know it's no one's fault, but
Somehow I can't move on, oh, you're gone

Saudade
Saudade
Nothing more that I can say
Says it in a better way

Saudade
Saudade
Nothing more that I can say
Turn it in a better way

I've tried, alright
But it's killing me inside
Thought you'd be by my side always

Takes time, alright
And I know it's no one's fault, but
Somehow I can't move on, oh, you're gone

Saudade
Saudade
Nothing more that I can say
Turn it in a better way

Saudade
Saudade
Nothing more that I can say
Says it in a better way

Now you're gone

And now you're gone

And now you're gone

Saudade
Saudade
Takes time, alright

Saudade
Saudade
And I know it's no one's fault

Saudade
Saudade
I've tried, alright

Saudade
Saudade
But it's killing me inside

Thought you'd be by my side always
