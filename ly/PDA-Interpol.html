		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yours is the only version of my desertion that I could ever subscribe to
That is all that I can do
You are a past dinner, the last winner, I'm raking all around me
Until the last drop is behind you

You're so cute when you're frustrated, dear
Well, you're so cute when you're sedated, dear
I'm resting

Sleep tight, grim rite
We have two hundred couches where you can sleep tight, grim rite
We have two hundred couches where you can sleep tight, grim rite
We have two hundred couches where you can sleep tonight
Sleep tonight, sleep tonight
Sleep tonight

You are the only person who's completely certain there's nothing here to be into
That is all that you can do
You are a past sinner, the last winner and everything we've come to 
It makes you, you 
You cannot safely say while I will be away 
That you will not consider sadly 
How you helped me to stray
You will not reach me I am 
Resenting a position that's fast resentment 
And now I can consider now there is this distance so 

Sleep tight, grim rite
We have two hundred couches where you can sleep tight, grim rite
We have two hundred couches where you can sleep tight, grim rite
We have two hundred couches where you can sleep tonight
Sleep tonight, sleep tonight
Sleep tonight

Something to say
Something to do
Nothing to say
When there's nothing to do (ah, ah)
