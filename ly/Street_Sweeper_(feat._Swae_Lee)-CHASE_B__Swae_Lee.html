		  Yo Chase B
Chase B
Let's go

You know what the fuck it is, what you mean by that
3 wheelers in the alley with the baseball bats
You can take one to the face but you can't fall flat
Turn her to a bad bitch now she know how to act

I'm getting money right now I'ma hit you right back
Always looking at you stern cause I came to collect
I would say I came back, but a nigga never left
Now that foreign a mirage if you thought you seen it

Put some ice on my fingers like I'm playing freeze tag
Taught some plays to my niggas and they tryna intercept
Put the ticket in her name and of course she love that
But she know street sweepers so you know you getting swept

I can't talk about my old thing I wish the best for her
Trappin' out the old school like I'm Questlove
Niggas get the check and they get disrespectful
Just call me the paper boy cause I got Extra

Five second rule when that money touch the floor
Just landed in Tulum but the world we can explore
I used to couldn't buy it out the store
I can't see myself without it anymore

You know what the fuck it is, what you mean by that
3 wheelers in the alley with the baseball bats
You can take one to the face but you can't fall flat
Turn her to a bad bitch now she know how to act

I'm getting money right now I'ma hit you right back
Always looking at you stern cause I came to collect
I would say I came back, but a nigga never left
Now the foreign a mirage if you thought you seen it
