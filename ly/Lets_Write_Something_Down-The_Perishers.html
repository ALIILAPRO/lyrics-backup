		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let's write something down
Let us come clean
Before you leave town
Let's write something down

I don't want it all
I just want what's mine
While you're still around
Let's write something down

Would you care to know?
Would you care to know?
That I forgot someone like you
Would you care to know?
Would you care to know?
That it wasn't hard to do

Let's write something down
Let's gather our troops
Before you leave town
Let's write something down

I don't wanna fight
I wanna make up
While you're still around
Let's write something down

Would you care to know?
Would you care to know?
That I forgot someone like you
Would you care to know?
Would you care to know?
That it wasn't hard to do

Yeah, would you care to know?
Would you care to know?
That I forgot someone like you
And would you care to know?
Would you care to know?
That it wasn't hard to do
