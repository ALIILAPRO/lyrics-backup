		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm lost in your eyes
Reaching out to cross the great divide
You are drifting away
Mind and soul and body day by day

Nothing's stopping you and I
It's do or die tonight

So tell me why I'm alone
When we're lying here together
On a night that's so cold
And you're just a touch away
Baby try to hold on
Till we make it to forever
We're alive
And the future never dies

I've been dying inside
Holding back the tears I never cried
Now I'm down on my knees
Cause everything you are is what I need

You're the meaning of it all
Don't let me fall you've gotta

Tell me why I'm alone
When we're lying here together
On a night that's so cold
And you're just a touch away
Baby try to hold on
Till we make it to forever
We're alive
And the future never dies
We're alive
And the future never dies

We've got to come together
Cause everybody needs a heart to hold
Can't you see it's now or never
Cause we've got nowhere else to go

Tell me why I'm alone
When we're lying here together

Baby try to hold on
Till we make it to forever
We're alive
And the future never dies
We're alive
And the future never dies
In your eyes
The future never dies
