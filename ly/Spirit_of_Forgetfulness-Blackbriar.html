		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The thought of you possesses me
You're the dweller of my mind
Where you are utterly and vividly alive

I called upon Lethe
The spirit of forgetfulness
I implored her deeply
To erase my memory
She said "Be careful what you wish for, deary"

"Those waters aren't meant for the living
For all you know, I could be a trickster
Merciless and unforgiving
I might not be your well-wisher"

Lethe decided to help me
The spirit of oblivion
She took me to the underworld
Among the souls of the dead
Where I drank from the river
To help me forget

"Those waters aren't meant for the living
For all you know, I could be a trickster
Merciless and unforgiving
I might not be your well-wisher"

And I forgot it all
Yet I still remember you
I've got no remembrance of who I am
Oh, I forgot it all
Yet I still remember you
I've got no remembrance of who I am
Yet I still know you through and through

Those waters aren't meant for the living
I made a desperate deal with a trickster
Merciless and unforgiving
A misleading voice, with a truthful whisper
Those waters aren't meant for the living
I made a desperate deal with a trickster
Merciless and unforgiving
A misleading voice, with a truthful whisper
Misleading voice, with a truthful whisper
