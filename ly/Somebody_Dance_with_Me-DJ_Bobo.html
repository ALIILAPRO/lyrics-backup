		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm back again on a higher stage
Listen to my party beat and get in rage
'Cause you know when I flow and I show you so
Which way is better,
Which way you got to go to make a fun house party or notty
You gotta check this out yo la da di
There's a party over there
With glamours and glare do dance and move you, pump that body
Move your body up and down
Side to side it is party time
Yeah that's right we're dancing tonight
'Til the sun is coming and the sky is bright
Then we are coming to an end like you understand
That I'm a party man did the best I can
To make you laugh again now I'm out of the scene

I've got this feeling
Somebody dance with me
Somebody dance with me
I've got this feeling
Somebody dance with me
Somebody dance with me

Another time, another place
Another rhyme done for every race
In your case we're getting rough
I'm not going to stop until you get enough
'Cause you groove back and forth, forth and back
Then you see it yourself it's like a heart attack
My rhymes combination, infiltration
Situation all over the nation
Like round and round, upside down
Living my life 'til your feet are on the ground
Then put your hands up in the air
Wave them like you just don't care
And if you are ready to rock, then rock with me
Somebody say oh yeah, (oh yeah)
Oh yeah, (oh yeah)

Au

I've got this feeling
Somebody dance with me
Somebody dance with me
I've got this feeling
Somebody dance with me
Somebody dance with me

Now it's just the time I think you are with it
So make some room and space just to hit it
Move, move that body
Ba didely didely di, yeah we make a party
To the B to the O to the B to the O
Wanna rock your body wanna rock your soul
But I never ever said, I do it better
Just know the time, yes I'm clever

I've got this feeling
Somebody dance with me
Somebody dance with me
I've got this feeling
Somebody dance with me
Somebody dance with me

Somebody dance with me
Somebody dance with me
I've got this feeling
Somebody dance with me
Somebody dance with me

I've got this feeling
Somebody dance with me
Somebody dance with me

Au
