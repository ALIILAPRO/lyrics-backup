		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Say you’re hurting... but that’s not where you’re at
But then again who am I… to say a word about that
Come again?  Did you wanna ask something?
Amen! I’m ready for judging
Forget- I even said anything
Better yet- Turn around and start walking

So I sleep on it ’til next morning
Recurring dream so far from close
This nightmare is not my first warning
So on and on it goes

Relapse once again drain out my peace of mind
Too blind to witness the nature of my crime

I remember sitting thru this strife
I didn’t just meet you, I’ve known you my whole life
You tell me- to grab a knife or a bottle
Watch your life- travel by at full throttle
I’m done- rackin’ out my fried brain
Just go away- you’re nothing new,
you’re all the same

You knew my story turn a page and read the signs
They speak of relapse between selected lines

Relapse once again drain out my peace of mind
Too blind to witness the nature of my crime

The thought of turning back
sends shivers down my spine
Your delusions sure as hell were never mine
You knew my story from the get go, read the signs
They scream of relapse between selected lines
