		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Aging fast, how long does summer last ?
I thought it through, I'm on my final synapse
And I'm a fool for believing
In angels that would never write back
You see they call on me baby
They tell me that I'm never enough
Everybody so gassed yeah
Hoping I can move past it
I been biting my tongue, I been down and high strung, I been running on empty
Now I write back
Looking through the window
Thinkin of the way I could formulate a memento
But I don't really wanna talk like that
Should of never let you call me back
Cigarettes and daydreams
Remembering that day we
Met your voice was shaking
Reminisce about the past
How you dressed and how you laughed
I still think about your ass
Said I been come down living, I'm never healing
Stuck in a moment I'm hitting my ceiling
Tell me how do you stay in one place
Stick around here enough to show face
Forever fighting my impurity
I need to see, my mind at ease, apparently
No I never meant to feel that way
Chemicals still drive my brain
No I never meant to dig my grave
Nostalgic rolling wave
Everybody so gassed yeah
Hoping I can move past it
I been biting my tongue, I been down and high strung, I been running on empty
Now I write back
Looking through the window
Thinkin of the way I could formulate a memento
But I don't really wanna talk like that
Should of never let you call me back
