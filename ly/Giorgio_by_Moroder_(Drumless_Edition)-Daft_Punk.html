		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I was fifteen, sixteen
When I started really to play guitar
I definitely wanted to become a musician
It was almost impossible because, it was
The dream was so big
That I didn't see any chance
Because I was living in a little town, was studying
And when I finally broke away from school
And became a musician
I thought "well, now I may have a little bit of a chance"
Because all I really wanted to do is music
And not only play music, but compose music

At that time, in Germany, in '69, '70
They had already discotheques
So I would take my car, would go to a discotheque
Sing maybe thirty minutes
I think I had about seven, eight songs
I would partially sleep in the car
Because I didn't want to drive home
And that helped me for about
Almost two years to survive
In the beginning
I wanted to do an album with the sounds of the fifties
The sounds of the sixties, of the seventies
And then have a sound of the future
And I thought "Wait a second
I know the synthesizer, why don't I use the synthesizer
Which is the sound of the future"
And I didn't have any idea what to do but I knew I needed a click
So we put a click on the 24-track
Which then was synced to the Moog modular
I knew that could be a sound of the future
But I didn't realize how much the impact would be

My name is Giovanni Giorgio, but everybody calls me Giorgio

Once you free your mind about a concept of
Harmony and of music being correct
You can do whatever you want
So nobody told me what to do
And there was no preconception of what to do
