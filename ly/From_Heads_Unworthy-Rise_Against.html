		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We are the children you reject and disregard
These aching cries come from the bottom of our hearts
You can't disown us now, we are your own flesh and blood
And we don't disappear just because your eyes are shut, now tell me

Love, loss
Like a bullet's path
Tear through
The cavity of my chest
Lights out
Because the fuse has blown

As their castles crumble slowly
We watch them fall
Their crown slips from heads unworthy
As we gain control

This is the family that we crossed or never had
This is a war that was lost the day it began
'Cause it's the race we run, but it keeps us at the start
And it's the song I sung from the bottom of my heart, that's how we

Read you
Like a polygraph
Not one
Single bone in your back
Own up
To how you let us down

As their castles crumble slowly
We watch them fall
Their crown slips from heads unworthy
As we gain control

Except for you and me, love
Everyone's the same, we know, we know, we know, we know
But if to live, we have to be numb
I'd rather know the pain, I'd rather know, I'd rather know
This happens almost never
But it happened once to me
And this will never be the same
The ends we seam together

I'm not after fame and fortune
I'm after you
When I've served my time I swear I
Will come back for you

(Watch them fall)
As their castles crumble slowly
We watch them fall
Their crown slips from heads unworthy
And right onto us

But, I'm after you
I'm after you
I'm after you
Yeah, I'm after you.
