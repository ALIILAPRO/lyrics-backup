More money, more problems
More guns, more violence
I beat a couple cases, I feel like John Gotti
Hop out a Benz baby, I feel like thug life
I feel like takin' some drink right now and pourin' it up with my niggas
We ain't never turned down, I'm a Big Dipper
Big tipper
You want it, you buy it, you get it
Cash on deliver, Ros√© on my liver
Headshots, head shots for my enemies
Shit got a money machine clickin'
You know how I kick it, hey
Leavin' a witness gon' send you the penitentiary way
He get it, she get it, they get it too
Lay on ya, spray on ya, hop in the Coupe
You didn't know about Molly World 'til I introduced you
You can be sober as fuck, this money is gon' seduce you
My hustle is gon' seduce you
My vibe, ain't none of these niggas comparin' to me
Don't none of these niggas compare to me
Most of these niggas are fans of me
I really appreciate it
I really, I really, I really, I really I do
Majority of these bitches ain't loyal, they all done been ran through
I stay at it, get at it, work on it, count up and count up and count up
Payback a Maybach, I sit back and lay back and flip through the channels
I flip through the channels, I'm watchin' the streets and I know I ain't Desiigner
I'm seein' the animosity, the riots is on CNN
I got some homies that just got out, some ones that just went in

The deeper the ocean, the deeper the pain
Blow out their brains, switch through lanes
Ain't gotta call out no names
They know I'm married to the game
