		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You can't front, we comin' with the shots to pump
We got more 'cause it's what you want
Thump it in your section and throughout your section
In your area, throughout your whole section, yo

You can't front, we comin' with the shots to pump
We got more 'cause it's what you want
Thump it in your section and throughout your section
In your area, throughout your whole section, yo

y'all know the dynasty, the Roots repertoire
The lieutenant from the reservoir, serve the spar
The injurar, preditar of a competitar
I send MCs where the paramedics are
At first, I'm like "nah", I'm nonchalant from afar
Then strike to cut the fake rap star jugular
With irregular balance of the cat burgla-rar
Known to parlay with Garcia Vega cigars
I know the flavor because me and the thugs minds are mutual
We congruent, lay on the corner with the trauma unit
I'm from the lab where the bomb's distributed
So never try to duplicate the skills executed
Son you'd get electrocuted from the worldwide reputed
Shine like nickel heat that blow your mind when I shoot it
Some know me as the man that's from the Roots crew
Others as the bad lieutenant of Snyder Avenue
We go an eye for an eye
Behead like a samurai that'll command the dynasty until he die
Who will imply that I lack a-biliti?
Make your words known, amplify the you-tiliti
I'm crooked like the "I" on a toxic malt liquor
The land whipper, the Dom Perignon champ sipper
The fifth'll bring it all together like the zipper on a butter leather
The bad lieu a bring the bad weather
So to whoever got riff, let it rest
Reflect, then recollect on the way it was set
It's the veteran architect that flows with the rhythm of sex
Be on the low shotgun in the Lex
With my man low to flex
I'm restin where they handle the Tecs
And the lyrical vandal is next flow
So my man, my mizza, my man
M-ilitant, what's the master plan?
Once again

You can't front, we comin' with the shots to pump
We got more 'cause it's what you want
Thump it in your section and throughout your section
In your area, throughout your whole section, yo

You can't front, we comin' with the shots to pump
We got more 'cause it's what you want
Thump it in your section and throughout your section
In your area, throughout your whole section, yo

Peep the oratory, niggaz bore me with theatrics
Moms listen to they daughter story about my packets
The adverse is on your table, stabilize emotion
A soldier at ease, but on post of up most in
Brag and boast in my anecdotes that choke
Invade your whole terrain, you feel the pain provoke
When I breaststroke your wavelength of intensity
My alliance bring forth to you an entity
Your whole vicinity, I contaminate with hate
Got no time to debate, but hold up wait, sit straight
It's in mil, the elicit, you violate, you get a ticket
MCs you can't tell I expel, you get evicted
From out your misery, serve your ass with my delivery
Allah makes the ground you steppin' on shivery
Permanent tears run through your thoughts you queers
It's all upstairs, where there's a crowd, table and chairs
For years, been on the mic, I'm like a dike with stairs
When I strike, I stay severe, niggaz stay low in they glare
From over here, my Range Rover square to blast offside
Switch the pitch from southpaw to unorthodox
I shock your brain with the miscellaneous
Who beez the zaniest, nigga with words that are spontaneous?

A yo, the purpose mainly is to generate the Luther Van
Lyrical contraband, controllin' your command and

You can't front, we comin' with the shots to pump
We got more 'cause it's what you want
Thump it in your section and throughout your section
In your area, throughout your whole section, yo

You can't front, we comin' with the shots to pump
We got more 'cause it's what you want
Thump it in your section and throughout your section
In your area, throughout your whole section, yo

All the way live from two fifteen, all the way live from the six ten
Gettin' cash, get the gusto
One time, it's the dynasty flow
Runnin' it down the line, it's another
Yeah, you in tune to another ill
Fifth dynasty production baby
