		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I fell down, down, down
Into this dark and lonely hole
There was no one there to
Care about me anymore and I needed a way
To climb and grab a hold of the edge
You were sitting there holding a rope

And we'll go up, up, up
But I'll fly a little higher
Go up in the clouds
Because the view's a little nicer
Up here, my dear it won't be long now
It won't be long now

When we get back on land
Well, I'll never get my chance
Be ready to live and it'll be
Ripped right out of my hands
And maybe someday we'll take a little ride
We'll go up, up
Up and everything will be just fine

And we'll go up, up, up
But I'll fly a little higher
Go up in the clouds
Because the view's a little nicer
Up here, my dear it won't be long now
It won't be long now

If only i had a little bit more time
If only
I had a little bit more time with you

We could go up, up, up
And take that little ride
We'll sit there holding hands
And everything will be just right
And maybe someday i'll see you again
We'll float up in the clouds
And we'll never see the end
And we'll go up, up, up
But I'll fly a little higher
Go up in the clouds
Because the view's a little nicer
Up here, my dear it won't be long now
It won't be long now
