		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Fuck that bitch, fuck that bitch)
(Fuck that bitch, fuck that bitch)

Kicked open the coffin
Kept it movin'
Let my nuts hang, blade goes back and forth
Then south and north, I know them cuts stain
Scars up on my body
Beg me, tell me sorry, bitch
You can run but you can't hide
Goodbye, there ain't no stoppin' this

You've been talkin' like I know you, I don't think so, wait
You're that piece of shit I threw out with the trash
How could I forget, silly me, you let me bleed slow
Watched me fade away but guess what, bitch? I came right back

Get it through your fuckin' head!
You can't kill me, no, 'cause I'm already dead
Told myself I'd never let you in again
Tell you what, how 'bout you fuck another friend
This ain't an anthem, oh no, this is my revenge

Called your girl, she told me to air it out
So, I said, "Okay then I'll go ahead and tell you now"
I hope you rot went from everything to just another thot
Hate been buildin' up inside of me and trust me it's a lot

Bitch, I kicked open the coffin
Kept it movin'
Let my nuts hang, blade goes back and forth
Then south and north, I know them cuts stain
Scars up on my body
Beg me, tell me, sorry, bitch
You can run but you can't hide
Goodbye, there ain't no stoppin' this

Little gas lighter, homie hopper, never know what's next
Took the dick out of your mouth a sec to beg me for a check
How pathetic, I said I'd forgive you, no, fuck that, I never meant it
Burned into my brain, I won't forget it
Call me mean, call me trash, I think I'm ok with that
After what you did to me, I'm glad I'm here to pay it back
Stack my cash, hope you suffer, let me watch like you did to me
Funny how your people turn into your biggest enemies

Sorry, wait a minute, actually, no, I'm not sorry
It's so sad that you turned out to be so sorry
We ain't ever comin' back from this now are we?

I think you should get it through your fuckin' head
You can't kill me, no, 'cause I'm already dead
Told myself I'd never let you in again
Tell you what, how 'bout you fuck another friend
This ain't an anthem, oh no, this is my revenge

(Fuck that bitch, fuck that bitch)
(Fuck that bitch, fuck that bitch)
(Fuck that bitch, fuck that bitch)
(Fuck that bitch, fuck that bitch)
