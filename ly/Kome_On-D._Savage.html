I'm back, kome on, kome on, kome on kome on, hey
Kome on, kome on, kome on, kome on, huh
Hunnids on hunnids, kome on
I'm in that motherfuckin' zone
Back in that motherfuckin' mode
Jump in the streets and I turn to a beast
Kome on, kome on, kome on, kome on, hey 
Kome on, kome on, kome on, kome on, huh
I got some killers, kome on
They gon' pop out if it's on
Fuck it, I'm gettin' them whacked
I'm in the stu' makin' songs

Block so block so hot but I'm still in the streets, yeah
And fuck it, dawg, I gotta eat
Bust down bust down Rollie, bust down Cuban link
All of this water, might sink
Name a young nigga that's bomin' like me
Nobody, so don't even think
I spend I spend money, talk shit all day
I smell codeine when I pee
Lovin' this, lovin' this bitch we could fuck all day 
But we don't even speak
Lovin' this beat, I could rap all day 
Fuck it, I'll do it sixteen
Hittin' my hittin' my target, I'm shootin' with aim
Got a K with a beam
Niggas fa√ßade, it's not what you think 
My bitch brown, but her pussy pink
She so thirsty, she wanna link
This life fast, so don't even blink
Get off the get off the boat, you not on my team
I'm movin' slow, I'm sippin' on lean
Told the ho, "No," she's thinkin' I'm mean
Pray to my God, I'm just bein' me
Been broke all my life, I'm just seein' things
Don't know where I'm at, I'm off DMT
I got some I got some Marni, new Marni, I'm fly
Jump on a plane and land in Dubai
I make a crack rock jump out the pot
Thinkin' you gettin' some money? You not
Diggin' out diggin' out money, this shit 'bout to rot
Fresh out of fresh out of jail, but who got a Glock?

I'm back, kome on, kome on, kome on, kome on, hey 
Kome on, kome on, kome on, kome on, uh
Hunnids on hunnids, kome on
I'm in that motherfuckin' zone
Back in that motherfuckin' mode
Jump in the streets and I turn to a beast
Kome on, kome on, kome on, kome on, hey 
Kome on, kome on, kome on, kome on, uh
I got some killers, kome on
They gon' pop out if it's on
Fuck it, I'm gettin' them whacked
I'm in the stu' makin' songs
