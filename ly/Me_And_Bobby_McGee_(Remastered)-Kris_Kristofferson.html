		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One, two, three, four

Busted flat in Baton Rouge, headin' for the train
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down just before it rained
Took us all the way to New Orleans

I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna 
I was blowin' sad while Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time and Bobby clappin' hands
We finally sang off every song that driver knew

Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin', but it's free
Feelin' good was easy, Lord when Bobby sang the blues
Feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
 
From the coal mines of Kentucky to the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Standin' right beside me through everything I done
And every night she kept me from the cold

Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord, I let her slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope she'll find
And I'd trade all my tomorrows for a single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's next close to mine

Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin', but it's free
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, when Bobby sang the blues
Feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee

La-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la, me and Bobby McGee, yeah
La-la-la, la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la, me and Bobby McGee
