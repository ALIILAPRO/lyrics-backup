		  Cocaine and Abel
The distance from the man that I am to the man I want to be
The time it takes to realize that time is the distance I need,
But I was born impatient and I was born unkind
But I refuse to believe I have to be the same person I was born when I die.
Change is alright.
I'm not proud of all the choices I've made for a lot of my life
Following the shadow when I damn well know that behind is the light.
But I've lied to my mother
I've made people feel like hell
I refuse to believe I have to keep be cruel because I'm a coward myself
Time isn't patience
No, patience takes time
Excuses will only do good if you're waiting around to die
Everyone is born with self worth,
How easily it turns to doubt
It takes letting go of what we know we can't live without
But the blood in the water,
Is the blood of my brother
We both learned it didn't mean a thing in the end if one is thicker than the other
I've tried having faith
But I'll rot like a dove
Cause I've always been scared of loving someone just a little bit more than I'm loved.
Losing is fine.
Everything is fine.
