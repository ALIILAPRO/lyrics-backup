		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wanna feel your touch
It's burning me like an ember
Pretending is not enough
I wanna feel us together
So I'm giving in
So I'm giving in
To the trouble I'm in
So I'm giving in
To the trouble I'm in
To the trouble I'm in
You are you are 
My favorite medicine
You are you are 
You're where the edge began
You are you are 
Just one last time again
You are you are 
You are the trouble I'm in
You are the trouble I'm in
You are the trouble I'm in
You are you are 
My favorite medicine
You are you are 
You're where the edge began
You are you are 
Just one last time again
You are you are 
You are the trouble I'm in
You are the trouble I'm in
