		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  Monsieur Dan
Can I come with you 
As you both look awfully kind

Sadly he and me are through
Let me tell you what I've got in mind 
I'll sing to you my mewing charm 
Looks like you both could use a pet 
And purr my purr all night long 
I think a pussy's your best bet

Stroke that shiny coat 
Stroking is the antidote
Stroke that, it's a start 
Only for the wild at heart 
Stroke that shiny coat 
Stroking is the antidote 
Stroke that shiny coat 
Stoking's what it's all about 

My tail alone could tell you tales
It's got a life all of its own 
Watch it move just like a sail 
Sail you to the twilight zone 
I love to lap a spot cream 
And i assure you that I'm neat 
But you never know what you can expect 
When the pussy is in heat

Stroke that shiny coat 
Stroking is the antidote
Stroke that, it's a start 
Only for the wild at heart 
Stroke that shiny coat 
Stroking is the antidote
Stroke that shiny coat 
Stoking's what it's all about

I like to watch, if you don't mind 
Every sphinx knows how to pass the time
Your little love nest suits me well 
Let me show you how to cast a spell

Stroke that shiny coat 
Stroking is the antidote
Stroke that it's a start 
Only for the wild at heart 
Stroke that shiny coat 
Stroking is the antidote
Stroke that shiny coat 
Stoking's what it's all about
