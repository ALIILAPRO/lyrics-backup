		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What's the point of living honestly
I never saw it coming, I place that blame on me
When you never gave me honesty
But you never gave me honesty

So I've been waiting 
For you to say it
Just what your thinking
Don't make me sit and wait

Are you sure that you can plan this route
If life’s a hard swallow, I hope it spits you out
Never been a thing to brag about
They say you walk on water, but I know i saw you drown

We've seen our better days
And had our different ways
Of solving problems but it’s not that hard to say
If you need help from me
So much of life is free
Unless you're too distracted by the shit that's always out of reach
I've got the map and I'll take you to it
You've got the plan and I'll see you through it
I've got the map and I'll take you to it
You've got the plan and I'll see you through it

Are you sure you wanna take this route
It's getting so much harder to find ways to bail you out
Never been a thing to brag about
I know you'll drag this out
You'll drag this out

We've seen our better days
And had our different ways
Of solving problems but it’s not that hard to say
If you need help from me
So much of life is free
Unless you're too distracted by the shit that's always out of reach
You've got the map and I'll take the bullets
You've got the plan and I'll see you through it
You've got the map and I'll take the bullets
You've got the plan and I'll see you through it

It's too late I can’t bail you out
It's too late I can’t bail you out
You sure you wanna take this route
I can't save you now
