		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Man, look at you, been walking in here
Looking all pretty and angry and mean and good (haha)
Now I know you didn't get your hair done
So you could just sit down and just sit still
Hey, we tryna have a good time tonight, let's go baby!

It's my birthday
(No, it's not)
But I still look good though
(Hot comb hot)
I bet you want an autograph
For you and your friends
Gotta do it in the penthouse
That's where I keep my pen

What you can't dance, ain't got rhythm?
What you got a man? I don't see you with him
Put your phone down, let's get it
Forget your Instagram and your Twitter
Got me like whoa, wait a minute
You need to take a minute
Loosen them shoulders up
Pour it up, let's work

Throw some perm on your attitude
Girl, you gotta relax (ooh)
Let me show you what you got to do
You gotta lay it back
Matter of fact, band, show her how to lay it back!
Show her how to lay it back
Show her how to lay it back
Ow, show her how to lay it back
Alright!

Come on baby, I love you
(No you don't)
You never know, I might though
Can't say I won't, ah
There's that smile I'm looking for
Was that so hard?
If you ever need to smile again girl, take my card

Razzle-dazzle, never gon' stop
What you want is what I got
You wanna get down? You gotta get up
Don't be stingy with your big ol' butt
You got a booty like whoa, wait a minute!
I'm just playing with you
Loosen them shoulders up
Pour it up, let's work

Throw some perm on your attitude
Girl, you gotta relax (ooh)
Let me show you what you got to do
You gotta lay it back
Matter of fact, band, show her how to lay it back!
Show her how to lay it back
Show her how to lay it back
Ow, show her how to lay it back
Alright!

Hey, now you got it baby
You tryna have some fun tonight
You just gotta follow these simple instructions, you ready?

You need to activate your sexy (activate your sexy)
Silky, smooth and snap (silky, smooth and snap)
Now lean with it (lean), throw a lil' sheen in it (sheen)
Then pat, pat, pat 'til it's flat
One more time, you need to activate your sexy (activate your sexy)
Silky, smooth and snap (silky, smooth and snap)
Now lean with it (lean), throw a lil' sheen in it (sheen)
Then pat, pat, pat 'til it's flat

I'll sing it again
Throw some perm on your attitude
Girl, you gotta relax
(Ooh)
Ooh, let me show you what you got to do
You gotta lay it back
Matter of fact, band, show her how to lay it back!
Show her how to lay it back
Show her how to lay it back, now
Ow, show her how to lay it back right now
Alright!
