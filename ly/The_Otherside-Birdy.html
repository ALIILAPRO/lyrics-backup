		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Autumn days, the doors you face
They're never gone, you never cry
But if your bridge ever falls, if it does
If it does, I'll catch you babe, I will

Autumn fires that blaze and burn
The shadow days, the red, the brown
They let you fall, they let you down
Let you down, that's the way I am

Before they're gone
You know they won't stay long

We could be weightless
Like birds in the night
Wherever we go
Set the world on fire
We could be the darkness
Breaking across the sky
If I lose you on the border line
I'll see you on the other side

Autumn days, the doors you face
They're never gone, you never cry
But if your bridge ever falls, if it does
If it does, I'll catch you babe, I will

Autumn fires that blaze and burn
The shadow days, the red, the brown
They let you fall, they let you down
Let you down, that's the way I am

Before they're gone
You know they won't stay long

We could be weightless
Like birds in the night
Wherever we go
Set the world on fire
We could be the darkness
Breaking across the sky
And if I lose you on the border line
I'll see you on the other side

On the other side
On the other side
The other side

We could be weightless
Like birds in the night
Wherever we go
Set the world on fire

We could be weightless
Like birds in the night
Wherever we go
Set the world on fire
We could be the darkness
Breaking across the sky
And if I lose you on the border line
I'll see you on the other side

On the other side

Autumn days, the doors you face
They're never gone, you never cry
But if your bridge ever falls, if it does
If it does, I'll catch you babe, I will
