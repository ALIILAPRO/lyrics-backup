		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Something has to change,
Something has to give.
I could rearrange my mind
And what I did.

If I were to choose,
Either way I lose.
I could be alone
Or be alone with you.

Empty space
To fill an empty place.
Everything I see
Is meaningless to me.
If it's how you feel,
Then it's real.

Was I wrong 
To just go on and on?
You never knew that I was gone.
What does that say of me?
You never thought that I
Only needed you just for a little while.

Empty space
To fill the empty place.
Everything I see is meaningless to me.
You make me tired,
Life wants to live,
You just want to watch it.
