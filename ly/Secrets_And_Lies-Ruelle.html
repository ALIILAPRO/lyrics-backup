		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  [Verse 1]
You got a cold, cold heart
Do you feel at all?
You build a house of cards
But it's gonna fall

[Pre-Chorus]
You think I don't see who you really are
I've got news coming
I've seen it all from the start

[Chorus]
I know all your secrets
I know all your lies
I know where you keep 'em
Buried deep inside
No, you can't hide your secrets and lies
Secrets and lies

[Verse 2]
Wish on your lucky stars
'Cause it's all you got
Won't get you very far
When the music stops

[Pre-Chorus]
You think I don't see who you really are
I've got news coming
I've seen it all from the start
 

[Chorus]
I know all your secrets
I know all your lies
I know where you keep 'em
Buried deep inside
No, you can't hide your secrets and lies
Your secrets and lies
Your secrets and lies
Your secrets and lies

[Outro]
You got a cold, cold heart
You build a house of cards
I know all your secrets
I know all your lies
I know where you keep 'em
Buried deep inside
No, you can't hide your secrets and lies
