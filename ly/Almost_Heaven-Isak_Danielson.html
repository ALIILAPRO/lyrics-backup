		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's an angel in the window
On a West Virginia church door swinging open
And he's pointing to the exit sign
Said, you'll never walk on water
If you wait until the river's frozen over
In the Shenandoah summer
	
Well, it was almost heaven
Choirs singing in robes of white
Almost heaven
Lovers laying side by side but
When we reach forever
Will there be a place where you and I may find home?

So I keep a candle burning
And I pray to see that Saint I knew for certain
But it's just my own reflection now
And that silhouette in the window
Is the shape of someone I don't quite remember
Dancing in the fire

Well, it was almost heaven
Choirs singing in robes of white
Almost heaven
Lovers laying side by side but
When we reach forever
Will there be a place where you and I may find home?
In heaven

I'll make a room for you
If you stay, you'll rise on me now
Lover, you can lean on me
Love, I can lift you higher
Said, I'm making a room for you
Will you keep your eyes on me now?
Lover, lean on me
Love, I can lift you higher
Oh, I can lift you higher, oh

And it was almost heaven 
Oh, it was almost heaven
Oh, when we reach forever
Will there be a place where you and I may find home?
In heaven
Make our home in heaven
