		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's time to sleep, it's time to leave
To loose the binds, to lose a mind
Time to exhale, to drink the green sea
To drift upon the scarlet breeze

It's time, it's time, it's time to begin
It's time, it's time
It's time to just leave

Let's raise up our hands in prayer
Walk barefoot upon this carpet of air
Na na, na na, na na na na na na
Na na, na na, na na na na na na
Let's string up the man
At the top of the stairs
Let's piss on the city
That's burning down there

Jim, Jim, Jim, oh Jim
Jim, Jim, it's time to begin
Ride your mechanical beast to heaven
Ride your beautiful bitch to the ultimate sin
Na na, na na, na na na na na na
Na na, na na, na na na na na na

Don't cry, sweet plum, no regrets
We will strangle you up in the loft

These methedrine teeth are piled
Up in the sink and your mother is screaming
To finish him off

Now heaven will come, we will rise again
Yeah heaven will come, we will win
It's 200 miles to the place where we begin
Yeah heaven will come, we will win
