		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I drop a deuce
Getting loose
Yea im high of all that
You looking spooked from the truth
Yea you lying on that ok
This is just anotha fucking face
You see me dying while you saying grace
The devil here whats he near
Tell em we the peers
That lock it down from the ground all this sacred ground
The devil near tell me here if you love the sound
Of all the screams and the shouts as they fucking drown

Turn insane
Keep it steady I might blow now
I'm to blame
I keep lacking I can't slow down
To the limits we will finish what we start
Fuck a digit do this shit with my hearth

We do not play now
Fading away
Middle of the day
I need to lay down
Need to be saved
Fuck am I saying
I need to stay around
Fading away
Middle of the day
I need to lay down
Just need to stay now
