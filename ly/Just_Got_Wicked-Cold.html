		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can taste your innocence
Young and sweet like mother made you
Everything frozen in ice
These motherfuckers just got wicked
Well I can't explain this little man
Taken over
Can't explain the way that I feel

Everyone got twisted up
Everyone got behind my back and broke it
'Cause it's my world
Everyone got twisted up
All your friends got behind my back
And broke it
'Cause it's my world

1, 2, 3 here I come with the wicked

Well I can't explain this little man
Taken over
Can't explain the way that I feel

You are the love I never found
