		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I, I don't have a whole lot of time
Um, okay, I'm a former employee of Area 51
I, I was let go on a medical discharge about a week ago and, and
I've kind of been running across the country
Damn, I don't know where to start, they're
They're gonna, um, they'll triangulate on this position really really soon

Okay, um, um, okay
What we're thinking of as, as aliens
They're extradimensional beings
That, an earlier precursor of the, um, space program they made contact with
They are not what they claim to be
Uh, they've infiltrated a, a lot of aspects of, of, of the military establishment
Particularly the Area 51

The disasters that are coming, they, the military
I'm sorry, the government knows about them
And there's a lot of safe areas in this world that they could begin moving
The population to now, they are not
They want those major population centers wiped out so that the few
That are left will be more easily controllable
