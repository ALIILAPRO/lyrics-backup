		  (Feel you on this one, Oso)

This K2 got me started
I'm so rude, I don't wanna argue
'Cause it could turn out very badly, girl, right now
Very badly, yeah, right now (D-Roc, oh)

Match my cool, I'll treat you badly, yeah, bad choice
I, I, I knew you was a bad start
But I went for the green anyway, good choice
She wanna party, fuck all night long (hey, hey, hey)
She wan' me fuck her with the lights on (oh)
On the bottom of them blicks, we got green lights on (okay, okay)
So better not come inside this slime zone, oh yeah

I stay with you, cuttin' up in the coupe
Seen your shit, you been out there vibin', I been poppin' my cool
Bitch, make me pull up on you
Already know how I do
Pull up, young baller, I shoot
At anyone, even you, okay
I'm slime
I put that on Bird 'nem grave
Tell me straight, I might leave dead, yeah
Oh my
Don't mind nothing that I say
I might be high anyway, oh

Since she takin' my soul
Now this bitch, she gotta go
I'm a man, I need control
Feelin' like I'm dying slow
And she don't even seem to know

You match my cool, I'll treat you badly, yeah, bad choice
I, I, I knew you was a bad start
But I went for the green anyway, good choice
She wanna party, fuck all night long (hey, hey, hey)
She wan' me fuck her with the lights on (oh)
On the bottom of them blicks, we got green lights on (okay, okay)
So better not come inside this slime zone, yeah
