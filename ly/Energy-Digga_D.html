		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Too much fake niggas, that's why I hate niggas
Coming around with their bad energy, fuck off, man (X10)
Leave me alone
2023, blud (HARGO Production)
Trust me, yo
Bap, bap, bap
Bap, bap, bap
Yo
I gotta protect my energy (bap, bap)
Too much jealousy, I see a friend turn enemy
Yo, look (boom)

I gotta protect my energy (bap, bap, bap)
Too much jealousy, I see a friend turn enemy (grrr)
Please don't ruin my energy (bap)
I heard it, why you keep telling me? (why?)
I gotta protect my energy
Can't rap about beef
Or the streets
So they rap about (Nashville)

On the back of the bike, Beverly
Jumped off swinging my choppa, NLE
I'm on the verge to purge, especially when they keep testing me
Gotta protect my energy
My friends ain't there mentally (nope)
Don't ask me questions, respectfully (yeah)
'Cause I won't answer sensibly
I just wanna murder senselessly
Armed heavily, shoot since secondary, do it professionally
Kill confirmed, don't message me
You wanna see these results, keep testing me (bap, bap, bap)
I gotta protect my energy
She for the streets, sesame
She wanna swallow my seed and have sex with me (yeah)
He got shot on his (woi, woi)
Now he can't breed like he had a vasectomy

I gotta protect my energy (bap, bap, bap)
Too much jealousy, I see a friend turn enemy (grrr)
Please don't ruin my energy (bap)
I heard it, why you keep telling me? (why?)
I gotta protect my energy
Can't rap about beef
Or the streets
So they rap about (Nashville)
I gotta protect my energy (bap, bap, bap)
Too much jealousy, I see a friend turn enemy (grrr)
Please don't ruin my energy (bap)
I heard it, why you keep telling me? (why?)
I gotta protect my energy
Can't rap about beef
Or the streets
So they rap about (Nashville)

I still think about Drilla 'cah that was my nigga and all of us warring his brothers
I got a strong influence on others, they sayin' I brought back colors
When I look back, all of us stressed our mothers, in prison for five cold summers
Mum ain't dumb, she's clued up, know what my crew does when we go steppin' with cutters
Who knows if God still fucks with me, all of the fuckery, some of it troubles me
All of the things that I'm going through currently, I just need someone to show love and cuddle me
Dead or in jail, man been there six times, I'm tryna avoid the other one
I bought another gun, dodging the Babylon, I know I'm troublesome, I'm finna double one

I gotta protect my energy (bap, bap, bap)
Too much jealousy, I see a friend turn enemy (grrr)
Please don't ruin my energy (bap)
I heard it, why you keep telling me? (why?)
I gotta protect my energy
Can't rap about beef
Or the streets
So they rap about (Nashville)

I gotta protect my energy (bap, bap, bap)
Too much jealousy, I see a friend turn enemy (grrr)
Please don't ruin my energy (bap)
I heard it, why you keep telling me? (why?)
I gotta protect my energy
Can't rap about beef
Or the streets
So they rap about (Nashville)
