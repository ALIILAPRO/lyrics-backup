		  (I want my, I want my MTV)
(I want my, I want my MTV)
(I want my, I want my MTV)
(I want my, I want my MTV)

Now look at them yo-yos, that's the way you do it
You play the guitar on the MTV
That ain't workin', that's the way you do it
Money for nothin' and your chicks for free
 
Now that ain't workin', that's the way you do it
Lemme tell ya, them guys ain't dumb
Maybe get a blister on your little finger
Maybe get a blister on your thumb
 
We got to install microwave ovens, custom kitchen deliveries
We got to move these refrigerators, we got to move these color TVs
 
See the little faggot with the earring and the make up 
Yeah, buddy, that's his own hair 
That little faggot got his own jet airplane
That little faggot, he's a millionaire
 
We got to install microwave ovens, custom kitchen deliveries
We got to move these refrigerators, we gotta move these color TVs
 
We got to install microwave ovens, custom kitchen deliveries
We got to move these refrigerators, we got to move these color TVs
Looky here, look out
 
I shoulda learned to play the guitar 
I shoulda learned to play them drums
Look at that mama, she got it stickin' in the camera man
We could have some
 
And he's up there, what's that?
Hawaiian noises?
Bangin' on the bongos like a chimpanzee 
That ain't workin', that's the way you do it
Get your money for nothin', get your chicks for free
 
We got to install microwave ovens, custom kitchen deliveries
We got to move these refrigerators, we gotta move these color TVs
 
Listen here
Now that ain't workin' that's the way you do it 
You play the guitar on the MTV 
That ain't workin', that's the way you do it
Money for nothin' and your chicks for free
Money for nothin', chicks for free
Get your money for nothin' and your chicks for free
Ooh, money for nothin', chicks for free
Money for nothin', chicks for free (money, money, money)
Money for nothin', chicks for free
Get your money for nothin', get your chicks for free
Get your money for nothin' and the chicks for free
Get your money for nothin' and the chicks for free

Look at that, look at that
Get your money for nothin' (I want my, I want my)
Chicks for free (I want my MTV)
Money for nothin', chicks for free (I want my, I want my, I want my MTV)
Get your money for nothin' (I want my, I want my)
And the chicks for free (I want my MTV)
Get your money for nothin' (I want my, I want my)
And the chicks for free (I want my MTV)
Easy, easy money for nothin' (I want my, I want my)
Easy, easy chicks for free (I want my MTV)
Easy, easy money for nothin' (I want my, I want my)
Chicks for free (I want my MTV)
That ain't workin'

Money for nothing, chicks for free
Money for nothing, chicks for free
