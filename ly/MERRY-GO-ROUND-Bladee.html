		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  (Three star)
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Go, go
Go around
Merry-go-round
It's all in my head, got imaginary friends
I'm stuck in a trance
I can only dance
Castles made of cards and I watch it go down

Merry-go-round
Merry-go-round
Merry-go-round
Merry-go-round (in the)
Merry-go-round
Merry-go-round
Merry-go-round (in the)
Merry-go-round
 
Time will stand still
Wish you dance, doing ballet
I come in, open up and I fall in
It's like silk, in the wind, flowers swaying
In the rain, in perfect union
It's like love, it's just like in a fairy tale
Not enough, it's just not true enough
Catch a breath, I can't even breathe, baby
Feels so fresh, just one and only one
 
Go around, go
Merry-go-round
It's all in my head, got imaginary friends
I'm stuck in a trance
I can only dance
Castles made of cards and I watch it go down

Merry-go-round
Merry-go-round (merry-go-round)
Merry-go-round
Merry-go-round (merry-go-round)
Merry-go-round
Merry-go-round (merry-go-round)
Merry-go-round
Merry-go-round (merry-go-round)

Merry-go-round
Merry-go-round
Merry-go-round
Merry-go-round (go, go)
Merry-go-round (go, go)
Merry-go-round (go, go)
Merry-go-round
(Go, go, go)
