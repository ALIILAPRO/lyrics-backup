		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't wanna fall
I just wanna rise
I don't wanna go
Wanna feel alright
I don't wanna crawl
I just wanna ride
I've been on my own
Working every night
I don't wanna fall
I just wanna rise
I don't wanna go
Wanna feel alright
I don't wanna crawl
I just wanna ride
I've been on my own
Working every night
I don't wanna go
I just wanna ride in the night
I been on my own till I fell of the sky
Now ride with me, please do it and believe
I don't wanna die today
Seek the cold on my black sleeve
Chillin' in the woods no soul
Will keep so close to this dream
Will I ever felt healed
My body means nothing
Graindead till I bleed
My heart is a rock from a cosmic void frost
I don't wanna fall
I just wanna rise
I don't wanna go
Wanna feel alright
I don't wanna crawl
I just wanna ride
I've been on my own
Working every night
I don't wanna fall
I just wanna rise
I don't wanna go
Wanna feel alright
I don't wanna crawl
I just wanna ride
I've been on my own
Working every night
Nothing to say I
Am on the edge now
I wanna feel right
I wanna feel right
I don't wanna fall now
Just to be fair cause
I'm on the way now
I'm on the way now
Nothing to say I
Am on the edge now
I wanna feel right
I wanna feel right
Don't wanna fall down
Don't wanna seem like
I'm on the way out
I'm on the way out
