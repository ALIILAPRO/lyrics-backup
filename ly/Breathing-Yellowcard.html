		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Eyes are feeling heavy
But they never seem to close
The fan blades on the ceiling spin
But the air is never cold
And even though you're next to me
I still feel so alone
I just can't give you anything
For you to call your own

And I can feel you breathing
And it's keeping me awake
Can you feel it beating?
My heart sinking like a weight

Something I've been keeping locked away
Behind my lips
I can feel it breaking free
With each and every kiss
I couldn't bear to hurt you
But it's all so different now
Things that I was sure of
They have filled me up with doubt

And I can feel you breathing
And it's keeping me awake
Can you feel it beating?
My heart sinking like a weight

I can feel you breathing
It's keeping me awake
Could you stop my heart?
It's always beating
Sinking like a weight

How am I suppose to feel about the things I've done
I don't know if I should stay or turn around and run
I know that I hurt you
Things will never be the same
The only love I ever knew, I threw it all away

And I can feel you breathing
And it's keeping me awake
Can you feel it beating?
My heart sinking like a weight

I can feel you breathing
It's keeping me awake
Could you stop my heart?
It's always breathing
Sinking like a weight
