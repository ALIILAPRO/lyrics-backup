		  Na na na (Baby)
Na na na (You got that look on your face)
Na na na (Like you want to go all night)
Na na (And I like that), whoa, whoa

For as long as you're willin', girl
Want you to know that I'm willin' too
And where you want me to go, girl
I'll be willin' to go there for you

If you want me to take my time
Then I'll be willin' to spend the night
All you got to say is, Please stay, Joe
And I'll be stayin' as long as you're sayin'

Now if you want me to make your love come
I'll be willin' to do anything
And even if you want me to kiss places
Then I'll be willin' to make you scream

Said I'm down for whatever you say
Now all you got to do is speak your mind
Want me here Monday to Monday
Then baby girl, it's fine as long as you're screamin' more

More and more (More, more)
More and more (Then after that you want)
More and more (Then after that)

Then we'll be goin' (From the bedroom to the kitchen, babe)
Then we'll be goin' (From the kitchen to the dinin' room)
And straight to the (Baby, straight to the the livin' room)

I'll be takin' you up (Takin' you up the stairs, babe)

As long as you're screamin' for me, say you'll give me more
