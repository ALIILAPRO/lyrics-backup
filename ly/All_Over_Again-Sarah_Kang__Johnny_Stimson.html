		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What if I'd never met you?
I wonder what I'd be up to
Where would I be and with what kind of view?
What if there are other me's
Somewhere out in the galaxy?
I let myself daydream

'Cause maybe there's some other universe
I'd put it all in reverse

If only I could, I would turn back the clock
To before I ever knew you and then
I'd still end up at that same old restaurant
And fall for you all over again
All over again

(Yeah)

You and I were magnetized
Connected by the great divine
Tiny electrons always intertwined
And if I had a hundred million lives
With infinitely different storylines
It would be you every time

If only I could, I would turn back the clock
To before I ever knew you and then
I'd still end up at that same old restaurant
And fall for you all over again
All over again

(And again and again)
And I've fallen again

Maybe there's some other universe
But I'd still go after you first

If only I could, I would turn back the clock
To before I was yours and then
I'd (you'd) put on that same white dress and walk to you (me)
To say yes all over again
I'd fall for you all over again
