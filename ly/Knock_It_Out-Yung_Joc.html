		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  [Chorus: x2]
Yea, I been there
I done that
Knock the pussy out, now she running back
So I knock the pussy out
Knock it out, knock it out
I knock the pussy out
Knock it out, knock it out

First thing first, I likin' all kinda hoes
Some go to school, some dance with no clothes
Mama name me Joc 'cause I do the damn thing
When I throw the dick they come back like boomerangs
Beat the pussy up like a ole beat machine
Oop, there it is, bring a friend, tag team
Then I beat 'em up like the woofers in my vert
I give her Tylenol 'cause she say her jaws hurt
Need a chick like Trina, make her dreams come true
Baby when I cum, guarantee you cum too
And like big 6, the dick hypnotize minds
I put that on my mama baby if you think I'm lyin'

[Bridge]
Lil mama I'ma (beat it up)
All night I'ma (beat it up)
That mouth, I'ma (beat it up)
That back, I'ma (beat it up)
That's right I've

[Chorus: x2]

1 + 1, then that equals two
Bitches on deck, one for me and one for you
Just the way I like, straight A-Town
Meet me in the room, guarantee it go down
Yea, your baby daddy mad, you woulda spilled the beans
Don't get mad 'cause she on my drill team
I turn virgins into sex fiends
I turn nightmares into wet dreams
Make a jookbox wet, make her think she on her cycle
Hit her from the back, then I grab her by the micros
Make her touch her toes til her knees turn weak
Neighbors complain 'cause they say they can't sleep

[Bridge]

[Chorus: x2]

When it's time for round three, strap on another glove
T.K.O, now the hoe all in love
She love to call me Tyson when I nibble on her ear
I hit her wit a combo, now she call me Holyfield
I know it sound vulgar but that's the way she like it
Got the worlds biggest (shhh), don't matter, just don't bite it
No I'm not conceited but see I keep it trill
Playboys shout it, Mr Black and decradrill
Yea your girl say my name, please don't take offense
Have 'em bent like this, suckin' on some gangsta shit
I don't think it's worth it if you really want the truth
Cause at this phrase in time she givin' brain in the houpe

[Bridge]

[Chorus: x2]

[Bridge: x2]
