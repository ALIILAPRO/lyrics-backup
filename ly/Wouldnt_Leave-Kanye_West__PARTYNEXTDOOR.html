		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't feel that she's mine enough
God, I feel I couldn't have you windin' up
Butterfly in my wrist
You make pretty women out of my skin
And I don't feel like
And I know you wouldn't leave

They said, "Build your own" I said, "How, Sway?"
I said, "Slavery a choice," they said, "How, Ye?"
Just imagine if they caught me on a wild day
Now I'm on fifty blogs gettin' fifty calls
My wife callin', screamin', say, "We 'bout to lose it all"
Had to calm her down 'cause she couldn't breathe
Told her she could leave me now
But she wouldn't leave

And I know you wouldn't leave

And I sometimes wish
We doin' such things
We could wait longer than this
Yes you know, you're one of these
We can run through with the top chopped, yeah
And the sundress down, ooh

And I know you wouldn't leave

Oh, don't bring that up, that's gon' get me sentimental
You know I'm sensitive, I got a gentle mental
Every time somethin' happen, they want me sent to mental
We had an incident but I cover incidentals
You want me working on my messaging
When I'm thinkin' like George Jetson but sounding like George Jefferson
Then they questioning my methods then
If you tweakin' out on my texts again then I don't get reception here
I got the mind state to take us past the stratosphere
I use the same attitude that done got us here
I live for now, I don't know what happen after here
I live for now, I don't know what happen after here
Plus, what was meant to be was meant to be
Even if, publicly, I lack the empathy
I ain't finna talk about it, 'nother four centuries
One and one is two but me and you, that's infinity (and I know you wouldn't leave)

I don't feel that she's mine enough
God, I feel I couldn't have you windin' up (why?)
Butterfly in my wrist
You make pretty women out of my skin (out of my skin)
And I don't feel like (uh)
And I know you wouldn't leave (love me or hate me)

For any guy that ever fucked up (love me or hate me)
Ever embarrassed they girl (love me or hate me)
Ever embarrassed they wife (gone when you miss me)
She told you not to do that shit (oh)
She told you you's gon' fuck the money up
But you ain't wanna listen, did you?
Keep that same energy
Keep that same energy
Now you testing her loyalty
This what they mean when they say, "For better or for worse", huh?
For every down female that stuck with they dude
Through the best times, through the worst times
This for you
And I know you wouldn't leave
