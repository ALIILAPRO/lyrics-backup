		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
Whoa, yeah, yeah
Yeah

It's been over for a year or so
I should've left a couple tears ago
And even when I'm with you, I still feel alone
Got me down on my knees

Heart is froze, I don't feel nothing
Drinkin' and drugs just to feel somethin'
Stranger outside, can you let me in?
Can you love me back, please?

Can the past stop repeating?
Can you let me down easy?

You're selfish, selfish, how do you love?
Too much, too much, never enough
You're a liar, liar, who can I trust?
I love you, you love you more
Selfish, selfish, how do you love?
Too much, too much, never enough
You're a liar, liar, who can I trust?
I love you, you love you more

Sometimes I wanna call, but I got shit to do
I'm tryin' to forget, but then I'm missin' you
Addicted to yourself, you gotta read the room
'Cause ain't nobody watchin' but you think they do (think they do)

Yeah, tell me what you want from me
Can you love me back please? (Love me back)
Tell me what you want from me (tell me what you want for me)
Can you love me back, you love me back, please?

You're selfish, selfish, how do you love?
Too much, too much, never enough
You're a liar, liar, who can I trust?
I love you, you love you more
Selfish, selfish, how do you love?
Too much, too much, never enough
You're a liar, liar, who can I trust?
I love you, you love you more

Tell me what you want from me
Can you love me back please?
Tell me what you want from me, ayy, ooh
Tell me what you want from me
Can you love me back please? (Can you love me back?)
Tell me what you want from me
Can you love me back, you love me back, please? (Ooh)

You're selfish, selfish, how do you love?
Too much, too much, never enough
You're a liar, liar, who can I trust?
I love you, you love you more
Selfish, selfish, how do you love?
Too much, too much, never enough
You're a liar, liar, who can I trust?
I love you, you love you more

Tell me what you want from me
Can you love me back please?
Tell me what you want from me
I love you, you love you more
