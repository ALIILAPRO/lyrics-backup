		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fare thee well so long
Hate to say goodbye to you
I can tell you're gone
By the way I'm missing you
Don't you realize you're everything to me?

Got my heart out in my hand and don't you know it?
Something deep inside's come over me
I'm gonna sacrifice my soul just to show it
Can you try to tell me what it means?

Couldn't this be love? Love?
Coming over me
Coming over me
Couldn't this be love?

When you're gone, I found
A part of me is there with you
Are you still all mine?
I hope you're telling me the truth
'Cause the saddest thing's when love goes away

Got my heart out in my hand and don't you know it?
Something deep inside's come over me
I'm gonna sacrifice my soul just to show it
Can you try to tell me what it means?

Couldn't this be love? Love?
Coming over me
Coming over me
Couldn't this be love?
Fare thee well

Got my heart out in my hand and don't you know it?
Something deep inside's come over me
I'm gonna sacrifice my soul just to show it
Can you try to tell me what it means?

Couldn't this be love? Love?
Coming over me
Coming over me
Couldn't this be love?

Fare thee well so long
Hate to say goodbye to you
I can tell you're gone
By the way I'm missing you
Don't you realize you're everything to me?
Don't you realize you're everything to me?
