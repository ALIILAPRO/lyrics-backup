		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't feel you
I can't feel you
I can't hear you
I can't speak 'cause
Love don't stink
Love don't stink
Love don't stink like that cottage cheese
And I hear my God in a coma freeze
I hear my God in a coma freeze
Lonely, lonely

I can't feel you
I can't feel you
I can't hear you
I can't speak
'Cause love don't stink
Love don't stink
Love don't stink like that cottage cheese
And I hear my God in a coma freeze
I hear my God in a coma freeze
Lonely
Lonely
Lonely, lonely like you

Thank you
