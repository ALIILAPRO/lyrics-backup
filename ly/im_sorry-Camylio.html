		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I drove around past your place last night
Playlist of songs that I know you'd like
And I finally cut my hair, just like you always said
Honestly, I hate it, I'm just hoping you'll text me back
When I say, "I hope you're doing okay"

And I'm sorry that every tear you cry is all my fault
That I'm the reason you can't fall in love
I'm still tryna get my shit together
Honestly, you deserve better

So, I'll go back to just being your friend
Unsay all the things already said
Like I loved you then and I'll love you forever
But honestly, you deserve better

We haven't talked since last Halloween
I hate that I wasn't myself, I mean
That I wish you came alone, your date would just go home
'Cause I could love you better, but I didn't get a chance
To stop and say, "I miss you every day"

And I'm sorry that every tear you cry is all my fault
That I'm the reason you can't fall in love
I'm still tryna get my shit together
Honestly, you deserve better

So, I'll go back to just being your friend
Unsay all the things already said
Like I loved you then and I'll love you forever
But honestly, you deserve better

Now I'm just another body in the room
And I might as well be furniture to you
'Cause you left me behind the day you moved on

And I'm sorry that every tear you cry is all my fault
That I'm the reason you can't fall in love
I'm still tryna get my shit together
But honestly, you deserve better
