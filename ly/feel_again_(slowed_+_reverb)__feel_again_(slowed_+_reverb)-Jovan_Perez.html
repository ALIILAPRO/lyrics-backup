		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been waiting for something
Something I can't ignore
Maybe someone I've been waiting for
To bring me back to life one more time
I've been praying for another chance
To make me feel again
I've been sitting, reminisicing of a better day
Tryna reawake
Coast to coast
I'm doing the most for a second chance
Just to feel again
Baby I try and try a thousand times
And I know why
When you left me
Oh you left behind every moment
Back when you said we
Would grow old on a porch in the golden sun
It's not over
Said it's not over
As I shattered every memory across the floor
When you left
I've been waiting for something
Something to take me me back
And here you are
A star I wished on, when I was young
I wanna, I wanna remember how it felt when I first played the song
That made me melt, away away
For days and days
Coast to coast
I'm doing the most for a second chance
Just to feel again
Baby I try and try a thousand times
But I, oh I
When you left me
Oh you left behind every moment
Back when you said we
Would grow old on a porch in the golden sun
It's not over
Said it's not over
As I shattered every memory across the floor
When you left
Would grow old on a porch in the golden
You used to make me feel
You used to make me feel
