		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  from the dust hundred forty three one
fell in the circle of the world like a flower bud
a million marbled mouths all blinking
moon of milky briar blooms sleeping

blithy flies swarm a swift pull trigger
lift me off the ledge, lick the sticky liquor
don’t let him in, don’t let them call your number
won’t you hold my hand as i go under

ooh come a little closer
ooh same as the last
ooh megalomaniac
cut my tongue, better watch your back

eye to thigh as he sharpens his blade
thick sweat, sick salt, lead belly aches
i don’t know what i’ve been drinking
dripping dread as all the lights start screaming

seven inch steel bolt fed to the head
now is then and i am now bound to forget
the devil wears a cotton dress over his gun
jagged mumbles wispy warbles blushing in the sun
