		  NAKED 

Yesterday 
Another one 
At what point did we become
Nothing less 
Than another one 
Take out the bikes to nowhere 
Take us half the night to go there 
There's something else
Going on 
But where else would we belong 
Nothing here 
All along 
I laughed my stitches open 
Counting places we had woken 

We're just dead leaves at the bottom of a drained swimming pool 
And all we know are these four walls 
Why is the dark so dazzling

Tangerine 
Break of dawn 
There's some things worth holding on
So take a piece
Before it's gone
We waited at the square for 
Someone to turn up to care for 

We're just dead leaves at the bottom of a drained swimming pool 
And all we know 
Are these four walls 
Why is the dark so dazzling
Like a has been 
I wore out 
I wore off 
Like a local anaesthetic 
How pathetic 
You forget it 
When the dark can be this dazzling

But if they drag your hands
Out of the water
Just like they ought to do 
What if we never land 
One way wherever 
To be together soon 
But if they drag me down 
Out of the heavens 
Just like they never should 
What if we're finally found
Out on a slow day 
I knew we always could 
I knew we always could 
I knew we always could 
I knew we always could 
I knew we always could
