		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let's go!

That's it, where to go?
Should I tell you where I want to go?
We'll die there be motherfucking there broad away to be
All wilted way, I'll show you the place where I want to die
We're gonna die in pain
Don't hurt my eyes, I feel the flame

Starts slowly now (starts slowly now)
Words rising high (words rising high)
We'll pay you Bodom beach terror

Late night you party until it's light
While pointing at the sky
Wash your hands in the lake of your blood
Just before you die

Bodom beach terror!

Go go!
To the place where you really want to be, want to go
From the dark away to hit lights, to hit that human light
One minute shape to hit time where you gonna go
I bet you're gonna hit ya to tear you down to a place you've never seen

Late night you party until it's light
While pointing at the sky
Wash your hands in the lake of your blood
Just before you die

Bodom beach terror!
