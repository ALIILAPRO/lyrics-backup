		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Burn through, it burn through it
I'm not takin' turns to it, turns to it
You know we burn through it, burn through it
We ain't takin' turns to, turns to it

Coughin' up sirens I'm firin'
Crocodile lips off your smile
Quit that fidget looks suspicious
Who dat, screw dat ain't got my digits

Fear over pride, lil' boy
Flood you can't hide, lil' boy
Face of a woman, lil' boy
Tears of a child, lil' boy

I'm rising sign of sulfur
Skeletal bell toller
Handle in each of my tentacles
I'm moonshining juice don't try me
Live to feel life beat me nothing hurts
I'm seething your smoke signals proceed me
I'm inside my TV
Where everyone but I can see me
Why are you here?

Fear over pride, lil' boy
Flood you can't hide, lil' boy
Face of a woman, lil' boy
Tears of a child, lil' boy

Burn through, it burn through it
I'm not takin' turns to it, turns to it
You know we burn through it, burn through it
We ain't takin' turns to, turns to it

You know we burn through it, burn through it
I'm not takin' turns to it, turns to it

See myself come spin through top of you
My flint lit slit that attitude
Lil' brain got confused
Choo-choo train of thought in my logic loop

Fear over pride, lil' boy
Flood you can't hide, lil' boy
Face of a woman, lil' boy
Tears of a child, lil' boy

Broken hands on all my fingers
Buckle down my knuckles like screamers
Stitch up my blown-out trench with leather streamers
I keep em hangin' from my balcony, shrivel in my sun
Warm piss showin' through his cheap slacks, this bitch is done
Open my front ragin' like I've never slept
Make him cry like a baby formula on the breath

Needle of your eye, lil' boy
River Nile wide, lil' boy
Fear over pride, lil' boy
Flood you can't hide, lil' boy
Face of a woman, lil' boy
Tears of a child, lil' boy
In a foreign land, lil' boy
Single file, lil' boy

You know we burn through it, burn through it
We ain't takin' turns to, turns to it
