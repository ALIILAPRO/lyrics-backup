		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey, woah
I don't wanna break this down to you
It's a cruel thing that we learn to do
'Cause we all gotta pay for something
We all gotta kill for nothing
Happiness has its price
Less isn't more in this business
Rapacity will be the illness
That we will learn to love

Are you worth your weight in gold?
Going once, going twice, sold
It's all about that cold hard cash, hun
Woo

Go ahead and cry shallow pools of blood
Diamond noose at your throat
Hey, woah
Hey, woah

Moral code updates three times a year
Truth that's dipped in gold's just as sincere
I'll never ask for forgiveness
I come with God as my witness
I pray He'll wash my hands
It's sad and that's true and the world hurts
Sold your soul, that's how it works
We're human after all

Are you worth your weight in gold?
Going once, going twice, sold
It's all about that cold hard cash, hun
Oh

Go ahead and cry shallow pools of blood (cash, money)
Diamond noose at your throat (cash, money)

(Hey, woah) give me that, I want that
(Hey, woah) give me that, I want that

Go ahead and cry shallow pools of blood (cash, money)
How long will it last? How long 'til you learn? (Cash, money)
'Nother stack of sins to be buried in (cash, money)
Diamond noose at your throat (cash, money)

Hey
Go ahead and cry shallow pools of blood (cash, money)
How long will it last? How long 'til you learn? (Cash, money)
'Nother stack of sins to be buried in (cash, money)
Diamond noose at your throat (cash, money)
Hey
