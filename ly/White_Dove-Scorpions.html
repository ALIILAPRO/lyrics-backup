		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A place without a name 
Under a burning sky 
There's no milk and honey here 
In the land of God 

Someone holds a sign 
It says we are human, too 
And while the sun goes down 
The world goes by 

White dove 
Fly with the wind 
Take our hope under your wings 
For the world to know 
That hope will not die 
Where the children cry 

Waves, big like a house 
They're stranded on a piece of wood 
To leave it all behind 
To start again 

But instead of a new life 
All they find is a door that's closed 
And they keep looking for 
A place called hope 

White dove 
Fly with the wind 
Take our hope under your wings 
For the world to know 
That hope will not die 
Where the children cry 

Na na 
Na na na na 
Na na na na na na na na 
Na na 
Na na na na 
Na na na na na 

Can anyone tell me why (can anyone tell me why) 
The children of the world (the children of the world) 
Have to pay the price (pay another price) 

And now your telling me 
You've seen it all before 
I know that's right but still 
It breaks my heart 

Well, the golden lamb we sent 
Makes us feel better now 
But you know it's just a drop 
In a sea of tears 

White dove 
Fly with the wind 
Take our hope under your wings 
For the world to know 
That hope will not die 
Where the children cry 

White dove 
Fly with the wind 
Take our hope under your wings 
For the world to know 
That hope will not die 
Where the children cry 

Na na 
Na na na na 
Na na na na na na na na 
Na na 
Na na na na 
Na na na na na
