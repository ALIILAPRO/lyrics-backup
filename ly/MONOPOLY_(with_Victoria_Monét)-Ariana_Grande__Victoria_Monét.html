		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah

I've been on a roll, where have you been?
Real protective with my soul, where you been?
Is your GPS even on, where you been?
Matter of fact, I don't even care where you been

Bad vibes, get off of me
Outta here with that fuckery
Treat my goals like property
Collect them like Monopoly
I probably
Won't come if there's not a fee
And if they try come stoppin' me
I swerve both ways, dichotomy

I like women and men (Yeah)
Work so fuckin' much, need a twinny, twin, twin
How you hit the club and you barely got in?
Then we hit the bank, making them investments for the win, oh

Said, I been on a roll, where have you been? (Where you been?)
Real protective with my soul, where have you been? (Where you been?)
Is your GPS even on, where have you been? (Where you been?)
Matter of fact, I don't even care where you been

Bad vibes, get off of me
Outta here with that fuckery
Treat my goals like property
Collect them like Monopoly
I probably
Won't come if there's not a fee
And if they try come stoppin' me
I show them my discography (Yeah, yeah)

I like women and men (Yeah)
Work so fuckin' much, need a twinny, twin, twin (Yeah)
You'd be straight for life if I gave you my PIN (Yeah)
Even though we gave up that 90% for the win, go

I've been on a roll, where have you been? (Where you been?)
Real protective with my soul, where have you been? (Where you been?)
Is your GPS even on, where have you been? (Where you been?)
Matter of fact, I don't even care where you been

Yeah, hell no
I don't even care where you been (Oh, yeah)
Hell no (Oh, yeah)
Said I don't even care

Remember when we made a fuckin' album off that Clicquot? (Ooh)
I never track my vocals, so shout out to Eric Vetro (I love Vetro, man)
This been buildin' up, I guess this friendship like Home Depot (Ooh)
I'm so thankful working with my best friend, she the cheat code
She the cheat code (Yeah!)

Where you at? Where you been? (Oh yeah)
Where you been? Where you at, ho? Hey (Where you been?)
Where you at? Where you been, ho? Hey (Mmm, yeah)
I don't care where you been, ho (Been)
Where you been Cletus?
Yeah, who? (What?) Clevis?
Who the fuck is Cletus?
It's from, um
Cletus? Girl
Nutty Professor
We have to wrap, 5, 6, 7, 8
Yeah
