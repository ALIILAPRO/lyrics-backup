		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ghost, ghost I know you live within me
I feel you as you fly
In thunder clouds above the city
Into one that I love

With all that was left within me
Until we tore in two
Now wings and rings and there's so many
Waiting here for you

And she was born in a bottle rocket, 1929
With wings that ringed around a socket
Right between her spine
All drenched in milk and holy water
Pouring from the sky
I know that she will live forever
She won't ever die

And she goes
And now she knows she'll never be afraid
To watch the morning paper blow
Into a hole where no one can escape
Dee, dee, dee, dee, dee, dee
Dee, dee, dee, dee, dee, dee
Dee, dee, dee, dee, dee, dee
Dee, dee, dee, dee

And one day in New York City, baby
A girl fell from the sky
From the top of a burning apartment building
Fourteen stories high
And when her spirit left her body
How it split the sun
I know that she will live forever
All goes on and on and on

And she goes
And now she knows she'll never be afraid
To watch the morning paper blow
Into a hole where no one can escape
Dee, dee, dee, dee, dee, dee
Dee, dee, dee, dee, dee, dee
Dee, dee, dee, dee, dee, dee
Dee, dee, dee, dee
