		  (Bricks, this shit finna kill these niggas)
(Go Grizz)
(Kio, Kio)

Uh, met this pretty ting, nice to meet you, mucho gusto
Sweeter than a churro, she call me papi chulo
Yeah, I'm single baby girl but how 'bout you though?
Tryna make you my number one
Tryna make you my numero uno

Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet-sweet
Sweet, sweet-sweet, sweet, sweet
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet
Sweet, sweet, sweet-sweet
Sweet, sweet-sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet

She's sexy
I'm in love with her brain, man, she's stuck on my mind
She only speaks when she has an epiphany, kinda girl you wanna fuck all the time
Ride me like I'm Ginuwine
I'll suck on her nipples, she's suckin' on mine
She told me hit it from behind, I stroke it, I pull out, I cum on her spine
Uh, I think that I found me a keeper, por favor mamacita
Let's do it like Mickey and Mallory, get you some ice to go with your tequila
I just bought a Rolex, broke it in half 'cause this one's a creeper
We're sipping liquor by the litre, pussy so good it put me in a sleeper

When I look left in the morning there's a bitch who's tryna stay (who are you?)
Did we smash or not man, I don't recognize her face (who are you?)
I don't need your talking or your weed you're tryna blaze (no)
Me and Skep linked up and now we're dancing in the rave (ahwoo)

Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet-sweet
Sweet, sweet-sweet, sweet, sweet
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet
Sweet, sweet, sweet-sweet
Sweet, sweet-sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet

Came out of the car and your bitch she said, "Hola"
I'm smoking cigars and I'm drinking Corona's 
And I met this bitch who was dressed up in rosa
I tell her, "Come here girl, you're very hermosa"
Tengo dinero, forget your mind
Come outside, step man and look at my dimes
Soft tequila, man, I'm dropping my bands
Take the weed off me, man, I'm dropping my bands
That bitch she way too fire, where the hell did I find her?
Mmm, man, it's hard to describe her, other bitches don't like her
It's 'cause she's getting all designer (yeah), mmm it's a minor
Your other man he's tired (yeah), fuck him and then climb up

Dancing
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet
It got me dancing
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet-sweet
Sweet, sweet-sweet, sweet, sweet
The money's dancing
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet
Sweet, sweet, sweet-sweet
You got me dancing
Sweet-sweet, sweet, sweet
