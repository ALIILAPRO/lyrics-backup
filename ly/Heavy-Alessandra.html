		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Say you're fine, say you're fine 
What's on your mind, on your mind 
You're a little too quiet in the passenger seat 
And another sad song's playing on repeat 

Fake as mile, fake as mile 
Just one more mile, one more mile 
You're afraid to open up thinking you look weak 
But since you won't talk, I'll go ahead and speak 

And I know it doesn't help but I'll stay 
Hiding the pain won't save you from breaking 
I don't want you to think you're up by yourself 

When life gets too heavy 
I'll take the weight if you let me
Baby, it's okay to lose control 
'Cause life can get messy 
Sometimes a little unsteady 
You don't have to do it on your own 

Turn away, turn away Tryna
Place a blame, place a blame 
On another failed exam or a sleepless night 
But I can always tell when you tell a lie 
And I know it doesn't help but I'll stay 
Hiding the pain won't save you from breaking 
I don't want you to think you're up by yourself 

When life gets too heavy I'll take the weight if you let me 
Baby, it's okay to lose control 
'Cause life can get messy 
Sometimes a little unsteady 
You don't have to do it on your own (You don't have to do it on your own Baby, no You don't have to do it on your own) 
Filling up for one until it's way to toss it It's way to toss it 
Cranking you this time up early 
We know that's it We know that's it Trying to come it up but 
I'll never leave you sad I'll never leave you sad 

Don't you know that 
Life gets too heavy I'll take the weight if you let me 
Baby it's okay to lose control 
'Cause life can get messy Sometimes a little unsteady 
You don't have to do it on your own
