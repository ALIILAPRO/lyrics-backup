		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Late night, feelin' kinda lonely
Drive home, no one's waitin' for me
I don't miss the days before I fell for you
Last time was fun but overrated
White lines, fun but then you hate it
Cruel hearts and nobody could break it
Sad but true

And honestly (what was that?)
I needed you (what was that?)
You needed me, it's crazy

Do you remember the time when we first met?
You were at a party with your ex
I said, "Hello" then I got drunk
Do you remember the time we fell in love?
Do you remember the night when you came over?
Playin' songs, layin' on my shoulder
We made out 'til the sun came up
Do you remember the time, remember the time we fell in love?

Na-na-na
Na-na-na
Na-na-na
Na-na-na

How could I ever forget layin' in your bed
Having sex all night, it's fucking with my head
Now we can never pretend that we can only be friends
We should do it again and again

And honestly (what was that?)
I needed you (what was that?)
You needed me, it's crazy

Do you remember the time when we first met?
You were at a party with your ex
I said, "Hello" then I got drunk
Do you remember the time we fell in love?
Do you remember the night when you came over?
Playin' songs, layin' on my shoulder
We made out 'til the sun came up
Do you remember the time, remember the time we fell in love?

(Na-na-na)
(Na-na-na)
Do you remember the time?
(Na-na-na)
Do you remember the time
(Na-na-na) remember the time we fell in love?
(Na-na-na) how could I ever forget layin' in your bed
(Na-na-na) having sex all night? It's fucking with my head
(Na-na-na) now we can never pretend that we can only be friends
Remember the time we fell in love?
