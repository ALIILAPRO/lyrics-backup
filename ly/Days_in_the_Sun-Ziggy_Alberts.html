		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And so I woke to the, the sun on the window of my car
And I said, I wo-, I woke to the summer on my window
And I miss you most when the sunlight filters across these empty sheets
And days in the sun, the winter cold on your cheeks
And everything we need love I can feel in my bones
On days like these and days like those

Days in the sun
Nights on the streets
And I am singing to my mother, singing to the seas
See I've been singing to my father, singing to the trees
Singing to the things that help us breathe
Days in the sun
Are all, these days are all, all, always, they are always
The best with you

And so I woke to the, the sun on the window of my car
And I said, I wo-, I woke to the winter on my window
And I miss you most when the sunlight filters across these empty sheets
And days in the sun, and Ben Howard on repeat
But everything we need love I can feel in my bones
On days like these and days like those

Days in the sun
Nights on the streets
And I am singing to my mother, singing to the seas
See I've been singing to my father, singing to the trees
Singing to the things that help us breathe
Days in the sun
Nights on the streets
And I am singing to my mother, singing to the seas
See I've been singing to my father, singing to the trees
Singing to the things that help us breathe
Days in the sun
Are all, these days are all, all, always, they are always
The best with you
