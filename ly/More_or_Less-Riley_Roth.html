		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've heard people say you and the heartbreaks
It don't break even
I guess they're right
'Cause right now I'm on the wrong side of leaving
Yeah, I know it's late
But I've been wide awake for hours
I'm the one who calls
And you're the one with all the power

I wish you would want me
Or I wouldn't need you
I wish you'd remember
Or I'd just forget
I wish you felt something
Or I just felt nothing
Wish we were forever
Or we never met

If I was stronger
If you were weaker
We'd feel the same way
Yeah baby, either
I wish you would love, love me a little more
Or I wish that I could love, love you a little less

It's like you flipped a switch
Wonder what your secret is
You make it look so easy
I walk into a bar
And baby, there you are
Acting like you don't see me
Hate that I'm the one
Who can't fall out of love
Like I should
Yeah, don't get me wrong
I'd be moving on if I could

I wish you would want me
Or I wouldn't need you
I wish you'd remember
Or I'd just forget
I wish you felt something
Or I just felt nothing
Wish we were forever
Or we never met

If I was stronger
If you were weaker
We'd feel the same way
Yeah baby, either
I wish you would love, love me a little more
Or I wish that I could love, love you a little less

I wish you would want me
I wish you'd remember
I wish you felt something
I wish we were forever

I wish you would want me
Or I wouldn't need you
I wish you'd remember (I wish you'd remember)
Or I'd just forget
I wish you felt something
Or I just felt nothing
Wish we were forever (wish we were forever)
Or we never met

If I was stronger (stronger)
If you were weaker (weaker)
We'd feel the same way
Yeah baby, either
I wish you would love, love me a little more
Or I wish that I could love, love you a little less

I wish you would love me more
I wish I could love you less
I wish you would love me more
I wish I could love you less
