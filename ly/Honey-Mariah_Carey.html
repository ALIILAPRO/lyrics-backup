		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, oh, honey got me hooked on you
I like that
Oh, oh
Come on
MC
La da da da da da da da (c'mon) da da
La da da da da da da da, la da da da da (MC)
La da da da da da da da, da da da da da
La da da da da da da da (I like that)
La da da da da, da da da da
Let's go

Oh, now you can have me
When you want me
You simply ask me to be there (uh huh)
And you're the only one
Who makes me come running
'Cause what you got
Is far beyond compare, ooh

And it's just like honey (yeah)
When your love (when your love) comes over me (comes over me)
Oh, baby, I've got a dependency
Always strung out
For another taste of your honey (ooh)

It's like honey when it washes over me
You know sugar never ever was so sweet
And I'm dying for ya
Crying for ya (crying)
I adore ya
One hit of your love affected me (yeah)
And I'm strung out on you, darling
Don't you see (every night)
Every night and day I can hardly wait
For another taste of honey (honey)

Honey, I can't describe
How good it feels inside (ooh, honey)
Honey, I can't describe
How good it feels inside

Oh, I can't be elusive with you honey (I like that)
'Cause it's blatant that I'm feeling you (yeah)
And it's too hard for me to leave abruptly
'Cause you're the only thing I wanna do

And it's just like honey
When your love (when your love) comes over me (comes over me)
Oh, baby, I've got a dependency (so addicted to ya, honey)
Always strung out
For another taste of your honey (honey)

It's like honey when it washes over me
You know sugar never ever was so sweet
And I'm dying for ya
Crying for ya
I adore ya 
One hit of your love addicted me (I need you babe)
And I'm strung out on you, darling (ooh, your love addicted me)
Don't you see (I can't wait)
Every night and day I can hardly wait (for another)
For another taste of honey (Baby, I can hardly wait)

Harlem world we won't stop for Mariah, you're on fire
Harlem world we won't stop, so Mariah, take us higher
Harlem world we won't stop, for Mariah, you're on fire
Harlem world we won't stop, so Mariah, take us higher
Break it down

Every little thing you do
Now, what we gonna do right here
Is we gonna smooth it out
(Oh, oh, honey got me hooked on you)
MC, and she won't stop

It's like honey when it washes over me
You know sugar never ever was so sweet
And I'm dying for ya
Crying for ya
I adore ya
One hit of your love addicted me
And I'm strung out on you, darling
Don't you see
Every night and day I can hardly wait
For another taste of honey

It's like honey when it washes over me
You know sugar never ever was so sweet
And I'm dying for ya
Crying for ya
I adore ya
One hit of your love addicted me
And I'm strung out on you, darling
Don't you see
Every night and day I can hardly wait
For another taste of honey

It's like honey when it washes over me
You know sugar never ever was so sweet
And I'm dying for ya
Crying for ya
I adore ya
One hit of your love addicted me
And I'm strung out on you, darling
Don't you see
Every night and day I can hardly wait
For another taste of honey
