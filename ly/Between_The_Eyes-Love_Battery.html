		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well alright, yeah alright!
Saw you lookin' for somethin' simple,
on beyond.
We are,
yeah, alright!
You wouldn't know it,
if it hit you right between, the eyes.
Yeah, alright!
Gonna lift you up, gonna bring you down.
Gonna let you walk through this life alone.
Gona let you follow your own dreams.

It'll turn your head around,
for the first time in your life you might find.
For the second time in a year,
I don't mind.
For the last time I think its time to fly.
Freedom's right between the eyes...

Well alright, yeah alright!
It takes years and tears and pain,
to find out where we ain't.
Yeah, alright!
It never meant that much to me.
Well alright, yeah alright!
I'll give you my heart, I'll give you my soul.
I'll wave good-bye when you're goin'.
Alright.
Let You follow your own dreams.

It'll turn your head around,
for the first time in your life you might find.
For the second time in a year,
I don't mind.
For the last time I think its time to fly.
Freedom's right between the eyes...

It'll turn your head around,
for the first time in your life you might find.
For the second time in a year,
I don't mind.
For the last time I think its time to fly.
Freedom's right between the eyes...
