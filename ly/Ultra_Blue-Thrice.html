		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Unabashedly pursue,
The Truth that we cannot deny
A revelation shining through,
Orchestration Adonai
A revolution ultra-blue,
And a melodic battle cry
And though you say there'll be no coup,

We'll never know unless we
Try to see it through,
And find a different point of view,
One where faith is not taboo
And we'll all learn to see the world as new

Sometimes a belief held true,
Is proved to be an outright lie
But it seems we always knew,
In some unspoken lullaby
I'll see you at the rendezvous,
We'll raise our voices to the sky
And though it's said there'll be no coup,

We'll never know unless we
Try to see it through, and find a
Different point of view,
One where faith is not taboo
And we'll all learn to see the world as new
