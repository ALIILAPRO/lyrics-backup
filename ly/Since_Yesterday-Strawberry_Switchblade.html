		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Just close your eyes and then remember
The thoughts you've locked away
When tomorrow comes you'll wish
You had today

[Chorus]
And as we sit here alone
Looking for a reason to go on
It's so clear that all we have now
Are our thoughts of yesterday

If you're still there when it's all over
I'm scared I'll have to say
That a part of  you has gone
Since yesterday

[Chorus]

Well, maybe this could be the ending
With nothing left of you
A hundred wishes couldn't say
I don't want to

[Chorus]

It's so clear that all we have now
Are thoughts of yesterday
