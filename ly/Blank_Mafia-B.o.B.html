		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I been workin', you been sleepin'
Flex on purpose, for no reason
Make your bitch disappear, black Houdini
Take the top off, like I'm streaking
Compliments feed me, I'm way too conceited
Sharp with my ego, I'm way too strategic
Martin Luther, I've been dreaming
Revolution, that's dangerous thinking

Dangerous thinking
Dangerous thinking
They been plotting, keeping secrets
Boycotting mortgage that's dangerous thinking
Boycotting taxes, that's dangerous thinking
Boycott authority, dangerous thinking!

Turn off the TV, it's way too misleading
Telling them lies, until you believe them
Repeat it, repeat it, repeat it, repeat it
It don't take a genius to pick up the pieces
I gotta speak in remedial English
Just for my niggas to see what's the meaning
Straight from the bottom, its hell I done seen it
It's crazy the devil got that bitch on freezing!
World is so cold, I'm sick with this flow
Swear it's a blessing, I'm here with these people that's
Losing lives, people grieving
People starving, I been eating
It's No Genre, La Familia
We the squad, we the legion
It's a jungle, on my chest I'm beating
Revolution, that's dangerous thinking
Bandz

Dangerous thinking
Dangerous thinking
They been plotting, keeping secrets
Boycotting mortgage that's dangerous thinking
Boycotting taxes, that's dangerous thinking
Boycott authority, dangerous thinking!

Sometimes I can't keep control of myself
Some people can't get a hold of myself
Sometimes I can't get a hold of myself
So I write a reminder, a note to myself
Saying fuck the whole world, it's a global affair
I just sold some fire to Smokey The Bear
Times getting hard, any moment I swear
Ima move in the woods, in the forest somewhere
Saying, fuck all the taxes I owe
Grow a beard and start trafficking blow
Throw a party and shit, its gon' be super lit
Ima call all the ratchets I know
I hear this voice, when I'm sleeping
Either its God, or Morgan Freeman
When you see it, when you see it
Revolution, that's dangerous thinking

Dangerous thinking
Dangerous thinking
They been plotting, keeping secrets
Boycotting mortgage that's dangerous thinking
Boycotting taxes, that's dangerous thinking
Boycott authority, dangerous thinking!

I am not preaching
Where are your facts, nigga you reaching
I'm peaceful but I stay with hittas' that might beat the black off a nigga like, nigga you bleaching!
A lot on my mind, and my line is receding
I jump out my sleep cuz I keep seeing demons
Just got evicted for no goddamn reason
They prolly just mad cuz I'm black and I'm breathing!
I am not some kind of magical genie
That shits miracles out my ass while I'm sneezing
The work I put into this craft that I'm bringing
Is too transcendental for half of you heathens
It's no secret, they been watching , getting heated
I've been mobbing, taking meetings
Evolution, that's dangerous thinking
BANDZ!

Dangerous thinking
Dangerous thinking
They been plotting, keeping secrets
Boycotting mortgage that's dangerous thinking
Boycotting taxes, that's dangerous thinking
Boycott authority, dangerous thinking!
