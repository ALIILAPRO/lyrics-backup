		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Grab a hold of me, I've got my arms up
Pull me out from this darkness
It's so hard for me to see, light up the end of that tunnel

If it's a war you came to see, you will never see a waved white flag in front me
I can't end up dead, I won't be misled
I'll keep singing this song inside my head

A phoenix rise? Or your demise?
Do I have to put your name on this grave?
Or give you one more shot?
This addiction came like a freight train
You're coming off of the rails again
It's hard for you to see the light at the end of the tunnel

If it's a war you came to see, you will never see a waved white flag in front me
I can't end up dead, I wont be misled
I'll keep singing this song inside my head

If it's a war you came to see, you will never see a waved white flag in front me
I can't end up dead, I wont be misled
I'll keep singing this song inside my head

On a one-way course set for destruction, full speed ahead
The time has come for you to start things over

Hold on, full speed ahead

All my life I've been waiting for something,
That never came, it never came
But I'm still saying

All my life I've been searching for something,
To break these chains, to break these chains
But I'll keep swinging

All my life I've been waiting for something,
That never came, it never came
But I'm still saying

All my life I've been searching for something,
To break these chains, to break these chains
But I'll keep swinging

All my life I've been waiting for something,
That never came, it never came
But I'm still saying

All my life I've been searching for something,
To break these chains, to break these chains
But I'll keep swinging

All my life I've been waiting for something,
That never came, it never came
But I'm still saying

All my life I've been searching for something,
To break these chains, to break these chains
But I'll keep swinging
