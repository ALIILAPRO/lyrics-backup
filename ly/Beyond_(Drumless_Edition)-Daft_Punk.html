		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dream
Beyond dreams
Beyond life
You will find your song
Before sounds to be found
Close your eyes and rise
Higher still, endless thrill
To the land of love, beyond love
Come alive and you'll find
Forever watching you and I

You are the night, you are the ocean
You are the light behind the cloud
You are the end and the beginning
A world with time is not allowed
There's no such thing as complication
To find our way, we lose control
Remember, love's our only mission
This is the journey of the soul
The perfect song is framed with silence
It speaks of places never seen
You hold your promise long forgotten
It is the birthplace of your dreams
