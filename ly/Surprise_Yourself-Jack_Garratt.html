		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Speak and open up your mind
It's something you should do all the time
Keep exploring, seek and find
You know you might surprise yourself
Talk without the taint to hold
The doubts that should embrace your heart
The calm and chaos of your soul
You know you might surprise yourself

Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh

Take a pen and write this down
Draw something that can't be found
And learn to walk again somehow
You know you might surprise yourself

Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh

Lover, if you only knew
The times that train has fooled me too
And tears me from a place I know
It helps me to surprise myself
You know you can surprise yourself
So let go and surprise yourself

Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh

Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
