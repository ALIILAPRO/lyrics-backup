		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don’t need perfect, oh,
But I’m sick of guessing all the time,
Struggling to read your mind,

Head’s doing circles oh,
Got me working overtime,
Tryna to find the reasons why

Lately I ain’t over us, but I feel like I’m losing touch , as I dive in deeper, do you notice? 
Maybe I just overthink, but I don’t want this over quick, if I started sinking 

These words get stuck in my mouth, but I feel I’m
dragging you down, as I dive in deeper,
Do you notice? 


Would you leave the light on, so I can come home,
Cause I’m getting scared in the dark on my own,
If you opened your eyes then you’d already know, already know, I’m feeling alone,
And I need you now, 
I’m feeling alone and I need you now (Repeat x3) 

You make me nervous oh, 
Now I’m losing sleep at night,
You never used to make me cry, 

But you don’t deserve this, ohhh 
I know it’s not your fault that I,
Question all your reasons why

These words get stuck in my mouth, but I feel I’m
dragging you down, as I dive in deeper,
Do you notice? 
Maybe I just overthink, but I don’t want this over quick, if I started sinking

Would you leave the light on, so I can come home,
Cause I’m getting scared in the dark on my own,
If you opened your eyes then you’d already know, already know, I’m feeling alone,
And I need you now, 
I’m feeling alone and I need you now (Repeat x3)
