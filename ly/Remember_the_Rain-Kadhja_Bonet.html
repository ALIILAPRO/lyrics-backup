		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We used to play out in the rain
Your mother scolded us
She said that we were bad

I thought I better go on home
You watched 'til I was gone
Ooh, girl, you look so sad

I picked you up when you fell
And cut your knee
Told you not to cry
And held you close to me

Can you remember the rain
Can you remember the rain
You left me for somebody else
Now I must face life by myself

You broke so many rules in school
I took the blame for you
I guess I was a fool

You used to pass me notes in class
I'd winked my eye and laugh
Those days went by so fast

I got remarks
That tore me all apart
Still trying to put back the pieces to my heart

Can you remember the rain
Can you remember the rain
You left me for somebody else
Now I must face life by myself

Can you remember the rain (think about it, think about it, think about it)
Can you remember the rain

You left me for somebody else
Now I must face life by myself
