		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fell in rows, just like dominoes
Held the line for just one day
Standing in perfect columns still
Graves lined-up across the hill

Pistols at dawn
Aw now you done it, baby
Oh no
I shoulda figured
You always make a fuss

What, you're an expert?
You read about it somewhere?
Baby, oh
"He had it coming"
It's always something with you

Civilized, evil eyes
Seen so much, we've gone blind
Friendly face in the firing squad
In the end, it's nice to know someone at a party

I guess I mighta sounded a little crazy, maybe
I only think of things I shouldn't do
It's like a puzzle
We sing about it sometimes, always
Thought we were ready
3000 years too soon

Temporary things last forever
And nothing exists
Temporary things last forever
And nothing exists
We'll ride into the flame
If that's what it takes
We'll ride into the flame
If that's what it takes

Break down

We're not there entirely
We are free, but we're not free
See the list of silenced ones
From the grave, they sing us psalms

These are the things that I must do
They are not meant to upset you
Some might just not be ready for the truth

When you first met me
I was probably doing something crazy, baby
We're not that special, what don't you understand?
You always worry about things that just don't matter
Another puzzle I'd like to solve with you
We might like to have fun but we will ride into the flame
If that is what it takes
Or we might never know
