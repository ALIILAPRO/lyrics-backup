		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby, what are we becomin'?
It feels just like we're always runnin'
Rollin' through the motions everyday
I could lean in to hold you or act like I don't even know you
Seems like you could care less either way
What happened to that girl I used to know?
I just want us back to the way we were before

Do I turn you on at all when I kiss you, baby?
Does the sight of me wanting you drive you crazy?
Do I have your love? Am I still enough?
Tell me don't I? Or tell me, do I, baby?
Give you everything that you ever wanted?
Would you rather just turn away and leave me lonely?
Do I just need to give up and get on with my life?
Baby, do I?

Remember when we didn't have nothin'
But a perfect simple kind of lovin'?
Baby, those sure were the days
There was a time our love ran wild and free
But now, I'm second guessin' everything I see

Do I turn you on at all when I kiss you, baby?
Does the sight of me wanting you drive you crazy?
Do I have your love? Am I still enough?
Tell me don't I? Or tell me, do I, baby
Give you everything that you ever wanted?
Would you rather just turn away and leave me lonely?
Do I just need to give up and get on with my life?
Baby, do I

Still give you what you need?
Still take your breath away?
Light up the spark way down deep, baby, do I?

Whoa
Do I turn you on at all when I kiss you, baby?
Does the sight of me wanting you drive you crazy?
Do I have your love? Am I still enough?
Tell me don't I? Or tell me, do I, baby
Give you everything that you ever wanted?
Would you rather just turn away and leave me lonely?
Do I just need to give up and get on with my life?

Tell me, baby do I get one more try?
Do I? Baby, do I?
