		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hello, hello
We throw the dice
It's up to chance again
I don't know if I wanna know, wanna know
Hello, hello
I need to find a light
I see it in your eyes

Join me on this ride
As I dive into the night
Where you keep me, keep me company
When your tears are pouring down
You ain't got no one around
I can keep you, keep you company

I'll keep you company
I'll keep you company

Hello, hello
Where are you now?
I'm on my own again
I don't know if I'm coming home, coming home
Hello, hello
Still there's us left to find
We live, we love, we lie

Join me on this ride
As I dive into the night
Where you keep me, keep me company
When your tears are pouring down
You ain't got no one around
I can keep you, keep you company

I'll keep you company
I'll keep you company
I'll keep you company
