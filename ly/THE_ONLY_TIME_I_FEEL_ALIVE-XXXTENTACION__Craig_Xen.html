		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Why the only time I feel alive is when I wanna die?
Yeah, tellin' me, "You can be the one," yeah
And, honestly, I don't really buy it, yeah
Hoe, shut up, be quiet
Just spend the night and suck dick, it's up
Yes, my diamonds white like some dice, like some rice
Just like spice, shawty entice
It got price, I don't check, I just buy
My bih bi-, fuck your lil' bih
Pussy so fye, she on my dick
That's what I like

Why the only time I feel alive is when I wanna die?
Yeah, tellin' me, "You can be the one," yeah
And, honestly, I don't really buy it, yeah
Hoe, shut up, be quiet, yeah (yeah)
Hoe, shut up, be quiet, yeah

Killin' 'em makin' me feel alive again ('gain)
Niggas so pussy, yeah, they ovulent (yeah)
Pull up, they run it, I get
All of the money, my mouth
Flooded in diamonds, and it's obvious (uh, yes)
I'ma beat a bad bitch, back break her (uh)
Dick in her mouth, she say it taste like suckin' banana
Or Tropicana or Fanta
I bust all up in her, then I'm skatin' (I'm skatin', uh)
Back to the block, I'm posted with ten toes
Skin-headed niggas, I'm murkin' shit, bitch, don't
Think for a minute we close, I just player talk smooth
To you ass simple hoes, I'm that nigga
Ten rack stuffies in pockets of my denim
Damn, bitch, my jeans are carrying your Civic
Bitch, I get paid to talk in your city
Think you fuck with me, nigga, yeah, you silly

Why the only time I feel alive is when I wanna die?
Yeah, tellin' me, "You can be the one," yeah
And, honestly, I don't really buy it, yeah
Hoe, shut up, be quiet, yeah
Hoe, shut up, be quiet, yeah

The only time I feel alive is when I wanna die
Yeah, tellin' me, "You can be the one," yeah
And, honestly, I don't really buy it
Hoe, shut up, be quiet
Yeah

Ooh-ooh, oh, oh
Ooh-ooh, oh, ah
Ooh-ooh, oh, ah
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, oh, oh
Ooh-ooh, oh, ah
Ooh-ooh, oh, ah

Why the only time I feel alive is when I wanna die?
Tellin' me, "You can be the one," yeah
And, honestly, I don't really buy it
Hoe, shut up, be quiet
