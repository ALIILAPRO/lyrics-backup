		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're always on my mind

I swear I've been down this street before
I recognize all of the red lights (the red lights)
Why I keep on coming back for more?
I don't know why I do this to myself (to myself)

I think with my heart, I love with my head, oh, na-na-na-na
I don't wanna add another regret

You're always on my mind
Like every single night
I try to say goodbye, bye
You're my favorite lifeline
I need all the time
I try to say goodbye, bye

But you're always on my mind
Ah, ah, ah
But you're always on my mind
Ah, ah, ah
But you're always on my mind

Why I always see your silhouette
In strangers I don't even recognize (don't recognize)
Scared of things that haven't happened yet
I don't know why I do this to myself (to myself)

I think with my heart, I love with my head, oh, na-na-na-na
I don't wanna add another regret

You're always on my mind
Like every single night
I try to say goodbye, bye
You're my favorite lifeline
I need all the time
I try to say goodbye, bye

But you're always on my mind
Ah, ah, ah
But you're always on my mind
Ah, ah, ah
But you're always on my mind

I think with my heart, I love with my head
I don't wanna add another regret

You're my favorite lifeline
I need all the time
I try to say goodbye, bye

But you're always on my mind
Ah, ah, ah
But you're always on my mind
Ah, ah, ah
But you're always on my mind
