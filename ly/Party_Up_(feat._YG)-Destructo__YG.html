		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's YG 400!
Destructo!

Where the bartender? Tell him bring more liquor
The only black person in here, bring more niggas
? made millions, ? made millions
I think it's easy to make millions

Kick the party up
I keep bitches on a party bus
If flea fucking, don't talk to us
That's probably why we don't talk too much

I want to party, I want to fuck
I want a model, no I want a slut
I want a model, no I want a slut
I want a model, no I want a slut

I want to do all freaky things
I need a bitch that'll do them kinky things

Where the bartender? Tell him bring more liquor
The only black person in here, bring more niggas
? made millions, ? made millions
I think it's easy to make millions

Kick the party up
I keep bitches on a party bus
If flea fucking, don't talk to us
That's probably why we don't talk too much

I want to party, I want to fuck
I want a model, no, I want a slut

I want to party
I want to party
I want to party
I want to party
I want to party
I want to party
I want to party
No I want a slut

Kick the party up
Kick the party up

I want to party, I want to party, I want to fuck
I want a model, no, I want a slut
