		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dear candy, your lip is dripping
Where are we
you make me stoned now
Could we lay here, till you leave there
We still have a thousand words in the darkness to say
Tell your story, will we clam and sleep
Your decisions have ruined all of them now
Please don't tell me that I could fall in dream alone
For the last night don't let me go
Please do me a favor
Don't leave me alone
Please do me a favor
Don't sleep alone
Don't sleep alone
Dear candy, your lip is dripping
Where are we
you make me stoned now
Could we lay here, till you leave there
We still have a thousand words in the darkness
Dear candy, your lip is dripping
Where are we
you make me stoned now
Could we lay here, till you leave there
We still have a thousand words in the darkness to say
