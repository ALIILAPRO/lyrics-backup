		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh my god
I won
Damage is done
You had your fun
Bet you're sorry now
You dressed me in white
To just lay me down
I would've stayed till death took me out
But then you fucked up
And gave me the gun
So I'll give you
One More Shot
You think that I'm crazy I know
You just wanna leave me
Then go
Blood on my hands
You're already dead
But I'll give you
One more shot
Your body is cold but I'm hot
You think that I'm playing I'm not
You know how this ends
I'll put you to rest with
One more shot
I used to hold you
All through the night
Till I saw the purple
Under your eyes oh
I'm not surprised
You're still doing drugs
But like to pretend
That you and that girl
We're only just friends
I saw the whole truth
That bruise on your neck
Oh i could just kill you
Well that just depends
If you're sorry
Want me to forgive you
If you want me to
I can give you
Just one more shot
You think that I'm crazy I know
If you want to leave me then go
Blood on my hands
You're already dead
But I'll give you
One more shot
Your body is cold but I'm hot
You think that I'm playing I'm not
You know how this ends
I'll put you to rest with
One more shot
