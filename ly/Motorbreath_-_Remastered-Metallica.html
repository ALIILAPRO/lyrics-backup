		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Living and dying laughing and crying 
Once you have seen it you will never be the same 
Life in the fast lane is just how it seems 
Hard and it is heavy dirty and mean 

Motorbreath its how I live my life 
I can't take it any other way 
Motorbreath the sign of living fast 
It is going to take your breath away 

Don't stop for nothing its full speed or nothing 
I am taking down you know whatever is in my way 
Getting your kicks as you are shooting the line 
Sending the shivers up and down your spine 

Motorbreath its how I live my life 
I can't take it any other way 
Motorbreath the sign of living fast 
It is going to take your breath away 

Those people who tell you not to take chances 
They are all missing on what life is about 
You only live once so take hold of the chance 
Don't end up like others the same song and dance 

Motorbreath its how I live my life 
I can't take it any other way 
Motorbreath the sign of living fast 
It is going to take your breath away
