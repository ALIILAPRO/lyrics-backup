		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yo Gas Mask down
It's revenge mode
I gotta level my levels
So I don't explode
Gotta stay focused
Put on the Killah face
Figure how to get em' all in the same place
Plot thickens, it's all about the strategies
I look down in my bag and see a stack of cheese
Start making calls, buying artillery
Landmines and shit, niggas is killing me
Aiming for the block where all the magic happens
Call 911 report a kidnapping...

Fuck a Glock
Hundred shots from the ooo-wop
Let's bring it back to them blocks off the new lots
Who a cop, nigga? I started from the shoe box
You grew a lot
But I schooled you how to do drops
In my tube socks spraying from the rooftops
92' props
Banging for my blue tops
It's me and you Ock, Biggie verses 2Pac
And you forgot
I'm the one who let you rock
Yellow brick squares yeah
Nigga I'm the wiz here
Can never fear
Fuck boy you just live here
Kill your kids here, put you in a wheel chair
And leave you there with that ice grill stare Tony
You know you know me
The one and only
The ruler of Eukanuba
Do my dirt all by my lonely
Motherfucker

It's me nigga!
You know that work I put in!
You really feeling yourself!
Should've stayed gone, motherfucker!

Rog came quick
Like he's suppose to
I'm going postal
Caught a gang member - Blew him bi-costal
Brains all over the block - it's hot
Crooked cops running up in the game to see my plot
They about to meet in the street where the bomb's set
Detonate like a war vet and jet
Duck behind cars, Blowing ARs
Glock 9s poppin, Bodies droppin'
I'm taking out knee caps - Anyone standin'
Perfect timing, Perfect plannin'
I'm filling funeral homes and graves
It's no surprise
GFK the only one to survive!

You know what I mean?
Cause when the real kids come at you, nigga it's over
