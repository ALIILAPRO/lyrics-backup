		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I just wanna flex, I'm too pretty to be stressed Check my phone, that's a text, my old n***a
Says I'm blessed I'm a bad lil' Bih, please who is checking for me
Told that ho take a seat, she think she competition to me

Need my glasses, I can't see, any bitch that's better than me
Lip gloss on gloss, 50 inch weave on fleek
Keep my hair real long cause I'm a freak in
The sheets
Pretty girls like me, yeah they pretty,bad and petite

Ask me which diamonds I need, I told him please
Just Tiffany's If you tryna drown me, drop me off in the
Sea I got hustlers round me, cutting checks like
Receipts If his daddy's real rich, make him steal that jeep for me

I just wanna flex, I'm too pretty to be stressed
Check my phone, that's a text, my old n***a says I'm blessed
I'm a bad lil' B-piece, who is checking for me
Told that ho take a seat, she think she competition me

Came in the game and I eat off a platter Real princess, when I rhyme, I don't stammer
My n***a gon' stroke in this shit like a dagger Bad lil' vibe, when I drink, I don't stagger
Been on this rap shit, I don't need to brag I like all his chains and the way that they
Hang Poppy, does it really hang is it really gonna thang

He know I'm bad and he know I'm conceited I told him shut up and you baby just eat it
Shooting a shot and you know I won't miss Michael Jordan, jump man on my kicks
Stacking these bands and they stay on my wrists This cold lil' bitch on my drill, just ice me
How you gon' want all this beef and ain't got no bread
Lil' ho, You better not try me , uh
