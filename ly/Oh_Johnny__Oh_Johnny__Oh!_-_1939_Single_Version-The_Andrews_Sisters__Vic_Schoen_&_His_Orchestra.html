		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Choo choo to Broadway foo Cincinnati
Don't get icky with the one two three
Life is just so fine on the solid side of the line, rip

Hold tight, hold tight, hold tight, hold tight 
Fododo-de-yacka saki
Want some sea food, Mama 
Shrimps and rice they're very nice 
Hold tight, hold tight, hold tight, hold tight 
Fododo-de-yacka saki
Want some sea food, Mama 
Shrimps and rice they're very nice 

I like oysters, lobsters too 
I like my tasty butter fish, foo
When I come home late at night 
I get my favorite dish, fish 

Hold tight, hold tight, hold tight, hold tight 
Fododo-de-yacka saki
Want some seafood, Mama
Shrimps and rice they're very nice 
Bad da do da,a, da de do da do da, ba da da da do da

Fododododo Yacka sacki
Want some seafood, Mama
Shrimps and rice they're always very nice 

Fododo dya, Fododo dya Fododo-de-yacka saki
Want some seafood Mama
Oh, won't you give it to me 
'Cause I'm as happy as can be
When the seafood comes to me
La-da-da, la-da-da, la-da-da

I like oysters, lobsters, too
Ba-da-da-dat-dat-da-dada-data
When I get home late at night
I get my favorite dish, fish

Hold tight, hold tight, hold tight, hold tight

Want some sea food, Mama 
Shrimps and rice are very nice 

Hold tight, won't cha hold tight 
Hold tight, fododododo yacka sacki
Want some seafood, Mama
Shrimpers a-hand ri-hice a-hare very nice

I like my tasty butter fish, Joe
When I come home late at night 
Drip drip dripin' on the window pane
Wash it
Hold tight do-dat-do-day
Hold tight she wants some seafood, Mama
Shrimpers and rice they're very nice 

I like oysters, lobsters too, 
I like my tasty butter fish, foo
When I come home late at night 
I get my favorite dish, fish 

Hold tight, hold tight
Hold tight, hold tight
Want some seafood, oh Mama
Shrimpers and rice, oh hold tight
