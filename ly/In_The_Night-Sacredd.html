		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know you said that we're done girl, but you dont wanna leave
So why you up in my bed girl, you know its half past three
I cant deny that I love it when you lay up on me
Don't you pretend that its healthy, you know you torture me

Fuck it, we drinkin', we smokin' right through this Friday night
Cause music's blastin', we dancin' under the moonlight
Fuck it, I told you, I want you, its only us tonight
It felt so real in that moment until I realized

Oh, oh
Girl I know I have to let you go, go
I can't take this damage anymore, wow
You remind me of her, hope you know, she took my soul

Girl, lets get high
Need to get that girl up out my life
She be creepin' on me in the night
Haunting me forever, I can't hide
She cursed my mind

Need you
Baby, ya I said it, didn't mean to
Baby, just forget it, didn't plan to
Let me hold you closer, let me love you
Let me show you, oh

Fuck it, we drinkin', we smokin' right through this Friday night
Cause music's blastin', we dancin' under the moonlight
Fuck it, I told you, I want you, its only us tonight
It felt so real in that moment until I realized

Oh, oh
Girl I know I have to let you go, go
I can't take this damage anymore, wow
You remind me of her, hope you know, she took my soul

Girl, lets get high
Need to get that girl up out my life
She be creepin' on me in the night
Haunting me forever, I can't hide
She cursed my mind
