lyrics
Aileen innocent having fun
Stolen forever from being young oh yeah
World of violence you want to die
Saying nothing so you don't have to lie oh yeah

Broken brown eyed castaway
Sorrow and fear she starts to pray
Memory memory thou shalt burn me

Aileen innocent broken heart
The girl who couldn't cry in front of anyone oh yeah
Walls of concrete a steel cage
Prison of her body where touch triggers shame
Memory memory thou shalt burn me
Memory memory thou shalt burn me

Murder or be murdered you buried your lie
Bloodied and broken she rises
Wrapped in bruised flesh darkened streaks of fear
She said do not pity the dead, pity the living
Because angels sleep in a ditch of fire
And now your life is a dark stone prison cell

Walk away from the gates of hell
Freedom comes easy in a prison cell oh yeah

Broken brown eyed castaway
Sorrow and fear she starts to pray
Memory memory thou shalt burn me

Real outlaw
Real outlaw
Real outlaw
Real outlaw
Aileen innocent having fun
