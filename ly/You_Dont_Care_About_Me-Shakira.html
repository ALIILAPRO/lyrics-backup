		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I fold your t-shirt
And I strip your bed
I loved you perfect
But there's no appreciation

I listened sweetly to your sour tongue
I loved you only
But there's no reciprocation

Before you came along
It was all beautiful
I have nothing left
In my heart, in my soul

Should have never helped
You become so powerful
But I saw a champion in your eyes

You don't care about me
If you did, you would let me go
You will eventually
'Cause you just don't care about me

You don't care if I die
If you did, you would have spared my life
I say it confidently
That you just don't care about me

You say you're thirsty
So I pour the wine
The bottle's empty
But there's no consummation

Before you came along
It was all beautiful
I have nothing left
In my heart, in my soul

Should have never helped
You become so powerful
But I saw a champion in your eyes

You don't care about me
If you did, you would let me go
You will eventually
'Cause you just don't care about me

You don't care if I die
If you did, you would have spared my life
I say it confidently
That you just don't care about me

Oh, baby, how we used to dance
I couldn't separate from your hands
Now they don't even play that song anymore
You don't care about me

No, don't care about me, no
Don't care about me
You don't care about me, no
Don't care about about me, no

You don't care about me
If you did, you would let me go
You will eventually
'Cause you just don't care about me

You don't care if I die
If you did, you would have spared my life
I say it confidently
That you just don't care about me
