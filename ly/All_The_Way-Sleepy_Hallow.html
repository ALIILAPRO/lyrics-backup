		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Great John on the beat by the way

Lift me up
Make me feel like I'm the only one that you love
Nothing lasts forever so let's seize the day
Run away together, going all the way

Free Billy, my sliggity slatt
If it wasn't for rap, I'll be pushing a pack
2 a.m. in the back of the 'Bach
I don't know where I'm at but I'm toting the strap
How you love me, you holding me back
Gotta watch the back door for that hole in your back
If you RICO, he gotta get whacked
If he fronting, we gotta get back
I'm the glue to this shit, had to keep it together
Yeah, you good, but they saying I'm better
And she say she want me, I'm making her wetter
Put the chop right on top of her dresser
The way I be dressin' is not to impress her
This shit regular, stay with some pressure
These niggas will rat just to get to some cheddar
I'ma see 'em whenever
Just papers and Grabba, don't fuck with no Swisher
That's your man, but he fucking your sister
And he want your bitch, had the chance he will dick her
Niggas sick, gettin' sicker
That's why I do not be rockin' with niggas
Did a lot for some niggas
And way before rap did a lot with them triggers
And we still do a lot for the, fuck that
Don't got no time to be mentioning niggas
If it's lit then we sending them niggas
Lil' bro get to bussin' when he off a jigga
Know a shooter that hate taking pictures
She just tryna slide and hit up a hitter
No, the swindle don't apply to beginners
A lot of them niggas ain't make it to dinner
Grandma pray for me, know I'm a sinner
My heart get cold, I was born in the winter
Baby, I ain't no regular nigga
As soon as you slipping, they coming to get you
Uh, better hope they don't get you

Lift me up
Make me feel like I'm the only one that you love
Nothing lasts forever so let's seize the day
Runaway together, going all the way

Wait, nah, fuck it, you can keep love
Baby, I just keep drugs
And lately I ain't tryna speak up
I'm just kickin' feet up
And she say she love me, don't believe her
The reason I'ma leave her
My heart got cold, I need a heater
My wrists still on freezer
I iced out my daughter, she a diva
She hate when Daddy leave her
But baby, I'm workin', I'ma see ya
Forever we gon' be stuck
Forever we gon' be up
If they play with you then they get touched
Uh, I don't ever speak much
And she don't ever need much

Lift me up
Make me feel like I'm the only one that you love
Nothing lasts forever, so let's seize the day
Run away together, going all the way
Lift me up
Make me feel like I'm the only one that you love
Nothing lasts forever, so let's seize the day
Run away together, going all the way
Lift me up
Make me feel like I'm the only one that you love
Nothing lasts forever, so let's seize the day
Runaway together, going all the way
Ayy
