I love Chris Rich)

Bare residue in the air when it boots
Who's getting a twos 'cah the smoke too blemish (grr, baow)
When my niners get 'round they dread it
No left, right, just step 'round and shell it (woi-yoi)
Bro might load that gauge then sneeze at your brain 
It's a new pandemic (trust me)
Jailhouse ting I was doin' up Snap
Marty and mash Voda' for the credit (deh deh)

Put my foot in this whip (mm-hmm)
Level up when I slap this stick (baow, baow)
Times two if I hit that prick (ayy)
Back road, move mad and move skits (I do)
You see, Bankai wan' kill and chill (Bankai)
Bigger the par, that's thrill and skill (mm-hmm)
Insidious how the youte got poked (grr, baow)
Talk on my name, are you poppin' pills?

Bang for the team, would you bang the machine? (Baow)
Stay with a plan for the beef
See me on a casual, least a nank in my jeans (baow, baow, baow, baow)
For the bad talk, might dampen a tee (ching)
Leave a weed factory clean
I could pay but of course I'm happy it's free (mm-hmm)
Really move aggy on weed
We just take ours and get trappy with green

(Listen)
Bang for the team, would you bang of the beam?
A boy got left at the scene (done)
I hate when I run out of plastic bags in the trap
So I gotta use Rizz' for the B
Roll with a TEC, gunmen don't lean
We hold and press the machine (baow, baow)
Bro got trial in the Crown Court
He took the rap then he caught a G (free up, free up)

Let me ask you a question (yo)
How can them man talk bad? (How?)
Buck into gang, they cap (ayy, come here)
Go on Snapchat, talk a whole lot of wass (damn)
Tip-toe with the wap and crash (baow, baow)
Or run a man down and feed him a shank (ayy, come here)
You like iron? Come firm this splash (mmhmm)
Juice man's head, belly and back (ching, ching)

How many times have they jumped out
We jump out and they jump back in? (How many?)
How many times have we dumped off
Jakes find out and they want us in? (How many?)
No big (no big), there's no link (no link, no)
So we soon be back on the strip (back)
When pissed, I don't think
Try get a man down, I ain't hearin' a thing

Yo, V
How many times have we rised and ching with the cutter? (Splash)
Bare opps wanna bluff and stunt for their block
Don't front then run from the brucker (brucker)
Yo, T
Them man chat on the net, I can't listen to neeks (some gems)
I'm with K, in a new shaped car tryna make man (grr, baow)
Yo, K
How many opps been chopped and put on a blade? (Yuck)
Dice man up like Gillette on a razor
Word, you can hold this shave
Ayy, T
They get shot, tryna leave opps deceased (baow)
Mad sight when them slugs release (grr, baow)
Doublin' waps if I'm with V
In the ride, two straps like dungarees (baow, baow, baow, baow)

Who was at fault when they lost that banger? (Who?)
Got best of both like Hannah Montana
Roll with a tanner 'cah there's too much passa
We beat off the corn, they scatter (grr, baow)
Long nose, no Boyz 'n' The Hood
Man wind down the window and beat that hammer (baow, baow, baow, baow)
This PYT can't handle the D
Man drag on the weave then yaga-yaga
Nine gang beat that mop
They all blow out when they hear that ring (baow, baow)
How many times have you denied your block? (Baow, baow, baow, baow)
You're all involved, I ain't hearin' a thing
Get around, two stolen dings
Jump out the car and they all run in (baow, baow)
Dem man too fast, they should go racin', pagin'
Slow down, come and hold some chings (uh)

Yo, V
How many times have we rised and ching with the cutter? (Splash)
Bare opps wanna bluff and stunt for their block
Don't front then run from the brucker (brucker)
Yo, T
Them man chat on the net, I can't listen to neeks (some gems)
I'm with K, in a new shaped car tryna make man (grr, baow)
Yo, K
How many opps been chopped and put on a blade? (Yuck)
Dice man up like Gillette on a razor
Word, you can hold this shave
Ayy, T
They get shot, tryna leave opps deceased (baow)
Mad sight when them slugs release (grr, baow)
Doublin' waps if I'm with V
In the ride, two straps like dungarees (baow, baow, baow, baow)
