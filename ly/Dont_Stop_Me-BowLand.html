		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't raise your voice
Let it be my choice
To forget you
Slowly erase you

Don't raise your voice
Let it be my choice
To forget you
Slowly erase you
(Slowly erase you)
(Slowly erase you)

Don't stop me
I'm driving to nowhere alone
Don't stop me
I'm dreaming, flying to cope
Don't stop me
I'm driving to nowhere alone
Don't stop me
I'm dreaming flying to cope

Won't take the blame
I don't feel the same
Please forgive me
Simply release me (release me)

Don't stop me
I'm driving to nowhere alone
Don't stop me
I'm dreaming, flying to cope
Don't stop me
I'm driving to nowhere alone
Don't stop me
I'm dreaming, flying to cope

Don't stop me (don't stop me)
I'm driving (don't stop me)
To nowhere (don't stop me)
Alone (don't stop me)
Don't stop me
I'm dreaming (don't stop me)
Flying (don't stop me)
To cope

Don't stop me
