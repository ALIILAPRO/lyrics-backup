		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You move in waves
You never retrace
Your newest craze
Straight out of the face by the bed unread

I'm left behind
Like all the others
Some fall for you
It doesn't make much difference if they do

She changes every time you look
By summer it was all gone, now she's moved on
She called you every other day
So savor it, it's all gone, now she's moved on

So for a while
Everything seemed new
Did we connect?
Or was it all just biding time for you?

She changes every time you look (all gone away)
By summer it was all gone, now she's moved on (she's moving on)
She called you every other day (all gone away)
So savor it, it's all gone, now she's moved on (she's moving on)

She's moved on
She's moved on
She's moved on
She's moved on

She changes every time you look
By summer it was all gone, now she's moved on
She called you every other day (all gone away)
So savor it, it's all gone, now she's moved on (she's moving on)

(All gone away)
(She's moving on)
(All gone away)
(She's moving on)
(All gone away)
(She's moving on)
(All gone away)
(She's moving on)
