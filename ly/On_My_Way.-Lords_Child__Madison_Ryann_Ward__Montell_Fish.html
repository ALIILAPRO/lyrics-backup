		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'll be on my way
Hit me up, I'll call on your name
I don't care what they say
Never gonna stop on my praise

You know I be the one to
Travel the seas to find you
Mountains and trees I'll climb, too
Whatever it will take
I'll always be beside you
Secretest place, I'll hide you
Blood on the cross, I died to
Show you that I'm yours

I will go around the world for You, You
All our days I'll come and say: "I do, do"

I'll be on my way
Hit me up, I'll call on your name
I don't care what they say
Never gonna stop on my praise

I can't keep stopping all your love, I see
Vibrant colors in your heart, chase me
All day through the fields of love, you are
My lover, you are my lover
I can't keep stopping all your love, I see
Vibrant colors in your heart, chase me
All day through the fields of love, you are
My lover, you are
(La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)

I'll be on my way (I'll be on my way to you)
Hit me up, I'll call on your name
(Hit me up, I'll call on your name)
I don't care what they say
(I don't care what they say)
Never gonna stop on my praise
(Never gonna stop on my praise)

I'll be on my way (Oh oh oh, yes)
Hit me up, I'll call on your name
I don't care what they say
(I don't care what they say)
Never gonna stop on my praise (On my praise)
