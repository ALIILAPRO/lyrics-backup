		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Almost heaven, West Virginia
Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River
Life is old there, older than the trees
Younger than the mountains, growing like a breeze

Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia
Mountain mamma, take me home
Country roads

All my memories, gather 'round her
Miner's lady, stranger to blue water
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky
Misty taste of moonshine, teardrops in my eyes

Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia
Mountain mamma, take me home
Country roads

I hear her voice in the mornin' hour she calls me
The radio reminds me of my home far away
Drivin' down the road, I get a feelin'
That I should have been home yesterday, yesterday

Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia
Mountain mamma, take me home
Country roads

Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia
Mountain mamma, take me home
Country roads

Take me home, down country roads
Take me home, down country roads
