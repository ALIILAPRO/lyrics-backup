		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No one to guide

You were the one who told me not to
Look back in regret
Taught me to hold on brave the sorrow
At least that's what you said
You abandoned it all and left like that
Disappeared and dropped the pen
I can't finish a book I never wrote
A single letter in

My trust in you was gone
The moment you refused to carry on

With no one to guide
I didn't think that you would
Leave me here all alone tonight
When you paved my way
Now I'm here with no one to guide
(No one to guide)
I didn't think that you would
Leave me here all alone tonight
When you paved my way

It's coming clear
I take the pen and
Continue where you left off
I'm in charge of filling the pages
So they'll turn out for the best
And the reason for all reveals itself
In a moment I'm alone
'Cause your story that I'm supposed to close
Has always been my own

My trust in you was gone
But I can choose to carry on

With no one to guide
Didn't think that you would
Leave me here all alone tonight
When you paved my way

And I can never stop walking it down
To the end of the road
The final chapters still unknown
Maybe your journey ends today
But this is not the end for me
Still there's no time to stop and hide my face
I can't win this race with my eyes shut
Can't go back to the start
Let it all fall apart
It's too late, the final chapter awaits me

With no one to guide
Didn't think that you would
Leave me here all alone tonight
When you paved my way
You paved my way
With no one to guide
Didn't think that you would
Leave me here all alone tonight
When you paved my way

And I can never stop walking it down
Heading straight to the unknown
A story ends today
But not for me

With no one guide (no one to guide)
Didn't think that you would
Leave me here all alone tonight (yeah)
When you paved my way
Now I'm here with no one to guide
(No one to guide)
I didn't think that you would
Leave me here all alone tonight
When you paved my way
