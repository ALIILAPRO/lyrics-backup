		  Uh, yeah, uh, yeah, uh, yeah, uh
Uh, yeah, uh, yeah, uh
Uh, yeah, uh, yeah, uh, yeah, uh
Uh, yeah, uh, yeah, uh

Pour a four of drop, this ain't Wock'
This some red
(Pour a four, this ain't no Wock', boy)
Pop me a Perc', fuck that bitch, go to bed
I gave that ho the work
She said she cannot feel her legs
And you know I go berserk
I can do anything when I'm off these meds
I can do anything when I'm off these meds
(Meds, meds, meds, meds)

I can do anything when I'm off acid
(Acid, acid, acid, acid)
I can do anything when I got these racks
(And I got this money, I got this cash)
I can do anything, I don't get no rest
(I don't get no rest, no, I can do anything)
I can do anything, bitch, I ain't stressing

Yeah, she fucking with me and
She know it's a blessing
That shit was past tense now
It's all a lesson
How you looking for me when you
Know where to catch me
I ain't hard to find, pussy nigga
I'm steppin'
I'm on the block, I'm posted with my FN
I am the only one, there's no eleven
You know that double cup is
Like my best friend

Pour a four of drop, this ain't Wock'
This some red (This ain't no Wock')
Pop me a Perc', fuck that bitch, go to bed
(I fucked that bitch)
I gave that ho the work
She said she cannot feel her legs
And you know I go berserk
I can do anything when I'm off these meds
I can do anything when I'm off these meds

I can do anything when I'm off acid
I can do anything when I got these racks
I can do anything, I don't get no rest
I can do anything, bitch, I ain't stressing
