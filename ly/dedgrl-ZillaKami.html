		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ah, ah

She got hooked on ketamine
Future broken, heavy weight
It took a long time to know, couldn't break
She took a long time to go over pain

Student, scholar, couldn't pay
Got indebted heavy weight
It took a long time to know, bank can't wait
It took a short time to grow over pain

Head goes around
Thinkin' it is over, head goes around (ah)
Head goes around
Thinkin' it is over, head goes around (ah)
Around and around

Got depression in the brain
Started cuttin' on the veins
It took a short time to know, parents shamed
It wasn't long 'fore he goes far away

Around and around
Floatin' in an orbit, 'round and around (ah)
Around and around
Floatin' in an orbit, 'round and around 
You're dead in the ground

Ah, ah
