		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Killer bees
On my neck
Killer bees on my neck
Yeah they're stinging on my neck
Killer bees on my neck
Killer bees

Stone cold killer
A stone cold killer bee
They're off to sting you in the dark meadows
That's who I'm meant to be
They wanna track you down in scapes so low
They wanna sting you on the skin
Stone cold killer
A stone cold killer bee

Killer bees
On my neck
Killer bees from a tech
Of a speck
From the deck
Killer bees
From the wreck
Stinging on my neck
Killer bees on check
When they're stinging on my
Knees
On my neck
Stinging on my neck
Killer bees where's my check
Where's my check
Where's my check
Killer bees
On my neck
Killer bees and you're stinging on my

Stone cold killer
A stone cold killer bee
Gonna sting you by the meadows
Meadows of
A stone cold killer bee

Killer bees
On my neck
Killer bees on my neck
Yeah they're stinging on my neck
Killer bees on my neck
Killer bees
Killer bees
On my neck
Killer bees on my neck
Yeah they're stinging on my neck
Killer bees on my neck
Killer bees
