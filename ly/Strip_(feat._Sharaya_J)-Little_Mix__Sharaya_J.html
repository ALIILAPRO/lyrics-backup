		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take off all my make-up 'cause I love what's under it
Rub off all your words, don't give a, "uh", I'm over it
Jiggle all this weight, yeah, you know I love all of this
Finally love me naked, sexiest when I'm confident

You say I ain't pretty
Well, I say, "I'm beautiful", it's my committee
Say we too provocative
Still look at me, look at me, look at me, yeah
Come for my girls you blocked
Daily mail ratin' ma√±ana a la noche
I don't owe you nothin'
Nah, I don't give a, not- not anymore (ah-ooh)

If you got little boobs, love it
If you got a big ass, grab it (ah-ooh)
If you got nothing big, rock it
It's your life, go get it, if you want it
Up in the mirror like, "Ah, yeah"
Lovin' my figure like, "Ah, yeah"
When I'm slim or I'm thick, I'm like, "Ah, yeah"
Swear I'm a kill 'em like, "Ah!"

Strip!
Take off all my make-up 'cause I love what's under it
Rub off all your words, don't give a, "uh", I'm over it (Strip!)
Jiggle all this weight, yeah, you know I love all of this
Finally love me naked, sexiest when I'm confident (Strip!)

I ain't scared anymore
My body outta control (Strip!)
Baby, I know that you love (dis, dis, dis, dis)
I know I'ma hot (?) (Strip!)
Gotta do what you want
If they love it or they don't (Strip!)
I know you ain't ready for dis, dis, dis, dis
Baby, take it off (Strip!)

Da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da

(Love who you) Love who you wanna
Don't give a damn it's a man or a woman
Wanna talk about color?
It's the skin that I'm in, yeah, I get from my mama (ah-ha)
I'm a woman don't test me
Baby, I'm growing, my stretch-marks are sexy
I don't owe you nothing
Nah, I don't give a, not- not anymore (ah-ooh)

If you got little boobs, love it (facts)
If you got a big ass, grab it (ah-ooh)
If you got nothing big, rock it
It's your life, go get it, if you want it

Strip!
Take off all my make-up 'cause I love what's under it (ha!)
Rub off all your words, don't give a, "uh", I'm over it (Strip!)
Jiggle all this weight, yeah, you know I love all of this
Finally love me naked, sexiest when I'm confident (Strip!)

I ain't scared anymore
My body outta control (Strip!)
Baby, I know that you love (dis, dis, dis, dis)
I know I'ma hot (?) (Strip!)
Gotta do what you want (what else?)
If they love it or they don't (that's right) (Strip!)
I know you ain't ready for dis, dis, dis, dis (Sharaya J!)
Baby, take it off (Strip!)

First of all, you got to love who you are
Don't less social media tear you apart
HB I see, I'm head Benji in charge
I'm ready and I got a hundred bars
I don't care if you got a hundred red cards
I don't care if you got a hundred mil'
'Cause even if you had a hundred deals
That money won't buy you a confidence will
Skrrt, pull up with a drip (drip)
Got juice? (Got juice?)
Take a sip (take a sip)
I'm so (uh-huh) serious (woah-woah)
Lil' Mix in a mix period (period)
Still a cover girl, even with no makeup
Live your best life, even with your A-cups
I ain't gotta act, I just gotta be me
Put me on a track, I'ma ride like Kiki (ayy)

Strip!
Take off all my make-up 'cause I love what's under it
Rub off all your words, don't give a, "uh", I'm over it (Strip!)
Jiggle all this weight, yeah, you know I love all of this
Finally love me naked, sexiest when I'm confident

Take off all my make-up 'cause I love what's under it
Rub off all your words, don't give a, "uh", I'm over it (Strip!)
Jiggle all this weight, yeah, you know I love all of this
Finally love me naked, sexiest when I (Strip!)
