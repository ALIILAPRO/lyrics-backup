		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Ooh) oh, (ooh) oh
(Ooh) oh, (ooh) oh

I keep on fallin'
In and out of love
With my baby
I love him (love you)
Say mmm-hmm (mmm-hmm)
I feel good
Sometimes, I feel used
Lovin' you ooh-ooh-ooh (ooh-ooh-ooh)
I'm so confused

I keep on fallin' in and out
Of love with you
I never loved someone
The way that I'm loving you

Ooh, never felt this way
Oh, so much pleasure (pleasure)
So much pain? (So much pain?)
Just when I think
I'm such a fool
I start ooh-ooh-ooh (ooh-ooh-ooh)
All over again with you

I keep on fallin' in and out
Of love with you
I never loved someone (I'm, I'm, I'm fallin') 
The way that I'm loving you (the way I'm) 
Sing it, sing it, sing it for me now
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm fallin'
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm fallin'
Got me fallin'
Fall (fall, fall), oh
Fallin'

I keep on fallin' (fallin') in and out (fallin')
Of love with you (of love with you)
I never loved someone (I never loved someone)
The way that I'm loving you (the way that I'm loving you)

I keep on fallin' (fallin') in and out (fallin')
Of love with you (oh baby, oh baby)
I never loved someone (no, no, no)
The way that I'm loving you

What?
Fall
And, yeah, yeah

Thank you
Thank you so much
Alright
Thank you very much, thank you
Alright, y'all, before we go home, you know
I had to do some special for y'all
I wanna get the party started up in here
I wanna bring my peoples out
And I got two of my favorite MCs in the place today
So let's, let's do it like this
