		  Dancin'
Let me see you move, come on
Dancin'
Let me see you move

Baby, love never felt so good
And I doubt if it ever could
Not like you hold me, hold me
Oh baby, love never felt so fine
And I doubt if it's never mine
Not like you hold me, hold me

And the night is gonna be just fine
Gotta fly, gotta see, can't believe
I can't take it, cause

Baby, every time I love you
In and out of my life, in out baby
Tell me, if you really love me
It's in and out of my life, in out baby
So baby, love never felt so good

Baby, love never felt so fine
And I doubt if it was ever mine
Not like you hold me, hold me
Oh baby, love never felt so good
And I doubt if it ever could
Not like you hold me, hold me

And the night through the thick and thin
Gotta fly, gotta see, can't believe
I can't take it cause

Baby, every time I love you
In and out of my life, in out baby
Tell me, if you really love me
It's in and out of my life, in out baby
So baby, love never felt so good

Dancin'
Let me see you move, come on
Let me see you move
Dancin'
Let me see you move, come on
I said let me see you move
Michael

And the night, that is good
Gotta fly, gotta see, can't believe
I can't take it cause

Baby, every time I love you
In and out of my life, in out baby
Tell me, if you really love me
It's in and out of my life, driving me crazy
So baby, love never felt so good

Baby, every time I love you
In and out of my life, in out baby
Tell me, if you really love me
It's in and out of my life, driving me crazy
So baby, love never felt so good
