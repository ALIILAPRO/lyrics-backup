		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No frowns around, I'm now an older clown
I think I honked my spleen
The money came to answer my prayers
If you're filming me piss it's probably best
I stop the stream
My colon is golden, eyes they gleam

Waking up
Courage in my cup
Last was night was rough
Don't remember much
Waking up
Courage in my cup
Last night was rough
Doing what I love

Running on fumes, what can I do?
Waiting for my score to come through
Desperate for some motivation
Running on fumes, checking my views
Scrolling for a comment that proves
I don't need more motivation

I'm locked in
I'm stocked up, often
I'm shopping, my face is frosted

I'm living life as if I'm already dead
I'm spilling cups and then I'm fucking the fed

I'm locked in, and topped up often
No caution, my pace is toxic
I'm living life as if I'm already dead
Open and shut, you know I gave it my best

Was feeling panicked so I got myself a knife
Then I felt empty, so I went and got myself a wife
I tried to learn about the meaning of my life
But I couldn't quite decide on which good book to buy

'Cause I'm like that, priceless, finest
Ice white platypus
Blessing the things that I touch
Worship me, worship my stuff
Fitted with a gimmick, make a cynical wow
Many men went in it, but they couldn't get out
All of the things that we touch
Suck all the life out of us

Running on fumes, what can I do?
Waiting for my score to come through
Desperate for some motivation
Running on fumes, checking my views
Scrolling for a comment that proves
I don't need more motivation

I'm locked in
I'm stocked up, often
I'm shopping, my face is frosted

I'm living life as if I'm already dead
I'm spilling cups and then I'm fucking the fed

I'm locked in, and topped up often
No caution, my pace is toxic
I'm living life as if I'm already dead

I'm living life, I'm living life, as if I'm already dead
I'm living life, I'm living life, as if I'm already dead

Hole in the world, holding some pearls
Making it tough 'cause I'm never enough

Hole in the earth, sleep on my perch
Take some time off to forget what you're worth? Never
