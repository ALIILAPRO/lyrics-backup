		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm like Beethoven with the bass on him
Made classic hits, I went pop
Deaf to the hate, I won't stop
Unless you're talking keys and scales, I won't drop
You don't even need a scale to know I'm on top
Me and Mozart got bars, we got bops
Heard you writing Tiffany a whole symphony
You a simp to me, but go off

All we make are masterpieces, Für Elise
Gon' hit like rump-pu-pum-pum
Y'all a fifth of me like the symphony
Your careers are dun-dun-dun-done
I'm like Beethoven with the bass on it
Ain't have to spit to make bops
Made the Oprah pop when that 'Toven drops
Singing like na-na-na-na-na-na, na-na

Dropped centuries ago and still on
Presidential drip from G Washington
Shout out to him, that wig strong
If you think you're playing me, you need major keys
You're still minor leagues, ya ain't Bron
Dissed Mozart in that one chord
Now he wants smoke, so it's on

Call me dramatic, guess they ain't wrong
Deafened to the hate and fake, and that's law
That classical brings that capital
I just copped Napoleon ones
Riding with my stallion and I'm gone
Got more hits than mama gives when grades come
Gotta get the plague to be sick as us
Ninety-nine problems, my pitch ain't one

You ain't toe to toe with 'Toven
The next Johann, call me 2Bach
Constitutional drip on 'em
A major G, watch your tone here
You're candle lit, I'm sun glowing
I ain't got the time, message pigeon prime
Just to get the bars fly on 'em
Ten dollars a show, I'm rolling

And if Mozart comes at me with the diss track
Got quick hands that can really get his wig snatched
Note for note, key battle, you can risk that
Oprah smoke, ba da bap, make you sit back, uh
All the bad madams write and show love
I'm a big player, more ways than one
When I drop my stick, it hits, goes dum-dum

I'm like Beethoven with the bass on him
Made classic hits, I went pop
Deaf to the hate, I won't stop
Unless you're talking keys and scales, I won't drop
You don't even need a scale to know I'm on top
Me and Mozart got bars, we got bops
Heard you writing Tiffany a whole symphony
You a simp to me, but go off

All we make are masterpieces, Für Elise
Gon' hit like rump-pu-pum-pum
Y'all a fifth of me like the symphony
Your careers are dun-dun-dun-done
I'm like Beethoven with the bass on it
Ain't have to spit to make bops
Made the Oprah pop when that 'Toven drops
Singing like na-na-na-na-na-na

Shoot, I'm Bassthoven, no debate on it
Made viral hits before Vine
Old songs ahead of your time
Came into the future, y'all still behind
Had to use a feather pen to write bars this fly
Me and Mozart got beef, his wig dry
Heard you're writing Tiffany a whole symphony
You a simp, a phony, no lie

All we make are masterpieces, Für Elise
Gon' hit like rum-pu-pum-pum
Y'all a fifth of me like the symphony
Your careers are dun-dun-dun-done
Shoot, I'm Bassthoven, no debate on it
Made viral hits before Vine
Made the Oprah hype when they heard my line
Singing like na-na-na-na-na-na, na-na
