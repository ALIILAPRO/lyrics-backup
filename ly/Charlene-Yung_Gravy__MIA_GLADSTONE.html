		  (Oh, baby)

Gravy, what's it take to be your lady?
I'm tryna have my baby with Gravy, 'cause lately, ah
Gravy, what's it take to be your lady?
I'm tryna have my baby with Gravy, oh yeah, yeah (so sweet, oh)

Ayy, Gravy, how you gon' do that?
Walk up in this bitch, they like, "Oh shit, who that?"
It's Gravy, Gravy get up in it
I come through, I hit it, I pull up on your mama like Stacy's
Gravy on the come up, I hit it 'til the sun up
Gravy just met her at Macy's
I pull up and I write your bitch a letter, ayy
I said, "Hey, pretty lady
I could pull up to your crib with the Bailey's
We could watch some Martin Scorsese
I drop an extra dollar for the HD, baby" (da da da)

Gravy, what's it take to be your lady?
I'm tryna have my baby with Gravy, 'cause lately, ah
Gravy, what's it take to be your lady?
I'm tryna have my baby with Gravy, oh yeah, yeah (so sweet, oh)

Ay, how come my girl's so flaky lately?
Must be hanging with Gravy daily
Were all your bitches born in the '80s? Maybe
Shit, it's all gravy, baby
Main bitch Charlene, that's my lady
I was put on the Earth to pull up and slay thee
She come and pick me up in the white Mercedes
And we bumpin' Al Green, now I'm Al Gravy

Yung Gravy
Why you so cold like the AC?
I ain't really tryna have babies
But mama, if you got a couple babies
It's okay with me

Gravy, what's it take to be your lady?
I'm tryna have my baby with Gravy, 'cause lately, ah
Gravy, what's it take to be your lady?
I'm tryna have my baby with Gravy, oh yeah, yeah (so sweet, oh)
