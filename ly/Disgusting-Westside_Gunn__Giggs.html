		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Grrrr (boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom)
Grrrr, grrrr (boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom)
Grrrr

Ayo, yeah a nigga in the hood
But a nigga bougie though (ah)
Took a pic with Rick O
Niggas say I sold my soul
Talm' 'bout me, head to toe
You niggas is really broke (disgusting, brrt, brrt)
Yeah a nigga in the hood
But a nigga bougie though (ah)
Took a pic with Rick O
Niggas say I sold my soul (grr)
Talm' 'bout me, head to toe
You niggas is really broke (disgusting, brrt)
Flygod

Ayo, blew six figures on a beamer
Just because I like the grill (ah)
Yeah, nigga, icy still
Yeah, I fuck yo' wifey still
Neck about a half a mil'
Wear my Yeezy, Nike still (ah)
Niggas doin' headshot kills (boom-boom-boom-boom-boom)
Yeah, my shooter on the bill
Model bitch was on the pill
Fuck her outta Prada heels (ah)
Nigga worth a lot of mill's
Schwarzenegger, Richard Mille
West comin' beat this pussy
Bitch, I'm in London still
Look at me and see the real
Hundred bricks, I got to chill
Now I know how Jordan feel
Bitch, you can't afford me still
Been in Fifth for four hours
Bottle bitches pourin' still (mm)
Yeah, I push a foreign still (skrrt)
Horses on the wheel, turn one to three (whip, whip)
Flygod Coppa feel

Yeah a nigga in the hood
But a nigga bougie though (ah)
Took a pic with Rick O
Niggas say I sold my soul
Talm' 'bout me, head to toe
You niggas is really broke (disgusting, brrt, brrt)
Yeah a nigga in the hood
But a nigga bougie though (ah)
Took a pic with Rick O
Niggas say I sold my soul (mm)
Talm' 'bout me, head to toe
You niggas is really broke (disgusting, brrt, brrt)

I get money, that business challenge?
I'm twisted, a bit off Balance
And them hoes, your clique can have 'em
That juice shit, my clique brought gallons (yer)
Yeah, burn bridges
Nah, fuck that, that wasn't my buisness
Got this bitch here, I don't like pictures
For that party, I spent five figures (geez)
Good intellect, he ain't real he's just internet
I got the things on, things on deck
I'll let my bare hands ring your neck
I got the mag that's Simpson (simpson)
You brought that thing from chingford (that's right)
Told her she look mad sexy
She said she from Saint Vincent
You got friends? Just bring them
Step in the magic kingdom (yeah)
Look at the back, just spin that 'round
They know I love to spin them
I quickly make this telephone call 'cause she goin' back to Finland
None of you nerds ain't got no balls, these niggas'll wrap some minions

Yeah a nigga in the hood
But a nigga bougie though (ah)
Took a pic with Rick O
Niggas say I sold my soul
Talm' 'bout me, head to toe
You niggas is really broke (disgusting)

I'm just bein' honest
Tell 'em, tell 'em what my name is
God, on God
