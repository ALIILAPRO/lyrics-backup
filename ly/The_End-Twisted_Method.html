		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fuck you!

Three, two, one your time is up.
Shit out of luck too fucked to think to duck.
You're lookin' for me?
Well, I'm huntin' for you.
I'm ready to handle some business I'm attendin' to.
Are you ready for this shit?
You better ball up your fist bitch.
I'ma show you what I'm all about, ride out 
And do it how we do it in the south so watch out!
I've got this disease.
So stay away from me.

Fed up with all the mistakes that you made.
Not sure how much more of this I can take.
I know I'm through with you, you say fuck me?
Well I say fuck you too.

Heart beating faster than a motherfucker.
I black out when we're about to kill each other.
Served or be served I don't give a fuck.
I'm not afraid to take a beating you're the first to get stuck.
Are you ready for this shit?
You better ball up your fist bitch.
Don't believe me? Swear to God fuckin try me!
And I'll be the first to show you what you get little bitch!
I've got this disease.
So stay away from me

You want a fuckin piece of me?!?
