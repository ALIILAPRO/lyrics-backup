		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Just a crush on a beautiful girl, named Jane
J to the A to the N to the E

Just a crush on a beautiful girl, named Jane
J to the A to the N to the E

I tried to stay all the way playa when it came to game
But got benched in a sense when it came to Jane
I can't explain the deep breaths that I take in her presence
Found recollections connect to every ounce of her essence
I love her, til she join with the air up above her
Love so strong it can't be wrong for her to share with another
Long as she touch my lips and my fingers, fuck it, we swingers
Cause it's Jane that keeps me sane
For what the world gonna bring us
Can make a blind man see and forget his doctor's appointment
For her sheer enjoyment I'll even risk unemployment
Can it be? Her first name changed to Calamity
Cause if saw by the law in my car, they grabbing me
Harrassing me, asking me 'where did she come from?'
Have me see a counselor asking questions that's plumb dumb
Trying to steal my love, so now I'm constantly taking shit
Cause now three times a week they wanna test our relationship
Shit!

Things are confused inside
Gone off that mary jane
She's making love to equalize
Gone off that sexy damn Jane

Just a crush on a beautiful girl, named Jane
J to the A to the N to the E

Just a crush on a beautiful girl, named Jane
J to the A to the N to the E

Yeah, spread them legs jane, I need a head change
Coochie hairs flame colored, sweet lil red thangs
She riddles every area of my brain with deep tickles
Mary, married her, carries my pain? Nope
An angel came to me one night chillin'
Said: "I won't change you, just tame who's within that Villian"
I said: "Cool, lets lay up with the stars for a minute"
Next I know we break up roaches from cigars
We done finished
Jane doing things that made me search my soul
I's a young one, she's an old freak that cuts slow
Leave her? Right now you got a hellafied no
I guess I needs her, that double edged ledge cuts throats
I love the please-her, or pleasure, whatever call it leisure
You call her a crutch, y'all hush, I call her 'Retha
Undressin her, loving the resin upon fingertips
Its over when I roll me a Fat Lady
Now sing it, bitch

Things are confused inside
Gone off that mary jane
She's making love to equalize
Gone off that sexy damn Jane

Damn, Damn, Damn Jane
