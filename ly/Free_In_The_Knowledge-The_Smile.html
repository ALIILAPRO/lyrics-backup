		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Free in the knowledge that one day this will end
Free in the knowledge that everything is change
And this was just a bad moment
We were fumbling around
But we won't get caught like that
Soldiers on our backs
We won't get caught like that

A face using fear
To try to keep control
When we get together
Well, then who knows

If this is just a bad moment
And we are fumbling around
But we won't get caught like that
Soldiers on our backs
We won't get caught like that

I talk to the face in the mirror
But he can't get through
I said, "It's time that you deliver
We see through you"

I talk to the face in the mirror
But he can't get through
Turns out we're in this together
Both me and you
