		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're on my mind
Been there all night
I've been missing seeing my midnight queen
Come have a drink
Or maybe three
And Darling I'll make you my next victim

It's been too long to spend this night alone
I need to hear the sweet sound of your moans
Come have a ride, baby don't be so shy
I prefer girls who're not afraid to cry

I want to
Ah ah ah
To make you
Ah ah ah
You make me
Ah ah ah
In your sexy skinny jeans

I want to
Ah ah ah
To make you
Ah ah ah
You make me
Ah ah ah
In your sexy skinny jeans

It's been too long to leave me on my own
I need to hear the sweet sound of your moans
Come have a ride, baby give me your thighs
I prefer girls who're not afraid to cry

I want to
Ah ah ah
To make you
Ah ah ah
You make me
Ah ah ah
In your sexy skinny jeans

I want to
Ah ah ah
To make you
Ah ah ah
You make me
Ah ah ah
In your sexy skinny jeans

I want to
(Ooh)
Ah ah ah
To make you
Ah ah ah
You make me
(I wanna do to you the things I shouldn't wanna do)
Ah ah ah
In your sexy skinny jeans

I want to
(Ooh)
Ah ah ah
To make you
Ah ah ah
You make me
(I wanna do to you the things you make me wanna do)
Ah ah ah
In your sexy skinny jeans
