		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Spiders in the night
Creeping 'round the walls
Now you'll feel him
Crawling over you

Creepy crawly things
Filling up your bed
Soon you'll feel him
Crawling through your brains

You think he's there
Beware his bite
But when you look
The spider's not in sight

Spiders reappear
Taking peoples names
Everything is
Taken down insane

There's no way out
And there's no key
But here's a clue
The spider's really me

You're written in his book
The spider won't forget
You won't forget
The spiders in the night

The end is going night
Itsy witsy friends
The spiders disappearing
From the night

You think he's gone
You think he's dead
There's no escape
The spider's in your head

All the spiders in the night
All the spiders in the night
All the spiders in the night
