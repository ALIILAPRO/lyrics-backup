		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  Teach me to let go

I'm overrated and insecure
I keep on running but there's never a door

Nothing's changed
I feel the same
So hear me out
I can dance up against the flame

I've given up on what they say is safe
I've always felt a little better this way

What's the use when nothings new?
Is there any truth?
Oh god, I'm begging you

I could use a little peace these days
Any help to sleep it all away

I'm alive but blue with distance
I'm a little too far to save
I'd ask for help but I don't deserve it
Is your world better off this way?
I can carry all the blame
I can carry all the blame

I wish I could just wake me up
Then I can just save myself from you

I know it doesn't make sense to you
It's just the empty thing I have to do

Overrated overrated
No hope
Tie me up so tie me up with no rope

So say the words that you have to say
Even though I'm not listening

I'm alive but blue with distance
I'm a little too far to save
I'd ask for help but I don't deserve it
Is your world better off this way?
I can carry all the blame
I can carry all the blame

You don't have to remind me
I know I'm a failure now
I wish you'd ignore me
'Cause I'll only bring you down

I'm the one that falls apart
I'm the one that breaks your heart
I'm living in the dark

You don't have to remind me
I fall apart
I know I'm a failure now
And break your heart
I wish you'd ignore me
I fall apart
'Cause I'll only bring you down
And break your heart
I fall apart
'Cause I'll only bring you down
And break your heart
I fall apart

Pull myself out of the lifeboat
Tie myself up with no rope
Go to Heaven with no hope
Won't you teach me to let go?

Teach me to let go
Teach me to let go
Teach me to let go

Teach me to let go
Teach me to let go
Teach me to let go

I'm alive but blue with distance
I'm a little too far to save
I'd ask for help but I don't deserve it
Is your world better off this way?
I can carry all the blame
I can carry all the blame
