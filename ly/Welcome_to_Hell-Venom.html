		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fight, we will fight right
Living low in a world of our own
Destined to live right
We're taking hell as our home
Burning lives burning
Asking me for the mercy of god
Ancient cries crying
Acting fast upon the way of the dog

Welcome to hell
Welcome to hell
Welcome to hell (hell)

Kill, we will kill, death
Masturbating on the deeds we have done
Hell commands death kill
Argue not or feel the death of sun
Burning, lives burning
Asking me for the mercy of god
Ancient cries crying
Acting fast upon the way of the dog

Welcome to hell
Welcome to hell
Welcome to hell
Welcome to hell

The Lord's my shepherd, I shall not want
He maketh me in green pastures to lie
And leaves me beside the waters in peace
Leave your souls at his feet
Kiss the flames, scorn defeat
Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I will fear no evil, for thou art with me

Die, we won't die, live
Our choice of difference is what you'll never know
Mortal voids, live, die
Buried deep beneath the fall of the snow
Burning lives ending
Asking me for the mercy of god
Ancient cries crying
Acting fast upon the way of the dog

Welcome to hell
Welcome to hell
Welcome to hell
Welcome to hell
