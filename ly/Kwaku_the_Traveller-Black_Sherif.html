		  Yeah
Kwaku killa don't lie when I say I did it, I did it (I did it, I did it)
Big stacks, big cash my way, but still I fumble it (fumble it)
Under one minute, still I can't believe
But I can't blame myself for this shit
I knew mandem was born for this shit

Of course I fucked up
Who never fuck up? Hands in the air, no hands?
Still I can't believe, you know what I mean
I was young what you expect from me?
It is what it is

But I keep going on (oh, oh, oh)
More like a rolling stone (ooh, oh)
'Cause I have no stopping time
Can't nobody stop a man
Oh, I keep going on
More like a rolling stone
'Cause I have no stopping time
Can't nobody stop a man, (yeah) no

I go dey run my race
I'm gonna keep my pace
'Cause I really have no one to blame
When I fall again
I can't stand this pain
I can't watch me fail
So anytime you pray
Remember my name

Remember you know a traveler
The name is Kwaku the Hustler
He's been far away chasing guallala
I'll be back again bro, meka menan
I swear on my life
I can't wait to be back
I know you miss me, I know

Remember you know a traveler
The name is Kwaku the Hustler
He's been far away chasing guallala
I'll be back again bro, meka menan
I swear on my life
I can't wait to be back
I know you miss me I know

They say, when it's on then it's on (it's on)
You can't stop 'til it's done (then it's on)
Sika dam na meebor
Abrantie aa masi so

Cigarette si mano
Ntampe nkoa na meetwe
Cigarette si mano
Cigarette si mano

When it's on then it's on (and it's)
I can't stop 'til it's done (and it's on)
Sika dam na meebor
Abrantie aa masi so
Cigarette si mano
Ntampe nkoa na meetwe
Cigarette si mano
Cigarette si mano

Nti daaaa (nti daaaa)
See me on the roadside (my fam)
Talking to you Most High, High, High, High

Remember you know a traveler
The name is Kwaku the Hustler
He's been far away chasing guallala
I'll be back again bro, meka menan
I swear on my life
I can't wait to be back
I know you miss me I know

Remember you know a traveler
The name is Kwaku the Hustler
He's been far away chasing guallala
I'll be back again bro, meka menan
I swear on my life
I can't wait to be back
I know you miss me I know
