		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Words of the righteous 
We will not bend 
The odds keep stacking up against 
Strengthen our self endurance 
Break down the cycle 
Of errors past 
We have to face up to the truth 
Relinquish every grudge or bruise 

Every ounce of strength grasps 
One solid dream 
Violent soul 
Will be whole 

We have to face up to it 
For every second we're alive 
Let our light shine 

To our grave, we must pave 
A path for us to rise from 
Power surge, kills the urge 
Life and death collide 

Smash all the boundaries 
That hold us down 
Hold on to everything that loves 
Let go of anything that starves 
People with envy will hold us down 
Freedom is just a cut away 
Nothing can pass our life away 

Every ounce of strength grasps 
One solid dream 
Violent soul 
Will be whole 

We have to face up to it 
For every second we're alive 
Let our light shine bright 

To our grave, we must pave 
A path for us to rise from 
Power surge, kills the urge 
Life and death collide 

We take life's ebb and flow 
Testament to the things we know 
With the fight, we must roll 
Strength will follow 
Tooth and nail for the ground that we hold 
Failures from the start but we still grow 
Heads held high, rally for throne 
Holding our own 
Not just words we'll show you so 

I can't remember 
These doubts I must dismember 
And trust in whole 

Follow your own lightness 
Follow your sound 
Believe in me 
'Cause I believe in you
