		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I hit the plug on-line
I got money waitin on my line
Issues heavy on my mind
Sometimes I can't decide
I see 4 rings when I drive
OmenXI I I got that knife
I'm in the dark all the time
In the light I can't find shit

Am I really just an outsider? Am
I really just an outsider?
Am I really just an outsider? Am
I really just an outsider?
Am I really just an outsider? Am
I really just an outsider?
Am I really just an outsider? Am
I really just an outsider?


On-line, on my mind, on my mind
Sometimes I can't decide, when I drive
Got that knife
All the time, in the light I can't find shit

I hit the plug on-line
I got money waitin on my line
Issues heavy on my mind
Sometimes I can't decide
I see 4 rings when I drive
OmenXI I I got that knife
I'm in the dark all the time
In the light I can't find shit

Am I really just an outsider? Am
I really just an outsider?
Am I really just an outsider? Am
I really just an outsider?
Am I really just an outsider? Am
I really just an outsider?
Am I really just an outsider? Am
I really just an outsider?
