		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah I crashed my car sorry that I can't be there
All those pictures on your wall will you keep them?
Feels like yesterday when I dropped you off at home
But the flowers by my grave are getting old
Yeah I crashed my car sorry that I'm not breathing
Voice shaking asking God if you can see me
The pain will fade away and you'll find another guy
Soon will come the day I don't cross your mind
Paramedics at the scene screaming
Saying that they couldn’t stop the bleeding
Took a lot of trauma to the head
Moments later said that I was dead
Dark outside, just like my windows tinted
Hit the wall, was numb within an instant
If I could’ve swerved it would be different
Sorry that I couldn’t go the distance
Can’t help but think of you
All alone in your room and you drinking too
Passed out on your bed, skipping work in the morning
Weight on your shoulders is getting enormous
And honestly this was my fault
I cannot be there to catch you whenever you fall
I’ll scream out to you when you call
But you’ll never hear me, I’m sorry I ruined it all
Yeah I crashed my car sorry that I can't be there
All those pictures on your wall will you keep them?
Feels like yesterday when I dropped you off at home
But the flowers by my grave are getting old
Yeah I crashed my car sorry that I'm not breathing
Voice shaking asking God if you can see me
The pain will fade away and you'll find another guy
Soon will come the day I don't cross your mind
Yeah I crashed my car sorry that I'm not breathing
Voice shaking asking God if you can see me
The pain will fade away and you'll find another guy
Soon will come the day I don't cross your mind
