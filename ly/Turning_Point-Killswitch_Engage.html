		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In these days that pass before me
There was an anxious feeling that would hold me down
Tearing me inside
Bleeding my spirits

This, this is the turning point
The rising of the day
No fear inside
This, this is the day that takes the suffering away
No more wasting time

Fix the pain that suffocates
As the best returns to turn in me
Wallowing my scars, save me
Before I break

This, this is the turning point
The rising of the day
No fear inside
This, this is the day that takes the suffering away
No more wasting time

Find the strength to maintain
Give me, give me a reason to believe
Search for truth, that will not change
Give me, give me a reason to believe

Find the strength to maintain
Give me, give me a reason to believe
Search for truth, that will not change
Give me, give me a reason to believe

Find the strength to maintain
Give me, give me a reason to believe
Search for truth, that will not change
Give me, give me a reason to believe

Find the strength to maintain
Search for truth, that will not change
