		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, huh
Yeah
I don't know nothin'
I don't know shit 'bout this
You know it's bad
It's so bad right now
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, uh, yeah, yeah (Donnie Katana)

She don't call on my phone no more (no more)
She don't text on my phone no more (no more)
And I'm still (still), in love (love), and I just want to be on my own
You don't know how I feel so just shut up (shut up)
You ain't talkin' no money so shut up (shut up)
No, give a fuck about these hoes, I don't care 'bout no more (yes)

No, no (yes), no, no (yeah, yeah, uh)
No (yeah), no (yeah), no, no (yeah)
No, no (yes), no, no (yes)
No, no, no, no

Put a bullet hole in your fuckin' head, nigga (baow)
Want you dead, nigga (dead)
Use a mop stick for the bloodshed (bup, bup, bup, bup)
I don't care about what you did (I don't care)
My shit Off-White, but it's red (yeah)
Put a pussy-ass nigga in a bed (fuck you, yo, fuck all these niggas)
(I'll never be like the rest, yeah, let's go, nigga, yeah)
It's a cruel world, what a fucked up world
When your brothers don't got your back (that's right)
It's a cruel world when these niggas want clout
But they don't wanna run for the bag (that's right) (facts)
It's a cruel world when you love that bitch
But you know that shit won't last (bitch)
It's a cruel world when they only wanna judge you
'Bout your past (fuck)
And my blade cuttin' ten feet deep (deep)
And the pain hurts when you can't breathe
Gotta live everyday lowkey (lowkey)
Head down, hoodie up, it's me (right)
I'm a G.O.a.t, I'm a wolf, you a sheep
And I make what you get in a week
You a pussy-ass nigga, not me (not me)
I'ma run you right under your teeth (yeah)

She don't call on my phone no more (no more)
She don't text on my phone no more (no more)
And I'm still (still), in love (love), and I just want to be on my own
You don't know how I feel so just shut up (shut up)
You ain't talkin' no money so shut up (shut up)
No, give a fuck about these hoes, I don't care 'bout no more (yes)

No, no (yes), no, no (yeah, yeah, uh)
No (yeah), no (yeah), no, no (yeah)
No, no (yes), no, no (yes)
No, no, no, no
