		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My mother's son, he can see that I'm done
With a world that took more than it gave
When we were young and we rose for the sun
Did you ever think twice about this game

'Cause you're my brother
I know you from before
Before we both were born
And you're my other
Never asking more
Taking all the falls

Grown in a place we were shown to make space
For the good, the humble and the kind
Then until now, you could always see how
I got scared when I felt myself unwind

'Cause you're my brother
I know you from before
Before we both were born
And you're my other
Never asking more
Taking all the falls

And you're my brother
I know you from before
Before we both were born
And you're my other
Never asking more
Taking all the falls
I know you from before
