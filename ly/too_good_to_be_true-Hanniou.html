		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Kind of funny
How nothing changed
I was waiting
Everyday
At the same old driveway
The same old bar
With the same old people you're always around
And there she was
An unfamiliar face
And then she grabbed your hand
And you pulled her close
And my world began to change
Now when all my friends are asking
Me about the boy I like
And I have to bite my tongue
Because I might even cry
It hits me even harder that i'm the biggest fool
I should've known the thought of us was way too good
Too good to be true
Ain't it funny
Now you're out there
Taking her to my favorite cities and I don't want to care
But I keep looking you up on my phone
Seeing posts of you taking her home
It seems like your mother must have never ever seen you this happy before
Now when all my friends are asking
Me about the boy I like
And I have to bite my tounge
Because I might even cry
It hits me even harder that i'm the biggest fool
I should've known the thought of us was way too good
Too good to be true
Maybe in another life
That's what I tell myself at night
I could be with you
Oh I wish that I could be with you
Maybe if the time was right
It was me to wake up by your side
Next to you
Oh the things that I would do
Because now all my friends are asking
Me about the boy I like
And I have to bite my tounge
Because I might even cry
It hits me even harder that i'm the biggest fool
I should've known the thought of us was way too good
Too good to be true
