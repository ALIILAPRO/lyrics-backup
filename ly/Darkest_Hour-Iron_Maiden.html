		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We buried our sons
We turned and fled
No growing old
The glorious dead
But we came back
Because one man said
Now on the beaches
The blood runs red

I faced them down
The only one
I stood alone
And warned the day would come
But they were wrong
Appeases every one
And not for the last time
We all stand alone

I watch the sun move away
As I embrace the night
And my black dog has it's day
For six long years, you shall not pass
Barbarians at the gates
We will overcome

Here I stand
In a serenade of glory
Naked by the throne of kings
You sowed the wind
And now you reaped the whirlwind
Before the dawn the darkest hour

The darkest hour

To blaze in glory like a dying sun
One last burning giant
'Til Jupiter moves on
Turn the ploughshares into swords
You sons of Albion awake
Defend this sacred land

Here I stand
In a serenade of glory
Naked by the throne of kings
You sowed the wind
And now you reaped the whirlwind
Before the dawn, the darkest hour

The darkest hour

Here I stand
In a serenade of glory
Naked by the throne of kings
You sowed the wind
And now you reaped the whirlwind
Before the dawn, the darkest hour

Here I stand
In a serenade of glory
Naked by the throne of kings
You sowed the wind
And now you reaped the whirlwind
Before the dawn, the darkest hour

Before the dawn, the darkest hour
