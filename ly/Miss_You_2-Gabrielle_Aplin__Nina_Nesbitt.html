So what you've been doing?
I've been loving my life, waking up on my own
Are you doing the same thing?
You can say if you like, but I don't need to know
And I, I've been wondering why we'd been wasting all this time
So what you've been doing?
I thought that I saw you, I guess I was wrong
Are you doing the same thing?
Convincing yourself you're better alone
And I could tell you how you never left my mind
Then you tell me that you miss me, and I'm like

Oh God, I miss you too
It's all I ever do
I'm coming back to you
And I won't let go
Oh God, I miss you too
We got makin' up to do
I'm coming back to you
And I won't let go again
Oh, I won't let go again

Na-na-na
Na-na-na
Na-na-na
Na-na-na

So what were you thinking?
Yeah, you got me a cab and we said we were done
And I thought that I was fine
But the days were so long, and they rolled into one
And I, I couldn't believe you were taking it in your stride, yeah
Then you tell me that you miss me, and I'm like

Oh God, I miss you too
It's all I ever do
I'm coming back to you
And I won't let go
Oh God, I miss you too
We got makin' up to do
I'm coming back to you
And I won't let go again

Na-na-na (I won't let go)
Na-na-na (oh, I won't let go again)
Na-na-na
Na-na-na

Will you be my best friend?
Will you be my last?
I need somebody who can love me like that
Will you be my best friend?
Will you be my last?
I need somebody who can love me like that

Oh God, I miss you too
It's all I ever do
I'm coming back to you
And I won't let go again

Na-na-na (won't let go again)
Na-na-na
Na-na-na (I need somebody who can love me like that)

Will you be my best friend?
Will you be my last?
I need somebody who can love me like that
Will you be my best friend?
Will you be my last?
I need somebody who can love me like that
