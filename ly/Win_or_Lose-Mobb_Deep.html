		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  "Here I go again, whether I, win' or lose" 
"Whether I, win' or lose"

Another day another dollar it's about gettin' money
Then you can give me a holla, my nose runny
I've been out in the cold, hustlin' for so long
My hands numb, but bet I feel that paper in my palm

It's like ahh shit it's on, time to go shoppin
For cars not fashion, my whips be the bomb
My clothes, be the same shit that we had on
And fuck lookin' cute, save that for the broad

It's the H-A-V-O, see-dump-and-reload
Knock knock, answer that, I'm blastin' through the peephole
Body charges, pay lawyers so we beat those
But get locked and I'm sluttin' lady C.O.'s

And we the only niggas you know, that fuck they P.O.'s
They push our files to the top, you still on parole
We got, money to roll, no time for penitentiaries
Too much dollars to fold, it's bulgin' out our jeans

"Here I go again, whether I, win' or lose"
But losin' ain't a option girl
My destination is top of the world, top of the world
"Here I go again, here I come, win' or lose"
But losin' ain't a option girl
My destination is top of the world, top of the world

Y'all like bitches the chit-chatterin
Stay not likin' a niggas but givin' dap to him
Hav' don't change for no chick, and they adapt to him
Never get cool with you niggas, I end up clappin' 'em

Aiyyo - federal note fetish, you fuck with my niggas
Franklin' and Grant, get yo' ass blammed with the quickness
Why'all niggas is finished
You overdosin' the world with that cute shit
It's time for this realness

And here I go again, lettin' the mac blow
Slugs bubble up in your stomach like lactose
I'ma date shorty, put it up in her backbone
For real, put it on her like a tractor wrapped dome, forreal

We outlive labels, and distributors
We run laps around e'ry artist on your payroll
Then hop up in a Range Rov', jet black
With the black rims, killin' yo' bitch in her a-hole uh-oh

"Here I go again, whether I, win' or lose"
But losin' ain't a option girl
My destination is top of the world, top of the world
"Here I go again, here I come, win' or lose"
But losin' ain't a option girl
My destination is top of the world, top of the world

"Here I go again, whether I, win' or lose"
"Here I go again, here I come, win' or lose"
"Win' or lose"
