		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The post hasn't made it here for days
We've been walking around every which damn way
The clouds are coming
There knocking on my window pane
They wanna know what it is
That I got planned

She'll make you feel alright
She'll make you feel okay
She'll keep you up at night
Ah, she got them honey bones
Ah, she got them honey bones
She got them
Ah, she got them honey bones
She got them honey dripping from her bones

All the finest rubies won't be enough
'Cause I've seen the gold
Fallin' from above
And the velvet walls
How the velvet falls
I see the yellow moon
She's dancing across the floor

She'll make you feel alright
She'll make you feel okay
She'll keep you up at night
Oh, she got them honey bones
Ah, she got them
Ah, she got them honey bones
Eh, it's dripping from her bones
Yeah, it's dripping from her bones

It's dripping like honey
It's dripping like gold
It's dripping like honey
It's dripping like gold
It's dripping like honey
It's dripping like gold
It's dripping like honey

Whoa, she got them honey bones
Oh, she got them
Ah, she got them honey bones
Oh, she's got them honey dripping from her bones
She got them honey bones
She'll make you feel alright
She'll make you feel alright
She'll make you feel alright
