		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  For real, for real, for real, yeah
Sleep on 'em that's Tempurpedic
Get the green like it's kale
Pockets they fat just like Kenan
Told her I love her ain't mean it
That's because I hit the meanest
You heard that I am from Mars
I heard that you was from Venus
I met that bitch in a meeting
I fucked that bitch from the meeting
I just was planning to leave her
So I just left it to Jesus, yuh yuh yuh yuh yuh
Lil Vert like Gerald
Told that girl to cheer up
Fucking that girl 'til she tear up
Heard you fucked her she embarrassed
Heard your whip Gary Barbera
For real, for real, for real?
Diamonds they wet like a seal
Diamonds wet like Navy Seal
Heard you drink lean, crack the seal
Everybody know it ain't real

You know I'm cappin' for real
Walk around with it for real
You wanna bet that my money, for real
For real, for real?
All of my diamonds for real, different color like Pharrell's
Yeah that's for real, for real, for real
You know I'm cappin' for real
Walk around with it for real
You wanna bet that my money, for real
For real, for real?
All of my diamonds for real, different color like Pharrell's
Yeah that's for real, for real, for real

Won't say no names but my niggas they pulled up
You niggas talk too much, get your mouth sewed up
Look at my chain, know it's ice 'cause it's snowing
Vivienne West but my friend looking Polo
My Gosha from Dover I drive in the Rover
Homie don't know me don't get in my moment
All that sneak dissing don't think that I ain't noticed
I left my door and I forgot to close it
Boy better keep it sealed
Fuck around, get killed
Fuck around, get drilled
Cut your hands if you steal
Whip it up like a meal
I just made me a mill'
Money jumping out my pocket
Tucking bands in my belt
Stop calling my phone
Leave me alone
I'm on TV, with the VVS, so I 3-D my stones
We really don't get along
She anemic, I'm more chill
Had to keep this shit for real
All the way to the beat build

You know I'm cappin' for real
Walk around with it for real
You wanna bet that my money, for real
For real, for real?
All of my diamonds for real, different color like Pharrell's
Yeah that's for real, for real, for real
You know I'm cappin' for real
Walk around with it for real
You wanna bet that my money, for real
For real, for real?
All of my diamonds for real, different color like Pharrell's
Yeah that's for real, for real, for real
