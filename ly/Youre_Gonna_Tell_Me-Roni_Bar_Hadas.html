		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're gonna tell me
You're gonna tell me it's over
And I don't know what to say
I can't see your face
But I can't see me alone
And now I can't be depressed
So I drink and I drink and I drink and I drink, 
I'm still thirsty.

Everybody wants harmless love
But I couldn't stand being bored
Now let's be honest
You should've left long ago.

I don't know what to write
'Cause I don't know how I feel
When I don't understand myself, 
How can you?

Everybody wants harmless love
But I couldn't stand being bored
Now let's be honest, 
I never loved you at all

I don't know what to write
'Cause I don't know how I feel
When I don't understand myself, 
How can you?
