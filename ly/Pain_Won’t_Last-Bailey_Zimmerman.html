		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Life around me's changing too fast
And you can't replace what's stuck in the past
And people you meet, they soon fade away
But if they're willing to leave don't beg them to stay

Life goes on with or without 'em
Only pain comes from thinking about 'em

Movin' on is the best way to go
When it feels like it's a one lane road
A broken path is long and it is dark
You can't see where to go when the flame won't spark
You're on the ground with scars from your past
You might be hurting now but the pain won't last
Pain won't last

Every day seems to be the same
And you can't see the sun through the pouring rain
No one to call when life gets tough
Feel so alone, man, I've had enough

Life goes on with or without 'em
Only pain comes from thinking about 'em

Movin' on is the best way to go
When it feels like it's a one lane road
A broken path is long and it is dark
You can't see where to go when the flame won't spark
You're on the ground with scars from your past
You might be hurting now but the pain won't last
Last, last, last

Movin' on is the best way to go
When it feels like it's a one-lane road
A broken path is long and it is dark
You can't see where to go when the flame won't spark
You're on the ground with scars from your past
You might be hurting now but the pain won't last
Pain won't last
Pain won't last
