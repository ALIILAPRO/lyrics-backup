		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm unfuckwitable
In a world of my own
That's why my shoulder's so cold
I'm unfuckwitable

So tired of fake friends
And fake love, you know
No time for no lie
And I'm here to show
I found a way higher
Me is all I need to be inspired
My vibe and my life are all my design
Your sentiment's irrelevant
'Cause I get down and up again
'Cause I had the time of my life

I'm just unfuckwitable
In a world of my own
That's why my shoulder's so cold
I'm unfuckwitable

Can't nobody take me home
Yeah, I'm worth my weight in gold
Forget whatever you been told
I am unfuckwitable
Unfuckwitable

They all said I wouldn't do shit
Now they all up on my new shit
Thinking we were always cool when
I was never even on your mind
Happens all the time

You probably thought
I couldn't turn water to wine
Water to wine
Happens all the time

I'm unfuckwitable
In a world of my own
That's why my shoulder's so cold
I'm unfuckwitable
