		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Silver bells, silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas day

City sidewalks, busy sidewalks 
Dressed in holiday style 
In the air there's a feeling of Christmas

Children laughing, people passing 
Meeting smile after smile
And on every street corner you'll hear

Silver bells (silver bells)
Silver bells (silver bells)
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling (ring-a-ling) 
Hear them ring (hear them ring)
Soon it will be Christmas day

Strings of street lights, even stop lights 
Blink of bright red an' green 
As the shoppers rush home with their treasures 

Hear the snow crunch, see the kids bunch 
This is Santa's big scene
And above all this bustle you'll hear

Silver bells (silver bells)
Silver bells (silver bells)
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling (ring-a-ling) 
Hear them ring (hear them ring)
Soon it will be Christmas day

Silver bells (silver bells)
Silver bells (silver bells)
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling (ring-a-ling) 
Hear them ring (hear them ring)
