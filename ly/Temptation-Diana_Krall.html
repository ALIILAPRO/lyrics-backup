		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Rusted brandy in a diamond glass
Everything is made from dreams
Time is made from honey slow and sweet
Only the fools know what it means
Temptation, temptation, temptation
I can't resist
Well I know that he is made of smoke
But I've lost my way
He knows that I am broke
But I must play
Temptation, oh temptation, temptation
I can't resist
Dutch pink and Italian blue
He's there waiting for you
My will has disappeared
Now confusion is oh so clear
Temptation, temptation, temptation
I can't resist
Temptation, temptation, temptation
I can't resist
