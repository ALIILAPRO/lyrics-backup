		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ask myself what I miss more the thought of you
Or you walking out the door
Through the late fights and loud nights, I Don't know why I even cry
I didn't know we had a love that could hurt this deep What do you expect
When you've given everything
I don't know how much my heart can take I've been trying to get by but it's fake
It's not like I would take you back
Or things would be the same
I got to give it to you, you left your mark
Now I'm trying to be ok
I've lost remembrance of your face
All the times you cursed me have filled its place
People say I'm the best they've seen
Guess man looks different when he finally breathes
But you seem closer than you ever did before
Then again we feel when the spirits poor
I don't know how much my heart can take
I've been trying to get by but it's fake
It's not like I would take you back
Or things would be the same
I got to give it to you, you left your mark
Now I'm trying to be ok
I didn't know we had a love that even went this deep
Guess its makes sense when you give her everything
You Want a fight to make yourself feel justified
But truth has a sound and its own battle cry
I hope you are somewhere not ok
Hope the memory of us haunts your brain
Don't come running back
It will never be the same
I got to give it to you love
You left your mark
I don't know how much my heart can take
I've been trying to get by but it's fake
It's not like I would take you back
Or things would be the same
I got to give it to you, you left your mark
Now I'm trying to be ok
