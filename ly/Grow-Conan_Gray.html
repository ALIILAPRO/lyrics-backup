		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I look about seventy years older
It feels like minutes but really it's hours 
The cooling pavements calling my name and
The zooming street signs don't look the same, no
Don't know why, but I think I'm ready for it
Yeah, I think I'm ready for

Running on concrete
Electricity
I finally can breathe
I think I'm ready for

Only you and me
We made it out, it seems
I made it out, it seems
I think I'm ready to

Grow, to grow
To grow, to grow

Familiar sounds
The lake holds all our secrets
Nostalgia bound
Yeah I'll take my time evolving
Dreaming of phone calls
You knew all along
The way we joked 'til we laughed our tails off

See it all unfold
An emerald life before me
Yeah I think I'm ready for

Running on concrete
Electricity
I finally can breathe
I think I'm ready for

Only you and me
We made it out, it seems
I made it out, it seems
I think I'm ready to

Grow, to grow
To grow, to grow

Yeah I see it comin', I see it comin'
Oh boy I'm runnin', oh boy I'm runnin'
I see it comin', I see it comin'
Oh boy I'm runnin'
And oh boy I'm runnin', runnin'

Grow, to grow
To grow, to grow

(Grow, to grow)
Pure reality, don't know where it'll lead
But everything's a dream
I think I'm ready for
(To grow, to grow)
Only you and me
We made it out it seems
I made it out it seems
I think I'm ready, ready
