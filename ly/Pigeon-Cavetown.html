		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Circling around the kitchen
Why has nothing changed?
Feed cucumber sandwich to a pigeon
Chippin' nail varnish on guitar strings
Got a pillow case made out of money
Feelin' pretty fake when I wake up
Tissue paper castle paper caddy
Scaly little friend's got my backup

Didn't give me time to say goodbye in
The way that I wanted to
So honey close your eyes and stay
Like you're supposed to do
Don't you wanna give me time to
Write another song for you?

Fuzzy feelin' and I miss you
Why can nothing stay the same?
Fuckin' stupid head, I'm gonna kill you
Melt all your art and drink the paint
I am not a beast, I'm not a monster
I don't care what you say
You can't have the bad guys without a hero
And I'm the only one who's got a cape

Didn't give me time to say goodbye in
The way that I wanted to
So honey close your eyes and stay
Like you're supposed to do
Don't know how I'm gonna live without
But I'll stay strong for you
