		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mmm

You're beautiful, but you don't know
Can't see what's there inside your soul
Always feelin' like you're not good enough
You wish you could be someone else
Sometimes you just can't see yourself
But I can see just who you are, who you are

You're exceptional the way you are
Don't need to change for nobody
You're incredible, anyone can see that
When will you believe that?
You are nothing but exceptional
(Yeah)

You'd never think you'd measure up
Never smart or cool, or pretty enough
Always feeling different from all the rest, oh
You feel so out of place, you think you don't fit in
I think you're perfect in the skin you're in
You're just perfect just how you are, just how you are, yeah

You're exceptional the way you are
Don't need to change for nobody
You're incredible, anyone can see that
When will you believe that?
You are nothing but exceptional
(Yeah)

If you could see the one I see when I see you
You'd know how lucky you are to be you
I see through into you (ooo)
And you are...

You're exceptional the way you are
Don't need to change for nobody
You're incredible, anyone can see that
When will you believe that? (you are...)
You're exceptional the way you are
Don't need to change for nobody
You're incredible, anyone can see that
When will you believe that?
You are nothing but exceptional
