		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One, two
One, two, three, four
Give me more lovin' than I've ever had.
Make it all better when I'm feelin' sad.
Tell me that I'm special even when I know I'm not.
Make me feel good when I hurt so bad.
Barely gettin' mad,
I'm so glad I found you.
I love being around you.

You make it easy,
It's easy as one, two, one, two, three, four.
There's only one thing, two do, three words four you.
I love you.
(I love you)
There's only one way, two say, those three words
And that's what I'll do.
I love you.
(I love you)

Give me more lovin' from the very start.
Piece me back together when I fall apart.
Tell me things you never even tell your closest friends.
Make me feel good when I hurt so bad.
Best that I've had.
I'm so glad that I found you.
I love being around you.

You make it easy,
It's easy as one, two, one, two, three, four.
There's only one thing, two do, three words four you.
I love you.
(I love you)
There's only one way, two say, those three words
And that's what I'll do.
I love you.
(I love you)

I love you
(I love you)

You make it easy,
It's easy as one, two, one, two, three, four.
There's only one thing, two do, three words four you.
I love you.
(I love you)
There's only one way, two say, those three words
And that's what I'll do.
I love you.
(I love you)

One, two, three, four
One, two, three, four I love you.
(I love you)
I love you
(I love you)
