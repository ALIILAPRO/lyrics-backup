		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (M2K)
Grrt, baow, baow, baow
Grrt, gang, gang, gang, gang
Gang, gang, gang

If we spinnin', we hittin' whoever you with, like, soon as I boom, better dip
Got a new Glock, I extended the clip, like, beam on this chop', I won't miss
Told Dougie, "I'm fiendin', bro, ain't no assist"
Told Kay-Kay, "Don't worry, I'ma do the hit"
Nigga, Dougie my brother, I'm takin' that risk, like
Fuck it, let's go take a trip
Yo, Dougz, you spin, I spin, you throw five, I throw ten
We spinnin' around like we did it again, like, fuck it, we up at his friend
Like, bitch, I'm MB, Kay Flock throw up the Trend
Two flocks, two chop's we gon' hop out again
Like fuck that, walk up on his friend, like, huh, we gon', like
Why the fuck niggas smoke with my opps, like, they do not rap what they live
He tried to run but I clicked on his mans, like, hold on, I really rap what I did
Notti gon' flock, he don't need rubber bands, like, what you think he gon' do for the cig?
Hollows start spittin', shit hit through his drip like, don't get caught up in traffic again
On parole with a chop', still movin' too hot like, and they like, "Kay done clicked it again"
On parole with a chop' still movin' too hot like, like, like
I ain't no killer don't push me, just gotta get back, if he die, then it's fuck it, look
AC just spot 'em, he got 'em, he don't want no problems so who really buggin', look
Bitches be thinkin' they hot, backin' out Henny and bitches be pop
Gotti call thotty, we gettin' the drop
If it's up then it's stuck, leave it up at the top
When you runnin' to me, bitch it's shoot or get shot
I got too many opps, we got too many chop's
Bitch, I shoot double hands and I'm clearin' the block
If they send me the addy, walk up, let it flock
La-di-da-di, I don't wanna party
Like 'em ratchet, I don't want a Barbie
Need a baddie who party like Cardi
Is you ready to ride in a heartbeat?
Smoochie, no cuffin', just eat me, I'm sorry
Jack the opps, you get put in a Marley
Me and Kay two deep, no assist
One thot, two chop's, two flocks for the hit

And you know I gotta shoot two hands (grrt)
You get hit with this heat and you catchin' a tan
Get low from the scene and then we get at his mans
We hop out the V and then hop back in the van (where you going?)
Put the shmoney on him and get shmurda if we can't get to him (shmurda)
Knocks in my pockets, I walk with a limp
Bro called tryna score but he done off the rims
He lookin at me like I know where my hands on the grip, look
He make a wrong move and I lift him, like
If my mans don't get hype, Sha pop out the cut he gon' blitz him
Took a pic and that boy did the same shit 
I pop out and you know who I came with (y'all know)
Your mans died, nigga, go and slide 
He just postin' pictures while it's rainin' (pussy)
Red dot to his face tryna off him 
How they kids wanna slide 'cause I'm tossin' (grrt)
I know they mad and they picture me dead, but I picture they big homie walkin'
I been ninety before I was one, we ain't spin, push the back to the front
They see us broke, then I aim and they run, spin again if bro miss 'til he touched
Red beam, how the fuck can I miss? (How the fuck can I miss?)
I extended my clip, like, huh (haha)
And, yeah, I heard the diss (I heard the diss) 
Talkin' all this gun shit with no hits, like
He got shot and took it on a hop, twenty-five to the LV, I get hit, like
He came home and had a kid with two thots 
I see him, I'm throwin' and kickin' his kid, like
Gun smoke, we want all that (all that, all that)
Yeah, that's them in the V, know I'm on that
Justo, wait to shoot I'm like, "Fall back"
Fuck that, grrt-da-baow now he off that, look
Hit you up then go look for who sent you
Bloody face, ski mask when I bend through, look
See a crowd Brodie back out the knock
I'm aimin' for you and whoever you next to, like
