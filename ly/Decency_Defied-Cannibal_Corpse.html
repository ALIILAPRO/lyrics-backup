		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Torn from your body,removed while you scream
Dissect to collect my blade now reams
Pieces of flesh lie by the side
Worn on my body or put on display

You mark your skin it gives you pleasure
I take your precious art, it becomes my leather

Taking your hide before you have died

Decency defied

Crudely I cut away
All are my prey
Tell me how it feels when your flesh is peeled
You are vain with your art
I desire it torn apart
With my insane hunting the removal of flesh now starts

You mark your skin, it gives you pleasure
I take your precious art, it becomes my leather

Taking your hide before you have died

Decency defied

To you a design
Now a trophy made mine
To you a design
Now a trophy made mine

I seek to find
To satisfy my fucked mind
I seek to find
To satisfy my fucked mind

Ignoring your cries
Exposing your insides
Violence defined

Torn from your body, removed while you scream
Dissect to collect, my blade now reams
Pieces of flesh lie side by side
Worn on my body or put on display

You mark your skin, it gives you pleasure
I take your precious art, it becomes my leather
Taking your hide before you have died

Decency defied
