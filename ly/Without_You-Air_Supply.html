		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No I can't forget this evening
Or your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way the story goes
You always smile but in you eyes your sorrow shows
Yes it shows

No I can't forget tomorrow
When I think of all my sorrows
When I had you there but then I let you go
And now it's only fair that I should let you know
What you should know

I can't live, if living is without you
I can't give, I can't give any more
Can't live, if living is without you
Can't give, I can't give any more

No I can't forget this evening
Or your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way the story goes
You always smile but in you eyes your sorrow shows
Yes it shows

I can't live, if living is without you
I can't give, I can't give any more
Can't live, if living is without you
Can't give, I can't give any more

I can't live, if living is without you
I can't give, I can't give any more
I can't live, if living is without you
I can't give, I can't give any more

I can't live, if living is without you
I can't give, I can't give any more
