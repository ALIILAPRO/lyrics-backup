		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Cruisin' like a private eye 
Blue sky
Can't stop as I go by 

Thought I saw a tough guy 
Pass by 
Just a small fry with a bow tie

Moving like sneaky spy 
But why
Can't stop as I go by 

Working for a tough guy
Fruit Fly 
Little guy with hair dye

Cruisin' like a private eye 
Blue sky
Can't stop as I go by 

Thought I saw a tough guy 
Pass by 
Just a small fry with a bow tie
