		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I bet you never tell them how it feels
I bet you never tell them how it feels
How it feels
I bet you never tell them how it feels
I'm confounded with the truth

Founded
Founded

You won't go fooling me twice now, baby
I'm sorry, that's the way it is
You won't go fooling me twice now, baby
I'm sorry, l'm sorry

I bet you never tell them how it feels
I'm confounded with the truth
I bet you never tell them how it feels
I'm confounded with the truth
I bet you never tell them how it feels
I'm confounded with the truth
