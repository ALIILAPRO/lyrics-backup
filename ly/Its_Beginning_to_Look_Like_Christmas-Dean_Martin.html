		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas, everywhere you go
Take a look in the five and ten glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow.
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see, is the holly that will be
On your own front door.

A pair of Hopalong boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen
And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again.

(It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go)

There's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well,
The sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow.
(It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas)
Soon the bells will start,
And the thing that will make them ring
Is the carol that you sing, right within your heart.

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see, is the holly that will be
On your own front door.
Sure it's Christmas once more.
