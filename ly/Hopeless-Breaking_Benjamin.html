		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here I lie forever
Sorrow still remains
Will the water pull me down and wash it all away
Come and take me over
Welcome to the game
Will the current drag me down and carry me away
Suddenly the light begins to fade

Hopeless
I'm falling down
Filthy
I can't wake up
I can not hold on
I will not let go
Worthless
It's over now
Guilty
There's no way out
I cannot hold on
I will not let go

Silent I go under
I am not afraid
I can see the daylight shine
And slowly drift away
Safe to say it's over
Sink into the grave
There is nothing left inside
But I am wide awake
I can hear the devil call my name

Hopeless
I'm falling down
Filthy
I can't wake up
I can not hold on
I will not let go
Worthless
It's over now
Guilty
There's no way out
I can not hold on
I will not let go
Hopeless
Hopeless

Hopeless
I'm falling down
Filthy
I can't wake up
I can not hold on
I will not let go
Worthless
It's over now
Guilty
There's no way out
I can not hold on
I will not let go
Hopeless
Hopeless
