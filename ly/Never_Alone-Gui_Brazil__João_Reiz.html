		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was afraid of getting older
Without a lover by my side
But we are all this together
Your love is getting me so high

And I no longer fear
The nights, because I hope
That I will have you here
And I know, you're the one
So I'll 

Never be alone, I'm not alone
I'll never be alone, I'm not alone

My heart was hurt And getting colder
Your love has brought me back to life
Because we're all in this together
And everything will be alright

Where You go, i follow
Where I go You go
Where I go You go

Where You go, i follow
Where You go I go
Where You go I go
