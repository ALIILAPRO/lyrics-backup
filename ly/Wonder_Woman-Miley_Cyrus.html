		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She's a wonder woman
She knows what she likes
Never know she's broken
'Cause she's always fine
She's a million moments
Lived a thousand lives
Never know she's hopeless
Only when she cries

When her favorite record's on and she's dancin' in the dark
She can't stop her eyes from wellin' up, up
She makes sure that no one's 'round to see her fall apart
She wants to be the one that never does

She's a won't-stop woman
Hours on her hands
All her pain is polished
All her tears are planned

But when her favorite record's on and she's dancin' in the dark
She can't stop her eyes from wellin' up, up
She makes sure that no one's 'round to see her fall apart
She wants to be the one that never does

She's a wonder woman
She knows what she likes
Never know she's broken
Only when she cries, mm-mm
