		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm leaving if you say so
But I won't ever let you go
Gets harder when the lights go out
I wonder how your day goes
Or if you ever feel at home
'Cause I don't ever feel that now

I miss the world when you were mine
I miss the highs and the goodbyes
'Cause I just thought you were coming back
So why you gon' do me like that?

How can I leave you in the past
When you're the best I ever had?
If you don't want me back
I'll go, but I won't
Leave you in the past

Leave you in the past
Leave you in the past
Leave you in the past

It's hard for me to cut ties
When my memory keeps you alive
I don't know when you're hot or cold
But I'm still holding on tight (holding on tight)

I miss the world when you were mine
I miss the highs and the goodbyes
'Cause I just thought you were coming back
So why you gon' do me like that?

How can I leave you in the past
When you're the best I ever had?
Got to live with that
I know
How can I leave you in the past
When you're the best I ever had?
If you don't want me back
I'll go, but I won't
Leave you in the past

Leave you in the past
Leave you in the past
Leave you in the past

I miss the world when you were mine
I miss the highs and the goodbyes
'Cause I just thought you were coming back
So why you gon' do me like that?

How can I leave you in the past
When you're the best I ever had?
If you don't want me back
I'll go, but I won't
Leave you in the past
