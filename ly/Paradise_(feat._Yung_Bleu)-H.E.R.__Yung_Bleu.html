		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Bordeux and Non Native) yeah

It's a lot of things I did wrong
But I'm hopin' you're at home
'Cause I'm movin' all alone
And I need you right now
I need you
I ain't worry 'bout the games they play
They ain't got a damn thing on you
It feel better with you

Girl, I wanna wait, yeah
(Girl, I wanna wait)
But try not to get your hopes up
'Cause I'm probably not staying
(Oh, 'cause I'm probably not staying)
I said, "I'm on my way" (I'm on my way)
Do you like when I'm top of you?
I'm on bottom today (bottom today)

You givin' me paradise
I don't think was ready
'Cause it's better than it's advertised
She ain't give it to me yet
But let me tell you that I fantasize
Every day, every day
Every day, every day
Every day (ooh)

Come on over, come and get your wishes, yeah
Don't be throwin' me the wrong signals
It's been a long time since I kissed you
It's been a long time
Hope you had that pussy on lock for me
Hope you had them bitches on block for me
I can give you what you want
I just need to know your intention
And I'ma call you when I land 
'Cause you know that I miss you (ooh)

I ain't worry 'bout the games they play
They ain't got a damn thing on you (ohh)
When you get off that plane, I'ma put it on you
I gave you something last night, you can feel in the mornin'
You making me drown, girl, I like when you rainin' and pourin'
Come put it on me, come put it on me

You givin' me paradise
I don't think you was ready
'Cause it's better than it's advertised
He ain't give it to me yet
But let me tell you that I fantasize, ooh yeah
Every day, every day (oh)
Every day (yeah), every day (yeah)
Every day, every day
