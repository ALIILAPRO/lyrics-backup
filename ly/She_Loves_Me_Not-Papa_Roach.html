		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I see her eyes
Look into my eyes
Then I realize that she can see inside my head
So I close my eyes
Thinking that I could hide
Disassociate so I don't have to lose my head
This situation is to agitation
Will she cut me off?
Will this be an amputation?

I don't know, if I care
I'm the jerk, life's not fair
Fighting all the time, this is out of line
She loves me not, loves me not
Do you realize I won't compromise
She loves me not
Loves me not

Over the past five years
I have shed my tears
I have drank my beers and watched my fears fly away
And until this day
She still swings my way
But its sad to say
Sometimes she says she loves me not
But I hesitate, to tell her I hate
This relationship, I want out today
This is over

I don't know, if I care
I'm the jerk, life's not fair
Fighting all the time, this is out of line
She loves me not, loves me not
Do you realize I won't compromise
She loves me not

Life's not fair
I'm the jerk

Line for line, rhyme for rhyme
Sometimes we be fightin' all the goddamn time
Its makin' me sick
Relationship is gettin' ill
Piss drunk stupid, mad on the real
Could you feel what I feel
What's the deal girl?
Tearing up each others world
We should be in harmony, boy and girl
That is the promise we made
Back in the day
We told each other things wouldn't be this way
I think we should work this out
Its alright baby, we can scream and shout

I don't know, if I care
I'm the jerk, life's not fair
Fighting all the time, this is out of line
She loves me not, loves me not
Do you realize I won't compromise
She loves me not
Loves me not
Life's not fair, life's not fair, life's not fair
I'm the jerk
Life's not fair

She loves me not, loves me not
