		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's a game life plays 
Makes you think you're everything they ever said you were 
Like to take some time 
Clear away everything I've planned 

Was it life I've betrayed 
For the shape that I'm in 
It's not hard to fail 
It's not easy to win 
Did I drink too much 
Could I disappear 
And there's nothing that's left but wasted tears 

There's nothing left but wasted years 

If I could change my life 
Be a simple kind of man try to do the best I can 
If I could take the sides 
I'd derail every path I could 
I'm about to die 
Won't you clear away from me give me strength to fly away 

Was it life I've betrayed 
For the shape that I'm in 
It's not hard to fail 
It's not easy to win 
Did I drink too much 
Could I disappear 
And there's nothing that's left but wasted tears 

There's nothing left but wasted years
There's nothing left but wasted years
There's nothing left but wasted years

Was it life I've betrayed 
For the shape that I'm in 
It's not hard to fail 
It's not easy to win 
Did I drink too much 
Could I disappear 
And there's nothing that's left but wasted tears 

Was it life I've betrayed 
For the shape that I'm in 
It's not hard to fail 
It's not easy to win 
Did I drink too much 
Could I disappear 
And there's nothing that's left but wasted tears 

Was it life I've betrayed 
For the shape that I'm in 
It's not hard to fail 
It's not easy to win 
Did I drink too much 
Could I disappear 
And there's nothing that's left but wasted tears
