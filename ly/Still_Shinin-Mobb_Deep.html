		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We shot the motherfuckin pack yo 
Yo to all my niggaz uncivilized to civilized 
We cook the shake move the weight across the tri state 
Them jooks niggaz bring the shook up out the crook type 
Special deliver Son it shines through your act bigger 
My Infamous Mobb get on they job 
The truth gets revealed like you W. Fard 
Some sheisty New York niggaz thirsty for chedda 
You shinin' you get your jewels taken with your Hil' sweater 
Keepin this rap fans like crack fiends 
Until we re-up, and put more Infamous up on the rap scene 
Mix the coke rhymes in greases like baking soda 
Albums of G-packs sellin cross far waters 

My Mobb pits is like dime bricks 
Satisfaction, guaranteed real shit 
Rapper Noyd, we meet you at the top kid 
And once we all on top, ain't no stoppin it 
I'm headstrong, at peace with myself like Islam 
You stupid, a hundred niggaz form around me 
Like forcefield pull out and use gun like shield 
The crew is worldwide, to think we started from the Hill 
Beware, of quiet niggaz layin in the cut (for what?) 
Patiently watchin waitin for a come up 
Get your spot took, we rob land like white man 
Plans to overthrow your whole shit by shaking your hand 
Motherfucker 

Up the ladder of success with tecs we build and destroy 
Still shinin', still climbin 
Up the ladder of success with tecs we build and destroy 
Still shinin', still climbin 
Still shinin', still climbin, check this out Son 

Nine six to the motherfuckin year two G 
The Mobb got it locked with the Master keys 
Word life combination to the safe it's on 
Get that loot motherfucker spread love well you warned 
The forty-first got the heat, for them niggaz that thirst 
Yes devine nine shine put that ass in line 
Regulate, I'm only here just to take what's mine 
Must hit combine, dangerous minds Dunn bust the outline 
A half a man generatin grands 
Kid you know how I go only fuck with fam 

That's why you're lookin from the outside in, wonderin 
How we bubblin, hustlin, break you days in 
Grimy motherfuckers, gettin info from your baby's mother 
Got her pillow talkin while that ass was sleepwalkin 
So all that bullshit you did, I know where you live 
You better be on point when you walk in the rest 
Your broke ass probably don't got a vest 
So I suggest change your location is best 
Because I'm comin through army fatigue dressed 
Blessed with hollow tips yes, to burn through your dirty ass Guess 
Yes, still shinin', still climbin 

Hey yo, yo Tommy, word break the fuck off what is you tryin? 
His faggot ass cats'll get capped for even tryin 
You tried to confront me, but only faced iron 
From holes to your shirt like Jamaican clothes 
Fuck the miss, the science of numbers is how I live 
If we ain't gettin mathetmatics somethin got to give 
Broke for your fuckin life with nowhere to live 
Is no way to live, resort to Plan be	 
Start to stickin, strong-arm robbery and ice pickin 

It's sneak vickin, it's cold outside I think it's 
Past time for me to grab the clapper and take mine 
You follow what I'm sayin it's like leadin the blind 
Tryin to voice a clear picture of this life of crime 
You slow learners'll understand in due time 
Up the ladder of success with tecs, we tryin to eat 
And put that fly shit on my back, and bless my feet 
With some new and improved, spectate or make a move 
Hesitate or regulate it's on you 
Crime nigga yo 

Up the ladder of success with tecs we build and destroy 
Still shinin', still climbin 
Up the ladder of success with tecs we build and destroy 
Still shinin', still climbin 
Still shinin', still climbin, check this out Son 

Up the ladder of success with tecs we build and destroy 
Still shinin', still climbin 
Up the ladder of success with tecs we build and destroy 
Still shinin', still climbin 
Still shinin', still climbin, check this out Son 

What? Nine six motherfucker 
The Infamous
