		  (Zombified)

The monsters aren't living under your bed
'Cause they are the voices in your head
Zombified by the lies they've said
We've become the walking dead

'Cause everybody's talking, bitch
Oh no, they'll never let go
Of something you said ten years ago
They're cancelling, cancelling you
And they won't stop 'til everybody's

Zombified 
They're pumping us with lies like it's formaldehyde
They're dead inside
It goes on and on
Let this go
When it stops we'll never know
We're hypnotized
And they won't stop 'til you're
Zombified

You better shut your mouth and bite your tongue
'Cause you don't wanna piss off anyone
We're traumatized by the damage done
Welcome to America

'Cause everybody's talking, bitch
Oh no, they'll never let go
Of something you said ten years ago
They're cancelling, cancelling you
And they won't stop 'til everybody's

Zombified 
They're pumping us with lies like it's formaldehyde
They're dead inside
It goes on and on
Let this go
When it stops we'll never know
We're hypnotized
And they won't stop 'til you're
(Zombified) Go! 

They're feeding off your broken mind
They won't die, they multiply
We've become so fucking blind
They won't stop 'til you're
Zombified
Pick it up
Oh, oh

Now everybody's zombified 
They're pumping us with lies like it's formaldehyde
They're dead inside
It goes on and on
Let this go
When it stops we'll never know
We're hypnotized

And they won't stop 'til you're
They won't stop 'til I'm
They won't stop 'til we're all
Zombified
