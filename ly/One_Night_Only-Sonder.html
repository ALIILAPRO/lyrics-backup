		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm flyin' out for the weekend
I'll be callin' you when I land
'Cause we ain't got no time to waste (ooh, ooh)
And I don't give a damn 'bout your boyfriend
He can have you when I go 
Next week, it might be Japan

I know you been thinkin' 'bout me (ooh)
Thinkin' 'bout me, thinkin' 'bout me (I know you still think about me)
Thinkin' 'bout me, thinkin' 'bout me, thinkin' 'bout me
I know you been thinkin' 'bout me (ooh)
Thinkin' 'bout me, thinkin' 'bout me
Thinkin' 'bout me, thinkin' 'bout me, thinkin' 'bout me (I'm in town)

I'm in town for one night (one night), for one night only (one night only)
I came around (I came around) to put it down for one night only (just one night)
Got a room for me and you (I got a room) for one night only
We roll around for the last time, this is one night only

I'm flyin' out for the weekend
I'll be callin' you when I'm 'round
I wanna see you face to face (ooh, ooh)
And I don't give a damn about your boyfriend
He can have you after I go
I'ma do all I can (ooh)

I know you been thinkin' 'bout me (ooh)
Thinkin' 'bout me, thinkin' 'bout me (I know you still think about me)
Thinkin' 'bout me, thinkin' 'bout me, thinkin' 'bout me
I know you been thinkin' 'bout me (ooh)
Thinkin' 'bout me, thinkin' 'bout me
Thinkin' 'bout me, thinkin' 'bout me, thinkin' 'bout me (I'm in town)

I'm in town for one night (one night), for one night only (one night only)
I came around (I came around) to put it down for one night only (just one night)
I got a room for me and you, (I got a room) for one night only
We roll around for the last time, this is one night only
