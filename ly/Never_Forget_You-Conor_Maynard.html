		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I used to be so happy But without you here I feel so low
I watched you as you left but I can never seem to let you go
'Cause once upon a time you were my everything
It's clear to see that time hasn't changed a thing
It's buried deep inside me but I feel there's something you should know

I will never forget you
You'll always be by my side
From the day that I met you
I knew that I would love you 'til the day I die
And I will never want much more
And in my heart I will always be sure
I will never forget you
And you will always be by my side 'til the day I die

'Til the day I die
'Til the day I die
'Til the day I die

Funny how we both end up here but everything seems alright, hey
I wonder what would happen if we went back and put up a fight
'Cause once upon a time you were my everything
It's clear to see that time hasn't changed a thing
So what in this world do you think could ever take you off my mind (oh I want you baby)

I will never forget you
And you'll always be by my side
From the day that I met you
I knew that I would love you 'til the day I die
I will never want much more
And in my heart I will always be sure
I will never forget you, no

I will never forget you
And you'll always be by my side
From the day that I met you
I knew that I would love you 'til the day I die
I will never want much more
And in my heart I will always be sure

Until the day I die
