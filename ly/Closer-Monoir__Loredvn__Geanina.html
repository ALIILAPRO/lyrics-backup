		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I’ve wrapped my arms around your body
Tonight I won’t let you go
And all your love, it feels so right
I won’t let you,

Bonjour love, let me get close to you now,
I just wanna give it to you, all,
Don’t you wanna live this right,
I don’t want you to leave my mind,

Don’t you run and,

Come on come on get me closer (to you)
Don’t you wanna come on over, (you do)
Come on come on get me closer (to you),
Don’t you wanna get me right now now now now,

Sunset falling in your eyes,
When you hold me, rapture,
Through the darkness of the night,
You know we light up,

Bonjour love, let me get close to you now,
I just wanna give it to you all,
Don’t you wanna live this right,
I don’t want you to leave my mind,

Don’t you run and,

Come on come on get me closer (to you)
Don’t you wanna come on over, (you do)
Come on come on get me closer (to you),
Don’t you wanna get me right now now now now

And when the night fades away,
We’re both falling,
Into a far far galaxy,
That’s made for you and me,

Bonjour love, let me get close to you now,
I just wanna give it to you all,
Don’t you wanna live this right,
I don’t want you to leave my mind,

Don’t you run and,

Come on come on get me closer (to you)
Don’t you wanna come on over, (you do)
Come on come on get me closer (to you),
Don’t you wanna get me right now now now now
