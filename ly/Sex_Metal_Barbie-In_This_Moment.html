		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Excuse me can you tell me what you've heard about my life
Maybe a dirty little fairy tale, a girl of the night
I heard that I grew up filthy, a trailer park queen
Drop out pregnant statistical teen
I know you heard about the bloody knife
About my daddy's perfect virgin and my mother's wife
You know I heard I don't belong in this game
Still you hold your hands in the air screaming my name
Let's go

Baby go ahead
I'll be your hatred and your pain
This is killing us all
I don't care if I fall
We're the dying, we are the damned

Baby go ahead
I'll be the villain you can blame
I'll be the belle of the brawl
Be the lust in us all
I'm the diva of the damned

I know I don't belong in this scene
Sex metal barbie, homicidal queen

Excuse me can you tell me the worst thing you've heard about me
Maybe that I'm a little harlot homicidal queen
You know I heard that I don't belong in this scene
Sex, metal, barbie, whore, attention fiend

You know I heard that I'm a haters dream
Low class, white trash, I'm so obscene
You know I heard that I should be ashamed
Still they hold their fists in the air screaming my name

Baby go ahead
I'll be your hatred and your pain
This is killing us all
I don't care if I fall
We're the dying, we are the damned

Baby go ahead
I'll be the villain you can blame
I'll be the belle of the brawl
Be the lust in us all
I'm the diva of the damned

I know I don't belong in this scene
Sex metal barbie, homicidal queen

So go ahead
I'll be your hatred and your pain
This is killing us all
I don't care if I fall
We're the dying, we are the damned

Baby go ahead
I'll be the villain you can blame
I'll be the belle of the brawl
Be the lust in us all
I'm the diva of the damned

I heard I don't belong in this scene
Sex metal barbie, homicidal queen
