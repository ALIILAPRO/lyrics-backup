		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dominos falling
Riot in the streets
Baby this time there's no retreat
There's no surrender

A devil is rising
A shadow from the past
Feeding the flames with fire
On the edge of fury

All the time
Running in and out of time
Hear the ticking on the countdown clocks tonight

Girl we need some, girl we need some action
If we're gonna make it like a true survivor
We need some action
If we wanna take our love away from here

We need a living passion
To believe in
Burning hearts and a brand new feeling
Action
If we're gonna make it like a true survivor

Wo oh
Calling from the ashes
The phoenix rise again
Fighting for life
For good for all that we believe in

Girl we need some, girl we need some action
If we're gonna make it like a true survivor
We need some action
If we wanna take our love away from here

We need a living passion
To believe in
Burning hearts and a brand new feeling
Action
If we're gonna make it like a true survivor

The hero stands alone
When all is said and done
The enemies have fallen one by one

All the time
Running in and out of time
Hear the ticking on the countdown clocks tonight

Girl we need some, girl we need some action
Action (action)
Action (action)
If we're gonna make it like a true survivor
We need some action (action)
If we wanna take our love away from here

We need a living passion
To believe in
Burning hearts and a brand new feeling
Action (action)
If we're gonna make it like a true survivor

True survivor, whoa oh
True survivor, oh
True survivor, true survivor
