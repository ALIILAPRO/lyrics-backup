		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She comes from silver spoon golden rule never miss Sunday Church

And I come from blue collar low dollar out here where concrete meets old red dirt

And I don't know what happened but it sure don't add up on paper

But when I close my eyes late at night you can bet I thank my maker


She keeps on loving me loves me the way I am

She's not just along for the ride she's my biggest fan

Lord it's a little piece of heaven when we lay down at night

She keeps on loving me and I keep on wondering why


She's got a wicked smile, angle eyes every guy wanting to hold her close

She's as pretty as sin like the Sun sinking down on the California coast


She keeps on loving me loves me the way I am

She's not just along for the ride she's my biggest fan

Lord it's a little piece of heaven when we lay down at night

She keeps on loving me and I keep on wondering why


And I don't know what happened but it sure don't add up on paper

And as long as she lets me I'll take her where ever she wants me to take her


She keeps on loving me, loves me the way I am

She's not just along for the ride she's my biggest fan

Lord it's a little piece of heaven when we lay down at night

She keeps on loving me and I keep on wondering why

She keeps on loving me and I keep on wondering why
