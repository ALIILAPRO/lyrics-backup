		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hook:
That's what you told me baby (x3)
You drive me crazy
(x2)

I thought I was the one
When we were together
You would take me to
Another place and time
That I could feel free
You were all that I was searching for

Bridge:
That's just when I
I thought I could lean on your for life
I thought that the sun would always shine
But you took my dreams away
I remember the lies that you told me baby

Chorus:
1 - you told me you love me, you need me
2 - you told me you never deceive me
3 - you told me you'd always be true
4 - you told me we're through
That's what you told me

That's what you told me baby
That's what you told me

Tell me was it fun
Taking my love for granted
Now I'm not the one
Everything we used to share
Has up and gone
I don't need to tell you, you were wrong

Bridge

Chorus

Hook

That's what you told me girl
Tell me no lie
Do you wanna fly super high
Super dooper high
No mistakes when I with you
Know exactly what I wanna do
Lay you down and pursue me
I'm super fly
Cos I'm super high
When I'm by your side
If you like girl
Tell me if you like
1 if you wanna
2 if you gonna
3 time to jive
4, 5 bring it live

1 - you told me you love me, you need me (you told me you love me)
2 - you told me you never deceive me (never deceive me)
3 - you told me you'd always be true (so true, so true, so true baby, baby)
4 - you told me we're through
That's what you told me (you told me)

You told me you love me, you need me (you love me, you driving me crazy)
You told me you never deceive me (you told me you love me, you driving me
crazy)
You told me you'd always be true (you told me you need me, you told me you
want me)
You told me we're through (you told me you needed me you driving me crazy)
That's what you told me

ONE
That's what you told me baby
That's what you told me baby
(Told me lies)
That's what you told me baby
You drive me crazy
THREE
