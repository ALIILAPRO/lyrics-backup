		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I gave you my heart and you broke it
But damn i don't care cause i'm home And i'm rolling
Too many potions
Here
Take it down baby it may just help Numb your emotions
I'm done with the choking
Beta
If you talk crazy the promise i will see You later
I get buckets off faders
So why would i change when i'm Blessing like all of my haters
Slide on the beat so efficiently
Shoutout yo shorty she over kissing Me
She said you lame and i treat her so Differently
It's none of my business i left her so Crippily
Said she done waiting put tip in me
Work too stressful cause nobody Tipping me
Big dubs all in my chest it's a victory
Shoutout to vicky i know that she Missing me
Buss it down like we on tik tok
I am a business and i got a big stock
Don't think about it because you gon Get hot
99 problems but one make a big flop
Bro
I messed it up
I'm jumping back on like it's double Dutch
Dodged the 1 2 but got hit with the Uppercut
Buddy going crazy but it do not Matter cause he is not
Running up
Keep it a secret don't talk so i tuck it Up
Jeans in my body A1 it's designer Stuff
I made me hot and i'm gonna keep Climbing up
Don't think
I didn't sell to the dope fiends
Too many shots and they gon green
She wanna go with the whole team
You know what i mean
Clothes stay in mint with like no Listerine
I'm a walking broom boy no mr clean
Filling up pockets to boss up the Team
Damn
Don't think
I don't serve crack but i'm taking that Green
Don't sip on purple boa i want my Spleen
Stomping on necks with my brothers And team
Buss it buss it buss it open
She wanted me because i'm super Focused
Maybe it's me or my smell is so Potent
Don't think to much imma keep on Rolling
I gave you my heart and you broke it
But damn i don't care cause i'm home And i'm rolling
Too many potions
Here
Take it down baby it may just help Numb your emotions
I'm done with the choking
Beta
If you talk crazy the promise i will see you later
I get buckets off faders
So why would i change when i'm Blessing like all of my haters
