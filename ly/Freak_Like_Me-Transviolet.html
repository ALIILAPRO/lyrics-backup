		<p>
		  Lost in a dream
I had when i was young
No i never woke up
From it
I broke a chain
I turned and ran
No i never looked back
Again

Is there anybody out there?
Hello can you hear me?
Or am i just screaming to the void?
I'm not looking for a savior
I just need somebody
Telling me I'm not in this alone

Cause i'm feeling like a creep here
Standing on the outside
Tunnel vision stares cut to the bone
I'm not looking for a savior
I just need somebody
Telling me I'm not in this alone

Is there anybody out there
Are you a freak like me?
Getting kicked out somewhere
Are you a freak like me ?
Tell me where you wanna go
And baby we'll go
You don't gotta walk that way alone
Fuck this place
We don't gotta go back there
Is there anybody?

It's all on me
Yeah everything's my fault
Locked in a bathroom stall right now
Death of a dream
It's running down my cheeks
Won't let em see me weak
Like this

Is there anybody out there?
Hello can you hear me?
Or am i just screaming to the void?
I'm not looking for a savior
I just need somebody
Telling me I'm not in this alone

Cause i'm feeling like a creep here
Standing on the outside
Tunnel vision stares cut to the bone
I'm not looking for a savior
I just need somebody
Telling me I'm not in this alone

Is there anybody out there
Are you a freak like me?
Getting kicked out somewhere
Are you a freak like me ?
Tell me where you wanna go
And baby we'll go
You don't gotta walk that way alone
Fuck this place
We don't gotta go back there
Is there anybody?
