		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, I'm headed to the mountains
I'll be back in a week or two
Don't you try to reach me, 'cause I won't pick up for you
I've got some things I need to do

Hmm-mm

Oh, I'm headed to the mountains
Where the air is sweet and new
Don't you try to reach me, 'cause I don't wanna talk to you
I've got some thinking to do

I'm trying to let go
I think it could help being alone
And I'm trying not to let you make me cry
I've spilled too many tears
And I think I deserve to be alone

And don't you try to reach me while I pick myself up and go
I've gotta do this on my own
I need to build myself a home

Oh, oh
Ooh
Oh-oh

Oh, I'm headed to the mountains
The only place I feel at peace
And I knew you'd come after me, so I threw away your keys
But I know you never go when I say leave
I'm headed to the mountains, don't wait up for me
