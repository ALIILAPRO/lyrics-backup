		  I can't take it anymore
I can't take it anymore
I can't take it anymore
I can't take it anymore
I can't take it anymore
I can't take it anymore
I can't take it anymore
I can't take it anymore
You are in my system
I just want you to know that, oh
You're in my system
Got me runnin' round and baby
You are in my system
I just want you to know that, oh
You're in my system
Got me runnin' round and baby
You're in my, you're in my system
You're in my, you're in my
You're in my, you're in my system
You're in my, you're in my system
You're in my system
You, you're in my system
You, you're on my mind
Oh baby, can't take it anymore
I can't take it anymore
I can't take it anymore
I can't take it anymore
I can't take it anymore
I can't take it anymore
I can't take it anymore
I can't take it anymore
I can't take it anymore
I can't take it anymore
I can't take it anymore
I can't take it anymore
