		<p>
		  If you stay for this minute
Girl, I'll never let you down
We ain't off the limit
I could hold you after now

No more talking, I don't know what you wanna do with that
If it's good, why you even wanna hold it back?
We just work and I know there's no coming back
Where you at? Where you at? Where you at?

I wanna slow dance if you're feeling me now
If we don't hold hands you'll be killing me now
I need a romance, one chance
I just wanna know, will you slow dance?
I wanna slow dance if you're feeling me now
If we don't hold hands you'll be killing me now
We need a romance (woo), one chance
I just wanna know, will you slow dance?

And do you mind if I say it?
Just wanna have you around, ooh
We take, then we give it
Something lifts us off the ground, baby

No more talk, I don't know what you wanna do with that
If it's f good, why you even wanna hold it back? (Hold it back)
We just work, so I know that there's no going back
Where you at? Where you at? Where you at? (Ohh)

I wanna slow dance if you feeling me now (if you're feeling me now)
If we don't hold hands you'll be killing me now
I need a romance (romance), one chance (one chance)
I just wanna know, will you slow dance?
I wanna slow dance if you feeling me now (if you're feeling me now)
If we don't hold hands you'll be killing me now (killing me now)
We need a romance, one chance (one chance)
I just wanna know, will you slow dance?

It won't work, it won't work, it won't work out
If we don't have a say in this world now
Taking turns, taking turns in this dance now (yeah)
I won't forget about you

(Whoa) I wanna slow dance if you feeling me now
If we don't hold hands you'll be killing me now (killing me now)
I need a romance, one chance (no, no, no, no)
I just wanna know, will you slow dance?
I wanna slow dance if you feeling me now
If we don't hold hands you'll be killing me now (killing me now)
We need a romance, one chance (one chance)
I just wanna know, will you slow dance?
