		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let's praise the love inside of us

Self hell

Can I be enlightened if my thoughts just don't align?
I have imposter syndrome and I'm sensory deprived
I know I'm kind of addicted but I'll never play that victim on myself
'Cause we all live in self hell

Everybody's got a wound like this
Everybody's got a complex deeper than it
Everybody's got their problems listed
How'd you think I read this?
You won't get it
Everybody's got social sickness
Everybody's got so sadistic
Everybody's got toxic interest
(I'm no different)

Let's praise the love inside of us
Let's praise the love inside of us
Let's praise the love inside of us
Let's praise the love, let's praise the love
Take it as it comes, there's enough misery for everyone

So sadistic

You don't know my secrets 'cause I'm not a Gemini
I know when it's good, it's so good, when it's (bad I wanna die)
They said, "I'll give you something that will help you bend your mind"
I'm like "How can I decline, I ain't no social butterfly"

You're staring at the scapegoat
You're staring at the underdog
You're looking at the change
You're staring at the firing squad
Everybody's got a wound like this
Everybody's got a complex deeper than it
Everybody's got their problems listed
(I'm no different)

Let's praise the love inside of us
Let's praise the love inside of us
Let's praise the love inside of us
Let's praise the love, let's praise the love
Take it as it comes, there's enough (self hell for everyone)

Let's praise the love

Now I wish I could say things differently
To set me apart from other lyricists
Here's a shot in the dark, I said from the start
I don't give a motherfuck about what anybody thinks of me
Never been so surrounded but felt so alone
Never been so named but I'm still unknown
I've been coughing up blood in case you didn't know
I don't a fuck what you think of me

Self hell

Let's praise the love inside of us
Let's praise the love inside of us
Let's praise the love inside of us
Let's praise the love, let's praise the love
Praise the love inside of us

Let's praise the love inside of us
Let's praise the love inside of us
Let's praise the love inside of us
Let's praise the love inside of us
Let's praise the love inside of us

Let's praise the love 'cause it's all we've got
Take it as it comes, there's enough self hell for everyone

Praise the love
