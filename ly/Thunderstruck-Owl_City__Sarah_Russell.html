		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I feel you glowing in the dark
When I collapse into your arms
I'm just a stranger in the stars

'Cause somehow it seems when I am with you
That all of my dreams begin to come true
And carefully you carry me away

I've never felt so wide awake
'Cause I'm wonder struck
I love how you take my breath away
I'm thunderstruck
To tell you the truth, I'm so afraid
That I'm out of luck
I love how you take my breath away
I'm thunderstruck

I chase the phantoms down the hall
I felt the floorboards rise and fall
I lost and never loved at all

I find in the days when you're in my dreams
The orchestra plays the prettiest themes
And carefully you carry me away

I've never felt so wide awake
'Cause I'm wonder struck
I love how you take my breath away
I'm thunderstruck
To tell you the truth, I'm so afraid
That I'm out of luck
I love how you take my breath away
I'm thunderstruck

Woah, I'm leaving the world behind
Fulfill my dreams
Oh, and my dreams are shattered
Woah, I'm over the moon tonight
Fulfill my dreams
Oh, and my dreams are shattered
'Cause somehow it seems (when I am with you)
That all of my dreams (begin to come true)
And carefully you carry me away

You take my breathe away
When I'm with you
Fulfill my dreams
And my dreams are shattered
When I look at you
My dreams are shattered
When I look at you
