		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (And this beat from Cash, not from YouTube)

I pray that I'll die before my baby (baby)
I'll take a risk if anyone tries to touch my baby
That's my love, love
I have secrets and, yes, I know you know too many
I'll stay at your house, where I'll hope that you'll protect me
You're my love, love

It's your honey (it's your honey), nice to meet you (nice to meet you)
My love's pourin' (my love's pourin') like a waterfall (like a waterfall)
(That's why) I don't mind all your dollar signs (dollar signs)
You're keepin' me up each and every night
Now I've never (I've never) felt quite like this (like this)
It's your motor, it's the way you kiss (that's my)
Tell them how we met, because you tell it best (tell it best)
You're the thing that connects my brain to my chest, it's 'cause

I pray that I'll die before my baby
I'll take a risk if anyone tries to touch my baby
That's my, mm, oh-oh, my baby (love)
I have secrets and, yes, I know you know too many (yeah)
I'll stay at your house where I'll hope that you'll protect me
You're my love, love

It's your honey (it's your honey), nice to meet you (nice to meet you)
My love's pourin' (my love's pourin') like a waterfall (like a)
Now I've never (I've never) felt quite like this (like this)
It's your motor, it's the way you kiss (it's the way you kiss)

I-I-I woke up to my shawty cryin'
I said, "Nah, I'm not bein' unfaithful, baby"
And somehow she caught me lyin' (it's the way you kiss)
I tried to say, "It weren't me, it was one of my G's, we can call the guys"
But it weren't one time, it was four or five
Long story short, we don't talk no more
Now she on TikTok doin' story times (way you kiss)
I might risk it for a biscuit
Put my hand in a jar and try reach for a cookie
Sweet, and I can't resist it (yeah)
I'm innocent until proven guilty
My girl not convinced, but I'm not convicted
I feel like a creep when I call, restricted
Pissed 'cause she blocked my digits
Leave it to God, I can't stop what's written
Of course that body still cross my mind
I'm a trap boy, and she like good yutes
If I remember correctly, I'm not her type
Cupid try aim at my heart
I jumped over the car, and tried duck and dive
Now she puttin' up pics of rapper relationships
Like it must be nice (and this beat from Cash not from YouTube, it must be nice) 

(Love, I'll die, I'll die before my baby, yeah)
(Ah, tries to touch my baby, that's my)
(Love, I'll die before my)
