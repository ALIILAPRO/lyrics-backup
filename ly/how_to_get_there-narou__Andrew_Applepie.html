		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sit by the window 
What's the Hold up 
Feels like I am Driving a car 
that has no Gears nor clutch 

Show me which way to go 
Feels like I am falling off this endless road 
Trying hard to let it go 
How do I know? 
 
Show me how I reach your side of the swell run your way and life will show you how to get there Cause I've been caught up and it's scary as hell run your way and life will show you how to get there 

Show me how I reach your side of the swell run your way and life will show you how to get there Cause I've been and it's scary as hell 

Should I try 
And swim straight through the night 
Close my eyes 
come out the otherside 
You been here all this time 
I hope you don't mind 

Lights from above yea 
Shining where you walk 
I hope that I can follow your path

Show me how I reach your side of the swell run your way and life will show you how to get there Cause I've been caught up and it's scary as hell run your way and life will show you how to get there
 
Show me how I reach your side of the swell run your way and life will show you how to get there Cause I've been caught up and it's scary as hell
 
Show me how I reach your side of the swell run your way and life will show you how to get there Cause I've been caught up and it's scary as hell run your way and life will show you how to get there 

Show me how I reach your side of the swell run your way and life will show you how to get there Cause I've been caught up and it's scary as hell run your way and life will show you how to get there
