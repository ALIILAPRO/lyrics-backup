		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh, I'd be nothing without you
Ooh, there'd be no song without you, without you
When I'm down and out
And feel like there is nothing left for me
You save me

Ooh, I feel nothing without you
Ooh, there'd be no song without you, without you
When I got into a fight and you stood right up for me
You save me, you save me

When I worry about some stupid shit
You always reassure me
You save me (you save me)

Ooh, I'd be nothing without you
Ooh, there'd be no song without you, without you

There would be no song without you
There would be no song without you
There would be no song without you
Without you, without you, without you
