		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, this a dance song for all my niggas in the club
That don't dance, just be in the back, arms folded
Blunt in the mouth, cap pulled down, just scoping everything
Namsayin, just in the cut, watching you haters
With a tone on 'em

I'm in the club posted up (up), got my arms folded
Blunt in my mouth and these haters I'm scoping, I'm just
Twisting my body from side to side (I'm just)
Twisting my body from side to side
I'm in the club posted up (up), got my arms folded
Fitted pulled down and these haters I'm scoping, I'm just
Twisting my body from side to side (I'm just)
Twisting my body from side to side (yeah)

See, ho, I don't dance (dance)
In the city where I'm from I wear the pants (wear the pants)
These bitches think they cool (cool)
I got the dick so I make the rules (make the rules)
I got a big ol' car (big ol' car)
I love a bitch with a big ol' bra (big ol' bra)
She love sucking up cum (cum)
I think I'ma give her some (some)
These niggas in here think I'm a ho (I'm a ho)
'Cause I'm quiet and ain't on the dance floor (dance floor)
But if one of 'em try me (try me)
I'ma be the new ink in his diary (diary)
I bet my click thicker than his (his)
We gon' leave him on the floor in tears (tears)
Plus I got a big tone (tone)
Y'all suckers better leave me alone

I'm in the club posted up (up), got my arms folded
Blunt in my mouth and these haters I'm scoping, I'm just
Twisting my body from side to side (I'm just)
Twisting my body from side to side
I'm in the club posted up (up), got my arms folded
Fitted pulled down and these haters I'm scoping, I'm just
Twisting my body from side to side (I'm just)
Twisting my body from side to side (yeah)

I'm in the club, I'm posted up
A nigga talk shit so talk up
If you a thug then get buck
Motherfucker, it's whatever with me 'cause
I act a fool, I act a clown
See I can dance, little buddy, I get down
You hear my music, you know my style
You know the way Hypnotize put it down
Bitch!

I thought you knew I was the man (man), d-boy off the chain (chain)
Gon' walk up to a girl, tell a bitch I'm Rick James (James)
With the diamonds in my rang (rang) and gold point fangs (fangs)
And you know I'm hood rich means I got a lil change (change)
With my thugs from the north 'cause I know they got my back
And we looking for some chickens that can work it on the track
I'm just tryna get a mil', I ain't tryna be a mack
Posted up in the club wit a pocket full of crack

I'm in the club posted up (up), got my arms folded
Blunt in my mouth and these haters I'm scoping, I'm just
Twisting my body from side to side (I'm just)
Twisting my body from side to side
I'm in the club posted up (up), got my arms folded
Fitted pulled down and these haters I'm scoping, I'm just
Twisting my body from side to side (I'm just)
Twisting my body from side to side (yeah)
