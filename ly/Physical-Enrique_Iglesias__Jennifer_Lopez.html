		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You wanna dance
you wanna move
I'm on a mission to just take you to the moon

We like to party
we're in the moon
So turn it up and let the music get you loose

We're feeling high
Gimme that bass
Just get them drinks and put your hand up in the air

You know you want me
So make a move
Come over here and show me what you're gonna do

Tonight we're going all the way
You want my lips to kiss the pain away
Body to body, we can 'cause a flame
We can ignite, ignite, ignite

Tonight we're going all the way
You want my lips to kiss the pain away
Body to body, we can 'cause a flame
We can ignite, ignite, ignite

We're gettin' physical, physical, physical, oh, physical, physical
We're gettin' physical, physical, physical, oh, physical, physical

You make me fly
I'm losing my head
Don't let me come down, pump it up until the end

The club is bumping
Blow up the roof
So never mind if we all get a little rude

Move to the right
Move to the left
Now back it up you know just what you gonna get

You know you like it
I know you do
So turn it up and let the beat just get you loose

Tonight we're going all the way
You want my lips to kiss the pain away
Body to body, we can 'cause a flame
We can ignite, ignite, ignite

Tonight we're going all the way
You want my lips to kiss the pain away
Body to body, we can 'cause a flame
We can ignite, ignite, ignite

We're gettin' physical, physical, physical, oh, physical, physical
We're gettin' physical, physical, physical, oh, physical, physical

You wanna dance
You wanna move
I'm on a mission to just take you to my room

Tonight we're going all the way
You want my lips to kiss the pain away
Body to body, we can 'cause a flame
We can ignite, ignite, ignite

We're gettin' physical, physical, physical, oh, physical, physical
We're gettin' physical, physical, physical, oh, physical, physical
