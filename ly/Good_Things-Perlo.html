		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Half a mile until we see the sign 
cnd I know just what to play when the moment comes  
For a while we had talked about 
Making a change, all our friends moved away 

But thinking isn't knowing 
cnd there were thoughts I never told you   
I heard good things grow slowly 
Do I want to know what's coming 

The fading lines had you driving scared  
You said you wonder why the roads are different here 
Put Holland on to try and make it real  
It's still so bizarre we never made it there 

The water you hear flowing 
From the window you keep open 
I heard good things grow slowly 
But you're the only one that showed me
