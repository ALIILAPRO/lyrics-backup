		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah (yeah, yeah) 
Rock, rock on (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Rock, rock on (ooh)
Make it sound, rock on
La-la, la-la, la-la-la, la-la (it's too easy)
They call me (yeah)
Hitmaka

Tell me I'm your favorite tonight (tonight, tonight)
And we gon' do, we gon' do everything you like (like, like)
I take you anywhere you want, even let you drive (drive, drive)
And let's get lost in our own world, make it a surprise

(Ooh) I been giving into everything you mention (mention)
(Ooh) Loving you is my only intention, oh
(Ooh) put in something know you I know you been missing
(Ooh-ooh-ooh) girl it's my mission

If I link up with you
Ooh-ooh, girl
I might change your mind
About what you think you like
Baby girl, if I link up with you
Ooh-ooh, girl
I might change your life
Baby, if I link up with you

Baby, let me raise the bar (high)
Drinks on the gent 'cause I bought the bar (ahh-ah)
Pink be the slips 'cause I bought the car
Hop in the whip with me baby, I raise up the partition
Now make a wish that's worth wishin'
Then come and get what you wishin' for (for)
And you ain't gotta deal with them suckers no more

(Ooh) I been giving into everything you mention (mention)
(Ooh) Loving you is my only intention, oh (intention)
(Ooh) put in something know you I know you been missing
(Ooh-ooh-ooh) girl it's my mission

If I link up with you
Ooh-ooh, girl
I might change your mind
About what you think you like
Baby girl, if I link up with you
Ooh-ooh, girl
I might change your life
Baby, if I link up with you
