		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Who knew doing the laundry
Could make me so happy
When I don't have to do it all alone
Who knew doing the dishes
Could lead to some kisses
I think I could do another load
Cause when you take an inconvenience
And you put a little spin on it
Somehow life becomes more adventurous
It's not an easy thing to do
To hold onto this point of view
But I still want to adventure with you
Who knew doing nothing
Could still feel like something
Let's spend another lazy afternoon
Who knew getting older
Could feel so tender
When I'm getting older with you
Cause when you take an inconvenience
And you put a little spin on it
Somehow life becomes more adventurous
It's not an easy thing to do
To hold onto this point of view
But I still want to adventure with you
Who knew it would fly by
The days and the goodnights
I don't know what I'll do without you
I hope you were happy
To spend your days with me
It won't be long, I'll see you very soon
Cause when we took an inconvenience
And we put a little spin on it
Somehow life became more adventurous
It wasn't always easy to do
To hold onto this point of view
But I was glad to adventure with you
Thank you for this adventure with you
