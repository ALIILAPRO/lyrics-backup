		  Don't talk to me, I think
Don't talk to me, I'm serious, hey
Oh-oh, you don't even know
I've been thinkin' it over
Now it's startin' to show

Oh, baby
Ain't no sense in frontin' when you know I got a thing for you
Ain't no other girls in mind, it's me and you, baby, I love you
Used to be the kind of nigga never wanna settle down (down, right now)
'Cause you changed me, baby
'Cause you changed me, baby
'Cause you changed me, baby
'Cause you changed me, baby
Yeah, you changed me, baby

Said I'd never settle down
I'm with you, girl, look at me now
'Cause you changed me, baby
I be a player for life
You switched that all up in one night
Oh, baby
Ain't no sense in frontin' when you know I got a thing for you
Ain't no other girls in mind it's me and you, baby, I love you (baby, I love you, love)
Used to be the kind of nigga never wanna settle down (down, right now)

You put it on me, baby, not just the physical
You mentally stimulate me, I'm really in love, that's crazy
Girl, you came and saved me
You got me thinkin' 'bout us havin' us some babies
Everything about love got me like
Baby, come home and put it on me tonight
I want it right now, girl, I can't even lie
Fuck them other girls, they ain't you (fuck them other girls, they ain't you)
You're the only one I need and that's the truth

Oh, baby
Ain't no sense in frontin' when you know I got a thing for you
Ain't no other girls in mind, it's me and you, baby, I love you (ooh)
Used to be the kind of nigga never wanna settle down (down, right now, oh)
'Cause you changed me, baby (been searchin' for the answers, babe)
'Cause you changed me, baby (never met a girl that made my life as good as you)
'Cause you changed me, baby 
(You don't want just someone in, you wanna have my kids, you wanna see me win)
Girl, it ain't just me (huh) 
Tell 'em how you feel, Breezy

You know what I'm missin', fiendin' for your kisses
All night on my phone, when you talk, I listen
Sexin' all in the kitchen, breakin' all of these dishes
Your crib or my bed, it don't make a difference
I'm lickin' on your body, girl, I'm feelin' on your booty
Now you really wanna do the nasty
Girl, I love it when you get on your knees
You make me disappear like magic
Girl, you don't even know
All the bitches I let go, haha, for you

Ain't no sense in frontin' when you know I got a thing for you (baby)
Ain't no other girls in mind (ayy, ayy), it's me and you, baby, I love you
Used to be the kind of nigga never wanna settle down (down, oh, babe ooh, right now)
'Cause you changed me, baby (all the things I used to be, I ain't no more)
'Cause you changed me, baby (who we were, who we were)
'Cause you changed me, baby (shawty, you're the changin' I've been hoping for)
'Cause you changed me, baby (ooh)
Aw, yeah, you changed me, baby (oh)

Said I'd never settle down
I'm with you, girl, look at me now (look at me now, me now)
'Cause you changed me, baby (somebody)
I be a player for life (ooh-ooh, yeah) 
You switched that all up in one night (babe)
Oh, baby
Ain't no sense in frontin' when you know I got a thing for you
Ain't no other girls in mind (huh), it's me and you, baby, I love you (baby, baby)
Used to be the kind of nigga never wanna settle down 
(Never ever wanna settle down 'til the day that you came around)
'Cause you changed me, baby

Huh, you know I've been all over the world, man
I had really gave up on this shit, you know
Finally met a girl that do for me though
It's, it's crazy, it's like a dream, I think I got me one
