		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Get a call on a random afternoon
I pick it up and I see that it's you
Like my heart, you were breaking the news
You said it's over, it's over, it's over

Heading out, 'cause I'm outta my mind
All my friends are gonna see me tonight
Staying here, 'til the sun start's to rise
And I'm, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna

Dance hard, laugh more
Turn the music up now
Party like a rock star
Can I get a what now?
I swear I'll do
Anything that I have to
'Til I forget about you.

Jump up, fall down
Gonna play it loud now.
Don't care, my head's
Spinning all around now.
I swear I'll do
Anything that I have to
'Til I forget about you.

I thought I'd be here on my own
Waiting for you to knock on my door
Since you left, I don't wait by the phone
I'm moving, I'm moving, I'm moving.

I found a place where I can't lose myself
And just leave your memory on the shelf.
See I'm fine, no I don't need nobody else
'Cause I'm, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going

Dance hard, laugh more
Turn the music up now
Party like a rock star
Can I get a what now?
I swear I'll do
Anything that I have to
'Til I forget about you.

Jump up, fall down
Gonna play it loud now.
Don't care, my head's
Spinning all around now.
I swear I'll do
Anything that I have to
'Til I forget about you.

Spending money like you don't mean a thing
I'm going crazy now I don't even think
I'm losing my mind, that's all I can do
'Til I forget about you

Dance hard, laugh more
Turn the music up now
Party like a rock star
Can I get a what now?
I swear I'll do
Anything that I have to
'Til I forget about you.

Jump up, fall down
Gonna play it loud now.
Don't care, my head's
Spinning all around now.
I swear I'll do
Anything that I have to
'Til I forget about you.

'Til I forget about you
'Til I forget about you
