		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is a plea for insurrection
This is an urgent call to arms
This is all for your protection
This is to keep you safe from harm

In every field there blooms a land mine
In every silo, crops of steel
We sow the seeds like founding fathers
We till the soil with our heels

Hey, you! Try it again!
Kick me when I'm down
Every blow is fuel for the flame
Kick me when I'm down

Hey, you! Try it again!
Kick me when I'm down
Pain is hate by a different name
Kick me when I'm down

The city smolders in the distance
I can smell the fires burn
We can't abide this fool's existence
We can't forget the lessons learned

(It's) the sharpest blade the cuts the quickest
To restore the common good
If you want to cure the sickness
You've got to spill a little blood

Hey, you! Try it again!
Kick me when I'm down
Every blow is fuel for the flame
Kick me when I'm down

Hey, you! Try it again!
Kick me when I'm down
Pain is hate by a different name
Kick me when I'm down
