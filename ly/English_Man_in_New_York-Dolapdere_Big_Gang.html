		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Come on hold my hand, 
I wanna contact the living.
Not sure I understand, 
This role I've been given.

I sit and talk to god
And he just laughs at my plans, 
My head speaks a language, I don't understand.

[Chorus]
I just wanna feel real love, 
Feel the home that I live in.
'Cause I got too much life, 
Running through my veins, going to waste.

I don't wanna die, 
But I ain't keen on living either.
Before I fall in love, 
I'm preparing to leave her.
I scare myself to death, 
That's why I keep on running.
Before I've arrived, I can see myself coming.

I just wanna feel real love, 
Feel the home that I live in.
'Cause I got too much life, 

Running through my veins, going to waste.

And I need to feel, real love
And a life ever after.
I cannot get enough.


I just wanna feel real love, 
Feel the home that I live in, 
I got too much love, 
Running through my veins, going to waste.

I just wanna feel real love, 
In a life ever after
There's a hole in my soul, 
You can see it in my face, it's a real big place.

Come and hold my hand, 
I wanna contact the living, 
Not sure I understand, 
This role I've been given

Not sure I understand.
Not sure I understand.
Not sure I understand.
Not sure I understand.
