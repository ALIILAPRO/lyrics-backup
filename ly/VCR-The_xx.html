		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You, you still have all the answers
And you, you still have them too
And we, we live half in the day time
And we, we live half at night

Watch things on VCRs, with me and talk about big love
I think we're superstars, you say you think we are the best thing
But you, you just know, you just do

When I find myself by the sea, in another's company by the sea
When I go out the pier, gonna dive and have no fear
Because you, you just know, you just do

Watch things on VCRs, with me and talk about big love
I think we're superstars, you say you think we are the best thing
But you, you just know, you just do
