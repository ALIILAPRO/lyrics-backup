		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh yeah yeah
Girl when we started 
Baby we were friends
But that's not how this fairytale is gonna end
See I was thinking 
And it clicked one day
That no one else has ever made me feel this way
Next time I saw you 
Girl I knew I had to try
To tell you everything
That I was feeling deep inside
And listen good cause what I say is from my heart
So if you're ready

[Chorus]
You see I toss and turn 
When I'm alone
And I just can't wait till you get home
Waiting for your call
Cause tonight we're gonna do it all
Girl, it's just the two of us
Cause I'm thinking 'bout you day and night
And I just can't get you off my mind
When you get a minute
Baby I was thinking we could hook up
It's just the two of us 
The two of us 
Cause in a room full of people 
You're the only one around
And nothing in this world
Could ever bring us down
Baby I'll be there
Telling you I care
This I swear
Girl it's just the two of us
The two of us

Baby I wonder if you feel the same as I do
I wonder if you're going 
Through the things I'm going through
I send you flowers on a Saturday
Inside's a letter 
With a message and no name
See I just love the feeling
Knowing I can make you smile
And I haven't felt that way
About someone in quite awhile
Just listen to these I have to say
Just take a chance

[Chorus]

It just gets better with each day
(Baby someday)
I always wanted to tell you
But I was so afraid

[Chorus]
