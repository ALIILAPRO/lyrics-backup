		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I thought I saw him on the video
A trance is keepin' him under
I know that God is in the radio
Ch-ch-ch-checking the station
The narcotic, from me to you
Just a call in the medium
I know you hear it, I hear it too
It's everywhere that I go

You come back another day
And do no wrong
You come back another day
And do no wrong
You come back another day
And do no wrong
You come back another day
And do no wrong

They say the devil is paranoid
Always tryin' to cover
But God is leaking through the stereo
Between the station to station
You believe it, I know you do
You won't admit it or say so
I know that God is in the radio
Just repeatin' a slogan

You come back another day
And do no wrong
You come back another day
And do no wrong
You come back another day
And do no wrong
You come back another day
And do no wrong
