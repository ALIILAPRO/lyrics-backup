		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It feels so good to be alive
Got all my family by my side
Couldn't wipe this black off if I tried
That's why I lift my head with pride

I got a million miles on me
They want to see how far I'll go
The path was never paved with gold (gold)
We worked and built this on our own (own)
And, and can't nobody knock it if they tried (no)
This is hustle personified
Look how we've been fighting to stay alive
So when we win we will have pride
Do you know how much we have cried?
How hard we had to fight?

(It feels so good to be alive) 
It feels so, so, so, so good
(Got all my sisters by my side) uh
I got all my sisters by my side
(Couldn't wipe this black off if I tried) whoa
Black off if I tried
(That's why I lift my head with pride) 
Uh, now we're sitting on top of the world again, ha

I got a million miles on me
They want to see how far I'll go 
(They want to see how far I'll go)
The path was never paved with gold (gold)
We fought and built this on our own 
(We fought and built this on our own, own)
And, and can't nobody knock it if they tried (no)
This is hustle personified
Look how we've been fighting to stay alive
So when we win we will have pride
Do you know how much we have cried?
How hard we had to fight?

(It feels so good to be alive) 
It feels so good, so good
(Got all my family by my side) 
And we gon' sit on top of the world again
(Couldn't wipe this black off if I tried) 
And I wouldn't trade nothing
And I wouldn't trade nothing 
(That's why I lift my head with pride)
So baby, lift your head, yeah

(It feels so good to be alive) 
Darling, it's a celebration for you, yeah
(I got the tribe all by my side) 
You're doing everything they said you couldn't do
(Couldn't wipe this black off if I tried)
(That's why I lift my head with pride) lift your head, yeah

Ooh (ooh)
(Oh)
Ooh, I tried (oh)
