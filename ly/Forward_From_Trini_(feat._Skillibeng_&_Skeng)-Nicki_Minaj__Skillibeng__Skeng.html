Yuh sih?
Fully dunce

Bruk a gyal bad like Nicki an' she
An' she forward from Trini, an' she
She, she small, broad and witty an' she
Real brave, she nuh gwan like pitney, an' she
Have a small pussy, small, slippery, an' she
Gwan wicked and me start dig it
An' she start crawb mi skin and a gwan like bitch
She gimme all style wid it, make me wan wife it
She just a bounce pon mi buddy an' she (yeah)
Tear an' scrape up mi buddy, you a make up yuh face
Me ah tear up yuh tummy, an' she
Yuh pussy so great, mi haffi love it, do yuh hair
And yuh nails, yuh nuh fava nuh duppy
Cum inna yuh mouth, mek yuh chug it
She a smile and a seh me taste like a curry
Gun inna mi waist like a police
She love bad man

Waist like a police
Gun inna yuh waist like a police
She love, she love bad man
Waist like a police
Me said di gun inna yuh waist like a
She love, she love bad man (ayo)

They gotta look to me for what's next
Too busy tryin' to tracce my footsteps
Hit up my account and send me go a shop
Bwoy, mi pussy good suh, bombo-rassclaat
Mm, hard fi get me
Hard fi left me
Hard to forget me
You get me, man, you get me
Where Trinidad, Jamaica pop shit
Guyana, Barbados inna yuh top shit
Bahamas, Saint Thomas, Turks and Caicos
Belize, Saint Kitts, Haiti and Lagos
Out in Cali, they love me, down in Valley, they love me
Out in Valley, they dumbin', out in Maui, we comin'
Poppin' out in Bengali, lookin' just like a dolly
With a pretty Somali, then hit Malawi

She love gunman in action, you got dat?
And if you nah flick batty, betta lock chat
She wan gangster fi kill her wid backshot
Gunman up inna yuh belly like hopscotch
Send it right up in deh, yuh tink mi ramp up?
Barbz and dolly me say, my name comes up
Violent, island girls, we get the thumbs up
Gunman nuh beg you a fuck, me talk straight up
Straight up, me hail and me like how yuh nails stay 
Shape good, yuh name good, gwan wid yuh ways, nuh?
Yuh man fail you, me deh yah suh fi save you
Me nuh wear cape, have gun pon mi waist too

Bruk a, bruk a gyal bad like Nicki, an' she
An' she forward from Trini, an' she
She, she small, broad and witty an' she
Real brave, she nuh gwan like pitney, an' she

Go Papa, go Papa, go Papa, go Papa
Go Papa, go Papa, go Papa, go Papa
Go Papa, go Papa, go Papa, go Papa
Go Papa, go Papa, go Papa, go Papa (brr)
