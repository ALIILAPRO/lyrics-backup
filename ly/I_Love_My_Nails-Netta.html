		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I, I love my nails
I, I love my nails
Pretty hands scratch your back
They give you chills
Coochy-coochy-coo
I love my nails

I've wasted my tears getting over you
I been diving down deep into the blue
I been diving down deep into the blue
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah)
Stupidly wasted the peak of my prime on you
You will never love me like I love you
You will never love me like I love you
(Ah-ah, ah-ah)

Baby, I don't care, 'cause
I, I love my nails
I, I love my nails
Oh my God, I can't stop looking at myself
I don't know 'bout you
I love my nails
I, I love my nails
I, I love my nails
Pretty hands scratch your back
They give you chills
Coochy-coochy-coo
I love my nails

So sad I'm drowning in desire, I could start a fire
But you will never come for me, honey
You will never come for me, honey
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah)
Down where fears and my doubts only piling up
I'm fearing, feeling all alone
I'm fearing, feeling all alone
(Ah-ah, ah-ah)

Baby, I don't care, 'cause
I, I love my nails
I, I love my nails
Oh my God, I can't stop looking at myself
I don't know 'bout you
I, I, I, I
I, I love my nails
I, I love my nails
Pretty hands scratch your back
They give you chills
Coochy-coochy-coo
I love my nails

Thought you were the sunlight
But now I know it's in me
I don't wanna love ya
I don't wanna love ya
Wash you out with water
Baby, I love my nails
I, I love my nails
I don't wanna love you or nobody else
Coochy-coochy-coo
I love my nails
