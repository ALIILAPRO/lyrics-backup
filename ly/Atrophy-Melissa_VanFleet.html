		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Atrophy, atrophy
I deteriorate
Call out the highest bidder
I turn and hang my head in shame
You think you're holy but you're a sinner
In the most evil way
Watch me wither away
As you hold me down on my knees
Disappearing at your feet
Atrophy, I deteriorate
I deteriorate, atrophy
I deteriorate
The room's dark but I can't see
Because a blindfold hides my eyes
A rope around my wrists behind me
You can't buy a human life
Wither away
As you hold me down on my knees
Disappearing at your feet
Atrophy, I deteriorate
I deteriorate, atrophy
I deteriorate
Someone please answer my prayer, my prayer
To get out of here, how was I chosen
Why put a price on me, strip me of my dignity
Inject me, collect me like I am a trophy and
Watch me wither away
As you hold me down on my knees
Disappearing at your feet
Atrophy, I deteriorate
I deteriorate
I deteriorate
I deteriorate
