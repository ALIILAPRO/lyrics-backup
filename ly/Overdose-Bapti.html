		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Started, as something I could grow and now is
Suffocating slow and I've been, better of alone

But I could never say goodbye
Blinded when I'm by your side
I don't want to see the signs
But you break me down, you break me down

Cause now you feel like an overdose, In my mind
I push away but you pull me close, with your lies
Like an overdose
Like an Overdose

Fading loosing track of days i'm waiting
Your seasons never change and Nothing
Stuck inside your ways

But I could never say goodbye
Blinded when I'm by your side
I don't want to see the signs
But you break me down, you break me down

Cause now you feel like an overdose, In my mind
I push away but you pull me close, with your lies
Like an overdose
Like an Overdose
