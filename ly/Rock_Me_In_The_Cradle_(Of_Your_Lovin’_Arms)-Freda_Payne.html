		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Come on and rock me in the cradle
Of your lovin' arms, one more time
Come on and shake me in the cradle
Of your lovin' arms, one more time
Here wrapped in your arms, I'd love to stay
But he won't set me free
I feel that it's best for us to break up
'Cause he'll never let us be
With each thought of walkin' out the door
This heart of mine needs you so much more
Deep in my heart, I still care
Before we end this love affair

Come on and rock me in the cradle
Of your lovin' arms, one more time
Come on and shake me in the cradle
Of your lovin' arms, one more time

We planned our lives dreaming of things
Me and you could never be
I made a mistake while I was young
And he's got a hold on me
He says that he would rather die
Than to see me with another guy
Give me one last moment of splendor
One last moment to remember
Rock me, baby, rock me
Come on and shake me, baby, shake me
I've loved each moment that we have shared
And I have no regrets
Sweet memories of love will stay on my mind
I know I won't forget
With each thought of walkin' out the door
This heart of mine needs you so much more
For every dream that won't come true
Let me reminisce every one with you

Come on and rock me in the cradle
Of your lovin' arms, one more time
Come on and shake me in the cradle
Of your lovin' arms, one more time

Come on and rock me, baby, rock me
Come on and shake me, baby, shake me
Come on and rock me, baby, rock me
Come on and shake me, baby, shake me
