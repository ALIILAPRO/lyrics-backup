		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The red sky fading in the distance
The peace sign burning in a vision from God
Please help me
The red sky fading in the distance
The peace sign burning like a vision from God
Please help me

No hope no hope eugh, no hope
Can we make something beautiful with no hope?

The nightmare hiding in the corner
The dead hope that you always held
Onto as a little girl
You know why everything is horror
Horror, horror
You know why no one will remember
Us in a better world

Can we make something beautiful?
For a better world? For a better world?

A moving serpentine
You see through the grapevine
Peace sign you can do whatever
I'll see you later you can do whatever

The dead hope that you always clung to
The dream that someday it would heal you
Is there anywhere left to fall?
I try so hard to recall hope ancient hope
Rotting hope
Can we make something beautiful with no hope?

Ancient hope rotting hope
Can we make something beautiful with no hope?
With no hope wIth no hope
Can we make something beautiful with no hope?
