		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Within oceans of highs
Lie this heart of mine
Within oceans of cries
Died this heart of mine

When nobody is near
I find comfort here
Soon the empty appears
Fear forging my tears

I won't agree
Don't wanna be
Wanna be anything
Other than a human being

I won't agree
Don't wanna be
Wanna be anything
Other than a human being

Picking off my flesh so you
Can't recognize me
Ripping off my head as a
Means to destroy me

Jealousy brews
In maturity's presence 
This youth I refuse
Hopeless acceptance
 
Now that I've aged 
Become more afraid 
Failing this crusade
Forsake this charade

I won't agree
Don't wanna be
Wanna be anything
Other than a human being

I won't agree
Don't wanna be
Wanna be anything
Other than a human being

Picking off my flesh so you
Can't recognize me
Ripping off my head as a
Means to destroy me

I won't agree
Just wanna be
Anything
I won't agree
Just wanna be
Anything
I won't agree
Just wanna be
Anything
I won't agree
Don't wanna be
Human Being

Picking off my flesh so you
Can't recognize me
Ripping off my head as a
Means to destroy me

Picking off my flesh so you
Can't recognize me
Ripping off my head as a
Means to destroy me
