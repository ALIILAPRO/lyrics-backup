		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Just a smile and the rain is gone
Can hardly believe it (yeah)
There's an angel standing next to me
Reaching for my heart

Just a smile and there's no way back
Can hardly believe it (yeah)
But there's an angel and she's calling me
Reaching for my heart

I know, that I'll be ok now
This time it's real

I lay my love on you
It's all I want to do
Every time I breathe I feel brand new
You open up my heart
Show me all your love, and walk right through
As I lay my love on you

I was lost in a lonely place
Could hardly believe it (yeah)
Holding on to yesterdays
Far, far too long

Now I believe it's okay cause
This time it's real

I lay my love on you
It's all I want to do
Every time I breathe I feel brand new
You open up my heart
Show me all your love, and walk right through
As I lay my love on you

I never knew that love could feel so good

Like a once in a lifetime
You change my world

I lay my love on you'.
