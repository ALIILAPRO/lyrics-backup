		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh

I've been tryna find my way to leave
Stuck in the belly of the beast
It's getting hard to breathe
Broken down, I'm turning in my sleep
Nothing is ever too steep
I'm tryna find my peace (find my peace)

'Cause I've been feeling up, down
Put out, lost counts, of every sin
Just tryna find a new way, true say
Real change, it's not too late
Fight away the darkness, new dawn, new day
Will break

I'm just holding on to happiness from all the pain from
Something beautiful (ooh, ooh, ooh)
Something beautiful (ooh, ooh, ooh)
Something beautiful (ooh, ooh, ooh)
I'm just holding on to happiness from all the pain

Drowning so much, I'm affected by the ripple
Feeling so low that I can't even see the middle
Dark days, lost ways, made me feel little (ayy)
Tryna find the words like we be playing with the riddle
I know now I've been tryna hold myself (myself)
Looking in the mirror, I don't know myself (myself)
Emotions on loan like I owe myself (what?)
Head out the window when I'm screaming for help

'Cause I've been feeling up, down
Put out, lost counts, of every sin
Just tryna find a new way, true say
Real change, it's not too late
Fight away the darkness, new dawn, new day
Will break

I'm just holding on to happiness from all the pain from
Something beautiful (ooh, ooh, ooh)
Something beautiful (ooh, ooh, ooh)
Something beautiful (ooh, ooh, ooh)
I'm just holding on to happiness from all the pain

We find the light on darker days
We seize the joy through all the pain
We feel the love, won't hesitate
Take every chance that comes our way
The little things, we appreciate
We fight for truth, a heavyweight
And every win, we celebrate
We celebrate

Something beautiful (ooh, ooh, ooh)
We find the light on darker days
We seize the joy through all the pain
Something beautiful (ooh, ooh, ooh)
We feel the love, won't hesitate
Take every chance that comes our way
Something beautiful (ooh, ooh, ooh)
The little things, we appreciate
We fight for truth, a heavyweight
I'm just holding on to happiness from all the pain
I'm something beautiful
