		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dreaming of a paradise 
And summers when i had you 
Big bear, sunny state of mind 
Red wine drunk in your room 

Oasis til our river ran dry 
Farewell honeymoon 
Learned to live with myself alright 
But i miss the shit we'd do 

100 on the 405 
Cruisers on the concrete racing to the tide 
I miss it every june 

LA LB
Everywhere you'd hold me 
Midnight car rides 
Talking 'bout our daydreams 
Was i imagining? 

Why'd you have to go 
We don't even talk anymore 
Was it something that i said 
If we were older, would this be different?
