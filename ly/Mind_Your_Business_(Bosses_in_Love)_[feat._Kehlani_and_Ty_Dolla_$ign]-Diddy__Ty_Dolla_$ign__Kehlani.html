		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We can do whatever we want, whenever we want
'Cause we motherfuckin' bosses
Bosses in love
Bosses in love

I wanna kiss you in the mouth, fuck you in the crowd
Cherry red lipstick all over your couch
You know what time it is when I pull up on you
Like beep-beep, beep-beep
This ain't no joke, it ain't no keke-keke-ke
I want your body all on me (on me)
Body all on me, yeah (oh, yeah)
Your like cinnamon, I wanna taste that
Gotta a bad real body, should break it in (break it in)

We alone and grown and so
What if people all around in the room?
We so loud even if it's soundproof
Whole town gonna hear about you, let them
No question what we're doin', we're sexin'
Even if you turn up the volume

You know what's goin' on
You know when you hear this song
Mind your business
Mind your business 'cause when I'm up in it, it's a done deal
Tell 'em mind your business
Not ready for this, don't come here

You know, ooh yeah
You know when you hear this song
You know, you
You know it's a done deal

You know the vibes with me, babe (you know)
Come over at night (night)
Leave your girls outside
They know why you spendin' time with me, babe (me, yeah)
Runnin' back for that fire (yeah)
And I keep it tight, oh
Could fit right in your lifestyle
Love that I keep your life wild (oh)
Act like we got one night, now let's ride out

Oh-oh, you know what's goin' on
You know when you hear this song
Mind your business
Mind your business 'cause when I'm up in it, it's a done deal
Tell 'em mind your business
Not ready for this, don't come here

You know, ooh yeah
You know when you hear this song
You know, you
You know it's a done deal

Done deal, but you know we not finished (no, no)
Never wanna leave every time that you visit (oh, oh)
Got you sparked off my charm
Lay back and watch you fall asleep in my arms 
Is that okay?
Love you down a hundred ways (mm, mm, mm)
DeLe√≥n and now we wavy
Should be havin' your babies
Girl, you know

You know what's goin' on (what's goin' on)
You know when you hear this song
Mind your business (yeah)
Mind your business 'cause when I'm up in it, it's a done deal (it's a done deal)
Tell 'em mind your business
Not ready for this, don't come here

You know, ooh yeah
You know when you hear this song
You know, you
You know it's a done deal

Where are we goin' when we leave here? (Woah-oh)
Give me somethin' to believe in
Make me say oh, make me say oh
Where are we goin' when we leave here? (Where do we go)
Give me somethin' to believe in (oh, oh-oh, oh)
Make me say oh, make me say oh
