		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's blood in the water
We're poisoning paradise 
If i'm going under 
(Wooh)
So are you

I'm a little fucked up but haven't gone insane
I'm high on my own supply but it's not the same
We got blood in the water
We are poisoning paradise
So take this mess and drown it in codeine

Love me 'til my heart stops
Hit me like a freight truck
Swear that I'll do anything to feel adrenaline
I get drunk on bad luck
Trippin' out on teardrops
Swear that I'll do anything to keep me falling

There's blood in the water
We're poisoning paradise 
If i'm going under
(Wooh) 
So are you
There's blood in the water
And love is a parasite
If i'm going under
(Wooh) 
So are you

I'm a little fucked up, tell me you feel the same
I'm high on my own demise, can you feed the flame?
We got blood in the water
We are poisoning paradise
So take this mess and drown it in codeine

Love me 'til my heart stops
Hit me like a freight truck
Swear that I'll do anything to feel adrenaline
(Wooh) 
So are you

Hurt people hurt people
Hurt people hurt
Hurt people hurt people
Hurt people hurt too
Hurt people hurt people
Hurt people hurt
So tell me are you fucked up too?
