		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm never gonna change your mind
And I won't ever treat you right
Never forget me, heaven accept me
I'll just go

I'm never gonna change your mind
And I won't ever treat you right
Never forget me, heaven accept me
I'll just go
Goodbye

I fell in love with you
But realized I don't want to
Sometimes we think ahead of life
I'm tellin' you it don't feel right
And even if it was good 
I didn't feel the way I should
To give you all that you deserve
But you took it bad and now I'm hurt

I said it's fine
You know I lied to keep it cool
But we'll keep bein' fools, so I
Hope you're okay, won't tell your face
'Cause you don't care
And I know you won't think that's fair, oh

I'm never gonna change your mind
And I won't ever treat you right
Never forget me, heaven accept me
I'll just go

I'm never gonna change your mind
And I won't ever treat you right
Never forget me, heaven accept me
I'll just go

The first time that we met, I thought you were the one
We were dancin' at 2 A.M. until we saw the sun
You walked into my heart, but
Hearts don't always end up in the right place
I said goodbye to the thing that I thought I loved
I can't go back to the kiss where it all begun
I see the hurt in your face and
I wish that I could wipe it all away and

And I tried so hard to want this love
We're hangin' on, but now I'm givin' up so
Trust me when I say that I've done
All that I could do
And maybe we're both just fools and I know

I'm never gonna change your mind
And we won't ever get this right
Never forget me, heaven accept me
Just let go (oh)

I'm never gonna change your mind
And I won't ever treat you right
Never forget me, heaven accept me
I'll just go
Goodbye
