		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Made a song for ya, tore my heart out
Took the photographs, cut me out
Keep my mouth shut, I keep my head down
Three words I'm cursed, I'm alone now

Made a song for ya, tore my heart out
Neighbors called the cops on me cause it's too loud
When my eyes shut, I still hear the sound
Three words I'm cursed, I'm alone now

Tattoos, covered in tattoos
To hide the scars, on her arms
I knew, deep down I knew
We'd fall apart, you'd break my heart

Don't worry, I'll be fine
You were only the love of my life
I'll be here when you decide
That you should still be mine

Made a song for ya, tore my heart out
Took the photographs, cut me out
Keep my mouth shut, I keep my head down
Three words I'm cursed, I'm alone now

Made a song for ya, tore my heart out
Neighbors called the cops on me cause it's too loud
When my eyes shut, I still hear the sound
Three words I'm cursed, I'm alone now

I can't make you want me
I loved you, I'm sorry
Three words I'm cursed, I'm alone now
Three words I'm cursed

I can't make you want me
I loved you, I'm sorry
Three words I'm cursed, I'm alone now
Three words I'm cursed

Made a song for ya, tore my heart out
Took the photographs, cut me out
Keep my mouth shut, I keep my head down
Three words I'm cursed, I'm alone now
