		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  McKenzie
I only see you when it's dark out
And these streets grow faces
With lights from bodegas
I used to kiss you on the harbor
Where all the ships roam in
There must be something in the water
That leads to romancing

Here comes the car key throw
Ice on the window
I was aiming to drive you home
Slept on the sofa the night the Hudson froze

McKenzie
I met you when you was a waitress
I can't remember what I said
But I was long-winded
I like how you can make a dollar
Stretch a real long way
I knew you when you got started
At a minimum wage

Here comes the car key throw
Ice on the window
I was aiming to drive you home
Slept on the sofa the night the Hudson froze

Everybody's coming over
To smoke and go nowhere
Once a steady conversation
Just a bunch of hot air
I don't think you listen
I don't think you listen at all
I don't think you listen
I liked you ever since I saw ya

Here comes the car key throw
Ice on the window
I was aiming to drive you home
Slept on the sofa the night the Hudson froze
