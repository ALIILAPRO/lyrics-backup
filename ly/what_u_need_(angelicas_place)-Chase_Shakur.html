		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I seen you last year
Down bet on the time I spent away
Had to get myself in place
But you seeing more of that now a-days
Yea i done seen a lot
Know sometimes we get over top
But I tell you it’s fine
i’m coming through and you mines, you mines
You better know that, know that
You saying i push back when you know i hate that

Trying to see you here alone
Knowing that we both can’t be alone
So why the fuck do we feel alone
Pull up to your spot we too grown
Know i did some things and it was too wrong
But you see me
Acting like you need me and then you don’t
Shit i got what you need
You know i’m doing me baby
You know that pain like first degree
Like are you even feeling me now a-days
Cause you play with me all the time
Don’t know if you gone stay with me all the time
Still gotta make a move money on my mind
i’m from a place they keep that tool quart for a line
