		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ayy, Suge what I tell you, nigga?
When I come out of jail what was I gonna do
I was gonna start diggin' into these niggas chest, right?
Watch this, hey Quik, let me see them binoculars, nigga
The binoculars

Hahahaha, yeah nigga, time to ride
Grab your bulletproof vest, nigga
'Cause it's gonna be a long one
Now me and Quik gonna show you niggas what it's like on this side
The real side
Now, on this ride, there's gonna be some real muthafuckas
And there's gon' be some pussies
Now the real niggas gon' be the ones with money and bitches
The pussies gon' be the niggas on the floor bleedin'
Now everybody keep your eyes on the prize, 'cause the ride get tricky
See you got some niggas on your side
That say they're your friends
But in real life, they your enemies
Then you got some muthafuckas that say they your enemies
But in real life, they eyes is on your money
See, the enemies will say they true
But in real life, those niggas will be the snitches
It's a dirty game y'all
Y'all got to be careful about who you fuck with 
And who you don't fuck with
'Cause the shit get wild y'all
Keep your mind on your riches, baby
Keep your mind on your riches

9-1-1, it's an emergency
Cowards tried to murder me
From the hood to the 'burbs, everyone of you niggas heard of me
Shit, I'm legendary niggas scary and paralyzed
Nothin' more I despise than a liar
Cowards die
My mama told me when I was a seed
Just a vicious muthafucka while these devils left me free
I proceed to make them shiver
When I deliver
Criminal lyrics
From a world wide mob figure
Thug niggas from everywhere Mr. Makaveli
Niggas is waitin' for some thug shit, that's what they tell me
So many rumors but I'm infinitely Immortal Outlaw
Switchin' up on you ordinary bitches
Like a south paw, you get left
And every breath I breathe until the moment I'm deceased
Will be another moment ballin' as a G
I rip the crowd, then I start again
Eternally I live in sin
Until the moment that they let me breathe again

The hearts of men

(No heart for the fightin')
(I was in every gang, they had about five, I was in all of 'em)
(Whichever one was winning, that's my side)

The hearts of men

(I wasn't fightin' shit)
(Nigga made me unball my fists once, show you how scared I was)
(I had my fists up, ready, he said, "Muthafucka, put your hands down")

My lyrical verse with so much pain
To some niggas it hurts
My guns bust
And if you ain't one of us
It gets worse
Bitch niggas get their eyes swole
In fly mode
I'm a homicidal outlaw
And five-o, get your lights on, the fights on
Tonight's gonna be a fuckin' fight
So we might roll
My own homies say I'm heartless
But I'm a 'G' to this until the day I'm gone that's regardless
Drive-by, niggas bow down
Thought I'd rot in jail, paid bail, well niggas out now
Throw up your hands if you thugged out
First nigga act up
First nigga gettin' drugged out
I can be a villain if ya let me
A muthafucka, if ya do upset me
Tell the cops to come and get me
Rip the crowd like a phone number
Then start again, don't have no muthafuckin' friends, nigga
Look inside the hearts of men

In the hearts of men

In the hearts of men

To all my niggas engaged in makin' money in the fifty states
Keep your mind on your chips and fuck a punk bitch
No longer livin' in fear
My pistol close in hand
Convinced that this is my year
Like I'm the chosen man
Give me my money and label me as a don
If niggas is havin' problems
Smoke 'em, fire a bomb
I died and came back
I hustle with these lyrics as if it's a game of crack
Thuggin' is in my spirit
I'm lost and not knowin'
Scarred up
But still flowin'
Energized and still goin'
Uh, can it be fate?
That makes a sick muthafucka break
On these jealous ass cowards 'cause they evil and fake
What will it take?
Give me that bass line
I'm feelin' bombed
Deathrow baby, don't be alarmed
The homie Quik gave a nigga a beat, and let me start again
Represent
'Cause I've been sent
The hearts of men
