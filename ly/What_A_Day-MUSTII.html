		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're making her smile
I know you're feeling so hot
You're a traveling soul full of desire and hope
What a day (Ahh)
What a day (Ahh)

Back in style, but in a different way
You're so much cooler than me
That's why I'm sad everyday
Oh, I've been working since I was child
But you were asking for more
What a day (Ahh)
What a day (Ahh)
What a day (Ahh)
What a day (Ahh)

A clock is ticking and the world is ending
It's a funny, foolish decay
Your house is burning and the dog is crying
But you're still much cooler than me
Not too cool to break rules at school
I know you're just asking for more
What a day (Ahh)
What a day (Ahh)
What a day (Ahh)
What a day (Ahh)

You were asking for more
Like an asshole, I complain
Now I'm trying to break the silence
Getting rid of all the pain
You were asking for more
Like an asshole, I complain
Now I'm trying to break the silence
Getting rid of all the pain
What a day (Ahh)
What a day (Ahh)
What a day (Ahh)
What a day (Ahh)

(Ahh, ahh)
What a day (Aah)

You were asking for more
Like an asshole, I complain
Now I'm trying to break the silence
Getting rid of all the pain

What a day
