		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was wondering, why you've been acting weird lately
Can you please pick up your phone?
I don't know, I don't know why you're not answering
I know you won't talk to me or anything
But, just think about this

There's only one girl for me
Come on, baby you know it
There's only one girl for me
Come on, baby you know it
There's only one girl for me, one girl for me
There's only one girl for me, one girl for me
Just give me one last chance I promise that I won't blow it

Time and time again I said I would leave you alone
Stop picking up on the phone
Knock knock on my door, no one's home
If you want me to be yours, you got to make it known
Imma make you work for it like you're on commission
Want to take me out, you better ask permission
Tell them other bitches just to mind their business
I ain't no competition

There's only one girl for me
Come on, baby you know it
There's only one girl for me
Come on, baby you know it (You're the only one for me)
There's only one girl for me, one girl for me
There's only one girl for me, one girl for me
Just give me one last chance I promise that I won't blow it

(Please) don't take it personal, but I don't want to hear it
Yes your words are pretty, the delivery's coherent
But talk is cheap, and see I've got expensive taste
Better hope that I don't catch you lying to my face
Actions speak louder than words
Go and show me what I've heard
If you don't know, you're gonna learn
Just what I deserve

There's only one girl for me
Come on, baby you know it
There's only one girl for me
Come on, baby you know it (You're the only one for me)
There's only one girl for me, one girl for me
There's only one girl for me, one girl for me
Just give me one last chance I promise that I won't blow it

I'm not that jaded baby, lately I'm just misunderstood
Stood by your window 'til the morning rose, morning wood good
Had been forever if I didn't do whatever it was
That broke the straw on top the camel's back, get over the hump
It's what I tell myself to tell you but I'm pressing my luck
Don't mean to press your buttons
Shouldn't have unbuttoned the jeans
I'd make it worse if I admit it didn't mean anything
Or maybe it's just a dream
But let me tell you one thing

There's only one girl for me
Come on, baby you know it
There's only one girl for me
Come on, baby you know it (you're the only one for me)
There's only one girl for me, one girl for me
There's only one girl for me, one girl for me
Just give me one last chance I promise that I won't blow it (yeah, you best not blow your chance)

Alright baby, I don't know what you think I was doing
But, who's going to treat you better than me?
Let's just be honest here
I heard you talking to somebody
But shit, what's really going on?
But anyway, just give me a chance
I just want to come back to you
