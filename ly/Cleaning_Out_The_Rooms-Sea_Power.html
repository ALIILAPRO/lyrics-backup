		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Where life is good in a way
Swept away upon our hearts, in cold coal ceremonial
On a rainy day, hang it up

Get the vacuum and suck it in
Cleaning out the rooms, I'll clean it up
Dark cloud, drifting out of view
I'll never know, she'll be coming soon, that is all

I'll wake up in a new life, ship shape and shoe shine

Cleaning out the rooms, I'll clean it up
She'll be coming soon
Drifting into view, way in the west, white cloud
If everybody knew, I never knew, she'll be coming soon

I'll wake up in a new life, down by the seaside
In a new life, down by the seaside

Cleaning out the room, I'll clean it up
Dark clouds, she'll be coming soon
Down the chimney, out the window, that is all
