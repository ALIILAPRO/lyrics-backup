		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All these tears I cry
Don't you wonder why
Is it all a dream
Never what it seems 

Gets under my skin
Should I let you in
Don't you think it's bad
To give me something that I never had

Every word I say
Everytime I pray
Look into my eyes
Distant voices cry

Is there light in me
Tell me what you see
You are what I have
Can't get something that I never had
Can't get something that I never had

Should I think about tomorrow oh
Should I live for just today
Take the light that burns inside you

Let it burn away
Let it burn away
Let it burn away

Will I see the day
Will I have to pay
What's inside of me
You will never see

Won't you let me in
Don't you let me see
Do you think I'm bad
'Cause I want something that I never had
'Cause I want something that I never had

Give me something that I never had
Give me something that I never had
