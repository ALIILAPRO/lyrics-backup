		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Holding my breath while you're holding the door
I love you but you're making me sad
Biting my tongue doesn't work anymore
I wonder when the apple went bad

I don't want to be the thing that wears you down 
I swear your face looks different now 
I love you
But you're making me sad

Turn into dust when the thrill doesn't thrill
I love you but you're making me sad
I don't feel much going in for the kill
Now apathy is all that we have 

I don't want to be there when the ship goes down 
My heart is beating different now 
I love you 
But you're making me sad

You're making me sad
But nowhere close to devastated
I wish that we had something worth breaking 
I'm not gonna stay here just to stick around 
Guess we're just different people now 
I love you but you're making me sad
