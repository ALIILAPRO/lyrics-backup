		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wake up, stay with me
Through the flood and through the fear
Right now I need you here
I need you to stay strong
To remind me where I came from
And where I belong
So wake up and stay with me

'Cause I'm starting to think
That I never actually had you
You're not in the dark
But far from the light
And I need to know now

Are you with me?
Are you in or are you out?
Are you with me?
Are you drifting through the doubt?
Are you in or are you out?

Don't give up, not yet
No matter how hard this gets
We come into the world
Worse for the wear
But the wars of our fathers
Are not ours to bear
Don't give up, no not yet

Are you with me?
Are you in or are you out?
Are you with me?
Are you drifting through the doubt?

We're not equal parts
Light and dark
We can be brilliant

Are you with me?
Are you in or are you out?
Are you with me?
Are you drifting through the doubt?
Are you in or are you out?
Are you in or are you out?
Are you in or are you out?

Are you with me?
