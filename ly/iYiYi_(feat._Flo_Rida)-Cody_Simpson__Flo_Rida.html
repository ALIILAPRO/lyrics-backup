		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Shorty, who dat who dat you think always missing you
I-I-I cannot get enough of kissing you
I don't cry-y-y, OK I she'd a tear, or two
On the gri-I-ind, yeah, but girl ain't no forgetting you, 'cause

Every minute, every second, every hour of the day
Iyiyi
Every hour of the day
Iyiyi
Everytime that I'm away
Iyiyi
Missing you, missing you

Every moment that is stolen, it can never be replaced
Iyiyi
Even if it's for a day
Iyiyi
I'm a text you up to say
Iyiyi
Missing you, missing you

Oh baby whenever I'm gone, I'm wishing I was back home
I can feel your heart when we're apart
Girl I'm on my way, trust every word I say
I can't wait to see your face
And when I said goodbye, I saw the tears in your eyes as you started to cry
I took your hand, and promised I'll be right back
Girl I'm coming right back to see you smile

So girl, what I gotta do to make you see
I mean what I say to you
I'll send you a picture, let you know I miss ya
Girl send me a kiss, I can't wait to see ya

Every minute, every second, every hour of the day
Iyiyi
Every hour of the day
Iyiyi
Every time that I'm away
Iyiyi
Missing you, missing you

Every moment that is stolen, it can never be replaced
Iyiyi
Even if it's for a day
Iyiyi
I'm a text you up to say
Iyiyi
Missing you, missing you

Remember when we first met, I had to tell you that
I couldn't live without your love
Baby I must confess, we were the perfect match
You we're a gift sent from above
When you're thinking about me, text 1-4-3
That means I love you girl
I'll be your everything, and all you need
Oh baby, let your heart take the lead

Ooh, so girl, what I gotta do to make you see
I mean what I say to you
I'll send you a picture, let you know I miss ya
Girl send me a kiss, I can't wait to see ya

Every minute, every second, every hour of the day
Iyiyi
Every hour of the day
Iyiyi
Everytime that I'm away
Iyiyi
Missing you, missing you

Every moment that is stolen, it can never be replaced
Iyiyi
Even if it's for a day
Iyiyi
I'm a text you up to say
Iyiyi
Missing you, missing you

Lil mama, ain't nobody else, I need you girl
I-I-I got intentions just to please you girl
And I try-y-y, lady that's what you deserve
Superfly-y-y be more precious than a pearl
I can't li-I-ie, pictures in my living room
When I ri-I-ide, dashboard, digital
To the sky-y-y, so thankful that you're in my world
Do or di-I-ie, baby, I ain't kidding you

I don't wanna be your distant man
Tellin' me I don't do enough for plans
I really can't afford to let it hit the fan
Girl, every minute I wanna hold your hand
Ain't no limit to the words I'm saying
I don't wanna rock with a brand new band
Just you, lil' mama, that's grand
I've been all over the land, and

Every minute, every second, every hour of the day
Iyiyi
Every hour of the day
Iyiyi
Everytime that I'm away
Iyiyi
Missing you, missing you

Every moment that is stolen, it can never be replaced
Iyiyi
Even if it's for a day
Iyiyi
I'm a text you up to say
Iyiyi
Missing you, missing you

Oh, yeah
I'm missing you
