		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Little blue, be my shelter
Be my cradle, be my womb
Be my boat, be my river
Be the stillness of the moon
If I could, I'd go with you
To a place I never knew
In your eyes, so dark and open
There's a light that leads me back to you

'Cause you're not so far away
I hear you say
"You'll never walk alone"
Singin'

Don't be afraid of the dark
In your heart
You're gonna find a way
To carry the weight of the world
On your shoulders
You're gonna find a way home

Little blue, be my anchor
Be my light, my compass star
Be my darkness, be my danger
Be the strings of my guitar
Little blue (little blue)
How I love you (how I love you)
Somethin' strong and somethin' true
In your arms (in your arms)
So dear and gentle
There's a home 
That leads me back to you

'Cause you're not so far away
I hear you say
"You'll never walk alone"
Singin'

Don't be afraid of the dark
In your heart
You're gonna find a way
To carry the weight of the world 
On your shoulders
You're gonna find a way
Don't be afraid of the light
It's alright
You're gonna find your way
To carry the weight of the world 
On your shoulders
You're gonna find your way home

(Find a way home)
(You're gonna find your way home)
(In your heart)
(Find a way home)
(In your heart)
(On your shoulders)
