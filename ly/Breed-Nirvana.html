		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't care, I don't care, I don't care
I don't care, I don't care, care if it's old
I don't mind, I don't mind, I don't mind
I don't mind, mind, don't have a mind

Get away, get away, get away
Get away, away, away from your home
I'm afraid, I'm afraid, I'm afraid
I'm afraid, afraid, ghost

Even if you have, even if you need
I don't mean to stare, we don't have to breed
We could plant a house, we could build a tree
I don't even care, we could have all three

She said, she said
She said, she said
She said, she said
She said, she said

I don't care, I don't care, I don't care
I don't care, care, care if it's old
I don't mind, I don't mind, I don't mind
I don't mind, mind, don't have a mind

Get away, get away, get away
Get away, away, away from your home
I'm afraid, I'm afraid, I'm afraid
I'm afraid, afraid, ghost

Even if you have, even if you need
I don't mean to stare, we don't have to breed
We can plant a house, we can build a tree
I don't even care, we could have all three

She said, she said
She said, she said
She said, she said
She said, she said

Even if you have, even if you need
I don't mean to stare, we don't have to breed
We can plant a house, we can build a tree
I don't even care, we could have all three

She said, she said
She said, she said
She said, she said
She said, she said
She said

Said, good
