		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know the answers from the words of
The prophet
I've seen the light through the fingers
Made of magic
I've seen an image of the future,
It's a vision and I know who you are

(Chorus)
Go away can't you see you're not real
Open your eye some place far away
I've seen the ocean and I've seen the sky
I've got my wings and I'm starting to fly

I met a poet tonight behind the masses
I sang a song about my many true
Addictions
I saw myself in a hole, down below
And I know who you are

(Chorus)
I'm alright though it's hard to feel
Open your eye some place far away
I've seen the ocean and I've seen the sky
I've got my wings and I'm starting to fly

Open your eyes
Look to the sky
Grab your wings
And start to fly

(Chorus)
