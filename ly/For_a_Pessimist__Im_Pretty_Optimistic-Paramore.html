		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Just talk yourself up
And tear yourself down
You've built your one wall
Now find your way around
What's the problem?
You've got a lot of nerve

So what did you think I would say?
No, you can't run away, you can't run away
So what did you think I would say?
No, you can't run away, you can't run away
You wouldn't

I never wanted to say this
You never wanted to stay
I put my faith in you, so much faith
And then you just threw it away
You threw it away

I'm not so naive
My sorry eyes can see
The way you fight shy
Of almost everything
Well, if you give up
You'll get what you deserve

So what did you think I would say?
No, you can't run away, you can't run away
So what did you think I would say?
No, you can't run away, you can't run away
You wouldn't

I never wanted to say this
You never wanted to stay
I put my faith in you, so much faith
And then you just threw it away
You threw it away

You were finished long before
We had even seen the start
Why don't you stand up, be a man about it?
Fight with your bare hands about it now

I never wanted to say this
You never wanted to stay, well did you?
I put my faith in you, so much faith
And then you just threw it away

I never wanted to say this
You never wanted to stay
And I put my faith in you, so much faith
And then you just threw it away
