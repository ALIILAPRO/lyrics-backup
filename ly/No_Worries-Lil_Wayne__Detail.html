		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Look me in my face
I ain't got no worries
I ain't got no worries
I ain't got no worries
See, them shroomies keep me up
So I ain't got no worries
I ain't got no worries
I ain't got no worries
You see money right there (yeah)
That's Tunechi right there (turn up)
Yeah, that's Mack Maine right there
And we ain't got no worries
You see pussy right there
Redbone mango's right there
See them shroomies right there (yeah)
We ain't got no worries (uh)

Tunechi in this bitch, everybody should be worried
Them pussy niggas be purrin', bitches be diggin' me, I feel buried
And if she make this dick hard, she woke up a sleepin' giant
Man, your bitch speak in tongues every time we speak in private
Hope your barber shop open 'cause we got hair triggers
Smoke so much that Smokey the Bear, have to bear with us
And that Jeep with the doors off, that means that bitch sleek
All these bitch think they're the shit, I send them up shits creek
You see Tunechi right here, give me brain ideas
It's okay if you turn up, just don't turn off my light years
All I know is I do it, what I'm smokin', I grew it
These are Blood gang, Piru it, all rats gotta die even Stuart
On my private jet is my stewardess is your bitchn nigga, bitch nigga
I know gold-diggers and ditch-diggers
You don't get dissed, you get disfigured
She say, "Sorry I didn't shave, so that pussy is a little furry"
I put that pussy in my face, I ain't got no worries, Tunechi

Look me in my face
I ain't got no worries
I ain't got no worries
I ain't got no worries
See, them shroomies keep me up
So I ain't got no worries (yeah)
I ain't got no worries (who you see?)
I ain't got no worries
You see money right there (what?)
That's Tunechi right there (yeah)
Yeah, that's Mack Maine right there (Mack)
And we ain't got no worries
You see pussy right there
Redbone mango's right there
See them shroomies right there (uh)
We ain't got no worries

We ain't got no worries
She bad as a hooker, so she ain't got no worries
She want me to eat her sugar, I say "Why you in a hurry?"
She say, "Why you askin' questions?" I say, "Bitch, you tryna be funny"
Now take your fuckin' clothes off, let me see that Donkey Kong
I swing your ass back and forth, back and forth on my monkey bar
That camel toe that camel toe, no worries no panty-hose
These niggas fallin' off like baggy clothes, I smoke more than a magic show
I swear I saw my ho, I swear she was with my ho
You know I fucked them both, sore pussy and sore throat
Bitch, it's Tunechi and I'm outchea, no worries, no worries
I would talk about my dick, but man, that shit be a long story

Look me in my face (yeah)
I ain't got no worries
I ain't got no worries (oh shit)
I ain't got no worries
See, them shroomies keep me up (I'm up)
So I ain't got no worries (yeah)
I ain't got no worries (Young Mula, baby)
I ain't got no worries
You see money right there (yeah)
That's Tunechi right there (baby)
Yeah, that's Mack Maine right there (Scoob, I see you too)
And we ain't got no worries (oh)
You see pussy right there
Redbone mango's right there
See them shroomies right there
