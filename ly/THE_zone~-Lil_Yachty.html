		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm so far gone
Can you take me back home?
I'm stuck in a zone
And I'm a million miles from

Home is only an idea
I fear it's costumes that you wear
I see clear in the atmosphere
None of my peers were really there

Sunshine and moonlights 
Make a tough time feel nice
Fun times, fun nights 
With all of y'all, it feels right
We outcasts, avoid hype
In the sunshine, we break ice
In the moonlight, escape life

In the sunshine, sunshine, sunshine, sunshine
In the sunshine, sunshine, sunshine, sunshine
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, mm-mm, mm, mm-mm-mm

I feel at home 
Up until 
I'm alone, ah
I feel at home 
Up until 
I'm alone
And you 
Always feel 
Loved until 
You are wrong
And I 
Play this song 
To come down calm 
When you are wrong

I never meant to make you feel alone
A non-chivalrous tone you've used since I got home
I feel wrong, deep down inside, I'm stoned
I feel cold and alone 
But now I know that you love me (love me)
Will you put anyone above me? 
Let me know, is this home?

Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, mm-mm, mm, mm-mm-mm
