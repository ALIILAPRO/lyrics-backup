		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fear hits like a drug in the veins
Hard to stop like a runaway train
Look around but there's nobody to blame
Oh, what a shame

Spending nights just staring at the wall
Pay no mind to the demons in the hall
Yeah, I'm numb I don't feel nothing at all
Braced for the fall

Try to calm myself down but I feel the panic
Is it all up in my head, am I going manic?
Try to calm myself down but I feel the panic
Is it all up in my head?

Manic
Manic

It's a war but I'm never on attack
Holding on, but I'm slipping through the cracks
Don't wanna be another body in the stack
I'm never coming back

Spending nights just staring at the wall
Pay no mind to the demons in the hall
Yeah, I'm numb I don't feel nothing at all
Braced for the fall

Try to calm myself down but I feel the panic
Is it all up in my head, am I going manic?
Try to calm myself down but I feel the panic
Is it all up in my head?

Manic
Manic

Try to calm myself down but I feel the panic
Is it all up in my head, am I going manic?
Try to calm myself down but I feel the panic
Is it all up in my head?

Manic

Outta body, outta mind
Telling everyone I'm fine
but I'm selling 'em a lie
Outta body, outta mind
Think I'm running outta time
Oh God
I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die
Die

Try to calm myself down but I feel the panic
Is it all up in my head? Ah
Try to calm myself down but I feel the panic
Is it all up in my head? Manic
Try to calm myself down but I feel the panic
Is it all up in my head, am I going manic?
Try to calm myself down but I feel the panic
Is it all up in my head? Manic
