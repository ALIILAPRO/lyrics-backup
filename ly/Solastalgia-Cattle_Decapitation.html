		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Feast your eyes on our only future - neglected, faded and falling apart
Watching the world you know disintegrate - catch fire, a situation already dire
Consequences now fulfilled from two centuries past - worlds behind
In the rear view reflects a clear view of tomorrow
Veiled, draped in sorrow
Jailed, unshaped and hollow

Old world has vanished...expired
To our minds we are banished...inside...forever
This is our world now
Trapped in the self with no way out

What the fuck did we do?
What the fuck did we think we could prove?

Life is torture
Life is torture
Life is torture
The slowest suffering

We had our hopes...we fashioned our ropes...from which we now swing in the breeze
They didn't work...we went berserk...trying in vain just to be put at ease

The winds of solastalgia
Blowing the embers of past transgressions
Burning our faces...leaving a charred world
Devoid of hope...the greatest depression

And our dishonorable discharge
Forever recorded in our DNA we left behind
For we discarded that which reminds

Nigh! The end of hope...the solastalgia - evil nostalgia of better times
The end of hope...lament together, despair forever...lose our minds
The end of hope...the solastalgia - evil nostalgia...of better times
The end of hope...lament together, despair forever...lose our minds
