		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You dissolved into seafoam
Never to return back home
But you are immortal
Within these walls of Manderley
Where your spirit lingers
While your body lies at the bottom of the sea

I'm walking in your hauntingly beautiful shadow
Taunted by monstrous rhododendrons
Watching me with their crimson faces
Reminding everyone of your spilled blood

Like the sea you are relentless
Cold, gracious, and tempestuous
And I can fight the living
But I cannot fight the dead

I'm walking in your hauntingly beautiful shadow
Taunted by monstrous rhododendrons
Watching me with their crimson faces
Reminding everyone of your spilled blood
Reminding everyone of all that I am not

You're embracing me, so tauntingly
(You're embracing me, tauntingly
Possessively manifesting yourself on me)
With the scent of white azaleas
So sweet and heady

I'm walking in your hauntingly beautiful shadow
Taunted by monstrous rhododendrons
Watching me with their crimson faces
Reminding everyone of your spilled blood
Reminding everyone of all that I am not
