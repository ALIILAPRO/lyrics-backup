		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  ""A silhouette casts black shadows Along the desert floor Above the trees and mountains The raven wing soars A totem of creation A sign of life and death Messenger of spirirt realms Its magic never rests No no no No no no no It never rests  When in your darkest moments And you're trapped in deep despair You'll never see me coming But I am always there I am the wise shape-shifter And I am always there  If you're choked with inhibition And you've sown the seeds of doubts It is my full intention I will seek you out I am fate's magician I'll strip you of your doubt  With blackened wings I fly My mystic spirit guide An ever-watchful sentinel The raven at my side With blackened wings I fly My magic spirit guide An omen of my transformation On raven wings I fly  So strip away your vain fa√ßade It's time to face your higher self Open up your spirit Begin to trust yourself I will help raise you From deepest pits of hell  With blackened wings I fly My mystic spirit guide An ever-watchful sentinel The raven at my side With blackened wings I fly My magic spirit guide An omen of my transformation On raven wings I fly  With blackened wings I fly My mystic spirit guide An ever-watchful sentinel The raven at my side With blackened wings I fly My magic spirit guide An omen of my transformation On raven wings I fly""
