		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Rationalize values it's so easy to succeed
Keeping your eyes on the prize excess

Camped outside laissez faire
People understand me there
Don't talk to me we'll get along just fine

Blowin' out your mores
Herny Ford tradition plays on
Idel minds left the emergency brake on too long
Underneath the city lies the ruin of mankind

The excavation was a financial success
With artifacts of gold
The arrowheads went straight to the Smithsonian
The rest was melted down and sold

Substantial gains
Minimal losses are tolerable
As long as the machine keeps running fine

Cannibals
Functioning on pheromones
Rational thought lost to instinctual
