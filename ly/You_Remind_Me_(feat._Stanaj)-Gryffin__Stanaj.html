		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You remind me
You remind me

I wouldn't say that I'm sorry
I wouldn't say that I would do it for someone else
I wouldn't say I apologize
You know me better than my flaws and for my mistakes
I could lie, yeah, you know I could
But I need you more now everyday
And I try, yeah, you know I do
But nothing can compare to you

Put your lovin' on me now, mama
I wanna love you, love you
Tell me what you wanna do, mama
I wanna love you, love you

But you remind me, you remind me
Remind me of, of a long lost love (you remind me)
But you remind me, you remind me
Remind me of, of a long lost love (you remind me)
(You remind me) But you remind me, you remind me
Remind me of, of a long lost love (you remind me)

I wouldn't take my book in
'Cause when I close my eyes all I see is you
In every way you're my opposite
I feel your heartbeat wherever I go
I could lie, yeah, you know I could
But I need you more now everyday
And I try, yeah, you know I do
But nothing can compare
No, nothing can compare to you

Put your lovin' on me now, mama
I wanna love you, love you
Tell me what you wanna do, mama
I wanna love you, love you

But you remind me, you remind me
Remind me of, of a long lost love (you remind me)
But you remind me, you remind me
Remind me of, of a long lost love (you remind me)
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, woah, oh-oh, oh-oh, you remind me
Oh-oh, oh-oh, woah, oh-oh, oh-oh, you remind me)

Put your lovin' on me now, mama
I wanna love you, love you
Tell me what you wanna do, mama
I wanna love you, love you

But you remind me, you remind me
Remind me of, of a long lost love (you remind me)
But you remind me, you remind me
Remind me of, of a long lost love (you remind me)
(You remind me)
