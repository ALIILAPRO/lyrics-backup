		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I bet you don't even know
That I'm a mess for your amusement
I sit and cry in bed alone
I put my skirt on to some music
My codependency don't mind
Kaleidoscopic kind of body
I guess it changes what I say
So tell me, do you really know me at all, all?

I drown myself in aggravation
Tie myself to my temptation
Tell me all the secrets you've been hiding
Open my imagination
Wrap me up in new fixations
Tell me all the secrets you've been hiding

It's all about sex, not violence
Sex, not violence
Sex, not violence, oh
It's all about sex, not violence
Sex, not violence
Tell me all the secrets you've been hiding

It's in everybody's head
Fornication in the classroom
What you got between your legs, honey
Science is ignorant about you, oh, oh, yeah

Drown myself in aggravation
Tie myself to my temptation
Tell me all the secrets you've been hiding
Open my imagination
Wrap me up in new fixations
Tell me all the secrets you've been hiding

It's all about sex, not violence
Sex, not violence
Sex, not violence, oh
It's all about sex, not violence
Sex, not violence
Tell me all the secrets you've been hiding

You've been hiding
Tell me all the secrets you've been hiding

It's all about sex, not violence
Sex, not violence
Sex, not violence, oh
Sex, not violence
Sex, not violence
Tell me all the secrets you've been hiding
