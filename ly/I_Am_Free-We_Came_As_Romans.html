		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Open road has endless ways to move along
Hearts of gold can sometimes turn to stone
I live my life with the best intentions, always meant this
Oh, I keep my mind, never fenced in, always open ended

I keep my mind always open ended

I am free to be everything you're, everything you're not
How can I welcome you with open arms, with your hands around my throat?
I am free to be everything you're, everything you're not
How can I welcome you with open arms, with your mind so closed?
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down.

I walk alone, it doesn't mean my heart is absent
I'm building roads and bridges while you're burning them down
And your heart is absent laying where you left it
I'll reconcile, but you'll fight me harder, fight me harder

I keep my mind, always open ended,

I am free to be everything you're, everything you're not
How can I welcome you with open arms, with your hands around my throat?
I am free to be everything you're, everything you're not
How can I welcome you with open arms, with your mind so closed?
Don't bring me down.

How can I welcome you with open arms, with your hands around my throat?
How can you open your mind, when you have it set in stone?

You'd rather cast me out to sea facedown afloat

I am free to be everything you're, everything you're not
How can I welcome you with open arms, with your hands around my throat?
I am free to be everything you're, everything you're not
How can I welcome you with open arms, with your mind so closed?

Open roads
There's endless ways to move along
Hearts of gold, can sometimes turn to stone
I live my life with the best intentions, always meant this
So, I keep my mind, never fenced in, always open
So, don't bring me down.
