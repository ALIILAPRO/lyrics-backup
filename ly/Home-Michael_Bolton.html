		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Every breath I breathe
The same air that you breathe
And it's like you're next to me
I look up to the stars
The same stars that you see
And I know we can be
Everywhere is a place I find you
Anywhere

This is home
No matter where this life will take us
Home
Nothing in this world will separate
Our love will live on, here in our hearts
Wherever we are
This is home, home, home, home

Faithful through the years
As faithful as the sun
Every morning rises
Through the joy and through the tears
Love will stay right here
And forever keep us close
Everywhere is a place I find you
Anywhere

This is home
No matter where this life will take us
Home
Nothing in this world will separate
Our love will live on, here in our hearts
Wherever we are
This is home, home, home, home
Home, home, home

Home in our hearts
Wherever we are
Everywhere, anywhere

This is home
No matter where this life will take us
Home
Nothing in this world will separate
Our love will live on, here in our hearts
Wherever we are
This is home, home, home, home
Home, home, home
