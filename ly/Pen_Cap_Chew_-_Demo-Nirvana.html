		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mmmmm, lies again
Mmmmm, lies
Mmmmm, mmmmm

You go, you give, you get, you get to me
All the years of tyrants such an easy way to go
You go, you give, you get, you get to me
Hide the struggle under the scaling of fingernails

Mmmm, lies again
Mmmmm, lies
Mmmmm, mmmm

You're lonely

Waste your time by saving worthless gullibles
Give up all additions in there where it's cold
This decade is the age of rehashing
Protest swine, go to jail, the travesty

Two minutes slow
Oh
