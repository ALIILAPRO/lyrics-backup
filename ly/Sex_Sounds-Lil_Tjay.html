		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mm
Feels so good
Pussy blow me away
Mm, blow me away

The way you kiss me when I'm strokin' deep inside of it
I swear you ride it so good (so good)
That pussy blow me away
And I been thinkin' 'bout your smile
All mornin' for a while
By the way you twist your face while I'm strokin' it
And now, girl, you shocked me, I'm so wowed
Got me slippin', I'm like how?
First I met you on the 'Gram, I picked you up and took you out
Let me show you what I'm 'bout
Let them haters run they mouth
You should know you somethin' different 'cause I brought you to my house
Serve you breakfast on my couch
Anything you ever need you know I'll be there with no doubt
I need you by my side, I hope you're here to ride
I hate to see you hurtin', my lil' baby, wipe your eyes

Baby, let me pull your dress down (dress down)
Kiss you from your neck down (neck down)
Have you screaming, "Oh"
Baby, just let me pull your dress down
Kiss you from the neck down
Have you screaming, "Oh" 
Love them sex sounds, yeah

Baby, I need you in my life, it's like there's no one there
Nobody, can I turn to you next time there's no one there?
I need a girl to match my loyalty when times get rough
I turn to you 'cause I know damn well you don't give a fuck
About them, let them niggas hate
Either way, regardless what they saying, we'll be great
Let's go explore the whole world
Fuck the skippin' states
You got me feelin' different, I might let it go today

Mm-mm-mm, ain't nobody but you
Oh, oh, ain't nobody but you
Mm-mm-mm, ain't nobody but you
Oh, oh, ain't nobody but you

Baby, let me pull your dress down (dress down)
Kiss you from your neck down (neck down)
Have you screaming, "Oh"
Baby, just let me pull your dress down
Kiss you from the neck down
Have you screaming, "Oh" 
Love them sex sounds

Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Dress down, pull your dress down
Oh, oh, oh
