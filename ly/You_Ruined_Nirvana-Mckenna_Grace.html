		<p>
		  Roll down the windows and scream
"Boulevard of Broken Dreams"
But nothing's ever what it seems
You made me hate being fifteen

I'm so over it, yeah
You're so full of shit, yeah
Everything you do
And, I'm so over it (I'm so over it)
And, I'm so over it

You put me in a Heart-Shaped Box (shaped box)
Now you only ever call me when you're high
You know you ruined Nevermind (Nevermind)
Now, every song's about you in my mind

So what if we broke up?
I don't ever think about you
But the worst thing that you ever did (you ever did)
You ruined Nirvana
And I can't forgive you for that

Can't walk into my closet
Without seeing your face
'Cause all my favorite t-shirts
Are all your favorite band names

I'm so over it, yeah
You're so full of shit, yeah
Everything you do
Oh, I'm so over it (I'm so over it)
I'm so over it

You put me in a Heart-Shaped Box (shaped box)
Now you only ever call me when you're high
You know you ruined Nevermind (Nevermind)
Now, every song's about you in my mind

So what if we broke up?
I don't ever think about you
But the worst thing that you ever did (you ever did)
You ruined Nirvana
And I can't forgive you for that

Break my heart, tear me apart
Run me over with your car
But don't fuck with my favorite songs

You put me in a Heart-Shaped Box (shaped box)
Now you only ever call me when you're high
You know you ruined Nevermind (Nevermind)
Now, every song's about you in my mind

So what if we broke up?
I don't ever think about you
But the worst thing that you ever did (you ever did)
You ruined Nirvana
And I can't forgive you for that

Oh, ooh-oh, ooh-oh
Oh, ooh-oh, ooh-oh
