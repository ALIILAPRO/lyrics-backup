		  Oops, my baby, you woke up in my bed
Oops, we broke up, we're better off as friends
Now I accidentally need you, I don't know what to do
Oops, baby, I love you

It started with "what's up with you?"
I messed around and got caught up with you
Yeah, yeah, I don't know what to do
I caught these feelings like it's nothing new
Now I can't get enough of you, oh oh

And when I think about the way you touch my body
I don't know how long I can wait
And when I think about the way you touch my body
This could be my greatest mistake
You've got me singing

Oops, my baby, you woke up in my bed
Oops, we broke up, we're better off as friends
Now I accidentally need you, I don't know what to do
Oops, baby, I love you

We had a good run
We messed around and had some good fun
Guess it turns out I lost a good one
'Cause now I'm wishing every morning would come
With you next to me, baby

And when I think about the way you touch my body
This could be my greatest mistake
You've got me singing

Oops, my baby, you woke up in my bed
Oops, we broke up, we're better off as friends
Now I accidentally need you, I don't know what to do
Oops, baby, I love you

I love you
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Now I accidentally know that you're in love with me, too
Oops, baby, I love you (yeah, yeah, yeah)

If it was up to me, I would take a time machine
To the day I said goodbye
Ooh, I lied so can we try again? Beneficial, more than friends
No, don't you tell me goodbye
You've got me singing

Oops, my baby, you woke up in my bed
Oops, we broke up, we're better off as friends
Now I accidentally need you, I don't know what to do
Oops, baby, I love you

I love I love I love you
Oh yes I love you

Now I accidentally know that you're in love with me, too
Oops, baby, I love you
