		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you could take my pulse right now
It would feel just like a sledgehammer
If you could feel my heart beat now
It would hit you like a sledgehammer

I don't admit it
I play it cool
But every minute
That I'm with you

I feel the fever and I won't lie
I break a sweat
My body's telling
All the secrets I ain't told you yet

(Oh oh) I struggle to contain
(Whoa oh) The love that's in my veins
(Oh oh) And how it circulates (oh oh)

If you could take my pulse right now
It would feel just like a sledgehammer (oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh)
If you could feel my heart beat now
It would hit you like a sledgehammer (oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh)

You're taken over the beat of my body
You just don't let up, don't let up
You're taken over the beat of my body
But you lift me up, lift me up
If you take my pulse right now
It would feel just like a sledgehammer

So close together
So far apart
You're turning me on
And my fire's waitin' for your spark

(Oh oh) I struggle to contain
(Whoa oh) The love that's in my veins
(Oh oh) And how it circulates (oh oh)

If you could take my pulse right now
It would feel just like a sledgehammer (oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh)
If you could feel my heart beat now
It would hit you like a sledgehammer (oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh)

You're taken over the beat of my body
You just don't let up, don't let up
You're taken over the beat of my body
But you lift me up, lift me up
If you take my pulse right now
It would feel just like a sledgehammer

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

The truth is out
No stopping now
I'm getting closer
I've had enough
Undress my love
I'm coming over

If you take my pulse right now
It would feel just like a sledgehammer, oh
And if you take my pulse right now
It would feel just like a sledgehammer, hammer, oh

If you take my pulse

If you could take my pulse right now
It would feel just like a sledgehammer (oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh)
If you could feel my heart beat now
It would hit you like a sledgehammer (oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh)

You're taken over the beat of my body
You just don't let up, don't let up
You're taken over the beat of my body
But you lift me up, lift me up
If you take my pulse right now
It would feel just like a sledgehammer

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
