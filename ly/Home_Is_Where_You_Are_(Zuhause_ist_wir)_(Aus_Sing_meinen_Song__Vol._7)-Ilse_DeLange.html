		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I feel like I've been sleeping forever
All I need is just a blink of an eye
When I dream, I see us together
While all the lakes and seas flow by
Where the high roads and the small towns cross
The universe is hidden inside
Just listen to the rhythm of a heartbeat
Trust what's shining in our eyes

I hold my hand out to you

Let's get in the car
Without a destination
We build a home wherever we may be
Without hesitation
The world is ours to own
It can be what you want it to be
As long as I'm here with you
As long as you are here with me

No longer alone, since I met you
You are near, wherever I go
No matter how far this life takes us
Home is always down the road
We travel down life lines together
We crash and we burn, make mistakes
You live, you learn, you get better
Nothings built, when nothing breaks

And I hold my hand out to you

Let's get in the car
Without a destination
I build a home wherever we may be
Without hesitation
The world is ours to own
It can be what you want it to be
As long as I'm here with you
As long as you are here with me

Every step we make together
Let our love take us wherever
Any destination, near or far
Home ist where we are
Every step we make together
Let our love takes us wherever
Any destination, near or far
Home is where we are
Home is where we are

Let's get in the car
Without a destination
I build a home wherever we may be
Without hesitation
The world is ours to own
It can be what you want it to be
As long as I'm here with you
As long as you are here with me

Every step we make together
Let our love takes us wherever
Any destination, near or far
Home is where you are
Every step we make together
Let our love takes us wherever
Any destination, near or far
Home is where you are

Home is where you are

„Danke“
