		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  That little porch where we sat in the springtime
Making chords that felt very nice
The soft play of the new leaf shadows
You know I love this heady kind of sight

Early out on that copper morning
Feeling like things would be alright
Velvet of your vowels forming
You know you glow in any kind of light

How you playfully tease me while I'm resting
How you laugh when you see you're succeeding
How you look when you're taking in a new day
You may not know, these little things I like

I'm looking forward to multiplying these times
I'm ready for the sad times we'll find
But all these scenes and these colors and your eyes
You know, I love this beautiful life
