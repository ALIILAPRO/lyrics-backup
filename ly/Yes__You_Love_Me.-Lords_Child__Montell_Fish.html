Don't You love me? Don't You love me?

Don't You love me? Don't You love-
Don't You love-? Don't You love me?
Don't You love me? Don't You love me?
Don't You love me?
Don't You love me? Don't You
Love- don't You love-? Don't You love me?
Don't You love me? Don't You love me?
Don't You love me?
Don't You love me? Don't You
Love- don't You love-? Don't You love me?
Don't You love me? Don't You love me?
