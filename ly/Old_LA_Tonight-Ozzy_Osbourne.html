		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Look into the future
Look into my eyes and tell me everything's all right
Tell me where we're going
I'm so afraid 'cause I don't know what's going on with my life

But it'll be all right tonight
Will it be all right tonight?
Are we doin' all right in old L.A. tonight?

Sitting by the ocean
Mapping out my plans of action, baby they include you
I wish you'd send a message
Maybe I'm just better off not knowing who knew

But it'll be all right tonight
I'm gonna be all right tonight
Are we doin' all right in old L.A. tonight?

Those summer nights when I look in your eyes
I'm falling to pieces, pieces out of my mind
And I'll never know why
I'm falling to pieces, pieces

Who could you imagine such a thing could happen to you?
It's gonna be all right in old L.A.

Those summer nights when I look in your eyes
I'm falling to pieces, pieces out of my mind
And I'll never know why
I'm falling to pieces, pieces

It's gonna be all right in old L.A. tonight
