		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I used to find love in the little things
Now this 80 proof the only way I feel
All my friends tell me I'm a fiend
Guess the pain ain’t something I coulda concealed no more
I miss the old me
I miss that 2am rush with you
I miss the old me
Don’t know the new me
Chivas Regal in my blood and I do not give a fuck

I got no pulse, blacked out, fucked up in the back of your car
(Back of your car)
(Ouu)
I got no phone, passed out, think I got kicked out of the bar
(They stole my fake & my wallet)
(Ouu)
I been all in my head, I'm makin' love with ambition
The only point of my youth is making reckless decisions
I’m just a no good, shitfaced, high school dropout
(No good, shitfaced, highschool dropout)

So what’s the point of feeling something that’ll never be enough?
Phycobilin dreaming, who I am ain't who I was
Am I holding onto something or just catchin' my own bluff?
Guess I’ll hold onto this feeling 'til I finally open up
Used to find the bright side, now I’m in the dark
Used to fight to cope, now I'm fighting for a spark
I’m so used to getting used, I don’t check up on myself
Guess the reason I feel perfect’s same as why I need help, cause

I used to find love in the little things
Shot of gin, chase it with lust
All my friends tell me I'm a fiend
Chivas Regal in my blood
and I do not give a fuck

I got no pulse, blacked out, fucked up in the back of your car
(Back of your car)
(Ouu)
I got no phone, passed out, think I got kicked out of the bar
(They stole my fake & my wallet)
(Ouu)
I been all in my head, I'm makin' love with ambition
The only point of my youth is making reckless decisions
I’m just a no good, shitfaced, high school dropout
(No good, shitfaced, highschool dropout)

(No good, shitfaced, highschool dropout)
(No good, shitfaced, highschool dropout)
(No good, shitfaced, highschool dropout)
