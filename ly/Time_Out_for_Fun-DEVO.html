		<p>
		  Hello,
 
This is devo
We would like
to say Thingsgo both ways
New ideas stupid moves
Nightmares or dreams come true
Mucho work minus play
Tension mounts in a twisted face
Dark clouds in the crystal ball
Tension mounts in a foreign place
The screw turns someone calls

[Chorus: x2]
Time out for fun!
Time out for fun!

So you're living under the gun
Circumstances have you on the run
A doctor frowns you feel bad
Take this you've just been had!

Don't you lose it now listen to us
Everything's going to be all right
Take a break take some time
Everything's going to be all right
Don't you lose it remember to take

[Chorus]

Don't you lose it now listen to us
Everything's going to be all right
Take a break take some time
Everything's going to be all right
Don't you lose it remember to take

[Chorus: x2]

So your life has just begun
Somebody else is saying that it's done
Nurses whisper others grin
Something's funny at your expense again

Don't you lose it now listen to us
Everything's going to be all right
Take a break take some time
Everything's going to be all right
Don't you lose it remember to take

[Chorus]
