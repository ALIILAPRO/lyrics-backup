		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Giving up on it slowly, letting all the feelings go
It's a permanent maybe, it's probably gonna be a no
I'm ready for, days and weeks
On my face, or on my back

I said I don't know
Our love is a mess we both know
Nothing to show as far as I can tell
Now we look like we're undone to me
Soggy cheeks and running from me, yeah

In a race to get happy, no sign of the leading pack
I'm the consummate lonely, I'm there to drink and then head back
I wake up at lunchtime, well, I don't know what you're talking about
But I'm stuck, catatonic once again

Said I don't know
Our love is a mess we both know
Nothing to show as far as I can tell
Now we look like we're undone to me
Soggy cheeks and running from me, yeah

She looks like she means it
I'm not feeling confident this time
Dripping tears on pillows
And an overwhelming sense of fuck this

Said I don't know
Our love is a mess we both know
Nothing to show as far as I can tell
Now we look like we're undone to me
Soggy cheeks and running from me, yeah

She looks like she means it
I'm not feeling confident this time
Dripping tears on pillows
And an overwhelming sense of fuck this
Fuck this
