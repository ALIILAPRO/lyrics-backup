		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is the heartbreak hotel 
This is the heartbreak hotel 
This is the heartbreak hotel 
This is the heartbreak hotel 
This is the heartbreak hotel 
This is the heartbreak hotel 
This is the heartbreak hotel 
This is the heartbreak hotel 

You said you'd be here by nine 
Instead you took your time 
You didn't think to call me boy 
Here I sit trying not to cry 
Asking myself why 
You'd do this to me

Since you're not around for me to tell you baby, face to face 
I'm writing you this letter, and this is what I have to say: 

All I really wanted was some of your time 
Instead you told me lies 
When someone else was on your mind 
What you do to me 
Look what you did to me
I thought that you were someone who would do me right 
Until you played with my emotions and you made me cry 
What you do to me 
Can't take what you did to me

Now I see that you've been doing wrong 
You played me all along
And made a fool of me, baby 
You got it all wrong to think that I wouldn't find out 
That you were cheating on me 
How could you do it to me

Since you're not around for me to tell you baby, face to face 
I'm writing you this letter, and this is what I have to say: 

All I really wanted was some of your time 
Instead you told me lies 
When someone else was on your mind 
What you do to me 
Look what you did to me
I thought that you were someone who would do me right 
Until you played with my emotions and you made me cry 
What you do to me 
Can't take what you did to me

Heartbreak hotel
This is the heartbreak hotel
This is the heartbreak hotel 
This is the heartbreak hotel 
This is the heartbreak hotel 
This is the heartbreak hotel 
This is the heartbreak hotel 
This is the heartbreak hotel 

All I really wanted was some of your time 
Instead you told me lies 
When someone else was on your mind 
What you do to me 
Look what you did to me
I thought that you were someone who would do me right 
Until you played with my emotions and you made me cry 
What you do to me 
Can't take what you did to me

All I really wanted was some of your time 
Instead you told me lies 
When someone else was on your mind 
What you do to me 
Look what you did to me
I thought that you were someone who would do me right 
Until you played with my emotions and you made me cry 
What you do to me 
Can't take what you did to me

I ain't gonna, I ain't gonna take it no more 
I ain't gonna take it no more 
I ain't gonna take it no more 

Everything that you said was a lie
Don't lie to me
Tell me what it is and I will be alright
