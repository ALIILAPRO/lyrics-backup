		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby I forgot somethin', that's why I came home
It's somethin' I really need, I know you thought I was gone
No, it's not my gloves honey, it's not that cold today
It's nothin' I left behind, it's somethin' I got to say
I forgot to say I love you
And something else that I missed, to say how much I need you

[Chorus:]

In a Crazy, Crazy World Like This
It's easy to feel all alone
You give me the strength I need to exist
Just hold me and don't let me go
In a Crazy, Crazy World Like This

Sometimes I don't know lately, what will ease the pain?
On every corner of the street, sometimes it's all too insane
Baby you just got somethin', that's why I came home
It's somethin' I really need, an' now we can be alone

I just had to say I love you, and something else that I missed
To say how much I need you

(Chorus)

It's easy to fear the unknown
I always know when fate gives a twist
You'll be there to soften the blow

In a Crazy, Crazy World Like This - Ooh, Ooh
You give me the strength I need to exist
Just hold me and don't let me go

In a Crazy, Crazy World Like This
It's easy to feel all alone
I always know when fate gives a twist
You'll be there to soften the blow

In a Crazy, Crazy World Like This - Ooh, Ooh
You give me the strength I need to exist
Just hold me and don't let me go

In a Crazy, Crazy World Like This
When all my defenses are low
I always know when fate gives a twist
You'll be there to soften the blow
In a Crazy, Crazy World Like This.....
