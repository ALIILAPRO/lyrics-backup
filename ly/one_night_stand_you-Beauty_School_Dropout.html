		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No, I can't one night stand you (whoa)
No, I can't one night stand you (no)

Lonely minded, I feel so unwell
But I admit I do this too myself

'Cause it's twenty past four
And she's gone already
Chasing that high that we had at eleven
I slowly feel like time is running out

'Cause I can't one night stand you (whoa)
No, I can't one night stand you (no)
No, I can't one night stand
To be alone again when I wake up
But I'll still second chance you
'Cause I can't one night stand you

I spoke to God, He answered all my prayers (hello?)
Leaving me with you was so unfair

'Cause it's twenty past four
And she's gone already
Chasing that high, yeah, it felt like heaven
If I can't have you now, I never will

'Cause I can't one night stand you (whoa)
No, I can't one night stand you (no)
No, I can't one night stand
To be alone again when I wake up
But I'll still second chance you
'Cause I can't one night stand you

'Cause I can't one night stand you (whoa)
No, I can't one night stand you (no)
No, I can't one night stand
To be alone again when I wake up
But I'll still second chance you
'Cause I can't one night stand you
