		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Words cut like jagged shards
And your house of glass is falling apart
You preach love but don’t give it
Teach hate but don’t see it
If there’s nothing above
Then there’s nothing beneath
But a fraud has to cut their teeth

Hiding inside your own skin
And now you’re so absorbed
Are you even listening?
Words fallen on deaf ears
Eye for an eye
But you’re the only one who’s been left blind

Worlds apart
From the lives you crush
Hypocrisy moves from bone to dust
Spiritual fraud
Cleansed in the waters
Self inflicted stigmata
You’re no saint, no faith to claim
A lifetime spent in vein

Oh father, forsaker
We felt the wrath of thee
Oh father, have mercy
Can you not turn the other cheek?

No longer walking the line
That exists in your own mind
Was it all for nothing?
Wasn’t there always just…nothing?
