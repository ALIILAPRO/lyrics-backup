		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't want to be buried in a hole when I die
I wanna be carried in a jar with the ashes and lies
And when I break my stained glass media heart
I'll smile as I tear it apart
So don't panic, the pillar is here
Another in a line of heroes with nothing to fear
And a taste for the hardcore that comes with common sense
Oh my god, we're in trouble again

We're in trouble again
One last stand

I'm warning you right now
I'm feelin' like a Sunday, I'll never get away
No one knows

Who's afraid of a king in a castle?
Another dirty face on a hundred dollar bill
I'll take what I thought I could never impossibly get
I'm living like I'm losing a bet
So don't worry, the future is here
Another contemplation to ration for over the years
I'm crossing your lines, pushing my way, deliberate
Borrow your time, take me away, I'm into it

Did you borrow your time?
One last time

I'm warning you right now (warning you right now)
I'm feelin' like a Sunday, I'll never get away
No one knows
I'm warning you right now (warning you right now)
I'm feelin' like a Sunday, I'll never get away
No one knows me

Reciprocity
For all the ones to leave
Are you ready for the one last war?

I'm warning you right now (warning you right now)
I'm feelin' like a Sunday, I'll never get away
No one knows me
I'm warning you right now (warning you right now)
I'm feelin' like a Sunday, I'll never get away
No one knows my name

One last time
