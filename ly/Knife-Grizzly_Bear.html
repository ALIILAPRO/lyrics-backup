		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I want you to know
When I look in your eyes
With every blow
Comes another lie

You think it's all right
You think it's all right
You think it's all right
You think it's all right

Can't you feel the knife?
Can't you feel the knife?
Can't you feel the knife?
Can't you feel the knife?
