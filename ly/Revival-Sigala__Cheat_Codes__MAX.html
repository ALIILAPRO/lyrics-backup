		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't know where you came from
But it didn't take long
To pull me from the pavement, oh yeah
I was in a tailspin
Long before you came in
Baby now, I'm sayin', Amen

Oh, I didn't know that I could feel so 
Oh, comfortable, oh yeah
Oh, I didn't know 
That I could end up finding myself, alright

And it feels like, my eyes are open
And it feels like, I'm on my knees
And it feels like, my soul revival
Your love's reviving me
Your love's reviving me

Your love's reviving all
Your love's reviving me
Your love's reviving all
Your love's reviving me

I don't know how your fingers
Can read me like a scripture
I know that I need ya, yeah, yeah
Uh, I take you somewhere higher
Kiss me with your eyes shut
Baby, you could be my Amen

Oh, I didn't know that I could feel so 
Oh, comfortable, oh yeah
Oh, I didn't know 
That I could end up finding myself, alright

And it feels like, my eyes are open
And it feels like, I'm on my knees
And it feels like, my soul revival
Your love's reviving me
Your love's reviving me

Your love's reviving all
Your love's reviving me
Your love's reviving all
Your love's reviving me

Oh, I didn't know that I could feel so 
Oh, comfortable, oh yeah
Oh, I didn't know 
That I could end up finding myself, alright

And it feels like, my eyes are open
And it feels like, I'm on my knees
And it feels like, my soul revival
Your love's reviving me
Your love's reviving me

Your love's reviving all
Your love's reviving me
Your love's reviving all
Your love's reviving all
