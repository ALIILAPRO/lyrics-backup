		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm a real big fan of yours
But I'm quite the joke to you
But girl it wasn't a joke when you kissed me in your room
And replied "I love you too"

I'm a little bit insecure
From all of this mistreatment
But see I'm working it out
But working it out
Is so dam hard when your alone

And I am running out of words to say to you
Wondering why I'm wasting my time
Thinking back and wondering why I'm such a fool
For loving you

And I get to the point where all I wanted was for us to make up
But it's not that easy
'Cause girl you move on so quickly
Keeping a boy like me at the edge of his seat

And I know everything until it was all about your perfect image
Well I hope this song
It helps your image

I'm so over you now

And I am running out of words to say to you
Wondering why I'm wasting my time
Thinking back and wondering why I'm such a fool
For loving you

And I was the the one
Who thought I was the strong one
You proved me wrong now I'm singing along
To every song on the radio I don't wanna go
Come on baby tell me something I wanna know and I
Don't wanna say what is on my mind
Because this lack of motivation is taking over my time
And I'm sick
Of trying

And I am running out of words to say to you
Wondering why I'm wasting my time
Thinking back and wondering why I'm such a fool
For loving you

O'lay!
