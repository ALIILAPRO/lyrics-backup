		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They look down 
At the ground
Missing 
But I never go in now

I'm looking at the big sky 
I'm looking at the big sky now 
I'm looking at the big sky 
You never really understood me 
You never really tried

That cloud, that cloud
Looks like Ireland 
C'mon and blow it a kiss now
But quick

'Cause its changing in the big sky 
Its changing in the big sky now 
We're looking at the big sky 
You never understood me 
You never really tried 

This cloud, this cloud
Says Noah
C'mon and build me an ark 
And if you're coming, jump
'Cause we're leaving with the big sky 
We're leaving with the big sky
We're leaving with the big sky
We're looking at the 
We're looking at the 
And we pause for the jets 
Hup, hup, in the big sky

We're leaving with the big sky 
You want my reply? 
What was the question? 
I was looking at the big sky

We're looking at the 
Tell 'em, sisters
Rolling over like a great big cloud
Rolling over with the big sky
Rolling over like a great big cloud
Rolling over with the big sky
Rolling over like a great big cloud
Rolling over with the big sky
Rolling over like a great big cloud
Rolling over with the big sky

Rolling over like a great big cloud
Rolling over with the big sky
Rolling over like a great big cloud
Rolling over with the big sky
Rolling over like a great big cloud
Rolling over with the big sky
Rolling over like a great big cloud
Rolling over with the big sky
Rolling over like a great big cloud
Rolling over with the big sky
Rolling over like a great big cloud
Rolling over with the big sky
