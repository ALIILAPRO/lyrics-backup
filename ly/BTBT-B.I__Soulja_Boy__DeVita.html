		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When my eyes are on you
숨 막힐듯한 전율
Oh, you know you get me loose 
Make me go 비틀비틀 

A dance floor made for two
달이 부르는 선율
Oh, it's only me and you
Make me go 비틀비틀 

You bring the demon out of me 
Blame it all on your body
We might be an hour late
We ain't got no time to waste 

꿈을 꾸는 기분이야 
잡은 손을 놓지마
내일은 안 중요해 
이 순간을 몰입해

Oh, I got plenty
I done seen 'em all, but of you there ain't many
Said they win the race so I'm slow and I'm steady 
But can't move this slow in a Bentley oh
You say you need a true love someone to kiss and hug
You feigning for some touching ayy
I could be all that and above
I just hope that I'm enough 
'Cause I don't ever do this 

When my eyes are on you
숨 막힐듯한 전율
Oh, you know you get me loose 
Make me go 비틀비틀

A dance floor made for two
달이 부르는 선율
Oh, it's only me and you
Make me go 비틀비틀

춤을 추지 날 위해 
만취해 너의 향기에
세상을 다 알기에
인생은 짧으니 시간을 맘껏 낭비해 

거리를 방황하자 우리
둘 뿐인 것처럼 말이야
아찔하고 위험할수록 내 심장은 뛰어
That's why I love ya 

Oh, I got plenty
I done seen 'em all, but of you there ain't many
Said they win the race so I'm slow and I'm steady 
But can't move this slow in a Bentley oh
You say you need a true love someone to kiss and hug
You feigning for some touching ayy
I could be all that and above
I just hope that I'm enough 
'Cause I don't ever do this 

When my eyes are on you
숨막힐듯한 전율
Oh, you know you get me loose 
Make me go 비틀비틀

A dance floor made for two
달이 부르는 선율
Oh, it's only me and you
Make me go 비틀비틀 

Yeah, front, back, side to side 
Pull up then I drop the top on a new ride 
Bust down Cartier cost thirty-five
Thirty thousand square feet in the air, stay fly
Red carpet, I was fresh suit and tie 
Jumped off the stage, I don't even know why
Every time I drop a new hit, we on fire 
Yeah, we going viral, I know that I inspired you 
Jump on a jet, let's get away out of town 
Find somewhere away we can't be found 
Bust down that Cartier, I came from the ground 
Ain't no other man in the town 
Rolling up the Zaza woods right out the pound 
Don't look at my water, you gon' drown
Everybody know Big Draco 
It's going down

When my eyes are on you
숨 막힐듯한 전율
Oh, you know you get me loose 
Make me go 비틀비틀 

A dance floor made for two
달이 부르는 선율
Oh, it's only me and you
Make me go 비틀비틀 

Make me go 비틀비틀
Make me go 비틀비틀
