		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Five times on the ground
Who gon' help me up
When no one is around
I guess I'm on my own
Damage that I've done
I can't clean it up
Everything's a mess
Leave it in the rut
Causing too much pain
Hopping on a plane
I don't want to stay
So I run away
Need a new escape
This ain't working out
Think I need a break
What you thinking now
You got something for the pain
Let me get some
I've been giving out the love
But ain't get none
I got too much on my mind
I got to get done
Put it in my face
But it never gets done
You got something for the pain
Let me get that
Taking too much
So I can regret that
I don't want to wake up
For the next day
This my life motherfucker
Just press play
Just press play
Press play
Just press play
Press play
Waking up and I made it to the next day
On a mission I ain't taking no delays
Anybody out here can relate
Life is tough I demand a rebate
Here we go now
On the road now
Can't slow down
Going full throttle
Pick it back up
Put it back down
Mind's racing looking at that bottle
Causing too much pain
Hopping on a plane
I don't want to stay
So I run away
Need a new escape
This ain't working out
Think I need a break
What you thinking now
You got something for the pain
Let me get some
I've been giving out the love
But ain't get none
I got too much on my mind
I got to get done
Put it in my face
But it never gets done
You got something for the pain
Let me get that
Taking too much
So I can regret that
I don't want to wake up
For the next day
This my life motherfucker
Just press play
Just press play
Press play
Just press play
Press play
