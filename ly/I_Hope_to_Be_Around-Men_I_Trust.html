		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I hope to be around
The day we grasp in truth
The nature of mind
Befriending time, in truth

In a midway I stand where many stood
Only to come home again
Walking through these streets I know too well
But my thoughts stray away

I dream of my future
Remote from time bounds
Becoming myself
Without any end
I dream of my future
Remote from time bounds
Becoming myself in truth

I wonder at this light
Enclosed in our soul, in truth
And bid our clay remain
Soft as it is, in truth

In a midway I stand where many stood
Only to come home again
Walking through these streets I know too well
But my thoughts stray away

I dream of my future
Remote from time bounds
Becoming myself
Without any end
I dream of my future
Remote from time bounds
Becoming myself in truth

I dream of my future
Remote from time bounds
Becoming myself
Without any end
I dream of my future
Remote from time bounds
Becoming myself in truth
