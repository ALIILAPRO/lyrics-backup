		  Shake that body
Shake that body
Shake that body
Shake that body

People, don't you know?
Don't you know it's about time?
Can't you hear the jam is bumpin'
While you taste a piece of mine
Many different flavors
And the spice is strong
Get into the hot stuff
Let me pour a little some'

Baby, let me show you how to do this
You gotta move this, you're doin' fine
Ain't nothin' to it, you gotta groove it
Come on and move this
Shake that body for

People, don't you know?
Don't you know it's about time?
Can't you hear the jam is bumpin'
While you taste a piece of mine
Many different flavors
And the spice is strong
Get into the hot stuff
Let me pour a little some'

Baby, let me show you how to do this
You gotta move this, you're doin' fine
Ain't nothin' to it, you gotta move it
Come on and groove it
Shake that body for me

Shake that body for me
Shake that body

People, don't you know?
Don't you know it's about time?
Can't you hear the jam is bumpin'
While you taste a piece of mine
Can you feel the mellow crawling fast
Drummer, baby, rhythm blast
Pump it, pump it, pump, pump it up
Nothin' can make this one stop

You gotta move this
Come on and move it
Oh yeah, you gotta move it and groove it
And move it on
Shake that body for

Baby, let me show you how to
Do this, you gotta move this
You gotta move that
You gotta move, move
Move this and groove this
Shake that body for me

Shake that body
Shake that body for me
Shake that body
Shake that body for me
Shake that body, mmm
Shake that body for me
Shake that body
Shake it, shake it
You gotta move it
Come on and groove it
You gotta move it and move it and move it
You gotta move it
Come on and move it
You gotta move it and move it and move it

Baby, let me show you how to do this
You gotta move this, you're doin' fine
Ain't nothin' to it, you gotta groove it
Come on and move this
Shake that body for me

Shake that body for me
Shake that body for me
Shake that body for me
Shake it, shake it
