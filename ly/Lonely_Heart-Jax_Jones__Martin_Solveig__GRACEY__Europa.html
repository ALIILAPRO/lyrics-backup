		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can you hear?
Can you feel it?

I remember driving at night
London felt a little warmer with you
Now I'm driving through the same city lights
And I've only got the memories of you

Now we're raindrops in the backseat of your car
It was cold and it was dark
We were steaming up the windows
Can't stop finding things that you forgot
And I'm reminiscing all that we lost

Can you hear?
Can you feel it?
When my lonely heart breaks
Can you feel it?
Can you hear?

Can you hear?
Can you feel it?
When my lonely heart breaks
Can you feel it?
Can you hear?
When my lonely heart breaks (oh)
When my lonely heart breaks
When my lonely heart breaks

We used to ride through the night
When the last thing that we wanted was space (oh-oh-oh)
And now I can't get you out of my head
And the memories are hard to erase

Now we're raindrops in the backseat of your car
It was cold and it was dark
We were steaming up the windows
Can't stop finding things that you forgot
And I'm reminiscing all that we lost

Can you hear?
Can you feel it?
When my lonely heart breaks
Can you feel it?
Can you hear?

Can you hear?
Can you feel it?
When my lonely heart breaks
Can you feel it?
Can you hear?
When my lonely heart breaks

What can you do?
I feel my lonely heart
It beats for you
Can't stop my lonely heart
What can you do?
I feel my lonely heart
It beats for you
Can't stop my, can't stop my lonely heart
