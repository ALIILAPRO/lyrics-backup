		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take my mind
And take my pain
Like an empty bottle takes the rain
And heal, heal, heal, heal

And take my past
And take my sins
Like an empty sail takes the wind
And heal, heal, heal, heal

And tell me some things last
And tell me some things last

And take a heart
And take a hand
Like an ocean takes the dirty sand
And heal, heal, hell, heal

And take my mind
And take my pain
Like an empty bottle takes the rain
And heal, heal, hell, heal

And tell me some things last
And tell me some things last
And tell me some things last
And tell me some things last
