		  Let Me Hate You

VERSE 1
I still remember the drink you made 
The night that you told me his name
Tasted like gin and dishonesty, ah
Been a few weeks I still lay awake
Miss you and push it away
You say you never stopped wanting me, ah

PRE
So I hold onto your lies
And make you the bad guy
But one look in your eyes
And you’re changing my mind, yeah

CHORUS
Can you just let me hate you
Can you just let me hate you
Cause I can’t be strong until you’re gone
And I won’t chase you
Can you just let me hate you
Can you just let me blame you
Cause I can’t move on until you’re gone
So let me hate you

POST
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Let me hate you
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Let me hate you

VERSE 2
I’m sick of seeing you at your best
You’re only making it worse
I know that I shouldn’t be impressed, ah
By all the ways you’ve apologized 
You’re getting into my head
I don’t wanna do this again 

CHORUS
Can you just let me hate you
Can you just let me hate you
Cause I can’t be strong until you’re gone
And I won’t chase you
Can you just let me hate you
Can you just let me blame you
Cause I can’t move on until you’re gone
So let me hate you

POST
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Let me hate you
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Let me hate you
x2

BRIDGE
Been all I think about
Since I’ve been here without
The chaos and the pain, still feel it now
‘Cause I still love you
Been all I dream about
Wish we could work it out
But if we did you’d only let me down

CHORUS
Can you just let me hate you
Can you just let me hate you
Cause I can’t be strong until you’re gone
And I won’t chase you
Can you just let me hate you
Can you just let me blame you
Cause I can’t move on until you’re gone
So let me hate you

POST
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Let me hate you
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Let me hate you
x2
