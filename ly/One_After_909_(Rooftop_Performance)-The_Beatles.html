		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My baby said she's traveling on the one after 909
I said move over honey I'm traveling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on, baby, don't be cold as ice
Said she's traveling on the one after 909

I begged her not to go and I begged her on my bended knees
You're only fooling around, you're fooling around with me
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on, baby, don't be cold as ice
Said she's traveling on the one after 909

I got my bag, run to the station
Railman says you've got the the wrong location
I got my bag, run right home
Then I find I've got the number wrong

Well she said she's traveling on the one after 909
I said move over honey I'm traveling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on, baby, don't be cold as ice
Said she's traveling on the one after 909

I got my bag, run to the station
Railman says you've got the the wrong location
I got my bag, run right home
Then I find I've got the number wrong

Well she said she's traveling on the one after 909
I said move over honey I'm traveling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on, baby, don't be cold as ice
Said she's traveling on the one after 9-0
Said she's traveling on the one after 9-0
Said she's traveling on the one after 909
