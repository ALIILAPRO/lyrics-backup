		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ten, twenty, thirty, forty
Tell me that you want to hold me
Tell me that you want to bore me
Tell me that you gotta show me
Tell me that you need to slowly
Tell me that yr burning for me
Tell me that you can't afford me
Time to tell yr dirty story
Time f'are turning over and over
Time f'are turning four leaf clover

Betting on the bull in the heather

Ten, twenty, thirty, forty
Tell me that you want to scold me
Tell me that you a-dore me
Tell me that you're famous for me
Tell me that yr gonna score me
Tell me that you gotta show me
Tell me that you need to sorely
Time to tell yr love story
Time f'are turning over and over
Time f'are turning four leaf clover
Betting on the bull in the heather
