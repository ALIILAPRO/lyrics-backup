		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Peel back the layers of my skin
Who am I? Who am I? Who am I?
Tell me who the fuck have I been
(It's a lie, it's a lie, it's a lie)

Brace yourself this is
It's hard enough, fall part
I fade into blank (space)

Same shit, same place
I-i dissolve, just a flame
Withering in the wind (gone)

Peel back the layers of my skin
(Take a look inside)
Who am I? Who am I? Who am I?
Tell me who the fuck have I been
After all this time
It's a lie, it's a lie, it's a lie

I believe you're a thief
Stealing what I leave behind
With nothing to spare

Copying everything
(Wasting reality)
Do you even care?

Peel back the layers of my skin
(Take a look inside)
Who am I? Who am I? Who am I?
Tell me who the fuck have I been
(After all this time)
It's a lie, it's a lie, it's a lie
Do I live in this shell or just sever ties?
It feels like the old me is dead inside
(Fuck)

Peel back the layers of my skin
Who am I? Who am I? Who am I?
Tell me who the fuck have I been
(After all this time)
It's a lie, it's a lie, it's a lie

Peel back the layers of my skin
(Take a look inside)
Who am I? Who am I? Who am I?
Tell me who the fuck have I been
(Don't you look inside)
It's a lie, it's a goddamn fucking lie
Lie
