		  L L L Let's a-go!

It get wicked when I'm walking with it
(Lil' bitch)
It get wicked when I'm walking with it
(yeah come)
I don't aim 'cause the Glock hold 50
(Goddamn)
I don't aim 'cause the Glock hold 50
(R-r ra)
It get wicked when I'm walking with it
(Lil' bitch)
It get wicked when I'm walking with it
(Lil' bitch)
I don't aim 'cause the Glock hold 50
(God damn)
I don't aim 'cause the Glock hold 50
(Lil' bitch)

Come to the door and them bullets gon' meet
(Boom boom)
Just like his mama was coming to greet
(Whoop whoop) knocked off his top
Now his whole family grieving (Lil' bitch)
X ray vision, this an opp, I'ma see him
(H Hey)
'Cause he gotta die, he ain't a snare
No way he can slide (Lil' ho)
19 bullets in the side of his ride (Skrrt)
He talking tough
He wanna fight 'cause he know that he buff
(Lil' bitch)
I'm the wrong nigga, boy you fucking up
(He dead) the laws can't catch me
They knowing what's up (They know)
Get rid of the body and burner (What?)
They don't even know it's a murder (Murder)
In the hood, they know he a goner (He dead)
He slumped like Adrien Broner (Goddamn)
I love to smoke, Lil Loaded a stoner (Woah)
You think that's your bitch? Well
I'm finna phone her (Bitch)
I love the bass
Make me wanna shoot a opp in the face
(Lil' bitch)
Jump on a plane and go to the next state
(Next state)
Go hit a site 'cause it ain't that safe
(Nope)
Spin in the Nissan and chill in the Wraith
(Skrrt) banging the paint just like Blake
(Glock bitch)
Blood on his face, they thought it was cake
(Like cake)
Avatar, I got the elements (What?)
That fire gon' leave that boy melon lit
(Boom)
That water gon' wash up the evidence (Ayy)
I got the wind, I like to blow
That's what's gon' keep the
Boys from telling it
Oh, I forgot the last element (What?)
The earth is where I'm finna bury him
(What?)
I got the pack and I'm selling it (So?)
This a real nigga test and you failing it
(Lil bitch)
38 special, them shells is catchin' it
(Boom boom)

It get wicked when I'm walking with it
(Lil' bitch)
It get wicked when I'm walking with it
(yeah come)
I don't aim 'cause the Glock hold 50
(Goddamn)
I don't aim 'cause the Glock hold 50
(R-r ra)
It get wicked when I'm walking with it
(Lil' bitch)
It get wicked when I'm walking with it
(Lil' bitch)
I don't aim 'cause the Glock hold 50
(God damn)
I don't aim 'cause the Glock hold 50
(Lil' bitch)

Boy, I get busy when I'm in the city (Huh)
Picked up a Glock, it got a 50 (yeah, yeah)
Called up Boss Top, told him, "Come get me"
(yeah, yeah)
Last situation we was in, it got sticky
(Boom) investigation, man
These pigs tryin' to get me (What?)
No hesitation, blow it if he come near me
(Boom) went right through his stomach
It knocked out his kidney (Boom)
Bitch, it ain't no question
You know we get busy (yeah)
I aim for his top
Bullets ain't never gon' stop (Boom, boom)
I put that boy in a box, he run out his socks
(Huh) you know I'm claiming O' Block
(What?) , my niggas been through a lot
I'm chasing the guap
(Vroom) , fast, I'm on his ass (Vroom
Vroom) i'ma need me a big bag
I was just in that jam, damn
Now here I am, every feature, I just spazzed
(Von)

It get wicked when I'm walking with it
It get wicked when I'm walking with it
I don't aim 'cause the Glock hold 50
I don't aim 'cause the Glock hold 50
It get wicked when I'm walking with it
It get wicked when I'm walking with it
I don't aim 'cause the Glock hold 50
I don't aim 'cause the Glock hold 50
