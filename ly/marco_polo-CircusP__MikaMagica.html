		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Couldn't even hide it, yeah
Thought I was being so slick
I was being double sided, yeah
2D, 4D, eight dimensions divided
Fight it no more
I couldn't fight it no more

So when you coming 'round again
'Cause you got me thinkin' that
I should just trash all that
self improvement bullsh-

When you coming 'round again
'Cause you're always leaving
Faster than the flash of my camera
When we're together

Marco, Polo
Hey, where'd you go?
Marco, Polo
Want you to hold me close
Marco, Polo
Hey, where'd you go?
Marco, Polo
Come and give me one more dose

And sometimes we'll go months without talking
Then you text me like it were nothing
I don't know where you've gone
I don't know what you're on
And I don't know how to stay mad for long

'ause I can't hide it, yeah

Thought I'm the one who was playing
But you're the one in diamond, yeah
2D, 4D, eight dimensions divided
Blinded no more
But I still want you more and more

So when you coming 'round again
'Cause you got me thinkin 'bout
Just what I'll drop the moment
You call me, baby

When you coming 'round again
'Cause you're always leaving
Starker than the crop of my camera
When we're together

Marco, Polo
Hey, where'd you go?
Marco, Polo
Want you to hold me close
Marco, Polo
Hey, where'd you go?
Marco, Polo
Come and give me one more dose

Marco
Polo
Marco
Polo
Marco
Polo
Marco
