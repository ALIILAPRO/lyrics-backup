		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Got a fever in my head and it's burning me alive
I can't keep this up like the animal inside
Got a fever in my head and it's burning me alive
I can't keep this up like the animal inside

Creatures out my mind, I'm slowly breaking free through lucid dreams
Day to day I may just break, safe to say I'm no human being
My mind's unstable, my mood just swings, it's painful as you would think
My face full of putrid things, dark angels until it sinks

Retribution
I fulfill a lot of my purpose
While I'm getting through this
Something waking deep within these depths of ruins

Got a fever in my head and it's burning me alive
I can't keep this up like the animal inside

Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who is real and who will fall?
There's a time bomb going off
What's the cost? What's the cost?
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Show me violence, give me war
I will die here by the sword
I am the animal, I am the animal

Mirror mirror on the ceiling
Fenty, Prada, so conceited
Swear to God, I'm God
A reincarnate of a fucking demon
I'm afraid of what I'm feeling, I'm a psychopath
I'm afraid of what they'll see and what they'll love
I'm afraid of what I'm feeling, I'm a murderer
I'm a motherfucking animal

Got a fever in my head and it's burning me alive
I can't keep this up like the animal inside

Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who is real and who will fall?
There's a time bomb going off
What's the cost? What's the cost?
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Show me violence, give me war
I will die here by the sword
I am the animal, I am the animal

Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who is real and who will fall?
We're a time bomb going off
What's the cost? What's the cost?
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Show me violence, give me war
I will die here by the sword
I am the animal, I am the animal

The animal

Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who is real and who will fall?
There's a time bomb going off
What's the cost? What's the cost?
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Show me violence, give me war
I will die here by the sword
I am the animal, I am the animal

The animal
