		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let me tell you that I wanna hold you tonight
Wanna kiss your lips want you to be mine
Never thought that I actually need you the most
You're amazing for me now you need me to go
Let me show the game please show me again
I want you to say I need you to stay
I got you in my mind I can't get away
Got you baby now I got something to say
And you're leaving now it's so hilarious babe
And I actually miss you it's serious babe
I know you know that we haven't talked in a while
Let me talk to you I'm so delirious babe 
Oh no no - no oh 

I'm giving up I just wanna go
Didn't realize that you never said
Said I love you babe, said I miss you babe
Baby didn't I? But you didn't wait
I'm just giving up I just wanna go
Even when I know that it's getting late
I just didn't know it that you didn't know it
It's just getting over I just wanna go then oh 

Na na na, na na na, na na na, na na na
Na na na, na na na, na na na, na na na(na na)
Na na na(no no), na na na(no no), na na na(no no), na na na(no no)
Na na na(no no), na na na(no no), na na na(no no), na na na 

Gotta be the one to say do you remember?
I'm doin' it like I did it on November
I'ma do anything to make you to love me
That's what I do but you're never gonna trust me
If you count on me I'ma show you babe
That nobody's gonna know you like I know you babe
We try again, try fly again
We can do anything that you like yeah 

I'm like fuck yeah
I'm keeping your purple lighter
When I miss I hold it tighter
When I miss I hold it tighter(yeah ah)
Fuck yeah
I'm keeping your purple lighter
When I miss I hold it tighter
When I miss I hold it tighter(yeah ah) 

I'm giving up I just wanna go
Didn't realize that you never said
Said I love you babe, said I miss you babe
Baby didn't I? But you didn't wait
I'm just giving up I just wanna go
Even when I know that it's getting late
I just didn't know it that you didn't know it
It's just getting over I just wanna go then oh 

Na na na, na na na, na na na, na na na
Na na na, na na na, na na na, na na na(na na)
Na na na(no no), na na na(no no), na na na(no no), na na na(no no)
Na na na(no no), na na na(no no), na na na
