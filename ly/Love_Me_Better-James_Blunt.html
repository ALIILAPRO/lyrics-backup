		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  People say the meanest things
Yeah I've been called a dick, I've been called so many things
I know I've done some shit that I admit deserves it, but that
That don't mean it doesn't sting
Saw you standing outside a bar
Would have said you're beautiful but I've used that line before
Now I've had my share of shallow nights
'Cause I was scared to get it right
So I was hanging with whoever

But baby then you
You love, love, love me, love me better
You love, love, love me, love me better
There's been times I gave myself
To someone else, to someone lesser than you
Love, love, love me, love me better

Love me better

When I met you I was treading water
And baby I know you know I got an eye that wanders
But right now in this car that we're driving to your sister's
All I'm lookin' for is something that's forever

Baby then you
You love, love, love me, love me better
You love, love, love me, love me better
There've been people that I've loved before
But they were something lesser, 'cause you
Love, love, love me, love me better

Love me
Love me better
Love me
Love me better

People say the meanest things
Yeah, but truth be told, I don't care what they think
I got someone who is lying in my bed right next to me
Yeah she love, love, loves me
Love, love, loves me
Love me better

Loves me better

There's been times I gave myself
To someone else, to someone lesser than you
Love, love, love me, love me better
