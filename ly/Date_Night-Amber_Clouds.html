		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's winding down
We're far away 
I'm holding on to what's left of this day
We'll watch the sun go down
Then go to bed
We'll be fast asleep
While we're still awake

I don't know what I'm seeing
I can't tell if I'm dreaming
I don't know what I can do but feel you
I don't know what I'm seeing 
I can't tell if I'm dreaming
I don't know what I can do but feel this

Paper raindrops fall 
Spreading through my veins 
This could go so wrong 
Am I panicing? 
It's gone off the ground 
This is meant to be 
Just you and me
In our fantasy 

I don't know what I'm seeing
I can't tell if I'm dreaming
I don't know what I can do but feel you
I don't know what I'm seeing 
I can't tell if I'm dreaming
I don't know what I can do but feel this
