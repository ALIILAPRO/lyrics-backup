		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I just don’t feel those sparks fly not anymore
The way that my heart used to melt right through to the floor
Something’s different every time you kiss my neck 
Or have your arms wrapped round my chest
Don’t know when but the feelings left

So I know I can’t stay
But I’m terrified of walking away

How do I start over?
How do I, how do I
Find closure?
Staring at the ceiling
While all my walls are screaming

How do I reopen
My baggage you’ve been holding
Let somebody else see me
And then hand over my feelings
How do I, how do I?

It’s okay I’ve known this was coming for a while now
Your smiles been different whenever I would come around
But I love you enough to let you go, I know it’s gonna hurt but it’s unbearable
To hold someone who doesn’t want me anymore 
Guess this is the end for us..

So I know I can’t stay
But I’m so scared I’ll never love the same

How do I start over?
How do I, how do I
Find closure?
Staring at the ceiling
While all my walls are screaming

How do I reopen
My baggage you’ve been holding
Let somebody else see me
And then hand over my feelings
How do I, how do I…

Delete all your pictures
And give back your t-shirt
How do I turn the page and walk away from all the plans we made?

How do I start over?
How do I, how do I
Find closure?
Staring at the ceiling
While all my walls are screaming

How do I reopen
My baggage you’ve been holding
Let somebody else see me
And then hand over my feelings
How do I, how do I?

How do I, how do I? 
(How do we start over?)
How do I get closer?
(Cause I’ll always remember)
How do I start over?
How do I…
