		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh me my
Tryna mask that we fine
Staring at this clock I close my eyes but I still see time
Every step I take it got me wishin' I could rewind
I could read your feelings know it's hard for you to read mine
Oh me my
Tryna mask that we fine
Staring at this clock I close my eyes but I still see time
Every step I take it got me wishin' I could rewind
I could read your feelings know it's hard for you to read mine
Took some time to realize
That I cannot just run from my problems
It takes me and my conscious to solve 'em
I can't sleep
I can't breathe
I'm too nauseous
I can't step
Hard to trust
I'm too cautious
Of where I'll end up
Devil on my left sayin' I won't be enough
Angels on my right side they calling out the bluff
Cause I'm next up with my chest up and God say that I'm tuff
So you can bet on me
God said to bet on me
Nah we don't play He knows the way and it's ahead of me
I trust your word and it's my sword all on my enemies
The truth shall pass right through the glass and imma let 'em see
Oh I
Swear that I told you a million times
Swear that I told you a million times
Heart on my sleeve know it's hard to believe but I know that your truth is the heart of divine
I'm patiently waiting
See but I'm jaded
Top of my lungs is when you hear me sayin'
Oh me my
Tryna mask that we fine
Staring at this clock
I close my eyes but I still see time
Every step I take it got me wishin' I could rewind
I could read your feelings know it's hard for you to read mine
Took some time to realize
That I cannot just run from my problems
It takes me and my conscious to solve 'em
I can't sleep
I can't breathe
I'm too nauseous
I can't step
Hard to trust
I'm too cautious
