		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When you get weak, and you need to test your will
When life's complete, but there's something missing still
Distracting you from this must be the one you love
Must be the one whose magic touch can change your mind
Don't let another day go by without the magic touch

Distracting you				(change your mind)
Supporting you				(change your mind)
Embracing you				(change your mind)
Convincing you				(change your mind)

When you're confused and the world has got you down
When you feel used and you just can't play the clown
Protecting you from this must be the one you love
Must be the one whose magic touch can change your mind
Don't let another day go by without the magic touch

Protecting you				(change your mind)
Restoring you				(change your mind)
Revealing you				(change your mind)
Soothing you				(change your mind)

You hear the sound, you wait around and get the word
You see the picture changing everything you've heard
Destroying you with this must be the one you love
Must be the one whose magic touch can change your mind
Don't let another day go by without the magic touch

Destroying you				(change your mind)
Embracing you				(change your mind)
Protecting you				(change your mind)
Confining you				(change your mind)
Distracting you				(change your mind)
Supporting you				(change your mind)
Distorting you				(change your mind)
Controlling you				(change your mind)
Change your mind			(change your mind)
Change your mind, change your mind	(change your mind)
Change your mind			(change your mind)

The morning comes and there's an odor in the room
The scent of love, more than a million roses bloom
Embracing you with this must be the one you love
Must be the one whose magic touch can change your mind
Don't let another day go by without the magic touch

Embracing you				(change your mind)
Concealing you				(change your mind)
Protecting you				(change your mind)
Revealing you				(change your mind)
Change your mind, change your mind	(change your mind)
Change your mind			(change your mind)
Change your mind, change your mind	(change your mind)
Change your mind			(change your mind)
Change your mind, change your mind
Change your mind
Change your mind, change your mind
Change your mind
Change your mind, change your mind
Change your mind, change your mind
