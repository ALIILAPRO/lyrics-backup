		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hypnotized, the serpent's eyes
Draw me to the venomous lies
Take me down the path of failure
And to my imminent demise

Ice is flowing through my veins
And his touch gives me a frozen heart
Paralyzed, in his eyes I can see the hypocrisy
And his noxious grin convinces me
That I'll get what I need so he plants the seed
And immediately, I feel invincibility
But it can't be real, it doesn't make sense
That I can feel so incomplete

What you have done?
I can't move but I feel like I am free
There's blood everywhere
I'm losing my mind, this isn't me

This venom flowing through my veins
Has set me free but I'm still wrapped in chains
Emotions are true, the words are fake
I've been paralyzed be this venomous snake
This venom flowing through my veins
Consumes my soul but it takes away the pain
Emotions are true, the words are fake
I've been paralyzed be this venomous snake

Ice is flowing through my veins
And his touch gives me a frozen heart
I'm breaking down but I must regain
My strength so I can tear us apart

I won't succumb
My body is numb but I'm growing stronger
Now that I have you be your throat
I'll take your life and everything you own

Almighty serpent
You shall serve me now
I've taken the throne
Warn them of my rebirth
I'll conquer this earth and make it my own

I am your master
I own your soul
You are the bastard son of flesh and blood
