		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell me what you see when you are on the other side
Been there once before and I wish that I never died
Tell me, tell me what you see when you are on the other side
Beat me once before and I wish that I never died

Talk, talk to 'em baby, come and talk to 'em
I got the Glock to 'em, hit 'em like my pops do 'em
Did ya', did ya' dirty, take a sip, my stomach hurtin'
Feel the burnin', come and hear your stomach turnin'
I get tired of these bitches, come and get it for me
I get tired of these snitches, you a fuckin' phony
You abide by the rules, you think you're fuckin' tough
Better knuckle up before I come and take the dub
You a sinner, better hope that you're a swimmer
Time for dinner see the water, shine it glimmer
Gotta feed the feelin', like it when you bleedin'
Got a feelin' and I cut ya deep I mean it
I'm too high, I think I'm 'bout to hit the ceilin'
I am stealin' what God gave you, it is healin'

Tell me what you see when you are on the other side
Been there once before and I wish that I never died

I could never face it, no I can't and no I won't
I will only help the darkness grippin' on your throat
You can only hope that I give you one more chance
Do a little dance and I might just save your mans

Tell me what you see when you are on the other side
Been there once before and I wish that I never died
Tell me, tell me what you see when you are on the other side
Been there once before and I wish that I never died
Tell me, tell me what you see when you are on the other side
Been there once before and I wish that I never died
Tell me, tell me what you see when you are on the other side
Been there once before and I wish that I never died
