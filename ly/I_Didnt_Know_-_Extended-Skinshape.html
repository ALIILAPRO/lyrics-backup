		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I didn't know about those other things
I could've been there but now it's too late
We're only here for an hour, you won't know 'till its gone
Try to find the best, I know you
I didn't know that you would leave so soon
I  could've tried a little harder to make you smile once more
One day I'll come to find you, wherever you may be
If only time was kinder, you would still be here
