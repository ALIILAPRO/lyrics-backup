		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One of these days
You'll break me of many things
Some cold white day
But you're crazy if you think I would leave you this way

You should wake up (wake up)
Before the wrath comes
Me and you could take off (take off)
Before the wrath comes soon

And one of these days
I pray it will be sometime soon
On a day like today
You'd be crazy not to want me to teach you the way

You should wake up (wake up)
Before the wrath comes
Me and you could take off (take off)
Before the wrath comes

Well, I know what you're like
I've read it on the walls
You're too tired
You choose heaven over the earth and me
But come on, please

You should wake up (wake up)
Before the wrath comes
Me and you could take off (take off)
Before the wrath comes

Maybe you should take off (take off)
Yeah, you should take off (take off)
