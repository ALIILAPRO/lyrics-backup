		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They say distance is relative
And relative to relatives I have
I'd say I'm relatively close
To breaking down
Because right now
I feel so alone
I've been missing the elements and
Wishing the elephant in the room
Would leave and kindly close the door
I can't ignore
Him like before
Not anymore

Oh I, miss you most at
Six feet apart when you're
Right outside my window
But can't ride inside my car
And it hurts to know just how lovely you are
And be too far away to hold but close enough to break my heart
I miss your smile
Feels like miles
Six feet apart

So far, so far but so close
Like a star, out in the cosmos
Can't touch, the beauty I see
That's how, it feels at six feet

Space and time are interwoven
Well at least that's what we're told
When I was young I was suspicious but it's true
Time sticks like glue
I feel so blue
Here missing you
So I think I'll build a time machine and go back to a time
When we didn't need to measure six feet on the ground
When I came around
That's not allowed
I can't go back now

So I, miss you most at
Six feet apart when you're
Right outside my window
But can't ride inside my car
And it hurts to know just how lovely you are
And be too far away to hold but close enough to break my heart
I miss your smile
Feels like miles
Six feet apart

So far, so far but so close
Like a star, out in the cosmos
Can't touch, the beauty I see
That's how, it all feels to me
So far, so far but so close
Like a star, out in the cosmos
Can't touch, the beauty I see
That's how, it feels at six feet
