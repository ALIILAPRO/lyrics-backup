		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm a little scared you'll leave
Even though you tell me you won't
I'm a little scared of being
Someone that you're scared to love
But you don't talk the way he did
And you don't say the things he did
And I'm not who I was back then
But still

I'm a little scared to speak
Cause I can't find the words to say
That I don't wanna make this about me
I just can't hold it in today
But you don't play the games he did
And you don't make me feel like shit
And my mom likes you more than him
But still

How do I tell you
That I've come to like the pain?
How do I tell you
That I don't know what it means
To be happy with somebody
Don't know anything bout that
Who the hell can write a love song
Without making it too sad
That's all I've been
How do I tell you
How do I tell you
I got it from him?

I'm a little prone to feel
A little overwhelmed with it all
Cause you are someone I want to know
And I hope that you don't let me fall
You make sure I get home safe
And you always know what to say
And I feel like I've found my place
But still

How do I tell you
That I've come to like the pain?
How do I tell you
That I don't know what it means
To be happy with somebody
Don't know anything bout that
Who the hell can write a love song
Without making it too sad
That's all I've been
How do I tell you
How do I tell you
I got it from him?

How do I tell you
I got it from him?
