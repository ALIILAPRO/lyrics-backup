		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You said you'd always want me
You told me to wait for you 
Now I am haunted
Our lips became liars now the liars twist the truth 

I followed the rules for the
Games we've been playing
My love let you break them
My wasted fool
Danced for your fingers
The marks you left linger
Cut my own strings
Just to give 'em to you

I fall down for you
I really should know better babe, you'd never save me
I fall down for you
How could I know your touch would break me, we're gone crazy
Now
If I must die for you
I'll make sure they find you with blood on your hands
You'll join me in death 
Oh baby 
Shoot me where I stand 

I loaded up the gun
If you love me baby you'll prove it and run
All your cards on the table 
Without you playing my bullets ain't fun

I followed the rules for the
Games we've been playing
My love let you break them
My wasted fool
Dance for your fingers
The marks you left linger
Cut my own strings
Just to give 'em to you

I fall down for you
I really should know better babe, you'd never save me
I fall down for you
How could I know your touch would break me, we're gone crazy
Now
If I must die for you
I'll make sure they find you with blood on your hands
You'll join me in death 
Oh baby 
Shoot me where I stand 

I fall down for you
I really should know better babe
I really should know better babe
