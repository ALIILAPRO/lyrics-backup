		  (Helluva made this beat, baby)

Until you got your own shit, you ain't on no grown shit
Bumped my head a couple times 'cause I was never shown shit
You ain't gettin' money no more, stop bringin' up old shit
Nigga, I'm used to bein' lit, I do turnt shit and don't take no flicks
But I been left on stuck before, these hoes ain't pick up before
I remember everybody was fresh, I was bummy though
Ask 'em can I get some money with 'em, I ain't gettin' nothin' though
Hell nah, I don't hate them niggas, I don't love 'em though (I don't hate them niggas)
But thanks for turnin' on my album, I fuck with you (I appreciate it)
Hope you find some shit in me that end up stuck with you (real shit)
Fucked my head up when I saw what this money do (shit was crazy)
People hate that I ain't think of hate, like how that come from you? (From you?)

I said, if you fuck with me, I fuck with you (fuck with me)
Hope you find some shit in me that end up stuck with you (I hope you do)
Fucked my head up when I saw what this money do
They like, "Tee, what's up with you?" I'm up, bitch, ain't nothin' new
I ain't tryna talk after we fuck, go find you somethin' to do (get on)
Niggas that don't like me cliquin' up, that's what dick suckers do (I see it)
Flyin' in that new shit, we ain't flexin', we just slidin' through
Don't play with me, that shit ain't worth what they gon' put your mama through (on my mama)
I been stayin' out the way a lot, gettin' paid a lot (yeah)
Don't come 'round me braggin' 'bout no bodies, how much pape' you got? (How much pape' you got?)
City mines, I'm gon' run this bitch until my ankle pop (until my ankle pop)
Told bro to stop swingin' that belt, but I can't make him stop (I can't make him stop)
I woke and text the bitch I hit three days ago (three days)
Ask her did she take that Plan B, okay, I'm makin' sure (don't play)
You say money don't mean shit, okay, in other words, you broke (you fucked up)
Rock designer with no logo, this that if you know, you know (I'm rich)
Let me hear you hatin', send my rich friends to fuck your whore (go get her)
Police get behind us, okay, let's see what this do in sport (we gone)
They got gun licenses, all them sticks for sure, them niggas dorks (bustin')
If we get on niggas' ass, they for sure gon' come to court (them niggas rats)
Hold up, wait, my nigga
I ain't never used to run with you (I ain't never used to fuck with you)
So why you actin' so surprised I don't fuck with you? (I barely know you)
Fucked my head when I saw what this money do (fucked me up)
Fucked they head up when they saw all them hundreds blue (fucked 'em up)
Connected like wifi, niggas fake as sci-fi
Remember when I couldn't afford the Rollie
Look at how time fly (ayy, look how time fly)
I remember you was pussy, brodie say you slidin' now (oh, you on that now?)
I fuck with hoodrats, from time to time I need that thot top (I need it)
I try to be friendly as it get (I do)
I'll hate to have this nigga come and hit you in your shit (he gon' do it)
He gon' ask me where you at, he ain't gon' ask me what you did (he don't give a fuck)
But I gotta watch this nigga too, ain't that 'bout a bitch? (Trust nobody)

But, ayy, thanks for turnin' on my album, I fuck with you (I appreciate it)
Hope you find some shit in me that end up stuck with you (you know I'm genuine)
Fucked my head when I saw what this money do (fucked me up)
Fucked they head up when they saw all them hundreds blue, ah (fucked 'em up)

Yes, sir
