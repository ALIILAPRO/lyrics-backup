		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Strolling off the tracks
You keep your eyes on the facts
I keep my eyes on the feel
Together it is real

Strolling off the path
Trying to unravel the math
The math of this cubicle
The journey is beautiful

Come along with me
And unravel the myth
Come along and see
We will find the key

Strolling off the path
Trying to unravel the math
The math of this cubicle
The journey is beautiful

Ooh there comes the ram
It leaves you and me on the lam
It wants to slam us with our heads into truth
Weâ€™re on the lam in-between mature en youth

Come along with me
And unravel the myth
Come along and see
We will find the key


Come along with me
And unravel the myth
Come along and see
We will find the key

Come along with me
And unravel the myth
Come along and see
We will find the key
