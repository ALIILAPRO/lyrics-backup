		  Mm
Stop playin' with 'em Riot

Yeah, pretty gyal, me no do no kiss and tell
As long as you treat me well, I will treat you more than gem
Me no send my chains, you are my real flex
Aye, yeah, gimme promise you ain't gonna bail on me

Lookin' at you got my eyes wide, damn (got my eyes wide)
Lookin' at you got my eyes wide, damn
So outta this world like sci-fi (grrah)
Lookin' at you got my eyes wide, damn (lookin' at you got my eyes wide)
Lookin' at you got my eyes wide, damn, so outta this world like sci-fi

I am the one that got lotta bands
Who you becomin'? Well, that depends (ah-ah)
Jump in the air, I perfect my stance
Jump to the floor, I just wanna dance (ah-ah)
Yeah, you the one, there's no number two
If I had three wishes, I'd waste 'em on you
Watch what you say, got faces on me
No waist is on me
Yeah, yeah, oh

Yeah, pretty gyal, me no do no kiss and tell
As long as you treat me well, I will treat you more than gem
Me no send my chains, you are my real flex
Aye, yeah, gimme promise you ain't gonna bail on me
Yeah, pretty gyal, me no do no kiss and tell
As long as you treat me well, I will treat you more than gem
Me no send my chains, you are my real flex
Aye, yeah, gimme promise you ain't gonna bail on me

Grrah
I ain't been in love in a minute
Don't know what it was, but you get it (ah-ah)
Big three words out ya mouth and you meant it
You can get it, play your cards right, bet it (grrah)
It's our life, so baby, let's live it
Haters super mad, we got 'em all livid (grrah)
Thinkin' 'bout my future, got you all in it (like)
Shootin' for the stars, the sky has no limit (grrah)

Yeah, pretty gyal, me no do no kiss and tell
As long as you treat me well, I will treat you more than gem
Me no send my chains, you are my real flex
Aye, yeah, gimme promise you ain't gonna bail on me
Yeah, pretty gyal, me no do no kiss and tell
As long as you treat me well, I will treat you more than gem
Me no send my chains, you are my real flex
Aye, yeah, gimme promise you ain't gonna bail on me
