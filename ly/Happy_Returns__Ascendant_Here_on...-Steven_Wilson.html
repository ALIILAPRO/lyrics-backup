		  Hey brother, happy returns, it's been a while now
I bet you thought that I was dead
But I'm still here, nothing's changed

Hey brother, I'd love to tell you I've been busy
But that would be a lie
Cos the truth is the years just pass like trains
I wave but they don't slow down

Hey brother, I see the freaks and dispossessed on day release
Avoiding the police
I feel I'm falling once again
But now there's no one left to catch me

Hey brother, I feel I'm living in parentheses
And I got trouble with the bills
Do the kids remember me?
Well I got gifts for them, and for you and sorrow
But I'm feeling kind of drowsy now
So I'll finish this tomorrow
