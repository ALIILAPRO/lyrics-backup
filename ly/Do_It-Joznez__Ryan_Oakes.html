		  DO IT

[Intro]
So when you say that you really wanna beat me (DO IT)
Talking loud thinking that you can defeat me (DO IT)
It’s just a bunch of lies that they love to feed me (DO IT)
Talk is cheap if you really bout it meet me (DO IT)

[Verse 1]
I think my favorite taste is the sweat on my lips,
I got the weight of the world but I’m still keeping my grip,
It’s one shot up at my dreams so I’m loading the clip,
I’m boutta’ pop that and send ‘em to a solar eclipse,
'Cause they ain’t seen nobody like me when I do it with precision,
See, everything I see inside my head comes true and the vision,
Is telling me I’m really the greatest, I’ll be on television,
There ain’t nobody walking this planet that’s in better condition,
That’s why they see me on the field and Ima run up the digits,
If practice makes perfect then my whole life is a scrimmage,
This wasn’t luck I didn’t fall right into a golden ticket,
It’s because I was never scared to do the things that you didn’t

[Chorus 1]
So when say you gonna beat me, boy you better (DO IT)
Talking loud thinking that you can defeat me (DO IT)
Just a bunch of lies that you love to feed me (DO IT)
Talk is cheap if you really bout it meet me (DO IT)
So when say that you really gonna beat me (DO IT)
Talking loud thinking that you can defeat me (DO IT)
Just a bunch of lies that you love to feed me (DO IT)
Talk is cheap if you really bout it meet me (DO IT)

[Drop 1]
8x (DO IT)

[Verse 2]
I ain’t ever been afraid to say the way that I feel,
So when they write up on my grave they gonna write that I’m real,
Man, people love to run they mouth whenever they standing still,
Meanwhile my whole life been looking top ten highlight reel,
Cuz ain’t nobody living right now can compete with all my skills,
Can’t even catch me on any photos if I’m not standing still,
Only ever learned how to be excellent never learned how to chill,
No wonder contracts coming in are always worth a couple of mill,
A hundred on the dash, homie I ain’t ever slowing down,
Why you think all the fans rock my jerseys in the crowd,
I run it up, every time so they screaming my name loud,
Life has always been a game and I ain't take no time out
[Chorus 2]

So when you say that you really wanna beat me (DO IT)
Talking loud thinking that you can defeat me (DO IT)
It’s just a bunch of lies that they love to feed me (DO IT)
Talk is cheap if you really bout it meet me (DO IT)

[3x]
So when say that you really gonna beat me (DO IT)
Talking loud thinking that you can defeat me (DO IT)
Just a bunch of lies that you love to feed me (DO IT)
Talk is cheap if you really bout it meet me (DO IT)

[Drop 2]
8x (DO IT)
