		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I hide only to defy you
Take away the only love inside you
I'll see your face through everyone
Inside I've just begun
You think I'm out to scare you?
I'm only out to prepare you
For when you stop and turn around
Your body's going down

You're gonna waste your time
Your life will soon be mine
You're definitely one of a kind
Your suffering 'cause of me is divine

Tell me, why you never liked me?
Tell me once that you'll fight me
Bold, and I'll wait for the perfect time
To take what's rightfully mine
You play the dumb to defy me
You say that you don't but defy me
You wait, you don't want anyone
Oh well

You're gonna waste your time
Your life will soon be mine
You're definitely one of a kind
Your suffering 'cause of me is divine

Know what? Fuck you, I'm fed up with you
I'm not as good as you? Fuck no, I'm better than you
Know what? Fuck you, I'm fed up with you
I'm not as good as you? Fuck no, I'm better than you

You know what? Fuck you, I'm fed up with you
I'm not as good as you? Fuck no, I'm better than you
You know what? Fuck you, I'm fed up with you
I'm not as good as you? Fuck no, I'm better than you

Know what? Fuck you, I'm fed up with you
I'm not as good as you? Fuck no, I'm better than you
Know what? Fuck you, I'm fed up with you
I'm not as good as you? Fuck no, I'm better than you

Know what? Fuck you, I'm fed up with you
I'm not as good as you? Fuck no, I'm better than you
Know what? Fuck you, I'm fed up with you
I'm not as good as you? Fuck no, I'm better than you

You're gonna waste your time
Your life will soon be mine
You're definitely one of a kind
Your suffering 'cause of me is divine

Did you really think
You'd beat me at my own game?
You tried to see what you got
Me ripping at your brain
