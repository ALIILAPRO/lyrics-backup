		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And I think it was
Last week
Shoving ten of my friends in the backseat
We were way too drunk, call a taxi
Last week
Can't remember a thing
Everyday of the week I was sleeping till' three
Last week
Everybody was looking right past me
All my friends outside look so happy
It's just killing me
Stuck in my mind, it's not the place to be
Last week
Everybody was looking right past me
All my friends outside look so happy
It's just killing me
Stuck in my mind, it's not the place to be
Last week
Everybody was looking right past me
All my friends outside look so happy
It's just killing me
Stuck in my mind, it's not the place to be
I don't think you know how I feel
None of this shit feel real
If you're gonna take the shot, shoot to kill
I don't think my wounds are ever gonna heal
Crammed in the backseat driving to an unknown destination
I don't know if you're really my friend or are you faking
Looking for my soul, look for my heart, but the spot vacant
Protect myself with all the actions I'm taking
One, two, three, four, five
I down another pill I hope don't come out this alive
I'm living inside a fantasy, I'm living inside a lie
Singing into my mic to get all of this shit off my mind
Don't kiss or tell, I will never tell a lie
Living in hell, I just hope I survive
Trying my hardest, just know that I always try
Struggling, fighting myself, I fight every night
One pill, two pill, I might take another
Bloods gon' spill, dripping all over the covers
Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever be discovered
Took a long time, but I'm starting to recover
Say that you would help me out but now you're nowhere to be seen
Tryna be the nicest that I can but everybody mean
Said that you were worth something but now you're worth nothing to me
Don't even seem like you are my friend, you are an enemy
