		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't mind, don't mind if you cry on my shoulder
Remember, remember the things that I told ya

Darlin', don't you cry, you gon' be alright
Leave it leave it all behind, take it take it off your mind
I know you've had to fight, but things are looking brighter
Let it go tonight I know you need it

Dancing is healing, love is the answer
Dancing is healing, love is the answer
Yeah yeah yeah
When you need space when you need time
When it's gets heavy on your mind
When you lose faith put you hand in mine
When it gets heavy
Dancing is healing, love is the answer

Dancing is healing, love is the answer
Dancing is healing, love is the answer
Yeah yeah yeah
When you need space when you need time
When it's gets heavy on your mind
When you lose faith put you hand in mine
When it gets heavy
Dancing is healing, love is the answer

Don't mind, don't mind if you cry on my shoulder
Remember, remember the things that I told ya

Darlin', don't you cry, you gon' be alright
Leave it leave it all behind, take it take it off your mind
I know you've had to fight, but things are looking brighter
Let it go tonight I know you need it

Dancing is healing, love is the answer
Dancing is healing, love is the answer
Yeah yeah yeah
When you need space when you need time
When it's gets heavy on your mind
When you lose faith put you hand in mine
When it gets heavy
Dancing is healing, love is the answer

Dancing is healing, love is the answer
Dancing is healing, love is the answer
Yeah yeah yeah
When you need space when you need time
When it's gets heavy on your mind
When you lose faith put you hand in mine
When it gets heavy
Dancing is healing, love is the answer
