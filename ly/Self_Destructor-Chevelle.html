		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How many ways and how many words?
Safe in your lies but can't ignore it all
You aren't at all right
Ten million other lives, ooh

Well, it's too much to lose
Ooh, it's time, or self-destruct
They don't care what the science says
They don't wanna talk, no

'Cause this time, ready or not
This time, you fought us all
'Cause this time, you aren't at all right
You aren't at all right
Ten million other lives

How can we save
And how in this time
The lessons we've learned
To rescue the mind before it's gone

Well, it's too much to lose
Ooh, it's time, or self-destruct
They don't care what the science says
They don't wanna talk, no
Well, it's too much to lose
Ooh, it's time, or self-destruct
They don't care what the science says
They don't wanna talk

'Cause this time, ready or not
This time, you fought us all
'Cause this time, you're doubling down
And this time you'll work alone
'Cause this time, you aren't at all
Right

It's like war
It's like war

Bite your tongue
This Nosferatu, ancient ways
It's minimal, these stomach knots
Ooh, this conscience can't hide from his soul
'Til now

It's like war
It's like war
It's like war
It's like war
It's like

Bite you tongue, mmh

'Cause this time, ready or not
This time, you fought us all
'Cause this time, you're doubling down
And this time, you aren't at all right
You aren't at all right
