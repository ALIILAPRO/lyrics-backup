		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh shit (oh shit)
Oh shit (oh shit)
It's another hit (it's another hit)
Get up on it (get up on it)
I'm so horny (I'm so horny)
And I want it (and I want it)
So get up on this (so get up on this)
Get up on the dick (get up on the dick)
Haha (haha)

I want you to know how deep my love goes
I ain't gotta a lot of time, no speech, just follow
Some tricks in and up my sleeve, at the magic show
Got you ridin' on top of me, all around, in and out you go
These stars come from within before I knew your name
I was curious, didn't know if you feel the same
And to see a smile on your face I'll do almost anything
Serious, girl, I don't play no games

I wanna take you out, freak you out, bust my gun and take the charge
As long as you say my name every time I break you off, girl, I'll
Give you what you want, 'cause your love is all I need
I'ma turn you on with all the things I do (all the things I do)
Girl you're made for me, 'cause your love is all I need
And you gon' make that sound from all the things you do (all the things you do)

Take a break as we escape to my Decatur love (love)
Girl you're wet as a dream and I'm ready to break you off (off)
I switched up, my routine is something you never saw (saw)
I'ma make you scream (scream) all night long
When I look into your eyes I know it's real (real)
Spend my whole life tryna find a way to show you how I feel (feel)
You're the only one on my mind and you know the deal (deal)
Make you feel alright, girl, you know I will

I wanna take you out, freak you out, bust my gun and take the charge
As long as you say my name every time I break you off, girl, I'll
Give you what you want, 'cause your love is all I need
I'ma turn you on with all the things I do (all the things I do)
Girl you're made for me 'cause your love is all I need
And you gon' make that sound from all the things you do (from all the things I do)

Oh shit (oh shit)
Oh shit (oh shit)
It's another hit (it's another hit)
Get up on it (get up on it)
I'm so horny (I'm so horny)
And I want it (and I want it)
So get up on this (so get up on this)
Get up on the dick (get up on the dick)
Haha (haha)

I wanna take you out, freak you out, bust my gun and take the charge
As long as you say my name every time I break you off, girl, I'll

Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
