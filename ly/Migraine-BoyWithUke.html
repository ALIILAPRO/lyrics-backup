		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm not a psycho, but I might go crazy
Writing typos, they ask, "Why so shaky?"
Missing my coat, all this pressure hitting my head
I'm on a tightrope, can't hit the high notes
Baby, I need Ibuprofen
I know that you'll take me back home
Don't leave me alone, I need a friend

I don't care what you think of me
I just want to be on top
I'm not stressed that you've never heard of me
You'll be listening non-stop

Hop off the highway
I've been having migraines
I've been waiting for a while to have it my way
Oof, just a boy acting like a goof
I've got fifty-five voices saying
I gotta do what they all say
Got me looking sideways
I don't wanna write a song about a heartbreak
Oof, just a boy acting like a fool
Got a hundred things I'd rather do

I don't like when they try controlling me
The thoughts I fight, they can get a little frightening
But I don't mind, if it means I get to be free
I speak my mind loud when I wanna be up all night
I can tell, they're getting sick of me
But I don't mind, If it means I get to be me

I don't care what you think of me
I just want to be on top
I'm not stressed that you've never heard of me
You'll be listening non-stop

Hop off the highway
I've been having migraines
I've been waiting for a while to have it my way
Oof, just a boy acting like a goof
I've got fifty-five voices saying
I gotta do what they all say
Got me looking sideways
I don't wanna write a song about a heartbreak
Oof, just a boy acting like a fool
Got a hundred things I'd rather do

I just wanna run around, but what do I know?
Like I said before, I'm missing all these high notes
I just wanna
Live a little before I go
I don't wanna lie low
Yeah, I know the subliminal
Messages they're sending me on how to leave a legacy
It's harder when you're farther and they're never letting constantly
And speaking over what you see
It's like they're coming after me
Can someone teach me how to breathe?
Tell me what I need

I don't care what you think of me
I just want to be on top
I'm not stressed that you've never heard of me
You'll be listening non-stop

Hop off the highway
I've been having migraines
I've been waiting for a while to have it my way
Oof, just a boy acting like a goof
I've got fifty-five voices saying
I gotta do what they all say
Got me looking sideways
I don't wanna write a song about a heartbreak
Oof, just a boy acting like a fool
Got a hundred things I'd rather do
