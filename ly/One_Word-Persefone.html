		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Amongst the shaking
I had once found myself still
Navigating a storm
Full of austere simplicity

Caressing my full being
This vessel I carry

Alive and latent
I could not distinguish
All the parts of me
Even so
Inside I was all empty

Obscure and evanescent
The secret sound will prevail

I keep dreaming of the one word
That can't be named
I keep dreaming of the one word
That cannot be named
I keep dreaming of the one word
That can't be named
I keep dreaming of the one word
That can't be named

I embrace the state of thoughtlessness
So I become one with the whole
As the one word
I too was born in emptiness

I too was born in emptiness

I long for the moment
We no longer use hollow tongues

Existing through my whole being
This empty vessel I carry
I am not one face
For I am many
I go beyond
every tie
That binds us to
a realm that
never ceased to lie

Become one with the word
Become one with the word
Become one with the word
Become one with the word

I keep dreaming of the one word
That can't be named
I keep dreaming of the one word
That cannot be named
I keep dreaming of the one word
That can't be named
I keep dreaming of the one word
That can't be named

I keep dreaming of the one word
That cannot be named
I keep dreaming of the one word
That can't be named
I keep dreaming of the one word
That cannot be named
I keep dreaming of the one word
That can't be named
