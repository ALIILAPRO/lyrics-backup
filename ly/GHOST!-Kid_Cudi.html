		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, whoa, whoa, mmh, oh
Yeah, whoa, whoa
Haha
Yeah
My name is Scott Mescudi, yeah
Mmmh
Yeah

Gotta get it through my thick head
I was so close to bein' dead, yeah
Life, live it with nobody's help tips
Man, I'm just walkin' without bein' led
See the world is so crazy and filled with such risk and, man
I just know I gotta dodge them, yeah
The beginnings are followed by an end
In the in-between time I'm not runnin' or hidin'

See things do come around
And make sense eventually
Things do come around
But some things trouble me

The people I met and the places I've been
Are all what make me the man I so proudly am
But I wanna know one thing
When did I become a ghost?
I'm mostly confused about the world I live in
They think that I'm lonely, well, I probably am
One thing that still gets me
When did I become a ghost? Yeah

Na-na-na na-na-na-na, oh, whoa-whoa, ha, ha
Yeah, yeah, whoa-whoa-whoa, yo

Tried to fight it
But soon that gave in
Went down a road with no lights on, mh
Can't describe it, and you don't move like them
You become their worst nightmare
You remember the things that your parents had said, and, well
Rather find out the hard way
You should tell a friend to tell a friend to tell a friend
I keep with my stroll, I'm not runnin' or hidin'

See things do come around
And make sense eventually
Things do come around
But some things still trouble me

The people I met and the places I've been
Are all what make me the man I so proudly am
But I wanna know one thing
When did I become a ghost?
I'm mostly confused about the world I live in
They think that I'm lonely, well, I probably am
One thing that still gets me
When did I become a ghost? Yeah

Na-na-na na-na-na-na, oh, whoa-whoa, mmh-yeah
Yeah, whoa-whoa

Mmm (ah-ooh), ohh (ah-ooh)
I hope they understand that I really understand that 
They don't understand (ah-ooh)
I hope they understand that I really understand that 
They don't understand (ah-ooh)
I really understand that they
I really think I, um (ah-ooh)
I hope they understand that I really understand that 
They don't understand, whoa
Listen to me
Whoa
Listen to me
Whoa
