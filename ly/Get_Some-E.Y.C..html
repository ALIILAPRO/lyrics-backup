		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Express, yourself, clearly
Come and get some
Come if you want to, want to get some
Come if you want to, want to get some
Come if you want to, want to get some
Come and, get some
Let me tell you, how it's gonna be, now
Express, yourself, clearly
Express yourself, get it off your chest
Why, 'cause that's the way I am
See this is what I mean
And this is how I'm coming
This is just straight up business now
As God can be my witness
Don't push me to the limits
Or I will have to get up in it
Come if you want to want to get some
Now it's time to have some fun
Everybody come
Come if you want to want to get some
Oh girl, you look so good
Come if you want to want to get some
All freaks in the neighborhood
Come if you want to want to get some
Get some
Come and get some
Get some
Come and get some
Come if you want to get some
Everybody come
So honey don't start to trim now
It's time to get nasty
Everybody come, come and get some
The drawers all wet now
I know it's time to take the chance
Stop me now girls if I can
We're not talking about bone now
Let's just do the dance
I let them know, I let them know
It's all about watching all those freaks after every show
Come and get some, everybody come, come and get some
Everybody come, who want to trip on the E.Y.C.
Come and get some, yeah you gotta get me
Gangsta Ridd ain't jokin' - Turn me up, turn me up
Come and get some
*
Come if you want to want to get some
Oh girl, you look so good
Come if you want to want to get some
All freaks in the neighborhood
Come if you want to want to get some
Get some
Everybody come
Get some
Everybody come
Come if you want to get some
Come and get some, everybody come
(Repeat with ad lib)
Come if you want to want to get some
(Repeat with ad lib)
Come now, all freaks come now (Repeat)
(* Repeat with ad lib)
