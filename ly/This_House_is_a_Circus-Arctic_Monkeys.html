		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This house is a circus, berserk as fuck
We tend to see that as a perk, though look 
What it's done to your friends
Their memories are pretend
And the last thing that they want is for the feeling to end
This house is a circus, berserk as fuck
We tend to see that as a perk, though look
What it's done to your friends
Their memories are pretend
And the last thing that they want is for the feeling to end

There's a room full of trouble and there's lovers to be had
Those ones who make sinners out of such lovely lads
Scaling the corridors for maidens in the maze
And any anomaly is slipping into familiar ways
And we're forever unfulfilled and can't think why
Like a search for murder clues in dead man's eyes
Forever unfulfilled and can't think why
Like a search for murder clues in dead man's eyes

The more you open your mouth, the more you're forcing performance
And all the attention is leading me to feel important
(Gimme obnoxious, gimme obnoxious now)
Now that we're here, we may as well go too far

Wriggling around in incidents you won't forget
There's certainly some venom in the looks that you collect
Aimlessly gazing at the faces in the queue
And we're struggling with the notion that it's life, not film

This house is a circus, berserk as fuck (we're forever unfulfilled)
We tend to see that as a perk, though look (can't think why)
what it's done to your friends
Their memories are pretend (like a search for murder clues)
And the last thing that they want is for the feeling to end
