		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What's up? What's up? What's up?
What's up? What's up? What's up?
What's up? What's up? What's up?

Dumb like a lamb
Lead us to to slaughter
We don't make the plans
Die on the altar
The pain is dull
The brain is the dim
What do you want?
Pay for your sins?

Grab the blade, pierce the skin
We won't fight the bloodletting
We don't bite the hand that feeds
Cause it hasn't been feeding

What's up? What's up? What's up?
What's up? What's up? What's up?
What's up? What's up? What's up?

Please don't take it from me
Gentrification of me
The total erasure of me
Ha, ha
I don't let go easily
Naw, they tryna take it from me
It's the last piece of me
Nah, they ain't gonna take it from me
Ha, ha
They ain't gonna take it from me
Why the fuck you say you need me?
Ha, ha
So you can just go delete me?
Uhg

You can tell em, tell em, tell em
You can tell em, tell em, tell em
You can tell em how you're feeling
But that don't matter matter much
There's shit they ain't telling yuh
And what you say, they ain't believing
Got some shit up their shirt sleeve, and
How dare you have doubt?
How dare you question me?
How dare you speak up?
How dare you even think?
Uhg

Grab the blade, pierce the skin
We won't fight the bloodletting
We don't bite the hand that feeds
Cause it hasn't been feeding

What's up? What's up? What's up?
What's up? What's up? What's up?
What's up? What's up? What's up?
What's up?

Please don't take it from me
Gentrification of me
The total erasure of me
Ha, ha
I don't let go easily
Naw, they tryna take it from me
It's the last piece of me
Nah, they ain't gonna take it from me
Ha, ha
They ain't gonna take it from me
Why the fuck you say you need me?
Ha, ha
So you can just go delete me?
Uhg
