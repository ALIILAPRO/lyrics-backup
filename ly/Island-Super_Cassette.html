		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Where I'm coming from
And where I'm going to are one
Both the island and
The continent will spend their time beneath the sun

When I wanna see
What is good in me I hum
Out a melody, ringing presently out
From the past, now sounds as one

A man's not a point in a time but a line through his life
And the days added up to much more than a sum
A whole, a soul, I know, I know

Who I wanna be and
Who I hated once are one
My impermanence
Gives precedence that all my woes
Will come undone

A man's not a point in a time but a line through his life
And the days added up to much more than a sum
A whole, a soul, I know, I know

Who is judging you and
Who you're beholden to are none
When you ached because
The stakes would tower over you, blot out the sun

You closed both your eyes to the light of your life
And the beat of your heart rung out deaf, dumb, and dark to a
Cold, black hole, where envy took control

A man's not a point in a time but a line through his life
(A man's not a point in time)
And the days added up to much more than a sum
(Continue the line)
A whole, a soul, I know, I know
