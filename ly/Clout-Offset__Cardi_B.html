		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Diamonds on fleek
Bitch, I ain't talking about the heat, oh
Put it on, streets
We straight out the streets
We straight out the streets
Straight out the streets to a penthouse

Straight out the streets to a penthouse, Miami beach (Yayo)
Niggas talk crazy on tweets (Who)
They don't want it 'cause I come to defeat (They don't wanna)
I peep, these niggas all sweet (Weak)
Bamboo sticks all in the Jeep (Brr, brr)
It's a new weirdo every week (Weirdo)
Get the whip, put it up for my seats (Put it up)
No cure for the IG disease (No cure)

Do anything for clout (Anything)
They do anything for clout (Anything)
Do anything for clout (Anything)
They do anything for clout (Clout)
Do anything for clout (Clout, do this, woo woo)
They do anything for clout (Anything)
Do anything for clout (Hey)

Bitch, watch your mouth (Watch it)
Bitch, stay in your place (Place)
Bitch, get out the way (Move)
My bitch on your ass, Kim K (Yeah)
No disrespect (Nah)
The nigga be tripping, but we love Ye (He tripping)
Swapping our cars with my bitch
I bought her the Lambo she bought me the Wraith (Swappin')
Practice, practice, practice make perfect
Nigga, it's never too late (Never, never, never)
I took the ssss outta the snake (I took the soul out the snake)
Did not see the bills up out of the bank (Racks)
The blog and the media fake (They fake)
Shorty DM me, I'm straight (I'm straight)
I'm not gon' bite on the bait (Nah)
Sippin' on toxic waste (Look)
On the low with your bitch and it's great (On the low)
Mask on her face, Jason
Run to the set, we in shape (Show)
If I go broke she gone leave, escape (She gone)
I put 2 mill in the safe just in case, don't go my way (no cap)
My kids gotta have money not just me (Facts)
That's selfish (It's selfish)
Oh, I took the crown off the king like Mike did Elvis (Oh, I took it)
Ooh, the world is wild, he dying
Don't lie, that don't help him (World is wild)
Ooh, your bitch want to eat up the drip, and you can not help it

Straight out the streets to a penthouse, Miami beach (Yayo)
Niggas talk crazy on tweets (Who)
They don't want it 'cause I come to defeat (They don't wanna)
I peep, these niggas all sweet (Weak)
Bamboo sticks all in the Jeep (Brr, brr)
There's a new weirdo every week (Weirdo)
Get the whip, put it up for my seats (Put it up)
No cure for the IG disease (No cure)

Do anything for clout (Anything)
They do anything for clout (Anything)
Do anything for clout (Anything)
They do anything for clout (Clout)
Do anything for clout (Clout, do this, woo woo)
They do anything for clout (Anything)
Do anything for clout (Hey)

Look, whole lotta people need to hear this (Facts)
It's a lotta names on my hit list (Bap bap)
Mouth still say what it wants to (Woo)
Pussy still wet like a big bitch (Facts, facts)
I should run a whole blog at this rate (Phew)
They using my name for clickbait (Clickbait)
Bitches even wanna start fake beef (Fake beef)
To sell their little weave in the mixtape
They know I'm the bomb, they ticking me off
Saying anything to get a response
I know that mean they traffic is low
Somebody just gotta practice to launch
So fuck being tame, I'd rather be wild
Bitches is Brandy, they wanna be down
Soon as these bitches got something to sell
They say my name, say my name, Destiny Child
Everybody wanna be lit, everybody wanna be rich
Everybody wanna be this, if I was you, I'd hate me bitch
Read my rhymes, nigga, suck my dick
All of that talk and I'm calling it out
Public opinions from private accounts
You not a check, then you gotta bounce
I got the drip, come get an ounce
They do anything for clout (Clout)
They do anything for clout (Whoo)
Bitches is mad, bitches is trash (Errr)
Oscar the Grouch (Grouch)
Seeing me win, they gotta hurt
Ooh, ooh, ouch
Said when they see me, what they gon' do?
Bitch, not from the couch, bah

Do anything for clout (Anything)
They do anything for clout (Anything)
Do anything for clout (Anything)
They do anything for clout (Clout)
Do anything for clout (Clout, do this, woo woo)
They do anything for clout (Anything)
Do anything for clout
