		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let's go!

One, two, three, four...steps I take from my bed to the floor

Five, six, seven, eight...will today be rough or will today be great?

Nine, ten, eleven, twelve...lately I've been going through hell

Thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen...today's the day, are you coming, are you with me?!


I'm sick of normal

I'm sick of being average

I'm sick of being mortal

I'm bout to be a savage

I see a lot of things that I want, I will have'em

I got a new mindset that I just established

I'll march through the cold with the nails on the pavement

I'll shovel that coal just to get out the basement

My story will be told helping others make changes

I'll be so bold they will watch in amazement



(2x)

cm I gonna face it?

cm I gonna chase it?

cm I gonna start or will I keep waiting?

Time is limited, quickly fading

Get my mind right it's my time to take it


G-G-G Get my mind right time time to take it (2x)

G-G get up let's go, get up let's go, get up let's go

1,2,3,4

1,2,3,4

1,2,3,4

Steps I take, I just gotta move forward



I will never settle

Got my foot up on the pedal

Pushing hard to the metal 

Make a deal with the devil

Channel rage through my vessel

Into something that is special

Energy of a rebel

Going up, up a level

I just wanna be greatness

I can feel changes

Turn a new page and

Tie up my laces

I will be the bravest

Break out of my cages

I will not be nameless

I will not be aimless



(2x)

cm I gonna face it?

cm I gonna chase it?

cm I gonna start or will I keep waiting?

Time is limited, quickly fading

Get my mind right it's my time to take it


G-G-G Get my mind right time time to take it (2x)

G-G get up let's go, get up let's go, get up let's go

1,2,3,4

1,2,3,4

1,2,3,4

Steps I take, I just gotta move forward
