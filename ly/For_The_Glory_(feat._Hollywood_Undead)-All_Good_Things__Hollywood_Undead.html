		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Better back down, you're in my domain
Got the whole crowd screaming out our name
It's a blowout, it's a hurricane
It's over before you know it
Why you shaking, we're a dynasty
In the making, we're the royalty
Now we're breaking down the enemy
Move over for the soldiers

Take a swing, I can take a hit
If we die, it's fine, we live for this
It's all for this

We're gonna stand on top with our hands in the sky
Gonna raise our cup to the stadium lights
For the glory (for the glory)
For the glory (for the glory)
We celebrate with the city tonight
Hear the hometown cheer, it's the ultimate high
For the glory (for the glory)
We do it for the glory (for the glory)

Yeah, we've waited, for our time to come
Calculated everything we've done
We've upgraded, now you can't outrun a champion
(Now you're facing one)
Can you hear them? Yeah, it's all for us
You believe them, yeah, it's serious
Hear the siren, we're victorious
I'm telling ya, can I get a hell yeah? (Hell yeah)

Take a swing, I can take a hit
If we die, it's fine, we live for this
It's all for this

We're gonna stand on top with our hands in the sky
Gonna raise our cup to the stadium lights
For the glory (for the glory)
For the glory (for the glory)
We celebrate with the city tonight
Hear the hometown cheer, it's ultimate high
For the glory (for the glory)
We do it for the glory (for the glory)

You're the tracer, I'm the eraser 
I'll ruin your record, I'm back here to break ya
I cut like a razor, so call the trophy engraver
I'm gonna get it, wait 'til I win it, God I'm so glad to be in it
Can't wait to say that we did it, this is my life and I live it
Ready to give it my all when you
Fall back, taking advantage of all that
Game is on average, you're so bad
Playing shorthanded, your team scratched
Time to assess all the damages 
I know that you couldn't handle this
It takes a man to stand up to the king
And unfortunately you're in bandages

We're gonna stand on top with our hands in the sky
Gonna raise our cup to the stadium lights
For the glory (for the glory)
For the glory (for the glory)
We celebrate with the city tonight
Hear the hometown cheer, it's the ultimate high
For the glory (for the glory)
We do it for the glory (for the glory)

This is why we do it (whoa, whoa) 
This is what we live for (whoa)
We're on top (for the glory)
We never run (for the glory)
Hands to the sky
Never back down (whoa, whoa) 
Never back down (whoa) 
You're gonna know my name (for the glory)
You're gonna know my name (for the glory)
