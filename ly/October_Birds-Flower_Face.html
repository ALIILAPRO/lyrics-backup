		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Where’d the October birds go?
I used to watch them from the window
When I had eyes to see, when
I was more like me
Where did your rosy face go?
When did your cheeks get so hollow?
Is it just a reflection of me?
Did i hurt you so badly
I want to be good but the moment I see
That runaway bride on the train headed east
I want to be like her
I want to be free
She lifts her dress and she runs into the street
But I’ve never seen a staircase without dreaming of falling
I’m the flinch in your cheek, I’m the shake in your hands and
I’ve laid here before, and
I’ll lay here again
I haven’t seen war but
I’ve tasted the sand
I’ve died five hundred times with your flag in my hand
I’ve never seen a river without dreaming of jumping
Call me lucky and spoiled,
I’m selfish and awful
I wake and i want more,
I go to sleep needing you over and over
I take what you give me
No man is an island,
I’m the girl on your shoreline washed up and heaving
Pathetically breathing
I cling to your sleeves and
I stop you from leaving October birds
Singing and wedding bells ringing tied to the altar
I ’ll keep you forever
Don’t let me down easy, you’re in me too deeply
