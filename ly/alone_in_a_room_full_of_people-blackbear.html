		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm alone
In a room full of people
On a street full of broken homes
And we only hurt each other
And I'm alone
In a room full of clones
Thought you all were my friends
But we only hurt each other in the end

Hurting each other since 2018
You got me anxious again, so I'm stuck in my sheets
You had me so high, now I'm on 1%
You plugged me in and tucked me in, you showed me how to pretend
I hope you're happy, even though you don't look it with him
Had to archive every photo like it didn't exist
Now every summer I just think about the times that I miss
Not to mention all the friends that I lost ever since

And I'm alone
In a room full of people
On a street full of broken homes
And we only hurt each other
And I'm alone
In a room full of clones
Thought you all were my friends
But we only hurt each other in the end

Yeah (yeah)
A hundred missed calls and I don't wanna pick up
'Cause when you say you'll hit me back, you hit me back in a month
And I don't wanna leave the crib and I don't want get lunch
'Cause everything I love doing, it just lost all its fun
And you made me feel disgusting 'bout the things that I've done
Gave me a hundred chances, I fucked up every one
Reminiscing 'bout a past that I could never outrun
I've been looking 'round this room and I don't fuck with anyone

'Cause I'm alone
In a room full of people
On a street full of broken homes
And we only hurt each other
And I'm alone
In a room full of clones
Thought you all were my friends
But we only hurt each other in the end

And we only hurt each other in the end
And we only hurt each other in the end
