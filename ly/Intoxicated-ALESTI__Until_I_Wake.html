		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Been lost in this misery
It feels like something crawls beneath my skin
I'm stuck on the periphery
Can't catch my breath and my head is spinning
I breathe you in
You're just like a chemical
Lost my sense of gravity
I surrender my control
My control
Lift me up, lift me up when I am caving in
Make me feel, make me feel like I'm worth saving
Fill me up, fill me up on what I'm craving
This drug I'm on when I'm with you
Is so intoxicating
Everything looked so far away
Been looking for a purpose deep inside
Kept thinking I would be okay
But only found out
where my demons hide
I breathe you in
You're just like a chemical
Lost my sense of gravity
I surrender my control
Lift me up, lift me up when I am caving in
Make me feel, make me feel like I'm worth saving
Fill me up, fill me up on what I'm craving
Let me see, let me see the hope of escaping
The drug I'm on when I'm with you
Is so intoxicating
So Intoxicating
So Intoxicating
My blood is boiling
It feels like I'm weightless
It's running through my veins
How to resist this
I can't go lower
So push on 'till I drop
This is the high of my life
Don't ever make it stop
Lift me up
Lift me up, lift me up when I am caving in
Make me feel, make me feel like I'm worth saving
Fill me up, fill me up on what I'm craving
Let me see, let me see the hope of escaping
Lift me up, lift me up when I am caving in
Make me feel, make me feel like I'm worth saving
Fill me up, fill me up on what I'm craving
This drug I'm on when I'm with you
Is so intoxicating
