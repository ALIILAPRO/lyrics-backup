		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wait until it fades to black
Ride into the sunset
Would I lie to you?
Well, I've got something to say
Grab your six-guns from your back
Throttle the ignition
Would I die for you?
Well here's your answer in spades

Shotgun sinners
Wild eyed jokers
Got you in my sights
Gun it while I'm holding on

After all is said and done
Climb out from the pine box
Well I'm asking you
'Cause she's got nothing to say
The angels just cut out her tongue
Call her black Mariah
Would I lie to you?
That girl's not right in the brain

Mass convulsions
Strike the choir
By the grace of God
Gun it while I'm holding on

But don't stop if I fall
And don't look back
Oh baby don't stop
Bury me and fade to black

She won't stop me put it down
She won't stop me put it down
She won't stop me put it down
So get your gun and meet me by the door

She won't stop me put it down
She won't stop me put it down
She won't stop me put it down
So get your gun and meet me by the door

She won't stop me put it down
She won't stop me put it down
She won't stop me put it down
So get your gun and meet me by the door

She won't stop me put it down
She won't stop me put it down
She won't stop me put it down
So baby

Don't stop if I fall
And don't look back
Oh baby don't stop
Bury me and fade to black

Don't stop if I fall
And don't look back
Oh baby don't stop
Bury me and fade to black

Well don't stop
