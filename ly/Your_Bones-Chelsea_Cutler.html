		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Stars had to align and come together
All at once, I'd never be the same
Who knew life could change like this forever
The very second that you said my name?

Suddenly, I'm somebody I don't recognize
But I am so happy to be her
Suddenly, you're the only thing that's on my mind
But I am diving even deeper, deeper 'cause

I love you down to your bones
Naked and afraid, they tell me that's when you know
I feel you taking me home
Dusk until the dawn, you're where I wanna go

Compromise is something that I'm learning
Forever never made much sense to me
But the way you look at me like I deserve it
Is changing who I thought that I could be

Now, suddenly, I'm somebody I don't recognize
But I am so happy to be her
Suddenly, you're the only thing that's on my mind
But I am diving even deeper, deeper 'cause

I love you down to your bones
Naked and afraid, they tell me that's when you know
I feel you taking me home
Dusk until the dawn, you're where I wanna go

Ooh-ooh-ooh, you're where I wanna go
Ooh-ooh-ooh, you're where I wanna go
Ooh-ooh-ooh, you're where I wanna go
Ooh-ooh-ooh, you're where I wanna go
