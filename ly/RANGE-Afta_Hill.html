		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby I’m on five I’m about to pull up
Pull up in that range rover
Keep going until we’re pulled over
Thelma and Louise going over

Tie your headband up
You’re looking gorgeous, you’re looking flawless baby
Tie your headband up
You’re looking flawless, you’re looking

Hollywood honey, with the red bottoms to match
high atop the hills but you underneath your past
She don’t know how to act when she taking off her mask
But i don’t see her demons when I hit it from back

Baby I’m on five I’m about to pull up
Pull up in that range rover
Keep going until we’re pulled over
Thelma and Louise going over
Baby I’m on five I’m about to pull up
Pull up in that range rover
Keep going until we’re pulled over
Thelma and Louise going over
Inshallah make a milli for I’m 25
I left a wifey-type beat just to chase the lights
We all alone, with these views up on Mullholand drive 
I say you make the view complete and then you roll your eyes
I come from the 6 side, I don’t really fit right
Decade in the making, no mistaken I’mma get mine
I come from the 6 side, I don’t really fit right
Baby get your fit right

Baby I’m on five I’m about to pull up
Pull up in that range rover
Keep going until we’re pulled over
Thelma and Louise going over
Baby I’m on five I’m about to pull up
Pull up in that range rover
Keep going until we’re pulled over
Thelma and Louise going over

Tie your headband up
You’re looking gorgeous, you’re looking flawless baby
Tie your headband up
You’re looking flawless, you’re looking
