		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Push me up against the wall
Pull my strings and watch me fall
Did it in a subtle matter
But you are the puppetmaster
Told me that I had potential
But I wasn't quite special
Inside this shell
Can't eat, can't sleep
I'm in too deep
I've been reshaped
And I can't escape
You scream and yell
I cried "I'm unwell"
You tied my hands
And made me dance
You pushed me to the ground
Wooden legs were tied and bound
Overworked and underpaid
Betrayed for a decade
Watching all the people gather
Just to see the puppetmaster
Inside this cell
Can't eat, can't sleep
I'm in too deep
I've been reshaped
And I can't escape
You scream and yell
I cried "I'm unwell"
You tied my hands
And made me dance
I'm on my knees
Stuck in this trapeze
Your poker-face
Makes it all fall into place
And I can't escape
You scream and yell
I cried "I'm unwell"
You tied my hands
And made me dance
I'm on my knees
Stuck in this trapeze
Your poker-face
Makes it all fall into place
Push me up against the wall
Pull my strings and watch me fall
Did it in a subtle matter
'Cause you are the puppetmaster
