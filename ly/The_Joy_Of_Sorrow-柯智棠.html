		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We're all living, we're all dying 
We're all simple but complicated 
We're hiding, yet craving to be found 
We're all hurting, we're all wounded 
We're all awake but unaware 
Learning the joy of sorrow 

We're all pure, we're all blended 
We're all envious but content 
We're suffered, yet somehow entertained 
We're all generous, we're all selfish 
We cross our hearts 
Hoping to die with the joy of sorrow 

We all learn more from pain 
We all smile while tears sneak in 
We all grin even when the world turns its back on us 
We're like a pure flame, living by an invisible sun within us 

We're all lost, we're all determined 
We're all traitors but not haters 
We're silent, yet not completely mute 
We're all flawed, we're all perfect 
We're all patiently impatient 
Waiting for the joy of sorrow 

We all learn more from pain 
We all smile while tears sneak in 
We all grin even though the world turns its back on us 
We're like a pure flame, living by an invisible sun within us 

We're all proud, we're all humble 
We're eloquent but incoherent 
We're happy, yet oddly find it unbearable 
We're all young, we're all mature 
We're all blessed but often doomed 
Yearning to grasp the joy of sorrow
