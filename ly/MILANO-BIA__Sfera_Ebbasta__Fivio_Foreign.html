		  Give you good look, but it don't know what to do with it (Aziz)
Buongiorno
Hey, papà, hey
Hey, papà, hey
Hey, papà, hey (I wanna go to Milan)
Hey, papà, hey (go to Milan)

I wanna go shop in Milano, take all my paesanos (hey)
Drive in a Ferrari, it's just a couple dollars (cash)
You know that's my motto, I'll see you tomorrow (hey)
I came with my family, it's a mafia
I wanna go shop in Milano, take me to the opera (hey)
Margherita pizza, you know I like pasta (hey)
I want your attention, fumo marijuana (hey)
Everybody eats here (Money Gang), everybody mangia

Sai che Italia è uguale a pasta (Ah, oh), Prada e Sfera Ebbasta (oh)
Metti 100K (cash) sopra la bilancia
Vogliono farmi la pelle (grr), piccoli piranha
Piangeva mia mamma, ero più in strada che a casa
Sul mio display (brr), la tua bitch fa lo strip per le tips, ayy (mwah)
Niente kiss, la sua pussy è una cheesecake
Vuole il bis, tu vuoi il beef, non so chi sei
Ti sei fatto il film, hey

I wanna go shop in Milano, take all my paesanos (hey)
Drive in a Ferrari, it's just a couple dollars (cash)
You know that's my motto, I'll see you tomorrow (hey)
I came with my family, it's a mafia
I wanna go shop in Milano, take me to the opera (hey)
Margherita pizza, you know I like pasta (hey)
I want your attention, fumo marijuana (hey)
Everybody eats here, everybody mangia

Uh, rrah
Hey, papà, I gotta stay in my bag (rrah)
How could I finish in last?
I made these bitches come out of Bottega with tags
Uh, I can't go out sad (skrrt)
Whether the Lamb' or the 'Rari, I'm keepin' my foot on the gas (skrrt)
And I keep a deal on my neck too (uh)
I'm who they dyin' to get next to (uh)
I'm at the Vatican, bless you
Matter fact, I'm on shenanigans
I'm with my killy and he brought the scammers in (huh)
Uh (yeah)
I got a hot one on me and it's melting my hand again (baow, uh, huh)
We see him hot and he turned to a mannequin

Uh, huh (huh)
I pray to God we run into that man again (yeah)
They see my face and start panickin'
Only get happy, they tell me they damaged him
Don't make me put them shooters in that van again
I don't need nobody, I see 'em, I handle 'em (baow)
I don't even sweat, but I'm hot as ever (Uh)
I like my Prada, Italian leather
All my linen exotic for fire weather
And nigga, you probably wear polyester (huh, huh)
Throwin' up signs, talkin' with my hands
Them niggas rattin', talkin' on the stand
How I'm supposed to focus on my fans when niggas keep tough talkin' on the 'Gram?
I'm on the island, focused on a tan
My bitches bad, focused on a glam
Nigga a opp (nigga a opp)
Boy, you'll die walkin' with that man (baow, baow)

I wanna go shop in Milano, take all my paesanos (hey)
Drive in a Ferrari, it's just a couple dollars (cash)
You know that's my motto, I'll see you tomorrow (hey)
I came with my family, it's a mafia
I wanna go shop in Milano, take me to the opera (hey)
Margherita pizza, you know I like pasta (hey)
I want your attention, fumo marijuana (hey)
Everybody eats here, everybody mangia (Uh)
