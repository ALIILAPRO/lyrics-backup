		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Oh baby)

I know what you did
Yeah, I know, I know
And I wanna talk 'bout it
And I know you don't
I been holding guard for so long, so long
And I don't know where to start, I don't know where to start
Tell me where you hide, where do you go?
Tell me is she nice, does she know I know?
Tell me why you lie, tell me why
I don't know what you are, I don't know what you are, no

What you did, uh
Yeah, you know I love you but I can't forgive it
You could tell me stay, but I have to go
'Cause I would not expect someone to stay around
If I let them down, oh

Oh, it's funny how
Right when I let my guard down
You play around
And no, not this time, we can't hash it out
It's too late for me to stay
I wish all the things you say was what your behavior displayed
But, no, I could've done without lies, lies
And although I know love is blind, blind
This just don't feel right
Ain't no more we, ain't no more you with me

What you did (what you did)
Yeah, you know I love you but I can't forgive it (I can't forgive)
You could tell me stay, but I have to go (I gotta go)
'Cause I would not expect someone to stay around
If I let them down, oh
What you did (what you did)
Yeah, you know I love you but I can't forgive it (you know I love you, boy)
You could tell me stay, but I have to go (stay)
'Cause I would not expect someone to stay around
If I let them down, oh

Oh, you've become the reason I'm so down (down, down)
Oh, I won't excuse you, I don't wanna go down, yeah (down, down)
Do you know that you've been the reason I'm so low? (So low)
So you told me to stay here, but you know that I won't
'Cause I still can't believe

What you did, no
Yeah, you know I love you but I can't forgive it
You could tell me stay, but I have to go
'Cause I would not expect someone to stay around
If I let them down, oh
What you did (what you do, what you do)
Yeah, you know I love you but I can't forgive it (can't forgive, can't, can't forgive)
You could tell me stay, but I have to go (have to go)
'Cause I would not expect someone to stay around
If I let them down, oh

Wow (don't apologize, please)
I would never, I would never do it, baby (after all, you've had your fun)
(Don't try change my mind, please)
Don't try change my mind
(Baby, me and you are done)
Me and you are done
(Boy, oh boy)
(Boy, oh boy)
