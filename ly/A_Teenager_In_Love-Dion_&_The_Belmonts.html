		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh, wa-ooh
Ooh, wa-ooh

Each time we have a quarrel, it almost breaks my heart
'Cause I'm so afraid that we will have to part
Each night I ask the stars up above
Why must I be a teenager in love?

One day I feel so happy, next day I feel so sad
I guess I'll learn to take the good with the bad
'Cause each night I ask the stars up above
Why must I be a teenager in love?

I cried a tear for nobody but you
I'll be a lonely one, if you should say we're through
Well, if you want to make me cry, that won't be so hard to do
And if you should say goodbye, I'll still go on loving you

Each night I ask the stars up above
Why must I be a teenager in love?

I cried a tear for nobody but you
I'll be a lonely one, if you should say we're through
Well, if you want to make me cry, that won't be so hard to do
And if you should say goodbye, I'll still go on loving you

Each night I ask the stars up above
Why must I be a teenager in love? (In love, wa-ooh)
Why must I be a teenager in love? (In love, wa-ooh)
Why must I be a teenager in love? (In love, wa-ooh)
Why must I be a teenager in love?
