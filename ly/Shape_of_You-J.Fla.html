		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take a breath, I pull myself together
Just another step until I reach the door
You'll never know the way it tears me up inside to see you...
I wish that I could tell you something to take it all away

Sometimes I wish I could save you,
And there's so many things that I want you to know
I won't give up 'til it's over
If it takes you forever, I want you to know...

When I hear your voice,
It's drowning in the whispers
It's just skin and bones,
There's nothing left to take
And no matter what I do,
I can't make you feel better
If only I could find the answer to help me understand...

Sometimes I wish I could save you,
And there's so many things that I want you to know
I won't give up 'til it's over
If it takes you forever, I want you to know...

If you fall, stumble down, I'll pick you up off the ground
If you lose faith in you, I'll give you strength to pull through
Tell me you won't give up,
'Cause I'll be waiting if you fall
You know I'll be there for you

If only I could find the answer to take it all away...

Sometimes I wish I could save you,
And there's so many things that I want you to know
I won't give up 'til it's over
If it takes you forever, I want you to know...

I wish I could save you...
I want you to know...
I wish I could save you...
