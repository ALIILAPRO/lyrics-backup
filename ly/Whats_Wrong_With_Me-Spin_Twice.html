		  I wander like I'm nobody[00:13.28]Hiding what is best in me[00:16.18]I just wanna get off this way[00:18.25]Which's slowly driving me to the shame[00:41.38]This is how I don't wanna feel[00:43.81]When my heart is breaking out[00:46.39]All those crazy things last nights[00:49.18]What's wrong with me?[00:51.16]My soul's lighter than the air[00:53.64]but never sure to come back[00:56.22]I can pretend that I'm fine[00:58.69]But I know you can see[01:00.71]That there's no home where I don't feel lost[01:04.74]It's better to be alone when you're just a ghost[01:10.62]There's no hope if we don't trust in love[01:14.69]Though it is really love that we need the most[01:20.63]I wander like I'm nobody[01:23.24]Hiding what is best in me[01:25.94]I just wanna get off this way[01:28.22]Which's slowly driving me to the shame[01:31.02]I still feel so bad when everything's alright[01:34.27]What's wrong with me?[01:35.98]You're a blessing and I'm standing in the dark[01:39.46]What is wrong with me?[01:44.77]You said "we will go under the sun"[01:48.70]You wanna hear the sea's soft voices[01:51.47]With you everything seems fun[01:54.21]My smiles make it easy[01:56.33]Good friends good family[01:58.62]That save appearances[02:01.84]But pain is swallowing the light and spreading in my veins[02:05.80]What is[02:09.88]What is wrong[02:12.22]With me[02:15.07]There's no hope if we don't trust in love[02:19.74]Though it is really love that we need the most[02:25.21]I wander like I'm nobody[02:28.35]Hiding what is best in me[02:31.03]I just wanna get off this way[02:33.19]Which's slowly driving me to the shame[02:35.97]I still feel so bad when everything's alright[02:39.37]What's wrong with me?[02:41.38]You're a blessing and I'm standing in the dark[02:44.27]What is wrong with me?[03:15.25]I'm buried alive[03:17.48]And I still survive[03:19.86]But I can't breathe outside your arms[03:25.45]I'm buried alive[03:31.75]What's wrong[03:33.98]What's wrong with me
