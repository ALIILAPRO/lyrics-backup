		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Murder Inc.
(What's my motherfuckin' name?)
R-U-L-E
(Blowin' back on this Mary Jane, I'm analyzin' the game)
And the game done chose me
(To bring pain to pussy niggas and pussy hoes, it's one in the same)
Ever since you told me
(There's only room for two, I've been makin' less room for you)
Now only God can hold me
(Hug me, love me, judge me, the only Man that hovers above me, holla)

I met so many men and it's like they're all the same
My appetite for lovin' is now my hunger pain
And when I'm feelin' sexy, who's gonna come for me?
My only problem is their insecurity

(Are you tired of bein' alone?) Yeah, yeah
(Sick of arguin' on the phone?) Yeah, yeah
(While you're tellin' all your friends) Yeah, yeah
(That your nigga don't understand) My love

'Cause I'm real
(The way you walk, the way you move, the way you talk)
'Cause I'm real
(The way you stare, the way you look, your style, your hair)
'Cause I'm real
(The way you smile, the way you smell, it drives me wild)
'Cause I'm real
And I can't go on without you

Girl, I've been thinkin' 'bout this relationship
And I wanna know, is this as good as it gets?
'Cause we've been through the worst times and the best times
But it was our time, even if it was part-time
Now they been lookin' at me, smilin' at me, laughin' like we wasn't happy
But not knowin' that we're growin' and we're gettin' married
Hard lovin' and straight thuggin'
Bitch, I ain't doin this shit for nothin'
I'm here to get it poppin', hoppin', let's ride up in the Benz
Hair blowin' in the wind, sun glistenin' off my skin, hey
I'm nasty, ha, you know me
But you still gon' fuck with your baby

'Cause I'm real
(The way you walk, the way you move, the way you talk)
'Cause I'm real
(The way you stare, the way you look, your style, your hair)
'Cause I'm real
(The way you smile, the way you smell, it drives me wild)
'Cause I'm real
And I can't go on without you

Now people lovin' me and hatin' me, treatin' me ungratefully
But not knowin' that they ain't makin' or breakin' me
My life, I live it to the limit and I love it
Now I can breathe again, baby, now I can breathe again
Now people screamin', "What the deal with you and so and so?"
I tell them niggas, mind their biz, but they don't hear me though
'Cause I live my life to the limit and I love it
Now I can breathe again, baby, now I can breathe again

(Are you tired of bein' alone?) Yeah, yeah
(Sick of arguin' on the phone?) Yeah, yeah
(While you're tellin' all your friends) Yeah, yeah
(That your nigga don't understand) My love

'Cause I'm real
(The way you walk, the way you move, the way you talk)
'Cause I'm real
(The way you stare, the way you look, your style, your hair)
'Cause I'm real
(The way you smile, the way you smell, it drives me wild)
'Cause I'm real
And I can't go on without you

'Cause I'm real
(The way you walk, the way you move, the way you talk)
'Cause I'm real
(The way you stare, the way you look, your style, your hair)
'Cause I'm real
(The way you smile, the way you smell, it drives me wild)
'Cause I'm real
And I can't go on without you
