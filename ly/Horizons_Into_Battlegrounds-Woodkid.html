		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let the silence ease the wildness
Your embrace clears the storm in my head
Why do I love you more when I'm wasted?
I only welcome care when I'm wounded

You are a promise of brightness
The triumph of life over self-hate
But I take all you give for granted
What really matters, I keep breaking

I'm turning horizons into battlegrounds
I cannot walk ahead without your guidance
Can I hold on, can I hold on to you?
Can I hold on, can I hold on to you?

Can reliance ease the madness
When every voice says I'm worthless?
I thought I would find the force from fighting
But if I win alone, I'm losing

I'm turning horizons into battlegrounds
I cannot walk ahead without your guidance
I'm turning horizons into battlegrounds
And every step I take without a sound
Can I hold on, can I hold on to you?
Can I hold on, can I hold on to you?
Can I hold on, can I hold on to you?
Can I hold on, can I hold on to you?
