		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everybody's gotta live
And everybody's gonna die
Everybody just wanna have a good, good time
I think you know the reason why

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

Everybody's gotta live
And everybody's gonna die
Everybody gotta live
I think you know the reason why

Yeah, sometimes the goin' gets so good
Yeah, but then again, it get pretty rough
Yeah, when I have you in my arms, baby
You know I just can't, I just can't get enough

Everybody's gotta live
And everybody's gonna die
Everybody's gonna try to have a good, good time
I think you know the reason why

Saw a blind man standing on the corner, baby
Yeah, and he couldn't hardly tie his shoes
Yeah, harmonica and guitar strapped around his neck
But he sure could, he sure could play the blues

Everybody's gotta live
And everybody's gonna die
Everybody's gonna try to have a good, good time
I think you know the reason why

Yeah
Feel like I've seen a million sunsets, yeah
If you're with me, I'll never go away
Yeah, that's when I stopped and I took a look at my baby
She said, "If you're with me, I won't go away"

Because everybody's gotta live
And everybody's gonna die
Everybody's gonna try to have a good, good time
I think you know the reason why
