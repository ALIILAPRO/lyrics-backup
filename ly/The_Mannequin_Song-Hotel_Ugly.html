		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hate it when it's hard to say hello
Always seem to wait a bit too long
On display for all to see
Satisfaction guaranteed
Wish I could afford to buy your love

Tear up my life
I don't wanna pay to lose
I spend so much time
Tryna get away from you
Stuck in my mind
If only there were room for two
In love with your lies
I don't wanna know the truth

I would run away if you'd follow
Usually the truth is hard to swallow
Give it a chance I won't take you for granted
You're not one for second chances
Still I love the things you put me through

Hate it when it's hard to say hello
Always seem to wait a bit too long
On display for all to see
Satisfaction guaranteed
Wish I could afford to buy your love
