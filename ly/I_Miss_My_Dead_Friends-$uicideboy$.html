		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Got a, got a bunch of baggage)

Got a bunch of baggage
Got a bunch of bags up in the
Attic hidin' all my bad habit's
$lick? He got some bad habit's
Plus he's asthmatic
All the smoke that I be dragging, bitch
I need some casket for my fucking lungs
They fucking damaged like the Black Flag
Classic Sabbath? Never heard of that shit
Bitch, I work, it ain't for assets
Roll a solo blunt, no matching
It's because of all the gadgets why
I keep a social status
Fucking phones and tablets
Bitch, I do this shit just for Jefe
Yeah, he told me make it happen
Then he died in that tragic car crash
And every time I think of
That I'm flickin' ashes
Yeah, it sucks when you realize life is fast
And I'm a fucking cashless organism tryna
Thrive inside a habitat that's plastic

It's that motherfucker that ya momma
Said don't hang with
Meet me in the gallows, bitch
I promise that it's painless
Stupid motherfuckers thinking that we
On the same shit
Cock it back, and then I yell
"Okay, here comes the pain, bitch!"
Up in gangster's paradise
Could give a fuck about your life
Every time I roll the dice
Sixes popping up twice
Bitches tryna sacrifice their pussy
But I am not enticed good try, hoe
I do this shit for Dirt, so
I ain't got the time, hoe
Don't like nobody
And I think that's all you need to know
Walkin' on water while I'm
Surrounded by some crows
And when I hit the other side
I'm blowing on some dope, hoe
