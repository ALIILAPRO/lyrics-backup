		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Once I had a love and it was a gas
soon turned out had a heart of glass
seemed like the real thing only to find
much o mistrust love's gone behind
Once I had a love and it was divine
soon found out I was losing my mind
seemed like the real thing but I was so blind
much o mistrust love's gone behind

[Chorus]
In between what I find is pleasing and I'm feeling fine
love is so confusing there's peace of mind
if I fear I'm losing you it's just no good
you teasing like you do
Once I had a love it was a gas
soon turned out to be pain in the ass
seemed like the real thing but only to find
much o mistrust love's gone behind
Lost inside adorable illusion and I cannot hide
I'm the one you're using please don't push me aside
we could a make it cruising yeah

Riding high on love's true bluish light

[Chorus]
