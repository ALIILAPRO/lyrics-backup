		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So many times
You reached out to me
But I turned my back 'cause I didn't think you had what I need
And now you're everything
You're everything to me
And I can't be without your love, you're everything

And I wanna say thank you
I was lost and you found me
I was dead inside and you breathed into me
And you brought these bones to life
Yeah, I wanna say thank you
Thank you for saving me
Thank you for loving me unconditionally, oh

You still with open arms
But I ran out of faith
'Cause I was scared of the claim that came with trust, oh, oh
But I came running back
Into your embrace
Because I knew you'd still be there, you'd never leave me, love

And I wanna say thank you
I was lost and you found me
I was dead inside and you breathed into me
And you brought these bones to life
Yeah, I wanna say thank you
Thank you for saving me
Thank you for loving me unconditionally, oh

And I wanna say thank you
I was lost and you found me
I was dead inside and you breathed into me
And you brought these bones to life
Yeah, I wanna say thank you
Thank you for saving me
Thank you for loving me unconditionally, oh

(And I wanna say thank you)
(And I wanna say thank you)
(Yeah, I wanna say thank you)

Thank you for loving me unconditionally, oh
Yeah, I wanna say thank you
