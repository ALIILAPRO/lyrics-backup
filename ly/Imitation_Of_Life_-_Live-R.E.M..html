		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Charades pop skill
Water hyacinth
Name by a poet
Imitation of life

Like a koi in a frozen pond
Like a goldfish in a bowl
I don't want to hear you cry

That sugar cane that tasted good
That cinnamon, that's Hollywood
Come on, come on
No-one can see you try

You want the greatest thing
The greatest thing since bread came sliced
You've got it all
You've got it sized

Like a Friday fashion show
Teenager cruising in the corner
Trying to look like you don't try

That sugar cane that tasted good
That cinnamon, that's Hollywood
Come on, come on
No-one can see you try

No-one can see you cry

That sugar cane that tasted good
That' freezing rain, that's what you could
Come on, come on
No-one can see you cry

This sugar cane, this lemonade
This hurricane, I'm not afraid
Come on, come on
No-one can see me cry

This lightning storm, this tidal wave
This avalanche, I'm not afraid
Come on, come on
No-one can see me cry

That sugar cane that tasted good
That's who you are, that's what you could
Come on, come on
No-one can see you cry

That sugar cane that tasted good
That's who you are, that's what you could
Come on, come on
No-one can see you cry
