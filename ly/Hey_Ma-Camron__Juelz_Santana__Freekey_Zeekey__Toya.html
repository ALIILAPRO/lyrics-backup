Yeah, come on (hey, ladies)
Hey ma (wassup?)
Let's slide (all right)
All right, and we gon' get it on tonight
You smoke (I smoke)
I drink (me too)
Well, good, 'cause we gon' get high tonight
Got drops (got coupes) 
Got trucks (got jeeps)
All right, and we gon' take a ride tonight
So, ma (wassup?)
Let's slide (all right) 
All right, and we gon' get it on tonight

Yo, now I was downtown clubbin', ladies night
Seen shorty she was crazy right
And I approached baby like, "Ma, what's your age and type?"
She looked at me and said, "You's a baby right?"
I told her, I'm eighteen and live a crazy life
Plus I'll tell you what the eighties like
And I know what the ladies like
Need a man that's polite, listens, and takes advice
I could be all three, plus I can lay the pipe
Come wit' me, come stay the night
She looked at me laughin', like boy your game is tight
I'm laughin' back like sho' ya right, get in the car
And don't touch nothin', sit in the car
Let's discuss somethin'
Either we lovin' or I'll see you tomorrow
Now we speeding up the Westside
Hand creepin' up her left side, I'm ready to do it
Ready to bone, ready for dome
55th exit, damn, damn, already we home
Now let's get it on

Hey ma (wassup?)
Let's slide (all right)
All right, and we gon' get it on tonight
You smoke (I smoke)
I drink (me too)
Well, good, 'cause we gon' get high tonight
Got drops (got coupes) 
Got trucks (got jeeps)
All right, and we gon' take a ride tonight
So, ma (wassup?) (Yo)
Let's slide (all right) 
All right, and we gon' get it on tonight

Uh, now that I got a girl, my ex wanna holla and spit
Told me to acknowledge her quick
She like Cam, "Stop frontin' on that Dave Hollister tip" (how?)
Come over lets swallow and sip
I'm like, "Mama is sick, I promise you dick" 
Usually have a problem with chicks (why?)
They all say I'm rotten and rich
But not her, boobies real
High heel dooby feel, plus got them Gucci nails on
You a cutie still (still), and this my down girl too
Ain't no groupie deal
We left the movies with Uzis, Suzuki wheels
To the Jacuzzi, I tell you my boo be's real (she's real)
I mean she do be winnin', Louis spendin'
Go to the crib, she got the Gucci linen (linen)
I see Boo be grinnin' (you grinnin' huh?)
She looked and said, "Cam, I know that you be sinnin'"
Nah, I'm a changed man, look at the Range, ma'am
I got a whole new game plan
Looked and said, "that's nothing but game, Cam"
She was right, she was up in the Range, man (she know me)
Dropped her off at the L, now I'm flippin' the cell
That's right I had to call up L
Yo L (what up?) 
I hit (what else?)
Plus dome (say word?)
And we got it on tonight

Hey ma (wassup?)
Let's slide (all right)
All right, and we gon' get it on tonight
You smoke (I smoke)
I drink (me too)
Well, good, 'cause we gon' get high tonight
Got drops (got coupes) 
Got trucks (got jeeps)
All right, and we gon' take a ride tonight
So, ma (wassup?)
Let's slide (all right) 
All right, and we gon' get it on tonight
