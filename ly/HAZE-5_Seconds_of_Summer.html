		<p>
		  I put on the suit, I put on the tie
And if I'm with you, I'll never die
Beautiful moment in time that comes and floats away
And when I open my eyes, I hope to see your face

Got me feelin' alright when the feeling's all gone
Got me feelin' uptight every moment you're gone
Got a piece of your mind and I'm gonna hold on
It's a hell of a ride (lovin' you)
Got me feelin' alright when the feeling's all gone
Got me feelin' uptight every moment you're gone
Got a piece of your mind and I'm gonna hold on
It's a hell of a ride (lovin' you)

When I moved to California, when I lived with three lil' boys
When I didn't even know ya, when I was givin' up
Ventura was a ghost town, the city broke my heart, heart
I watched the weeks fly by, I'm by myself and you're not there
No matter how long, I still care
And when you pick me up, now I don't have to play pretend
And I am human once again

Got me feelin' alright when the feeling's all gone
Got me feelin' uptight every moment you're gone
Got a piece of your mind and I'm gonna hold on
It's a hell of a ride (lovin' you)
Got me feelin' alright when the feeling's all gone
Got me feelin' uptight every moment you're gone
Got a piece of your mind and I'm gonna hold on
It's a hell of a ride (lovin' you)

That was a moment in time that comes and floats away
And when I open my eyes, I hope to see your face

Got me feelin' alright when the feeling's all gone
Got me feelin' uptight every moment you're gone
Got a piece of your mind and I'm gonna hold on
It's a hell of a ride (lovin' you)
Got me feelin' alright when the feeling's all gone
Got me feelin' uptight every moment you're gone
Got a piece of your mind and I'm gonna hold on
It's a hell of a ride (lovin' you)
