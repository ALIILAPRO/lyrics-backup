Yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey (ayy, Mitch)

Bought some Wock, not to drink, just to keep in stock (slatt)
Got a stick way too big, I could kill a fox (grrt)
Hundred thousand dollars cash, spent it in a stock (that cash)
Sixty eights on my ass, two millies in my Glock (you see)
I can't cop no Aston Martin (no), that shit for the broke (no, no)
I got me a new Lamborghini (skrrt), it came with remotes (yes)
My bitch came from overseas, we fuck and she get choked (she fine)
Outside with the goons and robbers, all white like the pope (ooh, yeah)
For the forty-fifth time, I'm good everywhere (on God)
Big boy Ferrari, drop the top, it's red like February (skrrt)

Ten-carat earrings, a hundred grand, no kizzy (ya dig?)
This bitch geekin' off a school bus, she Miss Frizzie (yeah)
Her best friend took too much boot, she too dizzy (too dizz')
I'm about to put 'em both in a figure-four
Check a nigga out (yeah), I'm that nigga that get shit done (yeah)
Tweetin' on my phone in the bath like Rev Run (yeah, on God)
Concrete boy, that new test ride on Big Pun (my bank)
Got like five different APs, who want one? (Yeah, AP)
It's a fact (yes), I'ma always (yes) get it done (I do)
These niggas my sons and I'm 50 Cent (no love)
Ridin' 'round (yeah) in a Bentley (yeah) and it got me bent (yeah)
This bitch thirsty, she need more water, you folks are Flint (water)

Bought some Wock, not to drink, just to keep in stock
Got a stick way too big, I could kill a fox (grrt)
Hundred thousand dollars cash, spent it in a stock (that cash)
Sixty eights on my ass, two millies in my Glock (you see)
I can't cop no Aston Martin (no), that shit for the broke (no, no)
I got me a new Lamborghini (skrrt), it came with remotes (yes)
My bitch came from overseas, we fuck and she get choked (she fine)
Outside with the goons and robbers, all white like the pope (ooh, yeah)
For the forty-fifth time, I'm good everywhere (on God)
Big boy Ferrari, drop the top, it's red like February (skrrt)

I'm just tryna fuck her from the back with no issues
We already know you goin' broke (yes), keep your tissues
Too much fuckin' money (ooh) I've been making (yes), I won't diss you
Niggas plottin' on me, that's okay 'cause I tote pistols (yeah, brrt)
Niggas count me out, shit, that's okay 'cause I count money
Fuck bein' in yo' top five, my mama's countin' hundreds (on God, Lousy)
