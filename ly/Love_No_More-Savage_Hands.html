		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Deep in the dark can’t find myself
I got nowhere left to go
I try to seek the light in me but Its buried with my soul
I wanna know what it feels like
When no one knows your name
I wanna go, for just one night
Don’t wanna play this game

I don’t wanna love no more
I don’t wanna lie like this you know
I’ve been holding on too long again
been running up the walls afraid
I dont wanna know your voice
But The weight of the silence just leaves me low
I’ve been holding on too long again
And loss is all I ever win

Now my eyes they bleed
I’m too blind to see
That I’m running from a ghost
Now the hands that reach
Arent helping me
And this hole it feels like home
I wanna know what it feels like
When no one knows your name
Been losing hope and the time flies
Cause loss is all I ever win

I don’t wanna love no more
I don’t wanna lie like this you know
I’ve been holding on too long again
been running up the walls afraid
I dont wanna know your voice
But The weight of the silence just leaves me low
I’ve been holding on too long again
And loss is all I ever win
