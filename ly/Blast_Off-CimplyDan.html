		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Blast off blast off
Pop a bean then I blast off
Livin' life like I'm Ricky Ross
From the out lookin' in I'm a little lost
Blast off blast off
Pop a bean then I blast off
Livin' life like I'm Ricky Ross
From the out lookin' in I'm a little lost

But I got the sauce
I don't take a loss
Only catching dubs
Say she know the plug
Told her call him up
Then my phone rang
Shawty mouth drop
Told her what you need

Blast off blast off
Pop a bean then I blast off
Livin' life like I'm Ricky Ross
From the out lookin' in I'm a little lost
Blast off blast off
Pop a bean then I blast off
Livin' life like I'm Ricky Ross
From the out lookin' in I'm a little lost

Anything I want I just grab it
Taking the cards I'm not playing around
They blowing up my line gotta change it now
I'm not impressed
Shawty get dressed
Getting to the next check
Yes yes yes yes yes
I'm obsessed with being the best
I'm feeding the fam
Yeah yeah
One foot in the lam
Damn Dan
They creeping my gram
I know
Easing their feelings with snow
Paving a road of gold
They yelling that I'm cold
Nah b**** I'm bold b**** I'm bold
Took the chance when everyone against me against me against me
Took a dream & I made it so they all see all see all see
Now I'm the best
Yes
Apart from the rest
Yes
Living real blessed
Ain't going back
Demons say less what you know of that
Took control now they want it back
Diamonds in the holes to fill the gaps
I'm in the zone you can lick my s***
F*** a throwback now I throw stacks
You h** act & now I hoe smack
I told you once I ain't going back
& that's a fact that's a fact that's a fact

Blast off blast off
Pop a bean then I blast off
Livin' life like I'm Ricky Ross
From the out lookin' in I'm a little lost
Blast off blast off
Pop a bean then I blast off
Livin' life like I'm Ricky Ross
From the out lookin' in I'm a little lost
