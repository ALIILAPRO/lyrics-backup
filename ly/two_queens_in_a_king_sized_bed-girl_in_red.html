		  Two queens in a king-sized bed
There's no mistletoe above our heads
But I'll kiss you anyway on Christmas day
Yeah, I'll kiss you anyway on Christmas day

I don't have a lot to give
But I would give you everything
All my time is yours to spend
Let me wrap you in with my skin
With my skin

Oh

Two queens in a king-sized bed
Like angels in the snow
My only wish is one more year
And then I want them all
Your freckled cheeks, our tangled feet
The closer, the better it gets
So let's stay right here
Until forever disappears

I don't have a lot to give
But I would give you everything
All my time is yours to spend
Let me wrap you in with my skin
With my skin

Two queens in a king-sized bed
Mm, there's no mistletoe above our heads
But I'll kiss you anyway on Christmas day
Yeah, I'll kiss you anyway on Christmas day
