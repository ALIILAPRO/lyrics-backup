		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  He punched me in the mouth
And it felt like a gift
I bet you'll never know
How twisted that role is
Yeah, it's true what they say
Boys think with their dicks
No, this ain't something
That sorry can fix
You're fuckin' with a goddess
And the bitch bites back
I'd love it if you're honest
But it ain't like that
Boy, now you're the one who's godless, mhm

Am I scaring you yet?
Am I scaring you yet?
'Cause I might do you wrong
But it'll feel right
Let you play along
Act like a tough guy
I can be the jailer
And you can pay the crimes
Ooh, you do it all the time

He said my pretty face shouldn't look this way
He thinks that my body is his to take
He won't look me in the eyes
Afraid to see what's looking back
Oh, you'll regret doing the devil dirty like that
He believed that I could take a beating (ooh)
But the bruises down my back don't mean a damn thing (ooh)
Cause I brought the god of war to his knees
With the back of my hand wiped his blood from my cheek

Now you're pointing fingers into mirrors (aye aye)
Crying thinking somebody will hear ya (yeah yeah)
But this bitch is your queen
I can promise you one thing
You won't like me when I'm mean
Mean, mean
You won't like me when I'm mean

You're fuckin' with a goddess
And the bitch bites back
I'd love it if you're honest
But it ain't like that
Boy, now you're the one who's godless, mhm

Am I scaring you yet?
Am I scaring you yet?
'Cause I might do you wrong
But it'll feel right
Let you play along
Act like a tough guy
I can be the jailer
And you can pay the crimes
Ooh, you do it all the time

There's a ribbon 'round my neck and it's red, it's red
Sweeter than the liquid that I bled, I bled
Heaven ain't a place you forget, forget
When there's hell to pay
You'll be screaming our names
Goddess, goddess
Baby boy is fuckin' with a goddess (aye aye)
Goddess, goddess
Baby boy is motherfucking godless
Fuckin' with a goddess (goddess)
And the bitch bites back
I'd love it if you're honest (honest)
But it ain't like that
Boy now you're the one who's godless, mhm (you're the one who's godless)

Am I scaring you yet?
Am I scaring you yet?
'Cause I might do you wrong
But it'll feel right
Let you play along
Act like a tough guy (so tough)
I can be the jailer
And you can pay the crimes, ooh
I do it all the time
I do it all the time
I do it all the time

Prayed, you're gonna wish you prayed
Gonna wish you prayed, prayed
