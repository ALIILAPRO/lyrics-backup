		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've got a lump in my throat about the note you wrote
I'd come on over but I haven't got a raincoat

Have we got contact
You and me?
Have we got touchdown
Can't we be?

I've got contacts in my book and in my eyes
My good connection on the telephone never lies

Have we got contact
You and me?
Have we got touchdown
Can't we be?

I've got a list of the people I have known
I'm never alone on the end of a phone

Have we got contact
You and me?
Have we got touchdown
Can't we be?

I've got a lump in my throat about the note you wrote
I'd come on over but I haven't got a raincoat
I'd come on over but I haven't got a raincoat

Have we got touchdown
Can't we be?
Have we got contact
You and me?
Have we got touchdown
Can't we be?
Have we got contact
You and me?
Have we got touchdown
Can't we be?
