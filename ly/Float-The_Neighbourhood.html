		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Imagine breathing in
Imagine leaving all your air behind
What matters in the end
A matter of opinion 'til you find out

Life can only mean hardly anything
All I'll ever be is partly settled in

To show you how to swim, then they throw you in the deep end
I've been learning since, but it doesn't mean I'll float, oh no
I won't float, no, no, no, no, won't float

I had a funny sleep,
I didn't have a dream
'Cause I don't believe in them

Life can only mean hardly anything
All I'll ever be is partly settled in

To show you how to swim, then they throw you in the deep end
Well I've been learning since, but it doesn't mean I'll float oh no no no
I won't float, no, no, no, no, oh

Float away, float away, then come right back to me
Float away, float away, then come right back to me

To show you how to swim, then they throw you in the deep end
Well I've been learning since, but it doesn't mean I'll float
To show you how to swim, then they throw you in the deep end
Well I've been learning since, but it doesn't mean I'll float no oh no
I won't float

What if I, what if I don't float?
What if I don't float?
I think I'll float, I'll float
I'll float away
