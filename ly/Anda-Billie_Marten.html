		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Colourful boxes against our grave
Take it in hand
We have traveled a long way
And I have not seen myself
In several days
And man it feels good to not think
The sea, the sand, the air
The salt in your hair
I'm not going anywhere
Anywhere
And we took a boat onto be mislead
In silence, we float as I
Look at the back of your head
Your head
Back to two lovers, on an unmade bed
Back to two lovers on an unmade bed
Oh, watch out for that sun
It's a powerful girl
I like it, I like it on you
I like it on me
I like loving the sea
I see you, you see me
