		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Raindrops running down my summer
And I feel so lonely
And I feel so lonely
And I feel so
Spaced out, running into no one
And I feel so lonely
And I feel so lonely
Lonely

All of my friends went home
Now that they're gone, I feel alone
So days end, run into tomorrow
And I feel so lonely
And I feel so lonely

(Lonely)
(Lonely)
(Lonely)
(Lonely)
(Lonely)

Raindrops running down my summer
And I feel so lonely
And I feel so lonely
And I feel so
Spaced out, running into no one
And I feel so lonely
And I feel so lonely
Lonely

All of my friends went home
And I feel so lonely
And I feel so lonely
Lonely
All of my friends went home
And I feel so lonely
And I feel so lonely

Raindrops running down my summer
And I feel so lonely
And I feel so lonely
And I feel so
Spaced out, running into no one
And I feel so lonely
And I feel so lonely

Raindrops running down my summer
And I feel so lonely
And I feel so lonely
And I feel so
Days end, run into tomorrow
And I feel so lonely
And I feel so lonely

All of my friends went home
Now that they're gone, I feel alone
And all of my friends went home too soon
And so did you
And so did you

Raindrops running down my summer
And I feel so lonely
And I feel so lonely
And I feel so
Spaced out, running into no one
And I feel so lonely
And I feel so

Raindrops running down my summer
And I feel so lonely
And I feel so lonely
And I feel so
Spaced out, running into no one
And I feel so lonely
And I feel so lonely
Lonely

All of my friends went home
And I feel so lonely
And I feel so lonely
Lonely
All of my friends went home
And I feel so lonely
And I feel so lonely
Lonely
