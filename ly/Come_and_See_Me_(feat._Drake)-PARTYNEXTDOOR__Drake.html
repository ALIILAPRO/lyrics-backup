		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Doesn't make sense now
Shit just got real, things are gettin' intense now
I hear you talkin' 'bout we a lot, oh, you speak French now?
Givin' me the signs so I gotta take a hint now
I hit you up like, "Do you wanna hang right now?"
On the East Side and you know I'm with the gang right now
You say do I own a watch, do I know what time it is right now
It's after 2AM and that's askin' a lot of you right now

All she talkin' bout is come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me
All she ever say is come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me

I been up for two whole days thinkin' what I did to keep you goin'
Thumbin' through the voicemails that you left me tellin' me where I went wrong
I'll admit I'm sorry when I feel I'm truly sorry
Things change, people change, feelings change too
Never thought the circumstances woulda changed you
You said you never traded, no (yeah, you said that)
And I believed you when they told me don't (yeah, thought you meant that)
But either way you're still invited and I can't even lie to you

Swear these days all you say is come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me
All she hit me with is come and see me for once
Come and see me for once, oh
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me

Why you gotta start, girl, why you gotta start?
I know we make time for the things that we want
I know you got another nigga tryna play the part
Just 'cause he got a heart don't mean he got heart
Could be standin' in a field, and he still ain't in the field
If anythin' should change then I thought we had a deal
Lately you keep questionin' what you get out the deal
Doin' things to make me feel the way I make you feel
How hard is it to let you know when I'm comin' home?
That way you could be prepared, maybe take a couple sick days and not miss pay
I don't even know what things are lookin' like inside of your place and how it's decorated
This thing is gettin' one-sided, I can't even lie to you right now
Yeah (yeah-yeah)

All she talkin' 'bout is come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me
Yeah
All she hit me with is come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me
