		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Eight legs primed
Machine-like stillness
As she bides her time
She does not think she doesn't need a mind
I'm full of envy for her simple life

Went the wrong way
Now it's too late
It's embedded
Deep within me

Eight legs primed
They found a body by the cave last night
My colleague must've misbehaved last night
He knew to seek her would be suicide

Eight legs primed
Efficiency is something I admire
And so inflicted with her wounds I smile
She does not know, to me she's been so kind
