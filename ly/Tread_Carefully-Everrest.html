		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's getting hard to breathe
Best think before you speak
So watch out
Don't say that
Just sit back and don't cause a scene
And tread carefully
Where are we heading
Our lives unraveling
The backlash ain't worth that
Turns out bad
So don't talk to me
So let them fire away, away
They like to see you try and dodge grenades
They make up a new game
And give it a new name
Hanging on by just a thread, a thread
They want to see you make mistakes instead
Should you conceal
Or say how you feel
Haunting words they won't forget
Forget the way you think
It's quite unsettling
Is this all we wanted
We've lost it
So tread carefully
So let them fire away, away
They like to see you try and dodge grenades
They make up a new game
And give it a new name
Hanging on by just a thread, a thread
They want to see you make mistakes instead
Should you conceal
Or say how you feel
Haunting words they won't forget
They won't forget
No they won't forget
No they won't forget
So tread carefully
Yeah tread carefully
Go spread your lies but set your sights on other targets please
Don't draw attention of the predators surrounding me
Go spread your lies but set your sights on other targets please
Don't draw attention of the predators surrounding me
They like to see you try and dodge grenades
They make up a new game
And give it a new name
Hanging on by just a thread, a thread
They want to see you make mistakes instead
Should you conceal
Or say how you feel
Haunting words they won't forget
They won't forget
They won't forget
They won't forget
So let them fire away, away
They like to see you try and dodge grenades
They make up a new game
And give it a new name
Hanging on by just a thread, a thread
They want to see you make mistakes instead
Should you conceal
Or say how you feel
Haunting words they won't forget
