		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I make no promises, I can't do golden rings
But I'll give you everything (tonight, uh)
Magic is in the air, there ain't no science here
So come get your everything (tonight, uh)

I make no promises, I can't do golden rings
But I'll give you everything (tonight, uh)
Magic is in the air, there ain't no science here
So come get your everything (tonight, uh)

I make no promises, I can't do golden rings
But I'll give you everything (tonight, uh)
Magic is in the air, there ain't no science here
So come get your everything (tonight, uh)

Tonight
Tonight (tonight, uh)
Tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, uh
Tonight, uh

Tonight, uh
Tonight, uh

Is it loud enough?
'Cause my body is calling for you, calling for you
I need someone
To do the things that I do, hmm
I'm heating up
Energy's taking control
I'm speeding up
My heartbeat's dancing alone

I make no promises, I can't do golden rings
But I'll give you everything (tonight, uh)
Magic is in the air, there ain't no science here
So come get your everything (tonight, uh)

I make no promises, I can't do golden rings
But I'll give you everything (tonight, uh)
Magic is in the air, there ain't no science here
So come get your everything (tonight, uh)

Tonight
Tonight

'Cause I need your green light, tonight (tonight, uh)
Day and night, say that you're mine
'Cause I need your green light
Day and night, say that you're mine
Tonight
Tonight

Say that you're mine
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight

Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, uh
