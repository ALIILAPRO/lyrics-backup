		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I like the grey in your hair
The way that you care about things in my life
I hope that you can see
The things we could be if you left her behind

I'm only eighteen, but I know how to love
I won't let you down if you let me try
I've had this dream about you for a while
I'm hoping that it can come true this time

If I call you baby, would that be alright?
I just want to want you without thinkin' twice
If I told you everything that's on my mind
Would you make an exception tonight?

I like the way that we talk
The stories you tell about fallin' in love
But I'm losing my mind
'Cause when I see you, I keep picturing us

I'm only eighteen, but I know how to love
I won't let you down if you let me try

If I call you baby, would that be alright?
I just want to want you without thinkin' twice
If I told you everything that's on my mind
Would you make an exception tonight?

If I call you baby, would that be alright?
I just want to want you without thinkin' twice
If I told you everything that's on my mind
Would you make an exception tonight?
