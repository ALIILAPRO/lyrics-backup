		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There was this girl
The most beautiful in the world
She had all the boys in town wrapped 'round her finger 
She would walk the halls 
And everyone would whisper and talk
Cause' all the girls in town wanted to be her 

But behind those emerald eyes 
She's a devil in disguise
The prom queen has blood on her hands
Every boy and girl she dates
Disappears without a trace
So be careful when she asks you to dance 

She's a motherfucking killer queen a psychopath a seventeen
A beauty in a blood-stained dress
She'll fill your heart with kerosene
And light you up 'til you can't breathe
If you cross her path you just might end up dead

There was this girl 
who was broken by the world 
Cause' every day at school they'd push and shove her 
But she had a plan
One day she would get her revenge
And those cheerleaders and jocks would be six feet under

But behind those angel eyes 
Lies I devilish surprise
The prom queen has killed for her crown
Every boy and girl she seeks 
Never comes back in one piece
So be careful when she tries to ask you out

She's a motherfucking killer queen, a psychopath at seventeen
A beauty in a blood-stained dress
She'll fill your heart with kerosene
And light you up 'til you can't breathe
If you break her heart you just might lose your head

She's dancing by herself
 she's crowned the queen of hell 
Tears will sink into her skin
She's gonna get revenge
You're all gonna know her name 
She's the one and only killer queen 

She's a motherfucking killer queen
She sold her soul at seventeen
A beautiful and broken mess
She'll fill your heart with kerosene
And light you up till you can't breathe
If you break her heart you just might meet your end
