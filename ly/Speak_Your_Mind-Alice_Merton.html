		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You say that it's all fine
But I can read your thoughts
And I can see that you ain't alright
But you won't tell me why
No, you won't tell me why

And you know that it's hard for me
To look at you and realize you're part of me
But nowadays you seem so far away from me
So out of reach
So out of reach

Won't you speak your mind?
There's a silence in the room and it is killing me
Speak your mind
There's a silence in the room and it is killing me
Speak your mind
There's a silence in the room and it is killing me
Speak your mind
Won't you come out of the corner and say

I know that you know me
And I know you better than you think you might know yourself
So why do you still act so lonely?
You know that you're my only

Do you know that it's hard for me
To watch you sink away and act so differently?
'Cause nowadays you seem so far away from me
So out of reach
So out of reach

Won't you speak your mind?
There's a silence in the room and it is killing me
Speak your mind
There's a silence in the room and it is killing me
Speak your mind
There's a silence in the room and it is killing me
Speak your mind
Won't you come out of the corner and say

Go in and lie in the bed you made
Keep all the words for the ones who play
'Cause I'm getting tired of the guessing game
Go in and lie in the bed you made
Keep all the words for the ones who play
'Cause I'm getting tired of the guessing game

Won't you speak your mind?
(Mi-mi-mind-mind)
There's a silence in the room and it is killing me
Speak your mind
There's a silence in the room and it is killing me
Speak your mind
(Speak your mind, speak your mind, speak your mind)
There's a silence in the room and it is killing me
Speak your mind
Won't you come out of your corner and say
