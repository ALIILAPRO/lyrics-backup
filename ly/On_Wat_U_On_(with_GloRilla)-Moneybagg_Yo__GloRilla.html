		  (Turn me up, YC)
GloRilla, woo
On the gang, hey
(SkyDiddy)

Fuck my ho, fuck that bitch
I don't give a fuck 'bout none of this shit
Leave me 'lone, don't text my phone
It is what it is, I'm on what you on
Fuck my nigga, he ain't shit
Boy ain't good for nothin' but dick
Flodgin' like you with yo' niggas
Pussy boy, you with that bitch (what?)

Askin' me 'bout bitches in the city that she think I'm fuckin'
Look dead in her eyes before I lie, I'd rather tell her nothin'
Oh, so you ain't got shit to say now, huh? Dumb ass
I rather tell her nothin', smirkin' in her face
What the fuck funny? Didn't I say change the subject?

Let me know right now (what?)
If there ain't no future us (why?)
'Cause, one too close to zero, gotta keep somethin' on tuck (shh)
She like, "Ew, you do too much" (so?)
I replied, "You don't do enough" (ho)
Even when we be into it, I can still pull up and fuck (uh)
Walkin' straight up out the house, you say I never hug and kiss you
Tryna see me every weekend (why?), damn, I need space to miss you
Know I love you, bae, our problems go away when my dick in you
When I call myself tryna do shit right, here go another issue (man)

Fuck my ho, fuck that bitch
I don't give a fuck 'bout none of this shit
Leave me 'lone, don't text my phone
It is what it is, I'm on what you on
Fuck my nigga, he ain't shit
Boy ain't good for nothin' but dick
Flodgin' like you with yo' niggas
Pussy boy, you with that bitch

All that tellin' folks I'm crazy, tell 'em how you got me fucked up
Yo' mom ain't got no daughters, boy, you ain't them bitches brothers (the fuck?)
Then you told me you that knew the bitch, but you ain't say you fucked her (hm)
Ol' cheatin' ass, toxic ass, good dick motherfucker (hate yo' ass)
With my man today (hm), back outside tomorrow (yeah)
I be done with him today, then be at his house tomorrow (my man)
I be bustin' out the windows, got 'em switchin' up his cars
He won't find shit in my phone but them lil' pictures of his card
Constantly bringin' up my ex and shit, he must want me to go back (huh?)
I could really pop my shit for real, but I don't think he know that (can't know that)
Cut that nigga off for good to show him that I'm on that
And he'll never, ever, ever, ever, ever get his ho back (on the gang)

Fuck my ho, fuck that bitch
I don't give a fuck 'bout none of this shit
Leave me 'lone, don't text my phone
It is what it is, I'm on what you on
Fuck my nigga, he ain't shit
Boy ain't good for nothin' but dick
Flodgin' like you with yo' niggas
Pussy boy, you with that bitch
Fuck my ho, fuck that bitch
I don't give a fuck 'bout none of this shit
Leave me 'lone, don't text my phone
It is what it is, I'm on what you on
Fuck my nigga, he ain't shit
Boy ain't good for nothin' but dick
Flodgin' like you with yo' niggas
Pussy boy, you with that bitch
