		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You touch my very soul
And I never thought it would be touched by a woman
You make a river flow
Deep down inside of me
Whisper in my ear and tell me how this is done
And it seems so weird,
But hold me close 'till we're done
Teach me how, don't let me down
I'm completely out of my mind
Our legs entwined
Two bodies, nothing in the middle
She says "Do not waste time"
C'mon girl, just put your lips on mine
I fell in love again
It happens now and then
But this time it ain't a man
So darlin' break these chains
And let me be myself
Oh come on
Take me to your room and let me know the real me
Tell me what to do
I'm shaking now, can't you see?
Set me free and let me be
The air that you breathe
Our legs entwined
Two bodies, nothing in the middle
She says "Do not waste time"
C'mon girl, just put your lips on mine
Sit on me if you wanna get rest
Place your head on my chest
Please tell me what's coming next
Sit on me if you wanna get rest
Place your head on my chest
Please tell me what's coming next
Our legs entwined
Two bodies, nothing in the middle
She says "Do not waste time"
C'mon girl, just put your lips on mine
