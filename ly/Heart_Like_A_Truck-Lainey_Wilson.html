		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I never stay in one place too long
A dirt road singin' me a siren's song
I gotta find a field, I need to spin my wheels
I gotta a hankerin' for four wide tires
And I can't help it, it's the way I'm wired
'Fore you get too close, boy, you need to know

I got a heart like a truck
It's been drug through the mud
Runs on dreams and gasoline
And that ol' highway holds the key
It's got a lead foot down when it's leavin'
Lord knows it's taken a hell of a beatin'
A little bit of love is all that it's needin'
But it's good as it is tough
I got a heart like a truck

There ain't no brakin' when I throw it in drive
Don't always keep it in between the lines
If you're ready for a ride
Pedal down state of mind
Boy, I tell you what
You better buckle up

I got a heart like a truck
It's been drug through the mud
Runs on dreams and gasoline
And that ol' highway holds the key
It's got a lead foot down when it's leavin'
Lord knows it's taken a hell of a beatin'
A little bit of love is all that it's needin'
But it's good as it is tough
I got a heart like a truck

Go on and see if you can knock off the dust, yeah
Shine it up, rev it up, and let it run, yeah
It gets a high ridin' off into the sun, yeah

I got a heart like a truck
It's been drug through the mud
Runs on dreams and gasoline
And that ol' highway holds the key
It's got a lead foot down when it's leavin'
Lord knows it's taken a hell of a beatin'
A little bit of love is all that it's needin'
But it's good as it is tough
I got a heart like a truck

Go on and see if you can knock off the dust, yeah
Shine it up, rev it up, and let it run, yeah
It gets a high ridin' off into the sun, yeah
It gets a high ridin' off into the sun
