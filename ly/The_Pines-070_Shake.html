		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I needa let go
But I don't wanna go out lonely
Right now I needa grow
And no one's gonna do that for me
And my bag's all stole
Where you thinkin 'bout stayin? 'Bout
Yeah you thinkin 'bout stayin, woah
Yeah you thinkin 'bout stayin

Gotta go, right now
I gotta go
Headed home
To a different timezone
Sun is low
Everything is going right
'Til she told me
Where she slept last night, yeah
Where'd you go, yeah
When the sun came down?
Karma knows
It'll come back around, yeah
Fire's hot, don't you let it go out, yeah
Fires hot, babe, don't you let it go out, oh

Where did you sleep last night? (Last night, night)
Where did you sleep last night? (Last night)
Oh, where did you sleep last night? (Last night)
Where did you sleep?

The pines, the pines, the pines
Where the sun don't ever shine
Shine, shine
Where the sun don't ever shine
Shine, shine
Where the sun don't ever shine
Shine, shine (shine)

Yeah, you can keep your bad advice, yeah
She was on me like white on rice
I already killed my ego twice
So sorry it'll 'cause another bad fight
Yes I'm young but I know just what I like
Yes I'm young but I know just what I like
Yes I'm young but I know just what I like

Where did you sleep last night? 
Oh, where did you sleep last night? (Last night, night)
Where did you sleep last night?

The pines, the pines, the pines
Where the sun don't ever shine
Shine, shine
Where the sun don't ever shine
Shine, shine
Where the sun don't ever shine
Shine, shine (shine)

(Fight back, they know I fight back)
(Right back, is he gon fight right back?)
(Fight back, they know I fight back)
(Right back, is he gon fight right back?)

The pines, the pines, the pines
Where the sun don't ever shine (shine)
Shine (shine), shine (shine)
Where the sun don't ever shine (shine)
Shine (shine), shine (shine)
Where the sun don't ever shine (shine)
Shine (shine), shine (shine)
