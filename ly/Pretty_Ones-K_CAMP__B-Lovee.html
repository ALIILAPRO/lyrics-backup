		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I do not like it when you tell me you're creating new music
Or when you share and unreleased song on social
You know why? Because I have to wait for them to drop, aha

Yeah
You like to get nasty, huh?
Like to get nasty, huh?
Bust it
You like to get nasty, huh?
You like to get nasty, huh?

Look, one time for the pretty ones
Them boys gotta give me one
Bad boy like Diddy's son, huh
My fragrance Louis V
I'm who they came to see
Chop shit like NLE, let's go (chop shit like NLE)

I ain't the one to be slept on
Brother workin' off a trap phone, let's go
I'ma bring them racks home
I got somethin' you can latch on
I love your ass
You like to get nasty, huh?
You like to get nasty, huh?
Yeah, what's happenin'?
You like to get nasty, huh?
You like to get nasty, huh? Let's go

Huh? What we tell 'em?

Grrah, oh, she thinkin' she nasty
Shakin' her hips to a fast beat
Shit can get real so don't ask me (you can have her)
Too many shots in the backseat
Girl, and you look like a baddie
Baby girl, you got the fatty
Hit from the back, got her callin' me daddy
Grrah, do your dance now
Word around town I'm the man now
Let 'em reach for my chain that's a man down
We just link and she pullin' my pants down (you can have her)
Look, I get a whole lot of money
Gotta get up and get it
I got that forty on me, that shit kickin'
She throw the pussy on me, then I'm hittin', then I'm hittin' (my lil' freak)

Like to get nasty, huh?
Like to get nasty, huh?
Talk to 'em
You like to get nasty, huh?
You like to get nasty, huh?

Yeah, one time for the pretty ones (one time)
Them boys gotta give me one (one time)
Bad boy like Diddy's son (one time)
Huh, my fragrance Louis V 
I'm who they came to see
Chop shit like NLE, let's go (let's get it)

Ain't got time to beef about no freak, you can have her (you can have her)
M-O-B, heard I got 'em mad, make 'em madder
Valet P, pull up in that ghost, oh, he Casper
Kept my faith, guess what? I turned to a rich lil' bastard
Oh, let's race, guess what? Them lil' horses make it faster (you can have her)
Let me taste, ooh, that lil' bitch got some standards
Pretty face, ooh, gotta get that shit on camera

Yeah
You like to get nasty, huh?
You like to get nasty, huh?
Bust it
You like to get nasty, huh?
You like to get nasty, huh?

Yeah, one time for the pretty ones (one time)
Them boys gotta give me one (one time)
Bad boy like Diddy's son (one time)
Huh, my fragrance Louis V 
I'm who they came to see
Chop shit like NLE, let's go
