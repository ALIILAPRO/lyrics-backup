		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My life ain't easy
No brother, my life ain't good
There is no redemption for a coward like me
But then again, no one said that it should

My voice ain't worthy
No dear sister, it shouldn't be heard
Because all that I've told you are lies upon lies upon lies
Oh poor sister, you never learn

My life ain't simple
Sugar coated, potent or fun
Tonight I'll be paying for fuckups
Through the barrel of a shotgun
Salvation will come

So dear father, poor mother, please listen
I've fucked up, I'm sorry to say
The son that you once knew is no longer with us
But I chose my own path
And it's not cause of you

Brother
Sister
Father
Mother
Ona
Opa
It's not cause of you
