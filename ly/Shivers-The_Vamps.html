		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We've all had better days
Days, they fade away
All that matters is where we are now
I'm a sinking stone
Carrying too much alone
All that I want is to be by your side

There's so much on my mind
Leaving me asking, why
I am so cold
My head's just above the water
And I wanna know who taught you
Just how to live this life, you know

You send shivers down my spine
Whenever I feel low
And when I'm so far from home
Always count my stars at night
You send shivers down my spine
Whenever I feel low
And when I'm so far from home
Always count my stars at night
You send shivers down my spine

And when the skies are grey
My demons come out to play
I promise they are not here to stay
Wherever we go now
I'm there if you fall down
Just know that I will only be by your side

There's one thing on my mind
You look into my eyes, and then you know

You send shivers down my spine
Whenever I feel low
And when I'm so far from home
Always count my stars at night
You send shivers down my spine
Whenever I feel low
And when I'm so far from home
Always count my stars at night
You send shivers down my spine

I'll be there when you get lonely
You have done the same for me
You can fall into my arms, fall back asleep
I know that people change, and you might, too
I will back you through and through
I believe it all happens for a reason

You send shivers down my spine
Whenever I feel low
And when I'm so far from home
Always count my stars at night
You send shivers down my spine
Whenever I feel low
And when I'm so far from home
Always count my stars at night
You send shivers down my spine

You send shivers down my spine
You send shivers down my spine
