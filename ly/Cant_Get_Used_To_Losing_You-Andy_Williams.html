		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Guess there's no use in hangin' 'round
Guess I'll get dressed and do the town
I'll find some crowded avenue
Though, it will be empty without you

Can't get used to losin' you, no matter what I try to do
Gonna live my whole life through, loving you

Called up some girl I used to know
After I heard her say, "Hello"
Couldn't think of anything to say
Since you're gone it happens every day

Can't get used to losin' you, no matter what I try to do
Gonna live my whole life through, loving you 

I'll find somebody, wait and see
Who am I kiddin'? Only me
'Cause no one else could take your place
Guess that I am just a hopeless case

Can't get used to losin' you, no matter what I try to do
Gonna live my whole life through, loving you

I can't get used to losin' you, no matter what I try to do
Gonna live my whole life through, loving you
