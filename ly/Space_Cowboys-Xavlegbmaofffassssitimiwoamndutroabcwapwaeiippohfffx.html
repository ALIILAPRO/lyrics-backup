		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Saddle the space horses
It's time to fly
Our journey to Planet Gore starts tonight

Lush Utopia
Turned into sinew and fat
Ready to ride
Galloping through time and space
Lightyears pass as we fade away
Go on our way, we gallop through space

Searching for those guilty of interplanetary sin
Lightyears pass as we fade away
Go on our way, we gallop through space
Searching for those guilty of interplanetary sin

A pirate ship in the distance
We have to try and catch them
We'll make them beg and scream for their lives
They have a bounty on their heads and we'll return them when they're dead
The bounty's ours and there will be no trial

This ship is ours
Invading their ships
These motherfuckers gonna get a taste of my clip
Creeping up with guns in hand

Killing them like there's no tomorrow
Guns ablaze as blood floods the deck
This ship's 'bout to become a wreck
Go make sure all the pirates are dead

We searched beneath the deck to find a large object cloaked in white
Tug at the veil to reveal a monstrous machine built to kill
I knew it all along
These pirate scum were hired to bring upon Armageddon
By turning all planets into raw meat so an unknown species can now feast

We will not rest until those responsible are dead
Armed with our guns and our trusty steeds
Bringing intergalactic corruption and end with every enemy that bleeds
I will search until I've discovered the unknown race and wiped them from existence
