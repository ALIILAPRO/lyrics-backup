		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, I've been up all night
Thinking 'bout dying
I've just been wasting time
When will I be alright?

God is not on my side
But God knows I'm trying
I need to redefine
When will I be alright?

Listen to my heart beating
Why is there this empty feeling?
Losing hope and all reason
When will I be alright?

I have lived half of life
Constantly fighting
Cheeks bruised and knuckles white
When will I be alright?

Hold my breath to stop breathing
Love, I used to know the meaning
I'd wake up if I was dreaming
But when will I be alright?

I saw, now I am blind
To all the seasons
I see a fading light
When will I be alright?

Listen to my heart beating
Why is there this empty feeling?
Losing hope and all reason
When will I be alright?

I tried my best to stop her leaving
I wonder about the arms she's in
This is it, the end is nearing
When will I be alright?
