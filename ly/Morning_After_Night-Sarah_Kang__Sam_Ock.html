		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hov'ring over darkness, everything was formless and void
Dust and days were breathless, before it all was naught but One voice
Out of splendid wonder, spoken was a Word of great Joy
Full of living color and every kind of beautiful noise
Children of the Glory, fallen with one fell choice
They chose their story and chaos for one, for all
But that was the start of something we could have never known
That from the first breath we would ne'er be on our own
Glory on high
Born in Great Night
Come and delight
In fragrant offering
Oh what a sight
Beloved light
On us You shine
With eternal blessing
Broken down with time
I long for peace of mind, oh my
Is this all there is to life
Striving until we die, we die
'Cause this doesn't feel right
Oh where's the truth and lie?
I want to believe that there's Morning after Night
My Savior, You're my Morning after Night
Glory on high
Born in Great Night
Come and delight
In fragrant offering
Oh what a sight
Beloved light
On us You shine
With eternal blessing
On us You shine
With eternal blessing
