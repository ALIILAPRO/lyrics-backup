		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Cessation of suffering is the path to lumination
Circles of death, a cycle of exhaustion
Disease like condition, the road to enrichment
Wash away the ashes of existence
The truth is you can not end your suffering
Embrace the truth
Embrace the pain
This is our violent reality
The four noble truths
Death, Birth, Life, Death
Taste the scythe
Bleed out your lies
Stripped our your disguise is where the truth hides
A hundred hallow souls behind empty eyes
Illness ends when you understand cause
Pain ends when you understand truth
This is our cycle, this is our meaning
Bleed more
Down on your knees crying for thee
This isn’t what you were waiting for
Bleed more
Graves and worms
This what we deserve
Haven’t you been listening
Bleed more
No one said this wasn’t going to hurt
Bleed More
Cessation of suffering is the path to lumination
Circles of death, a cycle of exhaustion
Disease like condition, the road to enrichment
Wash away the ashes of existence
Wash away, the ashes of existence
Now, cry out to the unknown
Man was meant to suffer
Our lives know no other
