		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh, uh, uh, uh (Phonz, where you at?)
Uh, uh, uh

Roses red, yeah, yeah, like my drank
Uh, violets blue like my Crip, bust your brain
All that disrespectful shit, I just can't tolerate
What really break my heart is niggas who say they loyal but ain't
Knives up in my back, I took 'em out and they betrayed
I don't ponder on no peons, they just yesterdays
I don't need no drugs, but I'd be lyin' if I said I don't
I don't want her love, but I need it 'cause it keep me goin'

Go to Hell and back on the daily, keep a blicky, that's my gun
And my mind go to dark places, so my beam, that's my son
I got lean, trust nobody but my fuckin' trap
AR-15 and the cold shoulder, that's the dap
We don't like to do no hand shakes, we don't trust 'em
I don't respect these women, slut 'em out, no hugs, just fuck 'em
I'm tryna have faith in somethin', I'm tryna believe in he
But if I don't believe in him, why he believe in me?
I need Holy water, but I'm drinkin' Hi-Tech
I'm fuckin' niggas' daughters, knowin' they got no self respect
From projects to private jets just to show my flex
I say it with my chest, I can't live check to check
Adidas stripes with Nike just to show I do my best
If I'm broke, I never sleep, I don't deserve no rest

Roses red, yeah, yeah, like my drank
Uh, violets blue like my Crip, bust your brain
All that disrespectful shit, I just can't tolerate
What really break my heart is niggas who say they loyal but ain't
Knives up in my back, I took 'em out and they betrayed
I don't ponder on no peons, they just yesterdays
I don't need no drugs, but I'd be lyin' if I said I don't
I don't want her love, but I need it 'cause it keep me goin'

Amy Winehouse, I need rehab like that
But I feel like Kurt Cobain, hidin' drugs, relapse
I be doin' better and I be gettin' worse
And when I go down, trust me, boy, it really hurt
I feel like Whitney Houston how I drown in drank
Ayy, it might be disrespectful, but that's just my pain
Feel like Whitney Houston how I drown in drank
Might be disrespectful, but that's just my pain

Just my pain
Just my pain
I feel like Whitney Houston, the way I drown in drank
It might be disrespectful, but I just drown my pain
Just my pain
Just my pain
I feel like Whitney Houston, the way I drown in drank
Drown in drank
I feel like Whitney Houston, the way I drown in drank
