		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm built like you are
I have a dress and a train
Your snake cold lips
Make a harsh straight line
That echoes through my brain

You're perfect
Let me lift a glass high
Let me follow in your footsteps
Let me follow in your sigh
Let me follow in your sigh

I'm a woman who likes men
But this is something else
I've never felt such stirrings
I feel like I
Was someone else

I wish you'd tie me up and beat me
Crush me like a kick
A bleeding strap across my back
Some blood that you could kiss

Oh kiss away, oh kiss away
I wish there was a strap of blood
That you could kiss away
I wish there was a strap of blood
That you could kiss away

Tie me with a scarf and jewels
Put a bloody gag to my teeth
I beg you to degrade me
Is there waste that I could eat

I am a secret lover
I am your little girl
Please spit into my mouth
I'm forever in your swirl

You're heartless and I love that
You have no use of me

But I open the sticks, sticky legs I bear
And then insert a fist, an arm
Some lost appendage
Please open me I beg

You are my Goliath
You are my Goliath
And I am mistress dread

Oh I am mistress dread
Oh I am mistress dread
Open and release me
I love you in my head

Oh kiss away kiss away
Kiss away kiss away

All I ask my baby
Kiss away
All I ask my baby
Kiss away
