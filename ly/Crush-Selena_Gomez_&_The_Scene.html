		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I guess I should've known
It wasn't gonna end okay,
You're such a trouble maker
But I like you just that way.

A bomb tick ticking with me
The one I'd best to blame
Just like I can't tell
And I'm ready to blow
I sat around a lot and thought
About the world without you
And no matter what you think,
Everything is not about you
You think I'm still hung up on you
But baby it's not true

Now look at me
Your memories're turning to dust
There's only one explanation
I wasn't really in love
(I wasn't really in love)
It was just a crush
It was just a crush
Sparks fly when we touch
It was never enough
It was just a crush
It was just a crush
Yeah

You found one the things you need
There's nothing left to lose
The things I never wanna be
I owe it all to you
You just can't help yourself
It's what you do
Cause this is real life
Not your show

Now look at me
The memories turn to dust
There's only one explanation
I wasn't really in love
(I wasn't really in love)
It was just a crush
It was just a crush
Sparks fly when we touched
It was never enough
It was just a crush
It was just a crush
Yeah,

You'll be fine,
Just find another girl
To kick around
Won't be long
Until they all know what
I figured out

Now look at me
Memories turn to dust
There's only one explanation
I wasn't really in love
(I wasn't really in love)
It was just a crush
(It just was a crush)
Sparks fly when we touched
It was never enough
It was just a crush
It was just a crush (It was just a crush)
Yeah
(It was just a crush)
It was just a crush
Yeah.
