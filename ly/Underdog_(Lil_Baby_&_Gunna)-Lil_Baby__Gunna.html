		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Matt, what up?)
Oh, oh
(June, you're a genius)
Ah, ah
(Ramy on the beat)

I want it all, the underdog, I go hard (go hard)
The word is lost, take care of my dogs, from my heart (my heart)
One for all, we gotta walk, we gon' march (march)
Ready for war, wit' my dogs, we gon' spark ('spark)
Started a tour, so I parked my foreigns in the garage (garage)
Less is more, I pick and choose, keep playin' it smart (playin' it smart)
'Ventador, my coupe's a sport, I lift up the doors (lift up the doors)
With these bars, the only thing I fear is God (God)

The only thing I fear is God (God)
You wasn't there when I was locked down in the pot (pot)
Went blind only thing I see is dollar signs (signs)
Show me loyalty, I let you ride
Still sip Codeine 'cause I just gotta get high (gotta get high)
I'm savin' my cheese 'cause we done have hard times (have hard times)
To the police I needed a peace of mind (peace of mind)
Wasn't no numbers, I had to cut off my line (cut off my line)
We through it all like a team, none of my kind
My clothes ain't wrinkled but I gotta stick with that iron
When bitches are cheatin', we fuckin', she tell me, "You lie" (tell me, "You lie")
Don't hate on these niggas, admit it, shit hard to decide

I want it all, the underdog, I go hard (go hard)
The word is lost, take care of my dogs, from my heart (my heart)
One for all, we gotta walk, we gon' march (march)
Ready for war, wit' my dogs, we gon' spark ('spark)
Started a tour, so I parked my foreigns in the garage (garage)
Less is more, I pick and choose, keep playin' it smart (playin' it smart)
'Ventador, my coupe's a sport, I lift up the doors (lift up the doors)
With these bars, the only thing I fear is God (God)

One for all, me and my dogs stay on call
Got a 4x4, it fits so tall, can't fit in garage 
Need a rich bitch, I'm like where is nigga Nicki Minaj
Money comin' in, like I play ball, but I don't play ball
In a supercharge, I'm a real dopeboy
With designer from my head to my toe, I drip hard
I can't pull up in the hood no more, that's what I grind for
Bitch tryna listen in on me, think I'm a drug lord
Had to make it to the finish line without no head start
Man I really came from nothin' all I know is to go hard
Me and Gunna, double R, niggas sendin' slick shots
On the tour bus with them killers, stay on Twitter, bitch bark

I want it all, the underdog, I go hard (go hard)
The word is lost, take care of my dogs, from my heart (my heart)
One for all, we gotta walk, we gon' march (march)
Ready for war, wit' my dogs, we gon' spark ('spark)
Started a tour, so I parked my foreigns in the garage (garage)
Less is more, I pick and choose, keep playin' it smart (playin' it smart)
'Ventador, my coupe's a sport, I lift up the doors (lift up the doors)
With these bars, the only thing I fear is God (God)
