		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Harlem River talk to me
Tell me what you think about
Harlem River I'm in love, love, love, love

Harlem River talk to me
Where are we headed now?
Harlem River I'm in love, love, love, love
All because of you

In my pearl and my diamond shoes
I've climbed a cloud now I stole the moon 
Harlem River 
Tell me is it true?

And Harlem River swallow me
Put your hands around my neck
And Harlem River I can't breathe
They've got the lights down now

All because of you

I don't know, I don't know 
Just where I'm going
Or where I've been
I don't know, I don't know 
Just where I'm going
'Cause I've never been

Oh Harlem River, like a diamond.
