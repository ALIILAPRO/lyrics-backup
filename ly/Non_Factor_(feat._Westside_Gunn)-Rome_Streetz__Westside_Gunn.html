		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, pay me mine motherfucker
Listen, I need my
You know what the fuck I need
(Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, look)
The socket to my motherfuckin-
(Check this out) to my mother- (Look)

Ayo
Had warrants for my apprehension (Uh, huh)
Hate from corny ass niggas that
Rap in my mentions (Fuck y'all niggas)
Austrian gats with extensions
Small cracks per ten cents
Big boulder for a hundred stash
It in a Benz van (Yeah)
Cartier glasses rimless
Lust for the cash endless
Rap with a vengeance
New smack for your syringes (Ah)
'Cause in the end you niggas is
All trash to begin with (Niggas trash)
I'm gods favorite even do amazing
When I wing it i needs my pockets socked too
And my ring kissed (Sock it to my pocket)
Was on the highway to hell now
This the road to new riches got it lit
They love my steelo' like them 702 bitches
No you can't fuck with who this is
(Nah) , I'm a rare breed
Remix the blow in the blender then
Compress it to a square piece
In jail I had the banger
Hidden in the hair grease (I did)
Murder music
Every time you hear Streetz I'm godly
Going stupid hard 'till it's Ferrari
On the car key took all of your fiends
I hit 'em offer the large piece (Haha)
Green Bape camouflage hoodie with
The shark teeth i need Marielle to draw me
Smoking holding a forty
It's Lord Streetz, pistol whip your jaw
You need false teeth (Run)
Been a heart-throb making all of
The pretty broads queef
Peeling off in Porsche jeeps (Skrrrt)
My auras more Dior crime connoisseur
Broke whores can't afford me (Nuh uh)
She tryna' orgy and suck me
Off for a tour tee
Kick your shit in, fuck a door key
I move raw like I'm Corky
On a cold New York street (Haha)

I need my money on the
First and every time after (After)
Cross the line and my slime clap ya'
(Bow, Bow) hustling nigga that just happened
To be a rapper
You other niggas is a non factor
(You niggas washed) i need my money on the
First and every time after (Uh, huh)
Cross the line and my slime clap ya'
(Boom, Boom)
Hustling nigga that just happened
To be a rapper
You other niggas is a non factor

Ayo hold up, The Tec fold up
(Doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot)
M-16 out the rose truck
Closest thing to perfection
24 Karat gold Lexus
My neck got necklace on top of necklace
You reach it's a Deathwish
I'll leave your chest swissed
German Suplexes
Hundred pounds I did two sets
I'm too blessed, You talk more and do less
I talk less and rule the turf
Peace to my earth
We ride around in fiend rentals every first
Thirty rocks got me an infinit- J-30
"Woot" to my nigga Jay Worthy (Woot)
James banging at my place early (Ah)
Pistol whipped the fuck-nigga knocked
Out his pearlies cops chase us down Belly
Jumped out on Shirley
Fiends draggin' by my ankle saying "West
Serve me"

I need my money on the
First and every time after (After)
Cross the line and my slime clap ya'
(Bow, Bow) hustling nigga that just happened
To be a rapper
You other niggas is a non factor
(You niggas washed) i need my money on the
First and every time after (Uh, huh)
Cross the line and my slime clap ya'
(Boom, Boom)
Hustling nigga that just happened
To be a rapper
You other niggas is a non factor
(You niggas trash)
