		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I thought the ending was the worst of all
But we both got issues that are unresolved
So we're making it
Bed of lies
Let you lay in it
One last time

Told you a secret that you couldn't keep
When I let you down you'd hold it over me
Gave you leverage
Intertwined
So I severed it

Staring at the screen
When I should be asleep
I thought I let you go
Let me suffer in peace

Feels like you're frozen
Stuck in my mind
Flooded with emotions
Blurring the lines
In between your curse
And the remedy
I've seen your worst
And it cut too deep
You're frozen
Stuck in my mind

Going insane chasing your spirit
Guess I made it up
Then I caught my reflection in your broken love
Did your arrogance
Save us both the embarrassment?
Cold as ice

I'm losing touch and I'm finding something cope with
But all I see is your body, it's feeling hopeless
Somebody save me from myself

Staring at the screen
When I should be asleep
I thought I let you go
Let me suffer in peace

Feels like you're frozen
Stuck in my mind
Flooded with emotions
Blurring the lines
In between your curse
And the remedy
I've seen your worst
And it cut too deep
You're frozen
Stuck in my mind

Oooh
I wish I was numb to you
Turning blue
I'm caught in the middle
Cause you've overused
My trust just a little
Would you celebrate
A heart that breaks?

Feels like you're frozen
Stuck in my mind
Flooded with emotions

Feels like you're frozen
Stuck in my mind
Flooded with emotions
Blurring the lines
In between your curse
And the remedy
I've seen your worst
And it cut too deep
You're frozen
Stuck in my mind

You're frozen
(Stuck in my mind)
You're frozen
(Stuck in my mind)
You're frozen
Stuck in my mind
