		  (IanoBeatz) (Mayyzo)
(Loesoe going crazy)

Everything pure
I got the purest diamonds out the floor
I got to count it twice just to be sure
Can't trust nobody, can never be sure
I hustle every day, don't want to be poor
Repent every day just so I can stay pure
My bitch is the purest, a purebred for sure
Pure drip on my body, Comme des Garçons
My heart is the purest
They rag it and bone it
I tried to be pure but this world is so phony
I told you don't leave your ho 'round me
Lil' homie she kiss on my neck, YSL cologne
These niggas be cap 'bout they sales
Columbus

I pulled up in a Hellcat at the dungeon
Yellow diamonds, pinky ring like a Funyun
Yes, I can make your shit tear, no onions
Pull out the knife, boy
They spitting balogna
I tried the Benz but the
Rolls Royce goin' dummy
This Prada jacket have you proud for nothin'
She hopped in my bed, and we went beyond
I'm proud of her head, drape her in Armani
You pussy lil' niggas get drilled, no army
What's in my cup same color as Barney
Matter of fact
I need the plug out the pharmacy
My ho gon' hop out that closet, no Narnia
Guess that she bi, I guess it's the money
Got blues like the skies
Ain't talking 'bout hundreds
Niggas talking beef
We gon' pull up like Huggies
Got the Noah's Ark AP on, I'm flooded
Niggas not even ready for this discussion
She gon' give me head 'til
I get a concussion
Baby on my motherfuckin' skin like lotion
Pop a Percocet, now I move slow motion
Everything I do is real golden
All these hoes know that I'm chosen
Know I am the wave, no ocean
Got my ex bitch trying to get a token
Trying to call me every time her boy broken
Got big racks on me, yeah, stuffed crust
Yeah, I don't even pass, I only puff-puff
I'm just gon' blow gas, that's yes-yes

Everything pure
I got the purest diamonds out the floor
I got to count it twice just to be sure
Can't trust nobody, can never be sure
I hustle every day, don't want to be poor
Repent every day just so I can stay pure
My bitch is the purest, a purebred for sure
Pure drip on my body, Comme des Garçons
My heart is the purest
They rag it and bone it
I tried to be pure but this world is so phony
I told you don't leave your ho 'round me
Lil' homie she kiss on my neck, YSL cologne
These niggas be cap 'bout they sales
Columbus everything pure
I got the purest diamonds out the floor
I got to count it twice just to be sure
Can't trust nobody, can never be sure
I hustle every day, don't want to be poor
Repent every day just so I can stay pure
My bitch is the purest, a purebred for sure
Pure drip on my body, Comme des Garçons
My heart is the purest
They rag it and bone it
I tried to be pure but this world is so phony
I told you don't leave your ho 'round me
Lil' homie she kiss on my neck, YSL cologne
These niggas be cap 'bout they sales
Columbus
