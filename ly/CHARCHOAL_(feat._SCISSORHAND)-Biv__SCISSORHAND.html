		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So fucking paranoid I sit back wait for my heart to explode
Fucking weak that I can't bring myself to rest in my own home
I got issues that I'm dealing with so let me be alone
Take a polaroid of all my fears pin it to my dome

Nothing left
Drained all the blood that I've bled
I'm blind
Only colour that I see is red
I'm ashamed of the skin that I've shed
I dine
Only thing that I taste is led

Insomnia got me picking at my flesh
And my paranoia got me in a fucking mess 
Ima
Let loose
In a mess
Ima
Let loose cuz I feel death prowl

I hit up homie like yo biv let's make them fucking scream
Scizzy and mercy the hardest the underground has seen
Shit got me dizzy get gritty my aura coloured green
Schoolboy Q in this bitch banking those collard greens

Sick of all of you leeches
Scene is in pieces
I gotta fix this shit
I am all of your weakness
You are just schemas
You cannot trick me bitch
Think that you got potential driving all of those fucking rentals boy
You gotta weak mental all you trap boys
Think you metal

Wig split
Finna put that bitch up on my hit list
Dip shit, told me I was nothing so I pissed it
Off with my wrist slit, coughin up my bitch fit
Miss this, couldn't find they lane so I picked it

Fuck a budget
Bitch I'm showing up with something
I can tell that I mean nothing, yuh
Fuck a budget
Bitch I'm showing up with something
Why you caught up all the sudden?

Fuck, what they sayin
I got times a wastin
You ain't never save him
Boy don't test my patience
Only in your statements
Who the fuck you playin?
How you finna make it?
Bitch don't keep me waitin

Fucked up
You ain't tryna see me when I'm fucked up
Fucked up
You ain't tryna see me when I'm fucked up

Put a rack in homie's hand, just because I can
Still ain't good enough for man, get more than I plan
Smoke a couple packs and think they livin off the land
Home of the free, caskets for the broke and damned

I'm better off workin nights
Not the vulture type, but still the one to earn my stripes
Tryna get my money right, put fam in better light
Then eat a 30 clip and call this shit a life

Fucked up
Fucked up, Fucked up
Fucked up
Fucked up, Fucked up
Fucked up
Fucked up, Fucked up
Fucked up
Fucked
You ain't tryna see me when I'm
Fucked up
Fucked up, Fucked up
Fucked up
Fucked up, Fucked up
Fucked up
Fucked up, Fucked up
Fucked up
Fucked up, Fucked up
