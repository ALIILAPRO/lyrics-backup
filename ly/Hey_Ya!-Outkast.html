		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One, two, three, uh

My baby don't mess around
Because she loves me so
And this I know fo sho (uh)
But does she really wanna
But can't stand to see me walk out the door? (Ah)
Don't try to fight the feeling
Because the thought alone is killin' me right now (uh)
Thank God for Mom and Dad
For sticking two together
'Cause we don't know how (c'mon)

Hey ya! Hey ya!
Hey ya! Hey ya!
Hey ya! Hey ya!
Hey ya! Hey ya!

You think you've got it
Oh, you think you've got it
But got it just don't get it 'til there's nothin' at all
We get together
Oh, we get together
But separate's always better when there's feelings involved
If what they say is
"Nothing is forever"
Then what makes, then what makes
Then what makes, then what makes (what makes, what makes)
Love the exception?
So why, oh, why, oh
Why, oh, why, oh, why, oh
Are we so in denial when we know we're not happy here?
(Y'all don't want to hear me, you just want to dance)

Hey ya! (Uh oh) Hey ya! (Uh oh)
Don't want to meet your daddy
Hey ya! (Uh oh)
Just want you in my Caddy (Uh oh)
Hey ya! (Uh oh)
Don't want to meet your mama
Hey ya! (Uh oh)
Just want to make you cum-a (Uh oh)
Hey ya! (Uh oh)
I'm, I'm, I'm just being honest (Uh oh)
I'm just being honest

Hey! Alright now
Alright now, fellas (Yeah?)
Now, what cooler than being cool? (Ice cold!)
I can't hear you
I say what's, what's cooler than being cool? (Ice cold!) 

Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright

Okay, now ladies (Yeah?)
Now, we gon' break this thang down in just a few seconds
Now, don't have me break this thang down for nothin'
Now, I want to see y'all on y'all baddest behavior
Lend me some sugar, I am your neighbor
Ah! Here we go

Shake it, shake, shake it, shake it, shake, shake it (Uh oh)
Shake it, shake, shake it, shake it, shake it (Uh oh)
Shake it like a Polaroid picture, hey ya!

Shake it, shake, shake it, shake it, shake, shake it
Shake it, shake it, shake it, sugar
Shake it like a Polaroid picture

Now, all Beyonce's, and Lucy Liu's
And baby dolls
Get on the floor

Get on the floor, you know what to do
You know what to do
You know what to do

Hey ya! (Uh oh) Hey ya! (Uh oh)
Hey ya! (Uh oh) Hey ya! (Uh oh)
Hey ya! (Uh oh) Hey ya! (Uh oh)
Hey ya! (Uh oh) Hey ya! (Uh oh)
