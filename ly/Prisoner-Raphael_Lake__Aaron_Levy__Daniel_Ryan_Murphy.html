		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

Closed eyes
Never feel safe
I'm tongue, tied
Never let out my rage
Try to break in this cage
But where would I go?

I'm stuck living a life of bad luck 
Giving me nothing
Doors shut, alone in my head
I'm out of control

Am I losing my sanity?
I'm over my head
I'm in a dark dream
I'm a prisoner here
They'll never let me leave

Losing grip on reality
I'm over the edge
I yell and I scream
I'm a prisoner here
Come get me, set me free

(Ooh)

Hurt me, do what you want
I'm thirsty, feeding me bones
The hunger is all that I know
I'm starving for air

Trapped here, sinking in deeper
Cold sweat, where from a fever
I'm kept, locked in a box
And nobody cares

Am I losing my sanity?
I'm over my head
I'm in a dark dream
I'm a prisoner here
They'll never let me leave

Losing grip on reality
I'm over the edge
I yell and I scream
I'm a prisoner here
Come get me, set me free

Dark dreams
Every time I close my eyes
Demons coming after me
I'm tired, please
Every time I close my eyes 
I see them coming after me
These dark dreams
Every time I close my eyes
Demons coming after me
I'm tired, please
Every time I close my eyes 
I see them coming after me

Am I losing my sanity?
I'm over my head
I'm in a dark dream
I'm a prisoner here
They'll never let me leave

Losing grip on reality
I'm over the edge
I yell and I scream
I'm a prisoner here
Come get me, set me free

Dark dreams
Every time I close my eyes
Demons coming after me
I'm tired, please
Every time I close my eyes 
I see them coming after me
