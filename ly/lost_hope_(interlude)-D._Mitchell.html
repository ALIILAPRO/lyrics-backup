		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh
I'm too high
Too high, too high, too high, too high
I'ma real ass nigga til the day I die
Ain't shit fake, no CGI
And I'm MIA when I'm in the sky
Think they counted me out, man I ain't gone lie
Ain't looking too good for a lot of y'all, no
Young kid, 19, live with his momma, still selling that dope
Gave up a dream, what you mean, how you young and you lose all hope?
Ay, and I believed in you
Ay, I believed in you
You let me down
Should of seen this shit coming long time from a mile around
I done been through shit like everybody, through my ups and downs
But you get be back up every time that they knock you down
That's life, either take it or you fake it with a happy smile
Tell a hater every reason in the world why you happy now
Are you happy now, yeah?
I'm too high
Too high, too high, too high, too high
I'ma real ass nigga til the day I die
Ain't shit fake, no CGI
And I'm MIA when I'm in the sky
Think they counted me out, man I ain't gone lie
Ain't looking too good for a lot of y'all, no
Young kid, 19, live with his momma, still selling that dope
Gave up a dream, what you mean, how you young and you lose all hope?
Are you happy now, yeah?
Are you happy now, yeah?
Are you happy now, yeah?
