		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, I seen you there
Looking all pretty when you brushed your hair
Yeah, I like it when you smile
Won't you stay with me just for a little while?

Can I take you home?
Can I take you home?
We can go anywhere you wanna go
Can I take you high
To the mountain sky?
We can go as far as you wanna go
Pa, pa, pa, pa, pa, pa
Pa, pa, pa, pa, pa, pa

Sitting here now beneath them stars
Makes me wanna take them wings to my arms
She's got this way, she's got this way
Of wrapping her little heart around mine

Can I take you home?
Can I take you home?
We can go anywhere you wanna go
Can I take you high
To the mountain sky?
We can go as far as you wanna go
Pa, pa, pa, pa, pa, pa
Pa, pa, pa, pa, pa, pa

Can I take you home?
Can I take you home?
We can go anywhere you wanna go
Can I take you high
To the mountain sky?
We can go as far as you wanna go
Pa, pa, pa, pa, pa, pa
Pa, pa, pa, pa, pa, pa
Pa, pa, pa, pa, pa, pa
Pa, pa, pa, pa, pa, pa
