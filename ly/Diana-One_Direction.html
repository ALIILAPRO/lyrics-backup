		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Diana

The front pages are your pictures
They make you look so smart
How could someone not miss you at all? (Oh-ah-oh)

I never would mistreat ya
I'm not a criminal
I speak a different language but I still hear your call

Diana, let me be the one to
Light a fire inside those eyes
You've been lonely, you don't even know me
But I can feel you crying
Diana, let me be the one to
Lift your heart up and save your life
I don't think you even realize
Baby you'll be saving mine

Diana, it's only been four months but
You've fallen down so far
How could someone mislead you at all? (Oh ah oh)

I wanna reach out for you
I wanna break these walls
I speak a different language but I still hear you call

Diana, let me be the one to
Light a fire inside those eyes
You've been lonely, you don't even know me
But I can feel you crying
Diana, let me be the one to
Lift your heart up and save your life
I don't think you even realize
Baby you'll be saving mine

We all need something
This can't be over now
If I could hold ya
Swear I'd never put you down

Diana, let me be the one to
Light a fire inside those eyes
You've been lonely, you don't even know me
But I can feel you crying
Diana, let me be the one to
Lift your heart up and save your life
I don't think you even realize
Baby you'll be saving mine

(Oh ah oh) Diana
(Oh ah oh oh oh oh oh oh) Diana, baby you'd be saving mine
(Oh ah oh) Diana
(Oh ah oh oh oh oh oh oh) Diana, baby you'd be saving mine
