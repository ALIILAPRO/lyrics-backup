		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wonder if I am dreaming
Everything feels so strange now
Under this old town's sky
I wonder if there's still meaning
In all the things I'm feeling
Should I say goodbye?

Take me back
To when things were easier
Take me back
To a place that feels like home
When was that?

I wonder if you can hear me
Wonder if you can feel my heart
Beating now
I wonder if I'll be okay
Wonder if things will keep on changing
Will I fall down

Take me back
To when things were easier
Take me back
To a place where I belong
Take me back
To a place that feels like home
When was that?
