		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Good evening ladies and gentlemen
I go by the name of Eldee the don
And I just wanna say thank you for buying the album
For supporting me through my career
For supporting Nigerian music
I appreciate you yeah
A little boy had a dream listen

I was 13 mic on trying to kick a better flow
All night lights on mama couldn’t hear me though
Tape deck overdub just to get my ad-libs
Battling my boys on the block for some practice
Mix tapes high school got my reputation
Dreamt about the days I’d be getting heavy rotation
Unilag last choice higher education
Weak songs on the radio was motivation

Huh mama wasn’t really excited
But I aced every school class I was provided
Left her with no choice plus I had a dope voice
So she put some money up just so I could turn it up
A little louder made her a little prouder
She paid for the studio made me a founder
Trybe Records was born it started as a dream
It's been a long time coming shit is never why it seems though

If you could see what I've seen
Been to places I've been
Take a walk in shoes
And know what it's like to be me
It's been a long time
Oh yeah we made it
I know it's been a while
Thank God we made it

Then it was Trybesmen shake body couldn’t really make money
But we made some hits though brothers had a sick flow
Sold tapes outta my trunk couldn’t get a slam dunk
No distribution we were getting punked
Trips to Alaba tryna have it all make sense
Aaw men that was intense
I created the paper pack to make some paper back
Cos I figured it would work tryna get us on the map
Soon enough brothers had to go their own way
Everybody steady tryna make their own pay
It was his fault yeah that's what they’re gon say
But God knows best so I don’t stress
Moving on I took a trip to Atlanta
To figure how to lace my bread with some planta
And yeah I aced that but then I got bored
Right guy in the wrong place on the wrong board
I figured I should follow my dreams
And go back to my roots go back to my truth
If I could do it all again it’d be the same thing
Run it back no regrets do the same thing

If you could see what I've seen
Been to places I've been
Take a walk in shoes
And know what it's like to be me
It's been a long time
Oh yeah we made it
I know it's been a while
Thank God we made it

Now 08 bosi gbangba made some big boys
Yeah he back now tryna make some big noise
But they held back like I was a new cat
I said I was a pioneer I still had to prove that
Somehow I motivated every one of them
They’re eating they don’t know how it got in front of them
But I ain't tripping I'm just tryna get in front of them
Soon enough top 3 see that I am one of them
Collab-collabo show em that I'm a beast
My versatility competition doesn’t exist
They wanna hear me rap more spit a couple bars
I rap I sing I'm a superstar

If you could see what I've seen
Been to places I've been
Take a walk in shoes
And know what it's like to be me
It's been a long time
Oh yeah we made it
I know it's been a while
Thank God we made it

Yeah again I wanna say thank you
A little boy had a dream
And y’all made it come true
Shout out to everybody who supported my music from day one
I appreciate y’all
All of followers on Twitter
My fans on Facebook
And everybody who shows me love
Y’all keep me going

Shout out to my new team at Trybe records
Thank you Sojay
The world is yours
Peace
