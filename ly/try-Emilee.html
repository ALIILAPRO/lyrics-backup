		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I hug myself again and cry
Wondering how I got here onto your side
Haven't thought of you in a long time but
It's fine, it's fine, I'm fine
It's getting hard to be alright
Not used to being alone all night
Haven't heard from you in a long time but
I know you'd say I'm fine
I've been looking for you but you're hard to find
Just wishing I could understand why I keep reminiscing
On what could've been a reason to try, to try, to try
Sometimes I think of you as mine
It takes a moment to remember I
couldn't be the way you needed me to be
You always wondered why
I've been looking for you but you're hard to find
Just wishing I could understand why I keep reminiscing
On what could've been a reason to try, to try, to try
You got away, you got away
I've been looking for you but you're hard to find
Just wishing I could understand why I keep reminiscing
On what could've been a reason to try, to try, to try
Just wishing I could understand why I keep reminiscing
On what could've been a reason to try, to try, to try
