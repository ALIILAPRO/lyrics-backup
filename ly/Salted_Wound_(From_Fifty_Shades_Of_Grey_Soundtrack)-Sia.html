		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lonely float got in the way
You are the feel, and knew it anyway
Take a chance, it wasn't what you know
Take my hand, and don't let go

Oh, ooh ooh
And you can do it,
Don't break
Yeah, you'll pull through it,
You're safe
Yes, you can do it
Don't break
Yeah, you'll pull through it,
You're safe

Tell her on how you feel,
Give her every say she needs to hear
Give your heart, and say come take it
And she will see you're a good man

Oh, ooh ooh
And you can do it,
Don't break
Yeah, you'll pull through it,
You're safe
Yes, you can do it
Don't break
Yeah, you'll pull through it,
You're safe
Yes, you can do it,
Don't break
Yeah, you'll pull through it,
You're safe
