		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I gave you my love
Though crystalized 
I sent you a rose with nevermore
So many years 
So many hours 
And only thistles on my shore
For all that it's worth 
The blood on my hands
Is the blood of divinities 
And all that is lost 
Sound or unsound
Only bonds between you and me

If I go will you follow 
Me trough the cracks and hollows 
And I would be your Cain
If you would be here now

The Mother-of-Pearl 
Handcrafted by God 
You're the tower they built to reach the sky 
A White Falcon beauty 
My mark on your skin 
Follow me down the stairs when we die 
Your soul is in heaven
Your body in hell
It doesn't matter much to me 
In the night of the unborn
Sound or obscene 
Only bonds between you and me

If I go will you follow 
Me trough the cracks and hollows 
And I would be your Cain
If you would be here now

Blessed be our Lady Nuit
Guide us to Ra-Hoor-Khuit 
In your night we find shelter
Before the Helter Skelter
