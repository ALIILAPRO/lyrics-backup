		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  From the moment I met you, everything changed
I knew I had to get you, whatever the pain
I had to take you and make you mine

I would walk through the desert
I would walk down the aisle
I would swim all the oceans just to see you smile
Whatever it takes is fine

So put your hands up
Cause it's a stand up
And I won't be leaving 'til I finish stealing every piece of your heart
Every piece of your heart

I know your hearts been broken
But don't you give up
I'll be there, yeah I know it
To fix you with love
It hurts me to think that you've ever cried

So put your hands up
Cause it's a stand up
And I won't be leaving 'til I finish stealing every piece of your heart
Every piece of your heart
So put your hands up
Cause it's a stand up
And I won't be leaving 'til I finish stealing every piece of your heart

And I will steal us a car
And we will drive to the stars
I will give you the moon
It's the least I can do if you give me the chance

So put your hands up
Cause it's a stand up

(I'm a thief, I'm a thief)
You can call me a thief
(I'm a thief, I'm a thief)
But you should know your part
(I'm a thief, I'm a thief)
I'm only here
(I'm a thief, I'm a thief)
Because you stole my heart

(I'm a thief, I'm a thief)
So put your hands up
(I'm a thief, I'm a thief)
Cause it's a stand up
And I won't be leaving till I finish stealing every piece of your heart

Cause you stole my heart
(I'm a thief, I'm a thief)
Call me a thief
(I'm a thief, I'm a thief)
But you should know your part
(I'm a thief, I'm a thief)
I'm only here
(I'm a thief, I'm a thief)
Because you stole my heart
