		<p>
		  Make a stack, PepeLaugh, got all of these bitches mad
She suck me and I do not give her bans
I feel like Twitch staff, clip that, ayy
This bitch finna give me whiplash
Took my fuckin' breath away, I'm finna take that shit back
Bitch you cappin' and you big mad
I'm just fucking trappin', gettin' cat girls and some big bands
Pull up causin' havoc, jacksepdicy how I whip that
Make more than your dad, but I know you wouldn't get that

Masked up, got me lookin' like no face
Make it rain, leave her wet, like a snowflake
I tell her gimme space, she like, "No way"
That's a red flag, bitch, olè (sorry)
Masked up, got me lookin' like no face
Make it rain, leave her wet, like a snowflake
I tell her gimme space, she like, "No way"
That's a red flag, bitch, olè

Fine lass, nice ass, cat ears and she uwu, uh
Fuck around do shadow puppets, back of the Subaru
I got chipped black nails and a badder bitch than you do
Only want me 'cause I'm sad, bitch, I ain't afraid to lose you

She always got her collar on, she always fucking calling me
What she call me senpai for? Don't call me that I'm not a weeb
She like the way I look at her, she like that I am hard to please
I cannot fuckin help it bro these cat girls always fall for me
They all try to fix me, uh
Fuckin' switch up, like a blade on me, uh
Got her handcuffed, put chains on me, bitch
I don't give a fuck, do not try to change me
