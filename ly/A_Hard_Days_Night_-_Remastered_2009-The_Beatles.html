		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's been a hard day's night
And I've been workin' like a dog
It's been a hard day's night
I should be sleepin' like a log
But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright

You know I work all day
To get you money to buy you things
And it's worth it just to hear you say
You're gonna give me everything
So why on Earth should I moan?
'Cause when I get you alone
You know I feel okay

When I'm home 
Everything seems to be right
When I'm home 
Feeling you holding me tight, tight, yeah

It's been a hard day's night
And I've been workin' like a dog
It's been a hard day's night
I should be sleepin' like a log
But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright, ow

So why on Earth should I moan?
'Cause when I get you alone
You know I feel okay

When I'm home
Everything seems to be right
When I'm home
Feeling you holding me tight, tight, yeah

Oh, it's been a hard day's night
And I've been workin' like a dog
It's been a hard day's night
I should be sleepin' like a log
But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright
You know I feel alright
You know I feel alright
