		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You feel it and I feel it
There's no new words to say
You're changing, rearranging
There's a whole new game to play
But this time I think I've lost
Only memories of the past
Tell me where did I go wrong
Was it you all along

Love is not a game
The stakes are high, you're playing with fire
Love is not a game
Knock over the pieces and start it again

You know it 'cause you show it
You should never hide it from me
I'm trying, really trying
To be what you want me to be
These emotions are killing me
I can't let go are you crazy
Thought the pleasure had just begun
Look what we have become
