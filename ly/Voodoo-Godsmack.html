		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm not the one who's so far away
When I feel the snakebite enter my veins
Never did I want to be here again
And I don't remember why I came

Candles raise my desire
Why I'm so far away
No more meaning to my life
No more reason to stay
Freezing feeling, breathe in, breathe in
I'm coming back again

I'm not the one who's so far away
When I feel the snakebite enter my veins
Never did want to be here again
And I don't remember why I came

Hazing clouds rain on my head
Empty thoughts fill my ears
Find my shade by the moonlight
Why my thought aren't so clear
Demons dreaming, breathe in, breathe in
I'm coming back again

I'm not the one who's so far away
When I feel the snakebite enter my veins
Never did want to be here again
And I don't remember why I came

I'm not the one who's so far away
When I feel the snakebite enter my veins
Never did want to be here again
And I don't remember why I came

I'm not the one who's so far away
When I feel the snakebite enter my veins
Never did want to be here again
And I don't remember why I came

I'm not the one who's so far away
When I feel the snakebite enter my veins
Never did want to be here again
And I don't remember why I came

Voodo, voodo, voodo, voodo
Voodo, voodo, voodo, voodo

So far away
I'm not the one who's so far away
I'm not the one who's so far away
I'm not the one who's so far away
