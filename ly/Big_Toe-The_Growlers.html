		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I am a dealer with an infinite tab
A gentleman in some of the sense
She acts like I'm ripping off scabs
No wonder she has no friends at all

She's a lost cause
So count your losses

How was I supposed to know she'd ruin me
Beauty strong enough to trick me
Quick clouds of storms so moody
Got me looking around in the forbidden city

She is the coldest
She's turning me silver
She's got me on the bridge 
Looking down at the old cold river

She can hex like a crow
She howls harder than the wind can blow
Her love's so uncomfortable
She strikes down like a hammer on your big toe

She's a lost cause
So count your losses

Wasting her window of beauty
The only thing she has to offer
The grace of her face is a terrible waste
Behind, it's something awful

She's a lost cause
So count your losses
She's a cold bitch
She's turning me silver
She's got me on the bridge 
Looking down at the old cold river
