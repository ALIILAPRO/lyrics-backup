		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Who's that? What's that? (Who?)
I don't know what I'm doing but I, text her WhatsApp (WhatsApp)
Telling her to come through and then I
Copped a Big Mac (ching)
Milkshake and some large fries, it cost
Four pound fifty
Take the gherkin out of the inside

Who's that? What's that? (What's that?)
I don't know what I'm doing but I, text her WhatsApp (brrt)
Telling her to come through and then I
Copped a Big Mac (L'cheim)
Milkshake and some large fries, it cost
Four pounds fifty
Take the gherkin out of the inside

House party on a cold night
I got goosebumps but it's alright (alright)
Got a Grey Goose for a good price
And I mix that with coke and ice (ching)
2 A.M. and I'm in town
Dance in the street like I'm Chris Brown (dance)
Bouncer comes, has me pinned down
But he let me go for twenty pound (ching)

Where's my wallet? (Wallet)
Swear it was in my pocket (pocket)
My bank card was in there
And I need to make a deposit (broke)
I think I'm 'bout to vomit (vomit)
I shouldn't have ate that omelette (nah)
Bought 50p of bitcoin
Made two pound of profit (I'm rich)
My mate says he's lost it
I thought he meant my wallet (what?)
Can't find his phone so he asked me to call it (brrt-brrt)

Who's that? What's that? (What's that?)
I don't know what I'm doing but I, text her WhatsApp (WhatsApp)
Telling her to come through and then I
Copped a Big Mac (Big Mac)
Milkshake and some large fries, it cost
Four pound fifty
Take the gherkin out of the inside (no gherkin)

Who's that? What's that? (What's that?)
I don't know what I'm doing but I, text her WhatsApp (WhatsApp)
Telling her to come through and then I
Copped a Big Mac (Big Mac)
Milkshake and some large fries, it cost
Four pounds fifty
Take the gherkin out of the inside

This girl knows nothing (nothing)
She can't tell if I'm bluffing
She can't have a good discussion
Without her trying push my buttons (buttons)
And she's not that good with numbers (numbers)
She stole like half my jumpers (thief)
Took her to meet my family and she squared up to my cousin (bow)
Yeah she's mad (she's mad)
She'll try to fight my dad
Got her a taxi from the airport and she tried to bump the cab (bump)
And she stole, my cat (my cat)
She burnt down my flat (no way)
She went to the club and put her drinks on my tab
Now I'm vexed, I'm broke
But I'm not your average bloke (no way)
Went in her purse and placed a kilo of coke
And then I said, "Goodnight" (night)
Dialed 9-9-9 (brrt)
Police locked her up, gave her intent to supply (bye)
Two hours late for school, but you can't blame me (blame me)
Fried egg sandwich, white bread, bottle of HP (white bread, white bread)
Ask my cousin, "When you grow up, what'd you wanna be?" (What'd he say?)
He said a dealer 'cause he hates the police (okay)
On his birthday he went from eleven to thirteen (why?)
Because fuck twelve, he controls the streets (bow)

Who's that? What's that? (Brrt)
I don't know what I'm doing but I, text her WhatsApp (ching)
Telling her to come through and then I
Copped a Big Mac (L'cheim)
Milkshake and some large fries, it cost
Four pound fifty
Take the gherkin out of the inside (no gherkin)

Who's that? What's that? (Bow)
I don't know what I'm doing but I, text her WhatsApp (brrt)
Telling her to come through and then I
Copped a Big Mac (Big Mac)
Milkshake and some large fries, it cost
Four pounds fifty
Take the gherkin out of the inside

Fuck gherkins
Fuck gherkins
Fuck gherkins
McDonald's fuck your
Fuck your gherkins McDonald's
I've never, ever bought a burger
And not taken the gherkin out
You know what I'm sayin'?
