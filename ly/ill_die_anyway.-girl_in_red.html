		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I think back to when
Life was good, I was content
But it's been so many years
I can't remember how it feels

I reach for me but I'm not there
It's so lonely but who cares
It's fine, it's okay
I'll die anyway
I reach for me, but I'm not there
I always wonder why I'm here
It's fine, it's okay
I'll die anyway

I guess I could say
I've learned to live this way
But it's still hard to find
Reasons to stay alive

Accepting I'm pointless
Isn't the hardest
When it's so
Completely obvious
My questions are countless
Looking for answers
So far I'm clueless
Go back to sleep

I reach for me but I'm not there
It's so lonely but who cares
It's fine, it's okay
I'll die anyway
I reach for me but I'm not there
I always wonder why I'm here
It's fine, it's okay
I'll die anyway

I'll die anyway
I'll die anyway
I'll die anyway
I'll die anyway
