		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hair tie in your bathroom
You try to hide it but I see through
Stings like a tattoo
Can’t resist it I come back to you

Feels like I’m suffocating
‘Cause you’re having fun when you play me
Don’t think we can change this
‘Cause you’re addicted, and I’m breaking

You love to set me on fire
Burning through my skin but it’s time we cut ties
I guess that love makes you blind
But now it's over

So give me that gasoline
I can be all the things that you think are crazy
I’ll drag you down ‘cause baby
You’ve crossed the wrong one
Make you wish that you had never met me
So give me that gasoline

You mess me up till i’m crazy
‘Cause when we fight you leave
Tie me up with my heart strings
I can’t get enough, but can’t seem to breathe

You love to set me on fire
Burning through my skin now it’s time we cut ties
I guess that love makes you blind
But now it's over

So give me that gasoline
I can be all the things that you think are crazy
I’ll drag you down ‘cause baby
You’ve crossed the wrong one
Make you wish that you had never met me
So give me that gasoline

You love to set me on fire
Burning through my skin now it’s time we cut ties
I guess that love makes you blind
But now it's over

So give me that gasoline
I can be all the things that you think are crazy
I’ll drag you down ‘cause baby
You’ve crossed the wrong one
Make you wish that you had never met me
So give me that gasoline
