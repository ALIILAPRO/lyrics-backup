		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Calm, calm down
Let me hold you
Wanna calm, calm down
Let me hold you
Calm down, calm down (let me, let me, let me hold you)

Pull off and I almost hit him
He actin' like I ain't always with him
My heart sayin' I love him while I'm screamin' that I hate him
And ain't no more debatin', this time, it's a ultimatum
I never forgot where I was at the first day I met him
Yeah, it was love at first sight, but I ain't never sweat him
I knew if it was meant to be that one day I would let him
Twenty years later, them decisions, I don't regret them
Just wish you would give me space when I really need it
To be alone in my zone when I'm really heated
Just 'cause I am quiet, don't mean you're defeated
Wish you ain't need me to feel like you're completed
Don't wanna say somethin' mean when I don't mean it
Million missed calls, I don't wanna talk
Just did a detox, now I wanna spar

I wrote a line for you and it was beautiful
I made a sign for you to say you're beautiful
You're so, so irresistible
Take me to somewhere mystical
You're so
Do you know?
For you, I promise I'll try
For you, I promise I'll try
For you, I promise I'll try

Uh, havin' her ain't for the faint of heart
She bad as fuck but hard to deal with, and it ain't her fault
She got ambition like the niggas, and the vision for herself
So she can't rest until she feel like she done made her mark
So if you love her, then you gotta learn to play your part
Sometimes you gotta play the back
But when you do, make sure you play it smart
All these niggas want her, so they hatin' hard
They talkin' slick and make you wanna pull a rated-R
You like her, love her like a brother, like her manager, an A&R
Plus a therapist when it start rainin' hard
Her life was trauma-filled, it left her with a tainted heart
Yet you the nigga that she wanna tat her name across
But you need patience and a lot of extra faith in God
To keep the family together at a time when it's so regular to break apart
So God forbid, y'all got a kid, therefore, I hate the thought
It's you and her against the world until it ain't no more breath in your lungs
I'm just a messenger, but God is who this message is from
I wanna send you my respect because I rep for the ones
That hold they wifey down despite all of the extras that come
Word to Willy Smith, these silly niggas heckle and shun
As if they life is somehow perfect and they never been plunged
Into a dark place, so I can't respect when it's done
It's family first through the worst, comin' second to none, for real

I wrote a line for you and it was beautiful
I made a sign for you to say you're beautiful
You're so, so irresistible
Take me to somewhere mystical
You're so
For you, know
For you, I promise I'll try
