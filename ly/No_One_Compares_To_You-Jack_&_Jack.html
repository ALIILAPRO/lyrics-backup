		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Thoughts of you and me keep passing by
Like ships in the night, we never collide
Need you even after all this time
You can't be replaced even if I tried

I'm looking at her face but I'm seeing you
She's sleeping on your side, what can I do
We should be heart to heart, my mind is on you
I try, I really do

Every time I think I've found somebody
I just wish that somebody was you
There's no way that someone else could make me ever
Feel the same way that you do
No-one compares to you
(No-one compares to you)
(No-one compares to you)

Make it hard for me to love again
Oh, where do I start and when do you end?
Even if I tell myself I can
I know that I'll break before I can bend, yeah

I'm looking at her face but I'm seeing you (I'm seeing you)
She's sleeping on your side, what can I do (what can I do)
We should be heart to heart, my mind is on you
I try, I really do

Every time I think I've found somebody
I just wish that somebody was you
There's no way that someone else could make me ever
Feel the same way that you do
No-one compares to you
My heart
Nobody compares to you (No-one compares to you)
My heart (No-one compares to you)

Every time I think I've found somebody
I just wish that somebody was you
Ooh, there's no way that someone else could make me ever
Feel the same way that you do
No, no-one compares to you

Nobody, nobody, no
Nobody, no-one compares to you
Nobody, nobody, no
Nobody, no-one compares to you
