		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bitch, I'm really really out for blood this time, look (no, really)
Woo (man, what?)

I just came back for the win
Lot of new money in my hand
Go and tell a friend to tell a friend
They say success is the best revenge

Heard they was sleeping again, say it no more
This is a rude awakening, kick in the door
Back and I'm badder than ever before
Don't get it mistaken, I'm ready for war
I see the opps and I'm upping the score
I catch a body then jump in the Porsche
Follow the coroner back to the morgue
Take the sheet off and I kill 'em some more
When I am done at the scene, I won't leave anything
You won't even know who was involved
Don't let me do it, 'cause I over do it
And do it 'til I cannot do it no more

All of the doubters, I'm proving them wrong
Back with a classic, I know it's been long
Heard they was missing me while I was gone
I smell a victory, back up on top and it's where I belong
Like it ain't shit to me, we making history
Fought through the misery, weathered the storm
Can't let them get to me, no weapon formed
Shall prosper, R&B bitches all over my roster
Bitch, I got options, I keep a chopper (woo)
Right on the dresser next to the Oscar
Applying pressure, somebody stop us (woo)
Applying pressure, somebody stop us
Run in my casa, gon' need a doctor
Gon' need a doctor, gon' need a (what?)

I just came back for the win (man, what?)
Lotta new money in my hand
Go and tell a friend to tell a friend
They say success is the best revenge

I just came back for the win (yeah)
Lot of new money in my hand
Go and tell a friend to tell a friend
They say success is the best revenge (woo)

So now they on my body
Made it to the top, ain't no way that they could stop me now, now
They gon' say I joined the Illuminati
I got demons all around me, tell me what they know about me, ha (what?)

I just came back for the win
Lotta new money in my hand
Go and tell a friend to tell a friend
They say success is the best revenge (hands up)

I just came back for the win (yeah)
Lotta new money in my hand
Go and tell a friend to tell a friend
They say success is the best revenge
