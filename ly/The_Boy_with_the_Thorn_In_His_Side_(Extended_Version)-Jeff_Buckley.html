		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The boy with the thorn in his side
Behind the hatred there lies
A murderous desire for love, love
How can they look into my eyes
And still they don't believe me?
How can they hear me say those words
Still they don't believe me?
And if they don't believe me now
Will they ever believe me?
And if they don't believe me now
Will they ever, believe me?
Oh, oh, oh, oh

The boy with the thorn in his side
Behind the hatred there lies
A plundering desire for love
How can they look into our eyes
And still they don't believe us?
And after all this time
They don't want to believe us
And if they don't believe us now
Will they ever believe us?
And when you want to live
How do you start?
Where do you go?
Who do you need to know?

Oh
Oh no
Oh, oh oh
Oh, oh oh
Oh, oh oh
Le le le
Uh uh uh
Yeah yeah yeah
Oh yeah oh yeah
Uh uh uh
Oh the boy, the boy
The boy desire for love, love, love, love, love, oh yeah
Oh, oh
