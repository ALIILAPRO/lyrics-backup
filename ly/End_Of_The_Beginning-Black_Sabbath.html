		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Is this the end of the beginning?
Or the beginning of the end?
Losing control or are you winning?
Is your life real or just pretend?

Reanimation of the sequence
Rewinds the future to the past
To find the source of the solution
The system has to be repaired

Release your mind
Fast forward to the secrets of your soul
Your life's on overload
Is this your fate?

Will you decide what makes you an entity
That's your identity
Well if you don't know
Which way to go

You might be lost and confused
A second chance no time to lose

Reanimation of your cyber sonic soul
Transforming time and space beyond control
Rise up and resist to be the master of your fate
Don't look back before today- tomorrow is too late

You don't want to be a robot ghost
Occupied inside a human host
Analyzed and cloned relentlessly
Synthesized until they set you free

Alright-okay, alright
Till they set you free
Alright-okay
Till they set you free

I don't want to see you, yeah
I don't want to see you, yeah
