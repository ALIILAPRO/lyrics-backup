		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Was it just the simple feeling of fatigue?
Was was it something more than this?
Was it the feeling of emptiness inside?
I'll never know because the feeling
Was so quick to subside
Are the demons back and haunting me again?
Are the thoughts gonna be in and out my fucking head?
Am I just making a mountain of a molehill
Because I feel a little pressed?

I figure it's just me again
I guess I thought I was better than this
I'm tryna flick the switch in my head
Too scared to think too much, I confess
I've got an incredible life, I'm blessed
Put too much on my own plate, I'm stressed
I feel the heartbeat in my chest
So hard I'm struggling to hide it

Punching on my rib cage
Punching on my rib cage
Body structure set to break
Crushing my vertebrae
How much more of this pressure
Can I really fucking take?
Punching on my rib cage
Punching on my rib cage
Body structure set to break
Crushing my vertebrae
How much more of this pressure
Can I really fucking take?
