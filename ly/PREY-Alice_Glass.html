		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm fading fast
I'm fading fast
I wasn't prepared
It was always in front of me
It was always in front of me

Do you believe me?
Does it matter?
Am I a part of you if you don't?
Am I going to hell?
Does it matter?
If I don't exist here

Is this how it ends?
What was the point?
Is this how you imagined it?
Let me show you the way to hell

Why are you hurting me?
You stay away from me

I just want you to know
Stay afraid
Do I wish I was never born?
Afraid

Why are you hurting me?
