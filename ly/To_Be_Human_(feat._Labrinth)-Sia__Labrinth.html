		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Under rich, relentless skies
I've been setting highs
I felt you walk right through me
You're the thing that I invoke
My all persistent goal
Sent to make me queazy

And oh, it's hard now
With time, it works out

To be human is to love
Even when it gets too much
I'm not ready to give up
To be human is to love
Even when it gets too much
I'm not ready to give up

All the tigers have been out
I don't care, I hear them howl
I let them tear right through me
Can you help me not to care?
Every breath becomes a prayer
Take this pain from me

And oh, you're so far now
So far from my arms now

To be human is to love
Even when it gets too much
I'm not ready to give up
To be human is to love
Even when it gets too much
I'm not ready to give up
To be human
To be human
To be human

Just 'cause I predicted this
Doesn't make it any easier to live with
And what's the point of knowin' it
If you can't change it? You can't change, can't change it
Just 'cause I predicted this
Doesn't make it any easier to live with
And what's the point of knowin' it
If you can't change it? You can't change, can't change it

To be human is to love
Even when it gets too much
I'm not ready to give up
To be human is to love
Even when it gets too much
There's no reason to give up
 
Don't give up
Don't give up
