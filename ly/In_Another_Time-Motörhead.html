		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So, here we are in the years,
All the past is a dream,
Can't believe that I'm here,
Now, seems so hard to recall,
Did it happen that way, did it happen at all,
Here we are, win or lose, good and bad, fast and lose,
Here we are, black and gold, in another time.

Dust, on a mirror turned black,
The refection is flawed, all the mirrors are cracked,
Strange how the glass seems to sing,
But the words are like death, they could be anything,
Here we are, win or draw, badly used, badly scored,
Here we are, gone before, in another time.

Look through the eyes of the mask,
Tell me what do you see, can you make out the facts
Could in the arms of the dead,
I still hear them talk, telling jokes in my head,
Here we are before the dawn, cold and black, death and scorn,
Here they are, lust and grief, to oversee the crime,
In the days before the plague, never spoke, eyes like blades,
Here and now, fear and grief, in another time
