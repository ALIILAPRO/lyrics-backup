		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Am I the Antichrist?
How do I sleep at night?
Just need to escape my mind
I guess it figures

I wanna fix you, honey
I wanna keep you closer
But with all of my toxicity
You get a little too much exposure
I'll be the first to admit
I kind of fucked this darling
Didn't I?

Did I use your body?
Did I leave you broken?
You know it didn't take much to break your trust
The dice was loaded
So, come on, give me hell
'Cause heaven knows I deserve it
It chills my bones to know you're suffering

Am I the Antichrist?
How do I sleep at night?
Just need to escape my mind
I guess it figures

'Cause I gave you bad love only
Gave you bad love only
I made a real mess of this, honey
So you should run for your life
I gave you bad love, bad love, bad love

So you say we should talk in the morning
Tape up the cracks in the porcelain
When we met, you were delicate
Should have handled with care, you were rare, my darling
So let me make this clear
I'm the only problem here
I'm the problem

Am I the Antichrist?
How do I sleep at night?
Just need to escape my mind
I guess it figures

'Cause I gave you bad love only
Gave you bad love only
I made a real mess of this, honey
So you should run for your life
I gave you bad love, bad love, bad love

'Cause I gave you bad love only
Gave you bad love only
Gave you bad love only
Gave you bad love only
