		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Your feet are on the dashboard
My eyes on the road
I always knew I’d get here
I just thought I’d be alone
Trees tie the skyline
The sun is on the run
There’s no turning back now
This love has just begun

I’ve never, no I’ve never been
So sure of anything

(But) when you’re sleeping on my shoulder
Dancing in a dream
It feels like getting older
Ain’t as scary as it seemed
When you’re sleeping on my shoulder
Dancing in a dream
It feels like getting older
With you is what I need

We’re going somewhere slowly
Selling something sweet
Goodbye to the lonely
The pleasure was mine to meet

I’ve never, no I’ve never been
So sure of settling

(But) when you’re sleeping on my shoulder
Dancing in a dream
It feels like getting older
Ain’t as scary as it seemed
When you’re sleeping on my shoulder
Dancing in a dream
It feels like getting older
With you is what I need
