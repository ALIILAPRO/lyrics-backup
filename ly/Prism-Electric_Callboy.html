		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You are so special but so insecure
With all of the struggles you had to endure
You are a light caught in a prism
All of your dreams you have buried inside
Are just a flame that you need to ignite
Wait for the light that hits your prism

'Cause you know before you rise you need to fall
Before you rise you see it all
And nothing will be holding you down
Stop trying to fit into the masses
The time is now so take your chances
You're exceptional, exceptional

You are so special and now you're so pure
Below your surface you found so much more
Now you're the light inside the prism
Pass on this world, build a new on your own
Facing the edge, push yourself far beyond cause
Now you're the light inside the prism
(Now you're the light inside the prism)

'Cause you know before you rise you need to fall
Before you rise you see it all
And nothing will be holding you down
Stop trying to fit into the masses
The time is now so take your chances
You're exceptional, exceptional

And now you know, now you know that you will never back down
Don't become your own biggest enemy
Cure the sickness, you are the remedy
And now you know, now you know that you will never back down
Don't become your own biggest enemy
Cure the sickness, you are the remedy

'Cause you know before you rise you need to fall
Before you rise you see it all
And nothing will be holding you down
Stop trying to fit into the masses
The time is now so take your chances
You're exceptional, exceptional

Exceptional, exceptional
