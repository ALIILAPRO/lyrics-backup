Hello, depression
I hear your message
Still don't understand (oh)
I know we're hurting
Drugging and doping
Death by our own hands (oh)

I'm sorry that I couldn't be the one
'Cause we can't run
The end has come (oh)
I'm sorry that I couldn't be the one
'Cause we can't run
The end has come (oh)

Hello, my mental
You think I should but
I can't read your mind (oh)
Admit we fuck up
Our wounds are healing
Some can't heal with time (oh)

I'm sorry that I couldn't be the one
'Cause we can't run
The end has come (oh)
I'm sorry that I couldn't be the one
'Cause we can't run
The end has come (oh)

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
