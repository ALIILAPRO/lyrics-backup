		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm your wicked Uncle Ernie
I'm glad you won't see or hear me
As I fiddle about
Fiddle about
Fiddle about!

Your mother left me here to mind you
Now I'm doing what I want to
Fiddling about
Fiddling about
Fiddle about!
 
Down with the bedclothes
Up with your nightshirt!
Fiddle about
Fiddle about
Fiddle about!

Fiddle about
Fiddle about
Fiddle about!

You won't shout as I fiddle about
Fiddle about
Fiddle about
Fiddle about!

Fiddle about
Fiddle about
Fiddle about!

Fiddle about
Fiddle about
Fiddle about!

Fiddle about
Fiddle about
Fiddle about!

Fiddle, fiddle, fiddle
Fiddle, fiddle, fiddle
Fiddle, fiddle, fiddle
Fiddle, fiddle, fiddle
Fiddle
