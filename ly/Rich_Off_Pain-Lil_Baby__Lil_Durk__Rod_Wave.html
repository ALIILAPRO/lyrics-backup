		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Pipe that shit up TnT)
Nigga came from nothin', but still they gon' hate
Whole life left me scarred, only the real can relate, yeah
Yeah, rich off pain
Look

Nigga came from nothin', but still they gon' hate (yeah)
Whole life left me scarred, only the real can relate
And I come straight out them trenches, in the field everyday
Young nigga out that bottom, use my tears to motivate
And so much came, with this money and this fame
But I can't complain (yeah)
I came from walkin' through the rain, prayed for better days
And now a nigga rich off pain
Now a nigga rich off pain (yeah), rich off pain, (a nigga) rich off pain
Now a nigga rich off pain, rich off pain, (a nigga) rich off pain
Rich off pain, rich off pain, rich off pain
A nigga rich off pain, you know what I'm sayin'?
(Young nigga rich off pain, young nigga rich off pain, yeah)

Young nigga, I was tryna get my money right (get my money right)
Mama support the crib with my granny, daddy servin' life (yeah, yeah)
Breakin' in my auntie room 'fore school, I used a butter knife (butter knife)
Teacher bitchin' at me, like her husband can't be fuckin' right (can't be fuckin' right)
Wild niggas slidin' 'round in Tracks and SRTs (SRTs)
We stealin' packs from the older cats to buy the new Jordan 3s (new Jordan 3s)
I know a million niggas who millionaires off PPP's (PPP's)
That's how we got the address to the old PP's
We hit stains to make it out the hood, well that's what we thought
Rob, kill, or scam, but never gon' get caught, that's just what we taught
No fist fight, but first degree murders, that's just what we fought
Gotti told us to never forget your dawg and that's law
I got blamed for niggas dyin', I wonder why
They say I sacrificed to be in this position, that's a lie
See the blogs can't break me down, see I'm the voice, I don't reply
But the rumors y'all done heard, I'm a humble, plead the ninth, yeah

Nigga came from nothin', but still they gon' hate (yeah)
Whole life left me scarred, only the real can relate
And I come straight out them trenches, in the field everyday
Young nigga out that bottom, use my tears to motivate
And so much came, with this money and this fame
But I can't complain (yeah)
I came from walkin' through the rain, prayed for better days
And now a nigga rich off pain
Now a nigga rich off pain (yeah), rich off pain, (a nigga) rich off pain
Now a nigga rich off pain, rich off pain, (a nigga) rich off pain
Rich off pain, rich off pain, rich off pain
A nigga rich off pain, you know what I'm sayin'?

(Yeah, Baby)
I take everything I go through and I put it in these songs
I ain't gon' never go against you, please correct me if I'm wrong
Amounted to what I show for, she will never know what I'm on
And you can say whatever you want to, but you gon' miss me when I'm gone
I be everywhere with it on, Free done run it up off of drone
Ain't nan one of us get the loan, ain't ever fell off, I went broke before
Damn, that shit be crazy, real niggas die for somethin' a ho done told you
Take whatever come with it, I don't show no emotion
I'm back in that mode, bruh
I get impatient, I'm 'bout that money, what's the hold up?
I gotta do this shit for my kids, now they growin' up
Win, lose or drop, but no matter what, it ain't no ho in us
Lookin' at the phone, I saw you callin'
I am way too far to turn back now, that's why I'm all in
I know it get rough, but you stay tough and keep shit solid
The Brabus truck got G800 on the back and it got stars in it
I'm just tryna show my young niggas they can ball too
Any time I ever hit her up, she know to fall through
I done ran up millions off this pain shit
I don't like to deal with her too much 'cause it's the same shit
(Uh, yeah-yeah)
