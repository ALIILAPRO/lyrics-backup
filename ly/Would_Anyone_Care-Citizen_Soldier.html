		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Would anyone notice
If tonight I disappeared?
Would anyone chase me
And say the words that I need to hear?

That I'm no burden
Not so worthless
Bent so much that I just might break
All-consuming
So confusing
The questions that keep me awake

Would anyone care, would anyone cry
If I finally stepped off of this ledge tonight?
Would anything change, would you all be just fine?
'Cause I need a reason to not throw the fight
It just might save my life

Would anyone want me
If they knew what was inside my head?
Would anyone see me
For the person that I really am?

I won't lie
So hard to hide
I've never felt worthy of love
I would give up
Everything I have
Just to feel good enough

Would anyone care, would anyone cry
If I finally stepped off of this ledge tonight?
Would anything change, would you all be just fine?
'Cause I need a reason to not throw the fight
It just might save my life

If you're dying inside
Sick of being alive
Let me in, let me share in your pain
From my lungs through the dark
Spoken straight from the heart
Let me give you a reason to stay

If you're out there still lying awake
If you're out there still wondering

Would anyone care, would anyone cry
If you finally gave up and turned out the light?
The world would be changed if you left it behind
You can't be replaced, no, tonight is the night
You take back your life
Take back your life
Take back your life
Take back your life
