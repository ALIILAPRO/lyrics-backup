		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Down south 
Hood baby 

Make all the boys go crazy 

Look up down to the side 
Wok got me feeling lil lazy 

Shuffle 
Shuffle 

Flex one hand show the muscle 

Bring it round town 
Hit it out the park 
2 Hands on her mouth like a muzzle 

2 Hands on her mouth like a muzzle 
Found all the pieces to the puzzle 
Niggas think it's nothing 
Niggas think it's easy 
They don't really know about the hustle 

Henny Dusse 1942
Now she wanna do more than cuddle 
She want me to pull up just fuck her 
Spend a few hundred on bundles 

She gon spend some time with me and some of the bros 
Then we give her back 
Sike we don't even give her back 
We ain't even really getting into that 

Tax a verse for a nigga then tell my label don't even go clear da track 
I fuck her good knock her out of the park now when she come she gon feel the bat 

Down south 
Hood baby 

Make all the boys go crazy 

Look up down to the side 
Wok got me feeling lil lazy 

Shuffle 
Shuffle 

Flex one hand show the muscle 

Bring it round town 
Hit it out the park 
2 Hands on her mouth like a muzzle 

Down south 
Hood baby 

Make all the boys go crazy 

Look up down to the side 
Wok got me feeling lil lazy 

Shuffle 
Shuffle 

Flex one hand show the muscle 

Bring it round town 
Hit it out the park 
2 Hands on her mouth like a muzzle 

(Like a muzzle!)
