		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wouldn't doubt I hadn't had enough thought.
It turned to midnight with headphones on.
I can't pretend I didn't know when.
But then the night came and you were gone.
You were gone.
You were gone.
Wouldn't it be so strange not to be with you on your birthday?
Could it ever feel okay not to be with you on your birthday?
I wouldn't doubt. I hadn't had enough thought.
It turned to midnight in my car.
And I can't pretend I didn't have heart...
there's a dog in the yard and it's not ours.
A dog in the yard, and it's not ours.
A dog in the yard and it's not us.
Wouldn't it be so strange not to be with you on your birthday?
Could it ever feel okay not to be with you on your birthday?
