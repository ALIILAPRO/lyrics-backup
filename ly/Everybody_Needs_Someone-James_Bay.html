		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We're stayin' up, we're gonna watch the sun come out
Everyone's here, the silver's slippin' through the clouds
I pull this moment close
Is that me runnin' out of hope?

I'm holdin' on to patience, undefined
We're a world of strangers chasin' signs
Hear this complicated heart of mine

Oh, all I want
Is someone when the night is long
Half a lonely soul to make me whole
'Cause everybody needs someone

That's it all it takes, a simple little twist of fate
A little spark, some strength to keep your heart from breakin'
When you get so close
'Cause breakin' comes and breakin' goes

I'm holdin' on to patience, losin' time
We're a world of strangers, chasin' signs
Hear this complicated heart of mine, whoa

Whoa, all I want
Is someone when the night is long
Half a lonely soul to make me whole
'Cause everybody needs someone
Whoa, all I want
Is someone when the crowd is gone
To see that I'm alone, to take me home
'Cause everybody needs someone

Yeah, we all need somebody
Yeah, I got you if you got me
Yeah, we all need somebody
Yeah, I got you if you got me
Yeah, we all need somebody

All I want
Is someone when the night is long
Half a lonely soul to make me whole
'Cause everybody needs someone
Oh, all I want
Is someone when the crowd is gone
To see that I'm alone, to take me home
'Cause everybody needs someone

All I want
Is someone when the night is long
Half a lonely soul to make me whole
'Cause everybody needs someone
We all need someone
