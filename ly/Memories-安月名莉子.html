		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Memories
We made a small base on the grass
Memories
We drew some pictures of mountains and flowers
I felt like time flied when it was beautiful

Memories
We walked around singing a song
Memories
A quiet talk made us know each other
You might know what I thought

Sometimes destiny is cruel and cold
But I wish I could be with you forever

Hi, you
Let's smile like the sun
And sing like a bird
And walk like a cloud
All of you will be memories
And I want to remember to the end of time

Memories
We made a promise to come back
Memories
I have been waiting for you ever since
On this wonderful day
I wish you stayed alive

Even if the sun never rises
Even if the birds disappear
Even if the sky is covered with the black clouds
We would solve all

Hi, you
Let's smile like the sun
And sing like a bird
And walk like a cloud
All of you will be memories
And I want to remember to the end of time

All of you will be memories
And I want to remember to the end of time

Memories
We were just friends without a doubt
Would you forgive me for my selfishness?
Oh, let's meet here again
