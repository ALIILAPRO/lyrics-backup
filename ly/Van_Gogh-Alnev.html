		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I guess it's time the canvas hung
And I accept the crimes I've done
For one more step into the sand
Will sink me further
And I cannot
Am I the man I think I am?
The crown can't bear the weight of my head
If I had spoken sooner
Would my words be worth their truth?
If chaos was a lifestyle
I'd be on the cover of every Forbes magazine
If dying was an artform
Could I be your Van Gogh?
Pretty please
I grew up with brittle walls
Now they're painted in my blood
And when I thought I found myself
Turns out I'd outgrown your love
Now you're banging down my door
If I'm worth nothing
Then what are you even banging for?
And I can't say I'm finally done
'Til the bullet's in my gut
Am I the man I think I am?
The crown can't bear the weight of my head
If I had spoken sooner
Would the truth be worth my words?
If chaos was a lifestyle
I'd be on the cover of every Forbes magazine
If dying was an artform
Could I be your Van Gogh?
Pretty please
A young artist, born a fool
He fell in love with his tools
Abandoned home and ran away
But he could never leave his cage
An old man who once painted art
But now he thinks about lost love
He buried his work under his grave
But he could never leave his cage
If chaos was a lifestyle
I'd be on the cover of every Forbes magazine
If dying was an art form
Could I be your Van Gogh?
Pretty please
Could I be your Van Gogh?
Could I be your Van Gogh, pretty please?
Could I be your Van Gogh?
Could I be your Van Gogh, pretty please?
