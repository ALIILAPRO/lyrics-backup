		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There you go caught you crashin' my dreams again
Just when I'm trying to get over you
I tell my heart but I can't seem to comprehend
A day without you

Now you've carved out a life
But I wear the scars
Reminding me by the hour
That it's time to accept that's the way the things are
I wish I could but

I can't imagine it any other way
A world without you is only wasted space
You're gone and I'll always wonder
Why it can't be any other way?
Any other way

Since you drained all the color out of the sky
How am I supposed to feel?
It's like I'm livin' in somebody else's life
Tell me it's not real

I can't imagine it any other way
A world without you is only wasted space
You're gone and I'll always wonder
Why it can't be any other way?
Any other way

I can't imagine it any other way
A world without you is only wasted space
You're gone and I'll always wonder
Why it can't be any other way?
Any other way

Like we never had a falling out
Like the tears had never hit the ground
Like you're still here
You're still here

Since you drained all the color out of the sky

I can't imagine it any other way
A world without you is only wasted space
You're gone and I'll always wonder
Why it can't be any other way?
Any other way

I can't imagine it any other way
A world without you is only wasted space
You're gone and I'll always wonder
Why it can't be any other way?
Any other way
