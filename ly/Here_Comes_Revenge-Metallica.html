		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Little grave I'm grieving, I will mend you
Sweet revenge I'm dreaming, I will end you
I've been here since dawn of time
Countless hatreds built my shrine
I was born in anger's flame
He was Abel, I was Cain
I am here, I'm hell unbound
Burn your kingdom to the ground, to the ground

Here comes revenge, just for you
Revenge, you can't undo
Revenge, it's killing me
Revenge, set me free

Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth
A life for a life, it's my burden of proof

Revenge, just for you
Revenge
You ask forgiveness, I give you sweet revenge

I return this nightmare, I will find you
Sleepless, cloaked in despair, I'm behind you
Man has made me oh, so strong
Blurring lines of right and wrong
Far too late for frail amends
Now it's come to sweet revenge
Desperate hands that lose control
Have no mercy on your soul, on your soul

Here comes revenge, just for you
Revenge, you can't undo
Revenge, it's killing me
Revenge, set me free

Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth
A life for a life, it's my burden of proof

Revenge, just for you
Revenge
You ask forgiveness, I give you sweet revenge

Here comes revenge, just for you
Revenge, you can't undo
Revenge, it's killing me
Revenge, set me free

Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth
A life for a life, it's my burden of proof

Revenge, just for you
Revenge
You ask forgiveness, I give you sweet revenge
Sweet revenge
