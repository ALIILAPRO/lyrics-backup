		  Got a good reason
For taking the easy way out
Got a good reason
For taking the easy way out now
She was a day tripper
A one way ticket, yeah
It took me so long to find out
And I found out

She's a big teaser
She took me half the way there
She's a big teaser
She took me half the way there, now
She was a day tripper
One way ticket, yeah
It took me so long to find out
And I found out

Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

Tried to please her
She only played one night stands
Tried to please her
She only played one night stands, now
She was a day tripper
Sunday driver, yeah
It took me so long to find out
And I found out

Day tripper, yeah
Day tripper, yeah
Day tripper
Day tripper, yeah
Day tripper
