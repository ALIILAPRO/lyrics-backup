		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (CHORUS)
Ooh ooh girl be careful with the boys
Yeah be careful with the boys
'cause they're more than just your toys
Ooh ooh girl be careful with the boys
Didn't mama teach ya that
They'll be coming back yeah

(Ooh) You're a girl who can turn the head on every guy
You go by (cos you're fly)
You ever wondered why, everything in your life
Happens as you like, it's 'cause you know how to smile
Make it worth your while

(And ya better listen up now)

REPEAT CHORUS

Guys may be nice when you let
Them feast their hungry eyes
On your cute little thighs (little thighs)
But honey watch your back
Don't ya know what they say (say)
If ya turn them away, it won't be pretty
If a mate shouldn't fail to say (fail to say)

(So ya better listen up now)

REPEAT CHORUS

(BRIDGE)
For every heart that you break
You pay some price
No matter how hard you try
They'll bring you down

Cool, you're just so cool
And tonight you, won't be alone (cool)
Cool (cool), you're just so cool (yeah you're just so cool)
And I'm sure you're aware
'cause you feel my stare

REPEAT CHORUS

REPEAT BRIDGE

Ooh ooh girl, ooh ooh girl, you pay some price

Ooh ooh girl, ooh ooh girl, they'll bring you down
