		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh my darling
Can we just get home?
I hate this feeling
Can I just hold you?

“Too good to be true,” they told you
They spoke too soon
I know in my heart we’ll get through 
oh we need to

So babe, wait, how could we leave this alone?
We’re worth too much to just let it go
Oh my God, I wish I could make this not hurt
But don’t be scared we’re falling in place
So wait

Why try to hide when our cover’s see-through?
Not much to say but that “I love you”

“Too good to be true,” they told you
They spoke too soon
I know in my heart we’ll get through 
oh we need to

So babe, wait, how could we leave this alone?
We’re worth too much to just let it go
Oh my God, I wish I could make this not hurt
But don’t be scared we’re falling in place
So wait

Oh so wait
Oh so wait
Oh so wait
So wait

Oh my darling
Can we just get home?
