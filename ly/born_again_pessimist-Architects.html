		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I took an easy ride
So the world could pretend that I'm superior (pretend that I'm superior)
You'd have an honest man
If you took the time to wire up my jaw (wire up my jaw)
I fell asleep in the backseat
Fuck, it was so sweet
I ran a red like I saw a matador, yeah
The sun might melt
Whilst you wait for my arteries to thaw (my arteries to thaw)
I'm taking you to war
I'm taking you to war

I'm never gonna spill my guts
It feels like death by a thousand cuts
So when the here and now holds me down
I fall apart
I don't wanna talk too much
I'm never gonna stop yeah, I love this crutch
So if I kiss the ground, don't look 'round
God bless my big empty heart

I'll only lose my head if I stand too close to hysteria
And if it took your breath
Then I'm betting that I focused on the flaw
So go and set me in concrete, I'm just a deadbeat
You always said I'm the wolf that's at your door
I would drown myself
But the thirst would have me coming back for more

I'm never gonna spill my guts
It feels like death by a thousand cuts
So when the here and now holds me down
I fall apart
I don't wanna talk too much
I'm never gonna stop yeah, I love this crutch
So if I kiss the ground, don't look 'round
God bless my big empty heart
God bless my big empty heart

I'm just a born again pessimist
I'll only kick you from the precipice
Come follow me, we'll march on heaven's gates

I'm never gonna spill my guts
It feels like death by a thousand cuts
So when the here and now holds me down
I fall apart
I don't wanna talk too much
I'm never gonna stop yeah, I love this crutch
So if I kiss the ground, don't look 'round
God bless my big empty heart

My big empty heart
My big empty heart
My big empty heart
God bless my big empty heart
