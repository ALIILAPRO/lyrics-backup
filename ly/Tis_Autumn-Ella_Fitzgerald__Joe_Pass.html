		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Old Father Time checked so there'd be no doubt
Called on the north wind to come on out
Then cupped his hands so proudly to shout
"La-de-da de-la-de-dum, 'tis autumn"

The trees say they're tired they bore too much fruit
Charmed all the wayside there's no dispute
Now shedding leaves they don't give a hoot
La-de-da de-la-de-dum, 'tis autumn

Then the birds got together
To chirp about the weather

After makin' their decision
In birdie-like precision
Turned about and made a bee-line to the south

My holding you close is really no crime
Ask the birds the trees and Old Father Time
It's just to help the mercury climb
La-de-da de-la-de-dum, 'tis autumn

Then the birds got together
To chirp about the weather

After makin' their decision
In birdie-like precision
Turned about and made a bee-line to the south

My holding you close is really no crime
Ask the birds the trees and old Father Time
It's just to help the mercury climb
La-de-da de-la-de-dum
La-de-da de-la-de-dum
La-de-da de-la-de-dum, 'tis autumn
