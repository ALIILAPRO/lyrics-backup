		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  By the grave I saw you weep
Satisfaction sinks
There's closure in the hole you dug
It's barely out of reach

You buried me too deep
But I found the strength to finally leave
So bury me, forget it all
Forget it all

My skeleton lay dormant
In the bottom of your heart
It could not replace regret
We will never be

A part of me is always with you
With you

With you

I fall victim to your hand
I have broken the laws of God
I am stuck inside your head
And I hope it fucking kills you
(That I'm gone)

By the grave

And things will never be the same
This will never fucking end
Bury me, forget it all
