		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sailing down, down the Styx again,
Without you my love, I want to return but then,
I see all my friends, they want me to join but then,
They all melt away, without you alone.

And the river's running through my veins.
Lately she don't seem the same.
And the blood keeps calling out my name.

I pass by the sins, left by a different man,
The tides brought them here, cast by a different hand.
And the wisps of the winds, blow with the Styx again.
Pushing me on, without you alone.

And the river's running through my veins.
Lately she don't seem the same.
And the blood keeps calling out my name.

And the river running down
And the river running down
And the river running down
And the river

My will must be strong, to rise with a different light.
My will must belong, I'm still pushing for different heights.
And the wisps of the winds blow with the Styx again.
The river runs red, and I'm left alone.

And the river's running through my veins.
Lately she don't seem the same.
And the blood keeps calling out my name.
And the river's running.

Help me baby
