		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Started as friends but it got kinda complicated
You knew that you didn't want more but you'd never say it
Out loud
Maybe I didn't read through all your lines
We started as friends but we're just strangers tonight
And when I think about you it still hurts
My heart still has scars
I need to learn
It was only temporary
But I guess our feelings were good for a while
Now you're just a memory
A story that I'll never tell
'Cause our worlds just didn't collide
You had yours and I had mine
Got lost in different directions
But being with you was my
Favorite lesson
Used to dream about growing a future but we grew apart
I lie to myself 'cause the truth hurts
Don't know where you are
Right now
And when I think about you it still hurts
My heart still has scars
I need to learn
It was only temporary
But I guess our feelings were good for a while
Now you're just a memory
A story that I'll never tell
'Cause our worlds just didn't collide
You had yours and I had mine
Got lost in different directions
But being with you was my
Favorite
Lesson
Lesson
Started as friends but it got kinda complicated
But being with you was my
Favorite lesson
