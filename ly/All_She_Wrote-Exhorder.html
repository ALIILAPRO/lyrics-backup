		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Line up for the execution, signed up suicide
Hordes of demons pleased with what they see
Barbs on the tentacles that keep the uprise down
Strength is the absence of all quit
Remember that they showed no mercy here, and that’s all she wrote

Feed strength
Weed out cowards
Protect the stone
Never forget that they’ll leave you for dead, and now that’s all she wrote

Gather up the ones worth arming, take the stations firm
Constitution brings us with no fear
Selective memory shall teach us wrong from right
Faith is our food in desperate times
So many have to die before your right to cast your vote

Feed strength
Weed out cowards
Protect the stone
Never forget that they’ll leave you for dead, and now that’s all she wrote

Sweep to flank the enemy, attacking from all sides
Keep them faceless, nameless as your prey
Closed in and suffocating, meet the uprise now
Prevailing for the ones yet born
They won’t forget you showed no mercy here, and that’s all she wrote

Feed strength
Weed out cowards
Protect the stone
Never forget that they’ll leave you for dead, and now that’s all she wrote

No mercy, that’s all she wrote
