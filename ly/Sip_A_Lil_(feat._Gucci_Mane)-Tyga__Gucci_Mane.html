Tyga, Wop, argh
Ooh, bagging on the track, bitch

Baby, when I sip a little, I miss you a little
Baby, when I sip a little more, I miss you a little more (Wop)
Baby, when I sip a little, I miss you a littlw
Baby, when I sip a little more, I miss you a little more

Baby, when the lights are low and the night is warm
You like it slow, I used to rush to you
Baby, when the rain pours down
Reminds me of touching you

Baby, when I'm up and the pill hit
I start to feel shit, shit I used to feel when you still hit
Sometimes I roll over like you still there
I been rolling for a week and I'm still lit
Got a baby for my body high, baby for my head high
Got a little baby for my bedtime
Got a little baby come through in the AM for the cereal
My boutique little baby got more poochie than a milli though
No, no, I don't think they feel me though
Looking in the mirror, I'm a miracle
You know when I sip a little, I might send a missile
Hit you with that tongue emoji, wanna lick that
I be on a mission, yeah, i know you see the vision, yeah
Still wanna see me, got me feeling like I need you when

When I sip a little, I miss you a little
Baby, when I sip a little more, I miss you a little more (Wop)
Baby, when I sip a little, I miss you a little
Baby, when I sip a little more, I miss you a little more (go, go, go)

Baby, when the lights are low and the night is warm
You like it slow, I used to rush to you
Baby, when the rain pours down
Reminds me of touching you (Wop)

She just wants some closure, my thing out is suicidal
I bet she hear this song and think of Guwop back inside her
Drop top with my top open, her heart broken, I'm liable
My ambition as a rider, is all about survival
Glacier blue McLaren and I drive it like MacGyver
Got so many Birkin bags, that bitch can't make her mind up
I'm the owner but I coach and play, I just might change the line up
Baddy wanna be what Gucci gave her, I won't let him sign up
Bigger, bigger diamonds got 'em lost in the sauce
Yeah, you crossed the line like the stones in the cross
I was on the boss, now I'm boss of the boss
And I just crack a smile 'cause you done, stick a fork

Baby, when I sip a little, I miss you a little
Baby, when I sip a little more, I miss you a little more
Baby, when I sip a little, I miss you a little
Baby, when I sip a little more, I miss you a little more

And the vibe don't lie, I hear what you saying
But the vide don't lie, I'm where you wanna be laying at
Who you playing with? I'm not a toy thing
I'm a man, I'm not your boyfriend, I boost off the poison
Sip a little, mix a little, twist a little, kiss a little
We lick a little, just a little but this ain't little, this ain't little
I was tryna call you
All summer, tryna fall through, I hit you like where are you?

When I sip a little, I miss you a little
Baby, when I sip a little more, I miss you a little more
Baby, when I sip a little, I miss you a little
Baby, when I sip a little more, I miss you a little more
