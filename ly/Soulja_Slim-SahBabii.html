		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I feel like Soulja Slim out of the Nolia (Nolia)
Twenty-four shots, we gon' post up like Kobe (Kobe)
Twenty-four thots, we gon' fuck on these hoes (hoes, hoes), yeah
Got a lot of demons? Bitch, it's no problemo (problemo)
Bitch, these sticks long, I think we need a limo (a limo)

I'ma lay on his ass from my fake page (fake page)
Slide his ass up, this a snake pit (snake pit)
This a cold world, bitch, ice age (ice age)
You can't think with your dick, that is not safe (not safe)
Who surviving longer? Bitch, I know how to play (know how to play)
Yeah, draw on a nigga, bitch, I know how to trace (know how to trace), yeah (yeah)
I'ma get him regardless, I don't gotta know where he stay
If they deep, we gon' air out the parade (ayy)
I'm guessin' they move, a nigga play charades, ayy (ayy)
Turn they watermelon to purée, ayy (purée)
I just got a new juicy, Venmo activate
Keep my name out your dick-suckers
I don't talk a lot, why your bitch love me
I get in my bag, get big lucky
She gon' do what I say like a real puppy (real puppy)
Drop the top on the coupe, bitch, I'm real clumsy (real clmusy)

I feel like Soulja Slim out of the Nolia (Nolia)
Twenty-four shots, we gon' post up like Kobe (Kobe)
Twenty-four thots, we gon' fuck on these hoes (hoes, hoes), yeah
Got a lot of demons? Bitch, it's no problemo (problemo)
Bitch, these sticks long, I think we need a limo (a limo)

I got the pipe out a pipe, if a nigga get piped 
We gon' see if he aight (see if he aight)
If I put cheese on my fries 
I put cheese on your guys just to see if they bite (see if they bite)
These niggas'll never be real, they a crew full of dykes 
They don't know what it's like (know what it's like)
And if they took away guns, these niggas wouldn't fight (yeah)
They'd go grab a knife (grab a knife, yeah)
I don't play 'bout my racks, I'ma let off some rounds 'fore my rounds (baow, baow, baow)
If a nigga talk crazy, he pay for them sounds (yeah)
Like a lockdown defender, we gon' shut him down (we gon' shit him down)
I can't freeze up on my life goals (life goals, yeah)
Keep the fire 'round when the ice on (ice on, yeah)

I feel like Soulja Slim out of the Nolia (Nolia)
Twenty-four shots, we gon' post up like Kobe (Kobe)
Twenty-four thots, we gon' fuck on these hoes (hoes, hoes), yeah
Got a lot of demons? Bitch, it's no problemo (problemo)
Bitch, these sticks long, I think we need a limo (a limo)
