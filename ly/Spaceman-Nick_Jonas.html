		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Houston, think we got some problems
Find somebody who can solve 'em
I feel like a spaceman
I feel like a spaceman
TV tells me what to think
Bad news, maybe I should drink
'Cause I feel like a spaceman
I feel like a spaceman

They say it's a phase it'll change if we vote
And I pray that it will, but I know that it won't
I'm a spaceman
Yeah, I'm a spaceman
And the numbers are high, but we keep going down
'Cause we ain't supposed to live with nobody around
I'm a spaceman
I'm a spaceman

And I'm talking to you
But it never feels like it comes through
Out on my own
I'm a spaceman
Yeah, yeah, I'm a spaceman
From the dark side of the moon
I know that it's sad, but it's true
I'm tryna get home
I'm a spaceman
Yeah, yeah, I'm a spaceman
Out on my own

Mask off minute I get home
All safe now that I'm alone
Almost like a spaceman
I feel like a spaceman
Keep on thinking that we're close
No drugs, still an overdose
I'm in outer space, man
I feel like a spaceman

And I'm talking to you
But it never feels like it comes through
Out on my own
I'm a spaceman
Yeah, yeah, I'm a spaceman
From the dark side of the moon
I know that it's sad, but it's true
I'm tryna get home
I'm a spaceman
Yeah, yeah, I'm a spaceman
Out on my own

Hard times make you love the view
Right now I think I'm getting through
Only way that I can
But I feel like a spaceman

And I'm talking to you
But it never feels like it comes through
Out on my own
I'm a spaceman
Yeah, yeah, I'm a spaceman
From the dark side of the moon
I know that it's sad, but it's true
I'm tryna get home
I'm a spaceman
Yeah, yeah, I'm a spaceman
Out on my own

Don't wanna be alone
Don't wanna be
Don't wanna be out on my own
Don't wanna be alone
Don't wanna be
Don't wanna be out on my own

I'm a spaceman
I'm a spaceman
