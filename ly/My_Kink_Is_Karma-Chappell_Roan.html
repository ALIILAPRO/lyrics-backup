		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We broke up on a Tuesday
Kicked me out with the rent paid
Ruined my credit, stole my cute aesthetic
Who knew that we'd let it
Get this bad when it ended

It's comical, bridges you burn
Karma's wheel, hope it's your turn
I heard from Katie
You're losing it lately
Moved back with your parents
And date girls who were eighteen

It's hard when you have a meltdown
In the front of your house 
And you're getting kicked out
It's hard when you're drinking downtown
And you're getting called out 
'Cause you're running your mouth
Oh, God
And it's coming around 
Yeah, it's coming around 
Yeah, it's coming around
Oh, God, oh, God
People say I'm jealous but my kink is watching

You ruin your life
You losing your mind
You dyeing your hair
People say I'm jealous but my kink is watching
You crashing your car
You breaking your heart
You thinking I care
People say I'm jealous but my kink is karma

Wishing you the best, in the worst way
Using your distress as foreplay
Six months since April and I'm doing better
No need to be hateful in your fake Gucci sweater

But it's hard when you have a meltdown
In the front of your house 
And you're getting kicked out
It's hard when you're drinking downtown
And you're getting called out 
'Cause you're running your mouth
Oh, God
And it's coming around 
Yeah, it's coming around 
Yeah, it's coming around
Oh, God, oh, God
People say I'm jealous but my kink is watching

You ruin your life
You losing your mind
You dyeing your hair
People say I'm jealous but my kink is watching
You crashing your car
You breaking your heart
You thinking I care
People say I'm jealous but my kink is karma

It's hard when you're going through hell
And you're hating yourself, I'm feeling myself
It's hard when you know that you're caught
And you're getting pissed off, it's getting me off
It's hard, it's hard
Oh, God, oh, God
Oh, God
People say I'm jealous but my kink is watching

You ruin your life
You losing your mind
You dyeing your hair
People say I'm jealous but my kink is watching
You crashing your car
You breaking your heart
You thinking I care
People say I'm jealous but my kink is karma
