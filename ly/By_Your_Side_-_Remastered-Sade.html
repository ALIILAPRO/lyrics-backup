		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You think I'd leave your side, baby?
You know me better than that
Think I'd leave you down when you're down on your knees?
I wouldn't do that
I'll tell you you're right when you aren't, ah, ah, oh
And if only you could see into me

Oh, when you're cold
I'll be there, hold you tight to me
When you're on the outside, baby, and you can't get in
I will show you you're so much better than you know

When you're lost and you're alone
And you can't get back again
I will find you, darling, and I'll bring you home

And if you want to cry
I am here to dry your eyes, ooh
And in no time, you'll be fine

You think I'd leave your side, baby?
You know me better than that
Think I'd leave you down when you're down on your knees?
I wouldn't do that
I'll tell you you're right when you aren't, ah, ah, oh
And if only you could see into me

Oh, when you're cold
I'll be there, hold you tight to me (to me, yeah)
Oh, when you're low
I'll be there by your side, baby (by your side, baby)

And, oh, when you're cold
I'll be there, hold you tight to me (to me, yeah)
Oh, when you're low
I'll be there by your side, baby
