		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Light the blunts up when I walk in the building (ooh)
Gravy getting buck every time I get up in it (ayy)
Always pull up with a plethora of women (of them women)
I be like, "Yup, bitch, that's how I be livin'" (ayy, ayy, ayy)
And your bitch say, "What's up?" Ayy, she tryna get it (ayy)
"Gravy lemme fuck," ooh I'll consider (ayy, ayy)
I ain't bust a nut in the last thirty minutes (ayy, ayy)
So I say, "Yup, baby girl, I'ma hit it," I'ma hit it, baby

Ayy, don't you fuck with me, buddy, you could meet the Fockers
When I pop it off, call me Orville Redenbacher
I be cookin' up I'm the young Betty Crocker
Gravy piped your mom again, wow, what a shocker
Hannah Montana, I got the juice, I got the Fanta
I got the juice, like a banana
I got the juice, like Tropicana
I make gas, I got gelato
I'ma splash, I'm like a bottle
Got pizazz, like it's my motto
I'm tryna pull up on Nelly Furtado and them I'ma smash
Gravy got your puta, she sittin' in my Jacuzzi
I think I need a few more
And if you got the Henny, pour it up

When I walk in the building
Gravy getting buck every time I get up in it (ayy)
Always pull up with a plethora of women (of them women)
I be like, "Yup, bitch, that's how I be livin'" (ayy, ayy, ayy)
And your bitch say, "What's up?" Ayy, she tryna get it (ayy)
"Gravy lemme fuck," ooh I'll consider (ayy, ayy)
I ain't bust a nut in the last thirty minutes (ayy, ayy)
So I say, "Yup, baby girl, I'ma hit it," I'ma hit it, baby

Yup, she said yup, I said yup 
I pull up, I clap, yup, yup, yup, baby (I'ma hit it, baby)
And if that bitch can clip her seat belt on the first try, then she ain't my type (I need a thicky)
Gravy need a bitch with an ass so fat that it makes it hard to live her life (goddamn)
And I'ma get the bands even if I don't want to
If you smell like Black & Milds, baby, I don't want you
Gravy got the drip and the cheese like I'm fondue
All of y'all been on one, congrats, bitch, I'm on too
She call me Papa Johns, I got the sauce, baby
Get the fuck off my lawn, now get lost, baby
Bitch, I feel like Boss Baby mixed with Jack Frost
Eighty bitches in my crib. going through 'em Randy Moss, baby

Ooh, pussy
Gravy

Light the blunts up when I walk in the building (ooh)
Gravy getting buck every time I get up in it (ayy)
Always pull up with a plethora of women (of them women)
I be like, "Yup, bitch, that's how I be livin'" (ayy, ayy, ayy)
And your bitch say, "What's up?" Ayy, she tryna get it (ayy)
"Gravy lemme fuck," ooh I'll consider (ayy, ayy)
I ain't bust a nut in the last thirty minutes (ayy, ayy)
So I say, "Yup, baby girl, I'ma hit it," I'ma hit it, baby
