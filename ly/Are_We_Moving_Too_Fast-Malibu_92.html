		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Constantly tired cause I'm constantly moving, baby
Making excuses to get you into my room
I'm getting tired of these games we've been playing lately
But stop me if you think that this is all way too soon
Are we moving too fast?
Are we moving too fast?
Are we moving too fast?
Are we moving too fast?
Are we moving too fast?
Throw on some Kanye and put your love on lockdown
Remember you told me that this time would be the last
I can't get enough of you, we're in too deep to stop now
But please slow down, baby, I think I just need to ask
Are we moving too fast?
Are we moving too fast?
Are we moving too fast?
Are we moving too fast?
Are we moving too fast?
(Sometimes all I wanna do is head west on twenty
In a car I can't afford with a plan I don't have
Just me, my music, and the road
I'd like that too)
This can't be love but don't call it a waste of time
We'll play pretend and I'll love you just for the night
(Here we go)
This can't be love but don't call it a waste of time
We'll play pretend and I'll love you just for the night
This can't be love but don't call it a waste of time
We'll play pretend and I'll love you just for the night
Are we moving too fast?
Are we moving too fast?
Are we moving too fast?
Are we moving too fast?
Am I moving too fast?
Are we moving too fast?
