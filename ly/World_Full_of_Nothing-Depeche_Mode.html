		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Close, naked
Skin on skin, tears are falling
Tears of joy, her first boy
His first girl makes a change 
In a world full of nothing
Though it's not love, it means something

She's lonely
And he says it's for her only
That he lusts, she doesn't trust him
Nothing is true but he will do
In a world full of nothing
Though it's not love, it means something

It's easy to slip away and believe it all
It's easy to slip away and believe it all
It's easy to slip away and believe it all
It's easy to slip away and believe it all

Though it's not love, it means something
Though it's not love, it means something
Though it's not love, it means something
Though it's not love, it means something
Though it's not love, it means something
Though it's not love, it means something
Though it's not love, it means something
