		  Kingston in my zone, ayy yeah, yeah

Go fi ya dress and me go be outside
In a four by four, just be down in five
Mi know ya ting, how ya act so nice
You a rude gyal and me nuh ya far from shy
(Far from shy) yuh friend nuh innocent
Me know 'bout the resum√© (Mm)
Become a magnet to the mandem
Who ah mek it rain
Don't bother come 'round if ya
Talkin' to the enemies (If we roll)
If we rollin', we nah separate

Loosen up for me if you loosen up, you cyaa
Give it up to nobody, Yeah
Loosen up for me if you loosen up
You nah give it up to nobody (Ah, ah)

Oh, ooh woah

Oh, ooh woah this only fi one man

Mi love how ya pussy nuh too friendly (No)
One man ya have, anuh plenty (Wha-wha)
We need fi chill me and you fi den e grill
A breeze up like a Glock when it empty (Brr)
One plantain to yuh cho-cho, you no nyam it
Yuh nuh walk with your pum-pum
Pon ya forehead (No)

Yuh nuh groupie, yuh nuh vagabond

You're my favorite ting fi do, girl

Oh, ooh woah

Oh, ooh woah
And it's only for one man, you can tell dem
Oh, ooh woah
