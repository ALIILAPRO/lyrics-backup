		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Darker days, a hurricane
Start a fire, then you're off again
It got cold, lose and gain
Run in circles, tryna find your way
Longer nights, losing sleep
You're on the line but you never speak
Just drift away into the deep
Into the deep

I can hear your silent call
You're caught up in letting go
And, baby, I want you to know
I'll always be (I'll always be)

I can hear your silent call
You're caught up in letting go
And, baby, I want you to know
I'll always be your way back home

Your way back home

Moving on makes it worse
To find someone you gotta lose them first
I won't call after search
Bring you back into my universe
Chasing you, I can't keep
Justifying every time you leave
Drift away into the deep
Into the deep

I can hear your silent call
You're caught up in letting go
But, baby, I want you to know
I'll always be (I'll always be)

I can hear your silent call
You're caught up in letting go
And, baby, I want you to know
I'll always be your way back home

Your way back home

I can hear your silent call
You're caught up in letting go
And, baby, I want you to know
I'll always be your way back home
