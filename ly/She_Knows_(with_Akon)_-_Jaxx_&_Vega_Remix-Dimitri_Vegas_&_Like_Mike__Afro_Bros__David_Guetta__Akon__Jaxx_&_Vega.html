		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She knows it
She knows it
She ain't afraid to show it
She knows it
No matter where she goin', yeah
All eyes on her backside like she's Khloe, yeah
Yeah, she knows it, yeah

Yeah, yeah, she knows it (she knows it)
She ain't afraid to show it (to show it)
She walks in the place just like she own it (ah)
No matter where she goin'
Got everybody focused

She knows, she knows, she knows
She knows (she knows, she knows, she knows)
She knows (she knows, she knows, she knows)
She knows (she knows, she knows, she knows)
She knows (she knows, she knows, she knows)

Hold it down for that, baby
Catch it while she drop it low
Now slow it down for me, lady
You're making my ting grow
Who gave you that right to call me, lick me like popsicle?
Got my body tingling, girl, from head down to my toe (oh)
She's the one that's always in control (oh yeah)
There's no place I wouldn't go (go)
Chasin' her lovin' (my love)
Chasin' her lovin' (oh yeah)

And she knows it (ah)
Oh yeah, she knows it
She ain't afraid to show it (oh, afraid)
She knows it
No matter where she goin' (oh, where she go)
All eyes on her backside like she Khloe, yeah
She knows it, yeah
Yeah, yeah, she knows it (oh yeah, she know)
She ain't afraid to show it (afraid to show)
She walks in the place just like she own it (oh yeah, she know)
No matter where she goin'
Got everybody focused

She knows, she knows, she knows
She knows (she knows, she knows, she knows)
She knows (she knows, she knows, she knows)
She knows (she knows, she knows, she knows)
She knows (she knows, she knows, she knows)

Na-na-na
Na-na-na
Na-na

She knows, she knows, she knows
