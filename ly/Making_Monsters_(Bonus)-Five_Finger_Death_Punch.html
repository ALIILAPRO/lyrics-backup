		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ladies and leeches welcome to the game
Everyone's invited cause everybody plays
All you gotta do is sign away the things you love the most
One day they're beating down your door
The next they're pissing on your ghost

And while you're building it up
I'm out here tearing it down
While you're trying to come up
I'm making monsters

Monster
I'm just a monster
Making monsters
I'm just a monster

Yeah everyone knows it but no one does a thing
You've gotta get dirty to ever get clean
I'm a bonafide pirate, best of the worst
Kicking and screaming scorch the fuckin' earth

And while you're ripping shit up
I'm out here breaking new ground
What the hell do I know
I'm just a monster

Monster
I'm just a monster
Making monsters
I'm just a monster
Making Monsters

You've called me a disease
Treat me like an infection
You'd hoped I'd fade away
That is my motivation

This isn't bending knee
This isn't self reflection
What did you think I'd do
This is retaliation

I'm just a monster
Monster
I'm just a monster
Making Monsters

I'm just a monster
Making Monsters
