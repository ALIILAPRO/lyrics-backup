		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
Uh, yeah
Know what I mean?
Yeah
Yeah, uh
Yeah, look, uh

My brother said you learn how to swim if he throw you in
Holding the pen, it got me blending with ink and fins
I'm holding that lens close 'cause I spoke through my sins
I told myself I'm holding my chin to where ocean begin
Conscious kept poking to make amends
And it finally tore my flesh when air couldn't get in
Morphine running through my veins
I just wanted to win
More keys opening the ways to love what's within
More keys opening the ways
Tryna set ablaze all my shitty old ways
This that soul tap, but it hit different on the page
Since I own that, it's gon' hit different on the stage
Got my own back, learned to never trip on no dismay
'Cause my dome raps ain't different than display
Picking up the pace got me living on display
This pending need for capital turned living to a race
I erase all these shackles in my daydreams and escape

Look, I said
Please don't weigh me down
Getting through these waters with my other hand
I said, you can't weigh me down
I can get this dream off if my mother can
I said, please don't weigh me down
Getting through these waters with my other hand
I said, you can't weigh me down
I can get this dream off if my mother can
Feel me
Yeah
