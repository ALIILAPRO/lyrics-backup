		  Can I get your number, girl?
Can I get your number, girl?
Can I get your number, girl?

Every time she see me, she start kissing and biting, fucking and fighting
She want see a cocky man ting, she a ride it
Pulling me inside her, so I pull up
We butt naked under my covers with the lights off
Baby, you're starting to wonder
Girl, I'mma have to keep it 100
Can I get you a towel? Wipe you down
Before you go, please can I get your number?

Can I get your number, girl?
Can I get your number, girl?
Can I get your number, girl?
Me, I wanna call you, oh
See, I want your number, girl
Can I get your number, girl?
Can I get your number, girl?
Me, I wanna call you, call you, call you
656-547-853 ring
See, I'm already dialing baby, hello
656-547-853 ring
See, I'm already dialing baby, hello

Oh, it's Jay Baba and Melvitto on the beat
Wanna tell you a story about this girl we had just meet
She looking fly, yeah she's looking neat
The boy is looking like money, right from my head down to my feet
She just smile at me, oh
I don't really know what it means so
Me, I'm in a bit of a limbo
But still I will make a move on this young lady

Can I get your number, girl?
Can I get your number, girl?
Can I get your number, girl?
Me, I wanna call you, oh
See, I want your number, girl
Can I get your number, girl?
Can I get your number, girl?
Me, I wanna call you, call you, call you
656-547-853 ring
See, I'm already dialing baby, hello
656-547-853 ring
See, I'm already dialing baby, hello

Can I get your number?
I hit you right before you slumber
I go down, I go under, Australian
Under covers, I be under your spell and
A lil high off that endo
They gon' hear you outside from the indoors
When I have you screamin'
Slow motion, have you leanin'
On a Saturday night like Kenan
Put that ass to sleep, have you dreamin', yeah
You gon' feel it in the mornin'
Just give me a minute, let me find out where my phone is

Can I get your number, girl?
Can I get your number, girl?
Can I get your number, girl?
Me, I wanna call you, oh
See, I want your number, girl
Can I get your number, girl?
Can I get your number, girl?
Me, I wanna call you, call you, call you
656-547-853 ring
See, I'm already dialing baby, hello
656-547-853 ring
See, I'm already dialing baby, hello

Girl you are killing it
Your body is banging and I am feeling it
The way I am feeling there's no concealing it
You're young, you're fine, so magnificent
Go on girl, yeah just keep killing it
Your body like an orange and I am peeling it
The way I am feeling there's no concealing it
And that's why I, I, I am really feeling it so

Can I get your number, girl?
Can I get your number, girl?
Can I get your number, girl?
Me, I wanna call you, oh
See, I want your number, girl
Can I get your number, girl?
Can I get your number, girl?
Me, I wanna call you, call you, call you
656-547-853 ring
See, I'm already dialing baby, hello
656-547-853 ring
See, I'm already dialing baby, hello

656-547-853 ring
See, I'm already dialing baby, hello
