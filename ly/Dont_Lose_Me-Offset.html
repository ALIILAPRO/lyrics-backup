		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And I apologize, you know what I'm sayin'? 
Breakin' your heart, breakin' our promise, breakin' God's promise
And, and bein' a, uh, selfish, messed up husband, you know what I'm sayin'? 
I'm tryin', I'm, I'm tryna be a better person, I wanna get this off

Give a little game
Buy a new chain
Put in that thang
Blow out the brains

Drip a little stain on 'em
Put a little game on 'em
Fuck around and put a ring on 'em
You beat it out the frame, don't you? (I'ma beat it)
I told her come and rain on me
You know everybody at the game, don't you?
On the microphone, you can sing on it
You done put it on me, I done put your name on me
Just don't switch up (switch)
Meet you in the future (who?)
There when you look up
Put her in the thrower, I done gave a girl hiccups
I don't really know any bitches that can keep up
Coolin' on the boat, in the 'yo, I really miss her
I really miss her (woo)
Demons in my soul got issues (demons)
Bought a Birkin and the price vicious (bought a Birkin)
I'm a genie and I'm grantin' wishes (genie)
Only for the missus (missus)
Target on my back, they on a mission (pow)
Baby when I talk you gotta listen (sh)
First time I seen the Patek glisten (glisten)
They did not believe the vision (believe)
Hoppin' out the V, expensive (the V)
Gotta learn about the weed and bitches ('bout the weed)
When I kick it with my seeds, I kiss 'em

You told me don't use me
(Don't use you)
KK, all beauty (KK)
When I'm lookin' down at her, it's you and me
She told me, "Don't lose me"
Don't lose me
She told me, "Don't lose me"
Don't lose me
She told me, "Don't lose me"

I like your tone (tone)
Why you ain't picking up the phone? (Phone)
I would like it if you came and tagged along (tagged along)
I'm the king, let me put you on a throne (throne)
She got the big diamonds, they grown (grown)
I'm sorry, let me come on home (come home)
She said, "Put down the styrofoam"
I'm bored and on the jet, come home
Truth be told, you gold (gold)
She had a Patek Phillipe it was cold
Put it in the mouth like you gettin' molds
I ain't do it for the clout or the trolls (trolls)
Number one, it's a loyalty code (number one)
Temptation, had the devil in my soul (temptation)
I wanna be with you when we old (when we old)
We didn't do this, we didn't know how shit goes (we didn't know)
You bad, you a cutie
I love your attitude, moody
I love when you call a nigga stupid
I love that you're ratchet not boujee
I love your ass-shots it's a movie
When you leave by my side I get woozy
When you won't stay twerkin' in your two piece
Starin' on the ground, you know you amuse me

You told me don't use me
(Don't use you)
KK, all beauty (KK)
When I'm lookin' down at her, it's you and me
She told me, "Don't lose me"
Don't lose me
Said, "Don't lose me"
Don't lose me
She told me, "Don't lose me"
