		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What you feel
Are your needs
All you want
Is to be loved

Pain!
Love!
Pain!

But you can give
Someone else
The same love
That you want

Pain!
Love!
Pain!
Pain!
Love!
Pain!

Come and take my pain
And soon you will see
That I will taste your pain
Then both of us can bleed

I loved you once
Now go away
I loved you once
Please stay away

Your emotions
Are out of control
A battered soul
Your love means shit

Pain!
Love!
Pain!
Pain!
Love!
Pain!

Come and take my pain
And soon you will see
That I will taste your pain
Then both of us can bleed

I loved you once
Now go away
I loved you once
Please stay away

I loved you once
Now go away
I loved you once
Please stay away
