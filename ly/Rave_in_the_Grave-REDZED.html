		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One, two, one two
One, two, one two

Yo punk ass bitch, sit down
Shut your mouth, I'm the
Cemetery killah coming
Right from the south
Bitch, I lay by the crypt
Bitch, I'm so underground
I've been searching for the peace
Now I know, can't be found

So I pull up with the gun
With the "Click, clack, pow"
In your face, and my teeth
They yellow from
The cig smoke days
Bitch, I creep trough the town
Covered up in haze
And I'm up to my neck, with
The shit you say

We are caught up in our lies
You can't escape this time
They eat you from the inside
(It's right)

I be that twisted motherfucker
See me underneath the bed
Bitch, I'm always undercover
I'm the loony psychopath
Put the dick inside your mother
Then I suffocate your dad
Cause I like the feel of violence
I'm another face of death

I grab your bitch by the throat
And I feed her the semen
Now you know you should not
Fuck with the demon

I grab your bitch by the throat
And I feed her the semen
Blade to the neck
Bitch, I don't need a reason

We are caught up in our lies
You can't escape this time
They eat you from the inside
(It's right)

Put your motherfucking hands in the air
If you wanna fuckin' die

Put your motherfucking hands in the air
If you wanna fuckin' die
