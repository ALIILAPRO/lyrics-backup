		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Some say, "Nightmares are dreams perverted")
(I told them it wasn't a nightmare)
(But they don't believe me) 

Huh, how you feel? (How you feel?)
Baby, I feel fine (I feel fine)
I need more dollar signs (dollar signs)
But you came right on time (right on time)
Can we turn off all these lights? (All these lights)
Can I roll up, get a 'lil high? (Get a 'lil high)
Every time I look at your eyes (look at your eyes)
I look away mesmerized (mesmerized)
And you shine brighter than the stars 
That decorate the night sky (the night sky)
And all I rock is flawless diamonds
I hope you don't mind (you don't mind)
And I promise to keep you close
If you promise you're mine (baby, you're mine)
And I been lapped them, no it's not close
I cross the finish line (finish line)

I look like a supermodel and all my draws is Calvin Klein
Yeah, my baby she built like a bottle, and I'm finna take a sip right now
Yeah, I'm pouring lines out a bottle, I'm finna take a sip right now
Yeah, and I probably won't see you tomorrow, 'cause I'm finna take a trip right now
Yeah, I been gone
I lost my mind and I'm tryna find my way back home
Baby, I'ma real rolling stone
I put chains on, don't do the phones, I won't talk until the case close (close)
Fuck 12, nigga, free my bro's, I got a problem with keep buying clothes (clothes)
And now my swag is stole, they can keep it, I don't want it (don't want it)
And I'll throw all this shit away if I can't give it to none of my homies (yeah)
And I'll throw all this shit away if I can't give it to none of my bitches (bitches)
If a nigga talk down on my gang, then he gon' leave here with some stitches (stitches)

Huh, how you feel? (How you feel?)
Baby, I feel fine (I feel fine)
I need more dollar signs (dollar signs)
But you came right on time (right on time)
Can we turn off all these lights? (All these lights)
Can I roll up, get a 'lil high? (Get a 'lil high)
Every time I look at your eyes (look at your eyes)
I look away mesmerized (mesmerized)
And you shine brighter than the stars 
That decorate the night sky 
And all I rock is flawless diamonds
I hope you don't mind (you don't mind)
And I promise to keep you close
If you promise you're mine (baby)
And I been lapped them, no it's not close
I cross the finish line (finish line)

I'm not into telling lies, got a mask on no disguise
And the old me already died, keep it on me, on my side
If you know me, know I'm fried, and I love you if you ridin'
And the doors in my brand new ride, go up they suicide (suicide)
I was geeked up off them Roxies, livin' on the top floor at the Roxy (huh)
And my life then changed so promptly, camera flashing, paparazzi (huh)
And I only sip on Wockhardt and Tris to make me nauseous (yeah)
And I always go hard, these niggas going hardly (yes)
I just bought her Goyard, she ride me like Harley (yes)
I told her she's a superstar and I just think she's gnarly
Me and my gang in here
This a rich nigga party, she brought her gang in here
This a bad bitches party (bad bitch party)
I'm a raver, but a real rockstar, please can we get guitars?
I'm an alien, but not from mars (no), and these niggas try too hard
She playing, baby, don't you start (huh)
Please don't make this hard
I go NBA but I'm not Vince Carter
That mean I'm balling and my money larger (yes)

Huh, how you feel? (How you feel?)
Baby, I feel fine (I feel fine)
I need more dollar signs (dollar signs)
But you came right on time (yeah, right on time)
Can we turn off all these lights? (All these lights)
Can I roll up, get a 'lil high? (Get a 'lil high)
Every time I look at your eyes (look at your eyes)
I look away mesmerized (mesmerized)
You shine brighter than the stars 
That decorate the night sky (the night sky)
And all I rock is flawless diamonds
I hope you don't mind (you don't mind)
And I promise to keep you close
If you promise you're mine (you stay mine)
And I been lapped them, no it's not close
I cross the finish line, finish line
