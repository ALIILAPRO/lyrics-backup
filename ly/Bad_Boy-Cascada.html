		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Remember the feelings
Remember the day
My stone heart was breaking
My love ran away
This moment I knew I would be someone else 
My love turned around and I felt

Be my bad boy be my man
Be my weekend lover
But don't be my friend
You can be my bad boy 
But understand 
That I don't need you in my life again 

Would you be my bad boy be my man
Be my weekend lover
But don't be my friend
You can be my bad boy 
But understand 
That I don't need you again
No I don't need you again

Bad boy! 
You once made this promise 
To stay by my side
But after some time
You just pushed me aside 

You never thought that a 
Girl could be strong
Now I'll show you
How to go on 

Be my bad boy be my man
Be my weekend lover
But don't be my friend
You can be my bad boy 
But understand 
That I don't need you in my life again 

Won't you be my bad boy
Be be my man
Be my weekend lover
But don't be my friend
You can be my bad boy 
But understand 
That I don't need you again
No I don't need you again
