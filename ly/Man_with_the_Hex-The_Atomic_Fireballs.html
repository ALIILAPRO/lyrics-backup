		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You remind of a man.
(What man?)
Oh, the man with the power.
(What power?)
Oh, the power of voodoo
(Who do?)
Oh, you do, you do
(Do what?)

You remind of a man.
(What man?)
Yeah, the man with the power.
(What power?)
Yeah, the power of voodoo
(Who do?)
Yeah, you do, you do
(Do what?)

Uh, we could take 'em out of this rex,
Save us from the man with the hex.
Save us from his evil course,
It's gonna get bad, yeah, it's gonna get worse.

Uh, hocus pocus alakazaam,
Save us from that evil man,
With hairy legs and heavy feet,
He cracks up, baby, as he creeks.

You remind of a man.
(What man?)
Yeah, the man with the power.
(What power?)
Oh, the power of voodoo
(Who do?)
Yeah, you do, you do
(Do what?)

You remind of a man.
(What man?)
Yeah, the man with the power.
(What power?)
Oh, the power of voodoo
(Who do?)
Yeah, you do, you do
(Do what?)

Uh ah, voodoo
Uh ah, voodoo
Uh ah, voodoo
Uh ah, voodoo

Save us, save us
(Save us, save us)
Save us, save us
(Save us, save us)
Save us, save us
(Save us, save us)
Save us, save us
(Save us, save us)

We can take 'em out of this rex,
Save us from the man with hex,
With bogy eyes and a bogy egg,
Save us from the man with hex.

Oh, save us, save us
(Save us, save us)
Save us, save us
(Save us, save us)
Save us, save us
(Save us, save us)
Save us, save us
Save us from the man with hex
