		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Just hear me out
If it's not perfect, I'll perfect it till my heart explodes
I highly doubt
That I can make it through another one of your episodes
Lashing out
One of the petty moves you pull before you lose control

You wear me out
But it's all right now

Let's go home and get stoned
We could end up making love instead of misery
Go home and get stoned
'Cause the sex is so much better when you're mad at me

You wear me out
(We can end up making love instead of misery)
But it's all right now

Without a doubt
Oh, the breakup's worth the makeup sex you're giving me
Let's hash it out
'Cause your bitching and your yelling don't mean anything
Don't count me out
I can handle all the baggage that you're carrying

You wear me out
(Whoa)
But it's all right now

Let's go home and get stoned
We could end up making love instead of misery
Go home and get stoned
'Cause the sex is so much better when you're mad at me

You wear me out
(We can end up making love instead of misery)
But it's all right now

Let's go home and get stoned
We could end up making love instead of misery
Go home and get stoned
'Cause the sex is so much better when you're mad at me

Go home and get stoned
We can end up making love instead of misery
Go home and get stoned
'Cause the sex is so much better when you're mad at me

You wear me out
(We can end up making love instead of misery)
But it's all right now
('Cause the sex is so much better when you're mad at me)

Let's go home and get stoned
(Whoa)
Let's go home and get stoned
(Whoa)
Let's go home and get stoned
(Whoa)
Let's go home and get stoned
