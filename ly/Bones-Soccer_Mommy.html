		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I feel the bones of how we used to be
They crowd the space between us and our sheets
And I wanna scream when you don't look at me like you did
Oh, back then

I wanna know what's wrong
With all of the ways I am
I'm trying to be someone
That you could love and understand

But I know that I'm not
I'm not
I'm not
I'm not

You make me feel like I am whole again
But I think your heart could use a tourniquet
'Cause I've bled you out and patched you up again
Far too much to call it love

I wanna know what's wrong
With all of the ways I am
I'm trying to be someone
That you could love and understand

But I know that I'm not
I'm not
I'm not
I'm not
I'm not
I'm not
I'm not
I'm not
