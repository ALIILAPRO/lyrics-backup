		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Rex made the beat, so you know I gotta murder it
They act all tough, but in person, they be murmuring
And mumbling, pull a gun out, they get to stumbling, tumbling
And the chopper get to thundering
Shitting on all these haters, like, where the plunger at?
I'm excited, 'cause now I can throw a party and all the people that hated on me won't be invited
True Religion on me like the Buddha, Indian style, I'm enlightened
I remember up in kindergarten, the teacher told me I wouldn't be shit
And then she saw me play the piano and made all the other kids seasick
Even though I got a couple demons, I'm still screaming out, "Thank Jesus"
Upside down pyramid on me just to compliment the Jesus pieces
I was a fan of Yu-Gi-Oh, that's why I pull cards on these stupid hoes
Got a arrow, not a bullet, Cupid ho, ha, yeah
I pop Percs to numb all the pain 'cause it hurt to live
I gotta take everything 'cause sometimes it hurt to give
I make money even though sometimes it don't make sense
Speaking of taking everything, it's time to take shits
On every single person that said I wouldn't do it
Every single person that said I was stupid
Every single person that said I was that Netflix special
What's the name of the show? Ah, Clueless
But no, I ain't clueless, I've got this
I'm on top so now nobody can top this
Now it's time to change the topic
I got a way with words, like I'm running with a phonics book
In school I didn't do the homework but I still got the subjects
Money ain't the object, money is the objective, gotta admit that
I'm successful but I feel like my head sometimes a little dreadful
I grew up on rock, rap, heavy metal
Now I'm ridin' bikes, pedal to the metal
I don't even gotta pedal, it's a throttle, so excuse me
These niggas faker than some optical illusions
I be looking like, "What the fuck is you doing?"
You ain't getting money, you ain't changing shit
You ain't changing the world, you just stupid
Talkin' bout you crackin' cars, selling drugs, killing niggas, and going hard
Watch a real nigga come up in your car, now you lookin' all scared
Finna piss yourself, shit yourself, you gotta admit yourself, you need some help
I gotta admit myself, I'm on these drugs, feel like I can't save myself
Sometimes I wanna take myself and break myself, so I can reshape myself, huh
Nobody ever felt the pain I felt, so I share it
Put it out to the whole world, I ain't embarrassed
Bunch of these niggas is my sons
I apologize to 'em cause I've been a bad parent
Don't try me 'cause I'm not the one, see I won't even count to two
