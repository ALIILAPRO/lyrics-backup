		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Run and tell all of the angels
This could take all night
Think I need a devil to help me
Get things right

Hook me up a new revolution
'Cause this one is a lie
We sat around laughing
And watched the last one die

Now I'm looking to the sky to save me
Looking for a sign of life
Looking for something to help me burn out bright

I'm looking for a complication
Looking 'cause I'm tired of lying
Make my way back home
When I learn to fly high

Think I'm done nursing the patience
It can wait one night
Give it all away
If you give me one last try

We'll live happily ever trapped
If you just save my life
Run and tell the angels
That everything's alright

I'm looking to the sky to save me
Looking for a sign of life
Looking for something to help me burn out bright

I'm looking for a complication
Looking 'cause I'm tired of trying
Make my way back home
When I learn to fly high
Make my way back home
When I learn to

Fly along with me
I can't quite make it alone
Try to make this life my own
Fly along with me
I can't quite make it alone
Try to make this life my own

I'm looking to the sky to save me
Looking for a sign of life
Looking for something help me burn out bright

I'm looking for a complication
Looking 'cause I'm tired of trying
Make my way back home
When I learn to

Looking to the sky to save me
Looking for a sign of life
Looking for something help me burn out bright

I'm looking for a complication
Looking 'cause I'm tired of trying
Make my way back home
When I learn to fly high
Make my way back home
When I learn to fly
Make my way back home
When I learn to
