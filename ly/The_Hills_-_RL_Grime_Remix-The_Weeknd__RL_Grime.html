		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Said you want a little company
And I love it 'cause the thrill's cheap
Said you left him for good this time
Still if he knew I was here, he'd wanna kill me
But it's time you met the real me, filthy
But wasn't always, will be your pill re-
Fill and I'll still be your addiction
You can touch a prescription, but don't fill me
I let you see my dark side
But like a mic check, you got one too
So when the sparks fly
We hit the flight deck and got sprung
Like an ejector seat, from an F-15
But tonight we don't need those pills just the effects of each
Other but we gon' film 'cause I will want your ex to see (Get it?) that

I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe

And every time he hurt you, I heard you
Your shoulder to cry on
And I'll be damned if I weren't who you turned to
You said he drove you to my arms
But don't you know, remember when I told you
I would never let down my guard
And I hope you feel like dirt when I hoe'd you
'Cause is it really over?

But you just want a little company
And you just really wanna thrill seek
Said you left him for good this time, bullshit
What your friends do, spill beans?
Or you just wanna be guilt free and still creep
But these hills see, from that POV
We can touch but the only way you'll film me
Is with a camera, feel me?
You're nothing but a barfly
You got your sights set on the one who you run to
But I'm a far cry from what you might get, if we come true
So keep texting me
But at night, if you seek those thrills what I expect to be?
'Cause if you cheat on him just means I will be the next to be
Your ex, so no complexities, just sex
And don't lecture me, just accept that

I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only fuck you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe

Hills have eyes, the hills have eyes
Who are you to judge
Who are you to judge?
Hide your lies, girl, hide your lies
Only you to trust, only you

I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only fuck you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe

Ewedihalehu
Yene konjo, ewedihalehu
Yene fikir, fikir, fikir, fikir
Yene fikir, fikir, fikir, fikir
Ewedihalehu
Yene konjo, ewedihalehu
