		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Walking home
These streets are covered in your laughs 
I’m feeling warm 
I still hear you singing in my head 

Because you got what I want 
And you got what I need 
You’re still in my head 
Got to get away

Spaceships come and take me to the moon 
Trust no one to know me like you 
I don’t belong here in this life
If I’m not with you I’ll lose my mind 
Spaceships come and take me to the moon

We were fire 
Why is it that nothing’s what it seems 
Painted lies 
I stay silent but I just wanna scream 

Because you got what I want 
And you got what I need 
You’re still in my head 
Got to get away

Spaceships come and take me to the moon 
Trust no one to know me like you 
I don’t belong here in this life
If I’m not with you I’ll lose my mind 
Spaceships come and take me to the moon

(Yeah)
(Na na na na)

I don’t belong here in this life
If I’m not with you I’ll lose my mind 
Spaceships come and take me to the moon
