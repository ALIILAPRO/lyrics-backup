		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In the light in the dark
Come alive where we are
Let the Sun rise and fall
And we'll follow
How we echo out inside
Will sound through tomorrow
I know we're on our way
Alight under the rain

How'd we become
Somewhere inside
I found
Light of the Sun
You know we're the one
How'd we become 
Beyond us
Somewhere inside of you
I found
Light of the Sun
We're shining down as one

If you follow me until the end 
Where the light inside us all began
If you follow me until the end 
Where the light inside us all began

If you want it
Then fall
Come alive where you are
In the haze, in the fog
In the rain and
Inside our shadowdance tonight
Your sunrise in this soul of mine
No, nothing shines like you and I 
You and I

How'd we become
Somewhere inside
I found
Light of the Sun
You know we're the one
How'd we become 
Beyond us
Somewhere inside of you
I found
Light of the Sun
We're shining down as one

Don't nobody know you like I do
Nobody ride just like we do
Nobody do it like we do

Don't nobody know you like I do
Nobody ride just like we do
Nobody do it like we do
