		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Think you've got one up
But we're ready to erupt
Now it's payback, payback
You know he better run
Flyin' too close to the sun
Now it's payback, payback

Girl, I see you gettin' used to, turn a blind eye
Girl, he keeps you in the dark, it's messin' with your mind
I don't want to see you waste another night out
Always lookin' at your phone like he will call you back

I just can't believe
Thought he could play you easily
Sweet revenge is all you need
It's time, don't send a warnin'

Think you've got one up
But we're ready to erupt
Now it's payback (time) payback, ooh-ooh
You know he better run
Flyin' too close to the sun 
Now it's payback (time) payback
We're comin' for you

Everybody knows he's playin' on your heartstrings
Rumour has it, he's been gettin' down with anythin'
Did he really think that we would never find out?
Girl, I got you, now let's show him what it's all about

I just can't believe
Thought he could play you easily
Sweet revenge is all you need
It's time, don't send a warnin'

Think you've got one up
But we're ready to erupt
Now it's payback (time) payback, ooh-ooh
You know he better run
Flyin' too close to the sun 
Now it's payback (time) payback
We're comin' for you

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
We're comin' for you
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
We're comin' for you
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Are you done with bein' sad? (oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah)
Can we leave him in the past? (Yeah)
Are you ready to go hard? (Yeah)
Gonna get what he deserves

Think you've got one up
But we're ready to erupt
Now it's payback (time) payback, ooh-ooh
You know he better run
Flyin' too close to the sun 
Now it's payback (time) payback
We're comin' for you

Think you've got one up
But we're ready to erupt
Now it's payback (time) payback, ooh-ooh
You know he better run
Flyin' too close to the sun 
Now it's payback (time) payback
We're comin' for you

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
We're comin' for you
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
We're comin' for you
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
We're comin' for you
