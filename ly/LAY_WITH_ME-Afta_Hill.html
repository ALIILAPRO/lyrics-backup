		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Woah shit)
Floating through space and time
Remember the curtains had let through diminished light
Bumping Frank Ocean right? “She don’t like Nikes”
Strip over checks but she wifey (Wife!)
Or maybe I think she is
Cus she pretty as fuck but below it she’s hideous
Torn from the torment of growing up
B-B-Baby I love you, don’t cover the scars up
My goddess I warship your every endorphin
I’d trade all my life for your happiness reach for your face then I’m back again
Damn (Lay with me)
(I’ll be your safety)

Yeah-yeah-yeah
Where have you come from?
I need your love but every time you come
I seem to wake up
Only in my dream can I be yours but
I need a moment just to come over
Tonight
Mmm
Tonight
mmmm

I’ve come to grips with the fact that I might never see you again
I don’t know if I can do it but I swear I need you again
Baby I know (Hey!)
A couple days pass and you’ll come back to me
I know that you’ll do it because you can’t leave
And every part of you wishes you’re with me but
I can’t do that no more

(While you’re here)
Lay with me baby girl oh
I’ll be your safety
Lay with me baby girl oh
I’ll be your safety

Ooh
Mmmm
No-no-no-no
No-no-no-no
No-no-no-no
No-no-no-no
No-no-no-no

If you need space, oh I’ll give you the galaxy
If you need time
I’ll wait an eternity
She live in a world she didn’t choose
A total catastrophe
Every moment, every time that I hold ya
Something ain’t quite how it supposed to be

And I get that feeling like you don’t love me no more
But I’d rather burn alive than walk out that door

Just lay with me (Lay with me)
who? Who?
Just lay with me (Lay with me)
Who? Who?
