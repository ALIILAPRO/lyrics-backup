		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mum, I'm sorry I stopped callin'
Don't know what the hell I was caught in
Can't stop dreamin' of chandeliers
And your voice is all I hear

I'm so heavy
Jump into my ocean
Can't you see me sinkin'?
Love the fear of fallin'
Don't you know I'm too young?
Can't you hear me callin' you?
Nothin' hurts me now

Mum, I'm sorry, I'm still fallin'
I'll be home December mornin'
I keep these dreams like souvenirs
Always ringin' in my ear

Yeah, it's in my head and I'm shutting it out
Can you hear? Can you hear me?
All the things I did, just drown it out
Just drown it out

I'm so heavy
Jump into my ocean
Can't you see me sinkin'?
Love the fear of fallin'
Don't you know I'm too young?
Can't you hear me callin' you?
Nothin' hurts me now

Tryna find the way it was
Tryna find the way
Tryna find the way it was
I see you in everything
Tryna find the way it was
Tryna find the way
Tryna find the way it was
I see you in everything
