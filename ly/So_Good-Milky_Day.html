		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We used to be so good, so good, so good
We used to be so good, so good, so good
They're leaving me for good, for good, for good

I'm just tryna make some time for you 
Baby I swear I'll fight for you
Ooh, ooh, oh woah 
Said happy endings do exist
But I've been getting lost 
All amidst my own thoughts
Think I'm goin crazy
I'm just tryna make some time for you 
Baby I swear I'll fight for you
Ooh, ooh, oh woah 
Said happy endings do exist
But I've been getting lost 
All amidst my own thoughts
Think I'm goin crazy

We used to be so good, so good, so good
We used to be so good, so good, so good
Now they're leaving me for good, for good, for good
They're leaving me for good, for good, for good
