		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know you think I got it all figured out 'cause
I walk around like my head's in the clouds but
I'm just a boy with his heart pouring out of his head

I wish that you could see the pain that I've seen and
All of the time I spent being not me and
I hope you know it's not always happy
In my head

'Cause I don't know
The perfect road to go down
But I know

I'm trying my best
I'm trying my best to be okay
I'm trying my best but every day
It's so hard

And I'm holding my breath
I'm holding my breath 'til I can say
All of the words I wanna say
From my heart

If you really wanted I could let you inside
It's been so long and I've got nothing left to hide
Would you believe me if I told you that I've
Got flaws

Now it's time to let the curtains unfold and
Tell all the stories that I didn't once told
I let it out so I unburden my soul
I won't stop

'Cause I don't know
The perfect road to go down
But I know

I'm trying my best
I'm trying my best to be okay
I'm trying my best but every day
It's so hard

And I'm holding my breath
I'm holding my breath 'til I can say
All of the words I wanna say
From my heart

I'm trying my best
I'm trying my best to be okay
I'm trying my best but every day
It's so hard

And I'm holding my breath
I'm holding my breath 'til I can say
All of the words I wanna say
From my heart
