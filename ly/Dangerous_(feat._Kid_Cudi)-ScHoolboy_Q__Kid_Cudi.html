		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm feeling dangerous, I'm feeling nauseous
Rolling me crazy, some marijuana
Smoking and faded, I got enormous
Drinkin' and swangin', I'm feelin' dangerous

Greet me by my hand 'til you teach me to float
Head is in the cloud, with my stomach below
Somethin' 'bout this feeling, I felt it before
Took this pill and it swallowed me whole
Pinch me on my arm, is it heaven or fun
If I don't come back, had a hell of a run
Taste you through my nose, smell the death on the tongue
Can't get high enough to get over the hump (Uh)
How many friends around me helping me lose?
How many excuses until I'm excused?
Shadow my morning, I ain't dreaming it right
Ain't no way a flower could bloom in the night
Family tried to warn me, couldn't keep me awake
'Til I figure flying, a better escape
But flying ain't flying when you're stuck on your ass
Pleasure took my driver then caused me to crash
Uh, took me forever, we was stuck in the mud
Chicken crossed the road to get out of the hood
Was drawing this darker feeling, feeling my face
Somebody go hand my drug dealer a K (K)
Bass on the Perc' and activating the sub (Sub)
Sold my heart and soul, that's a hell of a drug (Drug)
Take this hear, introduce you to love (Uh)
Take this hear, introduce you to love

I'm feeling dangerous (Hmmm), I'm feeling nauseous
Rolling me crazy (Hmmm), some marijuana
I'm feeling dangerous
