		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I met you, you were life and soul
'Cause everywhere we'd ever go
Yeah, you and I were the heart of the party
Didn't know responsibilities
We were just out there, two kids with dreams
All we wanted was to dance with everybody

We'd be at the bar drinking rum and Coke all night in New York City
'Cause sunrise over Central Park, it looked so pretty
I can't quite put my finger on the time that you went missing

I won't die with you, I won't check out
This ship ain't sinking, it just won't go down
'Cause I'm not finished, my heart beats loud
Yeah, I'm still swinging, why you throwing in the towel?
Where's the fire inside?

Well, that was then and this is now
It seems you lost your way somehow
Somebody stole the crazy kid inside you
Now you get your thrills from different pills
And all your chat is kids and bills
It's bad to think the good times are behind you

While I'm here, sitting on the White Isle in the land of living
Sand under my feet, my supermodel with me
I can't quite put my finger on the time that you went missing

I won't die with you, I won't check out
This ship ain't sinking, it just won't go down
'Cause I'm not finished, my heart beats loud
Yeah, I'm still swinging, why you throwing in the towel?
Where's the fire inside?
Where's the fire inside?

You know, you know
We all grow old
You know, you know
We all grow old

I won't die with you, I won't check out
This ship ain't sinking, it just won't go down
'Cause I'm not finished, my heart beats loud
Yeah, I'm still swinging, why you throwing in the towel?
I won't die with you, I won't check out
This ship ain't sinking, it just won't go down
'Cause I'm not finished, my heart beats loud
Yeah, I'm still swinging, why you throwing in the towel?
Where's the fire inside?
