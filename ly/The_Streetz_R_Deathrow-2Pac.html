		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Growing up as an inner city brother
Where every other had a pops and a mother
I was the product of a heated lover
Nobody knew how deep it screwed me
And since my pops never knew me
My family didn't know what to do with me
Was I somebody they despise? Curious look in they eyes
As if they wonder if I'm dead or alive
Poor momma can't control me
Quit tryin' to save my soul, I want to roll with my homies
A tickin' timebomb, an't nobody fade me, packin' a 380
And fiendin' for my Mercedes
Suckers scatter but it don't matter, I'm a cool shot
Punks drop from all the buckshots the fools got
I'm tired of being a nice guy
I've been poor all my life, but don't know quite why
So they label me a lunatic, could care less
Death or success is what I quest 'cause I'm fearless
Now The streets is deathrow

('Cause I'll beat you down, like it ain't nothin')
The streets is deathrow (like it ain't nothin)
('Cause I'll beat you down, like it ain't nothin') uh
The streets is deathrow (like it ain't nothin)

I just murdered a man, I'm even more stresse
Wearin' a vest, hopin' that they're aimin' at my chest
Much too young to bite the bullet, hand on the trigga
I see my life before my eyes each time I pull it
I hope I live to be a man
Must be part of some big plan to keep a brotha in the state pen
Counting pennies over the years I'd done stacked many
Proving wrong those who swore I wouldn't live to twenty
Now they gotta cope, since it's the only thing I know
It's difficult to let it go
I'm startin' to lose my hair 'cause I worry
Hustlin' to keep from gettin' buried
But now I gotta move away now (way now)
'Cause these suckers love to spray where I lay down (lay down)
My homie lost his family, he snapped
Shot up half the block to bring them back
The streets is deathrow

('Cause I'll beat you down, like it ain't nothin')
The streets is deathrow (like it ain't nothin)
('Cause I'll beat you down, like it ain't nothin') uh
The streets is deathrow (like it ain't nothin)
('Cause I'll beat you down, like it ain't nothin') yeah
The streets is deathrow (like it ain't nothin)
('Cause I'll beat you down, like it ain't nothin')
(Like it ain't nothin)

I'm dangerous when drunk, I only drink beer
Gin makes me sin, unable to think clear
Hennessy makes me think my enemy is getting close
Boom, boom, boom, got me shooting at a ghost
Some call me crazy but this is what you gave me
Amongst the babies who raised up from the slavery
I sport a vest and hit the sess to kill the stress
Moved out West and I invest in all the best
Those who test'll find a bullet in they chest
Put to rest, by a brother who was hopeless
Grow up broke, on the rope of insanity
How many pistols smoking comin' from a broken family?
I'm sick of being tired
Sick of the sirens, bodybags, and the guns firin'
Tell Bush push the button 'cause I'm fed
Tired of hearin' these voices in my head
The streets is deathrow

('Cause I'll beat you down, like it ain't nothin') yeah
The streets is deathrow (like it ain't nothin)
('Cause I'll beat you down, like it ain't nothin') uh
The streets is deathrow (like it ain't nothin)
('Cause I'll beat you down, like it ain't nothin') yeah, yeah
The streets is deathrow (like it ain't nothin) 
('Cause I'll beat you down, like it ain't nothin') yeah, uh, yeah
The streets is deathrow (like it ain't nothin)
('Cause I'll beat you down, like it ain't nothin') 
This go out to my partners in the Live Squad
And all my homies out there involved in that 187 (like it ain't nothin)
('Cause I'll beat you down, like it ain't nothin')
Watch your back (I love it when they fear me) (like it ain't nothin)
There's got to be a better way ('cause I'll beat you down, like it ain't nothin')
There's too many of us in the cemetery
(I love it when they fear me) (like it ain't nothin)
Come on, what we gonna do now? ('Cause I'll beat you down, like it ain't nothin')
(I love it when they fear me) (like it ain't nothin)
The streets is deathrow
