		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You only say that you want me
When I'm upside down, upside down
You only say that you want me
When I'm upside down, upside down

I got you tied up and I love it
Tied up and I love it
Now, why would I set you free?

Now you're tied up, you love it
No lies now, I love it
I'm not being mean, I'm just being me

I got some feelings
But I try to hide what I reel in
I fuck every broken, crazy girl
Instead of hanging from my ceiling

So I keep my life for like
Keep my head loose
But nose is like a beehive
I'm dripping blood honey
I'm dripping blood honey, yeah

I got you tied up and I love it
Tied up and I love it
Now, why would I set you free?

Now you're tied up, you love it
No lies now, I love it
I'm not being mean, I'm just being me

You only say that you want me
When I'm upside down, upside down
You only say that you want me
When I'm upside down, upside down

I'm dripping blood honey
I'm dripping blood honey, yeah
I'm dripping blood honey
I'm dripping blood honey, yeah

You only say that you want me
When I'm upside down, upside down
You only say that you want me
When I'm upside down, upside down

You only say that you want me
When I'm upside down, upside down
You only say that you want me
When I'm upside down, upside down
