		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well the road rolls out like a welcome mat
To a better place than the one we're at
And I ain't got no kinda plan
But I've had all of this town I can stand
And I got friends out on the coast
We can jump in the water and see what floats
We've been saving for a rainy day
Let's beat the storm and be on our way

And it don't matter to me
Wherever we are is where I wanna be
And honey, for once in our life
Let's take our chances and roll the dice
And I can be your lucky penny
You can be my four leaf clover
Starting over

This might not be an easy time
There's rivers to cross and hills to climb
And some days we might fall apart
And some nights might feel cold and dark
But nobody wins afraid of losing
And the hard roads are the ones worth choosing
Some day we'll look back and smile
And know it was worth every mile

And it don't matter to me
Wherever we are is where I wanna be
And honey, for once in our life
Let's take our chances and roll the dice
And I can be your lucky penny
You can be my four leaf clover
Starting over
Starting over

And it don't matter to me
Wherever we are is where I wanna be
And honey, for once in our life
Let's take our chances and roll the dice
And I can be your lucky penny
You can be my four leaf clover
Starting over
Starting over

Ooh
Ooh
