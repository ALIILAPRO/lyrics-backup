		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Just a castaway, an island lost at sea, oh
Another lonely day, no one here but me, oh
More loneliness any man could bear
Rescue me before I fall into despair, oh

I'll send an SOS to the world
I'll send an SOS to the world
I hope that someone gets my
I hope that someone gets my
I hope that someone gets my

Message in a bottle, yeah
Message in a bottle, yeah

A year has passed since I wrote my note
I should have known this right from the start
Only hope can keep me together
Love can mend your life but love can break your heart

I'll send an SOS to the world
I'll send an SOS to the world
I hope that someone gets my
I hope that someone gets my
I hope that someone gets my

Message in a bottle, yeah
Message in a bottle, yeah
Oh, message in a bottle, yeah
Message in a bottle, yeah

Walked out this morning, don't believe what I saw
Hundred billion bottles washed up on the shore
Seems I'm not alone in being alone
Hundred billion castaways looking for a home

I'll send an SOS to the world
I'll send an SOS to the world
I hope that someone gets my
I hope that someone gets my
I hope that someone gets my

Message in a bottle, yeah
Message in a bottle, yeah
Message in a bottle, whoa
Message in a bottle, yeah

Sendin' out an SOS
Sendin' out an SOS
I'm sendin' out an SOS
I'm sendin' out an SOS
Sendin' out an SOS
Sendin' out an SOS
Sendin' out an SOS
Sendin' out an SOS
Sendin' out an SOS
Sendin' out an SOS
Sendin' out an SOS
Sendin' out an SOS
Sendin' out an SOS
Sendin' out an SOS
Sendin' out an SOS
Sendin' out an SOS
Sendin' out an SOS
Sendin' out an SOS
Sendin' out an SOS
Sendin' out an SOS
Sendin' out an SOS
Sendin' out an SOS
Sendin' out an SOS
Sendin' out an SOS
Sendin' out an SOS
