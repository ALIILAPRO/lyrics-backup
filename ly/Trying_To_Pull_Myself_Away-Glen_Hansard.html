		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Breaking up in the station, a final train
I don't even know if I'll ever see you again
Is it a choice that we even have?

Bang, bang down on piano 'til I smash the keys
Living alone with the melodies
Everything's gone and I don't know where

And the rule of thumb don't apply anymore
'Cause the house is burning

I'm trying to pull myself away
I'm caught in a pattern and I can't escape
I'm trying to pull myself away

Lately when I get lost there's this thing I know
Even the dogs have somewhere to go
Everything comes if you just let it be

Work, work, brighten the corners that'll never see
Untangle the thoughts that you know what they mean
I hope that the answer didn't come too late

And the rule of thumb don't apply on me
'Cause the tables are turning

I'm trying to pull myself away
I'm caught in a pattern and I can't escape
I'm trying to pull myself away
Caught in a pattern and I can't escape, can't escape

Everything's gone, everything's gone, everything's gone
Trying to pull myself away
Everything's gone, everything's gone, everything's gone

Everything's gone, everything's gone, everything's gone
Everything's gone, everything's gone, everything's gone
Trying to pull myself away

Everything's gone, everything's gone, everything's gone
Everything's gone, everything's gone
