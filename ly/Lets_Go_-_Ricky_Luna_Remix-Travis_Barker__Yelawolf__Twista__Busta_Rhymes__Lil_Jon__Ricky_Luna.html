[Lil Jon:]
Yeah (Yeaaaahhhh!)
there's a lotta f*** n****s in the club tonight,
(f*** em, f*** em, f*** em)
but its gonna be aight, (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
'cause me and my clique we don't give a f*** n****.
Trick Daddy, Jim Johnson, Big D, Lil Jon

[Hook:]
Lets Gooooo! (Lets Gooooo!)
If you want it you can get it let me know (let me know),
I'm bout to f*** a n**** up, Lets Gooooo! (Lets Gooooo!)
If you want it you can get it let me know (let me know),
I'm bout to f*** a n**** up, Lets Gooooo! (Lets Gooooo!)

[Trick Daddy:]
If you want some, come get some,
'cause where I'm from we tote big guns,
And everybody know somebody that 
know somebody that know somethin bout it,
And I want answers now who, what, where, 
when and why,
see, a lotta dudes like to act a fool 
and all get all loud but that ain't my style,
and he who he gonna get and what he gonna do,
run up on me if he want to,
Out there impressin his homies,
but he stood up in front of his mama,
I mop up the flo wit em,
And I kick in the door and let the .44 get em,
I got fools that'll go get em,
that's some ?? and the dudes that run wit em.

[Hook]
[Twista:]
gotta spit for the murderas and the 
killas and the thugstas,
that be f***in up the ballas and 
the dealas and the hustlas,
got me comin at you bokas in the 
V.I. while they bumpin lil jon I'm a brush ya,
Its the psycho n**** twista from 
Chicago rollin with the Miami n**** that'll crush ya,
We already been lookin for drama 
if a n**** try to get it to then we still gotta get em,
??,
Got me swingin crysie and hennessy bottles, 
in the club with my thug homies goin for the skrilla,
Don't get it twisted with that 
overnight celebrity you better be scared 
of me in my city I'm a killa.

[Hook]
[Trick Daddy:]
I ain't that rappin type arright,
and I that actin type arright,
this sulphane in my script,
I'm a play on you and you just a square,
see, once that hennessy into 
me the whole industry is my enemy,
If you ain't no ten to me or friend to me,
b**** don't pretend to be,
I'm strictly for the thugs,
I'm part of the streets and straight out the hood,
That moments ghetto (ghetto),
Got me deep in gats for you wheezly cats,
I'm straight out the county of Dade,
played on fire n**** M-I-A,
never gone south of the border,
Americas most wanted you gonna get slaughtered.

[Hook 2x]
[Trick Daddy:]
The AK go chop, chop, chop, chop
The SK go fire, fire, fire, fire
The AK go chop, chop, chop, chop
The SK go fire, fire, fire, fire
