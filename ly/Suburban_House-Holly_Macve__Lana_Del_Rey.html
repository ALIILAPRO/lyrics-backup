		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It only takes one week
To fall out of love
With a woman like me
For a man like you

It only takes one look
To catch a stranger's eye
And imagine a life
Flashing colors while I'm blue

I'll sit back in my suburban house
While the nights close in
And my leaves turn brown
I'm not waiting for what you think I am
I know love comes and goes
Love comes and goes, ooh, ooh

It only takes one turn
To see a clear open road
Pretty white mountain tops
So many places to call home

I'm only just behind
But I'm already out of view
You always said snow looked so perfect
When it's untouched and new

I'll sit back in my suburban house
No white picket fence is gonna save me now
I'm not waiting, I know you've made your mind
And love comes and goes
Love comes and goes, ooh

Goes
Ooh
