		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're used to grey England skies
Cloudy days, colder nights
And your heart's not right
Thought you'd be quite happy there
In that warm New York air
But your heart's not right

But if you sing along with me 
Do you think you could ever smile again?
If you sing this melody
Do you think you could laugh again, my friend?
Just try for me
Sing

Oh, oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh, oh

Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh, oh

Don't wait for England to chime
Not for your heart or mine
I know time is never kind
You missed your warm winter boots
Say the tea's not as good
But you'll be alright

Everyone is going out 
In summer hats and colored tee shirts now
Take a walk around the park
I know it will be better soon somehow
Just try for me
Sing

Oh, oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh, oh

Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh, oh

And I'll keep on waiting 
I'll keep on waiting 
I'll keep on waiting 
For you

Oh, oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh, oh

Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh, oh

Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh, oh

Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh, oh
