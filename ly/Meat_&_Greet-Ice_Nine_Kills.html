		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  He's in the last cell, stay to the left
(Thank you)
Don't get close to the glass, and be careful
If he smells your fear he'll eat you alive

Hello, Clarise
Nothing's free at this meat and greet
Quid pro quo as we go
Spare me any deceit
(Take a seat)
A trainee desperate for some information
Skipped poor white trash by one generation
(Don't test me)

The silence is circling
Like lambs to a slaughter
This dance never ends
(Cut in and savor the consequence)

No, my darling Agent Starling
These are not just thrill kills
Let my mind help you find the fiend who fits the bill
(Or blood will spill)
Contrast his nasty habit with my refined pallet
(Then tell me who kills in poor taste)
Don't let a good meal go to waste

The silence is circling
Like lambs to a slaughter
This dance never ends
(Cut in and savor the consequence)
Defiled, starved then skinned
Like many before her, it's happened again
(We've all found the flavor we can't resist)

The starling spreads her wings
(While the evil threads the needle, so it seems)
The moth is pulling her strings
(Forced to well within his hell to stop the screams)
One final flight for vanity
(I'd fuck me)

Put the lotion in the basket
(Bid farewell then close the casket)
Put the lotion in the basket
(Bid farewell then close the casket)

The silence is circling
Like lambs to a slaughter
This dance never ends
(Cut in and savor the consequence)
Defiled, starved then skinned
Like many before her, it's happened again
(We've all found the flavor we can't resist)

The silence is circling
It's circling
(Cut in and savor the consequence)
(We've all found the flavor we can't resist)

I'd fuck me
