		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sunrise
In the palm of your hand
Think twice
Don't put your head in the sand
Alright, dream it if you wanna
All night down on the corner
Sunrise
In the palm of your hand

Open the door
See what you find
Don't look away
Open the door
See what you find
Don't look away

I see all that I will ever know
I see all that I will ever be
And it's warm outside

Open the door
See what you find
Don't look away

White light
In the palm of your hand
Think twice
Don't put your head in the sand
Alright, dream it if you wanna
All night down by the river
Think twice
Don't put your head in the sand

Open the door
See what you find
Don't look away
Open the door
See what you find
Don't look away

I see all that I will ever know
I see all that I will ever be
And it's warm outside

Open the door
See what you find
Don't look away
Open the door
See what you find
Don't look away
