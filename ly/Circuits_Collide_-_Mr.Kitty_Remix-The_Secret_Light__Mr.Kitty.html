		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been here for a long time 
Thinking time away 
You crawled out from a dumpster 
Tomorrow is today 

In my apocalyptic dreams 
I've always seen you waiting there 
Knowing someday I would find you 
You float among the clouds 
While I'm still stuck here on the ground 
I've always been one step behind you 

Now I don't speak your language 
But I know you understand 
I've been across the earth 
My heart is filled with anguish 
As we wander hand in hand 
A trash can gave you birth 

I don't know what emotion means, 
But I know I've never seen 
These circuits in my chest light up before 
Ever lost, I walk alone 
In this junk pile we call home 
I never knew what all these parts were for 

I've been here for a long time 
I know you feel it too 
Hand in hand, 
As we walk across the land 
I hope we get there soon
