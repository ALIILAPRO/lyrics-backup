		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I am the mastermind
Leaving you all behind
And that ain't no fuckin' lie!

I am the mastermind
It's just a problem of mine
It's like columbine
Columbine!

Your time has come
Kiss it all good-bye
Your time has come
Kiss it all good-bye

[Chorus]
What's that ruckus?
What's that ruckus?
What's that ruckus comin' through the night?
That's right
That's right
That's right

This message cannot be denied

[Chorus]

I am the mastermind
Underline mastermind
Until your pencil breaks

I am the mastermind
Just like a suicide
Your credit has been denied
Denied!

Your time has come
Kiss it all goodbye
Your time has come
Kiss it all goodbye

[Chorus]

This shit gonna turn your mama white

[Chorus]

That's right

Oh, Pennsylvania
Oh, Pennsylvania
Oh, Pennsylvania
Oh, Pennsylvania

I am the mastermind
Intelligent by design
It makes me wanna cry

I am the mastermind
And now that I'm satisfied
It's time to say goodbye
Good bye!

Your time has come
Kiss it all goodbye
Your time has come
Kiss it all goodbye

[Chorus]

That's right
I will not apologize

[Chorus]

That's right
