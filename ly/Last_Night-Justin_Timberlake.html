		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I just want to enjoy my life
And show this world how to care
And nothing brings more joy to my life
Than knowing a girl will be there

Are ya happy girl?
(Huh?)
Knowing that you right near broke my heart in a piece or two
(Huh?)
Knowing that I would have walked across the ocean for you
Saying you're young and confused
Well that's a lame excuse
That's why the only one to blame is you for

Last night
Can't believe what I was hearing
Telling me to have a nice life
So tonight
I don't think I'll spare your feelings
You're on your own
I'm a do for me what's right

In your eyes I see a second chance
Maybe I should take another glance
But for now I'll wash my hands
Cause I love ya baby, love ya baby
Pharrell say don't do it the same
But I say I ain't playing my games
But for you my soul still remains
Cause I love ya baby, love ya baby

Are ya happy girl?
(Huh?)
Knowing that you right near broke my heart in a piece or two
(Huh?)
Knowing that I would have walked across the ocean for you
Saying you're young and confused
Well that's a lame excuse
That's why the only one to blame is you for

Last night
Can't believe what I was hearing
Telling me to have a nice life
So tonight
I don't think I'll spare your feelings
You're on your own
I'm a do for me what's right

I hope you're thinking
(Tell me girl, when I was your man)
I hope it senses
(If you don't understand, then you don't understand)
We're gonna stop dreaming
(The way I feel)
About you

Last night
Can't believe what I was hearing
Telling me to have a nice life
So tonight
I don't think I'll spare your feelings
You're on your own
I'm a do for me what's right

Last night
(Just a last night)
Can't believe what I was hearing
(Just can't believe it baby)
Telling me to have a nice life (Oh)
So tonight
(Yea)
I don't think I'll spare your feelings
You're on your own
I'm a do for me what's right
(Got something I want to tell ya girl)

I hope you're thinking
(Tell me girl, when I was your man)
I hope it senses
(If you don't understand, then you don't understand)
We're gonna stop dreaming
(The way I feel)
About you
(Let me tell you one more time)

I hope you're thinking
(Tell me girl, when I was your man)
(My baby) I hope it senses
(If you don't understand, then you don't understand)
(Yea yea yea yea)
We're gonna stop dreaming
(The way I feel)
About you

Oh baby
Yea yea yea yea
See I ain't gonna be the one
Ain't gonna play these games with you
But I still love you

Remember girl when I was your man
Ain't nothing gonna take that away
No no no no, no no-no

See I remember
In December
We were walking holding hands
And I was your man
Can't we just get back to that?
Baby?
