		  R-E-A-L
L-O-V-E

If you're looking for perfection
I can tell you baby, I won't give it up
If you're looking for direction
Don't you know that you can always read them up

Don't make me your enemy yet
Just because I give you part time, don't forget
Don't make me your enemy yet
You know we could have a real thing, don't forget

Our love
There's no way
There's no way
That I can give it up

Love
(I can't give it up, I can't give it up)
Love
(I can't give it up, I can't give it up)
R-E-A-L
(I can't give it up, I can't give it up)
L-O-V-E
(I can't give it up, I can't give it up)

If you're looking for affection
Maybe I can use a bit of that
Our love is imperfection
Boy you know you're gonna have to live with it

Don't you try and settle me yet
Just because I give you part time, don't forget
Don't you try and settle me yet
Know that we could have forever, don't forget

Our love
There's no way
There's no way
That I can give it up
There's no way
There's no way
That I can give it up

Love
(I can't give it up, I can't give it up)
Love
(I can't give it up, I can't give it up)
R-E-A-L
(I can't give it up, I can't give it)
L-O-V-E
(Hold up your love, hold up your love)
R-E-A-L
(I can't give it up, I can't give it)
L-O-V-E
(Hold up your love, hold up your love)

There's no way
(I can't get enough)
There's no way
(I can't give it up)
That I can give it up
There's no way
(I can't get enough)
There's no way
(I can't give it up)
That I can give it up

(I can't give it up, I can't give it)
(I can't give it up, I can't give it up)
R-E-A-L
(I can't give it up, I can't give it)
L-O-V-E
(I can't give it up, I can't give it up)
