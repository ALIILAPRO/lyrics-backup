		  (Great John on the beat by the way)

Don't front, choppa dump
My bitch pretty, I fuck from the front
Took an L, I came back and I won
Boy lost a fight, he came back with a gun
Don't front, top two, but you not number one
I know mama she proud of her son
I know that you know that I'm not the one

Baby, I'm not the one
New whip, new box of gun
Told her, "Shake it", she like, "It's fun"
Drive the boat, I know she like it drunk
Gucci Gang, I just bought a lil' pump
If I tell Billy, "Do it", it's done
Who want smoke? I'ma roll up a blunt
And she say she hate me, still gave me the buns
I got booked 'cause I stay with a gun
I'm sorry Your Honor, I'm not one of them
Yeah, I'm smart, but I love to go dumb
Body different, I came from the slums
You know me, I been shootin' from young
The strippers love me, I be throwin' them ones
Know some niggas that died with their gun
You can have it and still get slumped
He got booked, now his bitch tryna fuck
Ain't no loyalty, why would you cuff?
You ain't got it, so why would you bluff?
They want smoke, I be ready to puff
Time to slide, is you ready or what?
Tried to run, but he ran out of luck
Free up Sheff, we be cookin' shit up
Free my dawg, I ain't talkin' no pup
If it's up, then it's stuck
Shoot my shot, I be comin' in clutch
Money callin', I'm pickin' it up
Drop your mans like, "Who pickin' him up?"
You can look, but don't touch
I start buggin', I'm shootin' shit up
She like, "Sleepy, you love me or what?"
She feel like I just don't be givin' a fuck
Huh, look

Don't front, choppa dump
My bitch pretty, I fuck from the front
Took an L, I came back and I won
Boy lost a fight, he came back with a gun
Don't front, top two, but you not number one
I know mama she proud of her son
I know that you know that I'm not the one
