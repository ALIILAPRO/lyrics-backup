		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Listen
Listen to your voice
'Cause I've been loved
I get my love from a God place
And I feel it
I get so clear in my breast
I'm not alone
And I've had the time to love and let love go

I'm loving you pure, no reason
Our life is the life that we want
Let love in for completion
There's got to be more believers

I can do all things
Through Christ who strengthens me
He gives strength to the weary
And increases power to the weak
Can I be honest with you?
I hope you receive these words with grace
'Cause I can tell that you
Won't let down your guard or put love first

There's got to be more believers
Our life is the life that we want
Let love in for completion
There's got to be more believers

There's got to be more believers
Our life is the life that we want
Let love in for completion
There's got to be more, there's got to be more believers

(Believers)
There's got to be more believers
