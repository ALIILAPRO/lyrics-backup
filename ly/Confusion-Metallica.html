		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wake to face the day
Grab this life and walk away
War is never done
Rub the patch and battle on
Make it go away
Please, make it go away

Confusion
All sanity is now beyond me
Delusion
All sanity is but a memory
My life, the war that never ends

Leave the battlefield
Yet it's horrors never heal
Coming home from war
Pieces don't fit anymore
Make it go away
Please, make it go away

Confusion
All sanity is now beyond me
Delusion
All sanity is but a memory
My life, the war that never ends

Father, please come home
Shell shocked all I've known
Father, please come home

Label him a deadwood soldier now
Cast away and left to roam
Rapid is the road to sacrifice
Just takes longer to come home
Come home

Confusion
All sanity is now beyond me
Delusion
Crossfire ricochets inside me
Trapped in a memory forever
My life, the war that never ends
