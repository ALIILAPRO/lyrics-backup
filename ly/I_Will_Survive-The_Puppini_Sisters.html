		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  First I was afraid 
I was petrified 
Kept thinking I could never live 
without you by my side 
But I spent so many nights 
Just thinking how you did me wrong 
And I grew strong 
And I learned how to carry on 
and so you're back 
from outer space 
I just walked in to find you here 
with that sad look upon your face 
I should have changed my stupid lock 
I should have made you leave your key 
If I had known for just one second 
you'd be back to bother me 

Go on now go walk out the door 
just turn around now 
'cause you're not welcome anymore 
weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye 
you think I'd crumble 
you think I'd lay down and die 
Oh no, not I 
I will survive 
as long as i know how to love 
I know I will stay alive 
I've got all my life to live 
I've got all my love to give 
and I'll survive 
I will survive 

It took all the strength I had 
not to fall apart 
kept trying hard to mend 
the pieces of my broken heart 
and I spent oh so many nights 
just feeling sorry for myself 
I used to cry 
Now I hold my head up high 
and you see me 
somebody new 
I'm not that chained up little person 
still in love with you 
and so you felt like dropping in 
and just expect me to be free 
now I'm saving all my loving 
for someone who's loving me
