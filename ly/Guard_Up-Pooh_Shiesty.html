		  Blrrrd
Mm-mm, guard up
Wanna keep it, don't start up
(Once again, I'm locked in with TP, we finna make a hit)
Uh, yeah, ayy, ayy

I just crossed another nigga over, tell 'em, "Guard up" (tell 'em, "Guard up")
Double tap the button up on the key, the car gon' start up (just watch it start up)
I lost some members at a early age, it left me scarred up (scarred up)
Chopper gang, the bands and sticks and drums when we march up (when we march up)
I just crossed another nigga over, tell 'em, "Guard up" (ayy, tell 'em, "Guard up")
Double tap the button up on the key, the car gon' start up (just watch it start up)
I lost some members at a early age, it left me scarred up (left me scarred up)
Chopper gang, the bands and sticks and drums when we march up (when we march up)

Keep clutchin' my fire stick, we check a nigga challenge, yeah (let's go)
You won't see me leave outside the house without my hammer (no)
And my lil' niggas bangin' Shiesty Gang in Alabama (blrrrd, blrrrd, blrrrd)
Ayy, these lemon squeeze'll bust his cherry, clip hold a banana (blrrrd, blrrrd, blrrrd, blrrrd)
Shit got stiff, can't wait to pull up on the block, ridin' Fanta (tell 'em, "Guard up")
And I'm slidin' like a sled in the snow but I ain't Santa (no)
My hoe know her head fire, she get to showin' off for the camera (yeah, she gon' show off for the cam)
Beat it bad like Michael Jackson, ayy, this my Dirty Diana (this my Dirty Diana)
Ayy, how you let a snake up in the grass, sneak up in the house? (Ayy, how?)
Soon as we get them bowls in, T the P, gon' take 'em out (I'm out)
A key and Glock up on me now because I chose the paper route (route)
You niggas better use a GPS and take the safer route, blrrrd (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

I just crossed another nigga over, tell 'em, "Guard up" (tell 'em, "Guard up")
Double tap the button up on the key, the car gon' start up (just watch it start up)
I lost some members at a early age, it left me scarred up (scarred up)
Chopper gang, the bands and sticks and drums when we march up (when we march up)
I just crossed another nigga over, tell 'em, "Guard up" (ayy, tell 'em, "Guard up")
Double tap the button up on the key, the car gon' start up (just watch it start up)
I lost some members at a early age, it left me scarred up (left me scarred up)
Chopper gang, the bands and sticks and drums when we march up (when we march up)

We with it today (we slime), we with it today (we slime)
It's just me and Baby Shiesty (yeah), and we two deep in a Wraith (yeah, yeah, yeah)
We with it today (we slime), we with it today (We slime)
It's just me and Baby Shiesty, and we two deep in a Wraith (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Since this Draco came with side effects, I tote a baby K (blrrrd, I tote a baby K)
Who want smoke with me? I pull up any time at any place (any time at any place)
This is not a .223 (no), this chopper here shoot through your head
Get that work out like a fitness room, you know we movin' weight (get shot up on in your face)
Been feelin' like my birthday every day, wake up and get the cake
Ayy, I was smokin' out the P, weighin' up ounces, smokin' shake
No, I can never let a nigga slide (no), I can't let 'em skate (I can't let 'em skate)
Shots fired, he on Fox live, bullet to his face, blrrrd (blrrrd, blrrrd, blrrrd, blrrrd)

I just crossed another nigga over, tell 'em, "Guard up" (guard up)
Double tap the button up on the key, the car gon' start up (just watch it start up)
I lost some members at a early age, it left me scarred up (scarred up)
Chopper gang, the bands and sticks and drums when we march up (yeah, when we march up)
I just crossed another nigga over, tell 'em, "Guard up" (tell 'em, "Guard up")
Double tap the button up on the key, the car gon' start up (blrrrd, just watch it start up)
I lost some members at a early age, it left me scarred up (yeah, yeah, it left me scarred up)
Chopper gang, the bands and sticks and drums when we march up 

Blrrrd, blrrrd, big blrrrd
Blrrrd, blrrrd
Blrrrd
