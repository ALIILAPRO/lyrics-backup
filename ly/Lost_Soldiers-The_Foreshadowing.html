		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Will I reward myself?
Will I be working out this time?
Will I refuse their words
Of emptiness and desperate times?
Will I be lost forever?
Will every plan rebuild the same?
I've just abused this world
Now suddenly I quit
Foreign in a world for what I've been
Falling again, foreigner me
Falling in the darkness of enemies
That suck your mind
Wandering around for what I need
Begging for a chance that never comes
Lonely in a town and fighting with my fate
I'm starting now
I'm starting now
We're soldiers for a fight
We're soldiers for a fight where no one kills
We're soldiers for a fight
We've lost it forever
We're soldiers for a fight
And fighting for a change that cannot be
We're soldiers for a fight
We've lost it forever
We're soldiers for a fight
We're soldiers for a fight where no one kills
We're soldiers for a fight
We've lost it
We're just a failure
We're soldiers for a fight
We've lost it forever
