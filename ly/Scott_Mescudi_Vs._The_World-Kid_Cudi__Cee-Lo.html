		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What up?
How's everyone doing?
You are now in the world I'm ruining
Take a minute to adjust for the wondrous
Cluster fuck of fun and enchantment
I promise this some generation X shit
Speak for the seller who I left with
Parallel levels in a dark dark place
Tripped all you niggas to a dark dark fate
And guided you all with a smile upon my face
As the sun kisses us on the foreheads gently
Gentle with the drugs, heavy with the love
And my speeches on stage, rock mountains from a club
Money doesn't move me except on the literal
G4 flights, now we're off to Australia
I wanna see more of the world
These are more than just words
These are facts from a winner

This is our journey into the horizon
Hope you can see past if it's real to you 
We can meet on the other side 
On the other side, ayy
This is our journey into the horizon
Hope you can see past if it's real to you 
Then we can meet on the other side 
On the other side

What up? How is everyone feeling?
I hope you understand what you're hearing
Take a minute to roll up for the wondrous
Clusterfuck of darkness and evil
I will play the Yin and the Yang for ya
And my jeans will be off with the little skinnies
Upgraded, fitted into the T
Work hard, making sure I don't become a memory
Hard to press on when the memories remember me
And they always find the perfect moment
High speed I'm a minimal slum
Lost in the wind, I've lost all my friends
Maybe they were never meant to be acquainted
Money seems to make everything tainted
Everybody mad 'cause they stuck where I knew 'em last
Took what I wanted and I did it all blunted, oh oh

This is our journey into the horizon
Hope you can see past if it's real to you 
We can meet on the other side 
On the other side, ayy
This is our journey into the horizon
Hope you can see past if it's real to you 
Then we can meet on the other side 
On the other side

This is our journey into the horizon
Hope you can see past if it's real to you 
We can meet on the other side 
On the other side, ayy
This is our journey into the horizon
Hope you can see past if it's real to you 
Then we can meet on the other side 
On the other side
