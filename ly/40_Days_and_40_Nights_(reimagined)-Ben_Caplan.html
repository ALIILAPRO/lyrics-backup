		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I been out in the desert
I have wandered on through the sands
I been burned, I been thirsty
I've walked with the devil through dangerous lands
I have seen with my eyes images I wish I could erase
I have danced with lady temptation
I've felt her fire, I have seen her face

Well, I can't make it, I won't last another day
Cause each day is torture
Baby, each day is torture when you're away
I can't do without you
My lover, my partner, my friend
And now that you're gone each moment's so long
I can't wait till you come back again

Oh! I been missing my woman
Forty days and forty nights
I been missing my woman
Forty days and forty nights
I have been missing my woman
Forty days and forty nights
I been missing my woman
Forty days and forty nights

Earlier today, heard somebody say
That he didn't believe that true love exists anyway
And earlier today, oh, heard that same man say
That any man is a liar who says he desires
To be with one woman the rest of his days

Well, I don't know how the future is going to unfold
And I don't know just how we're gonna feel when we get old
But there's one thing, baby
Honey, one thing I'm certain is true
I have tried it out, I can't do without
No, I don't want to live without you

I been missing my woman
Forty days and forty nights
I been missing my woman
Forty days and forty nights
I been missing my woman
Forty days and forty nights
I been missing my woman
Forty days and forty nights

I been lost out at sea, rocked the boat
Felt the sting of the rain
I been surrounded by couples
I felt loneliness I could never explain
I have felt in my heart the flood of despair overtake
Not knowing for sure if I could endure
Overwhelmed by the value of what was at stake

Well, I can't make it, I won't last another day
Cause each day is torture
Baby, each day is torture when you're away
I can't do without you
My lover, my partner, my friend
And now that you're gone each moment's so long
I can't wait till you come back again

I been missing my woman
Forty days and forty nights
I been missing my woman
Forty days and forty nights
I have been missing my woman
Forty days and forty nights
I been missing my woman
Forty days and forty nights
