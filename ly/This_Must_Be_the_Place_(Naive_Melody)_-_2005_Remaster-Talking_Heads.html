		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Home is where I want to be
Pick me up and turn me around
I feel numb, born with a weak heart
I guess I must be having fun

The less we say about it the better
Make it up as we go along
Feet on the ground, head in the sky
It's okay, I know nothing's wrong, nothing

Oh, I have plenty of time
Oh, you got light in your eyes
And you're standing here beside me
I love the passing of time
Never for money, always for love
Cover up and say goodnight, say goodnight

Home, is where I want to be
But I guess I'm already there
I come home, she lifted up her wings
I guess that this must be the place

I can't tell one from the other
Did I find you, or you find me?
There was a time before we were born
If someone asks, this is where I'll be, where I'll be

Oh, we drift in and out
Oh, sing into my mouth
Out of all those kinds of people
You got a face with a view

I'm just an animal looking for a home and
Share the same space for a minute or two
And you love me 'til my heart stops
Love me 'til I'm dead

Eyes that light up
Eyes look through you
Cover up the blank spots
Hit me on the head I got, ooh
