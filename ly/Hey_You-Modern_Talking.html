		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  He has a heart of gold
The way to paradise is cold
I know, I know
That this world is a show
Love you more than words can say
There's a will, there's a way
I know, I know
That this world is a show

I want you, hey you
Feel brand new
Oh, I break the golden rules
Time is on my side
I want you, hey you
Take a chance on me
Baby, put your love on me
I want you tonight

I want you, hey you
Little boogaloo
Shot a hole right in my soul
Hey girl, hey girl, take this chance for love
I want you, hey you
Little boogaloo
You want me and I want you
Hey girl, hey girl
You are the one that I'm dreaming off

I'm tired of be alone
Oh girl, it's easier said than done
I know, I know
That this world is a show
Oh, you wasted days and nights
Give me the chance for paradise
I know, I know
That this world is a show
