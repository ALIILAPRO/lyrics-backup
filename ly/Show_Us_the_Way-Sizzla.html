		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Just organize and centralize my people
Because Babylon have...
Instilled malicious and grudged upon my people,yuh know
Yuh see the dutty lifestyle...the Rastaman ah bu'n it!!!
 
There's nothing in them system
Of which they create all around,ey
They criticize their own Idren
Yet they would catch at a straw if they were to drown,ey!
They not different from those 
Scribes and Pharisees who come around,ey!
They lurks in the corners
Skylarks in the streets,flirt in the towns
They never do positive
They find a joy making people business their own,ey
Dance ah yard before yuh dance abroad
The High Priest tell yuh dat and you dey frown

chorus
Galong^,go get good ways,true grace
Haffi purge fi pass Zion Gate
You haffi have good ways--it give you long days
Nah take no bribe from not a screw-face
Go get good ways,good grace
Purge fi pass Zion Gate
You haffi have some good ways--it give you long days
Aw! what do you say? ah tell yuh now
 
They await your downfall
Fi go labba and talk--yow!
Well dey greater joy ah commission
Yuh haffi go have ah knock he jawbone fi laugh,aayy!
When Babylon city ah go down
Propaganda whey they spread becomes a dagger to them heart,ey!
Think say them have a secret
The baby reveal it,say them ah wok witchcraft,ow!
Say dem better,so them ah close in
Contempt the youth them whey they pass
Every man is equal
Rastafari say trod not on the ungodly path
 
Chorus 
Galong,go get good ways,long days
Purge fi pass Zion Gate
What about your good ways?--it give yuh length of days
Yow,yow yuh taste
So yuh medicine they taste
Yeah,wha',wha' !
 
Ey! once them know
Ah chat 'bout them this,them that
Who slick from who flop,ey!
Them say mash through bush
And anything else whey fi come 
Ah mus' be rubbish and trash--oy!
Every day ah dat them practice
The same ting,them never yet know when fi stop
Full up ah bad mind!
Then ah wah make yuh want fi see yuh brother drown
 
Chorus 
Go and have some good ways,true grace
Purge before yuh pass Zion Gate
Go and have some good ways--it give you long days
Oh! now them taste
So they medicine they taste
Good ways,long days
Nah let go King Selassie through no screw-face
Good ways--it give yuh length of days
Nah take no bribe from no screw-face
Just have some good ways--it give yuh length of days
Aw! this ah one ah true faith
Ah tell yuh now
 
There's nothing in the system
That they have create around
Oh! they criticize their own high-trine^
Yet they would cyah touch a straw if they were to drown
Don't you see they're not much different 
From the Scribes and the Pharisees who come around,yow
They lurks in the corners
Skylarks in the streets......
