		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wanna feel you on my skin 
Body to body is the cure for anything 
Waking up at 2pm
Instant coffee, medicine 
Don’t know what direction this is heading in 
Covering the ugly truth
Rosy cheeks and i love you’s 
Praying that you love me too 

Don’t waste a minute i gotta have you 
So used to quitting before the break through
I'll trade my parts in for a better me
I wanna hold you until you can’t breathe 

You are a stain on my favorite shirt 
Hard to get rid of, too old to return 
So i’ll wear you to bed, i guess that doesn’t hurt 
We lay but nothing’s happening 
Stiff and lonely mannequins
TV show about to get good and then they cancel it
Look at me right in my face 
Tell me, do you feel misplaced? 
Is it getting hard to escape?

Don’t waste a minute i gotta have you 
So used to quitting before the break through
I’ll trade my parts in for a better me
I wanna hold you until you can’t breathe 

Don’t waste a minute i gotta have you 
So used to quitting before the break through
I’ll trade my parts in for a better me
I wanna hold you until you can’t breathe
