		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Last night (last night)
I couldn't even get an answer (answer)
I tried to call (tried to call)
But my pride wouldn't let me dial (dial)
And I'm sitting here with this blank expression (expression)
And the way I feel
I wanna curl up like a child (child)

I know you can hear me
I know you can feel me
I can't live without you
God, please make me better
I wish I wasn't the way I am

If I told you once, I told you twice
You can see it in my eyes
I'm all cried out with nothing to say
You're everything I wanted to be
If you could only see your heart belongs to me
I love you so much
I'm yearning for your touch
Come and set me free
Forever yours I'll be
Baby, won't you come and take this pain away?

Last night, I couldn't even get an answer
(You said you couldn't get an answer, baby)
I tried to call, but my pride wouldn't let me dial
(But that should never stop you)
And I'm sitting here (sitting there)
With this blank expression (I can't read your mind, baby)
And the way I feel (the way I feel)
I wanna curl up like a child (oh baby)

I need you and you need me
This is so plain to see
And I will never let you go
And I will always love you so, I will
If you could only see
Your heart belongs to me
I love you so much
I'm yearning for your touch
Come and set me free
Forever yours I'll be
Baby, won't you come and take this pain away?

Last night (oh, last night)
I couldn't even get an answer (oh baby, what you wanna do to me?)
I tried to call (alright)
But my pride wouldn't let me dial (why wouldn't you just tell me, baby?)
And I'm sitting here
With this blank expression (don't save me baby, no, no)
And the way I feel
I wanna curl up like a child (I'm so alone, I'm so lonely, baby oh)

Tell me what words to say
To make you come back and break me like that
And if it matters, I'd rather stay home
With you I'm never alone
Don't wanna wait 'til you're gone
Whatever you do, just don't leave me

Last night
I couldn't even get an answer (couldn't get an answer, baby)
I tried to call (call me, baby)
But my pride wouldn't let me dial (why couldn't you just tell me, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby?)
And I'm sitting here
With this blank expression (don't sit there, no)
And the way I feel (alright, yeah)
I wanna curl up like a child (I'm so alone, I'm so lonely, baby oh)

I need you and you need me (I need you)
This is so plain to see
And I will never let you go
And I will always love you so, I will
If you could only see
Your heart belongs to me
I love you so much
I'm yearning for your touch
Come and set me free
Forever yours I'll be
Baby, won't you come and take my pain away?

Last night
I couldn't even get an answer (I couldn't get you, baby, yeah)
I tried to call (call me, baby)
But my pride wouldn't let me dial (why couldn't you just tell me, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby?)
And I'm sitting here
With this blank expression (don't sit there, no)
And the way I feel (alright, yeah)
I wanna curl up like a child (I'm so alone, I'm so lonely, baby oh)

Why don't you pick up the phone
And dial up my number
And call me up, baby?
I'm waiting on you

Why don't you pick up the phone
And dial up my number
Just call me up, baby?
I'm waiting on you

Hello
Hey, what's up?
I've been tryin' to reach you all night
That shit ain't funny not picking up the motherfucking phone
Better stop fucking playing with a niggas feelings like that
You know how much I love you, right?
But for those couple of seconds, though
When I couldn't get in touch with you
I'm ready to come over your house and shoot that motherfucker up
You fucking dumb bitch
You better motherfucking not be there when I get over that house

That's really how it go down, right?
