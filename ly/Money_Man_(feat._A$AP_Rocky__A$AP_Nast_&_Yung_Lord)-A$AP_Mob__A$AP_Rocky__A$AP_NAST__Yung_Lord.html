		<p>
		  Oh we finna fuck up a check today, nigga, fuck that!
Oh we finna get paid today
I'm 'bout my cash today
I'm 'bout my dough today
I'm 'bout my hoes today
Money on my mind every fucking day, hunnids on my mind every fucking day
Get that money young nigga!
Get that cash young nigga!
Take that cash young nigga!
Flacko!

I'mma ride, I'mma ride, I'mma ride, I'mma ride
I'mma ride, I'ma ride, I'mma ride
All that I wanted man
Wanted some money man
Look at my wallet man
Countin' the hunnids
Call me the money man
She do the money dance
I keep the money man
Keep it one hunnid

Cash rules everything around me
Nigga ask about me
I swear my shooters be my juniors call me Robert Downey
He held it down, he held his own
Now holding down the county
It just so happen now, she wet and now i'm all outta Bounty
I'm the quicker, picker upper
Still don't give no fucks bruh
Quick to pick her up
I be that pretty mothafucker
For fuckin' up my cash on Ubers
Time to switch the truck up
Tip the driver
Turn the Future up, fuck up some commas
Homicide, pussy good, eat it good, treat it good
Beat it good, peck a wood, wish you could
Love a ride, ride or die
Ride it back, forth, side to side
Make it shake, surfboard
Make a nigga go dumb for it
I'ma ride, I'ma ride
Love the bitch 'till I die
Genuine, Bonnie Clyde
We gon' die, homicide
Suicide, two of us
You and I, crucified
Truths and lies, you despise
I'm the best, you decide

I'mma ride, I'mma ride, I'mma ride, I'mma ride
I'mma ride, I'mma ride, I'mma ride, I'mma ride, I'mma ride
Choose a side, suicide
You and I, crucified
You despise
I'm the best, you decide

Ay, pulled up on lil shawty
Hello, howdy, howdy
I just hopped out my Rover
Shot my rollie, uhh
I just hit my jeweler threw some diamonds on it
Call that hoe don't come I ain't got no times for phonies, uhh
I've been gettin' money, Why you niggas fronting?
Flacko told me "fuck 'em", I'm like "nah let's buck 'em"
I ain't got no time, these niggas want discussion
Told her drop that ass, I ain't tryna fuck you
I just bought a stripper pole
I put it in my bed room
Got your hoe plus several more flying down the metal
666 offend your bitch
She call my dick the devil
She like "nasty baby demon", yeah that boy a rebel

All that I wanted man
Wanted some money man
Look at my wallet man
Countin' the hunnids
Call me the money man
She do the money dance
I keep the money man
Keep it one hunnid
Look at my product man
I'm made of money man
Check out my closet man
Call in the contraband
Fuck with the rubber bands
I count a hunnid bands
She see the money man
She do the money dance

I'mma ride, I'mma ride, I'mma ride, I'mma ride
I'mma ride, I'mma ride, I'mma ride, I'mma ride
Choose a side, suicide
You and I, crucified
You despise
I'm the best, you decide
