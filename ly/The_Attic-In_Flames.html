		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There is someone in the attic 
Building a strange machine 
Never really seen him 
But I think he works all day 

Blinded by the world outside 
I stay inside 
Hardly know my name 
But it's getting better by time 

I saw something in the mirror 

Someone's watching me 
If I hide in the attic 
He will never get to me 

I found some rope on the floor 
I have to build a trap 
So I started on my machine 
I have never to be seen
