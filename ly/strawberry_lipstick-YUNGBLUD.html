		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is a song about a person I love

Ay ay ay

I got a toxic attitude and lack of self control
A reasonably fucked up individual
Need you to cleanse my sins
So I can go to school
P-p-p-please
They're gonna lock me in a closet, but I'm coming out
Singing fuck all the oppression and the self doubt
I'm gonna bite all of your fingers, put them in my mouth
I'm on my knees

So take it easy, take it easy, take it easy, girl
Take it easy, take it easy on me
I know you're so hard to please
Just take it easy, take it easy on me

Ay ay ay

She got, she got my heart in her hands like a headlock
I can't see straight, ten seconds past five o'clock
I don't know what she's doing, but she'll do me wrong
She's such a tease
She holds all the p-p-power in her fingertips
She's gonna suck on my strawberry lipstick
She's gonna taste my body with her fingertips
I cannot breathe
I can't breathe

So take it easy, take it easy, take it easy, girl
Take it easy, take it easy on me
I know you're so hard to please
Just take it easy, take it easy on me
Take it easy on me
Oh, take it
Whoa

You can have it all
If you don't take my heart
You can have it all
If you, you take it easy, take it easy on me
You take it easy, take it easy on me
You take it easy, take it easy on me
