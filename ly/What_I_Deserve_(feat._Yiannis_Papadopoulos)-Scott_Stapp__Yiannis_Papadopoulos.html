		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Can you see how this stuff could work in your life?)
(One last principle and we'll bring this to a close)

Love is fear
The fear of losing the feeling
That keeps you alive, keeps you alive
Love is anger
The anger that comes when I see
That you wasted your life, wasting your life
Love is breathing
You couldn't stop it if you tried
What comes around again and again
Will open up your eyes

I am guilty, I am innocent
I am searching for deliverance
I get lost, I get hurt
I just want what I deserve
We are sons, we are daughters
We are fire, we are water
We all choose who we serve
I just want, I just want
What I deserve

Love is dead
Unless you bring it back to life
It takes two sides, it takes two sides
Love is choosing, love is fighting
Love is learning and surviving
Just accept what you give is what you get

I am guilty, I am innocent
I am searching for deliverance
I get lost, I get hurt
I just want what I deserve
We are sons, we are daughters
We are fire, we are water
We all choose who we serve
I just want, I just want
What I deserve

(Do you think God wouldn't send you the truth?)
(I am all things that are honest, that are just, that will transform your life)

I am guilty, I am innocent
I am searching for deliverance
I get lost, I get hurt
I just want what I deserve
We are sons, we are daughters
We are fire, we are water
We all choose who we serve
I just want, I just want
What I deserve

(I believe it's in the thoughts, emotions and then our actions)
(And you need to realize that the Holy Spirit will lead us into all truth)
