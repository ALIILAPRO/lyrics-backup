		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey you, up in the sky 
Learnin' to fly 
Tell me, how high 
Do you think you'd go 
Before you start falling?

Hey you, up in the tree 
You want to be me 
Well, that couldn't be 
'Cause the people here
They don't hear you calling 

How does it feel 
When you're inside me? 

Hey you, wearing the crown 
Making no sound 
I heard you feel down 
Well, that's just too bad 
Welcome to my world 

Hey you, stealing the light 
I've heard that the shine's 
Gone out of your life 
Well, that's just too bad 
Welcome to my world 

How does it feel 
When you're inside me? 

You'll need assistance with the things that you
Have never ever seen 
It's just a case of never breathin' out 
Before you've breathed it in

How does it feel 
When you're inside?

I can feel you
Can you feel me?

Hey you, up in the sky 
Learnin' to fly 
Tell me, how high 
Do you think you'd go 
Before you start falling?

Hey you, up in the tree 
You want to be me 
Well, that couldn't be 
'Cause the people here
They don't hear you calling 

How does it feel 
When you're inside me? 

You'll need assistance with the things that you
Have never ever seen 
It's just a case of never breathin' out 
Before you've breathed it in

How does it feel 
When you're inside?
