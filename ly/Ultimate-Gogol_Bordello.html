		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If we are here not to do
What you and I wanna do
And go forever crazy with it
Why the hell are we even here?

There was never any good old days
They are today, they are tomorrow
It's a stupid thing we say
Cursing tomorrow with sorrow

When we stand here in a row
Looking like a bunch of heroes
I know that a deep inside
Nothing more but bunch of zeros

Skolko utetchki tepla
Vot takaja vot subda
Nam segodnja suzdena
A bti mezget chto kogda da-j povezet

There was never any good old days
They are today, they are tomorrow
It's a stupid thing we say
Cursing tomorrow with sorrow

Steppin' on the trail of ultimate
I would never choose to die
Give me the rest of all the secrets
Give me new culture of life

Ultimate
Ultimate
Ultimate
Ultimate
Ultimate
