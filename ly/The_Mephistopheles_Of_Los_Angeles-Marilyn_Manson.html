		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't know if I can open up
I've been opened enough
I don't know if I can open up
I'm not a birthday present
I'm aggressive regressive
The past is over
And passive scenes so pathetic

I was fated, faithful, fatal
I was fated, faithful, fatal

I feel sole and alone like a heretic
Ready to meet my maker
I feel sole and alone like a heretic
I'm ready to meet my maker
Lazarus has got no dirt on me
Lazarus has got no dirt on me
And I'll rise every danger
I'm the Mephistopheles of Los Angeles
Of Los Angeles

Don't know if I can open up
I been opened too much
Double cross glossed over in my pathos

I was fated, faithful, fatal
I was fated, faithful, fatal

I feel sole and alone like a heretic
Ready to meet my maker
I feel sole and alone like a heretic
I'm ready to meet my maker
Lazarus has got no dirt on me
Lazarus has got no dirt on me
And I'll rise every danger
I'm the Mephistopheles of Los Angeles
Of Los Angeles

I was fated, faithful, fatal
I was fated, faithful, fatal

I feel sole and alone like a heretic
And I'm ready to meet my maker
I feel sole and alone like a heretic
And I'm ready to meet my maker

I feel sole and alone like a heretic
I'm ready to meet my maker
I feel sole and alone like a heretic
I'm ready to meet my maker
Lazarus has got no dirt on me
Lazarus has got no dirt on me
And I'll rise every danger
I'm the Mephistopheles of Los Angeles
Of Los Angeles
I'm the Mephistopheles of Los Angeles
