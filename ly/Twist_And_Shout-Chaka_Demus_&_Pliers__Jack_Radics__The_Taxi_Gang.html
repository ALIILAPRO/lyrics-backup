		  Have mercy one time, look sweet 
Whoa, now now now now, darling, yeah 
Like true 
Come on, come on, come on, come on, yes now 
Yeah, oh

Well, come on, now baby (sweet sweet) 
Oh, honey, twist and shout (twist and shout) 
Come on, come on, come on, come on baby, now, now (come on, baby) 
We can work it on out (work it on out) 
You know you twist so good (twist so good) 
Wonderful 
You know, you twist so fine, yes (twist so fine) 
Come on, twist a little closer now (little bit closer) 
And show the world you're mine (world you're mine) 

Said, I'm a moving all over 
Oh, the weight is on my shoulder 
Girl, if you can't be my lover 
Oh, what would I do 
Girl, I'm talking, I'm talking, I'm talking, I'm talking, I'm talking 

Take it down, take it down 
Me bawl 
Just keep on moving, baby 
Yes, me love the way you work up your body 
Me say, when I'm lonely 
Me bawl 
Woman you make me feel happy 
Come now 
Get up, get up and move your body 
One time 
Say this a-woman like a bright star a shine 
Me bawl 
Gimme, gimme, me say, two time 
Have mercy, a wonders and sign 
Just keep on moving baby 
Because your body lazy
Come now, get up, get up, and show me, baby 
Come now, twist and turn and move up your body 
Me bawl, me bawl, me bawl, me bawl 

Well now, now, now, now baby (come on, baby) 
Hey, honey twist and shout (twist and shout) 
Come on, come on, come on, come on baby, Lord (come on, baby) 
We can work it on out (work it on out) 
You know, you twist so fine (twist so fine) 
You know you twist so good, girl (twist so good) 
Come on a little bit closer, baby (little bit closer) 
Show the world you're mine, Lord (world you're mine) 

Oh, I don't wanna wait in vain 
When I love you, it's a shame 
Oh darling, will you, please call out my name 
Oh, up the street or down the lane 
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you 

Me bawl
Get up, get up and move your body, one time 
Say this a-woman like a bright star a shine 
Come
Gimme, gimme, me say two time 
Have mercy a wonders and sign 
Woman, you're driving me crazy 
Me love the way you move up your body 
Me say when I'm lonely 
Woman, you make me feel happy 
Me love the way you move up your body 
Get up, get up and move your body, one time 
Say this a-woman like a bright star a shine 
Me bawl 
Gimme, gimme me say, two time 
Have mercy a wonders and sign 
Me bawl, me bawl 

Shake it up, baby, Lord (shake it up, baby) 
Come on and twist and shout (twist and shout)
Come on, come on, come on, come on, baby(come on, baby)
