		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Keep climbing into my head without knockin'
And you fix yourself there like a map pin
On this ghost of this street where I'm livin'
I'm in a chrysalis and I'm snowed in

Darling, darling that dam's gonna give
It's inevitable the way that you live
Bottles in brown paper and a mouth that slurs
All the shit that it stirs
Let that dogwood blossom

There'll be hell to pay in heaven
For you take every street home

What happens when you're into deep to break
Loneliness keeps you constantly awake
What happens when the passage of time appears 
You see yourself as a child and it brings you to tears

You say that you're troubled and you always have been
Uncomfortable in your own skin
So you contemplate the riverbed
Turn off the dark thoughts in your head

Darling, darling that dam's gonna give
It's inevitable the way that you live
Bottles in brown paper and a mouth that slurs
All the shit that it stirs
Let that dogwood blossom

There'll be hell to pay in heaven
For you take every street home
