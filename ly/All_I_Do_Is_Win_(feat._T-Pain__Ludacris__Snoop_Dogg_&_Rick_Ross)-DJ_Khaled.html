		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  D-J Khaled
Hey, yeah (we the best)

All I do is win win win no matter what
Got money on my mind I can never get enough
And every time I step up in the buildin'
Everybody hands go up
And they stay there
And they say yeah
And they stay there
Up down, up down, up down
'Cause all I do is win win win
And if you goin' in put your hands in the air
Make 'em stay there

(Luda!)
Ludacris goin' in on the verse
Cause I never been defeated and I won't stop now
Keep your hands up get 'em in the sky for the homies
That didn't make it and the folks locked down
I never went no where
But they saying Luda's back
Blame it on that Conjure
The hood call it Luda-Yac
And I'm on this foolish track, so I spit my foolish flow
My hands go up and down like strippers booty's go
My verses still be serving, tight like a million virgins
Last time on a Khaled remix, now I'm on the original version
Can't never count me out
Y'all better count me in
Got twenty bank accounts, accountants count me in
Make millions every year, the south's champion
Cause all I do, all I, all I, all I
All I do is

All I do is win win win no matter what
Got money on my mind I can never get enough
And every time I step up in the buildin'
Everybody hands go up
And they stay there
And they say yeah
And they stay there
Up down, up down, up down
'Cause all I do is win win win
And if you goin' in put your hands in the air
Make 'em stay there

Swerving in my lo-lo,
Head on the swivel
You know serving me's a no no
Clean as a whistle as I pull out in my Rolls Royce
Yellow bone passenger they see it, they say oh boy!
Tell Khaled back it up, my niggas call me Loco
Down for armed trafficking, don't make me pull that fo-fo
Ask you what you laughing at
Represent that mud life (mud life)
Dirty money bitch you better get your mug right (mug right)
We come together holding hands and holla thug life (thug life)
We all strapped in all black
It's like fuck life
(All we do is win)
You riding or what (what!)
'Cause we riding tonight (night!)
Now she riding with me cause you wasn't ridin' her right,

All I do is win win win no matter what
Got money on my mind I can never get enough
And every time I step up in the buildin'
Everybody hands go up
And they stay there
And they say yeah
And they stay there
Up down, up down, up down
'Cause all I do is win win win
And if you goin' in put your hands in the air
Make 'em stay there

Heat in the kitchen, pot on the stove
Water getting boiled, dope being sold
Snoopy in the hoopty, system overload
I've been runnin' this rap game since I was twenty years old
I hung with the worst of 'em
Bust till I burst on 'em
Floss 'em up, toss 'em up, Hardaway, cross 'em up
Pardon me I'm bossin' up, pressure up, bless ya bruh
Don't mess with us
We like the "U" in the 80's
Back to back set a trap
Hit the lick, get it back
Hit the trick, jump the track
Bitch I want my money back
Time and time again while I'm sipping on this gin
Al Davis said it best, just win baby win

All I do is win win win no matter what
Got money on my mind I can never get enough
And every time I step up in the buildin'
Everybody hands go up
And they stay there
And they say yeah
And they stay there
Up down, up down, up down
'Cause all I do is win win win
And if you goin' in put your hands in the air
Make 'em stay there
