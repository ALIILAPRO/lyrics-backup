(Oh, yeah, Berki, this the one right here)
Uh, uh

I wrote you a love letter, hope it make our love better
Pain in her heart, I could feel it when the love left her
Death do us part, I just hope it ain't the love getter
As she depart, I just know I'll never forget her
I wrote you a love song, hope it make our love strong
Pain in her heart, I could feel it when her love gone
Just play it smart, I hope I can make our love long
So many scars, that's what comes from bein' loved wrong

Lately, I'm done stressin', can't think, I'm done beggin'
Like, bae, what's wrong with you today? Sorry, I'm done guessin'
Why would I try to build with you when you just love wreckin'?
Baby, I'm done teachin' you like you need love lessons
Done with your love, keep it, feel like you love leavin'
You say some things you know gon' hurt, then say you don't mean it
Gave you a ring and plus my heart, seem like you don't need it
Like everything just fall apart and we just done speakin'
Dreams full of my fears, I done gave you five years
Could figure I'd still be shinin' when the sky clears
It feel like love just a cycle full of dry tears
Somehow it's always surprisin' when that time nears

'Cause I wrote you a love letter, hope it make our love better
Pain in her heart, I could feel it when the love left her
Death do us part, I just hope it ain't the love getter
As she depart, I just hope I'll never forget her
I wrote you a love song, hope it make our love long
Pain in her heart, I could feel it when her love gone
Just play it smart, I hope I can make our love strong
So many scars, that's what comes from bein' loved wrong, oh

So many thoughts in my head
No, I ain't never think she would leave me hopeless
Went through some things all by myself, hopin' that she would notice
Go through that phase, think how I felt, and that's what keep me focused
Heart feelin' strange like when you left, that's when I seen my lowest
Love when I watch you leave, hate when I see her goin'
Search for that broken piece, fuck it, I leave it open
Wrote you this melody, I hope you hear this poem
I had to set you free, feel like you still stolen
No, you can't see me fallin', gave you a pinky promise
I know you still put down your phone like you don't see me callin'
I tried to show you my emotions, you don't see that often
I should've known to take it slow, proceed with caution

'Cause I wrote you a love letter, hope it make our love better
Pain in her heart, I could feel it when the love left her
Death do us part, I just hope it ain't the love getter
As she depart, I just hope I'll never forget her
I wrote you a love song, hope it make our love long
Pain in her heart, I could feel it when her love gone
Just play it smart, I hope I can make our love strong
So many scars, that's what comes from bein' love wrong, oh
