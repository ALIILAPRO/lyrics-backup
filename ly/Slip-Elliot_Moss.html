		  Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa

I won't keep watching you
Dance around in your smoke
And flicker out
You're not the light I used to know
I don't believe in safety nets
Strung below that make it alright
To let go
You gotta hold on

Or it's gonna
Slip, slip, slip through your
Slip, slip, slip through your hands
Whoa, whoa, whoa

Or it's gonna
Slip, slip, slip through your
Slip, slip, slip through your hands
Whoa, whoa, whoa

Or it's gonna
Slip, slip, slip through your
Slip, slip, slip through your hands
Whoa, whoa, whoa

What's the matter?
You don't have enough rain
To make up your storm?
Oooh whatcha look so sad for?
Where's the light I used to know?

Oh it's gonna
Slip, slip, slip through your
Slip, slip, slip through your hands
Whoa, whoa, whoa

Oh it's gonna
Slip, slip, slip through your
Slip, slip, slip through your hands
Whoa, whoa, whoa

Where's that light I used to know?
Where's that light I used to know?
Where's that light I used to know?
Where's the light I used to know?
Slip, slip, slip through your hands
Whoa, whoa, whoa

Oh it's gonna
Slip, slip, slip through your
Slip, slip, slip through your hands
Whoa, whoa, whoa

Oh it's gonna
Slip, slip, slip through your
Slip, slip, slip through your hands
Whoa, whoa, whoa

Oh it's gonna
Slip, slip, slip through your
Slip, slip, slip through your hands
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
