		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Never thought you'd make me perspire
Never thought I'd do you the same
Never thought I'd fill with desire
Never thought I'd feel so ashamed

Me and the dragon can chase all the pain away
So before I end my day  remember
My sweet prince  you are the one
My sweet prince
You are the one

Never thought I'd have to retire
Never thought I'd have to abstain
Never thought all this could back fire
Close up the hole in my vain

Me and my valuable friend
Can fix all the pain away
So before I end my day, remember
My sweet prince
You are the one
My sweet prince
You are the one
You are the one
You are the one
You are the one
You are the one

Never thought I'd get any higher
Never thought you'd fuck with my brain
Never thought all this could expire
Never thought you'd go break the chain

Me and you baby
Still flush all the pain away
So before I end my day, remember
My sweet prince
You are the one
My sweet prince
You are the one
You are the one
You are the one
You are the one
You are the one
You are the one
You are the one
You are the one
You are the one
My sweet prince
My sweet prince
