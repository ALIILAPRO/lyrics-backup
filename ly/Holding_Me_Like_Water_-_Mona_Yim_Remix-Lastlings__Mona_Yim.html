		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm in a new life again
Who will you become?
When I'm not there again 
I hope that you'll want me back 

Only you can 
Set me free 
All the nights I've been here waiting 
Follow me 
You're the only one that can make me feel this way 
Make me feel this way 

I never wanna give you up 
But you're holding me like water 
Been looking for you all my life
But your letting me slip away slip away 
And I don't ever wanna give you up 
But you're holding me like water 
Been looking for you all my life
But your letting me slip away slip away slip away 

I want you in my life again
This is all too much 
I wanna feel alive again 
My hearts holding on 

Only you can 
Set me free 
All the nights I've been here waiting 
Follow me 
You're the only one that can make me feel this way 
Make me feel this way 

I never wanna give you up 
But you're holding me like water 
Been looking for you all my life
But you're letting me slip away slip away 
And I don't ever wanna give you up 
But you're holding me like water 
Been looking for you all my life
But you're letting me slip away slip away slip away 

I wanna spend my life with you
I know that we can make it through
I wanna spend my life with you 
I wanna spend my life with you 


I never wanna give you up 
But you're holding me like water 
Been looking for you all my life
But you're letting me slip away slip away 
And I don't ever wanna give you up 
But you're holding me like water 
Been looking for you all my life
But you're letting me slip away slip away slip away 

Been looking for you all my life
But you're letting me slip away slip away slip away
