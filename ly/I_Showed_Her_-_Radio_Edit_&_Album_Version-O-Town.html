		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  t's catching up to me right now
Everything that I said
The night I left her there
When I said I wanted out
I was angry and upset
And at the time I could care less about staying there
I had to prove I didn't care
As much as she thought I did

Chorus:
I showed her
I let my pride take me
Far away from the only woman I loved
I showed her
And now she has found someone new
And her life will go on
And I'm all alone
But I showed her

Oh oh oh

I hate that she's in love
But it took a while for her to get over the hurt
Now I know that I messed up
I was trying to give us time
But I see she took that time to find somebody else
What happened to the things she felt for me
Am I really a part of her past

Chorus:
I showed her
I let my pride take me far away
From the only woman I loved
I showed her
And now she has found someone new
And her life will go on
And I'm all alone
But I showed her

Woah oh oh

Chorus:
I showed her
I let my pride take me far away
From the only woman I loved
I showed her
And now she has found someone new
And her life will go on
And I'm all alone
But I showed her

I showed her
And now she has found someone new
And her life will go on
And I'm all alone
But I showed her

Whoa oh
I showed her
I showed her
