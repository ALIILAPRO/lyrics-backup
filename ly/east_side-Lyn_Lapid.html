		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We'll call when we get the chance
When the tide is low again
I'll ask you, "Hey, how you doin'?"
You say, "You're just short of ruin"
Okay, let's go for a drive
Roll up in your car or mine
We'll both get so sentimental
We know it's all confidential

And I've been thinking as of lately
I love that I don't have to call you on the daily
'Cause in the end we're gonna be just fine

I'll catch you on the east side (east side)
I'll love you through the state lines (state lines)
I'll keep you on the rewind (rewind)

I'll catch you on the- (east side)
I'll catch you on the- (east side)
I'll catch you on the-

It was never your home up in Columbia, Maryland (ah)
Same time, are you missing it?
But I know now why you left our town
I was driving you crazy
Crying in your dad's Mercedes
You left so fast, so innately, baby

I'll catch you on the east side (east side)
I'll love you through the state lines (state lines)
I'll keep you on the rewind (rewind)

I'll catch you on the- (east side)
I'll catch you on the- (east side)
I'll catch you on the-
East side (east side, east side)
Hey, yeah 

I'll catch you on the east side, east side
I'll love you through the state lines, state lines
I'll keep you on the rewind, rewind
I'll catch you on the-, I'll catch you on the-
