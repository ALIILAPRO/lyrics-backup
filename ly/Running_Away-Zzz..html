		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, when you play (Uh, play)

When you play this, play this song
It means you hate love
'cause it did you wrong
It means you ain't one to play
Around with these bitches hearts
It means your heart's wide open
'til she tears it apart
I've been rollin' up all this wood
I'ma smoke it good
Every other night, another girl
Just 'cause I know I could
Maybe I'm just getting to my head
That's why she in my bed
The second that I start feelin' alive
They prolly want me dead
Uh, yeah, that's just how life goes
'Cause boy, you're nothin' if you ain't
Turn into somethin'
I swear this music is the
Reason I ain't strugglin'
I take my problems and I
Turn 'em into somethin'
I've been running away

Run away, run away, run away
Run away, run away, run away
Yeah, I've been runnin' away, oh oh oh woah
Yeah, I've been runnin' away
I've been runnin' away, uh, ayy
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah

And tell my exes
My music better than them in the first place
My music never fuckin' hurts me
In the worst ways
You terrorize me and you put
Me in the worst place
You had the walls cavin' in
So I was runnin' away

Run away, run away, run away
Run away, run away, run away
Run away, run away
Runnin' away, runnin' away, runnin' away
Runnin' away

And when I left, your eyes started shaking
Knees cold, blue face, you were breaking
I knew that there was somethin'
'bout you you were fakin' without this song
I'd probably do the same thing

Run away, run away, run away
Run away, run away, run away
Yeah, I've been runnin' away, oh oh
Yeah, I've been runnin' away
I've been runnin' away, uh
