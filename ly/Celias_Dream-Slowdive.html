		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She flies
She's gone to ride an angel's breath
Gone to taste a dream
And every time I call her
A shadow crawls away
But she takes
She laughs him all [there is]
And everything she owes me
She gives
She told me that she loved me
Love, just for a day
And all the time I feel her
I feel her fade away
But she takes
She gives him all the fakes
And everything feels good
And clouds like shadows pass
She's passing like a day
She takes
She gives him all the [shadows]
And everything feels good
And clouds like shadows pass
She's passing like a day
