		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Evergreen eyes, you're telling me lies
Never felt such a low to be quiet so high
Evergreen eyes, don't sever these ties
You never do know, we never know why

You won't change the shape I'm in
You won't change the way I see
I told you once I'll say it again

Everything changes but me
Everything changes but me

Evergreen eyes, is it water or wine
Our cup ain't half empty its teeming with lies
Evergreen eyes, I've toed every line
You'll lose me to the lonely with company in mind

You won't change the shape I'm in
You won't change the way I see
I told you once I'll say it again

Everything changes but me
Everything changes but me

Evergreen eyes, you're telling me lies
