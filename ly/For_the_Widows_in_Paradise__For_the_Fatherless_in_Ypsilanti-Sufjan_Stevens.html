		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I have called you, children
I have called you, son
What is there to answer
If I'm the only one
Morning comes in Paradise
Morning comes in light
Still I must obey
Still I must invite

If there's anything to say
If there's anything to do
I there's any other way
I'll do anything for you

I was dressed in embarrassment
I was dressed in white
If you had a part of me
Will you take your time
Even if I come back
Even if I die
Is there some idea
To replace my life

Like a father to impress
Like a mother's mourning dress
If we ever make a mess 
I'll do anything for you

I have called you, preacher
I have called you, son
If you have a father
Or if you haven't one

I'll do anything for you
I'll do anything for you
I'll do anything for you
I'll do anything for you

I did everything for you
I did everything for you
I did everything for you
I did everything for you

I did everything for you
I did everything for you
I did everything for you
I did everything for you
