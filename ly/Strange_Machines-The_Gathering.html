		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It has always been in the back of my mind
Dreaming about going to the corners of time
I always wanted to fly in strange machines

I want to do centuries in a lifetime
And feel it with my hands
Touch the world war II and Cleopatra
Flying

Could it be that my dream would come true
Building a machine that would actually do
What i want it to do

Russian revolution, let's do that in one day
Beethoven and Gershwin i think that would be o.k.
More than anything i want to fly in strange machines

I want to do centuries in a lifetime
And see it with my eyes
Watch Jesus rise, if he ever did
Flying

I want to do centuries in a lifetime
And feel it with my hands
Touch renaissance and Chaka Khan
Flying
