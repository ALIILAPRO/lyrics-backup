		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Some folks like to get away
Take a holiday from the neighborhood
Hop a flight to Miami Beach or to Hollywood
But I'm takin' a Greyhound on the Hudson River line
I'm in a New York state of mind

I've seen all the movie stars
In their fancy cars and their limousines
Been high in the Rockies under the evergreens
I know what I'm needin'
And I don't want to waste more time
I'm in a New York state of mind

It was so easy livin' day by day
Out of touch with the rhythm and blues
But now I need a little give and take
The New York Times, the Daily News

It comes down to reality
And it's fine with me 'cause I've let it slide
I don't care if it's Chinatown or on Riverside
I don't have any reasons
I left them all behind
I'm in a New York state of mind
Oh, yeah

It was so easy living day by day
Out of touch with the rhythm and blues
But now I need a little give and take
The New York Times, the Daily News
Who, oh, oh whoa, who

It comes down to reality
And it's fine with me 'cause I've let it slide
I don't care if it's Chinatown or on Riverside
I don't have any reasons
I left them all behind
I'm in a New York state of mind

I'm just taking a Greyhound on the Hudson River line
'Cause I'm in a, I'm in a New York state of mind, yea
