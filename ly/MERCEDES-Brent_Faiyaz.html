		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You don't really wanna be my lady (you don't, you don't)
You know it's more than just drivin' Mercedes (more than Mercedes)
These hoes gon' call and drive you crazy (they gon' drive you crazy)
They just tryna f- and have my baby
My block too hot to have a lady (my block too hot)
All these detectives stay investigatin' (investigatin')
Play it smart, no hesitatin' (no hesitation)
If they can't get to me, they'll try my baby

It's a party all night, sunlight 
(Don't want no one around when I'm comin' down) all of the good times
Goodbyes still high, still right 
It's gon' rain here all day, girl (all day long)
But we still have tomorrow

Lady, I don't know how
You know me for a month, now you wanna be my b-
(That's the shit I be talkin' 'bout)
You want me all to you, you don't know what I come with
I don't mean to put you down, but I know you're down
If you wasn't around (how do I know that?)
Maybe I'm askin' too much, you offerin' love
I don't think that's enough, mm (I'ma need more than that)

You don't really wanna be my lady (you don't, you don't)
You know it's more than just drivin' Mercedes (more than Mercedes)
These hoes gon' call and drive you crazy (they gon' drive you crazy)
They just tryna f- and have my baby
My block too hot to have a lady (my block too hot)
All these detectives stay investigatin' (investigatin')
Play it smart, no hesitatin' (no hesitation)
If they can't get to me, they'll try my baby (my baby)

It's a party all night, sunlight (let it out)
(Don't want no one around when I'm comin' down) all of the good times
Goodbyes still high, still right 
It's gon' rain here all day, girl (all day long)
But we still have tomorrow

This shit ain't nothin' new, yeah
I got too much I could lose
Gotta be careful who you choose
'Cause this ain't like the life you had with your old dude
And if you don't like bein' alone at night (yeah, yeah)
Then maybe I'm not your type

You don't really wanna be my lady (you don't, you don't) (oh, no, no, no)
You know it's more than just drivin' Mercedes (more than Mercedes)
These hoes gon' call and drive you crazy (they gon' drive you crazy)
They just tryna f- and have my baby (my baby)
My block too hot to have a lady (my block too hot)
All these detectives stay investigatin' (investigatin')
Play it smart, no hesitatin' (no hesitation)
If they can't get to me, they'll try my baby (my baby)
