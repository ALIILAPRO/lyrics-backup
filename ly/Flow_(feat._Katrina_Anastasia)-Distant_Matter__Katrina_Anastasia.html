		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The flow, the flow, the flow, the floor, the flow, the flow,
Time's been passing by I savor every second, my oh my
Movin' like a rockstar on my grind there's so much I've been tied to just let me fly
And get caught up in the flow, caught up in the, caught up in the flow
Caught up in the, the flow
Caught up in the, caught up in the flow
I've been feelin' a vibe, I'm lost in the light
Look back on my life, I don't see the red lights anymore
I'm keepin' it tight, My energy's high
The time is tickin', tickin' slow and I'm caught up in the flow
Caught up in the, the flow, caught up in the, caught up in the flow
Caught up in the, the flow caught up in the, the flow
I've been feelin' a vibe, I'm lost in the light
Look back at my life, I don't see the red lights anymore
I'm keepin' it tight, My energy's high
The time is tickin', tickin' slow and I'm caught up in the flow
Caught up in the, the floor caught up in the, the floor
