		  (If it's Spax then it's gotta be a)

Ay, ooh, you been grinding so long
Blood, sweat, and tears that I spill on this song
I put my heart and my soul, shining
This road ain't paved with no diamonds and gold (gold)
Far from the end of the show (show)
Seeking me round of applause
Identify with the ghost
I hit the five and I flow

Shawty, you know that I been rolling (rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling)
Ooh, it's hard to fight this feeling
I been rolling (rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling)
Can't deny my love for you
I been rolling (rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling)
Ooh, it's hard to fight this feeling
I been rolling (rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling)
Rolling (yeah, uh)

Say goodbye to the road, put the game in a twist
Put my words in your heart, put my name on your lips
Say goodbye to the pain, took a flight through the flames
And somehow we made it out, so we fight to remain
But I been rolling, flowing, dipping in toes in waters that were cold
And no matter how the pressure grows, I know you wouldn't fold
Took a while for you to get here but you made it on your own
Other pies cannot decipher your accession to the thrown, oh Lord
All the times that I was so lost
My years in the wilderness, didn't know that you would show up
But if you know us, you know it's real
And if you roll up, we smoking still
The money slow up, e go reveal
The people will chill or those who fade (fade)
And they can't even hide it 'cause it's written on their face
We made it out the trenches, man, there's really no debate
We made it off the benches, brought adventure to the game, we been rolling

(Rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling)
Ooh, it's hard to fight this feeling
I been rolling (rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling)
Can't deny my love for you
I been rolling (rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling)
Ooh, it's hard to fight this feeling
I been rolling (rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling)
Rolling

Another night and working deep and hit the sheets
Another hit is like a fiend, it is what I need
She treated me like a machine, lack of sleep
I be neglecting all her needs, I know it hurt
Doing this for you and me, I seen it first
It's the feeling when you're dealing with a real boss (real boss)
I'ma stack and watch you add up like a billboard
I give myself to this game but I'm still yours
Yeah, I'm still rolling
It, it didn't mean the way you say it
Feel I wanna take the time
It, it, it
It didn't mean the way you say it
Feel I wanna take the time
Oh-oh-oh

We're ten toes, touching road, it's been a hell of a road
Living life by the code, gotta reap what you sow
Seeing friends turn foes and dreams turned into goals
While these LCC streets keep taking toll
From concrete grew a rose, flood my soul with this bitch
Then became a rapper's rapper, guess you are what you eat
My girl would spark a leaf 'til we'd coast like the pacific
She asked for vitamin D, I'd open up the clinic, wait
Flash back, love those, but I'm not one to backtrack
Gotta hustle to build stock on Binance
Now look, we got fans way out in Taiwan by moving like a triad
You know one of my favorite colors happen to be lilac
That's royalty (that's royalty)
But what I value above all else is loyalty
So when I shine, you shine most notably, see

Shawty, you know that I been rolling
Girl, I been rolling
Oh, I been rolling
I been rolling, rolling
Ohh
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, da
Ha-ha, ha-ha
Ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha
