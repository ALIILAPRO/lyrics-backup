		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You can fall so easily, like in a song
When it moves you and it seems like nothing's wrong
And you realize the feeling that you feel is gonna grow
You're gonna let somebody, let somebody go

She can see it in your eyes what's gonna come
He is crying when you tell him what you've done
And it breaks your heart, you never thought that you would be the one
To let somebody, let somebody go

When you let somebody know you're not gonna be around
You want it to be fine, it hurts to let somebody down
Tears come down your face
And you wonder if you'll ever know
How to let somebody, let somebody go

Time will pass and he will soon move on
Things are gonna change now that you're gone
She will never realize you regret what you have done
When you let somebody, let somebody go

When you let somebody know you're not gonna be around
You want him to be fine, it hurts to let somebody down
Tears come down your face
And you wonder if you'll ever know
How to let somebody, let somebody go

Pages are turning
Bridges are burning
But you're never learning
How to break somebody's heart
Maybe the next time
You'll be the one

When you let somebody know you're not gonna be around
You want her to be fine, it hurts to let somebody down
When you let somebody know you're not gonna be around
You want him to be fine, it hurts to let somebody down
Tears come down your face
And you wonder if you'll ever know
How to let somebody, let somebody go

When the sun rises again
And you lie there wondering when you'll know
How to let somebody, let somebody go
