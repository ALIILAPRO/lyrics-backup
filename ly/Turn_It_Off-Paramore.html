		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I scraped my knees while I was praying
And found a demon in my safest haven, seems like
It's getting harder to believe in anything
Then just to get lost in all my selfish thoughts
I wanna know what it'd be like
To find perfection in my pride
To see nothing in the light
But turn it off
In all my spite
In all my spite
I'll turn it off

And the worst part is
Before it gets any better
We're headed for a cliff
And in the free fall I will realize
I'm better off when I hit the bottom

The tragedy, it seems unending
I'm watching everyone I looked up to break and bending
We're taking shortcuts and false solutions
Just to come out the hero
Well, I can see behind the curtain (I can see now)
The wheels are cranking, turning, so on the way we're working
Towards a goal, that's non existent
It's not existent, but we just keep believing

And the worst part is
Before it gets any better
We're headed for a cliff
And in the free fall I will realize
I'm better off when I hit the bottom

I wanna know what it'd be like
To find perfection in my pride
To see nothing in the light
But turn it off
In all my spite
In all my spite
I'll turn it off
Just turn it off

Again
Again

And the worst part is
Before it gets any better
We're headed for a cliff
And in the free fall I will realize
I'm better off when I hit the bottom

And the worst part is
Before it gets any better
We're headed for a cliff
And in the free fall I will realize
I'm better off when I hit the bottom
