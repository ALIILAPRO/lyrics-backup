		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  From the hot strobe lights and the spiked punch bliss
And the long walks home in the dark we'll miss
Nobody teaches you how to reminisce
Nobody teaches you to hurt like this

Then we slide into the arms of someone else
Yeah, we slide into the arms of someone else

No more coked up, broke, nocturnal kids
Was that ever even us? Do we know what we missed?
Nobody teaches you how to win big
Nobody said there's no reverse on this

Then we slide into the arms of someone else
Yeah, we slide into the arms of someone else
In disguise, we get a little better at controlling ourselves around midnight
Then we slide into the arms of someone else

Nobody wants to, nobody wants to
Nobody wants to, nobody wants to
Nobody wants to wake up alone

Then we slide into the arms of someone else
Then we slide into the arms of someone else
In disguise, we get a little better at controlling ourselves around midnight
But then we slide into the arms of some, someone else

The weight of the world is love
Under the burden of solitude, under the burden of dissatisfaction the weight
The weight we carry is love
And so must rest in the arms of love at last, must rest in the arms of love
