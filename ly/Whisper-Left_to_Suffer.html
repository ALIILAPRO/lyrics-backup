		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I’m counting the days 
Since my brains went dead 
Led to gruesome fate 
What to do i have to lose 
Confined in the walls of my breathing 
Washing down the hate 
I’m praying now for a world wiped clean 
Artificial, I’m made to feel 
I can’t escape 

Bleeding me dry and left to suffer 
Control the urge, nothing can stop me but it’s everything that you have ever wanted 
Look me in the eyes and tell me we’re free 

You can’t take it back 
And I’ve had enough 
Watch your back, slit your throat like the dead weight 
I know the slates been wiped clean 

I know you’re hurt 
So do your worst 

Scattering amongst the ground like rats 
Scurrying trying to find something to counteract 
The pain is burning it’s hole 
The face of death haunts me in my sleep 

Hold me close even if it’s only for a day 
You’re in good hands 
I know this all just fantasy oh 

So when can I expect to feel 
I’m tired of living in a nightmare 
The hand I’ve dealt is fucked 

But I’m counting the days 
Since my brains went dead 
Led to gruesome fate 
What to do i have to lose 
Confined in the walls of my breathing 
Washing down the hate 
I’m praying now for a world wiped clean 
Artificial, I’m made to feel 
I can’t escape 

You don’t have what it takes to survive 
In endless pain
You come slithering back 
I know it’s come it’s time to pay for your spineless feelings 
Before, they all become smart to all behind the meaning 

Fly through the voids of darkness 
As we hear the whisper of a thousand cries 
Love is only complete when blessed by death
