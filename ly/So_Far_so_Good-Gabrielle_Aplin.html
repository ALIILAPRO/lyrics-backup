		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I didn’t notice you
I was preoccupied
There was a crowd around
And I didn’t like you
No lie, but you won me over with your smile
Better late than never
Better late than never
I listened to your songs
You talked your way through mine
Thought you were arrogant
But then you read my mind
When you said
“This is lame should we both go back to mine?”
Better late than never
Better late than never

We’ve come so far
And so far its been out of sight
We’ve come so far, and so far it’s been what I like
We’ve come so far
And so far so good
So good, so good, so good, so good

Far we, are we, are we
Yeah we’ve come so far
Are we, are we, are we
Driving a Ferrari
Are we are we?
Cause we’ve come so far we, are we?
We’ve come so far
And so far its been out of sight
We’ve come so far, and so far it’s been what I like
We’ve come so far
And so far so good
So good, so good, so good, so good 
It was a crowded room
And you were hard to find
You said I light it up
And I then I rolled my eyes
No lie, then you kissed me and you blew my mind
Better late than never
Better late than never  
Now all I know is you
And after all this time I can’t even imagine  A world without you No lie
Cause you’re so good, so good, so good, so good

Far we, are we, are we
Yeah we’ve come so far
Are we, are we, are we
Driving a Ferrari
Are we are we?
Cause we’ve come so far we, are we?
We’ve come so far
And so far its been out of sight
We’ve come so far, and so far it’s been what I like
We’ve come so far
And so far so good
So good, so good, so good, so good

We’ve come so far
And so far it’s been out of sight
Caught me off guard
I blinked and I realised
This is forever
How lucky am I
So good, so good, so good, so good
We’ve come so far
And so far its been out of sight
We’ve come so far, and so far it’s been what I like
We’ve come so far
And so far so good
So good, so good, so good, so good
