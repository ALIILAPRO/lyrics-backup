		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been thinking more about you lately
All the memories are driving me crazy
Although, I know I don't want your body
But I heard from a friend of a friend
Life is moving on without me
Even calling other lovers your baby
I knew that you would eventually
But it still feels strange

As I drift away
And you kiss her lips like that
Am I on your brain?
Is always a part of me, part of you
Now, baby

I still think, do you still think of us?
I still wonder, do you wanna touch?
If you could, would you still call me up?
Do you still think of us?
214 sitting back of the bus
Riding around my neighborhood
If you could, would you still call me up?
Do you still think of us?

I still think, do you still think of us?
I still wonder, do you wanna touch?
If you could, would you still call me up?
Do you still think of us?
214 sitting back of the bus
Riding around my neighborhood
If you could, would you still call me up?
Do you still think of us?

I know everything that we wanted, we'd outgrown
But still I don't, don't like knowing that you're not on your own
Can someone tell my ego 'cause she won't let me let it go
She's obsessing and guessing answers to things she'll never know, oh yeah

As I drift away
And you touch her hips like that, yeah
Am I on your brain?
Is always a part of me, part of you
Now, baby

I still think, do you still think of us?
I still wonder, do you wanna touch?
If you could, would you still call me up?
Do you still think of us?
214 sitting back of the bus
Riding around my neighborhood
If you could, would you still call me up?
Do you still think of us?

I still think, do you still think of us?
I still wonder, do you wanna touch?
If you could, would you still call me up?
Do you still think of us?
214 sitting back of the bus
Riding around my neighborhood
If you could, would you still call me up?
Do you still think of us?

I still think, do you still think of us?
I still wonder, do you wanna touch?
If you could, would you still call me up? (Would you still call me up?)
Do you still think of us?
214 sitting back of the bus
Riding around my neighborhood
If you could, would you still call me up? (Would you still call me up?)
Do you still think of us?
