		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't need the attention
I'm not shy but that's my type
You know that I'm just quiet
'Cause I'm payin' attention, oh
And when you talk I listen
Girl I need a commitment, from you, ooh
And nobody else, nobody else
I used to get so high off of love
Now I'm so scared of the distance

So won't you show me
Show me what I'm missin'
You wanna be the one?
Here's your chance, girl don't miss it
If you do me right
This won't be the only night

You think you got what it takes
Yeah, baby I don't doubt you
I see it on your face, you want me to want you
If you do me right
This won't be the only night

So won't you show me
Won't you show me
So won't you show me
Won't you show me
So won't you show me
Won't you show me
So won't you show me
Won't you show me
So won't you show me

Show me what I'm missin'
You wanna be the one?
Here's your chance, girl don't miss it
If you do me right
This won't be the only night

You think you got what it takes
And baby I don't doubt you
I see it on your face, you want me to want you
If you do me right
This won't be the only night

So won't you show me
Won't you show me
So won't you show me
Won't you show me
So won't you show me
Won't you show me
So won't you show me
Won't you show me
So won't you show me
