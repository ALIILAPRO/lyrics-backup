		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You got my heart in two
I don't know who you'll lose
When they show up
You never cover up
I wish I weren't there for you

So tell me how I'm wrong?
If I want you to tell me where you've gone
You said that I'm not there for you (you, you)
But I was there for you (you, you, you)

I wish I weren't there for you
You
I wish I weren't there for you
You
I wish I weren't there for you

Can't get you out of my head (out of my head)
'Cos you're to hard to forget (you're too hard to forget)
Push me away
And now I'm out of space
So how could I be there for you? (there for you)

So tell me how I'm wrong? (how)
If I want you to tell me where you've gone (ahh)
You said that I'm not there for you (you, you)
But I was there for you (you, you, you)

I wish I weren't there for you

So tell me how I'm wrong?
If I want you to tell me where you've gone
You said that I'm not there for you
But I was there for you
