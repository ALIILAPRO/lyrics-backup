		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Way up there's a bottle of single barrel bourbon still filled halfway
And right there on the side of the label is a faded red lipstick stain
Sitting there next to a polaroid picture in a dusty old frame
Two young lovers holding onto each other in the pourin' down rain
I keep em' on the top shelf, just a little out of reach
Where I know I can't get to them and they can't get to me
I think I oughta let em' go, cause I can't help myself
So for just a little longer, till I'm a little stronger
I keep em' on the top shelf
Way down here I mill around knowing that I'll never get another one like that
Cause the price is too high but I try to disguise what I think I'm worth inside
Scared to grab a ladder and climb up and have her cause I'm afraid it's gonna buckle on me
But the truth is though, that them both are out of my league
I keep em' on the top shelf, just a little out of reach
Where I know I can't get to them and they can't get to me
I think I oughta let em' go, cause I can't help myself
So for just a little longer, till I'm a little stronger
Yeah I keep em' on the top shelf
Woah, I keep em' on the top shelf
It's the same place, the whiskey's been aged
Same place I always see your face
I hate to see it all go to waste
It's the same place, the liquor lays and waits
Same place, you're only a call away
And I hate, I can't afford a taste
I keep em' on the top shelf, just a little out just a little out of reach
Where I know I can't get to them and they can't get to me
I think I oughta let em' go, cause I can't help myself
So for just a little longer till I'm a little stronger
Yeah for just a little longer till I'm a little stronger
I keep em' on the top shelf
I keep em' on the top shelf
Way up there's a bottle of single barrel bourbon still filled halfway
And right there on the label is a faded red lipstick stain
