		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, I broke down in East St. Louis
The Kansas City line
Drunk up all my money that I borrowed every time
And I fell down at the derby
The night's as black as a crow
It was a train that took me away from here
But a train can't bring me home
What made my dreams so hollow was standing at the depot
With a steeple full of swallows that could never ring the bell
And I've come ten thousand miles away, not one thing to show
It was a train that took me away from here
But a train can't bring me home

I remember when I left without bothering to pack
Don't you know I up and left
With just the clothes I had on my back?
Now, I'm sorry for what I've done
And I'm out here on my own
It was a train that took me away from here
But a train can't bring me home
It was a train that took me away from here
But a train can't bring me home
