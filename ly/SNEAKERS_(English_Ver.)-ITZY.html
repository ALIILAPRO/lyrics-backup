		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah
Let's go
Like what?

I'm offbeat and I like that
I dance to my own drum, drum (drum, drum)
I'm sorry if you can't handle this
But that's not my fault, no

Told ya I don't care at all
Deal with it, I'm here to stay (oh-oh)
On a different level
Don't need no guidance, I'm makin' my way

I'm on my way up (top, top)
Run to the top (ah-ooh)
I'm fly, to be straight up (alright)
Don't ya bring me down 'cause I won't stop

Call me crazy, call me trouble
Or you can call me weirdo
I'ma make this clear though
I got all I need to make it through
It's all about that attitude
You know what I'm saying
(Aight)

Put my sneakers on
Tie 'em up, ready, get set, go
Put my sneakers on
Put 'em up, put 'em up (yeah, yeah)
Put my sneakers on
Tie 'em up, ready, get set, go
You know I'm making moves ya, ya
Put 'em up, put 'em up (yeah, yeah)

Rocking up to the track
Stand up, stand up
Ain't no holding me back
Don't stop, don't stop
Get loose, come take a step in my shoes (this is my youth)

Party's getting started
I only walked through the door (oh-oh)
Trailer's got you pumped yeah
My best is yet to come

Call me crazy, call me trouble
Or you can call me weirdo
I'ma make this clear though (oh-oh)
I got all I need to make it through
It's all about that attitude
You know what I'm saying
(Aight)

Put my sneakers on
Tie 'em up, ready, get set, go
Put my sneakers on (that's right)
Put 'em up, put 'em up (yeah, yeah)
Put my sneakers on
Tie 'em up, ready, get set, go (get set, go)
You know I'm making moves ya, ya
Put 'em up, put 'em up (yeah, yeah)

I don't run for no one else
I'm only running for myself
Don't care now (hey, hey)
Me against the open road
I wanna follow where it goes
Start right now

Yeah, alright (alright)
No sweat, hey, that's how I ride (yeah)
Don't worry 'bout it, 'cause you know I
Put my sneakers on

Call me crazy, call me trouble
Or you can call me weirdo
I'ma make this clear though
I got all I need to make it through
It's all about that attitude
You know what I'm saying
You better put your sneakers on!

Put my sneakers on
Tie 'em up, ready, get set, go
Put my sneakers on
Put 'em up, put 'em up (yeah, yeah)
Put my sneakers on (put 'em up now)
Tie 'em up, ready, get set, go
You know I'm making moves ya, ya
Put 'em up, put 'em up (yeah, yeah)

I don't run for no one else
I'm only running for myself
Don't care now (hey, hey)
Me against the open road
I wanna follow where it goes
Start right now

Yeah, alright (alright)
No sweat, hey, that's how I ride (yeah)
If you want, you can ride shotgun (oh-oh)
Put 'em up, put 'em up (yeah, yeah)
