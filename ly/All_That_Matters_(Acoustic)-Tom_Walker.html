		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She said, "I was young once, darlin'
I never gave up
I've seen trouble come through my door
Rain poured down like there's no tomorrow
Raised three children in the same room
And 30 years later, helped raise you
I watched him run out, he ain't come back
But that's just life, and I can't change that"

"Darlin', trouble comes and trouble goes
But Tom, you really ought to know"

"That love is all that matters in the end
Can't spend your money when you're dead
Can't live this life again
Yeah, it's messed up, but we got love
'Least we got love
That's all that matters in the end
Can't spend your money when you're dead
Can't live this life again
Yeah, it's messed up, but we got love
'Least we got love
That's all that matters in the end
That's all that matters in the end"

She said, "You can stay tough, darlin'
It runs in your blood
There were nights that I never slept
The world weighed heavy upon my chest
I took on cancer and I raved through
11 years later, still with you
So don't you ever give up on hope
'Cause you might break, but you won't stay broke"

"And darlin', trouble comes and trouble goes
But Tom, you really ought to know

"That love is all that matters in the end
Can't spend your money when you're dead
Can't live this life again
Yeah, it's messed up, but we got love
'Least we got love
That's all that matters in the end
Can't spend your money when you're dead
Can't live this life again
Yeah, it's messed up, but we got love
'Least we got love
That's all that matters in the end"

I said, "I swear I'm gonna do you proud," oh oh, oh oh
Hold on to all this love I found
When I'm old, I'll say the same things to my kids
Give 'em what you gave me
I'll tell 'em everything you said

That love is all that matters in the end
Can't spend your money when you're dead
Can't live this life again
Yeah, it's messed up, but we got love
'Least we got love
That's all that matters in the end
Can't spend your money when you're dead
Can't live this life again
Yeah, it's messed up, but we got love
'Least we got love
That's all that matters
Yeah, it's messed up, but we got love
'Least we got love
That's all that matters in the end
That's all that matters in the end
