		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do you know how it feels to be me?
I can't help it, you don't understand
There's a place that I go
When I'm low
I get so high, I don't ever land

I swear I didn't want this
It was my only option (only option)
I'll do better, I promise
Earn all of your trust, I'll be honest (honest)
I can't dig any deeper
I already hit rock bottom (bottom, bottom)
And I can't make excuses
I know I'm the problem
I know I'm the problem

Do you know how it feels to be me?
I can't help it, you don't understand
There's a place that I go
When I'm low
I get so high, I don't ever land

Do you know how it feels to be me?
I can't help it
You don't know how it feels to be me
