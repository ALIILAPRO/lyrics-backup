		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I won't say goodbye
In the end, it won't matter at all
I'm sure
I won't survive the fall

Wear your tears like jewelry
That vice is overpriced but
Art is dead, it died with me
Don't cry

Just let me drown
Let me drown
Let me dive in
Sink in deeper
Push my head
Choke me 'til I drown
Let me drown

Drifting out of trust
Slipping down my throat
Into my lungs
It's cold but this where I'll stay
Comfortably in pain

Wear your tears like jewelry
That vice is overpriced but
Art is dead it died with me
Don't cry

Just let me drown
Let me drown
Let me dive in
Sink in deeper
Push my head
Choke me 'til I drown

Like a machine every day I'm on hold
Breathe in, breathe out
I keep on waiting, tearing at my will
I wish I would just stop

Let me drown
Let me drown
Let me dive in
Sink in deeper
Push my head
Choke me 'til I drown

Let me drown
Let me drown
Let me dive in
Sink in deeper
Push my head
Choke me 'til I drown

Let me drown
