		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Got a lot on my mental 
City dying off fentanyl 
Can’t put my dogs in a kennel
Slide by 5 deep in a rental 

Windows down 
Better duck right now
You hear the sound 
They let it go

Come around 
Faded off the brown 
She feel me now
I can’t take it slow 

Got it on my waistline
Yeah
No I don’t waste time
No
Hit her on the face time 
Yeah
But she want face time
No 

So baby wtf we gonna do
Cuz I think that I just got over you

I don’t wanna lie 
You should slide 
Make me feel alive 
Got one to my left and my right 
Double suicide
Doors they open wide when i walk thru 
Had them paralyzed 
She’s gon’ catch this vibe 
Bump n ride
Keep you on my side 

Lil baby gon’ pull up to the function 
You can bring a friend girl 
Tell her she can trust me
She said that I’m evil 
Never said I wasn’t 
Wrist flooded 
Lipstick bloody 
Smoke puffin 
Whip studded 
Keep it one hunnid 
Know I beat it up til I’m outta time 
Yeah you should slide 

Slide thru 
Girl I know some things that we can do 
Keep it true 
I like when she rude 
Put me in the mood 
Love the way that your body moves 
Please don’t make me choose 
So baby please slide thru

Hit me so I had to slide thru 
When I get lost it leads back to you 
And I neglect everything that i had to do 
Yeah

Slide back to the crib
You’ll see in the place
Everything I had to work for 
I know I’m ahead of the race
And we 40 floors up 
But I think I need little more 

Almost at the end of our glass 
That we both just sip too fast 
The AMC crew is here to stay 
Ain’t hittin’ no brakes 
We only hittin’ the gas 

How you look so pretty in the cut 
I really got you out here choosin’ up 
Don’t let these fake dudes 
Try to misguide you 
You know ya boy the only one to confide to 

I don’t wanna lie 
You should slide 
Make me feel alive 
Got one to my left and my right 
Double suicide
Doors they open wide when i walk thru 
Had them paralyzed 
She’s gon’ catch this vibe 
Bump n ride
Keep you on my side 

Slide thru 
Girl I know some things that we can do 
Keep it true 
I like when she rude 
Put me in the mood 
Love the way that your body moves 
Please don’t make me choose 
So baby please slide thru
