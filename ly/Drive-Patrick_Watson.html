		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Drive, drive, drive, drive
You want to drive all night
Follow the yellow lines
Don't stop or look behind
And you don't want to know where you're going
Just want to get lost sometimes together
Drive, drive, drive, drive
Get lost together

Ah
Ah
Ah

Want to get lost?
You don't want to know where you're going
Stepping through a hallway of trees
Getting lost to nowhere's good to me
Wild eyes in the high, high beams
Staring back at me

Into endless night

Wild eyes staring back at me
Wild eyes staring back at me
Wild eyes staring back at me
