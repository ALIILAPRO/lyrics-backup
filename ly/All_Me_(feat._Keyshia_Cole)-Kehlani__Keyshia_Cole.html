		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When you see him, know that's all me
When you see him, know that's all me
When you see him, know that that's all me right there

Never had a moment
Where I ever questioned ya, questioned ya
You already know that
I ain't never stressed with ya, stressed with ya
Love me and you own that, uh
That's why I'm so impressed with ya, blessed with ya
If you haven't noticed, I am at my best with ya, best with ya, yeah

Yeah, they know you're my heart, yeah, they know I'm about you
I hate when we're apart, 'cause I love me around you
Embraced all my flaws, when you didn't have to
Stay holdin' me down, even when I'm not around

When you see him, know that's all me
When you see him, know that's all me
When you see him, know that that's all me right there
When you see him, know that's all me
When you see him, know that's all me
When you see him, know that that's all me right there

You know that I'm a movement, yeah
Movement all by myself
But lovin' every minute, yeah
Every minute that we share
I've been in my bag with you (bag with you)
They know I ain't playin 'bout you (playin' 'bout you)
I been eatin' right and sleepin' through the night
For the first time in a long time

That's why you know you're my heart (my heart)
Yeah, you know I'm about you (I'm so about you)
I hate when we're apart
'Cause I love me around you (can't be without you)
And embraced all my flaws, even when you didn't have too
Stay holdin' me down, even when I'm not around

When you see him, know that's all me
When you see him, know that's all me (when you see him)
When you see him, know that that's all me right there (right there)
When you see him, know that's all me
When you see him, know that's all me
When you see him, know that that's all me right there

All me, all me, all me
When you see him, yeah, you see all me
When you walk by, that walk's all me
That talk's all me, yeah, all, all, me
All me, all me, all me
When you see him, yeah, you see all me
When you walk by, that walk's all me
That talk's all me, that's all me

When you see him, know that's all me
When you see him, know that's all me
When you see him, know that that's all me right there
When you see him, know that's all me
When you see him, know that's all me
When you see him, know that that's all me right there
