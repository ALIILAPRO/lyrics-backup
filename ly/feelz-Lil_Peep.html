		  (Cowabunga, dude)

I love you to the summer and back
It's not the winter, but you've frozen my heart
And got me warmin' up my liver
I would never put a knife in your back
The love I give her is kinda creepy, but fuck it
She orders and I deliver
I could never leave you alone
My little mama is mad at me at the moment
Know she's such a a prima-donna
Wherever you are is my home, you know I mean it
They say home is where the heart is
You're the reason mine is beatin'

I will always be here for you
And when I'm dyin' I pray to a higher power
Next to you is where I'm lyin'
Would you fuck me right on the floor?
I'm feelin' naughty
I wish to explore your features, secrets hidden in your body
I been feelin' like I don't have a choice
My only option
Watchin' me through the window as I whip up this concoction
Don't you ever take your life out of mine
I'll fuckin' kill you
Take you out to the bayou in the cabin with the mildew
And I'll leave you there for someone to find
My little angel
In your deepest darkest corners and I'm lovin' every angle
Baby, you got nowhere to hide, I'm comin' for you
Your parents could never fathom the level to I adore you
It's like Palestine up inside my mind, a deadly war zone
Quakin' inside my boots as you waken my every hormone
I'll give you everything I've got 'til I'm gone
And that's a promise
Unless you didn't want it then for you I'd be dishonest

I love you to the summer and back
It's not the winter, but you've frozen my heart
And got me warmin' up my liver
I would never put a knife in your back
The love I give her is kinda creepy, but fuck it
She orders and I deliver
I could never leave you alone
My little mama is mad at me at the moment
Know she's such a a prima-donna
Wherever you are is my home, you know I mean it
They say home is where the heart is
You're the reason mine is beatin'
