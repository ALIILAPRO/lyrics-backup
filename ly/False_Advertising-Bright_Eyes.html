		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  On a string
On a string

On a string, I was held
The way I move, can you tell?
My actions are orchestrated from above
And so I swing, and I sway
Wave my hand, kick my leg
And it's always right with the music
('Til all that swaying starts to make you sick)

For a song, I was bought
Now I lie when I talk
With a careful eye on the cue cards
Onto a stage, I was pushed
With my sorrow well-rehearsed
So, give me all your pity and your money now
All of it
(We used to think the sound was something good)

But if I could act like this was my real life
And not some cage where I've been placed
Well, then I could tell you
The truth like I used to
And not be afraid of sounding fake
Now all anyone's listening for are the mistakes

(Oh, I'm sorry)
No, it's okay, it's okay
One, two, three, one, two, three

In a house, by myself
I hear the ice start to melt
And I watch the rooftops weep for the sunlight
And I know what must change
Fuck my face, fuck my name
They are brief and false advertisements
For a soul, I don't have
Something true I have lacked
And spent my whole life trying to make up for
But I found, in a song
And in the people I love
They will lift me up out of darkness
And now my door, it stands open
I'm inviting everyone in
We're gonna laugh, we're gonna drink until the morning comes
That's what we're gonna do
Come on, come on
