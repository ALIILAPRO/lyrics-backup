		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh!
My disposition is in a position for all to see
Regretless of how it feels
I got a bullet with a name on it
Bullet with a name
'Cause the cause for the pause you think you see
Is really concentration of the steel
I got a bullet with a name on it
Bullet with a name

You see everybody's watching and
Passing judgment on
Every little move and decision I make
How can I be an individual
With the weight of the world
And 8 other planets to take?
And with everything happening
Gun shots clappin' and
People are running in every direction
With their hands up prayin' for the drama to end
I got my hand out
Lookin' for some money to spend

The price tag of the things I need
Are getting bigger by the day
I got a bullet with a name on it
Bullet with a name
Oh, the way I work so hard for things
They just take away from me
I got a bullet with a name on it
Bullet with a name (with a name)

Oh
I'm working harder than a hundred black mules down in Mexico
No water, no cloud, no cover
From the hotter than hell
No dinner bell, empty oven again
From another bad opinion
I mean
Who doesn't want the cars, money
Fame, attention, bars, honey's
Games, attention, stars
Funny, How we say we don't need it
Then turn around and try to achieve it

The price tag of the things I need
Are getting bigger by the day
I got a bullet with a name on it
Bullet with a name
Oh, the way I work so hard for things
They just take away from me
I got a bullet with a name on it
Bullet with a name

And everything that they say about me
And everything that they make me need
Are nothing when they're taking everything away from me
And everyone, trying to make it harder
And everyone saying I would never be
Are nothing but a name, on the bullet I aim
On the bullet that I aim
On the bullet that I aim!
The price tag of the things I need
Are getting bigger by the day
I got a bullet with a name on it
Bullet with a name
Oh, the way I work so hard for things
They just take away from me
I got a bullet with a name on it
Bullet with a name
I got a bullet with a name on it
Bullet with a name
I got a bullet with a name on it
Bullet with a name
