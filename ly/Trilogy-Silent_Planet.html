		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Static, static - there's no rest for a machine. Only circles and lines in my binary mind. I fade to static. Harvesting synapses in my dreams. I breathe, choke, let it go - but the fear never left when I slept alone so I'm fading to static in the disconnect.

Now I know it's delusion - in love with the slow demise.

We're all numb in the hum of progress.

Borrowed light, a parasite, I fed on the dusk and hid myself from the night. And we don't speak we barely hear, I watched you watch me disappear as I'm
fading to static in the disconnect.

Now I know it's delusion - in love with our slow demise. Be still and human. Breathe in and be consumed

It's always red the static in my head. It's always red the static in my head. It's always red the static in my head. It's always red the static in my head.

Return to the hands of time, there's nothing human in this room of white.

Be still as the noise divides us. Be still as the noise divides us
