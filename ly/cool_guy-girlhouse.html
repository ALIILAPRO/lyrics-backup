		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Get drunk on champagne 
Ride in your airplane
Take off to someplace that's new

A-merican dream
Whatever that means
Don't want it until i do

You're such a cool guy
maybe on the outside
Raise a glass for the
Nights that won't last
You're not a taste maker
But I want that flavor
Raise a glass to the
Life I can't have
You're such a cool guy

If it makes you happy to
Be the greatest gatsby
by all means, pour a drink

At your
Parties at mansions
Pools you can dive in
Maybe I could just dip my feet
