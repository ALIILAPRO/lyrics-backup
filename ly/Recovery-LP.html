		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Our room is dark, the blinds are shut tight
And everything is still too much outside
It may be over but not tonight
I may be older but I still cry

I can't stop sleeping in your clothes
You can't stop calling on the phone

Can't you see I'm in recovery?
Just let it be, I'm in recovery

I'm holding on, I know I'm almost there
Storm reach out and tell me that you care
I'm finally sober, I see the light
The worst is over, nobody died

I'm still trying to let you go
Oh baby, please, leave me alone

Can't you see I'm in recovery?
Just let it be, I'm in recovery (ooh)
I know you wanna say you're sorry
But I don't wanna hear that story
I don't wanna be your fool anymore
Can't you see I'm in recovery?

Always thought you'd be the one
Who always needed me
My home, you'd be my home
Suddenly, your memory
In time is like an enemy, so cold (ooh)

Can't you see I'm in recovery?
I know you wanna say you're sorry
But I already heard that story
And I don't wanna be your fool anymore

Can't you see I'm in recovery?
