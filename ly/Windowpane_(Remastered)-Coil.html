		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In the sky and in the eye and
In the sky and in the eye and..
If you want to touch the sky
Just put a window in your eye
See the sun and
See the rain
See the window
See the pain
See the sun and
See the rain
See the birds eye
See the brain
Ancient cities
Rise again
See microscopic
See world view
See the future
Leaking through
See the person
Who once was you
See the seashore and
See the sand
See the windows
In your hand
See the Lie.
Gold is the sky
In concentrate
Power in its purest state
Power surge
Power will rise
Through the windows and
Through the skies
Misrule is kind.
See the sky and
See the eye and
See the sky and
In your hand in the sky
And in your eye
See the sky in your hand
See the sky and understand
Gold is the sky
In concentrate
Power in its purest state
Power will rise
Power will fly
Through the window
Through your eye
Gold is the sky
Riches, treasures, riches
Richard's treasures
Riches, treasures, riches
Gold is the sky
In concentrate
Power in its purest state
Power will rise
Power will fly
Through the window and
Through your eye
Gold is the sky.
