		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How do I have to change?
Do you think it's not enough? I gave it all
What have I got to do to make myself be chosen?
No second thoughts for me
Just wanna be a man or a hero
Unconsciously I wonder how to be the special

Dive into the depth of my heart
Find myself feeling childish fears
The invisible hand of the God
Had made us burst their ancient locks
And now, the world I trusted breaks apart at the seams

Gotta burn my pride
We'll take a chance to make them crystalize
No one knows our beasts inside will be the demons or the saints
Never doubt myself
Show me your justice, 'cause you realize
So long now, my friend
Have a brighter day tomorrow

How do I have to change?
Small things will bring and begin big impacts
His paper castle's gone
Entire ground's still been frozen
Slipped into evil's sway, he kept on building the lies and fictions
We all got lost within ourselves what we should believe in

Dive into the depth of my heart
Find myself feeling childish fears
The invisible hand of the God
Had made us burst their ancient locks
And now, the world I trusted breaks apart at the seams

Gotta light my pride
We'll take a chance to make them crystalize
No one knows our beasts inside will be the demons or the saints
Never doubt myself
Show me your justice, 'cause you realize
So long now, my friend
Have a brighter day tomorrow

Thousand tears call the shadow of the nightmare
Thousand years past, longing for the future
Thousand grief shed cruelty and their blood but
Thousand beliefs will salvage our souls

Gotta light my pride
We'll take a chance to make them crystalize
No one knows our beasts inside will be the demons or the saints
Never doubt myself
Show me your justice, 'cause you realize
So long now, my friend
Have a brighter day tomorrow

Thousand tears call the shadow of the nightmare
Thousand years past, longing for the future
Thousand grief shed cruelty and their blood but
Thousand beliefs will salvage our souls

Thousand tears call the shadow of the nightmare
Thousand years past, longing for the future
Thousand grief shed cruelty and their blood but
Thousand beliefs will salvage our souls

Thousand tears call the shadow of the nightmare
Thousand years past, longing for the future
Thousand grief shed cruelty and their blood but
Thousand beliefs will salvage our souls
