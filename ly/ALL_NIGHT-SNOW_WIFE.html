		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fingers in my hands, I'm cancellin' my plans
Think we should get to dancin' all night, all night
I can feel the tension undressin' intentions
We should get to dancin' all night, all night
Oh no, he's movin' closer on my body, body
Oh no, I think I'm feelin' somethin' naughty, naughty
Fingers in my hands, I'm cancelling my plans
Think we should get to dancin' all night, all night

Solo, get him on his solo
I get on my go mode
Hoppin' on his pogo, go-go
I don't hit it like a side hoe
Kiss someone I don't know
Mrs. Dirty Psycho, Psycho

I saw him at the bar the other night in Lincoln Heights
I wanna ask him on a drunken ride on carriage box
I gave him something good to patronize my peace of mind
I got him hangin' on his chair

Fingers in my hands, I'm cancellin' my plans
Think we should get to dancin' all night, all night
I can feel the tension undressin' intentions
We should get to dancin' all night, all night
Oh no, he's movin' closer on my body, body
Oh no, I think I'm feelin' somethin' naughty, naughty
Fingers in my hands, I'm cancelling my plans
Think we should get to dancin' all night, all night

Hey little mama, I just saw you dirty dancin'
Honkin' the tonk and I wanna take a chancin'
Hey, little mama, you been boostin' and groovin'
You're a movie, smack this booty
Quit that trick, you can't smack this shit
'Cause your man's so whack and he bust too quick
Go get a dollar for a woman who will holla
On the boys who sit with a bum ass fit

I saw him at the bar the other night in Lincoln Heights
I wanna ask him on a drunken ride on carriage box
I gave him something good to patronize my peace of mind
I got him hanging on his chair

Fingers in my hands, I'm cancellin' my plans
Think we should get to dancin' all night, all night
I can feel the tension undressin' intentions
We should get to dancin' all night, all night
Oh no, he's movin' closer on my body, body
Oh no, I think I'm feelin' somethin' naughty, naughty
Fingers in my hands, I'm cancelling my plans
Think we should get to dancin' all night, all night
