		  Heart
It's breaking and im at fault
It's racing
And i can't breathe
Im patient but i can't leave
Or run

This time
I'm watching over you
I'm ok
I'm watching over you
I'm ok
(I almost had it and then lost it all)
I'm watching over you
I'm ok
(I almost had it and then lost it all)
I'm watching over you
I'm ok I

I put my head down
I beg for mercy now

I trust in no one
Detach and isolate
Consume intoxicate
For all of my days

I run from no one
Be still and have some faith
I'm here let's navigate
For the rest of our days

This time
I'm watching over you
I'm ok
I'm watching over you
I'm ok
(I almost had it and then lost it all)
I'm watching over you
I'm ok
(I almost had it and then lost it all)
I'm watching over you
I'm ok
