		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got some scars
I got mad scars, got a scar here, a scar here, scar here 
I got scars
That's why when I walk without it
(Great John on the beat by the way)

They know what that means
If you broke
People gon' look at you funny as hell
They not gonna believe in what you sayin', not yet
Get your money up now everybody like, "Yeah bro I've been tellin' you"
Yeah? Nah, nigga, nah, you wasn't thinkin' about it

Look, look, I ain't gotta cap, I ain't gotta flex 
I ain't gotta stunt, I let niggas know
If he disrespect then he gotta-
If he disrespect then he gotta go
Why you keep a pole? 'Cause I can't go
Run up on 'em still let 'em things go
I told bro to walk up on 'em, do 'em dirty 
Louis gotta thirty he will get you bury 
Hit him in his back since he tryna run, huh
Leave him on his front
I ain't tryna laugh, I ain't tryna joke 
Niggas talkin' blunt, niggas gettin' smoked
Drillin' with a mask, never leave a witness, uh
Niggas know who did it
Bitch, I'm a star diamonds on the pendent, uh
Guess how much it cost
I could get you wet all around the coast
I could get you picked, you won't need to float
Audemar baguettes below all my fingers
Said I'm a best, love the way I dig it
Ain't never switch up on the Ros√©
Never slipped up, never told
I ain't never pillow talked with these hoes
Ain't never diss a opp I ain't scope
But they see me now screamin' that's me
Like, "There goes Sheff G"
Niggas stealin' flows I'm a need them back
Diss me in a song, niggas gettin' clapped
Put that on the set, tatted on my neck
Like, Shooter Gang got 'em
Word to your dead, you don't want no problems
Tell them to spin, you know where to find us (yeah)

Lookin' for 'em meeny-miny-moe
Wonderin' which one gon' have to go, huh
One gon' have to go, wonderin' which one gon have to-
Look, lookin' for 'em meeny-miny-moe
Wonderin' which one gon' have to go, huh
One gon' have to go, wonderin' which one gon' have to- (baow, boaw)
