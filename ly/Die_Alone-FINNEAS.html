		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wasn't lookin' for you
But you found me, you found me
Just as the smoke filled the room
In the valley

You asked me, "Do you wanna die alone
Or watch it all burn down together?"
I said I'd rather try to hold on to you forever

'Cause I know that I will love you
And I'm not letting go
If the sky darkens above you
I'll stay by your side in the afterglow

This was the place I grew up
Now it's ashes to ashes
Memories fillin' my cup
It comes in flashes
But when it passes and I see your eyes, I know
There's nothin' I'll ever find better
I think I'd rather die alone, together

'Cause I know that I will love you
And I'm not letting go
If the sky darkens above you
I'll stay by your side in the afterglow

'Cause I know that I will love you
And I'm not letting go
If the sky darkens above you
I'll stay by your side in the afterglow

I wasn't lookin' for you
But you found me
