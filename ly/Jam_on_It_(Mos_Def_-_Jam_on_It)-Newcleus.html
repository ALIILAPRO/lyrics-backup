		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ha ha ha ha, yeah yeah
Jam on it (yeah, yeah, we know, we know)
Huh
(Yeah, Cozmo, you gonna rock it, right?)
(You gonna do it down, right?)
Ha ha ha ha, yeah
(Hey, Cozmo, what's the name of this again?)
(I forgot)
Jam on it (oh)

(Do we get to say wikki-wikki-wikki again?)
Wikki-wikki-wikki-wikki (shut up)
Wikki-wikki-wikki-wikki

Three words to the whack, step yourself back
'Cause we're gettin' down and ain't givin' no slack
Like a Burger King with a sack of Big Macs
We're throwin' down with a rack of Bozaks
One time, in your mind you see
You gotta boogie to your best ability
You gotta funk it up until it knocks you down
And when you've funked enough, make sure you pass it around
Come on, let's go to work
We got what'll make your body jerk
Make you throw your hands up in the air
Shake your booty and scream, oh yeah
'Cause we are the Jam-On Crew
And jammin' on it is how we do the do
We'll funk you up until you boogie down
So come on people, check out the sound

Check out the sound, check out the sound
Check out the sound, check out the sound
Check out the sound, check out the sound
Check out the sound, check out the sound

(Jam on it)

You rock this, rock that and that's a fact
'Cause the Jam On Crew will rock your body right back
Rock a steam locomotive right off the track
And give the whole wide world a funk attack
And to the beat y'all, get down
Let me rock it to the rhythm of the funk sound
From hill to hill, from sea to sea
A when Jam On's rockin' everybody screams
(Jam on it) jam on it
Jam on and on, on and on it
And if you're feelin' like you want to dance all night
Then go on ahead and flaunt it

Say, Superman had come to town to see who he could rock
He blew away every crew he faced until he reached our block
His speakers were three stories high with woofers made of steel
And when we brought our set outside, he said "Ha, be real"

He said, "I'm faster than a speedin' bullet when I'm on the set
I don't need no fans to cool my amps, I just use my super breath
I could fly three times around the world without missin' a beat
I socialize with X-ray eyes, and ladies think it's sweet"

And then he turned his power on and the ground began to move
And all the buildings for miles around were swayin' to the groove
And just when he had fooled the crowd and swore he wouldn't fight

We rocked his butt with a 12 inch cut called Disco Kryptonite
Well, Superman looked up at me, he said, "You rock so naturally"
I said "Now that you've learned to deal, let me tell you why I'm so for real
I'm Cozmo D from outer space, I came to rock the human race
I do it right 'cause I can't do it wrong
That's why the whole world is singin' this song"

(Jam on it) Ah, jam on it
I said jam-j-j-jam on it
As days turn to night and night turns to day
Whatever time it is, I want to hear you say

Jam on it, jam on it
Jam on it, jam on it
Jam on it, jam on it
Jam on it, jam on it

Yeah, that's how you do it Cozmo
You rocked it, that's the way you do it
Yeah, like, did you see when he went in the corner
And he started doin' this
Wikki-wikki-wikki-wikki
Wikki-wikki-wikki-wikki

Ah, man, this is too funky for me
I'm goin' home
Hey, Mergatroid, let's go (let's go)
Hey, you fellas seen my sister Mergatroid?
She was standin' over here just a minute ago

Yeah, I think I saw her over there with Grand D
He's rockin' the mic, you know
"Digga dang, digga dang, dang, dang, dang, digga, digga, dang, dang"
