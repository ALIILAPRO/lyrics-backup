		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ever blazin', ever blazin', girl
Blazin' up the flame, blazin' up the flame
Ever blazin' ever blazin' girl, yo

As the world turns
And as time burns
Girl, you know I'm gonna be there
My love is ever blazin', ever blazin', girl
And you know it nah guh change
As the world turns
And as time burns
Girl, you know I'm gonna be there
My love is ever blazin', ever blazin', girl
And it never fades away

There's no pretending
Girl, I said my love is never ending
From we used to par just like a friend ting
Up until now me a tell you say
A you fi be the queen
I and I man a your said king
Only one thin' the Dutty Paul is requesting
Keep up to date 'cah you are the best ting
Girl, you know your lifestyle real interesting
That's why the Dutty investing

As the world turns
And as time burns
Girl, you know I'm gonna be there
My love is ever blazin', ever blazin', girl
And you know it nah guh change
As the world turns
And as time burns
Girl, you know I'm gonna be there
My love is ever blazin', ever blazin', girl
And it never fades away

Because me admire you
But me nah shy ah you
Say from the day me hire you
Me know me nah fire you
Girl, ah long time the Dutty Rock ah desire you
Woman you know say you ah hot and you a spit fire too
Bill Gates, Donald Trump
Them a require you
Inna the Pentium five, them waan wire you
When them know seh you a real frequent flyer, too
Like a trophy inna mi bed you know me waan retire you

As the world turns
And as time burns
Girl, you know I'm gonna be there
My love is ever blazin', ever blazin', girl
And you know it nah guh change
As the world turns
And as time burns
Girl, you know I'm gonna be there
My love is ever blazin', ever blazin', girl
And it never fades away

There's no pretending
Girl, you know my love is never ending
From we used to par just like a friend ting
Up until now me a tell you say
A you fi be the queen
I and I man a your said king
Only one thin' the Dutty Paul is requesting
Keep up to date 'cah you are the best thing
Girl, you know your lifestyle real interesting
That's why the Dutty investing

As the world turns
And as time burns
Girl, you know I'm gonna be there
My love is ever blazin', ever blazin', girl
And you know it nah guh change
As the world turns
And as time burns
Girl, you know I'm gonna be there
My love is ever blazin', ever blazin', girl
And it never fades away

Because me admire you
But me nah shy ah you
Say from the day me hire you
Me know me nah fire you
Girl, ah long time the Dutty Rock ah desire you
Woman you know say that you ah hot and you a spit fire too
Bill Gates, Donald Trump
Them a require you
Inna the Pentium five, when them waan wire you
When them know seh you a real frequent flyer, too
Like a trophy inna mi bed you know me wan retire you

As the world turns
And as time burns
Girl, you know I'm gonna be there
My love is ever blazin' ever blazin', girl
And it never gonna change
As the world turns
And as time burns
Girl, you know I'm gonna be there
My love is ever blazin' ever blazin', girl
And it never fades away

As the world turns
And as time burns
Girl, you know I'm gonna be there
My love is ever blazin' ever blazin', girl
And it never gonna change
As the world turns
And as time burns
Girl, you know I'm gonna be there
