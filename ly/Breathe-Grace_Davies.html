		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So it starts
The end of where you tear me apart
Living with a stone for a heart
Cos you've broken enough for the
Both of us and you say it loud
I wrote it down and you read it out
You know it's hard for me to open my mouth
Cos you've spoken enough for both of us so I

Light up
Gonna breathe right in, gonna fill my lungs
And I won't breathe out when you come undone
When the walls fall down gonna
Stand and watch you burn gonna let this go
Gonna breathe right in 'cause
It's what I do
And I won't breathe out cos you told me to
And when the walls fall down gonna
Stand and watch you burn

So it starts a conversation out of the dark
Your explanation caught me off guard
You ignited a spark and you gave
Me the heart to try so you say
You're done and you don't want me to stay
But I've been tryna give you everything
Did you blink
Did you think I was gonna leave you quietly

Light up
Gonna breathe right in, gonna fill my lungs
And I won't breathe out when you come undone
When the walls fall down gonna
Stand and watch you burn gonna let this go
Gonna breathe right in 'cause
It's what I do
And I won't breathe out 'cause
You told me to
And when the walls fall down gonna
Stand and watch you burn

(Light it up, let it burn)
(Light it up, let it burn)
(Light it up, let it burn)
(Light it up, let it burn)
(Light it up, let it burn)
(Light it up, let it burn)
(Light it up, let it burn)
(Light it up, let it burn)

Stand and watch it burn, oh
Stand and watch it burn
Stand and watch it burn, oh

Light up
Gonna breathe right in, gonna fill my lungs
And I won't breathe out when you come undone
When the walls fall down gonna
Stand and watch you burn gonna let this go
Gonna breathe right in cause it's what I do
And I won't breathe out cos you told me to
And when the walls fall down gonna
Stand and watch you burn
Gonna let this go and breathe
