		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do, do-do, do-do
Do-do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
Do, do-do, do-do
Do-do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do

You bring me summer every weekend
Like a rooftop in LA
When it heats up in the evenin'
You cool me off like lemonade
So don't go changin' like the seasons
'Cause you're perfect in every way
Babe, you got a love that's world leadin'
If you were runnin', I'd lead your campaign (hey)

Wake me up
Lot of caffeine in my coffee cup
And like a shootin' star, you light me up
Ooh, you're amazin'

'Cause we all need somebody
Even lonely hearts need somebody
So before this love leaves your body
Give it away
So if you've got somebody
Let 'em know that they got somebody
Little love never hurt nobody, hey
So you use your light and shine it like crazy
We got one life, let's make it amazin'
I love you, baby, no, that ain't changin'
You got, you got somebody who loves ya
You got, you got somebody who loves ya

Do, do-do, do-do
Do-do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do

Baby, you and me, we got chemistry
Call it alchemy, call it what you want
I don't know what I believe in
Oh, what a time to be livin' and breathin'
And I got a feelin' that we're here for the same thing

Wake me up
Lot of caffeine in my coffee cup
And like a shootin' star, you light me up
Ooh, you're amazin'

'Cause we all need somebody
Even lonely hearts need somebody
So before this love leaves your body
Give it away, yeah
So if you've got somebody
Let 'em know that they got somebody
Little love never hurt nobody, nobody
So you use your light and shine it like crazy
We got one life, let's make it amazin'
I love you, baby, no, that ain't changin'
You got, you got somebody who loves ya
You got, you got somebody who love

(A little love never hurt nobody)
You got, you got somebody who loves ya
You got, you got somebody who loves ya
You got, you got somebody who loves ya (we all need somebody)
You got, you got somebody who loves ya

Wake me up
You're the caffeine in my coffee cup
And like a shootin' star, you light me up
Amazing
You're amazing

'Cause we all need somebody
Even lonely hearts need somebody
So before this love leaves your body
Give it away ('way, 'way, 'way)
So if you've got somebody
Let 'em know that they got somebody
Little love never hurt nobody, nobody
So you use your light and shine it like crazy
We got one life, let's make it amazin'
I love you, baby, no, that ain't changin'
You got, you got somebody who loves ya
You got, you got somebody who loves ya
