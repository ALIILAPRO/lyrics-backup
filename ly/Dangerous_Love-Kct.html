		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wrapped up my heart in a bandage
You left your love on that canvas
Last December baby
Painted your world on my canvas
I guess it didn't meet your standards
Now its December again

I still love you
I really do

No you don't
Bet you never did
Was I just your little moment to get over him?
Did you shed a tear?
Bet you never did
Bet you went and filled your bed
I bet you let him
Where you now?
Is it his or yours?
Doesn't matter anymore I guess i'm insecure
And this hurts a bit
But I can swim
So grab the petrol and the matches and lets burn a bridge

But then you say
I still love you

And I'm right back in danger
I'm right back in your arms
Your dangerous love
Your dangerous love
Your dangerous love

Are you happy that I'm no longer around you?
Do you ever think about me when he's round?
Do you ever wish that we could meet and have a round two?
I hope we don't cause I'm still happier without you
That's a lie but saying it gets me by
And saves me the embarrassment explaining why
How and when you up and left
I told my family and my friends 
I was at fault in your defence 
I hope that one day you regret this

But then you say
I still love you

And I'm right back in danger
I'm right back in your arms
Your dangerous love
Your dangerous love
Your dangerous love
