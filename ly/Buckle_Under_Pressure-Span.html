		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I keep setting standards for myself 
Another stone for this wall inside my head 
I just wanna be half the man I expect 
This craving holds me down like a rope that ties me to my bed 

I need some help 
So I don't go under 
I need some help
So I don't 
Buckle under pressure 
Cold air in my balloon 
Buckle under pressure 
Cold air in my balloon 
Buckle under pressure

Caffeine keeps me up pouring thoughts out through my pen 
Another stone for this wall inside my head 
I just need this sleepless night to end 
But nothing helps as I push myself over the edge 

I need some help 
So I don't go under 
I need some help
So I don't 
Buckle under pressure 
Cold air in my balloon 
Buckle under pressure 
Cold air in my balloon 
Buckle under pressure, yeah

buckle under pressure
Buckle under pressure

I need some help!

buckle under pressure, yeah, yeah
Buckle under pressure, oh
