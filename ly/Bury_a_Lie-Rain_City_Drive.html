		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Been alone too much
Been alone too much inside my head
Can I make things up
Can I make things up with you instead
There ain't no reason for me to defend the things you've said
Would you do it all again

Repeat recycled lines
Find a new disguise
Same old alibi

Six feet ain't deep enough to bury a lie
Don't ask me why I'm not just letting it die
It's coming back to haunt me time after time
No grave is steep enough to sleep through the night
Buried by lies
(Sleep through night
Buried by lies)

Keep hanging on
Keep hanging on
A single thread
We're tangled up
We're tangled up
Inside your web
Who would've known I'd be lonelier with you in my bed
I'm always digging up what's already dead

Six feet ain't deep enough to bury a lie
Don't ask me why I'm not just letting it die
It's coming back to haunt me time after time
No grave is steep enough to sleep through the night
Buried by lies
(Sleep through night
Buried by lies)

You're filling me up with doubt
I toss and I turn
Why I should I burn this down

Six feet ain't deep enough to bury a lie
Don't ask me why I'm not just letting it die
It's coming back to haunt me time after time
No grave is steep enough to sleep through the night
Buried by lies
(Sleep through night
Buried by lies)
