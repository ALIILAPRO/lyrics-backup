		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't give a damn about the rumours, they have never bothered me
Yeah and I might be a fool
But I'm likin' what my eyes can see

And I'm in love with the rush, boy, love with the rush, boy
That you make me feel
Don't give a damn about the rumors
Yeah I prefer mystery

Feeling like a loose leaf stuck on the tree
Blowing in the wind come help me be free
Like the shimmering stars all smiling at me, oh
Pour the red wine, red wine
Feeling like a loose leaf stuck on the tree
Blowing in the wind come help me be free
With your shivering hands, yeah, put them on me, oh
And pour the red wine, red wine, baby
And pour the red wine, red wine, baby

I don't care for the truth boy, you can be who you please
I've had enough of reality, longing for the sweet relief, oh oh

And I'm in love with the rush, boy, love with the rush, boy
You wouldn't believe
And right now we're no one
So baby let's breathe
All the girls all around the world'll say it
Boy I need love, I need action, action
All the guys all around the world'll say it
Everyone craves a distraction, don't you?

Feeling like a loose leaf stuck on the tree
Blowing in the wind come help me be free
Like the shimmering stars all smiling at me, oh
Pour the red wine, red wine
Feeling like a loose leaf stuck on the tree
Blowing in the wind come help me be free
With your shivering hands, yeah, put them on me, oh
And pour the red wine, red wine, baby
And pour the red wine, red wine

I, I want a lick, I wanna live out all my fantasies
Dance on every table 'til they're mad at me
Throw my hair back in the breeze
Boy, you're right there with me
Should believe, gold summer breeze
Throw your eyes at me-
Trying to stop me from flying but I won't
No, no oh oh oh
Ey, ey, ey, ey, ey
Pour the red wine, red wine

Feeling like a loose leaf stuck on the tree
Blowing in the wind come help me be free
Take your shivering hands, yeah, put them on me, oh
And pour the red wine, red wine, baby
All the girls all around the world'll say it
Pour the red wine, red wine baby
All the guys all around the world'll say it
And pour the red wine, red wine baby
All the girls all around the world'll say it
Pour the red wine, red wine baby
All the guys all around the world'll say it
Pour the red wine, red wine baby
