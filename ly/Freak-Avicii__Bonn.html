		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't want to be seen in this shape I'm in
I don't want you to see how depressed I've been, yeah
You were never the high one, never wanted to die young
I don't want you to see all the scars within

So, tell me why (oh why, oh why)
Why am I such a freak?
You're outta your mind (oh my, oh my)
Who the fuck are you to judge me?
And I told you I'd be different
And I told you I was wild
You're stuck in denial
Yeah, I think that maybe you're the freak

I keep thinking about what we could've been
If we hadn't been caught in what should've been, yeah
Oh, we used to be dancing, never cared about nothing
I don't know when we got all these scars within

So, tell me why, yeah (oh why, oh why)
Why am I such a freak?
You're outta your mind (oh my, oh my), no
Who the fuck are you to judge me?
And I told you I'd be different
And I told you I was wild
You're stuck in denial
Yeah, I think that maybe you're the freak

Hmm, yeah
Yeah, I think that maybe you're the freak
You're stuck in denial
Yeah, I think that maybe you're the freak

Oh, yeah, I think that maybe you're the freak
Oh why, oh why
Hmm
Oh my, oh my
Yeah, I think that maybe you're the freak
Oh why, oh why
Oh my, oh my
Yeah, I think that maybe you're the freak
