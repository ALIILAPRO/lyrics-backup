		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Romo what you is?
(Bitch, I'm rich) , What you is? (Bitch
I'm rich) what you is?
(Bitch, I'm rich) , Bitch, I'm
Rich (Bitch, I'm rich, ayy)

Okay now
Romo got a strap and Rucci got a strap
Ohgeesy got a strap and Fenix
Got a strap, ayy, ayy
Bitch, I'm back and I'm better, ayy, ayy
(Bitch, I'm back)
Black MAC, black Beretta, ayy, ayy
(This a strap)
Still trappin' out the Jetta, ayy, ayy
Serving crack I won't let up, ayy
A trendsetter, my homies into chin-checking
Big stepping in this bitch
With some big weapons, ayy
Go the wrong way down the one way, ayy
Put a nigga to bleep, free Gunplay
(That's on Norf) , ayy
Campin' out from Monday to Monday (What?)
I'm mister ride by my lonely (Go)
I feel like Tony in this bitch
(Tony in this bitch)
The world is mine, you say
You down, then show me, lil' bitch
(You gotta show me, lil' bitch)
I'm at the line, I'm
Shootin' shit like Kobe, lil' bitch
With a long nose like Ginobili
I'm known to get rich and
Bust down with my homies

Ayy, I got a strap in my coupe
Bad bitch to the right fuck what you saying
Gettin' rich 'til I die
Gettin' money, gettin' high
Fuckin' bitches, living life
Do this every night, man, I can't get right
I got a strap in my coupe
Bad bitch to the right, ayy
Bitch, I'm mollied up and I'm
Probably out my mind
I got a strap in my coupe
Bad bitch to the right, ayy
Bitch, I'm mollied up and I'm
Probably out my mind, go

I'm with Rucci countin' uchies
Gettin' money out a groupie
Niggas hatin', bitches choosing
Get the unit's, then I move 'em
Percocets, you know I chew 'em
Think it's sweet until we shootin'
We done really made a
Movement, not with music, talkin' unit's
Yeah, we rap it, but we do it
Ain't the same (Ain't the same)
I done really came a long way
From trips on that train (For real)
I'ma drop another four and kill the pain
(Kill the pain)
Ever since I started ballin'
I swear shit ain't been the same

Ayy, I got a strap in my coupe
Bad bitch to the right fuck what you saying
Gettin' rich 'til I die
Gettin' money, gettin' high
Fuckin' bitches, living life
Do this every night, man, I can't get right
I got a strap in my coupe
Bad bitch to the right, ayy
Bitch, I'm mollied up and I'm
Probably out my mind
I got a strap in my coupe
Bad bitch to the right, ayy
Bitch, I'm mollied up and I'm
Probably out my mind, go

Instagram bitch gettin' flown out for dick
I'ma blow her back out with
The blower on my hip
I'ma fuck her through the zipper
I can't never trust a bitch
I'ma trap like forever
I been trappin' since a jit
I'ma shoot it out the whip
She be droolin' on my dick
You pay her rent
But we with your bitch foolin' at her crib
I'ma shoot it out the whip
She be droolin' on my dick
You pay her rent
But we with your bitch foolin' at her crib
Test Norf, ballin', need a court
I just poured a fourth and
I nut on this whore
I want a million so I'm finna go on tour
Pull the stick out
Flame a nigga like some smores
She washing all the dishes
She doing all the chores
She brought all her friends but I
Told her bring some more
HellaWave to the core, Walgreens, I'ma score
He still pourin' ones
My lil' nigga poured a four

Ayy, I got a strap in my coupe
Bad bitch to the right fuck what you saying
Gettin' rich 'til I die
Gettin' money, gettin' high
Fuckin' bitches, living life
Do this every night, man, I can't get right
I got a strap in my coupe
Bad bitch to the right, ayy
Bitch, I'm mollied up and I'm
Probably out my mind
I got a strap in my coupe
Bad bitch to the right, ayy
Bitch, I'm mollied up and I'm
Probably out my mind, go
