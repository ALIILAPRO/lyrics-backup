		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Today cuts like a knife, you're alone most half the time 
If I call you when its late just to see if you're okay will you 
Hide inside, will you 
Hide behind fakes, gettin ready for another mistake 
I don't mind, it's fine. I will 
Burn out and I know its hard out when your hearts made of glass 
Baby it's alright, we're movin closer to what we might 
Soon become, completely numb 
I can't wait to run 
Until we get up 
I don't wanna fall 
I'll make it alone 
What made you so dumb 
There's things you don't know 
Just open your eyes, and don't cry, I will 
Burn out and I know it's hard out when your hearts made of glass
