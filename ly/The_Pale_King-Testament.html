		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was awakened by the howling of the dog
Or perhaps a wolf
Summoned by the voices who are shouting in my ear
The pale king comes from afar

Before the time, who will decide
I've lived to see one thousand moons
I am weak, I am ill
I am old with a taste for the kill

All that I've seen in the years that I possess
The faces I don't recognize
Summoning the ancients with the evil that awaits
Reading from the book of the dead

Zone of the Gods, below the sea
I've traveled amongst the stars
I am life, I am Death
I control the gates of this world

The pale kings reign, condemns this world
Their doing time till the end of there lives

Falling, traveling through out this world
Falling, fallen from the skies
Taken from the prophecy as they control your mind
The pale kings hold your fate

One hundred thousand years and counting
One hundred thousand million more to go
Throughout his life he keeps on searching
The pale king makes this world his own

And the seals of these are written herein
Yet others I must take with me
The spirit of Daemon no longer known
Anu have mercy on my soul
