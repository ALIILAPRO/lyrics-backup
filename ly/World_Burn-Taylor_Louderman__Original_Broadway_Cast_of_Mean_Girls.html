		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My name is Regina George
And I am a massive deal
I will grind you to sand
Beneath my Louboutin heel

This is what I get for helping
Helping someone lame fit in
Cady Heron, enjoy your temporary win

My name is Regina George
"Regina is a fugly cow"
Hey Cady, how ya like me now?

I wanna watch the world burn
I got the gasoline
I wanna watch the world burn
And everyone get mean
I wanna watch the world burn
I got the gasoline
I wanna watch the world burn
And everyone get mean

Cady, time to watch your back
Cady, time to turn and cough
Because you took me down
But you didn't finish me off

My name is Regina George
And in case you're keeping score
Cady may have won the battle
But I will win the war, for

I wanna watch the world burn
(Trang Pak is a grotsky biotch)
I brought the gasoline
(Ms. Norbury's a drug pusher)
I wanna make the world burn
Janis is a space dyke!
Regina is a fugly cow
Regina is a fugly cow

And you can quote this
Ooh, whoa-oh-oh (who wrote this?)
(Who wrote this?)
(Who wrote this?)

I wanna watch the world burn
I got the gasoline
I wanna watch the world burn
And everyone turn
Mean (so mean)
Mean (so mean)
Mean

I wanna watch the world burn (who wrote this, who wrote this?)
I wanna make the world turn
So mean (who wrote this, who wrote this, who wrote this, who wrote this?)
I wanna watch the world burn!
