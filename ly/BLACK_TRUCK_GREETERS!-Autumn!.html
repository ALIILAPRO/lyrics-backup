		  Woah, woah

Money fallin' over, hoes comin' over
World up on my shoulders, this a Track', this not a Rover
She say she want closure, she just mad she can't get closer
None my niggas sober, they pour fours inside they sodas
Money green like Yoda, I get more as I get older
Pockets heavy, I told you, I got knots as fat as boulders
Always keep your heater 'cause the world just make you colder
My new bitch a diva, all I hang around is soldiers
All-black like the reaper and my diamonds cold as polar
Black truck came with greeters, bitch, I ball like Dennis Schröder
Jeep, it beat the Audi, bitch, yeah

Fly as shit, high as shit, hide your bitch, yeah
Most of these niggas clones, can tell they counterfeit, yeah
She gon' fuck with me, she know I'm pop my shit, yeah
And she gon' fuck with me, she know I pop my shit, yeah
Can't nobody see us, bae, this whole fit Undercover
He keep tryna save this ho, he think he Danny Glover
Throw some hoes some Molly, now they kissin' on each other
They gon' do what I say 'cause I'm a young rich motherf-
Rich-ass havin' ass, I be on some big shit
Niggas out here tellin' on us, they be on some pig shit
Boy, can't trust, say I should change my name 'cause, bitch, I'm Really Rich
Nigga music shootin' in the air 'cause all he do is miss
Trackhawk, GT3, Corvette, R31, I'm really lit
Top floor, ain't nobody over us, this really it
Nachos, niggas mad they stressin' out, they really pissed
Ha-ha, laughin' to the bank, I'm really spinnin' shit
5.56 to your lil' melon, I bet it's gon' hit
Every time I step inside that stu', bitch, that's another hit
A fronto to the face, still feel the pain, I took another hit
If she come over, then that's not your bitch, lil' bro, I bet I hit, yeah

Money fallin' over, hoes comin' over
World up on my shoulders, this a Track', this not a Rover
She say she want closure, she just mad she can't get closer
None my niggas sober, they pour fours inside they sodas
Money green like Yoda, I get more as I get older
Pockets heavy, I told you, I got knots as fat as boulders
Always keep your heater 'cause the world just make you colder
My new bitch a diva, all I hang around is soldiers
All-black like the reaper and my diamonds cold as polar
Black truck came with greeters, bitch, I ball like Dennis Schröder
Jeep, it beat the Audi, bitch, yeah

All kinds of women, the models, no-lifes, hood rats, everything, we do it all, we don't-
