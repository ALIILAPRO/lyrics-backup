		<p>
		  Prepare for the worst pray for the best life's all a test fall or prevail

(Hook) 
Too many bad thoughts goin through my head through my head
Now it's hard to sleep 
Toss n turn in bed 
chhhh 
Maybe I forgave 
But I won't forget 
Wont forget 
Made a come up 
From a let down (Let down)

(Verse1)
cngry 
How am I supposed to chill out 
Never gotta hand out 
cin't waitin on somebodys death to get 
c cash out 
Worked 
Like a slave 
Goin through the up and downs 
c life built on let downs
I don't need no one can do it myself 
That's how I moved how I felt 
Unfair cards I was dealt 
Was a struggle askin anyone for help
You Might use it against me
Not sure if anyones with me 
Feels like me and myself 
Gotta fight my way out 
Devil plottin to end me

You so loose at the mouth 
Speakin anything out 
Went from friends to an enemy 

Im not who i used to be
Fine with the scrutiny 
But where is the unity 
Things Can't be what it used to be
Hate me right now 
You gone hate the future me 

(Hook) 
Too many bad thoughts goin through my head through my head
Now it's hard to sleep 
Toss n turn in bed 
chhhh 
Maybe I forgave 
But I won't forget 
Wont forget 
Made a come up 
From a let down Let down 

(verse2)
People act like they ain't got issues
Got blemishes your rents due 
Hurt you well I meant too
I cin't perfect I got sins too 
Got demons I got friends too
I moved on I don't miss you 
Cry baby
Go get a tissue
Life's so hard 
I know 
Look I'm here too 
Nobody just walks in my life 
God could bless me 
Or I know the devil couldve sent you 

Sent you 
Sent you 
Set me up
Not dumb I know what's what 
Mess with me 
Mess with me 
Messed me up
The wicked 
Can't get enough

Take and take 
You was Known for breakin
Souls and taken em 
Out 
I'm one that's makin it out 
Makin life feel like hell 

(Hook) 
Too many bad thoughts goin through my head through my head
Now it's hard to sleep 
Toss n turn in bed 
chhhh 
Maybe I forgave 
But I won't forget 
Wont forget 
Made a come up 
From a let down 

(God never let me down
clways got a way out 
People trynna pull me down
Zombie I couldn't stay down)
