		  Go, brrt
(Oh, yeah, I'm finna make a banger with this one)
Had to dump some more
Brrt
(DJ on the beat, so it's a banger)
With my chopper
Yeah (brrt)
To your mama
Come here, come here
Come here, come here
Go, go

Plenty shots up on the scene, shell cases on the floor (brrt)
Hundred shots, it wasn't enough, so we had to go dump some more (had to dump some more)
When that bitch go, "Boom-ba-bang-bang," they gettin' low (brrt)
Strap on my waist like I'm Pootie Tang up in this ho (Pootie Tang, ho)
Hit the scene with my chopper (with my chopper)
All he seen was doctors (brrt)
Paramedics gotta break the news to your mama (to your mama)
Beam on his 'lock, done knocked the neck off his collar (come here, come here)
And I gave some 7.62s to his partner (come here, come here, brrt)

I was taking prescription, it wasn't from a doctor (from a doctor)
He was talking crazy, couldn't catch him, hit his father (bitch)
Fresh when I be stepping, lethal weapon with this chopper (lethal weapon)
Hop up in that striker, we gon' smoke 'em like some grabba (skrrt)
We too legit (too legit)
Shells poppin' hot up out the Glock, I got a cooling kit (I got a cooling kit)
I fuck with some C's, but niggas know that I be boolin' it
Trapping never dead, bitch, I'ma serve until I'm stupid rich (for sure)
I don't got my pistol, got the Drac', no, we ain't dukin' it (nigga)
Ksubi when I step, huh
I don't mean to flex, but
Niggas know that Eazzyy been the best, that nigga next up (that nigga next up)
Hollow points, no, they don't hit his vest, shoot from the neck up
Who the fuck want smoke with SME? Lil' nigga, step up

Plenty shots up on the scene, shell cases on the floor (brrt)
Hundred shots, it wasn't enough, so we had to go dump some more (had to dump some more)
When that bitch go, "Boom-ba-bang-bang," they gettin' low (brrt)
Strap on my waist like I'm Pootie Tang up in this ho (Pootie Tang, ho)
Hit the scene with my chopper (with my chopper)
All he seen was doctors (brrt)
Paramedics gotta break the news to your mama (to your mama)
Beam on his 'lock, done knocked the neck off his collar (come here, come here)
And I gave some 7.62s to his partner (come here, come here, brrt)

Ayy, steppin' on the day to day
Bloody shoes on my Bathing Ape (or my Bathing Ape)
Draco underage and baby K, fuck 'em the nasty way (nasty way)
I'm somethin' like Kanye, it's no way I leave without the K (grrt, grrt, grrt, grrt)
All I know is one way, my way, the other way ain't okay
What, you wanna shoot somethin'? (Shoot somethin')
Bet your ass won't do nothin' (do nothin')
Oh, you got your crew comin'? (Crew comin')
I'ma leave your crew runnin' (crew runnin')
In your hood like, "Who run it?" 
They say you don't run shit (you don't run shit)
Checked your background, you a bitch 
you ain't never done shit (you ain't done shit)
We somethin' like liquor
give 'em shots, then we chase it (then we chase that bitch)
The fast life quicker 
I'm livin' like the matrix (matrix in this shit)
I know I'm that nigga 
room full of bitches naked (bitches naked and shit)
Gun by the pillow, I'm just a killer who lay dick

Plenty shots up on the scene, shell cases on the floor (brrt)
Hundred shots, it wasn't enough, so we had to go dump some more (had to dump some more)
When that bitch go, "Boom-ba-bang-bang," they gettin' low (brrt)
Strap on my waist like I'm Pootie Tang up in this ho (Pootie Tang, ho)
Hit the scene with my chopper (with my chopper)
All he seen was doctors (brrt)
Paramedics gotta break the news to your mama (to your mama)
Beam on his 'lock, done knocked the neck off his collar (come here, come here)
And I gave some 7.62s to his partner (come here, come here, brrt)

Go
Had to dump some more
Bitch
Brrt
Huh, go
Go
Brrt
To ya mama
(DJ on the beat, so it's a banger)
Grrt
