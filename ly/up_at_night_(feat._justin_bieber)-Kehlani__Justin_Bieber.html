		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You wonder why I love you
There was never pressure
Easy as I want to
There's just no one better
You think it's calculated
Baby, I'm just not that clever, never 

And what could I say? 
I knew that it would go this way
Of course you blamed it on fate (fate)
I couldn't let it just escape 
Now at the end of our days (days)
I run back thoughts of you

Thoughts of you keep me up at night
Up at night
Up at night
Thoughts of you keep me up at night (keep me up)
Up at night
Up at night
Thoughts of you keep me up at

I think about all of the ways you turn me on (turn me on)
And my bed gets lonely whenever you're gone (whenever you're gone)
And, baby, I'm a wreck without you (you)
All I do is fantasize about you ('bout you)
You're the light of my life, yeah, I mean it
Girl, you got what I want, when I need it
And even when the sun don't shine
I'll be right by your side
Holdin' you tight
And when you feel like nobody cares
I'll be right there, to remind you that

You keep me up at night (keep me up)
Up at night
Up at night
Thoughts of you keep me up at night (keep me up)
Up at night
Up at night
Thoughts of you keep me up at 

And what could I say?
I knew that it would go this way
Of course you blame it on fate (fate)
I couldn't let it just escape
At the end of our days
I run back thoughts of you

Thoughts of you keep me up at night
Up at night
Up at night (oh, up at night)
Thoughts of you keep me up at night (up at night)
Up at night (night)
Up at night
Thoughts of you keep me up at

Baby, the thought of you (uh)
You keep appearin' in my dreams
Huh, huh, uh
