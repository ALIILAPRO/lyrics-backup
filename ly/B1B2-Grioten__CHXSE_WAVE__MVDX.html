		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Which one do I choose
Bitch one bitch two
Ones got a fat ass
Ones got big boobs yuh
In my feelings I say achoo
Bitch I'm sick of this love shit I wanna be ruthless
Room full of red when I bring out the tool
Give me the ick when you look at me rude
Driving around with my whip in Shibuya
Calling me papi like bitch I ain't tuya
Like bitch, I ain't no Ken, but I'm cautious
Standstill like a Barbie, I lost it
Eat my shit and rot like a carcass
Talking all that shit got me nauseous
Yeah I smoke a cigarette,
Like bitch I'm on the run when I put your ass to rest
Why your ass weigh a ton when you looking so depressed
Bitch look me in the eyes, ima put you to the test
Don't ever look back, just go, be the best
Be the best motherfucker be the beat the rest yuh
If you want to win, you better say it with your chest
Hit a motherfucking PR looking at my ceps
Like bitch, you were never gonna fucking do less
Look at my flex, I don't even need to stretch
Look at my stats, I don't even need a test
Talking at that shit, bitch you looking like a pest
I don't want to hear bullshit coming from the bench
Don't need no friends, I got your bitch on my line
Ima cut you up in pieces, through you in a fire
I'm the king of the dead, tie your neck with a wire
If you ride with the team, better say your fucking vows
I don't give a fuck about the rules, I want to be the best
Ima put you in a chokehold punch you in your chest
When I look up at the mirror, all I see is fucking death
Now I pop a fucking perc, so I put it all to rest like bitch like
Which one do I choose
Bitch one bitch two
Ones got a fat ass
Ones got big boobs yuh
In my feelings I say achoo
Bitch I'm sick of this love shit I wanna be ruthless
Room full of red when I bring out the tool
Give me the ick when you look at me rude
Driving around with my whip in Shibuya
Calling me papi like bitch I ain't tuya
Which one do I choose
Bitch one bitch two
Ones got a fat ass
Ones got big boobs yuh
In my feelings I say achoo
Bitch I'm sick of this love shit I wanna be ruthless
Room full of red when I bring out the tool
Give me the ick when you look at me rude
Driving around with my whip in Shibuya
Calling me papi like bitch I ain't tuya
