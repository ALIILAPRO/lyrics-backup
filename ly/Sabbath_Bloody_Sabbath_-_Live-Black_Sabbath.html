		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You've seen right through distorted eyes
You know you had to learn
The execution of your mind
You really had to turn
The race is run, the book is read
The end begins to show
The truth is out, the lies are old
But you don't want to know

Nobody will ever let you know
When you ask the reasons why
They just tell you that you're on your own
Fill your head all full of lies

The people who have crippled you
You want to see them burn
The gates of life have closed on you
And there's just no return
You're wishing that the hands of doom
Could take your mind away
And you don't care if you don't see again
The light of day

Nobody will ever let you know
When you ask the reasons why
They just tell you that you're on your own
Fill your head all full of lies
You bastards

Where can you run to?
What more can you do?
No more tomorrow
Life is killing you
Dreams turn to nightmares
Heaven turns to hell
Burned out confusion
Nothing more to tell, yeah

Everything around you
What's it coming to?
God knows as your dog nose
Bog blast all of you
Sabbath bloody Sabbath
Nothing more to do
Living just for dying
Dying just for you, yeah
