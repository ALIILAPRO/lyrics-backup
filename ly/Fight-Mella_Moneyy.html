		<p>
		  Uh.... Big Moneyy
Bitch, run up on me better know how to fight
Keep ya nigga from me I'll fuck him out of spite
Pussy top tier me and sis not alike
Bitch so bad, (Yeah I'm everybody type)
If I catch a opp catch a body on sight 
Pretty lil bitch best advice don't get me tight
Yeah i'm bad on IG, and I'm bad in real life
If I give a nigga pussy I can change a nigga life 

Top notch bitch I ain't looking at a price tag 
1 of 1, yeah I'll make a nigga swipe that
Second that I let him get the pussy tryna wife that -
He a lucky nigga If I even type back 
Outside I been taking that risk, 
That's why I never understand why these bitches is pissed
Whole city know my body, yeah they know Mella lit 
I aint got shit to prove they could suck my dick 

Uh, 
I've been tryna keep it cool but this henny got me hype
Bitches really think they gangsta, only gangsta when they type
See the difference bout Mella, when you see me it's on sight
I aint nothing like them bitches on god I'm trained to fight 

Bitch, run up on me better know how to fight
Keep ya nigga from me I'll fuck him out of spite
Pussy top tier me and sis not alike
Bitch so bad, (Yeah I'm everybody type)
If I catch a opp catch a body on sight 
Pretty lil bitch best advice don't get me tight
Yeah i'm bad on IG, and I'm bad in real life
If I give a nigga pussy I can change a nigga life 

Outside, yeah I'm taking that risk
You aint eva gotta cap when you really that bitch 
Outside, yeah I'm taking that risk 
If a nigga violate pull up with a stick 
Outside yeah I'm taking that risk 
If my nigga pull up then I'm pleading the fifth 
Outside yeah I'm taking that risk
If a nigga violate then I'm taking his bitch

Uh, 
I've been tryna keep it cool but this henny got me hype
Bitches really think they gangsta, only gangsta when they type
See the difference bout Mella, when you see me it's on sight
I aint nothing like them bitches on god I'm trained to fight
