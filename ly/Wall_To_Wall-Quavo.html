		  Welcome to club Rocket Power
Where every night is baked potato loaded
This shit wall to wall, man
And every bitch in here
Oh yeah, she can be bought
Cash

Wall to wall, this lil' bitch she can be bought (woo)
Wall to wall, this lil' bitch she can be bought (wall to wall)
Wall to wall, this lil' bitch she can be bought (ooh, wall to wall)
Wall to wall, this lil' bitch she can be bought (go, know what I'm sayin'?)

Fuckin' this bitch in this bitch, wall to wall (wall)
Bitches keep lookin', she finna get bought
Hoardin' these racks, gotta get this shit off (racks)
Pop me a pill, tryna shake this shit off (pop it)
Mixin' with both, better get the kick off (woo)
Told her "Jump off" and she sucked the dick off (grr)
Ooh, when I catch 'em, my bad, I get off
I do it big, do this shit for Takeoff (Take')
Dance on my wrist, you can keep the TikTok (dance)
Hit me a lick, when I drop, bet I pop (pop)
Hustlin' big, bet I keep me a jaw (hustle)
Baked potato and it's loaded with dolls (geeked)
Bulletproof kit with the TV and all (grr)
Swear I'm not jackin' these niggas at all (swear)
I'm on a yacht, it's just me and some broads (yacht)
How the fuck you think a nigga get robbed? (Huh?)
Swear to God, nigga, I'm keepin' my card
Ain't nothin' sweet and ain't tryin' to be hard
I packed out the session, I swear, you should've saw (swear)
Put on my boots, like I'm steppin' in yards (uh)
This a new watch, it's the plain Richard (ah)
Rocks on my ear, baby, goin' retarded (rocks)
Fuck on a bitch, nigga, no remorse (God)
Lil' baby need a voice

Wall to wall, this lil' bitch she can be bought (wall to wall, bitch can be bought)
Wall to wall, this lil' bitch she can be bought (wall to wall, bitch can be bought)
Wall to wall, this lil' bitch she can be bought (ooh, wall to wall)
Wall to wall, this lil' bitch she can be bought (ooh, go, ooh)

Wall to wall, this lil' bitch she can be bought
Wall to wall, this lil' bitch she can be bought (wall to wall, bitch can be bought)
Wall to wall, this lil' bitch she can be bought (ooh, wall to wall)
Wall to wall, this lil' bitch she can be bought (woo, woo, woo)
Wall to wall

My niggas in this bitch, it's wall to wall and I can't even breathe (uh)
You know these outfits, baby, you can't OD when you playin' with me (quit playin')
Boy, get your bitch, 'cause she ended up puttin' on me, that's a fantasy (woo)
Walk in this bitch, get to talkin' that shit
When I get out the state, they be payin' me (yeah)
Wall to wall, this shit thick, can't post no pic'
'Cause the shit too lit (I'm tellin' you)
Shorty just stood on the table, just broke that shit
That bitch too thick (know what I'm sayin'?)
Finally rich with the gang, not from New York, we was servin' them Knicks
Come to my city, we geeked off a Percocet and I just six (woo)

Wall to wall, this lil' bitch she can be bought (wall to wall, bitch can be bought)
Wall to wall, this lil' bitch she can be bought (wall to wall, bitch can be bought)
Wall to wall, this lil' bitch she can be bought (ooh, wall to wall)
Wall to wall, this lil' bitch she can be bought (ooh, go, ooh)

And when you leave this club Rocket Power
Make sure you come back now
Wipe off all your sweat
And make sure you got that check
Long live the Rocket, baby
To infinity
