		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Get a life, get a grip
Get away somewhere, take a trip
Take a break, take control
Take advice from someone you know

Come on over, come on in
Pull up a seat, take a load off your feet
Come on over, come on in
You can unwind, take a load off your mind

Make a wish, make a move
Make up your mind, you can choose
When you're up, when you're down
When you need a laugh come around

Come on over, come on in
Pull up a seat, take a load off your feet
Come on over, come on in
You can unwind, take a load off your mind

Oh, oh, oh

Be a winner, be a star
Be happy to be who you are
Gotta be yourself, gotta make a plan
Gotta go for it while you can

Come on over, come on in
Pull up a seat, take a load off your feet
Come on over, come on in
You can unwind, take a load off your mind

Get a life, get a grip
Get away somewhere, take a trip
Take a break, take control
Take advice from someone you know

Come on over, come on in
Pull up a seat, take a load off your feet
Come on over, come on in
You can unwind, take a load off your mind

Come on over, come on in
Come on come on in
I said yeah yeah
Oh, oh, oh
Come on over, come on in
