		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Getting drunk from the river
Getting bored with the view
Just another dublin sunrise
Reminding me of you

Just another hungry hour
And I thought I saw your face on the train today
Thought I saw your face on the train today

Tried to sleep for a while
On a pillow full of tears
Another dublin night filled with loneliness and fear

Just another silent message from friend to friend
And I thought I saw you standing where the river ends
Thought I saw you standing where the river ends

Sitting by a statue all on my own
There's a busker standing on the lawn he said
I'll sing you one song if you throw me some money my dear

I'm gonna lay in the heavens
I'm gonna stare at the sky
Another dublin day dreaming of you by my side

Just another hungry yearner on the beaches of Ray
And I thought I saw your face on the train today
Thought I held your hand on the train today

Sitting by a statue all on my own
There's a busker standing on the lawn he said
I'll sing you one song if you throw me some money my dear
