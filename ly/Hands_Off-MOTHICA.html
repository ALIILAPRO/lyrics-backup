		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  all of my friends
don’t know where i’ve been
cause i’m getting good at lying
maybe i’m in denial 
I feel too much 
but it’s never enough
I’m coming out of hiding
nobody else invited 

you know i’ve been getting to know a new side of myself
what can you do?
can’t even get through the night 
yeah I could use some help 

i’d be down for sweet talk
so much I could say 
do whatever you want
we could misbehave
baby leave the light on
i wanna see your face
keep your eyes on me
keep your eyes on me 
but your hands off

don’t get ahead of yourself
I know what you want
yeah I know what you’re implying 
there’s something about the timing
so don’t get too close 
we’re taking it slow
you touch me like your impatient 
it’s getting complicated 

you know i’ve been getting to know a new side of myself
what can you do?
I can’t even get through the night yeah I could use some help 

i’d be down for sweet talk
so much I could say 
do whatever you want
we could misbehave
baby leave the light on
i wanna see your face
keep your eyes on me
keep your eyes on me 
but your hands off

cause I want, I want control
but you take, you take
and I never know
what to say, what to say
so I don’t, so I don’t....

i’d be down for sweet talk
so much I could say 
do whatever you want
we could misbehave
baby leave the light on
i wanna see your face
keep your eyes on me
keep your eyes on me 
but your hands off
