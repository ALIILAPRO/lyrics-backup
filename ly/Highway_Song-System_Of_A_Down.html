		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I need, I feel a love
You love to love the fear
I never wanna be alone
I've forgotten to

The road keeps moving clouds
The clouds become unreal
I guess I'll always be at home

Do you want me to try?
Directing your night

An exit lights the sky
The sky becomes complete
Traveling hearts divide the throne
I've forgotten to

Friction, lines, bumps
The Highway Song complete
The signs are all turning right

Do you want me to try?
Directing your night
Want me to try?
Directing your light

The purest forms of life
Our days are never coming back
The cannons of our time
Our days are never coming back

The purest forms of life
Our days are never coming back
The cannons of our time, our
Days are never ever coming back

Our days are never coming back
Our days are never coming back
Our days are never coming back
