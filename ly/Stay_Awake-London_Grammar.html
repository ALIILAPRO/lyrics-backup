		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I am the blank page before you
I am the fine idea you crave
I live and breathe under the moon
And when you cross that bridge
I'll come find you

Stay awake with me
You know I can't just let you be
Stay awake with me
Take your hand and come and find me

I don't have a skin like you do
To keep it all in like you do
I don't have a soul like you
The only one I have
Is the one I stole from you

Stay awake with me
You know I can't just let you be
Stay awake with me
Take your hand and come and find me
Stay awake with me
You know I can't just let you be
Stay awake with me
Take your hand and come and find me
