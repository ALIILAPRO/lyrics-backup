		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Could you bleed the lines?
If we shoot for a pile-up
‘cus mine were illegible
And that was intentional
But I knew you'd untie them

It must be nice in your element
I'd be lying if I said I was
And it might be kind of irrelevant
But I'll be fine, if hesitant

Could you see behind me
In the roof of your eyelids?
It wasn't a spectacle
And that was commendable
But I knew you'd be tired

I'd been trying to get the courage up
Cutting lines in my abdomen
Losing light, bеtter pack it up
Spend some timе on my own for once
