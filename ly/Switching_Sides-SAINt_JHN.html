		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Murda on the beat, so it's not nice) Ayy

Me switching sides, them niggas ain't ridin'
Them niggas ain't loyal, they didn't love you
They know it ain't tomorrow
They really actin' like time really ain't borrowed
I know the sorrows
They switching sides, them niggas wasn't ridin' with you
They ain't loyal, they didn't love you
They actin' like they know you
The things you go through
And they was never for you

Who do I blame? Balancin' the pain
Valentina frames, heart full of rage
Hard to crack a smile when the scars still remain
Toast in the year for ones who ain't changed
Dope dealer drained, Porsche in the rain
Nights on the train, squads screamin', "Gang"
'Member watchin' Menace, really had a need to scream
Mama workin' double, I can still feel the strain
Don't keep 'em in, hoes be betrayin'
Lost to the fame, crossin' the flame
Daps and the smiles, fake it, don't feel the same
I come from the gutter, so I'm strapped and I'm prayin' (ayy)

Me switching sides, them niggas ain't ridin'
Them niggas ain't loyal, they didn't love you
They know it ain't tomorrow
They really actin' like time really ain't borrowed
I know the sorrows
They switching sides, them niggas wasn't ridin' with you
They ain't loyal, they didn't love you
They actin' like they know you
The things you go through
And they was never for you

Who do I blame? Look who I became
Roc-a-fella chain, try not be ashamed of the friends that you lose
When you're at your lowest, time it will confuse
Pray for better news, chasin' revenue
You been grounded enough, you comin' up, you from the bottom
Long nights, just to spite 'em, I don't put the top on
Better things, slander names, really tryna block 'em
Only 'cause they're insecure to be forgotten
I'm comin' down out there
It's gettin' cold out here
We gettin' snow down here
Can't slow down yet
Scandal down here
They lettin' blood out here
Click-clack, unload, reload load out here
Done with the lies, I'm done with the lies
I'm seein' right through in they eyes, yeah, yeah
Tell 'em goodbyes, I'm yellin' goodbyes
I'm seein' right now in their vibe they hate
Two of my brothers, we used to be closed
And now we ain't speakin' so much these days
Clear to me nobody's perfect, not on the surface
I hate to be one day late
Corner niggas switching for the linemen
Public school niggas flyin' private
They don't even stop when I'm arriving
Still feel they hate when I close my eyelids (ay)

Me switching sides, them niggas ain't ridin'
Them niggas ain't loyal, they didn't love you
They know it ain't tomorrow
They really actin' like time really ain't borrowed
I know the sorrows
They switching sides, them niggas wasn't ridin' with you
They ain't loyal, they didn't love you
They actin' like they know you
The things you go through
And they was never for you
