		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now is the time for me to rise to my feet
Wipe your spit from my face
Wipe these tears from my eyes [Repeat: x2]

(Now is the time)
I've got to take my life back
One chance to make it right
I've gotta have my voice be heard
And bring meaning to this life
Cause I've trusted for nothing
I've been led astray
I've been tried and tested
But I won't accept defeat
Now I've done things I regret
And its time to reverse the rules
I just want to make good on all the promises that I have made

I will be
I will be heard
I will be heard

Now is the time

Through the worst we prevail
So our voices will be heard
Through the worst we prevail
So our voices will be heard

Now is the time [Repeat: x2]

I've got to take my life back

I will be
I will be heard
I will be heard [Repeat: x2]
