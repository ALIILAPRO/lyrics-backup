		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Old love, you're breaking me up
Burn, burnin' like sun
I don't forget like an elephant
It's imprinted on my heart

I don't forget
The sun don't set for me

Don't leave me here, don't leave me here
Don't leave me here, don't leave me here
'Cause I can't forget, 'cause I can't forget
It's burnin', still burnin'

Oh, I should have known
I'd blister here alone
And you'd find your own shade

I don't forget
The sun don't set for me

Don't leave me here, don't leave me here
Don't leave me here, don't leave me here
I can't forget, I can't forget
It's burnin', still burnin'
Everywhere I turn and every scar that burns
God, will I never learn?
I can't forget, I can't forget
It's burnin', still burnin'

'Cause I can't forget, I can't forget
It's burnin', still burnin'
