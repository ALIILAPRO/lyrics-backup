		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Whoa, oh
So far, so good
Mm, oh, yeah

Why? You only say you love me when you're high 
It's like we go through the same shit every night 
Oh why, oh why?
You always swear that it's gonna change, but it never does 
Why? You'll only say you love me when you're high 
It's like we go through the same shit every night 
Oh why, oh why?
You always swear that shit's gonna change, but it never does

Tell me that you're gonna change
Then act like this instead
I'm too old to want somebody who's always switching up their friends 
I can't make you love me but at least you could pretend 
Scrips gon' lead to fifths until I'm fucked out of my head 

You play the same old songs, I know that you're different in your Air Force 1s 
Filling my prescription, I could bite your tongue 
Like I got an addiction, yeah 
You always say this shit's gonna change, but it never does

Why? You only say you love me when you're high 
It's like we go through the same shit every night 
Oh why, oh why?
You always swear that it's gonna change, but it never does 
Why? You'll only say you love me when you're high 
It's like we go through the same shit every night 
Oh why, oh why?
You always swear that shit's gonna change, but it never does

I know it's my fault, I pick up your phone calls
When it's half past one and you're halfway drunk 
You say you love me and it sounds so dumb 
But you're the only one I can't run away from

The same old songs, I know that you're different in your Air Force 1s 
Filling my prescription, I could bite your tongue 
Like I got an addiction, yeah 
You always say this shit's gonna change, but it never does

Why? You only say you love me when you're high 
It's like we go through the same shit every night 
Oh why, oh why?
You always swear that it's gonna change, but it never does 
Why? You'll only say you love me when you're high 
It's like we go through the same shit every night 
Oh why, oh why?
You always swear that shit's gonna change, but it never does

You always swear that shit's gonna change, but it never does
