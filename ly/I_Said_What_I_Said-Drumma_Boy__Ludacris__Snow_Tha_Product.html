		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey yeah boy yeah, I said what I said, hoe
Hey yeah boy yeah, I said what I said, hoe
Hey yeah boy yeah, said what I said, Luda

Ha still nobody fucking with me
Whole crew, all we do is ball like niggas
Stuck in the bubble wit me
Go against me, not smart
I'm the Grand Wizard, you want no parts
You a scarecrow, you get no brain
Like the tin man, you got no heart
Cowardly lion
Y'all be cowardly lying about all the money
You make or the money you fake 22 acres
Raining money soon as you come in my gate
Let it monsoon, where the stormtroopers?
If stars warring, I'm Gеorge Lucas
Don't blame me if your whorе choosing
Like Easy E I was born ruthless
Attitude is on nigga rich
And driving whips off the dealership
Fuck school, all I had to learn was
Reading contracts and good penmanship
No censorship, this is real as it gets
I'm a boss boy, you a worker
I'm a savage dog
My catalogue'll kill all rappers in a Versus
Luda!

Party through the roof, yeah
They know we the truth, yeah (I ain't lying)
She look like that ooh, yeah
They come by the two, yeah (I ain't lying)
We be deep like them troops, yeah
Got it in my roots, yeah (I ain't lying)
We gon' show up, don't lose it, yeah
End up in the news, yeah (I ain't lying)

It's the champagne popping ass
Impala hopping ass Mexicana bitch
'bout to pop shit
Por si no sabian esta mami, go from
Speaking Spanish, hasta barras en Ingles
I give you options i'm up in this bitch
I got the whip and bitches topless
Got it on my own
I know the margins and the profit's
I listened to "Tell It How It
Is" and this shit's obvious
It's ludicrous how much money I
Got up in my pockets
But I got me some haters
I'll get to 'em later i'm up in Colombia
Buying apartments in Grenada
Everywhere I go I take my flag and I wave it
Signed myself to myself and now
I only talk in acres
I'm a big bag getter, bad bitch breaker-offer
Big talker but I bet I bet
On everything I talk about
I'm a looker like my mother and
A fighter like my father and
All my cousins out here looking like
An episode of "Locked Up"
If I said it then I meant it
Bitch I keep it one hunnid
So I'm checking your percentage
If I want it then I get it no cosign
Real bad bitches build they own credit
If I said it then I meant it
Bitch I keep it one hunnid
So I'm checking your percentage
If I want it then I get it no cosign
Real bad bitches build they own credit

Party through the roof, yeah
They know we the truth, yeah (I ain't lying)
She look like that ooh, yeah
They come by the two, yeah (I ain't lying)
We be deep like them troops, yeah
Got it in my roots, yeah (I ain't lying)
We gon' show up, don't lose it, yeah
End up in the news, yeah (I ain't lying)

Yeah, said what I said, hoe
Uh, I said what I said, hoe
Yeah, I said what I said, hoe
Uh, I said what I said, bitch
