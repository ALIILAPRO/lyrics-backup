		  It didn’t kill me but something inside me died that day…
I know i must’ve been alone, but I got no “Godgive” to speculate

Seems like I was wrong today
It such a lovely day

I never thought somebody gets me (so)
I never thought it would be you
Gives me a butterfly when you call me by baby.

Did you know you’re looking great?
Would you let me to go for a date?
I’ll go wherever you want me to go
So hold on tight, babe you got me tonight

Seems like I was right today
It’s such a lovely day, it’s a, it’s a lovely day

I never thought somebody gets me (so)
I never thought it would be you
Gives me a butterfly when you call me by baby.
You call me by baby
You call me by baby..

I said all night
All fucking night
Tease me from body to body
Till you drive me nuts…

It’s a lovely day
It’s a lovely day 
It’s a lovely day
Lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely day
It’s a lovely day

I never thought somebody gets me (so)
I never thought it would be you
Gives me a butterfly when you call me by baby.

I never thought somebody gets me (so)
I never thought it would be you
Gives me a butterfly when you call me by baby.

I said all night
All fucking night
Tease me from body to body
Till you drive me nuts…
