		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It starts with life, a way to live
I love the sound of pain
The more it hurts the better I feel
The world will fall insane
It comes to me late late at night
When I feel like being cruel
Whip out the chains and get the knife
And slay some innocent fool

Get in our way and we're going to take your life
Kick in your face and rape and murder your wife
Plunder your town your homes they'll burn to the ground
You won't hear a sound until my knife's in your back
The exodus attack

The filthy sound of death and pain
Brings pleasure that I need
The rotting hide the burning flesh
The smell and I agree
Bloody corpse makes me feel great
Painkiller in my life
Cut bare flesh to the bone
Use a rusty knife

Get in our way and we're going to take your life
Kick in your face and rape and murder your wife
Plunder your town your homes they'll burn to the ground
You won't hear a sound until my knife's in your back
The exodus attack

Buzzards eat as well as worms
Nature's death machines
Pin you on the desert floor
Now you're Hell's cuisine
I tell you all it's the way to live
Get stronger on death glory
Infringing on sacrificial rites
Death's your final story

Get in our way and we're going to take your life
Kick in your face and rape and murder your wife
Plunder your town your homes they'll burn to the ground
You won't hear a sound until my knife's in your back
The exodus attack
