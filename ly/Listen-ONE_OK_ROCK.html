		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You always call me full of regret
You want me to save you again

After all these years, the days go by
I've seen you fall a million times
Everybody makes mistakes
It feels so hard to watch you hurt
From that pain a lesson learned
This is how you find your way

You feel so lost
I've been there, too
Skies so dark no way through
Stories only scars can tell

I've got so much love for you my friend
Ride or die until the end
But only you can save yourself

You just have to listen, listen
I hope that you know
Listen, listen
I won't let you go
I wish I could save you from the pain you've been through
And all I can tell you is the best thing to do
(You gotta) listen, listen
(Ah) listen, listen
(Ah) listen, listen
(Ah) to your heart (ah)

Listen, listen
Listen, listen
Listen, listen, I hope that you know
Listen, listen, I won't let you go (i won't let you go)

I wish I could save you from the pain you've been through
And all I can tell you is the best thing to do (the best thing to do)
(You gotta) listen, listen
(Ah) listen, listen
(Ah) listen, listen
(Ah) to your heart (to your heart)
(Ah)
Listen, listen (ah)
To your heart (ah)
