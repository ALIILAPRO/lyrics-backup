And people stop and stare
I'll make a killing from this change

I'll make your troubles fold
Might take your diamonds but I'll steal your heart

But now you've stumbled on a winning hand, a hard eight
You crossed your fingers and wished upon a shooting star
But now you're dealing with the wildcard
