		  (Ayah)
I DON’T GIVE NO FUCKS, (FUCK)
TALK MY SHIT, GET PAID AND MOVE ON, (ON)
I DON’T PREACH I JUST SAY WHAT I WANT,
WHAT THE FUCK IS UP?
WHAT THE FUCK IS UP?
(Uh) (Ah)
I DON’T GIVE NO FUCKS, (FUCK)
TALK MY SHIT, GET PAID AND MOVE ON, (ON)
I DON’T PREACH I JUST SAY WHAT I WANT,
WHAT THE FUCK IS UP?
WHAT THE FUCK IS UP?

Ay,
You ain’t seen a beast like me,
Come change the game like this,
This shit don’t come for free,
That pussy down so bad he ain’t as bad as me
Everything I live I die by,
Fuck you mean?

FUCK YOU MEAN BITCH,
ILL FUCK YOU UP,
I DON’T GIVE A FUCK ABOUT YOU,
(Ugh)

Ive come far too far for my own comfort,
I’m going insane 
This the last time I’m giving you one chance
NOW,

TELL ME, (Yuh)
TELL ME THEIRS ONE WAY TO GET THROUGH THIS PAIN 
(ah)

I HAVE COME FAR TO FAR FOR MY OWN COMFORT IM GOING INSANE
THIS THE LAST TIME IM GIVING YOU
ONE CHANCE TO RECTIFY

(Ayah)
I DON’T GIVE NO FUCKS, (FUCK)
TALK MY SHIT, GET PAID AND MOVE ON, (ON)
I DON’T PREACH I JUST SAY WHAT I WANT,
WHAT THE FUCK IS UP?
WHAT THE FUCK IS UP?
(Uh) (ah)
I DON’T GIVE NO FUCKS, (FUCK)
TALK MY SHIT, GET PAID AND MOVE ON, (ON)
I DON’T PREACH I JUST SAY WHAT I WANT,
WHAT THE FUCK IS UP?
WHAT THE FUCK IS UP?
