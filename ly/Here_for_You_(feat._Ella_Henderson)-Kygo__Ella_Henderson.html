		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We'll be passing by
And they'll be wasting time
Just waiting for new
And while they're chasing darks
We'll be dancing in the dusk
'Cause we're coming through
Whenever you need me I'm behind
And I promise to take you off to the heights

When you feel you've had enough, and you wasted all your love
I'll be here for you, here for you
When the dog is at his bone, and you run away from home
I'll be here for you, here for you

Well I'm here for you, I'm here for you, you, you
I'm here for you, yeah, I'm here for you, you, you

And while they're on the ground
We'll be looking down
'Cause we found the truth
And the fire in our hearts
Will be blowing up the stars
Now we're coming through
Whenever you're feeling down inside
I promise to take you off to the height

Oh yeah, I'm here for you
And when you feel you've had enough, and you've wasted all your love
I'll be here for you

Well I'm here for you, I'm here for you, you, you
I'm here for you, yeah, I'm here for you, you, you
