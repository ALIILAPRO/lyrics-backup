		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Overthink tomorrow, we’ll be alright
That’s where we forget just who we are 
Make it come together if it feels right
That’s when you forget just who we are

Overthink tomorrow, we’ll be alright
That’s where we forget just who we are 
Make it come together if it feels right
That’s when you forget just who we are

Noises in your head, keep them inside
That’s how you forget just who we are 
Feeling out of phase on a good night
That’s when we forget just who we are

Forget who we are
Forget who we are
Forget who we are
Forget who we are
Forget who we are
Forget who we are

Forget who we are
Forget who we are
Forget who we are
Forget who we are
Forget who we are
