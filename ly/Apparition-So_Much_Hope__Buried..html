		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're fading, eyes wander
Feeling your breath I reach but then you disappear, you disappear
I'll say a prayer, you know that I just need you here and soon I'll feel your spirit
The echo of your goodbye has faded
I wish I knew where you were in the afterlife
Seeking solace in your apparition
Reaching into the cosmos so I can find your ghost
Your presence reappeared
Your image barely clear
But now you're fading again
I'm all alone again
Staring blankly at the ceiling of my room
I hope to God you make amends sometime soon
I constantly wonder why you're here
I'm trying to understand
The echo of your goodbye has faded
I wish I knew where you were in the afterlife
Seeking solace in your apparition
Reaching into the cosmos so I can find your ghost
I'll wipe my eyes an afterimage was shown
A sense of wonder of a vivid dream
Under lock and key I'm paralyzed by the sight
Of your vague silhouette
I wish I knew where you were in the afterlife
Seeking solace in your apparition
Reaching into the cosmos
I wish I knew where you were in the afterlife
So I can find your ghost
