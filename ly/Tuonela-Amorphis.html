		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sorrow is my bread
And tears I drink as wine
Oblivion my happiness
Ground under teeth of time

For cold be the stone
When frost ve devoured the land
Consolation is no gift
Of winter's icy hand

[Chorus:]
Upon a crust of snow
I'll lay my broken frame
What steel and iron won't take
I'll give in winter's name
No good a sullen sout no use a simple knave
No groom for brides of plaited hair
This man old and lame

If only I could breathe
To see the sun of may
but still longer are the nigths than days
As I wither away

Came the man of crown
With sound of war drums beat
Said no sword arm's strong enough
Without my two good feet

[Chorus]

But not overlooked am I
In eyes of the maid I'll wed
I'll reap the crops of Tuonela
My bride's wealth in death
