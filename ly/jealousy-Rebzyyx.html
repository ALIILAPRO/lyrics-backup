		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm fucking sorry for everything
I wanna take it back
I wanna have you back
My world is over, I can't see your face
I wanna hold your hand
I wanna be your man
I think about you like so much
When I'm with you, I glow up
Let's die together, let's grow up
Run away, yeah, no one will know us
I really hate everything besides you
All I want is to be beside you
I don't know why I'm so jealous
Hate the sun, I'm just so jealous
Jealousy, jealousy
Agony, agony
Torture, torture
And me, and me
Jealousy, jealousy
Agony, agony
Torture, torture
And me

I'm done, set everything from you
But that's up to you
But that's up to you
Just tell me if I need to go
It's up to you
It's all up to you

I'm fucking sorry for everything
I wanna take it back
I wanna have you back
My world is over, I can't see your face
I wanna hold your hand
I wanna be your man
I think about you like so much
When I'm with you, I glow up
Let's die together, let's grow up
Run away, yeah, no one will know us
I really hate everything besides you
All I want is to be beside you
I don't know why I'm so jealous
Hate the sun, I'm just so jealous
Jealousy, jealousy
Agony, agony
Torture, torture
And me, and me
Jealousy, jealousy
Agony, agony
Torture, torture
And me
