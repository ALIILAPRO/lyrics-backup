Hahahahahaha

Meds in my socks, I took off down the block
I been running all my life, think it's time to stop
I am so damn tired, body wanna drop, ah
It is so lonely, lonely at the top, ah
Meds in my socks, I took off down the block
I been running all my life, think it's time to stop, ah
I am so tired, body wanna drop, ah
It is so lonely, lonely at the top, ah

I got what they want and it's still not enough
Hole so deep inside and I can't stuff it up
Whether it's with these hoes or with these drugs (Or with these drugs)
I don't wanna be here, wanna get the fuck
Miss my family and I miss my girl
I try my best to give them all the world
Feel like I am not enough sometimes (Sometimes)
Crying in my hands, like, "Why?"
Love me for who I am, don't love me for what I do
Love you with everything, tell me "I love you too"
I done gave everything, I don't got nothing left
I am exhausted, still wish you all the best

Meds in my socks, I took off down the block
I been running all my life, think it's time to stop
I am so damn tired, body wanna drop, ah
It is so lonely, lonely at the top, ah
Meds in my socks, I took off down the block
I been running all my life, think it's time to stop, ah
I am so tired, body wanna drop, ah
It is so lonely, lonely at the top, ah

I can see my Dad's shame in his eyes
Feel like he wasn't enough and don't know why (Don't know why)
I'm sorry if I made you feel more than less
Did everything for me, you did your best
I can see myself in my brothers
I got some traits from my mother (From my mother)
Sometimes it do scare me
Sometimes I get worried
Hope they don't be like me, I gotta leave in a hurry
Don't want them picking up habits
Don't want them feeling all damaged
I would give my life for them
Right now, trying hard to swim

Meds in my socks, I took off down the block
I been running all my life, think it's time to stop
I am so damn tired, body wanna drop, ah
It is so lonely, lonely at the top, ah
Meds in my socks, I took off down the block
I been running all my life, think it's time to stop, ah
I am so tired, body wanna drop, ah
It is so lonely, lonely at the top, ah
