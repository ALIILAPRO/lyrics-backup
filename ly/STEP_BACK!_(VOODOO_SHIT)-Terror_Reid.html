		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If youza punk bitch, listen up:

Quiet down, the boss boutta speak
And word on the street is, “he came from tha undaneath”
Knockin boots of ya feet man, he kinda neat
Enough to go around so pull up a seat
Yain know bout the power i bestow
I pop and Adderall and my eyes start to glow
And when I’m in that shit, yo, i float like a boat
Might open up a store cuz these fools always want some more
Don’t get it twisted mane, this kid cuckoo
He prolly fuck with voodoo
You say you know but the never knew you
Im finna show em how i do, dude
The rap guru
And if there’s static bitch, im runnin through you
Cuz yo
Reid higher than a double jump
I wrote this shit off a bump in 2 minutes and it still slump
Now close ya eyes, and keep that bunk shit behind me
And if you really want it G, you know where I’ll be…
—
CHORUS
(so where you at?)
I’m in the Eames leaned back (right)
Ain’t got a dolla for yo ass, step back
These suckaz new (true)
Its like they still got a tag, what’s up with that? i give the game a bubble bath
No matter what they want, ima kick em in the ass, givem a zap
These fools giving me a rash
The illest mofucka ya ever gon’ see
You know who it is so mothafucka come and find me

Verse 2
Oooo this dude a boss,
Reachin for the mic like them hoes reachin for his balls, mane he can do it all
I heard them say they seen him floatin through walls
Makin the calls, double dippin’ in all the sauce
Affirmative, yain’t heard of this
He always curve a bitch, man this boy don’t ever quit
And now he’s taking down the building you living in
Then dig ya out just to peep the fit he did it in
Sick, Nasty
Pullin in with a bitch lookin real classy
Peep how thick the ass be
Off them pills got me feelin greater that the Gatsby
Hit the gas, cuz ya ass ain’t ever gonna pass me
Damn straight, now where you tryna play?
I got some bitches mane and they sippin tanqueray
And if you tryna do it, try to do it just like this
Im in the kitchen showin these chumps where the spice is
—
CHORUS
(so where you at?)
I’m in the Eames leaned back (right)
Ain’t got a dolla for yo ass, step back
These suckaz new (true)
Its like they still got a tag, what’s up with that? i give the game a bubble bath
No matter what they want, ima kick em in the ass, givem a zap
These fools giving me a rash
The illest mofucka ya ever gon’ see
You know who it is so mothafucka come and find me
Ya bitch,its ya boy
We back in it
And boy this is just the beginning
DYNAMO whatchu know?
Yaint seen this one from a mile away
Prolly more
Yaint gon see dis shit in store
