		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Smashing society killing with might
Ripping flesh and brains I come at night
I am created by all that is evil
Satanic lust humans must die
Feasting on flesh and the blood of others
I will slay you then go for another
Rip out her eyes I reach for her soul
I fuck her dead and tear out her hole

Mutilation killing to live
You are my victim on flesh I feed
10,000 corpses in my path
And I will get the blood I need

A thousand bodies blood flowing fast
Half your face rotting away
Infectious disease decayed to the bone
Rigor mortis sets in I eat as I lay

Nuns in the church find one kneeling
Look at the cross with God she is dealing
I will kill her her holy lie
Right in front of God this nun must die
I approach her now where do I start
Fucked on the altar I rip her apart
I eat her brains now she's dead
I fuck her again and smash her head
