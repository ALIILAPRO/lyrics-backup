		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
My love
Love, my love

Been controlling the hisses and smoking a bit
Ain't got a hold of this business, I'm going with it
I know he hope when he give it, it's only a gift
I couldn't glow where I fit in, I'm lonely as shit
I hope your hope's still with me, this only a trip
I can't float in this city, unholy abyss
It mean the most when you hit me, it show I exist
I couldn't cope with these feelings like Romeo did
That puffer coat been a victim, the coldest of winds
I wanna mope but resist it, I owe it to win
I'll be your coach, give you tips on this culture ascent
For sure that rope getting thinner, I overextend
On the coast of repenting, I almost can swim
But I'm too focused on revenging the culprit again
I swear I wrote this with intention of closing this bridge
He let her go to that extent, ain't no shoulder to give
I know that potion never answer, the dosage is big
I wanna blow up but it's cherished, I owe it to twin
I'm always hoping you the nearest, you always a gift

We about to play some exclusive shit
So back the fuck off my face if you ain't talking 'bout no cheesecake
