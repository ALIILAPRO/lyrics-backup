		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Go back to your country, where you belong
Siri, can you tell me where I belong?
Go back to the country where you belong
Siri, can you tell if the road is long?

I look like them, but not to them
I sound like you, but not to you
I look like them, but not to them
I sound like you, but not to you

Don't sound like what I look like
Don't look like what I sound like
Don't sound like what I look like
Don't look like what I sound like
To them

What is them? (I am here)
Who are you? ('Cause you were there)
We and them (I am here)
What's it to you? ('Cause you were there)
We or them? (I am here)
What are you? ('Cause you were there)
Gotta choose (gotta choose)
You gotta choose (you gotta choose)

Don't sound like what I look like
Don't look like what I sound like
Don't sound like what I look like
Don't look like what I sound like

Go back to your country, where you belong
Siri, can you tell me where I belong?
Go back to your country, where you belong
Siri, can you tell if the road is long?

Siri, seriously
C'est pas par ici
Maman, pourquoi t'es partie?
Pourquoi t'es partie?
Kai yo, kai yo pa kai nou
Yo ka ren mwen fou
Chez moi, chez moi, c'est chez toi
Bienvenue, j'sais pas

Go back to your country, where you belong
(Go back, bye-bye)
Siri, can you tell me where I belong?
(Take a hike-hike)
Go back to the country where you belong
(Don't ask why, why)
Siri, can you tell if the road is long?
(Have a nice flight)
(Go back to your country, where you belong)
(Go back, bye-bye)
