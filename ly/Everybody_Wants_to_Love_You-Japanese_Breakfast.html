		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can I get your number?
Can I get you into bed?
When we wake up in the morning
Will you give me lots of head?

(Everybody wants to love you)
Everybody wants to love you
(Everybody wants to love you)
Everybody wants to love you
(Everybody wants to love you)

Will you lend me your toothbrush?
Will you make me breakfast in bed?
Ask me to get married
And then make me breakfast again

(Everybody wants to love you)
Everybody wants to love you
(Everybody wants to love you)
Everybody wants to love you
(Everybody wants to love you)
Everybody wants to love you
(Everybody wants to love you)

(Everybody wants to love you)
Everybody wants to love you
(Everybody wants to love you)
Everybody wants to love you
(Everybody wants to love you)
