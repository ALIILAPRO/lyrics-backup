		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Morning rise
Everything has come too soon
The fight last night
Left you broke and bruised
You watched everything here
We'll just let you down
Searching for something you haven't found
I'm not sure what it all might mean


Sleep it off baby when tomorrow comes than maybe we can work it all out
Sleep it off baby when tomorrow comes than maybe we can work it all out
Right now
The best is yet to come


Turn and turn
Everything takes it's toll
You step outside side
Summer time it leads you home
You've been waiting a long time for this to pass
Nothing healed
Will it ever last
I'm not sure just who I was


Sleep it off baby when tomorrow comes than maybe we can work it all out
Sleep it off baby when tomorrow comes than maybe we can work it all out
Don't cry baby
We can work it all out
Don't cry baby
We can work it all out


Step outside
You wanna be somebody
Well I can give you what you need
(x4)


Sleep it off baby when tomorrow comes than maybe we can work it all out
Sleep it off baby when tomorrow comes than maybe we can work it all out
Don't cry baby
We can work it all out
Don't cry baby
We can work it all out
Right now the best is yet to come
