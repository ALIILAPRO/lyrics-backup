		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're a monster
(It's Great John beats, baby)
(Great John on the beat by the way)

G-lock on me
They like, "Watchu gon' do with that?"
Look
G-lock on me
Look, look
Turn my voice up

Look, look (gang, gang, gang, gang)
G-lock on me, huh
They like, "Watchu gon' do with that?"
Look, look, look, look, finish 'em, push your Medulla back
G-lock on me, huh, huh
They like, "Watchu gon' do with that?"
Look, look, look, finish 'em, push your Medulla back

I know they watchin' me 
I gotta move with a better plan, keep a gun in hand
Ayy, ayy, look, look, different man 
You won't understand, no, I know they watchin' me
Look, see you niggas copyin' game 
Look, look, look, look, see me in person and did you the same

Look, caught 'em lackin', huh
He tried runnin', where you goin' stupid?
Look, huh, disrespect you know I had to do it
All the action, huh, niggas chattin' so we put 'em through it
Look, bitch I'm with Draco, ask 'em how I do it
Poppin' out, straight AMG's for when we ridin' out
Can't leave a witness, could call us Hefner's we got all the bitches
Keep your distance, reach for my pendant put you on a pendant
That's the endin', so much transactions my breach levels pendin'
Fuck you mean?
Get with the, get with the winnin' team
Look, just made some millions, boy you won't believe
Fuck you heard? 
Don't do no sorries, boy, you can't coerce me
Don't need no new friends, I can't trust a soul

Look, look, look, uh
G-lock on me
They like, "Watchu gon' do with that?"
Look, look, look, look, finish 'em, push your Medulla back
G-lock on me, huh, huh
They like, "Watchu gon' do with that?"
Look, look, look, finish 'em, push your Medulla back

I know they watchin' me 
I gotta move with a better plan, keep a gun in hand
Ayy, ayy, look, look, different man 
You won't understand, no, I know they watchin' me
Look, see you niggas copyin' game 
Look, look, look, look, see me in person and did you the same

Look
Gang, go get 'em gang
Go gang, go get 'em gang
Go gang, go get 'em gang
Go gang
