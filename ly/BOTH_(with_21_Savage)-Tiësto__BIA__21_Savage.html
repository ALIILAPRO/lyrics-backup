		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Don't you tell me that it's love or money, I want both
Ain't no way I let you take one from me, I want both
Dollar bills, all the feelings I can feel
Let 'em know, let 'em know, let 'em know
I want both
Don't you tell me that it's love or money, I want both
Ain't no way I let you take one from me, I want both
Dollar bills, all the feelings I can feel (uh)
Let 'em know, let 'em know, let 'em know (Tiësto, BIA-BIA)
I want both

If it's money or the love, I need both of them (frrp, cash)
In the back of the 'Bach, I need both my friends (uh)
I'm in London, L.A., like it's both my ends
All these Ms that I fend for, I'm supposed to spend (skrrt)
I'm a real player, no rookie (uh)
I'ma have my cake if you want this cookie (want this cookie)
He said, "Gimme that gushy" (cash)
I said, "I need a hunnid K or better to book me" (uh)
I like my money, I like your money
I like walk-through, residual and show money (frrp)
BIA beat the beat up like it stole from me
Been a long time since I had no money, uh (yeah)
Please keep quiet when the big boss talkin'
We found love in a penthouse apartment (uh)
I got drivers, I do no walkin' (uh, uh)
Why would I choose when you know I got options?

Don't you tell me that it's love or money, I want both
Ain't no way I let you take one from me, I want both
Dollar bills, all the feelings I can feel
Let 'em know, let 'em know, let 'em know
I want both
Don't you tell me that it's love or money, I want both
Ain't no way I let you take one from me, I want both
Dollar bills, all the feelings I can feel
Let 'em know, let 'em know, let 'em know
I want both

Both, both
Let 'em know, I want both
Both, both
Let 'em know, let 'em know (21, 21, 21)
I want both

Fly first class now but I used to fly in coach (21, 21, 21)
Got a million dollar limit on the credit card, I spend most (on God)
Seen a Lamb' and a 'Rarri, couldn't decide, so I bought both (on God, 21)
They be talkin' 'bout net worth but I bet my net your gross (21)
I want love and dollars (both)
Bugattis and models (both)
Money right, she'll holler (on God)
Max contract, I'm a baller (straight up)
She addicted to the lifestyle (21)
I could use my earrings for ice now (21)
Couldn't pick a friend 'cause they all fine (21)
Told 'em, "Give me both, cut the lights down" (21)

Don't you tell me that it's love or money, I want both
Ain't no way I let you take one from me, I want both
Dollar bills, all the feelings I can feel
Let 'em know, let 'em know, let 'em know
I want both

I want love and dollars
Both, both
Both of them
Let 'em know, I want both
I want love and dollars
Both, both, let 'em know, let 'em know (BIA-BIA, Tiësto)
I want both
