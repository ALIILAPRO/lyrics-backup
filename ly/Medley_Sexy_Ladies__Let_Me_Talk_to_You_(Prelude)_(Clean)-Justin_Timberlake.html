		<p>
		  Come on
I can tell you want a drink girl
You ain't gotta worry no more
You keep my bottles cold and you pop 'em
As soon as I walk in the door
These dudes don't know me from Adam and Eve
That's why they can't mess up my flow
And when this beat drops, your heart stops
You feel it from your head to your toes

If you know what I'm talking 'bout
Let me see you work it out
Girl that's what I'm talking 'bout

I got sexy ladies all over the floor
You're talking to one of the greatest
Who did it before
Now I'm back with one of my latest
Just letting you know
That I got sexy ladies so back up some more
Let me take it off

I know a little girly from uptown
Just waiting just to cater to me
I know a little betty from downtown
That'll do anything that I please
All my other people that dance around
When they hear me rocking the groove
Now it might sound cocky
But is it really cocky if you know that it's true

If you know what I'm talking 'bout (hey girl)
Let me see you work it out (hey girl)
Girl that's what I'm talking 'bout

I got sexy ladies all over the floor
You're talking to one of the greatest
Who did it before
Now I'm back with one of my latest
Just letting you know
That I got sexy ladies so back up some more
And let me take it off

Sexy, sexy, sexy
Walk that body, talk that body
Sexy, sexy, sexy
Walk that body, talk that body
Sexy, sexy, sexy
Walk that body, talk that body
Sexy, sexy, sexy
Walk that body, talk that body

Now break it down
Now move a little bit to the left
Now move back over here to the right
Now let me see you walk, walk, yeah
Let me see you walk
Here comes your part girl

Sexy, sexy, sexy
Walk that body, talk that body
(Slow down girl)
Sexy, sexy, sexy
Walk that body, talk that body
(Slow down girl)
Sexy, sexy, sexy
Walk that body, talk that body
(Slow down girl)
Sexy, sexy, sexy
Walk that body

I got sexy ladies all over the floor
You're talking to one of the greatest
Who did it before
Now I'm back with one of my latest
Just letting you know
That I got sexy ladies so back up some more
And let me take it off

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
(I'm tired of arguing girl)
Hey, hey, hey
(I'm tired of arguing girl)
Hey, hey, hey

My love, uh huh, my love, hey
My love, hey, my love, hey
My love, hey, my love, hey
My love, hey, my love, hey
My love, hey, my love, hey
My love, hey, my love, hey
My love, hey, my love, hey
My love, hey, my love
My love

I love the way you're standing
Lips look so sweet, like cotton candy (my love)

That don't mean you gotta stop dancing
'Cause the way that you move is so demanding (my love)

Let's put it on cruise control
Let me take you to the crib, let me ease your soul (my love)

I'm gonna take it really nice and slow
But first let me, let me, let me talk to her

My love, hey, my love, hey
My love, hey, my love, hey
My love, hey, my love, hey
My love, hey, my love, hey
My love, hey, my love, hey
My love, hey, my love, hey
My love, hey, my love, hey
My love, hey, my love
My love

Walk into my great place, cozy
I'm glad you came, let's make a toast (my love)

Let me make an indecent proposal
Let me take you to the back and do what we're suppose to (my love)

Let's take a trip to the bayou
You can be the investigator, I'm your private I (my love)

You know I want a piece of that pie
But first let me, let me, let me talk to her

My love, hey, my love, hey
My love, hey, my love, hey
My love, hey, my love, hey
My love, hey, my love, hey
My love, hey, my love, hey
My love, hey, my love, hey
My love, hey, my love, hey
