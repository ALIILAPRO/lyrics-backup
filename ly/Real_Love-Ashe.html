		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You may not look like me
You may feel differently
But I can tell it from your face
I know hope gets hard to find
No love can fall behind
And I don't need to know your name

'Cause at the end of the day, yeah
We all go through the same
Shit luck, bad sex, no cash
Fuck love, break-up, sad ex, yeah

Everybody, everybody
Everybody wanna have a good life
Too many get a hard life
Take it with a smile, get by
Nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody want a fake love
We want that real love
Give us that real love

You can't please the whole world
I've tried and I have failed
Only love you'll find is real

'Cause at the end of the day, yeah
We all go through the same
Shit luck, bad sex, no cash
Fuck love, break-up, sad ex, yeah

Everybody, everybody
Everybody wanna have a good life
Too many get a hard life
Take it with a smile, get by
Nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody want a fake love
We want that real love
Give us that real love

Ooh, ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh, ooh

Everybody, everybody
Everybody wanna have a good life
Too many get a hard life
Take it with a smile, get by

Everybody, everybody
Everybody wanna have a good life
Too many get a hard life
Take it with a smile, get by
Nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody want a fake love
We want that real love
Give us that real love

Ooh, ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh, ooh
