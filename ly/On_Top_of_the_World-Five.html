		<p>
		  Come on!
Got up outta bed today, I was feelin' on top, yeah
Looking forward to a brighter day with the good things I got
There was never any time for me to rest or to play, no
But I wanna get on up and change the world today
CHORUS
I feel on top (yeah) on top of the world
Don't wanna stop (yeah) on top of the world (baby)
Just wanna rock (Yeah) on top of the world
Cause the way that I'm feelin' is the way that I feel tonight
I don't think that I felt this good in such a long time (oh baby)
These good feelings runnin' through my veins, it must be a sign (oh no)
Gotta live everyday to the full, on me just rely
Have a good look around you, take a deep breath and sigh
CHORUS
And the way that I feel makes everything seem all right
Got up outta bed today, I was feelin' on top, yeah
Lookin' forward to a brighter day with the good things I got
There was never any time for me to rest or to play
Gonna get on up and change the world today
CHORUS x3
And the way that I feel makes everything seem all right
'Cause the way that I'm feelin' is the way that I feel tonight, yeah
