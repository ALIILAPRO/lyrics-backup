		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh-ooh
Ooh

We always like the dark and quiet places, mm
Maybe that's why I stayed near to you
And I know what it is to hold my breathe, ah
Yeah, I know what it is to hurt for you, ah

When did sorry start to lose it's meanin'?
Like the color on your faded jeans, yeah
When "I love you" starts to lose it's power
You only say it on the nineteenth hour
When we're sat in the silence
Oh, and the room goes quiet
I've got nothing left
When "I love you" starts to lose it's meanin'
You only say it just to cover up the bleedin'

Ooh-ooh (ah-ah-ah)
Ooh (ah-ah-ah), ooh (ah-ah-ah)
Ooh (ah-ah-ah)
Ooh-ooh (ah-ah-ah)
Ooh (ah-ah-ah), ooh (ah-ah-ah)
Ooh (ah-ah-ah)

Holdin' me doesn't care if you really mean it, ah
'Cause all I wanna do is have to something to believe in (ooh)
Ooh, and it's tragic but it's true
'Cause I've been optimistic for you
And what else am I to do? Yeah
You know I'll hold on to you
You know I'll hold on to you
Ooh, but

When did sorry start to lose it's meanin'?
Like the color on your faded jeans, yeah
When "I love you" starts to lose it's power
You only say it on the nineteenth hour
When we're sat in the silence
Oh, and the room goes quiet
I've got nothing left
When "I love you" starts to lose it's meanin'
You only say it just to cover up the bleedin'

Ooh-ooh (ah-ah-ah)
Ooh (ah-ah-ah), ooh (ah-ah-ah)
Ooh (ah-ah-ah)

You only say it just to cover up the bleedin' (ah-ah-ah)
Right now I wish that you would say it 'cause you mean it (ah-ah-ah)
You only say it just to cover up the bleedin' (ah-ah-ah)
You only say it, you only say it

When we're sat in the silence
Oh, and the room goes quiet
I've got nothing left
When "I love you" starts to lose it's meanin'
You only say it just to cover up the bleedin'
(Ah-ah-ah)
Aah (ah-ah-ah)

Ooh-ooh (ah-ah-ah)
Ooh (ah-ah-ah), ooh (ah-ah-ah)
Ooh (ah-ah-ah)
Ooh-ooh (ah-ah-ah)
Ooh (ah-ah-ah), ooh (ah-ah-ah)
Ooh (ah-ah-ah)
