		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't you feel it growing, day by day
People getting ready for the news
Some are happy, some are sad
Whoa, gotta let the music play

Mhm
What the people need is a way to make 'em smile
It ain't so hard to do if you know how
Gotta get a message, get it on through
Oh, now momma don't you ask me why

Whoa, oh listen to the music
Whoa, oh listen to the music
Whoa, oh listen to the music
All the time

Well I know, you know baby, everything I say
Meet me in the country for a day
We'll be happy, and we'll dance
Oh, we're gonna dance our blues away

And if I'm feeling good to you and you're feeling good to me
There ain't nothing we can't do or say
Feeling good, feeling fine
Oh, baby, let the music play

Whoa, oh listen to the music
Whoa, oh listen to the music
Whoa, oh listen to the music
All the time

Like a lazy flowing river
Surrounding castles in the sky
And the crowd is growing bigger
Listening for the happy sounds
And I got to let them fly

Whoa, oh listen to the music
Whoa, oh listen to the music
Whoa, oh listen to the music
All the time

Whoa, oh listen to the music
Whoa, oh listen to the music
Whoa, oh listen to the music
All the time

Whoa, oh listen to the music
Whoa, oh listen to the music
Whoa, oh listen to the music
All the time
