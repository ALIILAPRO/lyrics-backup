		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yo, yo
Yo, yo

Your honour, please, gotta believe what I say
What I will tell happened just the other day
I must confess, 'cause I've had about enough
I need your help, gotta make this here thing stop

Baby, I swear I'll tell the truth
About all the things we used to do
And if you thought you had me fooled
I'm telling you now, objection overruled (here we go, oh, baby)

One for the money and the free rides
It's two for the lies that you denied
All rise
All rise (all rise)
Three for the calls you've been making
It's four for the times you've been faking
All rise (I'm gonna tell it to your face)
All rise (I rest my case)

You're on the stand, with your back against the wall
Nowhere to run, and nobody you can call (oh no)
I just can't wait, now the case is open wide
You'll try to pray, but the jury will decide

Baby, I swear I'll tell the truth
About all the things we used to do
And if you thought you had me fooled
I'm telling you now, objection overruled (oh, baby)

One for the money and the free rides
It's two for the lies that you denied
All rise
All rise (all rise)
Three for the calls you've been making
It's four for the times you've been faking
All rise (I'm gonna tell it to your face)
All rise (I rest my case)

So step back, 'cause you don't know this cat
I know deep down that you don't want me to react
I lay low leaving all my options open
The decision of the jury has not been spoken
Step in my house, you find that your stuff has gone
But, in reality, to whom does the stuff belong?
I bring you into court to preach my order
And you know that you overstep the border (uh-huh)

One for the money and the free rides
It's two for the lies that you denied
All rise
All rise
Three for the calls you've been making
It's four for the times you've been faking
All rise
All rise

One for the money and the free rides
It's two for the lies that you denied
All rise (what you've done)
All rise
Three for the calls you've been making
It's four for the times you've been faking
All rise (what you've done)
All rise (where you've gone)

One for the money and the free rides
It's two for the lies that you denied
All rise (all rise)
All rise
Three for the calls you've been making
It's four for the times you've been faking
(I said) All rise (I'm gonna tell it to your face)
All rise (I rest my case)
