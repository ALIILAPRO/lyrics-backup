		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know you say that you would never hurt me
But it's not your fault
I still think the worst anyway, yeah
Let's be clear I know that I can trust you
When you're under me
But tell me honestly

If you are 
Alone with some hoe, who I don't know and she gets
Too close for comfort, says she good at secrets, would you
Say no or let your body take control

'Cause you're just a boy
You've got a switch in your head
I've seen how quick you forget yourself
I know it all too well
'Cause you're just a boy
You go from careful to wild
And what if I'm not by your side
When she fucks with your honesty
'Cause you're just a boy

You can tell me all this hist is in my mind
That I'm just spiteful, psycho
Walkin' tight ropes
Tryna catch you outta line but no, I'm not
When I'm alone and all I got is time
Too much time 
And you don't pick up
My head starts to make shit up

Like you all alone with some hoe, who I don't know and she gets
Into your phone, you give into your weakness so easily
Would you even think 'bout me

'Cause you're just a boy
You've got a switch in your head
I've seen how quick you forget yourself
I know it all too well
'Cause you're just a boy
You go from careful to wild
And what if I'm not by your side
When she fucks with your honesty
'Cause you're just a boy

You're just a boy, hey, hmm
You're just a boy
Ah ah ay, yeah
You're just a
