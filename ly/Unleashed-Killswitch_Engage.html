		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let's go
Deceive me
Release me
Unleash me
You've unleashed the wild within

Welcome to the madness 
That dwells inside these eyes
Pushed unto the breaking point
You're running out of time, time

This innocent blood is on your hands
Deceive me
Come face to face with the final stand
Release me
It's the part of me you can't comprehend
Unleash me
You've unleashed the wild within
The wild within, yeah

You who spoke defiance
You who spoke in jest (You who spoke in jest)
The last of all my tolerance has left this broken man

This innocent blood is on your hands
Deceive me
Come face to face with the final stand
Release me
It's the part of me you can't comprehend
Unleash me
You've unleashed the wild within

I remind you time and time again
You've broken the restraints against your heart
Against the dark

Can you feel the pain 
Of those you betrayed?
The promises unmade
Broken hearts that fill with shame
And you're to blame
Do they call your name?
There's nothing left to say
Nothing left to say

This innocent blood is on your hands
Deceive me
Come face to face with the final stand
Release me
It's the part of me you can't comprehend
Unleash me
You've unleashed the wild within
