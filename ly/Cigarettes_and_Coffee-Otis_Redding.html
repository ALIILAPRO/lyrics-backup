		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's early in the morning
About a quarter 'til three
I'm sittin' here talkin' with my baby
Over cigarettes and coffee, yeah
And to tell you that
Darling I've been so satisfied
Honey since I met you
Baby, since I met you, whoa

All the places that I've been around
And all the good looking girls I've met
They just don't seem to fit in
Knowing this particularly sad, yeah

But it seemed so natural, darling
That you and I are here
Just talking over cigarettes and drinking coffee, ooh now

And, oh, my heart cries out
Love at last, I've found you, ooh now
And honey won't you let me
Just build my whole life around you?
And whoa, how complete, how complete my whole life would be, yeah
If you would take things under consideration
And walk down this aisle with me
I would love it, yeah

Well, I say it's so early in the morning
Ooh, it's a quarter 'til three
We're sittin' here talkin'
Over cigarettes and drinking coffee, now, Lord
And I'll like to show you, well
I've known nothing but good old joy
Since I met you, darling
Honey since I've met you, baby yeah

I would love to have another drink of coffee, now
And please, darling, help me smoke this one more cigarette, now
I don't want no cream and sugar
'Cause I've got you, now darling
But just let me enjoy
Help me to enjoy
This good time that we'll have, baby
It's so early, so early in the morning
So early, so early in the morning
And I've got you
And you've got me
And we have each other
And we don't, and we don't want nothing but joy, y'all
Nothing but joy
