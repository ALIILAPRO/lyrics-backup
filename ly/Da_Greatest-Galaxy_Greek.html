		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I will be one of the greatest, that is a vow, yeah, that is a promise
Always wanted to be famous, just being real, yeah, just being honest
My hater's gon' always be nameless, give them no clout, I give them no power
Creators built different, they ancient, sooner than later, all will be ours

I will be one of the greatest, that is a vow, yeah, that is a promise
Always wanted to be famous, just being real, yeah, just being honest
My hater's gon' always be nameless, give them no clout, I give them no power
Creators built different, they ancient, sooner than later, all will be ours

I will be one of the greatest, that is a vow, yeah, that is a promise
Always wanted to be famous, just being real, yeah, just being honest
My hater's gon' always be nameless, give them no clout, I give them no power
Creators built different, they ancient, sooner than later, all will be ours

I will be one of the greatest, that is a vow, yeah, that is a promise
Always wanted to be famous, just being real, yeah, just being honest
My hater's gon' always be nameless, give them no clout, I give them no power
Creators built different, they ancient, sooner than later, all will be ours
