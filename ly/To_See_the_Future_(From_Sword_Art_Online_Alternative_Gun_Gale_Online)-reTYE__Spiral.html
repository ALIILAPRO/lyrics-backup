		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I could run away, from everydayThis cruel reality, smothering meUnsure where I should go, I don't knowCould I take a step to be free
Is it too much, to want to change?Escape this life I cannot faceCould I reach out and touch youOh what more can I do?
And standing before meThe person I wish I could beI know they're both sides that I can't let goThe power I've gained, is with me each day
I know each lonely night, lonely night, lonely nightWill end when you say "good night"The warm sun will always shine, always shineWhen morning breaks with brilliant lightThough I'm nervous and uncertainWith my worries, holding tight, I close my eyesTo see the future
Looking for a way out, filling with doubtLooking through panes of glass, I cannot passSuddenly the rain falling down, echoing soundWill it lead and keep me on track?
If I should count from one to three*Would I be lost, cast out to seaCould I reach out and touch youOh what more can I do?
And standing before meThe person, I wish I could beIf I believed, there'd be only oneMy power growing, my true self is showing
All the pain that I feel, that I feel, that I feelWill fade when you say "good night"As the moonlight oh so bright, oh so brightEnvelopes me in radiant whiteSadness once felt, and mixed with joy nowAll the feelings in my mind, I close my eyesTo see the future
I know that life ain't easy sometimesWe must be strong, keep the hope alive insideI bet that god chose to make it this way*A curse on everyone to face a challenge each day
I know each lonely night, lonely night, lonely nightWill end when I say "good night"The warm sun will always shine, always shineWhen morning breaks with brilliant lightThough I'm nervous, and uncertainWith my worries, holding tight, saying "good night"To see the future
