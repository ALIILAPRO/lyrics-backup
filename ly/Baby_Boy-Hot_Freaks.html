		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now your face is hard to recognize
Even though you're only 25
We lived 100 lives before
And there's a sadness in your eyes
You seem like any guy
That I can meet at any time

All I want is another chance to
Be adventurous all day with you
Come back home to me
Be my baby boy (my baby boy)
Years before, you were young and clever
Told me always we'd be together
Was it just a dream, my baby boy?

Then you used to always dress so nice
Used to wear those stupid ties
We all thought you were trying too hard
And the girls all thought you were cute
But you never let them get with you
You said "I believe in the majesty of true love!"

All I want is another chance to
Be adventurous all day with you
Come back home to me
Be my baby boy (my baby boy)
Years before, you were young and clever
Told me always we'd be together
Was it just a dream, my baby boy?

You're scared, but don't be
You're gonna be the perfect dad someday

Now I know we'll never meet again
At least not meet as friends
It'll be just "How you been?"
Shake hands or something
Does it have to be like that?
Then I'm not looking back
Go on, go on yeah
You're someone else's baby boy

Baby boy
Baby boy
Baby boy
Baby boy
Baby boy
Baby boy
Baby boy
Baby boy
Years before, you were young and clever
You said always we'd be together
Was it just a dream
Was it just a dream, my baby boy?
