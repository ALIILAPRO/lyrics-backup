		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Virgins sold in quantity
African-american heredity
I'm playin' my guitar and I'm feelin' fine
Why are all the niggers in the unemployment line?

White trash get down on your knees
Time for cake and sodomy
White trash get down on your knees
Time for cake and sodomy

Teenage girl, a teenage queen
Til she's on video a porno queen!
She likes to give head
She likes it mean
That's why she's my little queen

White trash get down on your knees
Time for cake and sodomy
White trash get down on your knees
Time for cake and sodomy

Yeah
White boy tryin' to get some behind:
"who says date rape isn't kind?"
Who's he gonna goad?
Who's he gonna please?
It don't matter
As long as she's on her knees

White trash get down on your knees
Time for cake and sodomy
White trash get down on your knees
Time for cake and sodomy
