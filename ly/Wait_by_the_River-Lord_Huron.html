		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I will wait by the river
In the light of the moon
At the edge of the city
I will wait for you

Though I can't wait forever
Someday I'll be dead and gone
And I won't be forgiven
For what I've done

I will wait by the river
I will wait by the river
I will wait by the river
I will wait by the river

I will cry out to heaven
As it rains down on me
I will beg for forgiveness
Get down on my knees

If I can't change the weather
Maybe I can change your mind
If we can't be together
What's the point of life

Baby, I didn't mean the things I said
I don't honestly wish you were dead
I'm a fool; I'm just a man
If I only could hold you again

And the stars fill the river
As it flows into the sky
And the mind leaves the body
And floats higher and higher

If we can't be together
I will leave this world behind
If I can't touch your body
Can I touch the sky?

I will wait by the river
I will wait by the river
I will wait by the river
I will wait by the river
