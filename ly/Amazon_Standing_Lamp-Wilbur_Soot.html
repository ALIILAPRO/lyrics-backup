		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hi, it's been a while
Oh, I could stop on by
I wonder if you'll hear this when I'm done
It's gonna be a lot more 'til I'm gone
Waste inside my mind
Bloodshot eyes and empty sheets
It's all downhill, 2013
Ostentatious, Austin, Texas
I get so drunk I can barely see
Hit me now before this gets too cute
Don't make me beg in this hotel room
You'd think it'd get a lot easier without you

But you were right
There's so much shit inside my mind
I must confess the second time
A lot of friends have left my life
Escaping my tractor beam of woe
One small kiss and off they go
Crying in deep vibrato

Midday missionary
Late night loathing
Midnight cowgirl
Morning smoking

Me and my girl could go all night (midday missionary)
My girl's the world, she fucks my life (late night loathing)
A top-heavy Amazon standing lamp's (midnight cowgirl)
The only light left in my life
A top-heavy Amazon Basics standing lamp's (midday missionary)
The only light left in my life

No, it's not you again, is it?
