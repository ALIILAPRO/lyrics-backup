		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Put me together
Thread a needle
So I'm like other people
Without all of the evil
And I'm trying to be normal
But trauma is immortal
And none of this is your fault, I-I

Oh my God, this is so unbearable
Make it stop, this is more than medical
All I want is to feel beautiful inside and out

You're the one that can save me from myself
Destruction, triple nine, I need your help
All I want is to feel beautiful

Put me together one more time
Love me forever, fix me right
I can be your Frankenstein, Frankenstein
Put me together, make me better
Love me forever, hold me tight
I can be your Frankenstein, Frankenstein

I don't wanna be a monster anymore
I don't wanna be a monster
I don't wanna be a monster anymore
I don't wanna be a monster
I don't wanna be a monster anymore
I don't wanna be a monster
I don't wanna be a monster anymore
I don't wanna be a monster

I was doing fine
'Til I hit rock bottom
Opened up my problems
Watch the poison blossom, I-I

Oh my God, this is so unbearable
Make it stop, this is more than medical
All I want is to feel beautiful inside and out

You're the one that can save me from myself
Destruction, triple nine, I need your help
All I want is to feel beautiful

Put me together one more time
Love me forever, fix me right
I can be your Frankenstein, Frankenstein
Put me together, make me better
Love me forever, hold me tight
I can be your Frankenstein, Frankenstein

I don't wanna be a monster anymore
I don't wanna be a monster
I don't wanna be a monster anymore
I don't wanna be a monster
I don't wanna be a monster anymore
I don't wanna be a monster
I don't wanna be a monster anymore
I don't wanna be a monster
