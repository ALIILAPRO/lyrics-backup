		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lately, I been feelin' crazy
Life sucks, bitch, fuck you, pay me
Huh, aye, aye, yeah

Work hard, hard work pays off (what?)
Pushin' so much weight, fuck a day job
(what?) now they wanna fuck with me, bitch
Fuck y'all
Fuck y'all, I don't even wanna touch y'all

Work hard, hard work pays off (what?)
Pushin' so much weight, fuck a day job
(what?) now they wanna fuck with me, bitch
Fuck y'all
Fuck y'all, I don't even wanna touch y'all

I do not complain
I just get up and go and get it
That's why they all fuck with
Me, bitch, and, oh, not to mention
You ain't underground
Cuz you niggas ain't independent
Reckless and synthetic
You niggas is so pathetic
Bitch, I tell it how it is
But how do I tell when they legit
These niggas ain't for real
These niggas soft
They celibate 'cause they ain't goin' in
Unlike my blade in seven ways
When I am on defense
The voices can't stay in my head
So I have to release
But even when I fuckin' do
These demons follow me i'm on the hunt
Cuz every night I can't find any peace
And every day it seems the pieces
Keep on wandering, away from me, huh

Lately, I been feelin' crazy
If you don't want it then just
Stay up out my range, please
They wanna tie me down but
Can't nobody tame me
Life sucks, bitch, fuck you, pay me

Work hard, hard work pays off (what?)
Pushin' so much weight, fuck a day job
(what?) now they wanna fuck with me, bitch
Fuck y'all
Fuck y'all, I don't even wanna touch y'all

Work hard, hard work pays off (what?)
Pushin' so much weight, fuck a day job
(what?) now they wanna fuck with me, bitch
Fuck y'all
Fuck y'all, I don't even wanna touch y'all
