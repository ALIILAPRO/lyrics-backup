		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Look at me
The hate in my eyes
Look at me, the hate in my eyes
Look at me, in my burning
Look at me, in my burning eyes

Fuck you all
Yeah

I want to see you
Dead
Kill all your kind
'Cause you making me sick
I never felt this strong hate before
You choking me
Get out of my life
I don’t need this
I can’t take this
I won’t take this anymore

I’m your last hope
The rope around your neck

I’m your last hope
The rope around your neck

I’m your last hope
The rope around your neck

I’m your last hope
The rope around your neck

Fuck you
It’s all your fault
Now I’m loosing it all
But everything happens for a reason
I will be strong
I fuck you up
Now it’s my turn
I won’t forgive
I won’t forgive you
No

I’m your last hope
The rope around your neck

I’m your last hope
The rope around your neck

Inside
I can feel the pain is growing
This life
I don’t need it, I don’t want it
My eyes
I can’t see, the hate is burning
Your vibes, I refuse it, I destroy it

I’m your last hope
The rope around your neck

I’m your last hope
The rope around your neck

I’m the rope around your neck
