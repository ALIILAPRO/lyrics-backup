		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I read your face
It's like a screen door
I can see right through ya
Your hearts a window
Why you gotta treat me like the bimbo?
The sticks are out
And you don't care anymore

You make it so easy
You're sweet like Reece's Pieces
But I promise, if you leave me
You'll be crawling on your knees
So if you go it's a joke

If you drive away
Hope you get a flat tire, get stranded
If it's goodbye today
Know you're leaving here empty handed
'Cause I got my own life
And you're just a punch line
If you go, you're a joke
I forgot to laugh

You don't like it when I check your iphone
I don't even get my own ringtone
When you're hanging out with all your best bros
You don't wanna tell me where you guys go

You say that I'm needy
Like a kid needs Reese's Pieces
But I promise if you leave me
You'll be running back to me
At my door, what a joke

If you drive away
Hope you get a flat tire, get stranded
If it's goodbye today
Know you're leaving here empty handed
'Cause I got my own life
And you're just a punch line
If you go, you're a joke
I forgot to laugh

So if you're saying 'peace, bye'
You're so over me
Trying to seem like I'll be there
And I gotta laugh
You're more like a jockey
Or a cute little bunny
Think that you're funny
I forgot to laugh
Laugh

Like a diamond in a mountain of coal
I'm the girl the guys can't find anymore

Hey yeah!

If you drive away
Hope you get a flat tire, get stranded
If it's goodbye today
Know you're leaving here empty handed
'Cause I got my own life
And you're just a punch line
If you go, you're a joke
I forgot to laugh

If you drive away
Hope you get a flat tire, get stranded
If it's goodbye today
Know you're leaving here empty handed
'Cause I got my own life
And you're just a punch line
If you go, you're a joke
I forgot to laugh

Na na na na

I forgot to laugh
