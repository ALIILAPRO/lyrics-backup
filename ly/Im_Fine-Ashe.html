		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Woke up too early
Almost put salt in my coffee
Oh, I thank God that you stopped me before that
Tripped over something
Spilt it all over your front seat
Didn't even say I'm sorry about that

On and on, it's just more of the same
And even when you ask if I'm okay

I try to say I'm fine (I'm fine)
You don't (you don't)
Believe (believe me)
When I say I'm alright (alright)
You know (you know)
I need you when I try to say I'm fine (I'm fine)
You know (you know)
It's just (because I)
Can't admit when I'm sad (I'm sad)
But thank God (you know)
I need you when I try to say I'm fine

I can hide from everyone else
And they won't bat an eye
No, they never can tell
When I'm falling apart on the inside
It gets so hard
Keeping it up
Keep your eyes down
Keep your chin up
We all need someone there for us sometimes

On and on, it's just more of the same
I get so lonely everyday
Until you ask if I'm okay

I try to say I'm fine (I'm fine)
You don't (you don't)
Believe (believe me)
When I say I'm alright (alright)
You know (you know)
I need you when I try to say I'm fine (I'm fine)
You know (you know)
It's just (because I)
Can't admit when I'm sad (I'm sad)
But thank God (you know)
I need you when I try to say I'm fine
