		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've seen the worst of humanity
I know my worth, no matter what you say to me
But now I’m all in doubt
What have you done to me?
I wanna sort it out, I need a way out
I can't breathe with your grip on me
You used to be for me the biggest escape
But now, you are just another name
That I can't see, I can’t hear, I can't speak
Put it all behind me, now I'm getting away
Creating nothing but distance
I'm tryin' to make myself a better man
So stay away
