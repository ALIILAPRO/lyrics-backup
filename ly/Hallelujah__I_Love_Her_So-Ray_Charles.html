		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let me tell you 'bout a girl I know
She is my baby and she lives next door
Every mornin' 'fore the sun comes up
She brings me coffee in my favorite cup
That's why I know, yes, I know
Hallelujah, I just love her so

When I'm in trouble and I have no friend
I know she'll go with me until the end
Everybody asks me how I know
I smile at them and say, "She told me so"
That's why I know, oh, I know
Hallelujah, I just love her so

Now, if I call her on the telephone
And tell her that I'm all alone
By the time I count from one to four
I hear her - on my door

In the evening when the sun goes down
When there is nobody else around
She kisses me and she holds me tight
And tells me, "Daddy, everything's all right"
That's why I know, yes, I know
Hallelujah, I just love her so

Now, if I call her on the telephone
And tell her that I'm all alone
By the time I count from one to four
I hear her - on my door

In the evening when the sun goes down
When there is nobody else around
She kisses me and she holds me tight
And tells me, "Daddy, everything's all right"
That's why I know, yes, I know
Hallelujah, I just love her so
Oh, hallelujah
Don't you know, I just love her so?
She's my little woman, waitin' all this time
Babe, I'm a little fool for you, little girl
