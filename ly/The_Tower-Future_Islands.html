		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Threw a bottle across the water
To someone who's thinking of me
There's a tower in the ocean
Pouring through me
That's my will and testament

I, I, I am waiting on the other side, sigh
Looked out into everything and I lie, lie
Tell myself it's nothing, when it's quite right
Everything grows stronger in the light

When a boy who played with razors
Met a girl who opened cages
All the birds flew through the graveyard
And their laughter was contagious

I, I, I am watching on the other side, sigh
Looked out into every nil and nigh
Lie, tell myself it's darkest when it's quite bright
Everything grows stronger in her light
In the light, in the light, in the light

Standing at the sea and swallowing
Without you, beside you
But you knew what I knew

I, I, I am waiting on the other side, sigh
Looked out into everything and I lie
Tell myself it's nothing, when it's quite right
Everything grows, everything grows

I, I, I am watching, I am waiting
I, I, I am waiting, I'm not breaking
I lie, tell myself it's okay, when it's not quite
Everything grows stronger in the light
