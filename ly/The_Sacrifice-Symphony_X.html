		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Your eyes singing to me sweet lullabies 
While you lay there in submission 
Forbidden desire 
Alone in the moonlight hearts afire 
Burn away our inhibitions 

When the stars lose their fire 
And night steals the morning away 
Forever and the day 
I will stay, I will stay here with you my love 

Sacrifice a heart beat away from paradise 
All my reasons given way to temptation 
Fear and shame 
Looking for someone else to blame 
We're devoured by these foolish accusations 

With every fleeting breath I take 
Maybe a love was a mistake 
Eternal life I traded for one moment beside you 

When the stars lose their fire 
And night steals the morning away 
Forever and the day 

I will stay, I will stay here with you my love 

When the stars lose their fire 
And night steals the morning away 
Forever and the day 

When the stars lose their fire 
And night takes the morning away 
Forever and the day 
I will stay, I will stay here with you my love
