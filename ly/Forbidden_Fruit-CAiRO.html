		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Think I like when you playing games
Think I like when you far away
Too much on my mind to let you fuck my day up
Don't got too much time to be your savior
Fresh scars and open wounds
Two pills and I'm good as new
If I go like this Imma wind up dead
If I blow like this Imma wind up dead
I can't be asked to care
Cause you're never there when I need you the most
So don't expect me to care now
Cause you never there when I need you so
Think I like when you playing games
Think I like when you far away
Too much on my mind to let you fuck my day up
Don't got too much time to be your savior
Fresh scars and open wounds
Two pills and I'm good as new
If I go like this Imma wind up dead
If I blow like this Imma wind up dead
You're never there
You're never there
