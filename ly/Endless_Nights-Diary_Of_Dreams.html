		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In silence you scream
At the voice in my head relive every dream
That you meant to forget

So tempted at night to open my eyes
How divine is the dark
Such a pleasant surprise

Don't fear endless nights
In every word in every man
The beast is yours and mine to tame so
Don't fear endless nights
In every word in every man
The beast is yours and mine to tame

The lack of my faith to the tone that I hear
The serpent may bring the justice we fear

Awake when I dream i tremble and fall
Afraid when I sleep and no hope to call

Don't fear endless nights
In every word in every man
The beast is yours and mine to tame so
Don't fear endless nights
In every word in every man
The beast is yours and mine to tame

Awake when I dream i tremble and fall
Afraid when I sleep and no hope to call

Don't fear endless nights
In every word in every man
The beast is yours and mine to tame so
Don't fear endless nights
In every word in every man
The beast is yours and mine to tame
