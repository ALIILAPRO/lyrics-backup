		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Thought you’d have more to say
No response says everything
Heartbreak I can’t concentrate 
If I tell my friends they’ll hate you babe

What chu doin’ now
What cha doin’ now hold tight
Yeah we through now
Yeah we though now oh my
Yeah its too loud 
Yeah its too loud hold tight
What chu doin’ now 
What cha doin’ now oh my 


(Call me, oh won’t you call me, oh won’t you call me, oh won’t you call me)
What cha doin’ now oh my
(Call me, oh won’t you call me, oh won’t you call me, oh won’t you call me)
What cha doin’ now hold tight 

I know that you have my number
I’m the only person with it
And its only 7 digits
Should I charge it to the game?
Should I plug it in the wall?
Do you even care at all?

What chu doin’ now
What cha doin’ now hold tight 
Yeah we through now
Yeah we though now oh my
Yeah its too loud 
Yeah its too loud hold tight
What chu doin’ now 
What cha doin’ now oh my 

You know I hate to turn down your lovin’ 
Cause your somethin’
Baby
You know I hate to turn down your lovin’ 
Cause your somethin’
Baby

(Call me, oh won’t you call me, oh won’t you call me, oh won’t you call me)
What cha doin now hold tight 
Yeah its too loud hold tight 
What cha doin now hold tight
