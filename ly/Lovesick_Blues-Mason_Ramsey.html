		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lord I don't know what I'll do
All I do is sit and sigh, oh Lord
The last long

I I, Oh Lord the last long
I I, Oh Lord the last long
I I, Oh Lord the last long
And I thought I would cry

I I, Oh Lord the last long
I I, Oh Lord the last long
I I, Oh Lord the last long
And I thought I would cry

She'll do me, she'll do you
She's got that kind of loving
Lord I love to hear her when she, daddy

She'll do me, she'll do you
She's got that kind of loving
Lord I love to hear her when she

Dad, dad
Lord the last long

I I, Oh Lord the last long
I I, Oh Lord the last long
I I, Oh Lord the last long
And I thought I would cry

I I, Oh Lord the last long
I I, Oh Lord the last long
I I, Oh Lord the last long
And I thought I would cry
