		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Drove away so ugly, I was way past being angry
Didn't help that I'd not driven in a while
Crazy ways of making people think they oughta matter
Doesn't anybody want to know the time?

And all I know
Is something out, is something old
Just ain't cool enough to be this cold
And all I know
It's everywhere, you come, you go
I don't want to be here
I don't want to be here anymore

Kept me from admitting all the venom I was spitting
Couldn't tell if it was smoke or just the rain
Something else was missing, all the critics wouldn't listen
I don't need another problem, just the pain

And all I know
Is something out, is something old
Just ain't cool enough to be this cold
And all I know
It's everywhere, you come, you go
I don't want to be here
I don't want to be here anymore

Oh, all I know
Is something out, is something old
Just ain't cool enough to be this cold
All I know
It's everywhere, you come you go
But I don't want to be here
I don't want to be here
Someone get me out of here
I don't want to be here anymore
