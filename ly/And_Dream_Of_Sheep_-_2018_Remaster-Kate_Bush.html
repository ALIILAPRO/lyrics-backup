		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Little light shining
Little light will guide them to me 
My face is all lit up
My face is all lit up
If they find me racing white horses 
They'll not take me for a buoy

Let me be weak, let me sleep and dream of sheep
Oh I'll wake up to any sound of engines
Every gull a seeking craft
I can't keep my eyes open 
Wish I had my radio 
I'd tune into some friendly voices

Talking 'bout stupid things
I can't be left to my imagination
Let me be weak, let me sleep and dream of sheep 
Ooh, their breath is warm
And they smell like sleep
And they say they take me home 
Like poppies, heavy with seed 
They take me deeper and deeper
