		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hate me
You know I'm nothing like you
You're so complacent
Deadweight my patience worn through
You'll never stopped to think how it felt to be caught between
The guilt and the grief the lies you believed
False hope a tightrope I'm never gonna be
Your twisted fantasy

I swear to god as a witness
I can't waste another day on forgiveness
Another phase of dark days
I can't keep holding on so desperately

Feels like I'm falling nightmares keep repeating
Bitter taste of blood on my tongue
Cause I can't face what I've done
Feel like a cop out washed out
Broken down left bleeding out
Into the endless grey
Abandoned to decay

I just can't forget
The hell you put me in and just leave me here
With all my fears I've got you sinking in
why can't you disappear?
I guess I bled you in and it's more than I can take
Why can't you dissipate?
Just fucking dissipate

The vultures clawing
Carving up my chest
Ravenous
Sharpened talons rip the skin from the bone
And as I
Blackout
My screams suppressed
Let the scavengers fight for what's left

Feels like I'm falling nightmares keep repeating
Bitter taste of blood on my tongue
Cause I can't face what I've done
Feel like a cop out washed out
Broken down left bleeding out
Into the endless grey
Abandoned to decay

You left me in the dark
Yet I can see what you can't
Beauty is only skin
Deep

Feels like I'm falling nightmares keep repeating
Bitter taste of blood on my tongue
Cause I can't face what I've done
Feel like a cop out washed out
Broken down left bleeding out
Into the endless grey
Abandoned to decay
