		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Walking in the world, running so wrong
No one cares about your thoughts
All I want
Is your tears to dry, uh

I promise you, you'll be just fine
I'll take you out, this dark, cold night
All I want
To take a breath and look into your eyes

If you're down and don't feel like fighting
If you're stumblin' don't feel alone
Just hold my hand so tightly
And I will be there
'Cause you'll never be on your own

I know how hard can be this faith
I will throw up all my mistakes to move on
I don't wanna put on the brakes

Mmh, walking in this world, fighting so long
How hard can it be to pray for this love?
All I want
Is your tears to dry

If you're down and don't feel like fighting
If you're stumblin' don't feel alone
Just hold my hand so tightly
And I will be there
'Cause you'll never be on your own, yeah, yeah, uh yeah
