		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Play me a sad song, yeah
I wanna move, I wanna drink it by the bottle
It's complicated, yeah
But mixing feelings with tequila gets me wasted

I get that message when you ignore
Blue tick on my text and miss my calls
You take shots at me so I take note
When I hit the floor

I'm dancing without you, about you, about you
Dancing without you, about you, about you
Tell strangers about you, about you, about you
You're not here to take me home
So I'll party on my own
I'm dancing without you, about you, about you
Dancing without you, about you, about you
We'll leave any time soon, time soon, time soon
You're not here to take me home
So I'll party on my own

Keep up the tempo, yeah
Don't miss the beat, don't miss the words, don't miss your tango
There's no debating, yeah
Remixing love songs, 'til my drink's gon' sends me crazy

I get that message when you ignore
Blue tick on my text and miss my calls
You take shots at me so I take note
When I hit the floor

I'm dancing without you, about you, about you
Dancing without you, about you, about you
Tell strangers about you, about you, about you
You're not here to take me home
So I'll party on my own
I'm dancing without you, about you, about you
Dancing without you, about you, about you
We'll leave any time soon, time soon, time soon
You're not here to take me home
So I'll party on my own
So I'll party on my own

I'm dancing without you, about you, about you
You're not here to take me home
So I'll party on my own
So I'll party on my own
