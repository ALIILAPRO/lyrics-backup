		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You say nostalgia is negation
It can’t go on like that, it will all end
Contentment to be in nature
And kindness is still so hard to find
Sadness is rebellion
And self hate only respect

There is waves, waves of resistance
Somewhere out there
But there’s not enough of them
Those graves are such a temptation
If we don’t press rewind, it will all end
You say popular music is contamination
It won’t stop if the public is too blind
Sensitivity almost a sensation
In a world of cruel and simple minds
May teardrops be our revolution
In confusion, we will connect

There is waves, waves of resistance
I can feel them but I never hear of them
There is waves, waves of resistance
The critical minds there is
Not enough of them
