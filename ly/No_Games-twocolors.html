		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Was hooked on you when I left, it felt so strange
Spend all my time with you, it never changed

Tonight I feel like I'm yours, and you're mine
You play those stupid little games, and now we back at it one more time

No games, no games
No games, no games

You cannot give me what I want, still I'm coming back
Ashamed of what I have become, when I leave your bed

Tonight I feel like I'm yours, and you're mine
You play those stupid little games, and now we back at it one more time

No games, no games (Oh-oh)
No games, no games (Oh-oh)
No games, no games

Only together at night, wish to be free but I'm tied
Only together at night, can't cut me loose but I've tried
Only together at night, wish to be free but I'm tied
Only together at night, and now we back at it one last time

(Oh-oh)
No games, no games
(Oh-oh)
No games, no games
(Oh-oh)
No games, no games
(Oh-oh)
No games, no games
