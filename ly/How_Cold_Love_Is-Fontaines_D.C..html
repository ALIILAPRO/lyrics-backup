		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah

How cold love is
How cold love is
How cold love is
How cold love is

They sit in their room
They all consume
They fall in their bed
They wanna go dead
They sit in their room
They all consume
They fall in their bed
They wanna go dead

How cold love is
How cold love is

My, my
I've been so entwined
And the feeling's coming for the millionth time
And the answer is so sweet
And the days, they just seem to follow me
My, my
I've been so entwined
And the feeling's coming with the finish line
And the anti is so cold
So cold

So cold
So cold
So cold
So cold
It's so cold
It's so cold

They sit in their room
They all consume
They fall in their bed
They wanna go dead
They sit in their room
They all consume
They fall in their bed
They shouldn't have said

How cold love is
How cold love is
How cold love is
How cold love is
How cold love is
How cold love is
How cold love is
How cold love is
