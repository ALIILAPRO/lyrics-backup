		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  "Here is a quick look at the
Use of guns in the
Last twenty-four hours three police officers
Shot and wounded in the
Space of an hour last night a man was shot in
Broad daylight and subsequently seen walking
Away from the scene""

Point me a tone
Point, point, point me a tone right
Point me a tone right dead at ya' dome, fool
Point me a tone right point me a tone right
Point me a tone right dead at ya' dome, fool
Point me a tone point me a tone

Murder, murder on my mind
$uicidal all the time
They just stay blinded by the sight of
Blood that's drippin' down my eyes
Point, point, point, me a tone
Shoot me a bitch 'til the clip go "click"
Heard that you're tippin' police and shit
Rat motherfuckers, I ain't got love for 'em
Internet thugs talkin' all over the forum
Bitch, I hate everybody
I ain't here to make friends
Shade throwin' on Twitter like
We'll never meet again
See you in the flesh, and your tone change up
Yung Christ, I can never-ever be touched
$carecrow stick talk, triggers, I clutch
Hoes all around me want their
Clit to be touched
Ain't learned yet that I'd rather do drugs
Hoe

Point, point, point me a tone right
Point me a tone right dead at ya' dome, fool
Point me a tone right point me a tone right
Point me a tone right dead at ya' dome, fool
Point, point, point me a tone right

Yung Plague got a one-way ticket
Some say he the young flame
With the gunplay on a Sunday
Make a fuckin' pussy boy stand
In the blood rain
Ruby levitate, another gun bang
Chump change boy, now you gotta hate boy
Pull up the with the motherfuckin' AK, boy
Pull up like it's motherfucking game day, boy
Shoot 'em with the pistol, shoot
'em point blank, boy, yuh
Uzi fucking fire like a gun range, boy
Cum stains on your dumb dame, boy, ayy
Yung Plague was a dead boy, ayy
No shame in the blunt, aye
Don't be scared, boy, ayy
Just let me choke in the flames

Point me a tone right dead at ya' dome, fool
Point me a tone right dead at ya' dome, fool
Point me a tone right dead at ya' dome, fool
Point me a tone right
Point, point, point me a tone right

Welcome to the motherfuckin' genocide
Bloody murder run through my fucking mind
Grey clouds surround when we take a life
Last thing you taste is my fucking knife
Pointing me a tone aiming straight at ya dome
Shine through the dark
Now there’s nothing but the chrome
Cut ya' body up, and I throw it in a hole
AK strapped never trying to
Fuck with the boys g-G59
Don’t try to cross the line
Fucking with the killers I'ma have
To make your soul mine
Fucking with the murderers
I’ll have you breathing no more
Ruby stay strapped with an all black 44
Scrim with the K he don’t give
A fuck ‘bout a hoe

Point me a tone right dead at ya' dome, fool
Point me a tone right dead at ya' dome, fool
Point me a tone right dead at ya' dome, fool
Point, point, point me a tone right
