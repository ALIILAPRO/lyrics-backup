		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm an animal, I'm a victim
I'm the answer to your prayers
I'm a witness on a witch hunt
I'm the monster up the stairs

I'm the ghost that's in the mirror
I'm everything that you fear
I'm the ripped heart, I'm the soul shot
I'm the voice that's in your ear

I've seen it all, still can't taste it
Smashed to the wall, it brought me to my knees
I've done it all, fucked up, wasted
Still in my blood, but now inside I'm sane

I'm the hunted, I'm a predator
I'm the answer to the riddle
I'm the upbeat, I'm the headfuck
I'm the way I've left in the middle

I'm the player undenying
I'm the one who's not addicted
I'm the logic to the fuck up
I'm the broken one who fixed it

I've seen it all, still can't taste it
Smashed to the wall, it brought me to my knees
I've done it all, fucked up, wasted
Still in my blood, but now inside I'm sane

I've seen it all, still can't taste it
Smashed to the wall, it brought me to my knees
I've done it all, fucked up, wasted
Still in my blood, but now inside I'm sane

I'm just a child 
With tears in its eyes
I am holding this gift that is broken
What do I have left now?

I've seen it all, still can't taste it
Smashed to the wall, it brought me to my knees
I've done it all, fucked up, wasted
Still in my blood, but now inside I'm sane

I've seen it all, still can't taste it
Smashed to the wall, it brought me to my knees
I've done it all, fucked up, wasted
Still in my blood, but now inside I'm sane

Now inside I'm sane
