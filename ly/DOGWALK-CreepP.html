		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Heard from your bitches
Heard from your bitches
Heard from your bitches that you'd love to see my ass in stitches
You need assistance?
You need assistance?
You need assistance when your booboos need some love and kisses?
You were my ride or die
But what I heard, I died inside
Put you down, I'm terrified
I couldn't help myself, I was petrified
But what I thought were lies were right
Lord of the Flies, put your head on a pike
Bared my teeth while I let out a cry
Then I heard bullshit, acting like I died
I'll bring you to the pound
Shut up bitch, give me my rounds
Curb stomp you into the ground
You're all alone, where's your backup now?
My bark's worse then my bite
Now you got me real tight
Bitch, now we gonna fight
When I see you, it's on sight
Clip me by the ears
I whimper to the point of tears
Yelp louder than a whore in heat
I'll make your ass sore
Grab me by the collar
Leash laws bitch
I'll fuckin' maul ya
I'm an old dog bitch
I'll show you tricks you never seen before
Don't act brand new
I fucking warned you
Go ahead, try that again
And I'll fucking dogwalk you
I'll fucking dogwalk you
I'll fucking dogwalk you
Go ahead, try that again
And I'll fucking dogwalk you
You owe me money
You lived in my head rent free
You acting scummy
So I'll add it to your bitch fee
Don't be shy, put some more
You proved you're rotten to the core
I'm the bitch you can't ignore
You bark, I bite, you keeping score?
Mother Mary, can you hear me?
Because this bitch can, just barely
Gotta cancel them like Sherry
Jesus Christ, it's almost scary
That they have the audacity
Excuse me, the caucasity
That they'd continue to mention me
When I know where they are, and in which city
Block them, move on girl
Another round, next time girl
Wait, what, did I hear you right?
Are you sure they said that shit tonight?
My bark's worse then my bite
Now you got me real tight
Bitch, now we gonna fight
When I see you, it's on sight
Clip me by the ears
I whimper to the point of tears
Yelp louder than a whore in heat
I'll make your ass sore
Grab me by the collar
Leash laws bitch
I'll fuckin' maul ya
I'm an old dog bitch
I'll show you tricks you never seen before
Don't act brand new
I fucking warned you
Go ahead, try that again
And I'll fucking dogwalk you
I'll fucking dogwalk you
I'll fucking dogwalk you
Go ahead, try that again
And I'll fucking dogwalk you
Clip me by the ears
I whimper to the point of tears
Yelp louder than a whore in heat
I'll make your ass sore
Grab me by the collar
Leash laws bitch
I'll fuckin' maul ya
I'm an old dog bitch
I'll show you tricks you never seen before
Don't act brand new
I fucking warned you
Go ahead, try that again
And I'll fucking dogwalk you
I'll fucking dogwalk you
I'll fucking dogwalk you
Go ahead, try that again
And I'll fucking dogwalk you
