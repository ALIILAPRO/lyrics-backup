		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I saw three ships come sailing in
On Christmas day, on Christmas day
I saw three ships come sailing in
On Christmas day in the morning

And what was in those ships all three?
On Christmas day, on Christmas day
And what was in those ships all three?
On Christmas day in the morning

Our Saviour, Christ, and His Lady
On Christmas day, on Christmas day
Our Saviour, Christ, and His Lady
On Christmas day in the morning.

Pray, whither sailed those ships all three?
On Christmas day, on Christmas day
Pray, whither sailed those ships all three?
On Christmas day in the morning.

O, they sailed to Bethlehem
On Christmas day, on Christmas day
O, they sailed to Bethlehem
On Christmas day in the morning

And all the bells on earth shall ring
On Christmas day, on Christmas day
And all the bells on earth shall ring
On Christmas day in the morning

And all the angels in heaven shall sing
On Christmas day, on Christmas day
And all the angels in heaven shall sing
On Christmas day in the morning

And all the souls on earth shall sing
On Christmas day, on Christmas day
And all the souls on earth shall sing
On Christmas day in the morning

Then let us all rejoice and sing
On Christmas day, on Christmas day
Then let us all rejoice and sing
On Christmas day in the morning
