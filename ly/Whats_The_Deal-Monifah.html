		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yo, huh
Monifah and Jack Knight on the track (uh-huh)
Why ya'll do that for?

Shorty what you doing
Rolling with a real thug nigga like me
Baby, I'm from Brooklyn, but I hang out in VA a lot
Cuz down there, I here the business is hot
Mad chicks rolling small town kids with big city game
Sign up bad boy stuff we ain't never been the same
And if you want a dream would impress your luck
Cause I got more hits to bust, what the fuck?

What's the deal baby
You haven't paid these bills
And I ain't seen you lately
With all the lessons learned
You won't come home
And I think I can do better on my own

So what's the deal cutie
Things been on my mind
And I ain't seen you lately
With all the lessons learned
You won't come home
And I think I can do better on my own

I'm confused 
I think that we both need to talk
Cause I feel used
Like those can-do's when it's no-more-doll
And all this time
Pretending like your love is really here
But in my mind
Your body and your soul is really there

And I can feel it in the way you're holding me
Your love's been gone for days
Is there a reason why you're hurting me
It shouldn't be that way

What's the deal baby
You haven't paid these bills
And I ain't seen you lately
With all the lessons learned
You won't come home
And I think I can do better on my own

I'm so in love and so damn blind
My heart can't see
But is it true that you've been sleeping around on me
And all the joy I've brought you 
When you gave me the pain
And I don't know if the kids even know your name

And I can feel it in the way you're holding me
Your love's been gone for days
Is there a reason why you're hurting me
It shouldn't be that way

What's the deal baby
You haven't paid these bills
And I ain't seen you lately
With all the lessons learned
You won't come home
And I think I can do better on my own

And when I need you
You wonder what to do babe
And you hurt would come over and over again
It's too bad that you can't see
I'm all you need, yeah

Oh, all you need
All you need, yes
Oh baby
You won't come home
You won't come home
What do you do
Uh, uh, uh

What's the deal baby
You haven't paid these bills
And I ain't seen you lately
With all the lessons learned
You won't come home
And I think I can do better on my own
