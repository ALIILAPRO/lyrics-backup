		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You were on my mind all the time
Fell into a distraction with you, maybe once or twice
Planning out a future for two
What I'd do in a room all alone, only me and you

You always lie when it's convenient
Guess you didn't mean it but I'd still repeat it
If I could hold on to the feeling
Back when all your words still had their meaning

There's no need for apologies
'Cause honestly, fuck your honesty, I'm done
Think you like the insanity
I'm the casualty of your dreams
'Cause I'm not the one

Turned this gold into rust
Now it's dust to dust, love into lust
Ahh
There's no need for apologies
'Cause honestly you're dead to me

Dug yourself a grave, no surprise
Should've known better, so now it's time that you die in it
You got what you wanted from me
Make your bed
Should've left when you knew you would lie in it

You know I'm good at keeping secrets
You know that you're my weakness and I'll always repeat it
If I could hold on to the feeling
Back when all your words still had their meaning

There's no need for apologies
'Cause honestly, fuck your honesty, I'm done
Think you like the insanity
I'm the casualty of your dreams
'Cause I'm not the one

Turned this gold into rust
Now it's dust to dust, love into lust
Ahh
There's no need for apologies
'Cause honestly you're dead to me

You're dead to me
Dead to me, dead to me
Honestly you're dead to me

Grieve, I forever hold my bleeding
I fell quickly for words, misleading
Don't come crawling back with your healing
'Cause I'm not strong enough to fight the feeling

There's no need for apologies
'Cause honestly, fuck your honesty, I'm done
Think you like the insanity
I'm the casualty of your dreams
'Cause I'm not the one

Turned this gold into rust
Now it's dust to dust, love into lust
Ahh
There's no need for apologies
'Cause honestly you're dead to me
