		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Look at the sky
It's the color of love
Look at the sky
It's the color of love

You gave me the kiss of life
Kiss of life
You gave me that kiss that's like
Kiss of life
You gave me the kiss of life
Kiss of life
You gave me that kiss that's like
Kiss of life

You wrapped me up in
The color of love
There must have been an angel
Heavenly came down from above
He led me to you!
He led me to you!

You gave me the kiss of life
Kiss of life
You gave me that kiss that's like
Kiss of life

You gave me the kiss of life
Kiss of life
You gave me that kiss that's like
Kiss of life

You wrapped me up in
The color of love
There must have been an angel
Heavenly came down from above
He led me to you!
He led me to you!
