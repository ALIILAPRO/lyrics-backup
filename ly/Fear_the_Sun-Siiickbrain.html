		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  bones scattered piece by piece 
how far do you think i fell?
almost 100 million miles 
from myself 
find the pieces 
pick up all the pieces 
find the pieces 
pick up all the pieces 
find the pieces 
pick up all the pieces 
and lose them day by day 

fear the sun 
the light can disorient
in the dark
we can’t be poisoned 

it’s gravity 
that makes us weak 

world gets spun 
hold on and enjoy it 
pain so sharp
it’s hard to avoid it

it’s gravity 
that makes us weak 

lights go out so no one’s watching 
dripping down the sky is falling 
birds are screaming, 
ears are throbbing 
apocalyptic 
I’m the target 

life it builds what we become 
crack until we come undone 
sun shines down while we succumb
kids get shot by guys with guns

feed us pills to keep us dumb 
wanna say more but I’ll bite my tongue 
bite my tongue 

fear the sun 
the light can disorient
in the dark
we can’t be poisoned 

it’s gravity 
that makes us weak 

world gets spun 
hold on and enjoy it 
pain so sharp
it’s hard to avoid it

it’s gravity 
that makes us weak 

blackout to go blind again 
burn glass to numb my heart 
fill the void until the end 
build walls to tear apart 

in the dark 
we can’t be poisoned 

it’s gravity 
that makes us weak 

fear the sun 
the light can disorient
in the dark
we can’t be poisoned 

it’s gravity 
that makes us weak
