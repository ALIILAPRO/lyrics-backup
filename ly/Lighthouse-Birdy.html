		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Caught up in the riptide
Like a storm on a dark night
In so deep
And it's pulling me from both sides
It's hard to stay upright
In this changing sea

And I'm so full of rage
You used to keep that fire at bay
Now I don't know who I've become
And another day breathes
Tearing at the seams
And I hope I don't come undone

And when these stars rise and fall
And I can't find my way home

Will you be my lighthouse?
When I call out your name
Show me the way
Will you be my lighthouse?
Will you shine out?
Show me the way

So fire up a red light
Into the black sky
Do you see me now?
Do the echoes of my heart
Reach you where you are?
Do you hear the sound?

I still long to feel your touch
You're the iron in my blood
You know my love would never change
And I lie up in my bed
Fighting shadows in my head
And pray you'll get to me someway

And when these stars rise and fall
And I can't find my way home

Will you be my lighthouse?
When I call out your name
Show me the way
Will you be my lighthouse?
Will you shine out?
Show me the way

Oh, lead me home
Back to safer shores
Oh, lead me home
Back to where I belong
Oh, lead me home
Back into your arms
Oh, lead me home
Home

And when these stars rise and fall
And I can't find my way home
When the sunrise won't come

Will you be my lighthouse?
When I call out your name
Show me the way
Will you be my lighthouse?
Will you shine out?
Show me me way
