		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It about started when I saw that AMPM truck
Swerving to a nightmare and I almost got us fucked
Shouldn't of been dozing but I pushed myself too hard
I thought I knew better yeah, but I took it too far

It about started when I saw that AMPM truck
Swerving to a nightmare and I almost got us fucked
Shouldn't of been dozing but I pushed myself too hard
I thought I knew better yeah, but I took it too far

Fate gave me a chance, now a couple chances
Hands always on the wheel, I thought I really had this
This is a struggle, a struggle of survival
Life is not a toy, and I should know this spiral
Don't fall asleep, I am not invincible
Could've been worse, there could've been a death toll
I can't fall asleep at the wheel
I can't fall asleep at the wheel
I can't fall asleep at the wheel
I can't fall asleep at the wheel

It about started when I saw that AMPM truck
Swerving to a nightmare and I almost got us fucked
Shouldn't of been dozing but I pushed myself too hard
I thought I knew better yeah, but I took it too far

ATL to Florida
That's the last time
That's the last time

It about started when I saw that AMPM truck
Swerving to a nightmare and I almost got us fucked
Shouldn't of been dozing but I pushed myself too hard
I thought I knew better yeah

It about started when I saw that AMPM truck
Swerving to a nightmare and I almost got us fucked
Shouldn't of been dozing but I pushed myself too hard
I thought I knew better yeah but I took it too far

It about started when I saw that AMPM truck
Swerving to a nightmare and I almost got us fucked
Shouldn't of been dozing but I pushed myself too hard
I thought I knew better yeah
