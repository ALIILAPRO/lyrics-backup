		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You made me
Everything that I am
You called me names 'till I became a name
Now that's all that I understand
Now the joke's on you
'cause the whole damn world's at the palm of the fool's hand
Now the fool's got to choose
And the joker's in the smoker with his palm on the hot pan
'Cause I'm that boy with the ball and chain
Floating through the sky, looking down from my jet plane
Looking down from my jet plane, oh
Yeah, I'm that boy with the ball and chain
The boy with the ball and chain
Now I'm looking down from my jet plane
