		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Feel me now

My forefinger flippin' pentagrams
Left hand catch them pix by them peak facin 'south
Pinhole pic of my wingspan jail breakin' doubt
Highest vibration ninth ring of fire crowned
War cry feel my call hear my chamber revolve
In your brain like the halls of Amenti
Treat a bitch like a whore
Leave your pink sock at the door
Saturn level flexed
Like these fractals, I coalesce
I'm not takin' this shit anymore
One way in, come again, one way in, no way out
Cheek in tongue when in doubt feel me now
Violators feed 'em vapors don't do me no favors

Feel me now

Drop-top changea flow go boom-boom off my rockers
Rollin' doom bumbata choppers
See me through spot light cherry
Fog like Nunhead no-teeth Mary
Don't carry on
Don't where are we how far along
Me care not dare not key my brom
My life on a limb about to break
I'm a tower 'pon tectonic plate

Feel me now

Why you think I'm havin' everything you're rimmin' ass for, ask 'em
Whose ass they're rimmin' when I'm flaggin'
Load your cannon shutter flash heavy damage
Steady hand shit forget me you can't bitch
Slappin' click-clack tricks stretch please
My sleeves plastic can't breath in this atmos'
Fuck atlas my ego palms planets
Fuck you yeah yeah it's that fuck you can't stand slip
Cut you 'cause I can dip

Feel me now

I'm the man who press that button'
Sweaty palm get caught bluffin'
Fold a man into nothin' for nothin'
My oxidized gold shaft floods your jugular with Lucifer
I'll shoot it word, feel like you swallowed Jupiter
Today your city, tomorrow lifting the universe
One way in, one way out
Cheek in tongue when in doubt
Feel me now
