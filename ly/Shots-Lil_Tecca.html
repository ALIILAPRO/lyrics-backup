		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Internet Money, bitch)
(We love you, Tecca)

Yeah, ooh, I got hella niggas with the shits
Nigga run up on me, all my niggas 'bout to shoot
Talking on the 'Gram, catch a deuce
We can get in tune, nigga, what you wanna do?
Nigga, you ain't even have a clue
'Cause I got shottas on me
Sending shots, sending shots, the doctor on me
Better run, better run, the coppers on me, yeah

Yeah, I know, yeah, I know
Got bad bitches come wherever I go
Married to the money, I can't cheat with no ho
Nigga run up on me, guaranteed we gon' blow
I ain't helping nobody, if you ask me, it's a no
If I tell you that I love you, better keep it on the low
I got places that I'm really tryna go
So if you're down for the ride, let me know
Hollow chase a nigga, never chase opps
I committed to money, I never chase thots
And I'm attracted to guala so I'ma chase guap
Yeah, and I'm attracted to guala so I'ma chase guap

Yeah, ooh, with the shits
Niggas, they be talkin', we gon' shoot
Got your bitch
Shawty said she love me, I don't really love her

Yeah, ooh, I got hella niggas with the shits
Nigga run up on me, all my niggas 'bout to shoot
Talking on the 'Gram, catch a deuce
We can get in tune, nigga, what you wanna do?
Nigga, you ain't even have a clue
'Cause I got shottas on me
Sending shots, sending shots, the doctor on me
Better run, better run, the coppers on me, yeah

Ooh, I got hella niggas with the shits
Nigga run up on me, all my niggas 'bout to shoot
Talking on the 'Gram, catch a deuce
We can get in tune, nigga, what you wanna do?
Nigga, you ain't even have a clue
'Cause I got shottas on me
Sending shots, sending shots, the doctor on me
Better run, better run, the coppers on me, yeah
