		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's a man in the corner of a smokey bar
He lights up a cigarette in the dark
Lookin' in his glass like it's a way to his past
Pulls down the brim of his black felt cowboy hat
I had to ask him where he had been
And he told me the same place you're gonna take your sins
And with a spark in his eye I think he started to cry mmhmm
And I ain't never seen that look
In a grown man's eye
Western tears
You try to hide em from your face
But they come with the years
When you roam in from place to place
And you're caught beneath the rubble
And you shoot too many doubles
And you try to lose the trouble of your fears
All you're left with is sitting here
Cryin' western tears
It reminds me of a girl chasin' down
A world getting so close to a dream
But a couple wrong turns led to a crash and a burn
And she tried not to feel a thing
Tucson Arizona weighed on her shoulders
She wondered why it all was so damn mean
But soon, soon she'd see
What fate would bring
Western tears
You try to hide em from your face
But they come with the years
When you roam in from place to place
And you're caught beneath the rubble
When you shoot too many doubles
And you try to lose the trouble of your fears
All you're left with is sitting here
Yeah you're cryin' western, western tears
Cryin' western, western tears
