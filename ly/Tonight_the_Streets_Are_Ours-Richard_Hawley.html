		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do you know why you got feelings in your heart'
Don't let fear of feeling fool you
What you see sets you apart
And there's nothing here to bind you
It's no way for life to start

Do you know that tonight the streets are ours'
Tonight the streets are ours
These lights in our hearts they tell no lies

Those people they got nothing in their souls
And they make our TVs blind us
From our vision and our goals
Oh, the trigger of time it tricks you
So you have no way to grow

But do you know that tonight the streets are ours'
Tonight the streets are ours
These lights in our hearts they tell no lies

And no one else can haunt me
The way that you can haunt me
I need to know you want me
I couldn't be without you
And the light that shines around you

No nothing ever mattered more than not doubting
That tonight the streets are ours

Do you know how to kill loneliness at last'
Oh, there's so much there to heal dear
And make tear stains of the past

But do you know that tonight the streets are ours'
Tonight the streets are ours
These lights in our street are ours

Tonight the streets are ours
These lights in our hearts they tell no lies
