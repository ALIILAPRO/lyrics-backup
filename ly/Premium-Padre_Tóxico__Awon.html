		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Beautiful spaces
Beautiful places
Fill it with life it is amazing
Just closed even brought the furniture
From staging
Ligne Roset Togo
With the slight Fragrance
Of purple from my clothes after I burn one
In the pool on sunsets for the burnt sun
Pinkish and purple hues
Over the rooftop
Watching reruns of Watchmen and the Boondocks
The wife made veggie lasagna
Only sparkling agua
Champagne when we proper
Grilling up shrimp with the scallops and the lobster
Only cocktail sauce
We don't want no tartar
Maybe remoulade with a little kick
Close my eyes and I dream of being really rich
Daddy used to move bricks back in 86
So my babies deserve 911 on the whip

Smooth with the groove
Expedient
Back hands for the disobedient
Optimism is the main ingredient
Big tune the fidelity is premium
Smooth with the groove
Expedient
Back hands for the disobedient
Optimism is the main ingredient
Big tune the fidelity is premium

Cruise whip poppa regular shopper at the Wegmans
Cause I'm eating like a mobster
People great me and treat me like a doctor
Your bars helped me with the struggle
Damn That's an honor for me
That's an Oscar
Shining like a precious stone
Versace homme the pheromone
It's a blessing homes
To roam the planet earth Paris is my favorite city
I love sparking on the terrace living high cidity
Tiff been on private jets for the next tour
First class the only thing that I can endure
So you should explore your mind
Then do it on earth
And You'll find times
The treasure of the universe
Don't waste mine I won't waste yours
Sipping Lemonade
On Saint Tropez shores
Every time you get a little
Make you want more
Life and living
Hitting like uncut raw

Smooth with the groove
Expedient
Back hands for the disobedient
Optimism is the main ingredient
Big tune the fidelity is premium
Smooth with the groove
Expedient
Back hands for the disobedient
Optimism is the main ingredient
Big tune the fidelity is premium
