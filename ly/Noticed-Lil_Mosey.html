		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh
Yeah (ayy, Royce, you did it right here), yeah

I was broke now a young nigga flexed up
In a foreign switchin' lanes, you can't catch up
You was hatin', but you switched up 'cause I'm next up
I got lean and some forty in my red cup
Bitches changed and act like I ain't noticed
Gettin' money nigga, that's my main focus
With .223 and you act like you don't know this
Bro popped a bean, me and my niggas always rollin'

Your ho tweakin'
Me and KK Wok, we always geekin' (always geekin')
Leakin', yeah, my fours leave yo body leakin' (boom, boom)
I be road runnin' every season (every season)
And I just count the bands, my neck is freezin' (count up bands)
Ayy, me, JD, linked with South End, we was thuggin' (we was thuggin')
Outside totin' rachets, holdin' on the work we runnin' (holdin' work)
Now we countin' bands, yeah, my niggas always thumbin' (always thumbin')
And we don't give a fuck 'cause my niggas always drummin'
I was watchin', steady plottin', pistol totin' (pistol totin')
Mixin' beans with my lean, that shit had me floatin' (mixin' beans)
I was broke, now I'm eatin', stomach feelin' bloated (feelin' bloated)
I been showed you how to flex, young nigga wrote it (how to flex)

I was broke now a young nigga flexed up
In a foreign switchin' lanes, you can't catch up
You was hatin', but you switched up 'cause I'm next up
I got lean and some forty in my red cup
Bitches changed and act like I ain't noticed
Gettin' money nigga, that's my main focus
With .223 and you act like you don't know this
Bro popped a bean, me and my niggas always rollin'

I was just a young nigga waitin' (young nigga waitin')
But now we up, no worries, gettin' faded (faded)
Playin', swear these bitches, they always playin' (always playin')
Sayin', I could give a fuck 'bout what you sayin' (give a fuck)
Grew up 50th avenue, tweakers laid up next to dude
Need a bigger revenue, so I stayed tryna sell to you
Niggas always testing me, so I stay with that .32 (with a .32)
You can't roll with bros and me, 'cause we gon' blast that .22 (brrah)
Yeah, you know, I said you knew it, yeah
I turn heads when I roll through, yeah
You know I'm with the, with the crew, yeah
Circle small, so it's just two times two, yeah

I was broke now a young nigga flexed up
In a foreign switchin' lanes, you can't catch up
You was hatin', but you switched up 'cause I'm next up
I got lean and some forty in my red cup
Bitches changed and act like I ain't noticed
Gettin' money nigga, that's my main focus
With .223 and you act like you don't know this
Bro popped a bean, me and my niggas always rollin'
