		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Time and time again my hopes are gone
It's like a never-ending marathon
I hear voices every night
Of the ones I left behind
That I love

I'm trying to find the place where I belong
Until I do I guess I'll carry on
Trapped in every sacrifice
Feel like I'm gonna lose my mind
No freedom
Without love
Without love
Without love

I played the game of life and had a ball
Crazy of me to think I had it all
But it doesn't matter anymore
And I kept holding on to the power and lost
My freedom

I had to leave my comfort to explore
And if the gods sail with me through the storms
I'll be brave in every fight
And I'm prepared to lose my life
For what I want

Spoiled by all the riches I have won
While my search to find the perfect home
Just goes on and on (on and on)
I get lonely every night
My greatest enemy is time
No freedom
Without love
Without love
Without love

I played the game of life and had a ball
Crazy of me to think I had it all
And I kept holding on to the power and lost
My freedom

Who have I become
Is my weakness being strong
Am I cursed to be alone
For this journey that I'm on
And through all the blood, sweat, and tears
My only fear is
Love in my destiny, isn't clear?

I played the game of life and had a ball (i played the game of life and had a ball)
Crazy of me to think I had it all (crazy of me to think I had it all)
But it doesn't matter anymore
And I kept holding on to the power and lost
'Cause I kept holding on to the power and lost
And I kept holding on to the power and lost
My freedom

I guess I had to learn there is no freedom
Without love
