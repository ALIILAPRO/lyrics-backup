		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's a million songs in my head
I could sing at the top of my lungs
There's a million melodies I can't forget
But you'll always be my number one

Another day
Another night gone
You know what they say
You'll find the right one
And every face just fades with the last song
But you'll always be my number one
Two shots to numb the feelings, still I'm under your control now
Tell me that you believe in us, ah-ah
I'm terrified that I'll be singin' all the words alone
'Cause you'll always be my number one

There's a million songs in my head
I could sing at the top of my lungs
There's a million melodies I can't forget
But you'll always be my number one
There's a million songs in my head
I could sing at the top of my lungs
There's a million melodies I can't forget
But you'll always be my number one

There's a million melodies I can't forget
But you'll always be my number one

I'm holdin' on
Until the last note
So you should know
I'll never let go
'Cause you're the one that I can't forget
I try to remember my heart and head
It always leads me back to you

There's a million songs in my head
I could sing at the top of my lungs
There's a million melodies I can't forget
But you'll always be my number one
There's a million songs in my head
I could sing at the top of my lungs
There's a million melodies I can't forget
But you'll always be my number one

There's a million melodies I can't forget
But you'll always be my number one

There's a million songs in my head
I could sing at the top of my lungs
There's a million melodies I can't forget
But you'll always be my number one
