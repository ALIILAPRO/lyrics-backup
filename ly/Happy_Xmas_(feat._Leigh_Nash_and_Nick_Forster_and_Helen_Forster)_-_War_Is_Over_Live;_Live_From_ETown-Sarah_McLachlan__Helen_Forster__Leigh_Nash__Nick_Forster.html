		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So this is Christmas and what have you done
Another year over, a new one just begun

And so this is Christmas, I hope you have fun
The near and the dear ones, the old and the young

A very merry Christmas and a happy New Year
Let's hope it's a good one without any fears

And so this is Christmas for weak and for strong
For rich and poor ones, the road is so long

And so happy Christmas for black and for white
For yellow and red ones let's stop all the fights

A very merry Christmas and a happy New Year
Let's hope it's a good one without any fear

And so this is Christmas and what have we done
Another year over, a new one just begun

And so happy Christmas we hope you have fun
The near and the dear ones, the old and the young

A very merry Christmas and a happy New Year
Let's hope it's a good one without any fear

War is over if you want it, war is over now
