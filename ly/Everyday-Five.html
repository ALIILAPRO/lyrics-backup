		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everyday I got you on my mind
Everyday
I just keep
It all inside 

You got me trippin'
Because I want you back and you don't know
But if you gave me a chance then maybe we'll find romance 
Come on tell me are you ready to go?
You got me trippin'
Now baby tell me what I gotta do Cause when I'm laying in my bed
and you pop into my 
head all I want to do is get with you. 

Everyday
Round and round
I think about the times and the love I found.
Oh baby, Baby
Everyday
Round and round
My head is in the clouds and it won't be coming down.
Oh baby, baby 

Everyday
I just can't find the time
I just want to say:
A girl like you, 
Is hard to find. 

You got me trippin'
Because I want you back and you don't know
But if you gave me a chance then maybe we'll find romance 
Come on tell me are you ready to go?
You got me trippin'
Now baby tell me what I gotta do
Cause when I'm laying in my bed and you pop into my head all I
want to do is get with you. 

Everyday
Round and round
I think about the times and the love I found.
Oh baby, Baby
Everyday
Round and round
My head is in the clouds and it won't be coming down.
Oh baby, baby 

Well there she goes again running circles round my mind -
Yeah I know just what you're saying but you know the girl is
mine. 
You but maybe I can get her if I show her what I got
What you got I got double come on give it a shot.
You trying to take my girl, trying to mess around with Mrs.
Right?
Now but how can I be helping when I dream of her at night
There she is up in my head everytime I close my eyes
So I think I;m gonna call her just to see if she replies. 

You got me trippin'
Because I want you back and you don't know
But if you gave me a chance then maybe we'll find romance 
Come on tell me are you ready to go?
You got me trippin'
Now baby tell me what I gotta do
Cause when I'm laying in my bed and you pop into my head all I
want to do is get with you. 

Everyday
Round and round
I think about the times and the love I found.
Oh baby, Baby
Everyday
Round and round
My head is in the clouds and it won't be coming down.
Oh baby, baby 

Everyday
Round and round
I think about the times and the love I found.
Oh baby, Baby
Everyday
Round and round
My head is in the clouds and it won't be coming down.
Oh baby, baby
