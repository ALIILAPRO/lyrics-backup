		  You
I'm running with you

Baby, I've made up my mind
While I was staring in your eyes
Losing track of the time
Let's make it last forever
Darlin', I wanna run away together

So, where are we going tonight now, baby?
Where am I going tonight now, baby?

With you
I'm runnin' with you
With you
I'm runnin' with you

Baby, we know this is it
Both of us have been searchin' our whole life for this shit
We've got no time to waste
Darling, can we please get out of this place?

So, where are we going tonight now, baby?
Where am I going tonight now, baby?

With you
I'm running with you
With you
I'm running with you

It seems like we've both been waitin'
I've got no more time for wastin'
I've been searching my whole life, baby, it's true

I wanna be with you
I'm running with you
With you
I'm running with you
