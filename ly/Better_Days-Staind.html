		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been feeling out of control
There's no healing between all the roads
And there's no comfort
Am I losing my soul?
Is it too late, to just let 'em go?

And someday I will wake up and everything has changed
Until then I will dream of better days
Still living in the sorrow and learning from the pain
Until then I will dream of better days

I tried to hold on but it slipped through my hands
Do you believe in a second chance for all we've been through?
Don't you think we deserve so much more than this hurt?

And someday I will wake up and everything has changed
Until then I will dream of better days
Still living in the sorrow and learning from the pain
Until then I will dream of better days
Of better days

I've been feeling so out of control
There's no healing

And someday I will wake up and everything has changed
Until then I will dream of better days
Still living in the sorrow and learning from the pain
Until then I will dream of better days

Someday I will wake up and everything has changed
Until then I will dream of better days
Still living in the sorrow and learning from the pain
Until then I will dream of better days
Of better days
Of better days
Of better days
