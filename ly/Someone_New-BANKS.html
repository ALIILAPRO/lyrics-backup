		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can love you desperately, though your love ain't guaranteed
Oh, I wish you knew the deal, gotta learn from far away
And I simply needed space
Space for me to be, and I think you need it too
Though I know you call me selfish for assuming
I did this for you too,
You still got me around your finger
Even though I'm far away
Please, believe me when I say!

Everything I do,
I'm gonna think of you
Don't know what else to do
You got me, you got me, baby
Everything I make,
I only make for you!
Baby, be patient for me
And please don't fall in love with someone new
I promise, one day I'll come back for you

Oh, you say you hate me now,
And you burn me with your words
Callin' me a fool
Saying that I've fucked up
Everything, and you'll never forgive me
Though I'm doin' this for you
Baby, can't you see if there is such a thing
Of loving someone so much that you need
To give them time to let them breathe
But you don't understand,
I wish you understood
Oh, I hope one day you do

Everything I do,
I'm gonna think of you
Don't know what else to do
You got me, you got me, baby
Everything I make,
I only make for you
Baby, be patient for me
And please don't fall in love with someone new
I promise, one day I'll come back for you

Believe in you, believe in me
We're meant to be together
I told you weren't lyin', I know you aren't relyin'
And now I am supplyin' you the time and space
To let you grow into the person
That I know, that I know you could be
And I can be one too
And I'll come back to you,
And I am ready for you, baby I am ready for you now
I'm not ready for you now
Please don't hate me

Everything I do,
I'm gonna think of you
Don't know what else to do
You got me, you got me, baby
Everything I make, I'm gonna make for you!
Baby, be patient for me
And please don't fall in love with someone new
I promise, one day I'll come back for you

I promise, one day, I'll come back to you
I promise, one day, I'll come back to you
I promise baby, one day, I'll come back to you
I promise baby, one day, I'll come back to you
