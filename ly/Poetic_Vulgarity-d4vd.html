		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hello, are you there?
'Cause I missed you at the show tonight (Mmhm)
Anytime, anywhere, I just want to make sure you're alright
If you're off with someone better
Then I won't fault you
What can I do but complain about us?
Times were better, but it seems minute
The grand scheme of things never seemed to like us
We never fit in the same frame
The pictures always cut me out
The right love, but in the wrong time frame
Heart too small, you had to push me out (Mmm, mmm, mmm)
(Mmmm, mmmm, mmm)
Verse 2
Hello, I'm still here, and I'm holding my tears in my hands (Mmm)
And if you were gonna walk away
The least you could have done was say in advance
"I'm leaving you"
Heartless woman, time-consuming, headache-inducing whore
That's all that you are, that's all you ever were
I'm sorry for bruising you up with my words
But you did the same not too long ago
How does it feel to have your heart in your throat?
And biting the flesh
How does it taste?
I still remember the kisses you gave
To a broken boy
Drown out the noise
Everything that you once had in your voice
Is no longer there, trapped in the void
Of everything that we once tried to destroy
(Hoooo, hoooo, hooooo)
