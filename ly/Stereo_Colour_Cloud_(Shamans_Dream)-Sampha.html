		  Bro
Samph, bro, wake-
I wish you, could, time
Time, missile, back, forward
I miss you, time, misuse
Time flies, life issues

Hardwired, forever seeking out
Subjects mysterious like time and love
Walking through them now
I see you mirror me, we oscillate
Around each other's smiles
I think we found ourselves a sacred place
A space to dream out loud
Zero in on your eyes, the safest place
For this troubled child (are you dreaming?)
Facing infinity, my demons fly
And chase me on the ground
We grow a pair of wings and fly on high (nah, you're flying)
The forest in the clouds
The trees are talking in a frequency
Something close to sound
I hear them questioning like

Who do you care about? (Care about)
Who's there when you're down? (You're down)
Who do you care about? (Care about)
Watch who you care about

I miss you
Time misuse, time
Who keeps talking through my dreams?
Time flies, life issues (flying about th-)

Time, missile, back, forward
I miss you, time misuse
Time flies, life issues
Time flies, life issues
Back, forward, I miss you
Back, forward, I miss you (I miss you, time misuse)
I miss you, time misuse (time flies, life issues)
Time flies, life issues

Falling through (falling through, falling through)
I was falling through clouds and (through clouds and, through clouds and)
That's where I felt it (that's where I felt it, that's where I felt it)
Some (some), some kind of spirit (kind of spirit, kind of spirit)
Or something (or something, or something)
