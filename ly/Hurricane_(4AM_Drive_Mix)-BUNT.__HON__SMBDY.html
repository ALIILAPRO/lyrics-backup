		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Look at me the way you do
Is it magic or the lighting
Is it something that I'm fighting
When you look at me the way you do
All the feelings sitting under
Now I'm saying it's no wonder

I'm here in the middle of the night
In the middle of the night i swear
That I'll never say goodbye
That I'll never say goodbye i can't
Can't ever see a time
When you and I aren't you and I baby, I
Don't know what else to do

It's almost like you
Hit me like a hurricane
Every time you say my name
I can feel it in my body
Baby, stop me or I might
Not make another day don't turn away
Just say you got me, you got me
Cause' I don't want this hurricane to end

Looking at a photograph
Is it crazy that I miss you
Got me staring at your picture
When you told me that you loved me back
All the feelings out from under
Now I'm saying it's no wonder

I'm here in the middle of the night
In the middle of the night i swear
That I'll never say goodbye
That I'll never say goodbye i can't
Can't ever see a time
When you and I aren't you and I baby, I
Don't know what else to do

It's almost like you
Hit me like a hurricane
Every time you say my name
I can feel it in my body
Baby, stop me or I might
Not make another day don't turn away
Just say you got me, you got me
Cause' I don't want this hurricane to end
End, end
Cause' I don't want this hurricane to
End, end
Cause' I don't want this hurricane to end
