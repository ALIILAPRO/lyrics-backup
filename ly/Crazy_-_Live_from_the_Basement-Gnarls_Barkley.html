		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I remember when
I remember, I remember when I lost my mind
There was something so pleasant about that place
Even your emotions have an echo in so much space

And when you're out there, without care
I was out of touch
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough
I just knew too much, oh yeah

Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Possibly

And I hope that you are having the time of your life, right now
But think twice
That's my only advice

Come on now, who do you
Who do you
Who do you think you are? Sing New York City, sing this part with me
(Ha ha ha, bless your soul)
You really think you're in control?
No

I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
Just like me

My heroes had the heart
To lose their lives out on a limb
And all I remember, is thinking
I wanna be like them, oh yeah
Mmhmm, and ever since I was little
Ever since I was little it looked like fun
And that is no coincidence I've come, no chance
And I'll die when I'm done
But I'm not done

But maybe I'm crazy
Maybe you're crazy
Maybe we're crazy
Wait and see, oh
