		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Kool Thing sittin' with a kitty
Now you know you're sure lookin' pretty
Like a lover not a dancer
Superboy take a little chance here
I don't want to, I don't think so
I don't want to, I don't think so

Kool Thing let me play it with your radio
Move me, turn me on, baby-o
I'll be your slave
Give you a shave
I don't want to, I don't think so
I don't want to, I don't think so

Yeah, tell'em about it
Hit'em where it hurts
Hey, Kool Thing, come here, sit down beside me
There's something I go to ask you
I just want to know, what are you gonna do for me?
I mean, are you gonna liberate us girls
From male white corporate oppression?
Tell it like it is!
Huh?
Yeah!
Don't be shy
Word up!
Fear of a female planet?
Fear of a female planet?
Fear, baby!
I just want you to know that we can still be friends
Let everybody know
Kool Kool Thing, Kool Kool Thing

When you're a star, I know that you'll fix everything

Kool Thing sittin' with a kitty
Now you know you're sure lookin' pretty
Rock the beat just a little faster
Now I know you are the master
I don't want to, I don't think so
I don't want to, I don't think so

Kool Thing walkin' like a panther
Come on and give me an answer
Kool Thing walkin' like a panther
What'd he say?
I don't want to, I don't think so
I don't want to, I don't think so
