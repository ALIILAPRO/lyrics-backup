		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Stand under the stained glass and
I will know it's you
The whites of your eyes burn
From across the room

And I'm not here to be
The saviour you long for
Only the one you don't
Are you watching me with eyes of a predator
As you move towards the door?

Show me those pretty white jaws
Show me where the delicate stops
Show me what you've lost
And why you're always taking it slow
Show me what wounds you've got show me love
Show me those pretty white jaws
Show me where the delicate stops
Show me what you've lost
And why you're always taking it slow
Show me what wounds you've got
Show me love, oh

Oh, and I, I believe we are locked
Caged and always provoked
By prey left unattended

And I'm not here to be
The saviour you long for
Only the one you don't
Are you watching me with eyes of a predator
As you move towards the door? Oh, oh, oh

Show me those pretty white jaws
Show me where the delicate stops
Show me what you've lost
And why you're always taking it slow
Show me what wounds you've got show me love
Show me those pretty white jaws
Show me where the delicate stops
Show me what you've lost
And why you're always taking it slow
Show me what wounds you've got show me love
Show me those pretty white jaws
Show me where the delicate stops
Show me what you've lost
And why you're always taking it slow
Show me what wounds you've got
Show me love, oh
