		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ok

As a young kid I studied
The unknown on the internet
Sacred geometries metatrons Cube
The Flower of Life the Worldsoul
Y'know all that

When you're- when you're a kid y'know
You wanna try and understand the world
Try and find your place in it
People love to tell you your place in it but
Isn't that just for them?
Isn't it always just for them?

But it makes sense to wanna
Know what your place in the world should be
But it's not for them
It's never ever ever been just for thеm

I never nevеr never never never
Never should have tried
I never should have tried but
It's not my fault
What does it really take to
Want to hurt a child?
It seems like it's not much
For a lot of people
