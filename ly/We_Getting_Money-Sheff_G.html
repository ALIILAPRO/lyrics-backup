		  'Cause we got the bag on, tell 'em
"We getting money" look, look

We gettin' money
Please do not act like you know me
'Cause we got the bag on
Tell 'em, "We getting money"
Bitches gon' act like they love us
Gon' treesh for the bag on
Tell 'em, "We getting money" huh
Young niggas flexin', we flippin' a bag on
Tell 'em, "We getting money" huh
You disrespectin', we droppin' a bag on 'em
Nigga, we gettin' money
Please do not act like you know me
'Cause we got the bag on
Tell 'em, "We getting money"
Bitches gon' act like they love us
Gon' treesh for the bag on
Tell 'em, "We getting money" huh
Young niggas flexin', we flippin' a bag on
Tell 'em, "We getting money" huh
You disrespectin'
We droppin' a bag on 'em

Nigga, look at me now
I was the kid on the block
I was lightin' shit up like some watch
It get hot like a fever
Dropped out of school, caught some charges
I never thought that I would beat 'em
Free Billy, free Caesar, nigga
I see you fakin' that smile underneath
And you mad as fuck, huh
It's funny they love when you down, when
You up, they be mad as fuck, huh
Man, I know some young niggas catchin'
Them bodies but them niggas virgins
And I know some niggas who talk like they
'bout it but drills be unheard of
And I see 'em niggas
Who followin', copyin', tryna be the gang
But we could never be the same
'cause my niggas puttin' in pain
We switchin' up game

We gettin' money
Please do not act like you know me
'Cause we got the bag on
Tell 'em, "We getting money"
Bitches gon' act like they love us
Gon' treesh for the bag on
Tell 'em, "We getting money" huh
Young niggas flexin', we flippin' a bag on
Tell 'em, "We getting money" huh
You disrespectin'
We droppin' a bag on 'em
Nigga, we gettin' money
Please do not act like you know me
'Cause we got the bag on
Tell 'em, "We getting money"
Bitches gon' act like they love us
Gon' treesh for the bag on
Tell 'em, "We getting money" huh
Young niggas flexin', we flippin' a bag on
Tell 'em, "We getting money" huh
You disrespectin', we droppin' a
Bag on 'em, bag on 'em

Gang with us
You do not bang, I can't trust you
We carry no lames with us, huh
You switched on gang for a bitch
Ain't no sorry, she led you
Too stray from us, huh
They talk about drillin', they talk about
Drillin', they talk about drillin', look
They talk about drilling, they
Talk about drilling, talk about drillin'
Talk about drillin' and fuck it
You thinkin' I'm soft
Bitch, you buggin', my anger be sudden
I'ma just brtt to brattin' and
Then unload my guns bro, you back with 'em
They get the panickin'
Look at 'em feelin' that
Pain from the bullets
Them hollows is achin' 'em
Legs get to shakin' and mans
Can't do shit for you he could hit with you
RIP status, know them niggas missin' you
'Cause we def' ain't missin' you
Told them I switch up the
Music but these niggas chattin', look
Last year, was into the drillin'
But fuck it
'Cause these niggas rattin', look
I told them I switch up the music
But these niggas really be chattin', look
And last year, was into the drilling
But fuck it, 'cause these niggas rattin'

We gettin' money, man, we gettin'
Money, man, we gettin' money, uh
We gettin' money, man, we gettin'
Money, man, we gettin' money, uh
We gettin' money, man, we gettin'
Money, man, we gettin' money, uh
We gettin' money, man, we gettin' money
We gettin' money
