		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I messed my pants at work today 
Right in front of boss
It was nice before the cold
Sucking on an orange peel
Trying to reinvent the wheel
And I'm never sure which way is backwards anymore

Please fill out form papers sir 
I guess that's okay
I went to knowledge college last year
Mash potato, eggs and beans 
Latex, leather, lace
I've forgotten all my dreams 
I swear

When I pass the old house on Tuesday morning
And the funeral directors all look 
Just the same 
As they did 
Right before the crash

It's never been the same 
It's never been the same
It's never been the same
It's never been the same
