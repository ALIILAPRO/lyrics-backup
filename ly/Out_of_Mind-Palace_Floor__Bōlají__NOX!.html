		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The lady with the brown eyes
Got sick and tired of her loud lies
Out of sight, out of mind
It was good for the time
When you left, it felt right
I never needed you in my life
Then I proceeded to (get me right)
What did I see in you (at the time)
Saw past through all of the tears that you cried
Out of my sight now you out of my mind
(Now you out of my-)
Everything you said it was useless
First you was a fan now you Ruthless
Yea we used to spend a bag up in Ruth Chris
Now you looking at me mad cuz your too hit
Thought you were mental , too sensitive so I tried to be gentle
I opened up and got too sentimental
Used everything that I found Confidential (Against me)
Had to walk away
Cuz I never thought I'd see the day (girl)
Thought I needed space
Cuz you had me in a darker place (girl)
Living, now you pace
Sit and contemplate
Thinking bout' the late hours spent wasted at the lake
You missing, now it's late
Too late, go and pray
Reminisce on all the gold had sitting on your plate
Out of sight, out of mind
It was good for the time
When you left, it felt right
I never needed you in my life
Then I proceeded to (get me right)
What did I see in you (at the time)
Saw past through all of the tears that you cried
Out of my sight now you out of my mind
(Now you out of my-)
Our relation got a little complicated
No more love, no more trust, the thing bout us
Back and forth is driving me crazy, worthwhile when you my baby
With the henny bag I get open, wombs all open, heart still broken
There's still something
That I need from you, clarity, I've been wondering
Leaving now I know you coming back
Look me in the eye and say exactly why you mad
All of the resentment you can leave it in the past
Cause I know just what you need let me set you free
Romance leaves eventually, so let's not spend time arguing
That's skin on skin it's ecstasy
Can we run it back , run it back
Out of sight, out of mind
It was good for the time
When you left, it felt right
I never needed you in my life
Then I proceeded to (get me right)
What did I see in you (at the time)
Saw past through all of the tears that you cried
Out of my sight now you out of my mind
(Now you out of my-)
