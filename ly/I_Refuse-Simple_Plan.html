		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  (Whoa, whoa, whoa-oh-whoa)
(Whoa, whoa, whoa-oh-whoa)

Stop being such a freak
Nobody wants you here
That's what they said to me
There's something wrong with you
Why don't you disappear
That's what they said to me

Why should we all be stereotypes
Why don't we all
Just stand up and fight
In my blood, in my veins
In my heart
I know what's right for me

(So I refuse)
To apologize for who I am
(And I refuse)
To ever let somebody say I can't
I refuse, I refuse, I refuse
I refuse, I refuse, I refuse
(So I refuse)
To let the words you say get to me
(And I refuse)
To keep on suffering quietly
I refuse, I refuse, I refuse
I refuse, I refuse, I refuse
(So I refuse)

(Whoa, whoa, whoa-oh-whoa)
So I refuse
(Whoa, whoa, whoa-oh-whoa)

You'll never make it far
You're just a hopeless case
That's what they said to me
How can I make it clear
You're just a big mistake
That's what they said to me

You don't control me
This is my life
When will you wake up
And open your eyes
In my blood, in my veins
In my heart
I know what's right for me

(So I refuse)
To apologize for who I am
(And I refuse)
To ever let somebody say I can't
I refuse, I refuse, I refuse
I refuse, I refuse, I refuse
(So I refuse)
To let the words you say get to me
(And I refuse)
To keep on suffering quietly
I refuse, I refuse, I refuse
I refuse, I refuse, I refuse

No matter what you think
You won't decide my fate
I can do anything
No matter what you say
'Cause in my blood, in my veins
In my heart
I know what's right for me

(So I refuse)
To apologize for who I am
(And I refuse)
To ever let somebody say I can't
I refuse, I refuse, I refuse
I refuse, I refuse, I refuse
(So I refuse)
To let the words you say get to me
(And I refuse)
To keep on suffering quietly
I refuse, I refuse, I refuse
I refuse, I refuse, I refuse
So I refuse

(Whoa, whoa, whoa-oh-whoa)
So I refuse
(Whoa, whoa)
