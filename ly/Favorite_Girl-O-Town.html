		  Mm, mm
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Mm, mm

Damn its like there she was (she's so)
This sweet lady (lady)
Man, she was lookin' so tight
That it drove me crazy (insane)
And I'll never go over trying
Tryin' to make this lady (ooh)
Oh how I wish that I wasn't so shy
It wasn't that I, I never had experience in
In chasing ladies (oh no)
Oh did I miss my chance
Hell I must be crazy
If I ever get the chance (the chance)
The chance to see her again
That's when I'll tell her that I need her so

She was my favorite girl
She was sweet as candy (sweet as candy)
And I gotta tell her that I wanna make her my baby (my baby)
And if we get the chance (the chance)
The chance to meet, yeah
That's when I'll tell her
That I need her so

Now I'm back on the block
In my new Jaguar
Trying to find this lady
Never gonna admit, I won't stop (til I)
Till I find my baby (baby)
Back down the alley way
I'm going crazy (yeah)
If it ever crossed my mind
That I wouldn't find this lady

Reality (ooh)
My mind's playin' tricks on me (yeah)
How could this be (that she)
She could have this effect on me
Right before my very eyes (there she was)
That's where I found her
And then I told her
That I need her so

She was my favorite girl
She was sweet as candy (sweet as candy)
And I gotta tell her that I wanna make her my baby (my baby)
And if we get the chance (the chance)
The chance to meet, yeah
That's when I'll tell her
That I need her so

She was my favorite girl
She was sweet as candy (sweet as candy)
And I gotta tell her that I wanna make her my baby (my baby)
And if we get the chance (the chance)
The chance to meet, yeah
That's when I'll tell her
That I need her so

She was my favorite girl
She was sweet as candy (sweet as candy)
And I gotta tell her that I wanna make her my baby (my baby)
And if we get the chance (the chance)
The chance to meet, yeah
That's when I'll tell her
That I need her so

Listen up here fellas (fellas)
If you ever find that girl (girl)
That girl you really want (yeah)
Go ahead and tell her
You don't wanna wait too long (too long)
She might find another (yeah)
And you don't wanna leave yourself
Shoulda, coulda

She was my favorite girl
She was sweet as candy (sweet as candy)
And I gotta tell her that I wanna make her my baby (my baby)
And if we get the chance (the chance)
The chance to meet, yeah
That's when I'll tell her
That I need her so

She was my favorite girl
She was sweet as candy (sweet as candy)
And I gotta tell her that I wanna make her my baby (my baby)
And if we get the chance (the chance)
The chance to meet, yeah
That's when I'll tell her
That I need her so

She was my favorite girl
She was sweet as candy (sweet as candy)
And I gotta tell her that I wanna make her my baby (my baby)
And if we get the chance (the chance)
The chance to meet, yeah
That's when I'll tell her
That I need her so

I need her so
She's so sweet candy
I made her so
