		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lift up Your voices now, sing praises unto God
For all the things that He has done
All for it, all to Him, He is the morning sun
Sing praises unto God

We lift our voices to God
(C'mon, let's take it up everybody, lift up Your voices)
Lift up Your voices now, sing praises unto God
(For how many things?)
For all the things that He has done
All for it, all to Him (He is)
He is the morning sun (come on and lift Your voice and sing)
Sing praises unto God

We lift our voices to God
(To the King of Kings, to the Lord of Lords, c'mon and lift 'em)
We lift our voices to God
(Say it again, c'mon, "Lift up Your voices now")
Lift up Your voices now
Sing praises unto God (for how many things?)
For all the things that He has done
All for it, all to Him
He is the morning sun (c'mon, c'mon, use that voice)
Sing praises unto God
We lift our voices to God
(Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, we)
We lift our voices to God (sing it)

Oh, we praise You, Lord
Oh, we praise You, Lord (he's been so good to us, praise You)
Oh, we praise You, Lord
(For who You are, for what You've done)
Oh, we praise You, Lord
(C'mon altos, sing Your song to the king)

We worship, we praise You
Adore You, we love You
We worship, we praise You
Adore You, we love You
We worship, we praise You
Adore You, we love You
We worship, we praise You
Adore You, we love You

For all of the things You have done
For all of the things You have done
(He put food on the table, He woke us up this morning, for all)
For all of the things You have done
(All the strength today, c'mon, tell 'em, tell 'em)
For all of the things You have done
(C'mon, can we put it all together? Let Him know, we worship)

We worship, (praise) we praise You
(Adore) Adore You, (love You, Lord) we love You
We worship, (hallelujah) we praise You
(We adore You) Adore You
(We so love You) We love You
We worship (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
We praise You (oh, woo)
Adore You, we love You
We worship, (we praise You) we praise You
Adore You, we love You
We worship, we praise You
(Adore) Adore You, we love You
We worship, we praise You
Adore You, we love You
We worship, we praise You
Adore You, we love You
We worship, (praise you) we praise You
(Adore You) Adore You, we love You

For all of the things You have done
For all of the things You have done 
(Hallelujah, hallelujah, He's done so many things)
For all of the things You have done
For all of the things You have done

C'mon, c'mon, lift those hands up right where you are
C'mon, c'mon, open your mouth and just sing a praise and tell 'em
How good God has been
For who He is? Our protection, our healer, our deliverer
He will never fail us
C'mon, lift it up to him, lift it up, lift it up, lift it up
C'mon, He wants to hear You sing today
Sing it in the car, sing it in the park, it doesn't matter
C'mon, let Him know how much You feel, how You feel about Him

Ooh, ooh
We love you
I love you with my whole heart
Ooh
So much strength, body and mind
I give it all to you
Oh, yeah

(We worship) We worship, (yeah) we praise You
(Adore) Adore You, (yeah) we love You
We worship, (we praise) we praise You
(Adore You) Adore You, we love You
(We lift our hands) we worship, (we bow ourselves) we praise You
(Before Your King) Adore You, (Nobody like You) we love You
(King of Kings) we worship, (yes, we do) we praise You (yeah)
Adore You, we love You
(Put those hands together, we love You)

(For all) For all of the things You have done
For all of the things You have done
(Come on, everybody sing that praise)
For all of the things You have done (for all)
For all of the things You have done (come on, last time)
For all of the things You have done
