		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Cry, cry, cry, cry
That's what I want you to do
And think about the lonely nights
That I sat alone and cried over you

Cry, cry, cry
Let me see you shed a few tears
Maybe you'll realize
What I've been going through for so many years

I want you to cry, cry me a river
I want you to, yes I want you to cry me a sea
Yes, I know someone's gonna hurt you
Just like you been hurting me

Woman, I want you to go out and cry
I want you to get on your knees and cry, baby
Woman, I want you to cry, cry, baby

Cry, cry, cry
Let your tears fall like rain
And maybe I'll realize
That my love for you wasn't in vain

Cry, yes I want you to cry
Yes, I want you to get on your knees and cry
