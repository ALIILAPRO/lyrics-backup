		  featuring Mack 10 

[Warren G] 
What's up? 
This Warren G chillin' with the home boy Mack 10 
We gon' lay a lil' sumpin' down for y'all 
Let y'all know what time it is 
Show you how we keepin' it real wit' it 
You know, 'cause this world is built on material thangs 
But we ain't trippin' off that 
We want y'all to know this, check it 

[Chorus- Warren G] 
I want it all; money, fast cars 
Diamond rings, gold chains and champagne 
Shit, everydamn thing 
I want it all; houses, expenses 
My own business, a truck, hmm, and a couple o' Benz's 
I want it all; brand new socks and draws 
And I'm bawlin everytime I stop and talk to y'all 
I want it all, all, all, all 
I want it all, all, all, all, all 

[Warren G] 
They say, 'There go Warren G with that envious stare' 
I love this game too much, I wish these haters wasn't here 
It's a shame, we came too far to turn back 
It's a cold world, it gets so hard, you learned that 
Won't fall tryin' to walk from crawl 
Tryin' to hustle up from broke to ballin' 
And, yeah, y'all in effect that's all me 
The jiggy G-Z, all my niggas that keep it real and do it easy 
Believe me, young nigga, fat meat is greasy 
And shit stink, so if you plan a lick and hit a bank 
And get away, or get gaffled the very next day
Don't cry, hold your head up high 
And remember what you told yourself 
I said remember what you told yourself 
I said remember what you told yourself 
I said remember what you told yourself 
Ha ha 

[Chorus] 

[Mack 10] 
I want it all, so I got to wake up and ball 
And thanks to y'all, I got plaques on the wall 
Mack 10 laced with the know how to paper chase 
Crushed ice, throw my Rollie face in the platinum fan base 
>From net workin' and hustlin', no doubt, I got slout 
And live the lifestyle that Robin Leech talkin' about 
Slow down, player, don't hate 'cause you can't relate 
The Bentley Coupes and kickin' gears on Harley's with the straights 
I got more lime light than Vegas on cable 
Willing enable to shoot, seen nervios at the craps table 
And while you can't get off the ground, I'm getting high 
Fuckin' fly and fly, with desire to build an empire 
I strapped up and took flight like a missile 
Told them loud and clear as a whistle 'Hoo Bangin' is official' 
Handing out gold medallions at roll-call 
I'ma ball and never fall 'cause Mack 10 want it all 

[Chorus] 

[Warren G] 
Me and 10 get paid escapade to the spot 
We hots like rocks served on hot blocks 
I notice money make the world circulate 
So we gon' stack and stack and take a sip in ?Perkle Lake? 
Bump, let the woofers sub (sub), show the homies love (love) 
Warren to the G (G), and Little G-Dub (Dub) 
Surface on the low, slide or don't slide at all 
Ride or don't ride at all 
Ha ha 

[Mack 10] 
Warren, I couldn't be more serious about my 'fetti 
I stay tight on the mic and keep the pen movin' steady 
I want it all, dawg, and it might be greed 
I hate to trip, but I got two little mouths to feed 
They don't know nuttin' about no excuses and disrespect 
Or somebody bein' zig with they Daddy's royalty check 
And at that point, I'm through talkin', dawg, enough said 
So, if you owe Mack money, then I suggest you break bread 

[Chorus] 

[Warren G] [Mack 10] 
Mack 10 What up? I know 
The paper's out there, ha ha Yeah, Warren G 
What up? You know 
The paper's out there, ha ha Yeah 
G Funk What up? You know 
The paper's out there, ha ha That's right 
What? Hoo Bangin' What up? We know 
The paper's out there, ha ha That's right, what? 
The whole world 
Paper's out there Speak on it 
Ha ha 
All the hood 
Paper's out there
