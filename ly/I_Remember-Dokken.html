		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There was a time
When our hearts were one
Almost lost you 
Somewhere in the storm
Wings of passion
Cold and hard to bare
I remember you were standing there
Standing there

as we look to the sky
Watching love pass us by
One more time 
We try to catch a ride
In our hopes there is a dream
Sometimes lost so it seems
Don't let love pass us by 
This time

I remember
The tears of joy we shared
In the darkness
When I held you oh so near
Like a dream
I have lost you with the dawn
In the fields standing there alone
Searching for home

as we look to the sky
Watching love pass us by
One more time 
We try to catch a ride
In our hearts there is a dream
Sometimes lost so it seems
Don't let love pass us by 
This time

(guitar solo)

searching for love
Sometimes so hard to see
Searching for love
Sometimes lost in our dreams

as we look to the sky
Watching love passing by
One more time 
We try to catch a ride
In our hearts there is a dream
Sometimes lost so it seems
Don't let love pass us by 
This time
