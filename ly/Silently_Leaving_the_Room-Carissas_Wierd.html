		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  silently leaving the room
gathering your thoughts from the floor
hopefully no one will hear you
silently closing the door
down the long stairs to the hall
out to the streets where you'll find
rumored accounts and hearsay
was it me who acted that way
is it you who should stay
I don't recall ever acting that way
was it you who should've stayed
the truth was deceiving
when the hosts of the evening
found the ghost that was bleeding
drops of blood from the ceiling
someone was laughing, we all prayed for a favor
that the ghost would entertain us with some songs and some notes
but by the ? blood covered all the wood floors
opened all of the windows and all of the doors
broke all of the bottles on streets down below
some blood was frozen
blessed by wounded love
when the ice skates came on the girls finally sang songs
to the tunes of the laughter
while silently leaving the room
