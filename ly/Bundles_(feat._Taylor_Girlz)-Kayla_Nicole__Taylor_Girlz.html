		  Go bad bitch, go bad bitch, go (ah)
Go bad bitch, go bad bitch, go (what?)

My friend got forty-inch hair (hair)
Bitches love to stare (stare)
Touching her derrière (derr-)
Bitch, you want this hair (hair)
My bitch is bad (bad)
Make all you hoes look sad (mad)
Her ass is fat (fat)
My ass is flat (believe that)

My friend got forty-inch hair (hair)
Bitches love to stare (stare)
Touching her derrière (touching)
Bitch, you want this hair (this hair)
My bitch is bad (she bad)
Make all you hoes look sad (they mad)
Her ass is fat (what?)
My ass is flat (yup)

Bad bitch, ass fat (ooh)
forty-inch hair, yours came in a pack (ooh)
Camel toe fat, you can see it from the back
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Go bad bitch, go bad bitch, go (ah)
Go bad bitch, go bad bitch, go (what?)
Go bad bitch, go bad bitch, go (go, go)
Go bad bitch, go bad bitch, go (go, go)

Friend came with the baby hairs (hair)
Lame-ass hoe can't compare (can't)
Be talkin' about me, but they built like a pear
Keep that shit circle, don't fit in no square
Out-of-shape hoes can't sit right here (nope)
Big booty bitch, I need two chairs
That nigga mine, bitch, I don't share
Say what you want, bitch, I don't care

My friend got forty-inch hair (hair)
Bitches love to stare (yeah)
Touching her derrière (yeah)
Bitch, you want this hair (yeah)
My bitch is bad (bad)
Make all you hoes look sad (they mad)
Her ass is fat (fat)
My ass is flat (yeah)

I say what I want, and I mean what I say (yeah)
Just checked my account, it had more than a K (work it)
Went out of state and came back in a day
I showed up late, but I won't be delayed (nuh-uh)
I ain't do shit if I ain't gettin' paid
Bitch, I'm a snack, he want fries with this shake (brrt)
He think he finna come lay up today (woo)
He wanna freak and take me on a date (woo, woo)
But he can't drown, it's a lake
Swishin' like water, they both gravitate
Stylin' on bitches like Arrogant Tae
Bitch, I'm a Barbie, the one you can't take
I fuck with the kid, but I do not play
Runnin' on bitches like I'm a relay (woo)
You cannot sis me, we do not relate (yeah)
And that ain't my bitch if we not gettin' cake

My friend got forty-inch hair (yeah)
Bitches love to stare (yeah)
Touching her derrière (what?)
Bitch, you want this hair (uh, uh)
My bitch is bad (yeah)
Make all you hoes look sad (what?)
Her ass is fat (what?)
My ass is flat (okay)

Go bad bitch, go bad bitch, go (ah)
Go bad bitch, go bad bitch, go (what?)
Go bad bitch, go bad bitch, go (yeah)
Go bad bitch, go bad bitch, go

Go bad bitch, go bad bitch, go (ah)
Go bad bitch, go bad bitch, go (what?)
Go bad bitch, go bad bitch, go (yeah)
Go bad bitch, go bad bitch, go

And if you weren't dancin' to this
That's cause you ain't a real bad bitch
Only bad bitches can relate to real bad bitch shit
Yeah, we out
