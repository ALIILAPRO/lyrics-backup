		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm scared to be wrong 
and I don't know how to make it right 
I find out that I just dreaming over and over again

departure in an early hope
I think that I just passing by
but your eyes are beginning to shine in my sight

can I walk by your side and we run through the night
can I call the airplanes just to see you

but I don't know exactly where I must be land. It might take us apart.

so 
Am I living in the dream love that I can't deny?  
Every time I look back it’s always you and I with all the consequences of a thousand miles. 
Just you and I

Strangers always come in fast and start to ask me 'Where you're last?"
It's been a while since I'm using you as an excuse.
I'm always sitting right here, I locked the door and hit the wall
It's been a while, So how the hell can I find you?

can I chase a love that I will keep for a lifetime
can I call the airplanes just to see you

When I fit in the hopeless 
Hit me down in a broken place 
pushed me through in the empty walls 
That's the way that I can see you smile 
I’d like to pretend
To heal the scars in my soul 
it's crawling into my soul
Oh 
Who can erase the time?
Wish I can see the sign 
All the pain collapse
The way I bleed it out 
For a thousand miles 
No chance to realize
I sink in the undertow

so 
Am I living in the dream love that I can't deny?  
Every time I look back it’s always you and I with all the consequences of a thousand miles. 
Just you and I
