		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been in love for seven years and not a minute more

And I've been counting up the moments since the penny dropped

They say nothing lasts forever but we'll give a good go

And if you know me I ain't one to promise nothing for show

You make me feel like I am golden

You make me think that I'm alive under spotlight

You build me up and keep me warm

Let down my guard and now addicted to your light brown eyes

Yeah when you found me I was chasing glory

And now together we be writing stories of me and you

We'll live in wonder for the rest of our life

Until we're 99

Yeah you took me by surprise I don't believe in first sight

And I'd be lying if I told you that I knew on that night

I was searching for a reason to be left high and dry

Yeah if you left me at the wheel then we'd be curtains in time

And I'm sorry if it took me too long to figure out you

Now I'm ready for this, we're at the right place with the right amount of love

And I'll tell you more each day that I fall I can't live without you
