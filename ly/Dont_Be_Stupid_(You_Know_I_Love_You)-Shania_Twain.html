		<p>
		  Cool, yeah
Oh, oh, yeah

You're so complicated, you hang over my shoulder
When I read my mail
I don't appreciate it
When I talk to other guys
You think they're on my tail

I get so aggravated when I get off the phone
And I get the third degree
I'm really feelin' frustrated
Why don't you take a pill
And put a little trust in me
And you'll see

Don't freak out until you know the facts
Relax

Don't be stupid, you know I love you
Don't be ridiculous, you know I need you
Don't be absurd, you know I want you
Don't be impossible

I'm mad about you (I'm mad about you)
I can't live without you (I can't live without you)
I'm crazy 'bout you (I'm crazy 'bout you)
So don't be stupid, you know I love you

Stop overreacting
You even get suspicious when I paint my nails
It's definitely distracting
The way you dramatize every little small detail

Don't freak out until you know the facts
Relax, Max

Don't be stupid, you know I love you
Don't be ridiculous, you know I need you
Don't be absurd, you know I want you
Don't be impossible
I'm mad about you (I'm mad about you)
I can't live without you (can't live without you)
I'm crazy 'bout you (I'm crazy 'bout you)
Don't be stupid, you know I love you

Don't be stupid, you're my baby

I'm mad about you (I'm mad about you)
I can't live without you (I can't live without you)
I'm crazy 'bout you (I'm crazy 'bout you)
Don't be stupid, you know I love you
Don't be ridiculous, you know I need you
Don't be absurd, you know I want you
Don't be impossible, impossible oh no no no 
Don't be, don't be, don't be a baby 
Don't be particular, no no oh, don't be stupid
