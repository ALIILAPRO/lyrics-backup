		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't want to be blind
I don't want to be tied up in this pain
It's a guilt thing it's a blood drive
The final kiss how this world can rescue us

Help me, god, I can't control myself
Help me, god, I can't control myself
Help me, god, I can't control myself
Help me, god, I can't control myself

I don't want to be blind (blind)
Don't want to be vain (vain)
I don't want to be tied up in this pain
I don't want to be vile (vile)
Don't want to admit
I don't want you to treat me like shit

Help me, god, I can't control myself
Help me, god, I can't control myself
Help me, god, I can't control myself
Help me, god, I can't control myself

Taking the "one" out of "one love"
How come it feels so numb?
Taking the "two" out of "together"
Put the "N" back in "ever"

I don't want to bleed
I don't want to forget what I feel

Help me, god, I can't control myself
Help me, god, I can't control myself
Help me, god, I can't control myself
Help me, god, I can't control myself

Taking the "one" out of "one love"
How come it feels so wrong?
Taking the "two" out of "together"
Put the "N" back in "ever"

It's a guilt thing it's a blood drive

The final kiss of this world of this world

Taking the "third" out of your "act"
How come I don't react?
Taking the "four" out of "forever"
Put the "N" back in "ever"
