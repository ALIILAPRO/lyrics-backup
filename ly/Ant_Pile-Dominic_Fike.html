		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  First grade
First grade
Somebody tied you to an ant pile
Ant pile
And that wasn't even the worst day
Uh, uh
Back then you knew I always liked you
We went to high school

And on the first day
First day
You pushed me up against the brick wall
Brick wall
You pushed me up against a locker
Locker
Said let's get home before your mom does
Know what your mom does

She takes a different lover every day
She threw her wedding ring away
But you still love your mama, don't you?
Daniella, she smokes so much
Now days, sometimes the pipe, but mostly Camels
Sometime around eighth grade, remember our bodies were changing

You looked at me different
In the middle of, in the middle of
And held me like you missed me
In the middle of, in the middle of
We started to feel different
In the middle of, in the middle of
And that is when you kissed me
In the middle of, in the middle of

Ninth grade
Ninth grade
I picked you up before the first date
First date
You were allergic to your entre
You couldn't do pasta, then the movie was awful
I said let me get a redo, anywhere you want to go and you can pick it 
I can meet you like

What's the worst thing to happen next evening?
The tire burst, the fireworks in the theater
The higher ups will tell you what you can't eat
Where you can't go, how to dress, how to act decent
I've seen you fall to pieces
Seen you completely naked
There's no more ways you can surprise me

Since you looked at me different
In the middle of, in the middle of
And held me like you missed me
In the middle of, in the middle of
We started to feel different
In the middle of, in the middle of
And that was when you kissed me
In the middle of, in the middle of
