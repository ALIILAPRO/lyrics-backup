		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Something bad is coming
And we all can feel it
Why is he still lying there?

I can feel it coming
I can feel it coming
I can feel it coming

I cannot explain this 
An out-of-body experience
I am not replying

Please don't shut it down

Am I stuck in a grim dream?
My worst nightmare surrounding me
What a way to end the party

Who's the one to blame?
      
I can feel it coming
I can feel it coming

I can feel it coming
I can feel it coming
I can feel it coming
I can feel it coming
I can feel it coming
I can feel it coming
I can feel it coming
I can feel it coming

Where do they go
When they leave this earth?
Once I was told
You die for rebirth

It's coming
Oh, I feel it coming
