		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When the lights start flashing
It can open up your eyes
And the highest mountain
Is the one that you have climbed
(Yeah)

I can look for love
'Til the skies ain't blue
I can look for love
To get over you
I can look for love
For a deeper kiss
Nothing ever felt
As good as this

Staring in your eyes, I see the sun rise
There's nowhere else but right here, right now
No deeper feeling, this is the real thing
There's nowhere else but right here, right now

Oh
There's nowhere else but right here, right now
Oh
There's nowhere else but right here, right now

It's a never ending
Promise of the holy grail
But the space I'm in it feels so real
Gotta sit back and exhale
(Yeah)

I can look for love
'Til the skies ain't blue
I can look for love
To get over you
I can look for love
For a deeper kiss
Nothing ever felt
As good as this

Staring in your eyes, I see the sun rise
There's nowhere else but right here, right now
No deeper feeling, this is the real thing
There's nowhere else but right here, right now

Oh
There's nowhere else but right here, right now
Oh
There's nowhere else but right here, right now

Do it right here, right now tonight

'Cause the way that you hold me tonight
Makes me feel like there's nowhere else I'd rather be
Than right here, right now tonight
Yeah right here, right now tonight

Oh
There's nowhere else but right here, right now
Oh
There's nowhere else but right here, right now
Oh
There's nowhere else but right here, right now
