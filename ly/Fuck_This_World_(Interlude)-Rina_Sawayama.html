		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sometimes I can only see the bad side of our life
At times I let it consume my own mind, oh oh

Fuck this world, I'm leaving you
Fuck this world, I'm leaving you
Fuck this world, I'm leaving you
You, you

Fuck this world, I'm leaving you
Fuck this world, I'm leaving you
Fuck this world, I'm leaving you
You, you, you

Fuck this world, I'm leaving
Sick of what you people taking
Fuck 'em, better to be the top
Fuck this world, it's dying
'Cause you people keep on lying
No one cares, but our drip, slow down

That's why I'm comforting stars
Pouring a map for my scars
Gravity can't pull us apart
Here's to the new life on Mars
Fuck it, now let's get fucked up
Fuck this world, I'm leaving you

If I leave, then maybe I can start again
Though I hope I'm wrong, don't have a better chance
Then I look a around and see that I'm alright

This is a mission impossible
May not be solvable
May not be viable
But least we're trying
This is a mission impossible
Maybe unlovable
Maybe unstoppable
But least we're trying
