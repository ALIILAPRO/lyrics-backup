		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Friday, neon
Cold beer, got one
If only
You were lonely

Barstool, good band
All night no plans
If only
You were lonely

Yeah, if only you were lonely tonight
I could call you up, baby you just might
Take one more last chance on me
Girl, if only
You were lonely

Airplanes, Vegas
Good time just waitin'
If only
If only you were lonely

If only you were lonely right now
And I said all the right things somehow
Like baby, you still own me
If only
You were lonely

Oh, if only you were lonely enough
To let me in if I showed up
And take one more last chance on me
Oh, if only

Friday (friday), neon (neon)
Cold beer (cold beer), got one
If only
You were lonely

Barstool, good band
All night no plans
If only, only, baby
If only you were lonely
Oh, if only, baby
Oh, why ain't you lonely girl
Because I'm lonely
