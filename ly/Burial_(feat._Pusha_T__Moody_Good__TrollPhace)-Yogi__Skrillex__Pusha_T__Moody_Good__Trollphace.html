		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I came, I saw, I conquered, I balled
I came, I saw, I conquered, I balled
I came, I saw, I conquered, I balled
I came, I saw, I conquered, I balled

Hold up, this the game, it chose us
Pioneer, started on my corner like the cold crush
Had smokers linin' up the block like a gold rush
The sayin' "life fast and die young" is what they told us
The way that they mold us, perfect way that showed us
How to get money, fuck bitches off this nose dust
Showed me how to burn the block down before it slows up
Before the window of opportunity close up

I came, I saw, I conquered, I balled
I came, I saw, I conquered, I balled
Yogi said get em so I got 'em all (Yuugh!)
And turned this bitch into a burial

I came, I saw, I conquered, I balled
I came, I saw, I conquered, I balled
Yogi said get em so I got 'em all (Yuugh!)
And turned this bitch into a burial

Lookin' from the top floor, what would I stop for?
Still hear the crowd cheers, while I'm thinkin' encore
Flyin' on a Concorde, listening to Tom Ford
Frames match the song title, flyer than a Condor
Little niggas rhyme poor, poverty flows in ya
Part of beatin' hoes in, I am who you're tryin' for?
I think not - Pusha, stay hot
The coupe's got no roofs, forever they stay drop nigga

I came, I saw, I conquered, I balled
I came, I saw, I conquered, I balled
Yogi said get em so I got 'em all (Yuugh!)
And turned this bitch into a burial

I came, I saw, I conquered, I balled
I came, I saw, I conquered, I balled
Yogi said get em so I got 'em all (Yuugh!)
And turned this bitch into a burial

I came, I saw, I conquered, I balled
I came, I saw, I conquered, I balled
Yogi said get em so I got 'em all (Yuugh!)
And turned this bitch into a burial

I came, I saw, I conquered, I balled
I came, I saw, I conquered, I balled
Yogi said get em so I got 'em all (Yuugh!)
And turned this bitch into a burial
