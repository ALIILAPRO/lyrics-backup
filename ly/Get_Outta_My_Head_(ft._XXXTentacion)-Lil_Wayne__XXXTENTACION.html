		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The brains will start to abandon the religions
And believe in themselves
And the new world order will start
Drop that motherfucker

Narcissistic, insufficient, deadweight, I've been searchin' (ay)
Lack of coexistin', just don't see them work with other bitches (no)
That's when black and white
When dark at night, that's when I do my searching (ay)
And the Anti-Christ is in my mind, the evolutions lurkin' (yeah)

I got voices in my head, wild horses in my head
Runnin' around, horse playin', breakin' pots up in my head
Waking corpses in my head and they was better off dead
Runnin' forces in my head, stumpin', marchin' in my head
Sun is scorchin' in my head, Archie Bunker's in my head
Talkin' bunkers in my head, Willy Wonkahs in my head
All this junk in my head, then it sunk into my head
Little monkeys in my head, goin' bananas in my head
Shootin' cannons in my head, hittin' targets in my head
Playin' pianos in my head, keyboards and organs in my head
Smash guitars in my head, fast cars in my head
With loud ass horns in my head, horns stickin' out

I can't, I can't, get the fuck out my head
I can't, I can't, get the fuck out my head
I can't, I can't, get the fuck out my head
I can't, I can't, get the fuck out my head (yeah, yeah)
I can't (I can't), get the fuck out my head 
I can't (I can't), get the fuck out my head 
I can't (I can't), get the fuck out my head 
I can't (I can't), get the fuck out my head 

All these voices in my head, they're commitin' arson in my head
Real wars up in my head, crash courses in my head
Fightin' forces in my head, white noises soundin' red
All these voices in my head, all these thoughts up in my head
Like a spark plug in my head, like a torch up in my head
Ain't no shotguns in my head, all these sharks up in my head
All these sharks need to be fed (yeah)

I behead a motherfucker for his contacts
Take the body where the others can't see
Seen the devil in my eyes without no contacts
So my eyes are blacker than the bottom of the sea, yeah, yeah

I can't, I can't, get the fuck out my head
(The brains will start to abandon the religions)
I can't, I can't, get the fuck out my head
(And believe in themselves)
I can't, I can't, get the fuck out my head
(And the new world order will start)
I can't, I can't, get the fuck out my head (yeah, yeah)
I can't (I can't), get the fuck out my head 
I can't (I can't), get the fuck out my head 
I can't (I can't), get the fuck out my head 
I can't (I can't), get the fuck out my head
