		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I really can't stay (Baby, it's cold outside)
I've got to go 'way (Baby, it's cold outside)
This evening has been (Hoping that you'd drop in)
So very nice (I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice)

My mother will start to worry (Beautiful what's your hurry)
My father will be pacing the floor (Listen to the fireplace roar)
So really I'd better scurry (Beautiful, please don't hurry)
But maybe just a half a drink more (I put some records on while I pour)

The neighbors might think (Baby, it's bad out there)
Say, what's in this drink? (No cabs to be had out there)
I wish I knew how to break the spell (Your eyes are like starlight now)
(I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell)

I ought to say no, no, no sir (Mind if I move in closer?)
At least I'm gonna say that I tried (What's the sense of hurtin' my pride?)
I really can't stay (Oh, baby, don't hold out)
Baby, it's cold outside 

I simply must go (Baby, it's cold outside)
The answer is no (baby, it's cold outside)
This welcome has been so nice and warm (How lucky that you dropped in)
(Look out that window at that storm)

My sister will be suspicious (Gosh, your lips look delicious)
My brother will be there at the door (Waves upon a tropical shore)
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious (Gosh, your lips are delicious)
Oh, maybe just a kiss more (Never such a blizzard before)

I've got to get home (Baby, you'll freeze out there)
Say, lend me your coat (It's up to your knees out there)
You've really been grand but don't you see (I'm thrilled when you touch my hand)
(How can you do this thing to me?)

There's bound to be talk tomorrow (Think of my lifelong sorrow)
At least there will be plenty implied (If you caught pneumonia and died)
I really can't stay (Can't get over that hold out)
Baby, it's cold, baby, it's cold outside
