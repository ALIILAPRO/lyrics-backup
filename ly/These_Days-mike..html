		<p>
		  Hell nah I ain't sleep today but I'ma be okay
Miss my family on the east, but fuck it I can't leave L.A.
Every meeting that I be in, trust me I just lead the way
I fucked three times before 3 today, piece of cake
Never gave a fuck 'bout what the teachers say, cause either way
I'ma just do me, and she said me too, I said "s'il vous plait"
Walking out the club with me and TMZ is out here
Ain't no secret safe
If that's your girl, why's she in my section?
If that's your girl, why's she doing role play
Going both ways like an intersection?
Stole her like an interception
But you can have her back she asks a million questions

Like, like, what's next, what's that, what's up
I just wanna chill, drink, smoke, fuck
'Cause god damn that body's goals as fuck
Somehow you hot as hell but still cold as fuck
You know the deal, you know what's up
You ain't the only one, you knew that

Yeah, everything I see up in my head just comes to life
Got my favorite girl waking up in my bed, it's only right
Bad bitch my only type, independent too, get it boo
Just promise me you won't let all the bullshit they say get to you
You a 10, I'm not perfect but for you I do pretend
I've been working 2 to 10, that's AM
Ain't nobody quite like him, put in the time like him
I've been grinding for a while now it's feeling like my time is finally here
That's ideal, that's ideal, that's ideal, like

Like, what's next, what's that, what's up
I just wanna chill, drink, smoke, fuck
Yeah, 'cause god damn that body goals as fuck
Somehow you hot as hell but still cold as fuck
You know the deal, you know what's up
You ain't the only one, you knew that

I've been doing great I guess I can't complain
I don't think about yesterday
Every move is calculated, this shit ain't no guessing game
Only time I'm second place is when I'm at my second place
Made 300 then doubled that, I guess you call that 2nd base
How many come ups until it's destiny, yeah
How many come ups until it's meant to be, yeah
I hear them talking, that don't get to me
That ain't shit to me, same dude, different dream
This is me (this is me)

Nothing pretty but her face
Money hungry, nothing skinny but her waist, uh
She come from money, but she spent it on her titties and her face, oh
If you really wanna know, these women, man they come and go, ayy
'Cause one minute she's the one, the next you really never know, ayy, ayy
'Cause she don't know a damn thing about love
She don't know a damn thing at all
'Cause one minute she's the one
The next you really never know (you just never know)

Girls these days
Like, what's next, what's that, what's up
I just wanna chill, drink, smoke, fuck
'Cause god damn that body goals as fuck
Somehow you hot as hell but still cold as fuck
You know the deal, you know what's up
You ain't the only one

Girls these days
These days
You ready
These days
You ready
These days
You ready
Girls these days
Girls these days
These days
