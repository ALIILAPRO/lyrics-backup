		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She sold her love to a modern man
Good solid currency's the hardest to land
All of that money helps you cover your ass
Don't let the ladyfinger blow in your hands

Did it all
For that dollar
She's a star tonight
Without warning
She gave up the ghost inside

Just like a whiskey bottle drained on the floor
She got no future, just a life to endure
This good Samaritan is shakin' her hand
Too late to leave here now the songs in the can

Give it up
For that dollar
She's a star tonight
Without warning
She gave up the ghost inside

You call it chivalry
Never pull a punch for free
You ever wonder why they had to move on?
This phony honor code
That put you on your throne
A double standard you invoke when you want

For that dollar
She's a star tonight
Without warning
She gave up the ghost inside

Was it all for show?
Don't turn into one of them
Turning another page
Trust me darling
I'm carving 'em up through the dust in your town
Crawling over rubble
Just to serve you
Tend to wonder why
