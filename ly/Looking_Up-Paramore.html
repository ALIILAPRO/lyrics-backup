		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Things are looking up, oh, finally
I thought I'd never see the day
When you smile at me
We always pull through, oh, when we try
I'm always wrong but you're never right
Oh, you're never right

Honestly, can you believe
We crossed the world while it's asleep?
I'd never trade it in, 'cause I've always wanted this
And it's not a dream anymore
No, it's not a dream anymore
It's worth fighting for

Could have given up so easily
I was a few cheap shots away from the end of me
Taken for granted, almost everything that I would have died for
Just yesterday
Just yesterday

Honestly, can you believe
We crossed the world while it's asleep?
I'd never trade it in, 'cause I've always wanted this
And, it's not a dream anymore
No, it's not a dream anymore
It's worth fighting for

God knows the world doesn't need another band, whoa, whoa
But what a waste it would've been, whoa, whoa
I can't believe we almost hung it up, whoa, whoa
We're just getting started, whoa, whoa

Honestly, can you believe
We crossed the world while it's asleep?
I'd never trade it in, 'cause I've always wanted this
And it's not a dream anymore
No, it's not a dream anymore
No, it's not a dream anymore
No, it's not a dream anymore
It's worth fighting for

I can't believe we almost hung it up whoa, whoa
We're just getting started, whoa, whoa
I can't believe we almost hung it up, whoa, whoa
We're just getting started
Yeah, we're just getting started
