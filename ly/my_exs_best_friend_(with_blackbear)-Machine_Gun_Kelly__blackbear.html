		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ayy
You know my ex
So that makes it all feel complicated, yeah
(It all seems complicated)
I read those texts
That you sent to yours but I'll never say it, yeah
(I'll never say)

You walked in my life at 2 AM
'Cause my boy's new girl is your best friend
Act like you don't see me, we'll play pretend
Your eyes already told me what you never said

Now we're in the back seat of the black car going home
When she asked me, "Is it wrong if I come up with you?"
We're both drunk on the elevator
When I kissed you for the first time in New York City, uh

I swear to God, I never fall in love
Then you showed up and I can't get enough of it
I swear to God, I never fall in love
I never fall in love but I can't get enough of it

First off, I'm not sorry
I won't apologize to nobody
You play like I'm invisible
Girl, don't act like you ain't saw me
Last year was a mess and how I acted was beyond me
But the past still revolves me
You text me, I ain't responding
But now shit's done changed
Go our separate ways
But look at this damage you did to me
I still want nothin' to do between you and me
Please, don't say nothing at all, sounds so true to me
We don't have nothing to say, hey

I swear to God, I never fall in love
Then you showed up and I can't get enough of it
I swear to God, I never fall in love
I never fall in love but I can't get enough of it
I swear to God, I never fall in love
Then you showed up and I can't get enough of it
I swear to God, I never fall in love
I never fall in love but I can't get enough of it

You know my ex
So that makes it all feel complicated, yeah
(It all seems complicated)
I read those texts
That you sent to yours but I'll never say it, yeah
(I'll never say)
