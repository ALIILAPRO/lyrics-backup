		<p>
		  Oh

Switch the light off
Welcome to the night
What's the problem?
Not gonna make it right
Bite the bullet then pull the trigger
Hold tight
It's a feeling you know
言葉を飲み込んだ君の
何かを訴える目つきは
例えれないくらい 冷たいの
I take, take, take, take it for no one

But I don't know what to call it (call it)
When I know I don't care anymore
いたずらに過ぎ去ってた昨日 (you should know that)
Cry out
Will you tell me now?
So we say we want change and never be the same and yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Cry out
Oh, I'm burning out
Can't you hear the sound?

すべてが裏腹な僕の
弱みをつかもうとしても
さらに固く閉ざして見せるの
I don't take shit off of no one
それでも強引な君は
何かをチラつかせて見せて
あたかも平然を装うの
I take, take, take, take it for no one

But I don't know what to call it (call it)
When I know I don't care anymore
In the end I know we'll all be gone (you and I will be alright)
Cry out
Will you tell me now?
So we say we want change and never be the same and yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Cry out
Oh I'm burning out
Can't you hear the sound?

One by one
It's taking apart
It's taking a part of me

Can't you hear the voices screaming?
Out loud to me I feel it
We can be the change we needed
Shout it out now
Shout it out now
Can't you hear the voices screaming?
Out loud to me I feel it
We can be the change we needed
Shout it out now
Shout it out now
Oh

Cry out
Will you tell me now
So we say we want change and never be the same
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Cry out
Oh, I'm burning out
Can't you hear the sound?
(Voices all around)
Can't you hear the sound?
('Cause we're going down)
(Voices all around)
('Cause we're going down)
