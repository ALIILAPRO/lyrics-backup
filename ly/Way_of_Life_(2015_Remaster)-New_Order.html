		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You told me about yourself,
How you once lived with someone else
The way of life that you had tried
The way they hurt you deep inside
That's the only thing about it
I can't find anyone to doubt it
That's the only thing about it
I can't find anyone to doubt it
Who do you think you're talking to?
When I look at you I know you're lying
All you say and do
Seems to fall apart and leave you crying

But I thought I could've seen you here today
But you leave me standing each and every way
You told me a pack of lies
That I can't even reason with
Failure of your moral code
The kind of things that I can't give
That's the only thing about it
I can't find anyone to doubt it
That's the only thing about it
I can't find anyone to doubt it
Who do you think you're talking to?
When I look at you I know you're lying
All you say and do
Seems to fall apart and leave you crying

Who do you think you're talking to?
When I look at you I know you're lying
All you say and do
Seems to fall apart and leave you crying
