		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know I should have never gone to sleep
My feet won't run too far ahead of me
And so it shows, honestly
Sometimes you're standing there right next to me
 
Don't wait, too late, bye now, keep faith
Too grey, high rate, it's a good day, a good day
Don't wait, too late, bye now, keep faith
Too grey, high rate, a good day, it's a good day
Don't wait, too late, bye now, keep faith
Too grey, high rate, it's a good day, a good day
Don't wait, too late, bye now, keep faith
Too grey, high rate, a good day, it's a good day
 
Sometimes you're standing there right next to me

Sometimes you're standing there right next to me
 
Don't wait, too late, bye now, keep faith
Too grey, high rate, it's a good day, a good day
Don't wait, too late, bye now, keep faith
Too grey, high rate, a good day, it's a good day
Don't wait, too late, bye now, keep faith
Too grey, high rate, it's a good day, a good day
Don't wait, too late, bye now, keep faith
Too grey, high rate, a good day, it's a good day
 
Don't wait, too late, bye now, keep faith
Too grey, high rate, it's a good day, a good day
Don't wait, too late, bye now, keep faith
Too grey, high rate, a good day, it's a good day
Don't wait, too late, bye now, keep faith
Too grey, high rate, it's a good day, a good day
Don't wait, too late, bye now, keep faith
Too grey, high rate, a good day, it's a good day
