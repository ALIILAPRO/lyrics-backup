		  Chorus:
Let's have a party, connect me to somebody
let's have a party, connect me to somebody
555 on line

Being the man that I am
And the click that I got
I wish I was a little bit more like super cop
It's a frenzy my friends be
Like Benz's to Bentley
This bad boy not bad
So why don't you comprend√©
I got your number
Don't you think it's time we hook it up (yeah)
I'm all alone
Ain't no mums in my area
Can't go to your place
Cos your mum's hysteria
You want to bring some of your friends
The more the merrier

Bridge:
You got my number on your dial
I'm waiting just to come around
Anytime, anywhere
Whatever's clever, mini skirts, high shoes and leather
Tonight's the night
Do me right, turn me on

Now michelle got the body
Julie got the back
Lisa got the energy
To help me stay on track

Chorus

I'm not talking about the ladies
That loves to lead you on
Say they got your number
But they never ever call
Like Eva the honey dip
Now I don't even wanna trip
Gave her my number
Her man gave me the fat lip
Now I don't bother calling anybody anymore
Sipping the finest
Chauffeur driven and I'm getting calls
555 ladies loves the cool Jay
No Mr Smith in this baby
Come and get the real thing

Bridge

Now michelle got the body
Julie got the back
Lisa got the energy
To help me stay on track

Chorus

Now I got digital and optical
I'm even on the net
I got mmm, ah, oh, I forget
Cos nothing in this world
Like some sexual feeling
Toss it up baby
I'm ready willing receiving
Message understood
Loud and clear I'll be there
You got my number on your dial
Anytime anywhere
Whatever's clever mini skirts
High shoes or leather
Tonight's the night baby
Got to get some mo wetter

Girl you look so fine
Just call me anytime
You're tryin to make me crazy
Can't get you out of my mind
(x3)
