		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You look so beautiful right now
Eyes full of light and I don't know how
(How we didn't make this work)
(I can see you're happier)

We pretend like it's nothing at all
'Til we're mixing our words with some alcohol
Scared of feelings we can't hide
Knowing that you can't be mine

Speaking through glances
So he doesn't notice
I hope that he treats you well
My thoughts are better
If they're left unspoken
Keeping 'em to myself

Wish we could stay
Stuck in time
Dancing in the dead of the night
Sweet escape
I hold on tight

To shades of gray
Between the lines
Yeah, that's all we've ever known
It's okay, yeah, it's all right
We're forever undefined

This is our happiest ending
So I guess we'll go on pretending
(That I'm not in your heart)
(We'll never get past this part)

I'm speaking through glances
So he doesn't notice
I hope that he treats you well
My thoughts are better
If they're left unspoken
Keeping 'em to myself

Wish we could stay
Stuck in time
Dancing in the dead of the night
Sweet escape
I hold on tight

To shades of gray
Between the lines
Yeah, that's all we've ever known
It's okay, yeah, it's all right
We're forever undefined

Wish we could stay
Stuck in time
Dancing in the dead of the night

To shades of gray
Between the lines
Yeah, that's all we've ever known
We're forever undefined
