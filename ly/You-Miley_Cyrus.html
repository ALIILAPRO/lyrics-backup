		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wanna set off alarms, deal out the cards
Smoke cuban cigars and get kicked out of bars before two
But only if it's with you
I wanna drive down to Texas, flip off my exes
Get kind of reckless and have wild, wild, wild sex under the moon
But only if it's with you

I got some baggage, let's do some damage
I am not made for no horsey and carriage
You know I'm savage, but you're lookin' past it
I want that late-night sweet magic, that forever-lastin' love
But only if it's with you

Let's crash a wedding tonight, get drunk by the lights
Then I'll pick a fight to make up on the floor of your room
But only if it's with you
I wanna cut off my hair and kick off my boots
Dance in the wind just to do it again, oh, it's true
But only if it's with you, oh

I got some baggage, let's do some damage
I am not made for no horsey and carriage
You know I'm savage, but you're lookin' past it
I want that late-night sweet magic, that forever-lastin'
I'm kinda crazy 'cause that's how you make me
I don't need Jesus, 'cause baby, you saved me, I'm done
But only if it's with you, oh

You, only with you
You, only with you, yeah
You, only with you
You, only with you
