		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm addicted to bad decisions
I just can't ever help myself
But this is different
It sounds so convincing
She's good for you, so good for us as well
You'd be the taste lingering on my lips
It'd be my hands clinging to your hips

I gotta get, get, get it out
Gotta get me out
Find the flaws, find the switch, just shut it down
Would it matter if you couldn't go back?
But you never even thought to ask
So I think if you would
Then I think that you should

Remember, remember, remember
(The blameless are not honest here)
You've done this all to get her
(If you take this slow then she won't know)
Remember the imposters and pretenders
(The blameless are not modest here)
Could never have done this to get her
So go get her!

Is it possible to forget your name?
The identity running through your veins
Was it worth these ends, to play this part?
I never thought I could get this far
Abandon the old and bring in the new
But a sinking ship drowns every person here
Including you
And you tell yourself you were wrong when it hurts
But the unoriginal you would have never worked

Oh, you're the lucky one

It's gonna show when the stains bleed through
She's gonna know this was never you
Gotta get, get, get it out
Gotta get me out
Just can't seem to shut, shut, shut it down
But the stains stay the same and just reappear
But I can keep this up all night for you dear
Gotta get, get, get me out
Gotta get it out
Find the flaws, find the switch, just shut it down

Remember, remember, remember
(The blameless are not honest here)
You've done this all to get her
So go get her!

Is it possible to forget your name?
The identity running through your veins
Was it worth these ends, to play this part?
I never thought I could get this far
Abandon the old and bring in the new
But a sinking ship drowns every person here
Including you
And you tell yourself it was wrong when it hurts
But the unoriginal you would have never worked

Oh you're the lucky one
You're the lucky one
Someone would love you so much
That they'd come undone
Oh you're the lucky one

I'm addicted to bad decisions
I just can't ever help myself
Always thought I could fix the edges
But I'm torn and there's nothing left
I just can't stand the thought of you this way
So I said the things I thought would make you stay
But I was wrong, I was wrong, I was wrong

Is it possible to forget your name?
The identity running through your veins
Was it worth these ends, to play this part?
I never thought I could get this far
Abandon the old and bring in the new
But a sinking ship drowns every person here
Including you
And you tell yourself you were wrong when it hurts
But the unoriginal you would have never worked
You're so unoriginal, it would have never worked
