		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I saw the sun in his eyes
My baby kissed me goodbye He smelled of roses I cried When my
My baby kissed me goodbye
You know
I loved him
He left me
I loved him when he left me Man oh man he was pretty His smile made boys so envy
Drove away from my city
Was waving from his chevy Will I ever forget it
Now he's buried in my fantasy
And I don't wanna know Where we two
Could have gone
Now he's buried in my fantasy In my fantasy
He saw the world I felt the pain I feel it still, in summer rain Oceans still blue
It's all the same
Where is he now So far away?
You know
I loved him
He left me
I loved him when he left me Man oh man he was pretty His smile made boys so envy
In My Fantasy (Lyrics)
Drove away from my city
Was waving from his chevy Will I ever forget it
Now he's buried in my fantasy
And I don't wanna know Where we two
Could have gone
Now he's buried in my fantasy In my fantasy
My baby
Only said Goodbye
And he kissed me When I cried
Oh that moment was so wild
My baby
Never heard a word
And the memory still burns Now he's buried in my fantasy
In my my fantasy
