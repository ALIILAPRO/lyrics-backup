		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What's wrong with me?
Is there somebody else inside my head
That doesn't want me to be happy?
I know my rights, I live until I die
I've got this bed, each night I go to sleep and dream
I'm swimmin' in the deep end
You're my buoy and I'm sinkin'
Life flies by me but I'm thinkin'
You saved my life and now

I'm happy
'Cause finally I feel I got it all
Started out with nothing at all
And even when I might fall down
I know my luck come back around

They tellin' me that I should love myself
Sometimes I fail, but then you hit me like a whiplash
Yellin' in my corner
She's a wild one, yes, I should warn ya
Life flies by me every morning
You saved my life and now

I'm happy
'Cause finally, I feel I got it all
Started out with nothing at all
And even when I might fall down
I know my luck come back around

They tell me to write a paragraph of everything, I
Love about me
Write a paragraph and send it in the mail
To a future me, that's trying desperately
To start a family
Teach them to love themselves
Teach them to love themselves
Teach them to love themselves

I'm happy
'Cause finally I feel I got it all
Started out with nothing at all
And even when I might fall down
I know my luck come back around

I'm happy
'Cause finally I feel I got it all
Started out with nothing at all
And even when I might fall down
I know my luck come back around

(Happy, happy, happy, happy)
(Happy, happy, happy, happy)
(Ha)
