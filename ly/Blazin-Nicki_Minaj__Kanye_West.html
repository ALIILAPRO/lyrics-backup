		<p>
		  I fly, I fly high, I'm blazin',
I'm blazin', feels like I'm blazin'
I fly, I fly high, I'm blazin'
I'm blazin', feels like I'm blazin'

Feels like I'm bl'

How could it me, little me
Had the power to be the best B, in the league
Yeah inevitably, but could it be little me
You was heckling me, now it's monotony when I regularly, yo
I catch wreck on recreation, so I exceed all your expectations
Bitches ain't got it in 'em, I kill 'em and then I skin 'em
The contract was signed but I am the addendum
So wh-where my dogs at, Randy
Ma-ma-matter fact, get off my dick bitch, Andy
Ca-ca-ca-'cause everything is fine and dandy
Go against me now, I dare you, Bambi
Half a million dollars just to upgrade the car show
I ain't even detonate the bombs and the arsenal
Before the storm comes the calm
Hope you can take the heat like LeBron
Ah, ha ha ha ha ha ha
I'm the best now
Anybody with some money should invest now
Soccer moms need to organize a pep rall'
You game over bitch, Gatorade, wet towel
Motherfuckers ain't ready, they never been
As long as I am in the game, you'll never win
I'm on that different type of high, heroin
Put on my cape and hit the sky, heroine

I fly, I fly high, I'm blazin'
I'm blazin', feels like I'm blazin'
I fly, I fly high, I'm blazin'
I'm blazin', feels like I'm blazin'

I fly, I fly high, I'm blazin'
I'm blazin', feels like I'm blazin'
I fly, I fly high, I'm blazin'
I'm blazin', feels like I'm blazin' (uh)

Yeah, ugh this is the moment grab your Kodak
While I'm flying with a flow that
Is the greatest throwback
Since that Nolan Ryan and the days
Been crazy and the nights even wilder
And the lights even brighter
Baby, stand next to my fire
Only higher is Messiah
Or notes from Mariah
'Rari six hundred horses
That's my chariot of fire
Where we flying,
They can't find us all them broke days behind us
I just took your whole life and redesigned it, uh
I think I'm Marc Jacobs, I think I'm Lagerfeld
I think without makeup, you still bad as hell
I'ma grab your waist then
I'ma grab your face and
Then I'ma taste it
Then I'ma blaze it
Hello all my bad girls
This just in
Yeezy hurt the beat
Like he fucked her best friend
And she let him back in
And he just did it again
He crazy, he blazin', he off the deep end
I'm blazin', I'm flagrant, I'm crazy, I'm saying
Too much for the world so they a-bbreviate him
His tatts is her fav', his stats is amaze
Her dress is just per' uh
Prada colored babes
It obvi' we the ish
And I'm rolling with my bricks
So real you so trill, baby, everything legit
How you feel, they say we crazed
'Cause our styles so diff'
They be jail when we in the mag looking magnif'
As if I ain't used Magnums on your favorite bad bitch
Fuck these background niggas I was tryna adlib
Add this, we blazin'
Nicki, what you think?
I got two White Russians but we also need some drinks (hahaha)

I fly, I fly high, I'm blazin'
I'm blazin', feels like I'm blazin'
I fly, I fly high, I'm blazin'
I'm blazin', feels like I'm blazin'

I fly, I fly high, I'm blazin'
I'm blazin', feels like I'm blazin'
I fly, I fly high, I'm blazin'
I'm blazin', feels like I'm blazin'

It feels like I'm blazin', blazin', blazin', blazin'

It feels like I'm blazin', blazin', blazin', blazin'

It feels like I'm blazin', blazin', blazin', blazin'

It feels like I'm blazin', blazin', blazin', blazin'

It feels like I'm blazin', blazin', blazin'

It feels like I'm blazin', blazin', blazin'

It feels like I'm blazin', blazin', blazin'

It feels like I'm blazin', blazin', blazin'

I fly, I fly high, I'm blazin'
I'm blazin', feels like I'm blazin'
I fly, I fly high, I'm blazin'
I'm blazin', feels like I'm blazin'

I fly, I fly high, I'm blazin'
I'm blazin', feels like I'm blazin'
I fly, I fly high, I'm blazin'
I'm blazin', feels like I'm blazin'
