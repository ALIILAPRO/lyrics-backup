		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Distant
What faint red glow surrounds me
Hold this
Your hand in mine
What a shame to see your immortality
Not a blessing but a padded curse
It stings the pain they came and tore it all from me
But the doubts tight clasp to my throat feels worse
Gone
My only light is gone
But through the shade I saw

A path
left by the lights reflecting cry
Is it meant to guide me
Or just a subtle soft goodbye
I can hear black sands
From the desert you called home
But time it keeps reminding me
How far away i am
From the moons lost glow

Bloom
Carried again
Was the first scent of you
That reminds me to circumvent
Consumed
Vision of an end
Where I'm still holding to
That promise cut into our hands
Higher
Blame myself for this one
Lose the shame then
I'll die
In place of my reclusion
Without you I can not feel
The time I seized is gone
Set back on the seal
Claws running through my breath have withdrawn
But It's not my voice they're out steal
Again I'm reminded
Just how much I've lost

A path
left by the lights reflecting cry
Is it meant to guide me
Or just a subtle soft goodbye
I can hear black sands
From the desert you called home
But time it keeps reminding me
How far away I am
From the moons lost

The lense
I can see the field surrounding
Foot steps left harbouring your seeds
What's left caught me confounding
Your voice
Calling me
Through the lense
I can see you holding what's mine
At first we're stuttering
Just to find that realization
What's killing me
Is keeping you alive
Can't shake what time has burned in our atmosphere
The wait
Is killing me
But keeping you alive
My moons lost glow
Can't stand
In the sand it's faking out my breathing
My only
Please sense me
My moons lost glow
Such a warm bright light surrounds her
Her hand in mine
