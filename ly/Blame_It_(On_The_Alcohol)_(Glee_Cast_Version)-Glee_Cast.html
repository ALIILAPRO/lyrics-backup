		  Blame it on the Goose, got you feeling loose
Blame it on the 'Tron, got you in the zone
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol
(Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol)

Ayy, she say she usually don't
But I know that she front
'Cause shawty know what she want
But she don't wanna seem like she's easy

I ain't saying what you won't do
But you know we probably gonna do
What you been feelin' deep
(Insi-i-ide, don't li-i-ie now)

Boy what you drinking?
Gon' let sink in
Here for the weekend
Thinking we can

See where we can be if we press fast forward (ooh)
Just one more round and you're down, I know it (ooh yeah, yeah)

Fill another cup up
Feeling on your butt what?
You don't even care now
I was unaware how

Fine you was before my buzz set in (my buzz set in)

Blame it on the Goose, got you feeling loose
Blame it on the 'Tron, got you in the zone
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the vodka (hey)
Blame it on the Henny (hey)
Blame it on the blue top (hey)
Got you feeling dizzy (hey)
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol

Ooh, see
She spilled some drink on me (on me)
And now I'm knowing she's tipsy (tipsy)
She put her body on me
And she keep staring me right in my eyes
No telling what I'm gon' do (gon' do)
Baby I would rather show you (show you)
What you been missing in your
Li-i-i-ife when I get insi-i-i-ide

Boy what you drinking?
(Gon' let sink in)
Here for the weekend
(Thinking we can)

See where we can be if we press fast forward (oh)
Just one more round and you're down I know it (ooh)

Fill another cup up
(Feeling on your butt what?)
You don't even care now
I was unaware how

Fine you was before my buzz set in (my buzz set in)

Blame it on the Goose, (blame it on the Goose) got you feeling loose
Blame it on the 'Tron, got you in the zone (alcohol)
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol (alcohol)
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol (alcohol)
Blame it on the vodka (hey)
Blame it on the Henny (hey)
Blame it on the blue top (yeah)
Got you feeling dizzy (alcohol, woo)
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol

Now to the ballas poppin' bottles
With their Henny in their cup
Screaming money ain't a thing
If you ain't throw it up

In the sky (in the sky)
And hold your drinks up high (up high)

To my independent mamas
Who can buy their own bottles
If you looking like a model
When them broke fellas holla

Tell them bye (buh-bye)
And hold your drinks up high (high)

Blame it on the Goose, got you feeling loose
Blame it on the 'Tron, got you in the zone
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol (alcohol)
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol (alcohol)
Blame it on the vodka (hey)
Blame it on the Henny (hey)

Blame it on the blue top (hey)
Got you feeling dizzy (hey)

Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol

Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol
