		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't know why I'm attached to all of my doubts
and I don't know why I'm too rough on myself 
You seem to float several inches above the ground
and you move always as if to music

Love me till my legs can't move
and I'll sing till my face turns blue

I know it's only love
but I'll never get enough 
I know it's only love
but I'll never get enough 

And I don't wanna fuck it up
And I don't wanna fuck it up

There is a promise of magic in your smile
you've got tropical eyes, paradise 
We sat and talked about our real fears
my heart it was imitating earthquakes 

Love me till my legs can't move
and I'll sing till my face turns blue

I know it's only love
but I'll never get enough 
I know it's only love
but I'll never get enough 

And I don't wanna fuck it up
And I don't wanna fuck it up

I know it's only love
but I'll never get enough
