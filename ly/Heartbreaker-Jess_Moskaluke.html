		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Smoke in the air
Half empty bar, you and me in the dark
Little truth, little dare
Baby I gotta ask why are you holding back

You say you want me but you don't wanna get burned
She did you dirty but you know that I'm not her

I ain't that kiss against the wall on a Friday night 
Only time I ever call's in the last call lights
Playing love hot and cold, keeping you on the line
Just to say goodbye
I ain't your heartbreaker 
I ain't some game player
Ain't just the flavour of the week and then I'll see ya later
I'll be your soul shaker but
I ain't your heartbreaker 

I say what I mean
And I mean what I say when I say that I'll stay

She broke you into pieces, boy I can fix that
I'll give you all of me and never take it back

I ain't that kiss against the wall on a Friday night 
Only time I ever call's in the last call lights
Playing love hot and cold, keeping you on the line
Just to say goodbye
I ain't your heartbreaker 
I ain't some game player
Ain't just the flavour of the week and then I'll see ya later
I'll be your soul shaker but
I ain't your heartbreaker 

I feel us falling into something
If you're jumping then I'm jumping
Why you running when you should be running to me
I ain't your heartbreaker
I ain't your heartbreaker

I ain't that kiss against the wall on a Friday night 
Only time I ever call's in the last call lights
Playing love hot and cold, keeping you on the line
Just to say goodbye
I ain't your heartbreaker 
I ain't some game player
Ain't just the flavour of the week and then I'll see ya later
I'll be your soul shaker but
I ain't your heartbreaker
