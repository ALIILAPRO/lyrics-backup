		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everywhere you go
Lights flash
All you got to have
Is the cash

While you think you're able
It's got to have a label
Designer music
Designer music

I don't even know
What it means
Stick it on your shoes
Or your jeans

If Calvin says it's smashin'
It's got to be in fashion
Designer music
Designer music
Designer music
Designer music

Following the crowd
It's their game
Everything depends
On which name

It's got to be designer
There could be no finer
Designer music
Designer music

Wearing your Sassons
Stop the show
Got to be in Vogue
With Polo

Stick it on your sweater
It's got to make it better
Designer music
Designer music

Everywhere you go
Lights flash
All you got to have
Is the cash

While you think you're able
It's got to have a label
Designer music
Designer music

I don't even know
What it means
Stick it on your shoes
Or your jeans

If Calvin says it's smashin'
It's got to be in fashion
Designer music
Designer music
