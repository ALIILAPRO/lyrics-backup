		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Super animation, turning on a nation
And they're saying all moving parts stand still
Since he was elected, adrenalin injected
Hear him saying all moving parts should kill
Just like the hero, he's got them all on the run
Yes, he's won, yeah, yeah

Since he passed the motion, they're building in the ocean
And he's saying all men should all be free
What a combination, peace and radiation
And he's saying free men should fight for me
Just like his momma, he seems to get his pleasure from pain,
And the rain, ain't that strange?
Very strange, yeah

I like choking toys
You've got to see me before you meet the boys
Teacher's burnt the school
He's had enough of sticking to the rules, alright

People stop and see
He's got to be more decadent than me
Just to pass the time
He gets his kicks from licking off the wine

Pretty silly ladies, all Cynthias and Sadies
Call him and up and he takes their numbers down
Says he is a woman, should have seen it coming
And she's sayin' she's married to a clown
Just like a lady, she'll keep you guessing through the night
Not tonight, well, I might
Oh, alright, yeah
