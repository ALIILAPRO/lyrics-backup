		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now squeal
As best as you can
Hooked by the cheek
Slaughter, meet the lamb
Wandered off the beaten path
Now it all goes south from here
Cut off from everyone
Scream til you tear through your fucking lungs
Run
The hunt begins for fresh meat
Wanna know what we think of southern hospitality?
Just smell our guests on our breath
Lovely stench of tasty death
Noble sacrifice to keep our family fed
Choking on a spit
Alive and spinning til you vomit
That's where you belong in our hell that we call home
Cadaver County
I wouldn't call for the law, they're out the fridge to thaw
Cadaver County
This is where prayers come to die
Sweating bullets when there's no guns in sight
Your faith in salvo for salvation fuels our saws with salivation
With god we're lost
In blood we lust
Welcome to our farm, bitch
Cattle in shackles
A sheep in human skin
Cadaver County
I wouldn't call for the law, they're out the fridge to thaw
Cadaver County
This is where prayers come to die
Scream for mother
You're just another word in the morning paper
