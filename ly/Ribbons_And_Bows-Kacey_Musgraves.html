Hey, everybody
Thank you so much for watching the show
This has been so much fun
Have a wonderful new year, happy holidays

Don't need ribbons and bows 
To cure my woes
No, I just need your love
Expensive rings or diamond things
No, I just need your love

Don't get me wrong, a shiny new Mercedes 
Would look nice in my driveway
Or a roundtrip ticket for a long vacation 
On a big fancy jet plane

There's only one thing that I want
Baby, it's hard to find 
And it's already mine, yeah

I don't need ribbons and bows 
To cure my woes
No, I just need your love
Expensive rings or diamond things
No, I just need your love
No, I don't need much under the tree
Oh, but you can wrap me up
In ribbons and bows 
To cure my woes
'Cause I just need your love

All the ladies down at the hair salon 
Are gonna brag about what they got
They'll walk in drippin' in their bobbles 
And trinkets and their whosits and whatnots

There's only one thing that I want
Baby, it's hard to find 
And it's already mine

Don't need ribbons and bows 
To cure my woes
No, I just need your love
Expensive rings or diamond things
No, I just need your love
No, I don't need much under the tree
Oh, but you can wrap me up
In ribbons and bows 
To cure my woes
'Cause I just need your love

Oh, I, I, I 
Just need your love
I, I, I 
Just need your love

Don't need ribbons and bows 
To cure my woes
No, I just need your love
Expensive rings or diamond things
No, I just need your love
No, I don't need much under the tree
Oh, but you can wrap me up
In ribbons and bows 
To cure my woes
'Cause I just need your love, yeah

Just need your love
Just need your love
