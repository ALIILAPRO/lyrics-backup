		  Eyo
Co-pilot, co-pilot, co-pilot

We can go where you wanna go
We just gotta fuel it up
Try catching us if you can
This flight ain't about to stop, no

There's no need to buckle up on this joyride
Please leave your seat back up, push it upright
Come join this eerie island way of life

We're going up up up till the stars are below
I'm gonna take this club to the city of love
Come, we're gonna go flying
Oh I may need a co-pilot
Baby be my co-pilot

With every puff puff puff, girl the higher you go
Out on the dance floor, anything is possible
Come, we're gonna go flying
Oh I may need a co-pilot
Baby be my co-pilot

We can be who we wanna be
When we took it to the top
You can be my wingman
Chilling in the mile high club, oh oh

Baby, there's no need to buckle up on this joyride
Please leave your seat back up, push it upright
Come join this eerie island way of life, woah

Because we're going up up up till the stars are below
I'm gonna take this club to the city of love
Come, we're gonna go flying
Oh I may need a co-pilot
Let me be your co-pilot

With every puff puff puff, girl the higher you go
Out on the dance floor, anything is possible
Come, we're gonna go flying
Oh I may need a co-pilot
I can be your co-pilot

Eyo
Co-pilot, co-pilot, co-pilot
Eyo
Co-pilot, co-pilot, co-pilot

'Cause we do it like this and we never gon' quit
Well, after the DJ and the pretty girls and boys
Are up in the cockpit
Because after we do this, we'll be flying through the air
(Flying through the air)
Well, after the DJ and the pretty girls and boys
Are up in the cockpit, going up

I'm gonna take this club to the city of love
Come, we're gonna go flying

We're going up up up till the stars are below
I'm gonna take this club to the city of love
Come, we're gonna go flying
Oh I may need a co-pilot
Baby be my co-pilot

With every puff puff puff, girl the higher you go (the higher you go)
Out on the dance floor, anything is possible (anything is possible)
Come, we're gonna go flying
Oh I may need a co-pilot
Baby be my co-pilot

Eyo
