		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What now my love, now that you left me
How can I live through another day
Watching my dreams turn into ashes
And all my hopes into bits of clay
Once I could see, once I could feel
Now I'm numb, I've become unreal

I walk the night, oh, without a goal
Stripped of my heart, my soul
What now my love, now that it's over
I feel the world closing in on me
Here comes the stars tumbling around me
And there's the sky where the sea should be

What now my love, now that you're gone
I'd be a fool to go on and on
No one would care, no one would cry
If I should live or die

What now my love, now there is nothing
Only my last goodbye
Only my last goodbye
