		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know you think I'm new to the game but trust me bae I'm not straight out the woodworks
Talk shit to you friends again but you still wanna know how my wood works
I don't trust cupid because of my past I learned that it's best that I shoot first
Live in the flesh talk bad on the net
But wanna love me every time you do a u turns

And this girl been hurt I know
She's been hurting again again
Look I just wanna be your man
But just know I can be your friend
Every time that i'm by your side
This love man I can't pretend
Baby girl I'm not good with love but I'm not trying to make things end
And I hope I can make you smile in dark times when I'm not even there
And I know that you don't trust people but just know that I really care
This girls my ride or die
Your problems are mine I swear
And if you ever need a hug you just gotta tell me where

I always thought that's this love ting shit I rather hit booth and make me a hit
(huh)
Been feeling detached no cap one thing I'm finding it hard to admit
Then i meet you with your ocean eyes hold you tight shared a midnight kiss
I never grew up with things like cause back den niggas never give me shit
If a bruh touch you watch me cut through clock it back with this harpoon
Bruce Wayne I'm your darkest knight I loves when she rides like we are making so hard porn
Dark horse ride out in a dark ford
Two wasp on me that Huey and Riley make a man move around like I'm star lord
Let bine out make em hold hard corn

And this girl been hurt I know
She's been hurting again again
Look I just wanna be your man
But just know I can be your friend
Every time that I'm by your side
This love man I can't pretend
Baby girl I'm not good with love but I'm not trying to make this end
And I hope I can make you smile in dark times when I'm not even there
And I know that you don't trust people but just know that I really care
This girls my ride or die
Your problems on mine I swear
Just know if you need a hug you just gotta tell me where

I tried to give you space
I gave you nothing but love but your love was fake now I know my place
I fall in love with being alone I wanna go ghost and forget your face
Cause of you I'm losing me man this pain I wanna erase look
Man this pain I wanna erase
Your new man can't do it like me I treated you like a VIP
Other girls? it was u I see now it's fuck love like DTB
Your new man can't do it like me I treated you like a VIP
Other girls? it was u I c now it's fuck love like DTB
I was there when you needed closure
See me if you wanna get closer
But when I call you never come over
Heart break I don't wanna be sober
I can't lie I still think about us
Now I know the love was lust
Cause of you I can hardly trust
Pain gone when I'm smoking dust
