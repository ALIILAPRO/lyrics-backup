		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I wake up each morning 
Trying to find myself
And if I'm ever the least unsure
I always remind myself
Though you're someone in this world 
That I'll always choose to love
From now on 
You're only someone that I used to love

As for me it's getting down to the last unspoken part
When you must begin to ease the pain of a broken heart
Tell me why should I even care
If I have to lose your love
From now on
You're only someone that I used to love

Yet it wasn't enough for you
All the love I had to give
I did my best to keep you satisfied
I guess you'll never know how much I tried
I really tried

And if ever our paths should cross again
Well, You won't find me being the one 
Who gets lost
Once I had so much to give
But You just refused my love
From now on
You're only someone that I used to love

I did my best to keep you satisfied
I guess you'll never know how much I tried
I really tried

When I wake up each morning 
Trying to find myself
And if I'm ever the least unsure
I always remind myself
Though you're someone in this world 
I'll always choose to love
From now on 
You're only someone that I used to love

Though you're someone in this world 
I'll always choose to love
From now on 
You're only someone that I used to love

From now on 
You're only someone that I used to love
