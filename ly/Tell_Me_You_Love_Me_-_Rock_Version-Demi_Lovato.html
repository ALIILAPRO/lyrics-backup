		  Oh, no, here we go again
Fighting over what I said
I'm sorry
Yeah, I'm sorry
Bad at love, no, I'm not good at this
But I can't say I'm innocent
Not hardly
But I'm sorry

And all my friends, they know and it's true
I don't know who I am without you
I got it bad, baby
Got it bad

Oh, tell me you love me
I need someone
On days like this, I do
On days like this
Oh, tell me you love me
I need someone
On days like this, I do
On days like this

Oh, can you hear my heart say?
(Whoa, oh, whoa)
They say you ain't nobody 'til you got somebody
You ain't nobody 'til you got somebody

And I hope I never see the day
That you move on and be happy
Without me (without me)
Without me (without me)
What's my hand without your heart to hold?
I don't know what I'm living for
If I'm livin' (if I'm livin')
Without you, ooh

All my friends, they know and it's true
I don't know who I am without you
I got it bad, baby
I got it bad

Oh, tell me you love me (ooh)
I need someone
On days like this, I do
On days like this
Oh, tell me you love me
I need someone
On days like this, I do
On days like this

Oh, can you hear my heart say?
(Whoa, oh, whoa)
They say you ain't nobody 'til you got somebody
You ain't nobody 'til you got somebody
My heart say
(Whoa, oh, whoa) Ooh
They say you ain't nobody 'til you got somebody
You ain't nobody 'til you got somebody

Everything I need
Is standin' right in front of me
I know that we will be
Alright, alright, yeah
Through the ups and downs
Baby, I'ma stick around
I promise we will be
Alright

Oh, tell me you love me
I need someone
On days like this, I do
On days like this
Oh, tell me you love me
I need someone
On days like this, I do (days like this)
On days like this (oh, whoa)

Oh, can you hear my heart say?
Hear my heart say, hear my heart say (whoa, oh, whoa)
They say you ain't nobody 'til you got somebody
You ain't nobody 'til you got somebody

Everything I need (oh)
Is standin' right in front of me (oh)
I know that we will be
Alright, alright, yeah
