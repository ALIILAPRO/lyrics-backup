		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mmh, mmh
Mmh, mmh

Now what do I do with this love I found?
What do I put in the hole inside the ground?
Oh, I'm falling higher
Flying deeper
Oh, the love I found

What do I do with the smile trapped in my mouth?
How do I prove there's a ghost this time around?
It's like catching fire
Walking on water
Oh, the love I found

Say the word and I'll burn it all
Play the chord and I'll bleed some more
We ain't getting younger
Age's just a number
Oh, oh, oh

Maybe clouds won't break my fall
Maybe it will be enough
Time's getting older
The light's getting closer
Oh, oh, oh

So what do I do with this love I saved for you?
What do I move to the space I held for two?
Can you taste the choir?
Can you feel the whisper?
Oh, the love I found, ohh

Oh, oh, ohh-ooh
Oh, oh
Oh, the love I found
