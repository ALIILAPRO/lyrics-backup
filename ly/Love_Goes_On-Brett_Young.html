		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We were fifteen, you sat right next to me
We shared a textbook on Chemistry 
You were my first so it's no surprise that you got the best of me
But what's perspective everyone's reckless when they're just fifteen
I never thought the we'd be

Seventeen, and you got your hands on me
Begging me to give you a reason to stay
Yeah, I was so naive, watching while you turned to leave
Didn't think a heart could heal after it breaks

But love goes on, the pages turn
Into songs, lessons learned
Sometimes it here, and then it's gone
But that's okay, love goes on
Love goes on

I had my doubts, I was hard to get to when I first met you
That night in old town
I was defensive, but you were relentless in breaking my guard down
You asked me who broke it, stole some emotions
Well, I'd have to recount
I never thought that I'd bring 

Seventeen all the way to you and me
Thinking history repeats and you'd never stay
You said, "You're so naive, thinking I could ever leave
Don't you know a heart can heal after it breaks"

And love goes on, pages turn
Into songs, lessons learned
Sometimes it here, and then it's gone
But that's okay, love goes on
Love goes on

Yeah-yeah
When it's here and then it's gone
Yeah-yeah
And you think you've lost the one
Yeah-yeah
Ah, when all is said and done
Yeah-yeah- yeah

Love goes on, the pages turn
Into songs, lessons learned
Sometimes it here, and then it's gone
But that's okay, love goes on
Love goes on, the pages turn
Into songs, lessons learned
Sometimes it here, and then it's gone
But it's okay, yeah, love goes on
Love goes on
Love goes on
Love goes on
