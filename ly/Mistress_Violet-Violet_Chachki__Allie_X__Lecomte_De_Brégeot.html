		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I confess
I'm becoming obsessed
With the feminine and divine

I'm somewhat addicted
To being depicted
The bitch with a whip and the Dior tights

I know how to roll them up
So sheer so delicate
Pink satin panties
Lacy padding
Followed by a black waist slip

Shut up

Yes, you're correct in assuming that I
Prefer provocative extremes
When I attend to my businessmen
I like to show them all the seams
Most men know if they misbehave
They're gonna pay while I collect
And that's why they all come to me
So I can teach them some respect

Absolute quiet now

Mistress Violet
I'm your other life
Your pain and pleasure wife
I'm violent
Feels good to get it out
I like when you say ouch
Mistress Violet

Ne bouge pas!
Mistress Violet
Ne parle pas!

Did I ask your opinion?
No, that's what I thought
Having decided in black hosiery
I had a waist for a little skirt
Mistress Violet slipped me into a mini
And the silhouette did the work
She strapped on 6 inch Louboutin
Demonstrated how to walk with ease
And somewhere down the fucking line
Miss Violet became me

Somewhere down the fucking line
Miss Violet became me

Mistress Violet
I'm your other life
Your pain and pleasure wife
I'm violent
Feels good to get it out
I like when you say ouch
Mistress Violet

Mistress Violet
Mistress Violet
Mistress Violet (ouch)
Mistress Violet (shut up)

Shut the fuck up
Mistress Violet

Ooh, ooh ooh, ooh
