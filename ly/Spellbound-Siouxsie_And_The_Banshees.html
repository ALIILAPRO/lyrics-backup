		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  From the cradle bars
Comes a beckoning voice
It sends you spinning
You have no choice

You hear a laughter
Cracking through the walls
It sends you spinning
You have no choice

You hear laughter
Cracking through the walls
It sends you spinning
You have no choice

Following the footsteps
Of a rag doll dance
We are entranced
Spellbound

Following the footsteps
Of a rag doll dance
We are entranced
Spellbound
Spellbound
Spellbound

Spellbound
Spellbound
Spellbound
Spellbound

And don't forget
When your elders forget
To say their prayers
Take 'em by the legs
And throw 'em down the stairs

When you think
Your toys have gone berserk
It's an illusion
You cannot shirk

You hear laughter
Cracking through the walls
It sends you spinning
You have no choice

Following the footsteps
Of a rag doll dance
We are entranced
Spellbound

Following the footsteps
Of a rag doll dance
We are entranced
Spellbound
Spellbound
Spellbound

Spellbound
Spellbound
Spellbound
Spellbound
Spellbound

Following the footsteps
Of a rag doll dance
We are entranced

Following the footsteps
Of a rag doll dance
We are entranced
Entranced, entranced
Entranced, entranced
Entranced, entranced
