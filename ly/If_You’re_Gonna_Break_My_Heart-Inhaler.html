		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We woke up faded
From the shape of the night
Couldn't find the words
Couldn't find the light
We got caught in the tide
And the shore was on the other side
There's no other way around
Up or down
When the sun shines
On my insides

If you're gonna break my heart
Smash it to pieces
'Cause I'm not gonna need it
As much as I do right now
Right now

I showed you mercy
You gave me murder
I got your ten ton monkey
Jumping up on my back
We got caught in the ride
Of being young and alive
There's no other way around
Up or down
But some nights
Yeah, that's alright

If you're gonna break my heart
Smash it to pieces
'Cause I'm not gonna need it
As much as I do right now
If you're gonna break my heart
Smash it to pieces
'Cause I'm not gonna need it
As much as I do right now

Say what you're gonna say anyway
Nothing really means as much as you do
I should be on my way but I can't help
Waiting for you

To come and break my heart
And smash it to pieces
'Cause I'm not gonna need it
As much as I do right now
If you're gonna break my heart
Smash it to pieces
'Cause I'm not gonna need it
As much as I do right now

Right now
As much as I do (right now)
Oh, as much as I do (right now)
As much as I do right now
As much as I do right now
As much as I do
