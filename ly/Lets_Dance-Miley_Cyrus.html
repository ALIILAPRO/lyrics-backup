		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The weekend's almost done, the moon is low in the sky
I feel like going out before the night passes by
I won't just sit around when life becomes a drag
I dance

I like the bass, turn it up, turn it up, turn it up
I like the boom, turn it up, turn it up, turn it up
I need guitar, turn it up, turn it up, turn it up
I like that drum when it goes, boom tih-boom tih-boom

Let's dance! What the weekend, what the night is all about
Let's dance! Grab your girlfriends, grab your boyfriends, sweat it out
Let's dance! Move your whole body and let's start the party
Too much rock for one girl can make her go crazy
I need someone to dance with me baby, dance!

The music's on, turn it up, turn it up, turn it up
My favorite song, turn it up, turn it up, turn it up
The beat is strong, turn it up, turn it up, turn it up
We'll dance, c'mon!

Let's dance! What the weekend, what the night is all about
Let's dance! Grab your girlfriends, grab your boyfriends, sweat it out
Let's dance! Move your whole body and let's start the party
Too much rock for one girl can make her go crazy
I need someone to dance with me baby

Dance! Keep movin'
Back it up, yeah!

When the night says hello, yeah get ready to go
Turn it up, turn it loose, yeah you've got no excuse
Just take a chance, get out on the floor and dance

Let's dance! What the weekend, what the night is all about
Let's dance! Grab your girlfriends, grab your boyfriends, sweat it out
Let's dance! And let's start the party
Dance with me, dance with me, dance with me, dance

Let's dance! What the weekend, what the night is all about
Let's dance! Grab your girlfriends, grab your boyfriends, sweat it out
Let's dance! Move your whole body and let's start the party
As soon as my album goes number one
Mr. Lim I'd like a Rolex with forty diamonds, ha ha ha
