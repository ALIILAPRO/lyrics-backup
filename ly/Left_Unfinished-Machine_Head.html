		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Why was I born? 
Sometimes I wish I didn't know 
Been times when 
I wish that I had just never been 
Why did you have me? 
Or better yet why'd you leave? 
So to the people that could fuck 
But then abandoned me 

I'll give to this world what you couldn't give 
Love the unwanted, every child born discarded 
Add to the flock 
The rejects you dumped on 

I'll never forget 
Life you disdain 
So to the parents that bore me this pain 
With all those things you left unfinished 

You never could love me 
I'm glad that you never did 
My parents that raised me 
Had plenty of that to give 
And for that 
I'll love them forever with all my heart 
But to you 
Don't let there be no mistake about it 
Fuck you, you cocksucker 
Fuck you, you whore 
I'll live my life the opposite of what you are 

Love will be my rock 
The rock that I stand on 

I'll never forget 
Life you disdain 
So to the parents that bore me this pain 
With all those things you left unfinished 

Don't try to reach out to me 
Don't try to call 
The boy that you created 
Is dead for all you fucking know 
You just pretend you've never heard or seen 
The name Lawrence Mathew Cardine
