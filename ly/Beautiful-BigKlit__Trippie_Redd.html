		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Bitch)
I still remember

You're so, you're so fucking 

You're so fucking beautiful, you're so fucking beautiful, you're so fucking beautiful
And you don't... even know
You're so fucking beautiful, you're so fucking beautiful, you're so fucking beautiful
And you don't even know, you don't even know
But, you want to hide in your lies or behind
Left it all behind just to grind with you and
You let it go (you let it go)
You let it all go (you let it all go)
You let it go (fuck)
You fucking hoe

You're so fucking beautiful, you're so fucking beautiful, you're so fucking beautiful
I never got to let you know
You're so fucking beautiful, you're so fucking beautiful, you're so fucking beautiful
And I never let you know

Honestly, you're so damn beautiful
Honestly, I'm trying to go where you go
Honestly, I wanna grip your ribs and throat
Honestly, I wanna be on your mental
You can be all mine, get rid of so and so
Won't waste your time, baby, I know you know 
Yeah
So beautiful 
Beautiful
So beautiful

You're so fucking beautiful, you're so fucking beautiful, you're so fucking beautiful
I never got to let you know
You're so fucking beautiful, you're so fucking beautiful, you're so fucking beautiful
And I never let you know
You're so fucking beautiful, you're so fucking beautiful (and I never got to let you know), you're so fucking beautiful 
So beautiful
You stupid hoe
So beautiful, so beautiful
You're so fucking beautiful, you're so fucking beautiful, you're so fucking beautiful
And I never let you know
So, there you go.
