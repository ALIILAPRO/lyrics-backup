		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And I was a boy from school
Helplessly helping all the rules
And there was a boy at school
Hopelessly wrestling all his fools

And there was a girl at school
Blaming all the words she learned from home
Nothing would keep her a child
Long hours don't you know we try

We try but we didn't have long
We try but we don't belong
We try but we didn't have long
We try but we don't belong

Now I meet you on the street
Harmlessly breaking rules we meet
Lives are found and love's are lost
Say goodbye to nothing everything caused

Now I find you on the street
Breaking rules hopelessly we meet
Lives are found but love's are lost
Say goodbye to everything, nothing caused

We try but we didn't have long
We try but we don't belong
We try but we didn't have long
We try but we don't belong

I got, I got lost
You said this was the way back
I got, I got lost
You said this was the way back
I got, I got lost
You said this was the way back

We try but we didn't have long
We try but we don't belong
We try but we didn't have long
We try but we don't belong
