		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Call it what you want
I said just call it what you want
Call it what you want

Yeah we're locked up in ideas
We like to label everything
Well I'm just gonna do here what I gotta do here
'Cause I gotta keep myself free
You're ducking and moving just to hide your bruising from all your enemies
And I'm in the crossfire dodging bullets from you expectancies

We've got nothing to lose
You better run and hide
Yeah you've crossed the line
I've got a knife behind my back (just sayin')
We've got nothing to prove
Your social guides give you swollen eyes
But what I've got can't be bought so you can just

Call it what you want, yeah yeah call it what you want
Yeah yeah I said just call it what you want, yeah yeah call it what you want

You've taken your words and you take your judgments
And stick them onto everything
If it don't conform to what you were born into,
Then you run the other way
You say, "now what's your style and who do you listen to?" who cares?
Well that rat race ladder-climbing fake-face smile's got nothing on me

We've got nothing to lose
You better run and hide
Yeah you've crossed the line
I've got a knife behind my back (just sayin')
We've got nothing to prove
Your social guides give you swollen eyes
But what I've got can't be bought so you can just

Call it what you want, yeah yeah call it what you want
Yeah yeah I said just call it what you want, yeah yeah call it what you want

Call it what you want
Call it what you want
Call it what you want, yeah yeah call it what you want
Yeah yeah I said just call it what you want, yeah yeah call it what you want
