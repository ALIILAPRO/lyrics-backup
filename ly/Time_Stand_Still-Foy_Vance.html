		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know that you feel it
So why d'you wanna wait so long? You said you wanted
To find yourself a confidant
To share the secrets of

All the dreams you were dreaming
And speaking to yourself so low, it's hard to know
Until you finally crack the code
And reveal the ode

Oh, but if time would just stand still
Oh, I'd be fine
If time would just stand still
Oh, I'd be refined, I'd find my will
If time would stand still

I never meant to make you angry
I never meant to make you sure, it's just that I
Sometimes feel like rain somehow
Caught up in a heavy cloud

And I know how you're feeling
You're feeling like you can't go on, when you're the queen
And I'm the king that acts a pawn
With such relaxing form

Oh, but if time would just stand still
Oh, I'd be fine
And if time would just stand still
Oh, I'd be refined, I'd find my will
If time would stand still

And so the music fades
And I turn to what I'm left with now
Hold tight to this friend I find
This mentor of my passing time

Oh, but if time would just stand still
Oh, I'd be fine
If time would just stand still
Oh, I'd be refined

Yes, if time would just stand still
Oh, I'd be fine
If time would just stand still
I'd find my will

And so the music fades
And I turn to what I'm left with now
