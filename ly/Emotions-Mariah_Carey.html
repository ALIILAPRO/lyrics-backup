		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above

I feel good
I feel nice
I've never felt so satisfied
I'm in love
I'm alive
Intoxicated
Flying high
It feels like a dream
When you touch me tenderly
I don't know if it's real
But I like the way I feel inside

You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above

In the morning when I rise
You are the first thing on my mind
And in the middle of the night
I feel your heartbeat next to mine
It feels like a dream
When you love me tenderly
I don't know if you're for real
But I like the way I feel inside

You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above

You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of (baby)
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above, oh-oh

You know the way to make me lose control
When you're looking into my eyes
You make me feel so high

Oh-oh, oh baby (oh baby)
Hey, alright (alright)
Ooh-ooh, hey-hey
Whoa

You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions (emotions)
Higher than the heavens above

Oh yeah (higher)
You've got me feeling emotions, yes you do
Oh yeah
You've got me feeling emotions, yeah

(Higher, emotions)
(Deeper than I've ever dreamed of)
(You)
(Emotions, emotions)

You've got me feeling higher
