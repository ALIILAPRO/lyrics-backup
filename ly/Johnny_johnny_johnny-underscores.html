		  (Good luck)

Follow me

Johnny, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny, whoops, Johnny, whoops
Johnny, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny (Johnny, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny!) Yeah
Johnny, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny, whoops, Johnny, whoops
Johnny, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny! (Johnny, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny)

When I was 11 years old, I just wanted to be pretty
I stayed away from the creeps but they got me through my screens
Saying I could only do it if I'm face down in a bed
So I was counting the days 'til I was up for the taking
And when it finally hit, I had to let the right one in
And there was something 'bout this Johnny that seemed different from the rest

Johnny, Johnny, Johnny, I just want to be your girl
I do, I do, I do
Johnny, Johnny, all you gotta do is say the word
I'll do, I'll do, do anything for you
Johnny, Johnny, Johnny wants me always wearing heels
So I do, I do, I do
'Cause Johnny's gonna be the one who finally makes me real
It's you, it's you, it's you
(Oh, Johnny, I think I love you!)

Johnny, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny, whoops, Johnny, whoops
Johnny, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny (Johnny, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny!) Yeah
Johnny, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny, whoops, Johnny, whoops
Johnny, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny! (Johnny, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny)

Johnny really was the only one to tell me I was pretty
And I know I shouldn't cater to the sweet talk of a stranger
But James and Jake and Jimmy never talk to me that way
I wore the dress that he chose that night at Maddy's apartment
And while his tongue was in my mouth, hanging right above the couch
Were his posters of teenage girls, oh, I have made a huge mistake

Johnny, Johnny, Johnny, I just want to be your girl
I do, I do, I do
Johnny, Johnny, all you gotta do is say the word
I'll do, I'll do, do anything for you
Johnny, Johnny, Johnny says to bid my life farewell
So I do, I do, I do
'Cause no one else but Johnny sees me like I see myself
It's you, it's you, it's you
(Oh, Johnny, I think I love you!)

And once he told me he was so glad that I hadn't been touched yet (ew)
I exited my body and it got up off the carpet
And it kept on telling lies until they got me out the door
'Cause when I was 11 years old, I just wanted to be pretty
And when Johnny was 11, huh, I hadn't even been born

Johnny, Johnny, Johnny, I just want to be your girl
I do, I do, I do
Johnny, Johnny, all you gotta do is save my world
I'll do, I'll do, do anything for you
Johnny, Johnny, Johnny, I just want a Johnny, whoops 
(Johnny, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny, whoops, Johnny, whoops)
I do, I do, I do (Johnny, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny, do it, do it, do-do-do)
(Johnny, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny, Whoops, Johnny, Whoops)
It's you, it's you, it's you (Johnny, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny)
(Oh, Johnny, I really thought I loved you!)
