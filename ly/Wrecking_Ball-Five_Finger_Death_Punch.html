		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sliced up, shot down
Everybody bows down
Kill em all, let em fall
God'll sort em out
Ripped up, zip it up
Really never gave a fuck
Wrecking ball, fuck em all
Never had a doubt

I'm, never gonna be the one
I'm, always gonna say what I feel
I'm, always do what I do
Sick of all the bullshit

Why should I
Always be the one to back away
Why should I
Have to be the one to not say what's on my mind
I'm a mother fuckin' wrecking ball

Take down, ground and pound
That's the resolution
Show face, disgrace
A scar of evolution

Nice boots, cheap suit
You're about to find out
Right here, right now
That's what I'm about

I'm, always gonna be the one
I'm, always gonna say the shit that
I'm, always gonna hold a grudge
Sick of all the bullshit

Why should I
Always be the one to back away
Why should I
Have to be the one to not say what's on my mind
I'm a mother fuckin' wrecking ball

Why should I
Always be the one to back away
Why should I
Have to be the one to not say what's on my mind

Why should I
Always be the one to back away
Why should I
Have to be the one to not say what's on my mind
I'm a mother fuckin' wrecking ball
