		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The moon is right
The spirits up
We're here tonight
And that's enough

Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time

The party's on
The feelin's here
That only comes
This time of year

Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time

The choir of children sing their song
Ding dong, ding dong
Ding dong, ding oh
Oh

Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time

The word is out
About the town
To lift a glass
Ah don't look down

Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time

The choir of children sing their song
They practiced all year long
Ding dong, ding dong
Ding dong, ding dong
Ding dong, ding dong

The party's on
The spirits up
We're here tonight
And that's enough

Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time

The moon is right
The spirits up
We're here tonight
And that's enough

Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time

Oh
Christmas time
