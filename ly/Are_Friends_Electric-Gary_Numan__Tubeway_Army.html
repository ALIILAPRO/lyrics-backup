		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's cold outside
And the paint's peeling off of my walls
There's a man outside
In a long coat, grey hat, smoking a cigarette

Now the light fades out
And I'm wondering what I'm doing in a room like this
There's a knock on the door
And just for a second I thought I remembered you

So now I'm alone
Now I can think for myself
About little deals
And *issues*
And things that I just don't understand
Like a white lie that night
Or a slight touch at times
I don't think it meant anything to you

So I open the door
It's the `friend' that I'd left in the hallway
"please sit down"
A candle lit a shadow on a wall near the bed

You know I hate to ask
But, are `friends' electric?
Mine's broke down
And now I've no one to love

So I find out your reason
For the phone calls and smiles
And it hurts
And I'm lonely
And I should never have tried
And I missed you tonight
So it's time to leave
You see this means everything to me
