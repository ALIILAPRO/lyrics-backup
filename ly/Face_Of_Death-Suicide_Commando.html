		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The best part of killing someone
is the look on their face
It's that look..
Not when they're threated
Not when you hurt them
Not even when they see the knife
It's when they feel the knife go in

Face death of an innocent young girl
We face death of an innocent child
Cold blood, put to death without meaning
We don't care because we think we are god

Blind rage, black evil
The last betrayal of our own flesh and blood
Wake up, stop screaming
We sell our soul and we kill our own god

Face death of a whole generation
We face death of the human kind
Face death of a whole generation
We face death of the weak and the blind

Slow death of a man killed in blind rage
Slow death of the human race
Tormented bodies castaway in a black cage
Tormented bodies castaway in a cage

Blind rage, black evil
The last betrayal of our own flesh and blood
Wake up, stop screaming
We sell our soul and we kill our own god

Face death of a whole generation
We face death of the human kind
Face death of a whole generation
We face death of the weak and the blind
