		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey

Six foot one and lonely
Dressed in spaghetti rags
Standing at the bus stop
With her alligator bags

What can you do?
No, no, no, what can I do?
I better see a doctor
'Cause I think I'm getting hooked on you

I ain't much for talkin'
But all I got to say is

Here I am
Close your eyes and I'll be Superman
Here I am
Come on and take my lovin' while you can

She broke a million hearts
On Second Avenue
With her German cigarettes
And designer attitude

What can you do?
No, no, no, what can I do?
My love's been goin' blind
Since the first time I laid eyes on you

Ain't much for conversation
But I got to let you know

Here I am
Close your eyes and I'll be Superman
Here I am
Come on, take my lovin' while you can

You don't need a crystal ball
To see she's got it all, yeah

Here I am
Close your eyes and I'll be Superman
Here I am
Come on and take my lovin' while you can, do say

Here I am
Close your eyes and I'll be Superman
Say, here I am
Come on and take my lovin' while you can
