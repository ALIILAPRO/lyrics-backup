		  I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth (just whip it)
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth (whip it real good)
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth, I whip my

Hop up out the bed turn my swag on
Pay no attention to them haters because we whip 'em off
And we ain't doing nothing wrong
So don't tell me nothing, I'm just tryna have fun
So keep the party jumping, so whats up? (yeah)

And I'll be doing what to do
We turn our backs and whip our hair
And just shake 'em off, shake 'em off
Shake 'em off, shake 'em off

Don't let haters keep me off my grind
With my head up, I know I'll be fine
Keep fighting until I get there 
When I'm down and I feel like giving up
I think again

I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth (just whip it)
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth (whip it real good)

I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth (just whip it)
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth (whip it real good)

I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth (OK, OK, OK, OK) (just whip it)
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth (whip it real good)

I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth (OK, OK, OK, OK)
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth

I'm going get more shine in a little bit
Soon as I hit the stage, applause I'm hearing it
Whether it's black stars, black cars I'm feeling it
But can't none of them whip it like I do

I, I get to that mmm yeah I go hard
When they see me pull up I whip it real hard
I whip it real hard, real hard
I whip it real hard

Don't let haters keep me off my grind
With my head up, I know I'll be fine
Keep fighting until I get there
When I'm down and I feel like giving up
I think again

I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth (just whip it)
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth (whip it real good)

I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth (just whip it)
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth (whip it real good)

I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth (OK, OK, OK, OK) (just whip it)
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth (whip it real good)

I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth (OK, OK, OK, OK) (just whip my hair)
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth 

All my ladies if you feel it
Come on do it do it whip your hair (whip your hair)
Don't matter if its long, short
Do it do it whip your hair (whip your hair)
