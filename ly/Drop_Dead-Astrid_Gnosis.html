		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I am forever

Till I drop
Drop Dead
With a bullet in the head

Drop 
Drop Dead
Bullet bullet
In the head

All that debt
Imma drive it
To the edge
Drive it drive it 
To the edge 
Till I drop
Drop Dead

Fuck this trend of 
Imaginary friends

God is dead 
Pop pop 
Those meds

Drive it drive it
To the edge
Till you drop 
Drop dead
Now put a bullet
In your head

Yeah thats what I said


I just want to rob all the banks
and burn rubber
Sure I got no fucks to give
or time

If you're in this for the kick
come with me down the hole

you can stay and dodge the hits
but I got to 
got to go

I'm really tired of 
your stupid white cube
and everyone 
paying to make it 
through the tube 

And I'm this 
or I'm that but 
I'm not fast food
I'm crude oil baby
and you're just as screwed

hahahaha

'cos if you snooze you lose
You've got to burn rubber

All for one
One for all or nada

Is it a form of secondary orality
Mister Walter Ong
To put out cigarette butts
On your tongue?

Who the fuck is calling me on a private number?
Fuck you I'm busy
I'm listening to Gabber

Like a kick in the teeth
I like the beat fatter
Like a kick in the teeth
Yeah

Till you drop
Drop dead
With a bullet in the head
Drop drop dead
Bullet bullet in the head
All that debt drive drive it to the edge
Drive it drive it to the edge till you drop drop dead
Till you drop drop dead
Till you drop drop dead

All that debt
Drive it drive it
To the edge
Drive drive it to the edge
Till you drop drop dead

Yeah thats what I said

We're just crude oil baby
