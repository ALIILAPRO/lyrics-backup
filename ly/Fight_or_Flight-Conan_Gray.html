		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Something's gotten into you
You don't really look at me the way you used to
And I'm hoping it ain't true
Every single rumor that I've heard of you say
Say you were off with someone that I don't know
Callin' other people on your telephone
Kinda wish I didn't know

Well, fight or flight, I'd rather die
Than have to cry in front of you
Fight or flight, I'd rather lie
Than tell you I'm in love with you
My eyes are welling up as you admit there's someone new
It's my move, fight or flight

You tell me it ain't what it seems
But baby, this is looking like a crime scene
There's clothes thrown on the balcony
And you smell like perfume out a magazine
I'm throwing all your shit out of my window
Telling you I wish that we had never spoke
Baby, I already know

Well, fight or flight, I'd rather die
Than have to cry in front of you
Fight or flight, I'd rather lie
Than tell you I'm in love with you
My eyes are welling up as you admit there's someone new
It's my move, fight or flight

Now there's someone at my door
Someone I've not met before
They've got eyes like mine
A pretty smile and they've been crying for a while
'Cause they also didn't know
That our lover loved us both

Well, fight or flight, I'd rather die
Than have to cry in front of you
Fight or flight, I'd rather lie
Than tell you I'm in love with you
My eyes are welling up as you admit there's someone new
It's my move, fight or flight
