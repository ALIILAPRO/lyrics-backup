		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wake up feeling, in my soul I'm
Living someone else's life
I'm turning into concrete, harder than these city streets
Where no one even cares if I'm alive

I gotta get it right
Get it right, mmm mmm

There's a place that I know where they all know me
I gotta get back now to the ones who love me
Wrap myself around you, never let you go
There's nothing in the world that feels like
The place that I know where they all know me
I've gotta get back now to the ones who love me
Wrap myself around you, never let you go
There's nothin' in the world that feels like
Coming home, home, home, mmm
Coming home

My mind's heavy and I can't sleep, not even a memory
Is good enough to get me through the night, mmm
I'm longing for the real thing, people who know the real me
And all the ways to love me back to life

Mmm, I gotta get it right, ooh, yeah
Get it right, ooh, yeah

There's a place that I know where they all know me
I gotta get back now to the ones who love me
Wrap myself around you, never let you go
There's nothin' in the world that feels like
The place that I know where they all know me
I gotta get back now to the ones who love me
Wrap myself around you, never let you go
There's nothin' in the world that feels like
Coming home, home, home, mmm
I'm coming home, home, home, mmm
I'm coming home

Yeah I know it's only one call away but it's not the same
Yeah I know it's only one call away but it's not the same (just not the same)
Yeah I know it's only one call away but it's not the same (it's not the same)
Yeah I know it's only one call away but it's not the same

There's a place that I know where they all know me
I gotta get back now to the ones who love me (oh baby)
Wrap myself around you, never let you go
There's nothin' in the world that feels like (hey)

The place that I know where they all know me
I gotta get back now to the ones who love me
Wrap myself around you, never let you go
There's nothin' in the world that feels like
Coming home

I'm feeling lost in all the madness
I need somewhere to ease my mind
Coming home
These sidewalks filled with different faces
So many place but there's none like mine
Coming home
