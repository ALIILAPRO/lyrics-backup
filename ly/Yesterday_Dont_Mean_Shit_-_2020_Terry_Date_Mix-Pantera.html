		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's nothing special about it 
It's either there when you're born or not 
Gifted with talent or no big deal 
Welcome to the death of a century 

'Cause yesterday don't mean shit 
What's over is over and nothing between 
Yesterday don't mean shit 
Because tomorrow's the day you have to face 
No rewinding time 
Yesterday don't mean shit 
Yesterday don't mean shit 

Reliving old reviews 
Is a useless tool of confusion 
Don't hold your breath for the turn around 
Come into the world of endless odds 

'Cause yesterday don't mean shit 
What's over is over and nothing between 
Yesterday don't mean shit 
Because tomorrow's the day you have to face 
No rewinding time 
Yesterday don't mean shit 
Yesterday don't mean shit 

They'll tell you all about guilt 
And in time you'll face the darkness 
But darkness is a friend to you 
Embrace and fly through the madness 
Flying past God, and wars and conflict 
Oppression in you 
Oppression in you 
Plowing through minds and paranoia 
Oppression in you 
The oppressor's in you 

'Cause yesterday don't mean shit 
What's over is over and nothing between 
Yesterday don't mean shit 
Because tomorrow's the day you have to face 
No rewinding time 
Yesterday don't mean shit 
Yesterday don't mean shit

Yesterday don't mean jack shit

You protect you and I'll keep to myself 
It can only be that way, yeah
