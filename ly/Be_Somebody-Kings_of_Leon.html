		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Taking to the floor with the wheel to the sky
I loosen my tie, I loosen my tie
Locking down the door with the rhythm and rhyme
I loosen my tie, I loosen my tie

Trying to recall what you want me to say
I shake your way, I shake your way
Counting on the night for a beautiful day
I shake your way, I shake your way
And I say you can't get enough
No you can't get enough

Given a chance, I'm gonna be somebody
If for one dance, I'm gonna be somebody
Open the door, it's gonna make you love me
Facing the floor, I'm gonna be somebody

Now is your time and you know where you stand
With a gun in your hand, with a gun in your hand
Now I'm no longer an ordinary man
Was this your big plan, your gun in your hand
And I say you can't get enough
No you can't get enough

Given a chance, I'm gonna be somebody
If for one dance, I'm gonna be somebody
Open the door, it's gonna make you love me
Facing the floor, I'm gonna be somebody

Be somebody
Be somebody
