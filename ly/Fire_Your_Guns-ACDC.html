		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wild beast, I'll make you mine
Taste your kiss, sweet lips divine
She got moves, drips of sweat
She got eyes of blue, body curves
'n legs that'll break your nerves

[Chorus]
Fire - when she's going down
Fire - then she make you drown
Fire - then she blow you round

Yeah, you want some fun
Fire your guns
Fire your guns
Fire your guns
Fire your guns

That lady bites, hard style
Drips of sex, eyes are wild
She got moves, long long legs
She got eyes of blue, body curves
Legs that'll shake the earth

[Chorus]

Yeah, you want some fun
You gotta fire your guns
Fire your guns
You gotta fire your guns
Fire your guns
(Yeah, yeow!)
Yeah

[Chorus]

Yeah, you want some fun
Gotta fire your guns
Fire your guns (x9)
