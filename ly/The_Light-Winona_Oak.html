		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Standing on a ceiling
It's a way of finding meaning
When you're dying for a feeling
Do you care about me now
You were putting on a great show
But where did all your friends go
Was it easier to let go
Do you care about me now

Riding through a storm on the back of a white horse
Feeling it all, there's so much I should be here for
Say I'll be okay

I don't wanna live, I don't wanna die
I just wanna feel like I have the fight
In me
Just let me breathe
I don't wanna break, I don't need to cry
I just wanna know that I had the light
Still in me
Just let my heart beat

Beat
Beat

Everything that went wrong
Everything you counted on
Everyone that hurt you
Do you care about them now?

Riding through a storm on the back of a white horse
Know I wanna stay, there's so much I should be here for
Say I'll be okay

I don't wanna live, I don't wanna die
I just wanna feel like I have the fight
In me
Just let me breathe
I don't wanna break, I don't need to cry
I just wanna know did I have the light
Still in me
Just let my heart beat

Beat
Beat
Beat
Beat
