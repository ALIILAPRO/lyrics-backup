		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm out feeling lonely again
Am I too scared? Scared of letting you in?
Keep on hoping that you'll stay 'til the end
Even when I hide

Maybe something's holding me back
Oh, maybe I just like it like that
Keep on hoping one day you'll understand
When I'm not making sense

I got a jungle in my heart
When it gets wild, when it gets dark
Yeah, only you know where to go
But if you're lost then let me know
I got a jungle in my heart
I wish I knew you from the start
It never feels like you're that far
From the jungle in my heart

In my heart

I don't ever stop believing in us
Try my best to hold onto what we got
When it's slipping, oh, I hope it's enough (ooh)

Maybe something's holding me back
Oh, maybe I just like it like that
Keep on hoping one day you'll understand
When I'm not making sense

I got a jungle in my heart
I wish I knew you from the start
It never feels like you're that far
From the jungle in my heart

(I got a jungle in my heart)
(I got a jungle in my heart)
(I got a jungle in my heart)
(I got a jungle in my heart)
(I got a jungle)
In my heart

I got a jungle in my heart
When it gets wild, when it gets dark
Yeah, only you know where to go
But if you're lost then let me know
I got a jungle in my heart
I wish I knew you from the start
It never feels like you're that far
From the jungle in my heart
