		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dressed up all night, there's no one to impress
Standing in lines 'til I smell like cigarettes
I don't know why my friends are so obsessed
With staying up 'til we're sober, wasting money on regrets
I lost my jacket, about to lose my mind
'Cause it's 5AM and I got work at 9
I'm all alone heading for the exit signs
From the minute that I saw you, I started thinking twice

There's something 'bout you
You steal the room
I can't believe I've never seen nobody, nobody like you
I'm freaking out just, tryna play it cool
I can't believe I've never seen nobody, nobody like you

Nobody like, nobody, no, nobody like you
No, no, nobody
Nobody like, nobody, no, nobody like you (I don't know nobody, nobody like)
Nobody, no, nobody like you
No, no, nobody
Nobody like, nobody, no, nobody like you
I don't know nobody like

Fuck it, I'll stay 'til I'm the last one left
For one chance to say, "You're different than the rest"
We're face to face, tryna get it off my chest, yeah
The lights are going out here, wanna come to mine instead?

There's something 'bout you
You steal the room
I can't believe I've never seen nobody, nobody like you
I'm freaking out, just tryna play it cool
I can't believe I've never seen nobody, nobody like you

Nobody like, nobody, no, nobody like you
No, no, nobody
Nobody like, nobody, no, nobody like you (I don't know nobody, nobody like)
Nobody, no, nobody like you
No, no, nobody
Nobody like, nobody, no, nobody like you
I don't know nobody like

There's something 'bout you
You steal the room
I can't believe I've never seen nobody, nobody like you
I'm freaking out, I'm tryna play it cool
I can't believe I've never seen nobody, nobody like you

Nobody, nobody like you
Nobody, nobody like you
Nobody, nobody like you
I don't know nobody like you
Nobody, nobody like you
Nobody, nobody like you
Nobody, nobody like you
I don't know nobody like you

Nobody like, nobody, no, nobody like you
No, no, nobody
Nobody like, nobody, no, nobody like you (I don't know nobody, nobody like)
Nobody, no, nobody like you
No, no, nobody
Nobody like, nobody, no, nobody like you
I don't know nobody like
