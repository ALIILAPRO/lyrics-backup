		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  ever knew someone could make me feel  like you do
Cause it´s true
You got me prayin´ that this love is real
All I need, is you with me
Cause there´s something about the way you smile I like
Something I don´t know
I´d give anything to be with you tonight
cause I can´t let go

All  I wanna do is get with you
Take a little time get next to you
Let´s get it on, let´s get it on
All I want now is you and me
You and I are meant to be
Let´s get it on, let´s get it on

So many times I've looked into your eyes and all I see
Is the love for me
But if you took some timeto realise
you could be, the one for me baby
Cause there´s something about the way you smile I like
Something I don´t know
I´d give anything to be with you tonight
cause I can´t let go

All  I wanna do is get with you
Take a little time get next to you
Let´s get it on, let´s get it on
All I want now is you and me
You and I are meant to be
Let´s get it on, let´s get it on

You be the honey that I never coukd forget
And got me trippin out
you got me thinking ´we were set
I thought that we would always be together  you and me
Remember thinking that  you´ve got to be my destiny
Can´t you see that I know that I was wrong  in what I did
But If you take me back
I know that we could try  again
And I´m gonna keep on calling keep on hitting with my charms
Until the day you finally take me back into your  arms
Take it back now

Cause there´s something about the way you smile I like
something I don´t know
I´d give anything to be with you tonight
cause I can´t let go

All  I wanna do is get with you
Take a little time get next to you
Let´s get it on, let´s get it on
All I want now is you and me
You and I are meant to be
Let´s get it on, let´s get it on
