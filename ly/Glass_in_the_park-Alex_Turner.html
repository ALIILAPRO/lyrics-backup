		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's glass in the park
Darling, I can't help but keep making appointments
To sweep beneath the climbing frame

If the sun's in your eyes,
I'll tighten your blindfold, baby
Don't worry your foot won't get cut
Strut carelessly

And when you say that you need me tonight
I can't keep my feelings in disguise
The white parts of my eyeballs illuminate

And I'll wait for you
As if I'm waiting for a stone to stop
I've heard them talking
About how I'm gonna put you off

There's glass in the park
And now that I'm up off my knees
I've picked up the speed
To jump your palaces

And I shoot through the night
And suddenly all those once lost concoctions froth
And chase the day away

When you say that you need me tonight
I can't keep my feelings in disguise
The white part of my eyeballs illuminate

And I'll wait for you
As if I'm waiting for the stone to stop
I've heard them talking
About how I'm gonna put you off

You tell me, "How can I put you off, when you're a matter of urgency?"
I've got a million things that I need to do, but they're all secondary
Make sure you're not followed
Meet me by the Death Balloon

Paraselene woman, I'm your man on the moon
And like a grain of diamond dust, you float
And my devotion's outer crust cracks
