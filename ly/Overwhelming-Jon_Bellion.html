		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, I think I got one
Her soul is presidential like Barack, son
Yeah, she call me Goose, I call her Maverick 'cause of Top Gun
They say we annoying, they just jealous cause we got love
Yeah, I got a hot one
She don't want a problem if there's not one
But people come around and try some stupid shit to start one
She give you the people's fuckin' elbow like The Rock, son

There is a potion in your lips, so sweet, I'd die
There is an ocean in your hips, so deep, I'd dive
I hear an opus when we kiss that completes my life
Yeah, I think I got one
And every single little thing about her is so

Overwhelming
Everything about you is so overwhelming
When I think about you, it gets overwhelming
'Cause everything about you is so overwhelming
Come over here and overwhelm me

"Hey, do I impress you?"
I really like the way you rock a sweatsuit
When you working out and I'm just watching how your legs move
They would think that you was, like, developed in a test tube
You deserve a theme song
You could be the shoulder that I lean on
Love it when you're late for work and try to slip your jeans on
You be bumping Chili Peppers all up in your Nissan

There is a potion in your lips, so sweet, I'd die
There is an ocean in your hips, so deep, I'd dive
I hear an opus when we kiss that completes my life
Yeah, I think I got one
And every single little thing about her is so

Overwhelming
Everything about you is so overwhelming
When I think about you, it gets overwhelming
'Cause everything about you is so overwhelming
Come over here and overwhelm me

You write checks that my ass can't cash
I bit a little more than I can chew
I bit a little more than I can chew
You write checks that my ass can't cash
I bit a little more than I can chew
I bit a little more than I can chew
'Cause everything about you is so

Overwhelming
Everything about you is so overwhelming
When I think about you, it gets overwhelming
'Cause everything about you is so overwhelming
Come over here and overwhelm me
