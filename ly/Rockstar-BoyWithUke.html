		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I just wanna be an all-star
Run five hundred yards
Rockstar life, buying luxury cars
I want a Bentley, want a nice Porsche
I want a whip with butterfly doors
Grammy and a billion views
Enough money to afford nice shoes
Girlfriends and a golden goose and a golden tooth, man, what about you?

I just wanna go back to my room
I don't want the fame, I just want you

I wish I was famous, nobody knows me
I do the same shit, do what they tell me
I had dreams that I'm livin' in the hills
I'm chillin' with my homie Rick Ross, payin' bills
They call me faceless, I need a facelift
Radio stations hate on my playlist
One day, I'ma shoot a shot at Mars
Fall into its orbit, let me fall into your arms

I just wanna go back to my room
I don't want the fame, I just want you
I just wanna go back to my room, my room
I don't want the fame, I just want you, want you

And I've tried doin' all that I can
I'll walk to Japan
If it means that I won't fall
Off, bite my own tongue just to say
For the numbers I made
I feed it like an animal
Popped off, full of all this love (I don't wanna)
Girl, go, though it won't take much (I don't wanna)
Change clothes since we're so damn close (I just wanna)
Go home, baby, fuck this show

I just wanna go back to my room, my room
I don't want the fame, I just want you, want you
I just wanna go back to my room, my room
I don't want the fame, I just want you, want you

Forget everything I ever wanted
All I want is to see your eyes
Feel the weight of the stones in my pockets
I just want you to know I'm fine
