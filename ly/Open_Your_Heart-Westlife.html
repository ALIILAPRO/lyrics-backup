		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I didn't mean yo let you down
You have to believe it 
I don't know what went
Through my mind
But now I can see

That I waited too long
To tell you how much it matters
Just to be right here with you 
But I couldn't think of anything better 
I should have told you so

Baby open your heart
Won't you give me a second chance
And I'll be here forever
Open your heart
Let me show you how much I care
And I will make you understand
If you open your heart
To love me once again

I'll try to make it up to you
I want you to know
Baby I swear that I'll be true
And never let go
If I waited too long
To tell you how much it matters
Just to be right here with you 
But I couldn't think of anything better 
I should have told you so

Baby open your heart
Won't you give me a second chance
And I'll be here forever
Open your heart
Let me show you how much I care
And I will make you understand
If you open your heart
To love me once again

We could relive this pain and sorrow
But we better do it in time
Start over here and save tomorrow
I want to make you mine

Open your heart with a chance
And I'll be here forever
Open your heart and I'll care
And I will make you understand
Oh baby
If you open your heart 
To love me once again

Baby open your heart
Won't you give me a second chance
And I'll be here forever
Open your heart
Let me show you how much I care
And I will make you understand
If you open your heart
To love me once again
