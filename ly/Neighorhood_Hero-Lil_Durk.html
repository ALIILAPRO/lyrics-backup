		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Smokin' your dead homie
Facts
Gas

I know a bitch who do whatever for some Valentinos (Oh)
I'm with the killers, goin' to BET inside the Vino (Let's get it)
Man, my city was goin' crazy, rest in peace to Chino (Chino)
And free that nigga Meech 'cause he the hood hero (Uh, hero)
Don't gotta prove no point, nigga, we know (Oh yeah, we know)
And wherever that drama at, we go (We go)
(You know, you know) We the neighborhood heroes
(We know, we know) We the neighborhood heroes

That street shit
We don't reply to niggas with that tweet shit (Facts)
Beef shit, nigga said fuck me, he don't mean it (Pussy)
Sweet shit, foenem caught a body, they gon' beat it
Defense, Glock to his face, he won't eat it (Brr)
All facts, nigga snaked me once and I'ma fall back (Let's get it)
Nigga say he my brother, but he snaked me, what you call that?
I cheated on my BM three times with my dog ass
She gave her number, I delete it, 'cause they all rats
Chiraq, where the police don't call backup
Last nigga played with Durkio, he in a backwood
Chicago niggas play with PnB, but ain't no matchup
If you know me like you know me, where I'm from, I'm not a rapper
Burglar, scammer, a murderer, I'm handsome
When I'm off the drugs, I swear I'm steady throwin' tantrums
Angelo told me once before, he want a Phantom
I can't say no 'cause that's my son, I gotta answer

I know a bitch who do whatever for some Valentinos (You know)
I'm with the killers, goin' to BET inside the Vino (You know)
Man, my city was goin' crazy, rest in peace to Chino
And free that nigga Meech 'cause he the hood hero
Don't gotta prove no point, nigga, we know (We know)
And wherever that drama at, we go (Oh, oh)
Oh, we the neighborhood heroes (We the neighborhood heroes)
We the neighborhood heroes

They say we won't get help unless Obama do it (Turn up)
Don't get shot in my areas, ain't no trauma unit (Let's get it)
If you a snake and they ain't do, just know the opps'll do it (Know the opps'll do it)
And go and drill, this the best time 'cause the opps into it (Brr)
I still sleep around the savages like I ain't rich
You talkin' to me about your homie, that's that fake shit (Turn up)
The city ain't never played my songs, shoutout to Nephets
Just take that watch up of your arm 'fore we take it (Yeah, yeah)
And we the reason for your dead niggas
Breadwinners, when you hit that stain you ain't share with us
Fuck the Instagram, this reality
I know a nigga talk straight cash, and he ain't got a G
They had my momma usin' WIC when we in poverty
And I was tired of eatin' Kix, but she know I gotta eat
Stop lyin', stop tellin' niggas you gon' ride for me
Stop lyin', stop tellin' niggas you gon' die for me

I know a bitch who do whatever for some Valentinos
I'm with the killers, goin' to BET inside the Vino
Man, my city was goin' crazy, rest in peace to Chino
And free that nigga Meech 'cause he the hood hero
Don't gotta prove no point, nigga, we know
And wherever that drama at, we go
Oh, we the neighborhood heroes
We the neighborhood heroes
