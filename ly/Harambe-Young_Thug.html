		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mafia!
Yeah, peep game, bitch, you know what I'm sayin'?
Level up! Yeah
Like a game

Catch 'em down bad
Beat 'em with a bat, hashtag that
I call it New Jack, yeah, yeah
Bitch, I got a blue Jag
I make that cash talk
I got a new house
You wanna get in, need a passcode nigga
Two twenty five on the dashboard, nigga
Stack it up and until you get that foreign, nigga
Stack it up and and then take care of your daughter, nigga
Stack it up and take care of your son, nigga
Stack it up and take care of that money
You know I ran it all up by myself
And now your bitch drinkin' cum nigga
My diamonds yellow like a corn nigga
Double R at the prom nigga
Skrt, skrt skrt
Got some hitters all of 'em my cuz nigga
Girl I know you love me
Love me, I know, I know you love me
You love me

Bentley with a nigga, bear killer nigga, back it up
Bands kill a nigga, fast wheel a nigga, back it up
Ape shit nigga, Godzilla, nigga, act up
Don't let your chick go Godzilla, bae, back it up
I just wanna have sex
I just wanna have a baby by you, girl
I just wanna go crazy about you, girl
Don't make your nigga act crazy over you, girl
Ayy, 'cause you know I will
And I'm on a perky pill

This shit can get ugly for you
I pull up and bust your mama
I pull up and bust your brother
I aim at your fuckin' family
I aim at your whole clique
I aim at your mothafuckin' mama
I aim at your fuckin' dad
I aim at your daughter, son, nigga
I aim it at everything
I aim at the bag
I got devil inside of me
Got the devil inside me
God tryna provide me
God tryna decide
Do we wanna leave the assignment?
Um okay I know you're frustrated 'bout a nigga and
Every time I take you through
I know I did a lot of sinnin'
I hope you still let me make it through
Just 'cause I got me a spot in LA
That don't mean I'mma change the crew
My bitch trying to figure out
How she can tell me to chill without changin' you
Fuck it, I'm changin' up on 'em
But my fans, not changin' on 'em
Makin' a band, I'm sangin' on 'em
Whip out that bag, syringin' on 'em
Hey, we lock that bitch out with no passcode
I bought her summer doors
Damn, she already had 'em though

Bentley with a nigga, bear killer nigga, back it up
Bands kill a nigga, fast wheel a nigga, back it up
Ape shit nigga, Godzilla, nigga, act up
Don't let your chick go Godzilla, bae, back it up
I just wanna have sex
I just wanna have a baby by you, girl
I just wanna go crazy about you, girl
Don't make your nigga act crazy over you, girl
Ayy, 'cause you know I will
And I'm on a perky pill
