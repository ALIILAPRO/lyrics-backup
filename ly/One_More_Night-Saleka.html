		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Meet me in the hotel lobby
At midnight
I'm in my red dress just for you

Waited for you at the party
I've lost sight 
Done all I said I wouldn't do

And I cannot believe I'm crying, crying
After all the times I've played this game before
I cannot believe I'm trying, trying 

Thought we'd have one more night
Just one more night, before I said goodbye
Could you give me one more night
Just one more night, before I say goodbye

All you gotta do is say my name
I'll be there
I am powerless with you

I'm the only one that's left to blame
I don't care
Rewrite your requiem for two 

And I cannot believe I'm crying, crying
After all the times I've lost this game before
I cannot believe I'm trying, trying, ooh

Thought we'd have one more night
Just one more night, before I said goodbye
Could you give me one more night, just one more night
Before I say goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

Fire and greed 
Make their way to my soul 

I watch you leave
Then lay down on the cold floor 

One more night, just one more night
Before I say goodbye 
One more night, one more night
