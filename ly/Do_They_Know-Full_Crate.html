		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One, two, three, and

Do they know Paradiso all again?
Come so close just to be back in my head

Back to the future back to being sooner
I can't stay out of place, no more (one, two, three, and)

Do they know I hesitate before I press play 
Does it show? 
I hate that it's the buzz that I've craved 
But I'm trying 
I'm living in my light and I know the distance I'll go

Do they know that I cry that night (I cry that night)
I'm just trying to be more honest, yeah
Swear I've grown, I've grown so much
And I'm just trying to be less nice
No imposter, the truth will cost you
I can't spare no change sometimes
I will cross the water as I take my time
I'm begging you please don't judge

So please, please
Oh, please
See the best in me, me
