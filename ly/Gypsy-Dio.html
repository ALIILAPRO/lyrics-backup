		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She was straight from hell
But you never could tell
'Cause you were blinded by her light
She could crack your brain
With magic pain
And turn a paler shade of white

Well I was on the free
Just me and me
And just about to sail

When I heard the voice
Said you got a choice
The hammer or the nail

You'll be ridin'
You'll be ridin' on the gypsy
On the gypsy

Well I rolled the bones
To see who'd own
My mind and what's within

And it's a given rule
That we're all fools
And need to have a little sin

So I'm ridin'
Well I'm ridin' on the gypsy
On the gypsy queen

Well she was straight from hell
But you never could tell
'Cause you were blinded by the light

So she cracked my brain
With magic pain
And turned my left around to right, right

So I'm ridin'
I'm still ridin'
Yes I'm ridin' on the gypsy
On the gypsy queen
She's mean
