		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is not for your cries
This is all for your lies
Listen out for your mind
You're killing me over love
Dadada

Your kisses are the only doubt
I listen out from your lies oh
Dadada

Don't drown your heart, oh, baby
Just breathe, don't drown your heart
Just breathe, don't drown your heart, oh, baby
Just breathe, don't drown your heart
Just breathe, don't drown your heart, oh, baby
Just breathe, don't drown your heart
Just breathe, don't drown your heart, oh, baby
Just breathe, don't drown your heart

Tell me all the dreams you found
Sing me all the songs you love
Can I sing them with you now
You're killing me over love
Your kisses are the only doubt
I listen up from your lies oh
Dadada

Don't drown your heart, oh, baby
Just breathe, don't drown your heart
Just breathe, don't drown your heart, oh, baby
Just breathe, don't drown your heart
Just breathe, don't drown your heart, oh, baby
Just breathe, don't drown your heart
Just breathe, don't drown your heart, oh, baby
Just breathe, don't drown your heart

Just breathe, don't drown your heart, oh, baby
Just breathe, don't drown your heart
Just breathe, don't drown your heart, oh, baby
Just breathe, don't drown your heart
