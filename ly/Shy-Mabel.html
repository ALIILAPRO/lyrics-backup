		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Say what you need
Wanna be that girl for you
Uh-huh (uh-uh, uh-huh, uh-huh)
Yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah)

Demon time strikes, one o'clock
You tried to call me but you ain't speaking up
Boy, why are you so afraid, 'fraid? 
Can't you see we're on the same page, page? (Ah)
Say what you need, I can be that girl for you
Do anything for you, but we still gotta do it my way, my way
You gots to get on my wave, my wave

You're used to the kind (the kind) that play hard to get (hard to get)
Please know I'm not here to mess with your head
See, I want it just like you do
Hurry up, make your move
'Cause if you could read my mind, you'll find

You ain't gotta be shy, shy-la-la-la-la
You ain't gotta be shy, shy-la-la-la-la
You ain't gotta be shy, shy-la-la-la-la
Baby, say what you need
Wanna be that girl for you

(Got to have your love, love, love)
Ah yeah, yeah, yeah
(Got to have your love, love, love)
Ah yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm being straight up, ain't got no time for pretense
I want you, so that's my right to defend
Don't worry 'bout what your crew say, say (yeah)
Be a man about it, be brave, brave (oh)

You're used to the kind (the kind) that play hard to get (hard to get)
Please know I'm not here to mess with your head (mess with your head)
See, I want it just like you do (just like you do)
Hurry up, make your move (make your move)
'Cause if you could read my mind, you'll find

You ain't gotta be shy, shy-la-la-la-la
You ain't gotta be shy, shy-la-la-la-la
You ain't gotta be shy (you ain't gotta be), shy-la-la-la-la
Baby, say what you need
Wanna be that girl for you (Wanna be that girl for you)
You ain't gotta be shy, shy-la-la-la-la (shy)
You ain't gotta be shy (no), shy-la-la-la-la (no)
You ain't gotta be shy, shy-la-la-la-la
Baby, say what you need (say)
Wanna be that girl for you (wanna be that girl for you)

Be that girl for you, whoa
'Cause I want it just like you do, mmm
Hurry up, make a move
'Cause if you could read my mind, you'd find I

(Got to have your love) Yeah
Ah yeah, yeah, yeah
(Got to have your love, love, love)
You ain't gotta be shy
(Got to have your love, love, love)
Shy, ah
Baby, say what you need
Wanna be that girl for you
