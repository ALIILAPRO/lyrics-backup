		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't need your sympathy
There's nothing you can say or do for me
And I don't want a miracle
You'll never change for no one

And I hear your reasons why
Where did you sleep last night?
And was she worth it
Was she worth it?

'Cause I'm strong enough
To live without you
Strong enough
And I quit crying
Long enough
Now I'm strong enough
To know
You gotta go
There's no more to say
So save your breath and
Walk away
No matter what I hear you say
I'm strong enough
To know
You gotta go

So you feel misunderstood
Baby, have I got news for you
On being used, I could write the book
But you don't wanna hear about it

'Cause I've been losing sleep
And you've been goin' cheap
And she ain't worth half of me it's true
Now I'm telling you

That I'm strong enough
To live without you
Strong enough
And I quit crying
Long enough
Now I'm strong enough
To know
You gotta go

Come hell or waters high
You'll never see me cry
This is our last goodbye, it's true

I'm telling you
Now I'm strong enough
To live without you
Strong enough
And I quit crying
Long enough
Now I'm strong enough
To know
You gotta go
There's no more to say
So save your breath and
Walk away
No matter what I hear you say
I'm strong enough to know
You gotta go

Now I'm strong enough
To live without you
Strong enough
And I quit crying
Long enough
Now I'm strong enough
To know
You gotta go
(There's no more to say)
(So save your breath and)
(Walk away)
(No matter what I hear you say)
(I'm strong enough to know)
