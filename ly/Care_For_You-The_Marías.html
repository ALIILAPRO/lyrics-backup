		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby, I care for you
But don't let me in
Maybe I'll lie
To keep them away from you
But don't let me in
Don't let me die

'Cause only if I ever believed
I wanted to run naturally
Then I wouldn't say a prayer for you
Just to show you that I care for you
I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know

Baby, I care for you
So don't make me go dancing alone
I'll wait by the stairs for you
Wrapped up in smoke
Laughing alone

'Cause only if I ever believed
I wanted to run naturally
Then I wouldn't say a prayer for you
Just to show you that I care for you
I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know
