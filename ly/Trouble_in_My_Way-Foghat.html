		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Trouble in my way, trouble in my way,
Only the darkness can ease the pain,
Only the shadows hide my shame.

Standin' in the rain, standin' in the rain,
Look at the people drivin' home,
I'm so tired of bein' alone.
Oh I know, yes I know trouble in my way.

Give me one more chance, give me one more chance,
I'll tell you something you're bound to hate,
Maybe tomorrow will be too late.

Trouble in my way, trouble in my way,
Only the darkness can ease my pain,
Only the shadows hide my shame.
Oh I know, yes I know trouble in my way.

Trouble in my way, trouble in my way,
Trouble, trouble in my way.
Oh I know, yes I know trouble in my way.

{Rod - Slide Solo}
Oh I know, yes I know trouble in my way,
Oh I know, yes I know trouble in my way.

Mmm - Hey-ee-yea-ee-yea
Oooh-hoo-ooh-hoo-yeah yeah ....
