		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So you face it with a smile
There is no need to cry
For a trifle's more than this
Will you still recall my name?
And the month it all began?
Will you release me with a kiss?

I never took that bill against my will
There was a void I had to fill
You I thought would understand
That there's nothing in this world that's coming first
The only road I know is curved
But I keep walking straight ahead

Now you shaped that liquid wax
Fit it out with crater cracks
Sweet devotion, my delight
Oh, you're such a pretty one
And the naked thrills of flesh and skin
Would tease me through the night

Well I hate to leave you bare
If you need me, I'll be there
Don't you ever let me down
Dazed by careless words
Cozy in my mind

I never took that bill against my will
There was a void I had to fill
You I thought would understand
That there's nothing in this world that's coming first
The only road I know is curved
But I keep walking straight ahead

And I touched your face
Narcotic mind of lazed Mary-Jane
And I called your name
Like an addicted to cocaine
Calls for the stuff he'd rather blame
And I touched your face
Narcotic mind of lazed Mary-Jane
And I called your name
My cocaine

I don't mind it, I think so
I will let you go
I don't mind it, I think so
I will let you go

I don't mind it, I think so
I will let you go
