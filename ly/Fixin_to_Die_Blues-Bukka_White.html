		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Feelin' funny in my mind Lord, I believe I'm fixin' to die
Feelin' funny in my mind Lord, I believe I'm fixin' to die
Well I don't mind dyin' but I hate to leave my children cryin'

Well look over yonder, to that buryin' ground
Look over yonder, to that buryin' ground
Sure seems lonesome, Lord when the sun goes down

Feelin' funny in my eyes Lord, I believe I'm fixin' to die, fixin' to die
Feelin' funny in my eyes Lord, I believe I'm fixin' to die
Well I don't mind dyin' but I hate to leave my children cryin'

Well there's black smoke risin' Lord, it's risin' up above my head, up above my head
Well there's black smoke risin' Lord, it's risin' up above my head
Can you tell Jesus, "Make up my dyin' bed"

Well I'm walkin' kinda funny Lord, I believe I'm fixin' to die, fixin' to die
Yes I'm walkin' kinda funny Lord, I believe I'm fixin' to die
Fixin' to die, fixin' to die
Well I don't mind dyin' but I hate to leave my children cryin'
