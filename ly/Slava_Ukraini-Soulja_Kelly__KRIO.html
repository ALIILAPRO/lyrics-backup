		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Europe must wake up now
Europe's largest nuclear power plant is on fire
Right now Russian tanks are firing upon nuclear units
Baby, I've been thinking 'bout you always
Dreaming of our love from the first day
Baby, I've been thinking 'bout you always
Dreaming of our love from the first day
Look
I moved to the west cos shit went crazy
Thank you lord you saved me
Whole lotta pain but I woke up in Hungary
Shoutout to my friends my love and family
Yo
I speak for the street
All we want is peace
I pray Ukraine get all they need
God please save our people in the east
My people need food
My people need water
My people need shelter
And a way to get to the boarder
Damn
I got soo much pain in my heart
All this shit is sad
I pray they all make it out
Baby, I've been thinking 'bout you always
Damn
Dreaming of our love from the first day
This is some real life shit
Baby, I've been thinking 'bout you always
Y'all make sure you check up on your love ones
Dreaming of our love from the first day
We all got one life to live
Peace
Peace
