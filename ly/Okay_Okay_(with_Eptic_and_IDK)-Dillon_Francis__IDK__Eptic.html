		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Woo
Uh-huh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh-huh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Everybody got aim with the thang
Uh-huh, uh, uh, uh

Me and the gang dodgin' all the lames
Callin' all the shots when I pull up in the Range
'Bout to catch a body, I do that shit in vain (swish)
Don't care about your opinion, we ain't on the same team, like woo

Everybody tryna aim for your spot
But can't nobody win when you Kobe with the shot, ayy
Hit 'em like the 808, expire with no day or date
Think that they can take my place, I hit 'em like, "Okay, okay"

Can't get on my, get on my level
Get on my, get on my level
Tell me where you at, we known to push shit back (okay)
Can't get on my, get on my level
Get on my, get on my level
Tell me where you at, we known to push shit back

I cannot complain 'bout people tryna be up where I'm at
If you have a problem tryna understand, well, here are facts
Made a couple mil' from a few big deals
I never been in love, told Cupid chill
Mess with my people, they come with the pressure
We put 'em in dirt like we buryin' treasure
Like UGK, want the more, not the lesser
You went to the cops and they forced you to fess up
Can't be yourself, so they force you to dress up
Hand on a hand with the contact like bless up
Fake with the three, then I send it below (word)
Makin' my point like a free throw (uh-huh)
Who is for real? Hell if I know (word)
I point to the door and tell 'em to go (uh-huh)

Everybody tryna aim for your spot
But can't nobody win when you Kobe with the shot, ayy
Hit 'em like the 808, expire with no day or date
Think that they can take my place, I hit 'em like, "Okay, okay"

Can't get on my, get on my level
Get on my, get on my level
Tell me where you at, we known to push shit back (okay)
Can't get on my, get on my level
Get on my, get on my level
Tell me where you at, we known to push shit back (okay)
