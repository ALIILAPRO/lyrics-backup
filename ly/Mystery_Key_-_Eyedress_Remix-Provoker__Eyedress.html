		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Verse)
Guarding a secret I'll say none of
Wounding me as I lie
Where will I send her now
She can’t live in my mind

I’m well on my way
Come to REZ look me dead in the face
Do u feel a way
More to lose than to ever gain

(Chorus)
Mystery key
You’ll never see
from the beginning it's only been eyes for me 
Nothing to say
take to the grave
Inside is something I can never give away

(Verse)
Passing faces in the street
Smile through my teeth
Only occasional
I like feeling deceit

Lock it in a safe
Put the key in the hole turn away
Im feeling a way
Better lose than to never gain


(Chorus)
Mystery key
You’ll never see
From the beginning it's only been eyes for me 
Nothing to say
Take to the grave
Inside is something I can never give away

(Outro)
To be alone
I got my way
I played along
But no that shit is not enough 
Call bluff
Soon enough
Your love coming my way
My luck
Sure enough
Your love coming my way
