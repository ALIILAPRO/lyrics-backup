		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tilling my own grave to keep me level
Jam another dragon down the hole
Digging to the rhythm and the echo of a solitary siren
One that pushes me along and leaves me so

Desperate and ravenous
I'm so weak and powerless
Over you

Someone feed the monkey while I
Dig in search of China
White as Dracula as I approach the bottom

Desperate and ravenous
I'm so weak and powerless
Over you

Little angel go away
Come again some other day
The devil has my ear today
I'll never hear a word you say
He promised I would find a little solace
And some piece of mind
Whatever just as long as I don't feel so

Desperate and ravenous
I'm so weak and powerless
Desperate and ravenous
I'm so weak and powerless
Over you

Over you
