		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The only rule is, get on your feet
I don't wanna see nobody heating up their seat
And if you believe it, if you're 'bout it
No matter where you're from
The apple don't fall from it

Now people wanna know when they see us dancing
Wanna know how we got those moves
People wanna bottle it up, up, up, up, up but no can do
People wanna know how to find that feeling
Wanna know how we got that groove
They're thirsty for the juice but I'ma tell you the truth

Ooh, it runs in my family
Ooh, it runs in my family
It's all about you and me

Any color, it doesn't matter
The way it's shining on the inside it's all that matter
A different mama, a different mister
Talk your talk and walk your walk and know I'm right there with you, and

People wanna know when they see us dancing
Wanna know how we got those moves
People wanna bottle it up, up, up, up, up but no can do (but no can do)
People wanna know how to find that feeling
Wanna know how we got that groove
They're thirsty for the juice but I'ma tell you the truth

Ooh, it runs in my family
Ooh, it runs in my family
It's all about you and me

Ooh, it runs in my family
Ooh, it runs in my family
It's all about you and me

Ooh, it runs in my family
Ooh, it runs in my family
It's all about you and me

People wanna know when they see us dancing
Wanna know how we got those moves
People wanna know how we got that feeling
Wanna know how we got that feeling (it's all about you and me)
People wanna know when they see us dancing
Wanna know how we got those moves
People wanna know how we got that feeling
Wanna know how we got that feeling (it's all about you and me)

People wanna know when they see us dancing
Wanna know how we got those moves
People wanna know how we got that feeling
Wanna know how we got that feeling (it's all about you and me)
People wanna know when they see us dancing
Wanna know how we got those moves
People wanna know how we got that feeling
Wanna know how we got that feeling (it's all about you and me)

People wanna know when they see us dancing
Wanna know how we got those moves
People wanna know how we got that feeling
It's all about you and me
