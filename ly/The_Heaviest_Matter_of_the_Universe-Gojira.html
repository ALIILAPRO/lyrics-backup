		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lay down, fall away

Lie awake
Just cannot move my arms and legs, I'm paralyzed
Don't recall how to free myself from this
In the heart of the dark
My face contorted, don't know how to reach the light
But I feel so bad, like a freak in a cage

Open the door
Enter your heart
You go

So far

Golden unworldly silence
Space flight at speed of light
I cross the clouds and colors
The black hole is calling me
Slide on the horizon
On the frontier not to cross

Black dwarf
Time's gone distorted
In the heart of the dark
A whirl of light

Enter in the realm of nothingness
I feel the cold, my eyes are shut
My fear is slowly dying
Light-years from here are my thoughts and cages
I can hear their moan
But now a long deep breath is calling

Overtaking time
And now understanding space
I feel united
I do cross light, I feel the living
Here in the centre stands the light of love
That never can be touched from greater silence shall return
