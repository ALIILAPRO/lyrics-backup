		  Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah
Oh, yeah

Cherimoya, I been waitin' all season for you
Haven't seen nothin' like you before (before)
Can you help bring me back to normal? (To normal)

You're my favorite one (you're my favorite one)
You're the rarest one (you're the rarest one)
How could I go back just for a temporary satisfaction? (Oh)

You've always been real good to me (good to me)
My cherimoya is so sweet (okay, okay, so sweet, so sweet)
All the best things come naturally (naturally)
Thought I'd find your ass only on the beach
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh

Now I'm nourished
Where you been all this time? Are you foreign?
Nothin' commonly found in the stores
Could compare to what I'm enjoyin'

You're my favorite one
You're the rarest one (you're the rarest one)
Why would I go back just for a temporary satisfaction?

You've always been real good to me (good to me)
My cherimoya is so sweet (okay, okay, so sweet, so sweet)
All the best things come naturally (naturally)
I'ma eat your ass right up on the beach (ayy)
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
