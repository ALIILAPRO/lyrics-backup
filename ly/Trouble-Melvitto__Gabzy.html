		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I just want to show you off, build you up
Baby say the word and I’m pulling up
Cause I’m addicted ted to your touch
You got me lifted can’t get enough

He did you wrong girl I’ll never do that
Even if Rihanna called I’ll never choose her
Don’t want no drama I’ll let you do what you want
With me you’ll never cry just let me prove that

Your friends say I’m trouble
I’m just trying to clear my name
Your friends say that I’m trouble
Tryna to show you better things

Your friends say that I’m trouble
I know you don’t feel the same
Your friends say that I’m trouble
They shouldn’t lie

I know he hurt you he did you dirty
Hе didn’t deserve you you didn’t dеserve it
But I’m different shorty
I know you heard it before trust me
Want to ride for you til’ the end
Want to hold you down be your man
And I’m telling you shorty
I’m different trust me

Because you see me with the goons don’t mean I’m one too
Those are my guys been with them from school
I’m kind of stuck tell me what do I do
It’s either them or you and I want to know oh oh oh oh
Are you riding for me like I’m riding for you
Baby girl your loving got me in a chokehold
Cause I don’t even want to be a player no more

Your friends say I’m trouble
I’m just trying to clear my name
Your friends say that I’m trouble
Tryna to show you better things
Your friends say that I’m trouble
I know you don’t feel the same
Your friends say that I’m trouble
They shouldn’t lie

I know he hurt you he did you dirty
He didn’t deserve you you didn’t deserve it
But I’m different shorty
I know you heard it before trust me
Want to ride for you til’ the end
Want to hold you down be your man
And I’m telling you shorty
I’m different trust me

When I’m with you it’s like the world stops girl
When I’m with you I know I know oh oh oh oh
I just wanna treat you right
Keep you fly change your life
Let me take your pain away
Take away your rainy days rainy days

Your friends say I’m trouble they be lying baby
I’m just trying to clear my name they be hating baby
Your friends say that I’m trouble want to be you baby
Tryna to show you better things that’s why they single baby

Your friends say that I’m trouble they be hating on you
I know you don’t feel the same they be lying baby
Your friends say that I’m trouble they just want to be like you
They shouldn’t lie they be trying baby

I know he hurt you he did you dirty
He didn’t deserve you you didn’t deserve it
But I’m different shorty
I know you heard it before trust me
Want to ride for you til’ the end
Want to hold you down be your man
And I’m telling you shorty
I’m different trust me I won’t do you like that that

Pull up on you anytime you call my phone
Always on my mind girl you bust my dome
Take care of you when something’s wrong
I will listen to your problems all night long

And anything you want girl for you I’ll do
Make life simple like two times two
Fine no pimples no one like you
Out of all the girls there it’s you I choose
