		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You know I'm back, and I'm gonna push that pedal down
So take a seat in my ride and let the good times roll
You better don't look back, we'll be up and away
We don't waste no time, hold on tight to me

Every step I take ('cause I wanna)
Keeps me wide awake ('cause I wanna)
We're crossing the lines, chasing a life that we won't survive
Pushing it up, getting higher again until the sun will rise

Back in the game like a hurricane, I'm moving forward and the
Good times follow me, good times follow me
And I won't fit inside your frame, still moving forward 'cause the
Good times follow me, good times follow me
Good times follow me, good times follow me
And I won't fit inside your frame, still moving forward 'cause the
Good times follow me, I got my friends

And a backpack full of wishes and I
Have been gone for longer I know, but I'm back, there's a reason why
I try to keep all those moments and the good time ahead
But all they do is slipping through my fingers like sand

Every step I take ('cause I wanna)
Keeps me wide awake ('cause I wanna)
We're crossing the lines, chasing a life that we won't survive
Pushing it up, getting higher again until the sun will rise

Back in the game like a hurricane, I'm moving forward and the
Good times follow me, good times follow me
And I won't fit inside your frame, still moving forward 'cause the
Good times follow me, good times follow me
Good times follow me, good times follow me
And I won't fit inside your frame, still moving forward 'cause the
Good times follow me

Right now it's time to take a break
Before we hit the final stage
So let me hear you say
One (everybody say) 
Two (everybody say) 
Three (everybody say) 
Get the fuck up

Crossing the lines, chasing a life that we won't survive
Pushing it up, getting higher again until the sun will rise

Back in the game like a hurricane, I'm moving forward and the
Good times follow me, good times follow me
And I won't fit inside your frame, still moving forward 'cause the
Good times follow me, good times follow me
Good times follow me, good times follow me
And I won't fit inside your frame, still moving forward 'cause the
Good times follow me, good times follow me
