		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's just another night
Just another fight for my life
It's alright, because everything dies
Nobody know why
Wetin I go do?
Wetin you go do
When you feelin' like you're fallin'
And you can't find nothing to hold on to?

Memories, uh-oh, carry me go
Carry me go, oh-na, yeah
Sick and tired of it all, take me far away
Mr. DJ, gbemi trabaye
Now I no fit trust anybody
Na hin make I no fit shout

My body don dey tire, eh
E make me madder, eh
My head don scatter, eh
My Holy Father, eh
My body don dey tire, eh
E make me madder, eh
When my whole world is set on fire
Don't leave me alone

Wetin you go do?
Wetin you go do
When you're feelin' like you're screaming really loud
But nobody hears you?
I see it in your eyes
I see in your eyes the betrayal and the lies
You've been pullin' out knives from your behind

Count every blessin'
Count every lesson
You fit no dey tomorrow
So I count every second
Don't let them take my head
And dance over my dead
Body, yeah
Body, yeah
I'm weak, I'm blind
Give me the strength I need for my body, eh, body, eh

My body don dey tire, eh
E make me madder, eh
When my whole world is set on fire
Don't leave me alone

Don't leave me, don't leave me
Don't leave me, don't leave me
Don't leave me, don't leave me, oh God
Don't let me go down, don't let me go down
As far as I can see, na the memories
Dem dey carry me from reality
No require visa, I have been
Very quietly dyin'
And I need you to remind me why
Give me the strength to keep fightin'
'Cause I no fit trust anybody
Na hin make I no fit shout

My body don dey tire, eh
E make me madder, eh
My head don scatter, eh
My Holy Father, eh
My body don dey tire, eh
E make me madder, eh
When my whole world is set on fire
Don't leave me alone
