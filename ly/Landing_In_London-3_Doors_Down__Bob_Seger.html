		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I woke up today in London
As the plane was touching down
And all I could think about was Monday
Maybe I'd be back around
If this keeps me way much longer
I don't know what I would do
You got to understand it's a hard life, 
That I'm going through

[Chorus]
And when the night falls around me
And I don't think I'll make it through
I'll use your light to guide the way
All I think about is you

L A is getting kind of crazy
And New York is getting kind of cold
I keep my head from getting lazy
I just can't wait to get back home

And all these days I spend away
I'll make up for this I swear
I need your love to hold me up
When it's all to much to bear

[Chorus]

And all these days I spend away
I'll make up for this I swear
I need your love to hold me up
When it's all to much to bear

And when the night falls around me
And I don't think I'll make it through
I'll use your light to guide the way

All I think about is you

[Chorus]
