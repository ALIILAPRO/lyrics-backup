		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She was the meanest cat
In old chicago town
She was the meanest cat
She really moved them down
She had no heart at all
No no no heart at all

She was the meanest cat
Oh she was really tough
She left her husband flat
He wasn't tough enough
She took her boys along
''cause they were mean and strong

Ma ma ma ma ma baker she taught her four sons
Ma ma ma ma ma baker to handle their guns
Ma ma ma ma ma baker she never could cry
Ma ma ma ma ma baker but she knew how to die

They left a trail of crime
Across the u.s.a.
And when one boy was killed
She really made them pay
She had no heart at all
No no no heart at all

Ma ma ma ma ma baker she taught her four sons
Ma ma ma ma ma baker to handle their guns
Ma ma ma mama baker she never could cry
Ma ma ma mama baker but she knew how to die

She met a man she liked
She thought she'd stay with him
One day he formed with them
They did away with him
She didn't care at all
Just didn't care at all

Here is a special bulletin.
Ma baker is the fbi's most wanted woman.
Her photo is hanging on every post office wall.
If you have any information about this woman,
Please contact the nearest police station

Don't anybody move! the money or your lives!
One day they robbed a bank
It was their last foray
The cops appeared too soon
They couldn't get away
And all the loot they had
It made them mighty mad
And so they shot it out
Ma baker and her sons
They didn't want to hang
They died with blazing guns
And so the story ends
Of one who left no friends

Ma ma ma mama baker she taught her four sons
Ma ma ma mama baker to handle their guns
Ma ma ma mama baker she never could cry
Ma ma ma mama baker but she knew how to die

Ma ma ma mama baker she taught her four sons
Ma ma ma mama baker to handle their guns
Ma ma ma mama baker she never could cry
Ma ma ma mama baker but she knew how to die
