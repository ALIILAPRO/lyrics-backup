		  Fear something again
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Fear something again
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

Fear something again
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Fear something again
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

Reject, are you no one? Feel you nothing?
You know, I'll bet you think you have a good reason
To be living in the limelight
Of the fortunate ones

You're too weakened by the poison that they feed you
In the living lie, they don't believe you
Call to no one, trust in nothing
Little impotent one

I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be innocent, you know
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna let them hypnotize me

Punk-ass, are you listening? Can you hear me?
Or are you deaf and dumb to my language?
Do the real words seem to hurt you?
Well, put 'em up, motherfucker

Gonna feel it when I stamp it on your forehead
So you will never forget that you're a reject
And you're no one, and you're nothing
Little impotent one

I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be innocent, you know
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna let them hypnotize me

I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be, I don't want innocence, you know
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna let them hypnotize me

Fear awaken
Go with it now and let it overcome you
Fear awaken
Your mind is racing

I don't understand why you don't like me
Why don't you like me? Am I so different from you?
Now, does it scare you that I'm able to discern
What to love and what to burn?
I'll add your fuel to the fire now

Stand back, brother, take your hand back, leave it and I might crack
More than a smile or two, you see
You don't judge what you don't understand
You can't deny what has been given to me

I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be innocent, you know
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna let them hypnotize me

I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be, I don't want innocence, you know
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna let them hypnotize me

Fear awaken
Go with it now and let it overcome you
Fear awaken
Go with it now, go with it now

Go, fear awaken
Go with it now and let it overcome you
Fear awaken
Your mind is racing

Erasing now

Hey, reject, are you no one? Feel you nothing?
You know, I'll bet you think you have a good reason
To be living in the limelight
Of the fortunate ones, you know
