		  D-D-Daytrip took it to ten (hey)

Ayy, Panini, don't you be a meanie
Thought you wanted me to go up
Why you tryna keep me teeny? I
It's a dream, he wished it on a genie
I got fans finally, ain't you wantin' them to see me? I

I thought you want this for my life, for my life
Said you wanted to see me thrive, you lied

Just say to me what you want from me
Just say to me what you want from me
Baby, let's go, uh

Okay, this song right here remind me of my ex
Say I be declinin' all her calls 
And I don't respond to none of her texts
I be like, "Girl, hush your mouth
You know I ain't got time for nothin' but sex"
She know I injured my right hand
So when I get behind I use my left
She watched that Walker Texas Ranger 
Say I remind her of Nas X
I'm talkin' Old Town Road, all my hoes down low
They like girls and I like girls
Three at a time, sometimes four
And if my backend not all hundreds
And ain't no time, then I don't go, I be like

Say to me what you want from me
Just say to me what you want from me (what you want?)

Ayy, Panini, don't you be a meanie
Thought you wanted me to go up
Why you tryna keep me teeny now?
Now they need me, number one on streaming
Oh yeah, you used to love me
So what happened, what's the meaning? I

I thought you want this for my life, for my life
Said you wanted to see me thrive, you lied

Now when it's all done, I get the upper hand
I need a big Benz, not another fan
But I still want you as a fan
I'ma need to sit down, don't mean to make demands
But I need you to...

Say to me what you want from me
Just say to me what you want from me

D-D-Daytrip took it to ten (hey)
