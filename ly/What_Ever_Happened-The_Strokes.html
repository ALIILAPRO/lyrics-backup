		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wanna be forgotten
And I don't want to be reminded
You say, "Please don't make this harder"
No, I won't yet
I wanna be beside her
She wanna be admired
You say, "Please don't make this harder"
No, I won't yet

Oh dear, is it really all true?
Did they offend us and they want it to sound new?
Top ten ideas for countdown shows
Whose culture is this and does anybody know?
I wait and tell myself, life ain't chess
But no one comes in
And yes, you're alone
You don't miss me, I know

Oh Tennessee, what did you write?
I come together in the middle of the night
Oh, that's an ending that I can't write
'Cause I've got you to let me down

I wanna be forgotten
And I don't want to be reminded
You say, "Please don't make this harder"
No, I won't yet
I wanna be beside her
She wanna be admired
You say, "Please don't make this harder"
No, I won't yet
