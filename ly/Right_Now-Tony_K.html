		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We can take the party back to my place
Sipping on Azul, keep it Clase
Tryna keep cool, but my thoughts say
We can kick it, I'ma score like Mbappé

Right now
We could fuck around and leave the spot now (now, now)
We could fool around and hit the spot now (now, now)
Tell me if you're down and we could ride out
Waste no time

I need a bad one like you
Hit you when I'm lonely come through
Know what we gon' do
Turn the lights down low
Play yo favorite song
You can sing along
You could hit them notes
Yeah, yeah
Take you out them clothes
Yeah, yeah
Take it nice and slow
Yeah, yeah
Escapades in the late night (late night)
We can kick it 'til it's daylight (daylight)

We can take the party back to my place
Sipping on Azul, keep it Clase
Tryna keep cool, but my thoughts say
We can kick it, I'ma score like Mbappé

Right now
We could fuck around and leave the spot now (now, now)
We could fool around and hit the spot now (now, now)
Tell me if you're down and we could ride out
Waste no time

You the trophy I'm in first place (first place)
Keep sipping, we gon' turn this into Fifty Shades
Flawless (yeah)
Got me falling (what?)
Body on display, I take it all in, yeah
Let's get into it, no more stalling
You the peak
You know you elite
Dirty, dirty thoughts of
You on top of me
We can leave the spot, turn it up a few degrees

We can take the party back to my place
Sipping on Azul, keep it Clase
Tryna keep cool, but my thoughts say
We can kick it, I'ma score like Mbappé

Right now
We could fuck around and leave the spot now (now, now)
We could fool around and hit the spot now (now, now)
Tell me if you're down and we could ride out
Waste no time

A couple minutes you'll be topless (topless)
Know you soaking I'ma dive in (dive in)
Slip and slide got me gliding (gliding)
You bring the cake I'll bring the icing (icing)
Yeah, if you need more
I'll hit the seafloor
Get my rocks off
Come off at the seashore
Then repeat
Yeah, you a meal, I'ma feast
Got an appetite you can appease (appease)

We can take the party back to my place
Sipping on Azul, keep it Clase
Tryna keep cool, but my thoughts say
We can kick it, I'ma score like Mbappé

Right now
We could fuck around and leave the spot now (now, now)
We could fool around and hit the spot now (now, now)
Tell me if you're down and we could ride out
Waste no time
