		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How much of myself can I give away
'Til there's nothing left to take from me?
Feels like I'm losing things I can't replace
It's an emptiness that makes me weak

'Cause I built you up
You just break me down
When I'm alone
I can hear the sound
I just can't stand the way you said my name

I can hear you say it
Joe, Joe, Joe
Don't you ever leave
I can hear you say it
Joe, Joe, Joe
'Cause you're nothing without me

'Cause this is not a ship that could pass in the night
It's a wreck and I'm drowning, I've been here all my life
I was eighteen and screaming and feeling it all
Now I'm up on the edge of a bridge and I know

If I let you down
Would you let me in?
'Cause when I'm alone
I could hear you now
I just can't stand the way you say my name

I can hear you saying
Joe, Joe, Joe
Don't you ever leave
I can hear you saying
Joe, Joe, Joe
'Cause you're nothing without me
Yeah, you were always saying
Joe, Joe, Joe
Don't you ever leave
I can still hear you saying
Joe, Joe, Joe
'Cause you're nothing without me

'Cause you're nothing without me
Nothing without me
I don't know what it takes to be happy, yeah
I think I'm petrified of dying
But living's just too hard to walk it, if I've tried
Look in the mirror see me crying
But every time I do I hear you say my name

I can hear you saying
Joe, Joe, Joe
Don't you ever leave
Yeah, you were always saying
Joe, Joe, Joe
'Cause you're nothing without me (I still hear you saying)
I can hear you saying
Joe, Joe, Joe
Don't you ever leave (I still hear you saying)
Joe, Joe, Joe
'Cause you're nothing without me
Yeah, you are nothing without me
