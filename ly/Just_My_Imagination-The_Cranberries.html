		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There was a game we used to play
We would hit the town on Friday night
Stay in bed until Sunday
We used to be so free
We were living for the love we had
Living not for reality

Just my imagination (my imagination)
Just my imagination (my imagination)
Just my imagination
It was
Just my imagination
Just my imagination (my imagination)
Just my imagination
It was

That was a time I used to pray
I have always kept my faith in love
It's the greatest thing from the man above
The game I used to play
I've always put my cards upon the table
Never be said that I'd be unstable

Just my imagination (my imagination)
Just my imagination (my imagination)
Just my imagination
It was
Just my imagination
Just my imagination (my imagination)
Just my imagination
It was

There is a game I like to play
I like to hit the town on Friday night
And stay in bed until Sunday
We'll always be this free
We will be living for the love we have
Living not for reality

It's not my imagination (my imagination)
Not my imagination (my imagination)
Not my imagination
It was
Not my imagination
Not my imagination
Not my imagination
It was

Not my, not my, not my, not my 
Not my, not my, not my, not my 
It was
Not my, not my, not my, not my 
Not my, not my, not my, not my 

(My imagination, my imagination)
(My imagination, my imagination)
(My imagination, my imagination)
(My imagination, my imagination)
It was

Not my, not my, not my, not my 
Not my, not my, not my, not my 
It was
Not my, not my, not my, not my 
Not my, not my, not my
