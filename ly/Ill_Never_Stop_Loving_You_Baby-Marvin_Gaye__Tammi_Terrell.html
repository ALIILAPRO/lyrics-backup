		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's a spark inside my heart
That sets my soul on fire and keeps the flame inside me
Oh burning Marvin

Baby, just like the glow from out the night
When you're near, I feel all right
Somethin' inside me keeps me yearnin', oh baby

I'll never stop lovin' you baby, no no no no
I'll never stop lovin' you, Marvin, no no no no

Near to you, I'm sure I'll rhyme
Every dream that's passed through my mind
Simply because your love makes me believe

Near to you, I feel so strong
And I know I can right any wrong
Lovin' you gives me the power that I always need

I'll never stop lovin' you baby, no no no no
I'll never stop lovin' you, Marvin, no no no no

Oh baby, right from the start, you showed you cared
Every moment that we ever shared
Has brought me one step closer, oh to you
That one day, honey, since we met
Have you surely one reason to regret?
Givin' my love to you, dear, and I'll never leave you

I'll never stop lovin' you baby, no no no no
I'll never stop lovin' you, Marvin, no no no no
Tammi, I'll never stop, stop
No no no no
I'll never stop lovin' you, no no no no
