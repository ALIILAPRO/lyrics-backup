		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fill these spaces up with days
In my room you can go you can stay
I can't sleep I can't speak to you
Now these years locked in my drawer
I'll open to see just to be sure
I can't sleep I can't speak to you
And so I'm reaching out for the one

And so I've learned the meaning of the sun
And all this like a message comes 
To shift my point of view
I'm watching through my own light 
As it tints the shade of you
Hold my wine hold it in
Nobody's lost but nobody wins
