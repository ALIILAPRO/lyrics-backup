		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Under the water
It's cold and it's grey
My torrid autumn
Another season decays
Open up the hollow
And my walls come down
I'll tell you it's a problem
Just when no one's around

But then
I know what's wrong
God you complicated everything
I know you're gone, gone, gone
This is where I will draw my line
I will draw my line

Burning my cathedrals
'Cause I don't pray anymore
Look at all these people
These tragic little people
They're smiling and they don't know what for

But then
I know what's wrong
God you complicated everything
I know you're gone, gone, gone
This is where I will blur my line
I will blow my line

Our houses are haunted
Torn and deserted
They're made of my secrets and shame
Baby I want it
But I know I'm not worth it
I can't even sell you my name

But then
I know you're wrong
God, you took it all away from me
I know you're gone, gone, gone
This is where I will cross my line
I am crossing my line
