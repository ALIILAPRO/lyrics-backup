With the little horn over there

Wanna eat, got to get

Now, Fred, you know
Hey, Fred Thomas, brother

In order for me to get down
I got to get in deep

In order for me to get down

Need to get in deep
Down deep, down deep

Get on down
You like these
Think about making the big M

Lookie here, lookie there
You see over there
You better sing one word for us
What we gotta do

We gotta have a
Funky good time, oh, yeah
We gotta have a
Funky good time, oh, yeah

We gotta have a
Funky good time
We gotta have a
Funky good time
We gotta take you higher

Wait a minute, now
Who you say that was over there
Familiar looking cat
I know I seen him somewhere

Is that Maceo
He's doing everything over there
Maceo, is it who
Maceo, you know like
Maceo, won't you blow
Oh, yeah, Maceo
