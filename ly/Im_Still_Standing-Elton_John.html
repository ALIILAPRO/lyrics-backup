		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You could never know what it's like
Your blood, like winter, freezes just like ice
And there's a cold, lonely light that shines from you
You'll wind up like the wreck you hide behind that mask you use

And did you think this fool could never win?
Well look at me, I'm a-coming back again
I got a taste of love in a simple way
And if you need to know while I'm still standing 
You just fade away

Don't you know I'm still standing better than I ever did?
Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
And I'm still standing after all this time
Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind

I'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)

Once I never coulda hoped to win
You starting down the road, leaving me again
The threats you made were meant to cut me down
And if our love was just a circus, you'd be a clown by now

You know I'm still standing better than I ever did
Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
And I'm still standing after all this time
Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind

I'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)

Don't you know that I'm still standing better than I ever did?
Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
And I'm still standing after all this time
Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind

I'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)

I'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)

I'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm still standing
