		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It blows the night 
It's just the start 
I'm not surprised 
They shoot us all 

We like to keep 
Some places wild 
Like battlefields 
Where no one fights 

The road that we share 
The air that we breathe 
The treasures we hide 
Here and there 

The ashes of love 
The signals of hate 
The planes and the crumbling sky

And if someone comes and shows up at the door 
No one will be there to answer anymore 

We have it on tape now 

It blows the night 
It's just the start 
I'm not surprised 
They shoot us all 

We like to keep 
Some places wild 
Like battlefields 
Where no one fights 

A planet was born
A building decayed 
We lifted a ton
Overhead 

What everyone knows 
But never admits
We'll play by the rules 
This time 

But if someone calls or shows up at the door
No one will be there to answer anymore
We have it on tape now

It glows at night
It's just a start
I'm not surprised
It shook us up

We like to keep 
Some places wild 
Like battlefields 
Where no one fights 

It glows at night
It's just a start
We're holding on
We're staying strong

We won't collide
We won't divide
We like to keep
Some places wild
