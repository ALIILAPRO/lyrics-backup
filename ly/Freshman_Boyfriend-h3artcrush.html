		  RAWrrr get me fuckedup

Omg yea i wish i was ur
Boyfriend ur such a dam slut
Yea i wish i was important
All u like is seniors
Too bad were both freshmen
Yea that pussys fresh man
Running in my head when

U tease ur a cup breasts and
Ur liftin up ur skirt and ur push up bra
Is so fucking perfect
I know that u got class
And u said that were just friends
But i need u to want me as freshman boyfriend

All my friends are on amphetamine
U think that u are better than me hrt
In the scene all my friends are questioning
Middle school that was rad
We were lovebirds till the end
King and queen me and u
U don't even know what u do when u
Tease ur a cup breasts and
Ur liftin up ur skirt and ur push up bra
Is so fucking perfect
I know that u got class
And u said that were just friends
But i need u to want me as freshman boyfriend
When u tease ur a cup breasts and
Ur liftin up ur skirt and ur push up bra
Is so fucking perfect
I know that u got class
And u said that were just friends
But i need u to want me as freshman boyfriend

Rawrr nanana
