		  Do you think you're better off alone?
Do you think you're better off alone?
Do you think you're better off alone?
Do you think you're better off alone?
Talk to me, ooh
Talk to me
Talk to me, ooh
Talk to me
Do you think you're better off alone?
Do you think you're better off alone?
Do you think you're better off alone?
Do you think you're better off alone?
Do you think you're better off alone?
Do you think you're better off alone?
Talk to me, ooh
Talk to me
Talk to me, ooh
Talk to me
Talk to me
