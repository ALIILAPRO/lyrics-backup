		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  (Sa-la-la-la sick of the silence)
(Sa-la-la-la sick of the silence)

When I shut my eyes it's a big commotion
And when I close the blinds there's a mouth that opens
It says look at your life, sucker, you're just floating
I say fa-la-la-la motherfucker, I'm not listening
Oh no no, oh no no

'Cause I'm so sa-la-la-la sick of the silence
(Sa-la-la-la sick of the silence)
I get so sa-la-la-la sick of the silence
(Sa-la-la-la sick of the silence)
Because I'm terri-la-la-la-fied of what's inside of it
(Terri-la-la-la-fied of what's inside of it)
Yeah, I get so sa-la-la-la-la-la sick of the silence
That I have to, that I have to just scream

(I don't wanna hear what's deep inside of me)

And so I wrap my head around a holy mantra
I'm thinking, oh my god, what a chatty creature
It just kept talking and talking and talking all around in a circle
I said, "Hey, little guy, I think it's time to go now"
Let it go now, let it go

'Cause I'm so sa-la-la-la sick of the silence
(Sa-la-la-la sick of the silence)
I get so sa-la-la-la sick I feel violent
(Sa-la-la-la sick of the silence)
Because I'm terri-la-la-la-fied of what's inside of it
(Terri-la-la-la-fied of what's inside of it)
Yeah, I get so sa-la-la-la-la-la sick of the silence
That I have to, that I have to just scream

For I fear to hear what's deep inside of me
Oh, I scream

(I don't wanna know what's buried underneath)

That's why I'm sa-la-la-la sick of the silence
(Sa-la-la-la sick of the silence)
Yeah, sa-la-la-la sick of the silence
(Sa-la-la-la sick of the silence)
Because I'm terri-la-la-la-fied of what's inside of it
(Terri-la-la-la-fied of what's inside of it)
Yeah, I get so sa-la-la-la-la-la sick of the silence
That I have to, that I have to just scream

Because I la-la, tra-la-la, la-la-la
Tra-tra, tra-la-la, la-la-la
Because I la-la, tra-la-la, la-la-la-la-la
That I have to, that I have to just scream
