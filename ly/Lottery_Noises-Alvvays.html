		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Pretty quiet out here, it's abundantly clear
That no one's been coming for me
No encouraging sounds, helicopters or hounds
In the time that's allotted for thee

Now that you're around
Take another shot
Now that you're around
Take another look

Lucky sevens align while I'm riding the pine
And I'll always be looking for ways
To remember the sound of the lottery noises
That I can't believe rang for me

Now that you're around
Take another shot
Now that you're around
Take another look

Now that you're around (I want you to take a shot)
Take another shot (I won't shoot you down)
Now that you're around (I want you to take a shot)
Take another look (I won't shoot you down)
(I want you to take a shot, I want you to take a shot)

Now that you're around (I want you to take a shot)
Take another, take another look (I won't shoot you down)
Now that you're around (I want you to take a shot)
Take another shot (I won't shoot you down)
Now that you're around (I want you to take a shot)

(I won't shoot you down, I want you to take a shot)
Now that you're around (I want you to take a shot)
(I want you to take a shot)
(I want you to take a shot)
(I want you to take a shot)
(I want you to)
