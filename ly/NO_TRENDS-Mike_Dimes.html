		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah (yeah)
Yeah, yeah (gang)
Yeah (yeah), yeah (yeah)
(Yeah) damn, uh (yeah)

Dollar sign, dollar sign
Yeah, I get that shit (get that shit)
Without them dollar signs
Let's see how far your bars gon' get (let's see how far your bars gon' get)
Don't do no features 'less I know you, got no price on this (run it)
This Double Lamb got no OG (nigga)
Just throw a beat and I'ma eat, man (nigga)

Nigga, I don't do no beatbox, leave your feet hot
That nigga runnin' like a track star right out them Reeboks (on God)
There's no more parties for your shorty but she still gon' be a thot
Bet that bitch gon' make it clap to find a nigga with some guap

With your broke-ass, your BD ain't got no cash, ho
We counted big bucks before I saw that TikTok, ho
Your favorite rapper probably waitin' on the next trend, ho
I'd rather get it out the mud before you help me, ho
That boy Mike Beezy, he don't rock with me, there ain't no stoppin' me
I seen them pop up out the cut when fans start uppin' all my streams
I remember ain't nobody used to talk about my heat (on God)
I remember everything, I never throw away receipts

Nigga, I don't do no beatbox, leave your feet hot
That nigga runnin' like a track star right out them Reeboks (on God)
There's no more parties for your shorty but she still gon' be a thot
Bet that bitch gon' make it clap to find a nigga with some guap

Oh, I see they catchin' felons on me (whoa, God)
If you see Kemp, just put the billy on it, got the city on it
I was ridin' in that Civic, homie, probably with a shorty
Now, I never like to kick it, everybody keep recording
Go by two things in my lifestyle, Gang, money and lose niggas (on gang)
Everything start gettin' better
You gon' see they ain't even cool with ya (gang)
Bad bitches tryna fool with 'em (yeah)
I don't want nothin' to do with 'em (yeah)
Fake love, tryna make amends (yeah)
Just 'cause of that lil' bitty trend on TikToks

Beatbox, leave your feet hot
That nigga runnin' like a track star right out them Reeboks
There's no more parties for your shorty but she still gon' be a thot
Bet that bitch gon' make it clap to find a nigga with some guap

Nigga, I go by dollar sign, dollar sign, yeah, I get that shit (yeah)
Without them dollar signs, let's see how far your bars gon' get (yeah)
Don't do no features 'less I know you, got no price on this (on God)
This Double Lamb ain't got OGs
Just throw a beat and I'ma eat, lil' nigga (Mike Dimes)
