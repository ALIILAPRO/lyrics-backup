		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Go baby, go baby, go baby
Hope that God forgives your sins, your sins, your sins, your sins
Go baby, go baby, go baby
Gotta keep moving on even though you're not here, not here, not here, not here
Go baby, go baby, go baby
Hope that God forgives your sins, your sins, your sins, your sins
Go baby, go baby, go baby
Gotta keep moving on even though you're not here, not here, not here

Lost your hope again
Still looking for a friend
Have to go and face what's inside
I just hope that you never stop trying (stop trying, never stop trying) ooh

Go baby, go baby, go baby
Hope that God forgives your sins, your sins, your sins, your sins
Go baby, go baby, go baby
Gotta keep moving on even though you're not here, not here, not here, not here
Go baby, go baby, go baby
Hope that God forgives your sins, your sins, your sins, your sins
Go baby, go baby, go baby
Gotta keep moving on even though you're not here, not here, not here

Love, I need you to know you are special
Love, I need you to know you are special
Love, I need you to know you are special
Love, I need you to know you are special

Go baby, go baby, go baby
Hope that
