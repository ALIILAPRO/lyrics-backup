		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Why am I mad? I don't get it
It seems like every time you give me signs, and I miss it
I did it again
I admit it
I left you standing there, and now I regret it

Seems like every time I get the chance
I lose my cool and I blow it
And I get all tongue tied
Lost in your eyes
I'm a fool and I know it

I should've kissed you
I should've told you
Told you just how I feel
And next time I won't stop
I'll listen to my heart
'Cause what I feel is real

I should've kissed you
I should've told you how I feel
I should've kissed you
I should've showed you just how I feel

No I did not
Give you my two cents
A million reasons why I should have
And it makes no sense
So here I am by myself again
Stopping for green lights and I know
I wanna be more than friends

How come every time I get the chance, I lose my cool and I blow it
And I get all tongue tied, lost in your eyes
I'm a fool and I know it, hey

I should've kissed you
I should've told you
Told you just how I feel
And next time I won't stop
I'll listen to my heart
'Cause what I feel is real

I should've kissed you
I should've told you how I feel
I should've kissed you
I should've showed you just how I feel

So I turned the car around
And you were right where I left you
And your smile said you were feeling me too
And the moon shone bright 'cause when your lips met mine
And yeah I finally got it right
I'll be leaving with you tonight
And I won't have to say

I should've kissed you
I should've told you
Told you just how I feel
And next time I won't stop
I'll listen to my heart
'Cause what I feel is real

I should've kissed you, girl
I should've showed you how I feel
I should've kissed you
I should've showed you just how I feel

Girl, I should've kissed you
I should've told you, told you just how I feel
And this time I won't stop
Until I have your heart
'Cause what I'm feeling is real
