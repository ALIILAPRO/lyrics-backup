		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's a fire burning all around you
And I get this feeling, there's nothing more that I can do
Can't escape it even if I ever wanted to
So swim in the day, swim in the night, swim in the wrong or right
Cuz I won't just start it, I need your frequency
And you need somebody, body, body

There's a spirit haunting me, and it shows
Captivated over me, now I know
Yeah, yeah you feel this way forever
I only feel it when she tremors
Tremors, tremors, tremors, tremors
Feel it when she tremors

This is a shade of blue that don't fade lightly
The sun started from you're incandescent energy
Standing like you're up and wishing right in front of me
To swim in the day, swim in the night, swim in the wrong or right
Cuz I won't just start it, and I need your frequency
And you need somebody, body, body

There's a spirit haunting me, and it shows
Captivated over me, now I know
Yeah, yeah you feel this way forever
I only feel it when she tremors
Tremors, tremors, tremors, tremors
Feel it when she tremors
Tremors, tremors, tremors, tremors
Feel it when she tremors

Save my soul
Save my soul for the devil in you
Take it all, I can't lose, lose
I can't lose
Now, now, now

There's a spirit haunting me, and it shows
Captivated over me, now I know, oh
Yeah, yeah you feel this way forever
I only feel it when she tremors
Tremors, tremors, tremors, tremors
Feel it when she tremors
Tremors, tremors, tremors
I only feel it when she tremors
