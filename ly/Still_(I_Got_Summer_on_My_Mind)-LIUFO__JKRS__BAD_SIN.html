		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got summer on my mind
Nowhere else though
Lord take me downtown or to you
People show me love but I can't take it
What I said was true real pain, can't fake it.                                      Summer on my mind
Nowhere else though
Lord take me downtown or to you
People show me love but I can't take it
What I said was true real pain, can't fake it.                                                         I got summer, summer 
I got summer, summer 
I got summer, summer 
I got summer, summer 
I got summer on my mind
Nowhere else though
Lord take me downtown or to you
People show me love but I can't take it
What I said was true real pain, can't fake it. 
Summer on my mind
Nowhere else though
Lord take me downtown or to you
People show me love but I can't take it
What I said was true real pain, can't fake it.     
Summer on my mind
Nowhere else though
Lord take me downtown or to you
People show me love but I can't take it
What I said was true real pain, can't fake it.  
Still they wanna be with me
Still they wanna live with me
Still they wanna feel like me
Still I can't believe it's me      
Summer, summer 
I got summer, on my
I got summer, on my
I got summer, on my
I got summer on my mind   
Nowhere else though
Lord take me downtown or to you
People show me love but I can't take it
What I said was true real pain, can't fake it. 
I got Summer, summer 
I got summer, summer
I got summer, summer
I got summer, summer
I got Summer, summer 
I got summer, summer
I got summer, summer
I got summer, summer
I got summer on my mind
