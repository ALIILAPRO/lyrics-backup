		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's hard to hear your words
When you're so afraid to speak 'em
Somethings on your mind
But you're hiding it away

You say that we're going under
I say we still got each other

It breaks my heart that you can't let go
You say you're fine, but girl, I know
You've been dancing, dancing, dancing with your shadows

When the days get hard and your lights burn low
Don't go far, just hold me close
We'll go dancing, dancing, dancing with your shadows
Dancing with your shadows

If you're running through the woods
Yeah, I'll search all night to find you
When the wolves are at your door
I'm gonna drive them all away

You see ways we'll lose each other
I see you, I never wonder

It breaks my heart that you can't let go
You say you're fine, but girl, I know
You've been dancing, dancing, dancing with your shadows

When the days get hard and your lights burn low
Don't go far, just hold me close
We'll go dancing, dancing, dancing with your shadows
Dancing with your shadow

It breaks my heart that you can't let go
You say you're fine, but girl, I know
You've been dancing, dancing, dancing with your shadows

When the days get hard and your lights burn low
Don't go far, just hold me close
We'll go dancing, dancing, dancing with your shadows
Dancing with your shadows

Oh, yeah
Dancing with your shadows
