		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lately I've been thinking,thinking about what we had
And I know it was hard, it was all that we knew,yeah!

Have you been drinking, to take all the pain away?
I wish that I could give you what you deserve
'Cause nothing can ever, ever replace you
Nothing can make me feel like you do, yeah!

You know there's no one, I can relate to
I know we won't find a love that's so true

There's nothing like us
There's nothing like you for me
Together through the storm

There's nothing like us
There's nothing like you for me, together

I gave you everything babe
Well, everything I had to give
Girl, why would you push me away?

Lost in confusion, like an illusion
You know I'm used to making your day

But that is the past now, we didn't last now
I guess that this is meant to be

Tell me, was it worth it? We were so perfect
But baby I just want you to see

There's nothing like us
There's nothing like you for me
Together through the storm

There's nothing like us
There's nothing like you for me, together

There's nothing like us
There's nothing like you for me
Together through the storm

There's nothing like us
There's nothing like you for me, together
