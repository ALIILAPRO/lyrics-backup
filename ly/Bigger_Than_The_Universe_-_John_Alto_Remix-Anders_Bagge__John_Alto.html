		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm sitting here in my apple tree
There's a guiding light shining down on me
I can see the dawning of my life
Bigger than the universe
Just take my hand, put your trust in fate
Let us leave this world for a better place
A place where all the darkest days are gone
And everyone's a champion

Hear my heart is beating like a symphony
And every word is poetry
We are, we are
Reaching for the stars like satellites up in the sky
In a world of you and I
We are, we are
Bigger than the universe

As I'm sitting here in my apple tree
There's a rain of hope pouring down on me
I can see the sunrise of my soul
Bigger than the universe
Forever young, join the ride with me
There's an open road to eternity
We're dancing on the edge
We're wild and free

Hear my heart is beating like a symphony
And every word is poetry
We are, we are
Reaching for the stars like satellites up in the sky
In a world of you and I
We are, we are
Bigger than the universe (we are, we are, we are, we are)
Bigger than the universe
(We are, we are, we are, we are)
We are bigger than the universe
Ooh (we are, we are, we are, we are)
Oh, bigger than the universe
We are, we are
We are, we are
Bigger than the universe
We are, we are
