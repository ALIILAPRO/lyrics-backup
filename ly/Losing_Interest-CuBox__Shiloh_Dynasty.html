		  Losing interest
You won't find no better than this
I swear girl, if you leave
Just let me know so I won't look dumb
When you move on
Just, just let me

Losing interest
You won't find no better than this
I swear girl, if you leave
Just let me know so I won't look dumb
When you move on
Just, just let me

Losing interest
You won't find no better than this
I swear girl, if you leave
Just let me know so I won't look dumb
When you move on
Just, just let me

Losing interest
You won't find no better than this
I swear girl, if you leave
Just let me know so I won't look dumb
When you move on
Just, just let me

Losing interest
You won't find no better than this
I swear girl, when you leave
Just let me know so the pain won't hurt
When you
Just, just let me

Losing interest
You won't find no better than this
I swear girl, when you leave
Just let me know so the pain won't hurt
When you
Just, just let me

Losing interest
You won't find no better than this
I swear girl, when you leave
Just let me know so the pain won't hurt
When you
Just, just let me

Losing interest
You won't find no better than this
I swear girl, if you leave
Just let me know so I won't look dumb
When you move on
Just, just let me

Losing interest
You won't find no better than this
I swear girl, if you leave
Just let me know so I won't look dumb
When you move on
Just, just let me

Losing interest
You won't find no better than this
I swear girl, when you leave
Just let me know so the pain won't hurt
When you
