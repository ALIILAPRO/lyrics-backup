		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Free, free to be myself,
Free to need some time
Free to need some help
So I'm reaching baby, out
When I'm lonely in the crowd
When the signs get too loud
I'll be crashing on some couch
And even if I never forget you baby
Tonight I'm gonna let your memory baby
Go, always said I know

But at least I got my friends
Share a rain coat in the wind
They got my back until the end
If I never fall in love again
Well at least I got my friends
Like a lifeboat in the dark
Saving me from the sharks
Even though I got a broken heart
At least I got my friends, got my friends, got my friends
Well at least I got my friends

I don't wanna think, I just wanna feel
I just wanna dream, yeah
So pour another round
And throw it back until it's down
Let's get lost until it's found, again and again
And even if I never forget you baby
Tonight I'm gonna let your memory baby
Go, always said I know

But at least I got my friends
Share a rain coat in the wind
They got my back until the end
If I never fall in love again
Well at least I got my friends

Like a lifeboat in the dark
Saving me from the sharks
Even though I got a broken heart
At least I got my friends, got my friends, got my friends
Well at least I got my friends

And when the world is upside down, yeah
The sky is full of clouds yeah
They always come around, it feels like home, like home
And I never have to try, I can be myself and I
Never alone, I never feel alone
And even if I never forget you baby
Tonight I'm gonna let your memory baby
Go, always said I know

But at least I got my friends
Share a rain coat in the wind
They got my back until the end
If I never fall in love again
Well at least I got my friends
Like a lifeboat in the dark
Saving me from the sharks
Even though I got a broken heart
At least I got my friends, got my friends, got my friends
Well at least I got my friends
