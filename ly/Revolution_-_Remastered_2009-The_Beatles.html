		  Ah

You say you want a revolution
Well, you know
We all wanna change the world
You tell me that it's evolution
Well, you know
We all wanna change the world

But when you talk about destruction
Don't you know that you can count me out

Don't you know it's gonna be 
Alright
Alright
Alright

You say you got a real solution
Well, you know
We'd all love to see the plan
You ask me for a contribution
Well, you know
We all doing what we can

But if you want money for people with minds that hate
All I can tell you is brother, you have to wait

Don't you know it's gonna be
Alright
Alright
Alright
Ah

You say you'll change the constitution
Well, you know
We all wanna change your head
You tell me it's the institution
Well, you know
You better free your mind instead

But if you go carrying pictures of Chairman Mao
You ain't gonna make it with anyone anyhow

Don't you know it's gonna be 
Alright
Alright
Alright

Alright, alright
Alright, alright
Alright, alright
Alright, alright
