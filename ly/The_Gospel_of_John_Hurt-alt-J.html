		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No space
L-shaped
Tetris
Tile seeking
Somewhere
Oh somewhere
To fit in
Alien

(Come on) Oh, coming out of the woodwork
Chest bursts like John Hurt
Coming out of the woods

Ak
Twenty
4-7
Civilian

Oh, coming out of the woodwork
Chest bursts like John Hurt
Coming out of the woods

Coming out of the woodwork
Chest bursts like John Hurt
Coming out of the woods

Jeremiah
Looking down
And you know where you're looking on down
Do you know where you go
You're headed on the strings
For the E-X-T-I-N-C-T
Jeremiah
Looking down but you know where you're looking
But you go
Do you know where you go
You're headed on the strings
For the E-X-T-I-N-C-T

Oh, coming out of the woodwork
Chest bursts like John Hurt
Coming out of the woods

And oh, coming out of the woodwork
Chest bursts like John Hurt
Coming out of the woods

And oh, coming out of the woodwork
Chest bursts like John Hurt
Coming out of the woods

And oh, coming out of the woodwork
Chest bursts like John Hurt
Coming out of the woods

Oh, coming out of the woodwork
Chest bursts like John Hurt
Coming out of the woods

Oh, coming out of the woodwork
Chest bursts like John Hurt
Coming out of the woods
