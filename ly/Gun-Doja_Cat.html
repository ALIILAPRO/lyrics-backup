		  Here's a new position from the front (front, fr-fr-front)
Ain't gon' be no duckin' when ya bust (bu-b-b-bust)
Baby, I know how to use a gun (gun, gu-gu-gun)
I could make that dick go fuckin' gra-ta, ta-ta-ta
Here's a new position from the front (from the front now)
Ain't gon' be no fuckin' when ya bust (when ya bust now)
Baby, I know how to use a gun (bring that gun now)
I could make that dick go fuckin' gra-ta, ta-ta-ta (yeah, yeah, yeah)

I said James Dean, let me in them jeans
Put me on yo' hip and let me ride it 'til I cream (I said)
I just saw yo' girl and now we gotta flee the scene
Hide it in my pussy like you hide it in yo' sleeve
G (G), G (G), I'm a fuckin' G (come on, ay)
Take it like a thug and make you change your new white tee (said)
Better bite the bullet, baby, take one for the team
Put this pussy on it 'til you wake up from yo' dream (dream)
If that shit not workin' you could fire her, nigga (what?)
Shoot it down my throat, but with a silencer, nigga (what?)
I know that she mad but I don't vibe wit' her, nigga (what?)
If she talkin' shit then I'ma silence her, nigga (what?)

Here's a new position from the front (front, fr-fr-front)
Ain't gon' be no duckin' when ya bust (bu-b-b-bust)
Baby, I know how to use a gun (gun, gu-gu-gun)
I could make that dick go fuckin' gra-ta, ta-ta-ta
Here's a new position from the front (from the front now)
Ain't gon' be no fuckin' when ya bust (when ya bust now)
Baby, I know how to use a gun (bring that gun now)
I could make that dick go fuckin' gra-ta, ta-ta-ta (yeah, yeah, yeah)

Now assume new position, ayy
I been cravin' chickens, keep a tool in the kitchen, ayy
Stick it up me in the livin' room, here's your ticket, ayy
Jump on that machine and load the turret, give 'em friction, ayy
Cock it when I walk into the room, chk-chk
Aim, fire, when he behind it go boom
Let the trigger spray when these local women wanna woo
It don't hit the same, trust me I am into pain
Whip it, I don't feel a thing
Let's try some new positions, baby

Here's a new position from the front (front, fr-fr-front)
Ain't gon' be no duckin' when ya bust (bu-b-b-bust)
Baby, I know how to use a gun (gun, gu-gu-gun)
I could make that dick go fuckin' gra-ta, ta-ta-ta
Here's a new position from the front (from the front now)
Ain't gon' be no fuckin' when ya bust (when ya bust now)
Baby, I know how to use a gun (bring that gun now)
I could make that dick go fuckin' gra-ta, ta-ta-ta
