		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh yeah

Pangakong di mag-iisa
Kasama mo hanggang rurok
Ipikit ang yong mga mata

La la la la la
Ngayong nandito ka
Hindi inaasahang pangyayari ang nangyari
Mga labi nagtagpo
Punasan na ang mga luha
Ako ang lalayo sa 'yo

Hayaan mo na ilipad ka ng aking musika
Palayo sa mundo mong walang alam
Kundi pahirapan ka

Do you wanna fly
You could be my co-pilot
Let me put you in this flight
Make love in the sky or in another planet
Do you wanna fly
You could be my co-pilot
Let me put you in this flight
Make love in the sky or in another planet

Ready or not, we taking a trip
Fuck it, no luggage vacation it is
Ready to shop with money to blow?
Spend it on outfits, the runway a show
Fashionably late so it's too early to tell
Ask could this be fate then I'm burnin' it in hell
Not in heaven, this is penance
Cause you're learning it in jail
When the lesson is presented
Lord have mercy if we fail
We prevail through the yells all them mood swings bring
Make your mood ring bling 
The way your mood swings swing

Hayaan mo na ilipad ka ng aking musika
Palayo sa mundo mong walang alam
Kundi pahirapan ka

Do you wanna fly
You could be my co-pilot
Let me put you in this flight
Make love in the sky or in another planet
Make love in the sky or in another planet
