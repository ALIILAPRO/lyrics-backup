		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's a plane it's a bird 
it's God

Last year y'all was actin' mad funny (true)
This year you want all the cash money (jheeze)
I gotta go get the bag homie (bitch)
Talkin' but they keepin' tabs on me

I said B-I-G (big)
I'm a big big deal (deal)
Crawlin' on the floor she a Navy seal
I can't do the bubbly (woo)
I'ma sip the still (woo)
Got a free facial 'cause we us
We gettin' Jordan Peels (ay, go)

Fuck her, love her
Never cuff her
I'm a cold motherfucker
From the town, dick her down
Give it to her like no other
Bust a window, bust it in the
Eat that pussy up for dinner
Beat it up then eat it up (go, go)
She cancel plans for me to fuck

We finna make babies tonight, goo goo, ga ga
Fuckin' all these bitches all up out their chanclas
Mommy disappointed 'cause she want a Sarah (true)
I'm the African Darth Vader, baby, I'm your fada (jheeze)

It's my last night in New York let's maybe link up after
I'm exhausted but a Yerba's all it takes to start this chapter
The roof filled with stars, we yellin', "Who the fuck is NASA?"
You bat your eyes, so we fuckin at the after after, like

Last year y'all was actin' mad funny
