		  Oh, oh
Mmm hmm
Ow
That's right

She don't like it when it's cut n' dry
And don't like me makin' future plans
And don't want me tryin' to pin her down
She ain't about to give an inch of ground, no, woo

Well, she can take me for a little ride
But just as long as she drive me home
Around the block maybe once or twice
And then some lovin' wouldn't that be nice? Yeah

I won't but I want it
Oh, what a fool believes
I got her in my sight but just out of reach, oh, oh

Here we go around ('round, 'round)
Run, run, runaround ('round, 'round, 'round) 
Here we go around ('round, 'round)
She givin' me the runaround, yeah ('round, 'round, 'round)

Uh, a just enough to keep me hangin' on
She knows exactly what I need
And right down to the nick of time
I'm chasin' love down a fine, fine line

Ow, I won't but I want it
Oh, what a fool believes
I got her in my sight but just out of reach, whoa

Here we go around ('round, 'round)
Run, run, runaround, yeah ('round, 'round, 'round) 
Here we go around ('round, 'round)
She givin' me the runaround, ('round, 'round, 'round)
Oh ow

Yeah, hey yeah
Oh, yeah
Oh, ah, it goes like this
Listen baby, ssss, ooh, ow, ah, uh
Oh man, it's hard enough, yeah
And you make it harder
Ah, fill me up, I'm never satisfied
Own me, she owns it

Here we go around ('round, 'round)
Run, run, runaround, yeah ('round, 'round, 'round)
Here we go around, ('round, 'round)
She givin' me the run around ('round, 'round, 'round)

Here we go around, ('round, 'round)
Run, run, runaround, ('round, 'round, 'round)
Here we go around, ('round, 'round)
She givin' me the runaround, no ('round, 'round, 'round,) 

'Round and around
Oh, I like it, uh, I like it
Yeah, but I like it
Baby, say I like it
Uh, I said I like it
Oh, I like it
