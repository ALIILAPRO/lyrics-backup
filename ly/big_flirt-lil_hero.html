		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Love is always the thing in my face
My mind needs something to replace
I think of you and I isolate
Then the music gets going
So boy listen
The beat that's booming your area is my heartbeat banging my system
So please don't say that you're scared of us
It's a sweet spot if you listen but so hot when you didn't
Oo boy you better be joking
Oo boy you got to be kidding!
Big flirt
Big jerk
It works now I'm crazy for you
Berserk and sweeter in time
Dessert
I want you to melt with me
And in my world you're already head over
You fell for me
Boy I got big plans for you
All of them in involving me
So welcome to my world where all the sweet things just get better
When we get together it's candy coated with a surprise center
Big flirt
Big jerk
It works now I'm crazy for you
Berserk & sweeter in time
Dessert
I want you to melt with me
Melt with me
You're such tease
This back and forth is killing me
It's on my mind
It weighs heavy
When you're all alone do you think of me
Cause Lalaland is where I be
Locked up it a fantasy
Impatiently waiting you to chase and taste me too
