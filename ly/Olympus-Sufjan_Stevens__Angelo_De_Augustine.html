		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, lift up your head, boy
Don't play pretend dead on the floor
Now Harryhausen conceived from a cauldron
Wielding Olympus with eyes on the shore

There's nothing
There's nothing

Oh, show me the flow of my life
Bound by Acrisius bronzed from the skylight
Seeking the oracle's eyes in the night with a sigh
Seriphos greets us with moments of silence

There's nothing
How far away?
There's no place like home
There's nothing
How far away?
There's no place like home
There's nothing
How far away?
There's no place like home
There's nothing
How far away?
There's no place like home

Who will arrange my great escape?
Hopelessly, I have been torn from this outrage
Tossing and turning, uneasy, it cost me the cross
Am I at rest or resigned in my chaos?

There's nothing
How far away?
There's no place like home
There's nothing
How far away?
There's no place like home
There's nothing
How far away?
There's no place like home
There's nothing
How far away?
There's no place like home

There's something
And it's the light on your hand
There's something
And it's the touch of my wristband
There's one thing
And it's the weight of our wish
There's one thing
And it's our very first kiss
