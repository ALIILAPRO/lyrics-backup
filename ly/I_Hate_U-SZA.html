		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I be so sick of you niggas, y'all contradicting
I be so bored with myself, can you come and fuck me?
I feel so ordinary, 'cept when you around me
Treat me like corduroy, wear me out
Arguments, you air me out
Trippin' 'bout your whereabouts
I can't keep no conflict with you 
Boy, can we just rub it out?
I don't want no static with you, you know you my plug
And I can't shake this habit, no

I've been up, baby
Heavy reminiscin'
Heavy on the missin' you
Wish it was different than what it was (oh yeah)
I've been up, baby
Lost in the lie of us
Lost, ain't no findin' us
I've been up, baby

And if you wondered if I hate you (I do)
Shitty of you to make me feel just like this
What I would do to make you feel just like this
And if you wondered if I hate you (fuck you)
Shitty of you to make me feel just like this
What I would do to make you feel just like this

Used to be too solid 'til you scrambled me
Used to be your rider, you mishandle me
Used to be nonviolent 'til you ambushed me
Now I'm out here wildin' with you
Now I'm out here, silent treatment, that mean no permission (no)
Missionary gettin' borin', can you switch positions? (Yeah)
Hard to save your soul, you don't ever listen, no (no)

I've been up, baby
Heavy reminiscin'
Heavy on the missin' you
Wish it was different than what it was (oh yeah)
I've been up, baby
Lost in the lie of us
Lost, ain't no findin' us
I've been up, baby

And if you wondered if I hate you (I do)
Shitty of you to make me feel just like this
What I would do to make you feel just like this
And if you wondered if I hate you (fuck you)
Shitty of you to make me feel just like this
What I would do to make you feel just like this
