		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'll keep swingin' for the fences
It's like this heart is defenseless
Against the passion that's pumpin' through my veins
Blood, sweat, tears, it's a callin'
And if I can't walk, then I'm crawlin'
It might flicker, but they can't kill the flame

I can't stop I can't quit
It's in my heart It's on my lips
I can't stop, no I can't quit
It's in my heart, yeah I'm all in

'Til the wheels fall off
'Til the spotlight fades
I will lift your banner high
I will lift your banner high
And 'til the walls crash in
For the rest of my days
I'll lay it all on the line
'Til the day I die
'Til the day I die
'Til the end of the line
'Til the day I die
It's Your name I'll glorify

It's runnin' deeper than the ocean
This ain't religion, it's devotion
Three, six, five, every minute, everyday
So in the middle of the madness
They can stretch me out like canvas
But I ain't ever gonna fit in their frame

I can't stop I can't quit
It's in my heart It's on my lips
I can't stop, no I can't quit
It's in my heart, yeah I'm all in

'Til the wheels fall off
'Til the spotlight fades
I will lift your banner high
I will lift your banner high
And til the walls crash in
For the rest of my days
I'll lay it all on the line
'Til the day I 
'Til the day I die
'Til the end of the line
'Til the day I die
It's Your name I'll glorify

'Til I die and they put me in the coffin
Don't matter if I'm on the road or if I'm recordin'
Tell me what you think about me, that really ain't important
You know I'mma represent um, I ain't playin', can't afford to
I only got one life and I get it though
And this is not an act, not a movie, not a TV show
I don't know what quittin' means, I don't ever take it slow
You know I'm on the grind, me and Toby in the studio
Do it for the King, what you know about that?
Say you goin' harder, mmm I doubt that'
You say you doin' work, but you're asking where the couch at
How you doin' work when you asking where the couch at?
God is not a crutch, you can use Him when you wanna
You only look to heaven when you goin' through some drama
And when they goin' through some problems and that's the only time they call Him
I guess I don't understand that life, wonder why 'cause I'm all in
'Til the day I die

'Til the wheels fall off
'Til the spotlight fades
I will lift your banner high I will lift your banner high
And 'til the walls crash in
For the rest of my days
I'll lay it all on the line
'Til the day I ('Til the day I)
'Til the day I die
'Til the day I 
'Til the day I die
'Til the end of the line
'Til the day I ('till the day I)
'Til the day I, 'til the day, I fly
'Til the day I die
'Til the end of the line
