		  (Great John on the beat, by the way)

Look
I got a bag and they started treated me different
Love the way that I bag and I flip it
Gang get to wildin', we shoot up your district
Show no love for nobody who dissin'
You had your chance but you missed it
And I fell in love with the drippin'
Run up them bands and I'm goin' missin'
Cook up a plan when I get to whippin'
Look

Gang gon' get to spazzin'
Say they love me, they just cappin'
Shit really get ugly, ain't just rappin'
Turn a nigga to a duppy if I blast it
You know how the gang comin', don't even ask
Don't know shit 'bout a nigga past
You don't know I hide pain with a little laugh
I was stuck up in the field, had no cash
I was stuck up in the field, huh
Fake niggas say they real
Ain't tryna hang with 'em, get you killed, huh
Wasn't tryna let me eat
Now they be beggin' me to get a meal
Front on the gang, get up on your heels
It ain't shit to get your cap peeled
Front on the gang, get up on your heels
It ain't shit to get your cap 

I got a bag and they started treated me different
Love the way that I bag and I flip it
Gang get to wildin', we shoot up your district
Show no love for nobody who dissin'
You had your chance but you missed it
And I fell in love with the drippin'
Run up them bands and I'm goin' missin'
Cook up a plan when I get to whippin'
Look

Hangin' with fake niggas, get you killed
I'm with my real niggas to the death
I bring my FN when it's beef
Before I go ever tryna rep the set
Know the kid pull up, pull up in the whip
Know that rich baller come and make a mess
I'm well connected all up in the East
I make a call and they gon' bring a TEC
You catch me ridin' if they say it's war
But most of the time I'm focused on the check
I give it a hunnid, I'ma give it all
I came too far to give it any less
I might be countin' hunnids 'til they fall
I used to be makin' money tryna stretch
I'm with some hitters that don't play at all
If he make a move, bullets to his chest

I got a bag and they started treated me different
Love the way that I bag and I flip it
Gang get to wildin', we shoot up your district
Show no love for nobody who dissin'
You had your chance but you missed it
And I fell in love with the drippin'
Run up them bands and I'm gettin' missin'
Cook up a plan when I get to whippin'
Look

I got a bag and they started treated me different
Love the way that I bag and I flip it
Gang get to wildin', we shoot up your district
Show no love for nobody who dissin'
You had your chance but you missed it
And I fell in love with the drippin'
Run up them bands and I'm goin' missin'
Cook up a plan when I get to whippin'
Look
