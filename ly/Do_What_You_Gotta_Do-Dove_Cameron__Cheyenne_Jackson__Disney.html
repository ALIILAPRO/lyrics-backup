		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Listen, little girl
You're talking to a God
And I don't wanna hear the drama
Kindness ain't my brand
Oh, I guess that's why you ran
Try being married to your mama
You stink at being a dad
Poor Mali, are you sad?
Not as sad as you without your powers
I didn't come to fight
For once, do something right
I steal souls, were you expecting flowers?

I only need you 'cause I came here for something
I've given you everything, by giving you nothing

I did what I had to do (ooh-ooh-ooh)
No, you only did what's best for you
Well, you could learn a thing or two (ooh-ooh-ooh)
When push comes to shove
You do what you gotta do, yeah

You were never there
Guess you don't have a phone
You never called to say, "I miss you"
Are you kidding? Is this a joke?
You need to let it go
You're stronger with those daddy issues
Oh, thank you
Show me some respect
It ain't easy to neglect
My attention would've made you softer
Ooh-hoo, should I be proud?
Don't turn this thing around
I guess you are your father's daughter

Don't think I need you, I just came here for something
I've given you everything, by giving you nothing

I did what I had to do (ooh-ooh-ooh)
I made it on my own, no thanks to you
Well, you could learn a thing or two (ooh-ooh-ooh)
When push comes to shove
You do what you gotta do

How 'bout I go with you and we'll spend some time?
How 'bout you stay here 'cause you're out of your mind
Let's make new memories, you can show me the town
No, you can keep your memories now
Get over it
I am over it
I'm over you being over it
Let's dance

I did what I had to do (ooh-ooh-ooh)
No, you only did what's best for you
Well, you could learn a thing or two (ooh-ooh-ooh)
When push comes to shove, you do
When push comes to shove, you do
When push comes to shove
You do what you gotta do, yeah
Ha
Please
