		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Years go by
Feels like I am stuck in rewind
It's only a moment when I feel alive
When your body's getting close to mine
Then I breathe in breathe a little bit out
So much tension I might pass out
But then I wake up and see no sun
Diary stuck in my room
Collecting dust, chasing us
Remember me when I leave, ecstasy
When I go back to Reality
Whoah, whoah, whoah
Years go by
Feels like I am stuck in rewind
It's only a moment when I feel alive
When your body's getting close to mine
Diary stuck in my room
Collecting dust, chasing us
Remember me when I leave, ecstasy
When I go back to Reality
There is more to life here
This is my escape, Don't wanna wake
Don't open up your eyes
There is more to life here
This is my escape, Don't wanna wake
Don't open up your eyes
There is more to life here
This is my escape, Don't wanna wake
Whoah, whoah, whoah
Whoah, whoah, whoah
