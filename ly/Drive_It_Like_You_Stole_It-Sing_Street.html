		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You just can't stand the way that I walked out from the wreckage
Can't understand the way that I turned myself around
I tried to terminate this war
With you
But you won't let it go
You keep coming back for more

Freedom
I'm takin' it back
I'm outta here, no turnin' back
In a baby blue Cadillac
Just when I was stallin'
I heard an angel callin'

This is your life
You can go anywhere
You gotta grab the wheel and own it
And drive it like you stole it
Roll it
This is your life
You can be anything
You gotta learn to rock and roll it
You gotta put the pedal down
And drive it like you stole it
And drive it like you stole it

We get stuck in the dirt
And we can't see where we're going
We face all kinds of hurt
And the friction slows us down
But I won't be waiting here for the world to win me gold
I'll leave your dust behind me
Stranded in the road

Freedom
I'm takin' it back
Attitude
I'm givin' it back
In a baby blue Cadillac
Just when I was stallin'
I heard an angel callin'

This is your life
You can go anywhere
You gotta grab the wheel and own it
You gotta put the pedal down
And drive it like you stole it

This is your life
You can go anywhere
You gotta grab the wheel and own it
And drive it like you stole it
Roll it
This is your life
You can be anything
You gotta learn to rock and roll it
You gotta put the pedal down
And drive it like you stole it
(Hoo, hoo, hoo-ooh-ooh)
And drive it like you stole it
(Hoo, hoo, hoo-ooh-ooh)
And drive it like you stole it
(Hoo, hoo, hoo-ooh-ooh)
And drive it like you stole it
(Hoo, hoo, hoo-ooh-ooh)
