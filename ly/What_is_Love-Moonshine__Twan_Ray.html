		  What is Love

What is love?
Baby don't hurt me
Don't hurt me
No more
Baby don't hurt me, don't hurt me
No more
What is love?
Yeah
I don't know why you're not fair
I give you my love, but you don't care
So what is right and what is wrong?
Gimme a sign
What is love?
Baby don't hurt me
Don't hurt me
No more
What is love?
Baby don't hurt me
Don't hurt me
No more
Oh, I don't know, what can I do?
What else can I say, it's up to you
I know we're one, just me and you
I can't go on
What is love?
Baby don't hurt me
Don't hurt me
No more
What is love?
Baby don't hurt me
Don't hurt me
No more
What is love?
What is love?
What is love?
Baby don't hurt me
Don't hurt me
No more
Don't hurt me
Don't hurt me
I want no other, no other lover
This is our life, our time
We are together I need you forever
Is it love?
What is love?
Baby don't hurt me
Don't hurt me
No more
What is love?
Baby don't hurt me
Don't hurt me
No more
Yeah, yeah, (woah-woah-woah, oh, oh)
(Woah-woah-woah, oh, oh)
What is love?
Baby don't hurt me
Don't hurt me
No more
What is love?
Baby don't hurt me
Don't hurt me
No more
Baby don't hurt me
Don't hurt me
No more
Baby don't hurt me
Don't hurt me
No more
What is love?
