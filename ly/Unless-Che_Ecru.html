		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  I need more than love
Yeah, just to stay with you
If I can't find it, it's a dub, dub, dub, oh
I won't play with you
I need more than love
Yeah, just to stay with you
If I can't find it, it's a dub, dub, dub, oh
I won't play with you

Let down your hair, let it fall right on my face
Now that you're here
Won't let your love go all to waste
When I touch you slow
I send chills down your spine, girl
And it's never enough (you know)
I can't wait 'til it's mine, girl
When-when I touch you slow
I send chills down your spine
And it's never enough (you know)
I can't wait 'til it's mine, girl

When I touch you slow
I send chills down your spine
And it's never enough (you know)
I can't wait 'til, I can't wait 'til
