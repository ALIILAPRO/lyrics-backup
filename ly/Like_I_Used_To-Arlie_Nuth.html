		  ""Never been this obssesed at all Tell me why it's killing me it feels so strange Cause everytime I told you yes didn't I? Now I realize you're just playing fucking games All I want Is wish I never hate myself Is wish I never lose you All I want Is wish that I could change myself And love you like I used to Never been this obssesed at all Tell me why it's killing me it feels so strange Cause baby, baby you're so amazing You're my angel baby come save me I just want you to stay Can I say that I love, that I love you baby I know you know that loving you makes me crazy You have been thinking about me lately I just wanna listen now come on tell me Ans you're leaving now it's so hiliorius babe And I actually miss you it's serious babe Let me talk to you I'm so delirious babe All I want Is wish I never hate myself Is wish I never lose you All I want Is wish that I could change myself And love you like I used to
