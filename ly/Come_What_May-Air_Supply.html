		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When she looks at me
I know the girl sees things
Nobody else can see

All of the secret fears inside
And all the craziness I hide
She looks into my soul
And reads me like nobody can

And she doesn't judge the man
She just takes me as I am

Come what may, she believes
And that faith is something
I've never known before
Come what may, she loves me
And that love has helped me open a door
Making me love myself a little more

When I turn away
She knows those are the times
There's nothing she can say

Nothing that anyone can do
And so she lets me live it through
And when I'm in my darkest hour of uncertainty
She just simply lets me be
And goes right on loving me

Come what may, she believes
And that faith is something
I've never known before
Come what may, she loves me
And that love has helped me open a door
Making me love myself a little more

And when it seems my dreams
Have all slipped through my fingers
When they just can't be found
I turn around and there they are
Shining in her eyes

Come what may, she believes
And that faith is something
I've never known before
Come what may, she loves me
And that love has helped me open a door
Making me love myself a little more
