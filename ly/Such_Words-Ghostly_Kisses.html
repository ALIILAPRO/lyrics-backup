		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I felt this instant of desire 
Before I went back to my head 
And then I crawl back 
Into your arms 

Can it stay between us? 
But we do not say such words 
Among the other things you know 
But we do not say such words 
In this endless in between 
But we do not say such words 
I will never learn, I know 
But we do not say such words 

We shared a moment of happiness 
Before the train pulls our hands 
And then I fall into pieces 
And then we fall into pieces 

Can it stay between us? 
But we do not say such words 
Among the other things you know 
But we do not say such words 
In this endless in between 
But we do not say such words 
I will never learn, I know 
But we do not say such words
