		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, oh, oh

What a world that I'm livin' in,
Will the rainstorms ever end?
Steal I feel my, path narrow, I run again,
Seen happiness is gone again,
And then you see 'em,
Grey clouds up above mane,
Metaphor to my life mane,
Still feel my heart stronger then it's ever been,
Strong will til my journey ends 'till then I roll,
More then I've ever rolled
Not pills but the Mary though
Still I feel my eyes heavy when the days goes,
Nothing helping with my head dose, but I ain't sleep,
Awake in another state,
Livin' in a new space,
Still I feel my mind runnin' at a steady pace,
God help me so I'll win the race

'Till then I go
The sky might fall
The sky might fall
But I'm not worried at all
C'mon c'mon
The sky might fall
The sky might fall
But I'm not worried at all

Hey, hey
I let them know somethin', I let them know somethin', I let them know somethin'
You can listen up, listen up, listen up, listen up
Hey I let them know somethin', I let them know somethin', I let them know somethin'
You can listen up, listen up, listen up, listen up

Grey clouds stuck together fam,
Lining piercing to another land
Over the desert where the lost play,
Sole searching each and every way,
An then you see tha,
Awesome sounds so profound,
When it, it'll grip you, you can see it,
If you hear you can feel it too,
Somethin' special I am runnin' to,
'Till then I go, away very far away,
To another universe where all the people say,
Its the new new place for the special to embrace,
Like a martian you seemingly,
Wandered out the place,
Take what you need from the valley of the hopeful,
Even if you drown you'll be floatin' higher above it,
You can say bye bye bye,
Sky might be fallin' but remember you can fly high.

The sky might fall
The sky might fall
But I'm not worried at all
C'mon c'mon
The sky might fall
The sky might fall
But I'm not worried at all
Hey, hey
I let them know somethin', I let them know somethin', I let them know somethin'
You can listen up, listen up, listen up, listen up
Hey I let them know somethin', I let them know somethin', let them know somethin'
You can listen up, listen up, listen up, listen up

I keep runnin'
Yeah I gotta keep up I gotta keep up yeah
I gotta keep up I gotta keep up
And I keep runnin'
Yeah I gotta keep up I gotta keep up yeah
Gotta keep up I gotta keep up yeah
'Cause I'm gone
Yea na na na na, I'm up and away
Na na na na, know'm talkin' bout, hey, hey
