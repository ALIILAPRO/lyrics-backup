		  Break 4 love, break 4 love
Baby, don't you worry
I want to be the man
That you want me to be

There's no need to worry
I'm gonna give you love
The way you want it to be

I'll be there every morning, baby
To hold you tight
And that's why, baby
You don't have to wonder why

Why I love you, I need you
Got to have, have you
I need you, oh, right now

For love, I'll be there every night
To hold you and kiss you
'Till the morning light

I'll be there every morning, baby
To hold you tight
And that's why, baby
You don't have to wonder why

Why I love you, I need you
Got to got to have you
I need you, right now give
