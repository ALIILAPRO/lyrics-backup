		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell you what I know
Everything's the same
Hey, feelings come and go
No need to explain to me
No need to explain to me
I'm just telling you how I feel
But she don't wanna hear
But everyone can see it
You know we look good together 
You know we look good together

Wish you could trust me enough
Tell you what
No stopping us
We're in love, should be together
Wish you could trust me enough
Tell you what
No stopping us
We're in love should be together

Oh, don't you look sweet
But you look better with me 
Tell you baby I'll make you complete
Can we just be together?
Can we just be together?
Can we just be together?
Can we just be together?
Be together
Be together

She don't really please you 
No, we ain't the same
I can think of something
To make it all easier
To make it all easier
You don't even see it
Smiling through her tears
They ain't even real
You ain't even good together 
You know we look good together

Wish you could trust me enough
Tell you what
No stopping us
We're in love, should be together
Wish you could trust me enough
Tell you what
No stopping us
We're in love should be together

Oh, don't you look sweet
But you look better with me 
Tell you baby, I'll make you complete
Can we just be together?
Can we just be together?
Can we just be together?
Can we just be together?
Be together
Be together
Can we just be together?
Can we just be together?
Can we just be together?
Be together
Be together
