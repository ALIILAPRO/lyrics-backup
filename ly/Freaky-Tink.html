		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby, I jump, jump when you call
Hottest alive, but you cold as the Fall
No competition when we start to kiss
And I get right to work like I'm out on a mission
First thing I do is I start at your neck while I'm rubbin' your taper
Boy, you so special, I might as well wrap you in paper
You not no rookie, so ain't no more playin'
Take off the shirt while I slip off your pants
It's only 10:30, I got you excited, like Christmas came early
See, boy, how far can we go?
When we get done it be white as some snow (as some snow)
Come play like a kid
It's bussin' like we off the mids, baby

I ain't got work for the next couple hours
You hit from the back then rinse off in the shower
I might be young, but I know what's up (with you)
I know what's up (with you)

You want a freak (freak), freak, freak (freak)
Ooh, get a freak (freak), freak, freak (freak)
You want a freak (freak), freak, freak (freak)
Oh, I'm a freak (freak), freak, freak (freak)

He just wanna hit it with his two hands
Already got a job with a few bands
And he been boss since '09
You say I'm a star, like showtime
I start undressin' in front of your mirror
I just been waitin' to ride on your body like it's a four wheeler
I'm hoppin' on it whenever you're ready
Know what I want when I say, "Come and get me"
Pillow so soft, I could lay here for hours
Ooh, you tall as a tower
Let's just do something we'll never forget
'Cause you know the vibes, don't be surprised
Took the night off 'cause I knew you would slide

I ain't got work for the next couple hours
You hit from the back then rinse off in the shower
I might be young but I know what's up (with you)
I know what's up (with you)

You want a freak (freak), freak, freak (freak)
Ooh, get a freak (freak), freak, freak (freak)
You want a freak (freak), freak, freak (freak)
Oh, I'm a freak (freak), freak, freak (freak)

This time we need the remix
That I wanna do
But I gotta be secure
With you

Put it in a split while I grind on your dick
If it went down, would you tell what we did?
Is you gon' leave when you find out what I done?
I can be a freak, but you gotta be the one
The one
I can be a freak, but you gotta be the one
The one
