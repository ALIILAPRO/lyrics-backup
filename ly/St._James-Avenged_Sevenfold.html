		  Wo-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Wo-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh

This is the story of a man
Who conquered life drink in hand
Ship unmanned
Marked by genius, channelled good
By some a bit misunderstood
They'd been wrong many times before

Sometimes our saints are sinners
They blur the lines and lead the way
Their way
Raise hell and a glass in reverence
The fearless lives of our great saints
Our saints

Wo-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh

Never a stranger to late night
Snake bite, fist fights and empty pints
Unrivaled heights, yeah
He led with songs, they sang along
Created bonds that held so strong
Some were right and some were wrong

Sometimes our saints are sinners
They blur the lines and lead the way
Their way
Raise hell and a glass in reverence
The fearless lives of our great saints
Our saints

Wo-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Wo-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh

It's by the sea and at nights end
That's when the sin and swill begin
That's when he had that certain light inside his head
For every whisper he would scream
For every draught he'd share a drink
For every sorrow there's a light from our St. James

On the sea by the cliff he watches
He waits the night to see the day
His way
Last call will find us all
But there's a light that leads the way
Our way

Sometimes our saints are sinners
They blur the lines and lead the way
Their way
Raise hell and a glass in reverence
The fearless lives of our great saints
Our saints

Wo-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Wo-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Wo-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
