		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, baby don't you want to go?
Oh, baby don't you want to go?
Back to the land of California
To my sweet home Chicago

Oh, baby don't you want to go?
Oh, baby don't you want to go?
Back to the land of California
To my sweet home Chicago

Now one and one is two
Two and two is four
I'm heavy loaded, baby
I'm booked, I gotta go

Cryin' baby
Honey don't you want to go?
Back to the land of California
To my sweet home Chicago

Now two and two is four
Four and two is six
You gonna keep monkeyin' round with your friend-boy, you gonna get your
Business all in a trick

But I'm cryin' baby
Honey don't you wanna go?
Back to the land of California
To my sweet home Chicago

Now six and two is eight
Eight and two is ten
Friend-boy, she trick you one time
She sure gonna do it again

But I'm cryin' hey, hey
Baby don't you want to go?
To the land of California
To my sweet home Chicago

I'm goin' to California
From there to Des Moines Iowa
Somebody will tell me that you
Need my help someday, cryin'

Hey, hey
Baby don't you want to go?
Back to the land of California
To my sweet home Chicago
