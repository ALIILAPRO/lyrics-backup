		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Live fast for the moment
Keep burning on both ends
I gotta get out 'fore I die, out 'fore I die
Get out 'fore I die
Blacked out in the morning
Too high, never cave in
I gotta get out 'fore I die' out 'fore I die
Get out 'fore I die

Burning like a candle both ends dripping spills loose
Ends burn heads burning end bridges
Better use the stairs 'til your legs hurting
Running for the hills I'm on their heels keep their heads turning
Consider it a fair warning
My partners steady moving like it's feds on us, uh uh
Probably 'cause you assuming that it's meds on us, uh uh
Kick big shit I need leg warmers, chug water, all love
Blood is thicker than the dreads on us (woo)
Now I remember that when I'm in my bag
It ain't where you from, it's where you're at
Where them niggas at
Time to toe tag, yeah, body bag, yeah
Karate chop the shit in half 'til they find my match (fight)
'Til they find me laying dead on my back
This could be my last year
Putting up a fight until I collapse, yeah
2013 I went wild for the night
In 2019 I'm getting out 'fore I die

Live fast for the moment (yeah)
Keep burning on both ends
I gotta get out 'fore I die' out 'fore I die
Get out 'fore I die (yeah, uh)
Blacked out in the morning
Too high, never cave in
I gotta get out 'fore I die, out 'fore I die
Get out 'fore I die

(Oh)
I gotta get out 'fore I die
(Oh)
I gotta get out 'fore I die

When you started from the bottom go top forward, yeah
Name like saliva, whole mouth full of it, yeah
Chasing for the clout, go all out for it
'Til they pull up with the toasters like a house warming, yeah
I just need my piece please like a Reese's butter cup
Is you a punk or a power puff, huh, toughen up
Bunk my species time to feces
Then repeat rock my CC
Just popped a CC, now I'm up
When it's time for me (yeah)
Show me empathy
When it ends for me
Would you fend for me?
When it's time for me
Show me empathy
When it ends for me
Would you fend for me?

Live fast for the moment
Keep burning on both ends
I gotta get out 'fore I die, out 'fore I die
Get out 'fore I die
Blacked out in the morning
Too high, never cave in
I gotta get out 'fore I die, out 'fore I die
Get out 'fore I die

It ain't where you from, it's where you're at
Oh, I gotta get out 'fore I die
