		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Party peoples, in the place to be
Just for you, it's the Ultra-magnetic MC's!

Say what, Peter Piper?
To hell with childish rhymes!
Cause this jam is just movin'
The crowd is steady groovin'
To a supersonic pace 
With highs and stupid bass
With some pep in the step
Cause the beat is so funky the pace is well kept
Cause we're..

Ultra {magnetic, magnetic}
MC's Ultra {magnetic, magnetic}
MC's Ultra {magnetic, magnetic} MC's

	Kool Keith!

They use the simple back and forth, the same, old rhythm
That a baby can pick up, and join, right with them
But their rhymes are pathetic, they think they copacetic
Using nursery terms, at least not poetic

On a educated base, intelligent wise
As the record just turn, you learn, plus burn
By the flame of the lyrics which cooks the human brain
Providing overheating knowledge, by means causing pain

Make a migraine, hated yourself, start to melt
While the Technics spin, the wax is on the belt
Motivating clockwise the more you realize
Moe Love's moving steady, by most, with Everready

Like a battery, charged, I'm worth the alkaline
Yes the mystery to solve, so seek and define 
These words I've given extremely now driven 
With a Datsun, a Maxima to glide
Yes the wizard Kool Keith and I'm sportin' my ride
Cause we're...

Ultra {magnetic, magnetic}
MC's Ultra {magnetic, magnetic}
MC's Ultra {magnetic, magnetic} MC's

	Ced Gee!

Usin' frequencies and data, I am approximate
Leaving revolutions turning, emerging chemistry
With the precise implications, achieved, ??
Explorating demonstrating, ruling, dominating
Igniting causing friction with nu-clear alarms

Seperates competing biters from me, the scientist
As I execute, lyricist, known as predators
When by strippin' high potents and makin' penicillin
I will surely sort out, and stomp, every pest

Oh the rampaging paramedic, poacher is my title
To inform other worlds of such, a hellacaust
Quick serve as a purpose, preparing first aid
with medical utensils, the wizard Ced Gee
is advanced with elevation, astonishing with rhythm
Cause we're...

Ultra {magnetic, magnetic}
MC's Ultra {magnetic, magnetic}
MC's Ultra {magnetic, magnetic}
MC's Ultra {magnetic, magnetic} MC's

	Moe Love!
