		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  God, I'm on my knees again
God, I'm begging please again
I need You
Oh, I need You

Walking down this desert road
Water for my thirsty soul
I need You
Oh, I need You

Your forgiveness
Is like sweet, sweet honey
On my lips
Like the sound of a symphony
To my ears
Like holy water on my skin (hey)

Dead man walking, slave to sin
I wanna know about being born again
I need You
Oh, God, I need You

So, take me to the riverside
Take me under, baptize
I need You
Oh, God, I need You

Your forgiveness
Is like sweet, sweet honey
On my lips
Like the sound of a symphony
To my ears
Like holy water on my skin
On my skin

I don't wanna abuse Your grace
God, I need it every day
It's the only thing that ever really
Makes me wanna change
I don't wanna abuse Your grace
God, I need it every day
It's the only thing that ever really
Makes me wanna change
I don't wanna abuse Your grace
God, I need it every day
It's the only thing that ever really
Makes me wanna change, oh
I don't wanna abuse Your grace
God, I need it every day
It's the only thing that ever really
Makes me wanna change

Your forgiveness
Is like sweet, sweet honey
On my lips
Like the sound of a symphony
To my ears
It's like holy water

Your forgiveness
Oh, is like sweet, sweet honey
On my lips
Like the sound of a symphony
To my ears
Oh, it's like holy water on my skin
Yeah, it's like holy water on my skin
Oh, it's like holy water
