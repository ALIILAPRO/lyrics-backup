		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't stand
That you might be in someone's bed
With some that you just met all over you

And you can't breathe
When your eye's all fixed on me
Know you think that I don't see it but I do

Your body keeps me awake
But I say nothing
And you say nothing

I give it all for a taste
But we say nothing
It's time for something

I want you and I know you want me, too
So now no more games come through
And I'll make your dreams come true

All night long
'Cause I'll keep you so turned on
So now no more games come through
Don't make me dream of you (dream of you)

Don't make me, don't make me
Don't make me dream of you

Don't make me, don't make me
Don't make me dream of you

Don't make me, don't make me
Don't make me dream of you

Don't make me
Don't make me dream of you

It's getting late
And this bar's about to close
And you say you'll drive me home 'cause I'm on your way

What can I say
Park the car and come on in
I got whisky, I got gin and lingerie

Your body keeps me awake
But I say nothing
And you say nothing

I give it all for a taste
But we say nothing
It's time for something

I want you and I know you want me, too
So now no more games come through
And I'll make your dreams come true

All night long
'Cause I'll keep you so turned on
So now no more games come through
Don't make me dream of you (dream of you)

Don't make me, don't make me
Don't make me dream of you

Don't make me, don't make me
Don't make me dream of you

Don't make me, don't make me
Don't make me dream of you

Don't make me
Don't make me dream of you

(Don't make me, don't make me, don't make me dream of you)
(Don't make me, don't make me, don't make me dream of you)
(Don't make me, don't make me, don't make me dream of you)
(Don't make me, don't make me, don't make me dream of you)
(Don't make me, don't make me)

I want you and I know you want me, too
So now no more games come through
And I'll make your dreams come true

All night long
'Cause I'll keep you so turned on
So now no more games come through
Don't make me dream of you (dream of you)

Don't make me, don't make me
Don't make me dream of you

Don't make me, don't make me
Don't make me dream of you

Don't make me, don't make me
Don't make me dream of you

Don't make me
Don't make me dream of you
