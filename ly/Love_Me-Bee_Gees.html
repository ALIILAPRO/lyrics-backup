		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Love me
Just a little bit longer
Love me

I remember times my love
When we really had it all
You were always there to make me smile
To help me when I fall

Ooh I can't believe you're leaving me
When there's so much more to say
I can't let you go
Ooh Every time I look at you
I still can feel the glow
Let it be, let it grow

Ooh Love me, please
Just a little bit longer
Together, we can make it
Our love is much too young to break it

Love me please
Just a little bit harder
Together we can make it
Our love is much too young to break it

Oh all I ever wanted was
To have you to myself
Then I see you standing there
In the arms of someone else

Ooh You know a girl can stand so much
And it's more than I can fake

I can't let you go
Ooh every time I look at you
I still can feel the glow
Let it be, let it grow

Ooh Love me, please
Just a little bit longer
Together, we can make it
Our love is much
Too young to break it

Love me, please
Just a little bit harder

Never even tried to see things my way
It's hard on a woman
When love ain't no love at all
And when you walk away
From me baby you're gonna be sorry
I'm begging you please

Love me, please love me, love me
Just a little bit longer
Together we can make it
Our love is much too young to break it

Love me, please just a little bit harder
Just a little bit harder (just a little bit harder)
Together we can make it
Our love is much too young to break it
Love me, please just a little bit longer
