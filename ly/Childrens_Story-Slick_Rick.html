		  Uncle Ricky
Would you read us a bedtime story?
Please, huh? Please?
Alright, you kids get to bed
I'll get the story book
Y'all tucked in? (yeah)
Here we go

Once upon a time not long ago
When people wore pajamas and lived life slow
When laws were stern and justice stood
And people were behavin' like they ought ta good
There lived a lil' boy who was misled
By anotha lil' boy and this is what he said
"Me and Ty, we gonna make sum cash
Robbin' old folks and makin' the dash"
They did the job, money came with ease
But one couldn't stop, it's like he had a disease
He robbed another and another and a sister and her brother (stick 'em up, stick 'em up)
Tried to rob a man who was a D.T. undercover
The cop grabbed his arm, he started acting erratic
He said "Keep still, boy, no need for static"
Punched him in his belly and he gave him a slap
But little did he know the lil' boy was strapped
The kid pulled out a gun, he said, "Why did ya hit me?"
The barrel was set straight for the cop's kidney
The cop got scared, the kid, he starts to figure
"I'll do years if I pull this trigger"
So he cold dashed and ran around the block
Cop radios in to another lady cop
He ran by a tree, there he saw the sister
Shot for the head, he shot back but he missed her
Looked around good and from expectations
He decided he'd head for the subway stations
But she was coming and he made a left
He was runnin' top speed 'til he was outta breath
Knocked an old man down and swore he killed him (sorry)
Then he made his move to an abandoned building
Ran up the stairs up to the top floor
Opened up the door there, guess who he saw? (who?)
Dave the dope fiend shootin' dope
Who don't know the meaning of water nor soap
He said "I need bullets, hurry up, run!"
The dope fiend brought back a spanking shotgun
He went outside but there was cops all over
Then he dipped into a car, a stolen Nova
Raced up the block doing 83
Crashed into a tree near university
Escaped alive though the car was battered
Rat-a-tat-tatted and all the cops scattered
Ran out of bullets and he still had static
Grabbed a pregnant lady and out the automatic
Pointed at her head and he said the gun was full o' lead
He told the cops, "Back off or honey here's dead"
Deep in his heart he knew he was wrong
So he let the lady go and he starts to run on
Sirens sounded, he seemed astounded
Before long the lil' boy got surrounded
He dropped the gun, so went the glory
And this is the way I have end this story
He was only seventeen, in a madman's dream
The cops shot the kid, I still hear him scream
This ain't funny so don't ya dare laugh
Just another case 'bout the wrong path
Straight 'n narrow or yo' soul gets cast

Good night, knock 'em out the box Rick, knock 'em out Rick

Oh boy, that Uncle Ricky he's really weird (knock 'em out the box Rick, knock 'em out Rick)
I know right, what did he mean "Straight and narrow or yo' soul gets cast"?
(knock 'em out the box Rick, knock 'em out Rick)
I don't know, I think he be crackin' it up or something (knock 'em, knock 'em, knock 'em)
Well, good night (knock 'em, knock 'em, knock 'em, knock 'em, knock 'em, knock 'em out Rick)
Good night

knock 'em out the box Rick, knock 'em out Rick
knock 'em out the box Rick, knock 'em out Rick
(knock 'em, knock 'em, knock 'em, knock 'em, knock 'em, knock 'em out Rick)
(knock 'em, knock 'em, knock 'em, knock 'em, knock 'em, knock 'em out Rick)
(knock 'em, knock 'em, knock 'em, knock 'em, knock 'em, knock 'em out Rick)
(knock 'em, knock 'em, knock 'em, knock 'em, knock 'em, knock 'em out Rick)
(knock 'em out Rick, knock 'em out Rick, knock 'em out Rick, knock 'em out Rick)
(knock 'em out Rick, knock 'em out Rick, knock 'em out Rick, knock 'em out the box Rick)
