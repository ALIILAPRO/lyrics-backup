		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Voices, I don't wanna understand
My car keys are jingling in my hand
My high heels are clicking towards your door
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (ding, dong, ding, dong, ding)
It's this one thing that got me trippin'
It's this one thing that got me trippin' (you did)
This one thing, your soul made me feel it
It's this one thing you did, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
It's this one thing that caught me slippin'
It's this one thing, I want to admit it (you did)
This one thing and I was so with it (Yuh)
It's this one thing you did, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
You said you're worried that you're annoying me
You saying you love me I'm like totally
Said that I'm mean and blunt also brutally
But ever second of my life was cruel to me
Now I'm overthinking contemplating
Wondering every little thing could we make it?
All the tension between us could I break it?
But on the tension line I made a mistake
I was overthinking and I over contemplate
I forget about the love when there too much hate
I want this to work. I pray for better days
And here I say, I love you too much bae
I'm here forever to stay
Yea, yea, okay
