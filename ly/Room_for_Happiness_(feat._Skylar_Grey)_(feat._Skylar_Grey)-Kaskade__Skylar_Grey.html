		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sometimes I wish I never felt the influence of you
'Cause now I feel the disconnect, like an open wound
Where you once were, there is a space that runs as deep as hell
But every morning when I wake I tell myself
Don't be fooled by your emptiness
There's so much more room for happiness
Don't be fooled by your emptiness
There's so much more room for happiness
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Sometimes it's worth to have lost than to have never had at all
'Cause it's a curse to feel loved then to feel it all dissolved
Where you once were, there is a space that runs as deep as hell
But every morning when I wake I tell myself
Don't be fooled by your emptiness
There's so much more room for happiness
Don't be fooled by your emptiness
There's so much more room for happiness
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Don't be fooled by your emptiness,
There's so much more room for happiness
Don't be fooled by your emptiness
There's so much more room for happiness
Yeah, yeah, yeah
