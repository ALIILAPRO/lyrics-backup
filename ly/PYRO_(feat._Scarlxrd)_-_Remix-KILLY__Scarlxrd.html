		  (FREAKEY)
Yeah

I done seen so many switch like a slideshow (what?)
So I stay around the fire like a pyro (yeah, yeah)
If you wanna cross that line, cut your tight-rope (cut it)
Look my chain up in its eyes, that's the light show (woo, yeah, woo)
And there's no turning back (back)
Perc' 10, Perc' 10, fuck a heart attack (perky, what?)
Pray my brothers reach the promised land (woo)
For them, we do the fire dance (hey, hey, hey, hey)

This shit crazy, man, right wrist, I'm revengeful
Count through a hundred bands, dead men, got a handful (yeah)
Heard he a skeleton, just counting down the time though
So Helen Keller, yeah, I can't tell no info (no, no, no, no)
Told you once (hold up), won't say it again (what?)
Hop in the Rolls-Royce and the doors open like fridge (hello)
T-t-two Rollies on my wrist, yeah, I call 'em twins (two, two, two)
Got way too used to giving more than I get
Hundred problems, I can't solve 'em
But if they switch sides (switch sides), then we on 'em (yuh, hey)
Then we solve 'em (yeah)
One phone call 'em (yeah), just to taunt 'em (yeah)
I done crushed so many roads, just my shadow (what?)
Don't you think you won the war from a battle (what?)
Could have bought another chain, bought a castle (yeah)
And if they want it, let it rain, we got ammo (yeah, yeah, yeah)

I done seen so many switch like a slideshow (what?)
So I stay around the fire like a pyro (yeah, yeah)
If you wanna cross that line, cut your tight-rope (kill)
Look my chain up in its eyes, that's the light show (woo, yeah, woo)
And there's no turning back (back)
Perc' 10, Perc' 10, fuck a heart attack (perky, what?)
Pray my brothers reach the promised land (woo) (yeah)
For them, we do the fire dance (Scar)

Infinite shots and I'm never gon' miss
Lever a scar on your mouth from the name on my fist
Lil' boy switched on the come-up it is what it is
I link Killy, that's gang, yeah, I'm good in the 6ix
They don't ever talk facts, they just make up some shit
Got my foot on the gas like I had on their necks
I can't fuck with the past but I own all my shit
I'm about to start wrapping these clones in a spliff
Shut up, pussy (shut up), niggas wining in their feelings (what?)
Ugh, w'appen prick? This pussy ah unsent all of him DMs
He cyaan' stand by any threat him send period (what's the word?)
Make one phone call and my demons start creeping
Fuck, dickhead, there's no turning back
Burnt him, burnt him, full-force heart attack
Goes to show in fact, slow your roll your wack, throw the rope right back
Hang this bitch and laugh, watch him choke and pass
I'm aware, I keep coming right back from the dead (yeah)
Make them suffer, these niggas is scared (yeah)
I got paper, I'm good everywhere (bitch)
Yung Scarlxrd still gon' scream in your ear (yeah)
If I wanted to die, would you care? (Pussy)
Of course not, I'm not tripping, it's fair (yeah)
I don't need your permission or theirs (kill, kill, kill, kill, yeah)

I done seen so many switch like a slideshow (what?)
So I stay around the fire like a pyro (yeah, yeah)
If you wanna cross that line, cut your tight-rope (kill)
Look my chain up in its eyes, that's the light show (woo, yeah, woo)
And there's no turning back (back)
Perc' 10, Perc' 10, fuck a heart attack (perky, what?)
Pray my brothers reach the promised land (woo)
For them, we do the fire dance
