		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One chance, two chances or three
Think I got too much sympathy
Yeah, I hold my grudges like I held you
How does me trying to fix it turn into "I'll just forgive it"?
One chance
Two chances
Were lost on you

You can only dig the grave so deep
Before you start to take me down with you, with you, with you, with you

I could never make you want me like I wanted to be wanted
I could never really change you like I thought that I could
I was tryna make us something outta nothing
We were nothing at all
You can only dig the grave so deep
You can only try to save something that's not already gone
So sad, what the fuck?

Said you'd be going out with all your boys
I'm crazy if I called you, right?
Tables turned, now I'm out, and you just called like thirty times
Always a funny thing watching the tough guy plead, oh, baby

You can only dig the grave so deep
Before you start to take me down with you, with you, with you, with you

I could never make you want me like I wanted to be wanted
I could never really change you like I thought that I could
I was tryna make us something outta nothing
We were nothing at all
You can only dig the grave so deep
You can only try to save something that's not already gone
That's not already gone
That's not already gone, ooh

You had me, you had me for a minute
The sad thing is you never would admit that you had me
You had me for a minute there, oh
You had me, you had me for a minute
The sad thing is you never would admit that you had me
You had me for a minute there

But I could never make you want me like I wanted to be wanted
I could never really change you like I thought that I could
I was tryna make us something outta nothing
We were nothing at all
You can only dig the grave so deep
You can only try to save something that's not already gone
