		<p>
		  I go hard, hard (go, go)
Oh, oh (go, go, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, go, go)

Bae, for you, I go hard, hard (ayy, KBeazy, you fired up) (for you, I go hard, hard)
Just don't break my heart, heart (just don't break my heart, heart)
I been on the drugs hard, hard (I been on the drugs hard, hard)
Smokin' on dope like a Rasta (smokin' on dope like a Rasta)
Try to take you from me, that chopper go grrah, grrah (try to take you from me, that chopper go grrah, grrah)
Go, go
It go grrah, grrah (it go grrah, grrah)
Go
Try to take you from me, it go grrah, grrah (try to take you from me it go grrah, grrah)
Go, go
It go grrah, grrah (it go, grrah, grahh)
Go, go, go

I was sittin' in the crib with a hand full of racks and a heart full of pain
Yeah, funny thing is, I really did think all hoes were the same
Then I saw your face and I heard your name, name
Had to make you my bae, put that on the gang, gang
The groupie hoes don't phase me, tryna give out that lame brain
It don't amaze me, your heart, I contain-tain
Take her to safety (yeah), you're my getaway
So you can't get away (ayy)

Bae, for you, I go hard, hard (for you, I go hard, hard)
Just don't break my heart, heart (just don't break my heart, heart)
I been on the drugs hard, hard (I been on the drugs hard, hard)
Smokin' on dope like a Rasta (smokin' on dope like a Rasta)
Try to take you from me, that chopper go grrah, grrah (try to take you from me, that chopper go grrah, grrah)
Go, go
It go grrah, grrah (it go grrah, grrah)
Go
Try to take you from me, it go grrah, grrah (try to take you from me it go grrah, grrah)
Go, go
It go grrah, grrah (it go, grrah, grahh)
Go, go, go

For you, I go hard
Just don't break my heart
I been on the drugs hard
Yeah, smokin' hard
