		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wake up with you lying next to me
Cold air flowing from the balcony
Taste like honey with the lips so sweet
Move my body like a dancing queen
Daisy chains all around my neck 
Don't need gold when we shine like this
Skinny dipping, we're all chilling on the deck 
Listening to songs from '76

Late night feelings
On a rooftop, spinning
And my hair's still dripping
By the fire, we're singing
'Bout the one we're missing
But I only want you this time
Yes

Salt waves on an ocean drive 
Left hand in between my thighs
Sunsets on a rosé sky
We're drinking that southern wine
Spark up in the neon light
Touch me like I'm dynamite
Won't you give me everything
Love me like a summer fling
Summer fling
Summer fling
Summer fling

I know they say that a girl can dream
Of all the joy that a boy can bring
Moonlight, cigarettes, card machines
Spending your money on girls and weed
Cross your fingers, tell me it's forever
Could we make it into September 
Leave me on the porch, take back your sweater
I'll be so cold when it hits December

Late night feelings
On a rooftop, spinning
And my hair's still dripping
By the fire, we're singing
'Bout the one we're missing
But I only want you this time
Yeah

Salt waves on an ocean drive 
Left hand in between my thighs
Sunsets on a rosé sky
We're drinking that southern wine
Spark up in the neon light
Touch me like I'm dynamite
Won't you give me everything
Love me like a summer fling
Summer fling
(Summer fling)
Summer fling

Hold me down for the summer
Say they'll never be another 
Burning up for each other 
Make me shiver under covers
If it's cool then I'm gonna
Say you wanna, say you wanna
Say you wanna be a summer fling

Hold me down for the summer
Say they'll never be another 
Burning up for each other 
Make me shiver under covers
If it's cool then I'm gonna
Say you want, say you wanna
Wanna be a summer fling

Salt waves on an ocean drive 
Left hand in between my thighs
Sunsets on a rosé sky
We're drinking that southern wine
Spark up in the neon light
Touch me like I'm dynamite
Won't you give me everything
Love me like a summer fling
Summer fling

Hold me down for the summer
Say they'll never be another 
Burning up for each other 
Make me shiver under covers
Gimme everything 
Leave me in the pouring rain
Say you want
Say you wanna be a summer fling

Hold me down for the summer
Say they'll never be another 
Burning up for each other 
Make me shiver under covers
Gimme everything 
Leave me in the pouring rain
Say you want
Say you wanna be a summer fling
