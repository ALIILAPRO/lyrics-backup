		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Light the scent to find yourself with us
Come with us to erase your pain away, yeah
Light the scent to find yourself with us
Follow the scent of light

It's our protector
Us in our dreams, yeah
I'll be your perfumer
Follow the light that beams through the mist, yeah, yeah
Need you to love me the right way
Raise me, hear me from my nightmares

Never let me go
Never let me go, ooh-whoa
Love me all night long
Love me all night long
You know where to find me, yeah
Call me to your dreams, yeah

Yeah, light the scent to find yourself with us
Come with us to erase your pain away, yeah
Light the scent to find yourself with us
Trust me to be your protector

Make me of your private island
You can find your refuge
Trust me, I'll find you
Something you know
And as you figure the truth
And you know that it's a make belief
But does it really matter?

(We)
(Whoa-uh)
(Uh-uh-uh)
(Whoa-whoa)
