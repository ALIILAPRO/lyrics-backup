		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm so young and you're so old, this, my darling I've been told
I don't care just what they say 'cause forever I will pray
You and I will be as free as the birds up in the trees
Oh, please, stay by me, Diana

Thrills I get when you hold me close, oh, my darling, you're the most
I love you but do you love me ? Oh Diana, can't you see
I love you with all my heart and I hope we will never part
Oh, please, stay with me, Diana

Oh my darlin', oh my lover, tell me that there is no other
I love you with my heart, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh

Only you can take my heart, only you can tear it apart
When you hold me in your loving arms
I can feel you giving all your charms
Hold me darling, hold me tight, squeeze me baby with all your might
Oh, please, stay by me Diana, oh, please, Diana.
