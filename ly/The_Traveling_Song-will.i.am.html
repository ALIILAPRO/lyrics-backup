		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been around the world in the pouring rain
Feeling out of place, really feeling strange
Take me to a place where they know my name
'Cause I ain't met nobody that looks the same

I'm a fish out of water, lion out of the jungle
He a fish out of water, lion out of the jungle
I need my peoples, my peoples, take me to my peoples
They got jungle fever, show him some love
Show him love

Could I have someone, could I have someone
To relate to, to relate to
Could I have someone, could I have someone
To relate to, to relate to

See I've been traveling, been traveling forever
But now that I've found a home
Feels like I'm in heaven

See I've been traveling, been traveling forever
But now that I'm home
Feels like I'm in heaven

See I've been traveling, been traveling forever
But now that I've found a home
Feels like I'm in heaven

Feels like I'm in heaven
Feels like I'm in heaven
Feels like I'm in heaven
Feels like I'm in heaven, heaven

Traveling the world like a touring man
Been around the planet in the foreign land
I've seen things that I've thought I've never seen
Take me to a place where they live like me

I'm a lion out the jungle, fish out of the ocean
He's a lion out the jungle, fish out of the ocean
I need my peoples, my peoples, take me to my peoples
They got jungle fever, show him some love
Show him love

Could I have someone, could I have someone
To relate to, to relate to
Could I have someone, could I have someone
To relate to, to relate to

See I've been traveling, been traveling forever
But now that I've found a home
Feels like I'm in heaven

See I've been traveling, been traveling forever
But now that I'm home
Feels like I'm in heaven

See I've been traveling, been traveling forever
But now that I've found a home
Feels like I'm in heaven

Feels like I'm in heaven
Feels like I'm in heaven
Feels like I'm in heaven
Feels like I'm in heaven, heaven

Feels like I'm in heaven
Feels like I'm in heaven
I'm in heaven

Oh and I'm feeling right at home
Feeling right at home
Feeling right at home
(I've been around the world)

I'm feeling right at home
Feeling right at home
Feeling right at home
Feeling like I'm in heaven

It's like I'm in heaven
It's like I'm in heaven, oh woah oh
I'm in heaven

It's like I'm in heaven
I'm in heaven
It's like I'm in heaven
I'm in heaven

Oh yeah
