		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I guess I'll try call her again

Thought we were something
But now we are nothing
I did something wrong
But I don't know what
Just want you to want me
But you just wanna leave me at the tone

Why don't you pick up the phone
When I'm all alone?
Do you hate me?
Hits me like a heart attack
When you don't call back
Someone save me

Why don't you pick up the phone
When I'm all alone?
Do you hate me?
Hits me like a heart attack
When you don't call back
Someone save me

It keeps ringing
On and on, on and on and 
On and on, on and on and 
On and on, on and on
On and on, on and on

I'm tired of waiting
Overcomplicating
Things will never change
Always stay the same
Better to be broken
So I'm just gonna leave you at the tone

Why don't you pick up the phone
When I'm all alone?
Do you hate me?
Hits me like a heart attack
When you don't call back
Someone save me

Why don't you pick up the phone
When I'm all alone?
Do you hate me?
Hits me like a heart attack
When you don't call back
Someone save me

It keeps ringing
On and on, on and on and 
On and on, on and on and 
On and on, on and on 
(Hello, no one is available to take your call
Please leave a message after the tone)

Why don't you pick up the phone
When I'm all alone?
Do you hate me? (Do you hate me?)
Hits me like a heart attack
When you don't call back
Someone save me (someone save me)

It keeps ringing
On and on, on and on and 
On and on, on and on and 
On and on, on and on
On and on, on and on and
