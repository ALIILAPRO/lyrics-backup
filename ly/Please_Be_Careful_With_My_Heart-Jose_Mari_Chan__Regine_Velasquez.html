		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you love me, like you tell me
Please be careful with my heart
You can take it, just don't break it
Or my world will fall apart
You are my first romance, and I'm willing to take a chance
That til life is through, I'll still be loving you
I will be true to you, just a promise from you will do
From the very start, please be careful with my heart

I love you and you know I do
There'll be no one else for me
Promise I'll be always true, for the world and all to see
Love has heard some lies softly spoken
And I have had my heart badly broken
I've been burned and I've been hurt before
So I know just how you feel, trust my love is real for you
I'll be gentle with your heart, I'll caress it like the morning dew
I'll be right beside you forever
I won't let our world fall apart
From the very start, I'll be careful with your heart

You are my first (and you are my last) romance
And I'm willing to take a chance (I've learned from the past)
That til life is through, I'll still be loving you
I will be true to you (only to you)
Just a promise from you will do
From the very start (from the very start)
From the very start (from the very start)
Please be careful with (I'll be careful with)
(Your) (my) heart
