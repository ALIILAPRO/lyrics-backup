		<p>
		  In the middle of the fake game 
The same proclaims made by the liars from the lost age 
Try to believe to know what you are
But you are not sure which side you're on from the start

Take a look all the junk we made 
The last corner you'll take will never lead you to the pearly gates
What else did we betray turn into a machine
We just gave it away to fit into the scene

Are you losing your way or are you lost?
Where are you going?

Tell me my hero where you're going
What do I need to end my war?
Hit me on the ground 
Hit me on the ground
Hit me on the ground 
Hit me on the ground

信じ 喜び 叶え 分かち合い
全てを捨て 今 立ち向かう

In the middle of the fake game 
The same proclaims made by the liars from the lost age 
Try to believe to know what you are (take it from the top, let me take it from the top)
But you are not sure which side you're on from the start (take it from the top, let me take it from the top)

Take a look all the junk we made (take it from the top, let me take it from the top)
The last corner you'll take will never lead you to the pearly gates (take it from the top, let me take it from the top)
What else did we betray turn into a machine (take it from the top, let me take it from the top)
We just gave it away to fit into the scene (take it from the top, let me take it from the top)

Are you losing your way or are you lost?
(Take it from the top, let me take it from the top)

Tell me my hero where you're going (take it from the top, let me take it from the top)
What do I need to end my war? (take it from the top, let me take it from the top)
Hit me on the ground (take it from the top, let me take it from the top)
Hit me on the ground (take it from the top, let me take it from the top)
Hit me on the ground (take it from the top, let me take it from the top)
Hit me on the ground (take it from the top, top, top, top, top, top, top, top, top. top)

信じ 喜び 叶え 分かち合い
全てを捨て 今 立ち向かう
(Take it from the top, let me get my groove on it)

Take it from the top
Let me get my groove on it 
Let me get a
