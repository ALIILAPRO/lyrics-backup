		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh, we can own the night, don't worry 'bout a thing
Don't worry 'bout a thing
Don't worry (woo)

Ooh, we can own the night, don't worry 'bout a thing
Don't worry 'bout a thing
Don't worry 'bout a thing

I know we'll be alright, don't worry 'bout a thing
Don't worry 'bout a thing
Don't worry 'bout a thing (c'mon)

I'll take you to the future
Forget about the past
You can keep all of your secrets
I swear that I won't ask
Let go of all your troubles
I don't care where you've been
The only thing that matters now
Is where the night will end

Them bright big lights are shining on us (uh-huh)
That beat so tight, it makes you wanna (you know)
Get up, get down like there's no tomorrow
Like there's no tomorrow (nah, nah)
Like there's no tomorrow

Ooh, we can own the night, don't worry 'bout a thing
Don't worry 'bout a thing
Don't worry 'bout a thing (hey)

I know we'll be alright, don't worry 'bout a thing
Don't worry 'bout a thing
Don't worry 'bout a thing (c'mon)

Ooh, we can own the night, don't worry 'bout a thing
Don't worry 'bout a thing
Don't worry 'bout a thing

Let's get down to business
Show me what you got
Just keep the record spinning
The music never stops
You wanna live forever
And reach above the stars
Let's take it to next level
Just light the spaceship up

Them bright big lights are shining on us (uh-huh)
That beat so tight, it makes you wanna (you know)
Get up, get down like there's no tomorrow
Like there's no tomorrow (nah, nah)
Like there's no tomorrow (woo)

Ooh, we can own the night, don't worry 'bout a thing
Don't worry 'bout a thing
Don't worry 'bout a thing (hey)

I know we'll be alright, don't worry 'bout a thing
Don't worry 'bout a thing
Don't worry 'bout a thing (c'mon)

Ooh, we can own the night, don't worry 'bout a thing
Don't worry 'bout a thing
Don't worry 'bout a thing

Yeah, on the rooftop
Surrounded by the stars and the view's hot (woo)
Ain't nobody thinking 'bout what you got
Everything's ours, wanna dip? Get a new spot
Yeah (yeah), don't worry, don't worry (uh)
Night never ends, no hurry, no hurry (uh)
Shorty look thick so the lines get blurry
And the night's in your palm so we might get dirty (woo)
DJ, let the beat play, make a heatwave when you replay this (huh)
Tonight we gon' party like its D-day
Young and free saying this the one on my CK shit
The moon is the light, the sky is the ceiling
Low is the bass and the high is the feeling
World is the club, all in 'cause we can
This one for the books, don't worry 'bout a thing, uh

Ooh, we can own the night, don't worry 'bout a thing (hey)
Don't worry 'bout a thing (hey)
Don't worry 'bout a thing (I got you)

I know we'll be alright, don't worry 'bout a thing (hey)
Don't worry 'bout a thing (hey)
Don't worry 'bout a thing

Don't worry 'bout a thing
Don't worry 'bout a thing
(C'mon)

Ooh, we can own the night, don't worry 'bout a thing
Don't worry 'bout a thing (huh, huh)
Don't worry 'bout a thing

I know we'll be alright, don't
