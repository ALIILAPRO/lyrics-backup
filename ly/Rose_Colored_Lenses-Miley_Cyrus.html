		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sunrise got us up early
So we put on our shades
Somehow, the bed sheets are dirty
Like sticky sweet lemonade

Never wanna leave this room
Daydream, déjà vu
If I had control over you

We could stay like this forever
Lost in wonderland
With our head above the clouds
Fallin' stupid like we're kids
Wearin' rose-colored lenses
Let's just play pretend
Wearin' rose-colored lenses
Pretend we'll never end

Naked in conversation
Drown me in your delight
Endless summer vacation
Make it last 'til we die

My baby got looks that kill (kill)
Make a mess of a nice hotel ('tel)
If I had control over you

We could stay like this forever
Lost in wonderland
With our head above the clouds
Fallin' stupid like we're kids
Wearin' rose-colored lenses
Let's just play pretend
Wearin' rose-colored lenses
Pretend we'll never end

Let's stay like this forever
Let's stay like this forever
Let's stay like this forever
Let's stay like this forever

We could stay like this forever
Lost in wonderland
With our head above the clouds
Fallin' stupid like we're kids
Wearin' rose-colored lenses
Let's just play pretend
Wearin' rose-colored lenses
Pretend we'll never end

(Let's stay like this forever)
Let's just keep pretending
(Let's stay like this forever)
(Let's stay like this forever)
Let's just keep pretending
(Let's stay like this forever)

Let's stay like this forever
Let's stay like this forever
Let's stay like this forever, oh, oh
Let's stay like this forever
Let's stay like this forever
Let's stay like this forever
