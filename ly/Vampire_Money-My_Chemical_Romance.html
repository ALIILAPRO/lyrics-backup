		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, are you ready, Ray? (yeah)
How about you, Frank?
Oh, I'm there, baby
How about you, Mikey?
Fucking ready
Well, I think I'm alright

One, two, three, four
Three, two, one we came to fuck
Everybody party 'til the gasman comes
Sparkle like Bowie in the morning sun
And get a parking violation on La Brea 'til it's done

Hair back, collar up, jet black, so cool
Sing it like the kids that are mean to you, c'mon

When you wanna be a movie star (c'mon)
Play the game and take the band real far (c'mon)
Play it right and drive a Volvo car (c'mon)
Pick a fight at an airport bar

The kids don't care if you're alright honey
Pills don't help but it sure is funny
Gimmie gimmie some of that vampire money c'mon

Oh, you look like somebody I used to love
Three, two, one we got the bomb
Everybody hurry 'til the taxman comes
Glimmer like Bolan in the morning sun
And get your finger on the trigger
Tap the barrel of the a gun

Hair back, motherfucker, jet black, so cool
Sing it like the kids that are mean to you (c'mon)

When you wanna be a movie star (c'mon)
Play the game and take band real far (c'mon)
Play it right and drive a Volvo car (c'mon)
Pick a fight at an airport bar

The kids don't care if you're all right honey
Pills don't help but it sure it's funny
Gimmie gimmie some of that vampire money c'mon

Oh fuck yeah
That's right
One, two, three, four

Well three, two, one we came to fuck
Everybody party 'til the gasman comes
Sparkle like Bowie in the morning sun
And get a parking violation on La Brea 'til it's done

Hair back, collar up, jet black, so cool
Sing it like the kids that are mean to you (c'mon)

When you wanna be a movie star (c'mon)
Play the game and take band real far (c'mon)
Play it right and drive a Volvo car (c'mon)
Pick a fight at an airport bar

The kids don't care if you're all right honey
Pills don't help but it sure is funny
Gimmie gimmie some of that vampire money c'mon
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
