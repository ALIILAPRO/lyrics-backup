		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All this talk of time never gauged it right
You drained the sea I liked
I swam in it, I tried digging

Would you let the waves divide again?
Would you let them break, a nicer end?

I'll never make the night
The levee breaks sometimes, but
A sequel might suffice
Took a graft in spite, still

(can't be slow) what if all we'll ever be
(can't be low) was in all the pleasantries?
(in your throat) What if all the levity
(I can't float) was distorted empathy?
