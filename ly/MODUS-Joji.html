		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Speed it up, slow it down
Need control, need it now
I need to live a thousand times
I cannot stop, I cannot cry
I will not fret, I will not die
I am machine, I stay alive
Sometimes I think, sometimes I think
Sometimes I think, sometimes I (woo)
I've got no aim, a million rounds
Is nothing real? A hunnid pounds
Of heavy steel, it feels so loud
Tied to my chest, it feels so loud
I'll take a peek to across the peaks
This grass is neat, I'm quite unique
But I'd like to be, but I'd like to be

And I hope this is the hardest part
We try, we try
And when they say they're satisfied
They're lying, they're lying
Do forgive me, I've seen the treasure is in the bloom
But right now I'm just not strong enough for you

Sorry, you can see it in my retina
Focus in and out, I'm doin' better
Artificial ghost with no perception
I wanna be a Chevy not a Sentra (yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah)
I don't feel the way they programmed me to feel today
Some pieces fallin' from the waist up, I'm so sorry for delays
Just need one moment to erase that burning pain before the rage
I feel good, I feel good, I feel good, I fixed it

And I hope this is the hardest part
We try, we try
And when they say they're satisfied
They're lying, they're lying
Do forgive me, I've seen the treasure is in the bloom
But right now I'm just not strong enough for you

And I hope this is the hardest part
We try, we try
And when they say they're satisfied
They're lying, they're lying
Do forgive me, I've seen the treasure is in the bloom
But right now I'm just not strong enough for you
