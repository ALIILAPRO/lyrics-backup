		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wanna love you more than I love myself
I don't wanna let you go to hell
But it feels like sometimes 
That's all that we do

Argue and we fight
Make up every night
Do it all again in the morning
Yeah, we on repeat, repeat

Yeah, you got me on loop
I don't know what to do
Got me on repeat, repeat
Always on repeat, repeat, oh-oh-oh

I'm losing my mind
Every time you kiss my lips I want it bad
It feels so good

Yeah, you're in my head even when you're not in my bed
Who is here instead?
My other baby
Yeah, you got me on

Do it all again in the morning
Yeah, we on repeat, repeat
Yeah, you got me on loop

Oh-oh-oh, I'm losing my mind
Every time you kiss my lips I want it bad
It feels so good

Yeah, you're in my head even when you're not in my bed
Who is here instead?
My other baby, yeah

Argue and we fight
Make up every night
Do it all again in the morning
Yeah, we on repeat, repeat

Yeah, you got me on loop
I don't know what to do
We stuck on repeat, repeat
Always on repeat, repeat

Wanna love you more than I love myself
I don't wanna let you go to hell
But it feels like sometimes 
That's all that we do

Argue and we fight
Make up every night
Do it all again in the morning
Yeah, we on repeat, repeat

Yeah, you got me on loop
I don't know what to do
Got me on repeat, repeat
Always on repeat, repeat

Yeah, you got me on

Oh-oh-oh, I'm losing my mind
Every time you kiss my lips I want it bad
It feels so good

Yeah, you're in my head even when you're not in my bed
Who is here instead?
My other baby, yeah

Argue and we fight
Make up every night
Do it all again in the morning
Yeah, we on repeat, repeat

Yeah, you got me on loop
I don't know what to do
We stuck on repeat, repeat
Always on repeat, repeat
