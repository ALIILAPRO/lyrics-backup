		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take me home
To the place where I'm from
Oh, darling, you'll understand
When you come with me

Take me there
Where the mountain meets the street
And all the things we are
They're made for loving

Take me home
To the place where I'm from
Oh, darling, you'll understand
When you come with me

Take me home
Take me home

Take me home
To the place where I'm from
Oh, under the water we will go

Take me there
Where the mountain children roam
Oh, darling, you'll understand
When you come home

Take me home
Take me home
Take me home
Take me home

Take me home
To the place where I'm from
Oh, darling, you'll understand
When you come with me
