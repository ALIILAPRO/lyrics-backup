		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Friends are made along the way
In a journey you can't recreate
In these moments I lose focus
I never overcomplicate
I know the way I operate
In these moments

I have to move to feel like me
Just understand it's what I need
In these moments I lose focus
So never overcomplicate
Just know the way you operate
In these moments

Oh I feel as though I'm moving this time
So don't try to stop me now
No don't try to stop me now

In these moments
In these moments
In these moments
In these moments

In these moments
In these moments
In these moments
In these moments

In these moments
In these moments
In these moments
In these moments

In these moments
