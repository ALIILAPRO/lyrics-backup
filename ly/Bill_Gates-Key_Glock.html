Phew, this money give me chills

Yeah, rich as Bill Gates, yeah, rich as Bill Gates
I got one thing on my bucket list, get rich as Bill Gates (yeah)
Yeah, Bill Gates, get rich as Bill Gates
I got one thing on my bucket list, get rich as Bill Gates

I got on thing on my bucket list, get rich as Elon Musk (yeah)
Got this one lil' pretty bitch, she tryna come and clean me up
Yeah, I been sippin' so much Wock' and Tris, yeah, I can't get enough (uh-uh)
I try to hide it from my mama 'cause she hate I drink that stuff (uh-huh)
Yeah, I'm the one, no runner up (uh-uh), bitch, I'm the shit, got bubble guts (uh-huh)
I hope you don't play runnin' up (uh-uh), that cutter give 'em a tummy tuck (uh-huh)

Yeah, my niggas they purge for fun, they mask up like a Comic-Con (baow)

Phew (yeah), this money give me chills (chills)
Ayy, I been stackin' up my coins ever since I was little (little)
Ayy, ever since I jumped off the porch, I've been in the field (field)
Ayy, I got one thing on my bucket list, get rich as Bill Gates (yeah)
Yeah, rich as Bill Gates, yeah, rich as Bill Gates
I got one thing on my bucket list, get rich as Bill Gates (yeah)
Yeah, Bill Gates, get rich as Bill Gates
I got one thing on my bucket list, get rich as Bill Gates

Yeah, I got one thing on my bucket list, get rich as Warren Buffett
Yeah, I can't wait to drop a ticket on a watch like it ain't nothin'
Yeah, I just hopped up out that droptop, smokin' indo' out in public
Yeah, and if it ain't about no money, end of the discussion
Yeah, I been sippin' on some 'Tussin, movin' really sluggish
Yeah, I been slippin' with my chopper, she might cut it funny
Yeah, nigga kept doin' all the talkin', hit him and his buddy
Yeah, yeah, yeah, bullets fly if I press that button (yeah)

Phew (yeah), this money give me chills (chills)
Ayy, I been stackin' up my coins ever since I was little (little)
Ayy, ever since I jumped off the porch, I've been in the field (field)
Ayy, I got one thing on my bucket list, get rich as Bill Gates (yeah)
Yeah, rich as Bill Gates, yeah, rich as Bill Gates
I got one thing on my bucket list, get rich as Bill Gates (yeah)
Yeah, Bill Gates, get rich as Bill Gates
I got one thing on my bucket list, get rich as Bill Gates (yeah)
