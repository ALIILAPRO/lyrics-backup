		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's a voice I always trust
Its friendly helping hand tells me leave, I must

'Cause I can't stay forever, ah
'Cause I can't stay forever, ah
By my window

Rather chase a gentle breeze
Set my thoughts by taller trees

'Cause I can't stay forever, ah
'Cause I can't stay forever, ah
By my window

'Cause I can't stay forever
'Cause I can't stay forever
'Cause I can't stay forever
'Cause I can't stay forever

There's a voice I always trust
Its friendly helping hand tells me leave, I must

'Cause I can't stay forever, ah
'Cause I can't stay forever, ah
By my window

'Cause I can't stay forever
'Cause I can't stay forever
'Cause I can't stay forever
'Cause I can't stay forever
