		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, I I I just walked
In, I'm the richest nigga
Let's go band for band (Sauron)
I'm the man, I said, "Fuck my ex
" won't see that bitch again
Rubber band, I'm the rubber band
Rubber band man i got hoes just so that you
Know she probably one of those at the show
None my opps better be posted at the show
Give a fuck what you heard about
Or what you fuckin' know bitch, I'm posted
With a Glock 43 up under this coat
Nigga try me then I put him on
A bench like I'm the coach

Hoes mad, I'd be mad too, I'm all a ho had
Hit the scene, my hoe 38
She ridin' in that Jag
AMG GT 53, you see me ridin' past
Pretty E, bitch, I'm pretty Eem
Thе nigga of your dreams
Watch your tone when you spеak to me (yeah)
'Cause I rock with a real piece on me
I heard that boy wanna feature me
But he can't afford my feature fee (Ha ha ha)
Move out the hood to the suburbs
I be where all my teachers be (Ha)
Get off your ass and get you a job
That's where your broke ass need to be

I just walked in, I'm the richest nigga
Let's go band for band
I'm the man, I said, "Fuck my ex
" won't see that bitch again (Ha)
Rubber band, I'm the rubber band
Rubber band man i got hoes just so that you
Know she probably one of those at the show
None my opps better be posted at the show
Give a fuck what you heard about
Or what you fuckin' know bitch, I'm posted
With a Glock 43 up under this coat
Nigga try me then I put him on
A bench like I'm the coach

Uh, I went from rags to riches
Bitches you have
(Sauron) I had them bitches (yeah)
I'm the only nigga from my fuckin' city to
Run up a milly on my business (On God)
And I keep it fifty-fifty
Not a hundred 'cause I do not
Trust you with my business
Call me Walt White in the fuckin' studio
Cookin' like I am a chemist
If I said shit then I meant it, uh
You a bad liar and you broke (That's tough)
You still owe me money, bruh
Don't act like it's up
She came through with her friend
I ain't fuckin this up
She a goth bitch so I'm fucking her rough
So focused on money I can't fall in love
Only put my trust in the powers up above
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, I I I just walked
In, I'm the richest nigga
Let's go band for band (yeah)
I'm the man, I said, "Fuck my ex
" won't see that bitch again (Ha)
Rubber band, I'm the rubber band
Rubber band man i got hoes just so that you
Know she probably one of those at the show
None my opps better be posted at the show
(yeah) give a fuck what you heard about
Or what you fuckin' know (On God)
Bitch, I'm posted
With a Glock 43 up under this coat
Nigga try me then I put him on
A bench like I'm the coach (yeah)
