		  Paradise
Paradise
Paradise
Paradise
Paradise
Paradise
Paradise

As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I take a look at my life and realize there's nothin' left
'Cause I've been blastin' and laughin' so long
That even my momma thinks that my mind is gone
But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it
Me be treated like a punk, you know that's unheard of
You better watch how you talkin' and where you walkin'
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk

We been spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
We been spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
We been spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
We been spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise

I really hate to trip, but I gotta loc
As they croak, I see myself in the pistol smoke
Fool, I'm the kinda G the little homies wanna be like
On my knees in the night, sayin' prayers in the streetlight

Ain't no gangsta's livin' in paradise
Ain't no gangsta's livin' in paradise
Ain't no gangsta's livin' in paradise
Ain't no gangsta's livin' in paradise

Paradise
Paradise
Paradise
Paradise
Paradise
Paradise
Paradise
Pa-paradise

Power and the money, money and the power
Minute after minute, hour after hour
Everybody's running, but half of them ain't lookin'
It's going on in the kitchen, but I don't know what's cookin'
They say I gotta learn, but nobody's here to teach me
If they can't understand it, how can they reach me?
I guess they can't, I guess they won't
I guess they front, that's why I know my life is out of luck, fool

Paradise

Ain't no gangsta's livin' in paradise
Ain't no gangsta's livin' in paradise
Ain't no gangsta's livin' in paradise
Ain't no gangsta's livin' in paradise

Paradise
Paradise
Paradise
Paradise
Paradise
Paradise
Paradise
Paradise
