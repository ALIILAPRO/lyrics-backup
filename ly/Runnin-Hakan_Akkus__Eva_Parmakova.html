		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm lovin' the way that you touch me
Feelin' as good as the summer
Our love doesn't need any money
Your eyes struck me hard as a thunder

I imagine us in a Rover
Driving till the road is over
You're the sand, i'm the ocean 
Baby, I can breathe underwater yeah

Forget the issues
Cause we're runnin away for good, baby
Runnin away cause we could, baby
Runnin away for good, baby
We're runnin as far as we could, baby
Living the life that we should have
We're runnin away for good, baby
We're runnin, runnin, runnin baby 
We're runnin, runnin, runnin woo-hoo 
We're runnin, runnin, runnin baby

We're runnin away for good

Memories coming back
You're coming so hard but you're going so fast
Another heart attack
Forgot the messages, they're in the past

I imagine us in a Rover
Driving till the road is over
You're the sand, i'm the ocean 
Baby, I can breathe underwater yeah
I can breathe underwater yeah

Forget the issues
Cause we're runnin away for good, baby
Runnin away cause we could, baby
Runnin away for good, baby
We're runnin as far as we could, baby
Living the life that we should have
We're runnin away for good, baby
We're runnin, runnin, runnin baby 
We're runnin, runnin, runnin woo-hoo 
We're runnin, runnin, runnin baby
We're runnin away for good
