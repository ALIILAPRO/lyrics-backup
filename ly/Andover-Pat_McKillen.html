		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Running home like a midnight ghost
& the hearts I stole are bleeding on
All alone, chasing miles of road
And the street lights glow, off and gone
Now I've got
Holes in the bottom of my shoes
Drawers that ain't being used
Eyes that ask too much
Scars that ain't been touched
Words to prove you right
Tears to last all night
Oh, babe, you've been through hell
Your hands they ain't been held
Andover
Andover
Andover
So it goes that the ones you know
They're the ones you hurt the most
And I don't know my way back home
Girl, I lost my place long ago
Now I've got
Holes in the bottom of my shoes
Drawers that ain't being used
Eyes that ask too much
Scars that ain't been touched
Words to prove you right
Tears to last all night
Oh, babe, you've been through hell
Your hands they ain't been held
Andover
(Andover)
Andover
(Andover)
Andover
(Andover)
Oh, I know
No, No, No
Andover
(Andover)
Andover
(Andover)
Leave me on the road
(Andover)
But oh, my love
Won't you leave me to the highways?
Leave me to the night trains I call home
But oh, my love
Won't you leave me to the toll roads?
Leave to the west coast I don't know
Now I've got
Holes in the bottom of my shoes
Drawers that ain't being used
Eyes that ask too much
I got scars that ain't been touched
Words to prove you right
Tears to last all night
Oh, babe, you've been through hell
Your hands they ain't been held
Andover
(Andover)
Andover
(Andover)
Andover
(Andover)
Oh, I know
No, no, no
Andover
(Andover)
Andover
(Andover)
Andover
(Andover)
I'm gone
