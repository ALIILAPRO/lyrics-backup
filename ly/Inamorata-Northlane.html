		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You drained my lungs of water
so i could breathe
my ankles locked in concrete
you broke me free

repaired my twisted vision
and calmed the tide
you told me I was homebound
now i've arrived

my love, inamorata
i'm whole again
your light, it's shining through me
my flame ascends

now it's my turn to burn for you
it's my turn to burn you

I know it's not been easy to bear my weight
but from your boundless patience
my panic disapates

so if you stumble
i'll wear the strain
my loyalty
it's been engrained

my love, inamorata
i'm whole again
your light, it's shining through me
my flame ascends

now it's my turn to burn for you
it's my turn to burn you

aurora, break my dawn
rebuilt, reshaped, restored
aurora, break my dawn

my love, inamorata
i'm whole again
your light, it's shining through me
my flame ascends

my love, inamorata
i'm whole again
your light, it's shining through me
my flame ascends

now it's my turn to burn for you
it's my turn to burn you

aurora, break my dawn
my love, inamorata
i'm whole again
