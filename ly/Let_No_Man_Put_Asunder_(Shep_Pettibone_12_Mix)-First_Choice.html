		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm surprised to see your suitcase at the door 
(I'm surprised, surprised)
Remember the good times
Don't you want some more? (Don't you want it?)
It's not a perfect love but I'll defend it (surprised)
'Cause I believe that's what God intended

We got a love too good to throw away

It's not over between you and me
It's not over, I don't want to be free
I don't wanna, I don't wanna be free

What has been joined by God (by God)
By God (by God)
Let no man put asunder (no, no, no)
Don't throw it away (don't throw it away)

I can hear those words spoken as we stood (there we stood)
Making vows to love in times of bad or good (don't you want it?)
I'm convinced that what is meant to be will be (it will be)
Even the stars declare that you belong to me 

We got a love too good to throw away

It's not over between you and me
It's not over
I don't wanna, I don't wanna be free

What has been joined by God (by God)
By God (by God)
Let no man put asunder (no, no, no)
Don't throw it away (don't throw it away)
Hey

(Mmh, mmh, mmh, ayy, oh, yeah)

It's not over
Don't wanna be free
I don't wanna be free

It's not over
It's not over, it's not over
I don't wanna, I don't wanna be free
It's not over
'Cause I need ya, 'cause I want ya
I gotta have you every day of my doggone life

It's not over
It's not over, no, no, no, no
Hey, It's not over
It's not over
Hey, I wanna love you some more, more, more
Squeeze me tight, hold me right all night (it's not over)
Baby, baby

Oh shucks, oh shucks
Oh shucks, oh shucks
Woo, woo
No, no, got to have you
Woo, woo
I got something that you don't ever wanna turn down
I got something for your mind, your body, and your soul (soul)

Right now, right now, baby
You can have it if you want it
Oh, I'll make your home a sweet paradise
I'll make everything all right
Everything, baby
I don't ever wanna get carried in nobody else but you, baby
You hear what I'm sayin'? You get what I'm coming from?
Hey
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no

Come on and love me some more
Make sweet love to me all the night

It's not over (between you and me)
It's not over (ay, I don't wanna, I don't wanna be free)
It's not over (doo-doo-doo-doo)
It's not over ('cause I want ya, 'cause I need ya)
It's not over (I gotta have you every day of my doggone life)
It's not over (it's not over, no, no)
It's not over (it's not over, no)

It's not over (hey, don't leave me this way)
It's not over (hey, I wanna love you some more, more, more)
It's not over (squeeze me tight, hold me right all night)
It's not over
It's not over (it's not over, it's not over)
It's not over (it's not over, it's not over)
It's not over (it's not over, it's not over)
It's not over (it's not over, it's not over)

It's not over (hey, I want ya, I gotta have ya)
It's not over (I'm gonna need you right by my side)
It's not over (it's not over, no, no)
It's not over (between you and me)
It's not over (hey, hey, baby)

It's not over between you and me (no, no, no, no, no, no, no)
It's not over I don't want to be free 
('Cause I want ya, gotta have ya)

It's not over ('cause I need you every day of my doggone life)
It's not over (hey, hey, baby)
It's not over ('cause I want ya, I need you right now)
It's not over (right by my side, yeah)
It's not over (yeah, yeah, hey, yeam)
It's not over (it's not over, no, no)
It's not over (no, no, no, no)
It's not over (it's not over, it's not over)
It's not over (between you and me, yeah)
It's not over (hey, hey, baby)
It's not over (hey, 'cause I need ya, 'cause I want ya)
It's not over (I gotta have ya every day of my life)
It's not over (ay, ay, ay, oh, baby)
It's not over (sing it girls, sing it to me)
It's not over (it's not over, no, no, no, no)
It's not over (between you and me)
It's not over ('cause I don't want to be free)
It's not over (it's not over)
It's not over
