		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Statik Selektah)

It's been a minute since I took some time to just chill and hit the lab alone
Normally tagalongs tagalong
So pardon me cause I babble on
Don't matter what beat that I'm rappin' on
Just give me a mic turn that Apple on
Was doubtin' myself in the lab I forgot who I was til I put (?) on
My demons are deep in the dark now
My angels are playing the harp now
I split it and break the cigar down
I'm chillin' just playin' my part now
We're 10, 000 miles from the start now
We're 10, 000 hours apart now
I trust myself with all my instincts
I followed it look what my heart found
2006 we takin' BART down
To downtown hit licks when it's dark out
Until I got locked up in caught now
With my bro like Oh Brother Where Art Thou
Fast forward and I'm a big star now
Spider Man climbing the charts now
You don't put no fear in me nobody lyrically near to me makin' my heart pound
I know I'm highly unusual
I know sometimes I'm confusing you
Talkin' fast hope I'm not losing you
Like rappity rappity bloo doot doo
This industries crazy if you only knew about half of the shit that they do to you
There's not many people who know me like really the real me it's only a few of you
Whole lot of yes men around me
Tellin' me yeah that shit's fire bro
Trust I can tell when you lying though
You work for me you can get fired bro
My phone ringing I got a higher calling
I'm high but I'm tryna climb higher though
I work so much they thinkin' I'm a robot
That's just how I'm wired though
50k just for the charter jet
Gulfstream this ain't no starter jet
Aim for the stars see how far you get
But you ain't Drake you ain't Tha Carter yet
Follow the Blueprint Shawn Carter set
Draw it all out like an architect
But sometimes when I go compare myself
I feel like I ain't even started yet
Fuck
Writin' this verse while I'm pacing this rug
In it for life ain't no faking this love
They wanna know why Ger stays in the club if this shit gets you high then I'm taking this drug
Therapist says it's a hole in my chest I hope one day I finally replace it with love
They say this shit gon' come back to bite you be careful karma's the patient-est thug
