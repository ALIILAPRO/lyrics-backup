		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Pnb, Pop Smoke don't give no fucks
Nigga check the score board, bitch 'cause we up

I threw a opp back in the air in my McLaren (woo)
I put eight racks of baguettes up in my earrings (woo)
I'm dripped in vLone, that's what I'm wearing (woo)
Trey close to kilo, ain't ordinary (woo)
I threw a opp back in the air in my McLaren (woo)
I put eight racks of baguettes up in my earrings (woo)
I'm dripped in vLone, that's what I'm wearing (woo)
Trey close to kilo, ain't ordinary (woo), look

Life is short
I don't wanna go to court (woo)
Hop in my Porsche, dripped in vLone (woo)
Teddy Brukshot, give that boy a one shot (woo)
Laser ain't no dot, tag him wit a square (woo)
Tell that boy he Crip, uh, one in the head (woo)
Send shots at his head, bet that boy won't live (woo)
I don't give a fuck, 'cause all my friends is dead (woo)
So I just stack my paper, Glock 9 hold a laser (woo)
She came from Alabama, it hit like 9/11 (woo)
Treesh at my crib 8:45, she out by 9:11 (woo)
She got like hella bodies, I'm always percolated (woo)
And I won't miss a payment, I'm so sophisticated (woo)
Blunt like I'm an Oakland raider, tell her work Rihanna
Call Batman, I'm Robin (woo)
40k to do a show up in Ali Baba
If I call Ace, he gon' throw you off the stage
In his Cartiers (woo)

I threw a opp back in the air in my McLaren (woo)
I put eight racks of baguettes up in my earrings (woo)
I'm dripped in vLone, that's what I'm wearing (woo)
Trey close to kilo, ain't ordinary (woo)
I threw a opp back in the air in my McLaren (woo)
I put eight racks of baguettes up in my earrings (woo)
I'm dripped in vLone, that's what I'm wearing (woo)
Trey close to kilo, ain't ordinary (woo)

Oh yeah
We just upped the score today
Yeah we just dropped two more today
We do this like its ordinary
I swear I can't wait 'til some more get buried
Hold on, what's that? Bd, rush that
Opps tried to score but that shit was a touchback
Spin the block turn that nigga into a dust pack
Heard he had the glizzy but ain't get to bust that
Oh goddamn that's tragic, we making shit disappear like magic
Just hit a lick wit a bad bitch
She threw the 'oop on one of these rappers
She said they in the hotel (lacking)
One thing about her she don't do no cappin'
So I send Seal and Bron, they running in your shit 
And I don't know what happened (gimme that shit nigga) 
vLone on me, drip, she all on my, dick
She wanna fuck 'cause I'm lit (I'm lit)
I know some bitches that play with them pieces
They came in this bitch with their own bodies (they got it)
We throwing money in the air, this ain't even the strip club
But we all wildin' (we wildin')

I threw a opp back in the air in my McLaren (woo)
I put eight racks of baguettes up in my earrings (woo)
I'm dripped in vLone, that's what I'm wearing (woo)
Trey close to kilo, ain't ordinary (woo)
I threw a opp back in the air in my McLaren (woo)
I put eight racks of baguettes up in my earrings (woo)
I'm dripped in vLone, that's what I'm wearing (woo)
Trey close to kilo, ain't ordinary (woo)
