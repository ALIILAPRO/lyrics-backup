		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Came out my mama's pussy with my dick in my hand
Slapped the nurse's ass and said, "I'm your man"
By the time I got to juvey I was knockin' 'em down
I was a teenage pussy hound

Girl, just your luck
I was born to fuck
Girl, just your luck
I was born to fuck

Now I'm a big time star on a big tour bus
Gotta load o' bitches hangin' on my nuts
And I give all to 'em baby, one at a time
You wanna suck my dick you better get in that line

Girl, just your luck
I was born to fuck
Girl, just your luck
I was born to fuck

The Lord blesses us all with different gifts
On the day he made me he spent all his time on my dick
My big ass dick

Girl, just your luck
I was born to fuck
Girl, just your luck
I was born to fuck

Bitch, spread your butt
And take it like a slut
Girl, just your luck
I was born to f-f-f-f-f-f-fuck

I was born to f-f-f-f-f-f-fuck
