		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Are you ready?
Come on, come on
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Don't let me talk to you, honey
Don't let me see you
Don't let me try to think anything away from you
Just try to hurt me, just try to round me
Think she's got to reach, you never talk, talk, talk, no

Talk, talk, talk, no
She just to see, ah
Talk, talk, talk, no
Won't you so pretty, so talk!

I'm knock, knock, knockin'
Knock, knock, knockin'
Knockin' on the back of your door

Ooh, I'm knock, knock, knockin'
Knock, knock, knockin'
Knockin' on the back of your door

Oh, baby, I'm knock, knock, knockin'
Knock, knock, knockin'
Knockin' on the back of your door

Oh, baby, I'm knock, knock, knockin'
Knock, knock, knockin'
Knockin', can you hear me?
Come on, let me sing it!

Oh, we sing in jungle, it's a deep, deep jungle to do, aha
Oh, we sing in jungle, it's a deep, deep jungle to do

Baby, I'm knock, knock, knockin'
Knock, knock, knockin'
Knockin' on the back of your door

Knock, knock, knockin'
Knock, knock, knockin'
Knockin' on the back of your door

Oh, baby, I'm knock, knock, knockin'
Knock, knock, knockin'
Knockin' on the back of your door

Oh, baby, I'm knock, knock, knockin'
Knock, knock, knockin'
Knockin', can't you hear me?
Come on, let me sing it!

Oh, we sing in jungle, it's a deep, deep jungle to do, sing it
Oh, we sing in jungle, it's a deep, deep jungle to do

Ah, lemme talk to you!

Baby, I'm knock, knock, knockin'
Knock, knock, knockin'
Knockin' on the back of your door

Knock, knock, knockin'
Knock, knock, knockin'
Knockin' on the back of your door

Oh, baby, I'm knock, knock, knockin'
Knock, knock, knockin'
Knockin' on the back of your door

Oh, baby, I'm knock, knock, knockin'
Knock, knock, knockin'
