		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The biggest piece of me I put in your hands
You said you'd hold onto it
Oh silly little me I know you know best
So make it make sense

Oh I hope you know
You made me feel so impossible

No you don't get to
Make this about you
Just 'cause we let this bridge stand doesn't mean I'm not angry about you
It's not something we outgrew
We're tied up in half-truths
Why should I share all the blame like you're sorry when we know that's not true
You're sorry I caught you
Mmm
Mmm

Two years over my head
Kept it under your breath
And you know the worst part of it
It'd keep growing and taking me down with it
If I were oblivious

I hope you know
You made me feel so impossible

No you don't get to
Make this about you
Just 'cause we let this bridge stand doesn't mean I'm not angry about you
It's not something we outgrew
We're tied up in half-truths
Why should I share all the blame like you're sorry when we know that's not true
You're sorry I caught you
Mmm
Mmm

I can't get too angry 'cause that's a bad look
So I won't let it phase me 'cause you wrote the book
I just follow it plainly
And look where it brought us the end of the ending
No I won't get angry 'cause that's how this goes
You just swallow your sanity
And hope someday someone will hold on tightly
'Cause that's what I hoped you'd do

No you don't get to
Mmm
No don't get to
