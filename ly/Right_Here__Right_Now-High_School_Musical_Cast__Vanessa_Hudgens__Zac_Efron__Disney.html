		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hm yeah, yeah yeah
Can you imagine what would happen
If we could have any dream
I'd wish this moment was ours to own it
And that it would never leave
Then I would thank that star
That made our wish come true, oh yeah (come true)
'Cause he knows that where you are
Is where I should be too

Right here, right now
Lookin' at you and my heart loves the view
'Cause you mean everything
Right here, I promise you somehow
Tomorrow can wait for some other day to be (to be)

But right now there's you and me

If this was forever,
What could be better
I already proved it was
But if 2123 hours
Of bending the universe
It's going to make everything
In our whole world change (it'll start to change)
And you know that where we are
Will never be the same

Right here, right now (right now)
Lookin' at you and my heart loves the view
'Cause you mean everything (everything)
Right here, I promise you somehow (somehow we're gonna)
Tomorrow can wait for some other day to be (to be)
But right now there's you and me

Oh we know it's comin'
And it's comin' fast
As long as there's you and me (oh yeah)
So lets make every second last, make it last

Right here, right now
Yeah lookin' at you and my heart loves the view
You mean everything
Right here, I promise you somehow
That tomorrow can wait for some other day to be (to be)
But right now there's you and me
You and me
You and me
Oh you and me
But right now there's you and me
