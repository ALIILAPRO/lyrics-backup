		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One for the money, two for the show, now clap your hands if you wanna go home
One for the money, two for the show, now clap your hands if you wanna go home
Bitch I do I been here before it feel like deja vu
Who is you? Peeped you getting caught up like a pikachu
One for the money, two for the show, now clap your hands if you wanna go home

This dude next to me going out sad he on his phone now
Hasn't moved an inch even when they dancers brough patrone out
Fuck the cops but my gang out in the back lot doing donuts
If you really claim you about it then you probably would've shown us

And if you wanna be a star we'll put the bloodbath right on youtube (on the gang)
You a clone but you not better you not mewtwo (you too fake)
Original god zenbu yaritai suru (so deranged)
Shawty wanna ride midnight express going choo choo (like a train)

And its all the same shit that ive seen before
I told ryo grab the camera and just hit record
Anime im a reanimated corpse
They all want ability power and form

One for the money, two for the show, now clap your hands if you wanna go home
One for the money, two for the show, now clap your hands if you wanna go home
Bitch I do I been here before it feel like deja vu
Who is you? Peeped you getting caught up like a pikachu
One for the money, two for the show, now clap your hands if you wanna go home
