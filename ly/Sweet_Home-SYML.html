		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Never have I seen a place
That reminds me of your face
'Til I heard it call to me
Like a phone call from a friend

Set in silence, like a prayer
If these walls could breathe the air
They would sing a song of love
And how it sometimes has to end

Welcome home, your last and only one
Never more to roam
Have no fear if you don't see the sun
I will hold you close
Welcome home, you are home
No, nothing tastes like sweet, sweet home

Letters written in the den
Folded news and coffee cans
Simple things that I recall
Not forgotten easily

Dog is passed out on the lawn
He will miss me when I'm gone
He won't speak what he has seen
Like the walls surrounding me

Welcome home, your last and only one
Never more to roam
Have no fear if you don't see the sun
I will hold you close
Welcome home, you are home
No, nothing tastes like sweet, sweet home

Welcome home, your last and only one
Never more to roam
Have no fear if you don't see the sun
I will hold you close
Welcome home, you are home
No, nothing tastes like sweet
Nothing tastes like sweet
Nothing tastes like sweet, sweet home
