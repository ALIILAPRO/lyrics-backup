		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A whispering silence
A call looming from beyond
A longing for sleep that brings
Rest from all the grief
Past friends, past lovers
Past all the earthly content
I found volition
In self-abandonment
See the fortress
Wiped out by rain and hail
Standing in the dim light
Of an Evenstar
Breaching the core
Exploding into a thousand gleaming sparks
For all to see
The storm is settling
The fortress lies in ruins
Just to be built anew
Staring into the void
Black static fills the eyes
I’m driving the blazing lance
Into the heart of darkness
So for all the deeds left undone
All the words unspoken
I bid thee farewell my friend
Forever
Forever fare thee well
Or can’t you hear
The whispers in the deep?
Flickering flames are slowly gathering
To burst into a new sun
A star born from the gaping hollows
Of a lonesome heart
This legacy of a broken soul
Carry it out into the world
So the new disciples
They shall follow the longest trail
At last he is calling me home
Back into the mirk
I bid thee farewell my friend
So forever fare thee well
A few moments may remain
To stand atop the pantheon of dreams
Its shadow
Cast into the emptiness inside
Victorious beneath
The wavering stars
And scattered clouds
Victorious beneath
The wavering stars
And scattered
Clouds
