		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My ear to the door you
Got his name on your breathe
My blood on the floor
I got your knife in my chest
Ya ya ya ya
You make me depressed
Ya ya ya ya
You make me depressed
Oh I got some things on my chest
While you play dumb and
Lay your body on his
It's the same old situation
Got you stuck in my head
It's plays like carbon copy reruns
Of you fucking my friends and
It goes on and on
It goes on and on
On and on
It goes on and on
My ear to the door you
Got his name on your breathe
My blood on the floor
I got your knife in my chest
Ya ya ya ya
You make me depressed
Ya ya ya ya
You make me depressed
Look at him
Think of me
While you go down
Tried to block
Out the noise
But you're so loud
Do you walk how you talk
When your down on your knees
I can still smell the taste
When you're talking to me
It goes on and on
It goes On and on
On and on
It goes on and on
My ear to the door you
Got his name on your breathe
My blood on the floor
I got your knife in my chest
Ya ya ya ya
You make me depressed
Ya ya ya ya
You make me depressed
I've been here before
How did I do this again
I thought we were more
Too bad you couldn't care less
Ya ya ya ya
You make me depressed
Ya ya ya ya
You make me depressed
