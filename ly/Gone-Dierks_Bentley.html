		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My buddies think I'm on the lake
Boss thinks I've been sick for days
And mama's probably on her way
'Cause I ain't picked up the phone

I've been a million places
But they're all up in my head
Over-drinkin', overthinkin' ever since you left

I've been gone, I've been gone
I've been sittin' on the couch watchin' TV all day long
All-day long, I've been tryna figure out how a good thing went wrong
Faster than that freight train, farther than that airplane
Sadder than a country song
Headed down that highway, anywhere but my way
Ever since you moved on, I've been gone

Took a trip down memory lane
Checked into hotel heartbreak
Passed rock bottom on the way
Without leavin' my livin' room

I've been a million places
But they're all up in my head
Over-drinkin', overthinkin' ever since you left

I've been gone, I've been gone
I've been sittin' on the couch watchin' TV all day long
All-day long, I've been tryna figure out how a good thing went wrong
Faster than that freight train, farther than that airplane
Sadder than a country song
Headed down that highway, anywhere but my way
Ever since you moved on, I've been gone
Yeah, I've been gone

All the clothes are on the floor
All the mail's by the door
All the whiskey bottles in my bed
All the dishes in the sink
All the gas is in the tank
All the neighbors probably think I'm dead

I've been gone, I've been gone
I've been sittin' on the couch watchin' TV all day long
All-day long, I've been tryna figure out how a good thing went wrong
Faster than that freight train, farther than that airplane
Sadder than a country song
Headed down that highway, anywhere but my way
Ever since you moved on, I've been gone

I've been gone
Gone
