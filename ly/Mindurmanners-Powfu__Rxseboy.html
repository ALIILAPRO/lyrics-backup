		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mind your manners
We be sipping Kool-Aid Jammers
And after we go turn the party a disaster, imagine
All these girls up on me, no reaction, splashin'
Camera, lights, action, mind your manners
We be sipping Kool-Aid Jammers
And after we go turn the party a disaster, imagine
All these girls up on me no reaction, splashin'
Watch me blow up with no captions

[Rxseboy:]
Blowing up my phone screen
She come through, but that's low-key
I'm hot and cold Todoroki
And I move slow with no codeine
They takin' pics, I don't respond
People hatin' me for no reason
Got one life with no respawn
Like Lil Nas I might yee-haw

[Powfu:]
Blow up with no captions
Jumpin' in, I don't care what happens (What happens)
I've got enough, I don't need more practice (More practice)
All the kids tryna cop my fashion (My fashion)

Mind your manners
We be sipping Kool-Aid Jammers
And after we go turn the party a disaster, imagine
All these girls up on me, no reaction, splashin'
Camera, lights, action, mind your manners
We be sipping Kool-Aid Jammers
And after we go turn the party a disaster, imagine
All these girls up on me no reaction, splashin'
Camera, lights, action (Yah, yah)

Ey, blow up with no captions
I've been in my own world, way above the average
Watch me blow up with no captions
Watch me blow up with no-
Yeah, throw it up, I might catch it in the end zone
Finna pop like coke with the mentos
Italiano, mamacita makin' pesto
I'm about to spill the tea, what's a red code

[Powfu with sister:]
Mind your manners
We be sipping Kool-Aid Jammers
And after we go turn the party a disaster, imagine
All these girls up on me, no reaction
Camera, lights, action, mind your manners
