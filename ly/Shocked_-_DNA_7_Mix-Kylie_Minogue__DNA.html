		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell me I'm only dreaming and I'll believe you
Can't see how this could be true
Surrounded by feelings I hardly recognise
I look for explanations I'm taken by surprise
If you told me yesterday that I could feel this way
I would sure enough call you a liar to your face

[Chorus]
Because I'm shocked by the power
(Shocked) ooh
Shocked by the power of love
I was rocked to my very foundations
Shocked by the power, shocked by the power

Maybe this time tomorrow
I'll discover this ain't really real
'cause it struck me like lightning
Like a bolt out of the blue
Emotions inside me, all over you
I'm high above the Universe, losing track of time
And falling free
I can't believe that you are really mine

[Chorus]

Shocked, like the lightning from up above
Down from the heavens and it gave me love
From a man who respects me
Loves my mind as well as my body
No retreat and no surrender
Equal to you regardless of gender
Giving me love that is warm and tender
That's why I gotta tell ya

You and I are of the same mind
It seems to me that we're one of a kind
It's true to say that when love is blind
But then true love is so hard to find
You respect me and the things I do
It was meant to be
I was made for you
Open the door to my heart, it's stopped
And I'm shocked....

[Chorus]

Surrounded by feelings I hardly recognise,
I look for explanations I'm taken by surprise.
'Cause it struck me like lightning,
Like a bolt out of the blue,
Emotions inside me, all over you.

[Chorus until fade]
