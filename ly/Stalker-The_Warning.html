		<p>
		  Look at me, my dear
Look at me, my dear
I love you so 'cause I am yours and you are mine
I'll hold you, my dear
I'll hold you, my dear
I'll tie the rope 'cause I am yours and you are mine

It's crazy how much I love you
It's crazy how much I want you
It's crazy, oh, you don't even know
It's crazy how much I think about you
It's crazy how I can't live without you
It's crazy how my love seems to grow
I'm a maniac when it comes to you
I'm obsessed with what we both could be
The possibilities
It's crazy how I need to have it
It's crazy, it's an ugly habit
Yes or no, whichever
I'll have you someday, I'll have you forever

Look at me, my dear
Look at me, my dear
I love you so, why don't you know that you are mine?
Say I'm yours, my dear
Say I'm yours, my dear
I'll lock the door before you go, say it again

It's crazy how much I love you
It's crazy how much I want you
It's crazy, oh, you don't even know
It's crazy how much I think about you
It's crazy how I can't live without you
It's crazy how my love seems to grow
I'm a maniac when it comes to you
I'm obsessed with what we both could be
The possibilities
It's crazy how I need to have it
It's crazy, it's an ugly habit
Yes or no, whichever
I'll have you someday

Want you to love me, touch me
Let me in your heart
Want you to want me, hunt me
Like I've done from the start
Want you to love me, touch me
Let me in your heart
Want you to want me, hunt me
Like I've done from the start

Look at me, my dear
Look at me, my dear
I love you so 'cause I am yours and you are mine
