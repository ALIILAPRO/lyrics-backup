		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Love me, love me, you wanna leave
You wanna stay but told everyone but me
Hate me, hate me, you waste of space
I wanna know, tell me to my fucking face
Woo!

So let me get this straight, you wanna stay
You wanna go, just like before
And I'm the one that's crazed
I'm in the dark
When you go straight back to hell

Left high and you left me dry
Oh

Love me, love me, you wanna leave
You wanna stay but told everyone but me
Hate me, hate me, you waste of space
I wanna know, tell me to my fucking face

Let me get this straight, you trade me in
Take me apart and laugh it off
And I'm the one that's
Crazed and cracking up
While you go straight back to hell

Left high and you left me dry
Oh

Love me, love me, you wanna leave
You wanna stay but told everyone but me
Hate me, hate me, you waste of space
I wanna know, tell me to my fucking face

La lala lala lala la lala lala la lala
La lala lala lala la lala la lala

The lies that you told, I heard them before
I heard that I want you tenfold times before
You told me you changed
And you've not changed at all
You use and abuse me then come back for more
The lies that you told, I heard them before
I heard that I want you tenfold times before
You told me you changed
And you've not changed at all
You use and abuse me then come back for more
You use and bruise me then come back for more

Love me, love me, you wanna leave
You wanna stay but told everyone but me
Hate me, hate me, you waste of space
I wanna know, tell me to my fucking face
Love me, love me, you wanna leave
You wanna stay but told everyone but me
Hate me, hate me, you waste of space
I wanna know, tell me to my fucking face

La lala lala lala la lala lala la lala
La lala lala lala la lala la lala
