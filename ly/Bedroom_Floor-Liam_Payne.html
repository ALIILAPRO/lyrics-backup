		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby, heard you've been talking about me lately
Telling all your friends how much you hate me
But who you calling up when you get lonely?
When you get lonely, yeah

You be saying real, real nice, real nice things
When I'm touching you
You be getting real, real, real, real, real jealous
When it wasn't you, oh
And every now when my iPhone, iPhone rings
I be telling you
I told you, I told you, I told you

You said it was over
You said it was over
But your clothes say different on my bedroom floor
You said it was over
You said it was over
But your clothes say different on my bedroom floor
But your clothes say different on my bedroom floor
But your clothes say different on my bedroom floor, yeah

Baby, why you always act like you don't want me?
Don't make me bring up your dirty laundry
We always on and off until you're on me
Until you're on me, yeah

You be saying real, real nice, real nice things
When I'm touching you
You be getting real, real, real, real, real jealous
When it wasn't you, oh
And every now when my iPhone, iPhone rings
I be telling you
I told you, I told you, I told you

You said it was over
You said it was over
But your clothes say different on my bedroom floor
You said it was over
You said it was over
But your clothes say different on my bedroom floor
But your clothes say different on my bedroom floor
But your clothes say different on my bedroom floor, yeah
You said it was over, you said it was over
But your clothes say different on my bedroom floor, yeah

Oh, my bedroom floor
Your clothes are saying something different now
You wanna break up just to fix it now
Oh, baby

You said it was over
You said it was over
But your clothes say different on my bedroom floor
You said it was over (it's over)
You said it was over (it's over)
But your clothes say different on my bedroom floor
But your clothes say different on my bedroom floor
But your clothes say different on my bedroom floor, yeah
You said it was over, you said it was over
But your clothes say different on my bedroom floor, yeah
