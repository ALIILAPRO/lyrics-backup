		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I’m glad you found me
been living in my thoughts
that shit is dangerous

Took all I know
And all I know 
Put change in us

Took many souls 
Seen many go 
Never gave them one
Never gave one

I’m glad you found me
Been living in my thoughts
That shit is dangerous

Took all I know
And all I know 
put change in us

Took many souls 
seen many go 
never gave them one
Never gave one

It’s ok, I'm okay
It’s ok, I'm okay
It’s ok, I'm okay
It’s ok, I'm okay

Bite my lip
Ain’t no use in speaking
I don’t want to fight through the mother fucking weekend
It’s a bitchy season, you been looking decent
I went undersea and Caught you by the deep end

Bite my lip
Ain’t no use in speaking
I don’t want to fight through the mother fucking weekend
It’s a bitchy season, you been looking decent
I went undersea and Caught you by the deep end

It’s ok, I'm okay
It’s ok, I'm okay
It’s ok, I'm okay
It’s ok, I'm okay
