		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mm Mm Mm Mm Mm
Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah

In moment of piece
Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah
Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah

[Chorus:]
Come now, come by our side
A place where you can hide
We are the sunshine
Rest your soul here 
And you'll find 
We are the energy
We give the world to thee
Hold up your heart now 
We will ease pain from your brow

(Sarah Brightman)
When the world is in tatters
And destruction is near
You can come with us here

When the people are strangers
You'll rest here with me 
In a moment of peace

(Repeat Sarah once)

[Chorus]

Light up the dark below, 
See through the stars, 
Reach to the earth's flow
Drift in the joy of our hearts, 
Unleash the energy, 
Taste of the wine
Drink as a soul 
That knows now, power divine

(Repeat Sarah Twice)
In a moment of peace
