		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Counting down these seconds
Jumping up these fences
Finding other places to start again
The cracks in the sidewalk
I'm over of the small talk
Setting off like fire in the wind

I won't waste another day
Wishing this would fade away
Running but not looking back

I want a little bit of California
With a little bit of London sky
I wanna take my heart to the end of the world
And fly away tonight
I want a little bit of open ocean
With a New York state of mind
I wanna take my heart to the end of the world
And fly away, fly away tonight
Fly away tonight
Fly away tonight

A never ending replay
With memories I can't erase
I see the best in times of sudden peace
Now I'm after paradise
It's your world I'll never find
Say goodbye to pain and misery
Na na na na na na na

I won't waste another day
Wishing this would fade away
Running but not looking back

I want a little bit of California
With a little bit of London sky
I wanna take my heart to the end of the world
And fly away tonight
I want a little bit of open ocean
With a New York state of mind
I wanna take my heart to the end of the world
And fly away, fly away tonight

I won't waste another day
Wishing this would fade away

I won't waste another day
Wishing this would fade away

Coming down to seconds
Always second guessing
Give me up a place to start again

I want a little bit of California
With a little bit of London sky
I wanna take my heart to the end of the world
And fly away tonight
I want a little bit of open ocean
With a New York state of mind
I wanna take my heart to the end of the world
And fly away, fly away tonight
Fly away tonight
Fly away tonight
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
