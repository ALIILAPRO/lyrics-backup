		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dissolve the fascination
I know the sins reflect
In my imagination
Nature I've convinced to care
I don't want to wait in purgatory
Televised evacuation airs
On the other side of every camera
This side won't be shared

Thy fear will eat you dead
Leora
Our eyes are all projection
Together

I need a little less feel
To keep it on this station
Without a wire, how could I take my place inside?
I need a little seething
All you see is make believe (all you see is make believe)
Without a wire, how could I make my way out there?

All aboard and ready to detach

Thy fear will eat you dead
Leora
Our eyes are all projection
Together
Our hate fuels everything
Pulled apart the wave to take defense
Shotgun fire's sheets of madness
Leora

It doesn't feel like it's the same thing
Why don't you wither in your head?
It doesn't feel like it's the same thing
Why don't you wither in your head?
It doesn't feel like it's the same thing
Why don't you wither in your head?
It doesn't feel like it's the same thing
Why don't you wither in your head?

Thy fear will eat you dead
Leora
Our eyes are all projection
Together
Our hate fuels everything
Pulled apart the wave to take defense
Shotgun fire's sheets of madness
Leora

To be a winner, to be undead
It's sanctified (thy fear will eat you dead)
To beat the winter, to beat a man (our eyes are all projection)
It's razor thin
