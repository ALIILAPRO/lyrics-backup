		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh, baby, mmm, when you hold me, mmm
Mmm, mmm, when you hold me
The sound

Is it possible I could feel this cool?
I could really love you the way I do
Is it possible I could feel this good?
I could really love you the way I do

See me (within the light)
Flowing (take me to you)
Like the river to the sea
You come down (I'm in the light)
You cover (pull me to you)
And the waves rush over me

I feel a love light rush over me
I feel the love turn to me
And then your love just creeps over me
Over me

See me (within the light)
Flowing (take me to you)
Like the river to the sea
You come down (I'm in the light)
You cover (pull me to you)

And the waves rush over me

Ooh baby, mmm
When you hold me
Mmm, mmm, when you hold me
The sound

And I won't let you go
I won't let you go
And I won't let you go
I won't let you go

Take up your love
Take up your love
Take up your love
And come to me
This love's not a liar
It's a cold, it's a fire
I'm on the run
And it's a comfort to me (I won't let you go)

Take up your love
Take up your love
Take up your love
And come to me
This love's not a liar
It's a cold, it's a fire
I'm on the run
And it's a comfort to me

And I won't let you go
I won't let you go
And I won't let you go
I won't let you go
