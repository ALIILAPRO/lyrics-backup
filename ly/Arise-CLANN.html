		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How do you look so fair and bright? 
Under the cloak of sorrow 
Look at these wings 
You're made for flight 
Cut down before you could know 
What do you fear? 
Don't hide away 
Break from these chains 
Rise and take aim 
You need not wander 
In these halls of solitude 
In darkest hour 
Remember 
I'll answer 
Oh 
What kind of fate 
Befalls us? 
Stay with me 
Do you see? 
The tides move for us 
Oh 
Nothing's to late 
To heal you 
Here's the key 
To be free 
Forgive 
I saw you dance 
Upon the hills 
Wave your hands and sing 
But slowly as your spirit grew In silence you withdrew 
Shed no more tears 
So fair and bright 
Now's time to fight 
Rise to the light
You need not lament 
For lost innocence 
The child's still within 
Just waiting to wake 
It's not over 
Not over 
Oh 
What kind of fate 
Befalls us? 
Stay with me 
Do you see? 
The tides move for us 
Oh 
Nothing's to late 
To heal you 
Here's the key 
To be free 
Forgive 
Off the deep end 
You've fallen 
Arise 
Arise 
Again 
Thrown to pieces 
Cast to the wind 
From ashes we 
Ascend 
Harken to me 
Hang on 
This life's your own 
I'm right here beside you You're not alone 
In darkness we shine 
Now place your hand in mine Arise 
Arise 
Arise
