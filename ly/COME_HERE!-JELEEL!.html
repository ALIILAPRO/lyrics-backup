		<p>
		  Droptop, cops furious
Drive now, fast, furious
I'm curious, girl, come here
Girl, come here 
JELEEL!, yeah 

Droptop, cops furious
Drive now, fast, furious
I'm curious, girl, come here
Girl, come here, girl, come here

Tiffany, uh, Kimberly, uh
Callin' me, sayin' they missin' me
Feelin' like Buzz, infinity girls
I just be knowin' they feelin' me
Pass me the rock, hit a three
Shootin' my shot, Kennedy
When I wake up, Himothy
When he wake up, Timothy
I'm in the cut, she wanna fuck
We in the backseat in the truck
Throwin' a rack, blowin' a dub
We in the VIP in the club
Wearin' my shirt, she fell in love
Lovin' the skin, she usin' Dove
I'm in the Grammys, givin' them hugs
I love my granny, give her a hug

Wait 
You are now tuned in to REAL RAW!

Droptop, cops furious
Drive now, fast, furious
I'm curious, girl, come here
Girl, come here, girl, come here
Droptop, cops furious
Drive now, fast, furious
I'm curious, girl, come here
Girl, come here, girl, come here
