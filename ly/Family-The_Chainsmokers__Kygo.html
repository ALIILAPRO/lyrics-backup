		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (My family)

I know water that's thicker than love
That's deeper than love with my friends
People come and some people go, and
Some people ride 'til the end

When I am blind in my mind
I swear they be my rescue, my lifeline
I don't know what I'd do if I, if I'd survive
My brothers and my sisters, in my life
Yeah

I know some people, they would die for me
We run together, they're my family
When I get up, they gon' be high with me
I'll say forever my family

My family
I'll say forever my family
My family
I'll say forever my family

Stolen dreams took our, our childish days
Still ain't nothin' changed, now we're grown
We're still young, still got our mindless ways
And our timeless phase, kickin' songs

When I am blind in my mind
I swear they be my rescue, my lifeline
I don't know what I'd do if I, if I'd survive
My brothers and my sisters, in my life
Yeah

I know some people, they would die for me (die for me)
We run together, they're my family
When I get up, they gon' be high with me (gon' be high with me, yeah)
I'll say forever my family

Family (yeah)
I'll say forever my family
My family
I'll say forever my family

I know some people, they would die for me (die for me)
We run together, they're my family
When I get up, they gon' be high with me (gon' be high with me, yeah)
I'll say forever my family
