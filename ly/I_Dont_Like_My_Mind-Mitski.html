		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't like my mind
I don't like being left alone in a room
With all its opinions about the things that I've done
So, yeah, I blast music loud
And I work myself to the bone
And on an inconvenient Christmas, I eat a cake

A whole cake, all for me, ooh, oh

And then I get sick and throw up 
And there's another memory that gets stuck
Inside the walls of my skull, waiting for its turn to talk
And it may be a few years
But you can bet it's there, waiting still
For me to be left alone in a room with the things that I've done

A whole cake, so please don't take
Take this job from me
A whole cake, so please don't take
Take my job from me
