		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Stationed in bx babe
Don't text me too late babe
I like to get my sleep
Cuz, that's when the moneys made
I got this real for you baby
Got this real for you baby
Got this real for you, got
This real for you
I got this real for you baby
Got this real for you baby
Got this real for you, got this real for you
Stationed in bx you seen me babe
Still ballin' I'm out here you know it babe
Come through I know you wanna blow it babe
Is you vibin', is you vibin', is you vibin'
Is you slidin', is you slidin', is you slidin'
I got this real for you baby
Got this real for you baby
Got this real for you, got
This real for you
I got this real for you baby
Got this real for you baby
Got this real for you, got this real for you
Stationed in bx and you know it babe
On my way to the money you know babe
If it's tequila you want then just say babe
Girl are you with it Are you with or you not
Know I've been distant
Cuz, I've been working overtime
Why you trippin'
You just need to take a shot
I been chasin' those lil' signs
I just need you to reply
That's my lil shawty in bx
Say that shit better in b x
She don't fuck around with the bx
She just wanna turn up in Atlanta
Cuz I got some better
I got this real for you baby
Got this real for you baby
Got this real for you, got
This real for you
I got this real for you baby
Got this real for you baby
Got this real for you, got this real for you
