		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You stole my numbers, you stole my codes
You took my keys and then you nicked my phone
Seduced my landlord, broke in my home
Don't get excited, why don't you leave me alone?

You think I'll mess it up, mess it up, mess it up all for you
You think I'll mess it up, mess it up, mess it up all for you
You think I'm really, really, really gonna really make your dreams come true
Yeah, you say you really, really, really, really wanna hear the truth, oh

You shared my photos with all your friends
Yeah, you put them out there, well, it don't make no sense
Oh, I said I'm sorry, mmm, I know it ended bad
You came to the right place, baby, at the wrong time, it's kinda sad

You think I'll mess it up, mess it up, mess it up all for you (all for you, yeah)
You think I'll mess it up, mess it up, mess it up all for you
You think I'll dress it up, dress it up, dress it up all for you (all for you)
You say you really, really, really, really wanna hear the truth, yeah, yeah
You say you really, really, really, really wanna hear the truth, yeah, come on

Really wanna hear it (really wanna hear it)
Really wanna hear it, baby
Really wanna hear it
Really wanna hear it, really wanna hear it, babe, yeah

You asked the question, and I won't lie

Ain't gonna mess it up, mess it up, mess it up all for you
Ain't gonna mess it up, mess it up, really make your dreams come true
Ain't gonna wreck it up, wreck it up, wreck it up all for you, oh, Lord
You say you really, really, really, really wanna hear the truth, oh, oh, oh

Yeah, yeah, really wanna hear it, baby, yeah
Really wanna hear the truth now, really wanna hear the truth now
Wanna be honest, wanna be, wanna be honest
Honest with you, baby
