		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A coward dies a thousand deaths
A soldier dies but once
(Tonight's the night I get in some shit)

They say pussy and paper is poetry, power and pistols
Plotting on murdering motherfuckers 'fore they get you
Picturing pitiful punk niggas copping pleas
Puffin' weed as I position myself to clock G's
My enemies scatter in suicidal situations
Never to witness the wicked shit that they was facing
Pockets is packed with presidents, pursue your riches
Evading the player-hating tricks, while hitting switches
Bitches is bad-mouth, 'cause brawling motherfuckers is bold
But charge them hoes, the game should be sold
I'm sick of psychotic society, somebody save me
Addicted to drama, so even mama couldn't raise me
Even the preacher and all my teachers couldn't reach me
I run in the streets and puffin' weed wit' my peeps
I'm ducking the cops, I hit the weed as I'm clutching my Glock
Niggas is hot when I hit the block, what if I die tonight?

If I die tonight
If I die tonight
Fuck it, if I die tonight
(Tonight's the night I get in some shit)

Polish your pistols, prepare for battle, pass the pump
When I get to poppin', niggas is droppin' then they done
Calling the coroner come collect the fucking corpse
He got hit by killer, preoccupied with being boss
Revenge is the method, whenever steppin', keep a weapon close
Adversaries are overdosed over deadly notes
Jealous niggas and broke bitches equal packed jails
Hit the block and fill your pockets making crack sales
Picture perfection pursuing paper with a passion
Visions of prisons for all the pussies that I blasted
Running with criminals, individuals with no remorse
Try to stop me, my pistol posse using deadly force
In my brain all I can think about is fame
The police know my name, a different game, ain't a thing changed
I'm seeing cemetery photos of my peers
Conversatin' like they still here, if I die tonight

If I die tonight
Scared to die, nigga, is ya, huh?
If I die tonight
Never fear, never worry
If I die tonight
(Tonight's the night I get in some shit)

Pussy and paper is poetry, power and pistols
Plotting on murdering motherfuckers 'fore they get you
Pray to the heavens, .357's to the sky
And I hope I'm forgiven for thug living when I die
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto for thug niggas
A stress-free life and a spot for drug dealers
Pissing while practicing how to pimp and be a player
Overdose of a dick, while drinking liquor when I lay her
Pistol whipping these simps, for being petrified and lame
Disrespecting the game, praying for punishment and pain
Going insane, never die, live eternal, who shall I fear?
Don't shed a tear for me, nigga, I ain't happy here
I hope they bury me and send me to my rest
Headlines reading, "Murdered to death", my last breath
Take a look, picture a crook on his last stand
Motherfuckers don't understand, if I die tonight

Nigga, if I die tonight
No fear, nigga, never worry
If I die tonight
Bury me a motherfuckin' G, closed casket, fuck it
If I die tonight
You know
(Tonight's the night I get in some shit)

Kill, kill, kill, murder, murder, murder
Kill, kill, kill, murder, murder, murder
Kill, kill, kill, murder, murder, murder
(Tonight's the night I get in some shit)
Kill, kill, kill, murder, murder, murder
Kill, kill, kill, murder, murder, murder
