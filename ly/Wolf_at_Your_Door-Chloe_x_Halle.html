		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A wolf creeps softly in the snow
Light and tears along a path ('long a path)
A knife between her teeth, she roams
For she is now the stranger

Chasin' a fairytale
Chasin' a lie
But everything changes
And everything dies
You preyed on my innocence
Tried to bury my name
But now there's ice in my veins, oh

There's a wolf at your door
There's a hound at your heels
There's a snake in your bed
Tell me, how does it feel?

When you let the wolves in
You let the wolves in
When you're laying in your bed at night
When the air's just a little too quiet
Better hope that you're saying your prayers
When you think that it's over, I swear
We'll be there

Up from the ashes
Run through the fire
Down by the blade that bled us the same and the blood won't dry
The monsters that made us
They wrote down your names
One by one, I'm gonna dig your grave

There's a wolf at your door (there's a wolf at your door)
There's a hound at your heels (there's a hound at your heels)
There's a snake in your bed (there's a snake in your bed)
Tell me, how does it feel? (Tell me, how does it feel?)

When you let the wolves in
You let the wolves in
When you're laying in your bed at night
When the air's just a little too quiet
Better hope that you're saying your prayers
When you think that it's over, I swear
We'll be there

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah

There's a wolf at your door (there's a wolf at your door)
There's a hound at your heels (there's a hound at your heels)
There's a snake in your bed (there's a snake in your bed)
Tell me, how does it feel? (Tell me, how does it feel?)

When you let the wolves in
You let the wolves in
When you're laying in your bed at night
When the air's just a little too quiet
Better hope that you're saying your prayers
When you think that it's over, I swear
We'll be there
