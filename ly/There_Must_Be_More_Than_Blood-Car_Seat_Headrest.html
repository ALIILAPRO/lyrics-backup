		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I saw, I saw, I saw, I saw, I saw
Saw, I saw, I saw
I saw you, I saw you

On the magazine cover
With your blue-white eyes
Read it from cover to cover
Looking for ya
But these are not my people here
I think you know that
Nervous like a wild dog
Waiting for the attack

I was living in the delta
Wasting most of my time
You know if I could close the blinds right
I could sleep all through the night
But I've seen the tides are rising
Where once there was a shore
I can still remember houses
Stripped to the floor

There must be more than blood that holds us together
There must be more than wind that takes us away
There must be more than tears when they pull back the curtain
Of this much I am certain

When you're down for a while trying to get dried out
You feel the time pass by but you don't look around
When you're out for a while trying to get dried out
You feel the time pass by but you don't look around

You were playing your music but you got drowned out
You go back to the old house but you've been locked out
And it wasn't for love that you went back home
It was the guilt in your throat like you swallowed a bone

They had all of your life to get it right
They had all of that time just to change their minds
And you're grateful for the bus
It's a place to sit down

Like a spider in the winter trying not to be found
No use trying to heal when you're getting stepped on
No use selling your soul when you're getting passed on
How could they treat you like a forgotten card?

Dear dad, I'm sorry
Thank you very much
What difference does it make when they throw you away?
Is anybody gonna ever hear what you had to say?

I was flying on a redeye
My hand dropped to the aisle
I could see myself clearly for the first time in a while
There was nothing but lines
Nothing but outlines
My gut sank like a stone
But I heard another voice say, "We all walk alone"

There must be more than blood that holds us together
There must be more than wind that takes us away
There must be more than tears when they pull back the curtain
There must be more than fear
Oh, there must be more than blood that holds us together
There must be more than wind that takes us away
There must be more than tears when they pull back the curtain
There must be more than fear (there must be more)

There must be more, there must be more, there must be
There must be more, there must be more, there must be
There must be more, there must be more, there must be
