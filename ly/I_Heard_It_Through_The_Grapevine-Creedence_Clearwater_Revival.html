		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh, bet you're wonderin' how I knew
'Bout your plan to make me blue
With some other guy that you knew before
Between the two of us guys
You know I loved you more
It took me by surprise, I must say
When I found out yesterday

Ooh-ooh, I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Ooh-ooh, I heard it through the grapevine
And I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey, yeah

You know that a man ain't supposed to cry
But these tears, I can't hold inside
Losin' you would end my life, you see
'Cause you mean that much to me
You could have told me yourself
That you found someone else, instead

I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Ooh-ooh, I heard it through the grapevine
And I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey, yeah

People say, "You hear from what you see
Not, not, not from what you hear"
I can't help but being confused
If it's true, won't you tell me, dear?
Do you plan to let me go
For the other guy that you knew before?

Ooh-ooh, I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Ooh-ooh, I heard it through the grapevine
And I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey, yeah

Ooh-ooh, I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Ooh-ooh, I heard it through the grapevine
And I'm just about to lose my mind
Ooh-ooh, I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Ooh-ooh, I heard it through the grapevine
And I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey, yeah
