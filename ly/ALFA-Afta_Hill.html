		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No, the story starts from here

hundreds of miles away oh
I could take you there no no
Close your eyes and don’t be too surprised when we’re there
Oh she love it when I play with her hair
I love it when she plays with my heart
Finger prints left on my arteries

If you come with me baby weed rolling
Shift it down, hit corners and lean on it
And when she grind on me that’s when I ease on it
I press REC and I bleed on it
oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh
I’m smooth like the road I swear I need you with me
oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh
Hit the next exit I know you gonna miss me

Hundreds of miles away oh
I could take you there no no
Close your eyes and don’t be too surprised when we’re there
And oh she love it when I play with her hair
I love it when she plays with my heart (She love that shit)
Finger prints left on my arteries

Pray for pedals at my feet while I’m still in my prime
Hope mamma still recognize me after loosing my mind (crazy)
Hope that you see me the same, I know I threw it away
Said I wasn’t ready baby, yet you love me the same
Sweet-Sweet-Sweeter (Yeah)
قربونت بریم وای جونه دلم
They talking, I swear just let them who gives a fuck?
Sweet-Sweet-Sweeter
میدونم اشخت از قیبته
Talking, I swear just let them who gives a fuck?

Hundreds of miles away oh
I could take you there no no
Close your eyes and don’t be too surprised when we’re there
Oh she love it when I play with her hair
I love it when she plays with my heart
