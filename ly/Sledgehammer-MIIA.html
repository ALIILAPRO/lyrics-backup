		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I hit a wall, I never felt so low, so low
Like a waterfall, my tears
Dropped to the floor, the floor
They left a swimming pool of salted crimes
Crimes
Oh, what could I do to change your mind?
Nothing

I'm bracing for the pain and I am letting go
I'm using all my strength to
Get out of this hole

I hit a wall
I thought that I would hurt myself
Oh, I was sure your words
Would leave me unconscious
And on the floor, I'd be lying cold, lifeless
But I hit a wall, I hit 'em all
Watch the fall you're just another brick and
I'm the sledgehammer
You're just another brick and
I'm a sledgehammer

Yeah, I hit a wall
I prayed that I would make it through
Make it through i can survive a life that's
Without you, without you, yeah
And I will rise up from the ashes now
The ashes now
Oh, the sparrow flies with just
The crumbs of loving spilled, yeah

I was bracing for the pain and
Then I let it go
I gathered all my strength and
I found myself whole

I hit a wall
I thought that I would hurt myself
Oh, I was sure your words
Would leave me unconscious
And on the floor, I'd be lying cold, lifeless
But I hit a wall, I hit 'em all
Watch the fall you're just another brick and
I'm the sledgehammer
You're just another brick and
I'm a sledgehammer
