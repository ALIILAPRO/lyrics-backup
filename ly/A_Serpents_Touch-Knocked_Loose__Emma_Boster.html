		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I was different maybe I'd forgive you
But I'm not so my feelings stay the same
I hope you noticed that I tried to keep up
Every time that you decided to change

I bleed out
All you ever did was tear me down
I bleed out
I hope you notice that I'm not around
I bleed out

The time I spent
Cannot be repaid
I was by your side
(Empty my remains)
Extinguish all connection
Cut the fucking cord
I am by your side
No more

Now be still
I'm the judge
Poisoned by
A serpent's touch

This burden weighs heavy
On shoulders littered with dejection

I watched the venom
Overcome your spirit
Jealousy holds you now
Distorting your appearance
Bleed out

I watched the venom overcome
Poisoned by a serpent's touch
