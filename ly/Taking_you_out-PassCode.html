		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Da! 
Speed of times are messing with our minds 
Rise up, up! Push! Push! Push! 
Boost! Acceleration! Drive! 

No! Ca-ca-ca-ca-ca-ca-crash!

Wrong, don't wanna see no bad sign 
My bones feel horrified 
I know that it's your life 
But what you're doing is not right 

They bring you the news on your TV screen, same as always 
Talking of who had an affair with who today 
And who's killing who again 

Don't wanna hear this evil and I don't want to see 
But none of it is fantasy 夢じゃない 

Taking you out! From this misery now 
孤独の種 奪い取って hide again 
And in this broken place 

Give love! (Give love!) Feel love! (Feel love!) Save you! (Save you!) 
愛されたいと叫んで 聞こえるから 

Just set this free, pain's ending once again 
A better sky, we're still drifting with lights out 
This may look like no hope, just open your eyes 
It's always bright outside 

Go slow 

Now, hear them cry! 
Somebody's yell, pay attention! 
Listen, listen, listen, listen, listen 

必要な自信がなくて 幸せを比べてる 
基準は誰のものなのだろう 思い出すには 
There is time, there is time, there is time 

So try to see it right 
形の中 don't believe you're speeding, here on your own 

We have all crashed into one, two big walls in the path of life 
Go flying over the top, top, top, top, top, top, oh! 

Taking you out! From this misery now 
孤独の種 奪い取って hide again 
And in this broken place 

Give love! (Give love!) Feel love! (Feel love!) Save you! (Save you!) 
愛されたいと叫んで 聞こえるから 

Just set this free, pain's ending once again 
A better sky 鮮やかな この世界なら
