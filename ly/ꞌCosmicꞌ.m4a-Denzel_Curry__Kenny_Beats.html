		  (Woah, Kenny)

Drip-hop, born from the crack pot
This is for the infants, the haves and the have-nots
Meet inside the trap spot so you can be a astronaut
This will be the biggest leap that you ever hop
It seems niggas are fly and the junkies are high
And in my line of work that goes side by side
But when the worlds collide they waste a whole damn product
Here's the adrenaline when the block get shot up
Take it to the vein, matter fact, take gunshot to the the brain
One dose or a two-dose Novocaine
Red dot to a nigga eye like Kayn
No, it's just another place you can't go
Barricade, disengage, reengage
Now I leave a gauge-size hole
Nigga play your road, put it in your back pocket
Before they drop sheets, I'ma drop knowledge

Stop it, now you gotta answer to the cosmic
Whatever they rock with is something non-toxic
Chop it, mix the green juice with the CrossFit
Better get my weight up, you other niggas lost it

Drip-hop, born on the D-block
My only golden purpose is to come and make the streets hot
The free spot, when I dine at a Greek spot
The geeks pot in a time with a freak thought
A geek's thoughts, that's a square mentality
He shootin' VR, we got guns in reality
You act so hard, you should thank the Academy
It comes full circle, but it isn't fatality
My room, who the fuck is steppin' to my crew?
I'm like "Move", niggas don't know about spit, I raise roofs
Niggas wanna copy, but they still uncool
This is my throne, my chair, my stool

Stop it, now you gotta answer to the cosmic
Whatever they rock with is something non-toxic
Chop it, mix the green juice with the CrossFit
Better get my weight up, you other niggas lost it

Stop it, now you gotta answer to cosmic
Non-toxic, ch-chop it
(Cosmic dust activity)

(Well, who's gonna stop me? You?)
(Any unusual experiment can produce unusual results)
(That's why I choose the silent, it's isolated)
(Miles of open water in any direction)
(We did everything in the world to exterminate them)
(But, no apparent luck)
