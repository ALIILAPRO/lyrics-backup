		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, huh-huh (hm-hm)

Lost in love (lost in love)
And you kissin' me, honey (kissin' me)
And we sex a lot (sex a lot)
You got me melting alive (mmh)
Where our love will meet (love will meet)
Oh, can I set the vibes?
You mean so much, my baby
Say you want all of mine, nah-nah, ohh

She lives free in my mind, ooh (yeah)
She's my sunset sublime, ooh (yeah)
Dangerous
Look at us, we're magnetic, ooh
Say you want (yeah)
To be the lead in my story, word

If you need somewhere to fly (ohh)
Soarin' across the ocean for me
You'll, baby, be my person
You'll free me, me, me, me
Ma-ma, ma-ma-ma, yeah, hm

I called you here when I flew back
Ooh, babe, you got me turnin'
It's the way I look when you move it
Ooh, babe, you got me turnin'

Too many hours, too many days
I might come around anyway
How you know when I'm in town and you ain't hit me, babe?
How you know when I'm in town and you ain't hit me, babe?

Whatever you're needing now, you need to have enough
You know what I see, lil' babe, I see you giving up
So don't you give in, fight until you win
Knowing I'm all in, all in

If you need somewhere to fly (ohh)
Soarin' across the ocean for me
You'll, baby, be my person
You'll free me, me, me, me
Ma-ma, ma-ma-ma, yeah, hm
