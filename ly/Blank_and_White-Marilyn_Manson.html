		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  As we need a 'Why'
And I'll the 'Who' for an
Apocalypse 'how'
If the world had one neck, my hands would be the 'where'
And I would choke all of you down
I would choke all of you down
I would choke all of you down

Give me a picket sign
And make it blank and white
Like all those stupid teenage girls
We are gonna to need them were we're going tonight

All you fuckers vote beep beep beep
In drunk karaoke cars
If it's too dumb to see, or say, you still sing it
I'll just cue the applause

Lets make sure the music is loud enough we won't even hear it end
Lets make sure the music is loud enough we won't even hear it end

Give me a picket sign
And make it blank and white
Like all those stupid teenage girls
We are gonna to need them were we're going tonight

I want to celebrate
I want to sell your hate
Today's the day you're gonna fucking die
I want to celebrate
I want to sell your hate
Your demons want to give you a proper goodbye

All you fuckers vote beep beep beep
In drunk karaoke cars
If it's too dumb to see, or say, you still sing it
I'll just cue the applause

Give me a picket sign
And make it blank and white
Like all those stupid teenage girls
We are gonna to need them were we're going tonight

I want to celebrate
I want to sell your hate
Today's the day you're gonna fucking die
I want to celebrate
I want to sell your hate
Your demons want to give you a proper goodbye

I want to celebrate
I want to sell your hate
Today's the day you're gonna fucking die
I want to celebrate
I want to sell your hate
Your demons want to give you a proper goodbye

Give me a picket sign
And make it blank and white
Like all those stupid teenage girls
We are gonna to need them were we're going tonight

Yeah [Repeat: x16]
