		  From a dead man
Greetings

There's not much left to love
Too tired today to hate
I feel the empty
I feel the minute of decay

I'm on my way down now, I'd like to take you with me
I'm on my way down
I'm on my way down now, I'd like to take you with me
I'm on my way down

The minute that it's born
It begins to die
I'd love to just give in
I'd love to live this lie

I've been to black and back
I've whited out my name
A lack of pain, a lack of hope
A lack of anything to say

I'm on my way down now, I'd like to take you with me
I'm on my way down
I'm on my way down

The minute that it's born
It begins to die
I'd love to just give in
I'd love to live this lie
I'd love to live this lie

How do you see it?
How do you know?
How do you see it?
I looked ahead and everything was dead
How do you know?
I guess that I am, too
How do you see it?
I looked ahead and everything was dead
How do you know?
I guess that I am
I guess that I am, too

The minute that it's born
It begins to die
I'd love to just give in
I'd love to live this lie
I'd love to live this lie

I'm on my way down now, I'd like to take you with me
I'm on my way down
I'm on my way down now, I'd like to take you with me
I'm on my way down
