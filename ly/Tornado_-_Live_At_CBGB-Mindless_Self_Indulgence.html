		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I sneak up and hit you like a fuckin' tornado 
You ain't no operator, so who the fuck are you then 
I sneak up and hit you like a fuckin' tornado 
If you don't hit those faders I won't ever stop 
I sneak up and hit you like a fuckin' tornado 
With a to the and a with a 
I sneak up and hit you like a fuckin' tornado 
You ain't no operator 
You ain't no operator 
I want to be 
Want to be 
Want to be 
Want to be 
Want to be 
Want to be 
Pretty 
Down, get down, gettin' down with my bad self 
Get down, get down, gettin' down with my bad self 
I sneak up and hit you like a fuckin' tornado 
I sneak up and hit you like a fuckin' tornado 
You stupid man, you try to get information 
For what, for why, for this is not a resident 
No, this is mine nigga, this is mine 
I sneak up and hit you like a fuckin' tornado 
I sneak up and hit you like a fuckin' tornado 
I want to be 
Want to be 
Want to be 
Want to be 
Want to be 
Want to be 
Pretty 
Down, get down, gettin' down with my bad self 
Get down, get down, gettin' down with my bad self 
Get down 
Rock this joint nigga 
Rock this joint nigga 
Rock this joint nigga 
In an old school way 
Rock this joint nigga 
Rock this joint nigga 
Rock this joint nigga 
In an old school way
