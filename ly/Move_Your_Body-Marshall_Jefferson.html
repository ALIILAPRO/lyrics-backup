		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Gotta have House, music, all night long
With that House, music, you can't go wrong
Give me that House, music, set me free
Lost in House, music, is where I wanna be
It's gonna set you free (rock your body)
It's gonna set you free (rock your body)
It's gonna set you free (rock your body)
It's gonna set you free (rock your body)
It's gonna set you free (rock your body)
It's gonna set you free (rock your body)
It's gonna set you free
It's gonna set you free (rock your body)

Move your body (rock your body)

Move your body (rock your body)
Shake your body (rock your body)
Move your body (rock your body)
Move your body (rock your body)
Shake your body (rock your body)
Move your body (rock your body)
Shake your body (rock your body)
(Move your body)

Move your body, sexy body 
Move your body, sexy body
(Move your body)
It's gonna set you free (move your body)
It's gonna set you free (move your body)
It's gonna set you free (move your body)

Move your body (move your body)
Shake your body (move your body)
Sexy body (move your body, move your body)
Move your body, sexy body
Shake your body, sexy body

It's gonna set you free
It's gonna set you free
(Rock your body) 
It's gonna set you free (rock your body)
It's gonna set you free (rock your body)

Music's gonna set you free
It's gonna set you free

Music's gonna set you free (rock your body)
It's gonna set you free
(Rock your body)
(Move your body)
(Rock your body)

It's gonna set you free
(Rock your body)
This House music (rock your body)
(Rock your body) it's gonna set you free
(Rock your body)
(Move your body)

(Rock your body)
Sexy body
(Rock your body)
(Move your body)
(Rock your body)

(Rock your body)
(Move your body)
(Move your body)
(Move your body)
(Move your body)
Give me that House music (move your body)
Set me free (move your body)
Open House music
It's gonna set me free 
(Rock your body)
(Move your body)
