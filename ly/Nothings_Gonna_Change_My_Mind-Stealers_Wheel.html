		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Egan)

It's a dead-end job and the money is low,
And the time goes by so slow.
If I stay too long it could bring me down,
So I might as well take another look around.
You say it's a fool that keeps moving on,
Well, maybe you're right, maybe you're wrong.
You can keep on talking 'til the end of time,
But nothing's gonna make me change my mind.

I pick up my money when the day is done,
I'm moving on, and I've got a good reason.
I hear you moan, but you've only got yourself to blame,
If I stayed in one position I would feel the same.
So I'll just keep travelling on,
I'd rather go on living like a rolling stone.
You can keep on talking 'til the end of time,
But nothing's gonna make me change my mind.
