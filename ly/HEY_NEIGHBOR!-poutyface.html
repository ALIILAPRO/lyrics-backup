		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey, you fuckin' suck, I hate you
Hey, you fuckin' suck, I hate you
Hey, you fuckin' suck, I hate you
Hey, you fuckin' suck, I hate you

You slam the door and shake the lock
You're so damn passive-aggressive, man, what the fuck?
I wave at you, you're acting cold
Wait, aren't you twenty-something?
Not even old to be such a
I'm not tryna pick a fight, just wanted to be polite
Got a feeling that you might not like me
But you got a weird vibe, giving me the side-eye
Do you really want a piece of this? Bite me

Kinda sus
Open your window just enough
So you don't have to see my face so much
And if you hate me, I don't care, I'm not going anywhere

Hey, neighbor, is my music too loud?
Hey, neighbor, you need me to turn it down?
Hey, neighbor, I don't know what you're talking about
Hey, neighbor, neighbor, neighbor, neighbor, neighbor
Hey, neighbor, is my music too loud?
Hey, neighbor, you need me to turn it down?
Hey, neighbor, I don't know what you're talking about
Hey, neighbor, neighbor, neighbor, neighbor, neighbor

I think you need to get laid, pronto
Why don't you go far away, Toronto
That would be Thanksgiving day, hey Squanto
Oh, you got nothing to say? Huh, thought so

Kinda wack
I say, "Hi", you don't say it back
Tell me, what did I do to make you mad
And if you hate me, I don't care, I'm not going anywhere

Hey, neighbor, is my music too loud?
Hey, neighbor, you need me to turn it down?
Hey, neighbor, I don't know what you're talking about
Hey, neighbor, neighbor, neighbor, neighbor, neighbor
Hey, neighbor, is my music too loud?
Hey, neighbor, you need me to turn it down?
Hey, neighbor, I don't know what you're talking about
Hey, neighbor, neighbor, neighbor, neighbor, neighbor

Hey, you fuckin' suck, I hate you
Hey, you fuckin' suck, I hate you
Hey, you fuckin' suck, I hate you
Hey, you fuckin' suck, I hate you
Hey, you fuckin' suck, I hate you
Hey, you fuckin' suck, I hate you
Hey, you fuckin' suck, I hate you
Hey, you fuckin' suck
