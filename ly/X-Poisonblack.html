		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  ""\""(No)Hope!\""  T'was stone on my tongue So how did I expect you to understand Conceit grown too strong True love an excuse to submit to demand Please take my hand and kill the sickness within me I'm sure that you can Not sure that you can  Did death do us part? Well to us now we're truly dead Oh suffer my heart As our funeral still lives in my head Please stay away and leave the sickness within me I'm sure that you'll stay away Dead sure that you'll stay  When you hear this song Know everything's gone And when you hear this song You know you must bear along Or are you playing the part as if your heart's forgotten? Entire Unscarred  What a perfect disaster Absorbing shit from left to right But making love we did master That constant battle our primal fight Please touch again and awake the sickness within me Touch me again dear Come touch me again  When you hear this song Know everything's gone And when you hear this song You know you must bear along Or are you playing the part as if your heart's forgotten? Entire Unscarred  When you hear this song Know everything's gone And when you hear this song You know you must bear along Or are you playing the part as if your heart's forgotten? Entire Unscarred  When you hear this song Know everything's gone so wrong And when you bear this song You know you must sing along Is this not true? From me to you I know you can feel it too""
