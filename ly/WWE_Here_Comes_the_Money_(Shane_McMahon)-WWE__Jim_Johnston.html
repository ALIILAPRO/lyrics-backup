		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here comes the money (here we go, money talks)
Here comes the money
Money, money, money, money
Money, money, money, money, money (dolla dolla, dolla dolla)

Ching ching, bling bling, cut the chatter
You ain't talkin' money, then your talking don't matter
Ching ching, bling bling, pattin' pockets
We take the dolla dolla, can't a damn soul stop it
Shock it (uh)

Here comes the new kid on the block
Hold all your bets, here's where the buck stops
See first of all, I'm steppin' out on my own
'Bout time I elevated to claim my own thrown
Success in my blood, call it home grown
Pores reekin' testosterone
Power and money got me crazy, cocky
No longer need you, papi
I know you're mad because you can't stop me
And if you wonder how this playa done scooped your honey
I think she smelled my cologne, it's called brand new money
Making major moves, man, ain't a damn thing funny
Pimpin' hood rats to playboy bunnies, they see the

Money, money, money, money
Money, money, money, money, money
(They see it, they see it)
Money, money, money, money
Money, money, money, money, money
(Say what? Say what? Say what? Money)

I'm global dolla dolla and roll with 'bout fifty
Like to go out smelling fresh and lookin' spiffy
Don't like clean money, I want my rich to be filthy
Plus with the retirement fund I can't touch 'til I'm sixty?
So what am I supposed to do? Rollin' through
Steady paddin' them pockets, 'till I'm stackin', holdin' too
Ching ching, bling bling, catchin' cash in lumps
It's a cold world, get a jacket, I'm selling 'em out my trunk
Whenever, whatever it takes to shake down a dolla
More dough in that direction, wait a minute, holla, holla
All wants to know, where they go, where they went
In a mink on Monday, smellin' just like a mint

Money, money, money, money
Money, money, money, money, money (uh, money)
Money, money, money, money
Money, money, money, money, money (nanana, nanana)

If you can't see the money
Get your eyes cleaned with Visine
I need fine things, plus seven digits at a time, team
My chil'ren chillin, the best, never worst
See, we never give them pebbles they get the rocks first
Bank vaults on lock'n, ching-ching, we're mockin'
I'm rockin', my family's Christmas stockings are shockin'
Fine women, any weather, naughty denim and leather
Call a chicken whatever, son, they get better
I'm one smart cookie, the vet that smacks rookies
My stocks on top, your checks bounce while mine boogie
Wrists, I must rock it, chicks stop it, I knock it
Cash looks like I got a gang of fists in my pocket

Here comes the money (fists in my, fists in my pocket, fists in my pocket)
Here comes the money
Money, money, money, money
Money, money, money, money, money
