		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lately I found myself on the crowded side of the street
Eating in busy restaurants every night of the week
Strangers don't even know that they're keeping me company, oh

In the middle of a long night
Tell myself I'm alright
'Til I'm numb, so numb
In the darkest place in my mind
Somewhere in that long night
I can't let go, I need to know

Are you with someone else?
I don't think about you
I don't think about you
'Til I'm alone, 'til I'm alone
And thinking about you with someone else
I don't think about you
I don't think about you
'Til I'm alone, 'til I'm alone
And thinking about you with someone else

Some people drive to be alone, but that's not where I am
I find my comfort in the chaos of this traffic jam
I need these people, 'cause they're what's keeping you out my head, oh

In the middle of a long night
Tell myself I'm alright
'Til I'm numb, so numb
In the darkest place in my mind
Somewhere in that long night
I can't let go, I need to know

Are you with someone else?
I don't think about you
I don't think about you
'Til I'm alone, 'til I'm alone
And thinking about you with someone else
I don't think about you
I don't think about you
'Til I'm alone, 'til I'm alone
And thinking about you with someone else

In the middle of a long night
Tell myself I'm alright
'Til I'm numb, so numb
In the darkest place in my mind
Somewhere in that long night
I can't let go, I need to know

Are you with someone else?
I don't think about you
I don't think about you
'Til I'm alone, 'til I'm alone
And thinking about you with someone else
I don't think about you
I don't think about you
'Til I'm alone, 'til I'm alone
And thinking about you with someone else
