		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah no
Yeah
Let me take you to the spotlight
I can take you from this damn life
I can take your pain, pain tonight
Let me take you to the spotlight
I can take you to the spotlight, spotlight
I can get you out of your damn mind, damn mind
I can get you out of this damn life, damn life
Go back to the start where we had it all
Sippin hennessy going through it all
I know you don't want love
Now I know, now I know you've had enough
Heartbroken yeah your strings are sprung
They want you, said they were the one
No
Let me take you to the spotlight
I can take you to the spotlight
I can take away your damn mind
Let me take you to the spotlight, spotlight
I can get you out of your damn mind, damn mind
I can get you out of this damn life, damn life
Go back to the start where we had it all
Sippin hennessy going through it all
You don't need no love
No
You don't need no love
Ye
You just need my heart
Ye ye ye
Guidance purity
You know that the others can't see what you mean to me
I know that your eyes are open
Like the ocean you know we're exploding
Hurricanes are coming in
I don't know where I'm going
Don't try and say
That you love me its a different day
Falling so deep I can't escape
Falling so deep might run away
No
Let me take you to the spotlight
I can take you to the spotlight
I can take away your damn mind
I can take you to the spotlight, spotlight
I can get you out of your damn mind, damn mind
I can get you out of this damn life, damn life
Go back to the start where we had it all
Sippin Hennessy going through it all
