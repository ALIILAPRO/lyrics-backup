		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I used to believe in you
cnd every words you say to me
I used to think that i'm a mess
cnd there's something wrong with me

But turns out you're a fake friend
Hiding in the deep end
Setting up a game
Waiting for a chance to stab

Talk..talk..
Talking shit behind my back
You could say it to my face
But i know you won't

Cut..cut..cut
I need to cut you out!
Cut..cut..cut
I need to cut you out!

You're a toxic
I'm fucking sick of it
Not a friend of me
You're an enemy

Cut..cut..cut
I need to cut you out!
Cut..cut..cut
I need to cut you out!

You say that i'd fall short
But i'm here to proved you wrong
Look around, you're on your own

I can't trust anyone, anymore
No i don't need no more friends
I had enough, i had enough

Now you're choking on your words
Losing all your friends
So tell me how's it feel?

Talking shit behind my back
You could say it to my face
But i know you won't

Cut..cut..cut
I need to cut you out!
Cut..cut..cut
I need to cut you out!

You're a toxic
I'm fucking sick of it
Not a friend of me
You're an enemy

Cut..cut..cut
I need to cut you out!
Cut..cut..cut
I need to cut you out!

Now you're choking on your words
Losing all your friends
You need a taste of your own medicine

Talking shit behind my back
You could say it to my face
But i know you won't

Talking shit behind my back
You could say it to my face
But i know you won't

Cut..cut..cut
I need to cut you out!
Cut..cut..cut
I need to cut you out!

You're a toxic
I'm fucking sick of it+
Not a friend of me 
You're an enemy

Cut..cut..cut
I need to cut you out!
Cut..cut..cut
I need to cut you out!
