		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh yeah, oh yeah

Used to know you, but I don't know you now
Everything's getting so blurry now
Vision hurting, I can't stand the look of you now
Everything's different
Yeah, I heard you're movin' back from out of town
Yeah, I heard you travelin' all these miles and miles
Tryna get back to my love, but it's harder now
Everything's different

Oh, I can't lie, I want you on me
And girl, I wanna love you closely
I don't want nobody on you
If that body ain't me, body ain't me
I lied when I said I hate you
Baby, I was tryna get through
I don't want nobody on you
If that body ain't me, body ain't me, (woo!) yeah

I've been hearin' voices, can't get 'em out
You still playin' cool, but I need you now
Vision clearer, I can see it all better now
Everything's different
Yeah, I know you got a whole lot to figure out
Just know that I'm always here for you girl, no doubt
Before buildin' up, sometimes gotta break it down
Everything's different

Oh, I can't lie, I want you on me
And girl, I wanna love you closely
I don't want nobody on you
If that body ain't me, body ain't me
I lied when I said I hate you
Baby, I was tryna get through
I don't want nobody on you
If that body ain't me, body ain't me, yeah

Do-do-do-do-do-do
Yeah
Oh-oh-oh-oh
