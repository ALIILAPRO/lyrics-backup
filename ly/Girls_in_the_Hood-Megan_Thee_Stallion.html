		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fuck bein' good, I'm a bad bitch (ah)
I'm sick of motherfuckers tryna tell me how to live (fuck y'all)
Wack hoes hate under my pictures on the 'Gram (ugh)
Bitch, you better hope I never run across your man, uh
In the mall with him, I'ma have a ball with him (woah)
Somebody call Rihanna, I'ma buy some drawers with him
He fuckin' with Thee Stallion 'cause he into wild women (he love wild women)
Put them legs on his head, now he love tall women (uh, yeah, ah)
You'll never catch me callin' these niggas daddy (nope)
I ain't lyin' 'bout my nut just to make a nigga happy (nigga, please)
Lifestyle when a nigga can't fit a Magnum
It never happened if the dick wasn't snappin' (ayy)

I'm a hot girl, I do hot shit (I do hot shit)
Spend his income on my outfit (on my outfit)
I don't text quick 'cause I ain't thirsty (I ain't thirsty)
These bitches mad, mad, they wanna hurt me (ah, ah)
I'm a hot girl, I do hot shit (I do hot shit)
Spend his income on my outfit (on my outfit)
I don't text quick 'cause I ain't thirsty (I ain't thirsty)
These bitches mad, mad, they wanna hurt me (ah, ah)

Any rumor 'bout me, let me dead it (let me dead it)
I'm a open book and your man probably read it (ah)
Look at my AP and these hoes still pathetic (mmm)
Real bitches back when I check my Patek, yeah (woah)
Yeah, he call my Patty Cake 'cause the way that ass shake (ass shake)
I'ma make him eat me out while I'm watchin' anime (anime)
Pussy like a Wild Fox, lookin' for a Sasuke (ayy, yeah)
One night with him make him lose it like a prom date (ah)
Two watches, yeah, call me two-timin' (two-timin')
Skin like gold and my teeth like diamonds (like diamonds)
Hot Girl chain, Elliot got me shinin' (yeah)
They tried to knock me off, but a bitch still grindin'

I'm a hot girl, I do hot shit (I do hot shit)
Spend his income on my outfit (on my outfit)
I don't text quick 'cause I ain't thirsty (I ain't thirsty)
These bitches mad, mad, they wanna hurt me (ah, ah)
I'm a hot girl, I do hot shit (I do hot shit)
Spend his income on my outfit (on my outfit)
I don't text quick 'cause I ain't thirsty (I ain't thirsty)
These bitches mad, mad, they wanna hurt me (ah, ah)

I'm a rich nigga magnet (yeah), pretty with a fatty (with a fatty)
Thirty-inch weave with the long eyelashes (long eyelashes)
Yes, I got a man if I don't like who askin' (boy, bye)
I don't stand outside 'cause I'm too outstandin' (ah)
'Cause the girls in the hood are always hard
Ever since sixteen, I been havin' a job
Knowin' nothin' in life, but I gotta get rich
You could check the throwback pics, I been that bitch (ah)

I'm a hot girl, I do hot shit (I do hot shit)
Spend his income on my outfit (on my outfit)
I don't text quick 'cause I ain't thirsty (I ain't thirsty)
These bitches mad, mad, they wanna hurt me (ah, ah)
I'm a hot girl, I do hot shit (I do hot shit)
Spend his income on my outfit (on my outfit)
I don't text quick 'cause I ain't thirsty (I ain't thirsty)
These bitches mad, mad, they wanna hurt me (ah, ah)
