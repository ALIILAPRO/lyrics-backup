		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Wheezy out here) Fresh paper, 800

Ooh-wee, haaa
1400
You know, 1400 shit
Leave that bullshit for the birds
(Big chains on, make new shit) drippin, drippin', haaa

All that bullshit for the birds, ay
You ain't sayin' nothing but a word, ay
Shitty niggas, you some turds, ayy
Hating on a boy 'cause I'm in first place
Yeah, I'm in first place, yeah I'm in first place
Yeah, I'm in first place, said I'm in first place
All that bullshit for the birds, yeah
You ain't sayin' nothing but a word, yeah
Shitty niggas, you some turds, ayy
All these niggas hatin', I'm in first place, place
I'm in first place, you ain't nothin' but a bird (haaa)

Dare a nigga test me
On a island right now on a jet-ski
Baby girl bless me
Just like God, baby bless me
Nigga cannot stress me
'Cause I'm gettin' money with the fucking gang
Diamonds all up on me, VVS the gang

Yeah, VVS the chain
When it rains I'm still happy
Bad foreign little bitch she call me papi
Got some American hoes they call me daddy-y
And if you sleep, wake up, you bitch as fuck
Bad lil' bitch, big butt, we rich as fuck
And if you gettin' buck, them clips is up
And we get to airing it out, and we get to airing it out
All that bullshit is for the birds, let the birds talk
Let the birds talk, pussy nigga let the birds walk (haaa)

You just mad I got the bands over you
Made a million dollars, fuck the fans over you
In the back of the cut, sipping cranberry juice
Yeah, I'm so sauced-up, yeah
Niggas wishing that they caught up
For the reason I was brought up
Because I said I ball, nigga like Vince Carter
Slaughter your daughter, bitch I go harder, like Mr. Carter
On the gang bitch
Nigga fuck you and who the fuck you came with
'Cause all that bullshit you talking for the birds (haaa)

Yeah, VVS the chain
When it rains I'm still happy
That foreign little bitch she call me papi
Got some American hoes they call me daddy-y
And if you sleep, wake up, you bitch as fuck
Bad little bitch, big butt, we rich as fuck
And if you gettin' buck, them clips is up
And we get to airing it out, and we get to airing it out
All that bullshit is for the birds, let the birds talk
Let the birds talk, pussy nigga let the birds walk (haaa)
