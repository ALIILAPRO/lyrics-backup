		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fuck that petty change, bitch, drop me off some cheese
Fuck that petty change, bitch, drop me off some cheese
Down with Orange Mound, puss, dollar and the creepin' home
Down with Orange Mound, puss, dollar and the creepin' home
Its a fuckin' thunder, driveby stash and stuff
Its a fuckin' thunder, driveby stash and stuff
Tonk at the club, funky drop, talkin' 'bout yee
Tonk at the club, funky drop, talkin' 'bout yee

Some niggas be lookin' for the Cheerio, I'm looking for the cheese
Fuck that petty change, bitch, drop me off some cheese
Got to have some M in my dome
Call my niggas, got to make a motherfucker stank
Coke and wine, bricks and sticks
And straight out of South Memphis, mane
Down with Orange Mound, puss, dollar and the creepin' home
Its a fuckin' thunder
Driveby stash and stuff, they shot my phone
Fuck 'round a nigga, I'm catchin' a honkey-tonk at the club
Funky drop, talkin' 'bout "Yee-haw"
Droppin' off yo' ass, punk
Fuck 'round a nigga, I'm catchin' a honkey-tonk at the club
Funky drop, talkin' 'bout "Yee-haw"

Fuck that petty change, bitch, drop me off some cheese
Fuck that petty change, bitch, drop me off some cheese
Down with Orange Mound, puss, dollar and the creepin' home
Down with Orange Mound, puss, dollar and the creepin' home
