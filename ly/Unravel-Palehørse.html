		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Revolution isn't gonna be blood free

Running with the wolves
Praying for the moon (Praying for the moon)
Forgetting to remember all their rules (Hunting)
Hunting for the wise man as well as the fool

Ready to let go of what you have become?
Return into form of your god
Now watch yourself come undone overrun
You began to unravel

Unbecoming for you to see
Through the illusion you try to be
Burn yourself  Curse the fire
Hate yourself  Blame the ire
Revolution isn't gonna be blood free

Hiding with lambs
Washing gory hands (Washing gory hands)
Respecting and obeying all their rules (Serving)
Serving for the wise man as well as the fool

Unbecoming for you to see
Through the illusion you try to be
Burn yourself  Curse the fire
Hate yourself  Blame the ire
Revolution isn't gonna be blood free

Oo ooh, Sky ain't falling down to the ground

Why won't you just remove your 
Skin, flesh, blood & bones 
I bet you can't find your soul, where's your soul?

Oo ooh, Sky is falling, sky is falling down
