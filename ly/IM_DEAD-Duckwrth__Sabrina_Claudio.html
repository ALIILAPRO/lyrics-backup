		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (I'm dead)
(I'm dead)
(And to the status quo, I'm dead)
(And to the bullshit, I'm dead)
Skull emoji nigga, I'm dead

I lone but I never am alone
Run with the wolves, Mobb Deep when I roam
I keep a cool head like a breeze on a stone
But hit me with the beef, I will flip like a phone
So keep the bullshit, let me focus on the wrist
Work while I cook, master chef with a twist
'Cause ain't no other recipe, it's right like this
I don't rock diamonds but I shine so quick
Even in the darkness I bring light to you
I shine for you
And I ain't ever left something right for you
Let's fly out of here, that's what pilots do
That cash money shit big timers do
Skip, skip to my loo
Me, me and my platoon
You don't like the way I mosh, you can shine my shoes
I'm just getting that shit off my head
Skull emoji nigga I'm dead

Oh yeah
They just want to be under the lights
I don't really need that in my life, oh no
What if I just die with you tonight
Let's go 'cause they want you to die

Whatever, whatever, whatever, girl I'm dead
Whatever, whatever, whatever, boy I'm dead
Whatever ever, whatever ever, girl I'm dead
Whatever, whatever, whatever, huh

And I ain't trying to flex for you
I been working all night on the graveshift hype, I'm dead
And I ain't trying to flex for you
Been alone all my life, I ain't worried 'bout the hype, good God
I'm trying to get these checks for you
Trying to make the money flip, two beepers on the hip, aw shit
You know I wish the best for you
But if you ain't tryna move, I find my groove like huh
Who let that funky-ass nigga up in the front door
You kept that hoe locked, kept me out of the store
I kicked in the door, put that bass on the floor like uh
Now you all nervous as virgins that's 'bout to explore
You tap out in 5, I tap in for some more of that head
Skull emoji nigga I'm dead

Oh yeah
They just want to be under the lights
I don't really need that in my life, oh no
What if I just die with you tonight
Let's go 'cause
Skull emoji nigga I'm dead

Whatever, whatever, whatever, girl I'm dead
Whatever, whatever, whatever, boy I'm dead
Whatever ever, whatever ever, girl I'm dead
Whatever, whatever, whatever, huh

Whatever, whatever, whatever, girl I'm dead
Whatever, whatever, whatever, boy I'm dead
Whatever ever, whatever ever, girl I'm dead
Whatever, whatever, whatever, huh
