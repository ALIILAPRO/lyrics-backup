		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Know it gets better
Even in the rain, you gotta keep your head up (yeah)
I let her tell it, she say she fed up (uh-huh)
I'm like, "Whatever", when she mad, the sex better
I put the diamond on your face, Rockfeller (Feller)
I put the need in you and now we here together

You're the only girl for me (you, you, you)
You're the only girl I need, yeah
Ooh-whoa-oh-oh, ooh-ooh-oh
Ooh-whoa-oh-oh, ooh-ooh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh
You're the only girl for me
You're the only girl I need, yeah

(Ooh-whoa, whoa)
If I could be your girl
If I could be your girl

I need to hold my bae, baby
I need to feel your heart, bae, baby
I need you in my arms, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'll give you what you want, yeah, yeah
I told the DJ play my song, yeah, tonight
And that's how me and you get high, so high

You're the only girl for me (you, you, you)
You're the only girl I need, yeah (oh, yeah, yeah)
You're the only girl for me (you, you, you)
You're the only girl I need, yeah (oh, yeah, yeah)

I will take the stars out the sky for you
There's nothin' in this world that I wouldn't do (ooh)
If I could be your girl
If I could be your girl

Ooh-whoa-oh-oh, ooh-ooh-oh
Ooh-whoa-oh-oh, ooh-ooh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh
You're the only girl for me
You're the only girl I need, yeah
Ooh-whoa-oh-oh, ooh-ooh-oh
Ooh-whoa-oh-oh, ooh-ooh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh
You're the only girl for me
You're the only girl I need, yeah

I will take the stars out the sky for you
There's nothin' in this world that I wouldn't do (ooh)
If I could be your girl
If I could be your girl
