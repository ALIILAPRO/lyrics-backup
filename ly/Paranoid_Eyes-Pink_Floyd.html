		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Button your lip 
And don't let the shield slip
Take a fresh grip on your bullet proof mask 
And if they try to break down your disguise with their questions 

You can hide, hide, hide
Behind paranoid eyes

You put on our brave face and slip over the road for a jar
Fixing your grin as you casually lean on the bar
Laughing too loud at the rest of the world 
With the boys in the crowd 

You can hide, hide, hide
"I'll tell you what mates, I'll give you three blacks 
And play you for five"
Behind petrified eyes

"Ta! You was unlucky there son"

You believed in their stories of fame, fortune and glory
Now you're lost in a haze of alcohol soft middle age 
The pie in the sky turned out to be miles too high 
And you hide, hide, hide
"Time gentleman!"
Behind brown and mild eyes
