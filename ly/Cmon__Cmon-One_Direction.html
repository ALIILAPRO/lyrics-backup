		  (C'mon, c'mon)

The one that I came with, she had to go
But you look amazing
Standing alone

So c'mon, c'mon
Move a little closer now
C'mon, c'mon
Ain't way you're walkin' out
C'mon, c'mon
Show me what you're all about

Yeah
I've been watchin' you all night
There's somethin' in your eyes
Say c'mon, c'mon
And dance with me baby
Yeah
The music is so loud
I wanna be yours now
So c'mon, c'mon
And dance with me baby

The one that I came with
Didn't know how to move
The way that you let your hair down
I can tell that you do

So c'mon, c'mon
Move a little closer now
C'mon, c'mon
Ain't way you're walkin' out
C'mon, c'mon
Show me what you're all about

Yeah
I've been watchin' you all night
There's somethin' in your eyes
Say c'mon, c'mon
And dance with me baby

Yeah
The music is so loud
I wanna be yours now
So c'mon, c'mon
And dance with me baby

Every step I take
I'm feelin' more and more
She's callin' out
She's a lucky girl
My heart is racin'
She's turnin' around
I reach for her hand
And I say

Hey
I've been watchin' you all night
There's somethin' in your eyes
Say c'mon, c'mon
And dance with me baby

Yeah
The music is so loud
I wanna be yours now
So c'mon, c'mon
And dance with me baby

Oh, c'mon, c'mon
Oh, c'mon, c'mon
Oh, c'mon, c'mon
And dance with me baby
