		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wise men say
Only fools rush in
And I can't help falling in love with you

I wonder if I'm ever on her mind like she's on mine
Probably not
Swear I've never seen a girl so fine
She probably got tons of guys tryna hit her line
And take her time, I guess I better step in line
She got me shook
Fell in love on the first look, typical
Always catching feelings when the feelings not reciprocal
Love is just so difficult
Builds you up then tears you down
Every time she comes around

I'ma, I'ma, I'ma, I'ma
Fool for her
Acting cool for her
She's too bad for me
But I'm too good for her
She makes me so nervous, probably on purpose
She's just so perfect
I just can't help it

'Cause wise men say only fools rush in
But pretty girls make fools outta wise men
Wise men say only fools rush in
But pretty girls make fools outta wise men, like

Wise men say
Only fools rush in
And I can't help falling in love with you

Yeah, I tend to fall in love with every pretty girl I see practically
But how come they never fall in love with me, I mean gee pardon me
But I'm better than those assholes you talk to
Who claim that they got you, but clearly that's not true
I feel the vibe between us
Can you feel it too?
Or maybe I'm just trippin'
I'm just really feeling you
You on a power trip, that pretty girl power shit
Got every guy falling
You'd have Superman powerless

It ain't fair, I swear it ain't fair
The way she look I can't help but just stare
She makes me so nervous, probably on purpose
She's just so perfect
I just can't help it

'Cause wise men say only fools rush in
But pretty girls make fools outta wise men
Wise men say only fools rush in
But pretty girls make fools outta wise men, like

Wise men say (you know what they say)
Only fools rush in
And I can't help falling in love with you
