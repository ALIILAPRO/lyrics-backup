		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  On my back like a backpack
Don't bother, I get mine regardless
Blowin' up I'm fucking flawless, yeah

Haters on my back like a backpack
Focused on my check, I get mine regardless
He callin' me the boss, yeah, bitch I'm a star
Wake up in your bed like I'm fucking flawless

Stars on the roof getting to my head
You know what else I like to do when ain't doing that
Shit, I like to shop, I like the finer things
And I don't need to talk or do the money dance
MoMo wants some lover shit
You know you gon' fuck with it
You're gon' wanna hang with us
Baby got the angel dust
Thierry on my body, body bitches for a hobby
But if you got a sloppy tell them, meet me in the lobby

On my back like a backpack
Don't bother, I get mine regardless
Blowin' up I'm fucking flawless, yeah

Stars on the roof getting to my head
You know what else I like to do when ain't doing that
Shit I like to shop, I like the finer things
And I don't need to talk or do the money dance
MoMo wants some lover shit
You know you gon' fuck with it
You're gon' wanna hang with us
Baby got the angel dust
Thierry on my body, body bitches for a hobby
But if you got a sloppy tell them, meet me in the lobby

On my back like a backpack
Don't bother, I get mine regardless
Blowin' up I'm fucking flawless, yeah

Haters on my back like a backpack
Focused on my check, I get mine regardless
He callin' me the boss, yeah, bitch I'm a star
Wake up in your bed like I'm fucking flawless

Stars on the roof getting to my head
You know what else I like to do when ain't doing that
Shit, I like to shop, I like the finer things
And I don't need to talk or do the money dance
MoMo wants some lover shit
You know you gon' fuck with it
You're gon' wanna hang with us
Baby got the angel dust
