		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I like my girls just like I like my honey, sweet
A little selfish
I like my women like I like my money, green
A little jealous
'Cause I'm a beautiful wreck
A colorful mess, but I'm funny
Oh, I'm a heartbreak vet
With a stone-cold neck, yeah, I'm charmin'

All the pretty girls in the world
But I'm in this space with you
Colored out the lines
I came to find, my fire was fate with you
Heartache would stay with you
Fly great escapes with you, oh

I countdown to the clock, saw you awake
Don't walk away, or would you wait for me?
I go out to the bar, fuck hangin' with the stars
Don't even have a car, but you would wait for me, mm-hmm

All, all, all, all the pretty girls in the world
But I'm in this space with you
Colored out the lines
I came to find, my fire was fate with you
My heartache would stay with you
Escape with you

I (I), I like my girls just like I like my honey, sweet
A little selfish, huh
I like my women like I like my money, green
A little jealous
Oh, I'm a beautiful wreck
A colorful mess, but I'm funny
Oh, I'm a heartbreak vet (oh)
With a stone-cold neck, I'm so charmin', oh, oh 

La-la-la-la-la-la-la
Do-do-do do-do
Ooh
Do-do-do do-do
Do-do-do do-do
Da-da-da da-da

Isn't love all we need? Is it love?
Do-do-do do-do
To be the same prophecy? Is it love?
Do-do-do do-do
Do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti, is it love?
Do-do-do do-do
Love (ooh), do-do-do do-do
