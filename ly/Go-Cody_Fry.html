		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wanna go
Do something kind of crazy
I wanna go
Drive all night with you right next to me
I wanna go
Feel the pounding of your heartbeat
When we get up high
Won't look down and won't look back
Yeah, when I die I wanna know
I lived like that

I wanna run in wide spaces
Fly like the wind in high places
Rush like water on my face
With your hand in my hand
I wanna dance into the morning
Kiss you like you've never been kissed before me
I would go anywhere you wanna go
With your hand in my hand

I wanna go
Make pictures look like postcards
I wanna go
Take a train and watch you sleep right in my arms
I wanna go
Where we don't know where we are
Climb something high
Don't look down and don't look back
Yeah, when I die I wanna know
I lived like that

I wanna run in wide spaces
Fly like the wind in high places
Rush like water on my face
With your hand in my hand
I wanna dance into the morning
Kiss you like you've never been kissed before me
I would go anywhere you wanna go
With your hand in my hand

So many things in this world I wanna do
And when I die I wanna know you did them too
Baby, me and you

I wanna run in wide spaces
Fly like the wind in high places
Rush like water on my face
With your hand in my hand
I wanna dance into the morning
Kiss you like you've never been kissed before me
I would go anywhere you wanna go
With your hand in my hand

I wanna run in wide spaces
Fly like the wind in high places
Rush like water on my face
With your hand in my hand
I wanna dance into the morning
Kiss you like you've never been kissed before me
I would go anywhere you wanna go
With your hand in my hand
