		  Show me how you rollercoaster emotion, why don't you make me?
Show me, hold me, tell me, what do you see?
Show me how you rollercoaster emotion, why don't you make
Make me free

Show me how you rollercoaster emotion, why don't you make me?
Show me, hold me, tell me, what do you see?
Show me how you rollercoaster emotion, why don't you make
Make me free

Show me how you rollercoaster emotion, why don't you make me?
Show me, hold me, tell me, what do you see?
Show me how you rollercoaster emotion, why don't you make
Make me free

Show me how you rollercoaster emotion, why don't you make me?
Show me, hold me, tell me, what do you see?
Show me how you rollercoaster emotion, why don't you make
Make me free
