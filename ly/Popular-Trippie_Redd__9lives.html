Yeah, I'm havin' all types of this shit
I'm havin' a lot of it
God, bless me and shit, know I won't swap
I'm on this journey alone, no ain't no stoppin' it (mm)
Skeletons in my home, like fuck a coffin
I did a lot for this shit, you know I'm popular
Big choppas in the bricks, you play, we poppin' (pop)
You play with choppas and shit, you ain't no shotta
Big K in my Truey's, go block a block (bah-bah-bah, bah, bah, brrt, Rich Slime Global)

They comin' around in a flock, choppa on me on the block
I told you I'm never gon' stop, that mean that I'm never gon' stop
Run up this shit and get high, you know that I got it on lock
Tell me the things you know and the fuck he said
I never hear from the opps because we leavin' 'em dead
Rich Slime business, what I fuckin' said
Divine association, ready to sever heads
You the same, shit insane, shit not sane, shit
Ridin' in that foreign, and I'm soarin', ain't no basic
Racks on me, it's pourin', you snorin', on lame shit
Look they mad, I made it, they hatin', I'm famous
And I'm never changin', goin' up, we major
Comin' from the griddy, now I'm in your city
Show the opps no pity, got a problem, then get with me
Got a problem, then get with me
Talkin' slow, droppin' loads, get with me
I said I'm hoppin' down your chimney
You a ho-ho-ho (9lives synthed on the synth), got a present for you
You a ho-ho-ho, got a present for you (bah)
Act like a ho-ho-ho, got a present for you (bah, brrt)
You a ho-ho-ho, got a present for you, uh (ah), uh (oh, yeah)

Yeah, I'm havin' all types of this shit
I'm havin' a lot of it
God, bless me and shit, know I won't swap
I'm on this journey alone, no ain't no stoppin' it (mmm)
Skeletons in my home, like fuck a coffin
I did a lot for this shit, you know I'm popular
Big choppas in the bricks, you play, we poppin' (pop)
You play with choppas and shit, you ain't no shotta
Big K in my Truey's, go block a block (bah-bah-bah, bah, bah, brrt)
