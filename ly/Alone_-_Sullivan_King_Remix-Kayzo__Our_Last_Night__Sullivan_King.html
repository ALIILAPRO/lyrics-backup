		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know sometimes my heart feels cold
I buried my love beneath the snow
And it's hard to me to be vulnerable
Oh, but I'll do anything you need

I don't want you to be alone
I just wanna be your home
I don't want you to be alone anymore

I don't want you to be alone
I just wanna be your home
I don't want you to be alone anymore

(Alone anymore)

I don't want you to be alone
I just wanna be your home (I just wanna be your home)
I don't want you to be alone anymore
Alone anymore

You said you can't do this on your own
I felt your pain but didn't let it show
I built a city to protect your trust
Closing the distance between us
This time, I'll be there for you

I don't want you to be alone
I just wanna be your home
I don't want you to be alone anymore

I don't want you to be alone
I just wanna be your home
I don't want you to be alone anymore

(Alone anymore)

I don't want you to be alone
I just wanna be your home (I just wanna be your home)
I don't want you to be alone anymore
Alone anymore
