		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Trouble, going round. Trouble, going down.
What happened to you little baby? What happened to you little girl?
She said she'd always love you. In your heart shaped world.

Trouble, going round. Trouble, in this town.
What happened to you little baby? What happened to you little girl?
She left you out there crying, in your heart shaped world.

I know what love means to you, I love you to.
It hurts too watch her laugh at you, with someone new.
Trouble, trouble

Trouble, going round, round, round, round, round.
Big cold sunless skies, tumbling down, down, down, down.
What happened to you little baby? What happened to you little girl?
You said she'd always love you. In your heart shaped world.
In your heart Shaped world, In your heart shaped World, In your heart Shaped World
Heart Shaped World, In Your Heart Shaped World.
