		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You've seen the world
What did it look like?
You took a plane
I'll take a push bike
Run with the wolves
Callin' all the wolf pack
When did you go
And when did you get back?

I don't even know you
You're just someone new I don't want to talk to
You're wild
I don't find you crazy at all

You're on the rocks
Would you like to get some?
I'm kind of straight
Where do you come from?
I'm always right
But what's your perception?
I'm kind of shy
Oh, didn't he mention?

I don't even know you
You're just someone new I don't want to talk to
You're wild
I don't find you crazy at all

I don't even know you
You're just someone new I don't want to talk to
You're wild
I don't find you crazy at all
I don't even know you
You're just someone new I don't want to talk to
You're wild
I don't find you crazy at all
