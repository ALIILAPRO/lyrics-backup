		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't get off my high horse and I can't let you go
You are the one who
You are the one who makes me feel so real, yeah yeah yeah

Oh, what am I supposed to do
Oh, what am I supposed to do, baby

When I'm so hooked up on you
Then I realized, oh, I realized
That you are somebody else's guy, oh, yeah
Why you want to do this to me, boy

(Somebody else's guy)

Can you remember the times we've spent together
Sharin' the days in the sun
But then I found out that you were somebody else's love
After all our plans we've made, now they're shattered

But still I can't get off my high horse, I can't let go
You are the one who makes me feel so real
Ooh, what am I supposed to do when I'm hooked so on you
And then I realized that you're somebody else's guy

That day in September, I'm sure you can remember
That's when all the stuff hit you fast
You told me a lie and you didn't have an alibi
But baby, yet I still cared

You know, I loved you so, baby, that I can't let you go, no, no
You are the one who makes me feel so real
Ooh, what am I supposed to do when I'm hooked so on you
And I realize that you're somebody else's guy

You know, I loved you so, baby, that I can't let you go, no
You are the one who make me feel so real
Ooh, what am I supposed to do when I'm hooked so on you
And then I realized that you're somebody else's guy

Oh, I can't get off my high horse and I can't let go
You are the one who makes me feel so real
Ooh, what am I supposed to do when I'm hooked so on you
And I realized that you're somebody else's guy, oh

I can't let you go, no
You are the one who makes me feel so real

Ooh, what am I supposed to do when I'm hooked so on you
And then I realized that you're somebody else's guy, oh

Oh, I can't get off my high horse and I can't let go
You are the one who makes me feel so real
Ooh, what am I supposed to do when I'm hooked so on you
And realized that you're somebody else's guy

Ooh ah
And realized that you're somebody else's guy, oh

Ooh ah
Ooh and realized that you're somebody else's guy, oh

Oh, oh babe babe babe
You are the one who makes me feel so real
What am I supposed to do when I'm hooked so on you
And realized that you're somebody else's guy

Oh, I can't get off my high horse and I can't let go
You are the one who makes me feel so real
Ooh, what am I supposed to do when I'm hooked so on you
And realized that you're somebody else's guy

Oh, I can't get off my high horse and I can't let go
