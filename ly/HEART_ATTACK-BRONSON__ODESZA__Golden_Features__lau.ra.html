		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been patient but I won't follow
'Cause I don't wanna be your friend
Why does it matter in the end?
I want a little bit of lightning
No, I don't wanna be your friend
'Cause these feelings are violent

This love's a heart attack
This love's a heart attack
This love's a heart attack

See, I've been patient but I won't follow
'Cause I don't wanna be your friend
Why does it matter if it ends?
I want a little bit of lightning
No, I don't wanna be your friend
I want a little bit of lightning
No, I don't wanna be your friend
I want a little bit of lightning
Why does it matter if it ends?
But I don't wanna live in silence
Why does it matter in the end?
I want a little bit of lightning
No, I don't wanna be your friend
Because these feelings are violent
Why does it matter in the end?

This love's a heart attack
This love's a heart attack
This love's a heart attack
This love's a heart attack

This love's a heart attack
And no, I won't go back (yeah)
This love's a heart attack (Oh)
This love's a heart attack (Oh, you)

Why does it matter anyway
Why does it matter in the end?
Why does it matter anyway
Why does it matter in the end?
