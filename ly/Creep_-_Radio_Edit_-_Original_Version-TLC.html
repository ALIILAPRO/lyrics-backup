		  (Creep) oh ah, oh ah, oh ah yeah
(Creep) oh ah, oh ah, oh ah yeah

(Creep) oh ah, oh ah, oh ah yeah
(Creep) oh ah, oh ah, oh ah yeah

The twenty second of loneliness
And we've been through so many things
I love my man with all honesty
But I know he's cheating on me
Look him in the eyes
But all he tells me is lies to keep me near

I'll never leave him down though I might mess around
It's only 'cause I need some affection, oh
So I creep, yeah, just creepin' on
On the down low, 'cept nobody is supposed to know
So I creep yeah, 'cause he doesn't know what I do
And no attention goes to show, oh

So I creep
The twenty third of loneliness
And we don't talk, like we used to do
Now this is pretty strange
But I'm not buggin' 'cause I still feel the same
I Keep giving loving till the day he pushes me away
Never go a stray

If he knew the things I did, he couldn't handle me
And I choose to keep him protected, oh
So I creep, yeah, just creepin' on
But I'll know, 'cept nobody is supposed to know
So I creep, yeah, 'cause he doesn't know what I do
And no attention goes to show oh

So I creep, yeah, just creepin' on
But I'll know, 'cept nobody is supposed to know
So I creep, yeah, 'cause he doesn't know what I do
And no attention goes to show

So I creep, oh ah, oh ah, oh ah yeah
So I creep, oh ah, oh ah, oh ah yeah
So I creep, oh ah, oh ah, oh ah yeah
Baby, oh ah, oh ah, oh ah yeah

So I creep, yeah, just creepin' on
But I'll know

So I creep, yeah, 'cause he doesn't know what I do
And no attention goes to show
So I creep, yeah, just creepin' on
But I'll know
So I creep, yeah, 'cause he doesn't know what I do
So I creep, 'cept nobody is supposed to know
