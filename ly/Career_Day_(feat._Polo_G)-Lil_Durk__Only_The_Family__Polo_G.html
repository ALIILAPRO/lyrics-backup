Career day in school, never be a policeman
Top floor of the Fontainebleau having threesome
Look you in your eyes, say they love you just don't believe them
In the trenches got to play 'em close like you need 'em
Chest pains, I was sipping lean by the liter
How you screaming that you got some killers, you don't feed 'em?
Booka steady tripping when I say I don't believe in Jesus
Don't ever put your all into a bitch cause she gon' leave

And I know a couple of Atlanta hoes who wear her lashes
In the trap I fuck the baddest bitches on a mattress
Give into the trenches took advantage of my kindness
I done gave a nigga a lot of pounds without asking
Government, did that shutdown he got his time in
Damn well he 'posed supposed to be on home confinement
Killers right on standby off my word just like Simon
I can judge a nigga by his character off his diamonds
I know a nigga, he shooting dice with the T's
But how you say that when I give him all he needs
And Even though he ain't show no love I try to reach
In commonwealth he took a dub, nigga please

Is it possible they love you like they say they do?
Is it possible your homies they gon' hate on you?
For that check, I have your day ones to lay on you
Is they keeping it one-thousand like they say they do?
They don't understand me, addicted to them Xannies
Told you we ain't friends, it's only the family
Is it possible you gon' ride?
Is it possible you gon' ride?

Out on thirteen-hunnid so don't act like you can't find us
Tim-tim lost his life, I bang the same block he died for
September 18th, ain't that the same shit we cried for?
All them niggas got to sliding when them tears dried up
Made it out the trenches we young vets and survivors
Learned so much from that corner, bumped my head but now I'm wiser
Chasing after trends I risked my freedom for designer
Almost lost my life got out and I was on that timer
Now I hit up Treasures with a hunnid-thousand on me
I don't fuck with niggas I'm with Blast or by my lonely
Loyalty dying slow you gotta watch out for your homies
If any nigga play, a dead man is what he gon' be

Is it possible they love you like they say they do?
Is it possible your homies they gon' hate on you?
For that check, I have your day ones to lay on you
Is they keeping it one-thousand like they say they do?
They don't understand me, addicted to them Xannies
Told you we ain't friends, it's only the family
Is it possible you gon' ride?
Is it possible you gon' ride?
