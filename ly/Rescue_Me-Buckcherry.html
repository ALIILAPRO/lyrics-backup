		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You can't erase this deep inside of me
I know I'm not a sight to see
But baby I'm alive
I cherish the love and I cherish the life that's inside of me
I know I'm not a sight to see
But baby I'm alive

Won't you come and rescue me
Separate myself from me
Maybe I'm too blind to see
Save my life
Rescue me

I lie awake it takes it's toll on me
And now my broken heart it bleeds
But baby I'm alive
I cherish the love and I cherish the life that's inside of me
And now my broken heart it bleeds
But baby I'm alive

[Chorus]
Won't you come and rescue me
Separate myself from me
Maybe I'm too blind to see
Save my life
Won't you come and rescue me
I'm torn away from what I need
Help me now I'm way too deep
Save my life

It's not over now
And I just want to say
You'll never be left out
I love you more today
It's not over now
No more time to waste
Kiss me on the mouth
And take my breath away

I cherish the love and I cherish the life that's inside of me
I know I'm not a sight to see
But baby I'm alive

[Chorus]
