		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lady you're looking mighty fine tonight
Makes me just feel I want to hold you right
Come let me take you on a ride with me
Oh girl you give me everything I need

('Cause I like it) Ooh I like it
(And you got it) 'Cause you got it baby
(And I want it) Right now
(Don't you hide it) Don't you hide it baby
(Girl let's try it) I want to try it with you
(Let's satisfy it) Bring it home to me

[Chorus:]
'Cause there's something in the way that you move
And you just don't know what you're making me do
And there's something in the way that you groove
And all I want to do is get down with you

Lady don't have me waitin' for too long
I got this feelin' deep inside so strong
No one could ever touch what you do
You really turn me on, baby through and through

('Cause I like it) Ooh I like it
(And you got it) 'Cause you got it baby
(And I want it) Right now
(Don't you hide it) Don't you hide it baby
(Girl let's try it) I want to try it with you
(Let's satisfy it) Bring it home to me

[Chorus:]

'Cause its the way that you move that makes me feel so fine
It's the way you groove that makes me blow my mind
It's the way that you move that makes me feel so fine
It's the way that you groove that makes me

[Chorus:]

Do you want to get personal?
'Cause I want to get close to you
I want to tell you 'bout the way that I feel
Never felt a love so good
Wouldn't stop it if I could
I'm gonna show you that this love's for real

[Chorus:]
