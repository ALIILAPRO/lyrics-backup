		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Rose girls in glass vases
Perfect bodies, perfect faces
They all belong in magazines
Those girls the boys are chasing
Winning all the games they're playing
They're always in a different league

Stretching toward the sky like I don't care
Wishing you could see me standing there

But I'm a sunflower, a little funny
If I were a rose, maybe you'd want me
If I could, I'd change overnight
I'd turn into something you'd like

But I'm a sunflower, a little funny
If I were a rose, maybe you'd pick me
But I know you don't have a clue
This sunflower's waiting for you
Waiting for you

But I'm a sunflower, a little funny
And if I were her, maybe you'd pick me
But I know you don't have a clue
This sunflower's waiting for you
Waiting for you
