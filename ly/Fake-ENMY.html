		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Find another shoulder
Grow a little colder
We're cynical
Flame to a smolder
Rock and a boulder
Unsustainable
Is it too late
Time to drop dead weight
Watch resentment turn to hate
So we're getting nowhere at a faster rate
Do what it takes to make them believe
Lie to yourself just so you can sleep
Delusion inclined and on a repeat
Repeat, repeat, repeat, repeat
Can't see eye to eye don't understand it
It's harder to believe you didn't plan it
You're lying to my face
Don't look back don't hesitate
We built it up just so that you could break it
Break it down
Confident and stable
Cards on the table
Decency erased
Did you ever find
Searching when you're blind
The feeling that you chased
Is it too late
Time to drop dead weight
Watch resentment turn to hate
So we're getting nowhere at a faster rate
Can't see eye to eye don't understand it
It's harder to believe you didn't plan it
You're lying to my face
Don't look back don't hesitate
We built it up just so that you could break it
Play it kind by design
But I won't take the bait
Ignore the signs
Play it blind
But I still see you're fake
Can't believe I took the bait
Do what it takes to make them believe
Lie to yourself just so you can sleep
Delusion inclined and on a repeat
Repeat, repeat, repeat, repeat
Can't see eye to eye don't understand it
It's harder to believe you didn't plan it
You're lying to my face
Don't look back don't hesitate
We built it up just so that you could break it
Just to break it down
