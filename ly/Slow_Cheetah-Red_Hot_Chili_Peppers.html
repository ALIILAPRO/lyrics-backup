		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One, two, three, four

Waking up dead, inside of my head
Would never, never do
There is no med-, no medicine to take
I've had a chance to be insane, asylum from the falling rain
I've had a chance to break

It's so bad, it's got to be good
Mysterious girl misunderstood, dressed like a wedding cake
Any other day and I might play a funeral march for Bonnie Brae
Why try and run away?

Slow cheetah, come before my forest
Looks like it's on today
Slow cheetah, come, it's so euphoric
No matter what they say

I knew a girl
She worked in a store, she knew not what her life was for
She barely knew her name
They tried to tell her she would never be as happy as a girl in a magazine
She bought it with her pay

Slow cheetah, come before my forest
Looks like it's on today
Slow cheetah, come, it's so euphoric
No matter what they say

Everyone has so much to say
They talk, talk, talk their lives away
Don't even hesitate
Walking on down to the burial ground
It's a very old dance with a merry old sound
Looks like it's on today

Slow cheetah, come before my forest
Looks like it's on today
Slow cheetah, come, it's so euphoric
No matter what they say
Slow cheetah, come before my forest
Looks like it's on today
Slow cheetah, come, it's so euphoric
No matter what they say
