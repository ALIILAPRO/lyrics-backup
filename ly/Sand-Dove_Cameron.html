		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What's worse
Being wanted but not loved
Or loved but not wanted?
What's worse
Hearing what you wanna hear
Or hearing what's honest?

Our love's misaligned
'Cause you're on my mind every night
I ignore the signs
And I don't know why
'Cause, baby, I

I saw the end when we began
You couldn't love the way I can
I tried to bargain with the stars
For more than half your heart
But you have more pieces of me than the desert has sand
And I have less pieces of you than I can hold in my hand

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

What hurts
Is the one thing that you wanna do
Is the one thing that you shouldn't do
What hurts
Is knowing what's good for you
Just doesn't look good to you

Our love's misaligned
'Cause you're on my mind every night
I stretch out the time
And now I know why
'Cause, baby, I

I saw the end when we began
You couldn't love the way I can
I tried to bargain with the stars
For more than half your heart
But you have more pieces of me than the desert has sand
And I have less pieces of you than I can hold in my hand

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

What's worse
Being wanted but not loved
Or loved but not wanted?
What's worse
Hearing what you wanna hear
Or hearing what's honest?

I saw the end when we began
You couldn't love the way I can
Tried to bargain with the stars
For more than half your heart
But you have more pieces of me than the desert has sand
And I have less pieces of you
Oh, I have less pieces of you than I can hold in my hand
