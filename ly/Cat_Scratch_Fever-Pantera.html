		  Alright

Well, I don't know where they come from, but they sure do come
I hope they're comin' for me
And I don't know how they do it, but they sure do it good
I hope they do it for free

They give me cat scratch fever
Cat scratch fever

Well, the first time that I got it I was just ten years old
I got it from some pussy next door
Then I went to see the doctor and he gave me the cure
I think I want it some more

They give me cat scratch fever
Cat scratch fever
I got it bad scratch fever
Cat scratch fever

It's nothing dangerous
I feel no pain
I've got to ch-ch-change
You know you got it when you're goin' insane
It makes a grown man cry, cry
Won't you make my bed

Well, I make a pussy purr with the stroke of my hand
They know they gettin' it from me
And they know just where to go when they need a lovin' man
They know I'm doin' it for free

I give 'em cat scratch fever
Cat scratch fever
They got it bad scratch fever
Cat scratch fever

Cat scratch fever
Cat scratch fever
Cat scratch fever
Cat scratch fever

Cat scratch fever
Cat scratch fever
Cat scratch fever
Cat scratch fever

Yeah
Cat scratch fever
