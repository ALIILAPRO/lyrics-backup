		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can't believe I still avoid East Side
Even though I know that you don't live there now
Lately you're the only thing on my mind
And I can't stop myself from driving by your house

Ooh, every time I hear our song it kinda hurts me still
And ooh, even after all this time I kinda miss you still
I'm wondering

Do you even think about it?
The way that we changed the world
And don't it make you sad
That we'll never be kids again?
No, we'll never be kids again
Tell me how you live without it
Did somebody change your world
And now you don't look back
'Cause we'll never be kids again
No, we'll never be kids again
No, we'll never, never, ever, ever, ever, ever

Livin' out of suitcases and hotels
Drinking way too much and talking through the night
Really wish I didn't know you so well
Wouldn't be so hard to leave the past behind

Ooh, every time I hear our song it kinda hurts me still
And ooh, even after all this time I kinda miss you still
I'm wondering

Do you even think about it?
The way that we changed the world
And don't it make you sad
That we'll never be kids again?
No, we'll never be kids again
Tell me how you live without it
Did somebody change your world
And now you don't look back
'Cause we'll never be kids again
No, we'll never be kids again
No, we'll never, never, ever, ever, ever, ever

Mm, mm
No, I-I-I-I, I
Mm, mm

Do you even think about it?
The way that we changed the world
And don't it make you sad
That we'll never be kids again?
No, we'll never be kids again
Tell me how you live without it
Did somebody change your world
And now you don't look back
'Cause we'll never be kids again
No, we'll never be kids again
No, we'll never, never, ever, ever, ever, ever
