		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I gotta find a way, to find a better day without you
And thoughts are hard to say, I miss you every day

Now you're not here with me

I never thought that you would leave me
Oh, I know the time will make it easy, baby

And you'll never know how much I'm missing you
And all the things that I've been going through ooh ooh
And you'll never know how I got through it all
Now baby I'm invincible oh oh

Like sunshine after rain, I'm on my own again
Without you
I've had to let you go, I wanted you to know
That I'm still here for you

It doesn't work when we're together
Just good friends will last forever Baby

And you'll never know how much I'm missing you
And all the things that I've been going through ooh ooh
And you'll never know how I got through it all
Now baby I'm invincible oh oh

You never told me it would end this way
I never said it was OKAY
I never told you to leave today
How could you leave me on my own

And you'll never know how much I'm missing you
And all the things that I've been going through ooh ooh
And you'll never know how I got through it all
Now baby I'm invincible oh oh
