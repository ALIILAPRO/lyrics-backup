		  Wait

Why’d you have to go away

I’m feeling the weight of this on me

Why’d you have to go away

Moving on



But why would you waste it

Going home like you don’t care

Take your time let you face it

Let me know I’ve been driving all night



I’ll be your home when you’re feeling right

You’re not alone when I’m by your side

Take me on baby one last time

I’ll be your home when you’re feeling right



Change

Always ends up just the same

Like nobody’s standing still but me

I’ll be crashing with the waves

Moving on



But why would you waste it

Going home like you don’t care

Take your time let you face it

Let me know I’ve been driving all night



I’ll be your home when you’re feeling right

You’re not alone when I’m by your side

Take me on baby one last time

I’ll be your home when you’re feeling right
