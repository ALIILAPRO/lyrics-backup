		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Why do we sit around and break each other's hearts tonight?
Why do we dance around the issues 'til the morning light?
When we sit and talk and tear each other's lives apart
You were the one to tell me, "go"

But you were the one for me and now you're going through the door
When you take that step, I love you, baby, more and more
We need to laugh and sing and cry and warm each other's hearts tonight
Observing fun of everything and loving all of mother God

Tearing us, you're tearing us
You're breaking us, you're breaking us
You're killing us, killing us
You're saving us, you're saving us
You're tearing us, you're tearing us
You're breaking us, breaking us
You're killing us, killing us
You're saving us

Why do we sit around and break each other's hearts tonight?
Why do we dance around the issues 'til the morning light?
When we sit and talk and tear each other's lives apart
You were the one to tell me, "go"

But you were the one for me and now you're going through the door
When you take that step, I love you, baby, more and more
We need to laugh and sing and cry and warm each other's hearts tonight
Observing fun of everything and loving all of mother God

You're tearing us, you're tearing us
You're breaking us, you're breaking us
You're killing us, killing us
You're saving us, you're saving us
You're tearing us, you're tearing us
You're breaking us, you're breaking us
You're killing us, killing us
You're saving us

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Forever alive, forever alive
Forever, forever
Forever alive, forever alive
Forever
Never and ever again

You're tearing us, you're tearing us
You're breaking us, you're breaking us
You're killing us, killing us
You're saving us, you're saving us
You're tearing us, you're tearing us
You're breaking us, you're breaking us
You're killing us, killing us
You're saving us, you're saving us

(Forever alive) you're tearing us, you're tearing us
(Forever alive) you're breaking us, you're breaking us
(Forever) you're killing us, killing us
You're saving us, you're saving us
(Forever alive) you're tearing us, you're tearing us
(Forever alive) you're breaking us, you're breaking us
(Forever) you're killing us, killing us
You're saving us
