		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We're startin' up now we're on our way 
Leaving all our yesterdays behind 
Something special that we want to say 
Happiness is just a state of mind 

Flashback 
To the days when the nights were young 
Flashback 
When we could do no wrong 
Flashback 
We used to dance to the light of dawn 
Flashback 
When our hearts were so strong 

Yeah 

Flashback 
To the days when the nights were young 
Flashback [Ah ah ah]
When we could do no wrong 
Flashback 
We used to dance to the light of dawn 
Flashback [Ah ah ah]
To when our hearts were so strong 

Living in the shadow of our yesterday 
Memories of children in the sun 
Everybody's looking back but that don't pay 
Can't you see you've only just begun 

Flashback 
To the days when the nights were young 
Flashback 
When we could do no wrong 
Flashback [Ah ah ah]
We used to dance to the light of dawn 
Flashback [Ah ah ah ah]
When our hearts were so strong 

Flashback [Ah ah ah ah]
Flashback [Ah ah ah]
Flashback [Ah ah ah ah]
Flashback [Ah ah ah] 

Flashback [Ah ah ah ah]
Flashback [Ah ah ah]
Flashback [Ah ah ah ah]
Flashback [Ah ah ah] 

Flashback [Ah ah ah ah]
To the days when the nights were young 
Flashback [Ah ah ah]
When we could do no wrong 
Flashback [Ah ah ah ah]
We used to dance to the light of dawn 
Flashback [Ah ah ah]
To when our hearts were so strong 
Flashback [Ah ah ah]
To the days when the nights were young 
Flashback [Ah ah ah]
When we could do no wrong 
Flashback [Ah ah ah ah]
We used to dance to the light of dawn 
Flashback [Ah ah ah]
To when our hearts were so strong 

Flashback [Ah ah ah ah]
Flashback [Ah ah ah]
Flashback [Ah ah ah ah]
Flashback [Ah ah ah]
