		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hope I don't fall all I really want is love
I can see in her eye her eye, her eye
We won't last long hope I don't fall
All I really want is love
I can see in her eye her eye, her eye
We won't last long
I can't deal with uncertainty
All these girls, they've been hurting me
Hope you know one is all I need
All they give me's insanity
All they give me's insanity
All they give me's anxiety
Wait I can't breathe
I think you'll be the death of me

Hope I don't fall all I really want is love
I can see in her eye her eye, her eye
We won't last long hope I don't fall
All I really want is love
I can see in her eye her eye, her eye
We won't last long

I can't deal with uncertainty
All these girls, they've been hurting me
Hope you know one is all I need
All they give me's insanity
All they give me's insanity
All they give me's anxiety
Wait I can't breathe
I think you'll be the death of me
