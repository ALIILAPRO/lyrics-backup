		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lonely wind, blue rain falls, standing alone
Light that I chased is you

Faraway blurring, longing to belong
Sailing through surging billows

Wondering how can I touch your time
On my way to destiny

When I am facing reality
Don't to be walking alone

I want to know how long it will takes get there
Anyone can't make me fall

Though I am go astray in deepest maze
I'm the one who make it real

Ah, how can I touch your time
On my way to destiny

Ah, where are you in the end?
Will this maze guide me to you?

Though I am go astray in deepest maze
I'm the one who make it real

Lonely wind, blue rain falls, waiting someone
Light that I chased is you

Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo
Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo
