		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Build a doll and rearrange her parts for fun, like every day
And fill her head with all the morbid falsehoods that you have to say
Stay still, internalize the lies. Until a part of her will dies

Dress her up and down, and take the pictures that you love so much
To show the world who owns her, use your ownership, a moral crutch to
Kill the trust created of the bond that once was known as love

Someone cracked your dolly, imperfections part her glassy lips
You only glue them back together so she doesn't go off script and
Speak her full resentful mind, so weak, to superglue and time

Dolly's getting older, full of all the cracks you never mended
Now she's got to fix herself without a guide, her mind expended
Here, she's become her own child, to parent headspaces defiled

You, her maker, only made her person for the novelty
Of owning your own pretty doll that you show off for all to see
Her skin is bulging with the flesh encased beneath ceramic mesh

Looking down, she notices the bits of aforementioned skin and
It all clicks together, all this time she was human within
But made to be the perfect pet, for years a one-sided duet
