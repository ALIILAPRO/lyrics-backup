		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well I believe there's something watching over you
They're watching every single thing you say
And when you die they'll set you down and take you through
You'll realize one day

That the grass is always greener on the other side
The neighbor's got a new car that you want to drive
And when time is running out you want to stay alive

We all live under the same sky
We all will live we all will die
There is no wrong
There is no right
The circle only has one side

We all try hard to live our lives in harmony
For fear of falling swiftly overboard
But life is both a major and minor key
Just open up the chord

But the grass is always greener on the other side
The neighbour's got a new car that you want to drive
And when time is running out you want to stay alive

We all live under the same sky
We all will live
We all will die
There is no wrong
There is no right
The circle only has one side
