		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In 2001 when I was 18 years old
Still in my uniform, educated, uninformed
A war raged out in front of me
Showing me racism and lies
And I began to see the world 
Through different eyes 
Then I moved to London
By the age of Cameron
I was stood at Brixton station
Holding a phone against cops' faces
Who stopped and searched a black child 
Just for running for their bus
And it was then I knew we had no one to trust 
Yeah, I want to know 
What's wrong with changing?
Yeah, I want to know
What's not changing?

Let's move forward a little bit
A lid-el-ee-iddle bit forward to 2015 
The island of Ireland is making a real big scene:
Gay marriage voted YES
Panti Bliss is the Queen! 
And there's nothing stopping there
It broke the church from the state 
To Repeal The 8th 
And now it's moving in a positive way
And you love to see it! 
Yeah, I want to know
What's not changing
Everything changing everything changing
Yes
