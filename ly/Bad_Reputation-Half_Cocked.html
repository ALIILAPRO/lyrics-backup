		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't give a damn about my reputation
You're living in the past, it's a new generation
And a girl can do what she wants to do
And that's what I'm gonna do
And I don't give a damn about my bad reputation
Oh no
Not me

I don't give a damn about my reputation
I never said I wanted to improve ma station
And I'm always feeling goo when I'm having fun
And I don't have to please not one
And I don't give a damn about my bad reputation
Oh no
Not me
Whoa no
Not me

I don't give a damn about my reputation
I've never been afraid of any deviation
And I don't really care what you keep on the screen
I ain't gonna change
And I'm never gonna care about my bad reputation
Whoa no
Not me
Whoa no
Not me

Break it down
I don't give a damn about my reputation
The world's in trouble
There's no communication
Everyone can say what they want to say
It'll never get better anyway
So why should I care about a bad reputation
Anyway?
Oh no
Not me
Whoa no
Not me
Whoa no
Not me
Whoa no
Not me
