		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She's a problem
Cuz she knows what she wants
At the bottom
She climbs her way to the top
She's an issue
Cuz she can't be shut up
Won't submit to the ones
Trying to keep her down
Righteous
Priceless
So bold they are calling her crazy
Legs wide
Head high
She walk she talk like a lady
Whoo
She walk she talk like a lady
Whoo
Like a lady
She's the resistance
Fighting for her piece
She's persistent
She is not ashamed to bleed
She's the focus
The alpha and the queen
She's the lotus
Oh the mud don't make her mean
Righteous
Priceless
So bold they are calling her crazy
Legs wide
Head high
She walk she talk like a lady
Whoo
She walk she talk like a lady
Whoo
Like a lady
When they shame her, blame her, tame her but the girl is too proud
Can't stop that pussy power!
When theyâ€™re screaming to be silent cuz the glory too loud
Can't stop that pussy power!
When her back is on the wall but she won't back down
Can't stop that pussy power!
When she's fighting tooth and nail just to keep her damn crown
Can't stop that pussy power!
Righteous
Priceless
So bold they are calling her crazy
Legs wide
Head high
She walk she talk like a lady
Whoo
She walk she talk like a lady
Whoo
Like a lady
