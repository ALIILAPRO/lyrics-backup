		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Granddaddy grew up on dirt floors
The whole county was dirt poor
Mama died when he was four
What a damn shame

They grew tobacco and raised hogs
Seven youngins and some old dogs
I reckon they were livin' high on the hog
Way back in their day

He'd say, "You won't born, to just pay bills and die"
You won't born to just pay bills and die
All you need is a dog, a shack with a creek in the back
And a, a good woman to hold
You don't need that rich man's gold

People walkin' down easy street
Actin' like they've got hot coals under their feet
But they ain't been a day without nothin' to eat
You bet the farm on that

You gotta start livin' off the land, and livin' on love
Givin' up thanks to the Lord above
'Cause when they put you down in that cold dark ground

You gonna wish you won't born to just pay bills and die
You won't born to just pay bills and die
All you need is a dog, a shack with a creek in the back
And a, a good woman to hold
Don't need that rich man's gold
