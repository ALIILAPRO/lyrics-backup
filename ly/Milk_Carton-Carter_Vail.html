		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're always talking about leaving 
Milk carton black and white face 
Smile vacant for the picture 
Parents waiting in the driveway 
 
Oh my darling Arizona 
Why you packing up your suitcase 
Hasn't anybody told ya 
Oh 
 
My mouth on fire 
Drowning in your 
 
Holy water I could be better 
It's time to move on I won't be yours forever 
Holy water I could be better 
It's time to move on I won't be yours forever 
 
Now I'm waiting in your basement 
Blood stains on your pink dress 
Don't you leave me on the pavement 
You look so good in red 
 
Don't you cry Arizona 
I never want to see you that way 
I'll be your milk carton darling 
Leave me cut cut up 
Cut cut up 
 
Holy water I could be better 
It's time to move on I won't be yours forever 
Holy water I could be better 
It's time to move on I won't be yours forever 
I won't be yours forever
