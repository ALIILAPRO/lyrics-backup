		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Closer, no hesitation
Give me all that you have

And it's been so long, that I can't explain
And it's been so wrong
Right now, so wrong

Naked, my thoughts are creeping
Too late, the show has begun

'Cause it's been so long, that I can't confess
And it's been so wrong
Right now, so wrong

Is it all as it seems?
So unresolved, so unredeemed
If I remain, how will I know?

'Cause it's been so long, that I can't be sure
And it's been so wrong
Right now, so wrong
