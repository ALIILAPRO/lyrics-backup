		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Calm down, twenty five was it a waste of time?
All we did twice underlined
Same tracks on the ground
We're spinning round and round
Oh please someone gets a car

We made our way across the land
We made our way across the town
(We're all about to explode)

So oh oh oh oh, time for a change
Oh oh oh oh well, can you feel it?
So oh oh oh oh, time for a change
Oh oh oh oh well, can you feel it?

Sometimes, comin' home at dawn you realize
All your city's undersized
Woman, friends of mine I've got to leave afar
But I'll never let you down

We made our way across the land
We made our way across the town
(We're all about to explode)

So oh oh oh oh, time for a change
Oh oh oh oh well, can you feel it?
So oh oh oh oh, time for a change
Oh oh oh oh well, can you feel it?

Oh oh oh oh oh, I'm ready to run
What is your plan now what's on your mind?
Oh oh oh oh oh, I'm ready to run
What is your plan now what's on your mind?

We made our way across the land
We made our way across the town
(We're all about to explode)

So oh oh oh oh, time for a change
Oh oh oh oh well, can you feel it?
So oh oh oh oh, time for a change
Oh oh oh oh well, can you feel it?

So oh oh oh oh, time for a change
Oh oh oh oh well, can you feel it?
So oh oh oh oh, time for a change
Oh oh oh oh well, can you feel it?
