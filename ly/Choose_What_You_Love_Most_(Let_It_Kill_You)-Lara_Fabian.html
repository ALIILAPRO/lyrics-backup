		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Was in a place where I wished for the love of my life
I've suffered more in these arms and I thought I would die
And now I tremble on the brink like a shivering child
Praying not to fall, if it hurts it will be worth a flight

If I blow it, I'll know it
I'll face it with my open broken heart and my wiser eyes
If I blow it so goes in
I won't regret a thing I did, just the things I didn't try

Choose what you love most, and let it kill you
If you have to
Choose what you love most, and let it kill you
And let it kill you

My freedom wasted to surrender and give you my life
I feel that I'm over my head but I'm taking the dive
I'll take a breath with your kiss of death, if I survive
I knew with the next breath I'm immortalized

If I blow it, I'll know it
I'll face it with my open broken heart and my wiser eyes
If I blow it so goes in
I won't regret a thing I did, just the things I didn't try

Choose what you love most, and let it kill you
If you have to
Choose what you love most, and let it kill you
Let it kill you

And let it kill you
Let it kill you
Choose what you love most, and let it kill you
Let it kill you
Let it kill you
Let it kill you
