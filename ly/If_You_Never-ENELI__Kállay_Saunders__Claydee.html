		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  oh young girl
i know your hearts so heavy falling out your chest
and your minds so busy caught up in your head
thought that love was supposed to be so divine, so divine
if you never been young then you’ll never get old
and if you’ve never felt pain then you’ll never know joy
if you’ve never been broken then you’ll never know love
these are the words of a wise man’s soul
oh young girl
won’t you slow down you’re not running out of time
and if you’re running out of tears i’ll give you mine
though that life was supposed to be so divine, so divine
if you never been young then you’ll never get old
and if you’ve never felt pain then you’ll never know joy
and if you’ve never been broken you don’t know love
these are the words of a wise man's soul
these are the words of a wise man's soul
if you never been young then you’ll never get old
and if you’ve never felt pain then you’ll never know joy
if you’ve never been broken then you’ll never know love
these are the words of a wise man’s soul
