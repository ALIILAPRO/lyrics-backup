		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you could only change yourself
You could be their everything
Do you feel you're not good enough?
Why do you care what they think?

If you only could...
What would you change?

Can you tell me how
I can get you through?
When I spend all my time
Saving you from you
Self destruct

Is it hard for you to say no?
Do you feel their condescension?
They want you to do what you're told
And you do for their attention

Does the noise inside your head
take your focus from the dread?
If I take away your stress
Will you push me to the edge?
