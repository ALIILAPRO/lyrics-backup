		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Smeared black ink your face is ashen
And I'm barely listening to last demands
I'm staring at the asphalt wondering what's buried underneath
Where I am
Where I am

I'll wear my badge a vinyl sticker with big block letters adherent to my chest
That tells your new friends I am a visitor here
I am not permanent
And the only thing keeping me dry is
Where I am (you seem so out of context in this gaudy apartment complex)
Where I am (a stranger with your door key explaining that I am just visiting)
Where I am (and I am finally seeing why I was the one worth leaving)
(Why I was the one worth leaving)

D.C. sleeps alone tonight
D.C. sleeps alone tonight
Where I am (you seem so out of context in this gaudy apartment complex)
Where I am (a stranger with your door key explaining that I am just visiting)
Where I am (and I am finally seeing why I was the one worth leaving)
(Why I was the one worth leaving)

The district sleeps alone tonight after the bars turn out their lights
And leave the autos swerving into the loneliest evening
And I am finally seeing
Why I was the one worth leaving
Why I was the one worth leaving
Why I was the one worth leaving
Why I was the one worth leaving
