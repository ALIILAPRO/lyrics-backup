		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell me somethin', give me hope for the night
We don't know how we feel
We're just prayin' that we're doin' this right
Though that's not the way it seems

Summer gone, now winter's on its way
I will miss the days we had
The days we had
I will miss the days we had
The days we had
Oh, I'll miss the days we had

Loving, leaving, it's too late for this now
Such esteem for each has gone
Has time driven our season away?
'Cause that's the way it seems

In the world of the speech that is new
I'll be back again to stay
Again to stay
I'll be back again to stay
Again to stay
I'll be back again to stay
