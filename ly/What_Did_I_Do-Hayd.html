		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's funny how life takes time
From under your fingers
Like snowfall takes the life
Of flowers in winter

We're all just passing by
Too quickly to linger
So scared we're gonna die
Before we begin to

Get done all the left undones
There's still so much I'm running from
I felt us start to fall in love
But I didn't see it through

Oh, what did I do?
Tried to follow my heart, follow my heart far from you
Oh, what did I do?
'Cause now I'm falling apart, falling apart far from you
You told me to fly away
You don't wanna weigh me down
But I'm drowning in all this space
My wings feel smaller now
Oh, what did I do?

I lay awake most nights
Painting a picture
Of what could be in my mind
If I didn't leave to

Get done all the left undones
There's still so much I'm running from
I felt us start to fall in love
But I didn't see it through

Oh, what did I do?
Tried to follow my heart, follow my heart far from you
Oh, what did I do?
'Cause now I'm falling apart, falling apart far from you
You told me to fly away
You don't wanna weigh me down
But I'm drowning in all this space
My wings feel smaller now
Oh, what did I do?

You told me to fly away
You don't wanna weigh me down
But I'm drowning in all this space
My wings feel smaller now
Oh, what did I do?
