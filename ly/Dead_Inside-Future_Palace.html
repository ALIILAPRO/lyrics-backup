		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I revisit an old phase of mine
This feels too familiar oh I can't
Oh I can't
Play on repeat again
I act just like a record that got stuck
Oh this phase sucked so much

It’s scary how quickly we
Can switch to who we used be

Delete me out of your memory
Erase all of what wasn't meant to be

Back in this wrestling ring
Fighting for something I can't get
Tell me what am I fighting for
I punch myself right in the throat
And scream what are you doing to us
This pain makes me realize
There’s no one who wins this game

Delete me out of your memory
Erase all of what wasn't meant to be
I've tried, I've tried so many times to think straight
I can't deny I wish we took another way
Delete me out of your memory
Your memory, your memory

Delete me out of your memory
Erase all of what wasn't meant to be
Delete me out of your memory
Erase all of what wasn't meant to be

Delete me out of your memory
Erase all of what wasn't meant to be
I've tried, I've tried so many times to think straight
I can't deny I wish we took another way
Delete me out of your memory
Your memory
