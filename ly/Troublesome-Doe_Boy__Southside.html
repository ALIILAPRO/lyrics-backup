		  This that Doe Beezy from 2012
Lex Luger (brrt, brrt)
Yeah
Know what, matter fact 
I'ma, I'ma take it back a lil' further (Doe Beezy)
Hahaha
Let's go

Let me take it back to 2009 (2009, yeah)
I was hittin' houses but they knew not to hit mine (fools)
Had a .38 but playin' off, our bullets flyin' (bullets flyin')
'Fore you think 'bout tryin', think 'bout dyin'
I ain't cappin', ask my mom (oh really? True story)
Even though she took my gun, I bought another one (bought another one, boom-boom, boom)
Upgraded to that Trey 57, damn, I'm troublesome (you think I'm playin'? Troublesome)
Look at me, ain't hard to see, you play, I'm slumpin' some' (boom, boom-boom-boom)
My ice, ain't tuckin' none (fool), bitch, I'm chuckin' somethin' (brrt)

If he run up on Doe Beezy, that's gon' get that fool hurt (boom, boom-boom-boom)
Put some money on my head, you gon' get your goon murked (yeah)
I don't shoot back, everybody know me, know I shoot first (Doe Beezy)
Barely went to class but kept that pole tucked like a school shirt (oh really?)
Muggin' in the club, yeah, he look like he plan on touchin' somethin' (stop playin')
Reach, pussy boy, I dare you (pussy), bet we be stumpin' somethin' (gang-gang)
I'll smack the taste out your mouth, think you tough or somethin' (ha)
I am not the one I thought you knew, I'm my mother's son (bitch, I'm baby's son)
One phone call, hundred guns start clappin' (brrt-brrt)
Nigga try the gang, bet the birds start flappin' (brr, brr-brr)
Never heard about Beezy, boy, you better go and ask 'em (Doe Beezy, Doe Beezy)
I had so much fun with choppers but "So Much Fun" went platinum (slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt)

Let me take it back to 2009 (2009, yeah)
I was hittin' houses but they knew not to hit mine (fools)
Had a .38 but playin' off, our bullets flyin' (bullets flyin')
'Fore you think 'bout tryin', think 'bout dyin'
I ain't cappin', ask my mom (oh really? True story)
Even though she took my gun, I bought another one (bought another one, boom-boom, boom)
Upgraded to that Trey 57, damn, I'm troublesome (you think I'm playin'? Troublesome)
Look at me, ain't hard to see, you play, I'm slumpin' some' (true story, boom, boom-boom-boom)
My ice, ain't tuckin' none (fool), bitch, I'm chuckin' somethin' (brrt, oh really?)

I'm scared of fuckin' cops (cops)
Actin' like he savage, but he scared, he duck his opps (scared, he duck his opps, pussy)
All I hear is talkin', never hear no fuckin' shots (no, no)
He try me, he gon' hear mops (boom, boom)
If he smart, he duck his top (fool, fah, fah, fah, fah, fah)
Shit, let's fast-forward to 2012 (shit, let's go)
No home invasion, bitch, I'm robbin', nigga, fuck a scale (facts)
Big-ass gun make a pussy nigga tuck his tail (truse story)
Let you bust your plays all day then take it, hold this fuckin' L (hold this fuckin' L, pussy)
Who is these niggas? Never heard of 'em (never heard of 'em, never, no)
Went down for robbin', shot at my victim 
I'm just glad I ain't go down for murder (boom, boom-boom-boom-boom, murder
Had gunpowder on my hands, can't say I ain't shoot that burner (true story)
Almost threw my life away, I thought I learned somethin' (hahaha)

Let me take it back to 2009 (2009, yeah)
I was hittin' houses but they knew not to hit mine (fools)
Had a .38 but playin' off, our bullets flyin' (bullets flyin')
'Fore you think 'bout tryin', think 'bout dyin'
I ain't cappin', ask my mom (oh really? True story)
Even though she took my gun, I bought another one (bought another one, boom-boom, boom)
Upgraded to that Trey 57, damn, I'm troublesome (you think I'm playin'? Troublesome)
Look at me, ain't hard to see, you play, I'm slumpin' some' (true story, boom, boom-boom-boom)
My ice, ain't tuckin' none (fool), bitch, I'm chuckin' somethin' (brrt)
