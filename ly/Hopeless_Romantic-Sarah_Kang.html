		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I was young, I told myself when
I grow up, I won't be jaded like them
I'd travel the world, do whatever I can
To live out my days beyond paper and pen
But even the most naive would agree
That nothing is just as it seemed to be
And maybe a dream's nothing more than a dream
If it can't get you what you need

I wish I could be a hopeless romantic again
I wish I could live like I don't even have to pretend
That I didn't already picture the end even before it ever began
Sometimes, I find myself trying to feel like a hopeless romantic again
So I'll play pretend

When I was young, I told myself when
I grow up, I'll fall in love with a man
Who knew I would have my heart broken instead
When he said he thinks we're better as friends
But even the greatest of cynics would admit
They hold onto hope just a tiny bit
And since I met you, I've been in disbelief
That someone like you could love someone like me

I wish I could be a hopeless romantic again
I wish I could love like I don't even have to pretend
That I didn't already picture the end even before we ever began
But when I'm with you, you make feel like a hopeless romantic again
So I'll take your hand

I wish I could be a hopeless romantic again
I wish I could love like I don't even have to pretend
That I don't even like you as much as I said, so it'll hurt less when it ends
But when I'm with you, you make me feel like a hopeless romantic again
So I'll take your hand
