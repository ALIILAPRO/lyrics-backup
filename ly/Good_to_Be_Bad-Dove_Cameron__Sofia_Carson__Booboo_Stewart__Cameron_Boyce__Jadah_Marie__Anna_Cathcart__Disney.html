		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  From the North to the South
From the East to the West
Lost boys, lost girls
You all know you're the best
Hit the streets, it's your day
Turn it up, now's your chance
It's time to get up on your feet and dance
Woo

Anybody wanna be like us?
Everybody wanna be like us
Hey
All the boys from Auradon
And the girls 'cause they know what's up
Huh
Your life could change today
Your life could change today
These streets named after us
Because we paved the way (c'mon)

Everyone come and take your shot
Now's the time, show 'em what you got (ah)
'Cause everyone is gonna get their chance
They said that being from the Isle was bad

Well, it's good to be bad
And we're proof of that
Used to be lost, now we're on the map
Used to steal stacks, now we're giving back
Remember that
(It's good to be) bad
If you got pride
Raise your V's up high
Wave 'em wide, side to side
Feel the vibe
It's good to be bad

I wanna see you all rep your block
I wanna see you all rep your block
Hey
Show your pride, let me hear ya shout
We're from the Isle of the Lost (yes)
We're here to celebrate
We're here to elevate
If you're down, then make your move
But you best not hesitate
Come on

Today's the day that you won't forget
The best to come ain't happened yet (ah)
Take a bow, it won't be your last
You're from the Isle if anybody asks (woo)

It's good to be bad
And we're proof of that
Used to be lost, now we're on the map
Used to steal stacks, now we're giving back
Remember that
(It's good to be)
Bad
If you got pride
Raise your V's up high
Wave 'em wide, side to side
Feel the vibe
It's good to be bad

They can try to deny our style
But we were born this way
'Cause you can take the VK outta the Isle
But you can't take the Isle out the VK
If you wanna make it hype, not a moment to waste
Make it loud, make it live, make it jump to the bass
Make it what you want, but you'd better make your case
'Cause the Isle makes us and we're reppin' this place

So when I say "V", you say "K"
V-K,-V-K
When I say "all", you say "day"
All day, all day
When I say "V", you say "K"
V-K,-V-K
When I say "all", you say "day"
All day

Come on
Hey
(It's good to be) bad

(Ah, ah, ooh)
It's good to be bad
And we're proof of that
Used to be lost, now we're on the map
Used to steal stacks, now we're giving back
Remember that
(It's good to be) bad
If you got pride
Raise your V's up high
Wave 'em wide, side to side
Feel the vibe
It's good to be, bad
