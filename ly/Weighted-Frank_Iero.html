		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If we wait, it may be too late
We'll make everybody cry, we wouldn't even have to try
If we stay, we may overstay
Our allotted time and it just wouldn't feel right

But I only speak the truth
And I'll always bleed for you

So let's laugh, let's laugh
Let's learn to laugh at ourselves again
And let's love, let's love
Let's hate what our love makes us do

If I try, I may have to try
My entire life and that just doesn't sit right
But if I fall flat on my face,
Then may my bones break under my own weight

But I only want the truth,
And that's the one thing you can't do

So let's laugh, let's laugh
Let's learn to laugh at ourselves again
And let's love, let's love
Let's hate what our love makes us do

Sometimes though the world goes round,
Somethings just don't change
Sometimes it leaves me feeling old
Sometimes though the world goes round,
Somethings just don't change
Sometimes it leaves me feeling old

If we wait, it may be too late
We'll make everybody cry, we wouldn't even have to try
I understand why you couldn't stand
Another day standing in your own way

So let's laugh, let's laugh
Let's learn to laugh at ourselves again
And let's love, let's love
Let's hate what our love makes us do

So let's laugh, let's laugh
Let's learn to laugh at ourselves again
And let's love, let's love
Let's hate what our love makes us do
Let's hate what our love makes us do
I love what my hate makes me do
