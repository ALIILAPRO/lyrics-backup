		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When the sun goes down on my side of town
That lonesome feeling comes to my door
And the whole world turns blue
And there's a rundown bar across the railroad tracks
I got a table for two, way in the back
Where I sit alone and I think of losing you

I spend most every night
Beneath the light of a neon moon
If you lose your one and only
There's always room here for the lonely
To watch your broken dreams dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon

I think of two young lovers running wild and free
I close my eyes and sometimes see
You in the shadows of that smoke-filled room
No telling how many tears I've sat here and cried
Or how many lies that I've lied
Telling my poor heart
He'll come back someday

Oh, but I'll be alright as long as there's light from a neon moon
Oh, if you lose your one and only
There's always room here for the lonely
To watch your broken dreams dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon

The jukebox plays on drink by drink
And the words to every sad song seem to say what I think
And this pain inside of me
It ain't never gonna end
Oh, but I'll be alright
As long as there's light
From a neon moon

Oh, if you lose your one and only
There's always room here for the lonely
To watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams of a neon moon
Oh, if you lose your one and only
There's always room here for the lonely
To watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams of a neon moon

Oh, if you lose your one and only
There's always room here for the lonely
To watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams of a neon moon
