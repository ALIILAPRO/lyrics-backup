		<p>
		  Yes may I help you?

Hello I had a twelve o'clock appointment with Dr. Dre 
(I know and I've been here damn near and hour)
Well Dr. Dre is with another patient right now
Would you like to reschedule?
Reschedule, um, it must be a mistake
I must see him I had a twelve o'clock appointment
No, it's no mistake
Look Dr. Dre is with another patient either you can wait or reschedule
Look I understand all of that but-
No, apparently you don't understand
You know I'm a working person and
And I'm working too
Just where is Dr. Dre, I need to see him
Well open up the door and you'll see his big dick fuckin' somebody

You like that? (What's that sound?)
(I won't play the fool, oh, whoa, whoa, yeah)
You like that?
Yes, yes, uh, oh
You like that? Ah
(When I don't belong to you, whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah) Uh, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ooh, ah, ah (uhh)
(Why can't I let you go? Oh, whoa, whoa, yeah) Uh (uh)
Give it to me
I'ma give it to you (gimme)
I'ma give it to you, uh (oh, oh, hah)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh, ooh (uh, uh)
(I won't let you go, oh, whoa, whoa, yeah)
Ah, ah (ah, ah)
Damn you're good
