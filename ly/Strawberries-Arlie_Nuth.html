		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  Girl I need you here to talk to me
Cause baby I love the way you talk
It's up to you, it's up to me
I will love you just the way you are
(What about you?)
I got my strawberries (That's it)
And I was wondering (Can we)
Can we be each other's company? (can we?)
Can you ever do the following? (love me)
Because I think I got anxiety (I think)
I need you here right in front of me (I need)
If you can do it then just follow me (love me)
Baby I wanna give you all of me (of me)
Baby I wanna give you all I have to give
I know you'll never want to leave
I swear you'll never be alone
You never have to be
Can we be each other's company? (Can we)
I need you here right in front of me (I need)
If you can do it then just follow me (Love me)
Baby I wanna give you all of me (Of me)
I'm waiting for your answer now (I'm waiting for it)
Don't rush, tell me what you think (no don't rush)
I'm sorry I know I let you down (I'm sorry)
But you can tell me what you wanna drink
(You can tell me)
No pressure oh baby calm down
Yea maybe right here or maybe not now
But finally we'll be together one day
I think we can talk to each other right now
Do you remember I said I love you
It was December I really loved you
I got a question I would never judge you
Oh no
I got my strawberries (That's it)
And I was wondering (Can we)
Can we be each other's company? (can we?)
Can you ever do the following? (love me)
Because I think I got anxiety (I think)
I need you here right in front of me (I need)
If you can do it then just follow me (love me)
Baby I wanna give you all of me (of me)
Baby I wanna give you all I have to give
I know you'll never want to leave
I swear you'll never be alone
You never have to be
Can we be each other's company? (Can we)
I need you here right in front of me (I need)
If you can do it then just follow me (Love me)
Baby I wanna give you all of me (Of me)
I got my strawberries
Can we be each other's company?
Because I think I got anxiety
If you can do it then just follow me
Baby I wanna give you all of me
