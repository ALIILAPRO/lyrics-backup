		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You fell away, what more can I say? 
The feelings evolved, I won't let it out
I can't replace your screaming face
Feeling the sickness inside

[Chorus]
Why won't you die?
Your blood in mine
We'll be fine
Then your body will be mine

So many words can't describe my face
This feelings evolved, so soon to break out
I can't relate to a happy state
Feeling the blood run inside

Chorus
Why is everything so fucking hard for me?
Keep me down to what you think I should be
Must you tempt me and provoke the ministry?
Keep on trying I'm not dying so easily

(I will not die) 3x
Why is everythins so fucking hard for me? 2x

Chorus2x
