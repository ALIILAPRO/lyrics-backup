		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fade away
Another day just goes to waste
I can't explain why I feel this way
My heart begins to race
From the wave of fear that's rushing
Through my veins
Anxiety remains
I wake up, stuck
Paralyzed
Every single day goes by
Hoping it gets better than this
All that's left is pain inside
Thinking that I'm not alright
Wishing to be better than this
I can't breathe
Stuck inside a bad dream
Cycles never ending
Begging for more
From this life
To get away from this vice
Of taking pills to feel right
I'm worse than before
I'm begging for more
I'm worse than before
Worse than before
I wake up, stuck
Paralyzed
Every single day goes by
Hoping it gets better than this
All that's left is pain inside
Thinking that I'm not alright
Wishing to be better than this
The clock just ticks away
More and more as time just slips away
Everyday I'm digging my own grave
I wake up, stuck
Paralyzed
Every single day goes by
Hoping it gets better
All that's left is pain inside
Thinking that I'm not alright
Wishing to be better
I wake up, stuck
Paralyzed
Every single day goes by
Hoping it gets better
All that's left is pain inside
Thinking that I'm not alright
Wishing to be better
Wishing to be better
