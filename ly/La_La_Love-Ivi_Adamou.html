		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lala lalalalalala lalalalala love
Lala lalalalalala lalalalala love

Love the way you fill me up with life
Baby we can break the speed of light
Nothing to fear when you are near
Just gimme more.

Reaching for the sky, I'm aiming high
Close my eyes and then it's almost like you fly
Up in the air, let's take it there
Never let go.

Oh oh oh, I feel the energy between you and me, baby it's so right
Oh oh oh, I feel the energy just taking over me, over me.

How I've been waiting for this
Lala lalalalalala lalalalala love
Oh I've been waiting for this
Lala lalalalalala lalalalala love

From Paris to LA over the night
All around the world just you and I
Nothing to fear, when you are near
We're on a roll

And we do it again, no stop no end
Out of control

Oh oh oh, I feel the energy between you and me, baby it's so right
Oh oh oh, I feel the energy just taking over me, over me

How I've been waiting for this
Lala lalalalalala lalalalala love
Oh I've been waiting for this
Lala lalalalalala lalalalala love

Nothing to fear, when you are near

Oh oh oh, I feel the energy between you and me, baby it's so right
Oh oh oh, I feel the energy just taking over me, over me.

How I've been waiting for this
Lala lalalalalala lalalalala love

Lala lalalalalala lalalalala love.
Oh, I've been waiting for this
Lala lalalalalala lalalalala love.
