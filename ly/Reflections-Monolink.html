		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everything I see is a reflection of my ego
Everything I hear is an illusion in my head
In a forest of realities I'm alone inside my tree house
If that is who I am then who am I to judge?

Come away

There's a room I started building on the day the light came crashing
Every corner holds a truth but they can never be connecting
Childhood is a cup already empty once you taste it
When the future is unwritten there's a lifetime left to waste it

Come away

All I am is a wave
Crashing over matter into space
All I am is a wave
Waiting on the day for me to break

All I am is a wave
Crashing over matter into space
All I am is a wave
Waiting on the day I finally break.
