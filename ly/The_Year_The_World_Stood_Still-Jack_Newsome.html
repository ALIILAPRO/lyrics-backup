		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don’t wanna hear about all
The time you have to fill
Lucky you, you don’t remember
The year the world stood still

People dressed in diamond rings and
Those who know GoodWill
Those with Gods and those without em
The healthy and ill

We grew apart six-feet between us
Boy if looks could kill
I swear I shoulda gone to prison
The year the world stood still

Ahhh
When you’re waving your goodbyes
Ahhh
Underneath the bluest skies
Oh-Ahhh
No you don’t know what it’s like
Wasting time

Not your fault, you don’t remember
The year the world stood still

Sister Bailey up in Boston
She always gets so sick
I was making plans to see her
But couldn’t make the trip

When I’m feeling lost sometimes
I’ll call her up and we’ll
Talk about the good, the bad, and 
The year the world stood still 

Ahhh
When you’re waving your goodbyes
Ahhh
Underneath the bluest skies
Oh-Ahhh
No you don’t know what it’s like
Wasting time

See the kids in paradise,
Seeking out their thrill?
Lucky them, they don’t remember 
The year the world stood still
