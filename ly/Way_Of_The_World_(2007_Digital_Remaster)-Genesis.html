		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you take the tears from crying eyes
Will the hurt just disappear
Put a weapon in the hand of a frightened man
Will he show no fear
So we stand and we watch while the city lights go out one by one
Mother Nature sits on the other side with a loaded gun

Why is there blue sky
Why is there red sky
Now's the time to ask the reason
Should the blue sky
Meet the red sky
Should the rules have to change at all
We all know whatever they say
Time is on our side
This world has been here before just going 'round and 'round and 'round

We all agree as far as we can see
It's just the way of the world
That's how it's meant to be
There's right and there's wrong
There's weak and there's strong
It's just the way of the world
And that's how it's meant to be

Take the motion from a spinning wheel and watch it stop
Take the danger out of a naked flame and what have you got
If you take the anger out of a broken heart, you feel no pain
Could you swear if you had that second chance you wouldn't do it again

Why is there blue sky
Why is there red sky
Now's the time to ask the reason
Should the blue sky
Meet the red sky
Should the rules have to change at all
We all know whatever they say
Time is on our side
This world has been here before just going 'round and 'round and 'round

We all agree as far as we can see
It's just the way of the world
That's how it's meant to be
There's right and there's wrong
There's weak and there's strong
It's just the way of the world
And that's how it's meant to be
