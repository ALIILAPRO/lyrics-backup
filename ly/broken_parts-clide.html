		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There was no conversation
We never shared our doubts
Way too much love that we have wasted
Guess we were running out
But I still got your bracelet
I found it on the couch
I was supposed to give it back, but never made it
'Cause I know that he's around

I've tried to play it cool
But, damn, I'm missing you

What if I had told you baby I am sorry
Would you still be wearing my shirt every morning
Or were the broken parts, waiting in the dark
I guess we'll never know it
I guess we'll never know it
Ooh, ooh

We fell in love so easy
But we just messed it up
Now all I do is face the fact that you don't need me
And I'm, not there to wake you up

I've tried to play it cool
But, damn, I'm missing you

What if I had told you baby I am sorry
Would you still be wearing my shirt every morning
Or were the broken parts, waiting in the dark
I guess we'll never know it
I guess we'll never know
What if I had told you baby I am sorry
Would you still be wearing my shirt every morning
Or were the broken parts, waiting in the dark
I guess we'll never know it
I guess we'll never know it

Ooh, ooh, ooh
I guess we'll never know it, yeah

What if I had told you baby I am sorry
Would you still be wearing my shirt every morning
Or were the broken parts, waiting in the dark

I guess we'll never know it
I guess we'll never know it
