		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Boys seem to like the girls who laugh at anything
The ones who get undressed before the second date
Girls seem to like the boys who don't appreciate
All the money and the time that it takes
To be fly as a mother
Got my both eyes out for Mr. Right
Guessing now I just don't know where to find them
But I hope they all come out tonight

Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away
I'm a good, good girl who needs a little company
Looking high and low, someone let me know
Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away

Boys seem to like the girls who like to kiss and tell
Talking them up about things that do so well
I'd rather find a boy who is down for the chase
Putting in the time that it takes
To be fly as a mother
To supply all of my heart's demands
Suit and tie 'cause undercover
He's gonna save my life like Superman

Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away
I'm a good, good girl who needs a little company
Looking high and low, someone let me know
Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away
Tell me where the good boys go
Tell me where the good boys go
Tell me where the good boys go
Will somebody tell me, tell me
Tell me where the good boys go
Tell me where the good boys go
Tell me where the good boys go
Tell me where the good boys go

Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away
I'm a good, good girl who needs a little company
Looking high and low, someone let me know
Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away
Hide away, hide away
Hide away, hide away
Looking high and low, someone let me know
Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away
