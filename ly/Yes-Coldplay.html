		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When it started we had high hopes
Now my back's on the line
My back's on the ropes
When it started we were alright
But night makes a fool of us in daylight

Yeah we were dying of frustration
Saying "Lord lead me not into temptation"
But it's not easy when she turns you on
Since they gone

If you'll only, if you'd only say yes
Whether you will's anybody's guess
God only, God knows I'm trying my best
But I'm just so tired of this loneliness

So, up they picked me by the big toe
I was held from the rooftop, then they let go
There's only screaming
Let the windows, down
As I crawl to the ground

If you'll only, if you'd only say yes
Whether you will's anybody's guess
God, only God knows she won't let me rest
But I'm just so tired of this loneliness
I've become so tired of this loneliness.
