		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You can do better
Move different move wherever
Freedoms the meta
Dance different do whatever
Stand on a table
Do yo lil dance
Dap up a brother
Love is forever
And we got each other
Thank god above us
Lucid
I'm dreaming
Fly high
Korean
Move different
I'm saying
But I'm Mostly
Entertaining
You know that I want it
You know that I got it
Had no money in my pocket
Cuz mo money mo problems
I still got problems
But no money no nobody cares
About you
Still on my grind ain't no quitting
Put in the work but nobody cares
That's how it goes
I know
Suffer in silence
I'm all alone-o
To Deal with my lows
I was the kid playing the piano-o
BUKO too woke
In love with the pain had a lot of it
And lately I've dealt with my past
I conquered my mountain I climbed to the top of it
I'll sweep up the game
I'm doing it different I'm really cut out for all of this shit
I'll do it legit
If I'm sad
I'd rather be sad in a cessna jet
Let him cook
Turn this shit up to 11 man
Can't fuck with none of these simpletons
More rpm than a Mercedes Benz
I'm on the top but I still ain't got friends
What do you know
Can't tell if you friend or a foe
I'm dripping I'll slide on the low
Ignore but give me the word I'll come over
Downin the bottle
Downin the bottle now I'm feeling risky
Decide to reach out and she say she ain't busy
So where the fuck are my car keys?
I know
I know that I shouldn't go
I know I should hang up the phone
They say I shouldn't drive alone
I know
Yeah I'm in the know
But What y'all gonna do
I wanted this shit
So I'm chasing this shit
I got something to prove
Bitch
I know
What I wanna do
Don't care bout nobody else
The only thing that even matters right now is that I believe in myself
I know
BUKO too woke yuh
Wouldn't wanna start over
You can be a bit Difficult
But Swear to god you'll do it different kid
I know
I'm in the know yuh
Show her the world lmma chauffeur
Freddy loafers we comfortable
I'll carry the world on my shoulders
I know
One more sip got me goin
Gripping the bottle
I'm throwing it down
Feel the liquor it's flowing
I'm so
Fucked up it is what it is
Bend that bitch over still give her the biz
Don't even know who this is
End of the night she still swallow my kids yuh
I've had enough of this shit uh
Small dose Epinephrine
Can't get enough of it
Never accepted it
My life incredulous
I'm just the messenger
I know
I know
I'm never drinking again
But next wake I wake up then I'm out drinking with friends
Oh no
I gotta go
Shouldn't have came out hungover
But what am I supposed to say to
I got tequila come over
I know
I got no self control
Battling my demony
I've done some things Unforgivable
I know
I know
I know where I wanna go
Need to Change up my lifestyle
To get to my end goals
I know
