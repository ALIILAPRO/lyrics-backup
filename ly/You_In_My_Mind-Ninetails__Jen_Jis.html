		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Every time you come around
We just go in circles
We can’t stop us falling down
And tripping over hurdles

When I’m all alone
I get too personal
Make up scenarios
Where we said all we shoulda said
I don’t know
Where it’s gonna go
All this back and forth
Got me hallucinating

It’s always you in my mind
You in my mind
It’s always you in my mind
I try to fight it but it’s
You in my mind
All of the time
it’s only you in my mind
I try to fight it but it’s

Hard to let go of your hand
When I don’t wanna lose you
Like handing over contraband
Of a high that I got used to

When I’m all alone
I get too personal
Make up scenarios
Where we said all we shoulda said
I don’t know
Where it’s gonna go
All this back and forth
Got me hallucinating

It’s always you in my mind
You in my mind
It’s always you in my mind
I try to fight it but it’s
You in my mind
All of the time
it’s only you in my mind
I try to fight it but it’s
Every time you come around
We just go in circles
We can’t stop us falling down
And tripping over hurdles

When I’m all alone
I get too personal
Make up scenarios
Where we said all we shoulda said
I don’t know
Where it’s gonna go
All this back and forth
Got me hallucinating

It’s always you in my mind
You in my mind
It’s always you in my mind
I try to fight it but it’s
You in my mind
All of the time
it’s only you in my mind
I try to fight it but it’s

Hard to let go of your hand
When I don’t wanna lose you
Like handing over contraband
Of a high that I got used to

When I’m all alone
I get too personal
Make up scenarios
Where we said all we shoulda said
I don’t know
Where it’s gonna go
All this back and forth
Got me hallucinating

It’s always you in my mind
You in my mind
It’s always you in my mind
I try to fight it but it’s
You in my mind
All of the time
it’s only you in my mind
I try to fight it but it’s
