		  I get the money

Bella mooooon (yea)
Say I ain't a bad bitch, bitch you know you capping (big cap)
If he lost me than that boy is surely lacking
Got that wagon in the back got your boo up on my hip (big booty)
See me outside than you trip, you dip (oop)
Throw that casa back i don't even need No chaser (oh no)
We ain't chasing shit less you talm bout the paper
Pull up to the function and it's flooded w them' gangsters
380's 10 rounds on me just keep safer
You really want me (you really want me)
You thinking bout me (you thinking bout me)

No doubt about it (for sho)
He think he love me (do)
Anything for it (uh oh)
He feigning for it (uh huh)
He like em'' foreign (ou)

He like them' county girls I said I like the cabbage
Baddies from the south point em'' out there's sumn bout us (where they at tho?)
Gave da cookie once got him hooked call me captain (yum yum)
Your ex a joke when I see her I just can't stop laughing (haha)
Eating up the cake know I got 'em' feeling great
Pussy so good make 'em' wanna attack the day (uh oh)
Loving my aroma feigning said he love my aura (ouu wee)
Keep me spoiled give it to me i need it Ahora (yea)
You really want me (you really want me)
You thinking bout me (you thinking bout me)

I got this one guy ready to just risk it all
He love some BM he ain't talking bout his baby mama
He buys me Prada when he's proud of me yall hoes get nada
Chokehold cause my foot be steady on they necks (stepping)
He flexing hard like uncles dripping in they sunday best
