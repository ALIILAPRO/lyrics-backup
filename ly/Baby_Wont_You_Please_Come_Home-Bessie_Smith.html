		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've got the blues, I feel so lonely
I'll give the world if I could only
Make you understand
It surely would be grand

I'm gonna telephone my baby
Ask him won't you please come home
'Cause when you're gone
I'm worried all day long

Baby won't you please come home
Baby won't you please come home
I have tried in vain
Evermore to call your name

When you left you broke my heart
That will never make us part
Every hour in tthe day
You will hear me say

Baby won't you please come home, I mean
Baby won't you please come home

Baby won't you please come home
'Cause your mama's all alone
I have tried in vain
Nevermore to call your name

When you left you broke my heart
That will never make us part
Landlord gettin' worse
I've got to move May the first

Baby won't you please come home, I need money
Baby won't you please come home
