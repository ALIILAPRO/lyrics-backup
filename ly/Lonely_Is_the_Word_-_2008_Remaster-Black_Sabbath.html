		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's a long way to nowhere
And I'm leaving very soon
On the way we pass so close
To the back side of the moon
Hey join the traveler if you got nowhere to go
Hang your head and take my hand
It's the only road I know
Oh, lonely is the word, yeah yeah yeah

I've been higher than stardust
I've been seen upon the sun
I used to count in millions then
But now I only count in one
Come on, join the traveler
If you got nowhere to go
Hang your head and take my hand
It's the only road I know
Yeah, lonely is the word
Got to be the saddest song I ever heard

Yeah, lonely is the name
Maybe life's a losing game
