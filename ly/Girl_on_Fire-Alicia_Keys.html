		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She's just a girl, and she's on fire
Hotter than a fantasy, lonely like a highway
She's living in a world and it's on fire
Filled with catastrophe but she knows she can fly away

Ooh-oh, she got both feet on the ground
And she's burning it down
Ooh-oh, she got her head in the clouds
And she's not backing down

This girl is on fire
This girl is on fire
She's walking on fire
This girl is on fire

Looks like a girl but she's a flame
So bright, she can burn your eyes
Better look the other way
You can try but you'll never forget her name
She's on top of the world
Hottest of the hottest girls say

Ooh-oh, we got our feet on the ground
And we're burning it down
Ooh-oh, got our head in the clouds
And we're not coming down

This girl is on fire (fire, fire)
This girl is on fire
She's walking on fire (fire, fire)
This girl is on fire (ooh)

Everybody stares as she goes by
'Cause they can see the flame that's in her eyes
Watch her as she's lighting up the night
Nobody knows that she's a lonely girl
And it's a lonely world
But she gon' let it burn, baby, burn, baby

This girl is on fire (fire, fire)
This girl is on fire
She's walking on fire (fire, fire)
This girl is on fire

Ooh-oh, ooh-oh, ooh-oh
Ooh-oh, ooh-oh, ooh, ooh-oh
Ooh-oh, ooh-oh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-oh, ooh-oh, ooh, oh

She's just a girl but she's on fire
