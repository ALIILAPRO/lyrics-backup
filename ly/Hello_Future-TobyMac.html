		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hello sunshine, goodbye rain
Hello promise, I hope you're here to stay
Ain't nothin' sweeter than welcomin' new mercy every day
Hello sunshine, sure glad you came
Sure glad you came

Well, hello future
Goodbye yesterday
Your grass is greener
Than anywhere I've lived
You turn these troubled eyes
To watchin' all my troubles wash away
Hello, future (hey)
We gon' be okay

We gon' be okay

We gon' be okay

(Troubles, troubles, troubles, troubles, troubles, troubles, troubles)

Hello purpose, you've alluded me
I thought I'd find you 
In victory 
I scaled the mountain (Hey) 
Just to find nobody beside me
Hello purpose (Hey)
Don't leave me be

Don't leave me be
Don't leave me be
Oh, don't leave me be

Don't leave me be

Hello Jesus
I hope You understand
My last departure was never planned
I came up empty with everyone and everywhere I've been
Hello Jesus
I'm home again
I'm home again
