		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I took a little loving from you
Oh I, never thought about the hurting inside
But I took a little more than I should
Oh why, can't explain that I would ever
Let you slip through my fingers
Let you escape like yesterday
I would appreciate you knowing
I thought your love had come to stay

Talking out of turn
Shot to pieces
When will I learn
Talking out of turn
Shot to pieces
When will I learn

But I took a little more of you each day
When I didn't see that I was breaking you apart
With angry words of love I didn't mean
Oh why, can't believe that I would ever
Talk myself out of tomorrow
Talked like a fool to yesterday
And as the evening loses colour
Your love began to fade away

Talking out of turn
Shot to pieces
When will I learn
Talking out of turn
Shot to pieces
When will I learn

Talking out of turn
Talking out of turn

If I upset you
I didn't mean to hurt you
I didn't mean to make you cry
I don't need an alibi
To start me talking out of turn

When I took a little loving from you
Oh I, can't believe that I would ever
Let you slip through my fingers
Let you escape like yesterday
I would appreciate you knowing
I thought your love had come to stay

Talking out of turn
Shot to pieces
When will I learn
Talking out of turn
Shot to pieces
When will I learn
