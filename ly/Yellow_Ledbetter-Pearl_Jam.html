		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Unsealed
On a porch a letter sat
Then you said I want to leave it again

Once I saw him
On a beach of weathered sand
And on the sand I want to leave it again

On a weekend want to wish it all away
And they called and I said that I want what I said
And then I call out again

And the reason oughta leave her calm, I know
I said, I don't know whether I'm the boxer or the bag

Oh yeah, can you see them?
Out on the porch
Ah, but they don't wave
I see them
'Round the front way, yeah
And I know and I know
I don't want to stay

Make me cry

I see
Oh, I don't know, there's something else
I want to drum it all away
And I said
"I don't, I don't know whether I was the boxer or the bag"

Oh yeah, can you see them?
Out on the porch
Yeah, but they don't wave
I see them
'Round the front way, yeah
And I know and I know
I don't want to stay at all
I don't want to stay
I don't want to stay
I don't want to stay
I don't, oh-ooh, yeah

Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-oh oh oh
