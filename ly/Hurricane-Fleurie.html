		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can feel your heart hanging in the air
I'm counting every step as you climb the stairs
It's buried in your bones
I see it in your closed eyes turning in
This is harder than we know
We hold it in the most when we're wearing thin

Comin' like a hurricane, I take it in real slow
The world is spinning like a weather vane
Fragile and composed
Though I am breaking down again
I am aching now to let you in

Seven times it came when you were not awake
Seven times the flame, too much to take
The sky burns red against your skin
The world we know turns in the wind

Comin' like a hurricane, I take it in real slow
The world is spinning like a weather vane
Fragile and composed
Though I am breaking down again
I am aching now to let you in

It's all we know, all we know, the hurricane
Falling slow, falling slow in the pouring rain
It's all we know, all we know, the hurricane
Falling slow, falling slow in the pouring rain
Watch it go, watch it go, we stay the same
And I don't know, I don't know how it can change
Watch it go, watch it go, we stay the same
And I don't know, I don't know how it can change

And I don't know, I don't know how it can change
It's all we know, all we know, the hurricane
