		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Oh my God, oh my God)
(Oh my God, oh my God)

So this kind of story
I don't wanna say too much
A real vivid memory
Of telling you with every touch

Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop for a minute
Let go, let go, let go 'cause I'm in it now
I'm down for no sleep
So come and give me all that lush

Don't you go and
Waste time fighting the rhythm
This time all is forgiven
Be my sin for the evening now

I'm busy trying to forget you
I'm really trying to regret you
But every night I get reminded of what I've not got
You make my body your religion
And now I'm praying that you keep your faith 'cause I
Oh my God, oh my God

You give me your 
Oh my God, oh my God
You give me your
Oh my God, oh my God

So this kind of story
I don't wanna say too much (you better)
A real vivid memory
Of telling you with every touch

Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop for a minute
Let go, let go, let go 'cause I'm in it now
I'm down for no sleep
So come and give me all that lush

Don't you go and 
Waste time fighting the rhythm
This time all is forgiven
Be my sin for the evening now

I'm busy trying to forget you
I'm really trying to regret you
But every night I get reminded of what I've not got
You make my body your religion
And now I'm praying that you keep your faith 'cause I
Oh my God, oh my God

You give me your 
Oh my God, oh my God
You give me your
Oh my God, oh my God

Don't you go and 
Waste time fighting the rhythm
This time all is forgiven
Be my sin for the evening now

You give me your 
Oh my God, oh my God
You give me your
Oh my God, oh my God

You give me your 
Oh my God, oh my God
You give me your
Oh my God, oh my God
