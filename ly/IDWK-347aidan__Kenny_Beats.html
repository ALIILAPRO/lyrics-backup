		  (I don't wanna know, yeah)
(Woah, Kenny!)

Baby, please don't tell me that, I don't wanna know
Just get out of my house and give me back my clothes
I've been maskin' all my feelings while I'm inhalin' this smoke
So just give me some space 'cause I'd rather be alone, yeah
Baby, please don't tell me that, I don't wanna know
Just get out of my house and give me back my clothes
I've been maskin' all my feelings while I'm inhaling this smoke
So just give me some space 'cause I'd rather be alone, yeah

Alkaline and dopamine
Baby, you so gold to me
Look, we made it globally
Find peace inside the poetry
Conscious thoughts and wasted words
Empty skies, not a single bird
Rumors of those things you heard
And them conversations, they be getting stirred
I got houses filled with enemies
I let them all be friends with me
Ahead of them, can't get to me
Just watching all discrepancies
Used to flex on me with your better fits
And now I'm onto these better things
Might buy my mom a residence
I use music as my medicine, yeah

Baby, please don't tell me that, I don't wanna know
Just get out of my house and give me back my clothes
I've been maskin' all my feelings while I'm inhalin' this smoke
So just give me some space 'cause I'd rather be alone, yeah
Baby, please don't tell me that, I don't wanna know
Just get out of my house and give me back my clothes
I've been maskin' all my feelings while I'm inhaling this smoke
So just give me some space 'cause I'd rather be alone, yeah

'Cause I'd rather be alone, yeah
I don't wanna know, yeah
'Cause I'd rather be alone, yeah
