		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (I can see you) comin' back for more
Comin' back for more, ayy
If you walk out that door

When I'm with you, it all feels different
When I'm with you, it all makes sense
And I know you don't feel no different
(Whoa-ooh)
There's a magic to how we livin'
There's a magic to what this is
It's like a dream and we both day-trippin'
(Whoa-ooh)

All I know is if you walk away
There'll be something
There'll be things you can't replace
All I know is if you walk away
There'll be something
(Baby, that's okay, 'cause)

I can see you comin' back for more
Comin' back for more (yeah)
If you walk out that door
I can see you comin' back for more (can you?)
Comin' back for more (eh)
If you walk out that door

When I'm with you, it all feels different
There's no logic to what we say
But we talk and talk the night away, oh
We don't got none of the issues that people got
Keep it on some of the same waves we keepin' on
None of that stuff to make you dependent on, oh

All I know is if you walk away
There'll be something
(Baby, that's okay, 'cause)

I can see you comin' back for more
Comin' back for more (eh)
If you walk out that door
I can see you comin' back for more (can you?)
Comin' back for more (uh)
If you walk out that door

When I'm with you, it all feels different
When I'm with you, when I'm with you (no)
I can see you comin' back for more
Comin' back for more
If you walk out that

(Oh-oh-oh)
Oh
Ah, ta-la-tat, ah
Whoo
Ah, ta-la-tat, ah
If you walk out that door
Hoo-hoo (ah-ooh)

When I'm with you, when I'm with you (come on)

I can see you comin' back for more (comin' back for more)
Comin' back for more (whoo-whoo)
If you walk out that door (door)
I can see you comin' back for more (can you?)
Comin' back for more (yeah)
If you walk out that
