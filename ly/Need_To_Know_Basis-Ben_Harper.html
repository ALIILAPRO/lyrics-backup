		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're the reason
Aliens would come down to Earth
Outer space must look small
From inside your universe

But your love is on a need to know basis
And I need to know right now

We paint time
With the colors of our lives
With what we do to survive

But your love is on a need to know basis
And I need to know right now

If I were the branch
Of an old oak tree
I hope you'd be the one
On the swing tied to me

But your love is on a need to know basis
Your love is on a need to know basis
I need to know right now
