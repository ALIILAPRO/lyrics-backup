		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh tell me who just had to say
That your love's nothing more than fake
You won't believe them anyway!
Just like bla bla bla


Contra, contradictory
All they say is trickery
Everything they think of me
Better not to say


Send to hell opinions
When you hold me in your arms
Pull me pull me close
And take me away


Up there in space with zero gravity
We are about to lose our sanity
Like a star I will burn
I will burn for your love
Just because I don't wanna lose this feeling


Up there in space with zero gravity
We are about to lose our sanity
Like a star I will burn
I will burn for your love
Just because I don't wanna lose this feeling


Oh tell me who just had to say
That “Love can touch just once”
It’s clear just like the light of day
Words can be so dumb!


Even if we're opposites
Know that it’s so possible
Know that it’s so possible
To get with you alone


Just forget the theory
We’ll go down in history
Know that just tonight
We won’t go home


Up there in space with zero gravity
We are about to lose our sanity
Like a star I will burn
I will burn for your love
Just because I don't wanna lose this feeling


Up there in space with zero gravity
We are about to lose our sanity
Like a star I will burn
I will burn for your love
Just because I don't wanna lose this feeling


Up there in space with zero gravity
We are about to lose our sanity
Like a star I will burn
I will burn for your love
Just because I don't wanna lose this feeling


Up there in space with zero gravity
We are about to lose our sanity
Like a star I will burn
I will burn for your love
Just because I don't wanna lose this feeling
