		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Girl just choose a side
What is it that's so difficult for you to decide?
You know it's do or die
Ooh yeah

I waited my life for this
They don't know what I would risk
Bitch, I paid the price for this
I would give my life for this
Yeah, she's down to spend the night
She's barely putting up a fight
I know this ain't right
But I'ma blame it on the life

Hop out crazy, baby my swagger dangerous
You know that paper talk for me, that is the only language
You see the team I came with, we want it all for keeps
Hoe you talkin' crazy, bitch, get off of me, ooh yeah
Mayday, mayday, man down, man down
Drop-tops roll by, they heard no sounds
They know I'm king, now where's my crown?
I held it down, yeah, I held shit down
Hop out on other shit
They know I'm wildin', I'm tuckin' it
They never touchin' a 20 g's
I flip that shit with such fucking ease
I got the game in my pocket now
Don't tell me you love me, girl, stop it now
I got the game in a rocket now
They know they never gon' stop it now
Ooh yeah

I waited my life for this
They don't know what I would risk
Bitch, I paid the price for this
I would give my life for this
Yeah, she's down to spend the night
She's barely putting up a fight
I know this ain't right
But I'ma blame it on the life

No, I'ma blame it on the ice
Fuckin' niggas bitches, that's just part of life
All I ever wanted was to make it right
All I ever wanted was to change my life, ooh yeah
Mayday, mayday, another man that's down
God flow, that's mine, bad bitch, she's mine
I risked it all, I did my time
Now let me live, God let me shine
I'm on some other shit, they wanna send me a 50 clip
I know they love me, they know I'm lit
You see me with her, you know I hit
Hoppin' out the foreign, big body
Young nigga out here and I'm gettin' rich
Runnin' it up, never trust a bitch
Niggas hating on me 'cause I'm it, like
Ooh yeah

I waited my life for this
They don't know what I would risk
Bitch, I paid the price for this
I would give my life for this
Yeah, she's down to spend the night
She's barely putting up a fight
I know this ain't right
But I'ma blame it on the life
