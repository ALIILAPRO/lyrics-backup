		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't like the drugs but the drugs like me
I don't like the drugs, the drugs, the drugs

Norm life, baby
"We're white and oh so hetero
And our sex is missionary"
Norm life, baby
"We're quitters and we're sober
Our confessions will be televised"

You and I are underdosed and we're ready to fall
We're raised to be stupid, taught to be nothing at all
We're taught to be nothing at all

I don't like the drugs but the drugs like me
I don't like the drugs, the drugs, the drugs
I don't like the drugs but the drugs like me
I don't like the drugs, the drugs, the drugs

Norm life, baby
"Our God is white and unforgiving
And we're piss tested and we're praying"
Norm life, baby
I'm just a sample of a soul
Made to look just like a human being
Norm life, baby
"We're rehabbed and we're ready
For our 15 minutes of shame"
Norm life, baby
"We're talkshown and we're pointing
Just like Christians at a suicide"

You and I are underdosed and we're ready to fall
We're raised to be stupid, taught to be nothing at all
We're taught to be nothing at all

I don't like the drugs but the drugs like me
I don't like the drugs, the drugs, the drugs
I don't like the drugs but the drugs like me
I don't like the drugs, the drugs, the drugs

"There's a hole in our soul that we fill with dope
And we're feeling fine"
"There's a hole in our soul that we fill with dope
And we're feeling fine"
"There's a hole in our soul that we fill with dope
And we're feeling fine"

I don't like the drugs but the drugs like me
I don't like the drugs, the drugs, the drugs

I don't like the drugs but the drugs like me
I don't like the drugs, the drugs, the drugs
I don't like the drugs but the drugs like me
I don't like the drugs (drugs)
I don't like the drugs but the drugs like me
I don't like the drugs (drugs)
I don't like the drugs but the drugs like me
I don't like the drugs (drugs)
I don't like the drugs but the drugs like me
I don't like the drugs (drugs)

I don't like the drugs but the drugs like me
I don't like the drugs, the drugs, the drugs
The drugs but the drugs like me
I don't like the drugs, the drugs, the drugs
I don't like the drugs but the drugs like me
I don't like the drugs, the drugs, the drugs
