		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Giddy-up old boy it's time to go
Vous les vous savoir the love below
Brother, I've got more than you can take
But more than I can do to stay awake

I close my eyes
So I
Can dream of ways to keep you occupied
So I
Can lock you up we'll keep it classified
Alright
You're mine tonight, son
When I close my eyes

I can make you sorry when I want
Find some other house for you to haunt
Carry out your sentence in my head
All I have to do is go to bed

I close my eyes
So I
Can dream of ways to keep you occupied
So I
Can lock you up we'll keep it classified
So right
You're mine tonight son, when I close my eyes

Hide and seek, yellow ducky
Feeling weak or feeling lucky son

Who's got milk, the baby's crying
Shut 'em up, get 'em flying
Little kiddies bought and sold
And papa's got a brand new bag of gold

Tonight
I'll dream of ways to keep you occupied
So I can lock you up we'll call it classified
So right
You're mine tonight love when I close my eyes
