		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell her try your best just to make it quick
Whom attend to the sick
'Cause there must be something she can do
This heart is broken in two
Tell her it's a case of emergency
There's a patient by the name of Gregory

Night nurse
Only you alone can quench this jah thirst
My night nurse, oh gosh
Oh the pain it's getting worse
I don't wanna see no doc
I need attendance from my nurse around the clock

'Cause there's no prescription for me
She's the one, the only remedy
Night nurse
Only you alone can quench this jah thirst

My night nurse
Oh the pain it's getting worse
I hurt my love
I don't wanna see no doc

I need attendance from my nurse around the clock
'Cause there's no prescription for me
She's the one, the only remedy

Night nurse
Only you alone can quench this jah thirst
My night nurse
Oh the pain it's getting worse

I hurt my love
And I'm sure no doctor can cure
Night nurse, night nurse
