		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Drifting apart, getting harder to hold you
Days getting dark and the nights are growing cold
Are we burning out?
Swept out of sight, rolling up on an ocean
Let's cut all the ropes and get lost in the moment
If our hearts are alive, maybe then they might
Send us back to the sun

Now I know, I know
We're losing light, our love is dying
Out cold on the floor
Like a fallen star that shines no more
Take, take me back to where it was before
When we were on fire, fire

Head down, heading underground feeling wasted
Cold to the bone, so alone I can taste it
Let's light it up
Streets are alive now, and everything's bracing
You're on my mind, running in my veins fueling the flame
Let's start it again

And I know, I know
We're losing light, our love is dying
Out cold on the floor
Like a fallen star that shines no more
Take, take me back to where it was before
When we were on fire, fire
We were on fire, fire

(Whoa, whoa, whoa) Now don't tell me no
Then we're burning down (Whoa, whoa, whoa)
(Whoa, whoa, whoa) And don't tell me no
Then we're burning now (Whoa, whoa, whoa)

'Cause I know, I know
We're losing light and our love is dying
Take, take me home
Back to where it was before
When we were on fire, fire
No I know, I know
We're losing light, our love is dying
Out cold on the floor
Like a fallen star that shines no more
Take, take me back to where it was before
When we were on fire, fire
We were on fire, fire.
