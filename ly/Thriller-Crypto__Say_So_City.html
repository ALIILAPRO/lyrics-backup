		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  [Verse 1]
It's close to midnight
And something evil's lurking in the dark
Under the moonlight
You see a sight that almost stops your heart

You try to scream
But terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze
As horror looks you right between the eyes
You're paralyzed

[Chorus]
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
And no one's gonna save you
From the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer
Thriller tonight

[Verse 2]
You hear the door slam
And realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand
And wonder if you'll ever see the sun

You close your eyes
And hope that this is just imagination
But all the while
You hear a creature creepinâ€™ up behind
You're out of time

[Chorus]
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
There ain't no second chance
Against the thing with forty eyes, girl
Thriller (Ooh), thriller night
You're fighting for your life
Inside a killer, thriller tonight

[Bridge]
Night creatures call
And the dead start to walk in their masquerade
There's no escaping the jaws of the alien this time
This is the end of your life

[Chorus]
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
And no one's gonna save you
From the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer
Thriller tonight
