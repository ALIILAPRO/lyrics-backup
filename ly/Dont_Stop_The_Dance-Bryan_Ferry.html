		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mama says truth is all that matters
Lying or deceiving is a sin
Drifting through a world that's torn and tattered
Every thought I had don't mean a thing

Don't stop, don't stop the dance
No, more music, don't stop the dance

Mama says love is all that matters
Beauty should be deeper than your skin
Living for the moment, lips and lashes
Will I ever find my way again?

Don't stop, don't stop the dance
No, more music, don't stop the dance

Don't stop, don't stop the dance

Mama says only stormy weather
Don't know why there's no sun in the sky
Footsteps in the dark come together
Got to keep on moving or I'll die

Don't stop, don't stop the dance
No, more music, don't stop the dance
Don't stop, don't stop the dance
No, more music, don't stop the dance
Don't stop, don't stop the dance
