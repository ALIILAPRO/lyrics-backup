What do you expect? Nigga, I was like thirteen watchin' Belly, uh (oh-whoa)
Only do penthouses and tellys (whoa, whoa-whoa)
I can't even impress you with a Bentley no more
All you talk about is Chanelly (whoa, whoa, whoa)
They wanna catch me slippin', I ain't with it though (whoa, whoa, whoa)
Gotta keep some killers in my videos (whoa-whoa)
So much money, I look suspicious, whoa (whoa, whoa)
If you got it, it ain't trickin', no

I swear shit ain't been the same lately
If you think you're crazy, I'm insane, baby
Free broski, I can't say his name, he shoot like KD
Me and Bubba and QP, we got on matchin' APs
Yeah, say my name, baby (whoa, whoa)
I'm in a Wraith not a Mulsanne, baby (whoa, whoa)
And you wanna take pictures in my chain, baby
I could hit every position, every angle's crazy

What do you expect? Nigga, I was like thirteen watchin' Belly, uh
Only do penthouses and tellys
I can't even impress you with a Bentley no more
All you talk about is Chanelly
All she wanna do is get litty, whoa (whoa, whoa)
Wanna be all in the videos, whoa, whoa
So much money, I look suspicious, whoa (whoa, whoa)
If you got it, it ain't trickin', no

Yeah, Don
She just wanna go to Chanelly and pick up items (and pick up)
Let her go and tell her, then get all her friends excited (ha)
Just pick the whole collection when you feelin' indecisive (indecisive)
I think them people on my tail, I had to switch devices (whoa)
Tryna stay under the radar, I can't risk no mistakes, nah (nah, nah)
Bulletproof truck in the city when we move through (we move through)
This lifestyle she was never introduced to (nah)
She doin' all the drugs that I use and now she used to (she is)
She ask for more and she gon' get what she want (get what she want)
I think them Adderalls got my adrenaline rush (my adrenaline rush)
Go check my catalog, I hit all the bitches that fronted, hah
Yeah, yeah

What do you expect? Nigga, I was like thirteen watchin' Belly, uh (oh-whoa)
Only do penthouses and tellys (whoa, whoa-whoa)
I can't even impress you with a Bentley no more
All you talk about is Chanelly (whoa, whoa, whoa)
They wanna catch me slippin', I ain't with it though (whoa, whoa, whoa)
Gotta keep some killers in my videos (whoa-whoa)
So much money, I look suspicious, whoa (whoa, whoa)
If you got it, it ain't trickin', no
