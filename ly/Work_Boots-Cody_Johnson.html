		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You ain't got no problem getting up with the sun
Scuffing up leather, digging in the red dirt, getting that job done
But it's Friday night and you're tapping right along with the groove
And that pretty little thing is looking at me, I'm counting on you

So come on work boots
We've got a little work to do
It looks like she wants to dance
I wouldn't wanna to miss our chance
She might be the one to change our world
But we ain't gonna get the girl sitting on a stool
We gotta make our move
So come on work boots

First step is, we'll go up and ask her her name
And then maybe these two left feet will get two-step carried away
Don't dig in your heels now, just follow my lead
It's a moment of truth and I can't have you dragging our feet

So come on work boots
We've got a little work to do
It looks like she wants to dance
I wouldn't wanna to miss our chance
She might be the one to change our world
But we ain't gonna get the girl sitting on a stool
We gotta make our move
So come on work boots

Hell this might just be our song
Get to work, boots
Who knows maybe later on
I might get to kick you off

She might be the one to change our world
But we ain't gonna get the girl sitting on a stool
We gotta make our move
So come on work boots
