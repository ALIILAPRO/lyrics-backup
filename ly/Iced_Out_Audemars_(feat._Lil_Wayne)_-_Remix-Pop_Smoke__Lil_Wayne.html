Woo

Iced out Audemars
I got forty thousand
I'm up in all the stores
Wait
Hahaha, hahaha
Look
Oh you feelin' sturdy, nigga?
Look, we 'bout to get sturdy now (baow)
We 'bout to get sturdy now (look, shake it)

Iced out Audemars (Audemars)
Got like forty more (forty more)
Walked in with forty thousand (forty thousand)
I'm up in all the stores (all the stores)
Bad bitch from Baltimore (Baltimore)
And she love Dior (Dior)
She throw a hunnid clip (clip)
When it rains it pours (rains it pours)

Shawty light and sexy (sexy)
She like givin' becky
Sexy Lexi drivin Lexus (woo)
Bad bitch gon' smack the reverend (reverend)
Spin your block like Tetris (Tetris)
Longhorn, Texas
I can't fuck no fat bitch, never (nah)
I'm young and reckless
I said I'm shootin' proper
I make 'em cha-cha
I'm a rocker, I'll boom your casa
Then do the cucaracha
I order steak with lobster
After I smoke my purple
Shots at NOBU, know I'm global
I'm on a different timin'
My VS diamonds dancin'
This ain't no SI stones
I'm smokin' Runts in Rome
Ice on my neck, I'm freezin'
If you don't suck dick I'm leavin'
Bad bitch geekin', showin' cleavage
She know she teasin'
Don't try this at home
This for the rich and famous (uh)
Highly educated, patient, off the rocks, I'm faded
All my cars updated
Only V-12 engines
All my checks is clearin', y'all just spendin'
Only drivin' German, in the Benz I'm swervin'

Iced out Audemars (Audemars, yeah yeah)
Got like forty more (forty more, yeah yeah)
Walked in with forty thousand (forty thousand, yeah yeah)
I'm up in all the stores (all the stores, yeah yeah yeah)
Bad bitch from Baltimore (Baltimore, huh whoa)
And she love Dior (Dior, yeah yeah)
She throw a hunnid clip (clip, yeah yeah)
When it rains it pours (rains it pours, yeah)

Iced out Audemars (Audemars)
White hot tartar sauce (tarter sauce)
Blacked out all my cars (yeah)
Rest in peace to Pop
We're here today, we gone tomorrow (gone tomorrow)
That's the art of war (art of war)
Too many fallen stars
And when it rains it storms (yeah)
Iced out Audemars (uh, mula)

Get rich or die gettin' rich
Wu Tang been and the cream been cream 
and the cash rules everything around me since, yeah
cream get the money, whole team get the money
Hoes dream they can fuck me, codeine got me muddy
Machine gun knocking so his spleen out his stomach
I get on one knee and make it ring like I love him
And the scene got ugly but it's beautiful baby
It's marvelous, it's pretty sunflowers and daisies
You obviously brazy
You get shot up from the knot in your head to the knot in your laces
And then skrrt skrrt three or four phones on chirp chirp
I fuck on the young nurse she hit me with the free Percs
Head so dumb make a numb niggas knee jerk
Rose so hard nigga grind 'til his teeth hurt
Count my, count my, count my snakes
Count my cake yeah momma I'm baked
Count my blessings every time that I pray
Body count raise every shot that I take
Cotton candy iced out Audemars baguette
Audemars baguette but I ain't got a time of day
Got a body on my wrist, got diamonds in the face
Audemars iced out, iced out

Iced out Audemars (Audemars)
Got like forty more (forty more, woo)
Walked in with forty thousand (forty thousand)
I'm up in all the stores (all the stores)
Bad bitch from Baltimore (Baltimore, yeah yeah)
And she love Dior (Dior, yeah yeah)
She throw a hunnid clip (clip, yeah yeah)
When it rains it pours (rains it pours, yeah)

Iced out Audemars (Audemars)
White hot tartar sauce (tarter sauce)
Iced out all the dawgs (all the dawgs)
Rest in peace to Pop
We're here today, we gone tomorrow (gone tomorrow)
That's the art of war (art of war)
Too many fallen stars (fallen stars)
New York, New Orleans boys
Iced out Audemars
