		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Me need an escape
Cause me mind nuh inna the best place
Link me dawg and get the best grades
c shot a penny make it quick please
Mommy say me nuhfi smoke away me problems
Mommy say me nuhfi drink wet me pain
Me fi find a better way and solve them

Pass me that fucking drink
Me a roll up the biggest spliff
Because depression and stress nah keep
cre you still watching?
No suck you mother Netflix
c so me gone go touch the road
Nah sit down mad and meds the rope

You mussy mad the vibes ya buck
Big song a drown the ugly thoughts so tun it up
Watch the depression cut with every cup
cnd then she back it up and then me wa fi cut
She say lay down pon you back
She say baby just relax
She give me the craziest a top
cnd she swallow every drop
She say no you nuh haffi fuck me
Cause it's all about you
cnytime me need her she ago come through

Me need an escape
Cause me mind nuh inna the best place
Tell me demons say me stop fight
Cause me nah get no rest at night
Daddy say nuh run from you problems cause life cnuh race track
Cause anytime you tired and rest
c Deh so them ago catch you up back

Weh me fucking drink
Me a roll up the biggest spliff
Daddy nun you tell me nah stick
Highway me a top inna the whip
Me gone fuck the thickest bitch
cre you still watching?
cre you still watching
Cause me nah feel nothing

The Hennessy a make me numb
Weed have me a look down on the cloud like me a the sun
Nah face no problem
Me just replace it with fun
c next dawg forward so more bottle come
Dem say dawg just relax
cnd sip the cognac
Make the erase all the problems weh you got
Him say don't worry bro
Me deh ya for you
Drink and smoke and pull up bare tune

Now me sober and relaxed
Stress coming back
Problems a kick em down
Depression a box
Mommy say me warn you say don't take that route
You fi hear youth
Daddy say me tell you stop
You nuh listen when me chat
Look how me tell you say nuh run
Now you drop down pon the track
Now every demon coming back for you
But me deh yah fi you youth
Mmm

Me need an escape
Cause me mind nuh inna the best place
Link me dawg and get the best grades
c shot a penny make it quick please
