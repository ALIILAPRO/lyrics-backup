		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  Calling us, calling out
Turning your back now

Calling us, calling out
Turning your back now

The chance, to learn
To love, to steal
We weren't meant to be free

We want, to want
We learn, to leave
We only get to be here

Calling us, calling out
Turning your back now

Calling us, calling out
Turning your back now

Trust me
We wanted to
Contact, we didn't know
Trust me
We wanted to
Come back, we didn't know

Calling us, calling out
Turning your back now

Calling us, calling out
Turning your back now

The chance, to learn
To love, to steal
We weren't meant to be free

We want, to want
We learn, to leave
We weren't meant to be here
