		  Lil' mama bad and she bad then a bitch, yeah
She got that stash in the bag, I can see it, yeah
I got a tab in the back, if you need, yeah
She fuck me good, I'ma put her in Givenchy
Lil' mama bad and she bad then a bitch, yeah (ooh, ooh)

She fuck me good, I'ma put her in Givenchy

She fuck me good, I'ma put her in Givenchy (Givenchy)
I fuck her good, you can tell by what her friends say (yeah)
I'm out the hood, lil' mama know we ain't friendly (nah)

Slangin' that wood, we gon' skip right over third base
Do it, do it lil' mama, girl, you in first place
Let me lick on your body like it's your birthday
I say, "I got it, girl, I got it, you don't owe me nothin'" (whoa)
We drinkin' bottle after bottle, that Coyote Ugly
She got me tongue-tied and I know she love it
I hit it so good, lil' ma, you owe me somethin' (yeah)

Lil' mama bad and she bad then a bitch, yeah

She got that stash in the bag, I can see it, yeah (oh, oh-oh)
I got a tab in the back, if you need, yeah (oh, yeah)
She fuck me good, I'ma put her in Givenchy (yeah)

She fuck me good, I'ma put her on the remix
If she feelin' fly put her on a G6
If you feelin' froggy, leap, bitch
She keep hittin' my phone, she need dick (owo)
I'll provide, just let me inside
Everything gon' be alright
Slip and slide, my fingers runnin' down your spine
She fuck me good, I'ma put her in Givenchy (Givenchy)

Lil' mama bad and she bad then a bitch, yeah
She got that stash in the bag, I can see it, yeah
I got a tab in the back, if you need, yeah
She fuck me good, I'ma put her in Givenchy
Lil' mama bad and she bad then a bitch, yeah (ooh, ooh)
She got that stash in the bag, I can see it, yeah (ooh, ooh)
I got a tab in the back, if you need, yeah
She fuck me good, I'ma put her in Givenchy

Lil' mama bad and she bad then a bitch, yeah
She got that stash in the bag, I can see it, yeah
