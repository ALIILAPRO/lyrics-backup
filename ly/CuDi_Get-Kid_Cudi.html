		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Gimme more, come on
Try to, c'mon, feel the noise
Girls grab the boys (yeah, turn me up)
Get wild, wild, wild (on the beat)
Wild, wild, wild (uh, uh, yeah)

Step it up, let your neck snap back, huh
Saddle up, baby girl, put your hair back
Hurry up, barkeep, keep the brew comin'
Tryin' to drank 'til my back start slumpin'
Like old men, live by them old rules
Fought all the steps front of them old fools
Got me nowhere, nigga, it's a different time
Fuck '08, niggas thinkin' '09
I take a look behind, niggas can't form a line
Like kindergarten, waitin' for the water fountain
Standin' upset, arms crossed, poutin'
Scott Mescudi, boy, they was doubtin' him
Until they Googled me and found Imeem
They love a dooder, they love me I mean
I can't believe how I had a dream of Martin King
But they ain't takin' me out on no balcony

Feel the noise (uh-huh)
Girls grab the boys (yeah)
Get wild, wild, wild (Emile, what up, nigga?)
Wild, wild, wild (Plain Pat, what up?)

Uh, stand up, put your arms to the ceiling, man
Show skin, baby girl, yeah, I'm a fan
Won't do you wrong like a pushover
See my Cutty ridin' through, better pull over
Like I got blue and red lights shinin' 'round
But if I see the man, slowly put the club down
"How you doin' Officer? Nice moustache"
Dunkin Donut eatin' motherfuckers hatin', damn
I get my speed-racer on
Playin' Ray Cash, get my Cleveland city on
Brooklyn to Cali, jet-lagged and all
There's still enough time to hit the mall
Shit, one wish when I'm deceased
Bury me in 501's and 10 Deep
And please keep the Bapes on the feet
So I can watch the Devil ice-grill me
Haha, yeah, how you like a nigga now?
I'm it like the clown and Cudi get 

(Get wild, wild, wild)
I get (get wild, wild, wild)
Yeah, uh, one, yeah
Back, back up in the mix like that
How y'all feel?
How y'all feel? Y'all a'ight?
That's right, uh
And it's like that Plain Pat
Holla at me, man, E
Yeah
Okay, that's the end of my Slade song
I'll have to listen to it
