		<p>
		  High horse

Been living under the gun since I first hit the road
Felt broken, lost and defeated, I hit my lowest lows
Incompetence is a killer when the mouth that speaks is ignorant
I'll see you choke on your words, self-righteous hypocrites

You wanna see a war?
I'm here to settle scores
Sic the hounds, cut you down from your high horse

Is this what you want?
Is this what you need?
Rip the flesh from the bone of the hand that feeds
You wanna see a war?
I'm here to settle scores
Sic the hounds, cut you down from your high horse
Cut you down from your high horse

A name unfit for a stone at its final resting place
The lonely fate of the wicked
Another unmarked grave

Caught the scent
Took the bait
Now the hunter is the prey
Now the hunter is the prey

You wanna see a war?
I'm here to settle scores
Sic the hounds, cut you down from your high horse

Is this what you want?
Is this what you need?
Rip the flesh from the bone of the hand that feeds
You wanna see a war?
I'm here to settle scores
Sic the hounds, cut you down from your high horse
Cut you down from your high horse

Chambered one last round
Dead 'fore you hit the ground

Dead 'fore you hit the ground

Dead 'fore you hit the ground
