		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The radio is shot and the windows don't go down
The engine light's on and brakes always squeak
It ain't worth a lot but I get by just fine now
Cause wherever I'm going I know you're with me
I'm just a fish on your line, baby don't throw me back
Water to wine and you're pouring a glass
You're a sugar rush, like a honeydew
When I'm coming home babe I'm coming to you
You're a singalong on a Friday night
You be the lyrics and I'll be the rhyme, like
I got a fridge from my mamma's and a couch from 85
The front door don't lock and there's holes in the screen
The AC won't work no more, the neighbors are too loud
But I don't pay no mind because you're here with me
I'm just a fish on your line, baby don't throw me back
Water to wine and you're pouring a glass
You're a sugar rush, like a honeydew
When I'm coming home babe I'm coming to you
You're a sing-a-long on a Friday night
You be the lyrics and I'll be the rhyme, like
I'm just a fish on your line, baby don't throw me back
