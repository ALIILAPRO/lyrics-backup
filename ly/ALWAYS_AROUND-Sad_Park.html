		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I DON'T WANNA LEAVE YOU
WITHOUT SAYING THANKS FOR LISTENING 
WE'VE HAD SUCH A GOOD TIME
 SUCH A BAD TIME
IN SUCH A SHORT TIME

DON'T YOU WORRY
I'M ALWAYS AROUND
LOOKING OUT
DON'T YOU WORRY
 I'M ALWAYS AROUND
AND I'M DOWN

LIFE IS A GAMBLE
PUT IT ALL ON LOVE
I'M BETTING ON TRUST
BETTING ON ALL YOU PEOPLE
JACKPOT CASH ALL MY CHIPS IN
HUMAN EXISTENCE
WHAT EVEN IS THIS

DON'T YOU WORRY
I'M ALWAYS AROUND
LOOKING OUT
DON'T YOU WORRY
 I'M ALWAYS AROUND
AND I'M DOWN
