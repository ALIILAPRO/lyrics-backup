		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't need help to swerve the new coupe
This deal I closed deserves a new suit
New two-tone Rollie, watch some thots too
A few shot glasses, pulled up on boo (Ear Drummers)
New Mary jeans, designer socks too
I got the swag flu, this a haiku
I'm somethin' like you, might drink and drive too
Worked nine-to-fives when I was in high school
Up late nights, I'm workin' my move
Just left Ashley house around noon
Now I'm at Kiera house, she in the mood (what up, J-Bo?)
I probably got a sextape comin' soon
These shoes here don't come out 'til June
Think me not an average dude
Didn't leave with one girl, I got a few
Penthouse suite, yeah, it got a pool
I can keep goin' if I got to
This my pic, I'll crop you
Married to the game, said my "I do"s
Got a window seat like Erykah Badu

If you ain't got it, then you can't flaunt it
Pull up, Lamborghini, S on it
(Pull up, Lamborghini, S on it)
(If you ain't got it, then you can't flaunt it)
Let the roof down, I'm blowin' exotic
Party girls be gettin' it started
(Let the roof down, I'm blowin' exotic)
(Party girls be gettin' it started)

Fill my cup 'til I'm lethargic (hey)
Might not make it home 'til morning (yeah)
Pockets fat, yeah, Samoan (hey)
Next-door neighbors think I'm annoying (hey)
I'm a side, nigga, I never get lonely (yeah)
Shawty call me whenever she get horny (yeah)
Four in the mornin' and I got her moanin' (hey)
She a free girl and I'm recordin'

Is Swae your real brother?

Uh, yeah

Bought, bought, bought, bought the club, she comin' home with me
That top wasn't worth a dub (like this), you must be kiddin' me
Well, what's up with the ones? This bitch deserve some twenties
I nearly spent a dozen, she hate a nigga, that's cheap

I know why she choke (choke), reachin' for this gas I smoke (smoke)
Hit her from the gas, she poke-poke (yeah), hit her with the wood, like oak (oak)
Ayy, I know why she so (so), get down, hit her on the floor (Floor)
Sit down, sir, racks too low, sit down, sit down, back too small
My wrist colorful (colorful), you're gullible (gullible)
Can't wife none of them (no), say her head game wonderful
I bought you bottles, bitch (bottles), you don't owe me pussy
Keep on, keep on poppin' it (poppin' it), you know I'm lookin' (ayy)
She came here just to fuck, she came and took it (took it)
Uh, she say she wanna fly out, I'm supposed to book it (book it)
Must have seen that Cullinan, cash make hoes fall in love
Broke, whoa, broke hoes, we be dodgin' 'em (whoa)
This for the bad bitches never gave a fuck

Bought, bought, bought, bought the club, she comin' home with me
That top wasn't worth a dub, you must be kiddin' me
Well, what's up with the ones? This bitch deserve some twenties
I nearly spent a dozen, she hate a nigga, that's cheap (ayy, ayy, ayy)

Let me know if you tryna have fun (have fun)
In the club, I got twenty-thousand ones (thousand ones)
Yeah, I could pay your rent with a tip (with a tip)
But that pussy gotta pop off the rip (off the rip)
Scumbag, bustin' out the zip (goddamn)
Rubberband Man, like TIP (like TIP)
Shawty throw it back and I grab her by the hips (yeah)
Shawty throw it back and I grab by the hips
Make it clap like an AK, ayy (ayy, ayy)
I need the baddest bitch to the main stage (main stage)
These girls ain't tryna be, hey (no, sir)
Shawty want the whole team ,she brave
My drop sit up on dubs, spend money, like it don't mean nothin'
Swipe cards 'til the ATM broken, can't play, you ain't got no token

Bought, bought, bought, bought the club, she comin' home with me
That top wasn't worth a dub, you must be kiddin' me
Well, what's up with the ones? This bitch deserve some twenties
I nearly spent a dozen, she hate a nigga, that's cheap
