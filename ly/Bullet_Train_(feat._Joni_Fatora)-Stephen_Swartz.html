		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Like a, like a, like a bullet train

Moving like the speed of sound
Feet can't keep on the ground
Can't stay in one place
Keep moving like a bullet train
Like a bullet train

Moving like the speed of sound
Feet can't keep on the ground
Can't stay in one place
Keep moving like a bullet train
Like a bullet train

Like, like, like a bullet train
Like, like, like a bullet train

Damn

Like, like, like a bullet train
Like, like, like a bullet train

'Cause I can't stop time
You keep blurring in my mind
And space is undefined
These tracks left behind
We can't stay the same
Can't stop this train
I can't find the breaks
On this bullet train

'Cause I can't stop

Damn

Like, like, like a bullet train
Like, like, like a bullet train
Like, like, like a bullet train
