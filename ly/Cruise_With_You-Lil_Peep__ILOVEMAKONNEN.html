		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I cruise with you, yeah
We would learn our favorite songs
Yeah

We would learn our favorite songs and feel alright
You were with me in the day, 'til the end of the night (when I cruise with you)
When I cruise with you (I cruise with you)
When I cruise with you (when I cruise with you)
When I cruise with you (when I cruise with you)
When I cruise with you (when I cruise with you)
When I cruise with you

We ain't rolled in so long and it ain't feelin' right
You were with me in the day 'til the end of the night
When I cruise with you (I cruise with you)
When I cruise with you (when I cruise with you)
When I cruise with you (when I cruise with you)
When I cruise with you (when I cruise with you)
When I cruise with you
Oh, and feelin' right
You were with me in the day, wait

We ain't rolled in so long and it ain't feelin' right
You were with me in the day 'til the end of the night
We ain't rolled in so long
We would learn our favorite songs
We would learn our favorite, yeah
We would, wait, whoa

We would learn our favorite songs and feel alright
You were with me in the day 'til the end of the night
When I cruise with you (I cruise with you)
When I cruise with you (when I cruise with you)
When I cruise with you (when I cruise with you)
When I cruise with you (when I cruise with you)
When I cruise with you

Haven't rolled in so long and it ain't feelin' right
You were with me in the day 'til the end of the night
When I cruise with you (I cruise with you)
When I cruise with you (when I cruise with you)
When I cruise with you (when I cruise with you)
When I cruise with you (when I cruise with you)
When I cruise with you

It ain't feeling right (I cruise with you)
We wo-, uh (cruise with you, when I cruise with you)
We would learn our favorite song
and feel alright
You were with me in the day
'Til the end of the night
Learn the songs, and feel alright (feel alright)
You, me in the day (day)
Alright, alright, alright, alright, fuck like
Shit
