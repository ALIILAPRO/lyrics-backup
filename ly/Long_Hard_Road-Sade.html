		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's a long hard road ahead
But a voice inside me said

You know there's something oh, that you need to know
It's gonna be alright
Said there's something that you need to know
It's gonna be alright

And when in this life, in this life
When I can only turn my chin
I know it's gonna be alright

When this big old town is closing in
I have lost again, ohh

Here I could stay but I'll keep moving on
Here I could stay but I'll keep moving on

Could be I won't be wrong

There's a long hard road ahead
But a voice inside me said
Said there's something oh, that you need to know

It's gonna be alright
Said there's something that you need to know

It's gonna be alright
