		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I ruled the world
With these hands I shook the heavens to the ground
I laid the gods to rest

I held the key to the kingdom
Lions guarding castle walls
Hail the king of death

Then I lost it all
Dead and broken my
Backs against the wall
Cut me, open I

Just trying to breathe
Just trying to figure it out
Because I built these walls
To watch 'em crumble down
I said

Then I lost it all
Who can save me now?

I stood above, another war
Another jewel above the crown
I was the fear of man

But I was blind
I couldn't see
The world there right in front of me
But now I can

Yeah

Because I lost it all
Dead and broken my
Backs against the wall
Cut me, open I

Just trying to breathe
Just trying to figure it out
Because I built these walls
To watch 'em crumble down
I said

Then I lost it all
Who can save me now

I believe that we all fall down
Sometimes, oh
Can't you see (can't you see)
That we all fall down
Sometimes, oh

Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

I believe that we all fall down
Sometimes, ohh (can't you see), yeah
Can't you see
That we all fall down
Sometimes, oh

(Yeah, we all fall down), yeah

(Come on, yeah)

I believe that we all fall down
Sometimes, yeah
