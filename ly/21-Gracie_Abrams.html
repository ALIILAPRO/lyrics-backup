		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I missed your twenty-first birthday, I've been up at home
Almost tried to call you, don't know if I should
Hate to picture you half-drunk happy
Hate to think you went out without me
I'm sorry if you blame me, if I were you, I would
Thought you'd see it comin', but you never could
I still haven't heard from your family
But you said your mom always loved me

Sometimes I go blurry-eyed
Small talk and you tell me that you're on fire
Lights on and it's black and white
I couldn't stay forever

I see the look in your eye and I'm bitin' my tongue
You'll be the love of my life when I was young
When the night is over
Don't call me up, I'm already under
I get a little bit alone sometimes and I miss you again
I'll be the love of your life inside your head
When the night is over
Don't call me up, I'm already under

Audrey said she saw you out past twelve o'clock
Just because you're hurtin' doesn't mean I'm not
If it doesn't go away by the time I turn thirty
I made a mistake and I'll tell you I'm sorry, "Sorry"

Sometimes I go blurry-eyed
Small talk and you tell me that you're on fire
Lights on and it's black and white
I couldn't stay forever

I see the look in your eye and I'm bitin' my tongue
You'll be the love of my life when I was young
When the night is over
Don't call me up, I'm already under
I get a little bit alone sometimes and I miss you again
I'll be the love of your life inside your head
When the night is over
Don't call me up, I'm already under
