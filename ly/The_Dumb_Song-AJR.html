		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, in my head

You said with certainty
I may be the dumbest person that you've ever seen
You think you're hurtin' me
Bet you won't believe it, but you kinda set me free

You've mentioned Adderall
Slip this guy a sedative, he's bouncin' off the wall
Honey, it's no big deal
We'll get you back to college, you could study somethin' real

So if that's how you feel

When we go down
When kingdom come
Don't look at me, don't look at me
I'm just too dumb
I'd love to stay (love to stay)
But like you said (like you said)
Don't look at me 
'Cause I got nothin' in my head (nothin' in my head)
Oh, in my head

Too dumb for breakin' up
I'd do it in person, but I'd probably mess it up
I'll text you, "That's enough"
That's how empty-headed people get through shitty stuff

Your world is endin' soon
Mine's a little better 'cause I never watch the news
You make my lunch today
I would do it, but I couldn't work my microwave

So if that's what you're sayin'

When we go down
When kingdom come
Don't look at me, don't look at me
I'm just too dumb
I'd love to stay (love to stay)
But like you said (like you said)
Don't look at me 
'Cause I got nothin' in my head (nothin' in my head)
Oh, in my head

You should not have done that
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da

When we go down (we go down)
When kingdom come (kingdom come)
Don't look at me, don't look at me
I'm much too dumb
I'd love to stay (love to stay)
But like you said (like you said)
Don't look at me 
'Cause I got nothin' in my head (nothin' in my head)
Oh, in my head
Oh, in my head

When we go down
When kingdom come
Don't look at me, don't look at me
I'm just too dumb
