		  (Ew) wait is that sparkle
(I mean, it's like satiny) or glitter?
Alright, shit (yeah)
Hold on, I think we, uh
Have 17F, F18
Which way, which way is that?
Right there (okay)
Excuse me ('scuse me, 'scuse me)
Sorry, ah, sorry, didn't mean to step on your foot (my bad)
Let's see, F18, boom
Yo, man, can you believe it's been fourteen years since the first one?
Damn, well, it makes sense, though
You know that nigga Cudi 'bout forty-five?
For real? (Mhm, look it up)
Sweet Jesus
Let me get some popcorn
Damn, we put a lot of butter in this shit
Yo
Di-did you hear that?
