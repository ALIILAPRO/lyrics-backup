		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Scars are aching, storming my veins
I'm not afraid of the voices in my head

Everyday it will come rush back
It won't save you from the misery you hold tight
I can feel it in my chest
I no longer regret
I've been waiting for something for all this time
I know what you got undercover
There's lies around the corner
Everything is so fake i just wanna leave it
cause i'm feeling oppressed and i can't stand it any longer

Cause i can't feel any breath on my face
I'm so afraid of what's coming up next

Don't cover up your skin
I know you well
Your scars mean more than anything
I'm drowning in so deep
Waves crashing down on me
I'm watching you breathing in

She is heartbreaking, holding my hands
Don't run away i won't follow you again

And i'm afraid we've been lost in the dark
You know exactly all the words that hurt the most
We're living in your fears, we're faking it
Show me your scars, it means much more to me

Wake me up from this dream

Cause i can't feel any breath on my face
I'm so afraid of what's coming up next

Don't cover up your skin
I know you well
Your scars mean more than anything
I'm drowning in so deep
Waves crashing down on me
I'm watching you breathing in
