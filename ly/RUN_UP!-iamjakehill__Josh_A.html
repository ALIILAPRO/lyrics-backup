		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, huh huh, yeah

I bet you won't run up
Keep that blade tucked up
Word to ya motha', I leave
Her in the gutta', aha
Pussy boy you talk
 but I can't hear a fuckin' thing
I got money, you got problems, look what
You have done to me, bitch
What you want? What you got?
Everything I am is something that you're not
What you talkin' b-b-bout'?
I left em' dropped, I left em' sleepin'
They wanna run up on me but
I left their body leakin'

This ain't my first rodeo
Mothafucka' slash
Slash turn you to a holy ghost
Top of the mountain lookin' down on you
Send some flames to the ground
Like they call me Zeus i got a grudge that I
Hold and it's botherin' me
I lеt the blood fill my soul
Damn it's swallowin' me
You gettin' sickly from thе envy
It's no secret that we can see
I am your God, now bow to me, bitch

Yeah, let it burn send you to the witches
Cause you bitches never learn
I can hear your heart beatin'
You actin' kinda soft
I got plenty good reasons just
To watch your body drop

I I I ain't budgin'
For a broke mothafucker, wanna press me
I love it man I choke
Motherfuckas wanna check me
You know I'm a deadbeat, hiding backseat
I'ma put you in the dirt man
If you really wanna drag me
Like little fuckin pussy need a check, huh?
Lost all your respect, huh?
Comin' for my head, huh?
Now you got no friends, huh?
What you gonna do?
Actin' like a bitch is all
You ever really do, it's nothin' new

I I bet you won't run up
Keep that blade tucked up
Word to ya motha', I leave
Her in the gutt'a, aha
Pussy boy you talk
But I can't hear a fuckin' thing
I got money, you got problems, look
What you have done to me, bitch
What you want? What you got?
Everything I am is something that you're not
What you talkin' b-b-bout'?
I left em' dropped, I left em' sleepin'
They wanna run up on on me
But I left their body leakin'

I I am your God- God-G-God
I am your God- IIII
I am your God, now bow to me
