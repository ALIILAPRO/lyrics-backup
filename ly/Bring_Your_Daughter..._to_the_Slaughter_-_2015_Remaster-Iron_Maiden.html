		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Honey it's getting close to midnight 
And all the myths are still in town
True love and lipstick on your linen 
Bite the pillow, make no sound
If there's some living to be done 
Before your life becomes your tomb
You'd better know that I'm the one 
Unchain your back door invite me around 

Bring your daughter
Bring your daughter to the slaughter
Let her go, let her go, let her go
Bring your daughter 
Bring your daughter to the slaughter
Let her go, let her go, let her go

Let her go, yeah, hahahahaha

Honey it's getting close to daybreak 
The sun is creeping in the sky
No patent remedies for heartache 
Just empty words and humble pie
So get down on your knees honey 
Assume an attitude
You just pray that I'll be waiting 
'Cause you know, you know I'm coming soon 

Bring your daughter 
Bring your daughter to the slaughter
Let her go, let her go, let her go
Bring your daughter 
Bring your daughter to the slaughter
Let her go, let her go, let her go

So pick up your foolish pride
No going back
No where, no way, no place to hide 
Let her go

Bring your daughter 
Bring your daughter
Bring your daughter 
Bring your daughter
Bring your daughter 
Bring your daughter 
To the slaughter

Bring your daughter 
Fetch your daughter
Bring your daughter 
Fetch your daughter
Bring your daughter 
Fetch your daughter to the slaughter

Bring your daughter 
Bring your daughter to the slaughter
Let her go, let her go, let her go
Bring your daughter 
Bring your daughter to the slaughter
Let her go, let her go, let her go

Bring your daughter 
Bring your daughter to the slaughter
Let her go, let her go, let her go
Let her go
Let her go
Let her go
Oh, coming to getcha
