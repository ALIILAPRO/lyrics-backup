		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hot procession
Gloomy Conga of glum looking beauties
Strolling through the opening scene
Where'd you want it?
It's your decision honey, my planets or yours?
Sectoral heterochromia

Aviation in the evening
I can feel it coming on
Mama told me you should start as you mean
To go wrong
Or else you're never gonna get it right

Se√±orita
Well you need not come coke head close to me
'Cause I can hear you perfectly clear from here

Aviation in the evening
I can feel it coming on
Mama told me you should start 
As you mean to go wrong
Or else you're never gonna get it right

Elementary hallelujahs
Annalise's dulcet tone
Aviation in the evening
I just can't leave it alone
I reckon I just might have broke the ice

The Colourama in your eyes
It takes me on a moonlight drive
It's the way you wing it
While you're figuring it out
