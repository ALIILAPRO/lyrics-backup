		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The taste of a spell on my lips & salt in my eyes 
Naked and whole in the bliss of fallen disguise
I still hear the chiming of silver voices in the night 
Their feathers, their leaves, their centuries of light

cnd they dance through the beam 
Wearing bold and woken dreams 
cs they sway and I swoon  
They are howling to the moon

Pedal as strong as you might, chasing her face  
They told me to live in delight and bathe in her grace  
I took an oath, promised to cherish all of my inner fires 
cnd honor the strength in our hearts as we learn to fly

cnd they dance through the beam 
Wearing bold and woken dreams 
cs they sway and I swoon  
They are howling to the moon

Drink up the potion of truth, a fruit sweet and wise  
Desacralizing our youth we curdled the lies 
They carved my new faith on the bark of an oak tree as old as time 
I have all that i need and my blood and my breath are divine

cnd we dance through the beam 
Wearing bold and woken dreams 
cs we sway and we swoon  
We are howling to the moon
