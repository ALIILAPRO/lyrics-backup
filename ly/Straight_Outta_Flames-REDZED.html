		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm straight out the flames, open the case
I'm burning dead bodies, I don't know their names
I piss on the church
I come with the purge
They all in the basement, you don't need to search
They call me freak and the loser
Fiend and the boozer
My whole body itching, but I'm not a fucking user
Maybe now I could use some
Life is so gruesome
Your mother, me, Bloody Mary gonna have a threesome

I always seem to break
It's all denial
I can't escape my fate
I burn in fire
I'm burning at the stake
I start to smile
And it's so fucking fake
I see the light

Little blonde put me in the fucking friendzone
Now I get the feeling I should pop another benzo
Bitch, I'm at the peak, I be coming to an end zone
Just so you know I will never forget you
I represent all the bad
Motherfuckers from the dead
As I'm walking in the dungeon, and the vision like a bat
It's a threat, make you sweat
Demon crawling on your back
Now you're burning in the fire
Can you see the shades of black?

I always seem to break
It's all denial
I can't escape my fate
I burn in fire
I'm burning at the stake
I start to smile
And it's so fucking fake
I see the light

What an excellent day for an exorcism
