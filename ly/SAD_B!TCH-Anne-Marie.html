		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This ain't another sad girl anthem
I'm headin' down a different road
Anything that's toxic's cancelled
Uh-uh, nuh-uh, oh, no
I'm fed up tryna keep a boyfriend
Do I have a job? I don't know
My mama's so disappointed
Nuh-uh, nuh-uh, oh, no

This is boring, so annoying
Time to turn the page (yeah)

Being sad is so last year, I'm over it (yeah)
Everyone's so down 'round here, I'm tired of it (I'm tired of it)
I just wanna be with my friends, fucked up, gettin' rich (cha-ching)
I just gotta make one thing clear
Baby, it's so last year being a sad bitch

Ain't no sad bitch

I don't care about any bullshit
I dare you try to kill my vibe
I'm here writin' all my new shit
Uh-huh, uh-huh, oh yeah
Now that I'm feelin' so damn different
I wish that you could feel this too
But I know you're stuck with tunnel vision
Makes me feel bad for you

This is boring, so annoying
Time to turn the page (yeah)

Being sad is so last year, I'm over it (yeah)
Everyone's so down 'round here, I'm tired of it (I'm tired of it)
I just wanna be with my friends, fucked up, gettin' rich (cha-ching)
I just gotta make one thing clear
Baby, it's so last year being a sad bitch

(Ooh)
Ain't no sad bitch
(Ooh)
Ain't no sad bitch
(Ooh)
Ain't no sad bitch
Gotta make one thing clear
Baby, it's so last year being a sad bitch
