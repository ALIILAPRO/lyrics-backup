		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Never said a motherfucking lie to a stranger
(I never- I never) Yeah
But you ain’t no stranger
Throwing accusations, I’mma turn around a page you
She bitching bout the way I been moving online (We’re sorry)
Oh but when we chilling together it’s all fine
Time is illusion you lose to enslaved minds
Time, don’t waste mine
I did some shorties hella dirty, paragraphs wordy
gaslight a bitch if she wanna overwork me like

(Respectfully)
No, no one love you quite like I did (I did)
And no one fuck you quite like I did (I did)
Just know
If I ever hit it once, you’re always my bitch
No, no one love you quite like I did (I did)
And no one fuck you quite like I did
Just know
If I ever hit it once, you’re always my bitch
Ooh
Ooh
(If I ever hit it once)

I love your morning texts
“Afta you’re full of shit”
My clothes in the streets, you love to throw a fit
You’re Francis Ford Coppola way you make a scene
But at the end of the day I’m all up in ya spleen (Yeah)
Did I forget to mention?
Past and post-tense the same in the fourth dimension
Girl that’s why I love and I resent you
Bitch we plying fetch the way you return my attention
No
You should listen to your gut unless I’m in it
When will you learn?
I did some shorties hella dirty, paragraphs wordy
Gaslight a bitch if she wanna overwork me

(Respectfully)
No, no one love you quite like I did (I did)
And no one fuck you quite like I did (I did)
Just know
If I ever hit it once, you’re always my bitch
No, no one love you quite like I did (I did)
And no one fuck you quite like I did
Just know
If I ever hit it once, you’re always my bitch

Shortie I know that I did you wrong (I did you so wrong)
Yelling at me til your voice is gone
Couples years passed but you’re still a hurt soul (You’re still a hurt soul)
Maybe we we’re never meant to get along
Shortie I know that I did you wrong
Yelling at me til your voice is gone (gone)
couples years passed but you’re still a hurt soul
Maybe we we’re never meant to get along (Oh)
Yeah I did some shorties hella dirty, paragraphs wordy
Gaslight a bitch if she wanna overwork me
