Babycakes, you just don't know, know
How I, I, I want you so, so
And I just want you to know that I think our love will grow
We'll take it step-by-step because I'm not somethin' you own
Babycakes, you just don't know, know (no, no, no, don't cry)
How I, I, I want you so, so (yeah, yeah)
And I just want you to know that I think our love will grow (oh yeah, yeah)
We'll take it step-by-step because I'm not somethin' you own

I know sometimes (sometimes) that things can get real bad (bad)
But for the most part I'ma make sure I'm the best you had (oh yeah, yeah)
Don't even start on to that stuff that you used to (used to)
Because I put you in this lifestyle, wasn't used to
And don't even act like you don't even care (no)
And if it's stuck, it's right there in the air (woah)
And one for you and she get the same pair (no, no)
And no, no cry 'cause you do you, no tears (no, no, no, no, no, don't cry)
Babycakes, you just don't know (no, no, no, don't cry)
My time is almost up, and I just gotta go (no, no, no, don't cry)
I had a different love, I met her on the road (no, no, no, don't cry)
She told me that she stuck
From my touch 'cause I'm froze (no, no, no, don't cry)

Babycakes, you just don't know, know (no, no, no, don't cry)
How I, I, I want you so, so (yeah)
And I just want you to know that I think our love will grow (woah, oh)
We'll take it step-by-step
Because I'm not somethin' you own (no, no, no, don't cry)
Babycakes, you just don't know, know (no, no, no, don't cry)
How I, I, I want you so, so (whoa, yeah yeah)
And I just want you to know that I think our love will grow (oh yeah, yeah)
We'll take it step-by-step
Because I'm not somethin' you own (no, no, no, don't cry)

I know that it's wrong that I don't want it to end
I know I messed up when I was seeing your best friend
But when we're fighting (fighting)
You're not my boyfriend (boyfriend)
I can replace you, but I can't find another one
And all my love it will go out to you (oh, yeah-yeah)
And don't be shocked if I arrive with someone new (oh, yeah yeah)
So, I called you here to tell you I'm with someone you know
And if I said that I loved you, I lied (no, no, no, don't cry)

Babycakes, you just don't know, know (no, no, no, don't cry)
How I, I, I want you so, so (no, no, no, don't cry)
And I just want you to know 
That I think our love will grow (no, no, no, don't cry)
We'll take it step-by-step
Because I'm not somethin' you own (no, no, no, don't cry)
Babycakes, you just don't know, know (yeah yeah)
How I, I, I want you so, so (whoa, yeah yeah)
And I just want you to know that I think our love will grow (oh yeah, yeah)
We'll take it step-by-step because I'm not somethin' you own

I, I, I, I (demon time)(Jesus Christ)
I, I, I, I
I, I, I, I
I, I, I, I (whoa)
I, I, I, I (oh no, oh no)
I, I, I, I
I, I, I, I (whoa)
I, I, I, I
(Ha ha ha ha)
