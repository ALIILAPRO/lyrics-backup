		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She said that I'm young and I'm dumb
I said I'm young and I'm numb
So I can't feel the pain anymore

She don't wanna hang around with
A guy like me
She caught me with the Glock Nine
On the side of my seat ask me what I'm doing
Baby, I'm doing me i'm a freak
Keep it coming give 'em something to see
Saying what they want when
I'm turning my back i can't put on an act
All I'm speaking is facts
Brother switching up, man it kind of amaze me
Pop a pill and get lazy
Feel like nothing can phase me

She said that I'm young and I'm dumb
I said I'm young and I'm numb
So I can't feel the pain anymore
Say you don't like me but
Your girl getting hyphy
When she dancin' to my songs on the floor
Said she wanna come back
So 'imma take her away to the place
I used to go when I was counting my days
Never wanna leave said she lovin' my vibe
She love the color of my eyes
I think of making her mine
Till there's flat on my line
All your diamonds will shine
There's a lot on my mind
But most about you baby girl
