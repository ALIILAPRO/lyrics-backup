		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Stolen
Some people stay a life, some for a moment
Some hearts they set a light just to be frozen
And so we're out of time

Broken
But now you've got the chance to travel oceans
I hope the world's as wide as you were hoping
Don't let heartache cloud your mind

If the days go darker, darling
And you lose your way

Go on, go on, I'm not beside you
But I'll be the song there in the silence, I
I'll always be your serenade, serenade, I
I'll always be your serenade

Let go, let go, darling, it's over now
You're on your own, but I'm on your shoulder, I
I'll always be your serenade, serenade, I
I'll always be your serenade

They told you
It's not the being drunk, it's being sober
That's when it really hits you that it's over
It's hard to say goodbye

So you can keep me
Somewhere out of reach but if you need me
Just hum these memories and you can feel me
I'm always standing by

Go and write your story, darlin'
You will find your place

Go on, go on, I'm not beside you
But I'll be the song there in the silence, I
I'll always be your serenade, serenade, I
I'll always be your serenade

Let go, let go, darling, it's over now
You're on your own, but I'm on your shoulder, I
I'll always be your serenade, serenade, I
I'll always be your serenade

You can always remember that
I'm here to ease your mind
I'm on your side and
You can call me and just like that
I'll sing a song to bring you home, babe

Go on, go on, I'm not beside you
But I'll be the song there in the silence, I
I'll always be your serenade, serenade, I
I'll always be your serenade

Let go, let go, darling, it's over now
You're on your own, but I'm on your shoulder, I
I'll always be your serenade, serenade, I
I'll always be your serenade
