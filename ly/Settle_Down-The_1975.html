		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A soft sound
To the way she wears her hair down
Covering up her face
Oh what a let down
I don't seem to be having any effect now
Falling all over the place

But you're losing your words
We're speaking in bodies
Avoiding me and talking 'bout you
But you're losing your turn
I guess I'll never learn
Cause I stay another hour or two

For crying out loud, settle down
You know I can't be found with you
We get back to my house
Your arms, my mouth
Now I just stop myself around you

A small town
Dictating all the people we get around
What a familiar face
Do you get what I mean now?
I'm so fixated on the girl with the soft sound
And hair all over the place

But you're sure that I'd learn
I'm pushing through bodies
Avoiding me and walking around you
But you're cold and I burn
I guess I'll never learn
Cause I stay another hour or two

For crying out loud, settle down!
You know I can't be found with you
We get back to my house
Your arms, my mouth
Now I just stop myself around you

A soft sound
To the way she wears her hair down
Covering up her face
Oh what a let down,
I don't seem to be having any effect now
Falling all over the place

But you're losing your words
We're speaking in bodies
Avoiding me and talking 'bout you
But you're losing your turn
I guess I'll never learn
Cause I stay another hour or two

For crying out loud, settle down!
You know I can't be found with you
We get back to my house
Your arms, my mouth
Now I just stop myself around you

For crying out loud
