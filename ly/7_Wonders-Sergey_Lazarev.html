		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell me, love means nothing wrong
Don't tell me, don't tell me
I'm wrong for wanting you

They say, that lovers belong
But I'm weightless, I've waited too long for substitutes

I've been tearing at the wall
Tearing at the wall and I'm breaking through
And in the madness of it all
You know that I'll be ready to die for you

7 wonders of the world
(7 wonders of the world)
But nothing that compares to you
There's nothing down on earth
Nothing that compares to you

It's gonna get around
I'm breaking out of bounds
Because it's obvious, obvious
7 wonders of the world
But nothing that compares to you

Devoted to crossing the line
That someone has drawn and make around in front of me

Reckless and making my way
And I'm changing
To never recorrect the man I am

Cause I've been tearing at the wall
Tearing at the wall and I'm breaking through
And in the madness of it all
You know that I'll be ready to die for you

7 wonders of the world
(7 wonders of the world)
But nothing that compares to you
There is nothing down on earth
Nothing that compares to you

It's gonna get around
I'm breaking out of bounds
Because it's obvious, obvious
7 wonders of the world
But nothing that compares to you

Loving you is all that I know
Oh yeah, there's no other time than right now
Oh oh

7 wonders of the world
But nothing that compares to you

7 wonders of the world
(7 wonders of the world)
But nothing that compares to you
There's nothing down on earth
Nothing that compares to you

It's gonna get around
I'm breaking out of bounds
Because it's obvious, obvious
7 wonders of the world
But nothing that compares to you
