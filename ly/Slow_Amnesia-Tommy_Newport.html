		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's 5 miles til’ you’ll ever know 
So you would hope 
I’m never home 
This life needs an antidote 
The perfect dose is comatose 
If i chose to never let go 
Search for my soul I'd be okay 
I lost my hold 
The cold in my bones
It really does show the way 

Slow amnesia is coming on 
I can feel it I think I’m gone
Slow amnesia is coming on 
I can feel it I think I’m gone
Slow amnesia is coming on 
I can feel it I think I’m gone
Slow amnesia is coming on 
I can feel it I think I’m gone

Last nite took my dopamine 
In the shadows 
Overexposed 
Sit tight here's the smoke screen
It's so hard to see
If i chose to never let go 
Search for my soul id be okay 
I lost my hold 
The cold in my bones
It really does show the way 

Slow amnesia is coming on 
I can feel it I think I’m gone
Slow amnesia is coming on 
I can feel it I think I’m gone
Slow amnesia is coming on 
I can feel it I think I’m gone
Slow amnesia is coming on 
I can feel it I think I’m gone
