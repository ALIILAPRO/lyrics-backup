		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Turn up in the headphones quite a bit
We in Paris with this shit ya know I'm sayin'
Yes, sir
Rest in peace my brother Paris Brown, nah mean?

Lightning strike after dark
What's the price? Up the bar
Used to fight, the streets is harsh
I wasn't right, locked behind bars
Stealing the cars, servin' the narcs
The money I gain, all for the art
Whole lot of pain, black in my heart
I know she ashamed, I broke her heart

Shit got real just a week ago (Real)
My dog got killed just a week ago (Killed)
He was in the field, that's just how it go (Field)
Picking cotton out the field, that's just how it go (Field)
Mind twisted and I'm thinking about the shit I lost (Mind twist)
Shit wicked, how your brother be done took you off (Shit wicked)
He a boss, but he wanna be the bigger boss (Bigger boss)
I'm a menace, I'm on codeine, I can't get up off (Codeine)
They think I'm perfect 'cause the fame and I got plenty flaws (Perfect)
Got a bigger vault, let the ciggy talk (Hey)
The whole city talk when I pull the titties out (Skrt)
Watching Mickey Mouse now you gotta kill a mouse

Lightning strike after dark
What's the price? Up the bar
Used to fight, the streets is harsh
I wasn't right, locked behind bars
Stealing the cars, servin' the narcs
The money I gain, all for the art
Whole lot of pain, black in my heart
I know she ashamed, I broke her heart

I get bread by the loaf (Bread)
Bought a Lamb, bought a boat (Lamb)
Cookin' up a chicken, wash my hand off with soap (Soap)
He done took the stand, they gonna kill him down the road (He told)
Macbook Pro, how I bend over your hoe (Yeah)
Make her bow down, I'm the king of this shit
Give me the crown now (Crown)
Diamond rings and they hittin' like bling-blaow (Bling-blaow)
Got you lookin' for your bitch like Juntao (Juntao)
She came off the fame, you can't do none (Fame)
You done lost your whole brain tryna prove some
(Pow-pow-pow-pow-pow) The police shoot em'
Now the black man dead, this a re-run (Ooh)
If you open up your eyes, you can see som' (Yeah)

Lightning strike after dark
What's the price? Up the bar
Used to fight, the streets is harsh
I wasn't right, locked behind bars
Stealing the cars, servin' the narcs
The money I gain, all for the art
Whole lot of pain, black in my heart
I know she ashamed, I broke her heart

Shit got real just a week ago
My dog got killed just a week ago
He was in the field, that's just how it go
Picking cotton out the field, that's just how it go
Mind twisted and I'm thinking about the shit I lost
Shit wicked, how your brother be done took you off
He a boss, but he wanna be the bigger boss
