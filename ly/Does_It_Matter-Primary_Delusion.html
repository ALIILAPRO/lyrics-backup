		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wasn't ready for today
Sometimes it seems so pointless and in vain
To try, to tell them what you have to say-ay-ay
So I, I prefer to say it in this way

What if today was the end of sunshine?
What if tomorrow had no rain?
What if you found your world inside?
Would it help you starve the pain?

Why do we keep our love inside?
Why do we die before we're dead?
Why do we always have to be right?
Why do we have to get ahead?

Hey hey hey
Does it matter what I say, anyway?
When words always fail
And intoxication from boredom will prevail

Why do we keep our love inside?
Why do we die before we're dead?
Why do we always have to be right?
Why do we have to get ahead?
