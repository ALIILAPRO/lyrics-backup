		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Come live with us in the palace
There's a room waiting for you
Come on, come on, come on
Just let us adore you

Come live with us in the palace
There's a room waiting for you
Come on, come on, come on
Just let us adore you

Yes, we know that you're not her but you were hers
You know what it meant to love her
And you remind us so much of her

(You think you can handle them?)
(They're not exactly easy to get along with)

Today, right here, right now
I'll love again
I've already found someone

(Just let us adore you)

Today (come live with us in the palace), right here, right now
(There's a room waiting for you) I'll love again
(Come on, come on, come on) I've already found someone

(Just let us adore you)

Yes, I know that you're not her and I was hers
You know what it meant to love her
And you remind me so much of her

Today, right here, right now
We'll love again

We've already found someone
