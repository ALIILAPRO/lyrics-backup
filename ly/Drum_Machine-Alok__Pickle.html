		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I love you, Keppa
Ay
Yo
Wok up in my cup and I piss it out for my P.O
Walk up in the cut, Im stank as fuck ain't got no B.O
Know what the fuck we on we colder then some fucking freon
Coffin been locked up, you know I'm tryna get my freak on
I don't wanna smoke no cones, coffin want between your jawbones
Some things better left unsaid, and other things better unknown
Coffins just glad to be home, breakin' some hearts in my chrome
Maison Margiela no phone hoes get so jealous alone
I got the power no ohms
These bitches tweakin', lookin' for reasons
To keep heart beating, but im still bleeding
And they fiendin', cause I ain't givin' no attention
And I had no intention, coffin could feel all the tension
Ay
Catch a bag its a and smash a grab, know I get a fast
I do a dab, then I serve some gas, people want it bad
Like Plankton, up in the crusty crab, you ain't gettin' that
People give a little, then they expect a whole lot
You ain't, you ain't gettin' shit else, even with my pockets filled with knots
I don't know a whole lot of people
Livin' life up on the edge, like Evil Knievel
Feelin' like a fucking eagle, I spread out my wings
I don't wanna fucking sequel or see what tomorrow brings
Everything I do is illegal, so I'm cuttin' these strings
I don't like these fucking weasels that like to hang around me
