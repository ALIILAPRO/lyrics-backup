		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Your high heels thrown across the floor
And the people getting high just from the back door
Well you find someone who really knows
Just exactly how much you deserve the love
Well baby let me take you
Out of your disguise
You can have me for the night
For all of the good good
Let me slip into your dreams
Uncover all the in-betweens
Don't need to make up your mind

Cuz the stars are all aligned
The way your body's over mine
Dancing in the moonlight
Out of your disguise
You can have me for night
Underneath the moonlight

I'll meet you at the great escape
Where the broken dreams are mended by the inferno
Got a pass to be young dumb naive with you tonight
And we're breaking the rules
Then flee the scene like Bonnie Clyde
We're just lost souls under the moonlight
But with you I know I'll be alright
Cuz we'll leave this party born again
We don't need to live this life of love and pretend

Cuz the stars are all aligned
The way your body's over mine
Dancing in the moonlight
Out of your disguise
You can have me for night
Underneath the moonlight
