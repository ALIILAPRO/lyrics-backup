		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Never never, never never
I don't wanna hurt forever

You used to be my song, love was the melody
But now you overplayed it so much to make me hate it
Her kisses in your phone, I found it on our bed
Hurts more than betrayal, the fact that you never failed to

Trick my mind, telling me the perfect lies
Didn't want to see the signs
Time after time, time after time
It's okay, you belong to yesterday
Never gonna make me stay
This time I swear, this time I say

Never never, never never
I don't wanna, hurt forever
I will never, never, never, never, never, never love
Never never, hurt forever
I will never, never, never, never, never, never love
Never never, never again

Nothing is set in stone, that's what I heard you say
Fighting a losing battle, scores you can never settle
I call you by your name, my favorite mistake
Hurts more than betrayal, the fact that you never failed to

Trick my mind, telling me the perfect lies
Didn't want to see the signs
Time after time, time after time
It's okay, you belong to yesterday
Never gonna make me stay
This time I swear, this time I say

Never never, never never
I don't wanna, hurt forever
(Forever, forever, forever, forever)
Never never, never again

Never never, never never
I don't wanna, hurt forever
I will never, never, never, never, never, never love
Never never, hurt forever
I will never, never, never, never, never, never love
Never never, never again
