		  Yeah
My thing, no, no
(Tribal Kush)

Ready fi burn up warning, Summer splinter
Big, da bad gyal inna real life back no Tinder
When di things hotter, come like a sprinter
Hotter than lava any time, even in winter

Gyal, let me see how you are bad (bad)
Sipping while you sit down pon it
Yeah, me inna that (that)
So, me say mi gyal, let me see how you are bad (bad)
Smokin' while you block it, block it
Yeah, me inna that

You so mad, gyal
Whine your body, yeah, bubble pon me
Whine your body, yeah, bubble pon me
Gyal, let me see how you are bad (bad)
Mad ting, when you whine your body
Yeah, me inna that (that)

I know she want me and she know di mechanic
Top a top, gyal, tonight you di baddest officially
On di left side, I got my cup, on right got di Cali
Gyal, bruk it set it unconditionally

So me say, big man nah leave 'til tings done
Close your eyes, gyal, welcome to di shatta kingdom
Yeah, technically good she nah look fi wisdom
Big up every gyal Japan to London (to London)

Ready fi burn up warning Summer splinter
Big, da bad gyal inna real life back no Tinder
When di things hotter, come like a sprinter
Hotter than lava any time, even in winter

Gyal, let me see how you are bad (bad)
Sipping while you sit down pon it
Yeah, me inna that (that)
So, me say mi gyal, let me see how you are bad (bad)
Smokin' while you block it, block it
Yeah, me inna that

You so mad, gyal
Whine your body, yeah, bubble pon me
Whine your body, yeah, bubble pon me
Gyal, let me see how you are bad (bad)
Mad ting, when you whine your body
Yeah, me inna that (that)

No how matter, no matter where you come from
Big batty gyal, fresh clean drop it up down
No how matter, no matter where you come from
Uptown or downtown, gyal kill pon bad sound

That we love
When di pretty gyal dem getting low
Any time we come fi turn up, better get di city lock
Hands pon your knees gimme di best backshot
You know skills mad, yeah
Whole ah dem fi know (mmh)

Ready fi burn up warning, Summer splinter
Big, da bad gyal inna real life back no Tinder
When di things hotter, come like a sprinter
Hotter than lava any time, even in winter

Gyal, let me see how you are bad (bad)
Sipping while you sit down pon it
Yeah, me inna that (that)
So, me say mi gyal, let me see how you are bad (bad)
Smokin' while you block it, block it
Yeah, me inna that

Whine your body, yeah, bubble pon me
Whine your body, yeah, bubble pon me

Yeah, me inna that (that)
