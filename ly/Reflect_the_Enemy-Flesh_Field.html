		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can admit when I'm wrong.
I tried to tell you this for so long. 
Times have changed, and it's no longer the same. 
What I've lost has been the only thing that I've gained.
I'm sick of your pretension.
It's just another way to get more attention. 
I've given up on you and all that you've said. 
I have to make a change.
I have to look ahead. 

I can't wait to show you
All you've done to hurt me.
I can't wait to tell you
What you've done to pervert me.

I don't think you understand my desperation.
You've condemned my sanity to ruination.
I'm not alone in my complaints or accusations. 
You stay this course, you can expect retaliation.
I forced myself to listen
To all your explanations. 
I forced myself to realize
All their implications.
I tried. 
I failed.
