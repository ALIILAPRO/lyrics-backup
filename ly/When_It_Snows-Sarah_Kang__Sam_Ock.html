		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When it snows, I'd like to see it land upon your wrinkled nose
I'll notice how your cheeks turn the shade of a rose
When it snows, I'll reach into the pocket of your winter coat
And there I'd find my favorite hand to hold
Through winter snow
Under the mistletoe
I'll learn to love you more and more
Come summertime
Under a sunny sky
I hope that you will still be mine
When it snows, we'll leave our footprints all the way to your front door
And cozy up to the fire to stay warm
When it snows, we'll make some tea or share a glass of honey whiskey
Here's to looking at you and me
Through winter snow
Under the mistletoe
I'll learn to love you more and more
Come summertime
Under a sunny sky
I hope that you will still be mine
As quickly as the first snow fell
We both know that it soon will melt
Whether we'll stay true, only time will tell
Through winter snow
Under the mistletoe
I'll learn to love you more and more
Come summertime
Under a sunny sky
I hope that you will still be mine
I hope that you will still be mine
