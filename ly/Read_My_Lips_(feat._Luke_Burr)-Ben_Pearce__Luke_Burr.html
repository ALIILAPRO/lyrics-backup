		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Putting it off til tomorrow
trying to talk but you ain't got time
Drowning me out with the bottle
bury your head til you can't see right

i had to let you know
I left a message for
you on your answer phone
oh but you never called
I wrote a letter for
you left it by your door 
why does this have to be
so difficult

how can it feel and be so strong
how can a heart beat for so long
how can the birds make so much sense with their song (their song)
if i can see stars from out of space
and even the blind can find their way
how do my words get lost 
between you and my tongue

perfectly lost in translation
looking at me with that stone cold face
maybe i've got the wrong station
or a frequency that doesn't resonate

i had to let you know
I left a message for
you on your answer phone
oh but you never called
I wrote a letter for
you left it by your door 
why does this have to be
so difficult

how can it feel and be so strong
how can a heart beat for so long
how can the birds make so much sense with their song (their song)
if i can see stars from out of space
and even the blind can find their way
how do my words get lost 
between you and my tongue


if you didn't get it
ooh when i said it
read my lips oh darling
if you didn't get it
ooh when i said it
then read my lips oh darling 
if you didn't get it
ooh when i said it
then read my lips

how can it feel and be so strong
how can a heart beat for so long
how can the birds make so much sense with their song (their song)
if i can see stars from out of space
and even the blind can find their way
how do my words get lost 
between you and my tongue
