		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mm-mm-mm ah ah ah ah ah ah
Ooh

I showcase my scars like trophies
I take my friends in doses
My family just don't know me, well
I turn my blood so frozen
Most happy when I'm dozin'
'Cause I pretend I'm far
Away from the patterns
Like nothing really matters, ah ah
But you say you could be better
Am I the only one?
I'm hangin' on every letter, ah ah
Can you show me what you mean?

Real love isn't easy
You hate that you need me
Life ain't on the TV
But they played you like CDs (Okay)
Real love isn't easy
You hate that you need me
Life ain't on the TV
But they played you like CDs

Romance with melatonin
But you still ain't sleepin' well
One drink, that's how it go
But then I'm drownin' in myself
Blacklight, you're so lonely
Just don't be lonely by yourself
I guess you're just broken
Just like everybody else

Just like everybody else else
Else just like everybody

I won't fall in love you'd just run away
Clothes in your closet mine's got skeletons
I don't wanna feel sorry
So it's ice all on me but my head too foggy
And I just wanna get away from the patterns
Like nothing really matters, ah ah
But you say you could be better
Am I the only one?
I'm hangin' on every letter, ah ah
Can you show me what you mean?

Real love isn't easy
You hate that you need me
Life ain't on the TV
But they played you like CDs (Okay)
Real love isn't easy
You hate that you need me
Life ain't on the TV
But they played you like CDs

Romance with melatonin
But you still ain't sleepin' well
One drink, that's how it go
But then I'm drownin' in myself
Blacklight, you're so lonely
Just don't be lonely by yourself
I guess you're just broken
Just like everybody else
Romance with melatonin
But you still ain't sleepin' well
One drink, that's how it go
But then I'm drownin' in myself
Blacklight, you're so lonely
Just don't be lonely by yourself
I guess you're just broken
Just like everybody else

You're just like everybody else
Just like everybody else
You're just like everybody else
Just like everybody else
