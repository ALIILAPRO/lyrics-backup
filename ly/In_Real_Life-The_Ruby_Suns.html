		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We walked til our souls wore thin
With any luck we did it again
We got drunk til the sun went down
But it was funny 'cause it never did

Need help, it's down
Her color isn't color
Father in winter
Mother in summer

That's when I realized

I never want to live a real life
I'm not ready for the real life

Real life wasn't what I wanted
What I wanted was a waste of time
If time is money then money
Means nothing

Wherever you are
I'm already there
Your friend is now
Now is never

I never want to live a real life
I'm not ready for the real life\

I never want to live a real life
I'm not ready for the real life

Wherever you are (I never want to live a real life)
I'm already there
Your friend is now (I'm not ready for the real life)
Now is never
