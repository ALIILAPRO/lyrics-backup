		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Little mama she toxic
She got my heart beating like doot-doot-doot-doot-doot
Yeah she so toxic
Got my heart racing like doot-doot-doot-dootdoot-doot-doot-doot
جیگر دلم Why you stressing me?
You know I ain’t did that
5’2 but her attitude close to six flat
She gon’ listen when she pillow biting I’mma split that
Toxic but I love that
Oh-oh-oh
(toxic baby)
She so toxic but I love it

Damn! Why you do me like that? (Like that)
Why you looking through me like that? (Like that)
Shut the fuck up before I make you (Make you)
I love you(I love you), no wait, I hate you (I hate you)
I ain’t pull out if she’s still on Daddy’s money yeah
I call that seed funding yeah
Can’t let a bitch go
I love everything about you my baby even the fact that you crazy, Uh-oh
Can’t see the picture you’re painting
Stroking you in the living room I love our toxic entanglement
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh

Little mama she toxic
She got my heart beating like doot-doot-doot
doot-doot
Yeah she so toxic
Got my heart racing like doot-doot-doot-dootdoot-doot-doot-doot
جیگر دلم Why you stressing me?
You know I ain’t did that
5’2 but her attitude close to six flat
She gon’ listen when she pillow biting I’mma split that
Toxic but I love that, uh oh

Nails done, hair done, everything did
Bad bitches in the front
Bad bitches in the back
Nails done, hair done, everything did
Bad bitches in the front
Bad bitches in the back

Little mama she toxic
She got my heart beating like doot-doot-doot
doot-doot
Yeah she so toxic
Got my heart racing like doot-doot-doot-dootdoot-doot-doot-doot
جیگر دلم Why you stressing me?
You know I ain’t did that
5’2 but her attitude close to six flat
She gon’ listen when she pillow biting I’mma split that
Toxic but I love that, uh oh
