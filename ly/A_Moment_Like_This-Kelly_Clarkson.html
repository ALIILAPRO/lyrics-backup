		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What if I told you
It was all meant to be
Would you believe me?
Would you agree?
It's almost that feelin'
We've met before
So tell me that you don't think I'm crazy
When I tell your love has come here and now

A moment like this
Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment like this
Some people search forever
For that one special kiss
Oh, I can't believe it's happening to me
Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment like this

Everything changes
But beauty remains
Something so tender
I can't explain
Well, I may be dreamin'
But 'til I awake
Can't we make this dream last forever?
And I'll cherish all the love we share

A moment like this
Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment like this
Some people search forever
For that one special kiss
Oh, I can't believe it's happening to me
Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment like this

Could this be the greatest love of all?
I wanna know that you will catch me when I fall 
So let me tell you this
Some people wait a lifetime for a moment

Like this
Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment like this
Some people search forever
For that one special kiss
Oh, I can't believe it's happening to me
Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment (moment), like this

Oh, (moment) like this
(Moment like)
Oh, I can't believe its happening to me
Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment like this
Ooh, like this
