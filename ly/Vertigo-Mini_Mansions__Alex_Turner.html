		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh you know me from all my videos,
Isn't it time we hit the road?
Oh, you want me, that's all you need to know
Wish you were mine, I got to go

Oh you miss me, our love's in stereo.
Isn't it finer in mono?
Oh you feel me, I rim from head to toe.
You say goodbye I say hello.

Oh you know, that's how it goes
Oh you know, that vertigo
Oh you know, honey
Get your loving on the low
Don't you know ya give me that vertigo

Strictly stick shift witchcraft
She's miss been there, did that.
Bought the cat suit
I'm not used to raising the roof then telling the truth
I thought I wasn't but I was losing my mind
When she showed me how the night was supposed to sound
I realized that then whenever I shut my eyes

Well there she offered, looking like a million dollars
In a briefcase or a duffle bag by high noon tomorrow
Just make sure you're not followed
And since you're such a stunner
Send her something sunset coloured
Let's make love to one another
Run for Cover.

Oh you know, that's how it goes
Oh you know, that vertigo
Oh you know, honey
Get your loving on the low
Don't you know ya give me that vertigo

Oh you need me, a cancer from the sky
Burning up life, too cool to die.
Oh you move me, crescendos cuff the link
She is on the verge, I'm on the brink.

What's the line, where's your mind, what's it for?
What's the time, did you find what you're dying for?
What's the night, where's the light from the door?
What's the life, where's the knife you keep hiding for?
Where's the rhyme from the lines on before?
Was it mine, just the kind you've been fighting for?

Some RX, are you next, are you more?
Where's my mind, what's that knock on the door?

Oh you know, that's your M.O.
Oh you know, that vertigo
Oh you know, honey, get your loving on the low
Don't you know ya give me that vertigo?

Oh you know, that's how it goes
Oh you know, that vertigo
Oh you know, honey
Get your loving on the low
Don't you know ya give me that vertigo
