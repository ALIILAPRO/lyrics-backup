		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here, where the sky's falling
I'm covered in blue
I'm running and I'm crawling
Fighting for you
When the rain stops, then, darling, what will I do?
And I know I go all in, but why do I?

You give me a reason
Something to believe in
I know, I know, I know
You give me a meaning
Something I can breathe in
I know, I know, I know
It's a bittersweet feeling
Longing and I'm leaving
I go, I go, I go
But I wish I was there with you
Oh, I wish I was there with you

There's a crack in my window
A bird in my room
Angels all over
That watch over you
When I'm walking on water
All my dreams have come true
Still, nothing means nothing
Without you, you

You give me a reason
Something to believe in
I know, I know, I know
You give me a meaning
Something I can breathe in
I know, I know, I know
It's a bittersweet feeling
Longing and I'm leaving
I go, I go, I go
Tell my heart to lie
But I know deep inside it's true
That I wish I was there with you
That I wish I was there with you
Oh, I wish I was there with you

You give me a reason
Something to believe in
I know, I know, I know
You give me a meaning
Something I can breathe in
I know, I know, I know
It's a bittersweet feeling
Longing and I'm leaving
I go, I go, I go
Tell my heart to lie
But I know deep inside it's true
That I wish I was there with you
That I wish I was there with you
Oh, I wish I was there with you
