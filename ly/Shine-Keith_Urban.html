		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mmhmm, mmhmm

I can see it in your eyes and feel it in your touch
I know that you're scared, but you've never been this loved (mmhmm)
It's a long shot, baby, I know it's true
But if anyone can make it, I'm betting on me and you (mmhmm)
Just keep on moving into me
I know you're gonna see
The best is yet to come

And don't fear it now, we're going all the way
Where that sun is shining on a brand new day
It's a long way down, and it's a leap of faith
But I'm never giving up
'Cause I know we got a once in a lifetime love, oh-ooh

Everybody's looking for what we've found
Some wait their whole life and it never comes around, uh-huh
So don't hold back now
Just let go of all you've ever known
You can put your hand in mine

And don't fear it now, we're going all the way
Where that sun is shining on a brand new day
It's a long way down, and it's a leap of faith
But I'm never giving up
'Cause I know we got a once in a lifetime love

I close my eyes, and I see you standing right there
Saying, "I do," and they're throwing the rice in our hair
Yeah, the first one's born and a brother comes along, and he's got your smile
I'll be looking back on the life we had still by your side

So don't fear it now, we're going all the way
Where that sun is shining on a brand new day
It's a long way down, and it's a leap of faith
But I'm never giving up, no
And don't fear it now, I'll never let you go (oh, I'll never let you go)
When you're by my side, I know I made it home
It's a long way down, and it's a leap of faith
But I'm never giving up
'Cause I know we got a once in a lifetime love

Lifetime love
Ooh, oh
It's a lifetime love, oh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Oh, oh
