		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Strangest wilderness inside
The heart drifts from hot to cold
You think it can't make up its mind
But suddenly it's always known
Suddenly it's always known

And if I could reach the Northern Lights
Maybe then I'd understand it all
Sometimes I try so hard to fight
When all I want to do is fall
Into the night
Into your arms, surrender

Delays on the District line
Looking at pictures on my phone
And I said I didn't miss you but I lied, mm
Told myself I let you go
Told myself I let you go

And if I could reach the Northern Lights
Maybe then I'd understand it all
Sometimes I try so hard to fight
When all I want to do is fall
Into the night
Into your arms, surrender (ooh)
Surrender (ooh)
Surrender (ooh)

And if I could reach the Northern Lights
Maybe then I'd understand it all
Sometimes I try so hard to fight
When all I want to do is fall
Into the night
Into your arms, surrender

Into the night
Into your arms, surrender
