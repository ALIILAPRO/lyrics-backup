		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't see
The girl behind the first impression
We don't get deep
'Cause you prefer the surface tension

You'll go out, dress up in pastels
I'll say I feel like myself and we won't question a thing
We're skin to skin in my car
Won't bring it up in the dark like happy's all we could be

Nobody breaks up in the backseat
It's another night of putting it off
Just wanted somebody to want me
And I guess that's all I got
It's easy for you, got nothing to lose
If needing me's the last thing you'd do
Just wanted somebody to want me
And I guess that's all I got

So, is this it?
Parking lots and our half-hearted
Conversation, I'm dangerously patient
It's fine for a while, the illusions fading

But since we're skin to skin in my car
Won't bring it up in the dark

Nobody breaks up in the backseat
It's another night of putting it off
Just wanted somebody to want me
And I guess that's all I got
It's easy for you, got nothing to lose
If needing me's the last thing you'd do
Just wanted somebody to want me
And I guess that's all I got

All I got 
All I got 
And I guess that's all I got
Just wanted somebody to want me
And I guess that's all I got
