		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Found my teeth in the backroom
Just falling out
Sometimes I act so fucking dumb
These broken legs, still you walk on
And the ways, over broken glass
And I'll try, I'll try always, always
Found my sun over on six street
And fill my cup, so invincible
Always looking on with these broken eyes
Just a judgment call
Riding high in this lifeless boat
Questioning the hold
Pictures are found lately in every hour

Traveling far to find my way
These roads are followed anywhere
I always thought it so short
We would carry on

And I'll try i'll try
For a beginning an old beginning

Forgiving yourself the winters
Acceptance, acceptance
Pictures are found lately in every hour

Calling you out speak your mind
It's not a fall it's the falling out
Tables will turn on you now without spinning
But I fought with heart this time
And I'll try i'll try
For this one for this one
Traveling far to find our way
These roads are lone, anywhere
I always started so short we will carry on
Because we fought with heart this time
