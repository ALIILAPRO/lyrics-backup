		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here she comes again
Troubles on her brow
Here she comes again
With worries she can't hide

Who can stop the rain
Pouring down inside?
Who can keep her sane
Give her peace of mind?

Here she comes again
Covered up in black
Such a pretty face
Such sorrow in her eyes

Do you wanna know
What's killing her inside?
Do you dare to walk
Through alleys of her mind?

Here she comes again
Troubles on her brow
Here she comes again
With worries she can't hide

Will you let it show?
Will you cross the line?
Will you take her home
And tell her she'll be fine?
