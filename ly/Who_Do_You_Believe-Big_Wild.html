		  Who do you believe?
Who do you believe?
Who do you believe?
Who do you believe?

Running 'round in circles
Shouting at the screen
There's no in between
Who do you believe?

(I know what I see)
Running 'round in circles
(I know what I see)
Shouting at the screen
(I know what I see)
There's no in between
(I know what I see)

Who do you believe?
(I know what I see)
Running 'round in circles
(I know what I see)
Shouting at the screen
(I know what I see)
There's no in between
(I know what I see)

Who do you believe?
(I know what I see)
Running 'round in circles
(I know what I see)
Shouting at the screen
(I know what I see)

I know what I see

Who do you believe?
Who do you believe?
Who do you believe?

Who do you believe?
Who do you believe?
Who do you believe?
