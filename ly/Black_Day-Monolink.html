		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I saw the dawning of a black day
I heard it calling through the trees
They gave me sugar to stay silent
Rewarded miles to bend my knees
Into the darkness that I see
 
We all went down to see the fire
The seven houses were at war
And the flames climbed high into the night
To fill their empty hands with light
In a state of mind, we keep walking blind
Into the darkness that I see
 
I saw the dawning of a black day
I heard it calling through the trees
They gave me sugar to stay silent
Rewarded miles to bend my knees
Into the darkness that I see

That I see
That I see
That I see
That I see
That I see
That I see 
Into the darkness that I see
