		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Thinking about quitting, thinking it's time now
Thinking it's all over, quiet in my mind
Everybody's laughing, everybody's sure
Nothing seems likely, nothing's unknown

Did you ever feel like everything's falling
To fly like an eagle into the dawning
You know I always feel like the blinds are drawing
To fly like an eagle and deaths are reborn and

Hey hey, my my, everything's gonna be alright
Hey hey, my my, everything's gonna be just fine

Maybe I'm grieving maybe i'm dead
Maybe I'm leaving hearts like lead
Something feels missing something ain't right
Remember first kissing my heart felt white

Did you ever feel like everything's falling
To fly like an eagle into the dawning
You know I always feel like skies are falling
to fly like an eagle and deaths are reborn and

Hey hey, my my, everything's gonna be alright
Hey hey, my my, everything's gonna be just fine

Oh nothing last forever
Oh nothing suits me better
Oh I don't feel so clever
But I'm trying to improve, oh

So hey hey, my my everything's gonna be alright
Hey hey, my my, everything's gonna be just fine

Hey hey, my my, everything's gonna be alright
Hey hey, my my, everything's gonna be just fine

Did you ever feel like everything's falling (yeah)
To fly like an eagle into the dawning (ooh)
You know I always feel like skies are falling (ooh)
Fly like an eagle and deaths are reborn and
