		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't like to talk, but I love to sing
I don't smoke, but I love to drink
I'm paranoid, I don't miss a thing
But I'm still nice, at least that's what I think
Fall in love, like I'm a freak
But then I pull out, and say "I need freedom, I need freedom" (Woah-woah)

I guess I take it, heartbreaker
A title, I can't shake it, can't fake it
I guess I take it, heartbreaker
A title, I can't shake it, can't fake it

Oh baby, I'd rather be hard to love
Than easy to leave, you should believe me
I'll make you need me (Listen)
I'd rather be hard to love
Than easy to leave, you should believe me
I'll make you need me (yeah)

'Course you love me, you don't know me
But I got news for you, I came broken
Ego issues, my head is swollen
I got a million chips on my shoulder
But if you stay despite all I showed you
Then maybe you don't need freedom, freedom

I guess I take it, heartbreaker
A title, I can't shake it, can't fake it
I guess I take it, heartbreaker
A title, I can't shake it, can't fake it (yeah-yeah-yeah)

Baby, I'd rather be hard to love
Than easy to leave, you should believe me
I'll make you need me (whoo)
I'd rather be hard to love
Than easy to leave, you should believe me
I'll make you need me

Go deep, baby, go deep
I love it when your roots go deep so I know you won't leave
Go deep, baby, go deep
I love it when your roots go deep so I know you won't leave
Go deep, baby
I like being ugly, that way if they love me
I know that they love me for real (whoo)
I like being ugly, that way if they love me
I know that they love me for real (Listen)
I like being ugly, that way if they love me
I know that they love me for real (woah-woah)
I like being ugly, that way if they love me
I know that they love me for real

Go deep, baby (woah-oh-yeah-yeah-yeah)
Go deep (woah now, woah now)
Go deep baby
Go deep

Oh my God, that feels nuts on it's own
That shit feels like fucking
That shit feels like, that shit feels like some ego tripping shit
