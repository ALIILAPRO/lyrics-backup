		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you're feeling under pressure 
and something has been on your mind 
you gotta have yourself a good time 
take a look and you just might find 

Pushin' it on, it on, it on 
Pushin' it on, it on, it on 
Pushin' it on, it on, it on 
I'm pushin' it on! 
(It on, it on) 

Let me hear you 
Time has been hard for you baby 
this I know, this I know! 
But if you look you will find 
that is just a matter of time 
before the rhythm gets into you 
you you, ehy! 

Pushin' it on, it on, it on 
Keep pushin'
Pushin' it on, it on, it on 
Keep pushin', keep pushin
Pushin' it on, it on, it on 
Keep pushin' it on

I'm pushin' it on! 
(It on, it on) 

Let me hear you!
