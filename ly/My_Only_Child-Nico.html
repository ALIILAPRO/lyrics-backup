		  Cease to know or to tell
Or to see or to be your own
Cease to know or to tell
Or to see or to be your own
Have someone else's will as your own
Have someone else's will as your own

You are beautiful and you are alone
You are beautiful and you are alone

Often the adolescent plague
Reward your grace
Often the adolescent plague
Reward your grace

Confuse your hunger capture the fake
Confuse your hunger capture the fake

Banish the faceless reward your grace
Banish the faceless reward your grace
