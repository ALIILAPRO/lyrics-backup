		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Remember when) when it was 1992
Two little kids stealing records, skipping school
We must have been like only ten
Taking life for granted 'til we learned it had an end (remember when)
Time is something they say you never appreciate till you age
Until this day you never knew, I wanted to be just like you

If I only knew
Then what I know now
Then what I know now
If I only knew
Then what I know now
Then what I know now

(Remember when) when it was 2002
You started slinging coke and got the dopest pair of shoes (pair of shoes)
But yo, this house just ain't a home
Since our father hit the bottle and our mother hit the road
Time is something they say you never understand until it slips away
And looking back I think you knew, I wanted to be just like you

If I only knew
Then what I know now
Then what I know now
If I only knew
Then what I know now
Then what I know now

And now I'm tired of the violence
I'm so tired of the sirens
And it's better me, better me than you (than you)

Now I'm tired of the violence
I'm so tired of the sirens
And it's better me, better me than you

Slipping and we're falling, slipping and we're falling
Through our lives (through our lives)
Slipping and we're falling
Don't know where we're going with our lives (with our lives)

If I only knew
Then what I know now
Then what I know now
If I only knew
Then what I know now
Then what I know now

Now I'm tired of the violence
I'm so tired of the sirens
And it's better me, better me than you (than you)

Now I'm tired of the violence
I'm so tired of the sirens
And it's better me, better me than you

(Remember when) slipping and we're falling, slipping and we're falling
Through our lives (through our lives)
Slipping and we're falling
Don't know where we're going with our lives
Slipping and we're falling, slipping and we're falling
Through our live
