		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everybody knows all the highs and all the lows
And in that nothing ever goes right
It's not up to me if you look but you don't see
What could obviously be alright

Like goin' nowhere, like goin' nowhere baby, nowhere baby
Like goin' nowhere, like goin' nowhere

It's a vision, not religion
And the truth is plain to see
It's a feeling, it's revealing
Nowhere you can hide
So don't blame me

There's no guarantee what you get is what you see
Don't try to find it, just don't try
Don't try living in the past
If you want the dream to last
Don't hide behind the mask of lies

Like goin' nowhere, like goin' nowhere baby, nowhere baby
Like goin' nowhere, like goin' nowhere

It's a vision, not religion
And the truth is plain to see
It's a feeling, it's revealing
Nowhere you can hide
So don't blame me, don't blame me
Don't blame me, don't blame me

Deep inside of me lives a hunger to be free
I know I'll have to pay the price
I may never know when it comes or when it go
I guess it's just a part of life?

Like goin' nowhere, like goin' nowhere baby, nowhere baby
Like goin' nowhere, like goin' nowhere

It's a vision, not religion
And the truth is plain to see
It's a feeling, it's revealing
Nowhere you can hide
So don't blame me, don't blame me
Don't blame me, don't blame me
Don't blame me, don't blame me
Don't blame me, don't blame me
Don't blame me, don't blame me
