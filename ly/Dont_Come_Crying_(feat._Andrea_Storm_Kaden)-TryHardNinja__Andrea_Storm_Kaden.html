		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey hey now everyone we have a new guest
There goes another one that I put to rest
Here in the underground I have to confess
There's no place oh-whoa quite this dark no-o whoa
But I'll be here with you, along for the ride
Where nightmares are all real so try not to cry
Okay I take it back I really don't mind
No escape oh-whoa from your fate no-o whoa

Makes you wonder doesn't it
Which one of us opposites
Is the weak baby here
I think it's pretty clear

So don't come crying to me
Don't come crying don't come crying crying
Don't come crying to me
Don't come crying don't come crying, baby
Don't come crying to me
Don't come crying don't come crying, crying
Don't come crying to me
Don't come crying don't come crying when it hurts

Down down below we go so follow me quickly
This time I pull the strings, my puppet how lovely
Hang onto every word this plan is too easy
Watch it play ay-yee-ay here on the stage
Are you ready for my performance tonight
Under the lights under the lights whoa oh-oh-oh
Did you really think that I'd let you survive
Another night another night no-oh-uh-oh

So don't come crying to me
Don't come crying don't come crying crying
Don't come crying to me
Don't come crying don't come crying, baby
Don't come crying to me
Don't come crying, don't come crying, crying
Don't come crying to me
Don't come crying, don't come crying when it hurts

Oh you thought that you could control me
Oh you thought I was yours to own me
You can cry but you listen closely
Baby I'm sorry I'm not sorry

Makes you wonder doesn't it
Which one of us opposites
Is the weak baby here
I think it's pretty clear

So don't come crying to me
Don't come crying don't come crying crying
Don't come crying to me
Don't come crying don't come crying baby
Don't come crying to me
Don't come crying don't come crying crying
Don't come crying to me
Don't come crying don't come crying when it hurts
