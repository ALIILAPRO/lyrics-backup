		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (JoeFromYO)

Why you always wanna go and talk about my old hoes?
Why you gotta take it there, places that we don't go?
You know things about me everybody doesn't know
Don't you know my money's unfair?

I hope you hear me clearly, hope you feelin' me (feelin' me)
Dapper Dan dashiki, Gucci on my sleeve (woo)
I'm facin' all my fears, I'm facin' Hennessy (Hennessy)
I'm higher than a bitch, I'm smokin' mad dope (smokin' mad dope, shh)
What the fuck is that sound?
Even when she walk, it make a clap sound
If we don't see nobody, we spin back 'round
Brought the MAC out, everybody sat down (ah)
Why wanna always go and bring up all my old hoes?
Girl, you know my body, stop actin' like you don't know
You know everything (you know everything)
She want wedding bands for rings (give you a wedding ring)
Way she throw it back, she make it ricochet (woo)
Where you goin'? I wanna see you everyday, yeah
Let a nigga ever try to take my chain (huh?)
Might get in my bag before you get away
I brought the MAC out, everybody sat down (sat down)
Hit it from the back, she makin' clap sounds
I'm so sick of all these love songs
But I cannot turn off the radio

Why we always gotta go and talk about my old hoes?
Why we gotta take it there, places that we don't go?
You know better, stop actin' like you don't know
Don't you know my money's unfair?

Where you been? Switchin' up locations on me daily
You the one that changed
Told you not to call me "Boogie" only call me "Baby"
Say my name like you really care, care
But you don't, and it's alright
Fuck it, I'ma be a fly nigga forever
When you with your girls, I swear you feelin' yourself (oh, oh)
And then I'm with the fellas, you be actin' jealous, so jealous (oh, oh)
I left in a Wraith, then I came back home in a Bentley (oh, oh)
With glitter on my face, askin' mad questions already (oh, oh)
Baby, don't be fake, you love me, just say you love me (oh, oh)
You know you're my baby (oh), know you're my territory (oh, ah)
Around the Yankee stadium, yeah, that's my territory (ah)
I got it on my chain, paid like one-eighty somethin' for it (nah, nah)
All my niggas crazy, I swear they will kill you for it
You tell me I'm crazy, but you probably love me for it

Why you always gotta go and talk about my old hoes?
Why we gotta take it there, places that we don't go?
You know shit about me everybody doesn't know
Girl, you know my money's unfair
