		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In the morning, I'll go down the graveyard
To make sure you're gone for good
To make sure you won't hurt again
May you rest in peace

Pony riding, sushi cooking
Oh, may you be where you wanted
Oh, we talked about it
After one or two beers

And the worst days that life brings
All the bad movies, and all the earthquakes
All the worst days are just buried 
Into the snow

Holy water, plastic flowers
In the end you got what you were
Always running after
Always running after

And the worst days that life brings
All the bad movies, and all the earthquakes
All the worst days are just buried 
Into the snow

And the worst days that life brings
All the bad movies, and all the earthquakes
All the worst days are just buried 
Into the snow

And the worst days that life brings
All the bad movies, and all the earthquakes
All the worst days are just buried 
Into the snow

All the worst days are just buried 
Into the snow
All the worst days are just buried 
Into the snow
