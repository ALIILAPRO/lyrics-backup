		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Set me free, why don't you babe?
Get out my life, why don't you babe?
You really don't want me, you just keep me hanging on
You really don't need me, you just keep me hanging on

Why do you keep coming around, playing with my heart?
Why don't you get out of my life
When seeing you just breaks my heart again
There ain't nothing I can do about it

You know I need love
Set me free, why don't you babe?
Talkin' 'bout love
Get out my life, why don't now?
You really don't want me, you just keep me hanging on

Get out my life, why don't you babe?
Get out my life, why don't you babe?
