		  Know we be steppin' on shit, this that steppin' music right here
Grrt, come on

Step one, you catch a opp make sure you wet one (come on)
Step two, never turn right, until you left one (until you left his ass)
Glizzy nickname Yoga, how Glock stretched him (grrt) 
Niggas say they steppers, but couldn't pass when we test them (when we test them, yeah)
We be steppin' (steppin' on shit, nigga)
We be steppin' (y'all know the fuck goin' on)
We be steppin' (steppin', bitch, we be steppin')
We be steppin' on shit

Shots hit his tummy, he paralyzed, he can't walk no more (can't walk)
What's-his-name got hit all in his shh, he can't talk no more (shh)
Baghdad told me buy him the K, he don't want the Glock no more (don't want the Glock no more)
He don't even want that bitch no more, fuck
We stay bendin' blocks, I think the opps tryna play hide and seek (come on)
We the ones seekin', they the ones hidin', it ain't hard to see (what the fuck)
Chasin' niggas down, drive-by who? We hoppin' out on feet (we hoppin' out on feet)
Lil' bitch come eat, I ain't tryna talk, I stuffed her lips with meat (bitch)
Look, I ain't tryna wife you (no), bitch, I barely like you (bitch, I barely like you)
Box who? I'ma just shoot, I ain't finna fight you (I ain't finna fight you)
Switch it up, you see us in a fishbowl, just know them switches tucked (you know they on)
Better be cool and be smooth, you think 'bout flippin' us

Step one, you catch a opp make sure you wet one (come on)
Step two, never turn right, until you left one (until you left his ass)
Glizzy nickname Yoga, how Glock stretched him (grrt) 
Niggas say they steppers, but couldn't pass when we test them (when we test them, yeah)
We be steppin' (steppin' on shit, nigga)
We be steppin' (y'all know the fuck goin' on)
We be steppin' (steppin', bitch, we be steppin')
We be steppin' on shit

Step right, nigga hit him first and hit his candle light (hey)
Walk him down, caught him at his bitch house, it's a body found
All I need is fifty round (fifty), with a switch it's like a hundred rounds
Dead man, I just put a fifty on his headband
SIGs and Dracos in this bitch, we ready for war like Pakistan (SIGs)
My best man, he just like Gin√≥bili, shoot with his left hand (swish)
Niggas ain't gettin' no get-back, when we spin, we got the top man (hey)
Top boy, actin' like you got bricks, you need to stop, boy
Hot boy, nigga be talkin' that rah-rah, choppa stop noise
Shh (shh), ain't no talkin' no more
Nigga be talkin' like bitches, I pull out the switches, I bet he can't walk no more (hey)
But he got caught at the light, he got hit with the pipe, and we uppin' the score some more
Play with the wrong niggas, we started spankin' them niggas, they ain't playin' no more (spank)
I got a short temper, payin' for bodies, but really nobody don't know
Poppin' like you really 'bout it, let's go
I turn an opp to a pack and I smoke (hey)

Step one, you catch a opp make sure you wet one (come on)
Step two, never turn right, until you left one (until you left his ass)
Glizzy nickname Yoga, how Glock stretched him (grrt) 
Niggas say they steppers, but couldn't pass when we test them (when we test them, yeah)
We be steppin' (steppin' on shit, nigga)
We be steppin' (y'all know the fuck goin' on)
We be steppin' (steppin', bitch, we be steppin')
We be steppin' on shit
