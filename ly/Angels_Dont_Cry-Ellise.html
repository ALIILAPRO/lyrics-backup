		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Two angels, both alike in divinity
Lailah cries in the clouds
Lilith burns beneath
The only flame burning brighter
Than the clash of seraphim
Is the light of true love
 power of immense esteem
When the warden is regal
True love is always pure
But when the warden is evil
True love's flame casts burns

(Whimpering, crying)

Crystal skies, pearly gates
When I cross my heart I look both ways
Cause you know you need my help most days
And I can't watch you fall
Play on broken strings
But the ugly world has clipped your wings
You need someone to forgive your sins
And I'm there when you call

Devil's on your shoulder tryna
Make you insane (Mmm, mmm)
And it's startin' to get hard to
Make it all go away (Mmm, mmm)
Putting Heaven in an empty heart (Mmm, mmm)
Is it worth all the pain?

Save your life
Made me do it for you every time
But angels don't cry
No, angels don't cry (Huh) close your eyes
Let me handle it, I'll be alright
Cuz angels don't cry no, angels don't cry

(Mmm, mmm) (Mmm, mmm)
(Mmm, mmm)

Watch my halo shine
Hold you bloody while I'm dressed in white
Kiss it better for the hundredth time
And your hurt becomes mine

Devil's on your shoulder tryna
Make you insane (Mmm, mmm)
And it's startin' to get hard to
Make it all go away (Mmm, mmm)
Putting Heaven in an empty heart (Mmm, mmm)
Is it worth all the pain?

Save your life
Made me do it for you every time
But angels don't cry
No, angels don't cry (Huh) close your eyes
Let me handle it, I'll be alright
Cuz angels don't cry no, angels don't cry

(Mmm, mmm) (Mmm, mmm)
(Mmm, mmm)

Save your life
Made me do it for you every time
But angels don't cry
No, angels don't cry (Huh) close your eyes
Let me handle it, I'll be alright
Cuz angels don't cry no, angels don't cry

I might lose my mind, lose my mind
Tryna save your life
I'll just fake a smile, dry my eyes
Cuz angels don't cry no, angels don't cry
