		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sixteen years without even a place to call my own
But I'll dry my tears looking for a place to rest my bones
All these years but never changed the one that I have known
And despite my fears I'm sure that I can make it on my own

Quality drugs and limousines oh momma this is killing me
I'm half the man I used to be oh oh (ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)
To give to lust and gambling, oh momma I need rescuing
What sixteen years has done to me oh oh (ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)

Sixteen years burning every bridge that I have known
Without you here, the world has gotten colder on my own

Quality drugs and limousines oh momma this is killing me
I'm half the man I used to be oh oh (ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)
To give to lust and gambling, oh momma I need rescuing
What sixteen years has done to me oh oh (ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)

There's nothing like it I'm going away
There's nothing like the feeling
Of being alone now on a New York street
Gives everything some meaning
There's nothing like being torn apart
From a love you've known right from the start
There's nothing like this feeling

There's nothing like it I'm going away
There's nothing like the feeling
Of being alone now on a New York street
Gives everything some meaning
There's nothing like being torn apart
From a love you've known right from the start
There's nothing like this feeling

Quality drugs and limousines oh momma this is killing me
I'm half the man I used to be oh oh (ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)
To give to lust and gambling, oh momma I need rescuing
What sixteen years has done to me oh oh (ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)

It's what sixteen years has done to me oh oh (ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)
It's what sixteen years has done to me oh oh (ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)
