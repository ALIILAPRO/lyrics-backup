		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Am I mad at what you did? I don't think so
Am I mad at what you did? I don't think so
Am I mad at what you did? I don't think so
But should I be? But should I be? But should I be?

It's on you
What side's your favorite to sleep on?
They said I'm not trippin', and I cannot
Baby, you call me at late night
If late night, you call me, I answer
You call me, I pick up, I pull up
You know we'd abuse it, it's fucked up
Why can't I escape you? Why can't I?
You hurt me, you trick me, and still I
I give you the world undeservin', nah
Hurtin' me, blessin' you all the time, woah

Am I mad at what you did? I don't think so
(Don't think so, don't think so, don't think so)
Am I mad at what you did? I don't think so
(Don't think so, don't think so, don't think so)
Am I mad at what you did? I don't think so
(Don't think so, don't think so, don't think so)
But should I be? But should I be? But should I be?

When it rains it pours, forty eight floors
I need more, take off and soar
What I have in store for you is grand and can't be torn
Goin' back in time and makin' it fine, measurin' lines
I'm wrappin' it tight, secure your love, your love
And when you're mine, better not divide my mind
Can't ignore the signs, this time
I gotta do right by you, no, by me

Am I mad at what you did? I don't think so
(Don't think so, don't think so, don't think so)
Am I mad at what you did? I don't think so
(Don't think so, don't think so, don't think so)
Am I mad at what you did? I don't think so
(Don't think so, don't think so, don't think so)
But should I be? But should I be? But should I be?
