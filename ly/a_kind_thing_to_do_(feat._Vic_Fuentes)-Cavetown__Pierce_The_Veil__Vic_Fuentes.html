		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take myself by the hand, join the queue
What am I doing outside my bedroom?
Just felt like a kind thing to do
Just felt like something you

Would do for me
You do for me
You do for me
You do for me
I do for you too

Take myself by the hand, join the queue
What am I doing outside my bedroom?
Just felt like a kind thing to do
Just felt like something you

Would do for me
You do for me
You do for me
You do for me
I do for you too

I know something you don't know
I know something you don't know
I can't see you dancing round my living room
To the same shit that you're always listening too
Is it crazy to hope that we get there soon?
You can't save me
And I will keep on saving you

You save me like a vine
Want it all, but you just get me a bite
And with the necessary pressure applied
'Cause darling I was long gone
Think you might have saved my life

Take myself by the hand, join the queue
What am I doing outside my bedroom?
Just felt like a kind thing to do
Just felt like something you

I can't see you dancing round my living room (would do for me, would do for me)
To the same shit that you're always listening too (you do for me, you do for me)
Is it crazy to hope that we might get there soon?
You can't save me
And I will keep on saving you
