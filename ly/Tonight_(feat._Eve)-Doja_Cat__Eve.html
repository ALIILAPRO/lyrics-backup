		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know you're going home to your lady tonight
So baby, can you just be with me tonight?
I know that it seems wrong and crazy tonight
So baby, can you just be with me tonight?

Baby got mystery and I got history
Don't get too into me, you could get in too deep
Head past the settle down, knock 'til you're out of town
I just wan' f- right now, scared it might get around
I like what I like, you like what you do
You see my eyes, boy, I just can't keep 'em off you
Turnin' me on, I-I just can't see through you
God bless your girl 'cause this feeling, it is voodoo

I know you're going home to your lady tonight
So baby, can you just be with me tonight?
I know that it seems wrong and crazy tonight
So baby, can you just be with me tonight?

Mh, tonight
Mhm, tonight
Oh, mmh, tonight (haha, yo)
Ohh-mmh, tonight

Ayo, had a dream about you knockin' on my door
And then we end up kickin' it with you up in my arms
Every time she ringin', you not answering the phone
Said you'd be a minute and still ain't made it home
Let's get it on tonight
Blame it on the liquor, we don't know what's wrong from right
Meltin' on me, ice cream, baby, slip and slide
Are you changin' your clothes or are you changin' your mind?
'Cause we both know there's only one place you'll be goin'
Baby, down to the garden, have you eatin' them greens
Got you speakin' in tongues, mi amor, E-V-E
Long as you ready to drive, limousine, Doja Cat

I know you're going home to your lady tonight (yeah)
So baby, can you just be with me tonight?
I know that it seems wrong and crazy tonight
So baby, can you just be with me tonight?

Mh, tonight
Mhm, tonight
Oh, mmh, tonight
Ohh-mmh, tonight
