		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The light was shining on your face
I drew a map so I could plan out my escape
The hands are circling on my watch
Another minute just a prisoner of my thoughts

What if it all goes wrong, like it usually does?
I'm still playing tug of war between my head and heart
(Between my head and heart)

Just another night biting my tongue
Too afraid to talk, so the words get lost
Should've said it when the night was young
Scared of breaking my heart shooting for the stars

We were listening to a song (listening to a song)
It's like they stole the lyrics straight out of my thoughts
Sang every word I couldn't say (I couldn't say)
I hope you noticed, but you never sang along

Of course it always goes wrong, like it usually does
I'm still playing tug of war between my head and heart

Just another night biting my tongue
Too afraid to talk, so the words get lost
Should've said it when the night was young
Scared of breaking my heart shooting for the stars

Just another night biting my tongue
Too afraid to talk, so the words get lost
Should've said it when the night was young
Scared of breaking my heart shooting for the stars
Just another night biting my tongue
Scared of breaking my heart shooting for the-
Shooting for the stars
