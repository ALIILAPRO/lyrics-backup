		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let me see you go back (move, it's the L-I-Y-A-H)
Let me see you come forth
Now let me see you go back (move, it's the L-I-Y-A-H)
Let me see you come forth, uh
Let me see you go back (move, it's the L-I-Y-A-H)
Let me see you come forth, uh
Let me see you go back (move, it's the L-I-Y-A-H)
Let me see you come forth, yeah

It's Friday (hey) and I'm ready to swing
Pick up my girls and hit the party scene
Tonight, oh, it's alright
So get up and let this funky mellow groove
Get you in the mood
'Cause you know it's alright, yeah

So Mister DJ, keep the music groovin' (keep on groovin')
Don't stop movin' (don't stop movin')

Let me see you, let me see you go

Back, back, forth and forth (go back, let me see you go)
Back, back, forth and forth (alright, I wanna see you go)
Back, back, forth and forth (come on, let me see you go)
Back, back, forth and forth (see you go back and forth)

Now's the time for you to make your move
To the dance floor (oh)
So throw your hands in the air (yeah)
And wave 'em round like you just don't care (wow), yeah
Ooh, it's the L-I-Y-A-H? Rippin' up the stage
I got jazz personality, G mentality, beats to Soul Train

So Mister DJ, keep the music groovin' (keep on groovin')
Don't stop movin'

Now let me see you back and forth, back and forth

Back, back, forth and forth (oh-ooh)
Back, back, forth and forth (oh-ooh)
Back, back, forth and forth (back, back, forth and forth)
Back, back, forth and forth (come on and let me see you go)

Hey, here's the formality, get up on the floor you see
Show your personality, be who you want to be
Tell me

So can you feel the groove movin' way down to you?
Hey, I wanna keep this party goin' on all night

So Mister DJ, keep the music groovin' (keep on groovin')
Don't stop movin' (don't stop movin')
Now let me see you go back and forth, back and forth

Back, back, forth and forth (alright, let me see you go)
Back, back, forth and forth (go back, back, forth and forth)
Back, back, forth and forth (bring it back, take it forth)
Back, back, forth and forth (alright)

Back, back, forth and forth
Back, back, forth and forth
Back, back, forth and forth
Back, back, forth and forth

Let me see you go 
Move, it's the L-I-Y-A-H
Move, it's the L-I-Y-A-H
Move, it's the L-I-Y-A-H
Move, it's the L-I-Y-A-H
(Back, back, forth and forth) move, it' the L-I-Y-A-H
