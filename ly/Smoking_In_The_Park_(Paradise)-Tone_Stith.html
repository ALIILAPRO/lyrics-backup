		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Smoking in the park, underneath the trees
Perfect time for me to set you free
Underneath the stars, feels just like a dream
A dream, a dream, a dream
Oh, oh-oh
Ooh

Paradise (paradise)
I'll take you wherever you wanna go
Come find me, I can be your therapist (come find me, I can be your therapist)
All the weight on your heart, you can lay it on my shoulders
Ooh, you can show me all your flaws and insecurities (you can show me all your flaws)

We can't see the haters, we're too high out here
And if you're free, you can pull up on me later, at our spot
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

Smoke one in the park, underneath the trees
Perfect time for me to set you free (free, free, free, free)
Underneath the stars, feels just like a dream
A dream, a dream, a dream
Oh, oh-oh
Ooh

Ooh, ooh-ooh
Oh
Ooh-woah, ooh-woo, ooh
Yeah, yeah

We can't see the haters, we're too high out here (we're too high)
And if you're free, you can pull up on me later, at our spot
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

Smoking in the park (hey), underneath the trees (ooh)
Perfect time for me to set you free (free, free, free, free, yeah, ayy)
Underneath the stars (underneath the stars), feels just like a dream (feels just like a dream)
A dream, a dream, a dream
Oh, oh-oh
Ooh
