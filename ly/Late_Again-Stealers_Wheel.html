		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Late again, when I get home you'll be waiting.
Still you know there ain't no use in you complaining.
I know that I can show some respect, especially when I'm wrong.
But when I get back I know you'll say, You've been away too long.

Ooooh, la-la-la, oooh...
I wonder why I stay when everybody's gone, yeah,
There's always something there, that keeps me hanging on.
