		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is such a perfect place
I'm glad I found this with you
Our love reflected in your face
Only heaven can beat this view

Come on, let's run and get lost in the crowd
Into the light as the night's comin' down
I'm double-tappin', I'm focusin' now
We're focusin' now

I see love
I see love around me
From a river to a flood
I see love around me (love around me)

I love you, helped me find my heart
I didn't even know my name
Then I was blinded by the dark
My eyes will never look the same

Come on, let's run and get lost in the crowd
Into the light as the night's comin' down
I'm double-tappin', I'm focusin' now
We're focusin' now

I see love
I see love around me
From a river to a flood
I see love around me (love around me)
I see love
I see love
From a river to a flood
I see love around me (love around me)

Come on, let's run and get lost in the crowd
Into the light as the night's comin' down
I'm double-tappin', I'm focusin' now
We're focusin' now

I see love
I see love around me
From a river to a flood
I see love around me (love around me)
I see love
I see love
From a river to a flood
I see love around me
I see love
