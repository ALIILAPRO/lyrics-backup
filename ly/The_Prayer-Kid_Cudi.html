		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ah-da-da-da-da-da-da-nah
Ba-ba-ba-ba-da-ba-da
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
(Plain Pat, what up?)

My heart thump not from being nervous
Sometimes I'm thinking God made me special here on purpose
So all the while 'til I'm gone make my words important, so
If I slip away, if I die today 
The last thing you remember won't
Be about some Apple Bottom jeans with the boots with the fur
Maybe how I dream of being free since my birth
Cursed, but the demons I confronted would disperse (disperse)
Have you ever heard of some shit so real? (Real, real, real, real)
Beyond from the heart, from the soul you can feel (feel, feel, feel)

And if I die before I wake
I pray the Lord my soul to take
But please don't cry
Just know that I have made these songs for you
And if I die before I wake
I pray the Lord my soul to take
'Cause I'm ready for the funeral (uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh)

My mind runs, I can never catch it even if I got a head start
God please help me, I am feeling so alone, wait
I don't need to worry 'cause I know the world'll feel this nigga
Blessing in disguise but I am not hiding who I am 
Open your eyes, bruh, if I ever met you
I appreciate the love, yo
Girls that I dated, it's okay I am not mad, yo
Unless you stabbed me in the heart, no love, ho
This shit is so ill (ill, ill, ill, ill)
Play it back from the top if you recognize real (real, real, real)

And if I die before I wake
I pray the Lord my soul to take
But please don't cry
Just know that I have made these songs for you
And if I die before I wake
I pray the Lord my soul to take
'Cause I'm ready for the funeral

And if I die (and if I die) before I wake (before I wake)
I pray the Lord (pray the Lord) my soul to take (my soul to take)
But please don't cry (please don't cry)
Just know that I (know that I) have made these songs for you
And if I die (and if I die) before I wake (before I wake)
I pray the Lord (pray the Lord) my soul to take (my soul to take)
'Cause I'm ready ('cause I'm ready) for the funeral (yeah)

I'm ready for that (for that)
Ready for the funeral, ayy, ayy
I'm ready for the funeral, ayy
I'm ready for the funeral
Ayy
I'm ready for the
I'm ready for it
I'm ready for the funeral
