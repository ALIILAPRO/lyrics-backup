		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Once upon a time
There were scenes that we didn't mind, oh
I'd hop in for a ride, movin' fast
Never lookin' backwards
Play our favorite songs
Does the words still make you feel the same? Oh
Once upon a time, drivin' fast, never lookin' back

I know that I know how to find words
Say 'em out loud
I'm done lettin' myself down
My heart came from the right place
I don't want to cause heartache
But my mind just couldn't translate
How to deal with these emotions
Can start fire and still get burned
And then I'll fuel it like I ain't learn
'Cause it hurts me if I hurt you
So I hurt you, so you hate me
But you won't leave, I can't get out

How you held me, oh
I hope that you see
There's no way you'd know
How, how you helped me

Now I'm drivin' fast
Like the way that you used to drive, oh
I'd jump into your bed
Live your days, they were never mine
Tell me why the light stayed on red
That must have been a sign
All these little things that we missed
We'll get over in time

You taught me about patience
Raised all my expectations
You showed me what's my ground
I stand here and I look down
On myself and I'm so proud
Thank you 'cause I've figured out
What's best for me is on my own now
It's been a while and I'm grown now
But I'd never grown if you weren't 'round
You've shown me what's meant to be
What's meant for you is not meant for me
And we'll find out in this next life

How you held me, oh
I hope that you see
There's no way you'd know
How, how you helped me
