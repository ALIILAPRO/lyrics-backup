		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I ain't got no money
I ain't like those other guys you hang around
It's kinda funny
But they always seem to let you down
And I get discouraged
'Cause I never see you anymore
And I need your love, babe, well
That's all I'm living for, yeah

I didn't want to pressure you, baby
But all I ever wanted to do

I wanna be your lover
I wanna be the only one that makes you come running
I wanna be your lover
I wanna turn you on, turn you out
All night long, make you shout
Oh, lover, yeah
I wanna be the only one you come for

I wanna be your brother
I wanna be your mother and your sister, too
There ain't no other
That can do the things that I'll do to you

And I get discouraged
'Cause you treat me just like a child
And they say I'm so shy, yeah
But with you I just go wild, ooo ooo ooo

I didn't want to pressure you, baby, oh
But all I ever wanted to do

I wanna be your lover
I wanna be the only one that makes you come, running
I wanna be your lover
I wanna turn you on, turn you out
All night long make you shout
Oh, lover, yeah
I wanna be the only one you come for, yeah
