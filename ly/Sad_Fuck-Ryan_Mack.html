		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I’m a sad fuck
Self sabotage and I mess things up
Always in my feelings and my head too much, yeah
But i don't always wanna be a sad fuck
Looking for excuses to not show up
Always feeling like I’m never good enough, yeah I don’t always wanna
be a sad fuck
Yeah, I have bad nights
But I’m not a bad guy (duh)
Billie Eilish I might make your mama sad type
and I’ve been doing well
But I get overwhelmed
As soon as I compare myself to everybody else
Why’s it always when I close my eyes? Overthinking and I don’t know
why
I’m not saying that I hate my life
I just wish that I was happy sometimes, 'cause
I’m a sad fuck
Self sabotage and I mess things up
Always in my feelings and my head too much but i don't always wanna
be a
sad fuck
Looking for excuses to not show up
Always feeling like I’m never good enough, yeah I don’t always wanna
be a sad fuck
yeah, yeah
Always say I’m gonna change
I never do, everything is overdue
Running late every day
Overthinking every move (Hey!)
"What you sad for, who you feeling bad for? "
"Why you so upset, when you got everything you ask for?"
Ain't it funny how they think I'm fine?
Just 'cause I got everything they see online
Now, I'm not saying that I hate my life
(I just wish that I was happy sometimes 'cause)
I’m a sad fuck
Self sabotage and I mess things up
Always in my feelings and my head too much, yeah but i don't always
wanna be a sad fuck
Looking for excuses to not show up
Always feeling like I’m never good enough, yeah I don’t always wanna be a
sad fuck
Self sabotage and I mess things up
Always in my feelings and my head too much but i don't always wanna be a
sad fuck
Looking for excuses to not show up
Always feeling like I’m never good enough, yeah I don’t always wanna be a
sad fuck
