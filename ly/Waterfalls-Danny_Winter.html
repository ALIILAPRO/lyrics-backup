		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Where the water falls down
(Yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, uh)
(Yeah, yeah)
Where the water falls down
(Yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, uh)
(Yeah, yeah)
Where the water falls
I need to find you
Right now, I need to find you
I've been losing it, losing it
So through with this, through with this, yeah
Come and refresh me
I've been damn tired of stressing
I need direction, oh I need direction
I need to find my way back to you
I'm out of touch now
Wandering through the brush now
Don't care what they think, won't dare to lose sleep
Worried about if I'mma make it
I mean they're right, yeah they're all right
Probably won't last 'til the moonlight
I'm calling out, I need you to meet me there
Where the water falls down
(Yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, uh)
(Yeah, yeah)
Where the water falls down
(Yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, uh)
(Yeah, yeah)
Where the water falls
Oh I've been searching for too long
I'm tired out, I need to know if I'm gon' make it to you, yeah
So give me one sign, or give me something I can reach to
'Cause I don't think that I can survive
Running, running all night long
Running, running all night
I'm getting caught in the vines
Strangled by the thoughts that's in my head
Fears I'm never gonna find you when I'm there
Fears I'm running out of time to make it there
I've been trying to reach you
Trying to reach you there
I've been trying to reach you there
I've been, trying to meet you there
Where the water falls down
(Yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, uh)
(Yeah, yeah)
Where the water falls down
(Yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, uh)
(Yeah, yeah, mmm)
Where the water falls
Ooh,
Ooh, yeah somehow
I'm going to find you
I'm going to find you
Ooh, I'm going to find you
I'm going to find you,
I'mma find you there
