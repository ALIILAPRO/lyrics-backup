		<p>
		  Oh I can't hear what you're sayin'
When I know it's noise you've been making
Dulling down my light won't work no more
Careful you could burn your eyes
For once hear me out
Quit talking, it's drainin'
(Quit talking, Quit talking)

Nobody believes it, but you know I'm right!
(But you know I'm right, but you know I'm right, yeah)
My confidence is peaking, can you feel the light?
(Can you feel the light, can you feel the light, yeah?)

Just open your mind!
Just open your mind!

Don't let them bite your ears too much
Get down, dodge them voices from being heard
Dulling down my light won't work no more!
Careful you could burn your eyes!
For once hear me out
Quit talking, it's drainin'
(Quit talking, Quit talking)

Nobody believes it but you know I'm right!
(But you know I'm right, but you know I'm right, yeah)
My confidence is peaking, can you feel the light?
(Can you feel the light, can you feel the light, yeah?)

Just open your mind!
Just open your mind! 

Just open your mind 
It's different, so different 
Picture it, picturesque! (x2)
(Just open your mind)
Nobody believes it, but you know I'm right!
(Just open your mind, It's different, so different) 
My confidence is peaking, can you feel the light?
(Just open your mind, It's different, so different)

Just open your mind!
Just open your mind!
