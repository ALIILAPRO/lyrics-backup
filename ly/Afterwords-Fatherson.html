		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  After words I'll talk first
Oh I think I really did everything I really did
After words I'll talk first
Call it a believer, say it is a thing

You know, you know, you know, you know, why
I know I know I know
It's uncomfortable
Call it an after thought

But I'm tired of sleeping alone
(I am)
I'm tired of sleeping alone
(I am)

These nights all I do is look for you
And I never really see it through
I leave believing that you're on your own

I touch the sky and then set alight
Maybe you were right
It's uncomfortable
Call it an afterthought

Maybe we, are a wild fire
Maybe we, are a wild fire.

But I'm tired of sleeping alone
(I am)
But I'm tired of sleeping alone
(I am)

After words I'll talk first
Oh I think I really did everything I really did
Maybe we are a wild fire, maybe we are a wild fire.
