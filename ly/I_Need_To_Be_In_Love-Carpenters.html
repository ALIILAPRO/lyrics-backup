		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The hardest thing I've ever done
Is keep believing
There's someone in this crazy world for me
The way that people come and go
Through temporary lives
My chance could come and I might never know

I used to say, no promises
Let's keep it simple
But freedom only helps you say goodbye
It took a while for me to learn
That nothin' comes for free
The price I've paid is high enough for me

I know I need to be in love
I know I've wasted too much time
I know I ask perfection of a quite imperfect world
And fool enough to think that's what I'll find

So here I am with pockets full of good intentions
But none of them will comfort me tonight
I'm wide awake at four a.m.
Without a friend in sight
Hanging on a hope, but I'm alright

I know I need to be in love
I know I've wasted too much time
I know I ask perfection of a quite imperfect world
And fool enough to think that's what I'll find

I know I need to be in love
I know I've wasted too much time
I know I ask perfection of a quite imperfect world
And fool enough to think that's what I'll find
