		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There goes my mind

There's no hope for me this time

It's stuck on you

Lets dive in into the blue

You're pulling me in like a satellite

Oh let's dance all through the night

We're spinning around in space and time

You and I together

Just like a satellite

No black holes in sight

Blindfold me and I wouldn't fight

Lets fly high but don't go far

Coz my Love is where you are

You're pulling me in like a satellite

Our green hill, meet me there

Theres a postcard with a riddle in

People can stop and stare

In my world you're in the middle

You're pulling me in like satellite

Oh let's dance all through the night

We're spinning around in space and time

You and I together

Just like a satellite

Oh your love lights up the sky

Nobody else could shine so bright

You and I together

Just like a satellite
