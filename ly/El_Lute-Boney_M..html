		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is the story of El Lute
A man who was born to be hunted like a wild animal
Because he was poor
But he refused to accept his fate
And today his honor has been restored

He was only nineteen
And was sentenced to die
For something that somebody else did
And blamed on El Lute
Then they changed it to life
And so he could escape
From then only chased him
And searched for him day and night
All over Spain
But the search was in vain
For El Lute

He had only seen the dark side of life
The man they called El Lute
And he wanted a home
Just like you and like me
In a country where all would be free
Though he taught himself
To read and to write
It didn't help El Lute
He was one who had dared to escape overnight
They had to find
El Lute

Soon the fame of his tale
Spread like wild fire
All over the land
Were the prize on his head
People still gave him bread
And they gave him a hand
For they knew he was right
And his fight was their fight

No one gave you a chance
In the Spain of those days
On was every place
They had put up the face of El Lute
And he robbed where he could
Just like once Robin Hood
They finally caught him
And that seemed the end
But they caught him in vain
'Cause a change came for Spain
And El Lute

He had only seen the dark side of life
The man they called El Lute
And he wanted a home
Just like you and like me
In a country where all would be free
And then freedom really came to his land
And also to El Lute
Now he walks in the line
Of a sunny new day
The man they call El Lute
