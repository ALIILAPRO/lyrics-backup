		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're near, that moment's here
I'm almost in your arms
Tonight, the mood is right
I'm almost in your arms
One sigh, one word and I
Will rush to your embrace
Say that certain word
Sigh that certain sigh
And with all my heart
To your arms I'll fly
It's strange how we are changed
By things that seemed so small
One look can write a book
One touch can say it all
We've known those nights alone
And now we've found our way
I'm almost in your arms
Almost in your arms
Almost in your arms
Almost in your arms
You're near, that moment's here
I'm almost in your arms
Tonight, the mood is right
I'm almost in your arms
One sigh, one word and I
Will rush to your embrace
Say that certain word
Sigh that certain sigh
And with all my heart
To your arms I'll fly
It's strange how we are changed
By things that seemed so small
One look can write a book
One touch can say it all
We've known those nights alone
And now we've found our way
I'm almost in your arms
I'm nearly in your arms
Almost in your arms
I'm nearly in your arms
Almost in your arms today
