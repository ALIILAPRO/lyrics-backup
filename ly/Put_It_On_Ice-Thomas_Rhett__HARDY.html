		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What do you do when you got ain't nothin' to do?
You put on that smell good, tuck them jeans down in those boots, aye
You hit the drive thru, you get the number five
You hit the cornfield up in them four-wheel drive

Girls bring the pretty, boys bring the Yeti
Everybody circled up out in a Ford or Chevy
Talkin' Bud Light or heavy, cranking Hank or Petty
The good times just ain't ready

'Til you put it on ice, put it on ice, put it on ice
And drink it down
Grab your girl, tip your hat
Grab that jar and pass it 'round
'Til we ridin' White Lightning
That's when everybody vibin'
Put it on ice, put it on ice, put it on ice
And fill your cup
'Til it's spillin', catch that feelin'
To the ceiling, raise 'em up
We gettin' lit up like a downtown light
Yeah, we heatin' up the night
When we put it on ice

Ooh

Uh, yo
What do you do when you get through that 9 to 5?
Sick of backing up tractors, stacking hay bales to the sky, yeah
You hit the Mapco, you lay the cash down
You got a 24 laying in the back now

Girls bring the pretty, boys bring the Yeti
Everybody circled up out in a Ford or Chevy
Talkin' Bud Light or heavy, cranking Hank or Petty
The good times just ain't ready

'Til you put it on ice, put it on ice, put it on ice
And drink it down
Grab your girl, tip your hat
Grab that jar and pass it 'round
'Til we ridin' White Lightning
That's when everybody vibin'
Put it on ice, put it on ice, put it on ice
And fill your cup
'Til it's spillin', catch that feelin'
To the ceilin', raise 'em up
We gettin' lit up like a downtown light
Yeah, we heatin' up the night
When we put it on ice, yeah

Ooh
Oh-oh, yeah

Can't you feel it gettin' louder now, louder now
Go and pour yourself another round, 'nother round
Can't you feel it gettin' louder now, louder now
If you see it gettin' watered down

Put it on ice, put it on ice, put it on ice 
And drink it down (let's go)
Grab your girl, tip your hat
Grab that jar and pass it 'round
'Til we ridin' White Lightning (until we ridin' White Lightning) 
That's when everybody vibin' (we vibin')
Put it on ice, put it on ice, put it on ice
And fill your cup (fill your cup)
'Til it's spillin', catch that feelin'
To the ceilin', raise 'em up (raise 'em up)
We gettin' lit up like a downtown light
Yeah, we heating up the night
When we put it on ice
Oh (woo)
You put it on ice
Ooh
