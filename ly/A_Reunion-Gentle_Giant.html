		  Hear, he'll do it all for you, you will see it,
Wise and knowing what to do, what to be
And every word is 

Lies, he only tells the truth, for he means it,
Means, not anything he says, eyes unseen,
But everything is 

So sincere, so sincere, so sincere, so sin.

Yes, that is to say no, understanding
Wrong, he makes his promise right, with your hand
You'll never know why.

So sincere, so sincere, so sincere, so sincere.

So, sincere his thoughts so full, always empty
Good, or maybe things are bad, so sincere,
And every word is 

So sincere, so
