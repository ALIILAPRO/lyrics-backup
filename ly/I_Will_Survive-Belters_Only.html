		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All my love to give
And I've got so much love to get
I'll survive
I'll survive
I will, I will survive

Oh now go, walk out the door
Just turn around now 'cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble?
Did you think I'd lay down and die?

Oh no, not I (did you think I'd crumble?)
Just turn around now
Walk out the door (did you think I'd crumble?)
'Cause you're not welcome anymore
Ohh, now go (did you think I'd crumble?)
Just turn around now
Walk out the door (did you think I'd crumble?)
I will survive

Ohh, now go (did you think I'd crumble?)
Just turn around now
Walk out the door (did you think I'd crumble?)
'Cause you're not welcome anymore
Ohh, now go (did you think I'd crumble?)
Just turn around now
Walk out the door (did you think I'd crumble?)
'Cause you're not welcome anymore

Anymore, anymore, anymore (you're not welcome) anymore
Anymore, anymore, anymore, anymore

I will survive (I will survive)
Ohh, as long as I know how to love
I know I'll stay alive
'Cause I've got all my life to live 
And I've got all my love to give
And I'll survive
I will survive

'Cause I've got all my life to live 
And I've got all my love to give
'Cause I've got all my life to live 
And I've got all my love to give
'Cause I've got all my life to live (I will survive)
And I've got all my love to give 
'Cause I've got all my life to live
I will survive

Go, walk out the door
Just turn around now 'cause you're not welcome anymore 
Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye? (I will survive)
Did you think I'd crumble?
Did you think I'd lay down and die?

Oh no, not I (did you think I'd crumble?)
Just turn around now
Walk out the door (did you think I'd crumble?)
'Cause you're not welcome anymore
Ohh, now go (did you think I'd crumble?)
Just turn around now
Walk out the door (did you think I'd crumble?)
I will survive
