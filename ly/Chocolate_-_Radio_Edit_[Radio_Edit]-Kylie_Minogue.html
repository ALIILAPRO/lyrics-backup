		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fragile seams
I opened my too quick and all my dreams
Were woken up, I slowly lost my fire
With every single man, a river cried
I had no sensation
Completely numb, left with no satisfaction
I thought no one could ever get me high again
I swear, I was not looking

Oh, waited so long
I thought the real thing was a fake
I thought it was a tool to break me down
You proved me wrong again

If love were liquid it would drown me
In a placeless place would find me
In a heart shape come around me 
And then melt me slowly down
If love were human, it would know me
In a lost space, come and show me 
Hold me and control me 
And then melt me slowly down
Like chocolate

Tastes so good
My heart's been mended 
Who'd have thought it would?
An empty bet and still I won the cash
A man who I love and who loves me back

Oh, waited so long
For love to heal me so I'd feel it
Thought it wasn't breathing, then you came
You proved me wrong again

If love were liquid it would drown me
In a placeless place would find me
In a heart shape come around me 
And then melt me slowly down
If love were human, it would know me
In a lost space, come and show me 
Hold me and control me 
And then melt me slowly down
Like chocolate

If love were liquid it would drown me
In a placeless place would find me
In a heart shape come around me 
And then melt me slowly down
If love were human, it would know me
In a lost space, come and show me (show me)
Hold me and control me 
And then melt me slowly down

Like chocolate, come here
Zoom in, catch the smile
There's no doubt it's from you
And I'm addicted to it now

Just one look, boy, to melt me down
Just one heart here to save me now
Your candy kisses are sweet, I know
Hold me tight, baby, don't let go

Just one look, boy, to melt me down
Just one heart here to save me now
Your candy kisses are sweet, I know
Hold me tight, baby, don't let go (ooh, like chocolate)

Just one look, boy, to melt me down
Just one heart here to save me now
Your candy kisses are sweet, I know (ooh)
Hold me tight, baby, don't let go (oh)

Just one look, boy, to melt me down
Just one heart here to save me now
Your candy kisses are sweet, I know (if love were liquid)
Hold me tight, baby, don't let go

If love were liquid it would drown me
In a placeless place would find me
In a heart shape come around me 
And then melt me slowly down
If love were human, it would know me
In a lost space, come and show me 
Hold me and control me 
And then melt me slowly down

If love were liquid it would drown me
In a placeless place would find me
In a heart shape come around me 
And then melt me slowly down
If love were human, it would know me
In a lost space, come and show me 
Hold me and control me 
And then melt me slowly down
Like chocolate
