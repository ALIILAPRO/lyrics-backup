		  Remix
Off the corner with the money, I got a bird's eye
(Cook that shit up, Quay)
Saint Jhn, Pluto Hndrxx
(Told Lee he'd be a millionaire)

Roses
I walked in the corner with the body screaming dolo
Never sold a bag but look like Pablo in a photo
This gon' make 'em feel the way like Tony killed Manolo
You already know though, you already know though
I walk in the corner with the money, on my finger (yeah)
She might get it popping, I might wife her for the winter (sure)
I already know, already know, nigga roses
All I need is roses

Turn up baby, turn up, when I turn it on (turn up, turn up)
You know how I get too lit when I turn it on (turn up, turn up)
Can't handle my behavior when I turn it on
Too fast, never ask, if the life don't last
Done been through it all (whoa)
Fuck with a nigga raw, this who you wanna be (let's go)
And I know you won't tell nobody nothing (tell nobody)
And I know you won't tell nobody no

Roses
I might pull up flexing on these niggas like aerobics (wow)
I might tell her girl you cute but balling, that shit gorgeous (whoa)
Standing on the table, rose, rose, fuck the waters (wow)
You know who the God is

Turn up baby, turn up, when I turn it on (turn up, turn up)
You know how I get too lit when I turn it on (turn up, turn up) (turn it on)
Can't handle my behavior when I turn it on
Too fast, never ask, if the life don't last
Done been through it all
Fuck with a nigga raw
This who you wanna be

I might bring them Brooklyn niggas out, oh Lord, it's overs
I might bring them strippers out and tell 'em do it pole-less
You already know, 'ready know, nigga roses
Kill 'em, make it, turn up baby, turn up, when I
(You already know, you already know)

Shawty gon' turn up and get at these bands
Shawty ain't scared and she brought me a friend
Check up the temperature, I flip all this cash
Fuck up a check, did a flex on the bitch
After talkin' the shit, I'ma flex on his ho
Canary yellow, baguettes with the glow
Question his Audemar, VVS froze
Turn it up, green light, everything go
Need interpreters, I don't even talk to you hoes
I need a translator for these hoes
I got so many exotics I'm stayin' abroad
Ice, baguetties, yes (ice)
Nad, bad bitches, so cold (you already know)
Beat up the pot, she came with a key (you already know)
Emilio Pucci keep all the secrets (you already know)
Solitary diamonds, solitary
Ready to go slide in the bank
Chopper say nah-nah, my bitches complain
Omerta for the campaign

Turn up baby, turn up, when I turn it on (keep a lotta drugs)
You know how I get too lit when I turn it on (got a couple models)
Can't handle my behavior when I turn it on
Too fast, never ask, if the life don't last
Done been through it all
Fuck with a nigga raw
This who you wanna be
And I know you won't tell nobody nothing
And I know you won't tell nobody no
Roses
