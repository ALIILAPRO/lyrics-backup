		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Woman please be gone
You've stayed here much too long
Don't you wish that you could cry
Don't you wish I would die

Seamy, seesaw kids 
Child women on the skids 
The dust will choke you blind
The lust will choke your mind

I kiss the floor, one kick no more 
The pig and hose have set me free
I've tasted hate street's hanging tree
I've tasted hate street's hanging tree

I kiss the floor, one kick no more 
The pig and hose have set me free
I've tasted hate street's hanging tree
I've tasted hate street's hanging tree

I kiss the floor, one kick no more 
The pig and hose have set me free
I've tasted hate street's hanging tree
I've tasted hate street's hanging tree

I've tasted hate street's hanging tree
