		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You’re so toxic yet so full of life
But sadly it’s the pills that have fueledyourheart beat
Washed downwith the poisons that make youfeel
It’s breaking my back the pain is so surreal
Watching someone you love start to wither away
Choking down your sorrows down only furthers the decay
But don’t fake some security
You Won’t change even when You know you’re hurting me

I’ve been trying for so long
Just to make a break through
Anyone can see what’s wrong
And I’m still dying to fix you

Is this what you wanted
This fucking sickness has taken the best of me
Every night I’m haunted
Knowing that I may have missed my chance to
Save you from this emptiness
Or what’s left of you
Take the blame for everything that’s in your head
But you’re fucking wasted

What makes a difference
Do you even care how I feel
I’ve been watching you suffer
You brush it off like it no big deal
Acting like you’re dealing with all this pain
As if I’m going to cut ties and walk away
But don’t count on my feelings
I’m just a fucking pawn inside your game

I’m trying to let go of your mistakes
But that’s so hard when you’re burning at the stake
I’m not sober for my own fucking benefit
I’m trying to show the other life you can live
You’ve began Painting pictures to keep us away
“I’m fine” another lie are you feeling afraid
Any day you will fade into your distain
Do you even listen to what I have to say
Why, do you turn away
Why, won’t you fucking change

I’ve been trying for so long
Just to make a break through
Anyone can see what’s wrong
And I’m still dying to fix you

Is this what you wanted
This fucking sickness has taken the best of me
Every night I’m haunted
Knowing that I may have missed my chance to
Save you from this emptiness
Or what’s left of you
Take the blame for everything that’s in your head
But you’re fucking wasted

Why, can’t I let you die
Instead I watch you burn
And piss away your fucking life
And I can’t save you from this emptiness
Or what’s left of you
And I won’t take the blame for everything that’s in your head
Cause you’re fucking wasted
