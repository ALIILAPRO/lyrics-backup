		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Close your eyes and exit life tonight
You'll be just fine, you'll be alright
It's time we start escaping
Fever dream, the lights are fading

Don't look around
At all the faces abound
Don't look behind you
'Cause we are stuck underground
Can you see the words I'm up here trying to preach?
No need to cry, you'll never find me trying to leave

'Cause I see that you're in pain
From your pale and lifeless face
So let go and float away
Let go, let go, let go and

Close your eyes and exit life tonight
You'll be just fine, you'll be alright
It's time we start escaping
Fever dream, the lights are fading
Take my hand to Neverland
You'll see we can be free
We can be anything, just you and me
Fever dream, the lights are fading

I can't hear a sound
I see the world upside down
Tell me how it's fair
To put a loved one underground
Now can you see the words I'm up here trying to preach?
No need to cry, don't say goodbye
I'll see you on the other side
I'll see you on the other side

And I see that you're in pain
From your pale and lifeless face
So let go and float away
Let go, let go, let go

Close your eyes and exit life tonight
You'll be just fine, you'll be alright
It's time we start escaping
Fever dream, the lights are fading
Take my hand to Neverland
You'll see we can be free
We can be anything, just you and me
Fever dream, the lights are fading

Follow me into this fever dream
We can be anything and everything
We want to be if we believe
Letting go of what we used to know
We can be anything and everything
Just follow me into this fever dream
Into this fever dream

Close your eyes and exit life tonight
You'll be just fine, you'll be alright
It's time we start escaping
Fever dream, the lights are fading
Take my hand to Neverland
You'll see we can be free
We can be anything, just you and me
Fever dream, the lights are fading

Follow me into this fever dream
We can be anything and everything
We want to be if we believe
Letting go of what we used to know
Oh, fall asleep and make believe
With me, we're gonna be alright

So close your eyes
Just say goodnight
