		<p>
		  Brrah-bah-bah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Hounds, make that shit slap)

Skeet skeet, throw it on repeat
Concrete, no, you can't move me (yeah)
3D, everybody see me (nuh-uh)
CDs, pass 'em on 6th Street
Beep, beep, driving down Main Street
Stepping on the beat, brrah-bah-bah (yeah)
My girl walks out and she looks so good
You get knocked down but you can't get up (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Skeet skeet, throw it on repeat
Stepping on the beat, brrah-bah-bah (yeah)
My girl walks out and she looks so good
You get knocked down but you can't get up (yeah, yeah, yeah)

Baby, I've been drinking all night (all night)
I don't gotta ride, so I'm gonna call a life line (life line)
Auntie Anne, we ain't blood related
So I fold her like a pretzel, bitch, I'm going mental
Shawty surely giving brain, call her Shirley Temple
If you need a bad bitch, you can get a rental
Riding with my dogs, we be coolin' in the kennel
Worldwide hoes, call me Jimmy Contintental
'Bout to eat it up and I ain't even got utensils (no, no)
Fuck up in her mouth and now I'm fucking with her dental (yeah, yeah)
Fuckin' on her throat, now she got tonsillitis
Touch my dick once, now I call the bitch Midas (woo, woo, woo)
Ayy, Jack be nimble, Jack be quick (ho)
Your mom know how to handle dick (sheesh)
Jack got dimples, Jack be slick
Jack got jumped and he dropped all six (ayy, ayy)
Like ooh, yeah, all six
Trap more wax than a candlestick
And he snagged your bitch
And I'm Jack and I gave her that

Skeet skeet, throw it on repeat
Concrete, no, you can't move me (yeah)
3D, everybody see me (nuh-uh)
CDs, pass 'em on 6th Street
Beep, beep, driving down Main Street
Stepping on the beat, brrah-bah-bah (yeah)
My girl walks out and she looks so good
You get knocked down but you can't get up (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Skeet skeet, throw it on repeat
Stepping on the beat, brrah-bah-bah (yeah)
My girl walks out and she looks so good
You get knocked down but you can't get up (yeah, yeah, yeah)

Skeet, skeet, put it on repeat
Bust on her face and her best friend retweet
Gravy take your bitch and you ain't gettin' a receipt
Hit the ho once then I ghost like a ouija
Bored, I be bored, I be feeling like a whore
I be looking at her eyes while she screamin' out, "More"
On tour, I'm with Gravy, get your tickets at the door
Mi amor, I'm in love, give her kissety kiss
I got your bitch licking lickety-split (woo)
I hit that shit to some Elliott Smith (yah)
I'm in the Tesla, the miracle whip (damn)
And I got your bitch sayin', "Brrah-bah-bah"
Calling out, pop off, feeling like a hot shot
Motherfuckers want it but they never getting nada
Smoking in the hot box, stuck inside the fuckin' Lincoln tunnel
I could do it if I wanna but I'm drinking
What can I say, living today
Passing my blunt to my baby
She don't even smoke but she hit that shit for me
We roll with my crew and we coming 'bout forty
I'm sipping

Skeet skeet, throw it on repeat
Concrete, no, you can't move me (yeah)
3D, everybody see me (nuh-uh)
CDs, pass 'em on 6th Street
Beep, beep, driving down Main Street
Stepping on the beat, brrah-bah-bah (yeah)
My girl walks out and she looks so good
You get knocked down but you can't get up (yeah, yeah, yeah)
