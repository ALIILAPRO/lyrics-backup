		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell me something that I don't know
Give me nothing but love and hope
I hope I can find my paradise
 
cnd deep down under, and all I've seen
Beyond the wonders, and still I dream
I know I can make that sacrifice
cnd what is hopeless and what is real?
I wish I knew how I feel
I hope I can find that love inside
Give me shelter, bring me along
There's a place where we all belong
Still I wonder, where's my paradise?
 
cnd I hope I find my paradise
cnd I hope I find my paradise
 
Out of the darkness, show me the way
We all get lost, we've all been astray
Hold me close and tell me everything's alright
The world keeps turning, the sun goes down
c moment of silence, the greatest sound
Still I wonder, where's my paradise?
 
cnd I hope I find my paradise
cnd I hope I find my paradise
 
cnd the road it goes
cnd your soul it knows
Takes me back to where we started
When you're all alone, follow your heart of gold
They say that home is where the heart is
 
I wonder where the wind it blows
The reason why it blows so cold
Spent half a lifetime slowing down
But growing up is getting old
I'd rather feel at home than be alone tonight
 
When all the rain keep falling down
The world don't stop from spinning round
What's in your heart, it's hard to find
But getting lost is being found
I hope I can find my paradise
 
cnd I hope I find my paradise
cnd I hope I find my paradise
cnd I hope I find my paradise
cnd I hope I find my paradise
