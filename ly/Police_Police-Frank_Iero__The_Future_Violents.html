		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Unimpressed by the ignorance we choose to commend
Disgraced by the hate we love to embrace
The pursuit of happiness is a fucking right
The pursuit of happiness is a fucking right 
Killing time in the places I want to forget
Needing time in the places I want to spend time
Doing time in the places I want to forget
Needing time in the places I want to spend time

Life cleared the light from my eyes
And wiped the smirk from my face it won't be seen anymore
If I let my time go to waste, I'll know the pills by their taste
They help us hide who we are

Leave what's left for the ones who are doomed to come next 
Leave what's left for the ones who are doomed to come next 
Killing time in the places I want to forget
Needing time in the places I want to spend time
Doing time in the places I want to forget
Needing time in the places I want to spend time
The pursuit of happiness is a fucking right 
The pursuit of happiness is a fucking right
The pursuit of happiness is a fucking right
The pursuit of happiness is a fucking right
 
Life cleared the light from my eyes
And wiped the smirk from my face it won't be seen anymore
If I let my voice go to waste, I'll know the pills by their taste
They help us hide who we are

No more silence while children scream, locked in cages built overseas
No more silence while children scream, locked in cages built overseas 
Every time we condone another version of hate we get farther from god
I know you're tired I know you tire
Life cleared the light from my eyes, and wiped the smirk from my face
It won't be seen anymore
(Take it, it's yours)
(Take it, it's yours)
(Take it, it's yours)
(Take it, it's yours)
