		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Woo
This shit for life (Hey), money get stripes (Stripes)
Fuck all the hype (Hype), I keep a pipe (Bow)
The streets is shiest'
Believe in Christ 'cause I'm livin' a good life (Hey, hey)

Vogue when I put on all my clothes (Drippin', drippin')
Niggas called me stupid when I first proposed (Stupid, stupid)
Niggas, they been hatin', yeah, months ago (Hate, hate)
Fuck 'em, get the money and no clout, no trolls
She a bad bitch, but she don't got no goals (Bad)
Ain't no counterfeit when I lift up the door (Skrrt)
They askin' for a pic, but they sixty years old
Shit pretty big, when the elders really know (Hey)

I was just underrated, then I turned to a beast (Hey)
Eat you like a gator when you stuck up in the streets (Ahh)
I got 4 kids and they mouths gotta feast (Feast)
Get a lick on the north and I sold it on the east (East)
I know I'm a dawg 'cause I'm gettin' money and it's different (Different)
Type of money that my dawg says somebody in it (Tripping)
Had to put the price up on my dawg, stole the pendant (Who)
Beggin' and repentin', fuck it, hit him with the semi (Bah, Offset)

Swimming through these blues (Blues)
Tryna get more richer than the Jews (Jews)
Ain't no books, in the bookbag it's a Uzi (Ain't no books)
Why your bitch look at me, Suzie choosy (Suzie choose)
You can't get a bankroll sittin' in the house
Marble in the floor and the kitchen all top (Marble)
Migo, he a plug and he look like J Balvin (Plug)
Fake smiles, fake hugs, man that shit ain't even allowed (Nah)
Shit gettin' real, my brother facin' a trial (Real)
God 'bout revealed the devil is nothing but lies (God)
Willie been gone for 13 years, time fly (Woo)
And I got millions, same color as the sky (Hey, hey)

I was just underrated, then I turned to a beast (Hey)
Eat you like a gator when you stuck up in the streets (Ahh)
I got 4 kids and they mouths gotta feast (Feast)
Get a lick on the north and I sold it on the east (East)
I know I'm a dawg 'cause I'm gettin' money and it's different (Different)
Type of money that my dawg says somebody in it (Tripping)
Had to put the price up on my dawg, stole the pendant (Who)
Beggin' and repentin', fuck it, hit him with the semi (Bah)

Numbers don't lie, but these niggas lie (Numbers)
Money to the sky, that's a Millie Rock (Sky)
Have your family survive, what it's really 'bout (Survive)
They say it was a homicide, what you talkin' 'bout? (Who)
Yeah, we got bombs in the spot like a nuke (Bomb)
I might fuck your mom, kinda bad, kinda cute (Who)
Drippin' in Milan, Paris Fashion Week a fool (Dripping)
Like I'm Barry Bonds how these hits comin' through (Hits)
Copy what I do, they eat it up, they gon' chew (Copy)
Bought a hundred acres, I got horses, I got mules (Copy)
Trappin' out the vacant, ain't no water, ain't no food (Who)
I just bought a condo at the W, what a view

I was just underrated, then I turned to a beast (Hey)
Eat you like a gator when you stuck up in the streets (Ahh)
I got 4 kids and they mouths gotta feast (Feast)
Get a lick on the north and I sold it on the east (East)
I know I'm a dawg 'cause I'm gettin' money and it's different (Different)
Type of money that my dawg says somebody in it (Tripping)
Had to put the price up on my dawg, stole the pendant (Who)
Beggin' and repentin', fuck it, hit him with the semi (Bah)
