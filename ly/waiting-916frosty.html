		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (But hey what do I know?
Don't know who to follow, Only seventeen
She drinking from the bottle)
(We can make it, promise
Only if you want to)
(You can be the painting
I can be the artist)
(But hey what do I know? Don't know
Who to follow, Only seventeen
She drinking from the bottle)
(We can make it, promise
Only if you want to)
(You can be the painting
I can be the artist)

Why keep on lying to my face?
Thought we were in a better place
I tried to keep it to myself
Now she's fucking with someone else
RIP juice, said, "All these girls the same"
Day one, I put that in my brain
Never trust, it's only lust
Love comes, then fades in the dust

Take the memories, you can have them
Still can't wrap my head all around this
Every single time this gonna happen
Lied on my line, now you a has-been
Never felt like this, in that summer
Let's go back to when we were lovers
Can't believe I let you cut through me
Next girl promised she gonna use me
Life goes on
(Ayy, ayy, ayy) and the leaves lose color
Had a dream where my kids called you mother
(Woah, yeah)
Taking my heart, threw it in the gutter
I I ain't tryna deal with a bitch
Not another ('Nother)
Thought we had a plan not to end like this
She would go to school while
I made these hit's saying that you loved me
You were biting your lip
Add another name to the ex-bitch list
Feeling like you're on top of the world
Next day, you're back in the dirt
Should've never been fuckin' with her
(Woah) so I packed my bags and go
To a place that got no hope
You're the only thing that I know
(You're the only thing that I know)

We-we-we both knew that this would never last
Now you just another from the past
You ain't who you're supposed to be
Fuck it, you're the girl of my dreams
You can kill me but you're
Never gonna change me (Change me)
Turn around and say goodbye to my baby (Woah)
Think I love you even more when you hate me
How you leave me in the
Rain when I'm waiting?

When I saw her, I was chilling at the party
She love me and she love to pop molly
Never really got to tell her that I'm sorry
Drive away all the pain in the 'Rari
But hey what do I know?
Don't know who to follow (Wah)
Only seventeen, she drinking from the bottle
(Wah)
We can make it, promise, only if you want to
(Wah)
You can be the painting, I can be the artist
Like that (yeah) 
How can I act like I'm doing just fine?
It was all love until you hit my line
Until you hit my line

You you will never leave
You you you will never leave
You will never leave
We hope you've enjoyed this
Journey through stars

Take the memories, you can have them
Still can't wrap my head all around this
Every single time this gonna happen
Lied on my line, now you a has-been
Never felt like this, in that summer
Let's go back to when we were lovers
Can't believe I let you cut through me
Next girl promised she gonna use me
