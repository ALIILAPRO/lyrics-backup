		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I walk on my own to think it over
I can't believe this is real
It all seems so clear
All seems so right
I can't put on words how I feel
In time you'll see
What you mean to me
Everyday I think of you

There's nothing here in the world
That can replace you,no
There's nothing here in the world
I can face without you,no

I'm lost in your eyes
You dream me away from here
Far away, where I can feel no pain
With you i feel safe
I know you keep me out of harms way
In time you'll see
What you mean to me
Everyday I think of you

There's nothing here in the world
That can replace you,no
There's nothing here in the world
I can face without you

Anytime you doubt with us
Makes you wanna run away
You think of what we have
If it feels like everything goes there away
I'll be standing here

There's nothing here in the world
That can replace you
There's nothing here in the world
That can replace you,no
there's nothing here in the world
I can face without you

Nothing in this world can replace you
There is nothing
There is nothing
There is nothing
