		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Automaton drone
You're lost with no phone
And the home you made your own
Can never be paid for
The great in the small, the rise and the fall
And you come back for more

The need to belong
And the will to do no wrong
The ones that you lost, abandoned or crossed
Will haunt you

Plagued by poor health
But you stockpile more wealth
Congratulate yourself
A sense of proportion, an act of extortion
There's too much distortion

You sink in stages
As you're approaching middle ages
You're up to here in debt
Insidious tech, you're up to your neck
Why don't you give it a rest?

A train set, a cold war threat
A prison
A poison nest, a chrome cassette
Division
The blue and white, a power strike
A girl you like
The daylight fades, you feel your way
Daguerreotype

A train set, a cold war threat
A prison
A poison nest, a chrome cassette
Division
The blue and white, a power strike
A girl you like
The daylight fades, you feel your way
Daguerreotype

Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

The power of nature
And the oppression of strangers
The consequence of dread 
(Ah-ah-ah-ah)
A barbarous brain, a dominant strain
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
You'll never win this game

It seems I'm miles above the surface of the earth
I can see across the whole of London and beyond
Ships and thunderstorms at sea and beyond
A trillion stars in a billion galaxies
I gaze out across the millennia 
it took the lights from these stars to reach the earth
I close my eyes
And breathe

I came here searching for something
But I don't remember what that thing is anymore
Did I dream you?
Or are you dreaming me now?
As your waking thoughts gradually take over
As all dreams are ultimately forgotten
And lost
