		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fuck you, bitch, I'm here all by myself
I tried the belt
But couldn't get it tight enough
So I smoke the blunt, my lungs are rust
My brain is dust from all of these drugs
I can't think straight, I'll walk the plank
Spill my blood so sharks will come and eat me
(And eat me) whole!
In between Hell and Earth, I do the limbo
My body alive, but my mind is dead
Going through the motions
All of them emotions
Dump me in the ocean, I'm drowning again
We don't have to pretend

Okay, here we go, blade to my throat
Whole floor soaked with blood from a goat
Bag full of dope, room full of smoke
All black coat with a wolf for a cloak
Do you feel my essence? Depressing presence
My main goal in death is to blow up heaven
Don't get the message, can't teach the lesson
Just a feeling that you get
When you hang with peasants
Ridin' down Crescent
My weapon is oh-so-sharp and ready
Ward of the 7th
The legend is that you won't see twenty
Me and Lil Uzi full of cruelty
Just a product of the times
The fucking highly almighty, the G, the 5
The 9
