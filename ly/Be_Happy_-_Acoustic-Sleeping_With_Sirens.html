		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I spent my whole life dreaming up
Some perfect world, but now I'm stuck
These words I sing for the ones I love
Draw a line that define the best in us
With every note and every page
I'm cleaning up each mess I make
Is there some way for me to prove that
I won't bring out the worst in you?

Can anyone else relate?

I should be happy, but I'm not
Is there a way to make it stop?
It won't go away, it keeps haunting me
As colors fade, I start to change
I only have myself to blame, 'cause
I should be happy but I'm not
Can anyone else relate?

I saw the light when I was young
I always knew that I would be someone
But I fall short and I fucked things up
And now I'm paying for the things I've done
I can't escape the feeling
Now I'm staring at the ceiling while I waste away
Could be better off alone, might be better on my own
But I know I'm not okay 'cause

I should be happy, but I'm not
Is there a way to make it stop?
It won't go away, it keeps haunting me
As colors fade, I start to change
I only have myself to blame, 'cause
I should be happy but I'm not
Can anyone else relate?

Can't escape the feeling
Now I'm staring at the ceiling while I waste away
Might be better off alone, I'd be better on my own
But no I'm not okay, I'm not okay
Go

As colors fade, I start to change
I only have myself to blame
As colors fade, I start to change
I only have myself to blame

I should be happy, but I'm not
Is there a way to make it stop?
(Just make it stop)

I should be happy but I'm not
Is there a way to make it stop?
It won't go away, it keeps haunting me
As colors fade, I start to change
I only have myself to blame, 'cause
I should be happy but I'm not
I should be happy but I'm not

So kill the pain and make it stop
Can anyone else relate?
Can anyone else relate?
Can anyone else relate?
Just make it stop
