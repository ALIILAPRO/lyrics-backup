		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I have never wished and hoped
Didn't need a telescope
To see where I am going
I have never been the one
Trying hard to hold my tongue
Is my stereo on

One day I'll stand with a crown on my head
Like a God yeah, like a God
With every step, no, I won't second guess what I want

I wanna be like Kanye
I'll be the king of me always
Do what I want and have it my way
All day, like Kanye ah, yeah, yeah
Like Kanye, Kanye, yeah yah, yeah yah
I'll be the king of me

From a broken home, okay
Single momma let me chase what I was made for
We be out to Paradise, build on nickels and dimes
I'm entitled to so much more

One day I'll stand with a crown on my head
Like a God yeah, like a God
With every step, no, I won't second guess what I want

I wanna be like Kanye
I'll be the King of me always
Do what I want and have it my way
All day, like Kanye-eah, yeah, yeah

I'll be the king of me, me, me
I'll be the king of me, me, me
Like Kanye, Kanye, yeah yah, yeah yah

I have never wished and hoped
Didn't need a telescope
To see where I am going
I have never been the one
Trying hard to hold my tongue
Is my stereo on

I wanna be like Kanye
Do what I want I'll have it my way
I wanna be like Kanye

I'll be the king of me, me, me
I'll be the king of me, me, me
Like Kanye, Kanye, yeah yah, yeah yah
