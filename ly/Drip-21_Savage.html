		<p>
		  Aquafina drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip
Baby got that water, I'm tryna sip, sip, sip, sip
She want a young nigga selling bricks, bricks, bricks, bricks
Drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip

Aquafina drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip
Baby got that water, I'm tryna sip, sip, sip, sip
She want a young nigga selling bricks, bricks, bricks, bricks
Drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip

Aquafina drip, when she dancing all the real niggas gonna tip
I got the same kinda guns like TIP, plus I'm hood rich like Rip
I ain't never seen a ass so fat, she want a young nigga selling crack
I'm dripping I'm dripping I'm dripping all over this track
If he is not dripping then we gonna run off with his pack
VVS dripping these ain't crystals, your jeweler disappoint he selling crystals
I hear your baby daddy work at Krystal's, 
I hope you brush your teeth before you kissed him
21

Aquafina drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip
Baby got that water, I'm tryna sip, sip, sip, sip
She want a young nigga selling bricks, bricks, bricks, bricks
Drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip

Aquafina drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip
Baby got that water, I'm tryna sip, sip, sip, sip
She want a young nigga selling bricks, bricks, bricks, bricks
Drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip

I'm whipping work, I done spilled baking soda on my shirt
I'm smoking OG, you smoking purp
Real street nigga, don't get hurt
I'm in the kitchen cooking crack like its bacon, these pussy ass rappers they be faking
I'm 21 Savage ain't no faking, AK-47 get the shaking
Don't wanna be ya man, can I fuck ya friend? I wanna fuck ya friend
Can I fuck ya twin?
Choppas on the couch, choppa bring the power
Thought he had a brick, but I sold him flour

Aquafina drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip
Baby got that water, I'm tryna sip, sip, sip, sip
She want a young nigga selling bricks, bricks, bricks, bricks
Drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip

Aquafina drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip
Baby got that water, I'm tryna sip, sip, sip, sip
She want a young nigga selling bricks, bricks, bricks, bricks
Drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip
