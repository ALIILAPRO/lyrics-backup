		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Search for the answers I knew all along
I lost myself
We all fall down
Never the wiser of what I've become
Alone, I stand
A broken man

All I have is one last chance
I won't turn my back on you
Take my hand
Drag me down
If you fall, then I will, too
And I can't save what's left of you

Sing something new
I have nothing left
I can't face the dark without you
There's nothing left to lose
The fight never ends
I can't face the dark without you

Swallow me under and pull me apart
I understand, there's nothing left
Pain so familiar and close to the heart
No more, no less, I won't forget
Come back down, save yourself
I can't find my way to you
And I can't bear to face the truth

Sing something new
I have nothing left
I can't face the dark without you
There's nothing left to lose
The fight never ends
I can't face the dark without you

I wanted to forgive
I'm trying to forget
Don't leave me here again
I am with you forever, the end

Sing something new
I have nothing left
I can't face the dark without you
There's nothing left to lose
The fight never ends
I can't face the dark without you

Holding the hand that holds me down
I forgive you, forget you, the end
Holding the hand that holds me down
I forgive you, forget you, the end
