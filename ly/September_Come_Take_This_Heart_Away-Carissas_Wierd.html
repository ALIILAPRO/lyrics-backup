		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  this room has so many windows
too many windows
I've sat and watched the trees framed to fade outside
I hope the seasons treat you well
I hope the seasons treat you kind
as kind as I never was
as comforting as I never could be
I saw 2 fake long stemmed roses
on the windshield of a car
September come please take this heart away
all of these windows
bring in the cold air
I hope you have a coat
to keep you warm
warmer than those last times we spoke
warmer than the last words we said
I'm sure the wind blows gently on you now
I hope that nothing will ever remind you of me
glue that faded photo on a worn out journal page
it reads September come, please take this heart away
