		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Moon, a hole of light
Through the big top tent up high
Here before and after me
Shinin' down on me
Moon, tell me if I could
Send up my heart to you?
So, when I die, which I must do
Could it shine down here with you?

'Cause my love is mine, all mine
I love, mine, mine, mine
Nothing in the world belongs to me
But my love, mine, all mine, all mine

My baby, here on earth
Showed me what my heart was worth
So, when it comes to be my turn
Could you shine it down here for her?

'Cause my love is mine, all mine
I love, mine, mine, mine
Nothing in the world belongs to me
But my love, mine, all mine
Nothing in the world is mine for free
But my love, mine, all mine, all mine
