		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Raise the guns
At every self made suspicion
Build the bombs
Corrupt policy's decision

That's the sound 
Of integrity breaking its back
In a country 
Founded as a thievery act

Raise the guns
At every self made suspicion
Build the bombs
Corrupt policy's decision

Times are dark/ 
With our children spoon-fed ignorance
Inheritance/ 
Of an anxious trigger finger

Raise the guns
At every self made suspicion
Build the bombs
Corrupt policy's decision

Our leaders preach if we disagree
We're the traitors of society
Homophobia, racism, and sexism
Systems breed supremacy

Ignition
Inception
Burning is a fuse to destruction
Break the walls of ignorance
To disarm the world for it's last chance

Ignition
Inception
Burning is a fuse to destruction
Break the walls of ignorance
To disarm the world for it's last chance

Time again for a war
On an enemy that isn't real
Greedy selfish warlords
Feed the agenda, death's the meal

That's the sound 
Impending fear crawling up your spine
In a country 
Where nothing is truly made clear

Raise the guns
At every self made suspicion
Build the bombs
Corrupt policy's decision

Our leaders preach if we disagree
We're the traitors of society
Homophobia, racism, and sexism
Our systems breed supremacy

Ignition
Inception
Burning is a fuse to destruction
Break the walls of ignorance
To disarm the world for it's last chance

Ignition
Inception
Burning is a fuse to destruction
Break the walls of ignorance
To disarm the world for it's last chance
