		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Got a head full of spiders
And a heart that isn't here
In a room full of liars
All my demons reappear

Broken cigarettes and bullet holes
One more to the chest and I'm alone
Nothing gets me any higher
And nothing ever will

Tried to stay sober
Tried to stay clean
Wake me when it's over
Like a bad dream

Mama doesn't call
Sister never writes
Bet you they would laugh
If I called to say goodbye

No ones gonna worry
Or notice when I'm gone
No they won't know I'm missin'
'Till they pull me out the mystic

I bet nobody can remember
What color eyes are on my face
I'm a freak, I'm a pretender
I never really had a place

Broken cigarettes and bullet holes
One more to the chest 'till I'm alone
Nothin' gets me any higher
And nothin' ever will

Tried to stay sober
Tried to stay clean
Wake me when it's over
Like a bad dream

Mama doesn't call
Sister never writes
Bet you they would laugh
If I called to say goodbye

No ones gonna worry
Or notice when I'm gone
No they won't know I'm missin'
'Till they pull me out the mystic

Tell the preacher not to pray
There's no angels where I'll go
Only pieces that are broken
Scattered dreams across the floor
I'm home

Tried to stay sober
Tried to stay clean
Wake me when it's over
Like a bad dream

Mama doesn't call
Sister never writes
Bet you they would laugh
If I called to say goodbye

No ones gonna worry
Or notice when I'm gone
No they won't know I'm missin'
'Till they pull me out the mystic

Tried to stay sober
Tried to stay clean
Wake me when it's over
Like a bad dream

Mama doesn't call
Sister never writes
Bet you they would laugh
If I called to say goodbye

No ones gonna worry
Or notice when I'm gone
No they won't know I'm missin'
'Till they pull me out the mystic
