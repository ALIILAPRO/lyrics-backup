		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When you're with me
I sink in your eyes
So comfortably, tainted in your lies
You don't need me
I see through disguise
When you're with me
I sink in your eyes
Why do you think that?
You could bleed me there
You don't know
Well fuck it, I don't care anymore
When you're with me
I sink in your eyes
So comfortably, tainting in your lies
You don't need me
I see through disguise
Oh why, oh why
Oh why, oh why
Don't you care at all?
Don't you care at all?
