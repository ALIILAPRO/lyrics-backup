		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She's a million miles away 
From me 
Separated by a hollow wooden door 
Some time we can't erase 
Serves me right 
To let her in the first time 
That she knocked 

And all this wandering 
Got you nothing 
You were ready to but 
Never could 

Things you never saw in me 
She'll see 
Observations that she'd heard from other people 
That she never understood 
Serves her right 
Not knowing just exactly what she wants 

And all this wandering 
Got me nothing 
You were ready to but never could 

Are you happy 
Wandering 

Remember sitting on your car 
That night 
Clouds rolled out and vailing lights around the bay 
And you told me all those things 
Remember that? 
You told me you can't match your clothes 
Remember that? 
Confessed how when I laugh sometimes, I'm crying 
And we sat and didn't talk for half an hour 

Remember that? 
Alone 
Cause I won't remember 
Anymore 

And all this wandering 
And all this wandering
