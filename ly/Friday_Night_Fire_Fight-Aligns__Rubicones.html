		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Get plenty dreams, in the bigot dreams in the Friday firefight 
Wait to sit and kneel, it's just a Friday night
When the wolves are sitting looking way too friendly for you 
Owe no love, when the city belongs to skinny jeans and I I'm a little faulty, she's good at blocking
Insinuations seem to direct to
I don't wanna seem to wanna let go
I don't understand why would you let go
I don't understand, don't wanna let go
I don't understand, don't wanna let go
Cause you the one, the best thing ever, I don't want to suit you with a red coat
Big mama, V scent, but I'll leave jail, The Straightener woulda read the same
How mama leave, with the scenery won, she does that to win LA
I hope you feel the need to find a way
I need to know that it's going to be okay
I need to know that it's gon be okay
Just tell me it's gonna be okay
I need to know it's gon be okay
Should have seen it , they tried to frame me, I'll sit outside, teach me where we go. I don't wait. I shouldn't wait. 
They're shooting straight to where we go
I don't understand, don't wanna let go
I don't understand, don't wanna let go 
C'mon baby it's in there, don't really let go It's in there when you write, 
No I don't wanna see you mention that goal 
Hide away like a real culprit
I hope you find a way
I hopefully find a way
Hope you'll find a way
