		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do you think I'm pretty?
Do you want to have me?
And do you think I'm worthy?
Of being your baby?
Oh you like my hair, thank god
And, oh, you like the clothes I wear
Face could use some work
But you're a pretty girl so
Tell me am I pretty enough for you
(For you, for you, for you)
Do you think I'm pretty?
Do you want to have me?
And do you think I'm worthy?
Of being your baby?
Am I good enough, am I good enough?
Am I good enough, am I good enough?
Am I good enough, am I good enough?
Am I good enough, am I good enough?
Am I good enough, am I good enough?
Am I good enough, am I good enough?
Do you think I'm pretty?
