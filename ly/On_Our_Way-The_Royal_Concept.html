		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'll believe when the walls stop turning
I'll believe when the storm is through
I believe I hear them say
David won't stop writing songs
I never wanna shake their hands and stay
I never wanna shake their hands and stay
Oh no let's go

We are young, we are one
Let us shine for what it's worth
To your place, place, place
We're on our way, way, way
We're on our way, way, way
We're on our way somehow
Hold me close, close, close
We're losing time, time, time
We're losing time, time, time
We're falling to the ground

I'll believe when the sky is burning
I'll believe when I see the view
I believe that I hear them say
David won't stop dreaming now
And everybody clap your hands and shout
And everybody clap your hands and shout
Oh no, they shout

We are young, we are one
Let us shine for what it's worth
To your place, place, place
We're on our way, way, way
We're on our way, way, way
We're on our way somehow
Hold me close, close, close
We're losing time, time, time
We're losing time, time, time
We're falling to the ground

We are young, we are one
Let us shine for what it's worth
To your place, place, place
We're on our way, way, way
We're on our way, way, way
We're on our way
Hold me close
We're losing time
Hold me close
We're falling to the ground

Taxi drive the sun is rising
Damn the sirens, keep on driving
Flashing light, oh what a night
I miss her bed, I lost my head
And it's sunning, we're still running
For her rooftop, our last stop
Barefoot, naked, don't you let me go

To your place, place, place
We're on our way, way, way
We're on our way, way, way
We're on our way somehow
Hold me close, close, close
We're losing time, time, time
We're losing time, time, time
We're falling to the ground

We are young, we are one
Let us shine for what it's worth
To your place, place, place
We're on our way, way, way
We're on our way, way, way
We're on our way

(This night will never end)
(This night will never end)
(This night will never end)
(This night will never end)

Hold me close, we're losing time
Hold me close, we're falling to the ground
