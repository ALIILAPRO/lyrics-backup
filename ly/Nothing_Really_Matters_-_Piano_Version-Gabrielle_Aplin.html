		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I didn't mean it when I said that it was too much
Got myself into a mess like a head rush
I should've known, I nearly let go
And you caught me by surprise, ooh
And I know I should've called you in the morning
But I was fighting with myself like a war and
I don't why, I'm scared of forever
But it's now or it's never

Ooh, nothing really matters, no
Nothing really matters but you
Nothing really matters, no

I can't fight it (Hey), I can't hide it (Hey)
'Cause I always give into you, uh
Ooh, nothing really matters, no
Nothing really matters but you
Nothing really matters, no
Nothing really matters but you
Nothing really matters, no

I always thought that the grass somewhere was greener
And I accept that I've always been a dreamer
Tryna control and learn to let go, just
Don't let me go, no

Ooh, nothing really matters, no
Nothing really matters but you
Nothing really matters, no

I can't fight it (Hey), I can't hide it (Hey)
'Cause I always give into you, uh
Ooh, nothing really matters, no
Nothing really matters but you
Nothing really matters, no
Nothing really matters but you
Nothing really matters, no

Nothing really matters, no
Nothing really matters, no
Nothing really matters, no

I can't fight it (Hey), I can't hide it (Hey)
'Cause I always give into you, no
Ooh, nothing really matters, no
Nothing really matters but you
Nothing really matters, no
Nothing really matters but you
Nothing really matters, no

Nothing really matters, no
Nothing really matters but you
Nothing really matters, no
