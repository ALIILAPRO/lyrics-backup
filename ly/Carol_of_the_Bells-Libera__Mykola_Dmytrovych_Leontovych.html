		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Carol of the bells	Hark how the bells
sweet silver bells 
all seem to say 
throw cares away 

Christmas is here
bringing good cheer 
to young and old
meek and the bold 

Ding dong ding dong 
that is their song 
With joyful ring 
all carolling 

One seems to hear 
words of good cheer 
from everywhere 
filling the air

Oh how they pound 
raising the sound 
o'er hill and dale 
telling their tale 

Gloria, in excelsis Deo
Gloria

Gaily they ring 
while people sing 
songs of good cheer 
Christmas is here 

Merry, merry, merry, merry Christmas 
On on they send  
on without end
their joyful tone to every home 

Ding dong ding dong
That is their song
