		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I carved my name into your ribcage
We talked of lands away from this cage
You said, "Don't fret love, someday I'll be my own man"
I'll be free
Oh, but darlin', did you mean
Darlin', did you mean free from me?

You promised home, the kind I've never known, oh
But here we are, skin and flesh and beating hearts
And I'm wondering what the hell I'm doin' wrong
You said, let's make ourselves our very own brigade
This love our shield, our blade
Oh, but darlin', do you see
The cuts from which I bleed?
It's me you've slain

I didn't obliterate these walls
For you to come and raid my home
And here you are right next to me
Ironically, I've never felt more alone

I fell for you, faster than I fell apart, mm
And I guess I'm the one to blame for lettin' myself fall too hard
I ripped my heart out and put it in your hands
In hopes that we'd put up a fight, mm
How paradoxical, since now all I can think about
Is when will we stop tryin'? Oh

Oh
How do we stay afloat
When do I let go?
All you do is blindside me, it's hard to be brave
But when the night cuts into the day, it's your love I crave
I must've thanked my lucky stars too much
They left me sitting in too much dust, mm no
You know all my dreams, you were one, so it seemed
And I love you, but with you, it's heartache I breathe
You gave it your all just with everything you took from me

Oh, my love
Is this the end for us?
Maybe we've had enough
