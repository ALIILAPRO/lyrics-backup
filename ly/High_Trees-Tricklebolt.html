		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You've been climbing' up that tree 
You reached top and you felt free 
You've been climbing' up that tree, 
People get down on your knees. 
 
But what goes up must go down 
In your greed you will drown. 
 
and you should know  
you should know 
you should know 
you should know  


High trees catch a lot of wind 
 
We all heard you hit the ground 
but now no one is around 
No we don't kneel no more 
Now you're laying on the floor 
 
and you should know  
you should know
you should know
you should know
 
High trees catch a lot of wind 
and you know that you have sinned 
and fast cars crash hard 
yeah you know, you'll be torn apart 
High trees catch a lot of wind.
