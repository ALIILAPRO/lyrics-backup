		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  Knocked down everything I tried to do
That sounds something like me holding you
I've known this can make you understand
Take my spirit from my open hand

You used to hold me
You used to hold me
You used to hold me me me me, yeah

You used to hold me
You used to hold me
You used to hold me me me me, yeah

You used to hold me
You used to hold me
You used to hold me me me me, yeah

You used to hold me
You used to hold me
You used to hold me me me me, yeah

You know better than I do

Knocked down everything I tried to do
That sounds something like me holding you
I've known this can make you understand
Take my spirit from my open hand

You used to hold me
You used to hold me
You used to hold me me me me, yeah

You used to hold me
