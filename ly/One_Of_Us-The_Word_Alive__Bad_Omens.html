		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can one of us be saved?

I can't forgive you but I can't look away
I have tell myself it's better, better this way
It's killing me

(Don't wait for the light)
(Just fall asleep, embrace the night)

Keep telling myself that I was the victim
You were the one that pulled away
I've got a cold heart, this is the sad part
I don't think I can change
Can one of us be saved?
I feel like I'm better, better in a grave (better in a grave)
(Better in a grave, better in a grave)

You played the cards you know I wanted to see
Behind the curtain always pulling the strings in my head
But now I think it's time to cut the ends
I won't make the same mistake again

I keep telling myself that I was the victim
You were the one that pulled away
I've got a cold heart, this is the sad part
I don't think I can change
Can one of us be saved?
It feels like I'm better, it feels like I'm better
Better in a grave

You got what you deserved
And that was me
You saw me at my worst
You saw the worst in me
Tell me that I'm wrong
Tell me that I'm wrong

I can't forgive you but I can't look away
I walked through fire, I was born in the flames

Keep telling myself that I was the victim
You were the one that pulled away
I've got a cold heart, this is the sad part
I don't think I can change
Can one of us be saved?
I feel like I'm better, it feels like I'm better
Better in a grave

Can one of us be saved?
Better in a grave
