		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You and I were finished
 I was through with you
 Splitting up forever
 Seemed the thing to do
 I said I can't stand you
 With your honey touch
 This time you were cheating me
 One time too much
 Just then I remembered
 That a friend I knew
 Told me one thing
 I should never do
 Never never change your lovers in the middle of the night
 Everything may look so different in the early morning light
 Never never be too hasty when you're groping in the dark
 What you're getting into may be just a lark
 Keep your cool and don't change lovers when you're feeling sorta high
 Sorta big and high and mighty without really knowing why
 Let your heat wear off a little, give your man another chance
 And don't fall for someone else's song and dance
 Sure there was this guy
 Right next to me
 Mine just for the asking
 He said he would be
 But to leave my man
 Seemed to me all too strange
 And I'd say that I'm glad
 I didn't make the change
 Now our life is almost
 Like a Paradise
 Let me pass on to you
 This advice
 Keep your cool and don't change lovers in the middle of the night
 You may feel a strong temptation, the vibrations may be right
 But who knows what's gonna happen, you may simply lose your cool
 When you find it, you'll find out you were a fool
 Never never change your lovers under any midnight spell
 Take it easy, slow and easy, everything will turn out well
 Let the sunshine of a new day, and don't move while you're uptight
 Changing lovers in the middle of the night
 Never never change your lovers in the middle of the night
 Everything may look so different in the early morning light
 Never never be too hasty when you're groping in the dark
 What you're getting into may be just a lark
 Keep your cool and don't change lovers when you're feeling sorta high
 Sorta big and high and mighty without really knowing why
 Let your heat wear off a little, give your man another chance
 And don't fall for someone else's song and dance
