		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  the plants in the window 
won't dry out 
maybe we'll dry out 
the fabric of time is moving
slide your hand across my cheek
noone knows what we will meet

we were way to silent
go on, go on again
you make me feel vibrant 
go on, go on again

the plants in the window 
won't dry out 
maybe we'll dry out 
like water, you and I are moving
four times more across the sheets
noone knows what we will meet 
we were way to silent
go on, go on again
you make me feel vibrant 
go on, go on again
