		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We're waiting for collapse
In the cold and lonely mirror
Reflections all you see
Of the world, you made on your own with no mercy (hey)
And they call you a liar (hey)
But you won't surrender (hey)
And they can choose to run with hypocrisy

It happens every day

We were born to fight for this when all they ever do is pray
Never see the truth we miss, when fear consumes the rage
We take control, (don't give up) when all they know (is corrupt)
We were born to fight for this and lead us through crimson skies

The revolution lives
In the beat of our hearts and the burning sound of the flames we started in
Can you hear it now? Can you feel the hurt?
This silent hate (hey)
And they worship a liar (hey)
But we won't surrender (hey)
And we won't ever run from the pain you see
Because now we're free

We were born to fight for this when all they ever do is pray
Never see the truth we miss when fear consumes the rage
We take control, (don't give up) when all they know (is corrupt)
We were born to fight for this and lead us through crimson skies

We were born to fight for this when all they ever do is pray
Never see the truth we miss when fear consumes the rage
We take control, (don't give up) when all they know (is corrupt)
We were born to fight for this and lead us through crimson skies
