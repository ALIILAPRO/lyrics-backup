		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, I've been hurting lately
I'm down on all my luck
Sometimes there's no one there by your side
I don't deserve this, baby
But I know I can't give up
Tough times, I'll just take them in stride

Mmm, I'm almost there, only one more step
Whoa, left, right, left, right, left
Mmm, I'm moving on, I got no regrets
Whoa, left, right, left, right, left

I said times are changin'
Tell me, how can I keep up?
Every time that I turn around, there's a wall
But I'm climbing daily until I see the top
And I get up right after every fall
When you're brokenhearted and you're lost without me
Yeah, you gotta walk alone, yeah, it's true
Flash every smile 'cause I've been lost for miles
'Cause, yeah, I know you've felt this way before too

Mmm, we're almost there, baby, one more step
Whoa, left, right, left, right, left
Mmm, we're moving on, we got no regrets
Whoa, left, right, left, right, left
Whoa, left, right, left, right, left
Whoa, left, right, left, right, left
Whoa, we're almost there, only one more step
Whoa, left, right, left, right, left

Mmm, I know it looks like it's too far
But it's nothing compared to how far we've come
Walking down this boulevard
When the darkest times come right before the sun

We're almost there, baby, one more step
Whoa, left, right, left, right, left
We're movin' forward and there's no regrets
Whoa, left, right, left, right
Whoa, left, right, left, right, left
Whoa, left, right, left, right, left
Whoa, we're almost there, only one more step
Whoa, left, right, left, right, left
Whoa, left, right, left, right, left
Whoa, left, right, left, right, left
Whoa, we're almost there, only one more step
Whoa, left, right, left, right, left
