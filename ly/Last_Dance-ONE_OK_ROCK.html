		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It started out as any other story
Then, the words began to fade away
Oh, your smile used to make me smile
But lately, I don't feel that way

Try to remember what brought us together
And to forget what's driving us apart
You know we can't wait here forever
Just making time, and going nowhere

Is this our last dance?
Can we take another chance
To be alone together still?
Are we wasting time
Chasing dreams not yours or mine?
Care for you, I always will

We can try to keep the love from fading
'Cause all we have are reasons to be gone
Remember when you used to make me smile?
But lately, I don't feel the same

Look up and I see your face
I can see you looking back at me
Every time I think it's getting better
Just making time, and going nowhere

Is this our last dance?
Can we take another chance
To be alone together still?
Are we wasting time
Chasing dreams not yours or mine?
Care for you, I always will

You know I always will
But there's no looking back
And no more need to cry
No more need to cry
No more need to cry

Is this all we have?
Should we walk away at last
To be alone together still?
Are we wasting time
Chasing dreams not yours or mine?
Care for you, I always will
You know I always will
