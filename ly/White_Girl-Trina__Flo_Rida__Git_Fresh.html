		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don Perignon people layin' on my lawn
Gettin wasted by the cases
And my hairs not even blonde (even blonde)
Wanna pull me ova see me crossin' ova
I'm supernova middle finger to a hater if you thought it was ova

Like ooh shawty what it do
I wanna get loose and party like a white girl

Baby, I can hear the party
Get a little naughty
You turn me on
So baby, let me see you swallow
Drink it up the bottle
Let's have some fun
Party like a (white girl) 
Party like a (white girl)
Party like a (white girl)
Party like a (white girl)
Party like a (white girl)
Party like a (white girl)
Party like a (white girl)
Party like a (white girl)

3 am into the party dressed bugari
3 am wanna take me home
I'm so throwed
I'm so wasted me and katy waking up in Vegas
Say my name I'm famous but shhh don't wake the neighbors

Like ooh shawty what it do
I wanna get loose and party like a white girl
I wanna get loose and party like a white girl

Baby, I can hear the party
Get a little naughty
You turn me on
So baby, let me see you swallow
Drink it up the bottle
Let's have some fun
Party like a (white girl)
Party like a (white girl)
Party like a (white girl)
Party like a (white girl)
Party like a (white girl)
Party like a (white girl)
Party like a (white girl)
Party like a (white girl)
