		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Today I change,
Too late 'cause everyone stayed the same,
I'm gone so long,
Break out 'cause I'm better off on my own.

Today I change, 
Too late 'cause every town feels the same,
I'm different and you're distant,
Add it up and it makes no difference.

Everybody's talking about blowing up the neighborhood,
Everybody's gonna break it up today,
Everybody's talking about blowing up the neighborhood,
Running just to get away,

Stuck in America,
Stuck in America,
Miles in America,
Stuck in America, (go)

Today I change,
New town with the same old things,
One way to shake,
This place that I can't escape.

Everybody's talking about blowing up the neighborhood,
Everybody's gonna watch it burn today,
Everybody's talking about waking up the neighborhood,
I'm still trying to escape!

Stuck in America,
Stuck in America,
Miles in America,
Stuck in America, (today, today)

Everybody's talking about blowing up the neighborhood,
Everybody's gonna break it up today,
Everybody's talking about blowing up the neighborhood,
All I ever wanted was to get away.

[Repeat: x4]
Stuck in America, 

[Repeat: x4]
Get away! 

Today I changed.
