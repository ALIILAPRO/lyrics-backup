		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's winter-fall
Read skies are gleaming, oh
Sea-gulls are flyin' over
Swans are floatin' by
Smoking chimney-tops
Am I dreaming?
Am I dreaming?

The nights draw in
There's a silky moon up in the sky, yeah
Children are fantasizing
Grown-ups are standin' by
What a super feeling
Am I dreaming?
Am I dreaming?
Woh-woh-woh-woh

(Dreaming) So quiet and peaceful
(Dreaming) Tranquil and blissful
(Dreaming) There's a kind of magic in the air
(Dreaming) What a truly magnificent view
(Dreaming) A breathtaking scene
(With the dreams of the world
In the palm of your hand)

(Dreaming) A cozy fireside chat
(Dreaming) A little this, a little that
(Dreaming) Sound of merry laughter skippin' by
(Dreaming) Gentle rain beatin' on my face
(Dreaming) What an extraordinary place!
(And the dream of the child
Is the hope of the, hope of the man)

It's all so beautiful
Like a landscape painting in the sky, yeah
Mountains are zoomin' higher, uh
Little girls scream an' cry
My world is spinnin', and spinnin', and spinnin'
It's unbelievable
Sends me reeling
Am I dreaming?
Am I dreaming?

Oooh, it's bliss
