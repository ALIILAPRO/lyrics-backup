		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So feel that cardiac arrest...
CPR
They press...
On your chest to beat the heart again...
And if you flat line
Defibrillators
And operating
Can you resurrect you
When life is fleetin'
With every breath
You just cheated death
And now got away with it...

Better than I ever been
A letterman
Demented with
The pen again
And venomous
I'm comin' for the Pennet
Like a veteran
I enter my element
Then I send-it for
The hell of it
The rhetoric's
Irrelevant
But still I be developing
It's evident
If you look at the evidence
Cause everytime I get up on the mic
I been ahead of em'
So fuck it
I'ma never quit
The benefits
Are eminent
I'm comin' for the mother fucking throne, BITCH
I go harder
Than most with, this
Psychosis
Hydro spit
My flow is
Reversing
Osmosis
I suppose that
These vocals
Are super human
Like Clark Kent
In his bifocals
So die dodos
And suck on deez
Dragon Balls
Bitch I'm Goku
I spit fire
Like C-0-2
That beat produced
Is heat
So I come with-an urgency
When I spit
And I hurt a beat
Till it's burned
To the third degree
What occurred to me
When I came to the murder scene
Was emergency surgery
In the bed of hospitals
Gettin' hospice
You're seen by doctors
Then put on oxygen
Run amok
While your family's watching
They pull the plug
And your heart it stopping...

So feel that cardiac arrest...
CPR
They press...
On your chest to beat the heart again...
And if you flat line
Defibrillators
And operating
Can you resurrect you
When life is fleetin'
With every breath
You just cheated death
And now got away with it...

That rigamortis
Is too sadistic
And I'm futuristic
Like Rick and Morty
When I'm sipping liquor
And, I'm drinking forties
But the story ends
When that kid's aborted-
So asta lavista
Bitch, I'm not teacher
But I could show you
How to swing for the bleachers
Cause all I ever did
Was be competitive
And use adrenaline
To make them benjamins...

Haters they be, yellin' for help again
Soon as the alpha male, alchemist
Come in with the mal intent
Malcolm X
When I murder alphabets
Falcon X
Rocket ship
When I'm droppin'-the- bomb like Sadam in this bitch
Noxious toxins are shockin'
The Metropolis
Call your congressmen

See I just go and go and go
I make dough
I might fuck around and tell her she's a hoe
Unh
You bitches ain't even close to the level I'm at
And you'll never be that
In fact
I be the illest to rap
So I rap and I rap
Like a rabbit
I'm fast
When I slam on the gas
And I'm lappin' em'
Been a fat minute
But I'm back winnin'
Bad business?
I'm not havin' it
The antagonist
Naggin' a bit
Classes of undergraduate
Accident
I might crash
When da tracks spinnin'

Lot of people told me
I would never be the main event
So I just do my duty
Take my pen
And make rap great again

So feel that cardiac arrest...
CPR
They press...
On your chest to beat the heart again...
And if you flat line
Defibrillators
And operating
Can you resurrect you
When life is fleetin'
With every breath
You just cheated death
And now got away with it...
