		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All the time I thought
There's only me
Crazy in a way
That no one else could be
I would have given everything I own
If someone would have said "you're not alone"

All the time I thought that I was wrong
Wanting to believe but needing to belong
If I'd've just believed in all I had
If someone would have said "you're not so bad"

All the time, all the wasted time
All the years waiting for a sign
To think I had it all
All the time

All the time I thought
There's only me
Crazy in a way
That no one else could be
I can't believe that you were somewhere, too
Thinking all the time there's only you

All the time, all the wasted time
All the years waiting for a sign
To think I had it all
All the time
