		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wake up, first thing
Always tryna get ahead
No more dreaming
Fragments of it in my head
Addiction is compulsory
Agreeing just to disagree
Pull ourselves apart into debris
'Cause algorithms haunt me, air your dirty laundry
Hang it all on me
Getting sick of scrolling down, down, down, down
Messed up, give me your confession
Never learn our lessons
Getting sick of scrolling down, down, down, down
Start the countdown
Feeding the anxiety
Blacked out, burnt up
We can't survive this industry
Just say what's on your mind
Just shut up you'll be fine
Just keep letting the cycle run you
Over and over and over again
Taunt me, air your dirty laundry
Hang it all on me
Getting sick of scrolling down, down, down, down
Messed up, give me your confession
Never learn our lessons
Getting sick of scrolling down, down, down, down
Within this black spiral, everyone acts entitled
You're just one more rival, don't ever meet your idols
Decline to low vitals, don't care about survival
Just wanna go viral, we feed this vicious cycle
(Take your own time) but it's always a race
Nobody will care if you come in second place
(Embrace your identity, don't be afraid)
But only show the artificial life you create
Fight to stay relevant
Disregard our negligence
It's evident, it's prevalent
We've halted our development
Doomed to repeat this cycle
'Cause algorithms haunt me, air your dirty laundry
Hang it all on me
Getting sick of scrolling down, down, down, down
Exhausted, think I finally lost it
Drew the line and crossed it
Getting sick of scrolling down, down, down, down
We're gonna keep falling
Down, down, down, down
The wheel will go on spinning
'Round 'round 'round 'round
Never escape scrolling
Down, down, down, down
The cycle keeps going
'Round 'round 'round 'round
