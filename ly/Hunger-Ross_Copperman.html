		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One look and I can't catch my breath
Two souls into one flesh
When you're not next to me
I'm incomplete

'Cause I'm on fire like a thousand suns
I couldn't put it out even if I wanted to
These flames tonight
Look into my eyes and say you want me, too
Like I want you

Oh, love, let me see inside your heart
All the cracks and broken parts
The shadows in the light
There's no need to hide

'Cause I'm on fire like a thousand suns
I couldn't put it out even if I wanted to
These flames tonight
Look into my eyes and say you want me, too
Like I want you

It's like a hunger in me
Yeah, it's never ending
Yeah, I'll burn for you (I'll burn for you)
It's like a hunger in me
Yeah, it's never ending
Yeah, I'll burn for you (I'll burn for you)

I'm on fire like a thousand suns
I couldn't put it out even if I wanted to
These flames tonight
Look into my eyes and say you want me, too
Like I want you

I got a hunger in me
I got a hunger in me
