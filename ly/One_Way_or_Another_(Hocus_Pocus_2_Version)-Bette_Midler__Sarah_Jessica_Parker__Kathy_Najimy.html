		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One way or another, I'm gonna find ya
I'm gonna get ya, get ya, get ya, get ya
One way or another I'm gonna win ya
I'm gonna get ya, get ya, get ya, get ya
One way or another, I'm gonna see ya
I'm gonna meet ya, meet ya, meet ya, meet ya
One day, maybe real soon, I'm gonna meet ya
I'm gonna meet ya, I'll meet ya

And when the sun has gone down
We'll fly our broomsticks downtown
To spy who's around
Sisters

One way or another, we're gonna find ya
We're gonna get ya, get ya, get ya, get ya
One way or another we're gonna grab ya
I'll nab ya, I'll jab ya
One way or another we're gonna snatch ya
I'm gonna catch ya, dispatch ya
One day, maybe next week
We're gonna grip ya and then we'll trip ya, I'll rip ya
Now lead us Salem
Lead us to thy Mayor

And like a hawk in the night
We'll scoop you up for a flight
Then we'll take a bite
(We'll take a, we'll take a bite)
Two, three, four

Ah, say into pi, alpha maybe upendi (Ah, say into pi, alpha maybe upendi)
In comma-coriyama (In comma-coriyama)
Hey (hey)
High (high)
Come on baby upendi
We're 'bout to chew ya
And even witches' brew ya
We're retching through ya
And oopa doopa doo ya
We're gonna slay ya
And probably filet ya
It might upset ya
But we'll get ya, get ya, get ya, get ya

One way or another, we're gonna find ya
We're gonna get ya, get ya, get ya, get ya
One way or another, we're gonna trick ya
I'm gonna stick ya, I'll kick ya
One way or another, we're gonna meet ya
Yeah, we're gonna cheat ya, beat ya, then defeat ya
One way (ooh), maybe right now, no more debatin', it's aggravatin' 
Satan's waitin', stayin'
One way or another
Ooh
