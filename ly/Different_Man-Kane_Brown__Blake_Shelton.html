		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Born a life, 9 to 5
Gonna work 'til you die
Gonna hurt
Gonna learn to take it like a man
Find a girl, make a wife
Dig a fence, paint it white
What if I had another plan?

But what if I was made for the stage?
What if I was made for the lights?
What if I was chosen to write the stories?
Wasn't built to work the line
Oh, what if I was different?
(Whoa, whoa, whoa)
Would I wanna be different?
(Whoa, whoa, whoa)

Man, it's cold, crack a dawn
Hear that old rooster crow
Coffees on and it ain't never gonna change
Another night, same fight
Same girl, same guy
What if I wanna break the mundane?

What if I was made for the stage?
What if I was made for the lights?
What if I was chosen to write the stories?
Wasn't built to work the line
Oh, what if I was different?
(Whoa, whoa, whoa)
Would I wanna be different?
(Whoa, whoa, whoa)

Feels like I'm stuck in this rut
Tryin' to spin my way out, I can't figure it out
Don't know how
How I'm supposed to tell mama and daddy
Without them mad at me but I'm breaking down
I'm breaking down

But what if I was made for the stage?
What if I was made for the lights?
What if I was chosen to write the stories?
Wasn't built to work the line
Oh, what if I was different?
(Whoa, whoa, whoa)
Would I wanna be different?
(Whoa, whoa, whoa)
I wanna be different 
(Whoa, whoa, whoa)
I wanna be different 
(Whoa, whoa, whoa)
