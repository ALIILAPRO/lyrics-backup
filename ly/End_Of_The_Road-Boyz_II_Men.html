		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Girl you know we belong together
I don't have no time for you
To be playing with my heart like this
You'll be mine forever baby
You just wait

We belong together
And you know that I'm right
Why do you play with my heart?
Why do you play with my mind?

Said we'd be forever
Said it'd never die
How could you love me and leave me
And never say goodbye?

When I can't sleep at night
Without holding you tight
Girl, each time I try
I just break down and cry
Pain in my head
Oh, I'd rather be dead
Spinning around and around

Although we've come
To the end of the road
Still I can't let go
It's unnatural
You belong to me
I belong to you

Come to the end of the road
Still I can't let go
It's unnatural
You belong to me
I belong to you

Girl, I know you really love me
You just don't realize
You've never been there before
It's only your first time

Maybe I'll forgive you
Maybe you'll try
We should be happy together forever
You and I

Will you love me again
Like you loved me before?
This time I want you to love me much more
This time instead
Just come to my bed
And baby just don't let me, don't let go

Although we've come
To the end of the road (end of the the road)
Still I can't let go (the end of the road and I can't let go, baby)
It's unnatural
You belong to me
I belong to you (I don't know what I'm gonna do)

Come to the end of the road (I don't know what I'm gonna do)
Still I can't let go ('cause I know I've come to the end of the road)
It's unnatural (oh my god, oh my god, help me out a little bit, baby)
You belong to me
I belong to you

Girl, I'm here for you
All those times at night when you just hurt me
And just ran out with that other fella
Baby, I knew about it, I just didn't care
You just don't understand how much I love you, do you?
I'm here for you

I'm not out to go out there and cheat at night (maybe I'll forgive you)
Just like you did baby, but that's alright
I love you anyway (maybe you will try)
And I'm still going to be here for you until my dying day, baby
Right now, I'm just in so much pain, baby (we should be happy together forever)
'Cause you just won't come back to me, will you? (You and I)
Just come back to me

Yes baby, my heart is lonely (lonely, lonely)
My heart hurts baby, yes, I feel pain too (lonely, lonely)
Baby, please
This time instead just come to my bed
And baby just don't let me, don't let go

Although we've come
To the end of the road
Still I can't let go
It's unnatural
You belong to me
I belong to you
Come to the end of the road
Still I can't let go
It's unnatural
You belong to me
I belong to you

Although we've come
To the end of the road
Still I can't let go
It's unnatural
You belong to me
I belong to you
Come to the end of the road
Still I can't let go
It's unnatural
You belong to me
I belong to you
