		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So ya
Thought ya
Might like to go to the show
To feel the warm thrill of confusion
That space cadet glow
Tell me is something eluding you, sunshine?
Is this not what you expected to see?
If you want to find out what's behind these cold eyes
You'll just have to claw your way through this disguise

Lights, turn on the sound effects, action
Drop it, drop it on 'em, drop it on them
