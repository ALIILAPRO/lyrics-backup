		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Im so sorry that I never changed
I'm always hoping things remain the same
You know I'm scared enough to take the blame
Everyday I get colder
Overthinking everything I say
You know I wish I could fade away
You know I'm terrified of all the change
Everyday I get older
Break away with every step I take
I can feel the pain rushing through my veins
Breathing in for me, breathing out again tonight
We're running out of time
We're running out of time again
Feeling like I've lost a part of you
Stitch me up and heal the wound
Look into my eyes
Look into my eyes again
Watching all the fire clear the room
Stitch me up and the heal the wound
Take the hate inside of misery
Cut it open, is it comforting?
Wish it would end this way
Everyday I get colder
Break away with every step I take
I can feel the pain rushing through my veins
Breathing in for me, breathing out again tonight
We're running out of time
We're running out of time again
Feeling like I've lost a part of you
Stitch me up and heal the wound
Look into my eyes
Look into my eyes again
Watching all the fire clear the room
Stitch me up and the heal the wound
Take a second, look around to see
All the catastrophic life debris
Just wanna sleep and wake my dreams back to reality
Every moment is a picture made
Ever changing with slight decay
Don't be alarmed, the siren's armed
They're coming
We're running out of time
We're running out of time again
Feeling like I've lost all of you
Stitch me up and heal the wound
Look into my eyes
Look into my eyes again
Watching all the fire clear the room
Stitch me up and the heal the wound
