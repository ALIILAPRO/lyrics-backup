		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Your eyes
My sunrise
Your voice
My favorite
Your lips
The sweetest
Your love
My treasure
Lets cuddle
Together
Do road trip
Endeavor
To Berlin
To techno
And hold hands
On dancefloor
Your eyes
My sunrise
Your voice
My favorite
Your lips
The sweetest
Your love
My treasure
Lets cuddle
Together
Do road trip
Endeavor
To Berlin
To techno
And hold hands
On dancefloor
Baby
Just maybe
Kiss me
And save me
Hug me
And love me
I want, I want you
Baby
Just maybe
Kiss me
And save me
Hug me
And love me
I want, I want you
Baby
Just maybe
Kiss me
And save me
Hug me
And love me
I want, I want you
Baby
Just maybe
Kiss me
And save me
Hug me
And love me
I want, I want you
Oh, I'm ready for affection
This is the sensation
You are like a 5g
But I'm about connection
JK, you're my cocaine
Can't resist temptation
Let's just do us, ok?
Close The Curtains
Close The Curtains
Close The Curtains
Your eyes
My sunrise
Your voice
My favorite
Your lips
The sweetest
Your love
My treasure
Lets cuddle
Together
Do road trip
Endeavor
To Berlin
To Techno
And hold hands
On dancefloor
Your eyes
My sunrise
Your voice
My favorite
Your lips
The sweetest
Your love
My treasure
Lets cuddle
Together
Do road trip
Endeavor
To Berlin
To Techno
And hold hands
On dancefloor
Close The Curtains
Close The Curtains
Close The Curtains
Close The Curtains
Close The Curtains
Oh, I'm ready for affection
This is the sensation
You are like a 5g
But I'm about connection
JK, you're my cocaine
Can't resist temptation
Let's just do us, ok?
Close The Curtains
Baby
Just maybe
Kiss me
And save me
Hug me
And love me
I want, I want you
Baby
Just maybe
Kiss me
And save me
Hug me
And love me
I want, I want you
Baby
Just maybe
Kiss me
And save me
Hug me
And love me
I want, I want you
Baby
Just maybe
Kiss me
And save me
Hug me
And love me
I want, I want you
