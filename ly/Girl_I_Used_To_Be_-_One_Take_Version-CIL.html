		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm sick of counting on my ribs
Hollowed cheeks, I'm paper thin
Making sure I'm never full
So, I can stay this beautiful
Traded all my happiness
For nothing but emptiness

I'm body checking off the days
Young and yet my body aches
I don't know how much I can take
I can't go on living this way
It's time for her to fly away

Sing something soft and slow
A song that she used to know
Lay her down in a bed of roses
And make sure that lace dress fits
Make sure her mama knows
She's taking the pain when she goes
It's only goodbye for a moment
So, go on and close that lid
Say "Goodnight", and just let her sleep
No need to cry for the girl I used to be

Make the coffin big enough
To fit the boy she used to love
Who never loved her half as much
And tell her that her work is done
Put the daisies on her chest
And lay there good, rest

Oh, sing something soft and slow
A song that she used to know
Lay her down in a bed of roses
And make sure that lace dress fits
Make sure her mamma knows
She's taking the pain when she goes
It's only goodbye for a moment
So, go on and close that lid
Say "Goodnight", and just let her sleep
No need to cry for the girl I used to be
