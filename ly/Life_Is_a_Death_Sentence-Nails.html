		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Born guilty into this prison
They won't be forgiven

Consumed with vengeance
Life is a death sentence

Tormented screams come from the shadows
Torn from the womb, placed in the gallows

Consumed with vengeance
Life is a death sentence

Guilty, sentenced to death

Verdict reached, judgement passed
Rope around the neck, sentenced to death
No mercy, I won't make it quick
Leave you in a shallow ditch

Guilty
Life is a death sentence

They will not be forgiven

Guilty
Life is a death sentence

Life is a death sentence
