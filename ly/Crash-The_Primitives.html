		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here you go
Way too fast
Don't slow down
Gonna crash
You should watch
Watch your step
Don't lookout 
Gonna break your neck

So shut, shut your mouth
'Cause I'm not listening anyhow
I've had enough, enough of you
You know to last a lifetime through

So what do you want of me
Got no words of sympathy
And if I go around with you
You know that I'll get messed up too with you
With you

Nana nana na nana nana naaaaa
Nana nana na nana nana naaaaa

Here you go 
Way too fast
Don't slowdown
Gonna crash
You don't know
What's been going down
You've been running 
Allover town

So shut, shut your mouth
'Cause I'm not listening anyhow
I've had enough, enough of you 
You know to last a lifetime through

So what do you want of me
Got no cure for misery
And if I go about with you
You know that ill get messed up too with you
With you

Nana nana na nana nana naaaa
Nana nana na nana nana naaaa
