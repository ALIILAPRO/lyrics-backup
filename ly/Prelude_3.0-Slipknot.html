		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't know why
I never told you
I don't know why
I never tried

When we shed these bitter skins again
All the reasons come to life

But now it's over
Now it's over
Now it's over
Now it's over

I don't know why
You never asked me
And I don't know why
You never cared

When we hide these little sins again
All the reasons
Have to die

But now it's over
Now it's over
And now it's over
And now it's over
And now it's over
And now it's over
And now it's over
And now it's over
No, no, no, no, no
