		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (She can't help it, the girl can't help it)
(She can't help it, the girl can't help it)

If she walks by the men folks get engrossed
(She can't help it, the girl can't help it)
If she winks an eye and bread slices turn to toast
(She can't help it, the girl can't help it)
If she's got a lot of what they call they most
(She can't help it, the girl can't help it)

The girl can't help it if she was born to please
(She can't help it, the girl can't help it)
And if she's got a figure made to squeeze
(She can't help it, the girl can't help it)
Won't you kindly be aware
The girl can't help it (the girl can't help it)
If she mesmerizes ev'ry mother's son
(She can't help it, the girl can't help it)
If she smiles then beef steak become well done
(She can't help it, the girl can't help it)
She makes grandpa feel like twenty one
(She can't help it, the girl can't help it)

The girl can't help it if she was born to please
(She can't help it, the girl can't help it)
And if I go to her on bended knees
(She can't help it, the girl can't help it)
Oh, won't you kindly be aware, that I can't help it (I can't help it)

Because I'm hopin' obviously
That someday the answer will be
The girl can't help it if she's in love with me
(She can't help it, the girl can't help it) (ahh)

If she walks by the menfolks get engrossed
(She can't help it, the girl can't help it)
If she winks an eye and the bread slices turn to toast
(She can't help it, the girl can't help it)
If she's got a lot of what they call the most
(She can't help it, the girl can't help it)

The girl can't help it, she was born to please
(She can't help it, the girl can't help it)
And if she's got a figure made to squeeze
(She can't help it, the girl can't help it)

I'm hopin' obviously
That someday the answer will be
The girl can't help it if she's in love with me
(She can't help it, the girl can't help it)
