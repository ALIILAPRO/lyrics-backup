		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Christ is my firm foundation
The rock on which I stand
When everything around me is shaken
I've never been more glad
That I put my faith in Jesus
'Cause He's never let me down
He's faithful through generations
So why would He fail now?
He won't

No, He won't, no, He won't
No, He won't
He won't, He won't, He won't, He won't

I've still got joy in chaos
I've got peace that makes no sense
I won't be going under
I'm not held by my own strength
'Cause I've built my life on Jesus
He's never let me down
He's faithful through every season
So why would He fail now? (Shout it out)

He won't
He won't
He won't fail
He won't fail
He won't
He won't (no, no, no, no, He won't fail)
He won't fail
He won't fail

Christ is my firm foundation (let's go) (testify)
The rock on which I stand
When everything around me is shaken (I've never been more)
I've never been more glad
That I put my faith in Jesus (yeah)
'Cause He's never let me down (He's faithful)
He's faithful through generations (so why)
So why would He fail now? (I need you to shout it out) (come on)

He won't
Sing it out, sing
He won't
No, He won't, no, He won't
He won't fail
He won't fail (He won't)
He won't (yeah)
He won't (I've never seen Him fail, no)
He won't fail
He won't fail

I have a testimony
I have a story to sing
This is my story, this is my song
I have a testimony
Can I sing my testimony?

Rain came, wind blew
But my house was built on You
I'm safe with You
I'm gonna make it through (I feel somebody's faith rising)
Rain came, wind blew
But my house was built on You (this is the reason you made it, 'cause)
I'm safe with You
I'm gonna make it through (one more time, oh, rain came)
Rain came, wind blew
My house was built on You (this is the reason I'm standing)
I'm safe with You
I'm gonna make it through (I'm gonna make it)
Yeah, I'm gonna make it through ('cause I'm standing)
'Cause I'm standing strong on You (I'm gonna make it)
Yeah, I'm gonna make it through (my house is built on)
'Cause my house is built on You (one more time, y'all, sing)

Christ is my firm foundation (yeah)
The rock on which I stand
When everything around me is shaken (oh)
I've never been more glad (sing it out)
That I put my faith in Jesus (He's never let me down)
'Cause He's never let me down (He's faithful)
He's faithful through generations
So why would He fail now?

He won't
He won't
He won't fail
He won't fail
He won't
He won't
He won't fail
He won't fail

Never seen the righteous forsaken
And He won't start now
Never seen the righteous forsaken
And He won't start now

Rain came, wind blew
My house was built on You (this is how I made it)
I'm safe with You
I'm gonna make it through (I'll make it)
Rain came, wind blew (they tried to knock me out, they tried to shake me up)
My house was built on You (but my house was built on You)
I'm safe with You
I'm gonna make it through (I'm gonna make it)

I'm gonna make it through (I'm standing strong on you)
'Cause I'm standing strong on you (I'm gonna make it through)
I'm gonna make it through ('Cause my house is built on You)
'Cause my house is built on You (yes, you're gonna make it)
I'm gonna make it through ('cause I'm standing strong)
'Cause I'm standing strong on You (I'm gonna make it)
I'm gonna make it through
'Cause my house is built on You

Y'all give it up for the legendary Cody Carnes
