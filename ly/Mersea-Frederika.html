What a daft pilgrimage...
As if I didn't already know
That what was lying down there
Was a drained memories wreck
Coming and going like a fish
Stranded on my brain...

And now the sea is a little tear in my grief
And the city looks like the grave of all humanity
And the sea is only a tear in my grief
And this evening, sanctuary
Of the child that I used to be...

Give me a speck of sand
And I'll build an entire desert homeland
Send me shiny driftnets
And I'll saw my perfect dress

The sea is a little tear in my grief
And the city looks like the grave of all humanity
And the sea is only a tear in my grief
And this evening, sanctuary
Of the kid that I used to be...
