		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Boom, boom, boom, boom
I'm gonna shoot you right down
Knock you off of your feet
And take you home with me
Put you in my house
Boom, boom, boom, boom

Ow ow ow ow ow
Hmm hmm hmm
Hmm hmm hmm hmm
I love to see you strut
Up and down the floor
When you're talking to me
That baby talk
I like it like that
Oh yeah

Talk that talk
Walk that walk

Won't you walk that walk?
And talk that talk
And whisper in my ear
Tell me that you love me
I love that talk
When you talk like that
You knock me out
Right off my feet
Ho ho ho ho

Well, talk that talk
And walk that walk
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Talk that talk, babe
