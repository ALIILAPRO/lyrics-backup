		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been holding on to things
That I don't even need to
Wish I could let go of everything
I never meant to hurt you
Tell me what is it we're fighting for
Show me, I'm not sure we even know anymore
Help me, I need this to mean so much more
What is it we're fighting for
And I'm swept up in the moment
I've got nothing left to show for it
The hurt, the pain you've made
I will never be the same
And I'm swept up in the moment
I've got nothing left to show for it
The hurt, the pain you've made
I will never be the same
I'm an overthinker who can't let go
So make sure your bullshit adds up
Before I go working out the truth for myself
Tell me what is it we're fighting for
Show me, I'm not sure we even know anymore
Help me, I need this to mean so much more
What is it we're fighting for
And I'm swept up in the moment
I've got nothing left to show for it
The hurt, the pain you've made
I will never be the same
And I'll never learn
keep repeating these same actions
Triggering these chain reactions
So much you have to say
Why don't you say it to my face
You ostracised me, and made me believe I was not enough
So why don't you say it to my face
So why don't you say what you have to say
Instead of ostracising me, and bringing me down
So why don't you
Tell me what is it we're fighting for
Show me, I'm not sure we even know anymore
Help me, I need this to mean so much more
What is it we're fighting for
And I'm swept up in the moment
I've got nothing left to show for it
The hurt, the pain you've made
I will never be the same
And I'll never learn
keep repeating these same actions
Triggering these chain reactions
And I will never learn
keep repeating these same old actions
And I will never learn
Triggering these chain reactions
