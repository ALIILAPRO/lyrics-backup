		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, that's what we're gonna do 
We gon' talk about the street shit
Ayy, look

I don't care 'bout haters, I'm only concerned what hustlers think
But I think it's time I finally address this publicly
It's rubbin' me the wrong way when these rappers speak comfortably
'Bout street life, it seem like they only givin' y'all luxuries
I sat on work when I was positive it would sell
You know this game come with way more consequences than jail
Bittersweet when you in it deep, gassed up a rented V
Travelin' with a key while I'm passin' through Tennessee
Told baby girl I'd be back, she said be careful
I told baby girl I'd be strapped, that made her worry more
Street niggas live by dirty laws, I got my stripes, how you earnin' yours?
Can't let these niggas think I'm turnin' soft
It's gon' be hard to convince kids
But honestly, losses taught me more than my wins did
It's complicated, I can't see it, work hard to just break even
We traded that for them great beaches in St. Regis
Trust me, there's two sides, one glamorous, other scandalous
These symptoms of abandonment, we suffer damages
I was you, not comprehendin' or understandin' it
Losses turn into pain, then they become advantages, ah

You know that's real shit
Sometimes you gotta lose something to gain something
There's two sides to this shit
For every nigga, for every nigga you see out here winnin'
It's a hundred niggas still in the trenches, man
Don't forget about that
This shit chess, man, we makin' boss moves
You can't be making cheap mistakes, feel me?
Remember that shit
Be careful nigga, that's comin' from a nigga who did everything
And this the Burden of Proof, uh
