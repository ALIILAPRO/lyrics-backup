		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I went everywhere for you
I even did my hair for you
I bought new underwear, they're blue
And I wore 'em just the other day
Love, you know I'll fight for you
I left on the porch light for you
Whether you are sweet or cruel
I'm gonna love you either way

Love, oh, love
I gotta tell you how I feel about you
'Cause I, oh, I
Can't go a minute without your love
Like a satellite, I'm in an orbit all the way around you
And I would fall out into the night
Can't go a minute without your love

Love, I got it bad for you
I saved the best I have for you
You sometimes make me sad and blue
Wouldn't have it any other way
Love, my aim is straight and true
Cupid's arrow is just for you
I even painted my toenails for you
I did it just the other day

Love, oh, love
I gotta tell you how I feel about you
'Cause I, oh, I
Can't go a minute without your love
Like a satellite, I'm in an orbit all the way around you
And I would fall out into the night
Can't go a minute without your
Love, oh, love
I gotta tell you how I feel about you
'Cause I, oh, I
Can't go a minute without your love

Where you go, I'll follow
You set the pace, we'll take it fast or slow
I'll follow in your way
Oh, oh, oh
You got me, you got me
A force more powerful than gravity
It's physics, there's no escape

Love, my aim is straight and true
Cupid's arrow is just for you
I even painted my toenails for you
I did it just the other day

Love, oh, love
I gotta tell you how I feel about you
'Cause I, oh, I
Can't go a minute without your love
Like a satellite, I'm in an orbit all the way around you
And I would fall out into the night
Can't go a minute without your
Love, oh, love
I gotta tell you how I feel about you
'Cause I, oh, I
Can't go a minute without your love

Love, love, love
Love
Love
Love
