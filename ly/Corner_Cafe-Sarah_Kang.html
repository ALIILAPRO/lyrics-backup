		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How do you expect me to go about my day
When the street signs in the neighborhood still spell your name?
The bookstore and the city park keep a record of our dates
Your ghost, it follows everywhere, even onto the train

Do you remember the corner café?
We sat there with our books, feels like yesterday
Everywhere I look, I still see your face
I think I might have to move away

How is it the less I try, the more I recall?
The way he kissed my forehead, I remember it all
I guess this is the irony, the catch-22
That by trying to forget, all of the thoughts come back anew

Do you remember the corner café?
We sat there with our books, feels like yesterday
Everywhere I look, I still see your face
I think I might have to move away

So what an unexpected and pleasant surprise
To meet somebody new while in the grocery line
You made some clever small talk 'bout the rain outside
For the first time in a while, I felt the clouds subside

Do you know the way to the corner café?
I'll find a table for two where we can sit all day
I think I might forget all about his face
I think I won't have to move away
I think I might have to stay
