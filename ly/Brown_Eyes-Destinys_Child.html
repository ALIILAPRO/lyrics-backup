		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Remember the first day when I saw your face
Remember the first day when you smiled at me
You stepped to me and then you said to me
I was the woman you dreamed about
Remember the first day when you called my house
Remember the first day when you took me out
We had butterflies, although we tried to hide it
And we both had a beautiful night

The way we held each others hand
The way we talked, the way we laughed
It felt so good to find true love
I knew right then and there you were the one, ooh

I know that he loves me 'cause he told me so
I know that he loves me 'cause his feelings show
When he stares at me
You see he cares for me
You see how he is so deep in love
I know that he loves me 'cause it's obvious
I know that he loves me 'cause it's me he trusts
And he's missin' me if he's not kissin' me
And when he looks at me, his brown eyes tell his soul

Remember the first day, the first day we kissed
Remember the first day we had an argument
We apologized, and then we compromised
And we haven't argued since
Remember the first day we stopped playing games
Remember the first day you fell in love with me
It felt so good for you to say those words
'Cause I felt the same way too

The way we held each others hands
The way we talked, the way we laughed
It felt so good to fall in love
And I knew right then and there you were the one, ooh-whoa

I know that he loves me 'cause he told me so
I know that he loves me 'cause his feelings show
When he stares at me
You see he cares for me
You see how he is so deep in love
I know that he loves me 'cause it's obvious
I know that he loves me 'cause it's me he trusts
And he's missin' me if he's not kissin' me
And when he looks at me, his brown eyes tell his soul

I'm so happy, so happy that you're in my life and baby
Now that you're a part of me you've shown me
Shown me the true meaning of love (the true meaning of love)
And I know he loves me

I know that he loves me 'cause he told me so
I know that he loves me 'cause his feelings show
When he stares at me
You see he cares for me
You see how he is so deep in love
I know that he loves me 'cause it's obvious
I know that he loves me 'cause it's me he trusts
And he's missin' me if he's not kissin' me
And when he looks at me, his brown eyes tell his soul

He looks at me and his brown eyes tell his soul
