		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I was younger, I would argue with my dad
Tell him that I hated him when I was talking back
Blocked his number, can't believe that I did that
Oh, I didn't have a reason, wish that I could take it back
But as the years went by
He was always by my side
To wipe all of the tears I cried

Now that I'm older, realized my father
Was doing the best he could do
Told him one day I'll have a son or a daughter
And when I'm a father too
I hope that I am just like you
I hope that I am just like you
I hope that I am just like you
I hope that I am just like you

Now I realize that he has struggles of his own
How could I be so selfish, oh, how could I block his phone?
Now I remember when my father lost his job
How he held a home together, for the family he was strong
And as the years went by
He was always by my side
To wipe all of the tears I cried

Now that I'm older, realized my father
Was doing the best he could do
Told him one day I'll have a son or a daughter
And when I'm a father too
I hope that I am just like you
I hope that I am just like you
I hope that I am just like you
I hope that I am just like you

(I hope that I am just like you)
I hope that I am just like you
(I hope that I am just like you)
I hope that I am just like you
(I hope that I am just like you)
I hope that I am just like you
(I hope that I am just like you)

Now that I'm older, realized my father
Was doing the best he could do
Told him one day I'll have a son or a daughter
And when I'm a father too
I hope that I am just like you
I hope that I am just like you
I hope that I am just like you
I hope that I am just like you
