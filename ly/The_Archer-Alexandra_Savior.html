		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The earth went ahead
And shook itself apart the very moment I laid eyes on you
I took some pleasure at the burning of the cross before
And heaven couldn't be so true

You ate me right up
You spit me back out
You bit my head right off with your tiny little mouth
I licked the blood from your lips

Don't need to tell you but your arrow's made of stars
And the shot that you've made punched it straight into my heart
It's a little ignorant but everybody's saying that forever is the place
Where you and I were made

You ate me right up
You spit me back out
You bit my head right off with your tiny little mouth
I licked the blood from your lips

You ate me right up
You spit me back out
You bit my head right off with your tiny little mouth
I licked the blood from your lips
