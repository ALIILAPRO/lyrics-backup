		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She's a beauty queen
Such a masterpiece
And my heart just skipped a beat
She so classical
So magical
Like an old school melody
That body got me stammering, so pretty got me suffering
Lift me out my seat
You're the fire to my gasoline
I'm burning up, I feel the heat (oh oh oh)

Yeah, nothing can beat the view
You're hot like July
(Raise the temp 200 degrees)
Tell me what am I gonna do?
You giving me fever every single time you walk into the room
(Somebody call the doctor)

Every time you walk by
Every time you say hi
Every time you put on a smile

I can't keep my cool
Think I need a dip in the swimming pool
'Cause you look so hot in your skintight denim
Ooh, sayin' stupid things that I shouldn't do
But I can't help myself
So pretty goin' "yes m'am!"
White T, killer ray bans
So c-c-cool-cool
You're so kool

Oh yeah, got my heart goin dum di di dum
Oh yeah, got my heart goin uh uh
Oh yeah got my heart goin dum di di dum
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

You look so sick better call the doctor
My head keep spinning like a helicopter
Going round and round, going front to back
You're giving me a heart attack
That body got me stammering, so pretty got me suffering
Lift me out my seat
You're the fire to my gasoline
I'm burning up, I feel the heat (oh oh oh oh)

Tell me what am I gonna do?
You giving me fever every single time you walk into the room
Somebody call 911

Every time you walk by
Every time you say hi
Every time you put on a smile

I can't keep my cool (hey!)
Think I need a dip in the swimming pool
'Cause you look so hot in your skintight denim
Ooh, sayin' stupid things that I shouldn't do
But I can't help myself
So pretty goin "yes m'am!"
White T, killer ray bans
So c-c-cool-cool
You're so kool

You got me going all crazy
You got me losing my mind
I wanna call you my baby
So say is that alright
Knock me out like a boxer
Good god you're a fancy talker
But I just can get enough
Gimme that chilly, chilly, chilly
Baby, you're so illy

Every time you walk by
Every time you say hi
Every time you put on a smile

I can't keep my cool (hey!)
Think I need a dip in the swimming pool
'Cause you look so hot in your skintight denim
Ooh, sayin stupid things that I shouldn't do
But I can't help myself
So pretty goin' "yes m'am!"
White T, killer ray bans
So c-c-cool-cool
You're so kool
