		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She was dressed to kill, I was in my boots
So I had to pay for the uptown top, yeah
But we talked for a while in a corner booth
Before closing time, she caught me by surprise

She said gimme a dirt road, the windows down
Wanna get lost on the edge of town
In your Chevrolet
She said gimme a six pack, some Brooks & Dunn
If you want a country girl you just found one
Let's slip away, yeah
In your Chevrolet

I think I fell in love right then and there
We were out the door before the end of the song
I said, "Where to?", She said, "I don't care
Just don't take me home, what you waiting on?"

Just gimme a dirt road, the windows down
Wanna get lost on the edge of town
In your Chevrolet
She said gimme a six pack, some Brooks & Dunn
If you want a country girl you just found one
Let's slip away, yeah
In your Chevrolet

Let's ride
In your Chevrolet

Lord knows I been
Praying for the day
A girl like her would say

Just gimme a dirt road, the windows down
Wanna get lost on the edge of town
In your Chevrolet (in your Chevrolet)
She said gimme a six pack, some Brooks & Dunn
If you want a country girl you just found one
Let's slip away (let's slip away)
In your Chevrolet
She said gimme a dirt road, the windows down
Wanna get lost on the edge of town
In your Chevrolet
Gimme a six pack, some Brooks & Dunn
If you want a country girl you just found one
Let's slip away
In your Chevrolet

Oh, in your Chevrolet
In your Chevrolet
