		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I only miss you when I'm breathing
I only need you when my heart is beating
You are the color that I'm bleeding
I only miss you when I'm breathing

This ain't no ordinary feeling
You are the only thing that I believe in
I know you're coming back to me (ay, ay ay, ay)
I will be waiting here for you 'til the end

I only miss you when I'm breathing
I only miss you when I'm breathing
Without your love, don't know how I survive
It's you, it's you that's keeping me alive
I only miss you when I'm breathing

Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ya
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, yo
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ya

I wanna see pictures of you leaning
All needs for walls, and on the ceiling
Gave you a kiss, but I am dreaming
These crazy thoughts are so deceiving
You are the drug, I am feeling
Paradise that I'm so seeking
I'm still alive, hope there's a reason
Can't move my lips, but my heart's screaming

I only miss you when I'm breathing
I only miss you when I'm breathing
Without your love, don't know how I survive
It's you, it's you that's keeping me alive
I only miss you when I'm breathing

Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ya
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, yo

Oh baby, I only miss you when I (ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ya)
I'm screaming at your name, but you don't answer me
I know I kissed your face, is this my fantasy?
Sound the alarm, tell everyone that I only miss you

I only miss you when I'm breathing (Baby)
I only miss you when I'm breathing
Without your love, don't know how I survive
It's you, it's you that's keeping me alive
I only miss you when I'm breathing (hey, hey, hey)

I only miss you when I'm breathing
