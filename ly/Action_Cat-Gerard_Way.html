		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We want television bodies that we can keep
We have battles in the dark when she falls asleep
We can make it up again
We can make it up again
And we don't care we just pretend
With the faces of the men
And don't ask a lot
And you won't lose a lot
Don't ask for much

Every accidental damage that I wouldn't take
And every heart I left behind that you couldn't break
We can make it up again
We can make it up again
And we don't care we just pretend
With the faces of the men
And don't ask a lot
And you won't lose a lot
Don't ask for much

And I still miss you
Say I missed you too
Still I miss you
Say I missed me too
Still I missed you
Say I missed me too

We want action and decision that we can fake
We got fire cracker wishes that we can make
We can make it up again
We can make it up again
And we don't care we just pretend
With the faces of the men
And don't ask a lot
And you won't lose a lot
Don't ask for much

Hey!
Do you miss me?
'Cause I miss you
Do you miss me?
'Cause I miss you
Do you miss me?
'Cause I miss you
Do you miss me?
'Cause I miss you so
