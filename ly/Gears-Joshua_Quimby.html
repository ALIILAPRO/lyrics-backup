		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, the tip of my thumb has been whittled like wood
The way i'm abusin' the lighter
I'm a-self-medicatin', a-tokin' all day and a-tryna fight fire with fire

I live by the pipe and i'll die by it to, least that's how it seems to me
The grass it's a-burnin', the gears they're a-churnin', and that's how it always will be

That's how it always will be
Well, i'm dazed and confused, on the floor of my room
In the company of constant concern
A-thinkin' through thoughts that've got me distraught for a reason I couldn't discern

The reefer it does what it knows to do best, a-settin' my troubled mind free
The grass it's a-burnin', the gears they're a-churnin', and that's how it always will be
That's how it always will be

Said I live by the pipe and i'll die by it to, least that's how it seems to me
The grass it's a-burnin', the gears they're a-churnin', and that's how it always will be
That's how it always will be
That's how it always will be
