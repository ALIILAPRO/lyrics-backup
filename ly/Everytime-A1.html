		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lately I'm not who I used to be
Someone's come and taken me
Where I don't want to go
If I knew exactly what I have to do
In order to be there for you
When you are feeling low

And all the things we ever wanted
Were once yours and mine
Now, I know we can revive it
All the love we left

Everytime I kiss I feel your lips
And
Everytime I cry I see your smile and
Everytime I close my eyes I realise that
Everytime I hold your hands in mine
The sweetest thing my heart could ever
Find
And I have never felt this way
Since the day I gave your love away

Save me, I've fallen from my
Destiny
You and I were meant to be
I've thrown it all away
Now you're gone
It's time for me to carry on
But baby I just can't go on
Without you by my side

And all the things we ever wanted
Were once yours and mine
Now, I know we can revive it
All the love we left

Everytime I kiss I feel your lips
And
Everytime I cry I see your smile and
Everytime I close my eyes I realise that
Everytime I hold your hand in mine
The sweetest thing my heart could ever
Find
And I have never felt this way
Since the day I gave your love away

We can survive it
All the pain we feel inside
You relied on me and now I've let you
Down
Now, I promise you forever
I will be the best I can
Now, I know we can revive it
All the love we left

Everytime I kiss I feel your lips
And
Everytime I cry I see your smile and
Everytime I close my eyes I realise that
Everytime I hold your hand in mine
The sweetest thing my heart could ever
Find
And I have never felt this way
Since the day I gave your love away

Everytime I kiss I feel your lips
And
Everytime I cry I see your smile and
Everytime I close my eyes I realise that
Everytime I hold your hand in mine
The sweetest thing my heart could ever
Find
And I have never felt this way
Since the day I gave your love away
