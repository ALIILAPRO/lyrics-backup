		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Woah, Harley darling
You took my love
You took him down the lonely road to the stars above
Woah, Harley darling
You took my friend
You took everything and now I'm alone again

Harley, won't you take me back to Hollywood?
Let me see him one more time
I'd hold him like I could
All night, so tight

Woah, Harley darling
The love of everyone
Roaring noise down the highway in the sun
Woah, Harley darling
You done me wrong
And now I'm all alone to sing this lonely song

Every time I close my eyes
I see you in my dreams
There you are, it seems so real
You whisper in my ear
It's alright, you hold me tight

Woah, Harley darling
You took my love
You took him down a lonely road to the stars above
Woah, Harley darling
You took my friend
You took everything and now, everything and now
You took everything and now, I'm alone again
