		  Ho
It's a lovely day
Haha
Yah, yah

Ayy
When I wake up, I go straight to the weed
Man, I just need to smoke, ayy
Then I get up and go
Straight to the liquor store, bottle of woes, ayy
I don't got much but love
All of my homies are waitin' outside, ayy
They know I'm ready to roll
Smokin' on hundreds, I'm ready to die, ayy

And by the way, we gettin' high today
Heaven's to Betsy, your bitch on my testies
I hit 'em like Messi, a mile away (ooh)
Like what's up with you?
Feel like Shamu, 'bouta ride the wave (Shamu)
Gravy come through for your boo
Fly away, to your bitch like
What's up? How you doin'?
Fuck some, PT cruisin'
At the club, I'm perusin'
Bust a nut and keep it movin'
That's that money talk (whoa)
Gravy got the club doin' bunny hops
I got the mighty Dodge V4 on my watch
And you must've got your shit at Craigswrist

When I wake up, I go straight to the weed
Man, I just need to smoke, ayy
Then I get up and go
Straight to the liquor store, bottle of woes, ayy
I don't got much but love
All of my homies are waitin' outside, ayy
They know I'm ready to roll
Smokin' on hundreds, I'm ready to die, ayy (yuh, yuh, yuh, okay)

I'm 'bout to log off (uh-huh), 'bout to nod off (uh-huh)
Askin' all these questions, I start resemble Nardwuar (uh)
Trick, huh? Ta-da, some rock Prada
Used to sell them drugs, always short 'em like a sawed-off
Half of mid to start off, thought I was a NARCO
Read between the line with me, I'm somethin' like a barcode
His white tee, we make it red, thought he leakin', sorrow
Seats in the whips same color bone marrow
Shh, I smell an enemy in the vicinity
And when the battle begins, I turn to an entity
Killin' shit like my last name was Kennedy
Stay killin' shit like shit is named Kennesy
Friend of me, enemies ain't the half you pretend to be
Only percentage of what I let you fuck niggas be
Sicker sauce, roll like carb patties with Jelly Bean
Built different, what you see in my damn anatomy, bitch?

When I wake up, I go straight to the weed
Man, I just need to smoke, ayy
Then I get up and go
Straight to the liquor store, bottle of woes, ayy
I don't got much but love
All of my homies are waitin' outside, ayy
They know I'm ready to roll
Smokin' on hundreds, I'm ready to die, ayy

Winter's in the backpack
Ride around the whole city in a black Jag'
You know Trippy keep it flippin' like a flapjack
If I'm goin' up north, then I go to my source (yeah)
But do stay on my course like a black cat (uh)
Head bent, look, baby, but I passed that
Now it's just a little somethin' I can laugh at
I just wanna get lit where the cool kids is
Where the wild things are, I'm a goddamn star
We about them bucks, we about them bars
If I ever get stuck, I don't gotta restart
I just need to get high, better land on Mars
Gotta lay in my broads, gotta get a new car
I just want another 'cause you breakin' my heart
I'm on another level, what you thinkin'?
Trippy got it, quick to drink it

Ayy 
When I wake up, I go straight to the weed
Man, I just need to smoke, ayy
Then I get up and go
Straight to the liquor store, bottle of woes, ayy
I don't got much but love
All of my homies are waitin' outside, ayy
They know I'm ready to roll
Smokin' on hundreds, I'm ready to die, ayy

When I wake up, I go straight to the weed
Man, I just need to smoke, ayy
Then I get up and go
Straight to the liquor store, bottle of woes, ayy
I don't got much but love
All of my homies are waitin' outside, ayy
They know I'm ready to roll
Smokin' on hundreds, I'm ready to die, ayy
