		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In the square, I waited for you
Trick, trick

She's the eye of the storm, born in the city I live
Her vanity's dressed up as virtue in broke shoes in our schools with tattoos upon the skin
She used to make do, but now she makes men
Fall at her feet, weak, their tongues leak, they try to stop talking 'cause now they don't make any sense

She was never academic
She couldn't draw a thing
But she had power over men
She had power over men
She had power over

So I drove to the bar, now I'm sipping on gin
I stare into space as the place seemed to get that little bit of something it was missing
She walked in, I could say she looked good, I could say she's just a friend
But that would just be me throwing you off the scent, she's everything an understatement has
She's under my skin

Like an anesthetic
You'll never feel a thing
'Cause she had power over men
She had power over men
She had power over

But as with any gift, there's always a twist
She can never really kiss, 'cause there's never remiss
Like giving everloves, you can never really win
It's the burden and a curse of her power over
Men

She had power over men
She had power over men
She had power over men
She had power over men
She had power over men
She had power over
