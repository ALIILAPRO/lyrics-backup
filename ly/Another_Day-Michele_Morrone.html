		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There was a time, when I felt inside
Love and hate, but you were mine
You were the only reason to make
My eyes smile over and over again
And I just feel this fear is eating me inside now

If you believed in my eyes
We would've had another day
And you just see me inside
I swear we would have another day
Another day
Hmm, I swear we would have another day

And I know, you told me a lot of lies
Something told me, I was going to fall straight down inside (down inside)
Ooh oh, this hell won't let me breathe so fine
But I can't allow you to fall on the ground
I would prefer to lose my head
My head

If you believed in my eyes
We would've had another day
And you just see me inside
We would have had another day

And I don't know, why somebody else is in your head
And it makes me feel, I'm getting crazy in my brain

If you believed in my eyes
I swear we would have another day
I swear we would have another day, ooh oh
Ooh, I swear we would have another day
Ooh, I swear we would have another day

Another day
