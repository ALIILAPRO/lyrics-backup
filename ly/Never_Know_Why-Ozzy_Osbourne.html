		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If we're offensive and pose a
Threat
You fear what we represent is
A mess
You've missed the message
That says it all
And you'll never know hy
Oh no you'll never know why

We rock

It's just a feeling how we
Excite
You cannot rule everybody in
Sight
But you condemn don't
Understand
And you'll never know why
Oh no you'll never know hwy

We rock rock rock
We rock rock rock
We rock rock rock
You'll never know why
We rock

I leave you cold and in disgust
Don't try to tame me you'll eat
My dust
I know that you know not what
You do
That's why you'll never know
Why
Oh no you'll never know why
We rock rock rock
We rock rock rock
We rock rock rock
You'll never know why
We rock rock rock
We rock rock rock
We rock rock rock
You'll never know why
We rock
