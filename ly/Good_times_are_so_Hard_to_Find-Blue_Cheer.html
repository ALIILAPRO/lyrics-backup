		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Norman Mayall & Kent Housman)
Some people talk about the blues
They're just handing you their news
It's the call of our love
But no matter how we try
We just try to get high
Cause the good times are so hard to find.


Have you got the time to share
Have you taken proper care
Of your body, anybody?
No one seems to see the signs
They reject them every time
Cause the good times are so hard to find.


Good times are so hard to find!
Good times are so hard to find!
Good times.


When I think of fun I think of you
Find out I can make it new
The light, just one night
Getting' on which is hers
Getting' harder everyday
Cause good times are so hard to find.


Some people talk about the blues
They're just handing you their news
It's the call of our love
But no matter how we try
We just try to get high
Cause the good times are so hard to find.


Good times are so hard to find!
Good times are so hard to find!
Good times are so hard to find!
Good times are so hard to find!
