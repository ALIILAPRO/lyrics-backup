		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Some kind of curse lies on this place
Where she is bound to live her lonely days
A hundred years may come and pass
Before the roses wither down at last
She's waited long, too long to say
And never fought the force that makes her stay
Some kind of curse lies on this place
And to her silent room she says
In a world out of time out of space
In a prison of thorns and disgrace
I will never surrender my mind
I will follow the path back to life
Cause I'm wide awake
Oh so wide awake
I will follow the path back to life
And I'll survive
Into the dark of sprawling plants
She rips the vines apart with her bare hands
Her fingers bleed, she cannot see
She only feels her longing to be free
Where is the light, where is the day
A million thorns are fighting her to stay
Some kind of curse lies on this place
And with a trembling voice she says
In a world out of time out of space ...
I'll survive

In a world out of time out of space ...
I'll survive
