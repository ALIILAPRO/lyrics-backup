		  I'm not in love
So don't forget it
I'm not in love
So don't forget it

Got a lotta things to be happy 'bout (got a lot)
Run my check up while they run they mouth (while they runnin', ayy)
Got you cussing on a Sunday now (good Lord)
Run my check up while they run they mouth (while they runnin', yeah)

(Run it up, run it up)
Shut yo', shut yo' goofy-ass up (shut up, bitch)
(Run it up, run it up) shut yo'
Shut yo' dumb-ass up (quiet down)

(Run it up, run it up) shut yo', yeah
Bitch, shut yo' goofy-ass up (shut up, bitch)
(Run it up, run it up) shut yo', yeah
Shut yo' dumb-ass up (quiet down)

They say they want money (they say they want money)
All they do is run they mouth (but all they do is run they mouth)
I swear all they do is complain (all they do is complain)
Bet you thought that shit was funny now
(Bet you thought that shit was funny now)
You thought you was doing something (you thought you was doing something)
How you hating on the Lord's day, now? (How you hating on the Lord's day, now?)
How you hating on a Sunday? (How you hating on a Sunday?)
Go and take a look at your account (go and take a look at yours)
Yeah (yours)

It's that weird swag (it's that weird)
Weird money, weird bitches
Put me near that (near that)
Prolly see her in her brand new Hollyweird bag (yeah)
Shawty red flag, put-you-to-the-test bag
Got good head up on her shoulders, hope this neck last (yeah)
I'ma fall off when I want, they gon' respect that (yeah)
Setbacks never stopped me, let them get dragged (yeah)
Get back, lil' ho, you don't know me like that
Ex-lax, they ain't shit, they need to check facts

Got a lotta things to be happy 'bout (got a lot) (check, check)
Run my check up while they run they mouth (while they runnin', ayy)
(Check, check)
Got you cussing on a Sunday now (good Lord) (got you cussin')
Run my check up while they run they mouth (while they runnin', yeah)
(Check, check)

(Run it up, run it up)
Shut yo', shut yo' goofy-ass up (shut up, bitch)
(Run it up, run it up) shut yo'
Shut yo' dumb-ass up (quiet down)

(Run it up, run it up) shut yo', yeah
Bitch, shut yo' goofy-ass up (shut up, bitch) (yeah)
(Run it up, run it up) shut yo', yeah
Shut yo' dumb-ass up (quiet down) (yeah)

I'm a, I'm a, I'm a rich body bitch, thick body bitch
Y'all gon' make me sick body bitch, where's Roddy Rich?
Put you in the box body, bitch, get bodied, bitch
You don't wanna talk body, bitch, lips prolly zip
Stop calling me sis body bitch, we not a kin
You do not exist to me, miss, I'm not your friend
I'ma let 'em wish 'bout me, bitch, kiss 'bout me, bitch
Y'all be steady dick-riding, don't you piss on me, bitch
I just want my toes in the sand, one hunnid bands
Body looking real overseas, hips motherland
I can't even sit in my chair, zip up my pants
I did all the things I ain't need, I don't wanna dance, ah

Got a lotta things to be happy 'bout (got a lot) (happy 'bout, ay)
Run my check up while they run they mouth (while they runnin', ayy)
(Run my check up while they)
Got you cussing on a Sunday now (good Lord) (on a Sunday)
Run my check up while they run they mouth (while they runnin', yeah)
