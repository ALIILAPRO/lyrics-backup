		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  "Do not enter" is written on the doorway
Why can't everyone just go away?
Except you, you can stay
What do you think of my treehouse?
It's where I sit and talk really loud
Usually, I'm all by myself

Ooh-ooh-ooh

I'm the captain, but you can be the deputy
I'm really glad you think I'm so funny
I don't think I'm ever gonna let you leave
