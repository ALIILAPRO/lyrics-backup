		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Girl, come through and let's do
What we do in your imagination
Girl, come through and let's do
What we do in your imagination
Girl, come through and let's do
What we do in your imagination
Girl, come through and let's do
What we do in your imagination
Girl, come through and let's do
What we do in your imagination
Girl, come through and let's do
What we do in your imagination

I seem depressed
Always being bothered, never less
Keeping me out of prison and
Putting me to test
They ask me what is happiness
You write it on a check
Or you feel it on the sweat
When your dick is in the breast (huh)
Rap critic and I've been a sack, nigga
Who's blizzard
Is raps bigger Than mеn in a pack
Bring to the top of a gap
Grip and I bust all the
Wack niggas, tartar or plaque, nigga
What do you choosе, simply irrelevant
Sinical evident, please
Wrestling evidence keys
Moving one indefinite soul goes
For the president bleed
Red for the government tease residue
Soil in your kettle place
Right where your bezel lay
Cold blizzardly, ghost entity, gold digger
Carminity? your friend, he cold swinging
Gas in your casket couldn't
Be stashed feeling
Dope soldier the coast rover the gat
Wrestling evidence keys
Moving one indefinite soul goes
For the president bleed
Red for the government tease residue
Soil in your kettle place
Right where your bezel lay
Cold blizzardly, ghost entity, gold digger
Carminity? your friend, he cold swinging
Gas in your casket couldn't
Be stashed feeling
Dope soldier the coast rover the gat
