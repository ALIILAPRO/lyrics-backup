		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Please beware
The voice in your head is a threat

Madness, is all that I can breathe under the ashes
The scars from my past are like matches
Soaked in kerosene
Now everyone can see

Restless, I'm buried in the clouds
But I'm weightless
There's blood in my mouth, I can taste it
I'm starting to believe the voices inside of me

Will you pull me out of the dark
When I'm falling, falling apart dead inside?
I don't know how it all began
And I don't want it all to end me
The voice in my head is a threat (paranoid)

Paranoid, paranoid
The voice in my head is a threat (paranoid)
Paranoid, paranoid
The voice in my head is a threat

Voices screaming in my face in the darkness
Falling from the sky like ashes
Now it's my turn
I'm about to crash, crash and burn

Crash and burn
The voice in my head is a threat

Will you pull me out of the dark
When I'm falling, falling apart dead inside?
I don't know how it all began
And I don't want it all to end me
The voice in my head is a threat, paranoid

I pushed you out to keep it inside
The voice in my head is a threat
I lie awake, still wondering why
The voice in my head is a threat

I pushed you out to keep it inside
The voice in my head is a threat
I lie awake, still wondering why
The voice in my head is a threat

Get out of my head
Get out of my head

Will you pull me out of the dark
When I'm falling, falling apart dead inside?
I don't know how it all began
And I don't want it all to end me
The voice in my head is a threat, paranoid

I pushed you out to keep it inside
The voice in my head is a threat
I lie awake, still wondering why
The voice in my head is a threat
I pushed you out to keep it inside
The voice in my head is a threat (paranoid)

Paranoid, paranoid
The voice in my head is a threat (paranoid)
Paranoid, paranoid
The voice in my head is a threat (paranoid)
Paranoid, paranoid
The voice in my head is a threat
