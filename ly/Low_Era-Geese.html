		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Some are born with the psychic inflection Catastrophic when they go in the street
It comes to people like you naturally Leaving me blind to all time and all direction
Killing your nature just to irritate me
You lie every time you turn away and
You’re too naïve to be so petty
You’re only choosing what you’re going to say
In the middle of the night, she calls me And all I know is patience and love for you Pulls me up into the sky when she asks me What am I gonna do, what am I gonna do
Swimming alone in a seaworld wasteland Floating lifeless to the edge of the pool Pulls me up into the sky when she asks me
Modern magazines and holy scriptures My play rehearsals all go unheard Love is running a little faster
Losing my body with one ancient word
On the hour of my death the page rips All is lost and I am left to rot
The beginning of the end approaches You and I, we float up to the top
I am dead for one moment
I am dead for one moment
The lord speaks for one moment Heating up for one moment
Swimming alone in a seaworld wasteland Floating lifeless to the edge of the pool Pulls me up into the sky when she asks me
