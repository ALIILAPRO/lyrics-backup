		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And they wonder why you changed my life
You made things right, stood by my side
Like a lullaby, you soothed my mind
You helped me smile, opened my eyes

Love in your guidance
Love in your eyes
I'm in a plastic world with you
But it's your lovin' that makes me feel real

Where have you been my life
Desire
And I'm wondering if you know you're my
Desire
I wonder can we share our lives
Desire
I wonder if you'll stay by my side
Desire

When it's you and I, there is no time 
Together we vibrate high
All I want is to feel
You deep inside

Love in your guidance
Love in your eyes
I'm in a plastic world with you
But it's your lovin' that makes me feel real

Where have you been my life
Desire
And I'm wondering if you know you're my
Desire
I wonder can we share our lives
Desire
I wonder if you'll stay by my side
Desire
(Will you stay right by my side?)
Where have you been my life
Desire
(Hold me closer to the light)
And I'm wondering if you know you're my (you're my, you're my true desire)
Desire (lead us home, lead us home)
I wonder can we share our lives (share our lives, that's the real desire)
Desire (you're my true desire)
I wonder if you'll stay by my side
Desire

Where have you been my life
Desire
Where have you been my life
Desire
Where have you been my life
Desire
