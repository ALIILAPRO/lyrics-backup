		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Those who are dead, are not dead
They're just living in my head
And since I fell for that spell
I am living there as well
Oh,

Time is so short and I'm sure
There must be something more

Those who are dead, are not dead
They're just living in my head, oh
And since I fell for that spell
I am living there as well, oh

Time is so short and I'm sure
There must be something more.

You thought you might be a ghost
You thought you might be a ghost
You didn't get to heaven but you made it close
You didn't get to heaven but you made it close

You thought you might be a ghost
You thought you might be a ghost
You didn't get to heaven but you made it close
You didn't get to heaven but you oh, oh,

Oh, oh,

Those who are dead are not dead
They're just living in my head
Oh
