		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ain't this what they've been waitin' for?
You ready? Uh, uh

I used to pray for times like this, to rhyme like this
So I had to grind like that to shine like this
And a matter of time I spent on some locked up shit
In the back of the paddy wagon, cuffs locked on wrists
See my dreams unfold, nightmares come true
It was time to marry the game and I said, "Yeah, I do"
If you want it you gotta see it with a clear-eyed view
Got shorty, she tryna bless me like I said achoo
Like a nigga sneezed, nigga please, 'fore them triggers squeeze
I'm gettin' cream, never let them hoes get in between
Of what we started, lil' nigga but I'm lionhearted
They love me when I was stuck and they hated when I was departed
I go and get it regardless, draw it like I'm an artist
No crawlin', went straight to walkin' with foreigns in my garages
All foreign bitches m√©nagin', fuckin', suckin', and swallowin'
Anything for a dollar, they tell me get 'em, I got 'em
I did it without an album
I did shit with Mariah
Lil' nigga, I'm on fire
Icy as a hockey rink, Philly nigga, I'm flyer
When I bought the Rolls-Royce they thought it was leased
Then I bought that new Ferrari, hater, rest in peace
Hater, rest in peace, rest in peace to the parking lot
Phantom so big, can't even fit in the parking spot
You ain't talkin' 'bout my niggas, then what you talkin' 'bout?
Gangstas move in silence, nigga, and I don't talk a lot
I don't say a word, I don't say a word
Was on my grind and now I got what I deserve, fuck nigga (Maybach Music)

Hold up, wait a minute (minute), y'all thought I was finished? (Whoa)
When I bought that Aston Martin, y'all thought it was rented? (Yeah)
Flexin' on these niggas, I'm like Popeye on his spinach
Double M, yeah, that's my team, Rozay the captain, I'm lieutenant
I'm the type to count a million cash then grind like I'm broke
That Lambo' my new bitch, she don't ride like my Ghost
I'm ridin' 'round my city with my hands strapped on my toast
'Cause these niggas want me dead and I gotta make it back home
'Cause my mama need that bill money, my son need some milk
These niggas tryna take my life, they fuck around, get killed
You fuck around, you fuck around, you fuck around, get smoked
'Cause these Philly niggas I brought with me don't fuck around, no joke, no
All I know is murder, when it come to me
I got young niggas that's rollin', I got niggas throwin' B's
I done did the DOA's, I done did the KOD's
Every time I'm in that bitch, I get to throwin' thirty G's
But now I'm hangin' out that drop head, I'm ridin' down on Collins (skrrt)
They let my nigga Ern back home, that young nigga be wildin' (let's go)
We young niggas, we mobbin' (mobbin'), like Batman and we're robbin' (whoa)
In this two-door Maybach, with my seat all reclinin'
I'm like, "Real nigga, what up? Real nigga, what up?"
If you ain't about that murder game, then pussy nigga, shut up
If you diss me in your raps, I'll get your pussy-ass stuck up
When you touchdown in my hood, no, that tour life ain't good
Catch me down in MIA, at that Heat game on wood
With that Puma life on my feet, like that little engine I could
Boy, I slide down on your block (block), bike on 12 o'clock (rah)
And they be throwin' deuces, I'm the same nigga they watch (Meek Milly)
And I'm the king of my city 'cause I'm still callin' them shots
And these lames talkin' that bullshit, the same niggas that flopped
I'm the same nigga from Berks Street with them nappy braids, that lock
The same nigga that came up and I had to wait for my spot
And these niggas hatin' on me, hoes waitin' on me
Still on that hood shit, my Rolls-Royce on E
They gon' remember me, I say remember me
So much money, have your friends turn to your enemies
And when there's beef, I turn my enemies to memories
Weigh them bricks, they go for forty, ain't no ten a ki
Hold up, broke nigga turned rich (rich), love the game like Mitch
And if I leave, you think them pretty hoes gon' still suck my dick?
It was somethin' 'bout that Rollie when it first touched my wrist
Had me feelin' like that dope boy when he first touched that brick
I'm gone
Woo
