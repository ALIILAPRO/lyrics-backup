		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She sneaks behind in her bedroom
Her shadow stays in the dancefloor
Well, the fingernails are sharp and the mascara wears out

Leaving her lipstick on my place
To make travel on her face
The more you take your sight you get my dreams in a fight

And if you like to see me crying
You will enjoy smoking my aches
I see you drinking "Limonada"
Down in the corner eating fellas
You aren't right 
Baby, they like when you are mad

She dance alone in the hallway
Expecting someone light her fire
In the smoke, she looks alive, her tingle is fancy tonight

And if you like to see me crying
You will enjoy smoking my aches
I see you drinking "Limonada"
Down in the corner eating fellas
You aren't right 
Baby, they like when you are mad
