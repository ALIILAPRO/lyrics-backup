		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What you think about
You and me, baby, goin' one-on-one (say what)
JD y'all (uh huh, So So Def)
MC y'all (what you think about)
I'm the man to fulfill your needs
Get you everything that you see in your dreams (come on)
Baby, lighten up and let nobody tear us apart
And forever you'll be my sweetheart

Boy, haven't you noticed
A gleam in my eye
Because of you
I'm a little hypnotized (yeah)
But every time you're with me
I feel so positive
Now with a little love
Something's got to give

A full moon (yeah, yeah)
Is waiting in the twilight
Maybe soon
You will come to be my knight
Here we are
Hoping that we never part
Stay with me

Baby, won't you be my sweetheart (my sweetheart)
We could share a storybook romance
What you think about, what you think about
You and me, baby, goin' one-on-one
Won't you be my sweetheart (my sweetheart)
We could share a storybook romance, baby
What you think about, what you think about
You and me, baby, goin' one-on-one

You are no Casanova
I know that you'll be true
And that's why
I'm so in love with you (me)
But each romantic evening
You leave me at my door
But tonight
I'd like us to explore

A full moon
Is waiting in the twilight
Maybe soon
You will come to be my night
Here we are
Hoping that we never part
Stay with me

Baby, won't you be my sweetheart (my sweetheart)
We could share a storybook romance
What you think about, what you think about
You and me, baby, goin' one-on-one
Won't you be my sweetheart (my sweetheart) oh, yeah
We could share a storybook romance, baby
What you think about, what you think about
You and me, baby, goin' one-on-one, come on

Na-na-na-na-na (say what)
Na-na-na-na-na (like that)
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na (break it down)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Put your hands in the air
JD y'all, MC y'all

See, I saw you in the party with your eyes on me
Fittin' the description of what I want my bride to be
As live as me, don't know the same guys as me
But a lot of style, unusual name like Ivory
I agree with my
You the baddest I ever seen in a long time
But woman with her own shine is her own time
And it's on hit
'Cause I'm tired of dealin' with the wrong kind
Getting nothin' but the bull
She got a player tryna think of new things to say (Sup, baby?)
She up in the corner sippin' Dom P rose
Shakin' it up with the homegirls
Payin' no attention to us
They in they own world
Ayo, girl
I'm the man to fulfill your needs (sweet)
Get you everything that you see in your dreams
Baby, let nothing, nobody tear us apart (yeah)
If forever you'll be my sweetheart

Stars are bright (uh-huh)
Mood is right haha (Haha, say what?)
(MC, baby, sing it to me, sing it to me)
To keep me warm away from harm (come on, uh-huh)
Nowhere better than my baby's arms (uh-huh, uh-huh)
Stars are bright (uh-huh)
Mood is right (say what?)
(MC, baby, sing it to me, sing it to me)
To keep me warm away from harm
(Come on, baby, baby, come on)
Won't you be my (you can be my)

Sweetheart (sweetheart)
We could share a storybook romance
(Yeah, don't you like how its going down?)
(Uh, don't you like how it's going down?)
Won't you be mine (Won't you be my sweetheart? Aww, yeah)
We could share a storybook romance (Uh-huh)
Oh baby, be mine, baby
(Don't you like how it's going down?)
(Uh, don't you like how its going down?)
Sweetheart

Come on, let's get together
(We can share a storybook romance) (yeah, uh)
And live happily ever after (won't you be mine?)
(Uh, yeah, So So Def)
No one to make us sad (uh-huh)
(We can share a storybook romance) oh baby (yeah)
Oh, just you be mine (Mariah, you on fire, haha, JD, y'all)
You know I need your love (yeah)
Romance (yeah, yeah, me too)
