		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My eye dey red
Many things for my head
Many things from my plate
I Dey scratch bear bear
Trouble come any day
I no Dey panic o
I no Dey fear
Why they wan cash my cheque?
When dem no follow me sweat
That shit so weird
I no Dey like to pretend
What you see is what you get
Oh yeah yeah

If I Dey down na who go lift me up?
If battery low na who go charge me up?
Is you my friend only in good times?
Shey you go Dey when I'm not fine
If you no go Dey when it's war time
No go show your face when my sunshine
If I Dey down na who go lift me up?
If battery low na who go charge me up?
Is you my friend only in good times?
Shey you go Dey when I'm not fine
If you no go Dey when it's war time
No go show your face when my sunshine

Only God can save me
Only God can save me
I don't trust nobody o
Only God can save me
Only God can save me
Only God can save me
Only God can save me
Save me, save me

Baba save me
No forsake me
Ti n won ba le mi
Ma je ko rimi
I don't know it all
And I no go form o
I no be perfect person
But I Dey give my all o

If I Dey down na who go lift me up?
If battery low na who go charge me up?
Is you my friend only in good times?
Shey you go Dey when I'm not fine
If you no go Dey when it's war time
No go show your face when my sunshine
If I Dey down na who go lift me up?
If battery low na who go charge me up?
Is you my friend only in good times?
Shey you go Dey when I'm not fine
If you no go Dey when it's war time
No go show your face when my sunshine

Only God can save me (only God)
Only God can save me (only God)
I don't trust nobody o (no)
Only God can save me
Only God can save me
Only God can save me
Only God can save me
Save me, save me
