		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She want Celine, she want the Gucci
I ride with some hundreds on me, I got the blue cheese
Pull up in a Jeep, I put it on Forgi'
I want your body, gimme slop top on the front seat
We gon' fuck for an hour then we gon' move to the back seat
When you give me a lap dance, baby, watch for the gat, please
Run it back, run it back, run it back, run it back like a track meet
Bae, relax me, you ain't gotta ask me, huh

G'yeah-g'yeah, huh, I blew her back out
Fuckin' that bitch got her tappin' out
Got me bustin' like the bustin' the racks out
I got her ridin' in the four door, huh
Draped in designer, no Polo, huh
I was in the Wraith at the Waldorf
Bought all the cars off of coco
I gotta drape you up
She got bad bitches naked with us
I got diamonds, gon' drip on the pussy
Keep 'em in the cut
I keep a bad foreign
She know that she comin', of course
Had to throw that fat ass in a Porsche
Got her face down, that ass to the north
Yeah, yeah

She want Celine, she want the Gucci
I ride with some hundreds on me, I got the blue cheese
Pull up in a Jeep, I put it on Forgi'
I want your body, gimme slop top on the front seat
We gon' fuck for an hour then we gon' move to the back seat
When you give me a lap dance, baby, watch for the gat, please
Run it back, run it back, run it back, run it back like a track meet
Bae, relax me, you ain't gotta ask me (Dolla $ign)

She want Celine ('Line)
I'm the Celine King ('Line king)
Eat the pussy with my grill on
Put it all on my bling-bling (bling-bling)
I call her my lil' mama, she want new Balenciaga (ooh, yeah)
Sippin' sak√© at the 'Bu 'cause we can't go to Benihana's
2020, 720S
It's a race car (car), better yet it's a jet
Tint my windows black (black), gimme toppy at the light (skrrt)
Is you into that? Baby, pull them panties to the side
We go rounds like some boxing shit (sheesh)
But I give you way more than three minute increments (three)
I spent a hundred on a ring on my pinky (ring)
She said she love me every time when I'm leavin' (leave)
I'm a fucking sex symbol (sheesh)

She want Celine, she want the Gucci
I ride with some hundreds on me, I got the blue cheese
Pull up in a Jeep, I put it on Forgi'
I want your body, gimme slop top on the front seat
We gon' fuck for an hour then we gon' move to the back seat
When you give me a lap dance, baby, watch for the gat, please
Run it back, run it back, run it back, run it back like a track meet
Bae, relax me, you ain't gotta ask me
