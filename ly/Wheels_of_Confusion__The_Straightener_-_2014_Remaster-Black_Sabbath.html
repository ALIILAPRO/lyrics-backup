		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Long ago I wandered thru my mind
In the land of fairy tales and stories
Lost in happiness I knew no fears
Innocence and love was all I knew
It was an illusion

Soon the days were passing into years
Happiness just didn't come so easy
Life was more than fairy tales and daydreams
Innocence was just another word
It was an illusion

Lost in the wheels of confusion
Running thru valleys of tears
Eyes full of angry delusion
Hiding in everyday fears

So I found that life is just a game
But you know there's never been a winner
Try your hardest, you'll still be a loser
The world will still be turning when you're gone
Yeah, when you're gone
