		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take my eyes, the things I've seen
In this world coming to an end
My reflection fades, I'm weary
Of these earthly bones and skin

You may pass through me and
Leave no trace, I have no mortal face
Solar winds are whispering
You may hear me call

We can shed our skins and swim
Into the darkened void beyond
We will dance among the world
That orbit stars that aren't our sun

All the oxygen that trapped us in
A carbon spider's web
Solar winds are whispering
You may hear the sirens of the dead
Let the elders to their parley
Meant to satisfy our lust
Leaving Damocles still hanging
Over all their promised trust

Walk away from freedoms offered
By the jailors in their cage
Step into the light, star tripping
Over mortals in their rage

Starblind with sun
The stars are one
We are the light that brings the end of night
Starblind with sun
The stars are one
We are with the Goddess of the sun tonight

The preacher loses face with Christ
Religion's cruel device is gone
Empty flesh and hollow bones
Make pacts of love but die alone
The crucible of pain will forge 
The blanks of sin, begin again
You are free to choose a life to live
Or one that's left to lose

Virgins in the teeth of God
Are meat and drink to feed the damned
You may pass through me
And Iill feel the life that you live less
Step into my light, star tripping
We will rage against the night
Walk away from comfort
Offered by your citizens of death

Starblind with sun
The stars are one
We are the light that brings the end of night
Starblind with sun
The stars are one
We are with the Goddess of the sun tonight

Take my eyes for what I've seen
I will give my sight to you
You are free to choose whatever
Life to live or life to lose
Whatever God you know
He knows you better than you believe
In your once and future grave
You'll fall endlessly deceived

Look into our face reflected
In the moonglow in your eyes
Remember you can choose to look 
But not to see and waste your hours

You believe you have the time
But I tell you your time is short
I see your past and future
All the same and it cannot be bought

Starblind with sun
The stars are one
We are the light that brings the end of night
Starblind with sun
The stars are one
We are with the Goddess of the sun tonight

Take my eyes for what I've seen
I will give my sight to you
You are free to choose whatever
Life to live or life to lose
Whatever God you know
He knows you better than you believe
In your once and future grave
You'll fall endlessly deceived

The preacher loses face with Christ
Religion's cruel device is gone
Empty flesh and hollow bones
Make pacts of love but die alone
The crucible of pain will forge 
The blanks of sin, begin again
You are free to choose a life to live
Or one that's left to lose
