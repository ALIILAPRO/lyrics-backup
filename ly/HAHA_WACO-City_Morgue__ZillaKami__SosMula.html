		  (Yung Germ)
(Damn, Ryder)

Nigga, pick yo' friends up (doot-doot-doot-doot-doot)
Nigga, pick yo' high command up
Dog pound, bitch, I'm Charles Manson
They ain't even see me 'til it's too late, pop his eardrums
Now he walk like he in the mud (yeah)
Write it in his blood so they knew just who it was (okay)
Like I was MS, I take machetes, cut 'em up (yeah)
I'ma send 'em up, turn your wifey to a slut
Turn her husband to a cuck
Not scared of everyone, put one in his dreadlocks (okay)
Not scared of anyone, Satan in a headlock (yeah)
3 A.M. I'm at yo' house, pussy, knock knock (yeah)
And I got a beam, make a nigga scream (what? What?)

Yeah, knock knock, mh, hahahaha
Yeah, knock knock, mh, hahahaha
Yeah, knock knock, mh, hahahaha
Yeah, knock knock, mh, hahahaha (ewok, ewok)

If we pull up then we hoppin' out that rental van (vyoom, vyoom)
I put this metal in ya mouth just like a dental plan (doot-doot-doot-doot-doot)
Bitch, you talking to the boss, don't talk to middle man
Ain't got no money for ya corpse, here go a rental plan (give me that, give me that)
Yeah, the chop chop like a broom broom (doot-doot-doot-doot)
I'm a hot shot, I'm a goon goon (ewok, ewok)
The drop top it go vroom vroom (skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
Yeah, knock knock, boom boom (doot-doot-doot-doot-doot-doot-doot)

Yeah, knock knock, mh, hahahaha
Yeah, knock knock, mh, hahahaha
Yeah, knock knock, mh, hahahaha
Yeah, knock knock, mh, hahahaha

(Mh, hahahaha)
(Mh, hahahaha)
(Mh, hahahaha)
(Mh, hahahaha)
