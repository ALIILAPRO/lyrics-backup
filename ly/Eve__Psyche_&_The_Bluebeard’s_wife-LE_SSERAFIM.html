		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm a mess, mess, mess, mess, mess, mess, mess
I'm a mess, mess, mess, mess, mess, mess, mess
I'm a mess in distress
But we're still the best dressed
Fearless, say yes, we don't dress to impress

괜찮단다 뭘 해도 
거짓말인 걸 난 알아
괜찮겠지 뭘 해도 
착한 얼굴에 니 말 잘 들을 땐

괜찮지 않아 그런 건 
내 룰은 나만 정할래 yeah
볼 거야 금지된 걸
Never hold back 더 자유롭게

Boom, boom, boom 내 심장이 뛰네
Get it like boom, boom, boom
Get it like boom, boom, boom (boom, boom now)
Boom, boom, boom 내 심장이 뛰네
Get it like boom, boom, boom
Get it like boom, boom, boom (push it) 

(Oh-oh) I wish for what's forbidden
Get it like boom, boom, boom
Get it like boom, boom, boom (push it) 
(Oh-oh) I wish for what's forbidden
Get it like boom, boom, boom
Get it like boom, boom, boom (oh-oh)

I'm a mess, mess, mess, mess, mess, mess, mess
I'm a mess, mess, mess, mess, mess, mess, mess
I'm a mess in distress
But we're still the best dressed
Fearless, say yes, we don't dress to impress

웃어, 웃어, 더 인형이 되렴 (ah-ah-ah)
덮어, 덮어, 다 감정 따윈 다
싫어, 싫어, 난 인형이 아냐 (ah-ah-ah)
찡그린대도 그것도 나야

보지 말람 보고 파
날 둘러싼 이 금기들 yeah
그날의 이브처럼
Take it on the chain, I know I like that

Boom, boom, boom 내 심장이 뛰네
Get it like boom, boom, boom
Get it like boom, boom, boom (boom, boom now)
Boom, boom, boom 내 심장이 뛰네
Get it like boom, boom, boom
Get it like boom, boom, boom (push it) 

(Oh-oh) I wish for what's forbidden
Get it like boom, boom, boom
Get it like boom, boom, boom (push it) 
(Oh-oh) I wish for what's forbidden
Get it like boom, boom, boom
Get it like boom, boom, boom (oh-oh)

What you waiting for?
이게 타락이면 we fall, fall, fall (oh-oh)
What you looking for?
원한다면 now we fall, we fall, we fall

Boom, boom, boom 내 심장이 뛰네
Get it like boom, boom, boom
Get it like boom, boom, boom (boom, boom now)
Boom, boom, boom 내 심장이 뛰네
Get it like boom, boom, boom
Get it like boom, boom, boom (push it) 

Girl wanna have fun (girl)
Girl wanna have fun (girl)
Get it like boom, boom, boom
Get it like boom, boom, boom

Girl wanna have fun (girl)
Girl wanna have fun (girl)
Get it like boom, boom, boom
Get it like boom, boom, boom
