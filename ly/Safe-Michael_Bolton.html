		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When the rain keeps on falling like tears from the sky
And your heart feels like breaking in the cold hearted night 
When you're lost in the shadows to tired to fight 
I will be there, I will be there 
You'll find me time after time 

Whoa
I'll keep you safe
I will keep you safe
Don't you be afraid
I'll keep you safe
Ooh-whoa-oh

I will come to your rescue and light up the dark 
I'll be your shelter wherever you are
I'll carry your troubles and cover your heart
I will be there, I will be there
You'll find me time after time

Whoa
I'll keep you safe
I will keep you safe
So don't you be afraid
I will keep you safe

Safe from the battle and safe through the storm
I'll be your refuge wherever you go
No matter what comes our way 
I'll keep you safe 
I'll keep you safe 

For always and always
For now and for always 
I'll keep you safe

Wherever you go
I'll keep you safe
I will keep you safe
Don't you be afraid
I will keep you safe

Safe from the battle and safe through the storm
I'll be your refuge wherever you go
No matter what comes our way 
I'll keep you safe (I'll keep you, I'll keep you)

For always (I'll keep you, I'll keep you)
I'll keep you safe (I'll keep you, I'll keep you)
Forever and always (I'll keep you, I'll keep you)

When the rain keeps on falling like tears from the sky
I'll be your shelter, I will keep you safe
