		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  [Verse One]
What you want? Hot shit to the death
How do you like this sound? Exactly what I meant
Looptroop is hotness for Babylon intruders
gun salute shooters & everyday music consumers
You can't bruise us, better chew that paper
Talk shit, we a go slew the perpetrators
We heard you hate us, we hurt you fakers
It takes more than your jealous ass to break us
This shit is pumpin' wrecking your sound detector
After twenty records still top choice for selectors
In every sector all over the tour
we bring an all out war on all of your laws
We go all out raw all over your domain
The whole world know these four, who knows your name?
We leavin' stains on your parliaments
then go to the next sold out show, who want arguments?

[Chorus]
Don't hate the player, don't hate the game
Hate the troop man we take all blame
that you got no money, you got no fame
that you got no honeys, you got no name

[Verse Two]
Lace up your sneakers, show off with your speakers
Now, raise up your glass, make sure it's twelve centilitres
Blao, salute the dj when the crowd's off the meters
Aaoh, let's make it hot, tank tops and wife beaters
Yo, go tell your women I'm an asshole, I don't care
No, I don't get lucky, that's skill, life's unfair
Wow, I know it hurts to see the girls, see the gear
So, you gotta let it out on somebody in here
True, I understand, I make you look bad in your hometown
Fool, but I'm a leave tomorrow, you'll get back that torn crown
Cool, swallow your pride, get up here, gimme a false pound
Boo, tough on your ego, but it's rough to be small time
Ok, two can play that game, I'll shake your hand and smile, fuck it
Say, nothing man, I'm working in my high so cut it
Hey, I know the best thing we could do is stay above it
Ha ha, you must hate the troop as much as I love it!

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
Yo I'm bringin' the monstafunk your babymoms a pump
the ladies' hearts a thump, your neighboursÂ´ cars a bump
this shit till they cause a roadblock for four blocks
You say call the riotsquad! I say poor cops!
They don't know what they're in for
They won't come prepared they didn't get the right info
...mation, no bio, no presentation
Well here it is man - the proper education
The lowdown on the whole sound
Hope you're good at taking notes cus I won't slow down, check it!
Looptroop is the textbook example:
You can't fuck with beats, texts, hooks and samples
A classic before it even hits the plastic
But can they do it again? No need to ask it
You know we bring it from the heart every time
You know you need to press start then rewind
or you might miss a vital part of the rhyme
cus that's just the type of thought we design
So Looptroop is still hated by everyone
cus Looptroop is still better than anyone... what!?

[Chorus]
