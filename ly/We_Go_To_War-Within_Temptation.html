		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I never thought I'd be here, so unreal to me
I can't believe my own eyes, believe my own mind
The reality of cruelty in vain
The freedom, lives of millions at stake
Our hearts will be invincible, we'll be unforgivable

Won't stand aside when our loved ones dying

And when we hear the call, we go to war
And leave it all now to bring it back again
Now, nothing else really matters
We'll defy 'til the end
Oh, when we hear the call, we go to war

We go to war

Pounding strikes like rain, I know they're chasing me
It won't be the last time, but they'll die while they try
It's a hell on earth, I want to awake
There's no rest at all, the blows that we take
Our hearts are still invincible, it's so unforgivable

Won't stand aside when our loved ones dying

And when we hear the call, we go to war
And leave it all now to bring it back again
Now, nothing else really matters
We'll defy 'til the end
Oh, when we hear the call, we go to war

(Now we're dying)
And when we hear the call, we go to war
And leave it all now to bring it back again
Now, nothing else really matters
We'll defy 'til the end
Oh, when we hear the call, we go to war
