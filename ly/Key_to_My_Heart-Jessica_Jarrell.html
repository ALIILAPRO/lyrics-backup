		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Boy you put me on the spot
I don't know what to say
But I'm trying anyway
Like my heart's gonna drop
My mind drifts away
And I can't control the pains

Words are spinning in my head
Don't know why I'm holding back
I should just tell you how I'm feeling yeah

But I don't wanna act a fool
Don't wanna look confused
If I let you know about the way I feel
Don't know what you gonna do
So I keep it locked inside
And imagine you were mine
And I'm feeling you so close but yet so far
You hold the key to my heart (my heart)

My, my, my, my, my heart (the key, the key, the key, the key, the key)

The more I brush it off
Tell myself it's nothing at all
The deeper I fall
And I imagine everyday
A thousand different ways
How you respond to what I say

Am I getting lost in my dreams?
Are you unreachable to me?
'Cause these butterflies just won't go away

But I don't wanna act a fool
Don't wanna look confused
If I let you know about the way I feel
Don't know what you gonna do
So I keep it locked inside
And imagine you were mine
And I'm feeling you so close but yet so far
You hold the key to my heart (my heart)

My, my, my, my, my heart (the key, the key, the key, the key, the key)

But if I never tell you then you'll never know
And the secret is getting heavy to hold
This is more than just a crush
So I may stutter when I speak
And my knees may get a little weak
But I've got nothing to lose and only you to gain
Tell me do you feel the same

But I don't wanna act a fool
Don't wanna look confused
If I let you know about the way I feel
Don't know what you gonna do
So I keep it locked inside
And imagine you were mine
And I'm feeling you so close but yet so far
You hold the key to my heart (my heart)

My, my, my, my, my heart (the key, the key, the key, the key, the key)
You hold the key to my heart
My, my, my, my, my heart (my, my heart)
