		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wear blue velvet in the night
You're already so in love, so am I
But I can feel the tension with you and I
Do I have to be polite?
One little sip of poison, if you like
Baby, I'm the devil in disguise
Let me pull the trigger on your mind
Make you swallow all your pride

I smoke my cigarette with passion
I can tell he's addicted to my fashion
Let him do lines with me in the Hampton's, uh
I'm faithful whoever's asking
Can you keep a secret while we're dancing?
In an art deco million dollar mansion

Oh, don't be dramatic
Just say the word and you'll have it
Oh, don't be dramatic
Leave it alone or be tragic
I'll give you everything that you want
Touch you in the way that you want
Love you in the way that she don't, that she don't
Oh, don't be dramatic
Just say the word and you'll have it

Dirty secrets that I hide
You know I think about ya, by your side
The things I wanna tell ya all the time
Hoping you can read my mind

I know it's criminal to love ya
I know I've got a man but you could be my lover
I fantasize about us playing under covers
Dirty secrets baby, no one can uncover

I smoke my cigarette with passion
I can tell he's addicted to my fashion
Let him do lines with me in the Hampton's, uh
I'm faithful whoever's asking
Can you keep a secret while we're dancing?
In an art deco million dollar mansion

Oh, don't be dramatic
Just say the word and you'll have it (say the word, you'll have it)
Oh, don't be dramatic
Leave it alone or be tragic
I'll give you everything that you want
Touch you in the way that you want
Love you in the way that she don't, that she don't
Oh, don't be dramatic
Just say the word and you'll have it

Don't be dramatic, don't be dramatic
Don't be dramatic, don't be dramatic
Don't be dramatic, don't be dramatic
Don't be dramatic, don't be dramatic
