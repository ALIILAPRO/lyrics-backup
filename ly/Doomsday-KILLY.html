		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So long, farewell, goodbye
Seven days, seven nights, seven lives (seven lives)
I come alive
On dooms, doomsday
Red eye, one way, LA (LA)
Push back trip back, new day (new day)
Face to face with fate
On dooms, doomsday

In the silence, bigger pilot
Life took a turn, perfect timing
She no angel, she a scapegoat
Lay out all my cards on the table
When you want the world they gon' take it
When you want the world, they gon' take it
It's a real cruel world, but pressure makes a pearl

So long, farewell, goodbye
Seven days, seven nights, seven lives (seven lives)
I come alive
On dooms, doomsday
Red eye, one way, LA (LA)
Push back trip back, new day (new day)
Face to face with fate
On dooms, doomsday

Dooms, doomsday, day
On dooms, doomsday
On dooms, doomsday
Any day now, any day now
Any day now, countin' days down
Count count count, down down down
On dooms, doomsday

In the silence, bigger pilot
Life took a turn, perfect timing
She no angel, she a scapegoat
Lay out all my cards on the table
When you want the world they gon' take it
When you want the world, they gon' take it
It's a real cruel world, but pressure makes a pearl

So long, farewell, goodbye
Seven days, seven nights, seven lives (seven lives)
I come alive
On dooms, doomsday
Red eye, one way, LA (LA)
Push back trip back, new day (new day)
Face to face with fate
On dooms, doomsday
