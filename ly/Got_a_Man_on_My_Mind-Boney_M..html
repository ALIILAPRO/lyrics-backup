		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Walk around in circles
Without peace and little sleep
Can't cool down and unwind
What I'm feeling is a feeling
That's just you down deep
Got a man on my mind
Haven't seen him for so long
He's always on the go
Not the sticking round kind
I don't care whatever happens
One thing I do know
Got a man on my mind
Sometimes I stand there
Just starrin' into space
And I talk about how I feel (yeah yeah)
Being there
Yet I clearly see his face
And I hold him and he's quite real
Never thought that I could care
For anyone that much
Oh how wrong can you be
I'm so hungry for his kisses
For his tender touch
He's the whole world for me
Oooh
Walk around in circles
Without peace and without sleep
Can't cool down and unwind
What I'm feeling is a feeling
That's just you down deep
Got a man on my mind
Sometimes I stand there
Just starrin' into space
And I talk about how I feel (oh yeah)
Being there
Yet I clearly see his face
And I hold him and he's quite real
Walk around in circles
Without peace and without sleep
Got a man on my mind
I'm hungry for kisses
I'm thirsty for love
Got a man on my mind
