		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I woke up a little early, to watch a murder
Of crows mobbing down to kill off their old friend
I feel like that old blackbird, buried by my demons
Picked clean to the core, with nothing left to give

I been working every day, watching the clock go
Out my window as the trees bend down
They're heavy with the bleedings of the saddest season
The best fruit's gone, the rest is rotting on the ground

I don't know just what the answer is
But darlin' I can try
To save myself while the world still spins
But there's a murder in the sky

Yeah, I know that it seems crazy, but when it's cold out
I don't see my shadow cause the sun can't seem to shine
And I swear that I can feel 'em, in a big black circle
Waitin' for the day I fall down for the last time

I don't know just what the answer is
But honey I can try
To save myself while the world still spins
But there's a murder in the sky
there's a murder in the sky
