		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Under the raging sun's open fire, fire, fire
Ain't nothin' new, ain't nothin' new
We all have desires
I want you to be my woman, babe
Every time you get dressed in black
You give a grown man a heart attack
I pray that good Lord will bring you back
You're my sunshine

Shoot me down and break my heart
It's the black moon rising (oh)
You brave the sight, I paint the picture
And you wanna do it (oh)
'Cause all she wants to do is cruise to the black moon rising
Right on, right on, baby, yeah, oh
Cruise (oh)

What's going on?
It's the same ol' thing, just a different season
One hundred years and the only time she gets dressed in black
Taking flight baby, count you down
On your way off without a sound
Black moon rising above the clouds
You're my sunshine

Shoot me down and break my heart
It's the black moon rising (oh)
You brave the sight, I paint the picture
Of the black moon rising (oh)
And all she wants to do is cruise
Right on, right on baby
I ain't got nothing to do now
With the black moon rising, cruise (oh)

Shoot me down and break my heart
It's the black moon rising (oh)
You brave the sight, I paint the picture
Of the black moon rising (oh)
And all she wants to do is cruise
Right on, right on baby
Right, right on baby
