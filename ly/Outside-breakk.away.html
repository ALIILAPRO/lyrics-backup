		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You say I'm losing focus and my love is poison
You set my world on fire, and I watch it burn
You remain in my veins 
Love me just to spit me out

Dial tone
It's buried in the deep
Eyes rolled back
Have you fallen for me?
But I've fallen
cnd I'm falling

You say I'm losing focus and my love is poison
You set my world on fire, and I watch it burn
You remain in my veins 
Love me just to spit me out
You say I'm losing focus and my love is poison
You set my world on fire, and I watch it burn
You remain in my veins 
Love me just to spit me out

Medicate me till I sleep 
Medicate me till my body's frozen
I've been swimming in the deep
Watching you break until I'm broken
cll the lies you told me
cll the shit you owe me
Love me, and I'll spit you

Outside, outdoor, out of my mind
Outsourced, ignored, out of my sight
You remain, in my veins
Love me just to spit me out

Medicate me till I sleep 
Medicate me till my body's frozen
I've been swimming in the deep
Watching you break until I'm broken
cll the lies you told me
cll the shit you owe me
Love me, and I'll spit you

Medicate me till I sleep 
Medicate me till my body's frozen
I've been swimming in the deep
Watching you break until I'm broken
You remain, in my veins
Love me just to spit me out

Medicate me till I sleep 
Medicate me till my body's frozen
I've been swimming in the deep
Watching you break until I'm broken
You remain, in my veins
Love me just to spit me out
