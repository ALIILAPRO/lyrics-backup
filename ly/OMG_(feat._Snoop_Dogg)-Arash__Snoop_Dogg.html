		  Oh my god
Oh my god, o-oh my god
Club is packed, I rap the rap
Ladies are in here from front to back
And they love my soul, I reply
Baby girl, don't you know that I am the fire?
Hands in the sky, don't ask why
Party on down with big bow-wow
I got style, got flair, got you right there
I got enough stuff to make you do that dare
So come one, come all, just havin' a ball
Beware of the owner 'cause the owner's a dog
I got y'all back off the wall

Just let me know, know, know
I like the way that you talk
I like the way that you walk
(Crack) crash, boom, bang, you're so beautiful
Wait till we kiss
Give me your lips
(Crack) crash, boom, bang, you're so beautiful
Whoa
Whoa
I'm gonna make you say "oh my god"

Wow, oh my god
Oh my god
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god
Oomph, wow, oh my god
Oh my god
(That make you wanna say) oh my god, oh my god, oh my god
Oomph, wow, oh my god
Oh my god
(That make you wanna say) oh my god
O-oh my god

Baby, baby, wanna be my lady?
Let's take a ride in my blue mercedes
Green grass, sitting on thre beanbag
Close your eyes so the dream lasts
No fadin' away, just blaze the J
Night will turn to amazing day
You and I, I and you
Let's do what lovers do
Do that dance so d-d-do that dance
Do that dance so d-d-do that dance
Do that dance so d-d-do that

Just let me know, know, know
I like the way that you talk
I like the way that you walk
(Crack) crash, boom, bang, you're so beautiful
Wait till we kiss
Give me your lips
(Crack) crash, boom, bang, you're so beautiful
Whoa
(Oh my god) whoa
I'm gonna give you everything you want

Wow, oh my god
Oh my god
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god
Oomph, wow, oh my god
Oh my god
(That make you wanna say) oh my god, oh my god, oh my god
Oomph, wow, oh my god
Oh my god
(That make you wanna say) oh my god
O-oh my god (whoa)
Whoa
Oh my god, o-oh my god
