		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Check, check, check, check
(Yeah)

Set the time for the battleground
Guided missiles will hunt you down
Drones surround your homes
Don't breathe, you're not safe underground
Political landscape shape has been polarized
Now it is time to reveal the zeal
Everybody breathe, get mobilized
Radiation beams out your screens
It's like a poltergeist
Trying to buy the American dream
But it's overpriced
Five bill deal for the fighter jets
Being shipped to the Middle East
It'll cost ten billion more dollars
For neighbors to feels safe to breathe

Breathe with me
Sometimes you got to stop and breathe
Breathe with me
Come breathe with me
Sometimes you got to stop

He pulls on a cigar
He pulls on the strings of his guitar
She pulled on his pants
Bam, he pulled on her bra
Breathe, uh uh
If you believe
Everything under the sun
It was born to be free
The shadow is bound to the tree
And cannot leave with the traveler
The battle is fought on the daily basis
The sturdy man replaced the straggler
As long as there is a breath of life
There's always hope
Defeat the strife
Don't let go that rope

Breathe with me
Sometimes you got to stop and breathe
Breathe with me
Come breathe with me
Sometimes you got to stop and breathe

Come breathe with me
