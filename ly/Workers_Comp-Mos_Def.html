		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ground rules

I'll give you all the diamonds and money
But you can't break my heart
'Cause that'll just get you fired
And everybody needs a job

Work is scarce competition is fierce
Fonzi frontin' in the new leather like they don't care
Word? Let's get you an award for that performance
Winner in the category for the best boring
Tell the tough guys we tougher than tough times
And needles in the nerves to make the tighten up unwind
One time, for locking out the light in your eyes
You're searching for your perfect one
Broken down from getting at all
To take it however it comes
Plain day you the specialist one
Oh me oh my!
I'll give you all the milk and the honey
But you can't break my heart
'Cause that'll just get you fired
Sloppy worker get your pay grade bust

Work is scarce skilled working is rare
Fonzi fronting at the job site
Primping up they hair
Word? Well tell them only staff could drink they coffee
Walking papers hit the office
Sleep late tomorrow morning
Tell the tough guys we're tougher than tough times
And nerves don't snap when the clock touch crunch time
That's right we're tougher than tough times
From been narrow wind
To the clock just unwind
Fa sho' we tougher than tough times
My proof don't need to lie my tighten up don't unwind

Sunshine
Lifting up the light in your eyes
You're gazing at your perfect one
Broken down from never at all
To better than you could ever want
Great day I know that you had to come
Oh me oh my

I'll give you all the diamonds and money
But you can't break my heart
Cause that'll just get you fired
And you're doing such a beautiful job
