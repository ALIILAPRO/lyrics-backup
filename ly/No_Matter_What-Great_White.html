		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No matter what you are
I will always be with you
'Cause no matter what you do, girl
Ooh girl, with you

No matter what you do
I will always be around
Won't you tell me what you found, girl
Ooh girl, want you

Knock down the old, grey wall
Be a part of it all
Nothing to say, nothing to see, nothing to do
If you would give me all

As I would give it to you
Nothing would be, nothing would be, nothing would be
No matter where you go
There would always be a place

Can't you see it in my face, girl
Ooh girl, want you
