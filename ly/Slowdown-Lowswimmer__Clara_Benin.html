		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I begged to go where I can go now
Amongst the drift, within the slowdown
Half alive and half reliving hours
Pass the time thawing out the house

And I stayed to watch you mourn us
In a way I felt without
And that's when I felt the smallest
Whilst I waited to melt it down

The legs were staggered several months out
You left the dagger blunt and somehow
Sank the blade slower over time
Your palisades quickly lost their shine

Getting paid to be your warden
When it was me that wanted out
And I know I'm not important
But it was brave to say aloud

Still, you let me live a second stint
