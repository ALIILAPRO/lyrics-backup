		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Started feelin' like I'm livin' in the upside down
I haven't seen you in forever and I don't know how
And I've been smokin' and stayin' out too late
But you know I've got good intentions, babe
Started feelin' like I see you in the rush hour crowd
Or when I catch you and a stranger in the underground
But something's missing, I got an empty space
And something's different when you leave my place

So I'll try not to say what I mean when I call you up
And I'll try not to think of the distances between us

And it's so good when we dance all night
And I swear that I'd be alright
But it's gettin' harder and harder to reach you
And London is lonely without you
So will you stay?
'Cause I'm oh-so sick of this place
Feelin' way too big
And nothing can hold me, can hold me like you do
London is lonely without you

Any minute now I swear I'm gonna lose my mind
So many people, it's so easy to get lost sometimes
And this winter is going on too long
Though it don't snow here, it stays pretty cold and I miss your warmth

So I'll try not to say what I mean when I call you up
And I'll try not to think of the distances between us

And it's so good when we dance all night
And I swear that I'd be alright
But it's gettin' harder and harder to reach you
And London is lonely without you
So will you stay?
'Cause I'm oh-so sick of this place
Feelin' way too big
And nothing can hold me, can hold me like you do
London is lonely, so lonely

I'm lonely without you
I'm lonely without you
God, I'm lonely without you

And it's so good when we dance all night
And I swear that I'd be alright
But it's gettin' harder and harder to reach you
And London is lonely without you
So will you stay?
'Cause I'm oh-so sick of this place
Feelin' way too big
And nothing can hold me can hold me like you do
London is lonely, so lonely

I'm lonely without you (I'm lonely without you)
I'm lonely without you (so lonely without you)
God, I'm lonely without you (so lonely without you)
London is lonely, so lonely
I'm lonely without you, mm
God, I'm lonely without you
Without you, mm
