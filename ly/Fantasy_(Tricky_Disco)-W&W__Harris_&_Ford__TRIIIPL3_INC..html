		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I fly to the past in my fantasy
Go back to the start, I just have to believe
One beautiful moment I lost in the breeze
I just fly to the past in my fantasy

I fly to the past in my fantasy
Go back to the start, I just have to believe
One beautiful moment I lost in the breeze
I just fly to the past in my fantasy

This is tricky disco

This is tricky disco
Dis-dis-disco
This is tricky disco

I fly to the past in my fantasy
Go back to the start, I just have to believe
One beautiful moment I lost in the breeze
I just fly to the past in my fantasy

This is tricky disco

Tricky disco

I fly to the past in my fantasy
Go back to the start, I just have to believe
One beautiful moment I lost in the breeze
I just fly to the past in my fantasy

I fly to the past in my fantasy
Go back to the start, I just have to believe
One beautiful moment I lost in the breeze
I just fly to the past in my fantasy

This is tricky disco
Dis-dis-disco, this is tricky disco
Dis-dis-disco, this is tricky disco
Dis-dis-disco, this is tricky disco
Dis-dis-disco, tri-tricky-cky dis-disco

Tricky disco

I fly to the past in my fantasy
Go back to the start, I just have to believe
One beautiful moment I lost in the breeze
I just fly to the past in my fantasy

This is tricky disco
