		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'mma pull up on a nigga bitch in my bitch whip
I got twenty chains on me, they gon' chip just like some dip'

Nigga know they get the memo
They get that
Stack them racks, they know the memo
Stackin', stackin'
Nigga stop playin', you know the memo
Yeah look at what she sayin', she know the memo
Yeah she know the memo

Check my swag, check my bag, filled with cash, nigga
Hundred bands in my pants, check the stash, nigga
Yeah she bad, run that back, throw some racks, aye
Break her heart, write your name, like a cast yeah

Price of condo, bale, this not no grass, no
Take it out to Cali, beat that ass, woah
If you cut my jewels, I'mma pull up and shoot
And I, I do my shoppin', at Fairy, no tooth
You just pull up, I'm not fuckin', I'mma still show what it do
Ride around with Ugly Duckling, we just put two somethin' on a Bu (That's a Bugatti)
Man I'm so high I think I just seen a UFO with them troops
Bitches just see us and smile like what it do

I'mma pull up on a nigga bitch in my bitch whip
I got twenty chains on me, they gon' chip just like some dip'

Nigga know they get the memo
Stack them racks, they know the memo
Nigga stop playin', you know the memo
Yeah look at what she sayin', she know the memo
Yeah she know the memo

I don't play on Arthur, but I'm moonwalkin'
I know who gon' catch a body, I know who rockin'
When I die I want a hundred bands inside of my casket
I drink Act, I smoke that gas, I smoke that loud, sirens
Yeah, yeah! I take molly with the YSL, memo, slat!
I supply 'em with them bricks and bales, memo
I'm gettin' money, nigga, can't you tell? (Hell yeah!)
Rollie silver like a handcuff no jail nigga (Memo)
I'm so fresh they want a pic
Pull up on 'em suckers kickin' shit, and with the shits
I thought you were rich but you so broke, I don't know shit
My big brother Bankroll told me I was gonna be the shit

Nigga know they get the memo
Stack them racks, they know the memo
Nigga stop playin', you know the memo
Yeah look at what she sayin', she know the memo
Yeah she know the memo

Check my swag, check my bag, filled with cash, nigga
Hundred bands in my pants, check the stash, nigga
Yeah she bad, run that back, throw some racks, aye
Break her heart, write your name, like a cast yeah
