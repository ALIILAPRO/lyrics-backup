		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I grew up runnin' from the best of me
And I'm still not sure just who I am supposed to be
So hold me again before I fall
Hold tight, hold tight
I hung back in the shadows in periphery
And you took my hand through the bright lights when they blinded me
You kissed me again, you pulled me in close
You smiled, so I smiled

'Cause everything's better
Soon as you're next to me
I know I fall apart
But you fix me with your heart
Everything's better
You're there in the fight with me
And when I fail to start
You fix me with your heart

I grew up tryna hit lightspeed
But I lost my nerve when the big kids kicked it out of me
You save me the sin of getting lost in
My mind, my mind

'Cause everything's better
Soon as you're next to me
I know I fall apart
But you fix me with your heart
Everything's better
You're there in the fight with me
And when I fail to start
You fix me with your heart

Ooh
Ooh
Ooh

You feel this in defeat
You're a dancer in the street
And you looked the deepest darkness in the eye
We missed the last bus home
Found a park bench for a throne
And the stars stayed out tonight
And everything's better, everything's better

Yeah, everything's better
As soon as you're next to me
I know I fall apart
But you fix me with your heart
Everything's better
You're there in the fight with me
And when I fail to start
You fix me with your heart

Ooh
Ooh
I'm better with you
Ooh
Ooh
I'm better with you
