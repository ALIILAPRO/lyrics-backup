		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm finding my heart using my hands
You're my feet on the ground, my footprints
From where I began, I still carry your love
I feel your love

Untie this cord, we don't need it no more
Wherever we are, I'm yours always
It flows in my blood, I still carry your love
I feel your love

We start running, running
To escape this town
We don't know where we're going
'Til we turn round
And I keep on running, running
I don't slow down
And if I'm lost where shadows fall

You light me up when all I see is darkness
You light me up when I'm down
And if I fall apart, you know where to find my pieces
Where they're gonna be found

Keep my eyes shut, safe in this trust
You're all that I need, my senses
Shinning on me, I still carry your love
I feel your love

We start running, running
To escape this town
We don't know where we're going
'Til we turn round
And I keep on running, running
I don't slow down
If I'm lost where shadows fall

You light me up when all I see is darkness
You light me up when I'm down
And if I fall apart, you know where to find my pieces
Where they're gonna be found

You light me up when all I see is darkness
You light me up when I'm down
And if I fall apart, you know where to find my pieces
Where they're gonna be found

I'm finding my heart using my hands
You're my feet on the ground, my footprints
From where I began, I still carry your love
I feel your love

You light me up when all I see is darkness
You light me up when I'm down
And if I fall apart, you know where to find my pieces
Where they're gonna be found

You light me up when all I see is darkness
You light me up when I'm down
And if I fall apart, you know where to find my pieces
Where they're gonna be found

I'm finding my heart using my hands
You're my feet on the ground, my footprints
