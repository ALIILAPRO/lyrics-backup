		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was watching
With one eye on the other side
I had fifteen people telling me to move
I got moving on my mind
I found shelter
In some thoughts turning wheels around
I said thirty nine times that I love you
To the beauty I had found

Well its one, two, three, four
Take the elevator
At the Hotel Yorba
I'll be glad to see you later
All they got inside is vacancy

I've been thinking
Of a little place down by the lake
They got a dirty little road leading up to the house
I wonder how long it will take till we're alone
Sitting on the front porch of that home
Stomping our feet on the wooden boards
Never gonna worry about locking the door

Well its one, two, three, four
Take the elevator
At the Hotel Yorba
I'll be glad to see you later
All they got inside is vacancy

It might sound silly
For me to think childish thoughts like these
But I'm so tired of acting tough
And I'm gonna do what I please
Let's get married
In a big cathedral by a priest
'Cause if I'm the man that you love the most
You can say I do at least

Well its one, two, three, four
Take the elevator
At the Hotel Yorba
I'll be glad to see you later
All they got inside is vacancy

And its four, five, six, seven
Grab your umbrella
Grab hold of me
'Cause I'm your favorite fella
All they got inside is vacancy
