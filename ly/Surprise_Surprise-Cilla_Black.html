		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The more the world is changing
the more it stays the same
Life is full of small surprises
it's a never ending game
If nothing is impossible
will you believe your eyes
If the unexpected brings a smile
that's a big surprise

Surprise, surprise, the unexpected hits you between the eyes
The unpredictable, that's the surprise you see, surprise! surprise!

When you've found a love that's lost it's way
that's a nice surprise
And when you don't know what's in store today
that might bring surprise
It's the greatest feeling in the world
nobody denies

Surprise, surprise, the unexpected hits you between the eyes,
The unpredictable, that's the surprise you see, surprise! surprise!

We don't know what's around the corner
living from day to day
We never know when we'll fall in love
so let it carry you away

Surprise, surprise, the unexpected hits you between the eyes,
The unpredictable, that's the surprise you see, surprise! surprise!

Surprise, surprise
it's the greatest feeling nobody denies
It's laughter, love and joy in disguise
The unpredictable, that's the surprise you see
surprise! surprise!

Surprise, surprise, the unexpected hits you between the eyes,
It's laughter, love and joy in disguise
And all the wealth can't bring us what it buys
