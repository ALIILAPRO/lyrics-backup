		  Ah, Ah, Ah, x4



I don’t wanna call you

I just wanna know how you are

Mmm

Is it stupid that I miss you?

Even after all of these scars

Mmm



Met you on a Sunday

Broke my heart on Monday

Now its been a month and

I don’t think I’m ok

I cant go a whole day

Without you on my brain

How am I still hung up?

Crazy how a life can change in 24 hours 

Hey

You just took a look at me and took all of my power

Hey

I fell for you all the way to rockbottom

Wish you would keep all of the memories ‘cause

I don’t want ‘em

We were dancing in the kitchen now I’m crying in the shower

Its crazy how my life can change in 24 hours



Staring at the clock and 

Wishing I could just fall asleep

Oh

I know that your not ya

You’re never ever thinking of me

Hey



Im alright on Tuesday

Lose my mind on Wednesday

It feels like a year now

Since I was ok

I cant go a whole day

Without you on my brain

Will I ever make it out?



Crazy how a life can change in 24 hours 

Hey

You just took a look at me and took all of my power

Hey

I fell for you all the way to rockbottom

Wish you would keep all of the memories ‘cause

I don’t want ‘em

We were dancing in the kitchen now I’m crying in the shower

Its crazy how my life can change in 24 hours



Ah, Ah, Ah, x4



Met you on a Sunday

Broke my heart on Monday

Now its been a month and

I don’t think I’m ok

I cant go a whole day

Without you on my brain

How am I still hung up?



Crazy how a life can change in 24 hours 

Hey

You just took a look at me and took all of my power

Hey

I fell for you all the way to rockbottom

Wish you would keep all of the memories ‘cause

I don’t want ‘em

We were dancing in the kitchen now I’m crying in the shower

Its crazy how my life can change in 24 hours



Ah, Ah, Ah, x4
