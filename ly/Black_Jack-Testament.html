		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Life, dismantle your life piece by piece
Winning the hand while still losing the bet
Even with an Ace up your sleeve

Rolling, snake eyes are poison to me
Gamble your life with a toss of the dice
The rush is all that I need

Stakes are high, and so am I
You bet your life on the line
No lady luck on my side
It's heads you win and tails you lose

It's heads you win in the city of sin

Life, spinning your life on the wheel
The joker is wild with a black grin he smiles
The gamble is still worth the risk

Stakes are high, and so am I
You bet your life on the line
No lady luck on my side
It's heads you win and tails you lose

Aces high, and so am I
They're watching you from the eye
I got the Aces so I double down
Where's lady luck, she ain't around

Life, a gambler's life haunting me
Seven eleven, I still cannot win
Snake eyes just won't me be

Stakes are high, and so am I
You bet your life on the line
No lady luck on my side
It's heads you win and tails you lose

Aces high, and so am I
They're watching you from the eye
I got the Aces so I double down
Where's lady luck, she ain't around

It's heads you win in the city of sin
