		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Broken down, on my knees
Only sound, ears that ring
The silence is so loud
I scream into the void
So hold my hand, walk into oblivion
Go to the cocoon, transformation

The pain emporium
Stripped down and bleeding
Broken of everything but pride
These mental scars I try to hide
My head held in my hands

Scars of sanctity, hatred's purity
Loss of my equilibrium
My soul is turning to ash
This faithless sanitarium

So wave goodbye, save a prayer
Don't you cry, don't be scared
For I have thrived with no fear
Let me die, I'll be there

Slaughter the martyr
Slaughter the martyr

Dawn of the desolate
Prayers to pestilence
Deeper I fall in this descent to madness
Nightfall my nemesis, dreams drip with violence
Orgies of murder, vicious acts so senseless

Piece by piece the kingdom shatters, reality in tatters
The curse of chaos slowly consumes
Bruised, scarred and abused
Suffer my vengeance, paint the world in crimson hues
Paint the world in crimson hues

Time won't heal, this hate I feel
Can't close my eyes, nightmares that terrorize

I lay paralyzed in homicidal rage
The anger driving me insane

Slaughter the martyr

Brutal and barbarous, murder so merciless
This blood will quench the thirst for retribution
Heartless, this homicide
Justice so justified
Never last rites, there's only execution

Limb from limb, I tear his body
And leave the carcass rotting
The stench of death is all that atones
Stone, I stand alone
Upon the piles of my enemies' broken bones
Of my enemies' broken bones

Time won't heal, this hate I feel
Can't close my eyes, nightmares that terrorize

I lay paralyzed in homicidal rage
The anger driving me insane
I lay paralyzed in homicidal rage
The anger driving me insane

Heartbreak, the cross I bare
Endless sorrow fills the blackened air
These pyres where love has died
A fire smothered, emptiness inside
Angel adorned, halo of bullet shells
Into the darkest depths, I cast them to rot in hell
The executioner, no judge, no trial
Killing the killers that perpetuate this act so vile

I lay paralyzed in homicidal rage (homicidal rage)
The anger driving me insane
I lay paralyzed in homicidal rage (homicidal rage)
The anger driving me insane, sane

So wave goodbye, save a prayer
Don't you cry, don't be scared
For I have thrived with no fear
Let me die, I'll be there
