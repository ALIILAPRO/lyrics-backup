		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Could have been my happy ever after
Living like we're in a fairy tale
But you and me were more like a disaster
I should have known
Intoxicated by your reputation
I can see the mischief in your eyes
Trusted you despite my reservations
Now I'm alone

I was so rich with all this love
You wanted it and I was so dumb
I let you in when I should have run
Now all that's left is something numb

I gave you all I had to lose
My skin, my soul, my finest jewels
You stole it all for someone new and then
You gave away the best of me
My sins, my sweetest ecstasy
To someone worth much less than me
Yeah, you're my Robin Hood

Everybody says that you're so great, yeah
Walk around like you deserve that gold
But what would happen if they
Knew the place that you got it from?
I guess that I was just another victim
Someone that you thought that you could play
I had a feeling and I should have listened
Now there's no us

I was so rich with all this love
You wanted it and I was so dumb
I let you in when I should have run
Now all that's left is something numb

I gave you all I had to lose
My skin, my soul, my finest jewels
You stole it all for someone new and then
You gave away the best of me
My sins, my sweetest ecstasy
To someone worth much less than me
Yeah, you're my Robin Hood

So alone, so alone so alone, so alone

I gave you all I had to lose
My skin, my soul, my finest jewels
You stole it all for someone new and then
You gave away the best of me
My sins, my sweetest ecstasy
To someone worth much less than me
Yeah, you're my Robin Hood
