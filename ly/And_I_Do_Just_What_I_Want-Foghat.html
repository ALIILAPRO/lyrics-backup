		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Live while you're livin', 'cause you know what they said,
Don't matter how long you live, you're a long time dead.
I said no use to worry, no use to fret,
I'd like a million dollars but I ain't gonna bet.
I'm alright tonight, and I'll do just what I want.
Tell everybody in the neighborhood,
That I want to party, want to party good.
And I don't care what the people don't allow,
I'm gonna have a good time any old how.
I'm alright tonight, and I do just what I want. Oww!
{Erik - Solo}
Whoo!
Live while you're livin', 'cause you know what they said,
Don't matter how long you live, you're a long time dead.
I said no use to worry, no use to fret,
I'd like a million dollars but I ain't gonna get.
I'm alright tonight, and I do just what I want ....
{Dave - Solo}
When I hold you in my arms,
Love can't do no wrong,
And when I hold you tight,
Love gonna do me right.
(Tell everybody in the neighborhood!)
(I want to party, want to party good!)
And I don't care what the people don't allow,
I'm gonna have a good time any old how.
I'm alright tonight, and I do just what I want.
I'm alright tonight, and I do just what I want.
I'm alroit tonoit, and I do just what I want.
