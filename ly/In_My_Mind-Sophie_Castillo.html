		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dame un beso que me quiero sentir
Viva

Waiting for too long
Can anybody help me
Changing what's all been done
Can anybody help me

I don't see why
I can't change my life
Is it too late
Can I try try try?

Please don't change my mind
I just wanted to find
Something new in my mind
So I, can try to change my life

Please don't change my mind
I just wanted to find
Something new in my mind
So I, can try to change my life

Change my life

Asking for help from my love
So maybe he can save me
Searching for peace in your touch
Can anybody trace these lines in my mind
Leading back, what will you find so deep inside
I can't hide from my pride
And the teardrops that shape me

Please don't change my mind
I just wanted to find
Something new in my mind
So I, can try to change my life

Please don't change my mind
I just wanted to find
Something new in my mind
So I, can try to change my

Asking for love in all the wrong places
Looking for touch in all the wrong faces
How can I, even try
To find what I'm looking for deep in a lie

Asking for touch in all the wrong places
Looking for someone in all the wrong faces
How can I, even try
To find what I'm looking for deep in a lie

Please don't change my mind
I just wanted to find
Something new in my mind
So I, can try to change my life

Please don't change my mind
I just wanted to find
Something new in my mind
So I, can try to change my life
