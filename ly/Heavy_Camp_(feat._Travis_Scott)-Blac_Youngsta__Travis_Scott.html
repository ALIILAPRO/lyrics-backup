		  Ah-ah, ah
Yeah
Ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah

Yeah, (whoa) drop a six, make me drip (it's lit)
Whoa, for my dawg, hit a lick (straight up)
Whoa, Heavy Camp with the clique (alright)
Whoa
Uh, uh, uh, Juvenile off the mix (yah)
Ayy, break it down, make it dip (yeah-eah)
Ayy, off top, off the rip (yeah-eah)
Ayy (ooh)

I won't forget how they shitted on me (ooh)
How they quitted on me (ayy, ah-ah, ooh)
Uh, uh, uh
All these hundreds on me
I be runnin' to that money, nothin' but gunnas 'round me
I be runnin' with them gunnas (straight up, it's lit)
Fuck it up, bitch called my phone trippin', I hung up
I'ma fight this bitch if he run up
Everybody 'round me gettin' some money
I'll slide out for my dawgs, and I'm sellin' dope 'til the sun up

And I'm glad I found you
I'm glad I found you
I'm glad I found you
Glad I found you
Glad I found you
Glad I found you

Yeah (ayy), drop a six, make me drip (it's lit)
Whoa, for my dawg, hit a lick (straight up)
Whoa, Heavy Camp with the clique (alright)
Whoa
Uh, uh, uh, Juvenile off the mix (yah)
Ayy, break it down, make it dip (yeah-eah)
Ayy, off top, off the rip (yeah-eah)
Ayy (ooh)

Wrist, Patek, Breitling on the set
I eat, you eat, told my nigga we gon' eat
I ain't gotta stand in front of grandma's house
And sell dope 'cross the street no more
Shout out everybody ever hated on me
Or they turned their back on me before
Fire shots, I'ma fire back (uh)
Lie to me, I'ma lie back (uh)
Two wrongs don't make a right
I don't give a fuck about that
Uh, uh, uh, uh
They mad 'cause I'm rich (uh, uh)
I might go and fuck my hater's bitch
Whole lot of ice on my wrist (yeah)
For my dawg, I'll hit a lick

And I'm glad I found you
I'm glad I found you
I'm glad I found you
Glad I found you
Glad I found you
Glad I found you

Yeah (ayy), drop a six, make me drip (it's lit)
Whoa, for my dawg, hit a lick (straight up)
Whoa, Heavy Camp with the clique (alright)
Whoa
Uh, uh, uh, Juvenile off the mix (yah)
Ayy, break it down, make it dip (yeah-eah)
Ayy, off top, off the rip (yeah-eah)
Ayy

Ah-ah, ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ooh
I won't forget how they shitted on me (straight up)
How they quitted on me (straight up)
Ah, ooh
