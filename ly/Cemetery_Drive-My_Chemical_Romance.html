		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This night
Walk the dead
In a solitary style and crash the cemetery gates
In the dress your husband hates
Lay down
Mark the grave
Where the searchlights find us drinking by the mausoleum door
And they found you on the bathroom floor

I miss you
I miss you so far
And the collision of your kiss that made it so hard

Back home off the run
Singing songs that make you slit your wrists
It isn't that much fun
Staring down a loaded gun
So I won't stop dying
Won't stop lying
If you want I'll keep on crying
Did you get what you deserve?
Is this what you always want me for?

I miss you
I miss you so far
And the collision of your kiss that made it so hard

Way Down, way down, way down, way down
Way down, way down, way down, way down

I miss you
I miss you so far
And the collision of your kiss that made it so hard 

I miss you
I miss you so far
And the collision of your kiss that made it so hard, made it so hard

Way down, way down, way down, way down
Way down, way down, way down, way down, way down
