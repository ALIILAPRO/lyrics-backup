		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Is she ready to know my frustration? 
What she slippin' inside, slow castration 
I'm a riddle so strong, you can't break me 
Did she come here to try, try to take me 

Did she call my name? 
I think it's gonna rain 
Oh, when I die 

Was it something I said, held against me? 
Ain't no life on the run, slowly climbing 
Caught in ice so she stares, stares at nothing 
I can help her but won't, now she hates me 

Did she call my name? 
I think it's gonna rain 
Oh, when I die 

She won't let me hide
She don't want me to cry 

Yeah

Will she keep on the ground, trying to ground me 
Slowly forgive my lie, lying to save me 
Could she love me again, or will she hate me 
Probably not, I know why, can't explain me 
Did she call my name? 
I think it's gonna rain 
Oh, when I die
