		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And now, the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain

I've lived a life that's full
I traveled each and every highway
And more, much more than this
I did it my, my, my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
And more, much more than this
I did it my, my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

And now, the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain

I've lived a life that's wow
I traveled each along the highway
And more, much more than this
I did it my, my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, and soaking rain
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way
