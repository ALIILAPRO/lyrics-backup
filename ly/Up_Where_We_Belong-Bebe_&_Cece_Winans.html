		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Who knows what tomorrow brings
In a world, few hearts survive
All I know is the way I feel
When it's real, I keep it alive
The road is long, there are mountains in your way But we climb a step every day

Love lift us up where we belong, where the eagles cry
On a mountain high
Love lift us up where we belong, far from the world
We know, up where the clear wind blow

Some hang on to used to be
Live their lives, looking behind

All we have is here and now
All our life, out there to find

The road is long, there are mountains in our way,
But we climb them a step ev'ry day
Love lift us up where we belong, where the eagles cry
On a mountain high

Love lift us up where we belong, far from the world
We know, up where the clear winds blow

Time goes by, no time to cry, life's you and I
A live today

Love lift us up where we belong, where the eagles cry
On a mountain high
Love lift us up where we belong, far from the world
We know, where the clear winds blow
