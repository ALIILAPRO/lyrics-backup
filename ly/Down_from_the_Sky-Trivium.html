		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A chasm grows
With the cavity of serpentine teeth
(Serpentine teeth)

Hunger pains strike
For the sweet feast of innocent blood
Of innocent bloodshed

Now here we go

The vampires feed on the wars of mankind
The vampires feed on the wars of mankind

Growing fat on the throne of an empire
Tyrant rules with the threat of a great fire

I've opened up my eyes
Seen the world for what it's worth
Tears rain down from the sky

They'll blow it all to bits
To prove whose god wields all the power
Fire rains down from the sky

The gaping wounds
Hemorrhaging the blood from which they feast
(Blood from which they feast)

Eat us alive
Consume to feed a hunger with no
A hunger with no end
Let's fucking go

The vampires feed on the wars of mankind
The vampires feed on the wars of mankind

Growing fat on the throne of an empire
Tyrant rules with the threat of a great fire

I've opened up my eyes
Seen the world for what it's worth
Tears rain down from the sky

They'll blow it all to bits
To prove whose god wields all the power
Fire rains down from the sky

This battle's not the same
Which they have led us to believe

A synthesis of propaganda
Terror and deceit

We are the cattle
They the slaughter
Our meat, gasoline

They pump us through the machine's valves
To cleanse the world's "disease"
We are the ammunition
That will cause all life to cease

Annihilate
All those who stand in their way
Obliterate
They'll rain their holocaust
Down from the sky

The vampires feed on the wars of mankind
The vampires feed on the wars of mankind

Growing fat on the throne of an empire
Tyrant rules with the threat of a great fire

I've opened up my eyes
Seen the world for what it's worth
Tears rain down from the sky

They'll blow it all to bits
To prove whose god wields all the power
Fire rains down from the sky

Annihilate

All those who stand in their way
Obliterate
They'll rain their holocaust
Down from the sky
