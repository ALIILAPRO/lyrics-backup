		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Who got stuck with the check?
Who got left at the aisle
Did they say they burned Capitol Station down?
And then I heard Jennifer died in Rome

They'll come looking for answers
They might start asking you why
Anyway, I don't need you to do me favors
but I sure need you
I sure need you to lie

Let's get it together right now
Let's get it together somehow

Can we get it together right now?
Can we get it together somehow?

Whatever happened to Rico?
You heard what happened to Sly?
Anyway, they all call him Michelle now and he had a new baby
A little girl Gemini
You got blood on your money
You got some mud in your eye
Anyway, so tell Mara I miss that thing we had

And tell Tara I'm sorry I never tried-

To keep it together right now
Just keep it together somehow

Help me keep it together right now
Can we keep it together somehow?

You know if I come around this way again
It's gonna be a surprise
She's putting lipstick on homeless boys in Korea town
Driving Angel down right now, right now

Let's get it together right now
Let's get it together somehow

Can we get it together right now?
Can we get it together right now?
