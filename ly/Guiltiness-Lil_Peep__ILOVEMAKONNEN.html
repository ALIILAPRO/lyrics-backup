		  Is it them or me? Tell me what's it gon' be
Is it them or me? Tell me what's it gon' be
Is it them or me? Is it him or her?
Tell me where you gon' be
(Moneyposse)

Your guiltiness is weighing heavy
'Cause second best for your love, no, I can't be
I'm not impressed, so you can stop it
I wanna be the best for you and me
So can you put me on

If we give it up now (you'll see you were everything to me)
If I give it up now (they'll say you lost everything today)
If we don't live it up now (no pain, you were always in my way)
So I give it up now (let's pray that we see another day)

Can you put me online? (Yeah)
I been waiting a long time
Won't you talk to me, honey? (Talk to me, honey)
Connect me to your site
I'll be on you all night (yeah)
Can you tell me what's new? (Tell me what's new)
Can you put me online?
I been waiting a long time
Won't you talk to me, honey? (Talk to me, honey)
Connect me to your site
I'll be on you all night (all night)
Can you tell me what's new? (Tell me what's new)

Your guiltiness (guiltiness)
Is weighing heavy, though (weighing heavy)
Second best for your love, no (no), I can't be (I can't be)
I'm not impressed (I'm not impressed)
So you can stop it (you can stop it)
I'll try to give the best for you and me (you and me)
Can you put me online?
I been waiting a long time (long time)
Won't you talk to me, honey? (Talk to me, honey)
Connect me to your site
I'll be on you all night (all night)
Can you tell me what's new? (Tell me what's new)

If we give it up now (you'll see you were everything to me)
If I give it up now (they'll say you lost everything today)
If we don't live it up now (no pain, you were always in my way)
So I give it up now (let's pray that we see another day)

So tell me what's it gon' be?
Guiltiness is weighing heavy
Second best for your love, no, I can't be
I'm not impressed, so you can stop it
I'll give the best for you and me
Can you put me online?
Waiting a long time
Won't you true talk to me, honey?
Connect me to your site
I'll be on you all night
Can you tell me what's new?
(New, new, run it back)
