		  (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Wayne's World, yeah
Let me bring you up to speed
It's Wayne's World

Party time excellent, I party hard
I pull up in the Bugatti on God
Tony Montana said, "This world is yours"
I just said, "Sure, it's Wayne's World"
Party time excellent, I party hard
I party hard even when times is hard
I just go hard, party time, excellent
Pull up on your street and that shit was Sesame

I'm with my Mexican, gang-bangin' heavily (huh)
Throw up your set at me, that I don't recommend (hoo)
I pull up in the Bugatti, we not gon' bother
And in the trunk, we got the elephant 
Know who you F'in' with, they don't know where you went
Then they won't find you until you are skeleton
They bite piranhas and stung by the jellyfish
These ain't no All-Stars, bitch, these is Vetements
Party time excellent, pardon my excellence
Pardon my necklace, pardon my neck and wrist
Pardon my neckin' bitch, all of my medicine
All I be askin' is, "where the Promethazine?"
'Cause, pipe the fuck up (yeah)
Yeah, don't make me hit you with that bow
Help, I've fallen, I can't get up
I live in dark, get rich or die tryin'
Like 50 Cent, minute man
Wish death 'pon me, better wish again
Don't shoot at Maaly G, he ain't listenin'
Pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop, I tried to show him
I pull up in a Bugatti, for real
I pull up on the Ducati, one wheel
Then I take off on the private, the Lear
Up to the clouds until I disappear
Ain't where I live, it's about how I live
I'm outta here, me and my mama mia
I'm in that pussy, ass, and fuckin'
She shout in my ear, "it's Wayne's World"

Party time excellent, I party hard
I pull up in the Bugatti on God
Tony Montana said, "this world is yours"
And I'ma make sure it's Wayne's World
Party time excellent, I party hard
I pull up in the Bugatti on God
Tony Montana said, "this world is yours"
I said, "of course, it's Wayne's World

Party time, excellent
Call the slime, let's get lit
Party time, excellent
Totally Wayne's World
Party time excellent, I party hard
Tony Montana said, "this world is yours"
I wanted more (it's Wayne's World)

Party time excellent, I party hard
I party hard even when times is hard
I just go hard, ain't no tomorrow
Party time excellent, harder than yesterday
I gotta medicate so I can resonate
That made me featherweight, so I can levitate
Into a better place, I don't care where you stay
Better they better, but that's how you better stay, wait
Who's that peekin' in my window, pow, nobody now
Two, no buss downs, one bling-bling, one bling-blaow
Just fucked my ex, don't know why, don't know how
Play with that ex box all night like a child
Oh me, oh wow, baby, show me around
I said, "Show me your world," I said, "Now show me out"
Yeah, laid on the bitch, I skate on the bitch
I wave on to that bitch, I gave her a kiss
Can't get in my world, but I gave her the dick
Yeah, Wayne's World

I pull up in the Bugatti on God
Party time excellent, I party hard
Tony Montana said, "this world is yours"
And I'ma make sure it's Wayne's World
Party time excellent, I party hard
I pull up in the Bugatti on God
Tony Montana said, "This world is yours"
And I said, "Of course, it's Wayne's World

Party time, excellent
Call the slime, let's get lit
Party time, excellent
Totally (it's Wayne's World)
Party time excellent, I party hard
Tony Montana said, "this world is yours"
I wanted more (it's Wayne's World)

Party time, excellent
Call the slime, let's get lit
Party time, excellent
Totally (Wayne's World)
Party time excellent, I party hard
I party hard even when times is hard
I just go hard, ain't no tomorrow
This world is yours, it's Wayne's World

Party time excellent, I party hard
Tony Montana said, "this world is yours"
I wanted more (Wayne's World)
Party time, excellent
Call the slime, let's get lit
Party time, excellent
Totally (it's Wayne's World)

(Wayne's World)
(And we're out)
