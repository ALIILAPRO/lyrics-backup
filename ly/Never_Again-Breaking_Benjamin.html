		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Carry me under, leave me abandoned
Show me what's left, show me what's left
Beautiful anger, breaking the pattern
Show me what's left, show me what's left

Take the color from your eyes
I bleed for you, I bleed for you
Bring the broken back to life
We'll make it through, we'll make it through

Empty and perfect, shattered and worthless
Show me what's left, show me what's left
Dragging me further, forget to remember
Show me what's left, show me what's left

Take the color from your eyes
I bleed for you, I bleed for you
Bring the broken back to life
We'll make it through, we'll make it through

Never again, never again
Time will not take the life from me
Never again, never again
Time will not take the life from me

And after this world is out of reach
Sober and silent, faded and violent
Hopeless, I fight to fall between
Never surrender, out of the embers
Save a space inside for me

Take the color from your eyes
I bleed for you, I bleed for you
Bring the broken back to life
We'll make it through, we'll make it through

Never again, never again
Time will not take the life from me
Never again, never again
Time will not take the life from me
