		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Why, I'm, late to see 
You burn my time like gasoline 
Now, it's, clear to me 
In all honesty 

I don't wanna wait till 5 AM
Staying way too late with all your friends 
Losing my mind 
This never-ending gossipin'
Till 5 AM

Why, I'm, late to see 
All this drama blah blah blah blah 
Don't mean shit to me 
You, ain't, here for me 
In all honesty 

I don't wanna wait till 5 AM
Staying way too late with all your friends 
Losing my mind 
This never-ending gossipin'
Till 5 AM

Cut the shit stop the act 
Being all that you asked 
Doing this doing that 
And still 
And I know what you need 
Need an image of me 
Being all I could be 
For you

Pawl and Discrete, yeah
I know you like to talk about me babe (Let her talk)
5 AM you gossip I'm always trending top babe (aah-ah)
I bet you never talk about how I give you extra chores (you don't do that)
Why you got to be so cruel (you wouldn't do that)
Don't get that pussy wait it's mine babe (it's mine)
If only I gave you time babe (time)
You're supposed to be my best friend (yeah yeah)
My sun babe (my sun)
So why you got a friend
So don't say let's we go hit all the stores 
If that's what you want (that what you want)
It feels we are no more

Till 5 am
