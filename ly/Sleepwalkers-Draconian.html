		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We're sleepwalking
Piercing, hateful eyes are watching
We're sleepwalking
The hungry ghosts are never patient

Look at Me
Oh, wretched Creator
This is what I've become

Come into the fray
For everything we've become
in this cell we call home
Lost in this iron-clad song

We're sleepwalking
backwards to where it all began
Our minds are locked
where black stars hang

Look at Me
Oh, paralyzed savior
and the darkening of souls

Come into the fray
For everything we've become
in this cell we call home
Lost in this iron-clad song
We came into the light
to surrender our hearts
as we cry for salvation

Hopeless, unaware
I'm gone and I'm sleepwalking
Nothing but rattling chains
I'm naked and I'm sleepwalking

Look at You
An accuser made God
How far you have fallen

Come into the fray
For everything we've become
in this cell we call home
Lost in this iron-clad song

We came to the dark
to remember our hearts
as we fight for salvation
