		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Keep me away from what’s left
Of all the softness you had
I’m a knife always searching for that one tender place 
I’m a violent paper doll you always misplace
In the shadow of your terrifying grace
Laying awake until morning
Counting the cracks in the wall
I’m an empty kaleidoscope, dizzy and grey
I’m a light in your telescope, spinning in place 
I’d burn alive just for the soft light on your face
All my days I wait for something more
You touch me like you’re learning how to lose me
Locking the doors from inside
We learned all our sadness from watching tv
All the flowers are digital on the cemetery screen
I ran every red light just to see 
If your grave still had room for me
All my days I wait for something more
I love you like I love being hungry
It feels good to want things
I’ll go empty and fall til I run out of rope
I swallowed my fear in the letters I wrote
Saying I’ll sleep in your clothes til you come home
