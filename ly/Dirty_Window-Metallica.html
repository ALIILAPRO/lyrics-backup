		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I see my reflection in the window
It looks different, so different than what you see
Projecting judgment on the world
This house is clean, baby
This house is clean

Am I who I think I am?
Am I who I think I am?
Am I who I think I am?
Look out my window and see it's gone wrong
Court is in session and I slam my gavel down

I'm judge and I'm jury and I'm executioner too
I'm judge and I'm jury and I'm executioner too

Projector
Protector
Rejector
Infector
Projector
Rejector
Infector, injector
Defector, rejector

I see my reflection in the window
This window clean inside, dirty on the out
I'm looking different than me
This house is clean, baby
This house is clean

Am I who I think I am?
Am I who I think I am?
Am I who I think I am?
I look out my window and see it's gone wrong
My court is in session and now I slam my gavel down

I'm judge and I'm jury and I'm executioner too
I'm judge and I'm jury and I'm executioner too

Projector
Protector
Rejector
Infector
Projector
Rejector
Infector, injector
Defector, rejector
Dejector

I, I, I, I

I'm judge and I'm jury and I'm executioner too
I'm judge and I'm jury and I'm executioner too

Projector
Protector
Rejector
Infector
Projector
Rejector
Infector, injector
Defector, rejector

I, I, I, I
I drink from the cup of denial
I'm judging the world from my throne
I drink from the cup of denial
I'm judging the world from my throne, yeah
