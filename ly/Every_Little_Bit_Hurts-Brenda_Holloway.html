		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I have wished for the wealth
Of a great millionaire
I have reached for a bright star above
But the thrill of it all
To me seems so small
When compared to the thrill of your love

I'd rather give (I'd rather give) everything (Give everything)
That I own (that I own) in this world (Own this world)
Than to be all alone and unloved
For no earthly price and no sacrifice
Is too much to give
For your love

I'd rather give (I'd rather give) everything (Give everything)
That I own (that I own) in this world (Own this world)
Than to be all alone and unloved
For no earthly price and no sacrifice
Is too much to give
For your love
