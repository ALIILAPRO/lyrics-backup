		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The power of love is here now
The power of now is here now
The power of you and me is here
To create magic on earth

The power of love is here now
The power of now is here now
The power of you and me is here
To create magic on earth

(The power of love is here now
The power of now is herе now
The power of you and me is hеre
To create magic on earth)
Let the water wash away your tears
Let the fire burn away your fears
Let the wind blow into your
Life such faith and trust
Let the earth hold you
Take care of you and nurture you

The power of love is here now
The power of now is here now
The power of you and me is here
To create magic on earth

The power of love is here now
The power of now is here now
The power of you and me is here
To create magic on earth

(The power of love is here now
The power of now is here now
The power of you and me is here
To create magic on earth)

Let the water wash away your tears
Let the fire burn away your fears
Let the wind blow into your
Life such faith and trust
Let the earth hold you
Take care of you and nurture you
