		  Plàsi - Sorrow

There's a sorrow, but I don't know why
There's a sorrow, under your blue sky
There's a sorrow, in the corners of your mind
That I can't find

There's a sorrow, and it all came by
On that false evening, the 7th of July
There's a sorrow, and I, don't know how I could try
There's a sorrow, and I, don't think you will survive 

There's a sorrow in the back of this parade
There's a sorrow, and it doesn't seem to fade
There's a sorrow, and I, don't know how I could try
There's a sorrow, and I, don't think you will survive

There's a sorrow, but I don't know why
There's a sorrow, under your blue sky
There's a sorrow, in the corners of your mind
That I can't find
