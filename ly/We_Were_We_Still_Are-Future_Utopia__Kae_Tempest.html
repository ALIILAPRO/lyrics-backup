		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Heads down, swallow the screen and feel images
Imprint themselves. Big world, little villagers.
Living the dream, dreaming of waking
Who isn't afraid of things changing?
 
And when it comes down to the day out, the day in
The same thing, the blood rush, head racing
Pacing the floors of the precinct, waiting for more
But no way to believe in the cause
Cos the cause fell asleep in the doorway
Raw as a portrait etched on your forehead that says
Life's not a test, life's a forfeit, pause it
Catch your breath, feeling nauseous
 
Re-route the circuit
Uproot the booged down
Change is afoot, and the circus is in town
Can't hold it down anymore, it's happening
That's why it feels like it's all unravelling
That's why it feels like it's all unravelling
 
There was, there still is
We were, we will be
 
Hello disorientation my old friend
Welcome to the days of distortion 
Complex parades of illusion, charades, on course for destruction
Yawn for the horseman
An end is an end until it's a beginning. 
Winning
We built this city on what we stole, and then it ate us whole
 
We built this city on what we stole
 
What if everything was to arrive at the moment when everything is
Blown apart by the pressure of a lonely heart
We took a false start as our only chance
Well, history's perpetual dance is resilience - 
Heads down, swallow the screen and no sympathies
Love doesn't end when it finishes
Love doesn't end when it finishes
 
There was, there still is
We were, we will be
We were, we still are
You are, you will be
