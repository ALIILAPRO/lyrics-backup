		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Eyes the colour of algae growing on a park bench
I really wanna be friends
I really kiss you

The things you say sticking around like your cigarette stench
I don't wanna see the end
I don't wanna miss you

'Cause you walked in here with a little smile
didn't know what you were doing
And all of a sudden I'd walk a mile
Just to see how well you're doing

My vanilla soul and your darkened eyes
Dancing slow in the middle of the night
It's all I want and more
My fella's bold, hardened and wise
I'm a little girl, little miss sunshine
It's all I want and more

I see the signs putting my heart in my sleeve when I'm getting dressed
I don't wanna second guess
I'm tired of the maybes
And in the night you're looking around like you wanna confess
But even if you were a mess
I'm here for you baby

'Cause you walked in here with a little smile
Didn't know what you were doing
And all of a sudden I'd walk a mile
Just to see how well you're doing

My vanilla soul and your darkened eyes
Dancing slow in the middle of the night
It's all I want and more
My fella's bold, hardened and wise
I'm a little girl, little miss sunshine
It's all I want and more

'Cause you walked in here with a little smile
(Didn't know what you were doing)
And all of a sudden I'd walk a mile
(Just to see how well you're doing)
