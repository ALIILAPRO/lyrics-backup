		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby, when I see you up close
The wonders of the world don't come close
You're from another planet and I want you, I want to
Try to ride around every curve
I'm flippin' every stone left unturned
I think you understand what's on my mind

The way you hit me with those eyes
I can't escape it
Time, we can take it
Love, we can make it all night

Take me everywhere, I swear I have the patience
I wanna trace my hands 'cross the your freckle constellations
Let me let your lips be my destination, oh
I wanna hide in the covers, discover your body slow

'Til there's nowhere left to go
To go
Whoa
Whoa

Oh my God, it's happenin' again
I feel myself fallin' back in
Gravity's got me holdin' tightly, I might be
In a little over my head
In a little deep in this bed
I think you understand what's on my mind

The way you hit me with those eyes
I can't escape it
Time, we can take it
Love, we can make it all night

Take me everywhere, I swear I have the patience
I wanna trace my hands 'cross the your freckle constellations
Let me let your lips be my destination, oh
I wanna hide in the covers, discover your body slow

'Til there's nowhere left to go
To go
Whoa
Whoa

Take me to your mountain high
Your river, your valley wide
Take me where nobody's been before

And take me everywhere, I swear I have the patience
I wanna trace my hands 'cross the your freckle constellations
Let me let your lips be my destination, oh
I wanna hide in the covers, discover your body slow
I wanna follow your fingers forever and ever, oh

'Til there's nowhere left to go
To go
Whoa
Whoa
'Til there's nowhere left to go
To go
Whoa
Whoa
'Til there's nowhere left to go
