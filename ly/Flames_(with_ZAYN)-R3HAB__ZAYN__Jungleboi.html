		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, well, you better run from me
You better hit the road
You better up and leave
Don't get too close
'Cause I'm a rolling stone
And I keep rolling on
You better run from me
Before I take your soul

If I go, let me go
Don't you follow me, let me go
I will let you down, let me go
Even if your heart can't take it light me up in flames
Light me up in

Light me up, oh
Light me up, oh
Light me up, oh

You better run from me
You better say goodbye
And even if I plead
Don't waste your time
'Cause I'm a broken home
You're better off alone
You better run from me
Before I take your soul

If I go, let me go
Don't you follow me, let me go
I will let you down, let me go
Even if your heart can't take it light me up in flames
Light me up in

Light me up, oh
Light me up, oh
Light me up, oh
Light me up in flames, oh
Light me up, oh
Light me up, oh
Light me up, oh
Light me up in flames
