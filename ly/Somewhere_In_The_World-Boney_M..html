		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Time, changer of seasons, time will see another flower growing.
Climb over the mountains, there you'll find warm winds blowing.
Somewhere in the world there is peace of mind.
Somewhere in the world that's what I must find.
Somewhere in the world there's a place for me in this world.
I cannot believe it, everywhere I see lonely faces.
Why have we no answers, just some more empty places?
Somewhere in the world there is peace of mind.
Somewhere in the world that's what I must find.
Somewhere in the world there's a place for me in this world.
Time, changer of seasons, time will see another flower growing.
Climb over the mountains, there you'll find warm winds blowing.
Somewhere in the world there is peace of mind.
Somewhere in the world that's what I must find.
Somewhere in the world there's a place for me in this world.
Somewhere in the world there is peace of mind.
Somewhere in the world that's what I must find.
