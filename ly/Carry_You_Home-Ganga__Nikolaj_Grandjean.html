		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Late night angel take me to your woods
Speed up reach high to get to your heart
Loving you is coming home 
Take me to your house 
Cause your science
Keeps me up all night long

As it happens I know 
As i happens I know you
As it happens I know 
As i happens I know you

I carry you home
I carry you all night
I carry home
I carry you all night

When IÂ´m lost and up in my head
You open my heart you take me in your hand

You carry me home
Home I carry you all night long

As it happens I know 
As i happens I know you
As it happens I know 

I carry you home
I carry you all night
I carry you home
I carry you all night

Hey I know you know
Hey I know you know
Hey I know you know
I know you know
I know you 
I know you 

I know you

Hey I know you know
Hey I know you know
