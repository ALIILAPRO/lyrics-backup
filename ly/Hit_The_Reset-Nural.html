		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Death by a thousand cuts
Scattered parts and can't resuscitate this behemoth
Not without a purpose, we're just
Building something up to tear it down and try again
Tell me where it starts, when does it end?

Hit the reset
Starting over starts with more than words
Hit the reset
Show me who you are, not who you were
All we are, we can't remember
Are we done or never better?
'Cause all we are, we can't remember now

The vultures circling us
Took their pounds of flesh and yet were still lookin' for their cuts
Settled on our hearts
Now we're just bitter that we got so far to watch it crashing in
Tell me, is this reboot kicked to death?
We gotta

Hit the reset
Starting over starts with more than words
Hit the reset
Show me who you are, not who you were
All we are we can't remember
Are we done or never better?
'Cause all we are, we can't remember now

Steadfast in the face inaction
Burnt out, reassembling ashes
Take back your unlimited chances now

Just hit the reset
Starting over starts with more than words
Hit the reset
Show me who you are, not who you were
All we are we can't remember
Are we done or never better?
'Cause all we are we can't remember now

Steadfast in the face inaction
Burnt out, reassembling ashes
Take back your unlimited chances now
