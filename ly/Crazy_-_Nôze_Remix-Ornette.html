		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh what a day
All is wonderful here
But you're the one I miss
And I keep on working

I can see that the trees
Are calling back their leaves
Sunday was a shattering day
But I keep on working

Oh, oh oh don't say no
Oh oh, oh please don't go
Oh, oh, oh you turned it crazy in my mind

Oh, oh oh don't say no
Oh oh, oh please don't go
Oh, oh, oh you turned it crazy in my mind

But I'm here with you
And I'll share everything with you
'Cause there's nothing you can change
Everything remains the same,
Don't forget to keep on going with me

Oh what a day
I take it easy today
But you're the one I miss
And I keep on working

I can feel it in the breeze
Don't know why it's a disease
It's all too much for me
But I keep on going

Oh, oh oh don't say no
Oh oh, oh please don't go
Oh, oh, oh you turned it crazy in my mind

Oh, oh oh don't say no
Oh oh, oh please don't go
Oh, oh, oh you turned it crazy in my mind

But I'm here with you
And I'll share everything with you
'Cause there's nothing you can change
Everything remains the same,
Don't forget to keep on going with me

Don't say no, please don't go
My heart's big enough
For you and for me so
Don't say no please don't go

Please don't go
My heart's big enough
For you and for me so
Don't say no please don't go

Please don't go
My heart's big enough
For you and for me so
Don't say no please don't go

Oh, oh oh don't say no
Oh oh, oh please don't go
Oh, oh, oh you turned it crazy in my mind

Oh, oh oh don't say no
Oh oh, oh please don't go
Oh, oh, oh you turned it crazy in my mind

But I'm here with you
And I'll share everything with you
'Cause there's nothing you can change
Everything remains the same
'Cause there's nothing you can change
Everything remains the same
Don't forget to keep on going with me
