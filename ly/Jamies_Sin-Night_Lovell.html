		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Blaaa
Sweet
Shit
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Some
Aye, aye
Yeah (shit)
Yeah, yeah yeah
Aye

Driving through the night on my ones I'm drifting (sweet)
Thinking 'bout you, I can't even handle this I'm liftin' (sweet)
I see all the quality around me even though I'm blind
Aye
She so fucking sexy, what a goddamn mistress (right)
2 A.M., you all up in my goddamn business (oh shit)
Fuck you, like I told you when I hit you up that time online
Yeah
Watching how you moving is a motherfucking art piece (sweet)
Slowly you'll be mine like a motherfucking car lease (shit)
Chasin' all my problems down the valley, I don't got no time
Yeah
Pickin' out your flaws just to prove that I ain't dreamin' (dream)
I'm a lost cause, why they think a nigga teachin' (oh shit)
Copy all these words just to read it later when I die
Yeah

Jamie wasn't Jamie when she drank up all the Jameson (drink)
I devote my time just so I could fuckin' lay this sin (drink)
Caught me slippin' when you saw me out of place again (sweet)
Yeah
Jamie wasn't Jamie when she drank up all the Jameson (sin)
Jamie, Jamie, Jamie drank up all the Jameson (sweet)
Jamie, Jamie, Jamie drank up all the Jameson

Aye
I said
Sweet
Sin
Drink
