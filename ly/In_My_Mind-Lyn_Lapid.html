		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Quiet as the city air on a summer night after it rains
Faster than a bolt of lightning, the speed of a Japanese bullet train (a train)
And you know, it's always trying stay awake (stay awake)
Oh, but darling, running ain't enough
To escape from the monsters in my brain (in my brain)

People say I'm quiet most of the time
If only you knew what goes on in my mind
(If only you knew, if only you knew)
What goes on in my mind
(If only you knew, if only you knew)
(I'm not toxic, I swear)

Two in the morning, I'm lying awake
These thoughts in my brain
They come out to play
I'm replaying Gumball to keep 'em way

Deep in the silence
May end up violent
What an anomaly
What is so wrong with me?
(Me)

People say I'm quiet most of the time
If only you knew what goes on in my mind
(If only you knew, if only you knew)
What goes on in my mind
(If only you knew, if only you knew)

(If only you knew) what goes on in my
(If only you knew) what goes on in my
(If only you knew) what goes on in my mind
(If only you knew) 
(If only you knew) what goes on in my
(If only you knew) what goes on in my
(If only you knew)
What goes on, what goes on in my mind
