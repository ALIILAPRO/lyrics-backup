		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Between the streets, before the night
I found you all alone
Shaking tired, but looking lost
I came to take you home
And we're walk in silence
Side by side

And I just wanna lay you down your burdens, all your fears
And I don't need your deepest secrets whisper in my ear
'Cause I can hear your heart, your heart
I can hear your heart, your heart

The wind is cold against your hair
But outside is just a blur
I pull you close, you close your eyes
And we don't say a word
We've got to keep it ruling, ruling

And I just wanna lay you down your burdens, all your fears
And I don't need your deepest secrets whisper in my ear
'Cause I can hear your heart, your heart
I can hear your heart, your heart

And we walk in silence
Side by side

And I just wanna lay you down your burdens, all your fears
And I don't need your deepest secrets whisper in my ear
'Cause I can hear your heart, your heart
I can hear your heart, your heart
I can hear your heart, your heart
I can hear your heart, your heart
