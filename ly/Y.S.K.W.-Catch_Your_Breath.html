		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tangled up inside your web
the chemicals flood my head
Wishing we had never met
Then lightening strikes again

I always swear- it's the last time
But you know how to fuck my mind
Then leave me hanging out to dry
Shaking from side effects

Now what have you done
My face is numb
I give up
I give up
  
You should know why
I'm giving you up
My tolerance high
Your only a crutch
You in my bed
I never said no
A rush to the head
Then I'm crashing below
You should know why

The cold sweats come creeping in
Can't guard my heart with shaking hands
Got me to blame I let you in
To live under my skin
All the time it took to find
The ways to fucking say goodbye 
But you know everywhere I hide
Living in my silhouette 

Now what have you done
My face is numb
I give up
I give up
  
You should know why
I'm giving you up
My tolerance high
Your only a crutch
You in my bed
I never said no
A rush to the head
Then I'm crashing below
You should know why

Now what have you done
My face is numb
I give up
I give up
  
You should know why
I'm giving you up
My tolerance high
Your only a crutch
You in my bed
I never said no
A rush to the head
Then I'm crashing below
You should know why
