		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I fall in love with all my problems, will they leave me too?
Well, maybe I believed in all your lies, 'cause I believed in you

Why were you somewhere else when you were next to me?
I know, you know, it keeps me up
Did you think about her face with your hands around my waist?
Did you even give a fuck?

You can't spell lonesome without me, mmm, mmm, mmm
And there's no hope in misery, mmm, mmm, mmm
I can't escape your history, oh
You can't spell lonesome without me, you just can't

Tell me I was more than just a decent opportunity
Or will you tell me anything I wanna hear to control how you're perceived?

Oh, why were you somewhere else when you were next to me?
I know, you know, it keeps me up
Isn't it kind of strange how it all changed when
I wasn't the one they wanted you to love

You can't spell lonesome without me, mmm, mmm, mmm
And there's no hope in misery, mmm, mmm, mmm
I can't escape your history, oh
You can't spell lonesome without me, you just can't

Mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
