		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know you're sometimes frightened, don't be.
I know you're always fighting for what you believe,
But have some faith in me, there is no need
'Cause I will always be beside you.

So tell me…
[Chorus]
Will you ever feel peace inside?
Will you some day feel complete?
Will you ever be at ease in life?
Or will you run eternally?

Why do I think I know what you need?
I guess I should be asking you; What do you need?
But give me time and I will learn. Oh Yeah.
And never again I'll think I know you.

So tell me…
[Chorus]

Well, I suppose I have a tendency to think I know it all.
But sometimes I shouldn't assume anything,
I should simply ask I know that now.
Please forgive my ignorance

[Instrumental]
Now tell me…
[Chorus]
[Chorus]
