		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know that I'm him, bitch, I ain't he
I ain't reckless while driving out in these streets
It ain't even a discussion, girl
I'm the only one for you inside this world
Don't do my business out in public, public
Always been above it
Always an assumption
When you up and coming
I stay on the low year 'round (I really do, for real)
Still, your man wanna be me now (oh, yeah)

Meet me down at the lobby, the W
Rare that I'm here so you should come through
They don't see how
I see, I see
They don't see how
I see, I see, I see (yeah)
Remind me when the coast clear
I can't go inside when demons talk in both ears
That's like suicide
Elevate out of here
'Til I touch the sky
Elevate out of here
'Til I touch the sky

I-i-i-i-i see how your ex get down and
Why she don't like me
I could care less if you keep touching on me like that
All of your secrets in tact
You keep it low, you don't lack
I let you sneak out the back
It gets crazy, I don't wanna sound selfish
I hope you know how I move by now
Only few could see the real me
But I'm not hiding no, no, no, no, no
I just stay on the low year 'round
Can't too many people see me now, oh

Meet me down at the lobby, the W
Rare that I'm here so you should come through
They don't see how
I see, I see
They don't see how
I see, I see, I see (I see, yeah)
Remind me when the coast clear
I can't go inside when demons talk in both ears
That's like suicide
Elevate out of here
'Til I touch the sky
Elevate out of here
'Til I touch the sky

(I miss you too)
(Where you at?)
(Aight, we're on our way right now)
