		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I’m on my knees
I’m far from home
I’m begging for
The rest of frequencies of your design
I’m out of touch
I’m out of luck
So would you cut me open and tell me what’s left inside
Is it part of these illusions
Would you kill me
So why’re you hiding
Would you rot for the unforgiven
Are you waitin' for my decision?
I’m in space, am I
I’m alone, and stuck in the middle
Would you rescue me and stuck in together
Don’t let me out
Tied-up my skin
Another pills, another lies
No, I’m not scared of it
‘Cos I’m out of touch and I’m out of luck
So would you cut me open and tell me what’s left inside
I need a medication
I’m gonna lose myself
Would you kill me
So why’re you hiding
Would you rot for the unforgiven
Are you waitin' for my decision
I’m in space, am I
I’m alone, and stuck in the middle
Would you rescue me and stuck in together
‘Cos I’m in a rush for the fallout and I’ll never be the same for what it’s real
‘Cos I’m in a rush for the fallout
I’m gonna lose myself tonight so go and take, take, take your sympathize
My minds keep running in circles
I’m overdose
I'm overdose
'Cos I'm in a rush for the fallout
'Cos I'm in a rush
Would you kill me
So why’re you hiding
Would you rot for the unforgiven
Are you waitin' for my decision
I’m in space, am I
I’m alone and stuck in the middle
Would you rescue me and stuck here forever
Now
Stuck here forever now
Stuck here forever now
I'm stuck here forever now
I'm overdose
