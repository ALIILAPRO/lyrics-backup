		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You told me you love me
I said it back, I don't mean it
I had to burn everything that I was
Just to come back like a phoenix
A phoenix

You been worried about me
A tornado inside
I've been complicated
Take a second and show me
How to burn and to rise
I could swear I'm changing

I wasn't very happy when you met me
Baby boy

You told me you love me
I said it back, I don't mean it
I had to burn everything that I was
Just to come back like a phoenix
A phoenix

I know I haven't called back
But I'm building it up slowly, baby, surely
You're the first I'ma contact
When I feel good enough
You don't have to worry

I wasn't very happy when you met me
Baby boy

You told me you love me
I said it back, I don't mean it
I had to burn everything that I was
Just to come back like a phoenix
You told me you love me
I said it back, I don't mean it
I had to burn everything that I was
Just to come back like a phoenix

I thought I meant to when I came in this relationship
But all the roses in the world would only fuel my rage
And now you're wounded from the blades, I hope you can forgive
And we can rise from the ashes just like a phoenix

I'm burning alive, first to survive
It's been complicated
Ooh

You told me you love me
I said it back, I don't mean it
I had to burn everything that I was
Just to come back like a phoenix
You told me you love me
I said it back, I don't mean it
I had to burn everything that I was
Just to come back like a phoenix

I thought I meant to when I came in this relationship
But all the roses in the world would only fuel my rage
And now you're wounded from the blades, I hope you can forgive
And we can rise from the ashes just like a phoenix, phoenix
