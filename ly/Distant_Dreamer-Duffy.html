		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Although you think I cope,
My head is filled with hope
Of some place other than here.

Although you think I smile,
Inside all the while
I'm wondering about my destiny.

I'm thinking about,
All the things,
I'd like to do in my life.

I'm a dreamer,
A distant dreamer,
Dreaming for hope, from today.

Even when you see me frown,
My heart won't let me down,
Because I know there's better things to come (Woah Yeah).

And when life gets tough,
I feel I've had enough,
I hold on to a distant star,

I'm thinking about,
All the things,
I'd like to do in my life

I'm a dreamer,
A distant dreamer,
Dreaming for hope, from today.

I'm a dreamer,
A distant dreamer,
Dreaming for hope from today.

Yeah, I'm a dreamer

Oh
Oh
Oh

I'm a dreamer,
A distant dreamer,
Dreaming for hope, from today.

Yeah I'm a dreamer

Oh
Oh
Oh

I'm a dreamer
