		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We missed the point
I would never understand who we are
Cut me out entirely
You don't need anyone else (you don't need anyone else)
It's a war not a reckoning
I ain't no fake, I know you well (I know you well)
But you're still a stranger when it comes to me
Lying under the sun crumbling every part of me (part of me)
This is not a game we used to play

(We're falling away)

I've been there once before, (now) it's falling away
This place is filled with lies, again
To the ground we throw, we throw it away (throw it away)
Everything that we used to be
All that we used to be

You can't see me clearly
I've been lurking here in the dark
I barely know myself anymore
Save me before I self destruct
You see me now
Get the fuck out Iâ€™m neurotic
You see me now
Losing my mind, losing my mind
This place is a lie
You cannot see through the dark, you ain't got eyes for me
This place is a lie
Who is the person that I used to be

I've been there once before, (now) it's falling away
This place is filled with lies, again
To the ground we throw, we throw it away (throw it away)
Everything that we used to be
All that we used to be
