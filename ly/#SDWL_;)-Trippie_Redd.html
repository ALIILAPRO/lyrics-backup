		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She don't want love, she don't want love
She don't want love, she don't want love
Doubled up my cup, doubled up my cup
Doubled up my cup, doubled up my cup
She don't want love, she don't want love
She don't want love, she don't want love
Doubled up my cup, doubled up my cup
Doubled up my cup, doubled up my cup

She don't want love, she just wanna come
She just wanna fuck, bust it like a gun
Put a frown on her face every time that I'm done
Put my dick in her mouth, she put her hair in a bun
Patek don't tell time, solar flare from the sun
Put my mind out in space, put my faith in a gun
If I had a dollar, me and twin both got honey buns
I'ma pop my collar in that bitch in Commes Des Garcon
You a plain nigga, mama mad you her son
You can't dress with us nigga, man, your swag should be shun
My shooters workin', workin', workin', man, yo' ass'll be done
Shawty twerkin', twerkin', twerkin' on that dick just for fun

She don't want love, she don't want love
She don't want love, she don't want love
Doubled up my cup, doubled up my cup
Doubled up my cup, doubled up my cup
She don't want love, she don't want love
She don't want love, she don't want love
Doubled up my cup, doubled up my cup
Doubled up my cup, doubled up my cup
