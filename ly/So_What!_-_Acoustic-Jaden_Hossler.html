		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  These thoughts in my head take control
But when I'm down I beg for more, yeah
I beg for more, yeah
And I've been thinkin' 'bout you all night
I don't wanna fight
All these other random girls wanna kill my vibe
Yeah, what a waste of time

So what? I'm broken
And my heart is frozen
All my words are chokin'
I'm so over life
So what? I'm broken
Knew this love was poison
All these wounds are open
I'm so down tonight
I'm so down tonight

Exhausted, it's toxic
You took a line and crossed it
Don't miss me, you're busy
It sucks that you're so pretty
Walk out my door and you're drivin' away
PTSD leavin' me in my grave
(I'm not okay)

So what? I'm broken
And my heart is frozen
All my words are chokin'
I'm so over life
So what? I'm broken
Knew this love was poison
All these wounds are open
I'm so down tonight
I'm so down tonight

She said it's all my fault
It's all my
She said it's all my fault
It's all my
She said it's all my fault
It's all my
She said it's all my fault
It's all-

So what? I'm broken
And my heart is frozen
All my words are chokin'
I'm so over life
So what? I'm broken
Knew this love was poison
All these wounds are open
I'm so down tonight
I'm so down tonight
