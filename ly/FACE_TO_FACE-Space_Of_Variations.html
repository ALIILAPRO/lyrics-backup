		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's time to awake
Time to wake up

Don't you know that we are stardust?
Don't you know
The skies forget about us

Distorted mind is full of lies
I know these shapes could be mesmerizing
The truth will arouse you up with a stray bullet in your head
And left for dead

Stillborn parade
We're so damn twisted
We live in a lie
Cause we think that we exist
You are six feet under
Cause victim became a hunter

We are nothing
We are nowhere
There is always an ellipsis at the end of our thoughts
When will it be over?
Please tell me
When it will be over?

New era
Old habbits
Something went wrong
Don't you think so?
Through the lens of your eyes you see only pain
Why still you thin that it's ok?

Face to face meet inner space
The worlds collide
Raise your guns in the prayers

Face to face meet with your fate
It's time to awake
Time to wake up

Face to face
