		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Na na na naaa na na woah oh woahh
Na na na naaa na na

A word from the wise, don't try to make life on your own
Remember that Jah Jah's by your side 

For I was a soul who lost 
And my life was in dismay
For among evil forces in which I played, oh

Guns and ammunition 
Were my chosen way of life
With God-fearin' people I choose to strife

For all of the lives that are taken 
They can never be replaced
But still Jah Jah chose to remember my face

Though I never lived like he wanted 
I'm still mindful of what he taught me
So now I beg and plea 
I'm on my bending knees
God Father you rescued me
I've got the scars to show 
I barely made it along life's road 
'Cause when my life got dark he was the only spark
He was the light at the end of the road

When I was young boy 
Growin' up in August Town 
We ate from the same pot 
We were idlings all around

From corner to colour and corner
From rockers to jungle Kintyre
Rising to dread heights and river all around 

And then the footbal ground became my battlefield
And my life seemed so surreal
People were fallin' all around
But Jah helped me to stand my ground
Only Jah, only Jah 
Could've helped me to stand my ground

Though I never lived like he wanted 
I was mindful of what he taught me
So now I beg and plea 
I'm on my bending knees
'Cause Father you rescued me
And I've got the scars to show 
I barely made it along life's road 
'Cause when my life got dark he was the only spark
The light at the end of the road

Never lived to please him 
I never lived like I should
Oh, Father you rescued me 
Oh yeah, oh yeah

I've lived and I've learnt 
I've made mistakes along the way
Now I beg for forgiveness
Each day as I try to pray

So take it from me son 
You can change the world today
And I'm living proof 
Living proof that crime doesn't pay

For I'd never lived like he wanted 
I was mindful of what he taught me
So now I beg and plea 
I'm on my bending knees
'Cause Father he rescued me
And I've got the scars to show 
I barely made it along life's road 
'Cause when my life got dark he was the only spark
The light at the end of the road

I never lived like he wanted 
I was mindful of what he taught me
So now I beg and plea 
I'm on my bending knees
'Cause Father he rescued me
And I've got the scars to show 
I barely made it along life's road 
'Cause when my life got dark he was the only spark
The light at the end of the road

Though I never lived like he wanted 
I was mindful of what he taught me
I'm on my bending knees
I asked the Father please
Father, you rescued me
And I've got the scars to show 
I barely made it along life's road 
As my life got dark he was the only spark
The light at the end of the road

I never lived, never lived (lived like he wanted)
I never lived the way he wanted me to
I never lived, Lord I tell you, now I'm practicing my religion
