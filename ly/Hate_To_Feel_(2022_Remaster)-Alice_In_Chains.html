		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh yeah

What's gone wrong, I can't see straight
Been too long, so full of hate

What the fuck will it take?
Drown myself in my wake
'Nother shaggy D.A
Now a dog, shake my leg
Plastic man, paper face
Candy heart, what a waste
Got to change, set a date
Eat my cake, lick my plate

Stare at me with empty eyes 
And point your words at me
Mirror on the wall will show you
What you're scared to see

I can see, yeah (wish I couldn't see at all)
I can feel (wish I couldn't feel at all)
Hate to see (wish I couldn't see at all)
Hate to feel (wish I couldn't feel at all)

So climb walls
Thin my blood now
And I crawl, back to bed now

What the hell, got to rest
Aching pain in my chest
Lucky me, now I'm set
Little bug for a pet
New Orleans, got to get
Pin cushion medicine
Used to be curious
Now the shit's sustenance

All this time I swore I'd never
Be like my old man
What the hey, it's time to face
Exactly what I am

I can see, yeah (wish I couldn't see at all)
I can feel (wish I couldn't feel at all)
Hate to see (wish I couldn't see at all)
Hate to feel (wish I couldn't feel at all)

What the hell, got to rest
Aching pain in my chest
Lucky me, now I'm set
Little bug for a pet
New Orleans, got to get
Pin cushion medicine
Used to be curious
Now the shit's sustenance

All this time I swore I'd never
Be like my old man
What the hey, it's time to face
Exactly who I am

I can see, yeah (wish I couldn't see at all)
I can feel (wish I couldn't feel at all)
Hate to see (wish I couldn't see at all)
Hate to feel (wish I couldn't feel at all)

I can see, yeah (wish I couldn't see at all)
I can feel (wish I couldn't feel at all)
Hate to see (wish I couldn't see at all)
Hate to feel (wish I couldn't feel at all)
