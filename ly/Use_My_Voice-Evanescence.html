		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Cover my ears and close my eyes
Just long enough to stop the noise
Go on take everything and throw it away
But I will use my voice

(Oh oh, oh oh oh oh)
(Oh oh, oh oh oh oh)

Drown every truth in an ocean of lies
Label me bitch because I dare to draw my own line
Burn every bridge and build a wall in my way
But I will use my voice

(Oh oh, oh oh oh oh)
Whether you like it or not, you're gonna take what I got
(Oh oh, oh oh oh oh)
If we can't talk about it, we'll just keep drowning in it
(Oh oh, oh oh oh oh)
Give me credit or not, I give a lot, give a lot
But don't you speak for me
(Oh oh, oh oh oh oh)
No, don't you speak for me

Never mind me, I'm a waste of your time
I'm never gonna fit in the box that you need 
And I can read between the lines, yeah
Gather your friends and wave your gun in my face
But I will use my voice

(Oh oh, oh oh oh oh)
Whether you like it or not, you're gonna take what I got
(Oh oh, oh oh oh oh)
If we can't talk about it, we'll just keep drowning in it
(Oh oh, oh oh oh oh)
Give me credit or not, I give a lot, give a lot
But don't you speak for me
(Oh oh, oh oh oh oh)
No, don't you speak for me

Whether you like it or not
Whether you like it or not
Whether you like it or not
Whether you like it or not

One day soon
It's gonna fall back on you
No more lies
We're gonna break right through
Like it or not

(Oh oh, oh oh oh oh)
If we can't talk about it, we'll just keep drowning in it
(Oh oh, oh oh oh oh)
Give me credit or not, I give a lot, give a lot
But don't you speak for me
(Oh oh, oh oh oh oh)
No, don't you speak for me
(Oh oh, oh oh oh oh)
Don't you speak for me (whether you like it or not)
