		  Baby, what you doin'?
Baby, what you doin'?

Baby, what you doin'?
Come here I been missin' you
I wanna fuck
I know you can tell by how I'm kissin' you
I know you say you like it when I get to rubbin' you (get to rubbin' you)
Okay bet, come here baby girl and let me rub on you (let me feel on you)
Baby, what you doin'?
Baby, what you doin'? (Baby, what you doin'?)
Baby, what you doin'?
Come here I been missin' you
Baby, what you doin'?
Baby, what you doin'? (Baby, what you doin'?)
Baby, what you doin'?
Come here I been missin' you

When I put it in your stomach you be screamin' tryna take it (tryna take it)
You grip the covers tight while you make the ugly faces
Yeah, that outfit cute but you look better when you naked (you look better when you naked)
Everybody say my name but it sound better when you say it
Let my face be your chair, come here sit right here
All that juice drippin' out, got some in my ear
While I'm in it, look you in the eyes, you know I like to stare
When you finna cum you say, "Don't stop, right there"
All I hear is "Frrp, frrp, frrp, frrp, frrp," when you throw it back
Damn, mm-mm-mm, bae, you throwin' that
All of it can't even fit in one hand that's how you know it's fat
I fiend for it soon as we get done that's how I know you crack

Baby, what you doin'?
Come here I been missin' you
I wanna fuck
I know you can tell by how I'm kissin' you
I know you say you like it when I get to rubbin' you (get to rubbin' you)
Okay bet, come here baby girl and let me rub on you (let me feel on you)
Baby, what you doin'?
Baby, what you doin'? (Baby, what you doin'?)
Baby, what you doin'?
Come here I been missin' you
Baby, what you doin'?
Baby, what you doin'? (Yeah, Big Latto) (baby, what you doin'?)
Baby, what you doin'?
Come here I been missin' you (uh)

When I throw it back (uh)
He like, "Bae, lets sixty-nine," I told him, "I don't fuck with rats" (nah)
Got that, "Hello, nice to meet you" grip, you know this pussy snatch (uh)
This that Mortal Combat, I finish him, he met his match
Daddy, what you doin'? Come here, I been missin' you
I wanna fuckin' lick on you
Swallow it, and sip on you
I was thinkin' balcony, you know I love that penthouse view
Sloppy-toppy in the coupe (uh)
Talk to it like interviews (yeah)
Let yo' face be my chair, I'ma sit right here (here)
I love missionary, make my ankles touch my ear (ear)
Bae, you know I'm cocky, wanna fuck you in the mirror (on God)
Actin' scared of the pussy, I'ma make him face his fear

Ayy, ayy, LaKeyah
Got a thing for them street niggas
Other niggas can't compete with 'em (nuh-uh)
Grip my ass like the Glock .40 
While I ride the dick like a beat, nigga
No BBL but my waist snatched
Petite bitch, yeah, I'm real bad (real bad)
Feed it to you like soul food 
Only real niggas get to taste that (ayy, ayy)
Know you wanna fuck
I'm like, "Come on bae, wassup?"
He like, "Baby, where you at?"
I'm like, "Boy, I'm pullin' up"
Ayy, you can fold me up with my legs long
Let 'em hit it, have his head gone (ayy)
Rocks off then I head home
Dog niggas out, do 'em dead wrong (I'ma dog)
If he wanna pull it
I'ma let the nigga 'cause he paying for it just to get it done (ayy)
Tell my nigga don't be scared now 
Take the safety off I'ma tryna make you bust
He said, "Girl, I'm tryna wife ya"
I ain't tryna be no wifey
I'm the type to go one night and block a nigga while he typin'
He like

Baby, what you doin'?
Come here I been missin' you
I wanna fuck
I know you can tell by how I'm kissin' you
I know you say you like it when I get to rubbin' you (get to rubbin' you)
Okay bet, come here baby girl and let me rub on you (let me feel on you)
Baby, what you doin'?
Baby, what you doin'? (Baby, what you doin'?)
Baby, what you doin'?
Come here I been missin' you
Baby, what you doin'?
Baby, what you doin'? (Baby, what you doin'?)
