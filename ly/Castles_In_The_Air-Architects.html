		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is the be all, the end all.
The burden, the blessing.
This is the be all, the end all.
The burden, the blessing.

I've made promises that I know I can't keep.
Drink from the holy grail, you'll find it's bittersweet.
No matter what he says, poison is not my friend.
But he'll have my back until the bitter end.

Always climbing but only ever descending.
The canvas before me is never-ending.

So call for the crossroads if you're lost in the woods.
If I drop this torch then I'll be gone for good.
I said "enough is enough".
Well I guess I lied, I guess I lied.

This is the be all, the end all.
The burden, the blessing.
This is the be all, the end all.
The burden, the blessing.

All my mistakes will outlive me.
I just can't accept that what will be, will be.
My lungs are failing, I can't catch my breath.
I don't know why, but right now I'm scared to death.

My fear still sees when my eyes are closed.
But the blame's on me, this is the path I chose.

Always climbing but only ever descending.
The canvas before me is never-ending.

So call for the crossroads if you're lost in the woods.
If I drop this torch then I'll be gone for good.
I said "enough is enough".
Well I guess I lied, I guess I lied.

I wasted time building castles in the air.
If there's peace to be found, I won't find it there.
My fear still sees when my eyes are closed.
But the blame's on me, this is the path I chose.

This is the path I chose. This is the path I chose.

I wasted time building castles in the air.
If there's peace to be found, I won't find it there.
My fear still sees when my eyes are closed.
But the blame's on me, this is the path I chose.
