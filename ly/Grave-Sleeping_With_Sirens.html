		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm not who I'm supposed to be
I bring out the worst in me
I see my reflection
It's always in the wrong direction
And now I'm back to where I started
Being the bullet and a target
Separate the man from the artist
If I'm being honest

I'm either half awake or half asleep
I'm half the man I used to be
I don't know much by but I'm tryin'
To find a way to live when it feels like I'm dyin'

I'm in the dark, I'm falling apart
It shouldn't have to be so hard
Why do I carry all this weight when I don't need it?
Keep me away, I'm trying to change
'Cause I've got one foot in the grave
And if I slip, I can't be saved from all my demons

One foot in the grave (grave)

Why do I always run away from the things I love?
I'm tryin' to learn how to fix it
Guess I was raised with it in my blood
Afraid of commitment

I'm either half awake or half asleep or half the man I used to be
I don't know much but I'm tryin' to find a way to live

I'm in the dark, I'm falling apart
It shouldn't have to be so hard
Why do I carry all this weight when I don't need it?
Keep me away, I'm trying to change
'Cause I've got one foot in the grave
And if I slip, I can't be saved from all my demons
One foot in the grave, grave, grave (grave, grave, grave)
One foot in the grave (grave, grave, grave)

And now I'm back where I started (I'm in the dark)
Being the bullet and a target (falling apart)
Separate the man from the artist (I'm in the dark)
If I'm being honest

I'm in the dark, I'm falling apart
It shouldn't have to be so hard
Why do I carry all this weight when I don't need it?
(When I don't need it?)
Keep me away, I'm trying to change
'Cause I've got one foot in the grave
And if I slip, I can't be saved from all my demons
One foot in the grave, grave, grave (grave, grave, grave)
One foot in the grave (grave, grave, grave)
One foot in the grave
