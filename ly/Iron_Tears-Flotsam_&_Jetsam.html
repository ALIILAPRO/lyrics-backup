		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What is this game we play with broken hearts and tears?
Been played by young and old for oh, so many years
Can you tell me honestly you've never been a pawn?
Someone steals your love away, you turn around, they're gone

It is the game of temptation
It is the play of the heart
Cry out in desperation
Iron tears take you apart

Love to you is lies to me
Iron tears
Love is cruel and lies cut deep
Iron tears

This time reverse the pain that brought upon your fears
This time forget the part about broken hearts and tears
Come on, take command, show no mercy, cruel and cold
Iron eyes see right through and control the soul

It is the game of temptation
It is the play of the heart
Cry out in desperation
Iron tears take you apart

My love for you is lies, you see
Iron tears
Love is cruel and lies cut deep
Iron tears

Iron tears, the tears you cry
Are tears enough for all
Iron tears, the tears I cry
Are tears enough for all

Now you know just how it feels from both sides of the heart
Do you like the tearing, or to be torn apart?
What do you feel inside when you bleed a soul?
What do you want from love, mercy or control?

It is the game of temptation
It is the play of the heart
Cry out in desperation
Iron tears take you apart

The game of love is made of lies
Don't you see?
Iron tears will forever be
Iron tears
