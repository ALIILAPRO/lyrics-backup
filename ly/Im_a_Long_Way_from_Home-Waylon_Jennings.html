		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm a long way from home and so all alone homesick like I never thought I'd be
I'm a long way from home everything is wrong someone please watch over me
I'm not a custom to this feeling loneliness is burning in my soul
Sometimes the mind is so mistreating I wish I'd stayed at home like I was told

I wish I knew the force within me that keeps my mind out of control
What makes me reach for things that I can't see
I wish I'd stayed at home like I was told
I'm a long way from home...
