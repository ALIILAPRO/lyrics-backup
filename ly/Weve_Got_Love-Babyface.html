		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We done pain and sorrow
We done been through change
We done had way better days, yes sir
But I seen tomorrow
I ain't see no rain
'Cause our sun's gonna shine again

I been thinking 'bout it
Ain't no doubt about it
We got something that the world
Just can't explain
It was the one thing
That makes it always work out
It's 'cause we got love, love, love, love, love
If we got nothin' else
We got love
It's 'cause we got love, love, love, love, love
At least that's something, yes
We got love

And the world goes round and round, round and round
And the world goes round and round
And the world goes round and round
Around in circles

We didn't have no money
Our bills ain't been paid
Coulda lost 'bout everything
But we climbed that mountain
And we found a way
And we back on top again

I been thinking 'bout it
Ain't no way 'round it
Girl, we got something that the world
Just can't explain
It was the one thing
That makes it always work out
It's 'cause we got love, love, love, love, love
If we got nothin' else
We got love
It's 'cause we got love, love, love, love, love
At least that's something, yes
We got love

And the world goes round and round, round and round
And the world goes round and round
And the world goes round and round
Around in circles

And the world goes round and round, round and round
And the world goes round and round
And the world goes round and round
Around in circles

I been thinking 'bout it
Ain't no way 'round it
Girl, we got something that the world
Just can't explain
It was the one thing
That makes it always work out
It's 'cause we got love, love, love, love, love
If we got nothin' else
We got love
It's 'cause we got love, love, love, love, love
At least that's something, yes
We got love

It's 'cause we got love, love, love, love, love
If we got nothin' else
We got love come on, come on
It's 'cause we got love, love, love, love, love
At least that's something, yes
We got love
Come on say love (love, love, nothing else love)
Love, love, love, love, nothin' else
Love, love, love, love, nothin' else, love
Love, love, love, something yes
