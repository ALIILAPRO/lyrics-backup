		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dark things in my mind again
I don't wanna have a bad night again
I might lose my mind again
I might lose my mind again
Dark things in my mind again
I don't wanna have a bad night again
I might lose my mind again
I might lose my mind again

Don't relapse (wait) hold up, don't relax (yuh)
Heart attack, ice inside my cartiac
I'm a sicko, I'm a fucking hypochondriac
Fuck the pain away, beat it like a 808
And I know I said I quit drugs last time
That was last time, life in the fast lane
H-H-Hydroplaning off a flat, might flatline
If I let the brains blow, that's a landmine
I need you to love me like I never loved me
Everyone around me want something from me
Pretty girls want truth but the truth is ugly
She don't even like me, she just wanna fuck me!
Feel like Amy Wine again, this is absinthe, not Heineken
25, running out of time again, 27 Club, how can I get in?

Dark things in my mind again
I don't wanna have a bad night again
I might lose my mind again
I might lose my mind again
Dark things in my mind again
I don't wanna have a bad night again
I might lose my mind again
I might lose my mind again

I'm fine, just a little fucked up (up!)
Crush a blue pill, put it in a red cup (cup!)
Call up the plug, now I'm in The Matrix (ayy!)
Like I'm Morpheus, turn my morphine up (turn up!)
I see all these demons in my nightmares
I can run but I can't escape the night terrors, every night
Yuh, lost in despair but you don't even care and I'm not scared
I'm a monster, am I scaring you?
Way I'm driving, like I'm Death Proof
So trust me, judge me
If you love me, just love me as I am

Dark things in my mind again
I don't wanna have a bad night again
I might lose my mind again
I might lose my mind again
Dark things in my mind again
I don't wanna have a bad night again
I might lose my mind again
I might lose my mind again

How I'm 'pposed to
How am I supposed to stop being crazy?
How? How? How?
How I'm 'gon stop?

Bro her ass be tweakin', bro
"Is everything good at home?"
Fuck is you talkin' 'bout?
I know what you need, bruh
You need you a decent lil' situation of ya own
With the slug, on God
