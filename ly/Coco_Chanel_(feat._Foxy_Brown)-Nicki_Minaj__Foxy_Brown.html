		  (Whole lotta gang shit)

Oh, uh, ugh, ay yo Chun, uh
Ay yo Chun
We back on that Coco shit nigga number one, uh
Whole lotta gang shit
Haha, every bitch bloodclaat, you heard me
Oh, ay yo, uh, Brooklyn!
Yo (let's go baby)

Llévame a la coco (yeah a la coco)
Ellos quieren coco (y yo tampoco)
Never trust a broke hoe (don't fuck with po-po)
Número uno (me llama Yoko)
Pull up in them thing things (and let them things swing)
Niggas know my name ring (and it go ding-ding)
If I get an inkling (the thing'll sing-sing)
Ain't talkin' 'bout the singer (the thing'll sting-sting)

Ayo if I'm in the Gurkha, then they in the back of it (back)
If I tell 'em eat food, then they make a snack of it (snack)
If they take your cocaine then they make a crack of it
If they grab your gold chain then they make a plaque of it (plaque)
Know we never lack on it, run up with the MAC on it
Put a couple racks on it, they gon' put the whack on it (the whack)
She got the Nicki bundles, worth a stack on it (stack)
That's word to Brook'-nam, that's word to Bucktown
That's word to Harlem World (Harlem World), shout out to uptown
You know I shine on 'em, I spray sheen on 'em
That's word to Southside, Jamaica, Queens on 'em
I'm mad Queens on 'em, with mad schemes on 'em
I never scale back, the triple beams on 'em
My ice gleams on 'em, Wu-Tang creams on 'em
I pull up on the block bumpin' Biggie "Dreams" on 'em (ooh)
A nigga greazed on 'em, but ice freezed on 'em (oii)
I light breezed on 'em (uh), I might breeze on 'em (grr)
Might do it like it's Christmas and light trees on 'em
I see the copycats bitin' my steez on 'em (yo)

Llévame a la coco (yeah a la coco)
Ellos quieren coco (y yo tampoco)
Never trust a broke hoe (don't fuck with po-po)
Número uno (me llama Yoko)
Pull up in them thing things (and let them things swing)
Niggas know my name ring (and it go ding-ding)
If I get an inkling (the thing'll sing-sing)
Ain't talkin' 'bout the singer (the thing'll sting-sting)

Gimme some bloodclaat gunshots
Brooklyn where the fuck we at? Flatbush, Bed-Stuy
That's my word to Big, I'ma murder them rasclaat
All black Chloe chaps, gyally I'ma skully to the back
Fuck where my ratchet at? Come make me dutty that
Pussy dem ah chat 'bout, back like I never left
Man down when I come 'round, all y'all bitches bow down
King Fox, King Kong, back on my Chun-Li, nigga
Valentino bling thong, all y'all bitches duck me, fuck

C's pon my likkle pretty red bow
See dem buss one for baby, see dem, chuh
Pussy wan' try I-I-I-I
Yuh bloodclaat diss, them boys light my day
Them bitches in them bum-ass Louis thigh highs
I'm on my clip, blue jeep, Van Herpen lady
Gun slingers, let me see y'all gun fingers
Y'all bitches dick riders
Little Nicki's, little Inga (oh oh oh)

Llévame a la coco (yeah a la coco)
Ellos quieren coco (y yo tampoco)
Never trust a broke hoe (don't fuck with po-po)
Número uno (me llama Yoko)
Pull up in them thing things (and let them things swing)
Niggas know my name ring (and it go ding-ding)
If I get an inkling (the thing'll sing-sing)
Ain't talkin' 'bout the singer (the thing'll sting-sting)

Foxy plus one is me, young Chun
And we, ah gon' fuck the di place and done
So tell 'em run, come and bring a lump sum
(Ayo Fox) they don't make us or break us
Word to young guns (put your hands up)
Illest to ever do it (uh-huh), tell' em fi recognize (yeah)
Unuh cartel, dem fi free up Vybz
They call me Mrs. Bitch, but I don't miss, bitch
Got real shooters, better D up, guys
Who me? I'm physically fine
Who she? It's how we know she dyin'
Bitch ain't see Billboard in 2017 (2017)
Had to drop Queen on 'em like a guillotine (like a guillotine)
All these jealous bitches on the jelly team
Keepin' it a hundred, that's a jelly bean
Uh, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh, uh-uh (ay, ay)
Uh, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh, uh-uh (ay, ay)
