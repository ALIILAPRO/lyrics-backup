		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Been around since four years old, we watched each other grow
So many stories have been told, yeah, we've been through it all
I honestly don't know what I would do without her
See, even when it all falls down, I'll always be around

I know her inside out
Wish I could take the pain away somehow

Watching her heart break is makin' my heart ache
I want to be her savior but I can't save her
I made a promise that time makes it better
I'm so god damn helpless, don't know where to start
'Cause watching her heart break is breakin' my heart

When she needs a little love, I'll be her pick me up
When she's cryin' in her, I'll bring the coffee cup
I'll hold her in my arms until she smiles a little
No matter what time, day or night, I'll be on the line

I know her inside out
Wish I could take the pain away somehow

Watching her heart break is makin' my heart ache
I want to be her savior but I can't save her
I made a promise that time makes it better
I'm so god damn helpless, don't know where to start
'Cause watching her heart break is breakin' my heart

Watching her heart break is makin' my heart ache (watchin' her heart break) 
I want to be her savior but I can't save her (no, I can't save her)
I made a promise that time makes it better (time makes it better)
I'm so god damn helpless, don't know where to start
'Cause watching her heart break is breakin' my heart
Watching her heart break is breakin' my heart
