		<p>
		  Hey there, little darling, can I call you on my pay phone?
Stay gold, little darling, but I promise you that I won't
I won't stay gone, uh, uh, too long
Hey there, little darling, can I get you back at my home?
Stay gold, little darling, and I promise you that I won't go
Go, go now, uh, too long, yeah

Show me how you want it, baby, show me all you got
Got my ice cream cake with vanilla on top
Just show me how you want it, baby, show me all you got (oh)
My ice cream cake (I won't stay gone for too long)
My ice cream cake (darling, look at me now)
My ice cream cake with vanilla on top
My ice cream cake with vanilla on top
My ice cream cake

Hey babe, little darling, can I kiss you on your rose lips?
Loving, little darling, can I promise you that I won't, won't stay gone?
No, I won't, I won't stay gone for far too long, no

Operator, buy my love that fast fancy candy lemon squeeze
Me and my baby have to make it there
Love upon ya, California
When I feel fine, New York City
To Texas later, I'll be back home, darling

Call my love right now
So shimmy, shimmy rock
Look, you can sit yourself down (with vanilla on top)
Pick up that telephone now
Or forever hold your peace, darling (ice cream cake with vanilla on top)
Not too proud to beg (shimmy, shimmy, come on, baby, show me how you rock)
Right down to my knees (ice cream cake with vanilla on top)
Come my lover, rest your soul (so shimmy, shimmy rock)
Can I call you on the telephone? (With vanilla on top)
'Cause I need my love, my love
(Ice cream cake with vanilla on top)
For too long (shimmy, shimmy, come on, baby, show me how you rock)
Got my Ice cream cake with vanilla on top

Hey there, little darling, can I call you on my pay phone?
Stay gold, little darling, but I promise you that I won't
Won't stay gone, no, I'm right here (ice cream cake with vanilla on top)
Too long (ice cream cake with vanilla on top)

(For a little while, while, baby)
(Life is sweet you know)
(what you want it to be now)
(dreaming of me, yeah)

with vanilla on top
with vanilla on top
got my ice cream cake with vanilla on top
My ice cream cake with vanilla on top, top, alright

I said, I love my love with
Ice cream cake with vanilla on top
My ice cream cake with vanilla on top
My key in the ignition, baby, show me how you rockin'
Got my ice cream cake with vanilla on top
