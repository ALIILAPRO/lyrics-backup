		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is a warning, I serve notice
I'm ready for anything and
You gotta know this
This is a war cry,  it's my culture
No weapon against me will prosper
And I'm taking back what you stole twofold
Sevenfold
You know, I know, my God's got it all (Ayy)
Put it on the map, that's fine
It's all on the line

I was born for the battle, na na na
I'm not gonna settle, na na na
I'm putting my praise on and
It ain't coming off
And there's nothing better, than my God

This is a warzone but we taking it back
Face facts and retract any kind of attack
This is my warcry, it's like I told ya
Drowning out your noise as I shout hallelujah
Ain't nothing gonna touch me
'Cause I was born for this
And I'm prepared for this
So you can throw your sticks and stones
But I know that my God's on the throne
And we gonna win every time

I was born for the battle, na na na
I'm not gonna settle, na na na
I'm putting my praise on and
It ain't coming off
And there's nothing better, than my God

No force in the galaxy can stop Your love
No fear in the world can defy Your love
And Your love's gonna last forever
No force in the galaxy can stop Your love
No fear in the world can defy Your love
And You love me, your love for me
And 'cause you chose me

I was born for the battle, na na na
I'm not gonna settle, na na na
I'm putting my praise on and
It ain't coming off
And there's nothing better, than my God
I was born for the battle, na na na
I'm not gonna settle, na na na
I'm putting my praise on and
It ain't coming off
And there's nothing better, than my God

This is a warning, I serve notice
I'm ready for anything and
You gotta know this
This is a warcry, it's my culture
No weapon against me will prosper
And I'm taking back what you stole twofold
Sevenfold
You know, I know, my God's got it all (Ayy)
Put it on the map that's mine
It's all on the line
And it's time to define the
Divinity that lives in me
Trinity with proclivity to victory
Liberty with a heavenly artillery, like
I'm on the right side of Kingdom grace
First name basis with the Maker
Of the human race
We got that W, my portion doubled too
Captain on my team's known for breakthrough
If God is for me what can be against
Redemption is the best defence
I was born for the battle
