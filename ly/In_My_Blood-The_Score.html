		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm a dreamer but it's getting hard to take it
Some nights don't know if I'm gonna make it
Heart is heavy but there's nothing that can break me down
(Break me down, down, down)
Cold blooded like the world outside that made me
Shine bright from the fire that it gave me
Breathe in think it's time to write my story now
(Story now, now)

Bloody knuckles got 'em banging on my chest
Tunnel vision people say that I'm obsessed
I'm a warrior, I am not like the rest
And I won't back down

It isn't in my blood
To surrender I won't break
I'll remember who I am
In the face of my fears
It isn't in my blood
I'm relentless I don't quit
Won't forget this and my pain
Is what got me right here
It isn't in my blood
Whoa, oh oh
It isn't in my blood
Whoa, oh oh

Cut my teeth on the road up to the top
I stay sharp 'cause the grindin' never stops
I ain't high and I don't ever wanna hit the ground
(Hit the ground, ground)
The rain can't put the fire out
Inside my heart is raging now
And I'm gonna let it burn

Bloody knuckles, got 'em banging on my chest
Tunnel vision, people say that I'm obsessed
I'm a warrior, I am not like the rest
And I won't back down

It isn't in my blood
To surrender I won't break
I'll remember who I am
In the face of my fears
It isn't in my blood
I'm relentless, I don't quit
Won't forget this and my pain
Is what got me right here
It isn't in my blood
Whoa, oh oh
It isn't in my blood
Whoa, oh oh

The rain can't put the fire out
Inside my heart is raging now
And I'm gonna let it burn

It isn't in my blood
To surrender, I won't break
I'll remember who I am
In the face of my fears
It isn't in my blood
I'm relentless, I don't quit
Won't forget this and my pain
Is what got me right here
It isn't in my blood 
Whoa, oh oh
It isn't in my blood 
Whoa, oh oh
It isn't in my blood 
Whoa, oh oh
It isn't in my blood 
Whoa, oh oh
