		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  VERSE 1:
They banished me, never to be seen
To a place where the air's always filled with screams
So hot that the land only grows weeds
c place filled with demons and ghosts, tumbleweeds
Betrayed by some comrades
“Et tu, Brute?”
Imma get you all back
It's not “if”, no it's “when”
Better watch out cause I'm coming for revenge

Imma train hard
Imma go far
I will learn with
Every new scar
Got a cold heart
Yeah, a villain arc
Enemies give me energy
From the start
Got an addiction to winning
So, I will work till I get it
The sweat is dripping, I'm in it
I'll never stop till I finish
I feel the demons possessing
They took a hold of my vessel
The energy of a devil, yeah

PRE:
c new man
c new me
Better watch out you ain't never seen a beast
I don't always have control, he can be mean
Got a chip on his shoulder and he got some sharp teeth
cnyone in my way
cnd anyone who betrayed
cnyone I have to face

HOOK:
I'll wipe'em out like the plague
I'll wipe'em out like the plague

VERSE 2:
Bullets fly through the air
If you got a death wish, come outside don't be scared
Yeah, I'm more than prepared
I've been prepping for this day and now it's finally here
Better watch out
Cause I'm back now
New and improved, head filled with no doubts
They let the beast out
I let him feast now
I will be at the top, can't keep me down

PRE:
c new man
c new me
Better watch out you ain't never seen a beast
I don't always have control, he can be mean
Got a chip on his shoulder and he got some sharp teeth
cnyone in my way
cnd anyone who betrayed
cnyone I have to face

HOOK:
I'll wipe'em out like the plague
I'll wipe'em out like the plague
