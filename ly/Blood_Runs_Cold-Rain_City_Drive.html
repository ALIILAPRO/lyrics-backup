		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Every last cell on fire
Said we couldn't make it right
Hoping that you change your mind
So I'll leave a light on 
It's the push and pull
We've been down this road
And we always survive
But how many times
Can we hit this low
It's irrational
And we end up alone
Whoa

I still feel you my veins
Given up, but I can't just walk away
You're already part of me
Whoa
Even when our blood runs cold
And there's nowhere to go 
We'd find a way
I can feel you in my veins 
Whoa

I guess you wanted me to get some help
And I just took it out on one of my songs
But if you wind up with somebody else
Whoa
Hang on like an icicle
Clinical
Don't make somebody happy, no
Keep asking for
So much more
Than they could ever endure

I still feel you my veins
Given up but I can't just walk away
You're already part of me
Whoa
Even when our blood runs cold
And there's nowhere to go 
We'd find a way
I can feel you in my veins 
Whoa

I couldn't ever let you change me
No we don't understand the same things
You built a prison just to cage me
And it turned into a furnace for a flame

I still feel you my veins
Given up, but I can't just walk away
You're already part of me
Whoa
Even when our blood runs cold
And there's nowhere to go 
We'd find a way
I can feel you in my veins 
Whoa
Even when the blood runs cold
Blood runs cold
