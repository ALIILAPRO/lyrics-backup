		  Hold up
Wishing time would slow up
Seeming like there's
No love
Maybe I should get away
For one more day
Yeah, oh no
Don't like flying solo

When I'm feeling so low
Let's run away
To find a better place
Yeah, think that it's about time
To turn off the TV and drive all night
Everything's kinda scary in the moonlight
I gotta find the sunshine
This city's too much for me, yeah

It's pretty but it's plain to see
There's more out there than meets the eye
But I'll stay home, 'cause I'm too tired
I'll keep sleeping in
I'll keep sleeping in 'til I
Find some peace again
But that don't feel right, so

Hold up
Wishing time would Slow up
Seeming like there's
No love
Maybe I should get away
For one more day
Yeah, oh, no
Don't like flying solo
When I'm feeling so low
Let's run away

To find a better place
Let's find a better place out there (out there)
Let's find a better place out there (out there)
Some think that is a marathon
But I need somethin to count on
I've been workin here for too long
Here comes another yawn
Feel like I gotta treat myself at
Least while I am young so
I wanna follow my heart around the world
I'll keep sleeping in
I'll keep sleeping in 'til I
Find some peace again
But that don't feel right, so

Hold up
Wishing time would slow up
Seeming like there's
No love
Maybe I should get away
For one more day
Yeah, oh, no
Don't like flying solo
When I'm feeling so low
Let's run away
To find a better place

I'll keep sleeping in
I'll keep sleeping in 'til I
Find some peace again
Find some peace again, will I
Ever make it out
Ever make it out of here?
I need something new
Something new
So can we please

Hold up
Wishing time would slow up
Seeming like there's
No love
Maybe I should get away
For one more day
Yeah, oh, no
Don't like flying solo
When I'm feeling so low
Let's run away
To find a better place
Let's find a better place out there (out there)
Let's find a better place out there (out there)
