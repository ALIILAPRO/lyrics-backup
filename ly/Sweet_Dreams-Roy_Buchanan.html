		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sweet dreams of you
Every night I go through
Why can't I forget you and start my life new
Instead of having sweet dreams about you?

You don't love me it's plain 
I should have known I'd never wear your ring 
I should hate you the whole night through 
Instead of having sweet dreams about you

Why can't I forget the past
Start loving someone new
Instead of having sweet dreams about you?
Instead of having sweet dreams about you
