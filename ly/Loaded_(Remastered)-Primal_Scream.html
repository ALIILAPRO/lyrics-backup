		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Just what is it that you want to do?
Well, we wanna be free, we wanna be free to do what we wanna do
And we wanna get loaded and we wanna have a good time
And that's what we're gonna do (away baby, let's go)
We're gonna have a good time, we're gonna have a party

I don't wanna lose your love
I don't wanna lose your love
I don't wanna lose your love
I don't wanna lose your love

Just what is it that you wanna do?

I'm gonna get deep down, deep down I said
I'm gonna get deep down, deep down woo hey

We wanna be free to do what we wanna do
Away baby, let's go

I don't wanna lose your love
I don't wanna lose your love

We wanna be free to do what we wanna do

Oh yeah

We wanna be free to do what we wanna do
I don't wanna lose your love
I don't wanna lose your love
I don't wanna lose your love
I don't wanna lose your love
I don't wanna lose your love
I don't wanna lose your love
I don't wanna lose your love
I don't wanna lose your love
I don't wanna lose your love
I don't wanna lose your love

Just what is it that you want to do?
We wanna get loaded and we wanna have a good time
