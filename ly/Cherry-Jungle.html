		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You never gonna change me
You ne'
You never gonna change me
I was already changin'
You never gonna change me
You ne'
You never gonna change me
I was already changin'

I wish I could protect you 
That was all wasted
Flower something new
I wish I could perfect you
I was wrong they say
Now I'm over you

Flowers in the garden that won't grow
Flowers on the train, it's not the same
Flowers in the garden
Life won't grow if we never change

You never gonna change me
I'm missin'
You never gonna change me
I was already changin'
You never gonna change me
You never gonna change me
I was already changin'

You never gonna change me

I wish I could protect you
I was wrong they say
Findin' someone new
Now we stop the pretendin'
Kinda hard to listen
While they're talkin'

Flowers in the garden that won't grow
Flowers on the train, it's not the same
Flowers in the garden
Life won't grow if we never change

You never gonna change me
I'm missin'
You never gonna change me
I was already changin'
You never gonna change me
You never gonna change me
I was already changin'

You never gonna change me
