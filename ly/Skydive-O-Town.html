		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm seeing you again
Watching you doing all the things we used to do as two
But now it's only one, it's you
And I remember when we would go for days
In ways we thought would never end
And now it's over, it's just me

And I don't like the sound
Of our feet on the ground
Unless we're running to the edge
Of something new for you and me

And I just wanna fall again
And I just wanna learn to fly
So I can love you like I never did

And I just wanna skydive
Right into your life
Seeing the whole world by your side
And I just wanna skydive
Right into your life
Seeing the whole world by your side
We can skydive
Skydive, oh

I wait outside your life
Holding on to memories of everything you were to me
And how I was to you
And do you think of me
Do you feel the way I feel before I sleep I close my eyes
And open them with you
Alone, I don't belong
You know I'm holding on
And how we'll let go of the dreams I had
I know they can come true

And I just wanna fall again
And I just wanna learn to fly
So I can love you like I never did

And I just wanna skydive
Right into your life
Seeing the whole world by your side
And I just wanna skydive
Right into your life
Seeing the whole world by your side
We can skydive

Seeing the whole world by your side
Skydive
I'm seeing the whole world by your side

I just wanna skydive
Right into your life
Seeing the whole world by your side
And I just wanna skydive
Right into your life
Seeing the whole world by your side

And I wanna skydive
Right into your life
Seeing the whole world by your side

I wanna skydive
Right into your life
Seeing the whole world by your side
We can skydive
