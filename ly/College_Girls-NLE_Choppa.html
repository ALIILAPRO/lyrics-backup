		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Pipe that shit up, TnT (overthink tomorrow when we're alright)
That's when we forget just who we are (we know)
Make us come together and we're alright (somewhere in the world there's a girl that's studying for exams)
That's when you remember who you are are
(Trill got that juice, nigga)

College girls have more fun
She studies during the day but when the day come she be on one
Chapel Hill to Durham, I put my work down
At the Duke and UNC game
Armado had a double, double
Off the court I had double trouble
I had two hoes, we both stat sheet stuffers
Telling Nia and Avi I love 'em
Ain't one college girl I'll put above 'em
Having conversations 'bout they last semester
On shrooms and edibles, dorm room to hotel rooms
Spend-a-night bags, Polaroid pictures in the bedroom
Looking like graduation pics

Flicks after flicks, watching both of 'em kiss
They say I do this for every bitch, but that ain't so
A lie, don't care who tell it what they told me
I responded you, ain't the judge or the police
What I gotta a lie for?
They focused on me, but got exams coming up (yeah)
I'm focused on them and I got shows lined up (yeah)
Lsu tomorrow, Angel Reese and Flaujae
Telling me they can't wait 'til I hit the stage (listen)
Telling them to bring they championship rings
It's a celebration, I'll bring the champagne
After party at the Dead Poet
College girls have more fun (yes, indeed)

College girls have more fun (fun)
College girls have more fun (fun)
College girls have more fun (more fun)
College girls have more fun

Courtside watching LeBron
Asking Rich Paul what if he played college ball
Where he would've went?
Would he had been one and done?
When he entered the draft would he had been number one?
Lot of ifs and would'ves (would'ves)
Shoulds and could'ves (could'ves)
Dos and don'ts (don'ts)
Lot of needs and wants (wants)
Lot of back and forth (forth)
High school dropout so college girls, I enjoy 'em (I enjoy 'em)
(More fun)

You ain't gotta strip for your tuition
What your major is?
I'll invest in your vision
Full ride scholarships, she riding me like a new whip
Student loans you ain't gotta pay that shit, I'm taking care of it
She go to school far away from home
Can only reach her by phone
A fresh start what she want
She wanna make new friends
And I bought her a new Benz
So she cruise the campus with a chip by her chin
School stressing her out, so I be stretching her out
Relieve the tension, fly her out
Change her whole scenery for the weekend (weekend)
Friday nights be her favorite nights
'Cause she know by Sunday night we coast to coast
When spring break hit we be on a boat making a toast
That she graduate from life after she graduate from school

College girls have more fun
College girls have more fun
College girls have more
College girls have more fun
They focused on me, but got exams coming up
I'm focused on them and I got shows lined up
College girls have more fun
College girls have more fun
College girls have more fun
College girls have more (have more)
College girls have more fun

(More fun)
(College girls have more fun, more)
(College girls have more fun)

(Overthink tomorrow when we're alright)
(That's when we forget just who we are)
(Make us come together and we're alright)
(That's when you remember who you are are)
