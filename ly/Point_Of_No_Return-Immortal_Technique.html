		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is the point of no return, I could never go back
Life without parole, up state shackled and trapped
Living in the hole, lookin' at the world through a crack
But fuck that, I'd rather shoot it out and get clapped
I've gone too far, there ain't no coming back for me
Auschwitz gas chamber full of Zyklon-B
Just like the Spanish exterminating Tainos
Raping the black and Indian women, creating Latinos
Mother fuckers made me out of self righteous hatred
And you got yourself a virus, stuck in the Matrix
A suicide bomber strapped and ready to blow
Lethal injection strapped down ready to go
Don't you understand they'll never let me live out in peace
Concrete jungle, guerrilla war out in the streets
Nat Turner with the sickle pitch fork and machete
The end of the world, mother fucker you not ready
This is the point of no return and nobody can stop it
Malcolm Little when he knelt before Elijah Muhammad
The comet that killed the dinosaurs, changing the earth
They love to criticize, they always say I change for the worse
Like prescription pills, when you misusin' them nigga
The Templar Knights when they took Jerusalem nigga
And figured out what was buried under Solomon's temple
Al-Aqsa the name is not coincidental
I know too much, the government is trying to murder me
No coming back like cutting your wrists open vertically
How could the serpent be purposely put in charge of the country
Genetic engineered sickness spread amongst me
My people are so hungry that they attack without reason
Like a fuckin' dog ripping off the hand that feeds him
Immortal Technique is treason to the Patriot Act
So come and get me motherfucker cause I'm not coming back

This is the point from which I could never return
And if I back down now then forever I burn
This is the point from which I could never retreat
'Cause If I turn back now there can never be peace
This is the point from which I will die and succeed
Living the struggle, I know I'm alive when I bleed
From now on it can never be the same as before
'Cause the place I'm from doesn't exist anymore

This is the point of no return nigga you better believe this
Mary Magdalene giving birth to the children of Jesus
The evolution of the world, bloody and dramatic
Human beings killing monkeys to conquer the planet
The kingdoms of Africa and Mesopotamia
Machine gunnin' your body with depleted uranium
This is the age of microchips and titanium
The dark side of the moon and contact with aliens
I started out like Australians, criminal minded
Broke into Hell, tore it down, and built a city behind it
Southpaw, murderous methodology nigga
Remember that I'm just a man, don't follow me nigga
'Cause once you past the point you can never go home
You've got to face the possibility of dying alone
So tell me motherfucker, how could you die for the throne
When you don't even got the fuckin' heart to die for your own
It rains acid, one day the earth will cry from a stone
And you'll be lookin' at the world livin' inside of a dome
Computerized humanity living inside of a clone
This is the place where the unknown is living and real
Wormwood to Planet X and the Seventh Seal
Universal truth is not measured in mass appeal
This is the last time that I kneel and pray to the sky
'Cause almost everything that I was always ever told was a lie

This is the point from which I could never return
And if I back down now then forever I burn
This is the point from which I could never retreat
'Cause If I turn back now there can never be peace
This is the point from which I will die and succeed
Living the struggle, I know I'm alive when I bleed
From now on it can never be the same as before
'Cause the place I'm from doesn't exist anymore
