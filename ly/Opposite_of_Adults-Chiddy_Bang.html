		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Aye yo I once was a kid all I had was a dream
Mo' money mo' problems, when I get it I'm a pile it up
Yeah I'm dope wonder bread we can toast
So fresh how we flow, everybody get their style from us
I once was a kid with the other little kids
Now I'm whippin' up shows and 'em fans goin' wild with us
Tell mommy I'm sorry
This life is a party

Remember you was a kid
Reminisce days of the innocence
Now it's Chiddy Bang, Google me in the images
Follow me, follow me I'm the leader
And when I park cars I don't pay for the meter
I remember I was younger as a kid it was the best
I used touch on all the pretty girls at recess
I'm at my peak yes, I won't leave yet
Serial style, cereal aisle need Chex
I can make these rappers run like a hard drill
Rock band show you how the guitar feel
And I could care less how y'all feel
I got the flow to make a bitch do a cartwheel
This is that good just puff it and relax bro
And you can get it free don't worry 'bout the tax though
And Xaphoone, thank you for the crack
But I play a Ron Bergundy I anchor on the track like that

Aye yo I once was a kid all I had was a dream
Mo' money no problems, when I get it I'm a pile it up
Now I'm dope wonder bread we can toast
So fresh how we flow, everybody get their style from us
I once was a kid with the other little kids
Now I'm whippin' up shows and 'em fans goin' wild with us
Tell mommy I'm sorry
This life is a party
I'm never growing up

Can I please get a little bit of knowledge
Somebody tell Roth that I don't love college
'Cause the real world's kinda like Real World
And it's drama so you are Svetlana and I'm just a rhymer
Swimmin' in the water tryin' to dodge the piranhas and fly to Bahamas
Pretty little momma, Chiddy in the spot
Where you at pretty lady show me what you got
They say why you rappin' for the kids for
I said my clothes come fitted, the Lids store
This summer you can catch me on a big tour
I'm high grade, I think they need to quiz more
Let me get wit' ya, don't let the kid hit ya
I'm the photo album Valletta has, big picture
The rule is, the dude is, so up, so chuck I'm a cool kid

Aye yo I once was a kid all I had was a dream
Mo' money mo' problems, when I get it I'm a pile it up
Now 'm dope wonder mm bread we can toast
So fresh how we flow, everybody get their style from us
I once was a kid with the other little kids
Now I'm whippin' up shows and 'em fans goin' wild with us
Tell mommy I'm sorry
This life is a party
I'm never growing up

Aye I once was a kid all I had was a dream
Mo' money mo' problems, when I get it I'm a pile it up
Yeah I'm dope wonderbread we can toast
So fresh how we flow, everybody get their style from us
I once was a kid with the other little kids
Now I'm whippin' up shows and 'em fans goin' wild with us
Tell mommy I'm sorry
This life is a party
I'm never growing up
