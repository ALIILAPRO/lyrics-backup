		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Who do you love?
Let it roll off your tongue
Who do you love?
When it all falls down
Crying for help
But you don't pick up your phone
Probably drunk

You couldn't stop, couldn't stop, couldn't realize
And are your enemies real in your real life?
I could stay up with you, up with you, all night
I wanna know how you feel on the inside

We got a long way
We got a long way to go

You're what I want (you're what I want)
I'm in a desperate way
Filling my cup (filling my cup)
Pretend it's all okay
Watch me above (watch me above)
Flickering like a flame
One ain't enough (it's never enough)

I think I could stop, I could stop, don't you realize?
That all my demons and fears disappear now
When you stay up with me, up with me, all night
I wanna show you my scars in the daylight

We got a long way
We got a long way to go
And those heavy hours they move so slow
We got a long way
We got a long way to go

Laying there, shaking hard
Sweatin' bullets in the dark

Always say, it ends the same
You never try, you never change, do you?
Oh

We got a long way
We got a long way to go
When the feeling comes the pain dies slow
We got a long way
We got a long way to go
And those heavy hours they move so slow

We got a long way
We got a long way to go
Don't hold me down or tie me up
(We got a long way) we got
(We got a long way to go) we gotta go

We got a long way, (we got a long way) 
We got a long way to to go (we got a long way)
(We got a long way)
We got a long way, we got a long way to go
