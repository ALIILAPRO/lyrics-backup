		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  Baby, that ain't an upgrade
No way in hell, but you try, babe
That bitch is crazy
And you're gon' have some ugly-ass babies
If you think that's an upgrade
You must be out of your mind, babe
You must be crazy
If you think you could ever replace me

Oh my God, I can't believe you fell for a fake now
I know that bitch, she's on my dick, been tryna take my place now
One step in my stilettos, she gon' fall right on her face
Oh, she like the dirt 'cause she been diggin' her own grave
Under the lies to you callin'
And I give you truce like you's comin'
But you had one too many gin and tonics
Hope he got you what the fuck you wanted

Baby, that ain't an upgrade
No way in hell, but you try, babe
That bitch is crazy
And you're gon' have some ugly-ass babies
If you think that's an upgrade
You must be out of your mind, babe
You must be crazy
If you think you could ever replace me

Sayin' fuckin' with this but you're fuckin' with that
Got your bitch all on my tits 'cause she wants what I have
She can have what I have, she can go through all my trash
'Cause I'm over it, yeah
I don't want you back

Baby, that ain't an upgrade
No way in hell, but you try, babe
That bitch is crazy
And you're gon' have some ugly-ass babies
If you think that's an upgrade
You must be out of your mind, babe
You must be crazy
If you think you could ever replace me

Yeah
Yeah
Baby, that ain't an upgrade
