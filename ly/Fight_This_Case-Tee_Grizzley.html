		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If them people say "Not guilty", I won
I gotta fight this case, baby (gotta fight this shit)
I don't know what they gon' do to me (it's looking good though)
I know you can't be there physically (know you can't be right there)
But I can I call on you mentally? (That's all I need)

I gotta fight this case, baby (gotta fight this shit)
I don't know what they gon' do to me (I don't know how it's looking)
I know you can't be there physically (know you can't be right there)
But I can I call on you mentally? (That's all I need, man)
Can I? Can I count on you to ride? (Can I count on you?)
Hold me down 'til I get back outside (hold a nigga down, man)
Come visit me, take a couple hour drive (drive up here)
Help me get this situation off my mind, 'cause I (I need it)

How I get in this position? Doin' what I gotta do
You get abandoned when you locked, so you know all I got is you
Out on bond, police watchin' me, I still got a tool
I ain't tryna crash out but this just how I gotta move
I just need you to stick to the code for me (stick to the code for me)
Can you put some money on the phone for me? (Pick up that phone for me)
Get a couple dollars from the bros for me (call my bro'nem)
When it's all over, I got you, don't worry (you know I got you)

I gotta fight this case, baby (fight this shit)
I don't know what they gon' do to me (it's looking good though)
I know you can't be there physically
But I can I call on you mentally? (That's all I need, baby)
Can I? Can I count on you to ride? (Can I count on you?)
Hold me down 'til I get back outside (you gon' hold me down though)
Come visit me, take a couple hour drive (know you can't be right there)
Help me get this situation off my mind, 'cause I (that's all I need)

How the fuck I get here? (How the fuck?)
Thought they was gangsta, now they tellin', shit weird
Niggas catchin' petty cases, cryin' over thirty days
I know niggas fightin' bodies, they prayin' for ten years (ten'll be low)
Just tryna make it out the slums
If you witness shit, be ready for them cases when they come 
(Them bitches comin')
The wrong nigga write a statement then we done (damn)
Fuck my record, if I get probation, I won (I beat it)

I need you to stick to the code (stick to the code for me)
Can you put some money on the phone? (Pick up that phone for me)
Get a couple dollars from the bros for me
When it's all over, I got you, don't worry (soon as I'm out this bitch)

I gotta fight this case, baby (fightin')
I don't know what they gon' do to me (not guilty)
I know you can't be there physically (I know you can't)
But I can I call on you mentally?
Can I? Can I count on you to ride? (Can I count on you?)
Hold me down 'til I get back outside
Come visit me, take a couple hour drive
Help me get this situation off my mind

Yeah, I just got back from court, from trial and shit
People said "Not guilty", I'll be out this bitch in a couple, man
Meet me out front, have my motherfuckin' jewelry ready
It's time to pop out
