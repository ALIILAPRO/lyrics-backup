		  Chorus
My mumma told me less is more
I don’t have much guess I got it all
Rumour has it if it glitters its gold
If it glitters its gold 
but if it glitters its gone 

First verse 
More a less less is more
lesson taught love you mumma (praise the lord)
break the law knock knockin on satans door
what the hell do you take me for
demon child with an evil smile 
but you love it tho 
mr constable leave your guns at home
you don’t wanna see me out of my comfort zone no no 

pre chorus
they sayyin Dally da kid man how you do em like that
you must be someone important the way the hood got your back
they looking up for the plug so i throw them the bag
and they get white girl white girl white girl white girl wasted like that
and it goes 

Chorus
My mumma told me less is more
I don’t have much guess I got it all
Rumour has it if it glitters its gold
If it glitters its gold 
but if it glitters its gone 

Verse 2
oh you got pen pal I got pals in the pen got pals in the pen
since the age of ten with a face like them with a face like them 
not my fault that I fit the role or I got involved 
because im fit to go then we hit the road with the things we stole
when the po po knock brother I don’t know 

Pre chorus
they sayyin dally da kid man how you do em like that
you must be someone important the way the hood got your back
they looking up for the plug so i throw them the bag
and they get white girl white girl white girl white girl wasted like that
and it goes 

Chorus
My mumma told me less is more
I don’t have much guess I got it all
Rumour has it if it glitters its gold
If it glitters its gold 
but if it glitters its gone 

Verse 3
if words are weapons i'm an AK47 
bullets fly in your direction sending emcees up to heaven
and if heaven don’t exept them and you in hell unexpected 
and the gate keeper got problems 
tell the gate keeper who sent em

Chorus
My mumma told me less is more
I don’t have much guess I got it all
Rumour has it if it glitters its gold
If it glitters its gold 
but if it glitters its gone
