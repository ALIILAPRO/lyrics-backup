		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Big boy showing off all around the city
Still the same for such a suit, thinking you're so bad
Hustlin' girls, handy phone, acting you're so busy
Baby, let me tell you, you're the worst I ever had

Superfly, superfly
Superfly slick dick
Superfly, superfly
Superfly slick dick

Superfly, superfly
Superfly slick dick
Superfly, superfly
Superfly slick dick

Highbrow attitude, really don't impress me
I know where you coming from, see right through your game
Luxury overdose won't make you possess me
Baby, let me tell you, in the end, it's all the same

Don't think I'm crying and trying to get you out of my heart
No need denying that you have been lying right from the start
I thought this love would take us to the heights of sensuality
But now I know that you're not even half the man you said you'd be

Don't think I'm crying and trying to get you out of my heart
No need denying that you have been lying right from the start
I thought this love would take us to the heights of sensuality
But now I know that you're not even half the man you said you'd be

Superfly, superfly 
Superfly slick dick
Superfly, superfly
Superfly slick dick

Superfly, superfly
Superfly slick dick
Superfly, superfly
Superfly slick dick

Superfly, superfly
Superfly slick dick
Superfly, superfly
Superfly slick dick
