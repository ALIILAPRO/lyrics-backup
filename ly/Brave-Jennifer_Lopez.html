		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's a new day
New day and it's evident
You must've been heaven sent
Something we should be hesitant

But I'm not at all
Just feeling more confident
Just using my common sense
Just trusting that I'm loving it

I can't refuse an offer, so benevolent
Can't assume he's gonna use me
And after him, never call again

Don't be afraid
Don't be afraid
This is your day
This is your day

It's time to be brave, say I'm not afraid
Not anymore, I used to be calm
Now the temperature's changed
It just ain't the same

I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
'Cause I've become brave as the light of day
Straight into a cave to show me the way
That I might be saved
Now I'm turning the page

Thanks to the power of love
I can love because I am brave
I am brave
I am brave, yeah
Ooh, ooh

I heard him say
This thing movin' too fast for him
It's a feeling that I'm straddling
Foolishly adamant

But it's all in his eyes
Really wish he would let me in
'Cause the same way you scared of him
He's scared of bein' hurt again

It's time to let go
Let go of your heart
It's time for a brand new start
Never know we might never part

Baby, don't be afraid
Don't be afraid
This is your day
This is your day

It's time to be brave, say I'm not afraid
Not anymore, I used to be calm
Now the temperature's changed
It just ain't the same

I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
'Cause I've become brave as the light of day
Straight into a cave to show me the way
That I might be saved
Now I'm turning the page

Thanks to the power of love
I can love because I am brave

I wouldn't take back
Anything that I've gone through
Now I pray for strength
For anything that I'm gonna do

Whether joy or it's pain
I'm still okay
I'm gonna be all right 'cause I'm not afraid

No, I am brave, say I'm not afraid
Not anymore (not anymore)
I used to be calm (used to be calm)
Now the temperature's changed
It just ain't the same

I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
'Cause I've become brave as the light of day
Straight into a cave 
To show me the way (show me the way)
That I might be saved
Now I'm turning the page

Thanks to the power of love
I can love because I am brave

Yeah
I am brave
