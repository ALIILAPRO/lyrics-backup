		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How are you now?
I got a drink at the bar where we used to go
It made me think of you
When we would talk and just talk 'til the sky turned blue

Say that everything will be alright
I know I'll have to give
All the things that I never did
If only you could understand 
Just take hold of my hand 
I will never let go 

It might be way too late
Your goodbye still burns like yesterday 
Have you found someone? 
Who makes you feel it was right there all along 

Say that everything will be alright 
I know I'll have to give 
All the things that I never did
If only you could understand 
Just take hold of my hand 
I will never let go

Ha, ha, ha, ha
Ha, ha, ha
Ha, ha
Ha, ha, ha
Ha, ha, ha, ha
Ha, ha, ha

Say that everything will be alright 
I know I'll have to give 
All the things that I never did
If only you could understand 
Just take hold of my hand 
I will never let go

How are you now?
Sometimes I wonder if you still think of me
Hold me for a while 
And say that everything will be alright
