		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Couldn't fall asleep all night
I tried with all my might
I thought I knew what you want

It isn't all that nice
But I guess it will suffice
It's hard to know what you want

Could you be
A little less sour? 
We're rottin' by the hour
And my heart's rotten too
And every film I watch 
I'm on the side of the bad guy

So turn around and show me that I'm better
Some people got an apple 
Some people got a tangerine
Look around and all I see 
Is people happy with what they're given
Life is pretty sweet, I'm told
I guess I'm shit outta luck 
Growin' a lemon tree
I'm gonna burn it down 
And grow me somethin' better, yeah, yeah

Blood on my hands, I'm on the fence 
I double down
I swing and I miss, a kick in the ribs 
In trouble now
Came from the dirt, back in the ground 
When I die
But I'ma survive, I got my own ways, oh-oh

Could you be
A little less sour? 
We're rottin' by the hour
And my heart's rotten too
And every film I watch 
I'm on the side of the bad guy

So turn around and show me that I'm better
Some people got an apple (some people got)
Some people got a tangerine (some people got a tangerine, oh-oh, yeah, yeah)
Look around and all I see
Is people happy with what they're given
Life is pretty sweet, I'm told (I'm told)
I guess I'm shit outta luck 
Growin' a lemon tree (growin' a lemon tree)
I'm gonna burn it down 
And grow me somethin' better, yeah, yeah

(And grow me somethin' better)
(And grow me somethin' better)
(And grow me somethin' better)
