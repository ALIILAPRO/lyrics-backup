		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You rip my shirt off into pieces
'Cause it no longer feels like home
All of our pictures are deleted
Just like my number off your phone

And I know that I took your heart
And tore it apart, I do

Yeah, I know that I did you wrong
Wish I'd make it up to you

But I can't give back your love
There's no way to rip it off
Oh, I'm sorry, baby, I
Didn't mean to make you cry
But I can't give back your love
No, I can't give back your love

Hmm, hmm, hmm
Hmm, hmm, hmm

I've never meant to leave you speechless
I never thought that's how we'd go
Oh, how I wish you would believe me
But even if it hurts, I know

That I can't give back your love
There's no way to rip it off
Oh, I'm sorry, baby, I
Didn't mean to make you cry
But I can't give back your love
No, I can't give back your love (ohh)

Hmm, hmm, hmm (ooh)
Hmm, hmm, hmm (ooh)

No, I can't give back your love
There's no way to rip it off
Oh, I'm sorry, baby, I
Didn't mean to make you cry
But I can't give back your love
No, I can't give back your love
