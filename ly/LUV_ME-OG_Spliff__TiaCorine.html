		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  OGS got the juice
I feel like Pac with the deuce
You gone love me
Who gone love me
Streets don't love you like the say they really want your juice
Mama tried to tell me but she raised another fool
You said we was gang but then you switched I cut you loose
I cut you loose
Streets don't love you like the say they really want your juice
Mama tried to tell me but she raised another fool
You said we was gang but then you switched I cut you loose
I cut you loose
I need a rich bitch
Yellow Black Beatrix
Kill Bill scenic shit
Louis Bag who it is
That boy hit another lick
Dreaming bout a vision where we came up off another
O.P.P like that's my brother
If he hit a stain with me
I know the code like don't you play with me
But you ain't stay with me
I had nightmares where they sprayed and put the case on me
I roll two straight to the face cause that shit really prey on me
I know ain't nobody pray for me but that's okay with me
I got new light
What it look like
No smoke No sprite
Brazy right right
Lazy for like
So long an outlet with no plug in yo
Let's go
Streets don't love you like the say they really want your juice
Mama tried to tell me but she raised another fool
You said we was gang but then you switched I cut you loose
I cut you loose
How you buck you ain't got no bucks
You ran outta luck
Boy you suck
I just cut you off
I just had enough cold cut
Yeah you know wassup
Baby boy that's tough
So what
I be throwing fits
They be telling me to grow up
Say I fell off but they paying me to show up
I'm not daisy but he begging me to push up
Boy you lazy you ain't got no money shut up
You can't play me this ain't fisher price don't kid yourself
My enemy I know you got no love
I be giving you my energy but how that's not enough
I be spending all my cash on you I know you saving up
You the same nigga wanna claim that I don't give a fuck
I can't blame niggas they ain't really never met the one
I can't save niggas you can call me we can have some fun
But after that you can trip I'm not your apple cinnamon
Get back fuck you take a nap and then I gotta run
