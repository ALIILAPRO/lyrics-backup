		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Like, grrah
Like, like

Spinnin' through, tryna catch me a roller 
Oh, he lackin'? Run him over
Fuck the Sev' block 
I'm the owner, I'm smokin' on dead opps, ain't no floaters
He tryna run but I click and it's over
Oh, he with his kid? Then I'm kickin' his shoulder
Fuck a drive-by, I'ma get closer
Dougie got shot now he shakin' his shoulders

Smokin' I'm smokin' on Notti, y'all feds
Ayy, yo, DD, you next 
When I bend through the Hill, bitch, I'm lookin' for wreck
Like, like I'ma leave that lil' boy in his neck
Fuck Bobby, that nigga died on the steps
And fuck Dotti, he put himself right to rest
EDot got put right to bed, like
He shot his self in his head
How y'all smokin' on niggas y'all don't even know?
Now it's cool, oh my God, we smokin' y'all bros
And tell Nas to pick up the phone, that-that's a no
Spin through the Sev' tryna catch him and go
Like, I-I try to up it and blow
He can't run once I shoot through the coat
He-he gon' die once he mention my bro
I can't love on no thot, I can't link with no thot
Like, I-I ain't trust none of that shit
Like, I don't care about none of that shit
Like, give a fuck 'bout none of that shit, like we-
He really rap what he not
I'm tryna shoot 'til he drop
If he thinkin' it's sweet, I'ma knock off his top
When I spin through the Sev', I'ma dump every shot

Spinnin' through, try catch me a roller 
Oh, he lackin'? Run him over
Fuck the Sev' block 
I'm the owner, I'm smokin' on dead opps, ain't no floaters
He tryna run but I click and it's over
Oh, he with his kid? Then I'm kickin' his shoulder
Fuck a drive-by, I'ma get closer
Dougie got shot now he shakin' his shoulders
