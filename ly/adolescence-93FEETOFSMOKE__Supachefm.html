		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah, yeah oh, whoa, yeah, yeah, oh

Feel like I'm running out of chances, still
Wish it all would fade to black
I know I'ma tell you too much
And have a heart attack
I'm just tryna filter pain
You just want a follow back
Now we both just doin' way too much
Watch behind my back instead of
Doin' all my drugs it's a very thin line of
Having fun and living rust
Forces are divine that always
Seem to conquer us, and
Push to the side
Like will I ever fall in love?

Figure me out, figure me out
I tried as well, and I'm finna tap out
Sometimes it rains and it pours and you pout
Just go put on the heater
Take a load off on the couch
Sometimes I feel conceited
I sing without a reason
Just wanna see a smile
Then I switch up like the seasons
The moon puts me in phases
Forget to tie my laces
I'm used to hiding secrets and
Forgetting where I placed 'em

I don't wanna lead you on
But you're forcing me away
Leaving things unsaid
Chasing at the dreams, while I count my bread
You know that everything was meant
It's battle tested
Long invested, bloodied the face now
Onto the necklace
Forcing me away, leaving things unsaid
I thought that you meant it

It's harder to jump, with heart in your lungs
Like crumpled up bit's that I
Will put in a blunt
I ration it out like, like I'm stuck in a rut
My files are messy, but yours are corrupt
I bargain with boys that just
Help me lose touch and tell me that silence
Ain't worth giving up
I'd tell you the same if you'd ever wake up
(I'll tell you the same if you ever wake up)
Blame it on my heart, so cold, adolescence
Busy gettin' high, one more time
Out of breath
I'ma let you slide, play it cool
'til I'm desperate
Hit me one more time, hit me one more time
Blame it on my heart, so cold, adolescence
Busy gettin' high, one more time
Out of breath
I'ma let you slide, play it cool
'til I'm desperate
Hit me one more time, hit me one more time
Yeah

I could say it all, but I don't want to
I could say it all, but I don't want to
