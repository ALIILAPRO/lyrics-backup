		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yes, yeah

Suffering for the lord is not an easy thing
Be it a conjuring
So ordained and adored, so immaculate
Ooh, so worth the debt

I'm your rock, baby
I won't back down
I'm your rock, baby
Ask yourself, ooh
Are you righteous? Yes
You wanna play with the sire? Yes
You want a view from the spire? Yes
You want a seat by the pyre?
And never ever suffer again? Yes, yeah, yeah

Sacrifice for the whore leads the way from shame
Be it a loser's game
The disdained and abhorred lash of the senate whip
Ooh, it's a power trip

I'm your rock, baby
I won't back down
I'm your rock, baby
Ask yourself, ooh
Are you righteous? Yes
You want to play with the sire? Yes
You want a view from the spire? Yes
You want a seat by the pyre
And never ever suffer again? Yes
You want to console the griever? Yes
You want to guide the believer? Yes
You are the greatest deceiver
And never ever suffer again

Holy mother, you washeth the sin from my feet
Holy mother
You shine like the sun and the moon and the stars in the sky
Holy mother, you washeth the sin from my feet (mother)
Holy mother
You shine like the sun and the moon and the stars in the sky
Holy mother, the world has set me on your shoulders (holy)
Holy mother
You shine like the sun and the moon and the stars in the sky

I'm your rock, baby
I won't back down
I'm your rock, baby
Ask yourself
Are you righteous? Yes
You want to play with the sire? Yes
You want a view from the spire? Yes
You want a seat by the pyre?
And never ever suffer again (never ever suffer again)
Never ever suffer again
You want to play with the sire? Yes
You want a view from the spire? Yes
You want a seat by the pyre?
And never ever suffer again, yeah

You want to console the griever
You want to guide the believer
You are the greatest deceiver
And never ever suffer again
