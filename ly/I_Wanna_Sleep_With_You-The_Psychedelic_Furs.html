		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She comes in like an angel,
And goes down like these flats.
I don't know why she does all this.
It's making her see that
I don't want you always,
And I won't hold your hand.
I won't give you flowers,
I just want to sleep with you.
I just want to sleep with you.
I just want to sleep with you.
I got my own morals,
You've got your own too.
Lovers will just steal your clothes,
But I'm not one of them.
Forgive me.
I just didn't want to run away with you.
There's romance, or so she says.
I want to sleep with you.
I just want to sleep with you.
I just want to sleep with you.
I want to sleep with you.
I didn't want to fade in you.
I make my own scenes.
These go-go girls are happening.
They're just like accidents.
He's got sunglasses, electric shoes,
This vicious dog, and I shake.
A uniform in black and blue,
He wants to be your guard.
I just want to sleep with you.
I just want to sleep with you, now.
