		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She's just sixteen years old
Leave her alone, they say
Separated by fools
Who don't know what love is yet
But I want you to know

If I could fly
I'd pick you up
I'd take you into the night
And show you a love
Like you've never seen, ever seen

It's like having a dream
Where nobody has a heart
It's like having it all
And watching it fall apart
And I would wait till the end of time for you
And do it again, it's true
I can't measure my love
There's nothing to compare it to
But I want you to know

If I could fly
I'd pick you up
I'd take you into the night
And show you a love

Oh if I could fly
I'd pick you up
I'd take you into the night
And show you a love
Like you've never seen, ever seen

Oh if I could fly
I'd pick you up
I'd take you into the night
And show you a love

Oh if I could fly
I'd pick you up
And take you into the night

If I could fly
I'd pick you up
And into the night
Fly
I'd pick you up
