		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Learned it on the internet
Wheels turning in my head
Think back to what you said
And I turn red, I'm turning red

Wild thoughts that make me melt
A good hit below the belt
Sometimes I scare myself
But I can't help what I can't help

So shame on me and shame on you
I fantasize what we would do
And how would he taste and the way you move
Oh, some good girls do bad things too

I want this like a cigarette
Can we drag it out and never quit?
And oh my god, you are heaven sent
With your dirty mind, yeah, you're perverted
You give me guilty, guilty pleasure
You give me guilty, guilty pleasure

Feels like pornography watching you try on jeans
You're a pothead, you're a cinephile
It's been awhile since you turned up the dial

So shame on me (shame on me), shame on you (shame on you)
I fantasize what we would do (we would do)
And how would it taste, the way you move
Oh, some good girls do bad things too

I want this like a cigarette
Can we drag it out and never quit?
And oh my god, you are heaven sent
With your dirty mind, yeah, you're perverted
You give me guilty, guilty pleasure
You give me guilty, guilty pleasure

You give me guilty, guilty pleasure
You give me guilty, guilty pleasure
You give me guilty, guilty pleasure
You give me guilty, guilty pleasure
Pleasure, pleasure, pleasure
