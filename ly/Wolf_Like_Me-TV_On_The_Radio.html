		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Say, say, my playmate
Won't you lay hands on me
Mirror my malady
Transfer my tragedy?
Got a curse I cannot lift
Shines when the sunset shifts
When the moon is round and full
Gotta bust that box, gotta gut that fish (my mind's aflame)
We could jet in a stolen car
But I bet we wouldn't get too far
Before the transformation takes
And blood lust tanks and
Crave gets slaked

My mind has changed
My body's frame, but, God, I like it
My heart's aflame
My body's strained, but, God, I like it
My mind has changed
My body's frame, but, God, I like it
My heart's aflame
My body's strained, but, God, I like it

Charge me your day rate
I'll turn you out in kind
When the moon is round and full
Gonna teach you tricks
That will blow your mongrel mind
Baby doll, I recognize
You're a hideous thing inside
If ever there were a lucky kind
It's you, you, you, you

I know it's strange, another way to get to know you
You'll never know unless we go, so let me show you
I know it's strange, another way to get to know you
We've got 'til noon, here comes the moon
So let it show you
Show you now

Dream me, oh, dreamer
Down to the floor
Open my hands and let them weave onto yours
Feel me, completer
Down to my core
Open my heart and let it bleed onto yours
Feeding on fever
Down on all-fours
Show you what all the howling is for

Hey, hey, my playmate
Let me lay waste to thee
Burned down their hanging trees
It's hot, hot, hot, hot here
Got a curse we cannot lift
Shines when the sunset shifts
There's a curse comes with a kiss
The bite that binds, the gift that gives
Now that we got gone for good
Writhing under your riding hood
Tell your grandma and your mama too
It's true, true, true, true

We're howling forever, oh, oh
We're howling forever, oh, oh
We're howling forever, oh, oh
We're howling forever, oh, oh
We're howling forever, oh, oh
