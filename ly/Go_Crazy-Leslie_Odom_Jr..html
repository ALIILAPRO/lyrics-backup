		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ahh, hey!

She walk like a woman, she sexy and free
Something in her water's got a hold on me
She's destiny's daughter, I'm gaspin' for air
But you won't believe me, you just had to be there

Hi-de-hi-de-hi-de-ho (hi-de-hi-de-hi-de-ho)
I'm addicted to the flair
I can't, I can't let her go
Heaven help me, I'm so helpless
Think I'm losing my control
I'm so deep under her spell, oh well

I don't how she do what she do in the dark
I think she put a root, put a root on my heart
I can't leave her alone, yeah (oh)
She read me like them bones, yeah (oh)
She, she, she make me go crazy (crazy)
She make me go crazy (go crazy)

Oh, she speaks like sweet tea
Her hips sway like the wind through the tree leaves
Her kisses are like coffee flavored whiskey
I wanna take 'em in 'til I'm tipsy

Hi-de-hi-de-hi-de-ho (hi-de-hi-de-hi-de-ho)
I'm addicted to the flair
I can't, I can't let her go
Heaven help me, I'm so helpless
Think I'm losing my control
I'm so deep under her spell, oh well

I don't how she do what she do in the dark
I think she put a root, put a root on my heart
I can't leave her alone, yeah (oh)
She read me like them bones, yeah (oh)
She, she, she make me go crazy (oh, go crazy)
She make me go crazy (oh)

She brings me straight to my knees
That child, she's the sweetest indeed
She's making a fool outta me
Fire woman, you got me
Howling at the moon, if I don't see you soon
I be crawling to my room after her voodoo
I keep calling, trying to catch you
Getting stuck in her molasses
Or whatever she put in this magic

I don't how she do what she do in the dark
I think she put a root, put a root on my heart
Can't ever leave her alone, yeah (oh)
She readin' me like them bones, yeah (oh)
She, she, she make me go crazy (oh, go crazy)
She make me go crazy (oh, go crazy)
She, she, she make me go crazy (oh, go crazy)
She make me go crazy (oh, go crazy)

Brother, what is you doing to me, brother?
Where did you-
You think she driving me crazy?
You ain't seen crazy! 
Ahahahaha, hey
