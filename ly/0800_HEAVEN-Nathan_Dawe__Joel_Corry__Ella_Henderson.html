		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If Heaven had a phone line
Would I be the first one you would dial?
If Heaven had a phone line
Would you call me up from the other side?

If Heaven had a phone line
Would I be the first one you would dial?
If Heaven had a phone line
Would you call me up from the other side?

If Heaven had
If Heaven had (oh)

Tell me why
We don't talk anymore?
Since we said goodbye
I got no one left to adore

We had the baddest break-up and no chance to make up
If tomorrow you don't open your eyes
Would you say you love me, from the clouds above me?
Would you find a way to send me a sign?

If Heaven had a phone line
Would I be the first one you would dial?
If Heaven had a phone line
Would you call me up from the other side?
Would you say the things you wish you said that night?
Yeah, if we had a second try
If Heaven had a phone line
Would you call me up from the other side?

If Heaven had
If Heaven had (oh)

Would you say the things you wish you said that night? 
Yeah, if we had a second try
If Heaven had a phone line
Would you call me up from the other side?

If Heaven had

Call me back
Call me back
Call me back when you get this, okay?
I love you and I miss you so much
Okay, bye
