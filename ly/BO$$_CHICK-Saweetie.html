		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ayy, you already know what the fuck goin' on, man
It's Queen of the Bay Area, Sac' Town finest
Ayy, bow down when you see the queen, man, kiss the ring (Yeah)
Hey, Saweetie, talk to these motherfuckers (Uh-huh)

Let me tell you 'bout this chick
I'm from the West Coast
Light skin, baby hairs
I heard I do the most
I swear I'm so saditty
I can't be approached
If that bitch hella basic, then that bitch gotta go

Huh, what's that in my cup? That's that potion
Rubbin' hundreds on my skin like it's lotion
Sitting courtside with my loc and
Presidential Rolly on me like I'm votin'
Smellin' like a rich bitch, I'm too potent
I don't do the nosebleeds, I want floor seats (uh-huh)
I'm only fuckin' with a nigga that can coach me (yeah)
I wasn't raised by IG but the OGs (OGs)
If you miss the old me then you ain't know me, bitch
The Baccarat too trendy so I'm off it (bitch, I'm off it)
I hit the club and get some ones and then I toss it (I'ma toss it)
See, every problem for my family, I done solved it (I done solved it)
The pretty girls gon' here this shit and start a mosh pit

Boss shit, know you need a boss chick (boss chick)
Real niggas gon' pay what it cost quick (make it quick)
Long nails, only get the tall tips (tall tips)
That ain't MAC, girl, that's Icy on my lips (mwah)
Boss shit, know you need a boss chick (big boss)
Real niggas gon' pay what it cost quick (spend it)
Long nails, only get the tall tips (bling-bling)
That ain't MAC, girl, that's Icy on my lips

I ain't goin' nowhere, just embrace me, bitch
Always lurkin' on my page, you don't hate me, sis (that's right)
I ain't botherin' nobody, I just breathe and shit
Deep down in your heart, you wanna be like this
No, ho, we don't give a fuck about those like I'm D'Lo
Pretty Filipino from the Bay like I'm P-Lo, we know
Your pockets ain't bigger than your ego
I need a rich nigga like De Niro in Casino

Boss shit, know you need a boss chick (boss chick)
Real niggas gon' pay what it cost quick (make it quick)
Long nails, only get the tall tips (tall tips)
That ain't MAC, girl, that's Icy on my lips (ayy)
Boss shit, know you need a boss chick (big boss)
Real niggas gon' pay what it cost quick (spend it)
Long nails, only get the tall tips (bling-bling)
That ain't MAC, girl, that's Icy on my lips, ayy

510, stay down, ten white toes (ten white toes)
Pretty hoes pull up to my show (to my show)
916 always poppin' shit (poppin' shit)
Gettin' thick, pretty bitch, get rich
