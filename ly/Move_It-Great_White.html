		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sweet little sister
This scene's gettin' old
Don't you think it's time we got to go

I got so twisted
Tryin' to make it right
Don't you know we've wasted half the night

I was told to use my head
Be herd and never scene
It's Daddy's double talk
Don't mean nothing to me

Let's move it
Time to say so long
Let's move it
Let's get this mother on

Hey little sister
In your high heeled shoes
Don't you know it's time to learn the blues

Sweet little sister
Time to get it on
Don't you know the meanin' to this song

I recall what Daddy said
Stay where you belong
That's just an alibi

Let's get this baby on

Let's move it
Time to say so long
Let's move it
Let's get this mother on

It's just that double talk
Don't mean nothing to me
It's time to shake it loose
Shake it from the family tree
Let's move it
