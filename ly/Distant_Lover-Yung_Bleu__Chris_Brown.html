Sound

Maybe it's the clock tickin', I'm thinkin', I need you
Girl, you got my mind spinnin', I'm winnin' when I'm with you
My distant lover, got me comin' back in, got me comin', got me comin' back
My distant lover, got me comin' back again, got me comin', got me comin' back

Bleu, just hopped off the jet, I'm back again
Girl, let me tap that ass again
I'm in your city, send a pin
And she like, "Give me thirty minutes"
She's so far from me, my distant lover
And I get butterflies every time we kiss each other
We fuck when we miss each other
I ain't seen you all winter, let's have a freakin' summer
Don't be actin' funny, girl, you not Keke Palmer (yeah)
And you feel like I hate you but I know you still a monster
And it make my mind wonder

I see you in the mirror
I see you, lookin' back at yourself
You know the way to turn me on
All through the night, the break of dawn

Maybe it's the clock tickin', I'm thinkin', I need you (you, yeah)
Baby girl, you got my mind spinnin', I'm winnin' when I'm with you
My distant lover, got me comin' back in, got me comin', got me comin' back (oh, yeah)
My distant lover, you got me comin' back again, got me comin', got me comin' back

Oh just landed in London
I'm searchin' for luggage
I told her I came
She told me, "I'm comin'"
I say, I told her, "Get ready"
Leave the app for her and
Call the Uber XL, make sure it's black car service
And you thick on the 'Gram but you too thick in person
But I'm tired of DM's, come get this dick in person
And I'm tryna stay cool but you make a nigga nervous
You doin' that on purpose

'Cause I see you, I see you in the mirror
I see you, lookin' back at yourself
You know the way to turn me on
All through the night, the break of dawn

Maybe it's the clock tickin', I'm thinkin', I need you 
Baby girl, you got my mind spinnin', I'm winnin' when I'm with you
My distant lover, got me comin' back in, got me comin', got me comin' back (oh, yeah)
My distant lover, you got me comin' back again 
got me comin', got me comin' back (Comin' back)

Woah, oh
