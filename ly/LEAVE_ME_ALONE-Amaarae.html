		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Talking, talking, talk but talk is cheap
And I need favor from no one but god, plus I've got me
Talking, talking, talking, all the time
What else have you done for your niggas out the mud and your people's outside?

Too much energy being wasted, too much time
Too many enemies form friendship, flooding my lines up
You're fucking up my mental space, man
You're blowing my high
Too much energy being wasted, on business not mine

All the diamonds in the world don't outshine me
Every blessing's got a foe, so I don't sleep
Na, na, na, na, na
I want to be alone
I want you to just leave me alone
I want to be alone
Why don't you just leave me alone?

I'm tryna love you like a gangsta (gangsta)
Praying all my prayers 'til their answered (answered)
On my knees, and they still bleeding
Freeing enemies say they wan test me 'til my hands up
Asking god please
Asking god please
Why me? Why me? Why me?

Coz it's too much energy being wasted, too much time
Too many enemies form friendship, flooding my lines up
You're fucking up my mental space, man
You're blowing my high
Too much energy being wasted, on business not mine

All the diamonds in the world don't outshine me
Every blessing's got a foe, so I don't sleep
Na, na, na, na, na
I want to be alone
I want you to just leave me alone
I want to be alone
Why don't you just leave me alone?
