		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  First floor (uh-oh)
Room sixteen (uh-oh)
Smells like danger (let's go)
Even better (let's go)
Set your goals (uh-oh)
Bless our souls (uh-oh)
I'm in trouble (yes, I know)
But it feels like heaven (hey!)

You were like one of those guys
The kind with a wandering eye (hey!)
But I said, hey what the hell?
For once in my life I'll take a ride on the wild side

You were so full of yourself
But damn, were you cute, as well (hey!)
You liked my legs, I liked your moves
Anyone could tell that it's hard to deny that

I did it again now
I've got it all wrong
But it felt so right
I can't believe it
No more mistakes that
Went on for too long
Wish there was a way
I could delete 'em

Eh, eh, eh, eh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Eh, eh, eh, eh, uh, uh, uh, uh

Second night (uh-oh)
In a row (uh-oh)
Back in trouble (let's go)
I don't get it (let's go)

Gotta keep it down (uh-oh)
It'll all be cool (uh-oh)
If we ignore 'em (yes, I know)
Getting better (hey!)

When it comes to men, it's known
That I end up choosing wrong (hey!)
'Cause I always trip and fall
On the same old rock and repeat and go back

How blind a girl can be (ooh)
To miss you hide your ring (hey!)
But I bought everything
I'm so naive, and I'd like you to know that

I did it again now
I've got it all wrong
But it felt so right
I can't believe it
No more mistakes that
Went on for too long
Wish there was a way
I could delete 'em

Eh, eh, eh, eh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Eh, eh, eh, eh, uh, uh, uh, uh

It might seem to you that I am in a place
Where I'm losing the direction of my life
But I'm sure that this is nothing but a phase
Right back at ya, 'cause I'll survive

It might seem to you that I am in a place
Where I'm losing the direction of my life
But I'm sure that this is nothing but a phase
Right back at ya, 'cause I'll survive

I did it again now
I've got it all wrong
But it felt so right
I can't believe it
All the mistakes that
Went on for too long
Wish there was a way
I could delete 'em

I did it again now
I've got it all wrong

Eh, eh, eh, eh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Eh, eh, eh, eh, uh, uh, uh, uh
