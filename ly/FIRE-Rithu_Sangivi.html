		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do you always let everybody get the better of you
Let them think that you're invisible, nothing noticeable
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Puffing up like a pufferfish except never busting out
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Keeping all the things that you want to say, shut up in your mouth
Cause you're afraid, of what they'll say, if you show them who you are
Cause you think, that you don't deserve the spotlight but really you do
Cause you're on Fi-i-i-i-re, Fi-i-i-i-re , Fi-i-i-i-re
Cause you're on Fi-i-i-i-re ,Fi-i-i-i-re ,Fi-i-i-i-re
Cause you're on
Intrumental
Show them that though you're not made of stone
You're more than flesh and bone
That there is more to you, more than they'll ever know
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Puffing up like a pufferfish except never busting out
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Keeping all the things that you want to say, shut up in your mouth
Cause you're afraid, of what they'll say, if you show them who you are
Cause you think, that you don't deserve the spotlight but really you do
Cause you're on Fi-i-i-i-re, Fi-i-i-i-re , Fi-i-i-i-re
Cause you're on Fi-i-i-i-re ,Fi-i-i-i-re ,Fi-i-i-i-re
Cause you're on
Fi-i-i-i-re, Fi-i-i-i-re , Fi-i-i-i-re
Cause you're on Fi-i-i-i-re, Fi-i-i-i-re , Fi-i-i-i-re
Cause you're on
Instrumental
Cause you're on FIRE
