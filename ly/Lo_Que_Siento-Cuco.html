		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dreaming of you when I'm alone
Baby don't trip, I'm coming home
Kick it with me, I don't care if the sun is gone
Baby don't cry when I am gone
Promise you are everything I want
This is for you, baby, listen, it's your song

Oye cariño, solo pienso en ti
When I wake up in the morning until I go back to sleep
How I wish you were mine, I think of you all the time
I always feel like I'm flying, baby, you make me feel fine

Lost in the words that you say to me
Y pasando tiempo juntos is the ultimate dream
I'm on the top of the world, baby girl can't you see
I found my perfect girl, I want to make you my queen
Time and time again I can be feeling real sad
'Cause mi sueño no se ha hecho una realidad
Pero el tiempo dirá, el tiempo dirá
If we go spend our lives together en lo que el mundo gira

I promise I don't want nobody else to be around me but you
And nobody's touch and nobody's lips can make me feel like yours do
Our hands in a lock, nuestros labios se conocen
Nuestra noche es corta pero hermosa, we'll be okay

Dreaming of you when I'm alone
Baby don't trip, I'm coming home
Kick it with me, I don't care if the sun is gone
Baby don't cry when I am gone
Promise you are everything I want
This is for you, baby, listen, it's your song

Sin ti mis días son largos y se sienten tan amargos
Me ahogo en un lago de mis lágrimas, ¿qué hago?
Can't look forward to my future if it ain't including you
Promise that I'm gonna love you, it's about that time you do
I swear I don't see nothing but I love to lay here with you
And I hope you know I miss you
From my head I can't dismiss you
Eres lo que yo anhelaba en esta vida, ¿qué me falta?
Lo que siento is surreal, I can't lie to you for real

Sabes bien que te quiero
And if you're down to spend your summer with me, just let me know
You know you're my sueño
You came to my life and now I feel alright

Dreaming of you when I'm alone
Baby don't trip, I'm coming home
Kick it with me, I don't care if the sun is gone
Baby don't cry when I am gone
Promise you are everything I want
This is for you, baby, listen, it's your song

Dreaming of you when I'm alone
Baby don't trip I'm coming home
Kick it with me, I don't care if the sun is gone
Baby don't cry when I am gone
Promise you are everything I want
This is for you, baby, listen, it's your song
