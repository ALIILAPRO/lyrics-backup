		  Education, fornication, in you are, go
Education, subjugation, now you're out, go
Education, fornication, in you are, go
Don't be late for school again, boy

I think me, I want a house and a wife
I wanna shimmy-shimmy-shimmy
Through the break of dawn, yeah

Education, fornication, in you are, go
Education, subjugation, now you're out, go
Education, fornication, in you are, go
Don't be late for school again, girl

I think me, I want a house and a wife
I wanna shimmy-shimmy-shimmy
Through the break of dawn, yeah

I think me, I want a life
I think me, I want a house and a wife
I wanna shimmy-shimmy-shimmy
Through the break of dawn, yeah

Don't be late for school again, boy
Don't be late for school again, you
