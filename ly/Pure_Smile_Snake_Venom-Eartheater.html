		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Pure smile, snake venom, the origin of the grin
It goes way back, after the reptiles
You fucked up but I see more than that
I could rip you to shreds but I choose not to
So I bear my fangs just to let you know
That I like you

Gonna bare these fangs
Gonna flash these pearly whites
'Cause I like you, I like you, I like you

I choose not to bite you
In spite of my venom welling up
Pure smile to soothe us into the future
Show me what you can do

Locking eyes is key to unlock the feeling
The feeling is seeping
The feeling is reeling
Let's rattle, rattle the cage, baby
Let's not engage in the stage malaise

I choose not to bite you
In spite of my venom welling up
Pure smile to soothe us into the future
Show me what you can do

I choose not to bite you
In spite of my venom welling up
Pure smile to soothe us into the future
Show me what you can do

So I bare my fangs, so I bare my fangs
So I bare my fangs, so I bare my fangs
So I bare my fangs, pure smile to soothe

So I bare my fangs, so I bare my fangs
So I bare my fangs, so I bare my fangs
So I bare my fangs, so I bare my fangs
So I bare my fangs, so I bare my fangs
