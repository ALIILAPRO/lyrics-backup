		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ain't this what you came for?
Don't you wish you came, oh
Girl, what you're playing for?
Come on, come on, let me kiss that
Ooh, I know you miss that
What's wrong? Let me fix that
Twist that

Baby, tonight's the night I let you know
Baby, tonight's the night we lose control
Baby, tonight, you need that, tonight, believe that
Tonight, I'll be the best you ever had

I don't wanna brag, but I'll be
The best you ever had

I don't wanna brag, but I'll be
The best you ever had

I hit you with the best throw
Freestyle and the breaststroke
Till you blowing cigarette smoke
And now the bad's gone
So what we gon' do now?
Fuck it, round two now
Work it out, then we cool down
Cool down

Baby, tonight's the night I let you know
Baby, tonight's the night we lose control
Baby, tonight, you need that, tonight, believe that
Tonight, I'll be the best you ever had

I don't wanna brag, but I'll be
The best you ever had

I don't wanna brag, but I'll be
The best you ever had

Luda', listen
You ain't even gotta text me
Knowing me and you got that mental telepathy
Me be up at the spot, I'll be sending over the chauffeur
Rich nigga bread, stay popping like a toaster
Nobody come close to me and you together
Step under my umbrella, we'll make it through any weather
Except when I make it storm, sex in the greatest form
And hibernate under my body
Yep, I keep it warmer than a chinchilla
She know I beat it up like the thriller in Manilla
Flying my private jet to villas in Anguilla
Then throw you on a grill
'Cause seven days a week, you're my five-course meal, for real

Baby, tonight's the night I let you know
Baby, tonight's the night we lose control
Baby, tonight, you need that, tonight, believe that
Tonight, I'll be the best you ever had

I don't wanna brag, but I'll be
The best you ever had

I don't wanna brag, but I'll be
The best you ever had
