		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fallen so far
Said you'd watch over my heart
Your love was so real
Too late to forget how you made me feel

Tell me what I was supposed to believe
Held me so close I could hardly breathe
And now I can't find how to let you go
You were mine but you've grown so cold

Say it's all in my head
I remember when you said
I'll never let you go
Held me in the dark
Sheltered as you took my heart
I could never let you go, ooh
Say it's all in my head
Remember when you said
I'll never let you go
Oh, hold me in the dark
Sheltered as you take my heart
Take my heart

Kiss me, pretend
Tell me all your love lies again
Cast your shadows
Like how you said you'd catch me but let me go

You said I could have been free if I wanted to
I know you could see I was lost in you
Said you'd let me be if I wanted you to
And I know you'll leave but I don't want you to

Say it's all in my head
I remember when you said
I'll never let you go
Held me in the dark
Sheltered as you took my heart
I could never let you go, ooh
Say it's all in my head
Remember when you said
I'll never let you go
Oh, hold me in the dark
Sheltered as you take my heart
Take my heart

So take my heart for your love
I'll let you break it, part every piece of me
So take my heart, it's all that's left
Take my heart

Say it's all in my head
I remember what you said
Hold me in the dark
Sheltered as you take my heart
Take my heart
