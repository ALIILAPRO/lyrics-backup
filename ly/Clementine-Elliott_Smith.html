		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They're waking you up to close the bar
The street's wet you can tell by the sound of the cars
The bartender's singing clementine
While he's turning around the open sign

Dreadful sorry clementine
Though you're still her man
It seems a long time gone
Maybe the whole thing's wrong

What if she thinks so but just didn't say so?
You drank yourself into slo-mo
Made an angel in the snow
Anything to pass the time

And keep that song out of yr mind
Oh my darling
Oh my darling
Oh my darling clementine

Dreadful sorry clementine
