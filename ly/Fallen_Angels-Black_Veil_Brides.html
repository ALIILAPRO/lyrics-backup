		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Scream, shout
Scream, shout
We are the fallen angels

We are the in between 
Cast down as sons of war
Struck to the earth like lightning 
On this world we're torn

We won't cause the pain of living out their law
Take joy in who you are
We know are wings are flawed

We're bored to death in heaven and all alone in hell
We only want to be ourselves

We scream (we scream), we shout (we shout)
We are the fallen angels
We scream (we scream), we shout (whoa, whoa)

To those who sing along
No need to feel the sorrow
We scream (we scream), we shout (whoa)
We are the fallen angels

Follow the morning star
A light when darkness fell
The passion left unholy
Now you found yourself
We have no where to go
No one to wish us well
A cry to find our home
Our stories they will tell

We're bored to death in heaven and all alone in hell
We only want to be ourselves

We scream (we scream), we shout (we shout)
We are the fallen angels
We scream (we scream), we shout (whoa, whoa)

To those who sing along
No need to feel the sorrow
We scream (we scream), we shout (whoa)
We are the fallen angels

Scream, shout
We are the fallen angels
Scream, shout (whoa, whoa)

We scream (we scream), we shout (we shout)
We are the fallen angels
We scream (we scream), we shout (whoa, whoa)

To those who sing along
No need to feel the sorrow
We scream (we scream), we shout (whoa)
We are the fallen angels

We scream, we shout
We are the fallen angels
We scream, we shout
Whoa, whoa
Whoa
We shout (whoa)
We are the fallen angels
