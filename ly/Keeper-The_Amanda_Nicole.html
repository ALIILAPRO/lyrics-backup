		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Shake that ass for that cash now
They wonder what the secret is
That's how
Shake that ass for that cash now
They wonder what the secret is
That's how

I got your man he a keeper
He spending bans he gone delete her
I'm a Lamborghini she a beamer
Every pic killin' shit Grim Reaper

Shake that ass for that cash now
They wonder what the secret is
That's how
Shake that ass for that cash now
They wonder what the secret is
That's how

Ima pop it for em if he break me off
Invested cash in this ass ima boss
Slim waist pretty face 
Bitches fake and they hate
They can't wait till the day I fall off
It ain't happening

I gotcha man
He a keeper
He spending bands 
He gon delete her
Ima lamborghini she a beamer
Every pic killing shit grim reaper

Shake that ass for that cash now
They wonder what the secret is
That's how
Shake that ass for that cash now
They wonder what the secret is
That's how

All over seas I go places that a bitch can't come
Catch me stepping out in Prada
Yeah my fit A1
I want every single dollar
I ain't leavin a crumb
Bitch I'm fly as they come 
11 minus the 1

Yeah my milkshake brings all the boys to the yard
Either he coughing up the green or he swiping his card 
This the retirement plan of an ex porn star
Fuck you mean? ion need it
I'm the best by far

Shake that ass for that cash now
They wonder what the secret is
That's how
Shake that ass for that cash now
They wonder what the secret is
That's how
