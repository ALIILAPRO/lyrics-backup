		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I walked through the city limits
(Someone talked me in to try and do it)
Attracted by some force within it
(Had to close my eyes to get close to it)
Around a corner where a prophet lay
(Saw the place where she'd had a room to stay)
A wire fence where the children played
(Saw the bed where the body lay)

And I was looking for a friend of mine
(And I had no time to waste)
Yeah, looking for some friends of mine

The cars screeched, hear the sound on dust
(Heard a noise just a car outside)
Metallic blue turned red with rust
(Pulled in close by the building's side)
In a group all forgotten youth
(Had to think, collect my senses now)
Are turned on to a knife-edged view
(Find some places where my friends don't know)

And I was looking for a friend of mine
(And I had no time to waste)
Yeah, looking for some friends of mine

Down the dark streets (getting darker now)
The houses looked the same (faces look the same)
I walked 'round and 'round (stomach torn apart)
They nailed me to a tree (had to think again)
Trying to find a clue (trying to move away)
Trying to find a way to get out (had to move away and keep out)

Four twelve windows, ten in a row
(Behind a wall where a room to go)
The light shined like a neon show
(See the deep mellow warmth of the glow)
No place to stop, no place to go
(No time to lose, had to keep on going)
I guess they died some time ago
(I guess they died some time ago)

And I was looking for a friend of mine
(And I had no time to waste)
Yeah, looking for some friends of mine
