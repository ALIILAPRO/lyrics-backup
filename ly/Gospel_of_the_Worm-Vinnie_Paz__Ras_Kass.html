		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The dark cold planet, you can't take the drama
Correct with the mental and upright with the info
The dark cold planet, you can't take the drama
Nightmares and troubles, remembering the vision

The dark cold planet, you can't take the drama
Correct with the mental and upright with the info
The dark cold planet, you can't take the drama
Nightmares and troubles, remembering the vision

Cerebellum Cerberus dog, I'm three-headed
Who your favorite rapper, my sock puppet, tell 'em I said it
High octane, my veins pump unleaded
Go hard on beat but this speed got me embedded
No post telemedic, I'm k-k-kinetic
So up jump the pump on the Ku Klux pathetics
I remember we in Ferguson right now
Republicans evicted that black dude from the White House
Couples racists, pointed hoods, stupid night gowns
This is for Selma, this is how a fair fight sounds
I spit patriotic treason
For every black body you left hanging from the trees and
Niggas on steroids thinking you He-Man
Stoupe said you was gayer than three seasons of Glee, man
Every bar is coca-ina, nothing but keys and
Logical like Vulcans, we be throwing up V's, deezam
Boys to men, shizzam
This is diving in volcanoes with a Go-Pro cam
Latinas love my gangstas, say I'm loco man
Like fucking pregnant chicks, how I go so ham
Hard as a motherfucker
Off the wall, nigga

The dark cold planet, you can't take the drama
Correct with the mental and upright with the info
The dark cold planet, you can't take the drama
Nightmares and troubles, remembering the vision

The dark cold planet, you can't take the drama
Correct with the mental and upright with the info
The dark cold planet, you can't take the drama
Nightmares and troubles, remembering the vision

Boxcutter Pazzy, the razor blade and the ox with him
Punch this muhfucker in his chest, take his oxygen
Die muhfucker die, infrared dots on him
Vinnie put the E on the street like he Nils Lofgren
You could either slide or you could take that L
Have this muhfucker torn like an ACL
It's a lot of hype around you, but you ain't gon' sell
You know the son is going to talk because he hate that cell
Why I always had to be the one greasing his kids
Never contributed, nothing, always be in the fridge
I think it's hard for you to even find a reason to live
Run up on his pussy like I got a key to his crib
Fuck this ras clot, I'mma leave him dead in the dirt
And then pop go his mind like he Gerald Levert
And the gat the same color of the herald that surf
I got a rhyme in my mind that'll level the earth

The dark cold planet, you can't take the drama
Correct with the mental and upright with the info
The dark cold planet, you can't take the drama
Nightmares and troubles, remembering the vision

The dark cold planet, you can't take the drama
Correct with the mental and upright with the info
The dark cold planet, you can't take the drama
Nightmares and troubles, remembering the vision
