		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've got you under my skin
I've got you deep in the heart of me
You're so deep in my heart, you're really a part of me
I've got you (yes I do) under my skin

I tried so not to give in
I've said to myself, this affair never will go so well
But why should I try to resist when, darling, I know so well
I've got you under my skin

I'd sacrifice anything, come what might
For the sake of having you near
In spite of a warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats and repeats in my ear

Don't you know, little fool, you never can win
Use your mentality, wake up to reality
But each time I do, just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
'Cause I've got you under my skin

Don't you know, little fool, you never can win
Use your mentality, wake up to reality
But each time that I do, just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
'Cause I've got you under my skin

And I'll love you like a tattoo under my skin
Under my skin
Yes, I've got you under my skin
