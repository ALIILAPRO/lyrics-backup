		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm building this house, on the moon
Like a lost, astronaut
Lookin' at you, like a star
From a place, the world forgot
And there's nothing, that I can do
Except bury my love for you

The brightness of the sun, will give me just enough
To bury my love, in the Moondust
I long to hear your voice, but still I make the choice
To bury my love, in the moondust

Nothing can breath, in the space
Colder than, the darkest sea
I have dreams about the days, driving through your sunset breeze
But the first thing, that I will do
Is bury my love for you

The brightness of the sun, will give me just enough
To bury my love, in the Moondust
I long to hear your voice, but still I make the choice
To bury my love, in the moondust

I'm a cast away, and men reap what they sow
And I say what I know, to be true
Yeah I'm living far away, on the face of the moon
I've buried my love to give the world to you

The brightness of the sun, will give me just enough
To bury my love, in the Moondust
I long to hear your voice, but still I make the choice
To bury my love, in the moondust
