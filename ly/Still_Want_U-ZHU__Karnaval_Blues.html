		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I should be so hurt
'Cause your rejection is so obvious
And I feel stupid and I cry
And I cry and I cry and I cry, yeah
But then I tell myself that it will be okay
But it's not true, I still want you

Oh, why she asking still
I'm moving out of your heart
And I feel stupid and I cry
And I cry and I cry and I cry, yeah
But then I tell myself that it will be okay
But it's not true, I still want you

Lately, I've been thinking about
All the things that we've been through
Lately, I regret all the fucked up
Things that I've put you through

Still tryna learn to be personal
Still uncomfortable being me
Still tryna learn to be vulnerable
Sticking out the song being me

It ain't your fault who I am
It ain't your fault who I am
Oh, it ain't you fault who I am
It ain't your fault who I am

I should be so hurt
'Cause your rejection is so obvious
And I feel stupid and I cry
And I cry and I cry and I cry, yeah
But then I tell myself that it will be okay
But it's not true, I still want you

It ain't you fault who I am
(I still, I still want you)
It ain't your fault who I am
(I still, I still want you)
Oh, it ain't you fault who I am
(I still, I still want you)
It ain't your fault who I am (That it's not true)
(I still, I still want you)

I still want you
I still want you

It ain't your fault who I am
It ain't your fault who I am
Oh, it ain't you fault who I am
It ain't your fault who I am

I still want you
