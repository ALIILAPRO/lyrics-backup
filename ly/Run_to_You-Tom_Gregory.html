		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you let me into your arms
Maybe we could spend the night
Do whatever, whatever, whatever you wanna do, that's alright
If you called me in the morning
And I've been on your mind
'Cause whenever, whenever, whenever you need me I'll be on time

I will run run run to you
If you want want want me to
There's something in the way that you move and I
Wanna run run run to you
I will run run run to you
If you want want want me to
There's something in the way that you move and I
Wanna run run run to you

Did I whisk you off your feet dear?
Would you grace me with your smile?
Forever, forever, forever, forever just you and I
Sounds just fine
And when we both grow older
And I am old and blind
Oh tell me, oh tell me, oh tell me, oh tell me, you'd be by my side
And you'd stay mine

I will run run run to you
If you want want want me to
There's something in the way that you move and I
Wanna run run run to you
I will run run run to you
If you want want want me to
There's something in the way that you move and I
Wanna run run run to you

I will run run run to you
If you want want want me to
There's something in the way that you move and I
Wanna run run run to you

I will run run run to you
If you want want want me to
Oh there's something in the way that you move and I
Wanna run run run to you
I will run to you (I will run run run to you)
I will run to you (if you want want want me to)
There's something in the way that you move and I
Wanna run run run to you
