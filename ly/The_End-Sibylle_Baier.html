		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's the end, friend of mine
It's the end, friend of mine

time is over where we could simply say I love you
Now you opened the door
Leave me crying 
Trying to embrace you again
Trying to face this damn situation man 
I can't
It's the end, friend of mine
It's the end, sweet friend of mine

dear friend, I cannot tell the reasons why we started well
Good time, give me some wine when you open the door
You seem hurt, don't try to speak a word to me
What on earth could really go wrong with you and me?
Yet its the end, friend of mine
It's the end, sweet friend of mine

time seems to be over where we could simply say I love you
Now you opened the door
I feel cold
Wakened, I hold you in my arms
Told you that life is short but love is old
It's the end, friend of mine
It's the end, sweet friend
