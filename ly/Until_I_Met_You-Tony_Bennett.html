		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I used to be so fancy free but really lonesome as can be
Till one lucky day you came my way
I never knew what love was all about
Until I met you
I used to think there'd never be a girl who'd ever care for me
Then what do you know you made it so
I never knew what love was all about

Until I met you
When you kissed me
I felt the seasons change from winter to Spring
When you kissed me
I lost my reason cause I heard the birds sing
I felt like a king
And now I have to rub my eyes each time I try to realize
That your love is mine ain't it just fine
I never knew what love was all about

Until I met you
Since I found you I feel the entire universe reel
I never knew what love was all about
Until I met you
I'm the happiest boy cause you bring me nothing but joy
I never knew what love was all about

Until I met you
When you kissed me
I felt the seasons change from winter to Spring
When you kissed me
I lost my reason cause I heard the birds sing
I felt like a king
And now I have to rub my eyes each time I try to realize
That your love is mine ain't it just fine
I never knew what love was all about

Until I met you
I never knew what love was all about
Until I met you
I never knew what love was all about
Until I met you
