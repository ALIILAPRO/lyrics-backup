		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Verse 1)
Empty pages, unwritten words,
broken spirits, and heart of hurt;
these are the things you made me feel.
Left me lonely and insecure,
broke your promise, walked out the door;
these are the things that you said you'd never do.

(Chorus)
I trusted you when I was falling on the ground. 
I trusted you when it was you who kicked me down.
Still, I trusted you even in my lowest of times.
I trusted you.

(Verse 2)
Broken friendships, tears and pain,
one by one they're leaving me.
I'm so scared to see who's next in line.
Pushing through all these open wounds,
walking by like you never knew.
Close my eyes will it ever go away.

(Chorus)
I trusted you when I was falling on the ground. 
I trusted you when it was you who kicked me down.
Still, I trusted you even in my lowest of times.
I trusted you.
I trusted you.
