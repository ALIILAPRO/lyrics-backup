		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know you feel like
I’m making you choose between 
You and work and me and you
And it seems like
I'm singing the blues before
Healing self-inflicted wounds
I didn’t mean to grow apart
Loving you with a broken heart
I'm sorry in real time


I wasn’t right for you
But I put up a fight for you
Give me the good news
Or the bad news
Only god knows where I'd be
If you were right for me


I kinda feel like
I'm blowing a fuse between
Losing work and losing you
And it seems like
When I’m feeling blue
I'm incapable of feeling you
You didn’t mean to touch a nerve
But leaving really fucking hurt
I'm sorry you realized


I wasn’t right for you
But I put up a fight for you
Give me the good news
Or the bad news
Only god knows where I'd be
If you were right for me

I wasn’t right for you
But I put up a fight for you
Give me the good news
Or the bad news
Only god knows where I'd be
If you were right for me
