		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't know where my man is
Where can he be? What is he doing?
I've been asking questions all over town
Where is he? Where can he be?
Hoping he can be found
I'm on the loose, and I don't dig it
Take my advice, if you find a man
Girl, hold on tight, don't let him
If you want him, don't let him
Hold on, hold on to him tight

I don't know where my man is
Where can he be? What is he doing?
I've been looking, I've been searching
I've been asking questions all over town
Where is he? Where can he be?
Hoping he can be found
I'm on the loose, and I don't dig it
Take my advice, if you find, if you find, if you find, if you find, if you find a man
Hold on to him tight
Don't let him, don't let him
If you want him, hold on, hold on to him tight
But if you don't, if you don't want him
Just let him go, let him go, let him go
Hold on tight, don't let him go
Don't let him go

If, if you want him, don't let him go
If you want him, don't let him go
Don't let, don't let, don't let, don't let
Don't let him go, don't let
Don't let him go, don't
Don't let him go, don't
Don't let him go, don't let him
Don't let him go, don't let him go
Don't let him go, don't
Don't let him go
Let him go, don't let him go, don't let
Don't let him go, don't
Don't let him go, don't
Don't let him go, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't
Hold on to him tight
