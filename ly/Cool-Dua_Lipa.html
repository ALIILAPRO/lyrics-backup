		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Guess I never had a love like this (ah-ha)
Hit me harder than I ever expected (ooh-ooh)
We've been up all goddamn night, all night, all night (ah-ha)
Keep it going 'til we see the sunlight

When the color of the sky lookin' nice, so nice
You know, you know, you know
Baby, I can see us in the real life
You know, you know, you got

Got me losin' all my cool
'Cause I'm burnin' up on you
In control of what I do
And I love the way you move
We got the heat and the thrill
Gives you more than any pill
Never runnin' out of juice
When it's only me and you

You got me, you got me losin' all my cool
I guess we're ready for the summer

I like us better when we're intertwined (ah-ha)
The way you touch me got me losin' my senses (hey)
Put your love with your lips on mine, on mine, on mine (ah-ha)
You got me workin' up an appetite, 'tite

When the color of the sky lookin' nice, so nice
You know, you know, you know
Baby, I can see us in the real life
You know, you know, you got

Got me losin' all my cool
'Cause I'm burnin' up on you
In control of what I do
And I love the way you move
We got the heat and the thrill
Gives you more than any pill
Never runnin' out of juice
When it's only me and you

You got me, you got me losin' all my cool
I guess we're ready for the summer (ooh, ooh)
You got me, you got me losin' all my cool
I guess we're ready for the summer (ooh, ooh)

Skin-tight
I'll show you heaven, there's nothing better
I'll give it to you all night
You know, you know, you know
Got me losin' all my cool
Yeah, you like the way I move
In control of what I do
Yeah, my love makes you brand new

Got me losin' all my cool (woo)
'Cause I'm burnin' up on you (huh)
In control of what I do
And I love the way you move
We got the heat and the thrill
Gives you more than any pill
Never runnin' out of juice (woo)
When it's only me and you
When it's only me and you (yeah)

Hey
I guess we're ready for the summer (ooh, ooh)
You got me, you got me losin' all my cool (hey)
I guess we're ready for the summer (ooh, ooh)
You got me, you got me losin' all my cool
