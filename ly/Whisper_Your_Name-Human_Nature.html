		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby, I know you've been missin' me
(And he knows you've been playin' around)
We make a special kind of chemistry
(Every time you've been coming down)
Oh, if it's wrong to be lovin' you
(Why does it feel so good to me?
Baby tell me what I gotta do
(To lay you down and to make you believe)
We rocked the cradle let it fall
Leave him now or lose it all
We got something special that we won't find again
'Cause every time I lie with you
Babe, he knows you're lyin' too
Tell me who's lovin' you

Oh, tell me
Does he whisper your name?
Can he love you like this?
Does he love you the way that I love you beby?
Does he ever whisper your name?
Can he love you like this?
Does he love you the way that I love you baby?

Oh (way that I love)

I never thought I'd be doin' you
(But I heard you were diggin' on me)
Can't you see what we got into
(It's not a fling you can get up and leave)
You had the time, baby, I had the place
(So we could get it on)
So, baby turn around and show your face
('Cause it's time you let him see)

We rocked the cradle let it fall
Playin' me you risked it all
Baby, we made lovin' like we won't find again
'Cause every time I lie with you
Babe, he knows you're lying too
Tell me who's loving you

Oh, tell me
Does he whisper your name?
Can he love you like this?
Does he love you the way that I love you baby?
Does he ever whisper your name?
Can he love you like this? (Like this, like that)
Does he love you the way that I love you baby?

Does he whisper your name?
Can he love you like this?
Does he love you the way that I love you baby?
Does he ever whisper your name?
Can he love you like this?
Does he love you the way that I love you baby?

(Look at me now) I know that I'm for real
(Gotta believe) Oh, I'll love you like no other baby
(Now is the time) Time to tell him goodbye
No-one else can love like I do
(No-one loves you the way that I love you)

Does he whisper your name?
Can he love you like this? (Like this, like that)
Does he love you the way that I love you baby?
Does he ever whisper your name?
Can he love you like this?
Does he love you the way that I love you baby?

Does he whisper your name?
Can he love you like this? (Like this, like that)
Does he love you the way that I love you baby?
Does he ever whisper your name?
Can he love you like this?
Does he love you the way that I love you baby?
