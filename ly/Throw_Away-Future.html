It's gon' be okay, okay, oh, it's gon' be okay
Me and my niggas, we don't play with you, it's gon' be okay
I don't want no relations, I just want your facial
I don't want no relations, I just want your facial
Pour some alcohol and drank it baby, go on and taste it
Pour some alcohol and drank it baby, go on and taste it
I want no relations, I just want your facial
Girl, you know you like a pistol, you a throw away

We gon' drank, girl, we gon' drank like it's Cinco De Mayo
I won't ever tell you anything your heart desires
It's gon' be okay, okay, girl its gon' be okay
I don't want no confrontation, it's too complicated
Pour my lean for me baby, you a hottie thottie
I'm gon' fuck you in Atlanta like we on an island
I can't lose my concentration, girl, ain't goin' on dates
If we have a conversation, gotta fuck today
I ain't disrespectful, never, I ain't disrespectful
Got a black girl and a white one, call 'em salt and pepper
I call one of 'em a Beamer and one a Kompressor (skrr)
I told her, I would call her back and I forgot to text her (DJ EscoMoe)

It's gon' be okay, okay, oh, it's gon' be okay
Ma and my niggas, we don't play with you it's gon' be okay
I don't want no relations, I just want your facial
I don't want no relations, I just want your facial
Pour some alcohol and drank it baby, go on and taste it
Pour some alcohol and drank it baby, go on and taste it
I want no relations, I just want your facial
Girl, you know you like a pistol, you a throw away

DJ EscoMoeCity, the coolest DJ on the motherfuckin' planet

Deep down, I believe you know you're a monster too
Go on, fuck that nigga, get it over with
Go on, fuck that nigga, get it over with
Go on, fuck that nigga, get it over with
Go on, fuck that nigga, get it over with
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Future Hendrix

I know your true feelings ain't
They couldn't be here, you hear me?
They gotta be somewhere else

I ain't worried 'bout no fucking 
I ain't worried 'bout no fucking
Does sexing on the late night mean that much to ya?
My love don't mean that much to ya
Fucking these hoes meant too damn much to you
I just hope up when you fuckin' on a nigga, when you finish
He can say that he love ya
Now do you feel better 'bout yourself?
Do you feel better 'bout yourself?
Did you feel better when I left?
Mark my words I'ma ball without you
I came home last night to a ménage
Got my dick sucked I was thinking about you
I was fucking on a slut and I was thinking about you
When you're fucking on a nigga, hope you're thinking about me
When you laying with that nigga, hope you thinking about me
'Cause I'm thinking about you
Go on, fuck that nigga, get it over with
Go on, fuck that nigga, get it over with

I want you to fuck him in paradise
'Cause I wanna be in your air tonight
If loving me in public ain't safe
You can take my love and hide it
Don't give up on me today
Hold on to me like a true love
I told you it was a true love
I ended up with temptations
You going out the country, you posting up on IG
I'm layed up with my side piece
I wanna text by you was right there laying up beside me
Now tell me you don't want me
Tell me that the pussy ain't mines no more
Tell me you're moving on, you don't love me no more
Monster

I ain't worried 'bout no fucking 
I ain't worried 'bout no fucking
Does sexing on the late night mean that much to ya?
My love don't mean that much to ya
Fucking these hoes meant too damn much to you
I just hope up when you fuckin' on a nigga, when you finish
He can say that he love ya
Now do you feel better 'bout yourself?
Do you feel better 'bout yourself?
Did you feel better when I left?
Mark my words I'ma ball without you
I came home last night to a ménage
Got my dick sucked I was thinking about you
I was fucking on a slut and I was thinking about you
When you're fucking on a nigga, hope you're thinking about me
When you laying with that nigga, hope you thinking about me
'Cause I'm thinking about you
Go on, fuck that nigga, get it over with
Go on, fuck that nigga, get it over with
