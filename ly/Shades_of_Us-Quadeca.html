		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Woke up on your side of the bed
It's been a long, long day
We came a long, long way
We went the wrong, wrong way, ayy, ayy
Can we follow those tears?
The kind you can't wipe away
Where did you go? Where did you go?

Smokin' in the rain again
I think about what's holdin' up this flame again
And it ain't like the way it was
Now it's just shades of us, shades of us
Smokin' in the rain again
Remind me what is holdin' up this flame again
And it ain't like the way it was
Now it's just shades of us, shades of us

Sometimes I reminisce, then I cringe so much that I audibly go fuck
And the people around look at me like I'm insane
I'm sorry, you would do the same shit if you were inside my brain
Said some stupid shit, maybe it's time to change
Now I'm on the road stayin' inside the lanes
I been inside the frame
Even when I'm outside, I'm still inside the rain
They pushin' my buttons, think I'm inside the game
I just want love, but that's outside my reach
Always inside my aim
And that makes it even worse for me when it's time for shame
Oh, say it's our decision, but you know it's never been mine to make
I am not surprised, it must've been my mistake
I got a dad bod and I'm nineteen
Didn't go the way it did in my dreams, yeah (yeah)

Smokin' in the rain again
I think about what's holdin' up this flame again
And it ain't like the way it was
Now it's just shades of us, shades of us
Smokin' in the rain again
Remind me what is holdin' up this flame again
And it ain't like the way it was
Now we're just shades of us, shades of us

Woke up on your side of the bed
It's been a long, long day
We came a long, long way (long way)
I went the wrong, wrong way (wrong, wrong way) and
Can I follow those tears? (Those tears)
The kind I can't wipe away (oh)
Where did it go? (Oh) Where did I go?
