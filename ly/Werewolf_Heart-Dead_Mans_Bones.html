		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You'd look nice in a grave
I smile at the moon, death is on my face
And if you wait too long
Then you'll never see the dawn again

My skull is full of sunken ships
My heart's a prisoner to my ribs
We're flesh and bone when we're all alone
But together, forever, we'll live

There's gold in my heart
But the winds took my sails through the dark
And if you wait too long
then you'll never see the dawn again

He filled my heart, I did my best
But without the sun, I'm only shadows in a dress
'Cause if the full moon comes, our love is done
So forever, towards dawn, we run
