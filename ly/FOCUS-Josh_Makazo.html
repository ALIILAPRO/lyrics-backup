		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No one knows
No one knows all that you want (You want)
So you're done
So you're done you've had enough (Enough)
You said he's not the one (No one)
You'd rather give in
You'd run (You'd run)
You're holding on (Holding on)
But you don't feel love
No love
But you never chose this
Over time through the night it's when you noticed
That no one's here to stay
You lost your focus
Over time through the night at your lowest
You're
Rolling through the street
Tip toe got inches off your feet
You won't trust anyone you meet
No way (No way)
Rolling through the street
No you're riding in it deep
You can't trust anyone you meet
No love
But you never chose this
Over time through the night it's when you noticed
That no one's here to stay
You lost your focus
Over time through the night at your lowest
You're frozen deep inside your dreams you run away
But you always seem to stay
Frozen set behind the feeling of your pain
Cause you always seem to stay
Frozen deep in your dreams it's the same
but you always seem to stay
Frozen set behind the feeling of your pain
Cause you always seem to stay
