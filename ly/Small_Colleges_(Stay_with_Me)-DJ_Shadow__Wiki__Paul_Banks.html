		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Stay with me
Stay with me
Stay with me

My mind's leaving me
Someone speak to me some kind of reasoning
A sign
I'm freaking out, I'm Ron Weasely
Time and time again
I talk to myself, I go on and on and then
Homie just stopped speaking, see
Rapping from my soul
My hand, it ain't reaching me
Time ain't on my side
Sand leaking, could lose a piece of me
The time piece, the hour glass, measure the pieces please
Be my power back
Without my mind I'm just a piece of me

Stay with me
Stay with me

Now there's nothing left to see there
Now there's nothing left to be
Now there's nothing left to see there
Now there's nothing left to be
Friends, been running out on them
Found a way to begin
Found a way to be gone

They told me there's nothing I couldn't do, so
What am I without you though?
How can I be too slow to realize how you move go on?
Vamoose, son of a- who knows
Way when loopholes, he ain't know where he at
It's hard to tell with me 
His wish been wanting so long never even looked 
or cared to check
There goes my head, my character
What I should have cherished best
Wonder how losing my mind compares to death

(Stay with me) now there's nothing left to see there
Now there's nothing left to be
Look you gotta (stay with me)
Now there's nothing left to see there
Now there's nothing left

Now there's nothing left to see there (nothing)
Now there's nothing left to be
Now there's nothing left to see there
Now there's nothing left to be

Stay with me
Stay with me

Be gone, uhh
