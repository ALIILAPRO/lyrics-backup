		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I still hear the sound of that runaway train
Rolled through my heart as lost lovers refrain
But I know in my heart I can never go back
To the way that we were on that runaway track

I see in my soul that I know you were lying to me
I lose control
Oh I didn't know
Was I just too young?

But why do I feel so old?
'Cause I'm still so young

Yeah, but it all comes down to
What it all comes down to
It all comes down to
Yeah it all comes down to
It all comes down to
It all comes down to you

If you see it
Why couldn't you do it
And you're so alone tonight
It's heartbreaking,
The road you choose and God wouldn't save you
Love is a battle oh
Everybody cries

It all comes down to
What it all comes down to
It all comes down to
Yeah it all comes down to
It all comes down to
Yeah it all comes down to you

Well if you live in my heart
You're the vision in my soul
Now I feel so alone
Like I'm losing control
But here's to you

Why do I feel so old?
'Cause I'm still so young

But it all comes down to
What it all comes down to
It all comes down to
Yeah, it all comes down to
It all comes down to
It all comes down to you
(All comes down to you)

But it all comes down to
What it all comes down to
It all comes down to
Yeah, it all comes down to
It all comes down to
It all comes down to you
(All comes down to you)

But it all come down to
It all comes down to you
(All comes down to you)
But it all come down to
It all comes down to you
(All comes down to you)
(All comes down to you)
(All comes down to you)
(All comes down to you)
