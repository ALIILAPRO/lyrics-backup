		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  After all of our graffiti fades
And the wet concrete where we wrote our names
Gets paved over
Paved over

When our initials in the willow tree
Become another artifact of history
Grown over
Remember I told ya

We were here
We fell in love
We shared our tears in some
Corner of the universe

We were here
We lived our lives
We laughed and hurt sometimes
All along we wrote the words
We were here
We were here

Put the moments in a picture frame
And we hang em up because we're too afraid
To lose something
But I know one thing

We were here
We fell in love
We shared our tears in some
Corner of the universe

We were here
We lived our lives
We laughed and hurt sometimes
All along we wrote the words
We were here
We were here
We were here
We were here

Alive and along for the wildest ride
Ohhhhh
Alive we belong to the stars in our eyes
Ohhhhh

We were here
We fell in love
We shared our tears in some
Corner of the universe

We were here
We lived our lives
We laughed and hurt sometimes
All along we wrote the words
We were here
We were here
We were here
We were here
