		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got the engines running
and the systems are checked
this will be the day, will be the day, will be the day that I'll never forget
never felt like much of a man
always felt like a bird
my mother always said I'm insane
but a bird won't get hurt

oh lord, the weather has changed
heavy clouds in the south
but I know how to tame a hurricane
once you're in, you get out
they say it's impossible, but I'm extraordinarily trained I'm a no-mistake man
I don't mind to entertain, I got a name
I got it all in my handsâ€¨
and the engines sing

and the engines sing

operator, operator see you later
I'm over and out
oh, believe me in moments like this
there's no room for doubt
I hear the engines singing goodbye
so I turn the music loud
I'm sure attitude trumps altitude
I'm singing on, so mother's proud, so mother's proud

oh my lord come please get me out of here

oh, I don't wanna fade don't wanna fade away so easily
