		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I, I was the game he would play
He brought the clouds to my day
Then like a ray of light
You came my way one night
Just one look and I knew
You would make everything clear
Make all the clouds disappear
Put all your fears to rest
Who do I love the best
Don't you know, don't you know?

You've got it all over him
You got me over him
Honey, it's true
There's just you
You must have been heaven-sent
Hearing me call, you went out on a limb

And you're all that he's not
Just look what I've got
'Cause you've got it all
Over him

No, don't let him worry you so
Once I met you, I let go
Oh you can surely see
You're so much more to me

Just one look and I knew
You would make everything clear
Make all the clouds disappear
You're better than all the rest
Who do I love the best
Don't you know, don't you know?

You've got it all over him
You got me over him
Honey, it's true
There's just you
You must have been heaven-sent
Hearing me call, you went out on a limb

And you're all that he's not
Just look what I've got
'Cause you've got it all
All over him

Honey, it's true
There's just you
You must have been heaven-sent
Hearing me call, you went out on a limb

And you're all that he's not
Just look what I've got
'Cause you've got it all
All over him

Honey, it's true
There's just you
You must have been heaven-sent
Hearing me call, you went out on a limb

And you're all that he's not
Just look what I've got
'Cause you've got it all
Over him
