		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  By my side,
You'll never be.
By my side,
You'll. never. be.

'Cause I'm fake at the seams,
I'm lost in my dreams, and
And I want you to know,
That I can't let you go.

And you're never coming home again,
And you're never coming home again.

By my side,
You'll never be.
By my side,
You'll. never. be.(x2)

I wanted to tell you I changed.
I wanted to tell you that things would be different this time.

I see you, you see me,
Differently.
I see you, you see me,
Differently.

You tell me that you love me but you never want to see me again. (x4)
