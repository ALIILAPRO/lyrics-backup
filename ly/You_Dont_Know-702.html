		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, 702, come on
Soulshock and Karlin
That's right
Oh, oh
You and me
702, yeah

Why'd you leave?
I gave you everything
So why you wanna tell me lies?
You mean so much to me
You know I can't believe
That you have got me open like you do

Now what a girl got to do to make you see
That we should be together, you and me
I want your love
I get excited, I can't fight it
Baby, you just don't know

You don't know what you do
Got me loving you
So please don't go 'cause
You don't know what you do
Got me all over you
And I don't know what to do about us
You don't know what you do
Got me loving you
So please don't go 'cause
You don't know what you do
Got me all over you
And I don't know what to do about us

Can't you see
That you're hurting me
Build me up and let me down, down (down)
Oh, ain't never felt this way before (no no)
Don't walk out the door (uh uh)
I can't take no more

Baby, what a girl got to do to make you see?
(What a girl got to do to make you see?)
That we should be together, you and me
I want your love
I get excited, can't fight it
Baby, you just don't know

You don't know what you do
Got me loving you
So please don't go 'cause
You don't know what you do
Got me all over you
And I don't know what to do about us
You don't know what you do
Got me loving you
So please don't go 'cause
You don't know what you do
Got me all over you
And I don't know what to do about us

Baby, yeah
Can't you see
You're killing me
Oh yeah
You just don't know
I like your flow
Come dig me though
Can't take no more (I don't think they ready for this)
Really though, really though, really though
Damn

Oh, oh
Uh (oh)
702
Oh, oh
Just don't know
Yeah
Uh
Come on
You just don't know

You don't know what you do
Got me loving you
So please don't go 'cause
You don't know what you do
Got me all over you
And I don't know what to do about us
You don't know what you do
Got me loving you
So please don't go 'cause
You don't know what you do
Got me all over you
And I don't know what to do about us

You don't know what you do
Got me loving you
So please don't go 'cause
You don't know what you do
Got me all over you
And I don't know what to do about us
You don't know what you do
Got me loving you
So please don't go 'cause
You don't know what you do
Got me all over you
And I don't know what to do about us

Yeah, 702
You don't know
