		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Get up, get up, get up, drop the bombshell
Get up, get up, this is out of control
Get up, get up, get up, drop the bombshell
Get up, get up, (Get gone)

Now look who's coming, yeah, look who's back
Quick, drop the bombshell straight to the track
Twenty first century killing machine
Burnt on the inside, a five-headed team
Now I'm not the same because you're not the same
And you're not the same because I'm not the same
And we're not the same this could never be the same
And we just want to survive

Get up, get up, get up, drop the bombshell
Get up, get up, this is out of control
Get up, get up, get up, drop the bombshell
Get up, get up, (Get gone)

Get up, get up, get up, drop the bombshell
Get up, get up, this is out of control
Get up, get up, get up, drop the bombshell
Get up, get up, (Get gone)

Now you want to save us and you want it all
And you want the transmit 'cause you want the call
And you want the one that makes the worlds the collide
But since that has happened it has grown twice inside

(I'm not the same)
(I'm not the same)
(I'm not the same)
(I'm not the same)

Get up, get up, get up, drop the bombshell
Get up, get up, this is out of control
Get up, get up, get up, drop the bombshell
Get up, get up, (Get gone)

Get up, get up, get up, drop the bombshell
Get up, get up, this is out of control
Get up, get up, get up, drop the bombshell
Get up, get up, (Get gone)

Get up, get up (Drop the bombshell)
Get up, get up (Drop the bombshell)

Get up, get up, get up, drop the bombshell
Get up, get up, this is out of control
Get up, get up, get up, drop the bombshell
Get up, get up, (Get gone)

(Everybody should drop the bomb)

Yeah! (Everybody should drop the bomb)
