		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Are you alone now
Did you lose the monkey
He gave you backaches
And now you slouch

He didn't mean it
He's just a dumb ape
Reading Playboy
On your couch

And now it's time to say
What I forgot to say
Baby, baby, baby
Come on, what's wrong
It's a radiation vibe, I'm groovin' on
Don't it make you want to get some sun
Shine on, shine on, shine on

I went to Pittsburgh
And joined a pro team
Talk about a bad dream
I broke a knee

But I can still croon
And make the girls swoon
Isn't that the way life's
Supposed to be

But now it's time to say
What I forgot to say
Baby, baby, baby
Come on, what's wrong
It's a radiation vibe I'm groovin' on
Don't it make you want to get some sun
Shine on, shine on, shine on
Shine on, shine on, shine on

And now it's time to say
What I forgot to say
Baby, baby, baby
Come on, what's wrong
It's a radiation vibe I'm groovin' on
Don't it make you want to get some sun
Shine on, shine on, shine on

Baby, baby, baby
Come on, what's wrong
It's a radiation vibe I'm groovin' on
Don't it make you want to get some sun
Shine on, shine on, shine on
Shine on, shine on, shine on
Shine on, shine on, shine on
