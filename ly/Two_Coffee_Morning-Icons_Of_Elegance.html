		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Shut out the noise, sit back
Make yourself comfy, relax
We're back in the swing of things
Don't you think?

Seems like we're right on track
It's finally looking up
We're getting the hang of this
Don't you think?

This is a two coffee morning
Sliding into control
A two coffee morning
Giving way
To another fine day
A two coffee morning
Giving way
To another fine day

Nice how it flows
Nice how it's shaping up
We'll get a feel for this
Don't you think?

This is a two coffee morning
Sliding into control
A two coffee morning
Giving way
To another fine day

This is a two coffee morning
Sliding into control
A two coffee morning
Giving way
To another fine day
A two coffee morning
Giving way
To another fine day
